This recipe is delicious, definitely restaurant-quality, and super easy too!  My one complaint is that there is not quite enough sauce.  I think next time I will double it.  I would make two suggestions for anyone making this dish.  First, make sure to chop the onions finely.  This way they incorporate into the sauce better instead of having big chunks of onion floating around, resulting in a strange texture.  Also, when the chicken is cooked, tent it under foil to keep it warm and seal in the moisture.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

This recipe is excellent, however I gave it only 4 stars because the measurements of the liquids need to be changed because I wanted way more sauce (I made it one time before and it didnt have enough sauce) and also I wanted it thicker. I put 2 cups heavy cream, 1/2 cup water, 1 cup milk, and I still had to add another 1/4 c. heavy cream w/ some flour mixed in to thicken it up. But after that, it was absolutely incredible. And the chicken also comes out softer if you use thighs and other parts rather than breasts in my opinion.

Awesome awesome recipe! In fact, the best I've had on allrecipes yet! I strayed pretty far from the original recipe so I apologize to the Chef but it turned out just awesome. First, I cut the chicken in small strips then dipped in an egg wash and coated in a flour/Italian bread crumb mix with paprika, black pepper, oregano, sweet basil, and salt. Then I fried with onions and minced garlic - it turned out incredibly yummy. Then set aside the chicken and use that pan to simmer additional onions, red peppers and chicken broth. In the meantime I prepared the asparagus: arrange so tips are even then rubberband and blanche in hot water for 1-2 min until bright green. Put in cold water to stop cooking then arrange in an even layer on cookie sheet. Lightly brush with olive oil and then salt. Cook for 5 min in 400 degree oven until sizzling. Then cut into 1 inch pieces and throw into the skillet with the chicken, red peppers, etc at the very end. I also found it needed a lot more sauce and probably would've doubled the sauce. (Of course I added more stuff too so I definitely needed more.) I hardly used any milk mainly the heavy cream in the sauce. Breading the chicken and mixing it in with the sauce and pasta helped thicken the sauce a bit as well (I did mix everything together at the end). I know a lot of reviewers said the sauce was a bit runny. My husband and I about died when we ate this it was just so incredible. We're looking forward to the leftovers for dinner tonight!!!! Thank

I found this recipe months ago and thought that I had already written a review on it, till I happened to check the reviews...my family fights over the leftovers the next day with this delicious recipe.  The only changes I made were I used about 1 tbs. minced garlic in a jar and also instead of a chicken bouillion cube and the 1/2 cup water, just added 1/2 cup chicken broth instead....Other than that, followed the recipe and my family asks for it every other Sunday night..(they'd eat it EVERY Sunday but I don't want to ruin a good thing)...thanks for the recipe it is indeed our favorite chicken supper.....

I thought this was pretty good, a bit milky as it is written.  If I were to make it again, I would leave out the milk, the cream is enough and I think I'd add something (probably nutmeg or rosemary) just to jazz it up a little.

I had to create an account, just so that I could tell everyone how much I loved this recipe!  I have been visiting this site for years and have never found a recipe that I enjoyed so much!  I'm going to have my fiancee make this again for me tonight and add a red bell pepper!  Great job!

Delightfully Delicious!!! I served it bit differently though, I placed pasta on the dinner plate and spooned sauce onto the pasta then I sliced a chicken breast (I used one breast per serving instead of mixing everything in one bowl) and scattered the slices on to the pasta and sauce and spooned more sauce over the sliced chicken then I shredded some parmesan cheese over the top. I loved the presentation and everyone LOVED the flavor!!! 
I did double the sauce ingredients as I was afraid there wouldn't be enough and it came out perfectly. My husband was the lucky one to take the leftovers to work for lunch the next day and he said it was as good if not a bit better than the original meal had been!

(o7/23/2006)This was great with a few alterations: I added extra garlic and sugar snap peas and prosciutto right near the end of cooking.  I also let the sauce boil a bit after adding the cream to give it a nice rich thickness.  I omitted the green onions, except a few pieces for colour as a garnish on top.  Fresh mushrooms would be good in this too.  This is a great base recipe thanks for posting! I will make this again. - (07/11/2007) - I made this again without the addition of peas and prosciutto; it was nice, but I still like it better with the extras.

Made this for lunch today = EXCELLENT! I only used 4 chicken breasts and while sauting them, I lightly seasoned them with cajun seasoning and lemon pepper seasoning. I also added a sliced green bell pepper to the onion saute.  Hmmm good! Next time, I might add a diced tomato when I add the green onions for some additional taste and color but overall, we loved this and would make this again and again.

Wow! Excellent!. I found buy accident when I had no cream, that a package of cream cheese pushed this one over the edge.  And yes, as one of the other review said chop those white onions up good.

I really like this recipe and its a good base to add some other flares of your own. I dry rubbed the chicken with black pepper, salt, dried garlic flakes, parsley, and chives and then cooked it along with the garlic, onion, oil and butter to really get some flavor into the meat. After removing the chicken, I used about a 3:1 ratio of heavy cream to chicken stock in the pan with the leftover juices from the chicken pan. Reduced over medium heat while stirring and ended up with a very tasty sauce. If yours is too thick, add a little more stock or milk, if its too thin, add a little more heavy cream and continue to reduce over heat. I think a nice addition to this would be some diced tomato and some crisped and finely chopped bacon which will give it a little extra oomph. Also, I didnt add the parmesan to the sauce but instead grated fresh parmesan on the top of the dish and sprinkled some fresh chopped parsley for flavor and color/presentation. Made this for my girlfriend and she was very impressed. I recommend this recipe! (And follow the others comments about making double the sauce...you will need it).

I agree with a lot of reviewers that there wasn't enough sauce for the amount of pasta and chicken used.  That said, this was delicious!  I used half the amount of pasta and two large breasts, halved.  I made the whole sauce recipe only making a few substitutions:  chicken stock for the bouillon and water, half and half for heavy cream, and I left out the green onions only because I didn't have any.  I also added about a teaspoon of flour at the end of cooking the sauce to get it to thicken, but probably could have left it out after seeing how thick it got when combining it with the pasta.  My fiance and I loved this.  Thank you!

This was heavenly. Not sure what some of the reviewers are talking about when they say this dish lacks flavor. It was extremely good. The only things I did different was I cooked onion with the garlic and chicken, omit the milk and use 2 cups of heavy cream, and once I added cream, I simmered it for about 7 or 8 minutes to thicken and then added parmesan and simmered it for another 3 or 4 minutes. Added noodles and chicken and ate a creamy/flavorful dinner.

Restaurant quality!! I used chicken broth instead of water. Used half and half, and used about 1/4 cup mixed with flour to thicken. Used two cloves garlic. Simmered onion and garlic with broth, then added half and half mixture.

This really did taste like a restaurant dish - delicious and very, very rich.

I used a vegetable bouillon cube and Morningstar Farms Chik'n strips for a vegetarian version of the recipe, and added chopped mushrooms to the sauce. It was delicious!

Absolutely wonderful!!!  Perfect for us as my husband doesn't care for heavy white sauces so I serve his up first and then add more parmesan cheese to the rest and I get to enjoy it the way I like it!!!!!!

I've made this recipe numerous times and it's wonderful!  I decided to change it up a bit because of ingridients I had on hand...  So, I only had skin on and bone in chicken breasts - which I seasoned with salt and cajun seasonings, drizzled with garlic olive oil and roasted in the oven.  Once cooled I pulled of the skin and bones (used to make an amazing chicken stock BTW) and chopped the chicken in cubes.  In a skillet I sauted the onion and garlic (5 cloves) in butter and garlic olive oil until tender.  Then I added some sliced mushrooms and cooked until moisture was gone.  Then instead of chicken broth I used a dry white wine (WINNER!!!) and sauted for another 10minutes.  I then made the sauce as the recipe states only doubling the amounts, as previous reviews states, it's kind of dry if you don't double the sauce. Then I added the chicken to the veggie and sauce mixture and poured over pasta.  I also brushed some of that same garlic oil on sliced french bread and grilled it and this was the most amazing version of this recipe I've made!

Not sure what went wrong. I'm used to making cream based pasta sauce. This sauce is thin and runny. My cheese never melted into it.

You can make this a little lighter and still have a dish with a lot of flavor. I find that I only need about two large chicken breasts, pounded semi-thin. I triple the garlic, use whole wheat pasta and instead of bouillion and water, I use organic chicken broth. Instead of heavy cream, I use fat free evaporated milk or fat free half-n-half. I don't use all the parmesan cheese called for, half a cup is plenty. It works out just the same texture and taste-wise but with half the fat/calories. This is really good if you cut the pasta in half and toss in some steamed or roasted broccoli, too.

Thought this was a good dish.  However, I recommend using Half & Half (Fat Free) and skim milk.  Also don't let the cream thicken up too much.  I did that and it made the dish extremely thick.  I think it will thicken on its own.

AMAZING. I followed other suggestions and doubled the sauce, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as it says. Wow.

Although I read several of the other reviewer's suggestions about the sauce I decided to try the recipe as written before making any modifications.  The sauce was very thin and I hoped that it would thicken if I let it simmer a while.  Unfortunately that didn't happen.  It was tasty, but when I make this again I'll leave out the milk and increase cream as needed.  I think this would also be good with shrimp and crab instead of the chicken.

Good recipe. I followed Cookette007's suggestions of doing and egg wash and breading with panko crumbs. I used more cream than it called for (and double the water) and thought it was too runny. Maybe just 50% more liquid for the sauce. I added red pepper, asparagus, mushrooms, green onions and sun-dried tomatoes to the chicken broth, covered, and simmered 10 minutes (as per recipe). Everything else I followed to the original recipe.

We had this for dinner last night and were very pleased!  I used two chicken breast halves, but made half the recipe of sauce, based on suggestions made by other reviewers.  I minced the onions (not the green onions) so they would dissolve into the sauce, which worked very well.  I did add a little Cajun seasoning to the sauce to punch up the flavor a bit, and I thickened it just slightly with a corn starch/water slurry.  When plating I garnished this with green onion tops and diced tomatoes for a little more color.  Delicious!  And one I’ll be making again!

Very good recipe! However, I agree with others that the sauce needs to be doubled. The more sauce the better, in my opinion. I also added some basil and extra garlic.

I subbed some chicken broth and jarred Alfredo sauce for the water and cream. I also threw in some sauteed asparagus tips and pimientos for color and cut back on the onion.

The dish was yummy but had several issues. There was not enough sauce and it could have been  thicker. Also, the onions were a bit of a turn off, I agree they need to be diced fine. I added portabello mushrooms, green and red bell peppers, and zucchini. I don't think I will try this one again, too much to fix.

This recipe was YUMMITASKIC!! I had to add another cup of cheese and 1/2 cup more cream to thicken the base up some more. What I found is when I served this for dinner it was still soupy.  However, if you let it sit all mixed together for about 15 minutes the noodles absorb the creamy mixture at this point it was AWESOME!

Wow, love this recipe!! Just made it and all four of us LOVED it... that never happens, ever! I have an 8 yr old and a 3 yr old and they have never once liked the same thing... this they did, yay!  Definitely adding it to our regular dinner routine! :)  After reading other reviews I made the following changes... Used 6 chicken tenders rather than breasts as I was cooking for four, used half a package of pasta, left the sauce amount the same, used 2 garlic cloves rather than 1 and sauteed them with the onion so they wouldn't burn and only used 1/2 of an onion since kids were involved.  It was awesome. Thanks for the recipe :)

Oh my gosh! This is the best recipe for a creamy chicken kick. This is better than any restaurant style creamy chicken on linguine. People you need to try this! I did double the sauce like others suggested. Good thing I read reviews first. :-) I love plenty sauce.

This was so-oo good! My family thinks that I'm spoiling them with recipes from this site! When I was making this, I had my doubts--the sauce looked unappetizing before the cream was added, and I thought 2 kinds of onion was too much. Was I wrong! The sauce was scrumptious; I only wish I had doubled the recipe for leftovers! I only made 1 change, out of necessity. I was out of milk, but had 2 cups of cream, so I used that. Creamy goodness! Can't wait to make this again.

I just made this for dinner and it is wonderful!! Instead of preparing the chicken the way that the recipe suggested, I diced the chicken into cubes and sauteed it with garlic, parsley and a little Italian seasoning while boiling the water for the pasta at the same time.  when i removed the chicken from the oil/butter, i dusted it with parmesan cheese.  Then i doubled the sauce as suggested by many other reviewers and simmered everything together for a few minutes at the end to infuse the flavors and allow the sauce time to thicken.  it turned out amazingly!  I will definitely make this again, maybe adding some fresh basil at the end.

this was very good, i used shrimp instead of chicken and i put the cooked pasta in the pan with the sauce to really soak it.  the sauce wasn't as thick as i like so i let the whole thing sit in the pan for a couple minutes and it was fine.  quick and tasty!

Delicious! My picky husband loved this, and so did I. I did have some issues getting the sauce to thicken, so I added a little flour (like someone else did here) and it was perfect. We also didn't quite have enough sauce, so I would agree with other users to double the sauce.

I made this for my husband's birthday.  He LOVED it!!! So did I!  I saved some and gave to my daughter to try.  She loved it, too!  Restaurant quality.  I did as some readers suggested and made more sauce.  Also, used cornstarch mixed in water to thicken a bit.  Was great!

Really good---the cream in it really makes it. I added more butter--like, 6 T. instead of 2. Also, I use boneless chicken thighs, not breasts, in everything including this because chicken thighs are juicier, have more flavor, and are richer in general than chicken breasts. Why everyone has such a phobia about dark meat chicken is beyond me because the taste is superior to white meat.  A few extra calories are not that bad, and the great chefs of the universe will tell you the same thing--they prefer dark meat to breasts. Dark meat won't kill you.

Sauce was VERY VERY bland. and really watery. I followed every step carefully and even looked over it afterward to see if i messed up, but I didn't. 
I definitely won't be making this again. There are way better recipes on here.

I loved this! I'm a college student learning to cook and this was one of my first achievements. I had to make my own heavy cream which was easy and healthier than store bought. Also I used turkey cutlets instead of chicken and substitute the milk for cream to give it a creamier effect. No more pizza for me!

This was pretty tasty.  The only thing stopping me from rating this a 5, is that I found the sauce quite thin and I prefer a thicker sauce with my pasta.  The taste of the sauce was good (I was even drinking it at the end), it just requires being thicker.  Will definitely make again with a thicker sauce.

Loved the sauce!  The chicken didn't have enough flavor for me.  Next time, I will use a rottisserie chicken.  Good recipe!

Just made this tonight for my nephew and husband, both who love pasta. They both really enjoyed it. I do not care for pasta, especially with a creamy sauce, but I actually enjoyed this as well. I gave it four stars (my husband said four, my nephew said 4 1/2 and I thought 4+). I did have to add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce and I also added mushrooms, which were a great addition. Otherwise, I made it exactly as written. I would agree with those who said to make sure the white onions are chopped small.
Thanks for submitting a recipe I (the non pasta lover) will enjoy making! It will go into our rotation!

I thought the flavor was fantastic. However, when I finished it was way too watery for my taste.  Fixed it by making a roux with butter and flour and thickening it up a bit.  Terrific recipe!  I will definitely make it again!!!

So simple but yet so yummy. This dish has become a firm favourite at home! I followed some additional pointers (i.e doubling up on the sauce) but also added a little bit of freshly squeezed lemon juice and left out the milk just cause I like it creamy. Recipe does not disappoint.

This is a keeper.  Should have read the reviews prior to making. Next time I will double the sauce and use chicken tenders as many reviewers suggested. It was enjoyed by all.

This is a really good pasta dish. I used 3/4 of an onion because I was afraid it was going to be too overpowering. I substituted lactose free skim milk for the heavy cream and used 1/2 cup chicken stock instead of a bouillon cube. I put the sauce in the blender to puree it as well. I only used 3 chicken breasts and found even that to be waaaay to much chicken. Because I used milk instead of cream, the sauce needs to be thickened with cornstarch so it will stick to the pasta. Oh, I also omitted the green onions and added extra minced garlic and chicken stock while cooking the chicken. . The calorie count on my was 172  calories per cup. That doesn't include the extra chicken broth I had to add. Figure in the calories of an extra cup of broth and you should have an accurate count.

Not so happy with this.  A just okay chicken tetrazini/white sauce without vegetables or a less than decent alfredo.  (Try the alfredo by Kimber!) The onions are pretty funky in it.  I minced them, but still messed with my mind that the sauce wasn't smooth til I remembered they were in there.  The taste of the onion was fine, just looked like I did something wrong.  I've made alfredo before & this one, yes I know it isn't claiming to be alfredo but, just didn't blend well.  'Had to really beat it to distribute the melted cheese that accumulated in the pot; then, thicken it twice.  I halved the chicken & pasta amount, but used the full sauce recipe.  (Right proportions if you try it).  I'm glad I used up leftover chicken in this.  Just wish someone would eat it.

This is fantastic.   I'm not sure why, but I had plenty of sauce at the end (which surprised me with all the reviews about not having enough sauce).   Maybe people are cooking the sauce down?   I have a similar sauce recipe for another chicken dish and it's really the parmesan that thickens it in the end.   Don't cook it down/reduce it at all.   And use fresh shredded parmesan (not can grated) because it will actually melt and thicken the sauce.   You control the thickness of the sauce with the amount of cheese that you put in.   Start with 1/2 a cup of cheese and work up to the desired thickness.   ABSOLUTELY delicious!!

This was delicious!!! I added some steamed asparagus at the end so that we had our veggies. It would have tasted perfect without it, but since it had butter, cream & cheese, I had to justify it by having a veggie.

This recipe was both quick and easy to prepare. I substitued boneless/skinless chicken thighs for breast meat, which reduced the cooking time. I agree with another commenter that the dish tasts great fresh and as a leftover. As a leftover, the cream absorbs into the noodles, but taste is not lost. Highly recommend.

This was just ok. I used two large chicken breasts, substituted wine for the water, only used heavy cream and no milk due to everyone saying the sauce was too thin. I cooked the sauce for about 15 minutes and it was perfect consistency. I wound up adding salt, pepper and garlic powder to the sauce because it was too bland. And I seasoned the chicken with seasoning salt, pepper and some onion powder. Maybe the onion powder ruined it??? Not only that, but I wish that I hadn't cooked the garlic with the chicken. It wound up burned so I took it out and chopped up more to cook with the onion. I wish I would have took that piece of advice. 

I was so excited about this recipe because some said it was the best recipe on this site. I disagree and won't make it again. Way too much onion, and I used a medium-sized onion. :-(

This recipe is one of the best!  I am very picky about sauce and would never use a jar sauce.  This is top notch!  I used more garlic because I love it and I used 2 cups of heavy cream and skipped the milk because I like rich, thick sauce.  The consistency was perfect.  I think the milk would have made it too runny.  I used about 8 ounces of linguini pasta (half of package) and the amount of sauce was perfect.  As the other reviewers mentioned you would need to double the sauce if you use a whole pkg of pasta.  I think this recipe would serve 8 only if you double the sauce. Great recipe!  Thank you so much for posting it!

Great recipe but it really needed salt. I also added a couple of shakes of cayenne pepper to the sauce to give it a kick. Added chicken broth instead of water and boullion cube. Mixed in some steamed broccoli with the pasta and chicken and that made it perfect!

I breaded the chicken before frying it, but other than that I made the recipe as stated. I didn't care for the bouillon, it made it salty and a bit like sauce from a box. Also I really didn't like how the onions turned out; they made the sauce all lumpy. I'd make again, possibly with a roux to thicken the sauce, and without the onion. (Though I usually love onion!)

This was very tasty... I halved the recipe except for the sauce, since wanted it for 4, not 8. I kept the sauce for 8 based on other reviews that there wasn't enough. I put all the sauce ingredients into a blender and blended it for 30 seconds to incorporate the cheese and onions well, then put it back into the sauce pan to heat it up. It was great. Will put this in my recipe box.

The recipe was totally easy to follow. And followed it to a T. But the recipe really missed the kind of recipe that would make it outstanding. I didn't find this recipe at all "creamy" it was very thin. While it had a plain onion flavor, it could have really used more depths in flavor. After going back over the recipe, this is what I feel should have been done. 1)The chicken really needed to be seasoned well with italian seasoning(basil, oregano,thyme). 2) I would have cut the milk out and replaced with more cream, and 3)I also would have thickened the cream up by cooking it slightly longer to get the right thick creaminess consistancy before adding the parmesan(should have used a shredded instead). I believe that step would enhance the recipe more then just adding the cream, milk, green onions and parmesan at the end and plating the dish. Over all this recipe needs a little bit of changes to make this an outstanding dish that you would could just mouthwater over.

This dish was delicious*!   The asterisk is because I had to make a couple of alterations.  First, I added salt to the chicken and I wanted it to have a little kick to it so I added some cayenne as well.  For the sauce I used half and half to lighten a bit but it would not thicken for me so I added 2 tsp of cornstarch dissolved in some water.  It thickened up nicely after that and my family loved it.  Good eats!

This was excellent.  I added sun dried tomatoes, and mushrooms to the recipe.  However it would go great with capers, broccoli, zuchinni, aparagus, and articokes if you wanted it.  I seasoned the chicken with Mrs. Dash and Basil in addition to garlic.  I also garnished with fresh chopped parsley in the end.  My husband thinks I'm a genius!

This had good flavor but I thought the sauce was too thin.  I used less water but I should have also used less milk.  I added some mozzarella cheese to help thicken it up.  I also added some salt and Italian seasoning.

I made this with boneless skinless chicken thighs. I seasoned the chicken the night before and let it marinate overnight. After reading reviews I added 2 tablespoons of flour after sautéing the onions to help with thickening. I also used chicken broth instead of water and left out the milk. Everyone raved about this dish!

This was really good.  Things I did differently:  used 2 very large breasts, pounded and cut in half.  Used broth, not bouillon cube and water; then because I knew it was enough to have leftovers, I put the chicken in the sauce.  The sauce thickens on standing and I agree with other reviewers that it's so good, you want more.  I will double sauce next time.

I improved the recipe by using chicken thighs as the dark meat is so much more delicious. I omitted the water but not the bouillon (used better than bouillon) to intensify the chicken flavour. I used half+half for health reasons. Used white pepper and Taragon  and some Parsley.

Very nice sauce with ingredients on hand.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and it made plenty for us with some left overs too.  I followed the recipe exactly except using a Swanson Flavor Boost packet of chicken flavor.  I used angel hair pasta (what I had) and it was a restaurant quality meal.  And easy to boot!!

This recipe was good!  I followed the advice of others and made more sauce, I wanted to be able to coat the pasta!  I also didn't have just parmesan, I only had a three cheese blend of parmesan, romano and asiago.  The sauce turned out really good and I'm glad I made more, the amount would not have been enough the way it is.  Next time I will add mushrooms because those would go very well with the sauce!  I'll definitely make this again.

Excellent flavor. This was an easy and fairly quick dish to get together. The sauce was very thin but thickened up as it stood on our plates. I used onion powder instead of fresh onion. My husband raved over this wonderful dish. Thanks.

I too feel the sauce yield was a little low, so I augmented it (more milk, 3 1/2 pints cream, 2 tbsp cornstarch in a splash of cold water). 

In addition I did this:
1. Cut chicken into strips first (didn't have a pan large enough to cook 6 chicken breasts at once); it took 3 batches of strips at a time-worked fine and cooked faster
2. Added fresh ground pepper to the chicken while cooking
3. Used Romano cheese rather than parmesan-just used the whole wedge-proportionate to my increase in cream/milk sauce base
This recipe is 'drop to your knees' good!

I will give the recipe 5 stars based on my family's response ~ They loved it !  There is almost none left and I used a 3 pound bag of frozen chicken breasts, thawed, and doubled the sauce recipe... I also used chicken broth instead of bouillon and water. I grated my own Parmesan, and I had a little fresh rosemary left over from a different recipe so I threw some into the sauce while it was thickening, so I changed the recipe around a bit. Still, my family loved it and it is a good base recipe for tweaking to your taste...
Next time, for me, I will try some salt or something, maybe a bit of crushed red pepper flakes, or add some chopped fresh red and yellow bell pepper to the sauce. I will definitely cut the chicken up before cooking, as I think that will speed up the process without changing things too much.  It was a satisfying pasta dish served with green salad and bread !

This is fantastic! It doesn't say how long to cook after stirring in cream, milk and cheese - if you don't cook it at all you are left with a very thin sauce. I brought it to a boil so it would thicken, and it was perfect.

good basic recipe, but needs a little more spice, some chives, pepper, garlic salt... also the final sause was not very hot due to lack of instructions, probably should put sause in small pot and warm with chicken to draw in some more flavor and have ingredients time to blend to be more flavorful

Yummy flavor!  Few changes: omitted the cream and milk and just used about 3/4 c. of 1/2 and 1/2.  I used a little cornstarch to help thicken it up without adding the extra fat! I also added chopped zucchini for some veggies!  I would definitely add more of the Italian veggies next time!  I would also wait to cook the chicken until you are ready to add it because it dries out quickly!

My husband loved this recipe.  Taking note of previous reviews I seasoned the chicken prior to cooking. The chicken was seasoned with garlic salt and pepper and rubbed in liberally.  I added one finely chopped medium sized jalapeno to the cooking chicken and two minutes later i added the garlic.  The melted butter, jalapeno and garlic combined with the flavours from the chicken made a great base for the onions and mushrooms to absorb (again following suggestions from previous reviews I added some mushrooms to the onions).   I also added a tablespoon of sour cream to the sauce to give it a little extra richness.  To thicken up the sauce i added a little cornstarch which did the trick.  Also i only had dried parmesan so i added it to the sauce gradually tasting the sauce frequently until it tasted good.  I am quessing i put may 1.5 tablespoons of parmesan into the sauce.  Also i used pasta seashells opposed to linguine.

This was wonderful!  Full of flavor.  I used 2 cloves of garlic and then sprinkled Janes Krazy Mixed-up Salt on my chicken breasts with a little extra garlic powder. I only had a mixture of italian cheeses (parmesan, romano, asiago) so I used that.  Like I said, wonderful.  I thought it was a lot like the alfredo sauce from Olive Garden. Just not as creamy.  (I think that was because of the different grated cheeses.)  I will definitely make again!

Very good recipe and also extremely easy to put together but did need some hot pepper flakes and also some fresh parsely (just gives it some extra kick).    It is honestly not fair when someone rates a recipe as wonderful after it is totally changed as the chef wrote it. Thank you chef for a very good , tasty and easy entree.

I have changed this a bit, by alleviating the water, and just using the cream.  Also after the cream heats up, I add the chicken breasts (cooked) then, so they really soak up the sauce, along with the pasta, and let simmer on the stove to incorporate all the sauce goodness!

I'm torn about reviewing this recipe.  At first I made it exactly according to the directions, but found it lacking in flavor and visual appeal.  Then the next day I took the refrigerated leftovers and began my augmentation.  I reheated the sauce and chicken and added shredded Swiss cheese, seasoned salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Once I poured this over the hot linguine I topped it with Parmesan cheese (in addition to what's in the original recipe) and chopped parsley.  I could have tried other ingredients but these were what I had on hand and thought might taste good.  It worked!  I served this the next day to a friend who came over for lunch and he loved it!  Not sure if I'll ever make it again though.

I just used 3 chicken breasts for my husband and I, but kept the sauce ingredients as written - there was plenty of sauce that way.  I added some roasted red peppers and minced the onions, as others had suggested.  The sauce was a little thin, so I dusted some flour on the pasta before adding it to the sauce.  Perfect!  Served with asparagus on the side.  What a wonderful meal - very rich.  Thank you so much  :)

I had to buy a bunch of chicken when my grocery money was less than I needed, so I was looking for something, anything really, to jazz up this fine meat that I was sick to death of eating. While I did add more garlic (my husband is big on the garlic) and doubled the sauce (that would be for me) I didn't change anything other than that. This was lovely and warm and gave me the change I was looking for. I will adjust for personal tastes, but thank you for giving me a wonderful recipe!

Our favorite chicken and pasta dish by far! We don't typically like chicken with pasta, but this was incredible. We will make it again!

The sauce for this recipe was amazing! I didn't change a thing. I think the next time I make this I will add some kind of vegetables like broccoli and mushrooms or maybe red peppers. The sauce was quite thin so I would probably also make a roux to help thicken things up a bit. Flavor wise this recipe is great!

AWESOME! I made this exactly as posted except I used chicken stock rather than water/boullion.
NO leftovers, the family scarfed it down!
Thanks!

My husband and I really liked this dish.  My teenage son that I thought would LOVE it, thought there was too much onion.  I had doubled the recipe and the 2 chopped onions did seem a bit much.  I had tons of leftovers.  Next time I will reduce the onion.

I doubled the sauce recipe like suggested in previous reviews. I would stick with one onion as it came out very onion-y. Also, the sauce was very runny. I will thicken it up the next time I make it. All in all, very tasty!

This recipe was to bland, if I make it again will need to add some spices and use less onions; (to many onions). However the chicken was nice and juicy. The sauce was way to runny.

On the rare night that I dont have to cook for the family, I wanted something a little fancy, but quick and this was it. It was so easy to make with ingredients I already had on hand. I broiled a chicken breast and shared this with my 2 year old, who ate more than I did! I felt it was missing something, but couldnt quite figure out what. I will be making this again.

Supper yummy.  Followed the recipe except I just used all heavy cream insted of milk and added a little corn starch to thicken it up.  I just barley had enough sauce so I would probably double le it next tie but the taste is amazing.

So good. Made it just as recipe suggested but used less chicken (only 3 of us) and it turned out awesome! It didn't thicken very much but I let it cook down for a while and it thickened up nicely. Really tasty though. Yum!

Made this last nite for dinner & it was a hit. I used one onion which I diced fine due to some complaining of lumps in the sauce & sauteed it with minced garlic & green pepper. Salt & pepper the chicken to taste & cooked the chicken. I didn't add the water, I used chicken stock instead of the cube of crushed chicken bouillon, & I cubed the chicken and mixed it in the sauce along with some roasted peppers in olive oil that I had. I bought a loaf of pane bread to go with this delicious dish. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was wonderful.  We found the taste a little bland and added some pepper and oregano to it and it just made the meal.  We also found that we had LOTS of sauce from the recipe.  This is a great recipe and extremely easy to follow and cook.  Highly recommend it to all my friends.

This was delicious!  I used 1.5Lbs of thin sliced chicken tenders, 1/2 of a large sweet onion, substituted the bouillon and water for 1/2 cup of chicken broth, used 2 cups of light cream and to make the sauce thick I whisked together 2Tbls of water with 1  Tbl of flour and whisked into the sauce and cooked until bubbly and thickened.  I seasoned the chicken before cooking with salt, pepper, and mixed Italian seasonings.  I also steamed broccoli in chicken broth and added to the pasta with chicken before topping with the sauce.  I omitted the green onions since I didn't have any and used fresh shredded Parmesan.   cheese.  Will be making this again for sure!!!

this was an amazing recipe! even my dad (who's very picky and rarely compliments my cooking before i ask for his opinion). the only proplem with theis recipe is that it calls for 1 cloce of garlic, i suggest only 1/2 a clove, and also only 1/2 a large onion. also i suggest adding salt to taste. i also substituted heavy cream for cream of mushroom and still turned out great! over all this is still a great recipe!

This was a very good dish. I just did a few things different. I used angel hair pasta in place of and chicken broth in place of water. And I also added Tony Chachere's  when I tossed it. Very good lunch and there will be enough leftover for supper.

Bonus recipe.  I did double the sauce, only used 1/2 an onion and had to add some flour to thicken.  Hubby and I loved it  (kids only ate the chicken which I left seperate).  I will be making this again.

This was so good. In the end I mixed it all together and let the linguine soak up all the sauce. Next time I would definately double the sauce and use maybe just four or five chicken breasts. I thought it was alittle to much chicken. Also added black pepper. Dee-licious!

This is exactly what I was looking for...creamy and delicious.  I did not have heavy cream so I substituted whole milk and butter and it turned out fantastic.  The sauce was a bit runny at first, but thickened up.  I also added basil and used penne pasta b/c that's what I had on hand.  It was really tasty.  The next day the leftovers were even better!

This recipe is good, but you must add your own spices or marinade to the chicken. We followed it exactly and the chicken needs a little flavor or something to spice it up because the sauce will not do it. I lied. We followed it exactly except we added corn starch to thicken the "creamy" sauce. I agree- adding bacon & mushrooms also would've been good.

ADD BACON!  my boyfriend and i added extra garlic and bacon and it made the pasta so much more flavorful and gave it extra texture.  this was definitely restaurant quality food that was cheap and very easy to make.  the only thing we might try next time is to add some spices to the chicken for a little more flavor.  we would definitely make this again!

This is by far one of the best chicken dishes I have ever tried. My whole family really enjoyed it. It is so easy to make and most of the ingrediants are already in the house so its really cheap. Will defenitly be making again...and again. THANKS!!!

We all love this recipe! It's one of my favorites, And is always a hit with guests. I have made it as written and its great! Four and a half stars, easy. But with a few tweaks I've made it edges to 5 stars for my family. First, depending on the size of the chicken breast, 6 may be too many (if you have very large, 3 or 4 is more than enough) I tent the chicken and add any of the juices into the pasta after slicing the chicken. I sauté mushrooms after the chicken before starting the sauce. I use fresh chicken/veggie broth. I have made it with bouillon, and it's good, but I prefer using broth over cubes. I also substitute the green onions with basil. My kiddos won't eat anything with green onion, so at first it was a practical switch, but it turned out to be more delicious with the basil! I also increase the sauce quantity, like many of the reviewers suggest because I toss the linguini in most of the sauce before topping it with the chicken and the remaining sauce. For the pasta, I've used Trader joes spinach and chive linguini!! I think the best version uses that pasta. If you can use the TJs linguini, it becomes 6 star!

I made this for the first time last night (New Years Eve 2007), and my entire family raved about it. The sauce was delicious and very easy to make. I just have a few notes:

1) I put in a total of three cloves of garlic because my family loves the flavor it brings to pasta dishes. If you are a garlic fan, this worked out very well. When you cook the chicken in the garlic & oil, be prepared for the garlic to brown and attach to the chicken. I was a bit concerned, but it worked out very well. The chicken had a delicious garlic flavor, that was wonderful on its own, but got only better when you combined it with the sauce.

2) We added 1/2 cup more of cheese to the sauce. I found that the sauce was a little bland w/ the suggested portion, but your tastes may vary.

All in all it was a great success that we will certainly make again. Total prep/cook time took approx 60 minutes.

Oh, wow!  This was GREAT!  I can't wait til tomorrow so I can eat the leftovers for lunch.  I didn't cook the garlic with the chicken...I was afraid it would burn because my chicken pieces were really big.  So, I cooked it with the onion and it turned out great.  I did add prosciutto ham and sugar snap peas, which were excellent, but I think the recipe would be good without the extras, too!  I used about 13-14 oz of the pasta and it was just the right amount of sauce for us.  Try this one, you won't be disappointed!

This was an excellent recipe to start with. Like the others, I added extra cloves of garlic to the chicken. I also used tenderloins instead of the breasts, just because I prefer that cut.
Also, I did use 2 c. of cream and the equivalent in powdered milk (without the water you would usually add) and simmered for about 15 minutes after adding the cream to make the sauce thicker.
I took another reviewers suggestion as well to add sugar snap peas and some prosciutto. It was a hit! Second helpings and clean dishes all around.

This was pretty good.  I used skinless boneless thighs, and I think it would have been better with chicken breasts.  I just wish it wasn't so fattening!

Can I just say YUM?!  I made this last night and am thinking about making it again tonight.  I did do some adjustments to make it suit my family's taste.  I didn't want the chicken to be too bland so I added cayenne pepper & an italian seasoning blend while it sauted.  I also reduced the milk to 1/2c and the cream to 1c due to other reviews saying it was too soupy.  I think next time I will keep the milk at 3/4c and only reduce the cream to 1c as it was just a tad bit dry.  I also only did 1/2 a large onion, left out the green onions and cut chicken into cubes.  I'm so glad I found this recipe and plan on making it quite often!

This was very good..My hubby liked it and we will be making it again. I used more garlic. The sauce did thicken up after sitting for 10 minutes, no flour needed..I'd double this recipe as it wasn't enough for a lb of linguine in our house. I cooked the green onions in with the other onion by mistake, it still turned out great!! Thanks for the recipe, it is definately a keeper!!!

This was quite delicious.  The flavor was great, my only problem was with the consistency of the sauce.  It was thin and runny.  Once it cooled off, it did thicken up, and began to stick to the linguine nicely.  I'd recommend not serving immediately, to allow for thickening.  Also, my children don't care for onions, so I put broccoli in it instead.  They loved it!  Thanks!

I tried this last week after reading all the great reviews.  Modified it a little, added more garlic, (but think next time I will add a little more and use a little less onion).  I also used half & half and 2% milk.  Served it with angel hair pasta and garlic bread, it was wonderful, my husband loved it!

Like other reviewers I added some sauteed mushroom. I wish I had followed others' advice and added some bell peppers - the sauce is delicious, but very bland to look at!I didn't have chicken boullion cubes so i used canned chicken broth instead. This is simple and tasty. Thanks!

This is good, but I agree with another reviewer who said to make sure to chop the onions very finely, otherwise you will get a weird texture in the sauce.  I thought I had chopped them up enough but evidently not because it still seemed a little off.  Other than that, this recipe is pretty good as is, although it just wasn't my favorite.

Yummy! Looking forward to doing this again. I agree it might be a bit milky so lighten up on the milk if you like a thicker sauce. Flavor was fine.

Loved this recipe!! BOAT FOOD! Added a half cup more of grated parm & two teaspoons unbleached flour to sauce, low heat - it thickens the sauce. If you like super thick sauce, that's the move...

I found this recipe to be really, really bland.  The sauce was very runny & had way too much onion...and I love onions.  I'd definitely take the milk out and add a lot more garlic and some cornstarch to thicken it up.  Like others said, it was not enough for a full box of linguine!  Wouldn't make this recipe again.

Really, really good. I pretty much followed the recipe with a few exceptions. I used four chicken breasts instead of six - which was plenty! Based on other reviews suggesting that the sauce was a little runny, I added 1/2 tsp of flour to thicken the broth mixture and used slightly less milk and cream. I also added frozen peas while the broth was simmering. The added color was nice and it created another level of texture which was nice. When everything was done, I layered the pasta, chicken, cream sauce and topped with a little mozzerella and baked for 10 minutes on 250. The extra step really blended the flavors. The family LOVED it!!

The flavors were there but it was so milky! We read the reviews and we put less water, less milk, let it sit for 30 min, and nothing could recover the watery sauce.

needed more flavor in the sauce and the chicken.  Thinking next time that I will add some cajun spice and maybe roll the chicken in some spices and flour first like another reviewer suggested.  Definitely doubled sauce and it was perfect amount.

very bland I sauted the chicken in red pepper flakes, oregano and  basil and doubled the garlic to give it a little kick. The sauce was runny I ended up using a little corn starch to thicken it. Not sure why the recipe would call for water.  If I make it again I might add some flour and make a loose roux before adding the cream and add some white wine also.

Delicious Pasta! This tastes like a restaurant dish. I omitted the green onions as I didn't have any on hand but added some fresh sliced mushrooms. My husband told me to save the recipe and I will definitely be making it again.

4.5 Stars. I added Red and Green Bell Peppers and Mushrooms, which definitely was a nice touch. I agree with other users about it being to "miky" , Next time Ill use way less, but overall the flavor was excellent.

This recipe was fantastic.  The chicken was tender and the sauce was delicious.  The only change I made was adding salt and pepper to the chicken as it was cooking in the garlic. I'll definitely make this again!

One of the best pasta receipes I have prepared.  I can't say anything bad about it.  I had a lot of sauce left so I froze it and ate it again the following week.  I did add a  half can of cream of mushroom and mixed it with the milk.  I also cut my chicken into bite size pieces.  Can't wait to make it again for a group!

I accidentally grabbed a pint of 1/2 and 1/2 at the grocery store and didn't have time to go back and get the heavy cream so I just used the 1/2 and 1/2 pint and no milk added.  Also used a little extra grated parmesan to thicken up the sauce and put sweet peas in.  Super yummy

I made this for my bf and me a few days ago for lunch.  I used only 3 chix breasts, but kept the original measurements for 8 servings given all the comments about wanting more sauce.  Since I'm lactose intolerant, I used a cashew/almond creme that I got from Whole Foods instead of the heavy cream and milk, and I also used gluten free brown rice pasta bc I'm wheat intolerant.  I forgot the onion, and only added the green onion, which I thought was going to be overpowering.  I also added left over carrots and some zucchini to get rid of stuff in the fridge and for more color. After a little while, the flavor mellowed out, especially the next day.  We both loved it!  A keeper!

DELICIOUS! Followed recipe as stated; just doubled the sauce as per other reviews. It's perfect the way it is and I wouldn't change a thing. Definitely a keeper in my recipe book (well, my virtual one!).

This tasted really good and my family loved it.  But I thought the sauce was way too thin - like broth.  Maybe I did something wrong?  I did double the amount for the sauce as several reviews suggested the original was not enough.  But I added less than double milk since some also said it was too milky.  I will make again, but will try to thicken the sauce.

I saw this recipe on the website and had to make it for dinner.  It was very delicious.  My kids loved it (and they are picky eaters) and we the parents also liked it.  I used half & half instead of heavy cream and milk but didn't miss out on the flavor.  I had also run out of Parmesan-Reggiano so I used my cheap Kraft Parmesan cheese but it tasted fine (more economical, I guess.)  Definitely will make it again.  Thanks!

Skipped the step to saute the chicken in oil first, then slice.   Instead I sauteed diced onion in butter first until tender, then added thin sliced chicken breast strips/sliced mushrooms/garlic to the same skillet and cooked until done.   I added fresh ground pepper, a pinch of crushed red pepper, basil, some Tony Chachere Creole seasoning and used about two teaspoons of chicken boullion granules rather than a boullion cube since I didn't have any, and substituted some dry white wine for the water.

This was a wonderful recipe. I followed the reviews and doubled the sauce and seasoned the chicken before cooking it . I also added fresh mushrooms to it which was just great. I didn't add green onions because i don't like them. I will definitely be making this dish again and again. Thanks for the great recipe.

Pretty good recipe. I just used more milk instead of the heavy cream (I didn't have any) with 1 TBSP cornstarch to thicken it up. I tasted the sauce first, and I wasn't sure if I was going to like this dish, but when I tossed the linguine in the sauce, it was really good.

Absolutely loved this recipe!  The flavour was awesome!  I had been searching for a Chicken Linguine recipe that did not have to bake in oven- DH does not eat casseroles!  I will absolutely be making this dish again.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is really easy and my boyfriend LOVED it. And I quote, "should I make this again?" "yes, this is good...this is REALLY good...". The only thing I would have liked to change is the thickness of the sauce, as it wasn't quite as thick as I like.

I'm not sure what went wrong in my kitchen, but this was definitely not restaurant quality.  Mine turned out like onion soup with chicken.  S

Excellent recipe. The only thing I did was add cornstarch to thicken the sauce.
I will definately add this to my favorites...

The sauce for this recipe is definitely restaurant quality.
I cut the chicken into pieces and sprinkled them with salt, pepper and cayenne as other reviewers suggested then sauteed them in the butter and oil.
When I removed the cooked chicken I cooked the onions alone until almost the end then added the minced garlic so it wouldn't burn.
For the sauce I didn't have heavy cream so I used 1 cup milk, 1 cup half and half, one cup parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of paprika for color with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch for thickening.
On the side I made frozen chopped broccoli for anyone who wanted to add a vegetable to the sauce.  
This is a recipe I'll want to make often.

This was so easy to make. My family and I really enjoyed it. I also added fresh mushrooms to it, and next time I will leave out the milk so it will be a little thicker. Great recipe.

Exceptional recipe.  Thanks to the reviewers for your comments that allowed me to tweak the recipe to bring it to another level.  I sliced the chicken lengthwise and marinated it in a garlic, herb and wine marinade for a few hours.  Followed the recipe (added more garlic.  can never have too much garlic) and it turned out wonderful.

This was pretty good not overly amazing, but i would definetely make it again. I would recommend adding some flour to the sauce to make it thicken a little.  Also, the chicken was slightly bland so i would spice it up with somethign else as its cooking. Also, I usually add a little curry powder at end for a little extra flavor and use tortellini which is AMAZING.

Sauce was great but there wasn't enough, as others have said. The chicken was pretty bland. I would make it again but next time pound the chicken flat first, add salt and pepper to the chicken and double the sauce.

This recipe was wonderful for a new cook.  The instructions were very easy to follow and the meal was delicous.  I made the recipe for 6 servings and it required only 1 clove of garlic.  Next time I will use two.  Also, a generous dash of garlic salt, once the meal is on the plate, makes this meal better than restaraunt quality.  (In my humble opinion)

We loved this recipe. We even ate the leftovers the next day, which we never do. The sauce was just creamy enough, not overly thick and not runny. I did however saute' the chicken in  with a lemon pepper seasoning for an extra kick. This recipe is a keeper!

We loved this recipe! There were som changes I made to it though. While I cooked the onion I added one whole yellow pepper and one whole red pepper for taste and color. the presentation before was not that appeiling. I also am not a fan of runny sauce so I added cornstarch to thicken it. I added about 4 tablespoons of papricka  for flavor. It was awsome

This turned out pretty good with modifications for people trying to eat healthier.  Used half and half in place of heavy cream, 2% or 1% milk and whole wheat pasta.  Added some extra garlic.  The sauce was a little thin so I took some water added with corn starch and mixed into sauce to make it thicker.  I'm sure the original recipe is better but were trying to cut back on the fats when cooking for our grandchildren.  Don't you know the good recipes are also high in Calories and fats.

This dish was great and fairly easy to prepare/serve. Followed the recipe 100% except added some thyme, and discluded the onions and scallions. Very very tasty.

This was delicious! I think that I will only use 1/2 of an onion next time, though. I did as others suggested and reduced the amount of milk and cream - it came out just right. YUM :)

This is a very good recipe. I used leftover baked chicken. Just heated it up and added to the Sauce before pouring over the chicken. It was a little running for me so I took a little jar added flour and some milk shook it up then added to the sauce so that it would be thicker but not lumpy.

Another "5 Star Recipe" from allrecipes.com.  I know I can't have this one every night; it's not exactly lite and healthy, but if you are looking for one that will impress your family and friends, this is it!  I broke down and added a couple of tablespoons of corn starch, though I may not have needed it.  The sauce turned out thicker than even I like--and I do prefer a thick sauce.  I'll refer back to to my notes here when I prepare it again.  And I WILL prepare it again.  What a fantastic main course.  Served with Parmesan Garlic Bread, which is the best garlic bread recipe I've found on this website.

A major hit with my family of SIX!!  I added some spices to the chicken as I cooked it (lots of extra garlic and some salt and pepper). We had left overs from the first night I made this so two nights later added left over pork from a previous dinner, made more sauce and combined the left over pork and the "creamy chicken" left over dinner and served it for dinner again.  Everyone was thrilled.  Two night after that I had Tons of left overs from our previous 3 meals so I made it left over night and let everyone choose which one I would reheat for them.  Everyone chose the creamy chicken/pork!  I guess that was a hit!

We liked this but I think it would be better with marinated chicken or maybe if it was diced up in the sauce.

This was excellent! I substituted 1/2 cup white wine for 1/2 cup water. I also left out the onions; my kids wouldn't have touched it! I had a package of fresh chicken tenders, and it worked great!

I made this using 1/4 cup wine as well, it came out very well.  However, it was a little too creamy, I suggest reducing the parmesan cheese, other than that, just great.

My son won't eat anything good for him, but he really liked this.  I love for things without too many ingredients and the quickness and easiness of it.  This recipe has it all!

So yummy! I added a little nutmeg and some asparagus for some veggies. I also omitted the extra milk as the heavy cream was enough.  Simple and super yummy!

Oh boy was this good. I made the recipe as is and then I made the sauce as a stand alone to go on top of some pork tenderloins I breaded and cooked. Mmm, mmm, good. I'll save this recipe in my book as is and then the sauce as a stand alone. Make it, you won't regret it.

For 2 of us I cut the recipe in half and used only 1 cup of half in half instead. Easy, perfect meal for 2 with enough for a quick lunch the next day.  My husband loved it and he’s not usually an “Alfredo guy”.

i will definitely make again. the flavor was unbelievable. but the sauce was milky, not thick enough for my liking. i'll just cut out the milk entirely. will probably keep the heavy cream as is.

Easy.  Smells great.  Subed spinach in place of green onion for more vegi value.  Different ratio of cream (lower) and milk (higher) because had to adjust for on hand.

Start by heating oil , brown chicken THEN ( about 3 minutes before you're done browning ) add garlic; the idea is to LIGHTLY BROWN the garlic.  Follow stated recipe procedure from there. Out of chicken stock? No problem! Subbing with cream of chicken soup worked for me beautifully--and I didn't have thin sauce issues.

I have made this dish about 5 times now. The best way I have found, so far, is to substitute the heavy cream for a milk/butter combo since once I did not have the cream. INCREDIBLE! I season my chicken with blackening/salt/pepper before saute and I add a lot more garlic (5-6 cloves diced) It's became my favorite go-to easy dinner. Love it!

Great recipe, but like others, not enough sauce and it wasn't thick enough. As I was cooking, I added more cream, more Parmesan, and some flour to thicken. Perfect consistency. It was really good, but when I make it again, (with my alterations), I will add more spice.

This was amazing!! Like everyone else, I made a few small changes, but the advice from other reviewers was spot on. I nearly doubled the sauce by adding 2 1/4 C of cream instead of the amount called for, 1/2 C of chicken broth instead of 1/2 C of water (why not?), and only 1/2 C of milk. I also added a pinch of nutmeg, 1 TB of Rosemary, salt and pepper to taste, and used only 2 chicken breast halves, cut into bite sized pieces and given a nice browning with the onions and 1/4 C of white wine. I did need 2 tsp of cornstarch to thicken the broth, but it was still a great meal.

VERY GOOD. This was very good. I did follow some of the other
suggestions however. I used Swiss cheese because that is what I had. I added snap peas and the prosciutto and I think it made a difference. If I hadn't added the prosciutto I think I would add some cayenne or red pepper flakes. Doubled the sauce
and it was very creamy.

I followed the directions as written for the sauce. Only made 2 pieces of chicken and half package of linguini. It was just us 2, and I read other reviews about wanting extra sauce so I just made the whole thing of sauce. I tossed the noodles in half the sauce and poured the rest on top. It was good. It was lacking in some flavor though. Butter would make it better. I'm not sure what it is but something else was missing. I advise improvising and definitely adding a good amount of butter. I don't think you can really mess it up.

I should have trusted my gut in the amount of chicken.  Way too much chicken for the pasta.  It seemed this recipe was trying to be an alfredo sauce, but did not make it.  It was okay, but not the wonderful flavor you have from an alfredo sauce recipe that I have made before.

It was pretty easy to prepare. The only item I did not have was the green onions, but it looked beautiful. I must admit I did not taste it due to being Lent season and I gave up meat, but my husband and daughter raved about it. I will be making this again after Easter for me!

Food from heaven. I adjusted the proportions a bit as I was only cooking for two. I made more sauce, tho, because many reviewers said there wasn't enough. I undercooked the breasts a little and then covered them with foil to finish cooking while I was making the sauce. I didn't want them to be dry. It was the best new recipe I've tried in ages. Next time I might add some diced seeded tomato mostly for color, but OMG was this ever good as is.

It didn't have that much flavor. Needed an extra something but not sure what. I won't be making it again.

My whole family (4 kids ranging from 11 to 2 ) ate this recipe and said how good it was ! I did all the cooking in a cast iron skillet and that brought a really tasty flavor to the sauce . I think some mushroom and lemon would be great changeup editions.

This was very good.  As per other suggestions, I doubled the sauce.  Next time I will add some crumbled bacon and mushrooms.  It would also be good using shrimp instead of chicken.  This would be a great dish for company.

Very tasty and easy to make.  The leftovers are a BIG hit with my family as well!  I like to add sliced portobellos occasionally to change it up.

Amazing recipe! I did change it slightly however, I took out the chicken and the pasta and instead of 2 tablespoons of butter I added 4 cups of melted butter and added 1 cup of oil not 1 tbsp ( bacon fat instead of olive oil ). It was slightly soupy but my family absolutely loved it. Also the Parmesan was a little much, I think next time I'll just add 1 cup sliced hot dogs.

Fantastic! I used sour cream in place of the heavy cream. I also used boneless,skinless chicken thighs only because they were cheaper.

Very good and quick. I couldn't get the texture to be smooth.  I added a little cornstarch and water to thicken a little more.  I left out the chicken and used it as a side with ham steaks. I will definitely make again.

LOVE this recipe and so does the hubby. Although, i recommend the chicken be made in one pan, sauce in another and pasta cooking in the side BUT start the sauce first then make the chicken and pasta at the same time. The way the recipe has it, by the time your sauce is done, the pasta and chicken are cold and needs to reheated in microwave :( but seriously delicious though!

This recipe tasted phenomenal. I made a mistake and didn't get heavy cream at the store, so I substituted the heavy cream AND milk for 2 cups of half and half. Definitely not doing that again. the sauce came out waaaaaaay too watery. Barring my error, it tasted like a 5 star recipe, and hopefully next time I make it I'll remember the heavy cream haha

This was a great dish and I agree that it is restuarant quality. As one of the other members wrote I also found that the sauce was not thick enough so I added more cream and also a little flour. The only thing I would change is the chicken itself. Maybe if it were baked? or breaded? Anyhow GREAT RECIPE!

This is my first review on the site, even though I've been using it now for over a year.  It was just so great that it finally got me started!  This was simple and so delicious!  I've never made Alfredo sauce from scratch before and this to me was a sort of a modified chicken Alfredo sauce that gave me the confidence to try it out.  Even re-heated for lunches it was fantastic right to the very end, I ate every single bit and plan to make it again soon.   The changes that I made were the following:  After reading that most thought there wasn't enough sauce, I used 2 pieces of chicken and the same sauce amount, about 1/2 box of angel hair.  This was enough for one person to eat with just enough leftovers and the perfect amount of sauce.  I used fresh parsley and basil when sauteing the chicken.  Mostly because I have the herbs and I add them to just about everything now :)  I bought shredded Parmesan, Romano and Asiago cheeses.  It was hard to get the shredded cheese melted right, so next time I will probably use grated or heat it longer.  I was afraid of burning the sauce but ended up with chunks of cheese later once it had been in the fridge.  Would recommend this recipe to anyone!

This recipe is restaurant quality, it's so delicious. The only thing I did different was to double the sauce and then I let the chicken simmer in the sauce for about 15 more minutes to catch the flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

Incredible.  I did do 1 1/2 sauce recipe and it was still a little much.  I think the pasta would be drowning in sauce if you doubled it.  I also added a little cornstarch to thicken it.  I roasted 6 cloves of garlic for 20 minutes and smashed them and added them to the sauce.  Great recipe.

This is a great recipe! I've tried it and I've loved it, and so did my boyfriend. I've made this a couple of times already and will again in the future. Again, i followed alternate cream instructions and used chicken thighs instead of breasts. But, bravo! Easy and delicious!

I made this dish in hopes of impressing a new boyfriend....and did it ever!!! This was definitely a restaurant quality recipe and super easy too. I am not a huge fan of onion so my spin on the recipe was to use 1/4 of the onion and add sun dried tomatoes and portobella mushrooms into the sauce. The mushrooms and tomatoes added another dimension to the already delicious sauce, also making it more colorful and boosting the wow factor on the plate presentation. I am just learning to become a better cook, and this dish was easy and impressive at the same time. I would highly recommend it.

looking at the ingredients list, i couldn't see how this recipe was getting rave reviews. i tried it anyway, and i did like it! it needed a little more flavor, in my opinion. my husband had already had dinner but started eating off my plate anyway, he liked it so much. next time, i'm adding paprika like in the picture.

The recipe is absolutely beloved. Though the results of the dish didn't look much the same according to the current photos on display. The cream had a more fluid texture right after being finished in the saucepan, and also I sliced the chicken breasts in smaller pieces. I also added sliced mushrooms into the cream that was being cooked, and the green onions were diced into miniature circles. It was long after a few cooks of the recipe, but it was definitely well worth it.

Excellent recipe, really a restaurant style recipe. I used the sauce with meatballs the next day and it was soo good. I made french bread from this site and it went beautifully with the meal. This meal is a keeper for sure!

OMG...SOOOOOOOOOOOOO delicious, straight off of a restaurant table. I used exact ingredients but for the chicken bouillon - I only had veg broth and the dish was excellent so I don't think it did any harm. Also, based on previous reviews about not having enough sauce, I added a bit more cream, broth and milk but in the end I had too much sauce so next time, I think I will stick to the recipe. Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe that we will be using again.  P.S. My 4 kids (all aged 5 and under) loved this meal too! :)

This recipe was delicious and easy! I didn't add green onions because I didn't have any. I also added some white wine. I would suggest possibly adding a bit more milk or other wet ingredient as the sauce can come out a bit thick.

Really really great......only change I made was I added about a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken.  However....reheating it makes it thicker anyway, so if you will have leftovers, maybe just thicken what you'll be using for that meal! Delish!

This is a great recipe with a lot of possibilities. Skip the chicken and add mushrooms & bacon for a very earthy, winter meal. Sauce goes great with gnocchi.

This is a delicious meal.  I have been making somewhat the same recipe for years with a few alterations.  It is called fettuccini Alfredo.  I added a bit more garlic than asked for, but that is simply a matter of taste.  Thanks for sharing.  Definitely a keeper. Easily worth five stars.

This was incredibly tasty.  Let me say... I am a typical guy. Don't usually cook.  But, have been experimenting a lot recently learning to cook. My girlfriend and I loved this dish! The only thing I did differently was added cooked and drained spinach to the top of the linguine on the plate before placing the chicken and pouring the sauce over the dish. It sounds weird, but tasted great.  Made for an interesting presentation, as well.

Without any changes I would give this 4 stars.  Very very runny sauce.  With a bit of corn starch I thickened it up and would rate it a 5.

This was pretty good - it was a bit of a different taste than the usual pasta recipes, but that isn't a bad thing.  It is time consuming, but it smelled awesome as it cooked.  I cut the chicken into chunks to make it easier to handle and to eat.  Will make again!

Definitely a keeper!! I highly recommend this one. I had to thicken my sauce slightly w/corn starch because I didn't have heavy cream. I had subbed half & half. Still wonderful.

I had multiple requests for this recipe after I made it and left the leftovers at my sister in-laws and she fed it to some of her friends.  It was easy enough to assemble at the beginning of the week (I added blanched fresh cauliflower) and toss together once I cooked the noodles.

I have been making this basic recipe for a while now. When i really want to "spice" it up, i add cajun seasoning to the chicken.

This was really good but I have only given it a 4 as I would have liked the sauce a little thicker.  Next time I will add cornflour.  But the flavour was excellent and enjoyed by all.

Pretty good.  Next time I think I will season the chicken more, it was a little bland just cooked with garlic.  The sauce was good and overall it was good.

This is such a delicious pasta dish!  I make it for my boyfriend at least once every two weeks.  I prefer to use the Kraft grated parmesan rather than fresh parmesan. The fresh made the sauce almost stringy, and the taste was not that great.  Overall, this ones definately a keeper.

Tasty sauce although I did alter the milk - I used l/2 cup and it did thicken nicely.  I did not add the cheese to the sauce and it was still thick enough.  I let the sauce sit for twenty minutes. I would make this again with shrimp.

This is a great dish.  I scaled it down to 4 servings, but all I changed was: 4 chicken breasts, less linguine, 3/4 of the onion, I used chicken broth (instead of bouillon and water), 1 cup cream, and about 1/2 cup milk.  I also added 3 cloves garlic, instead of just 1. I had to let this simmer for about 10 or 15 more minutes after adding the cream/milk/parmesan so it could thicken.  I put the cooked chicken back in the sauce at the end and then served.  It turned out wonderful. Thanks!

The biggest complaint on here is that this turns out runny, so I mixed in a bit of cornstarch dissolved in milk and it turned out perfectly thick and creamy. I also added red & green bell peppers and then cut up the chicken and coated it in a mixture of flour-eggs- breadcrumbs and fried it up in the pan. This recipe was delicious!!

Sauce was runny, not creamy, but overall tasted very good!  When putting leftovers away (which were not many!) the sauce was thicker, so maybe just need to let it stand longer.  Thanks!

Excellent flavor!  I would give it 5 stars but I had to use the ole' flour/water thickener trick.  Not a big deal.  My husband and I thought that it was so good we would put it on our list of "company food"!  I also added garlic, and sprinkled the chicken with some Tony Cachere.  Thumbs way up!!

1st time I made it, it came out too "soupy." 2nd time too creamy. The taste was excellent, and I'll definitely try to make this again- hopefully with a happy medium.

This did not come out at all creamy, although it tasted fine. Too much work for the end product.

This was totally awesome... it worked perfect for a romantic candlelight dinner for two (scaled down of course). Served it with hot italian bread... a real winner!!!

This recipe is really good as is.  But I think it could even be better with a few additions.  It almost tastes like something is missing.  I think next time I'll try adding some broccoli and mushrooms or I might try adding some cajun seasoning to the chicken and toss in some fresh, chopped tomatoes.  Overall, this is a very good basic recipe.  Very easy too!

This was sooooooo delicious! The sauce is rich and the chicken is good. I made this with galic bread. My whole family loved it! This may be my favorite dish now.

We all fought for the leftovers.  I left out the spring onions since noone likes them and it was still yummy!

This was wonderful!  My son, who loves creamy pasta dishes, absolutely loved this - he is quite a picky eater.  I added an extra garlic clove and instead of heavy cream and milk, I used half & half to cut down on the fat/calories -- the consistency was perfect and the flavor awesome.   added a little salt to taste.

This recipe is delicious.  We are a family of five and we all love it.  I usually have to make extra noodles cause everyone wants in on seconds.  I recommend this recipe to everyone who loves pasta.

Had a great taste.  My sauce was very runny, not thick at all, but the overall taste was great!
