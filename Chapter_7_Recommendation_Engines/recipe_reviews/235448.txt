Great comfort food - easy and quick recipe to put together.  We add the shredded cheese into the meat/onion mixture, and skip the tomato, but still delicious!  Kids eat the whole pie - no leftovers!

Making recipe with a bit more hamburg so added 1/2 C bisquit, 1/2 C milk and another onion. To make it a full meal putting a few canned diced tomato's, a  can of corn & a can of green beans to the beef, both drained. Added a bit more seasoning to beef also. Used 9 X 13 pan rather than pie pan so cooked about 35 min. instead of 25 . After it set put mixed shredded cheese & cheddar, then added 1 sliced tomato (since I had already put some in mixture) and parsley flakes for color.It was good but really too dense...won't put as much stuff in again.
Had a little batter left so baked it with sliced banana (one I had that was starting to turn brown, cinnamon, and a touch of honey...served with a bit of whipped cream....it was good dessert.

Doubled the cheese as you can't have too much IMHO.

I cut up a pound of bacon, cooked it up and removed from pan.  Added the hamburger and cooked it then finished it as directed.  Yummy

Simple and easy.  I added bacon to it and it was a hit.  Will keep this around as a regular.

I loved this! I made this adding crumbled bacon (as suggested by others), mushrooms  and extra cheese before adding the bisquick on top.

I did not like this recipe.  It started out wonderful, I was drooling when cooking the ground beef and onion, but it went downhill from there.  I used the size pan it said to use, and I did the right measurements, but when I put it in the pan and onto a baking sheet, it spilled everywhere.  I cooked it for an extra 10 minutes and it was still not 100% cooked (Bisquik), but I was starving and needed to eat. My husband and I did no like it, we had Grilled Cheese sandwiches instead.  I am glad I tried it though.

Would be better if tomato was diced and mixed with ground beef and onion mixture after frying

I was disappointed.  I'm going to look for the original recipe.  Pretty sure I still have it.

Sorry but this did not work for me. It tasted so eggy it was like a quiche. The bottom never set up either. The top was ok. Waste of ingredients.

1) Turned out great, even though I forgot the eggs and had to put them on top and stir them in.  Put the cheese in the pie instead of on top. Didn't use tomatoes as we don't all like them. Will definitely make again.  I love these impossible pie recipes.

2)  Used ground turkey and added Habernaro and Asiago cheeses. Delicious.
