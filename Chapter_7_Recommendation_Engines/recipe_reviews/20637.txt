Are you sure it's 1/2 ounce of bitters? Because it was uh quite...bitter! So much so that I had to throw out the drink. And I'm not one who usually goes for sweet drinks. Maybe with a few drops of bitters?

Too much bitters. I'm glad I followed my instinct and added the bitters to taste instead of just pouring the stated amount.
