I loved this recipe - definitely going to be a go-to for the summer. I did sub cilantro for the mint and served with some grilled shrimp - so good!

I liked the combination of veggies and flavors in this dish! Next time I would probably halve the couscous or double the veggies, just because I'm a big fan of the green stuff. Thank you! :)

Ok so I used all the ingredients to the T, but preparations were done differently.  I cooked pearl couscous in sauce pan with broth.  Then microwaved and strained the peas.   I sauteed onion, jalapeno, and spices in skillet for 3 minutes then added sliced asparagus.  Cooked until asparagus was done to our taste at which I tossed in peas and couscous couscous.  Mixed it all up in the skillet for a moment, and then served.  We tried the mint, but picked it off and added parmesan cheese.  I think the flavor would be pretty much the same since I used all the ingredients except the mint.  Mint was just weird for us.  Will make this again just the way I did.  We really liked the flavor.

Loved this dish!  We'd give it 10 stars if we could!  I only had 1 1/2 cups of couscous, so I cooked a box of Near East brand Quinoa and Brown rice and added that with the hot broth.  Also, I didn't cook any of the vegetables, just added them with the boiling broth and let it all sit.  Sooooo good.  The mint really added a nice touch.

This was a great recipe and can be customized in so many ways.  I read one review where someone served it with grilled shrimp.  That sounds great. I made it just the way the recipe called for and thought it was great just as is.  I served it as a side dish with oven fried chicken.  I am thinking that next time I might make it with chick peas for a protein rich, vegetarian main dish.  Overall a great recipe.

Tip: Mushroom stock is SOOO much tastier than Vegetable stock. 

This is a wonderful recipe you can adjust to your taste. I usually use whatever herbs or veggies I have around at the time. I will often trade the mint, for basil, cilantro or parsley, depending on what is fresh in my garden. I will also use any vegis in my refrigerator that are leftover from previous meals..Carrots, zucchini, green beans etc. 

You can't add to many vegetables if they are diced small. I almost prefer to have a half vegis to half pearl couscous in the end. Is a wonderful accompaniment to shrimp, fish, chicken or vegetarian alternative meats.

I have made this recipe over a dozen times now because my family and I love it. It is a simple, healthy option which we use for a main dish, not a side dish. I do make a yogurt, cucumber, cumin, and mint sauce to go with it because the couscous can be a bit grainy, but don't let that take away from you trying it by itself. Also, there is a video that goes with this recipe that I love to watch each time because it is humorous.

We enjoyed this dish. However, I added quite a bit more vegetable stock/broth when it was about time to serve because it seemed to need it.
  
We didn't put the mint in because I'm not sure we would care for that. I put jalapenos in half of it; my husband would like that kind of kick, but not me. Certainly a hearty and healthy dish.

I really liked it, specifically the ease of preparation. My first time cooking couscous! And I love the veggies in it. I will definitely do this again but, following the suggestion of another reviewer, add more veggies or reduce the couscous. Also need to experiment with spices. New to cooking, so it's really no wonder that it wasn't perfect for me the first time around. Thanks for such a great recipe!!

I had to add addition vegetable broth as it was way to dry.  Once done all was well especially the second day.  Followed the recipe without exception.  Next time I’m going to add a bit of curry powder to give it a little more zip in flavor.

I have made this several times & love it!!!  If you’re making it for 2 people, I would definitely consider cutting the amount of couscous in half.  It will be plenty, plus leftovers!  I added a few ingredients, which I think really elevated the recipe- lemon-pepper, artichoke hearts, and shaved Parmesan cheese. Yum!

We lighten up on the jalapeno,  but otherwise stuck to the original recipe.  It was a hit, even with my picky kid who turns her nose up at green veggies.  I had it the next day cold with a poached egg on top, yum!

sideI have never tried couscous before and I looooove it.
This side dish was perfection next to the peposa beef.
It added a little fiery kick that everyone enjoyed.
It wasn't so overwhelming that you couldn't taste anything yet it was definitely strong enough that you knew it was there.
We will eat it again, I look forward to making couscous more often.
Thanks Chef John!!

One of the best quick dinners you could make. I used zucchini instead of asparagus because that’s what the store had available and tossed some pan fried scallops on top. Easy winner.

I doubled the recipe. And I used about 2 pounds of salmon. ( this makes about six servings).  I baked it  with coconut oil butter on top of the fillets , smoked Paprika , Cayenne, garlic salt, and black pepper. I baked it for about 12 minutes. Shredded the salmon. Put lemon juice over shredded fish.  set that aside . I used two boxes of couscous. I did not use jalapeño. I used dried mint instead of fresh mInt.  I also added dried cilantro.  I did follow the same cooking method for broth/couscous. I added the fish at the very end and did a light  stir.

I can't eat  any form  of onion so I had to leave that out and I didn't have any asparagus, but I did put in the peas and added red pepper.  It was very good!  Will make it again but with asparagus.

This was really good. I didn’t have asparagus but did have edamame and added that instead. I followed the recipe exactly and was surprised that you left the couscous in the bowl I have never prepared it that way and then realized that is what the recipe says to do on the box!!  Thank you for educating me as well. It was loved by all. Even tho kiddos. Thank you for a flavorful recipe that is quick, easy and most imp the kids will eat.

This was quite a tasty recipe. I gave it 4 instead of five stars simply because this made A LOT of couscous. Seriously, this was more like 10-12 servings instead if 6.  I'm ok with that though as I plan to reinvent the leftovers as main dish lunches with legumes and tuna and such mixed in.

With the broth I used, I didn't have to add any salt - the dish was flavourful and I can't believe how fast and easy it was.  Next time, I will try it with miniature baby corn instead of asparagus.  This recipe is so forgiving that you can try it with your favourite  vegetables!

I made this to go with honey mustard chicken and everyone loved it....even the kiddo's! I used roasted garlic olive oil and added some feta cheese to the final dish and the end result was absolutely delicious!

Loved the flavor and the color of this dish. We used Israeli Couscous, I would recommend using a smaller couscous for this dish, though.

Anyone made it with acini de Pepe?  I did and was good, but wondering if it was a little too starchy?

Made no changes, followed recipe to a T; very easy and tasty.  Next time I'll omit the spicy  pepper, but that's just my preference.

I really liked this recipe but I don't really like jalapeños. I left them out so of course it was a little bland. I added some canned fire roasted diced tomato which gave a nice punch. I'll definitely try this again with even more veggies!

This has everything I like in an easy side dish.  Flavor, crunch, speed, nutrition.  I made it exactly as written, although I'm sure I added more quantities of all vegetables.  I couldn't have added even more.  LIke a high ratio of vegetables to the couscous.  Seasoning is just enough.  If you don't like heat, careful with jalapeno and cayenne, but for me, it was perfect.  The vegetables are just crunchy enough also.  Yum!

I followed one of the suggestions and used a box of Near East brand Quinoa and Brown Rice which I had in my cupboard. I added onions and frozen peas which I added Just before the mixture  was finished cooking. Delicious.

this was so awesome!  i added extra olive oil and extra lemon at the end to make it more like a "salad".. didn't have fresh mint so used cilantro instead and chicken broth for the veggie stock.. can't wait to make this for bf and his daughter.. ty so much for the recipe
