Liked this very much.  Used two cans cream of chicken soup, and since I didn't have evaporated milk I used skim milk instead.  Probably used more cheddar than the recipe called for, and topped it with bread crumbs as well.  Initially I was afraid the spaghetti would get dried out, but was pleasantly surprised to serve an incredibly creamy, yummy and FILLING main dish.  Talk about comfort food!  This was very tasty and very creamy, but not sickening like an alfredo sauce.  My husband and son liked it a lot as well.  Good recipe, Mrs. Leonard!

I've made this twice and it's been a hit both times. Did it with penne pasta and added garlic and oregano.  Love the penne instead. Heartier!

I gave this five stars because I believe that it would be wonderful as written. The changes I made for my taste: I sautéed sliced mushrooms and garlic with the onions in real butter. I also mixed in a little bit of sliced fresh spinach and oregano as well as mixing a little bit of breadcrumbs with the cheese on top before putting it in the oven.  I doubled the recipe because I was cooking for a few more people.  It was so tasty! I have made this recipe before with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.

We found this to be good but bland.  Chicken tetrazzini typically has mushrooms in it and I was tempted to put in some sliced fresh button mushrooms but wanted to stick close to the recipe at least the first time through.  I'm not sure what else would perk up the taste of this but it was needing something.  I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x9" pan for 30 minutes.

I made it but didn't use the celery salt or evaporated milk. I also used an extra can of cream of chicken and about 3 tsp of sour cream and black pepper. My kids loved it and so did my very picky husband! Ate this with a side of corn.

So good!!! Only thing I changed is that I didn't have evaporated milk so I used 1 cup whole milk & one half cup half & half mixed together. Ended up wonderful. My husband loved it too!

This was great. My students loved it and so do I.  The soup and evaporated milk prevent the sauce from being lumpy.  I also discovered that I could make a wonderful, creamy, mac and cheese by using cheddar cheese soup and 4 ounces of cheddar jack cheese.

Easy and delicious!  I used rotisserie chicken as a shortcut and it worked brilliantly!  My very picky 9 year old gobbled it up. I left out the onions for her and it was still great. Next time we’re going to add bacon!

Loved it and will make it again! This is a very easy and tasty recipe. I did add a little more onion for flavor. I froze half of it but won’t know about how it freezes for a while.

Really good dinner with leftovers.  I used whole grain pasta and exchanged olive oil for the margarine because I’m trying to eat healthier, but was still really good.

This is an awesome, easy, and quick recipe.  It is pretty much foolproof, even for noob like me.  I used rotisserie chicken for the chicken and seasoned to taste.  I think next time (and there will definitely be a next time!) I will cover the dish for the first 30 minutes or so because the cheese on top got hard and dried out baking that long .  Still tasted great!

For all the people who complain about a dish being "bland" on this recipe and others, it is kind of an unwritten rule that you are to adjust the seasoning of the dish to your taste.  Recipes are written bland because it is easier to fix a bland dish than one that is too salty or spicy.    The recipe gives you a general guide to the proportions and you are to adjust it to your liking.  Use your own tastebuds as a guide.

This was a little bland, although the kids and hubby liked it.  I used ham instead of chicken, used rotini pasta, and added some corn, peas and cooked carrots for some color and to have veggies in the dish.  I cooked some minced garlic with the onions and added oregano to the sauce .  I used cream of chicken soup and a can of condensed milk as the recipe called for.   I will likely make this again for the kids as they gobbled it down, but time I would try to figure out a way to add more flavor.  The ham part was delicious, the rest was just meh.

I made this recipe with penne pasta. I also used half and half since I didn’t have evaporated milk. Wonderful recipe! It was a great way to use up the extra rotisserie chicken.

This is a great creamy dish. Perfect for family or taking to someone who is sick and  needs something comforting. I made a second batch and added a drained can of Rotelle to spice it up for  our family.

This dish got some great reviews from my teens!  They declared that they like this better than regular spaghetti :)  ....I tried this recipe as I was looking for a creative way to use a large amount of left-over spaghetti, and this worked excellently!  Because the spaghetti was left-over, it was already covered in a light amount of marinara sauce; this turned out to blend with the other flavors very well.  It did mean that I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, as I thought it would blend better.  I also used garlic salt (instead of celery salt), again to blend well with the marinara flavor.  I added extra cheese, using a full 2 cups inside, as well as the one cup on top, and covered everything in bread crumbs so I didn't get the burnt-cheese look from everyone's pictures.  I will definitely keep this recipe on hand,  and would recommend it to anyone who has a large amount of left-over pasta to use.  (I really don't think that the shape would matter.)  ADDENDUM: Tonight I tried this recipe slightly differently: The author suggested that the recipe could be used very well with left-over holiday turkey, and I would like to say that it is excellent this way!  I made the recipe pretty much as written, just substituting the turkey, except that I still do like to use 2 cups of cheese inside!  A topping idea for everyone: Again because I had some left-over from holiday meals, I decided to sprinkle French's Crispy Fried Onion Rings on top.  (A half-can covers spar

Fantastic. I tweaked this just a little and it's my favorite Tetrazzini that I've tried by far. While grilling the onion, grill a green bell pepper with it, also cut up a small tomato to add (to bake, not grill) and I used cream of mushroom instead of chicken. Perfect blend of flavors!

This was simple and good. I may have added too much pasta (my box was 8 oz and I tried to half it but may have added too much) since the juice disappeared after baking. Note to self: add less pasta next time!! This would be good with canned tuna as well.

Had some left over chicken breast that were cooked in slow cooker over night on low with only some seasoned salt and butter. Found this recipe and followed as written. Very good. Great way to use up the leftovers. Will definitely make again.

I added about 3 cups of fresh spinach and a dozen medium sized mushrooms. Instead of cream of chicken, I used cream of mushroom. Next time, I will probably use penne.

Overall it was very good. Ive made it both with ad without the chicken, and I found to add more flavour to pre season the chicken before it gets cooked to add extra flavour. I wish I coukd tell you what I used, but I never use the same seasoning twice.

Made this tonight. Everyone loved it. Didn't have celery salt on hand. Added a little poultry seasoning to the mixture and topped the casserole with some French fried onions for the last ten minutes just because my family likes them as a casserole topping.  No leftovers ..I did good !  Thank you for this recipe. I will definitely make again soon.

Nice, but it did come out somewhat bland. I added fire roasted tomatoes, but I don't think it was the right flavor to add.

Doubling the amount of pasta, I used 2 cans of  cream of chicken. I threw in about 1/8 cup of dehydrated diced onions., 3  (12 oz) cans of chicken (Something left over from my "Emergency" supplies) , one can of Corn, one 12 oz package of Broccoli pepper and about 2 cups of cheese to mix with the dish. I cooked it for 30 minutes at 350. I pulled it out and topped it off with about 3 more cups of shredded cheese and baked it at 400 for about 15 minutes until the cheese got lightly browned. Most recipes are guides and starters for me, based on whatever is in the cabinet and freezer. If I don't have the ingredient, I usually just substitute or omit as it seems appropriate. One of these days I'll start using a measuring cup as well ;) This turned out well and will use it again :D

I made this dish for my fiancee and I, and it turned out great! I added mozzarella cheese in with the cheddar (in the mixture as well as the topping). I also sauteed my chicken, seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and seasoned salt before I added it in with the mixture ( i also seasoned my mixture with the same seasonings to prevent blandness). And I baked it on 300 instead of 350. Other then that I stuck to the recipe exactly and it turned out great.

I love chicken so I added a layer of it on top then added the Cheddar. For a kick I sprinkled some paprika on top of the Cheddar. In the mix I did add sauteed mushrooms for Iron! yummy!

This turned out great!  I added fresh broccoli and garlic in with the onions and only used the cheese on top and even my Mom ( who is not a big fan of meat, including chicken) thought it was quite good.

This was an easy dish to make.  I did add 1 small can of mushrooms (drained) and 1 pkg of Lipton Onion Soup.  Will keep this recipe handy.  Since there are only 2 in the family, I halved the recipe and it worked great.
