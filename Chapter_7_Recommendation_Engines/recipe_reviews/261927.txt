These were delicious, and they all got eaten up at a family gathering for Christmas.  I even made a few careless mistakes due to reading the recipe in a hurry and not following directions precisely, which I now know would have made them even better.  First of all, I used shredded cheddar instead of sliced, which was really DUMB since as soon as I sliced the roll, the shredded cheese came flying out and I had to scoop it up and set it on the top of the pinwheels once I laid them out on the cookie sheet.  Because of the cheese falling out, there were holes in some of the pinwheels which I filled by dumping more cheese on top, so that didn't turn out too badly.  However, I put 2 pans in at a time and the top pan was a little too close to the top of the oven, and the cheese browned up more than I wanted it to, so follow the directions and keep the pans on the CENTER rack unless you like browner, crustier cheese (I don't).  This recipe is simple, easy, and tasty, which is exactly what I needed and even with my mistakes, the pinwheels were gobbled up.

I wasnâ€™t all that impressed with these. They were easy to make but they seemed like they were missing something
