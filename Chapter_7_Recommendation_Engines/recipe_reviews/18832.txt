This is a very delicious dish. I have made it twice. The first time I made it, I followed the instructions and layered the squash, zuchinni, onion, and tomatoes. Then I read the "pats of butter between each layer" part. Too late to do that. So the second time I made this I kept that in mind. I also did not slice the zuchinni lenthwise the second time, and it was much easier to eat with them sliced as regular slices.

I cut way down on the cheese and used no butter, and this still turned out delicious. I'm not even really a fan of zucchini - I made it for my husband as he likes it - and now I finally like zucchini, too! I also recommend using a can of stewed tomatoes in addition to one fresh tomato. It's a very nice blend of veggie flavors.

Absolutely fabulous!!  My husband and I made this dish with the veggies we picked up from the farmer's market.  We had to substitute a few items like sweet onion rather than Vidalia and Cheddar instead of Romano.  We sprinkled some bread crumbs on top for a little crunch and it turned out wonderfully!!

A few things, this recipe yields far more than 5 servings, as I ended up having to go to a second casserole dish. Also, do not cover it as the juices won't evaporate and therefore it will be really watery when you get ready to serve it. Also, this isn't really ideal for a vegetarian as it is really difficult to call a serving of this a meal, it's more of a side dish. 

With that being said, it was simple to make, and was tastey. I just needed to bake it again without it being covered so that I could get rid of some juices. It really did taste great. In the future if I make it I'll make it with rice on the bottom.

Very yummy!  I made a few changes for our family's taste.  I used Mozzarella cheese instead of Ricotta, used half the amount of butter and sprinkled garlic powder on each layer.  I save the leftover juice and use it as a soup base or steam my other veggies in it.

YUCK!  I too used all fresh vegetables from my garden but found this disgusting.  It was way too watery, even though I used 1/2 the butter recommended.  It was bland and the cheese clumped together in big gooey masses. And not gooey in a good way like a gooey brownie.

The adults in my family loved this recipes.  I was able to use our own home grown squash,zucchini,onion, and tomatoes.  The mixtures of favor when you take a bite is wonderful.

This was delicious!  I was concerned that there would not be much flavor because of the few ingredients, but it was just the right amount of flavoring.  A great way to get rid of fresh summer vegetables!

We loved this recipe.  I substituted the romano cheese with Asiago and it was delicious.  I also sprinkeld some bread crumbs on the top for a little more texture.

I make this as well except I don't add cheese until after it's out of the oven.  It is watery because of the veggies, just drain water off, top with your choice of cheese, I use velveeta because it's creamier.  Take back to oven until cheese is melted.

I'm a vegetarian and I'm always looking to turn side dishes into meals.  To turn this dish into a meal I chopped the zuchhini and squash up into little pieces, added sweet onion, peas, and Quorn brand meatless "chicken" chunks and covered with cheddar cheese and bread crumbs. It was so delicious and moist from all the water already in the squash and zuchhini I didn't need to add any butter! And it was so flavorful I really didn't need any salt or pepper. One of my veggie favorites!!!

This was pretty good, although it tasted a little bland to me.  I made a few changes to the original recipe (eliminated the butter, used asiago cheese instead of romano, substituted white onion for the vidalia, and added canned tomatoes along with the fresh ones)...maybe it would have been better if I hadn't changed so many things.

Truly a family favorite! I made some changes: I add different veggies every time I make this meal, depending on what I have in stock (sometimes I add mushrooms, eggplant, ect). Also, I think the key to the wonderful flavor is that I add fresh basil leaves and layer them across on top of the onion. I also sprinkle red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and ground pepper to add to the taste. I then pour pasta sauce all over and sprinkle a bit of mozzarella on top. To me, this is like a delicious vegetarian/pasta-less lasagna. Serve it with a crsipy bread and a nice green salad. ENJOY!

To prevent having too much water, salt the squash and zucchini heavily and allow to sit for 30 minutes, then rinse.  It takes out much of the excess water.  Also, be sure to seed the tomatoes.  Finally, I like to add a little tomato paste to the mixture to thicken.

Delicious!  I use spray my pan with Pam and leave out the butter.  I sprinkle the veggies with some italian seasoning and minced garlic. During cooking you may have to drain the pan a couple of times.  After it's done I sprinkle everything with parmesan vs. romano.

My husband really liked this dish. I think I added too much pepper. I added both black pepper and banana pepper. I did not add butter between each layer because that seemed too unhealthy instead I added just a little veggie oil (maybe 2-3 tbps) between the middle layer. I also used parmesan cheese throughout and sharp shedder on the last two layers. I used italian spiced Mrs. dash between layers which gave the dish great flavoring. I think the dish needed too many adjustments for 4 stars, but it was good.

Made this according to recipe, except I used a shredded 4 cheese pizza package I had on hand, and added about 1/2 cup dry grated parmesan cheese on top.  Also used a combination of Vidalia and red onions.  Baked it uncovered.  It was still incredibly juicy with a crispy crunchy topping, but great over a black/brown rice combination. Very delicious! Added a bit of garlic powder after cooking.  Would also add fresh basil next time.  It was fantastic!  Will definitely make again!

This casserole came out yummy and smelled so good when I took it out. The only change I made was to sprinkle a bit of shredded cheddar on top because I ran short on parmesan between the layers and covered it with foil for the first 20 mins. I took the foil off for the last 10 mins and let it get brown and bubbly. Kids ate it all up!

I never follow a recipe exactly, so I shouldn't be rating this, but it was great.  I actually made this with a mexican-blend shredded cheese in place of the romano cheese, went a little heavier on the tomatoes.  It was quite luscious.

As indicated by several others, I reduced the cheese, not wanting all the fat.  I really thought having a baked dish would be warm, delicious and comforting, but this wasn't the case.  It was very bland.  I will look for another recipe with some extra kick and flavor.

I really liked this recipe. It's not anything fancy, but it's ease:tastiness ratio is definitely a good one! I didn't use butter, and I'm not sure why you would! It tasted great without the extra calories! Also, I used cheddar instead of Romano b/c that's what I had on hand. I'd definitely recommend it for a quick, healthy side dish!

I made this dish for my husband and my friend(who is vegetarian). Their reactions to it were phenomenal! Everyone simply loved it! It was such a beautiful dish. I ended up tweaking it slightly: No onions, no butter (cause it's healthier), and 6 cheese Italian, and Italian herb seasoning grinder. I added the seasoning for each layer. I would defiantly cook this again! Such a rich and beautiful dish!

After reading other reviews, I added oregano and basil for more flavor, topped the vegetables with bread crumbs, and decreased the butter. I still, however, found this to be too soupy and lacking in flavor.

This recipe was amazing!  I used less butter (and used "it's not butter") and a little less onion but other than that, the recipe was perfect.  Will use again and again!!

This was a great, easy alternative to a similar gratin I used to make every summer. I made some alterations, using parmesan instead of ramono, half the butter, and sprinkling every layer with garlic powder and basil on the squash layers. Served with brown rice drizzled in the juices from the casserole. Boyfriend went back for thirds!

I think this recipe would be awesome if you made it mediterranean style!!!  Omit the butter and drizzle some olive oil and basil; double the tomatoes (I squeezed the tomatoes a tad to get rid of some juices!); and load on some fresh garlic or garlic powder!  YUM!    We made this recipe as noted but only did 2 TBS of butter, served it over rice and added garlic powder and soy sauce.

This was an excellent recipe for all the squash and zucchini that you never know what to do with!  I added some feta cheese and mozzarella to the top and it was fantastic!  The first time I made it, I didn't have enough tomato, so used a can of diced tomatoes.  Make sure you drain it though.

This was a wonderful dish.  I added thinly sliced parsnips and instead of tomatoes, a can of garlic and olive oil canned diced tomatoes.

This turned out great. The only changes I made was add some fresh basil and I halved the butter and put some olive oil instead. The Romano cheese really adds a great flavor to the recipe. I've never enjoyed an all vegetarian casserole as much as I have enjoyed this one.

We were looking for a nice veggie dish for a get together and found this. We had no ramano cheese so we substituted pepper jack. I did put rice as a bed and placed a mixture of fresh sliced jalapenos and Rotel to the middle layer. This gave it a nice kick. The dish was an instant hit with me (I like it hot!) my wife also made one according to the recipe subbing pepper jack as well and had a lot of juice so the rice bed really helps. Thanks for all your tips as you helped me with some creative thought and heads up! By the way the casseroles were a hit and all we brought home were empty dishes! We will make this a regular in our home!

I like squash & zucchini but my husband doesn't so I am always looking for different recipes.  Because some reviews complained of blandness I used canned diced tomatoes with basil, oregano & garlic instead of sliced tomatoes.  I covered it and cooked it for 20 minutes and then used a bulb baster to remove excess liquid, covered it and baked for another 15 minutes, removed more liquid then baked for a final 15 minutes covered.  It was cooked through and not to soggy.  My husband liked it alot and is actually looking forward to the leftovers.

My family & I did not like this at all.  It was very bland and the veggies did not cook all of the way.  I love squash & zucchini and I was very dissapointed when we tasted it.  It looked great when it came out of the oven, but it just had no flavor at all.

Very tasty recipe! I followed the suggestions of a few other reviewers and did not cover it and it came out great. I also did not have any fresh tomatos so I used canned with basil and oregano and also put bread crumbs on top which made the top layer extra crunchy! Everyone was pleasantly surprised and liked it even those who say they don't like zucchini or squash. Will definitely make it again!

I halved everything except the cheese and still got 4 servings.  It would have been way too bland without the extra cheese.

I dislike when people rate a recipe based on the changes they have made, so first of all as is I think that this recipe is quite good, definitely 3 1/2 stars.  With a few small changes I think it can get even better.  I tried this recipe for the first time today.  I added a few tablespoons of breadcrumbs as recommended by another reviewer to give it a little crunch, this was definitely a good decision.  I also added a tiny bit of garlic salt on top of the bread crumbs as I felt it needed just a tiny bit more flavor.  I think next time I might make a few small changes.  I was thinking about sauting a little garlic in the butter and brushing that on the layered zuchinni and squash.  I also think that a little fresh basil might taste nice as for some reason this reminds me of a light pizza.  Overall this is a great, simple recipe that offers everyone a good starting point and something to build off of!

Delicious !!  My husband and I both love zucchini and squash.  We didn't have Romano cheese so used mozarella.  Didn't change anything else--why would you.  I know this will be a favorite.

Great recipe!  I didn't have tomatoes, so substituted diced canned tomatoes.  I also substituted olive oil for butter. Since there are only two of us, I halved the recipe and had plenty to spare! The flavor was great but much too watery.  Next time I will drain the matoes and cook the dish uncovered.

I'm not a huge fan of Zucchini and Squash, but thought I'd try this recipe for my husband.  He absolutely loved it.  I made more than the original recipe for a family dinner and had leftovers.  He said this was even better heated up the next day.  Will definitely make again.

My boys are not fans of tomatoe in veggies so I made a few alterations.  First, omitted the tomatoes so to make up for the loss of flavor, I caremlized the onions before layering. I cut the veggies into slices rather than lengthwise for more even cooking.  I substituted a mix of Mozzarella (2/3) and cheddar (1/3) for the Romano cheese and finally, I lightly sprinkled the top of the casserole with Italian bread crumbs.  The dish disappeared in minutes!

This is very good.  My husband and I enjoyed it quite a bit.
I did not have any yellow squash so I just used Zucchini.  I
will definitely use this recipe again and I will share it with 
family  members.

Very watery and needs some more seasoning a bit bland.  I think if you add some fresh basil or something it would make it a lot better. But overall not too bad. easy to make but a bit cime consuming cutting up everything. also used plum tomatoes instead of regular and added red peppers.

Delicious!  I added in two roasted poblano peppers and the flavors went excellent.  On the advice of one of the other reviewers I did add some garlic powder between layers.     I don't know how good it would have been without the fresh vegetables - but certainly worth trying again.

My new years resolution this year is to eat healthier and I decided the best way to do that is to reduce the amount of meat in my diet; so I'm not really a vegitarian.  This was the first dish I tried and I'll say I wasn't too enthusiastic when I was preparing it because it really didn't look that good, but it was GREAT!  I was so impressed and I feel so much better about trying other dishes.

A very simple dish to prepare. I added oregano and a few other spices to add flavor. I made it for a friend after surgery when she couldn't get around and she loved it, too. The more tomatoes the better to make it nice and juicy.

This was okay, but I'll probably not make it again.  I found it kind of watery even using 1/3 of the butter called for.

This is the best way to serve squash and zucchini to kids! My granddaughter didn't like the sound of it until she took a bite, it was all over after that.  It is now one of her favorites. The one thing I did change was that I buttered my dish instead of oil and I used an Italian cheese blend for the topping.  If you haven't tried this one, you really should!

Delicious I am making it again. I did make a few changes but stayed with the basic  used mozzarella ,quesadilla and coby cheese i love cheese. I season layer by layer.  I read several of the made it recipes and followed some of there tips. It did produce a lot of  juice so I made a pot of steam  rice and the juice made more flavorful. will make again

Absolutely delicious! I had fresh zucchini, butternut squash, and tomatoes from the garden and I was worried because sometimes the zucchini peel is bitter, and the squash too hard, but everything came out just perfect. I just cooked everything for about 50 minutes, rather than 30 minutes. Thank you, yummy!

I really like this casserole with all the fresh veggies.  I browned chicken breast in a skillet and layered it on the bottom of the pan before the vegetable.  I also sprinkle just a bit of Chachere's.  I will make this again.

This recipe is good! Yes, it lends toward making changes but changes to what tastes good to the cook.  I made a small portion. 1 zucchini, 1 squash, 1/2 red onion, 2 tomatoes (roma),(just regular round slicing of veggies),   1 tablespoon garlic butter, garlic powder, pepper, Italian seasoning,  a drizzle or 2 of olive oil. After baking and veggies were soft (no foil) added shredded Parmesan and cotija cheese.  The liquid produced was minimal. It was delish, I almost ate the entire pan myself.  Will make again. Really want try this with spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese that I read here.

Absolutely delicious  I used mozzarella cheese on each layer I also added much rooms to the onion mix, I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used roasted garlic chunky canned tomatoes, didn't think it would have been Soo good I will most definitely make it again.

My entire family raved about this dish!  I also used fresh veggies from farmer's market and followed a few other suggestions, sliced the veggies in the round, used mozzarella cheese and put one package uncooked minute rice in the bottom of baking dish.  The rice suggestion was meant to absorb juice overflow, which it did, but my family enjoyed the rice with the dish!  I enjoyed the leftovers 2 days later! This one will be a family dinner staple!

I loved it and so did my 15 year old son!!  I hardly had any leftovers for lunch!!  I did add garlic salt and basil on each layer, plus I used just a small drizzle of olive oil rather than butter.  Delicious.

Next time I will salt the vegetables & let them sit as it was too watery. I had to take it all apart & re-layer it because I missed the butter, salt & pepper between each layer part.I would use less onion & maybe dice it instead of slices. I did put crushed Ritz crackers on top which really were good. I will make it again using some Italian spices & less butter & cheese.

Love this recipe. To avoid a watery mess,  salt the vegetables before cooking for a few hours then pat dry. Also, caramelize the onions before putting them on top of the vegetables.  Delicious!!!

I added butter rounds, but I love the layer effect. These dishes get thick fast, so use only a few ingredients. I was left with left over squash and zucchini. I thought of adding eggs also, and a few other things, but wanted to give this recipe a fair shake. I also like Sarah used Mozzarella cheese instead, which I HIGHLY recommend. (it's thick, binding, and reacts well to abuse.) 

Recipes like this are excellent for experimentation. They are building blocks for personalization. If it's to "runny" then drain it half way. If it's to dry, then take it out early. If it's not spicy, then go insane. Add spices and a select fish/chicken meat! This is a basic and you almost can't go wrong unless you let it burn or give up.

**Note these veggies hold a lot of water you will have to deal with or utilize them to your own liking. Manipulate. spices, additional ingredients like mushrooms, or even canned condensed soups could be added to change this to your liking. This is simply a building block, EXPERIMENT!!!

I had some frozen zucchini and yellow squash to use and tried this recipe. My husband doesn't like tomatoes, so I left those out. It was so good and easy to make! I did add some Italian seasoning with each layer for added flavor.

Good flavor, but too watery for my taste. I baked uncovered, but still had lots of water at the bottom. I sprinkled a bit of garlic powder on each layer along with the salt and pepper, which added a nice hint of flavor.

I melted a stick of butter in the microwave, and brushed it on the layers. I left out the tomatoes. I just used a handful of cheese (mozzerella). And, I put some basil on the top layer. It was delicious! The whole family loved it!

This was amazing, easy, and healthy!  I used a grated Parmesan-Romano mix and I think it turned out even better b/c of the way the Parm blended with the tomato.  Also, I put the spoonfuls of butter on top of veggies but UNDER the tomatoes.  Delish!

I loved this recipe. I did follow other suggestions and ommitted the butter. I also used cheddar cheese because that is what I had on hand. It was great. Will definitely make again.
