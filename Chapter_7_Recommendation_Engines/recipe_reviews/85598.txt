I made this without cooking the carrots and used honey instead of Splenda.  Delicious!

I brought this dish to a Thanksgiving potluck, and it went over very well.  I left out the raisins, added some chopped cilantro, and held back on the garlic.  It was delicious!

Really good recipe. I recommend going ahead and cooking the carrots-- I've had this before where the carrots are fresh and there's something nice about having them slightly softer (only slightly-- 2 minutes was perfect). I added raisins and cashews, as well as cilantro and green onion. I didn't have cider vinegar so substitutes rice wine vinegar which turned out great.

This was interesting. It's a very good combination of sweet and savory. I made it raw and shredded the carrots so they'd be tender and absorb the flavor. Instead of Splenda, I used 2 tsp of agave nectar (a natural sweetener). After tasting it, I added a touch more olive oil, cider vinegar, cinnamon, and ginger. And I used 4  dashes of cayenne--just enough to give it some heat, but not enough to burn your mouth. I bet this would be good topped with slivered almonds.

My husband and his buddy loved this recipe and asked for more.  I did make a few minor changes.  I used honey instead of splenda (as one reviewer suggested) and I omitted raisins (Just can't do it thanks to "Better Off Dead"...if you haven't seen it, rent it, great movie)  but I added slivered almonds instead.  I didn't have any fresh ginger on hand so I substituted w/ dried ground ginger and it tasted just fine...I am sure would have been even better if I used fresh.  I also made sure to refrigerate the dish for at least 3 hours.  It got better the next day.  Great recipe and can be very versatile.  Will make again and again

This is fabulous!  I just used raw carrots and grated them.  I don't care for non-nutritive sweeteners, so I used demerara sugar (1 Tbsp instead of 2).  Also, I didn't have any raisins, so I used dried cranberries instead.  This recipe is a real keeper!

I have prepared this several times and it is very good.  People who were certain they would hate it, really liked it . I have always used sugar because that is what I had but will try honey. I use raw carrots and shred them in the food processor.  I found the small shred to be better that the longer shred.  It seems to absorb the flavors better and is neater to eat.

This is a very good salad... It had a good tangy taste. I would encourage you not to take a short cut on the refridgerator time. The only change I will make on this recipie is to cut the carots into thinner slices My family loved it! I served this great salad while all the kids were home for the holidays. -- enjoy!

I liked this more than my husband did. It's just the two of us so there were lots of leftovers, and we got a bit sick of them after a couple of days. Never the less, I usually am not a huge carrot fan and I liked this different way to eat them - fresh, tasty, spicy/sweet/sour. Will probably make again, but halve the recipe.

Wasn't real crazy about this. Kids tasted it but refused to eat it (3 and 5 yr). I think it has potential if it had more of an asia emphasis - maybe a little sweeter, rice vinegar instead of cider, omit garlic and cumin? Not sure. I will probably try a different recipe altogether next time than trying to modify this.

Used this as basic recipe. Used uncut baby carrots; subbed red wine vinegar; subbed honey; subbed regular salt and pepper; left out raisins; added cilantro as others suggested.  All spices were Penzey's dried.  Excellent!

I made this dish exactly as written the first time and really liked the flavor, but my husband and I weren't wild about the texture of the cooked carrots.  The next time I made it, I just shredded the raw carrots and added the dressing, and we liked it much better and it took less time to prepare.   The flavor really does intensify if you wait 1-2 days before eating.

I made this for a church potluck. I did double the recipe with honey instead of artificial sweetener and didn't include raisins because I didn't have ay. Almost all of it was eaten and some people did come back for seconds. I think next time, I will leave out the cinnamon. Other than that, it's definitely a different flavor that I'll try again.

Very good. I made it with 1 tablespoon of honey instead of the Splenda, and I used heirloom carrots to make it prettier.  A hit. As someone else did, I may use dried cranberries instead of raisins next time.

I tried this dish warmed to serve with the holiday meal and it didn't work as I had hoped. I cooked the carrots as suggested by others and made it a day ahead. The aroma was really dominated by the vinegar and had less of the gingery flavor than I hoped. I will try it again to serve cold as a summer salad because I still think this recipe has great potential.

Wow, really tasty!  I used white vinegar, regular sugar, and left out the raisins, which shows this recipe is flexible.  These are sweet without being sugary.

I made this as a warm carrot dish.  It was fantastic.  Followed the directions with a few changes because of not having certain ingrediants.  I used 2 tablespoons of honey as another review suggested instead of the splenda.  Used 1/8 tsp ground ginger instead of fresh ginger.  Omitted the rainins because I didn't have any.  Mixed all together and then cooked on medium burner on the stove top until bubbly.  These were really good.

I actually don't like carrots but A friend brought some carrots over for me to cook and there were so many i was able to do several different things with them and this recipe was the best.  She loved it!! I felt so good I had to tell her it wasn't my own, but that I got it from you and she still loved it, so kudos to you and thanks!!!

This was fantastic, light, and slightly exotic. I made a few changes according to some of the reviewers and my own tastes. I added honey in place of splenda. In place of the raisins I added dried dates. I also added some lemon juice, curry powder, and cashews.

Very nice! I just barely steamed my carrots as I like them crisp-tender. My raisins were a little dried out so I let them steam for a few seconds, too, to plump them up.  I thought the seasonings in the dressing were perfect! Thank you for sharing!

Very good! Dh loved it.  Personally, I thought it had a tad too much cinnamon, but I'm not a big cinnamon fan.  This is definitely a keeper.  I think I'll probably make the dressing (w/ less cinnamon) for green salads too.

Great recipe to take to family gatherings, esp. since it's best made the day before.  Only change I made was using canola oil instead of olive oil (I'm allergic).  Might try sesame oil next time.  Will definitely make again and again.

This was really different.
I used shredded carrots, as opposed to slices, otherwise just as directed.
We thought it actually went well as a side to pork chops, probably because of the sweetness. A little goes a long way.
And, as others have said, the flavors get better after being i the fridge for a day or two.

I keep fresh ginger in the freezer to use any time I need it. I was happy to see I had all the ingredients on hand to make this very nice salad. I made it per the recipe with no substitutions.

Surprised  by how good it was, even with just a couple of hours of marinating.  I will definitely make it again--maybe adding cilantro next time.

I love this salad - I spiralize the carrots instead and don't cook them.  Once they sit for a while - they become tender.  Love it!

I will probably make this again, BUT I would not add the cinnamon.  That did not work here for me.  I cut the carrots relatively thin on a mandolin, then blanched them in boiling water for 1 min and then put them in an ice  bath before mixing with the dressing.   I did not add raisins (?)   I used honey instead of Splenda and up'ed the salt and added pepper.

Definitely cook the carrots
Add curly parsley
Sub craisins for raisins
Sub honey or agave for sweeteninng (save your gut microbes )
Up the garlic ginger and cayenne
Use Saigon cinnamon
And for best visual presentation we mix rainbow carrots and serve in a bright blue bowl

Really glad I made this for a pot luck. Just a few changes to suit my taste. Used canola oil, honey, dried cranberries and just a little more salt. Added cilantro which was suggested. I made it the night before and added the cilantro in the morning. Wonderful!

I'm always looking for new things to do with carrots and this sounded like a great summer salad.  I used craisins instead of raisins (personal preference) and served with Asian salmon.  We found it enjoyable, but nothing we would make again

very yummy, but I would recommend taste-testing sauce and adjusting it to your liking. Used honey instead of splenda. I also added more ginger, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon. Family liked it.

These were actually quite tasty. I didn't add the sugar, just to keep it a little healthier, and they still tasted great.

This was a bit too different for us. If I would make it again, I'd cook the carrots for longer and I'd double the dressing, so the carrots won't be dry.

I didn't really find this to be much more than the sum of its parts.  However, I ended up throwing it into a stir-fry with some tofu and other vegetables, and it tasted good in there... Maybe it would be better with another vegetable added in... possibly cucumber?

I've gotten nothing but great compliments on this recipe. It's so yummy and healthy. Try it without cooking the carrots--even better!
