I could not find the Nacho cheese soup so I had to go with regular cheese soup and the result was still really good. I added a little bit of hot sauce

I made this exactly as written.  I spread about 1/4 cup of the finished product onto 6" fried corn tortillas, sprinkled chopped iceburg lettuce over and ate the best tostadas I've ever eaten.

I had high hopes for this dip but it disappointed. I found it to be very bland and boring.  It’s very creamy and is a good lunch meal but it lacked flavor for my tastebuds. Easy to assemble and most likely will have these items in your pantry. Even after adding chili flakes, onion powder, cumin and hot sauce it still didn’t have the taste I was hoping for. Will not make again but thanks for the recipe.
