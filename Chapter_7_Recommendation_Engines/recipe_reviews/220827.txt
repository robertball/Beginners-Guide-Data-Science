I was impressed by the pudding consistency. The taste was a little bland, but the fact that it was so healthy made up for it.

Healthy and pretty good, I guess, but also rather bland; I added 1tsp salt, 1tsp vanilla, 1tbs honey, and 5tbs cocoa (instead of 4), which did the trick really nicely and made a wonderfully rich-tasting but still quite light pudding.

I saw this recipe and I just had to try it because it was so unique I never would have though of combining those three ingredients... As it chills it really does develop a flavor all its own you can definitely taste the banana but really it develops its own chocolaty flavor.. I did have to add a little milk to get it to blend in my tiny blender but the consistency was still perfect.. and the best part is it is there is no added sugar or anything.. all natural ingredients... thanks for the idea

I was intrigued by the ingredients. You mostly taste banana and then chocolate. If you really look for it, you can taste a tiny bit of avocado. I topped mine with a little fat free whipped cream.. not vegan but tasty. This is a nice recipe that I'll make again sometme

This is the first recipe on here that I saw for vegan pudding. My best friend is vegan, and this was such a simple healthy recipe. But I was overly curious about the other recipes using avocado and bananas. After reading plenty of reviews I considered combining peoples' different suggestions on improving it. So I kept everything the same but left out one banana and added 2 tablespoons of peanut butter, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk, about 1 tbs of honey, and a few drops of vanilla Stevia. I also chopped up dairy free chocolate chips to garnish the top of the pudding instead of cocoa powder. Absolutely delicious, with or without whipped cream. I highly recommend, and the taste only gets better the longer it's in the fridge.

Because the size of avocados and bananas vary so much, I found the quantities rather misleading.  One avocado here gave me almost 4 cups once blended, and our bananas our smaller, so I lost count of how many I put in after discarding bruises and dividing pieces amongst the kids.   I poured in cocoa powder to taste, and sweetened condensed milk for extra sweetness.  We aren't vegans.   Turned out great for our family with these changes

I was very surprised on how delicious this was. I am not vegan, nor am I particularly healthy, but I am trying to be a bit healthier and lose some baby weight I cannot seem to lose. This recipe was great. I did however feel it was missing something, so I added a splash or 2 of vanilla. I will be making this again for my family. Great consistency as well.

Love this pudding!! The only change I make is to reduce the amount of bananas to two. I normally use over-ripe bananas for extra sweetness. The avocado makes the consistency of this pudding very creamy. So good!! My food processor works perfect for this recipe. Extremely nutritious and delicious:) Thanks for sharing!!

This is such a delicious treat.  Sometimes I put a "dollop" of all natural peanut butter to give it a different flavor.

I made this exactly as directed, but added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  It turned out very good and the vanilla was a good addition.  We couldn't taste the avocado at all, but love avocados and wouldn't have been disturbed even if we could taste it.  I'm not a big fan of bananas, but really liked it anyway.  Will definitely make this again, what a nice treat that even non-vegans like us enjoy!

Curiosity!  I just had to try this recipe to see if it really works.  And, it does!  It's very creamy and has a perfectly smooth, pudding consistency.  On the flavor front, if you are expecting chocolate pudding, think again.  It is all banana!  What chocolate flavor you do get is very, very bitter.   Probably not something I would make again, but it was fun to try.

Absolutely delish! I only had 3 bananas but they were so ripe that it was plenty sweet. It came out so creamy and chocolately. Best chocolate pudding I've ever had.

Delicious and simple ingredients. I will make again. My 5 yr old and I loved it. It was so thick it didn't mix well in the blender so I added a little maple syrup and water.

This ABC Pudding was amazing! I used cacao(fat removed from cocoa), instead of cocoa and added a little agave for a little more sweetness. My husband and I could not tell the difference between this pudding and the store bought ones. Could not taste the avacado and it was so creamy, no lumps at all. I will make this again and I already shared this recipe with a friend!

I love this pudding & have made it 4 times since my first try.  The only change I make is to  add about 1/4 cup of coconut milk to the mixture (given that my old blender doesn't work through ingredients without a bit of liquid!).  The pudding was still silky and chocolate-y, and I find this adds another aspect to the  flavour.  Thanks for posting a great recipe!

I am not Vegan so my initial reaction was too tangy, but I licked the spatula one more time and I got hooked. it's texture is better than any box mix or cornstarch variety. I needed a little sugar but this is new favorite way to use up avocados!

wow! this was amazing. I used two frozen bananas and one regular. I also added a couple dollops of plain yogurt which helped for smooth texture.... or maybe I was just impatient! family gobbled it up.

I thought this looked interesting and healthy. Since I love using frozen bananas as a base for a chocolate shake, I thought I would like this. I did not like it at all. It was strange tasting and bitter. I added some agave nectar in hopes that it just needed a little sweetener. Unfortunately I was wrong. It didn't change the the fact that this pudding is just not good.

This was very good. I'm not vegan, just had a few ripe bananas! I used 3 ripe bananas, 3/4 of a Florida (larger, ligher colored) avocado, the same cocoa, then also added the splash of almond milk to help with pureeing... very good.

I couldn't get anything to blend, so I ended up adding a small amount of milk to get it moving. I only made a quarter of the recipe in my Vitamix 8-oz bowl. It was ok. I wasn't going to sit there all day waiting for it to blend, so I ended up eating it, little chunks and all. The flavor was ok. I highly recommend not having anything to eat beforehand because I ate the pudding, semi-enjoying it, then sipped some carrot soup, and then when I went back to the pudding, the pudding tasted so sweet or sour that it made me cringe. I've never had that reaction with a pudding... Maybe I'll try making this again. It just didn't do it for me. Quite a bummer. I like chiaseed pudding better.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I would have given it a five except we compared it to the spicy chocolate version (that recipe also found on AllRecipes.com).  The spicy recipe uses coconut milk and eliminates the banana and peanut butter.

Having said that, comparing the two recipes is going to boil down to personal taste preferences.  We like that little after burn of heat that follows the chocolate in the spicy version.  If spicy heat is not your thing, then go with this recipe and you will love it.

With minor changes, this pudding is delicious! I added another 1.5 tbsp cocoa powder, 1 tsp vanilla essence, and 1 tsp honey. The bananas gave it a different but not unpleasant texture. Everyone in my family loved it! I'm definitely making it again.

Followed the suggestion of adding a splash of vanilla extract and honey. Also topped it with fresh strawberries! Might add a pinch of nutmeg or sea salt next time, too.

Oh my goodness. Never cared much for puddings. Had to try this so simple recipe to use avocado, banana, and chocolate. 
Did not change a thing. It does need a lot of patience blending and tasting, blending and tasting but that is not a bad thing. My Ninja that I use for smoothies still required several trials to get the time down. I didn't want any green to show nor a banana taste so I blended then added banana until it tasted just right. This made 4 generous servings even with my ample samplings and I scraped the blender well just to satisfy myself so I could get the serving bowls into the refrigerator without getting into them. Will definitely make this again.

Nice and creamy.  Tasted the banana, and like a previous note was a bit bland.  I added 1/2 tsp salt, 1tsp vanilla extract,  1 Tbs honey and 1 Tbs creamy peanut butter...like peanut butter cup pudding!

Great recipe! It's a light creamy somewhat thick "pudding." I only had frozen bananas on hand and it turned out nice and cold. No need to refrigerate before serving :-) I also followed other suggestions and added 1tsp salt, 1tsp vanilla, 1tbsp honey, and slightly more than 5tbsp unsweetened cocoa. Both my 4 year old and I LOVED it. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome...definitely one of my favorites!  It is so easy and delicious.  I gave up "added sugar" in my diet and this was perfect.  The bananas add sweetness and satisfy any craving I might have.  Just make sure that the bananas and avocado are very ripe.

I was a little skeptical about making this recipe, but I wanted a chocolate pudding that was dairy free, so I gave it a try.  On the first bite I wasn't convinced that I liked it, but a couple bites later, I thought it was pretty darn good.  My six year old helped me make it and she loved it from the first bite!

Although this is hasn't had time to rest in the fridge, I have to say that I've struggled with the flavor.  I find it slightly bitter, and "strange" tasting.  I love avocados and I like bananas but I still used every suggestion given by other reviewers as I went along and ended up adding 1 tsp of vanilla, a bit of almond milk, a bit more cocoa powder, approx 2 tsp of sugar, a few drops of stevia, a couple of tablespoons of 1/2 and 1/2 and, finally, 2 T of peanut butter as a last resort.  I hope it tastes better in a couple of hours or it will end up in the trash!

I was slightly afraid to try this, but it was good!  As written, the recipe has too much banana for my tastes, but with some modifications, I'll be making this again.  I just mixed it up with a fork, and I actually liked the slightly chunky texture.  I did add 1 tsp vanilla after a taste test told me it needed some tweaking, and that made a big difference.  I couldn't get rid of the slightly powdery taste from the cocoa powder, so I think next time I'll try dissolving it in a little milk first and see if that works.

This pudding looked smooth and creamy and was the right "pudding" texture after sitting in the fridge for an hour. However, I didn't like the taste and my toddler didn't like it either. I had even added a Tbsp of sugar, but it didn't help the flavor much, and my bananas were very ripe. I only made a half a batch of this, and put the remainder in the freezer to use as a smoothie base some other time. Thanks anyway, but I'll stick with Chocolate Avocado Pudding from this site, which I liked a lot.

I guess it depends on what type of unsweetened cocoa you use and how big the bananas were. Mine definitely wasn't bland. It was quite strong and a bit bitter. Ended up needing a bit of extra sweetening. With more banana it could have been better. I would probably only rate three stars, except I think that it could have been better if I'd made it differently.

Tried this recipe, & really liked it, but to reduce the sweetness a tiny bit, I'm going to try using 2 avocados & 2 bananas.

Yup, this was super good! As others have mentioned, the avocado and banana might need some liquid (milk, water) to loosen it up in the blender.  I like that you can leave it as is or add some type of sweetener if the bananas don't give it enough sweetening (sugar, syrup, stevia).

I always have a freezer full of overripe bananas.  Finally something healthy, quick & delicious to do with them.  My daughter and I just whipped this up in our magic bullet.  We both loved it. Thanks!
