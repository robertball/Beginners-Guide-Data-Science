I just made cookies like (I used my usual cut-out recipe) this and it took till the 5th tray to get them off the pan.  I used tin foil covered with nonstick spray.  After I had the cookie on the pan, I covered the "opening" with more spray before filling with a whole Jolly Rancher (works better than lifesavers).  After baking just till the candy melts, slide the whole sheet of tin foil off the pan and let the cookies cool completely.  Turn the cookies upside down and peel off the foil.  This is what finally worked for us.  The results are beautiful!

These cookies are fabulous!  I made them to take to my neighborhood cookie exchange and won first prize!  I had made similar cookies about ten years ago, so was thrilled to "rediscover" the recipe.  Instead of rolling dough into ropes, I used a large house cookie cutter and cut out smaller shapes inside.  I also used Lifesavers instead of sourballs.  Some of the houses resembles churches, some were schoolhouses, etc.  The effect was truly charming.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone, as they are not particularly difficult to make.

I love how this handles. I used regular Christmas cookie cutters and life savers. Parchment paper is the best invention for cookies. I used one piece for the entire batch of cookies. I think the next time I will up the measurement for the spices from 1/4 to 1/2 tesp. I could hardly taste the spices in he cookies. I also uped the oven temp. from 350 to 375 and baked the cookies for 7 minutes for a crispier cookie, my husband really loves these.

Very strong molasses flavor in dough.  Use finely crushed candy, big chunks bubble.  Keep ropes of dough very thin or cookie will be soft and break apart.  Fun to do as a group activity, not individually unless you are very patient!! (Unless you halve recipe).  Neat concept.

This is not the original "Land O" Lakes" recipe I had 20 yrs ago, that one didn't contain molasses. But it WORKS- the cookies are delicious.

Wow.  I don't know what I did wrong, but the batter had the consistency of soup when it finished chilling.  I ended up putting in extra flour and just making ginger cookies.  They turned out great, though!

Quite good! I used honey instead of molasses.  You could kind of taste the honey, but it didn't overpower at all and you could taste the spices quite well.  I used jolly ranchers which seemed to work pretty well.  I will definitely make these again, but next time I will roll the dough and cut them instead of rolling ropes.

It's never too soon to start planning for Christmas! Added more spice. 1/4 teaspoon is not enough, so I used 1/2 teaspoon of each spice. Added a little more flour, too. Used Fire Jolly Ranchers for the filling. (One for each cookie.) Used two cookie cutters for precision and uniformity. Baked these for 10-12 minutes on parchment paper for easy removal from the cookie sheet. When cooled completely removed them from the parchment. Very happy with the results. Taste was good, and the appearance... charming! Nice addition to a Christmas Cookie Platter.

It's a great recipe for rolled gingerbread cookies!  As cute as the stained glass cookies came out, I didn't care for them.  The candy is sort of hard, sort of chewy and very contrasty to the cookie dough.  I also didn't like the strong molasses flavor of the cookies with the hard candy flavor.  I did use sweet candies however, and the author's suggestion to use sour candies is probably intentional.

I made these and have to add 3 comments for those who want to try them: (1) tracing a cut-out with a roll/rope of dough is hard. And unless you have the little cookie cutters as well as the big ones (which are pictured in some versions but I've not found in stores), these are a huge amount of work & require steady hands & gift of art; (2) don't underestimate what it takes to crush the candies. If you have a strong food processor or a better blender than I do, it may work. But they are strong & messy. They break thorough all bags I tried to put them in for mallot crushing - freezer bags, cereal box liners, etc. - and make a big mess & still don't get crushed evenly, no matter what you use. I tried also using "Nerds" which are always pretty small, separating them by color, etc. But they didn't dry hard & stuck to everything & were not as transparent as Jolly Ranchers. (3) On the whole, this recipe is tedious & only for artistic people. I had to use more flour to keep dough from sticking & then they didn't look good. 
They took me 3 hours one day & 5 hours the next. Although I'm artistically inclined & do a lot of intricate work around the house (including "handyman" jobs and jewelry repair), mine did not turn out as pictured... were much messier & less attractive. Anyway, not to put a damper on this, but I wish I had been warned before I went to all the trouble. :-) Still: they WERE INTERESTING, a conversation-starter & tasted pretty good... but not fantastic.

Awesome cookie! Believe it or not, a pinch of Cardomon goes a long way to add just a touch more complexity and depth. Either way, it's a winner!

The change I would make for these cookies is to bake them on parchment paper or better yet use the silpat on your cookie sheet. There are other silicone baking sheets out there. They are the the size of a cookie sheet or jelly roll pan. I haven't tried this yet but I plan on doing it this saturday at my  annual cookie baking day that I have had since around the mid 90's.

5 stars for how they look - beautiful; two stars for how they taste. In spite of doubling the spices (to 1/2 tsp ea), as several people recommended, the dough tasted only of molasses, with no bite or complexity. I used jolly ranchers, as many recommended  (there was no other option at Safeway), but the molasses tasted strange with them. The result was a disharmony of sweet, sour, and molasses. 

Really, the dough is nice in spite of being somewhat bland. I may use it (with more ginger) to make gingerbread later. 

The challenge is what goes best with jolly ranchers... or whatever clear candy you use... in the future, I may try this again with a chocolate base instead of molasses....
