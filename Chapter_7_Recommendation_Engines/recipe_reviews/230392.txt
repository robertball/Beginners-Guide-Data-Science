Given I was making a small amount of this just for Hubs and me, I didn’t measure ingredients - just eye balled them in smaller amounts…and added other ingredients as well.  This is a good, basic recipe; one that easily allows you to embellish upon it, which is what I did.  I used mild Italian sausage, first of all.  After browning it in a little olive oil I added chopped onion, carrots, celery and garlic and sweated those ingredients.  I used my own tomatoes, put up from my garden.  I liked the addition of both beef and chicken broths, but didn’t like the idea of the rigatoni, which is too big a pasta for this. Use something smaller, like shells or even elbow macaroni.   In this case, I used ditalini.  In addition to the ingredients listed I added fresh Swiss chard, the ribs of which I cooked with the celery, carrots and onion, and adding the chopped leaves during the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Since pasta absorbs so much liquid, I cooked it first; then added it to the soup at the end.  And how could I forget – along with the broths and tomatoes I poured in a good couple of glugs of red wine.  I served this with a mix of freshly grated Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano and some freshly baked bread sticks.  As this recipe’s first reviewer I’m happy to report that this is a good, basic recipe, one you can confidently prepare and still feel comfortable to play around with to accommodate whatever pasta or vegetables you have on hand.

Have made this soup several times this winter for my family and took to work today for a soup luncheon.  Huge hit.  I've used differing pastas each time.  Think we like the smaller pastas better.  But over all....a yummy recipe.

I had Italian sausage prepared and browned with the intent of making a spaghetti dish after work, then discovered I didn't have any sauce and no time to make a sauce. So I searched for recipes using the sausage and this sounded like a hearty simple dish. I did have my doubts but it was very tasty. I didn't add the beans, hubby doesn't like beans, used elbow Mac. I added splash of red wine but it probably didn't need it. Just play with the seasonings, adding veggie ingredients you like.

This was delicious. The only change I made was to add some frozen spinach. I will definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

Need to warm your bones on a chilly, blustery day?
Here's your fix!  
Delicious blend of flavors!
Only one substitution made:  I used Turkey Italian Sausage, which I removed from the casings & browned up before adding the balance of the ingredients.
Pasta was cooked separately, seasoned with parsley & butter, then added to each serving individually.  
I also included about 3 cups of fresh kale and topped each serving with shaved parmesan.
Served alongside crusty bread and can I just say, we were warmed to our toes!  Everyone loved it and gave the thumbs up on having this again many times over: instant favourite! 
Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe! :)

The whole family said this is THE best soup I've ever made.  We used turkey sweet italian sausage and added a 2 tbsp pouch of  recipe ready tomato paste as well as not one but two small cans of tomato sauce.  I didn't have  garlic or italian seasoning on hand but I put in some garlic powder and 3 tbsp of pesto from a jar and substituted some shredded gruyere cheese for the parmesan.  Even changing it up as I did it was WONDERFUL..  Thank you SO much Louise M Soweski for your fabulous contribution!!!

First time I made it without pasta. Second time with. Both good.
This soup is very tasty and was a hit with a church function.

Made this hearty soup for Halloween (before trick-or-treating) - family loved it!  I made 2 minor alterations: used all Chicken broth (instead of part Beef), and used garlic pasta sauce in place of plain tomatoe sauce.

With a "pinch" of Italian seasoning, this was pretty bland.  With a tsp of Italian seasoning, some salt and pepper, this was pretty good.  After tasting it, I threw in some kale just for the leafy greens.  It's pretty tasty stuff.

I don't normally change a recipe before making it a first time, but I was out of some stuff. I subbed two cans of Ro-Tel tomatoes for the tomatoes and tomato sauce. I used a medium hot sausage I had on hand. The carrots in the fridge looked a little dried out, so I threw in a cup of frozen corn. When I added the pasta, I threw a cheerful of sliced green onion for garnish. This was super easy to throw together and came out AMAZING, albeit a little spicy because of substitutions. Will definitely make again and again!

Simple & delicious. What more could I ask? I used elbow macaroni and turkey Italian sausage to give it a hardier flavor.

This is tasty and very easy to make. I had italian sausage and not the turkey sausage mentioned and it turned out great. I also added more broth as others mentioned. I had some celery left over so I threw that in... the recipe is flexible which I like.

I'm not a very big cook but one night I had a craving for soup and this recipe came in quite handy. It's possibly the best soup I've ever made. I didnt have the kind of beans required but I substituted it for black beans. It came out amazing.

We added more than a pinch of Italian seasoning and added extra pasta.  It was a hit for everyone except for my non-adventurous 7yo.  My husband and 11yo loved it.  Very filling and wonderful with a  side of toasted Italian bread!

this was a delicious soup . . . I forgot to put in the dried Italian seasoning blend, however, and probably because of that, it tasted exactly like a quick-cook cassoulet. N

Four and a half, for sure.  Doubled the liquid and spices, and added a couple of handfuls of bagged shredded coleslaw mix.  Didn't skimp on the other veggies, either.  Delicious and healthy recipe!  Topped with grated romano.
