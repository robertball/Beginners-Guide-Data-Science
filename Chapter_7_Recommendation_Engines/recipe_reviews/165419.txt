Yuca is awesome. But, you don't have to fry it or boil it! Prepare the Yuca the same way in 4" wedges and then steam it until it is almost fully cooked.   Then dip the steamed Yucas in a solution of fresh squeezed lime, salt (go lightly), onion powder, garlic powder, or chopped fresh garlic, chipotle chile powder, etc... (whatever you think tastes good) and then broil them real quick on a cookie sheet using no oil.  Once browned flip them over and brown the other side.  They will end up soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Yumm... and no fried oils! Heart Healthy! Plant Strong!  PS. Somebody stated that they eat the skin. Everything I have ever read states that the skin is toxic.

Its very impoartant to note there are many varieties of yuca root. The varieties breakdown into two main categories: bitter and sweet. I've only tried this recipe with the sweet variety. I've never seen bitter in the market, but if its not labeled, I ask the produce staff to make sure its sweet. Also, the skin contains a mild poison, so these fries should not be prepared with the skin. 

I made these fries with garlic -- added slices of garlic to the boiling water and lots of minced garlic was tossed in with the fries, yum! Also, I seasoned the fries with chipolte pepper and coarse sea salt. This is now my new recipe for garlic fries. Its a great replacement for starchy potatoes.

These were fantastic.  I gave it a 4 only because I made so many changes, but the concept is great!  My fiance can't eat nightshades so he really misses traditional potato fries, I made these the other day and they were a hit!  I did some research online and found the best way to cook is to boil until just tender (I used water and threw in a bouillon cube for flavor) and then drained, let cool and cut like steak fries, coated with Olive oil spray and tossed in a mix of onion powder, salt, pepper and some Nutritional yeast - baked until crispy turning once or twice.  We'll be making these ALL the time!

I don't have a deep fryer so I fried them in a skillet instead - it upped the cooking to time to about 10 minutes per batch. It's tough to see the fibrous core after you've boiled them so I cut out whatver I thought was that. They came out very good...a little tough but still very tasty. We sprinkled salt on them after removing them from the oil and served with sour cream.

Not bad.  I've had this at restaurants and liked it, but couldn't remember if they served a sauce with it.  We ended up eating them with salt, garlic powder, and seasoned salt.  They were still good, but this stuff is a lot of work!  That skin and fibrous pit are certainly something.  I think I might bake them next time--fried foods don't always agree with me.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy! I had these in a New Orleans restaurant (RioMar) with a hanger steak and chimichuri sauce; it was fabulous. I want it all the time now. And yes, add salt and garlic to the fries after frying - you won't regret it!

It took my wife and I three tries to get it just right! Some key tips to make your life way easier: use a deep fryer (we borrowed one), use peanut oil, and we found it useful to cut the peeled, uncooked yucca into the proper length, then quartered them so they would be pretty big fries. Then we boiled them in the correct shape. Especially if you get bigger yucca roots, it can be hard to get it cooked all the way. This way they cook faster, and you can transfer them directly into the oil, and you don't even notice the fibrous core because it ends up being one of the best crunchy parts! Seasoning with salt, pepper and cayenne pepper is our go-to. Hope those tips help! We absolutely love yucca fries and our friends ask us to bring them to parties every time haha

These are EXCELLENT. My wife is Peruvian by birth, and she introduced me to yucca.

Only the adventurous need try it, because it its NOT potatoes. One taste though, and I bet you'll like it :-)

This is a VERY old Latino/Hispanic basic starch food (like American potatoes or grits, Italian polenta, etc.). I had them for the first time in a South Beach Cuban dive many years ago, and honestly . . . they were ALMOST the highlight of that whole trip. As you can imagine, I had to find out how to make these. The great thing is that yucca is like potatoes . . . relatively bland, so you can let your imagination run wild (restaurants do). Use this as the basic recipe (pay attention here to everybody's recommendations about types of yucca, sweet vs. slightly bitter, cooking methods, etc.), but - like potatoes - you can pretty much do anything within reason . . . you can't go wrong. Go to your best-stocked grocery store and peruse the international aisle for sauces and ingredients. You will see "Yucca Flour," (gluten free - it's called Cassava Flour) with which you can make a delicious bread. Try stuffing and baking (wrap in yucca or corn leaves like tamales and cook on grill at your next cookout if you want to get all Martha Stewart-y). Bottom line:  you can't go wrong on this page . . . (and banana fries are also delicious). One last thing - if you make these for a crowd/party . . . make PLENTY and have plenty of sauce. You'll be shocked at how quickly they disappear. This and a layered Mexican chile/cheese/pepper dip (the ingredients and heat of which can also be adjusted according to crowd) run neck and neck as the most popular dishes I make (like ribs, I boil yucca to do mo

When I boiled mine they were kind of mushy on the outside and firm on the inside. Maybe I needed a larger pot as I found myself adding water halfway. They seem to absorb lots of water and swell! However I did find that once the boiled yuca cooled, the mushy part became really crispy after being fried. Just handle with care after boiling. I took the suggestions of adding salt and some cloves of garlic to the water. I also dipped these in a homemade garlic aioli dip - mayo, pinch minced garlic clove and dash of Dijon. Yummy!

I used several good suggestions from the commenters, such as pre-cooking with spices/herbs, and baking instead of frying. It came out superb! Thanks to all!

Here are some alternatives:

1. Prior to frying, pressure cook the yuca fries for about 4-5 minutes on high pressure. Pressure cook as you would cut potatoes.

2. We used the entire yuca tuber (after peeling), including the core and it was just fine!
