It was a tasty meal.  I'd make it again. It went well with homemade biscuits.

LOVED THIS SOUP!  My husband actually made it in our quick pot and it was amazing.  The flavor spot on. Chicken was moist and flavorful. It’s a keeper!!!

Chicken and veggies cooked fine, but taste was bland, not creamy, and didn’t resemble the taste of a chicken pot pie at all. Disappointed.

I'm sorry but it had the TASTE of a chicken pot pie but that was it. It was too thin  ! I like the old fashioned chicken pot pie
