I made this recipe for my family and a few friends.  I pan fried it instead of cooking it on the grill.  The results were amazing.  I received rave reviews from everyone.  As a matter of fact, they want to fish more now so I can fix it again!

Everyone in my family loved this fish.  The only thing I changed was instead of crushed crackers I used bread crumbs.  I will definitely be making this again!

Loved this!  We also soaked the fish in milk for 15 minutes before breading, and grilled on foil to avoid sticking and it worked great.  Fish was moist, tender, and rich.  Even the roommate who hates fish liked it, always a good sign. Thanks!

This fish came out perfect! Probably the best fish (and chips) I've ever had! I made this recipe with just a few small changes. I didn't have any garlic salt so I just used garlic powder and instead of grilling I pan fried the fish. At the recommendation of the guy at the store I also soaked the fish in milk for 15 minutes before dipping in butter and the saltine mixture. It was so good, and I think would have turned out the same if I had followed the recipe exactly.

This was an excellent way to prepare the fish.  As a few of the other reviewers suggested I soaked the fish in milk for at least 15 min. & used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I still thought it was a tad salty, but, everyone else thought it was seasoned just fine.  I did do mine on the grill and was pleasantly surprised on how well it held up & did not fall apart.  We loved the grilled taste & look forward to doing fish again this way real soon.

DH fell in love all over again, I thought it was a little salty so I'll work on that first by replacing garlic salt with garlic powder or a minced fresh clove.  Too cold to grill so I pan fried using butter flavor cooking spray in my trusty cast iron skillet.  The catfish was so tender he wants me to make this again next week!

This was wonderful.  Made in one of those fish grill things that you can flip over coated with a little oil.  Outside was nice and crunchy & inside very moist.  Also made with 1/2 panko, 1/2 WW bread crumbs & cajun seasoning.  Great both ways!!

Yummy! I tried this since I had some catfish and I did not know what to do with. I crushed th saltines in smaller chunks, and I dipped the catfish in milk with a little olive oil instead of butter. Then sprinkled with garlic salt and a little pepper. Sprinkled some dried oregano too.Then covered it with the saltines and put the fish on a greased oven pan and put them in the oven flipping them half way through. They turned out great! Whole family loved them. I made them last week and my husband asked for them again tonight.

simple, tasty, and came out great. used half breadcrumbs/half flour mix which gave it a good flavor. i also chopped the catfish fillet's into about 16 semi-bite sized crispy piece's - I highly recommend.

Delicious! We couldn't use the grill. So I baked them at 450 F for 8-10 minutes (till they were done), flipping them after 5 minutes. Next time we're going to try it for fish tacos. It was a bit too salty. That's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.

This was excellent!!  I have 5 hungry kids at dinner everyday -- and today everyone loved the crispy catfish and even my husband enjoyed it.  This is a recipe we will use hopefully when we are camping too !!  Substituted garlic powder for garlic salt and used Adobo as the seasoning salt - it was fantastic!!

This dish was simple and delicious! I used those premade bread coating instead of finely crushed saltines. Best to eat this with rice or potatoes or something else as it's a little salty.

Was a little skeptical about grilling catfish, but I was looking for something to keep dishes at a minimum...followed the recipe to a "T" and we loved it!!!  Even DH, who wouldn't eat fish unless it was fried for the longest time, raved about it!!!

Sadly I did not have the celery OR seasoned salt so I substituted cajun spices & Old Bay (no garlic/salt). The cracker crumbs are a hit! We made nuggets & pan fried them nice and crispy, which was so so good. Like others suggested, soaked nuggets in milk for about 15mins, this made them juicy. We didn't even use the butter. Loved it! Can't wait to try it with many other spices.

Wonderful! I thought I had purchased catfish, but I actually had bought cod filets. I still used this exact recipe and it was fabulous! Even my 4-year old was asking for seconds. This one is a keeper for sure.

This was pretty good! Per another review's suggestion, I also added come Cayenne pepper to give it a bit more kick. We loved this recipe and will do it again. Oh, one other small change: I used Smart Balance 50/50 spread instead of "real" butter, just to keep the fat intake and calories down a little.

High marks from fussy kids! Like some of the other folks, I soaked my fish in milk for a few hours.  I tried greasing the grill prior to turning on the gas, but I normally have to burn off the stuff from last night's grilling. I was nervous that the coating would stick to the grill. But amazingly, it didn't. Even my husband noticed this. Here are my changes to the recipe: I used 1/2 panko crumbs and 1/2 saltines, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, used celery seed rather than celery salt.  It definitely had enough salt with the crackers and the seasoned salt. Thumbs up!

It was a nice alternative to fried catfish. Will make again. However, it was a bit salty even though I used reduced sodium saltines. Next time I will reduce the salts.

5 stars for easy prep and great taste!  I also soaked my fish in milk (always have) and substituted garlic salt for garlic powder.  I thought the saltines were going to be boring, but I was wrong!  The coating was perfect and I'm definately making this one again.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only thing I did different was to use unsalted Saltines and garlic powder. I did soak the fish in milk for a while before breading as was recommended. I loved the taste but the Catfish I used was too mushy for us so I'll try a firmer fish next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Tried the recipe as-is (but doubled) and it came out great! Will try it with other types of mild white-flesh fish.

Actually 4 1/2 stars because of the ease. I didn't have celery seed so I shopped up celery very small. I was so worried about the salty Saltines issues that I used bread crumbs instead. Took others advice about soaking in milk first, and adding butter as posted.  I used my oven at 450 for about 15 minutes.  Yes, I made some changes but this is what worked for me!

I will never substitute saltines out again!! I was lazy and sub'd in Panko and bread crumbs the first time I made this, but never again. I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars because I had to modify the recipe to cut down on the sodium. First time I made this, it was like eating a salt lick, so now I use crushed celery seed, and garlic powder, but it's still a little salty, so I will also cut back on seasoned salt next time. Also, I cooked this under the broiler, and did not flip them. Note: Do not need to spray pan or fish, THEY ARE COATED IN BUTTER!!!! Learned that one the hard way, and make sure that when you coat your fish that the butter is fairly warm, that way it won't go on too thick. Almost forgot, I don't use catfish, either tilapia or basa (swai).

Wow, I can't believe in all the reviews I read NO ONE mentioned the butter. I've made fish MANY times from many recipes and NEVER have I seen a recipe calling for the fish to be dipped in butter. I thought this a little odd, so right to the reviews I went. And review after review only talked about how scrumptious these were. Ok, full steam ahead, I will follow the recipe as is. Big mistake. The butter ruined the fish. To me, I tasted butter and nothing else. My husband said they were extremely salty. I can see that too but I just couldn't get over the butter taste--way too buttery and not in a good way. Normally, when a dish is this bad, I don't finish it, but I was STARVING when I made dinner so I just pushed one bite down after another. Not to mention the fillets cost 9 bucks! So thanks to all the reviewers on here that raved about this recipe. My dinner was ruined and what a waste of $9. But all is not lost, a lesson was learned for sure, if something doesn't seem right and your better judgement is warning you against it, Follow IT!

Whole family loved it! Made a few changes - used garlic powder to reduce sodium and subbed low fat panko for the saltines. I baked it in a 350 oven for about 25 minutes. This one is a keeper - the butter adds fat (and Flavor!) but I suspect less fat than frying the catfish would have.

Crispy, buttery and delicious!  I used celery seed and garlic powder to cut down on the salt.  This got rave reviews from the whole family.  We also soaked some  wood chips in water, drained them, and put a foil packet with the wood chips directly on the "coals" to add a little smoke.

This is great.  Marinated and cooked on the grill, and everyone loved it.

I have never made catfish before and this recipe rocked it!  Everything was soooo yummy!  The only downside was that it was not spicy enough for our liking so I added more cayenne pepper that called for.  I WILL make this again soon!

I'm not a fish-eater, so this is from my husband's feedback.  He said it was "good, but not 'restaurant-good'."  So that equals about three stars in my book.  I used Ritz-type crackers instead of saltines, and used the seasoning salt and celery salt.  Added garlic powder instead of salt, there was just too many "salts" listed in this recipe in my judgment.  I also soaked the fish in milk several hours before cooking, left out dipping them in oil (since they were already wet from the milk), and pan fried them instead of grilled.   :)

Used Italian bread crumbs because it's what we had on hand.  Also used olive oil instead of butter.  This was AWESOME!
