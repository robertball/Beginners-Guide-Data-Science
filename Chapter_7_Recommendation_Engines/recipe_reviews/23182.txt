This made a really nice "guilt free" dessert especially having used fat free vanilla yogurt!  It would also be great for breakfast.  I used fresh berries instead of frozen and a mix of granola and graham crackers. I also added a little cinnamon in addition to the nutmeg.

This is a standard starter for our 4th of July weekend when it's usually 100 degrees plus!  Light, refreshing and color coordinated to the holiday when using blueberries and strawberries!  Used granola in the layers and crumbled cinnamon graham crackers on top for a little extra goodness! Whole family loves this one!  Thank you Rebecca!

YUM!  Wonderful!  I made this in a single layer and used low fat organic vanilla yogurt, then I layered fresh blueberries and sliced green grapes.  I smashed up some cinnamon low-fat cookies.  3 and 5 year old devoured!  My son called it his "super special breakfast".  ;)

You can make this so many different ways. I had no yogurt, so I put shredded coconut on the bottom, layered with frozen (thawed) mixed berries and whipped topping, topping it off with cinnamon. I made another one using Kashi Crunch cereal in between layers- so good.

This was a perfect lunch for a hot, humid summer here in Hawaii! I always use a mixture of fresh berries. Today I used strawberries and blueberries. I made a single layer starting with low-fat vanilla yogurt, lots of fresh berries and topped it off with granola! It's healthy, fresh, fruity and wonderfully delicious. I was satisfied and feeling "guilt-free".

I found this parfait to be tasty and simple, serving the purpose of being a quick, healthy desert. But, since it's just a bunch of stuff thrown together, I wouldn't call it impressive.

This recipe is great.  I made something similar to this after craving one of those delcious parfaits from mc donalds.  The only exception is instead of using graham crackers on top, I crushed up a granola bar and sprinkled it on top.  I also didn't use the nutmeg.

I knew I would enjoy this, but it was better than expected!  I served it for dessert when a friend came over who is diabetic, and it worked perfectly for him.  I did NOT use the nutmeg, or cinnamon -- instead I took inspiration from a picture and made the middle layer using Mixed Berry yogurt.  This, in combination with the granola and fresh blueberries; sliced strawberries; and raspberries on top, was the perfect amount of flavor, and a beautiful dessert!

Quick simple and very easy recipe.  I did tweak a little as I had fresh strawberries to use, so replaced these with the frozen fruits.  Also added a little crunchy breakfast cereal.  This recipe made one large  serving.

I used a nonfat vanilla yogurt and fresh strawberries. (Fred Meyer has organic strawberries on sale this week.) I did add a tbsp. of flax meal in with the ground cinnamon grahams. My kids inhaled these. Very simple, healthy addition to a summer breakfast.

This was so delicious. On the 1st layer I mixed fat free plain yogurt with agave, then a layer of frozen blueberries. On the 2nd layer, I mixed 1 scoop of protein powder strawberry flavor with plain yorgurt, then covered with Grape Nuts cereal instead of crackers and toped with frozen blueberries again. I kept in the fridge for 1 hour before serving. Thanks for the recipe!

These are so easy to make and my family loves them for late night snack. We now have them at least once a week! 
The only change i made is putting the graham cracker on top of each berry layer. 
This recipe is DELICIOUS :)

This was ok for me. I used fresh strawberries instead of the frozen mixed berries. Next time I will layer the graham cracker throughout and omit the nutmeg as it was a little overpowering for me in those first couple of bites.

This recipe was a hit with young and well not as young in our house.  I used vanilla Greek (fat free) yogurt, cinnamon graham crackers and added a drizzle of honey to each layer.  The frozen mixed fruit had cherries in it and I think this was such a great addition.  We added a dollop of sugar free cool whip to the top and grated fresh nutmeg on the top.  I would definitely recommend adding the nutmeg to EACH layer as it adds something that makes this parfait PERFECT!  Great recipe!

Very simple to make but delicious. My guests raved about it. I used vanilla flavoured balkan yogurt and topped it with candied peanuts which added a nice crunch.

I like vanilla yogurt and I thought the nutmeg was an interesting twist. It kind of reminded me of a baked good after taste with it. I opted for the granola option in the description, as I had made some really good granola from the site. The frozen berries, just did not work for me. I think, I would like to try this again using a homemade blueberry sauce made with fresh blueberries. Thank you for the idea anyway!

Just a thought........I bet it would be good with instant pudding mix's too - in place of the yogurt (for those who don't like yogurt, like my hubby!)

I crumbled graham crackers, and put them on top of each layer. For fruit, I used fresh strawberries that I cut into fourths, blackberries, and blueberries. Overall, a simple but delicious on the go breakfast, or a delicious, and easy to make snack.
