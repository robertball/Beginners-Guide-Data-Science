One of the best recipes I have made for hubby who is not allowed bread, rice or pasta. Loved how tasty the zucchini noodles were with this sauce, and just  needed to add a pinch of salt and pepper. Looking forward to doing this more often leaving out the shrimp and just making this as a side dish......anyway I can get him to eat more vegetables is  a bonus. Thanks for posting this awesome recipe!

Delicious!! I love the dressing with the fresh basil and lemon zest. Only thing is that the prep work for everything took me quite a while so I would set aside 45 min to cook this :)

It was really good, next time I make it I have to remember to squeeze the water out so it comes out much less watery

I have to admit I 'over-toasted' the nuts, so my entire sauce went down the drain.  I used some citrus dressing I had in my refrigerator and so the concept was similar.  It was really yummy.   I also added some chunky peanut butter before serving, which I believe elevated this dish!

We didnt want so much spice so we leave out the Red Chili flakes. My family  enjoys this meal a lot and I like that we can save calories and still be full!

I added salt and just used basil leaves (I am not sure if it would have measured the same or less.)

The pesto is really good.  I used cooked shrimp because it was on sale.  Just heated it up for a couple minutes and tossed with sauce.  I'll be making this again often in the summer when the basil and zucchini are in season.

Love this! I don't have a spiralizer, so I just cut yellow and green zucchini thin. I put in some scallops too and they were AMAZING. Ate it for lunch the next day COLD and it was still awesome! Super fresh and tons of flavor. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. Pesto definitely needed salt though, two pinches, more or less, to taste.

Very nice with zoodles (zucchini noodles cut with a spiralizer) but would be great with regular pasta.  (although zucchini noodles are better for us! :). Be careful with the red pepper flakes and add salt.  Used a little less olive oil.  Would have been even better had I been able to get larger shrimp or prawns.  A nice change of pace and get the kids to make the zoodles and dinner will be ready in no time at all!
