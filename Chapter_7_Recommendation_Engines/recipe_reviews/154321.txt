An excellent twist on an old favorite.  I shortened the cooking time by 2 hrs by using canned black & great northern beans and mixing everying in a stock pot on my stovetop.  My gut also told me the 1/2 cups brown sugar was way too much, so I reduced the amount to 1/4 (not packed).  It's still sweeter than most chilies but adding the vinegar and spices tones this down quite a lot.  My husband loved this and I will definitely make this again.

My family loves this recipe and I took 2nd place in a chili cookoff.  I altered the recipe a little adding only 1 1/2 tablespoons each of chili powder, cumin and cilantro.

this turned out pretty good, I too cut the sugar down to 2 Tablespoons instead of 1/2 cup and I wanted a faster version so I used canned beans,I will make this again.

These are the changes I made to make this a five star ....Used a pound of extra lean ground chicken,  one 14oz can of fire roasted, one 28oz can crushed tomatoes,  2tblspns brown sugar, 1tblspn red wine vinegar,  added 1tblspn dried oregano,  instead of yellow pepper used a diced zucchini.  Otherwise kept all other ingredients the same. I made this on the stove top and it was excellent.  Served with shredded cheddar and some diced avacado. Really a very good chili. Thanks!

Chicken Two Bean Chili Haiku: "Crestfallen chili. Tomato sauce overload. Needed several tweaks." I had such high hopes for this chili, especially since upon walking in the door from work, I salivated at its chirping-in-the-crockpot-all-day  aroma. Unfortunately, I couldn't get over the overwhelming tomato sauce taste. I followed the recipe exactly as written, w/ the exception of using fresh cilantro (1/4 c. finely-chopped) instead of dried, and reducing the brown sugar to 1/4 c. (Although should I make this again, I would probably drop it to 2 TB instead.) For all of the wonderful flavors that went into it, I just tasted what I could only describe as tomato soup w/ chicken and beans. It's a good recipe that just needs a few changes, such as less tomato sauce, or none at all (possibly a small can tomato paste and more chicken stock?) and definitely less brown sugar, to evolve into a great recipe.

I tried this recipe the other night for the first time replacing the canned ingredients for fresh one and ground chicken instead of chunks. I can't believe how simple and amazing this recipe is.

I followed this recipe pretty closely.  I changed the process by sautéing my chicken and then making the rest of the recipe on the stovetop rather than using my crock pot.  I used two cans of Rotel tomatoes, which are a little smaller, and only 3 T. of brown sugar.  I can’t imagine using 1/2 cup!  This turned out very well and we both liked it a lot.  It’s very filling and a nice blend of flavors.  I served mine with a dollop of sour cream and a sprig of fresh thyme.

I wouldn't consider this recipe chili, it is basically tortilla soup.  It was too liquidy to be chili.  It tasted okay, but it ate like soup and if I was in the mood for soup I have other recipes that I like more than this one.

This soup was wonderful!  As suggested, I cut back on the brown sugar and used 1/4 or a little less.  Great leftover, too!

Tried to be true to recipe and make as is.  Started to measure sugar, but it just seemed like way to much.  I cut it to 1/4 cup.  Next time I would omit or use a couple of tbsp.  May have been intended to cut "heat"-may want to use a little less spice? FYI  Trader Joes roasted corn was great for this recipe.  WOULD make again.

Not bad.  I used canned chicken because I was in a hurry and skipped the corn bc we didnt' have any in the freezer like I thought we did.  Bf didn't like the sweetness of this so I'd leave out the sugar next time, but otherwise it was decent enough.  Good for a quick meal, at any rate.  We ate over rice and with a side of mixed veggies.  Thanks for the recipe!

A friend made this chili at a cookoff this summer and won first place!  This was out of 20 types of chili.  I've done the opposite of what others did and added more sugar.

This was very good.
I replaced the bell peppers with celery and grated zuchini for allergy reasons. Added in some cacoa and chilli seasoning and added some polenta as I think I added toomuch water. Used oregano and mixed bottled chillis as I had them round. served with salad and cheese baked nacho chips.

Awesome! I, too, only used about 2 tbsps of brown sugar, and about 1.5 tbsp of Chili powder and only a dash of cayenne. Everything else is the same and it was awesome! Oh, and I used canned beans, /9 it was ready sooner than "4 hours on high." Good stuff!

I used 3 chicken breasts (because I had 3), cut them up and saute'd  them with white onion (did not have red) and garlic in olive oil.  Put all, un-drained into lined crock pot.  (LOVE crock pot liners).  Follow recipe down to tomato sauce.  I had read reviews about too soupy and tomato-y and I had a can of tomato paste with 2 T used.  I wanted to use it so I added it and increased the broth a bit.  Used on 1/4 cup brown sugar, again based on reviews.  Did not have frozen corn so used a can of corn, drained. Put in 1 T of cayenne.  I love spicy.  I had planned to make this a month ago and when I did not get to it, I cut up a green, red and yellow pepper and froze them.  I put 1/2 of the frozen block in the crock pot at the beginning (did not want to bother with adding this later).  The rest of the recipe was as is.  Came out great.  Very spicy.  Served with sour cream to make the mixture more creamy and tone down the spice.  A winner!  Loved it.  PS : to those of you who think we should NOT alter a recipe and just rate it as is-NO WAY!  :)  I have never, ever not tweaked a recipe in some way.  That is the fun of cooking.  Thanks to all for reviews.  They really help!

Great dish in a pinch that can be made the night before and put into a slow cooker. Let it cook on low for as many hours as you can at least 6 or 7

I used what I had in the house for this last minute Crockpot recipe. I had to substitute a few things. I didn't have tomato sauce so I used and extra can of diced tomatoes. I used fresh cilantro and did not have brown sugar, which I didn't want to use anyway as it didn't sound appealing. I didn't have bell peppers but I did have some frozen diced garden peppers, non-bell sweets, and a jalapeno. It is still cooking but it smells and tastes great so far.

This is awesome chili.  I substituted ground turkey but I bet it's great with chicken too.  The flavor is wonderfully complex, first you taste the brown sugar sweetness, the the bell pepper, and finally a touch of heat.   We usually share when I make big pots of chili, but my husband and I ate it all ourselves!!

This was so good!  A perfect balance between sweet and spicy.  The only thing I did differently was cooking it in a dutch oven on the stovetop because I was pressed for time.  Delicious!

I forgot the brown sugar and I thought it was too sweet. Maybe it was too much vinegar? Probably won't make again.

rarely does a whole dutch oven pot of anything get eaten  in one night.  There were only 3 of us.  Before I could get the kitchen cleaned up it was all gone! my husband and dad kept going back to the stove for more.  I didn't even get to take pictures.  A real keeper!!!

Everyone loved this dish. I didn't have green chilies and my daughter hates corn and she isn't a big fan of rice, I substituted with ziti pasta, added cooked at end. I brined chicken beforehand which I highly recommend.

This is a great chili.  I did make it with left over chicken quarters instead of chicken breast.  I do think I would prefer chicken breast as the recipe is written but dark meat is what I had.  Also, I only used a tablespoon of sugar instead of half a cup.  My husband doesn't like sweet chili and this was plenty sweet for us with just one tablespoon.  A couple of my kids loved it too, but the younger ones don't care for spicy foods.  I made it on the stove top and let is simmer for about 30 minutes, instead using a slow cooker.  I can't wait to make it again!

The flavor of this chili is delicious.  I did not make it in a crock pot, rather I made it on the stove.  It really doesn't take very long, just  brown the chicken with the onions and add all the other ingredients.  Bring to a boil, then simmer for about an hour for the flavors to mix.  DONE!

Used a couple of the suggestions.  Sauteed the chicken in a pot, then added onions and peppers, then the rest, and simmered on the stove for a couple of hours. Also reduced the brown sugar to 3 tablespoons and added a small can of tomato paste. Definitely will make this again.

I added a can of dark red kidney beans and used a full can of chicken broth.  I also used an Original can and a Mild can of Rotel.   It came out great.

Great recipe, probably my favorite chili.  Made a few changes, used ground chicken instead of regular chicken, used tomato sauce and did not use  any peppers.....it was fantastic!  I've made it twice this week already.

This chili was excellent and easy to prepare. The only thing I would change is using less brown sugar. It was just a tad too sweet for me.

Delicious!  Definitely has a "kick."  I used 2 TBS brown sugar and got fresh cilantro in error (so just chopped it up and used it).  I served in a bowl on top of white rice, topped with grated sharp cheese, stirred it all up together ... and yum!!!

I turned this into a vegetarian dish by eliminating the chicken and increasing the corn to one can, adding 3/4 cup of uncooked lentils (prepared per package directions) and 1 tsp of anchovy paste. The best chili is made with beef, but this was pretty good.

We  really liked this, even my teenager who usually won't eat chili or soup. It was too sweet though so I will cut the brown sugar in half next time. I left out the bell peppers because I don't care for them.

I made this in a pot on top of the stove and it came out great. I used black and red canned kidney beans along with a can of Mexican style corn.  Like the others I cut back on the brown sugar, 1/3 cup and the other spices, 1.5 Tbsp of each.  I also added mushrooms with the onions and peppers. This is good, I would make it again.

This was very easy and very good!  I don't like bell prettied so I excluded those.  I also didn't have Cheyenne on hand so I used red pepper flakes.  Was just spicy enough and the sweet from the brown sugar is pleasant.  will definitely make again!  Thank you for the recipe!

Too sweet, I'd decrease the amount of sugar greatly in the future. I only used half of the tomato sauce from what was instructed . I had some left-over boiled beans from another meal so I used those beans and added half a cup of its broth and half more of the chicken broth to the mix. Also used fresh cilantro instead, why not? It had good consistency and was an ok meal.

I loved the recipient but the shopping list was inaccurate. It omitted the cayenne pepper and the bell peppers. when making the recipient I did not have those ingredients. Also shredded cheese is always called for as a garnish.

I followed the directions exactly on this one and it came out pretty decent. My boyfriend is a chili snob, and he said this recipe has the right idea but needs less sweet and more spicy. It's not as thick as I prefer my chili, and I would have preferred the chicken shredded rather than cut into chunks, but all in all, it wasn't bad. Putting the bell pepper in at the end left it with a little crunch, and I liked that.

Excellent! Didn't have cilantro but didn't miss it. I also didn't have any issues with it being soupy at all. My husband and three teenage boys all say this should be our new chili recipe, even though my regular one is awesome! Doubled it last time and there was nothing left over :o)

Great chili! I made a couple of changes though. I didn't boil the chicken, I cooked it in a skillet. Since I hate the taste of black beans, I threw in red kidney beans instead. These are real minor changes. Next time and believe me there will be a next time, I will turn the 'heat down'! I used the Rotel tomatoes with green chili peppers, next time I'll use just 1 can of Rotel and the other can will be just diced tomatoes. Thanks Ash and Steve!
