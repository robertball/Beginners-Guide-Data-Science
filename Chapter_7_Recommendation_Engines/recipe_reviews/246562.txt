4.15.16   I had no udon noodles, so I used BarillaÂ® Thick Spaghetti.  The dressing was just a little sweet for us (personal taste preference), and I did add a little bit of sesame oil to the dressing (I would do that again).  A garnish of some chopped peanuts would be nice, and I'll do that in the future.  I thought the amount of cucumbers was disproportionate to the pasta, so I stopped at 1 cuke, and that was more than enough for us.  We love Asian noodle salads, this is a good one, and I definitely would make again.  Nice side dish to Mandarin Orange Chicken.

We loved the combination of ingredients in this recipe and it is great for school lunches but unfortunately the dressing is too thin.   Any suggestions for how to thicken?
