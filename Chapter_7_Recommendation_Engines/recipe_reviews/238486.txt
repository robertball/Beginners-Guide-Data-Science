I love this fresh and satisfying salad and have had it as a side salad and as as a main dish for lunch (keeps well for at least 2 days)!  Simple, inexpensive, quick to put together and it uses ingredients that I always have on hand. The cumin gives it a nice Moroccan twist and because I love cumin, I did add an extra half teaspoon and I might try a pinch of cinnamon next time. I also used green onion instead of the white and will try it with a red onion next time.  This one is a keeper!

Perfect summer salad.  I made this using dried chickpeas that I soaked overnight then boiled in a pressure cooker for 15 minutes instead of canned.  It had a tex-mex taste to it, perhaps the cumin and parsley gave it that twang.  :-)   I tasted it immediately after mixing all the ingredients and then let it sit in the fridge for an hour before serving.  It is definitely much more flavourful after melding.  Its flavour is not overbearing in any way.  I served this with a light quiche type savoury pie and it was a perfect compliment.  I will serve it on a bed of spinach leaves the next time!  Thank you Manella for sharing.

This is a lovely chickpea carrot salad.  Having a daughter who loves chickpeas, I have made many different salads with them.  What makes this salad extra special for us is the addition of fresh parsley to the delicious dressing.  I added extra cumin and red onion for personal preference…. This salad is a great example of simple ingredients coming together for a healthy and tasty dish.  Manella… thank you for sharing...

Great salad !  I followed the recipe exactly. This salad is hearty and light at the same time. It's packed with nutrition, quick to make and with the bonus of keeping well in the fridge.

Really yummy with the cumin and chick peas. I added a little shredded pear for sweetness (raisins in regular food are an abomination) and a little mustard to the dressing. Fresh and easy (with use of shredder setting on cuisinart).

Really good!  I had a similar salad in an ethnic restaurant and have been looking for a good version of the recipe.  I didn't have parsley so used cilantro and it was great with the cumin.   Definitely will make again.  It makes a good lunch, so will probably make it a lot!

This is such an easy, delicious recipe! I made it earlier this week as a side and am going to make it for a Mother's Day BBQ today and a work BBQ tomorrow. It's that good! I did not have cumin on hand and used ground coriander instead. Coriander and parsley together tasted wonderful. Awesome recipe, thanks!

I didn't want to shred the carrots, so I just cut my sweet petits crosswise.  Was great.

This was pretty good. Made it ahead, then paired it at dinner with cold leftover rice for a quick meal. Four-year-old devoured it, two- and one-year-olds thought it was okay.

This sounds perfect! I'm having friends over after work tomorrow, one of whom is a real gourmande, which always makes me nervous (even though I'm pretty good in the kitchen). I'll serve this along with a bruscetta made with sauteed kale and goat cheese. It will be a perfect foil to the spicy-hot kale mixture. Thanks a million!!!
