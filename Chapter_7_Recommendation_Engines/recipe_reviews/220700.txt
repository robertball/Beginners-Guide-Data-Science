Excellent salad recipe--the dressing was one of the best I've ever had. I did not have sherry vinegar, I used equal amounts white wine vinegar. I also used EVOO instead of canola oil. NO leftovers, we ate the whole thing. And by we, I mean myself. I finished what was left in the salad bowl.

I wanted a salad for dinner the other night, but I was tired of our usual chicken.  I made the salad but had to omit the asparagus, as I didn’t have any.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written.  The salad was good and different, but the dressing just didn’t work for me!  As written it was way too tart, and I ended up remaking it, using 1 T. of  vinegar, along with 3 T. of oil, which is a standard vinaigrette.  I ended up using 3 T. of mayonnaise to make it to our liking.  The dressing I made ended up being ok, and we did use it, but I doubt that I’ll be making it again.
