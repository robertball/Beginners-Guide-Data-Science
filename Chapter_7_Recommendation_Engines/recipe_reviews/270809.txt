We live at 6000 feet. Made the recipe as-is and it was ok. The dough was a bit hard to work with. The second time we added a tsp of the sugar to the yeast-water mixture. Much more satiny dough. After rising, we shaped the loaf on an oiled surface, not floured. It worked out better for us. A more fluffy bread. We started with brand new yeast both times. Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious! Super easy and so fun. I substituted canola oil as that was the only oil I had on hand. I will definitely make this again and grab some coconut oil for next time!

Great recipe. I live at 8500 ft. and this turned out wonderful.
I did decrease the yeast by 1/2 tsp. and increased flour and liquid by 2 tbs.
