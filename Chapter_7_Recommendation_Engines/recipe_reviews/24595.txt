Okay, I cheated and used bottled dressing, but no one could tell and they got rave reviews.

I made these mushrooms ahead of time for a Super Bowl Sunday appetizer for my vegetarian mother and then I forgot to set them out! My co-workers were glad because they got to eat them the next day. Everyone enjoyed the flavor and several people asked for the recipe.

These came out really good.  I'm not a big fan of mushrooms but I wanted to try these, knowing if I didn't like them my roomates would eat them.  They didn't even taste like mushrooms!! Yummy!! I didn't have any dry mustard so I left that out, and they still came out good.

Excellent recipe, even my six year old, who does not like mushrooms, loved them.  My only variation was for the 1/3 cup of red wine vinegar, was to add 2/3  of white wine vinegar and 1/3 of red wine to make up the the quantity, (1/3 cup in total) as I did not have red wine vinegar.

Hmmmm.  Fast and easy and good.  If you like mushrooms, you'll like this.  Except for extra garlic, I followed the recipe and will prepare this one again.

Quick, easy and flavorful.  I snacked on them before I even had the chance to serve it the next day!  It taste great chilled.  A very refreshing recipe.

We LOVE these marinated mushrooms.  I've been using this recipe for years, it used to be my Mom's too.  She actually got this recipe from a restaurant up the street where they served them.  Sometimes she used tarragon vinegar.  I use natural apple cider vinegar.  It doesn't matter what kind you use they are great and there are no strong spices that people might not like.   Thanks for posting this.  I lost my recipe a long time ago and was worried about not finding it.  I could tell by the picture that this was the one.

These are an awesome addition to my recipe collection!!  I am one of the idiots that buys the little jars of marinated mushrooms that cost a fortune and don't last long.  Thanks so much!!!  My ONLY regret is that I didn't double the darn batch!!

Exactly what I was looking for. I made the mushrooms for a party, and had to run out for more ingredients because I couldn't stop "sampling" while they were marinating!

Oh my gosh these are so good.  For those of you that said it was too much vinegar you probably didn't simmer them long enough for the vinegar to simmer away. I doubled everything except the onions but I will make this next time we barbeque steak, wonderful side dish.  Just happened to have mushrooms sitting in the fridge and didn't want them to spoil so I tried this recipe and am glad I did.

These are seriously addictive and habit-forming...beware!  I halved baby bella mushrooms and used white balsamic vinegar since that's what I had in the cabinet.  There was plenty of juice left over that was perfect sopped up with bread.  I made these for an antipasto platter, and will be making them again for snacks, gifts, lunch...well, you get the idea.  :-)  I never really liked the prepared mushrooms from the deli, but this recipe has converted me.

Yum! Yum! Yum! I love just about any mushrooms, but these are fantastic. I was out of red wine vinegar and white onions, so I substituted balsamic vinegar and red onions. It was out of this world! I will be making this again soon! Thank you so much for my new go-to sauteed mushroom recipe!!!!

these were great!  i'm not a fan of mushrooms on their own - i always have to pair them with something.  so, i used this recipe to marinate about a pound of white mushrooms, let them rest in fridge for a day, and then cooked them on kabobs with chicken and veggies - it was so good!  i will definitely make these again!

I have been looking for the marinated mushroom recipe for a long time and finally found it. I used Balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar because I didn't have it. I also added 1/4 cup honey and 2 Tbsps soy sauce. Even my husband who usually do not touch mushrooms ate a lot.

This recipe was so easy to put together. It saved me a lot of time being able to do it the night before my party. They really do keep for a long time in the fridge and taste even better the more the mushrooms sit in the sauce. I only had balsamic vinegar on hand but I loved the subtle sweetness it gave to the mushrooms. I forgot to put the mushrooms out as apps and ended up serving them with dinner. Perfect compliment to a fall meal. Thank you for the great family recipe!!

I agree - these are too sweet and not salty enough as is.  After a couple of days I brought some wine vinegar to a boil with a few more cloves of garlic-minced, some red pepper flakes, salt and just a smidge of olive oil.  After it cooled, I poured in about another cup.  The taste was immediately improved.  I am putting these in little jars to put in gift baskets.

A wonderful recipe :)! I didn't have dry mustard so I used prepared mustard instead and the recipe still turned out great.  1 teaspoon of dry mustard equals 1 tablespoon of prepared mustard

This was really good!  The only change I made was that I did not have parsley on hand and used italian seasoning instead and was very tasty.

This is nice tangy dish with flavors I really enjoy. I used a sweet Vidalia onion and large 'stuffer' mushrooms which I quartered. This works well as an appetizer served with with crusty French bread. next time I think I'll cut back a little on the onion and throw in some other fresh herb or capers.

This was fantastic! I made this recently for a gathering and was lucky to have any left for my guests (had to write a "don't touch" message on the container to stop myself eating them all! All my guests raved about them and they all want the recipe.  I can't believe they were soooo easy.  Will definitely make again and again!

Sometimes I treat myself to the expensive marinated mushrooms at the deli. Not anymore! These are so good. I didn't find them too vinegary as some other reviewers stated they had. Thank you for sharing your Grandmothers recipe.**Update: I chose a stuffed mushroom recipe to serve at our Christmas dinner. My son and his girlfriend both said they were disappointed as they were so looking forward to having these "scrumptious little babies" I won't replace them again.

This is a great recipe!  I didn't have any dried parsley and so I used dried dill which I prefer in any case.  I initially made the single recipe but tripled it the next day for an upcoming dinner party.  You won't be disappointed! Cristi White...does your Grandma have any other family recipes to share?

Very good.  I only simmered the mushrooms for 2 minutes, then put the lid on the pan and let them 'steam' for 5 minutes because mushrooms cook in a very short time.  I have found that if I cook them too long they loose some of the mushroom flavor.

I bought a bag of mushrooms on sale this week for 1.49/lb. without even knowing what I was going to do with them. We just love mushrooms:) I found this recipe and had all the ingredients so I thought I'd give it a try.....these are absolutely delicious!!!! I can't wait to make them for company or to take to work. I will definitely double this next time around. Just wish I knew for sure how long they kept in the fridge as I don't can......but my mom does so this may turn into a summer project:)Thank you so much for sharing!! My husband thanks you also:)

Didn't care so much for these. Way too much vinegar. Two stars because my husband threw them on the grill which saved them and made them edible.

made these twice now and they came out great both times.  I can taste the mustard, so I might experiment with leaving it out or substituting hot sauce as a variation.  Worked really well with pre-sliced baby portobella mushrooms, with the advantage being they were finished faster.

Good. But next time I'll use a little less vinegar and oil. I had to add flour to thicken it up.

Good!  These grew on me.  The more I ate, the more I liked them.  One daughter liked them, but the other 2 in the family, not so much.  I'd make again either for company, or a half recipe.

Delighted to get this marinated mushroom recipe because I was getting very tired of my others. Do a lot of entertaining in the winter and always looking for new nibbles - this one really is popular. Thanks for submitting

I made this omitting the sugar and I'm glad I did.  I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes and oregano.  It was still missing something, I can't put my finger on it yet.  Overall this is very good and I recommend it highly!  Thanks.

I made this recipe as is written and I'm glad I didn't mess with it!  These are DELICIOUS!!  We had them for an appetizer (everybody convenes in the kitchen!  I wonder why?) while I was cooking Easter dinner.  My son, another foodie, commented that they would be WONDERFUL on my homemade pizza!  Hmmmm.... and the longer they sit in the fridge, the more flavorful they get!  Gonna use this recipe when 'shrooms go on sale, that's for sure... a good way to preserve them for use later!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe for our Xmas pot luck lunch and rec'd many compliments.
I took the suggestion by another poster and cooked the mushrooms for 2 min and then simmered for 5 min. Need to double the recipe for next year's gathering I was told.

I substituted Splenda for the brown sugar & my husband thought the recipe was too sweet!  I think they taste vinegary though.  Anyway, I served some to a friend, & she rated them "perfect."  I'd recommend making them the day before serving as they get better as they marinate.  You may want to take them out of the frig a little ahead of time before serving as sometimes the olive oil solidifies in the frig.

EXCELLENT! This sure was a crowd favorite! I made these for an 80th birthday party and they were the first things to go. I thought the vinegar was too tangy so I poured out some of it and added soy sauce to taste. I didn't have any dry mustard, but added a couple drops of hot sauce instead. I made these a couple days in advance and each day they got better. I used 4 boxes of fresh mushrooms. They were a huge hit, especially with all the men that are "hunters and fishermen". I will make these again!!

These mushrooms were good.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it.  We did leave out the dry mustard since we did not have that and used splenda instead of the sugar.

I made the recipe as is except for the parsley, which I forgot at the store. Everyone loved it! By the time I was able to try some appetizers at Easter, there were only a few left. Next time I'll double the recipe.

Very tasty.   Costco used to sell a brand of marinated mushrooms that were my favorites, which of course meant they discontinued carrying them.  This recipe comes closest to the taste that I loved.

Yum, I had some shrooms that I didn't use and wanted a recipe to use them up.  I didn't have red wine vinegar and really didn't want to buy just for this, so I used white wine vinegar.  Better than the ones I bought from the store.

These were really good! I made at the last minute before having parents over for dinner and was worried that they wouldn't be very flavorful as they hadn't had much time to marinade, but they were really good with only about an hour in the fridge. Even better today. I didn't have dried parsley, so used Italian seasoning instead. Will make again!

I made this for a Halloween potluck and it was a hit. I thought I had made enough for leftovers, but not the case. Not a mushroom left! This is really easy to put together and you can make it well in advance. This will be on my Thanksgiving menu for sure.

Very close to the jarred one. I used portobella mushrooms that I quartered. I used roasted garlic grapeseed oil and skipped the garlic. i didn't have any dried mustard so I added some brown mustard. I will make this again.

Lovers of very tangy, zesty, pickle-y mushrooms will like this. I had never tried marinated mushrooms before, so it was a new taste for me. I probably will not make this again - not because it's a bad recipe, but simply because I found the vinegar flavor too strong for me, and it's not a taste I've acquired. I would like to note that I made this a day in advance, so it might have tasted better/milder on the day it was made (rather than sitting in the marinade for over 24 hours).

These came out great!  If you love marinated mushrooms, make these, at a fraction of the cost of the ones from the appetizer section.

Very yummy!  I kinda eyeballed the ingredients and didn't have parsley so I used 2/3 dried rosemary and 1/3 dried oregano. I was surprised at how sweet it was (although I may have put a little extra sugar than called for) but it was sweet in a GOOD way, that went with the earthiness of the mushrooms.  Thanks for this recipe!

Thank you Ms Zbella for submitting this fantastic recipe.  When ever I see a recipe that has been handed down in the family, I am drawn to it.  I made it as an appetizer for an informal dinner party, and everyone raved about it.  I have made it at least a dozen times since.  Every time someone tries it, they ask for the recipe.  I have added a few more herbs of choice, oregano, thyme and dill.  But its wonderful as is!  Also, if you cook it down and carmalize the mushrooms, the sauce then becomes thick and mellow and makes a great hot side dish!  Awesome!!

I used button and crimini mushrooms. I cut the big ones into 4 pieces for easier eating. The only thing extra I added was cut up marinated red peppers for color and taste. Excellent!

Oh wow these things were awesome.  I did double the marinade ingredients (except garlic since I was using pretty large cloves) because I didn't think it would be enough for a pound of mushrooms.  It turned out perfectly and I'm already thinking about who I can make these for as gifts.  I also used fresh parsley because I had that on hand.

VERY flavorful!!!  I took a dish to work and they disappeared in seconds.  Everyone wanted the recipe. For a different gift, I put these mushrooms in a quart Mason canning jar (the recipe is a perfect fit) in a basket with crusty bread, pasta, cheeses and a jar of homemade sauce.  I include the recipe for the mushrooms, since it is always requested.

These were pretty good, the one thing I would change next time is to cut down on the vinegar a little bit- they were pretty stout.  Also, I used the pre-made minced garlic, so I threw in a little garlic salt to enhance the garlic flavor.

Not to put too fine a point on it, but these were terrible.  Waaaay too sweet. I added more vinegar, more spices and hot sauce in an attempt to fix these mushrooms, but in the end was still disappointed that I'd wasted food.

These were really good and easy to make! The combination of ingredients came together for a delicious marinade. Much better than more expensive store-bought ones. Mushrooms shrink down so much after cooking, so I'm glad I made a full batch! I could not find button mushrooms when I needed them, so I used the larger ones and just sliced into smaller pieces (half white, half baby portabello). I had some while warm, but I'm sure they will be much better after being chilled. Cristi, thanks to you and your Grandma for a great recipe that I'm sure to make again!

I doubled the recipe, and I did add sliced, baby peppers. Smells and looks great.  I made them about a week ago. We both like them, but would like a little more zing. I like to try the recipe without too many variations the first time, but I'll add extra garlic and maybe a little hot pepper next time.

I tried these again, still cant find dry mustard powder here (Mexico-ugh--anyone know a substitute I could use??).  I made a kilo (2.2 lbs.)mushrooms, changed the serving size to accommodate this weight and followed the ingredient changes.  Great recipe!  Thank you!

This was good. I had to use rice vinegar because that's all I had on hand. I love mushrooms but I felt that this was lacking something - something bulky. I think next time I'd throw in some grape tomatoes.

I decided to use this recipe since I had all the ingredients in the house, and quite a few leftover mushrooms from a previous trip to the store. I made 2 additions to the marinade: ½ tsp red pepper flakes, and ¼ tsp. dried thyme. I discovered too late in the game that my garlic clove had been used already, so I pinch hit with powdered garlic ( used a healthy ½ tsp.) The recipe is super simple, and packs a lot of flavor. Best to let them site at least overnight so your mushrooms have the chance to really mingle with all the ingredients. This would be a great side on a buffet, or to set out as an appetizer  (although I am sitting here snacking on them for lunch). Bon appetite!

Add a pinch of red pepper flakes or a few drops of hot pepper sauce for a real pop in flavor. I add favorite herbs while the mushrooms marinate in the jars - bay leaves, rosemary, etc. Very versatile and can be tailored to individual taste. This makes a great appetizer with martinis!

This was wonderful! It definitely needs to have some time after cooking for the vinegar taste to subside, and I added just about 1/8 teaspoon of horseradish for a little kick, but followed the rest of the recipe completely. I placed it on a bed of chopped iceberg and baby spring lettuces with a little diced tomato on top for color. My husband was pretty unsure about this one, but ended up liking it very much. Will do again soon - thanks for the recipe!

I'm giving a 4 because I changed the recipe slightly. added 1/2t fresh grnd pepper, 1T each of parsley and thyme and an extra garlic clove. I only had 1/2 pound of mushroom.  After 2 hours in the fridge they taste great. If you think they are to vinegary use rice wine vinegar instead. I thought the red wine worked great. Thanks for the great recipe. Taking it to a dinner party tonight on an antipasto plate.

I accidentally put an extra tablespoon of brown sugar in.  They were good, but not a lot of flavour to them.  Mine didn't turn out vinegary like other reviews have stated.

I was really hoping to like these, but I didn't and neither did my husband.  Too vinegary tasting.  I think next time I'll cut back on the vinegar and try adding more herbs.

These were good but not the best I've ever made. The recipe is simple enough to follow and easy enough to make, and the mushrooms do come out tasting good... btu they're missing something. Don't know if I'd make these again.

Not quite what I was hoping for. Tasted too much like vinegar. And I love vinegar, so I don't know.

I thought these mushrooms were good but they were not quite what I expected. I am looking for a zestier recipe.  However, I will say that they were even better cooked!  Yum!  I am going to keep searching for what I am looking for.

I had medium/large button shrooms I had to use, so I quartered them for this recipe. I cooked the marinade in a wider pan, so I had to add 1/3 cup water, but when jarring, wished I hadn't because it was too much liquid. I followed Wilemon's advice of simmering the shrooms for 2 min, then "steaming" for 5 min, and my shrooms had a great consistency.
Next time I'll reduce the parsley as it seemed there was too much, and maybe mix a different vinegar with the red wine vinegar, because I thought the taste was a bit strong.

When I first assembled these, I thought I wasn't going to like the recipe:  they seemed oily and too spicy.  The secret is to really let them marinade (I made them 2 days in advance) - when the flavors blend and mellow, they are really great!  I had to use white wine vinegar, and it was fine - I used a bit more than called for since it was a mild vinegar.  I will make these again.

Everyone loved these. I simmered for the full 12 minutes and then refrigerated overnight. The vinegar wasn't overpowering to me, as some reviews have stated. Great cold appetizer!

I also used a fat free italian and added more vinegar, I let them marinate for 24 hours and felt like they could have soaked more.

I can't believe how easy this was to make -- tastes every bit as good as the ones you get from the deli. I forgot it was simmering and left it on the stove for about 30 minutes longer than called for, but the mushrooms (I just used brown button ones) still had good texture and weren't too soggy. Guests couldn't believe it was homemade!

I didn't really like these as much as I thought I would, judging by the rave reviews.  The taste of the red wine vinegar overpowered everything else...in a bay way in my opinion.
I'm giving 2 stars because they're worth a second try with MUCH LESS VINEGAR!
Thank you for the recipe though!

I served these mushrooms at a dinner tonight and they were gone! Everyone raved about them. I said that I was thinking about canning them and giving them as Christmas gifts, and everyone wants to be on my list! I didnt change a thing on the recipe. Need I say more?

I could eat the whole pound of these mushrooms in one sitting! So delicious. The only modification I made was one teaspoon of brown sugar instead of one tablespoon, just because the biggest complaint from other reviewers was about the sweetness. These would be delicious sliced up on an italian sub, or served alongside an antipasto platter (great football game day idea...) 10/19 They are even better on day two! I wish I had made more. My boyfriend loves them too!

I doubled the recipe for my Italian Buffet Party and they the first thing to go. Everyone kept coming back and getting another one and another one and another one. The men said they couldn't stop eating them. Very simple and easy to prepare and great for a crowd. Would make these again in a second.

This is a great basic marinated mushroom recipe. I used flavored olive oils I mixed garlic and herb oils to measure the 1/3 cup. I used white balsamic mixed with some red balsamic to = 1/3 cup. I added some other dried herbs like thyme oregano,  basil, and red pepper flakes to the boil. I doubled the garlic and used a shallot for my onion. The possibilities are endless changing up oils and vinegar and herbs. I tossed fresh chopped parsley in the end after cooking for 10 minutes.

First, the marinade is too oily and not enough for a pound of mushrooms.  I did a ratio of 2:1 vinegar to oil, and essentially doubled the recipe for 8 oz of mushrooms.  It’s ok, but needs some “doctoring”.

Fantastic! Will definitely make again. It'll seem like there isn't enough liquid, but there is. The mushrooms will release water. Just stir often. Make sure this simmers the full amount of time to mellow the vinegar. Next time I'll halve the sugar and add some red pepper flakes and extra garlic. They're not necessarily sweet as written, but I think I'd prefer them a bit more savory. Don't skip the mustard! So glad I finally know how to make these!

Perfect as appetizer and later used remainder on a salad and the dressing worked perfect for a veggie salad. A keeper

Meh.  Too much red wine vinegar and the oil didn't absorb properly while cooking.  Obviously I would use less red wine vinegar next time.  It was too vinegary for me.

Absolutely delicious! I used crimini mushrooms quartered, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. So delicious and I had enough marinated to used as a salad dressing with the mushrooms as a topping. Amazing!

I never liked mushrooms in the past but had leftovers after using some in a recipe. These are now one of my favorites AND the bonus...this is a healthy recipe that works well with my diet! I used dijon mustard instead of the dry and dried minced onions.  SOOOO yummy!

AMAZING! From the smell of them while they were cooking, I thought they would be too sour from the vinegar, but I was wrong. My husband is happy I found this recipe!

I made this with a mushroom medley, Portabella, Oyster, Maitake and button.  I also used a shallot. turned out awesome. When your picky 8 y.o. likes them and asks for more you know you have something there. Will definitely make them again.

I make it often.  I used rice vinegar, cut the oil down by 
half and replaced it with soy sauce.  I used a lot more garlic,
usually the "elephant garlic" which is milder.  I increased the 
mustard to taste, and finally added some (preferably fresh)
grated ginger (1 tsp))

As written, it was to oily. My changes increased my rating from 3.5 to 5.  You can use other mushrooms including baby portobello,  or even larger ones cut to bite sized.  Be creative.

3.5 stars as written, 5 as adjusted.

I followed the recipe almost exactly and they were fantastic. I substituted one tablespoon of agave syrup for the brown sugar because that's what I had on hand. Next time (and there will be a next time) I'll use brown sugar and see if I notice a difference. I can't imagine they could taste any better than these though. Yum, yum!

Yum!  Followed closely but didn't have just plain parsley so used dried Italian seasoning.  Also added a pinch of red pepper flakes. This will definitely go on my shortlist

Recipe is delish!  I added 1/2 tbsp of Italian seasoning and lessened the mustard a little.  I sautéed and refrigerated a few days beforehand.  On the day of I threw the mushrooms in the slow cooker on low until ready to serve.  I did this for Thanksgiving and now have been asked to bring it for Christmas.  Really easy, really good! Thank you!

Fantastic recipe! The red wine vinegar really gives the mushrooms a great punch. I used quartered baby Bella mushrooms because that's what I had on hand, other than that I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing! Will definitely be making this again.

I thought  these were just okay.  After all was said and done, marinating mushrooms with a bottle of Italian dressing would have worked equally well.

These are so good, I make them just for myself and end up eating all of them in less than 24 hours. I never have red wine vinegar on hand, so I cheat and substitute apple cider vinegar and add a splash of red wine. I also don't have ground mustard, so I add in a dollop of dijon. I don't think you can mess up this recipe as long as you use some type of garlic, oil, vinegar, sugar and salt. Love them!

Excellent recipe - I let them simmer too long on my second batch which allowed too much of the vinegar to evaporate so the oil hardened around the mushrooms in the fridge. They still tasted great but they looked a little yucky.  If you follow the cooking time, they turn out great everytime! Thanks for sharing.

I just made these tonight and it's the first ever recipe I've done, I have to say that I'm very pleased with the results. I started making it with low expectations considering it's my first dish I've ever made, but I'm very happy they turned out the way they did. It had sort of a nutty flavor to it and my mom, brother, and I all loved them. I'll definetly make these again.

Delicious addition to the antipasto platter I served for a party.  Only changes made were to use fresh parsley (6 T) and to half the mushrooms because they were too large.

I used green onion, about four. I only used a pinch of sea salt, crimini mushrooms and I used Splenda brown sugar blend. This went really well with the Pepperoni Stuffed Zucchini and I think that if I wanted to another time, I could sub balsamic vinegar for the red wine, if I'd had different sides. As is, I thought it was great. My only issue is there seemed to be too much "dressing". I'd cut the vinegar and oil down to half next time. My family.....we'll.....more for me! Mushrooms are really low in carbs.

Very good the first day, excellent the second. The only thing I did differenly was to leave out the salt. I did consider reducing the brown sugar but I'm glad I decided not to. Thank you so much Cristi.

We made these for a New Year's Eve party and brought them in a mini crock pot to stay warm. They were a hit! At the grocery store we didn't see the "small" size fresh mushrooms called for in the recipe, and bought regular-sized mushrooms. The vinegar and oil, when put into a saucepan, didn't seem like enough to cover the mushrooms, so we doubled the marinade. This recipe is delicious! We will make this again... today in fact, for a New Year's Day luncheon.

I was in a hurry getting ready for a party and made this up using canned Campignons (tiny mushrooms)  and it worked like a dream!  I've had quite a few requests for the recipe. Definately a 'keeper'!

Perfect! So simple and quick. I never realized it'd be this easy to make marinated mushrooms. Exactly like the kind you buy in the jars, but sooo much cheaper!

For whatever reason, this recipe did not go over well. I made it as a "pitch-in" item for our family Thanksgiving dinner, and most of it was left. My husband and I thought that it was fair at best. For the record, I followed the recipe to the letter.

simple. tasty, not too oily. A snap to make. A classic addition to anti-pasta platters. My only swap is to use fresh chopped parsley (3x amount listed on recipe), and a tiny pinch of oregano (just under 1/4 tsp.)

Really yummy and very easy to make.  Next time I'll only use half the sugar though, it was a little overpowering.

These are awesome!  I didn't have button mushrooms so I just cut my large mushrooms in halves and quarters.  Took me 10 minutes.  They can be an appetizer, or serve hot for a nice side dish.

really good flavor.  Make sure to make them ahead of time though because right off the stove they are too vinegary.  Once they've cooled and set though but better taste. I gave only 4 stars due to they are best after just refrigerated over night.  I didn't care as much for them after they had been in the fridge a couple days.

I read all the reviews and was excited to try this recipe. Maybe too excited. I followed the instructions exactly, and the result was an odd concoction of tangy and sweet that seemed "off." Granted, I tried them after they cooled for only a few hours, so maybe in a couple days the flavors will mellow and blend better, but for now, I am disappointed.

Very good, I'm making several more batches of this today to can for family Christmas baskets.  The only thing I'm going to do different is halve the onion amount.  Not being a real onion person myself, a lot of it got thrown away after we picked out the mushrooms and I don't think it will make a huge difference in the marinating flavors.  Very good and it's a keeper for us!

Double the amount of marinade for 1# of mushrooms. Not enough liquid for simmering in the original recipe.

A couple of bites were okay, but this was really very strongly flavored (mostly tasted like vinegar) and did not go over very well. Needless to say, we had a LOT left over and we're not sure what to do with it.

I have had many compliments on this. It's only 4* because they must be made exactly right as a slight variation could throw off the balance.  Use a fresh garlic clove for best flavor.

These are absolutely wonderful.  My whole family really enjoyed them and everyone wanted the recipe.  I didn't change the recipe at all though I did make them a day or so early which gave them more time to soak up the flavor.  Thanks!
