This is my recipe, and a couple options had been left out when it was kitchen approved. I use red wine instead of the vinegar, and I usually use garbanzo bean flour for thickening instead of corn starch. The garbanzo bean flour adds protein and other nutrients to the gravy, and the corn starch is generally made from GMO corn which I avoid. I also sometimes use chopped frozen tomatoes from our garden instead of canned tomatoes. Tomatoes that we don't use soon enough are cored and frozen for use in pot roast and tomato soup. I always use more than 1 garlic clove because we like garlic - usually at least 3-4. I also add more than a pinch of the seasonings. The recipe is great as listed, but I thought I would add a few more options. It freezes well for future meals, and tastes as good as when it was freshly made.

I have also made this recipe in a pressure cooker that cuts down on the cooking time. The only difference is that the meat is pressure cooked for about 45 minutes, do a quick release of the pressure, add the veggies,  pressure cook for an additional 15 minutes, and quick release the pressure.  Remove the roast and veggies and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Strain the remaining liquid into a fat separator, wait for the fats to raise to the top, and put the liquids and strained onions back into the pressure cooker to make the gravy. Mix 1/4 cup water and a couple tablespoons of  corn starch and add to the liquids for thickening. By using a pressure cooker, the roa

I used sweet red wine in place of the vinegar, and cooked the in a crock pot for 8 hours, I put the veggies in at the 4 hour point. I followed the recipe except for the changes mentioned. When I tasted the broth on the stove top before putting it in the crock pot I knew I had hit a home run with this recipe. It is a good thing that I took the picture before dinner because there was no left over meat and veggies. I will be freezing the left over broth and using it for french onion soup. Thank you for the recipe.

Wow!! I have tried many pot roast dishes, most with a mono-tone beef flavor, which is good, but very plain.  This one is different in a very good way.  What intrigues you is the sweet (brown sugar) and sour (vinegar) components.  In my case I used apple cider vinegar which I feel worked very well. (To me red wine vinegar may be a little too sharp) A deft hand is needed with the sweet and sour flavors, however, more is NOT better.  Don't over-do the spices either.  I didn't use celery at all. Also didn't fuss with adding spices and mushrooms at the end, I added it all in the beginning.  I also worked in some "Demi-Glace Gold" to boost the beefy flavor, Yum! My family was overwhelmed with good flavor.  This is a keeper. ~~Donald.

Delicious!  I converted this to a crockpot.  I seared the beef in bacon grease then put in a slow cooker and topped with everything else, and just omitted the corn starch step.  Used sweet potatoes in place of white.  LOVE IT!!

I've been hunting for a good pot roast recipe and this one is the best.  I'll be making it again because it's "company-worthy."  I used fire-roasted diced tomatoes instead of the regular ones.  Also, I didn't drain them; I put them in juice and all.  I don't know if that made a difference with the gravy at the end.  I thought it was a little runny, but it was a nice addition to the roast.  I also cooked the potatoes for 45 minutes, not 30 minutes as the recipe suggested.  I was glad I did because anything less than 45 minutes and the potatoes wouldn't have been fully cooked.

This is one of the best pot roasts I have made. Very tender with great flavor. I used wine instead of vinegar as the recipe author suggested in her review. I also added peas instead of potatoes since I serve always serve pot  roast with mashed potatoes. The herbs and wine really enhance the flavor.

I used a little red wine instead of vinegar, and it tasted great.  The only think I would do differently next time is skim some fat off.  Maybe that was implied, or I missed it.

My very picky mother, who critiques everything I make, said it was possibly the best roast she's ever had. 'Nuff said. I don't change a recipe unless I have to, so I made it as-is except I had to use onion powder because my husband had (to my surprise) used the last onion. I also added the carrots to the pot at the beginning and I'm glad I did- they were perfect. Excellent :)

This was my first pot roast and i made a few changes because of what i had on hand...it was delicious!  I used Montreal steak seasoning on the meat, tomato sauce, real tomatoes and chicken stock and it turned out more like a stew.  i didn't use the cornstarch or mushrooms because i didn't have either.  the meat fell apart after 3 hours and i put it on the stove and added the potatoes and carrots.  the flavor is delicious!

Burgandy instead of red wine vinegar, 1# small carrots, 1# sliced mushrooms, 1# small red potatoes 6 bay leaves  and the other items listed...I put everything my dutch oven at the beginning...when it came time to thicken the gravy I used wine to put the argo in instead of water....300 F. for 5 1/2 hours...potatoes and carrots were al dente...it was awesome!!!

Yummy! I made this in a cast iron Dutch oven as suggested by the author. I made a few minor changes in preparation, but mostly stayed true to the recipe. First of all, I was out of carrots, so I left them out and added some extra potatoes. 
Second, my family doesn't like mushrooms, so I left those out as well.
After browning the meat and cooking the onions/garlic, I added the broth and only half of the red wine & brown sugar called for and brought it to a simmer. Then I added the corn starch and whisked well and let it simmer for a minute before adding the bay leaves, lots of salt & pepper, and big dashes of the herbs. I returned the meat, added the potatoes and put the lid on and put in the oven. My roast was only a bit over 2 ½ pounds, so I only cooked for 3 ½ hours. The meat was perfectly fork tender and the sauce was delicious! We served this a side of steamed broccoli. Delish!

Wouldn't change a thing! i had to hurry the meal up a bit so I modified the cook time (and temp).  The meat was very tender even cooking at 325 vs. 300. Here's what I did: preheated the oven @ 375, then lowered it to 325 and let it cook for about 3 1/2 hours before adding the carrots. To help the potatoes along, I removed them after about 20 min in the oven and microwaved them for about 4-5 min. just before serving.  The kitchen smelled so good!

This recipe was excellent! I made it a tad bit too sweet so I would stick to the recipe for the amount of brown sugar. I omited the tomatoes. The gravy was excellent! I used a dutch oven. I'll definately make this one again!

I followed the recipe pretty much; I used wine instead of vinegar and I didn’t bother thickening it up at the end...there wasn’t much liquid left to thicken! I did do one thing differently; I raised the cooking temperature to 325...the first time I made it, the meat was not tender enough. Taste-wise, however, this is the best roast I’ve ever had, hands down! I would even make this for company, it’s that good!!!

Made this pot roast today in a cast iron dutch oven and it was fork tender and delicious!  3# boneless Chuck roast. Added Chianti in place of vinegar, 5 cloves of garlic and Beef Better Than Bouillon For the beef broth. Used frozen fresh tomatoes (diced) in place f canned. I omitted adding salt as bouillon is salty.  It was fork tender at 2.5 hrs. Removed from oven, brought to boil and added carrot chunks. Returned to oven and carrots were Done in less than 30 minutes. For gravy, I used Wondra flour and water mixture for thickening, added tsp basil and 1/2 tsp thyme and a cup of potato water. 
This recipe is really the best pot roast I’ve made.  Definitely my ‘go to’ from now on!

It was fine, but too tomato-y for my tastes. While I love tomato sauce, I’m more of a brown-gravy type when it comes to pot roast.

Best pot roast & gravy I've EVER made on Allrecipes!! Only change is I just made the pot roast. The gravy I made from one cup of the stock mixture (and stock is a must) and a packet of brown gravy for speed. My partner said it was best roast and grave I had ever made (and I've made a lot). The entire technique is perfect (I seared for about 4-5 per side) and don't fret over the red wine vinegar. Great subtle addition!  My chuck roast was small 2.75 lbs, so I roasted for 3.5 hours and let rest for 15 while I made the gravy. Truly perfect recipe and method! It's so wonderful, I came back 3 days later to save the recipe and write a review!

This was wonderful!  I made only minor changes: I used fresh mushrooms, doubled the garlic and upped the seasonings a bit - maybe two pinches, instead of one.  Thanks!

This was a great recipe. Next time I will omit vinegar and tomatoes to reduce acidic flavors - and make it more similar to the pot roast my mom used to make on the stove. I might try a little red wine instead. Made it with a three pound chuck roast, lots of potatoes and carrots. So tender and flavorful.

This is the BEST roast I've ever made!!! Beef chuck roast is a must, as the fat adds so much flavor to the sauce. I don't have a Dutch oven so I browned the meat in a skillet and placed into a roaster with the beef stock mixture. Leary about the vinegar, but it adds so much to the flavor and tenderizes the beef. I make this the night before and roast the next day, adding carrots with an hour and a half to spare on cooking time. I make mashed potatoes and leave the drippings "as is." My family can't get enough! Thank you for this great recipe.

I added onion soup mix as my only change. My husband is a food snob. He said it was the best pot roast he's ever had. And that it was "restaurant quality" which doesn't always sound like a compliment to me, but it is his highest praise. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I used red wine instead of vinegar, but otherwise cooked exactly as described.  That sauce is unbelievably good and the beef just fell apart.  It went straight into the family recipe collection.   Loved it!

Very yummy. I tried another AllRecipes recipe for pot roast before this one and this takes the cake. The tomatoes and brown sugar adds just the right amount of sweet to the savory. I used Yukon Gold potatoes, but other than that followed the recipe as is.

This was fabulous. I followed another reviewer and cooked at 325 for 3.5 hours because I was short on time, skipped the mushrooms, used wine in lieu of the vinegar because I didn't have any, and just threw the carrots and potatoes in the pot for the last hour. It was great, my husband had thirds, that sauce is divine!

Can't wait to make this again! Fabulous! I didn't have carrots or potatoes and I don't like mushrooms. I followed all the other directions. When the gravy/sauce was finished, I cleaned the roast and it put back in the pan. I let it simmer and set while I cooked the noodles. SO good! Leftovers are bound to be amazing! Next time I will use carrots, I think they'll add even more to the flavor.

Great recipe!  Made two batches in two crock pots for a family dinner of 10. After the meat was in the crock pot and cooking, I prepared the vegetables and then put  them in the crock pot.  Everything tourned out perfect.

My 4 pound roast was tender after 3 hours.  Can use fresh mushrooms.  3-4 garlic cloves is better.  Do not use more brown sugar than recipe suggests, even with 1 Tbsp, gravy was slightly sweet.  Will make again definitely and even add more of the seasonings next time.  Everyone loved it.

Oh this is sooo good!  I made it in the crock pot (worked better for what we had planned for the day),it smelled sooo good and we were so hungry by the time it was done cooking I forgot to put the final touches on the drippings.   I just did that tonight(a day later) and it's even better!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe Judy!

Absolutely delicious and do very tender!  I substituted the potatoes for turnips. The wife loved it! She usually does not like roasts, however, this was so tender and flavorful, she said I can make this anytime!

Delicious. I added carrots and potatoes at the same time as I prefer a firm cooked carrot over a mushy cooked carrot. Will definitely add it to our regular lineup.

This is a great recipe! I used burgundy wine instead of vinegar because that is what I had. I added all ingredients before putting in the oven because I am a little lazy and in my experience potatoes and carrots are more flavorful and fully cooked along with the roast. I sprinkled a half packet of onion soup over the top of the potatoes and carrots because I used more than 1lb each because  like leftovers!

My go-to roast recipe! I often make this in my slow-cooker instead of the oven: 4 hours on high heat or 8 hours on low. I also occasionally add extra or different vegetables but keep the same measurements as the recipe. It’s always perfect!

Did not quarter potatoes, I used a medley of yukon, purple, and red; used baby carrots; added parsnips; added all vegetables at same time  after 2 hours of cooking meat until tender. I didn't do the back and forth from oven to stovetop. Removed meat and vegetables from pot after 4hrs, then added cornstarch, water, celery salt, basil, mushrooms and thyme to Dutch oven on stovetop.  After making gravy, returned everything to pot (dutch oven).  The flavors married well and beef was very tender and delicious.

Sensational! I read the comment of the recipe writer who said she uses red wine not RWVinegar. My roast was just slightly over 2 lb but I used all the liquid and was glad. Reduced cooking time by 45 min due to smaller size. Beyond delicious. A real keeper!

I have posted only one other food review in my life, but after making this pot roast recipe last night, I feel compelled to write.  I have always prided myself on my pot roast, but I wanted to try something a little different last night, and came on this recipe, so decided to give it a try.  I used a venison roast, since that's what I had on hand, and followed the recipe as written, using the author's suggestion to use red wine instead of the vinegar, increasing the garlic (I used 5 large cloves), and increasing the herbs.  At the end of the cooking time, my gravy was just the right consistancy for my liking, so I did not use any thickener.  THIS WAS THE BEST POT ROAST I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!  The venison was fall apart tender, and the gravy and veggies were "to die for".  My wife and I ate too much of it, because it was so good, we couldn't stop eating.  This recipe just earned a place in our family cookbook.

I followed the recipe pretty exact. I used a 3lb bottom round roast. The only thing a did a little different was use a splash of red wine to deglaze my pot before cooking the onion and garlic. Also, because I have some family member (children) who hate “chunks” of things like onion and tomato, before putting in the veggies, I removed the meat from the pot and used an emersion blender to smooth the liquid then returned the meat, added the carrots, and continued the recipe as directed. I feel the vinegar and brown sugar definitely added depth of flavor.  The meat fell apart and was very tender. This is a great recipe and I will definitely use it again in the future!!!

This turned out great. I was a little worried about tomatoes in my roast, that was a first for me, but it gave it a great flavor. I will definitely be making this again.

As I recall, I followed the original recipe closely. I'm a 76 year old male who has only been cooking for 15 years. So I probably shouldn't even rate this recipe. So many people rate it so highly, but frankly I found it only medium and the roast was very tough. I think I'll dig up my slow cooker recipe that I cooked once before and was much better. Seriously, a pinch of three different ingredients there at the end?

Being a New Englander, I’ve made many a pot roast but this is our absolute favorite. I usually make a double batch as it freezes well ( I add veggies when I reheat so not to have mushy veggies).

I made this last night & it was really delicious.  my husband said it tasted better than a restaurant cooking.  I tried staying close to the ingredients, but I had to substitute. I used white wine for the vinegar, I chopped up 2 tomatoes & used 1 can of tomato sauce,  than I used a mixed bag of corn,  peas, & carrots.  for the gravy,  I didn't have any mushrooms.  so,  I used the broth from the pot roast with corn starch & the gravy turned out delicious.

Really good pot roast.  Love the combo of an acid with brown sugar. I used merlot and a blonde roux instead of corn starch.  Kept everything else the same, this is a keeper.  Thx for the recipe.

Gave it 4 stars only because I'm not a huge pot roast fan. However, my family and I enjoyed this recipe!
I used apple cider vinegar and canned diced tomatoes with basil already added. I also cooked vegetables and roast at the same time - with potatoes and carrots on the bottom. Roasted for 4 1/2 hours. Meat was very tender, and veggies were perfect.

Absolutely will become one of our go to meals on cold snowy nights in Canada!   Also great for a big family sunday meal.    I followed reviews and used red wine, other than that used the recipe exactly as stated.

This was the perfect roast.  Great flavor.  But be prepared to set time aside to let it cook.  Start early. This is a long cooking process over 5 hrs, I didn't plan well and started the roast at 2:30 and didn't finish until 8:00.  We didn't use the carrots and it was still great

Was great! I used a sirloin roast so didn't take as long.  Cooked in oven for 4 hours.  Then added the potatoes and carrots at the same time and left another hour.

I followed the recipe fairly closely, but I prefer not to add sugar to savory dishes so I used red wine and a little soy sauce instead of red wine vinegar and sugar. I also added some celery because I had it on hand and I like it, and I used fresh basil instead of dried. Finally, I used half the amount of chopped onion called for, but added a couple of packages of pearl onions as well.
Cooking a big piece of tough meat in the dutch oven for 4.5 hours transformed it into a tender, juicy, tasty treat. I will make it again.

I stepped out of my usual way to cook pot roast and so glad that I did. This was delicious and a very nice change. I did not have red wine or red wine vinegar so had to use apple cider vinegar but will try it with red wine next time. It got rave reviews at my house . will definitley make again. Thank you Judy 2304.
Oh I did use 10 oz. Fresh mushrooms in the gravy and that was a good addition. just added at the end as you would the jar mushrooms. Again just because that was what I had in the house.

Scrumptious!  I make this all the time. I brown the meat on the stovetop and cook the onion in the pan too.  Then I transfer meat/onions to a crockpot and add the remaining ingredients, except the potatoes, and only use 1 can of beef stock. I serve this over mashed potatoes.

Made this for dinner tonight . . . my husband loved it and, although I thought it was very good, the richness of the gravy got to be a little too much for me after a while.  That being said, I would definitely make this again.  As I am one of those cooks who needs a recipe in front of her face to make a meal, I will say that instead of a "pinch" of the various spices that were called for in this recipe, I used a quarter teaspoon for each and maybe that was a little too much and why it became a little too rich for me about three-quarters of the way through the meal.  Seems to me that, when I use a "pinch" of spice, it is always too bland.  I used the red wine vinegar, as called for, put the spices in from the get-go and put the carrots, mushrooms and potatoes in about three-quarters of the way through and everything was done perfectly.  Anyhowzit, this is a keeper.

Fabulous recipe!  I tripled it for a crowd and everyone loved it.  The only thing I'd change next time is cut the tomatoes in half.  Fabulous comfort food.  Thanks!  Teresa

I followed the recipe as posted except for the end because the time involved was too long for the family to wait to be done properly. Omitted the oven rotation and boiled on the stove top  in the cast iron pot until the veggie's were done. Next time I will omit the diced tomatoes. I thought it was odd to begin with but I stuck with the recipe anyway. It had a strange flavor that didn't belong this beef stew. The meat (rump roast) was pull apart and not able to slice. Everything was delicious otherwise including the mushroom gravy.

This pot roast was delicious! Only thing I had to change were the tomatoes. I didn't have any but I used half a can of tomato soup and it really came out great.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I made it too late in the day, so we had to eat it the next day. By the time I reheated it, it was a little dry, but the delicious gravy helped. Hopefully eating it right away the next time, it will be less dry.

I made this yesterday.  I was very different from most recipes for roast I've tried.  I will most definitely make this again. The meat was very tender and the gravy was yummy!

I enjoyed this recipe, and I will definitely make it again. The meat was very tender and very tasty. I loved the gravy, as well. It was nice and tangy, and very "beefy". One of my roommates didn't like the tomatoes, but I frankly think those were an excellent addition to the traditional pot roast.

I did stray from the recipe just a little. I used a nice burgundy instead of red wine vinegar. I also did not add potatoes to the pot. I really love mashed potatoes with pot roast, so I did that instead. I sauteed the mushrooms with the onions at the beginning (I used fresh instead of canned).

Other than that, I followed the recipe. It was a great meal.

I made this last weekend and was SUPER excited because it has such great reviews!  ...I was a little disappointed when it didn't turn out as good as everyone thought.  Maybe our families taste buds are just different but while we ate it all, I wouldn't make it again.

The vinegar taste was overpowering for me and the smell actually made me to want to stay out of the kitchen while it was cooking!

So good!!! Cooked browned 3.34 lb. arm roast in pressure cooker for 40-45 min. Added celery, onions, carrots, and fresh mushrooms at beginning of cooking. No potatoes so served with instant mashed. No diced tomatoes so used small can of tomato sauce which helped thicken gravy. No cornstarch needed. Used ted wine vinegar and slightly less sugar.

This is an ok recipe. Mine turned out dried. Over all the flavor is good. Still thankful for sharing this recipe, next time I will be more careful with cooking time and choosing the best cut of meat.
