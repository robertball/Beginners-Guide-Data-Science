The cookies were good. The only concern I had was how much flour was in the recipie. I had to add a little extra moisture such as an egg and milk to moisten them up.

This cookie recipe was easy and tasty.  On accident I only used 1 cup of sugar and they were still very good.  My family likes nuts so I also added 1 cup of pecans.  I was out of vanilla so I subbed almond extract.  I will definetly make these again!

These were good but I did add an extra egg because the dough seemed way to dry. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. Followed to the letter and although the batter was a little stiff, it was great not to have to refrigerate before rolling the cookies. We all thought the cookies were yummy. Probably good with all chocolate  chips also.

I thought the cookies tasted like they had too much flour.  I felt like the dough was missing something... I'd like to see what would happen if I used a peanut butter cookie dough and then added the chips....  However, I brought them into work and they were a huge hit!  I thought they tasted better a day or two after I baked them.

I followed the directions to the letter and these turned out very well.  They were a HUGE hit with everyone! They taste great even 2 days after baking!
