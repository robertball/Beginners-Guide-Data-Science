I used the following "cheats" to make this recipe faster and easier. Bought coleslaw from the deli, and used two bowls of Curly's BBQ pulled pork instead of making my own. 30 minutes in a 425 convection oven was long enough for the tots to be nice and crisp. While I'm sure homemade coleslaw, pulled pork and BBQ sauce would be even better, I've got to say this short cut way was super delicious! I'd serve this to company any day!

This is a great idea. Husband made a pork shoulder yesterday to serve at a super bowl party and found this recipe on here.  We had to go buy the ingredients to make this so he could try it.  He used his pulled pork, home made bbq sauce that our daughter makes , bread and butter jalapenos and he added some ghost pepper salsa, and I made a lime cilantro cole slaw, other than that he followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome. We are serving this today for our super bowl party.  He would give this more than 5 stars if it was possible.

I made this for my husband and me for the Super Bowl. (Just the two of us.) He loved it! I didn't really measure, but used the basic recipe. I made the tots in two 9" cake pans, then we built our own. His had more tots, a lot of pulled pork, lots of jalapeno slices, hot bbq sauce, and the pepperjack cheese. (He likes a lot of heat!) Mine had less tots, a moderate amount of pork, no jalapeno slices, mild bbq sauce, and cheddar cheese. (Yeah, I'm a wimp.)  We were both extremely happy with our efforts. Just the way we wanted! Will definitely make it again!!!

We had 6 people give it two thumbs up!  We made the tots extra crispy! Will definitely be making again.

Different but intriguing. Can be made also with shredded chicken.  I think just hamburger, taco seasoning, the pepper jack cheese, coleslaw etc minus the BBQ sauce would be good also. I used tiny tater tots so they'd be sure to be extra crispy like the recipe called for.  Ore Ida potato crowns would work also for the extra crispy tots. Will make again.

This was very good. We've made pulled BBQ pork on baked potatoes before, and this was a delightful variation on that. Loved the addition of jalapenos to spice it up and the coleslaw was an interesting flavor.

I put some pork tenderloin in the slow cooker with broth to get a head start on this recipe.  It was very delicious and everyone in my family ate it, including my son who is very picky!

Loved this! I finished the pork off on the grill pan as the submitter mentioned in the footnotes and this raised the recipe to a whole new level. 5 stars all the way!
