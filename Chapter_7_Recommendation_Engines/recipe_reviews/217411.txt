The rub for this was excellent, though I felt that it needed a bit more salt. I don't tend to salt my food at the table, and prefer things less salty, but this could use about another 1/2 tsp. I decided to slice my meat instead of shred, and that made it better for burritos. Next time I'll add more salt, and more cayenne to give it a bit more bite.

Use chipotle peppers instead of the cayenne - much more favorable. Also why in heavens name use boneless meat. The bone adds so much more flavor.

Overall this turned out amazing.  The rub had very good flavor.  The time in the oven brought a hickory smoke amazing smell into the house while this was cooking.  I would have rated 5 stars if it had a bit more salt and my roast really needed to cook in the oven for over 2 hours before it easily shredded.  Making the above adjustments I will be doing this again.  I served this burrito style with black beans and cilantro rice with fresh tomato salsa and guacamole.

Absolutely delicious, only thing I changed was I completely left out the salt. Works great for pulled pork sandwiches too.
