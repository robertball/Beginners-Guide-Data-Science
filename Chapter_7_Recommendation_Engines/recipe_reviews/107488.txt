This recipe was so good that my dad said he wanted me to make it again, twice in a week! That's very rare in my family especially since we always eat the same things (chicken, pasta, etc.) I made some changed to the recipe though. I didn't have lime juice or rum so i used lemon juice and tequila. I also put on the spices the night before and put it into the fridge so it could "marinate" sorta. and I put the spices underneath the skin (i did this by pulling some of the skin from the breast and put the spices under there and rubbed) so the taste would be amazing! Before i even into the oven, i put even more of the same spices on! I basted it for the time it said then i turned the temperature up to 450 so the skin could be crispy. 
BOY! this was delicious! I've made it two times and my family LOVES it!!!
I think it would be great with cooked carrots with a touch of lemon on them and some white rice. yumm!!
Thanks for the recipe.

I have never written a review before for a recipe, but this chicken was so good, I had to say WOW and thanks for sharing.  I followed the "roasting chicken 101" instructions to prep the chicken before cooking.  My family, who gets tired of chicken because we eat it so much couldn't get enough.  Thanks again!

I used this recipe on game hens instead of a chicken and it turned out great!  The hens were so moist and the flavor of the spices was wonderful.  I stuffed the hens with lime wedges and cilantro which I highly recommend.

I love all the spices coming together in this dish. Next time I will increase the lime juice  and the brown sugar so as to have a little more sauce.

My family thought this was good. DH says it tasted like Jerk chicken with out the heat.I used chicken parts instead of a whole chicken and cooked it for 1hr at 350 degrees. I will try this again with a whole chicken.

This was delicious.  I used tequilla instead of rum (that is what was in the house) and instead of cayenne pepper a little bit of red pepper flakes.  Everyone loved including hubby and kids.

I'm just getting into roasting chickens and this was the second recipe I tried.  I thought it was excellent. I used lemon instead of lime and didn't have clove so I left it out. Also, I used chicken leg quarters because it was what I had on hand. I also drained the fat drippings from the pan and made a sauce from what remained. It was a delicious meal. LOVED the cinnamin!

This was not good.  The chicken was not very moist and did not care for the flavor at all.

The chicken turned out fabulous! Very moist & fragrant. I used a 6lb roasting chicken, stuffed it with a lemon, cut into half, and one half of a lime. I doubled up the ingredients and used a generous amount of freshly squeezed lime juice with the pulp and Jamaican rum. I lifted the skin to rub on the spices and to place small pats of butter. I set the chicken on a bed of onions, sliced four yellow potatoes in half and topped with some chicken broth. The potatoes turned out amazing!!! Soaking up all of the flavour! Will make again!

This was too spicy for my taste, although the chicken was nice and juicy and tender.  If I made it again, I would not put in the cayenne pepper.

I made this chicken once about 3 years ago.  Ever since then, I use the exact recipe (only adding much more of the ingredient) for my Thanksgiving Turkey.  I use the drippings for a gravy.  I get so many compliments and the gravy is to die for.  I love spicy foods and this recipe is the best.  I will continue to make it every year for my 20 pound turkey!

This chicken has a very unique flavor than most chickens. It's delicious! The secret to a moist chicken is to bake it breast side down for half the time and breast side up the rest of the time! Works like a charm!

OK...this was my first time with a whole fryer chicken. I must have done something a tad bit wrong as it took MUCH longer to cook mine. ((I did have it snug in the baking pan and it was a 4 lb chicken instead...)) BUT....the flavors were AMAZING!!! I shoved the herbs/seasonings under the skin and let it set for about an hour. I did not use rum ((or tequila)) I just used a bit more lime juice to make it the right consistency. I think it still tasted great. I cranked up the oven to 450 for the last 15 minutes so the skin would get crispy. ((My 6 yr old would never eat the skin before and this time she said she couldn't eat her chicken since she ran out of skin...LOL)) We will DEFINITELY be using this again. Thanks!!!!

This chicken was quite good and very moist. I rubbed the spice mixture under the skin, because I don't eat the skin and didn't want to throw out all the flavour when I removed it. I do wish I had of put the spice rub on a few hours before cooking so it would have went a bit deeper in the chicken. I'll try that next time.

I like lots of sauce, so I doubled the ingredients. Thicken sauce while chicken is cooked and resting, and pour over rice!

I brinned the chicken in a salt and sugar for 3 hours then put the rub on 2 hours before cooking. The was very flavorful.   Different people could taste a different spice.

fabulous.  Cooked a large roasting chicken (8-12 pounds) with the same amount of spices called for for a smaller chicken and it was plenty.  I used spray olive oil instead of brushing on vegetable oil and it coated the chicken nice and evenly so that the spices stuck well.  I basted maybe four time throughout the whole cooking time and it took it about 2:30 hours to cook at 350 degrees.  
The flavors in the spices and basting sauce were definitely evident in all parts of the chicken, but not overpowering.  I served this as a part of a somewhat tropical themed Easter dinner and it was a HUGE hit.
A couple of days later, I used the drippings to make gravy and it was some of the tastiest and most unique gravy I have ever had.

I quadrupled the recipe for 2 chickens, and took the advice of reviewers to let it marinate.  I rubbed the birds down with the seasoning, made sure to get lots in between the breast and skin, and refrigerated apx. 24 hours before cooking.  After that first baste, going in for the second I got hit with a waft of alcohol vapors opening the oven, so don't stick your face right in there like I did!  Also, added ground corriander and a dash of allspice to the seasoning mix.  The whole thing was AWSOME!  However, I can see how not everyone would like this taste, if you're not familiar with caribbean flavors it may seem odd, but I thought it was YUMMY!!!  Oh, I also added a bit of Kitchen Bouquet to the rum/lime baste to give better color and it came out gorgeous golden brown.  The pan drippings caramelized and as it rested I kept basting.  REALLY good recipe, well recieved by my family!  PS THX to tat2whttrsh's review, served with Byrdhouse Mushroom Barley Pilaf and it went wonderfully if you're looking for a side...

One of the best chickens I've ever roasted. Only thing different I did was set the chicken on a bed of coarsely chopped onions to keep the bottom of the roaster from burning. I think when I make this again I'd double the spices and use sliced limes as a bed for the chicken next time. I served this with SunnyByrd's Byrdhouse Mushroom Barley Pilaf only using thyme in place of the basil, to keep the same flavor tone all through dinner. Tasty dinner! NOTE: I cooked mine at 400* because my rice was cooking at that temp. You might want to as well, unless you want to wait a couple hours longer.

Even though I removed all the skin before roasting the chicken, it still came out moist and juicy--I suppose due to the frequent basting.  The flavor was delicious.  I did find the basting every 20 minutes to be a little annoying since it tied me to the stove for an hour and a half.  I will make this again despite the basting because it is good and a little exotic.

I made this on the weekend using chicken breasts and Rum with lime since I didn't have regular rum.  I marinated it on Saturday and bbq'd it on Sunday.  The flavours are so wonderful and really permeated the chicken.  I will definitely make this again.  If you are using a whole chicken, make sure to lift the skin and put the spices under the skin of the breasts.

Yum! I used chicken breasts, baked in the oven. Half way through baking I poured the sauce over top of the chicken.  Delicious!

I am not a Thanksgiving turkey type of girl so I decided to substitute this instead.  I used an oven roaster chicken (about 8 pounds) so I used more of each ingredient seasoning to my taste. I used olive oil and seasoned the chicken both under the skin and on top. I also let it marinate overnight. Lastly, I used fresh herbs instead of dry. It makes a huge difference.  My family LOVED the flavors. It was a hit for Thanksgiving!!!

This recipe was excellent.  Not only did the chicken taste great, but it also looked great.  I rubbed the spices under the skin to flavor the meat itself.  I also stuffed the chicken with crushed garlic cloves and lime wedges.  I could really taste the lime in the chicken, whereas the tequila was not as prominent.  This could be due to the fact that I stuffed the chicken with limes.  It turned out well because I love lime.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

LOVED this chicken!!  I wanted a nice-looking skinless chicken roasted in an oven bag and this was it!  Lots of interesting flavours and nice and moist meat.  No lime, no rum, no brown sugar --  I just sprinkled everything on and 2 t white sugar last.  In a 400 degree oven for 45 minutes.  Will make again!!

This was OK as far as roast chickens go.  I guess I was just expecting much more flavor & what I got was a plain roasted chicken with a spicy skin.  And if you dont eat the skin, all you'll get is a plain roasted chicken.  I wouldn't make it again.

Moist and tender roast chicken that was not too spicy.  I did not have rum, so I used a 1/2 teaspoon of rum extract in 2 tablespoons of water in its place.

This worked really well for us.  My husband would have eaten all the skin if I hadn't called on it.  But the flavors were present in the moist meat as well.  Very nice.

This was a delicious rub, but for some reason, it didn't really penetrate the chicken. Still very tasty. I think next time I'll make a double batch of the rub and use half with an injector or mixed with a little butter under the skin.

This was a VERY easy recipe!  I didn't have cayenne, so I used red pepper flakes too (@ 1 tsp).  My kids loved it because it was so moist.  I would have kicked it up a notch if it were for just me.  As a busy mom..this was easy and yummy!  I did have to bake it about 10 minutes more than what was said even with my thermometer.  Try it!

We absolutely loved this recipe!  I used a 5lb chicken so I increased everything by 1/2.  I roasted my chicken at 350 and flipped it over in the middle of roasting (we don't eat the skin anyway).  It was done in exactly 90 minutes.  The chicken was moist, juicy, and had a great flavor (delicate, but yummy).  This is definitely in our keeper box!

This recipe was great. It was easy to prepare, everything included was already stocked in my home. Watch out though, a little cayenne pepper goes a long way. Very good matched with Jamaican Rice as a side.

I was sceptical when I saw the ingredients.  I made a 6lb chicken for my family of 4.  We almost ate the entire chicken.  My husband LOVED it and wants me to make it for our parents.  My kids, ages 3 and 6, loved it too.  I would do this one again very soon.

This chicken was very moist and juicy.  The skin browned very nicely and I couldn't resist eating a small amount of the skin.  Smells absolutely amazing  as it cooks.  This is an absolute winner.

This was an awesome roasted chicken.  I had never mixed these seasonings together.  My husband and children loved it.  The only changes I made out of necessity were to leave out the rum and the use whole cloves and not ground cloves I also used fresh lime juice and stuffed the bird with the lime peel.  Turned out awesome.  I will definitely make it again

I thought this chicken was wonderful! I had a five-pound chicken, and it was perfectly done and well browned in 1 hour and 45 minutes at 325 degrees. There was lots and lots of juice in the pan, some of which was served with the chicken. For storage I defatted the remaining juice and poured it over the left-over deboned chicken in a plastic bag.

Very good but doesn't look anything like the picture.  Took much longer than the recipe mentioned...more like two hours and I had to put the temp up to 350 because 325 wasn't doing it.  Very good comments from the dinner party.

Made it tonight for dinner and it came out fabulous. I didn't have rum so I used tequila instead and I substituted paprika for the cayenne so it wouldn't be too hot for my 18 month old (who gave it her seal of approval with repeated "baby like"). I used 4 large bone-in breasts and cooked at 425 for one hour and they came out perfectly done. Also I mixed together the spices then added the oil and brushed the mixture on the chicken rather than brushing on the oil then sprinkling the spices.

This was a wonderful recipe.  My kids even ate it without any kind of dipping sauce, which in itself is a thumbs-up review!  My husband is allergic to poultry, so I put some on a pork chop for him (and basted with the liquid) and he said it was good on the pork also.  I used Bacardi dark rum, as the recipe did not specify which type of rum (light or dark) and that was all I had on hand.  Delicious!  I will definitely be making this again.  The only thing that confused me a little about the recipe was "baste with the sauce"... because my mixture of lime juice/rum/brown sugar was liquid... not sauce-like.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if what I was basting with is considered "sauce".  I'm new at roasting whole chickens.  In any case, 5 thumbs up from my family!

Oh Wow...amazing. Absolutely amazing and so juicy. Doubled up on lme juice and brown sugar for the marinade because I only had overproof white rum in the house (Ahh good ol' Wray & Nephew...a Jamaican staple). This is a definite keeper.

I made this without rum as I didn't have any and it turned out perfectly!  The only thing I would do different (besides adding rum) is to cut up the chicken and let it marinate overnight.  Thank you!

This chicken was great! I think it would be even better if it was marinated for several hours or overnite! Thanks for the recipes!

This was very good. My husband liked it so much he has asked me to make it once a week. I used Emeril chicken rub instead of all the various spices plus some extra ginger root. Next time I'm going to take the suggestion of one of the reviewers and cook it on 450 at the end to make it crispy.

this did not turn out as I had expected, the meat did not take in any of the flavoring and the skin ended up being soggy.  However, the meat of the chicken was perfectly moist.  We will not be making this recipe again.

Amazing recipe. I used tequila instead of rum. The chicken smelt like paradise. Of coarse, it was very delicious.

This chicken dish was delicious. Besides it tasting great, I loved the way it made the house seem so warm and cozy on such a chilly day. Although it was October, my friend thought it smelled like "Christmas".

This was really good, and easy.  I just wasn't sure if I was supposed to mix the spices w/the juice mixture.  So I put the wet mix on first, then the dry spices.  It was very good, but not as flavorful as I thought it would be.  It took a little over 90 minutes to reach the right temp.  Served w/brown rice, steamed green beans, and a multi-grain baguette.

This was  good. I doubled the recipe then added 1 extra teaspoon of salt. I used white rum in my recipe. Baked on the asked temperature for 50 minutes with the pan covered then I set the temp to 450, uncovered the pan and let it cook for 40 more minutes. Really really good.

I like the flavor of the spices on the chicken.  It was something different for our family.  I decided to cook some potatoes in the bottom of the roasting pan with the chicken but that was a mistake.  So  much of the seasoning cooked into the potatoes, it made them too spicy.   I would try this roast chicken again but with a different side.

Great recipe!  After reading the reviews I decided to use the rub on chicken wings and marinated them overnight.  I skipped the oil placing the wings on a baking sheet, added additional seasoning salt and sprayed the wings with a cooking oil spray.  Baked the wings in 350 oven for 1hr. then basted the wings an additional 30 minutes turning every 10 minutes. They were very tender, crispy and tasty.

This was delish! A whole chicken is too much for just the hubby and me, so I did it with 4 chicken thighs, and only one hour in the oven. Came out so moist and flavorful! Pretty easy to make too. A keeper.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was a hit!  The aroma coming from the oven was amazing!  The only thing I changed is that I removed the skin from the chicken, then brushed with oil and the spices.  The chicken came out moist and juicy without the added fat of the chicken skin.

Very tasty chicken recipe. I would definitely marinate next time, as all the flavor was on the skin, which I didn't eat (counting calories!!) The whole family enjoyed this very much. I cooked mine in a dutch oven for 90 minutes..perfectly moist!

I have never written a review about a recipe before, but this one deserves it.  This chicken was awesome!  I added soy sauce to the basting sauce and put in less lime because we're not big fans of citrus flavor.  I also added garlic powder to the seasoning.  I cooked a 4.4 pound chicken so it took 2 hours.  You have to try this recipe!  The chicken was sooo flavorful and moist!  Thank you for a great chicken!

Instead of roasting, I grill this "Drunken Chicken" from this site-style.  I double the marinade and rub-- and inject the chicken with the marinade and the leftover for baste.  Injecting the marinade eliminates the "bland chicken meat" problem some reviewers have mentioned. I apply the rub and then I take a beer can that's filled about 2/3 the way up with beer and Italian dressing and place the chicken over it.  I put half an onion and some fresh thyme in the neck cavity.  I don't brush the leftover marinade on the chicken until it has been cooking about 30 min. or else the rub will fall off.  As written 3.5  stars-- with my changes it was definitely a five star. Excellent.

OMG!!! If I could give more than 5 stars I would! I used to pride myself on my roasted chicken. But now I consider mine so so at best. This was the best chicken I have ever eaten. It was moist tender and the flavor was divine! My entire family gobbled it up. My 2 year old who has to have ketchup in all meat was going man oh man after every bite with NO ketchup!!! And she ate every bite plus wanted more. Everyone asked for more. I did double everything because I had a 6lb bird and cut up 1 lemon to stuff in the cavity other than that I followed to the "T". I was concerned with the lack of butter but am glad I did not tinker with the recipe by adding some. I will be replacing my roast chicken recipe with this and serving it as often as I can. Thank you so much for this devine recipe!!!

This dish is absolutely incredible! 

I made some adjustments to the ingredients: I doubled the amount of the listed spices because the chicken I used was nearly 5 lbs. I used olive oil instead of vegetable. 

I also made another batch of the spices and combined it with some olive oil and yummy root vegetables that I cut up very chunky: sweet potatoes (2), carrots (8 medium), white onion (1 small), and celery (1 thinly chopped stalk).

I stuffed the vegetables in the chicken and surrounded the chicken with vegetables in the baking dish. This added about 30 minutes to the baking time and made it a bit difficult to base the chicken with the rum/lime juice sauce. I need to get an injection tool....

I'd like to try this dish with honey insted of brown sugar next time. 

Definitely try this dish!

Excellent!  I stuffed one end with a pierced lemon and the other with a pierced lime.  I also added paprika and turmeric to the rub and arranged sliced onions and chopped garlic around the chicken.  It was incredibly moist and flavourful. I will make this again for sure.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was good but not great. The skin of the chicken was awesome, but the meat was quite bland. Next time I will inject the chicken with the seasoning as well and see how that coems out.

The guest I made this for is on a restricted diet, so I left out the rum and brown sugar. The chicken tasted AMAZING… so moist and flavorful! I can only imagine how good it would taste when made as directed. I can’t wait to make it again… this time with the rum and brown sugar! And, I’d like to try the spice mixture on other ingredients… maybe over sweet potatoes!?! Thanks for a great recipe!

What a phenomenal dish! My boyfriend and I loved this meal! I cooked mine in a Pampered Chef deep dish baker with matching bowl over top, creating a dutch oven effect. The chicken had the best flavor and was amazingly moist. Pairs very well with a Riesling!

We really loved this chicken, very tasty - the herbs and spices get right into the meat instead of staying just on the skin.

Living in West Africa you can just run out to the grocery store and buy roasted chicken. So I made this recipe and it was great, tasted just like the ones we use to buy at the grocery store.

i don't know... This recipe was not a huge success. We found it kinda bland actually. Maybe if the chicken would've been marinated first it would've been tastier.

Made it! Loved it! 
I was out of brown sugar so used white sugar and a bit of molasses and it was wonderful.
After making it the first time, I decided to make spice container of all the spices together so now I just sprinkle the spices on instead of measuring each time. Clean up is easier too. Also easy to sprinkle on veggies (sweet potato fries especially are great).

Excellent Recipe! My family loves this so much a family of 4 requires that I cook 2 chickens so everyone can get "enough" ! We had 2 guests  one evening  and all of us we siting around picking the carcasses CLEAN  Thanks for sharing. 

Note: I do add extra cayenne since we like a  little spice.

5.14.20 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/107488/caribbean-spiced-roast-chicken/ ... Used as a mock sauce. This leaves a lingering medium or so heat; complex flavors. E didn't like the ginger.

This was delicious and everyone in my family enjoyed this recipe!  I am only giving this 4 stars because I did make some changes.  I used a 5lb chicken and double the seasonings.  I also made a separate batch of the sauce and injected it so it would have more flavor.  The last change I made was cooking it like beer can chicken but in the oven.  So tasty!  Will make again.

Flavouful and really easy to make. I followed a lot of the advises in the comments like double the spices, rub some under the skin and leave it marinate, and used spices rum. I also filled the cavity with onion, garlic cloves and fresh rosemary, and put the chicken on a bed of onion slices. Everybody loved it for Xmas, we're a small family and it was perfect. Thank you for a great recipe.

Fantastic recipe.  Lights up the umami receptors.  So different from the seasonings traditionally associated with roast chicken.  A nice spin on the Sunday bird.

We liked it a lot.  I did turn it breast side up for the last 30 minutes.  I was unclear on the sauce, I suspect it was to be used at each basting a little at a time.....but I put it all on and tried to bring it up from the bottom of the pan....not a good plan as it turned into a sticky goo. So I added water and scooped.  It was delicious and we would do it again.

I gave it a four because the cinnamon was a pleasant surprise.  I won't make this again, but learned that another main meal recipe might be worth a try.  So, try this recipe.  Cinnamon is for more than just dessert.

The picture looks delicious so I immediately tried this recipe. Unfortunately, the flavors didn't really come through with these quantities.

I used about 1.5 lbs of chicken legs and marinated it for 4 hours before baking. Also I substituted dried oregano for thyme. It tastes so fantastic. My 6 year old is a picky eater but she loved it. I served with sweet potatoes cooked with cinnamon and brown sugar. Will definitely make again.

I tried this tonight per the recipe except I used 4 bone in, skin on chicken breasts. I will try again with a whole chicken because we loved the flavors but this turned out a little dry.

The chicken was very moist. Most of the flavor is in the skin, which is great if you like to eat skin, although there was a lot of fat on the skin of the chicken we had.

We doubled the recipe ingredients since our chicken was 6lbs.  Also, subbed honey for the brown sugar in the basting liquid and mixed melted coconut oil with the spice mixture prior to rubbing on the chicken.  One other change was to put a quartered lime and a crushed clove of garlic in the chicken's body cavity prior to roasting.  Delicious flavor in the roasted bird, and as juicy and tender as you could ever want.  Really great.

A keeper! Will definitely make again. I used about 2 1/2 pounds chicken large chicken thighs, baked at 350 degrees for 75 minutes, basted with the rum sauce every 20 minutes. I misread recipe, and mistakenly added one tablespoon brown sugar to the spice rub, as well as one tablespoon to the liquids, so it was a bit sweeter than the original recipe, but it was delicious and a big hit with hubby. Maybe next time I'll follow recipe to compare results.

From reading the reviews, I knew that this would not have enough flavor for us, so while the recipe gave us a moist, beautiful roast chicken, I used a bunch more spices and it ended up being closer to a Jerk marinade. Also, I saw a review complaining that the flavors did not reach the meat but remained on the skin, so I seasoned heavily below the skin as well. We both remarked that we've never tasted roast chicken like that before and we're hooked!

I followed the recipe with slightly more rum and brown sugar. I used this as a marinade for chicken breasts and let it sit for more than a day. We grilled the chicken. My husband and I liked/loved it, my daughter thought it was ok. I will make this again!

Wow, perfect.  Even my pickiest eater liked it.  Great to make in the oven.  My 14 year old who is a beginner cook made this dish, so if you're new to cooking and want something tasty, go ahead and try this one.

Great flavor and very moist. Not sure the size of the chicken I bought but I had to increase the cook time to 2 hours. I added potatoes and carrots to they base of the pan and seasoned with salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, oregano, and olive oil. Will definitely make this again

My night to cook for the wife and my daughters' family.  Didn't have rum but thought molasses would be fine.  Well, it was wonderful! My grandkids are picky eaters, and they  loved the chicken.  Juicy, flavorful.  Will do this one again.

The chicken smells absolutely delicious while it was cooking. But, as soon as I took my first bite, I realized it was a tad bit bland and needed salt. I will make the recipe again, but I will definitely add more salt. The chicken was moist and the sauce was flavorful. It did, however; take longer to cook then instructed, and I had a smaller bird. But, all and all, it was a pretty good recipe.

This was a wonderful recipe. I didn't have lime, so I substituted fresh orange juice and then added the orange (cut in half) to the inside of the bird with some onion. I also made a bed of onion so it would not stick to the roasting pan. I also added potato, carrots, and brussels sprouts to the roasting pan. It was a great mix of sweet and spice!

This is one of our "family favourites".  It is very versatile and I do agree with the others....make more sauce!  I doubled the recipe for sauce, as I serve all over rice and it is even better re-heated the next day.

I didn't have rum and used tequilla instead and it came out just fine. I actually used a cut up chicken and grilled it when done. Good Flavors, will make again.

I made two of these chickens for Christmas and the taste was fabulous. This will be my new Caribbean/Jerk seasoning. With all the basting it was definiely moist. The only changes I made was I brushed the chickens with olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I used rum extract with enough water to equal 4 oz (I doubled the recipe because of the 2 chickens). I can't imagine it would have tasted any different, it surely didn't smell any different than the real rum! I think next time I'll try using Malibu Coconut rum just to try a different flavor.  This recipe is definitely a keeper! OOPs! I forgot one more thing, I used allspice instead of ginger.

This was the first chicken I'd ever roasted. It was beautifully moist -- the meat practically fell off the bones -- but it was certainly a very untraditional taste. I rather liked it, but my husband hated the rub. I guess it is a dish people either love or hate.

I made this for sunday dinner and my fanily LOVED it.  My cousin said he was craving it last night, lol.  I used Jamaican White Overproof Rum, and i stuffed the chicken with garlic-mashed potatoes. I also baked it at 400 degrees instead of 350.  It was FAB!!! Definitely gonna do it again :)

Good but could be better a little bland but I would increase the amount of spices and marinate over night.  I would suggest cooking longer than 90 minutes or at a higher temp.

I've made this twice now and enjoyed it each time.  It is true that if you only put the seasoning on the outside the meat won't take on much flavor;  but isn't that true of any chicken?  Try putting on rub under and outside.  I used dark spiced rum in the marinade and also shoved a lime, cut in half, into the cavity of the chicken last time.  Thanks for a great new way to roast chicken!

We try new recipes, from this site, weekly and this was such a let down. So spicey made my nose run, the spices were not a good combination & the cinnamon was overpowering.

This was pretty good, but it needs a lot more salt in my opinion.  So I'm thinking brine it first. 1/2 teaspoon of salt for the entire chicken did sound off.  So I did add a little more, not nearly enough for our taste.

I agree with other reviewers.  This was a very moist chicken but I think it lacked flavor.  The skin had flavor but that was about it.

This was one of the moistest chickens I have ever made. However, it was also the most bland. It didn't seem like any of the spices actually got through to the chicken. I will probably not be making this again.

WOW...this was a winner.  My chicken came out a little underdone, but that is relative to the size of the bird and I probably should have given mine about 15 more minutes.  I used the convection setting on my oven and the skin was crisp and nicely browned.  I will try this on a cut up bird next time and I think this would be outstanding on a pork loin too.  Used white rum on this chicken. For pork, I think I would use dark...doubled the sugar and lime juice by the way, so  I could baste it more  often and also used Mexican brown sugar--It's extra, extra dark and has a great earthy flavor.  Lastly and VERY Important...Use the 1/4 t of ginger only if you are using the regular old stuff from the grocery store.  If you use a better, fresher brand (like  Penzey's) use 1/8 t.  People don't realize how much flavor the jarred stuff from the grocery looses as it sits around for years...Served this with Basmatti rice and steamed veg. Drizzeled the pan juice over the rice.  Yum...a real keeper.  I might even do this to a turkey....hmmmmmmmmm...

Thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. A nice change to the usual roast turkey. Flavours were fab and resulted in a tender, moist, tasty bird. Only change was had to sub spiced rum as that is what I had on hand. A family fav.

I marinated a 6 lb chicken for 20 hours and it turned out perfect!  The white meat was tender to the last bite, the juices were dripping and best of all the marinade on the skin baked into a delicious dark glaze.  Since the chicken was so large and I used my compact Ronco rotisserie, I started to worry when the skin started turning dark (probably from the brown sugar) but it turned delicious anyway.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

Wonderful aroma while baking and the flavor was great. The leftovers went into a chicken noodle soup! I will make this again but with cut up pieces in the slow cooker. My chicken was larger and took over two hours to bake at that temp.

My husband was looking for a new roasted chicken recipe and I found this one.  It is the BEST roasted chicken we've ever had.  Is so moist and juice.  We cook it longer than the recipe calls for because we like the skin nice and crunchy.  The flavor is just out of this world.

Used a whole cut up chicken.  The flavor was good, but would have liked a little more flavor in the chicken.  Will probaly do again with boneless chicken.

This was flavorful and easy. I rubbed some of the sauce inbetween the breast meat and skin and that helped. It's pretty hard to flavor chicken unless you inject it. I would make two because it was even better the next day when I diced it and added it to pasta.

This wasn't our favorite roast chicken recipe, but it was okay for a break away from our standards. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but added some onion powder (I can't seem to put a chicken in the oven without it). If I make this again, I will omit the cinnamon. It just seems wrong to put cinnamon on chicken (or with chocolate), and I didn't like tasting there, either.

I found this recipe really delicious. It was moist and flavourful. I brined my chicken beforehand bc supposed to make it more moist but doubt it made that much of a difference. I think it's all in basting often. I used lemon juice and red peppers flakes bc that's all I had and also used fresh ginger too. Will definitely make again.

Very Nice....Once I seasoned the bird, I let it sit overnight with the Rum base as well. Very flavorful and moist.  I also cook the chicken upside down which makes it very juicy.

I made this recipe last night exactly as written and it was so bland!  It had absolutely no flavor to it at all and would not dare make this again!

My family did not like this at all. When I asked them what they didn't like about it they said cinnamon does not belong on chicken. Sorry, won't be making again.

I made this the other night, and I don't know if it was the method/ingredients, but it made the most MOIST roasted chicken I have ever made!  I used a previously frozen Foster Farms roaster from Costco (about 4lbs).  For the rub I used NapaStyle's Toasted Spice Rub as it most of the same ingredients, and the convenience of pre-made/mixed.  I used the recipe for the basting sauce and personally couldn't taste the rum.  Following the directions, I brushed it every 20-minutes as it roasted in a 325F oven.  It took 2-hours for the juices to run clear.  Today I shredded what was left to make a chicken salad and it was just as moist as when it came out of the oven.  This will be a regular...when I have the 2-hours to devote to it!
Thank you for sharing!

I expected much more flavor. I rubbed the seasoning under the skin and basted as directed, but did not get the flavor that I was anticipating.

My husband and I have tried this one twice now and it was good both times. We did it on the bbq rotissere! It came out nice and moist with a  sweet flavor from the cinamon which blends well with the lime and dry rub. I would have to say that you probably could tone down the rum to your liking because it can be a little strong. You could increase the lime and/or cinnamon. It's easy to throw together.

This was really different, and I'm glad I tried it. I marinated 2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts, so the flavor was a little strong. I baked at 400 for about 20-30 minutes, then shredded the chicken for chicken salad. I discovered I'm not fond of the rum/cinnamon flavor in chicken; however, when mixed with leftover Ranch Dressing II from this website, the chicken was elevated to a very flavorful chicken dish. It  definitely rates a try by following the recipe & roasting a whole chicken.

This was wonderfully different.  Not bland at all and very nice and moist.

The cinnamon was an interesting addition.

Loved it.  I'll make it again.

After reading the reviews, I was really excited to try this recipe. I love all the spices used, but when my bf came home he asked what in the world that smell was. he just picked at his dinner. I love the spices individually but together with the lime and rum... Something just wasn't quite right. Unfortunately we won't be trying this again. Thanks anyway!
