I can't believe this recipe hasn't been rated yet.  I made these exactly as directed.  Awesome side for homemade soup!  (Roasted tomato tonight.)  Wow.  They would make an excellent side to chicken stew or would make a nice hors d'oeuvres if only having cocktails.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks Tenderflake!

I couldn't find fresh thyme so I used dried but only half of what the recipe called for. I chose the beef broth over the other choices. You need a good sized pan to hold all and be able to stir the onions while cooking. They turned out SO good! I made these for Mother's Day and mom was impressed. I even had my teenage son help me. I hadn't worked with puff pastry before but it was pretty easy.

I made these as an appetizer to bring to a party, they were loved by all! I made these as was written and was a perfect combination of spices. Our family loves French Onion soup.
