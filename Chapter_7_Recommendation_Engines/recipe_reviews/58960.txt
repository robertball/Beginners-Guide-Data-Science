This was fabulous, especially if my husband enjoyed it. A couple of things I did differently: I wanted to make this my whole dinner, so I layed dry noodles on bottom of pan (used bigger pan) instead of cooking them separately. So that meant I needed to use 1 cup of milk instead of 1/4 for more liquid for noodles to cook. I also added a package of snap pea frozen veggy medley mix to the mixture. Worked out GREAT!

Delicious taste. Very easy to fix with just a few ingredients.  I had to substitute the Swiss cheese to regular American cheese and it was great.  Also added a little more mild in ordere for more sauce.  Will fix this again soon.

This recipe is so easy.  I tried it with Cream of Chicken with Herbs plus added fresh rosemary and thyme.  Great.

This was quick and very simple--that I liked. I did add one extra step and use fresh mushrooms that I sauteed in a little butter/evoo, some diced onion and some fresh minced garlic. Though the boys ate it, they all said it didn't have much flavor. I'll try this again but I'll add some spices next time to the chicken. Good base recipe to bend to your own family's tastes.

This was a very good recipe. I added two cans of cream of mushroom soup and cooked the noodles in with the chicken. I also added a can of peas and carrots. I cooked it for 30 minutes and then pulled it out of the oven and sprinkled it with crumbled Ritz crackers. It was delicious!

This is super easy to make and you can modify the recipe to fit what you have on hand. I did not have the chicken soup or swiss cheese. Instead I used 1/2 celery and 1/2 cheese soup with pepper jack cheese. I served asparagus on the side and my family loved it.  I also seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic  and oniopn powder to give it more flavor.

Very tasty & moist chicken. Added some spices before putting the Swiss cheese on the chicken. Baked at 350 for 40 min with foil on dish.

Made this tonight, with the following modifications: added rosemary and thyme (both from a jar), onion powder and garlic. All of these I added to the soup and milk mixture. Would suggest using fresh rosemary next time, some of the sprigs were still hard. I put my chicken (8 tenderloins) in one of my pampered chef stones, covered the chicken with seasoned salt, then put 4 slices of colby jack on top (didn't have any swiss and I'm not a big fan of swiss anyway). Then covered with the soup mixture. Made some bertolli piccolini penne pasta, and served the chicken/soup mixture over the top. Also made some mixed veggies on the side, I don't prefer them but my husband mixed them into his "casserole." It was very very good! Not quite enough sauce for us. Going to double up on the soup mixture next time. Will definately make again. Thanks for the great recipe, it's an awesome last minute meal idea with ingredients most people have on hand.

This recipe was pretty good. Only things I changed were adding some spices to the breasts before covering with shredded cheeses and a little garlic powder in the sauce. I covered with foil and baked at 350 for 45 minutes, then took it out and sprinkled it with crushed Ritz crackers. My boyfriend's reaction was 'wow.' snarf snarf snarf.

If you make this as written, it is very, very bland. If I make again, I will definatley season chicken with salt,papper,garlic, dredge if season flour then brown put in cassaroll dish top with soup mix and cheese then bake. This would be a good recipe for newlyweds that are just learning how to cook.

We used celery with this recipe, it added some good texture.  We also served it on rice instead of pasta.  We will certainly make it again.

This is a great recipe. I made a few changes by using chicken tenderloins which I sauteed, then added to the cooked noodles and sauce. Poured it into a casserole dish and added shredded mixed Italian cheese (swiss, provolone, parmesan, mozzarella) on top. This doubles nicely. I was able to make enough to freeze one! Hubby loved it!

This was OK but nothing special.  It could use more seasoning - I found it pretty bland.  Even the swiss cheese flavor gets lost in all that cream of chicken soup.

Great recipe! I did make a few adjustments. I sprinkled the chicken with Montreal Chicken Seasoning and put in two cans of mushrooms. Sprinkled the sauce with a little pepper. Just finished it for Sunday dinner and everyone loved it. We'll be making this one again! This time I cubed the chicken and melted the cheese and some leftover Velveeta in the mik and then added the soup and mushrooms. Just AWESOME!

Definitely add some spices to the chicken to give it more flavor.  I used some smoked cheese instead of Swiss.  Put minced onion, onion poweder, garlic salt, worstershire sauce and pepper on the chicken before putting the cheese on.  Easy and good.  I cooked the chicken about 15 minutes longer because it wasn't done.

This waws good, I made the sauce exact, but only used two chicken breasts and they were not done in 30 minutes, I had to cook for about 10 minutes longer.  Flavore was good but a bit salty.  Not sure if they make low sodium cream of chicken soup, but I'd try that next time and maybe fresh mushrooms because between the soup, canned mushrooms and cheese that's a lot of salt.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  I did add half a slice of Pepper Jack Cheese on each chicken and instead of noodles I used rice.  I used the mushrooms.  I WILL make this again.  Next time I will add a whole slice of Pepper Jack Cheese to each chicken.

This was very good, even my kids ate it!  I used a small amount of Worcestershire sauce on the chicken before cooking.  I used Monterey Jack cheese instead of Swiss and I added fresh, thyme, rosemary and oregano for spices.  I thought next time I might add more mushrooms, there weren't enought of them in there and a sprinkle of garlic.  I didn't need to add salt or pepper after that, it was perfect!  Thanks for sharing.

I won't even go into how many changes I made just based on what I did and did not have on hand. Basically, this is a great idea that will turn out good even if you do make a bunch of changes and it's nice to have such a versatile dish.

I halved this recipe and made in a bread pan to serve 2.  I loved the way the swiss cheese flavor stood out.  I had fresh mushrooms on top - about 4 oz.  I did not serve over noodles, as I paired it with a pasta salad.  I would say the dish is tasty, but not exceptional.  I would make again - so easy!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and my family hated it. Sorry but it is VERY boring. Maybe some spices would jazz it up a bit, but I wont be trying it again.

Well, I wouldn't really call this a casserole.  And yes, as many other commenters alluded to it could use some more seasonings.  That being said, this is a good simple recipe you can tailor to your own states.  I love the chicken/mushroom/swiss/creamy sauce combo.

Easy and quick!  I did season the chicken with some garlic and steak seasoning (includes salt).  Family ate it all and loved it.  Licked up the left over sauce.

Comforting dinner. I used shredded chicken that was boiled with seasnonings and shredded swiss cheese and fresh sliced mushrooms and threw in half an onion. This turned out great. Didn't take long to make and was cheap!

This was good. It did not take much effort and was tasty. I used 3 thick chicken breast (thats all I had). It took over a hour (covered) to cook. That is the only difference I had. It is not a recipe that will change your life, but it is good when you don't feel like doing much and want some comfort food. We will see how leftovers taste today.

This was surprisingly good.  I didn't have Swiss, so I used American Cheese per another reviewer's suggestion.  Next time, I'll use a mild cheddar, but this dish was still pretty good.  I served it with rice and my husband had seconds and ate all the leftovers.

Great recipie... although I changed a few things, I seasoned the chicken with fresh rosemary and thyme, also added half of a sauteed onion to the soup mixture, and topped with a cup of frozen peas along with the mushrooms came out amazing and flavorful!

I used Chicken and herb soup, that helped with the flavor. I also added some Italian seasoning on top, and 2 sliced of cheese instead of one.

I thought this was kinda bland; however, my kids ate it and that's a rave on it's own.  Maybe using the herbed chicken soup would make it a little tastier.

I had to mess with this recipe a little bit--I used chicken tenders and cream of chicken soup with herbs...I also tossed in some spinach and grated carrot to the soup mixture. I also used angel hair pasta and tossed it with a little olive oil and lemon before I put the chicken on top.

I added a can of cream of celery for more flavor and increased milk to 1 cup so I could have the noodles cook in same dish at the bottom. I also added ritz crackers to end for crunch. It wasn't my favorite casserole but good occasionally.

Super easy and super quick.  Forgot the mushrooms, but I will add them next time.  Also, for very thick chicken, cook for 40 minutes instead of 30.

I followed the recipe exactly as it calls. We found it ok, but pretty bland. I also had to leave it in the oven longer than expected. However, this dish is a good starting point and can be easily added to and flavored to taste! We will try again with some additional ingredients, and I have high hopes for that!

This was great and quick.  I made a couple of changes, gruyre instead of swiss, fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned, and I also sprinkled some dried thyme in the sauce before cooking.  Great meal!

This is so easy to do! I add in Muester Cheese and sometimes pepperjack with the Swiss and it gives it more flavor. I don't find it bland because I add a little garlic. I'm trying it with a twist tonight - I marinaded my chicken in Lemon Pepper sauce, added rosemary, thyme, and garlic to it, then placed the chicken in an 8x8, covered it with swiss & muenster cheese, then poured the chicken and milk sauce over the top!

This recipe was tasty and super quick to prepare!! It was a hit with my husband - he ate one serving and went back for more. I thought it was missing something though, but I'm not quite sure what. I will definitely make it again with a tweak or two. Thanks!!

I changed this recipe so much that I had to rate it based on what I made.  I used Cream of Mushroom Soup.  I used Medium Cheddar Cheese slices.  It turned out lovely and my kids ate it up!
