Great hamburger sauce. I cut the recipe in half and added 2 Tbsp. of sour cream to cut the worcestershire down a bit and give it a creamier taste.

Yum Yum Yum! I could eat this stuff by the spoonful! I used half mayo, half fat-free plain yogurt. I also added a touch of garlic powder. I put this on top of tuna burgers tonight, I can't wait to try it with hamburgers! Thanks :)

My family loves dill pickles and steak sauce on their burgers, so I thought I'd try this.Its great! Its very adaptable, too. Sometimes I add a little ketchup with it. Interesting sauce for many meat or sandwich entrees. Thanks for sharing Kelly.

If you like dill, you'll like this. As usual, I always add more seasonings, but as written it's still wonderful! Thanks Kelly!

This wasnt a bad sauce, it was different...I added a little garlic powder as well.  A good alternative to the traditional ketchup and mustard.

So we had this tonight, and we thought it was great, but is it supposed to be 2 tablespoons or 2 teaspoons on the Dill Weed???  Just a question.

I used 1/3 cup each of low-fat mayonnaise, fat free sour cream and fat free plain yogurt only because I was running out of all three. After tasting it, I added a half teaspoon each of garlic powder and onion powder. This went really well with Tomato Cakes, which are also from this site.

This is a great idea for a different sauce.  I did it using my own proportions, "to taste," and I thought it was much better than plain mayo.

I used this recipe for my baked salmon and it was great! Only added a couple of things just to spice it up. Depending on if you like horseradish. I added a tablespoon,and then a tsp. of lemon pepper. I also liked it with shrimp and crackers.I'm gonna try it in a bread bowl next time. All in all... a Great go to sauce.

This was very yummy. I was looking to duplicate a dill mayo served with fish at a favorite restaurant of mine. This looked like it may be close. I used Dukes light mayo, half the amount of dill, added 1 1/2 tsp. of lemon juice and a sprinkle of salt. It was great on fish! TY

I made this at the last minute just before frying up salmon patties, and the two went great together.  It took the salmon patties from good to being great. I won't make salmon patties again without this sauce.  Thanks so much for sharing such a good and simple recipe!  I look forward to trying it on other things.

I actually used this as a dipping sauce for the 'Zucchini Chips' recipe from here, and we really LOVED it! I used light mayo and added some garlic powder for another layer of flavor, but it was also great as-is. I made it ahead, and let it set in the fridge for all the flavors to mesh. I will definately be trying this on hamburgers next time! Thanks for sharing. :)

I liked this sauce, but it does have a strong flavor.  I think the flavor of the sauce is overpowering the flavor of the hamburger meat.  However if the hamberger meat is not seasoned I highly recommend this Dill Sauce.  If your hamburger meat IS seasoned, then maybe I would try a tablespoon less of Dill.  I still give it 4 stars, it has a good flavor.

I loved it!!! My husband did as well. My son however thought the dill was a bit over powering. Which is fine, more for my husband and I. This will be made regularly now in my home. I took a tip from another review and added some garlic powder and BAM!!! Fantastic!!!!
