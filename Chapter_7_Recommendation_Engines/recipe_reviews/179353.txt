I love the "impossible" recipes from Bisquick!  I usually put the bisquick, eggs and milk in the blender, then pour it over the filling.  Very quick, tasty and easy recipe for sure.

A very easy recipe that tastes wonderful! I served it on a bed of lettuce, with a cold bean and olive salad, sour cream, and fresh guacamole. My whole family loved it!

We love Bisqick Impossible Pies.  The Taco is our favorite.  Served with sour cream and salsa a Spring green salad and baked tortilla chips hot out of the oven. GOOD!!! I shared it now it is a favorite of my entire family.   Alice

Pretty good. My family all loved it. It was quick and easy. I used the Taco Seasoning 1 from this site. It is great and eliminates some of the sodium.  Anyway I will most likely make again.

My whole family loved this. I used one can of Rotel w/chiles, undrained. This added a little moisture to the mix. I also added garlic and onion powder and dried herbs to the Bisquick mixture to add more flavor. This recipe would also be extra yummy with black bean and corn salsa added to the taco meat.

I did make a few changes due to what I had on hand...I used fajita seasoning instead of taco and added a frozen pepper and onion mix...then I mixed it all together including the cheese. It was GREAT!

Easy--I had everything in the house to make it (except a can opener for the chilis but I got that covered).  This is a "make it again" recipe just as it is.  BTW--I used Jiffy mix and it came out very good!

Fine dining this isnt, but few casseroles are. I still gave this a five because whenever I've served it in college, the boys chowed it down. I havent cooked it in 7-8 years but after reminiscing of college days with my wife and friends we decided to try it out again. This time I added some poblano's to the beef/onion while cooking and a bit of adobo sauce to the bisquick mix for a little more smokey flavor.    BTW, this recipe is worthless without beers. Back in the day it would have been Carling Black Label. Now it would probably be a Negro Modelo.

This turned out really good & there were no left overs!  I served it with tomatoes, salsa, guacamole & sour cream.  I have made it twice & will make it again.

This turned out really dry and tastless to me. I will try it again and spice it up a bit!

I didn't have peppers so I used a can of original ro-tel drained.  It was very blah until we added picante sauce and sour cream before serving.  I think I would follow the recipe next time and see how that works.  Some things shouldn't be messed with I guess.

This would taste much better with yellow cornbread on top instead.

Yes, it is easy.  Reminds me of shepard's pie, but as mexican food.  You can add as many spices and hot stuff as you want or leave it just as it is.  Only 4stars because the actual recipe wasn't as spicy as I prefer.
