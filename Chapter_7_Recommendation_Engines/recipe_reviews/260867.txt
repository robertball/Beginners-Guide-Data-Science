I wasn't sure whether this recipe needed regular sized candy canes or the miniature ones. I used regular and was happy with the taste. I also added drops of the peppermint oil until I was happy with the flavor. This is very easy to make according to your preference. This would be a great addition to a cookie tray at Christmas time, or to give as a gift at Valentine's.
