Great recipe.  I didn't have any cream of mushroom soup but was able to re-create using the pan drippings, flour, milk and the mushroom "juice" from the can.  It turned out great!  I will be making this again.

Quick way to get Beef Stroganoff on the table for your family on a weeknight.  The recipe was solid overall, I thought it could have been a bit more flavorful, I might add a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce next time around.  Thanks!

I cooked in an instapot pressure cooker.  I made this using left over beef roast fro the night prior.  Shredded the beef, added all ingredients except the sour cream.  Poured egg noodles on top.
