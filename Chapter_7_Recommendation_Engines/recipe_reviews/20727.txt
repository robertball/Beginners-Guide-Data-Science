This is also a family favorite left over from scouting days. Try this - omit the butter and add some chopped celery. Bake in the oven @ 375 for one hour. I've also used chicken breast with great results.

A good base, but could have used some more flavor. When we go camping, we do something similar but over the campfire. Try adding fresh green beans, canned corn, mushrooms, garlic powder, and seasoned salt instead of regular. The addition of the extra veggies make the meat go further as well as add nutrition.

This general recipe is good, I just have a few comments for people trying this one for the first time. I think that if you have hot coals 30 min. is a bit long. Also, you should experiment with a variety of vegetables. If your meat or veggies come out a too dry, try using meat with higher fat percentage or add a few drops of water before cooking next time. Lastly, for those who think this recipe is a bit bland, I've always put a bouillon cube in for some flavor. Good luck.

I fixed the meals at home then placed them in a well packed cooler, then cooked them on my portable grill. Its a nice way to end a day full or four wheeling fun.

This recipe is awesome, I remember that my mom, a former Girl Scout Troup leader in Hanover Township, PA, used to get us to make this even at home!  We loved it.  Now my kids do too.  My husband decided to use sweet potatoes instead of white ones - yum!  Also, I added some ground up sausage to the meat mixture - this is great!  I think the butter makes the sauce totally delicious!  Bon appetit!

I liked this recipe as a kid. I thought it was neat how a meal was cooked all-in-one and quick. You have to try this on your next trip.

Yummy meal in a fun pouch that my kid loves! After reading other reviews I made the following additions for extra flavor: added worchestershire to the meat, sliced celery and a garlic clove to the veggies, sprinked the potatoes with seasoned sea salt, and topped with snips of fresh sage and rosemary from the garden. Easy, delicious, fun!

When I do these at home, I do the chunk potatoes, carrots, lots of onion, and bell pepper strips over the hamburger, which I have added crushed garlic too. Bake or grill for 45-60 minutes. I drain the grease off and add Velvetta cheese on top and reseal the packets. This makes it a cheesy packet. We always called them "hobo pockets".

Yum! Great burger alternative for those with a wheat allergy.  I mixed ground turkey with bread crumbs, one egg, and spices.  I also placed a slice of bacon under each patty before cooking.  This worked great with parchment paper instead of foil.  Baked at 350 for 35 minutes.  Served with pepper jack cheese and ketchup.

Great recipe, I have loved this meal since I was a child, try this though, omit the butter, instead add two tablespoons worchestershire sauce.

We just did this for our cub scout packing during a camping trip.  They used similar ingredients minus the butter, but also had tater tots.  This was really good too.  It was really popular with the everyone including the kids who originally balked at the idea of meat and veggies in a pouch.  Also, it was only needed on the campfire for 20 minutes and everything was wrapped in a cabbage leaf first.

Very good.  We make this recipe every year when we go camping.  We do add more seasonings - garlic powder, montreal steak seasoning, and seasoned salt.

This was easy to customize for our family members. Each person had a foil packet and put in the veggies that they liked. The ground beef juices certainly flavor the veggies.

good recipe just as it is, but i always add a few dashes of worestichire for flavor before sealing up the packets - try it next time, both the meat and veggies benefit from just a small splash.

Favorite camping meal ever! Try adding bacon instead of butter,depending on your preference.A little minced garlic and burger seasoning(montreal i.e.) is yummy as well. If you want to speed up cooking time I sugget forming the hamburger into meatballs and maybe substituting canned small white potatoes.

delicious!  Try adding ketchup and mustard with the meat and veggies before cooking.  It adds so much flavor.  My mouth is watering just typing this!

This is a FANTASTIC camping staple, and I LOVE having it at home. So quick and easy. A great way to season everything in the foil pack without much effort is to sprinkle Jane's Crazy Mixed-up Salt on top of it. It's the best season-all I've ever had!

Word to the wise, don't throw the foil packet in the actual fire.  I did this while camping, the meal looked and smelled wonderful going in, but after 30 minutes it was burnt to a crisp.  Be sure to put the foil packet in hot coals, not an actual rip-roaring fire.

Excellent for camping! Simple, easy, tastes good, and best of all - minimal dishes created. 

I always make this with chicken and throw in a few extra spices or a sauce of some kind.

Great base recipe for quick and easy meals while camping. All of our scouts and leaders loved these. It's so flexible, you can throw just about any seasoning, meat or veggie in.

The general idea is good.  But you need to season the meat more than what is said here.

We Love this recipe, been making one like it for years. I usually bake in the oven. They are also really good with zuchinni or summer squash. I spray the foil with olive oil spray & sprinkle all with seasoning salt. Yum :)

Great for camping.  I packed some kind of garlic & herbed seasoning and threw it on.  Loved it!
