Wow! This was delicious. Been trying to find a recipe similar to Fish City Grill's rice that they serve with their talapia. This wasn't it, but it was absolutely delicious, and I'm glad I tried it. It has a mildly sweet flavor that complements my blackened talapia toning down some of the spiciness. Easy to make too. It was great without the cilantro and extra onions, but I might try them next time just to see the difference. The slivered almonds are a must though.

Just made it. Very easy - and so good!!! I used pecans instead of almonds as that is what I had in the house. Bringing it to a friends house for dinner tonight.

I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving 2013. It was a hit, so delicious. My husband enjoyed it so much he asked me to make it again.

Super good!  I had left over cranberries I had to use up so I tried this recipe not expecting much.  It has just the right mix of saltiness, sweet and sour.  It's very easy to make.  I'm glad I tried it!

This was excellent! I will definitely make it again at Christmas. I'm generally not a fan of fruit cooked or mixed with "regular" food, but I really liked this. I toasted the almonds and would recommend that extra step.

Very delicious and very easy - the two things that sell me on a dish! I added about twice the amount of cilantro that the recipe called for and I'm glad I did. "Ground Pepper to Taste" is tough. I have no clue how much I added, but the taste is pretty peppery and I'm very happy with it. Next time I'll try to measure so I can be consistent with it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe!  It is easy and tastes awesome!  I really like the flavor that the cranberries add to the pilaf.  I did not have jasmine rice.  I used the generic long grain rice I had on hand and it turned out great.  I will definitely make this again.

This was exactly what I was looking for...super easy and delicious.  I didn't have jasmine, so I used brown rice instead, and it came out wonderfully.  Perfect side for some chicken or fish.  Will definitely be making this more often.

I don't get the great reviews, we found it to be average. It was good, and better than plain rice, but not fantastic. The flavour combo was lovely but seemed to be missing the wow factor I'm reading here.

Wow! So good. The cranberries added a touch of sweetness and the almonds that touch of crunch. This was a perfect side dish for our family's almond themed dinner. Sooo good.

I will make this again. I followed  the recipe as written and love it. There was lots left over and we had it for breakfast the next day. My little 18 month old granddaughter kept saying " More". It's a keeper and my new "standby" recipe for easy to make sides. Yum!

This rice was a huge success.
I did not have the chicken broth on hand, so I found a package of dry chicken noodle soup and used the whole package as it called for 4 c of water.  I reduced the amount a fraction.
I used regular rice, I had on hand.
Great recipe.  Recommendation came as using for Christmas or Thanksgiving dish.

I thought this recipe was great! I omitted the cilantro (because I didn't have any) but otherwise made as directed for a large family dinner. Everyone really enjoyed it and I found it very easy to put together. Thanks for sharing!

Really good. Made exactly according to directions but didn't have the optional green onions. Kids wouldn't eat it but that's their loss.

OH-EMMM-GEEEEE! This dish was so yummy. I used a little less broth (ran out) and added a 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic. My husband, kids and neighbor he dropped in loved it. I served it with Apricot/Raisin Glazed Salmon and fresh broccoli. What an easy and delicious meal over-all. It's official.....I'm a GOURMET COOK!
