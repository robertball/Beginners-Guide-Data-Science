Easy enough to make and delicious! Unfortunately, I did not have dry red wine, so I subbed beef broth. It was still tasty.

Great recipe for not so great cut of beef. My strips were long so I put out steak knives, but we didn't need them the beef was sooo tender!  I did not use as much sour cream as stated and used 1 1/2 lb beef (for my husband's sake).  He liked this recipe better than the one I'd been using for the last 10-15 yrs!  Thanks so much as this one is easier.  (I didn't feel comfortable giving a 5 since I didn't follow the recipe exactly...)
