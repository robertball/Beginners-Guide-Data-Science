I make this recipe all the time, instead of using water, I use 4 cups of chicken broth. Lots of flavor!!

i only gave 4 stars because i made some changes, but i'm sure if i'd followed it exactly it would have been great too! i cut the recipe in half for starters, but because of the runny comment, i only used about 3/4 of a qt and used vegetable broth instead of water.  i also used cream of celery instead of cream of chicken, and i omitted the cheese because i didn't have any on hand.  It came out Wonderful! it was exactly the creamy vegetable soup i was looking for! with the changes, a great vegetarian soup! thanks

I make this recipe ALL THE TIME! Perhaps the other reviewer added to much water, but it isn't too watery with 2 quarts of water. Just be careful when melting the Velvetta to stir often, or the cheese will stick and burn.

This was a great recipe.  After reading other reviews, I halved the recipe and it still made a big pot.  I also doubled the potatoes, used broth instead of water, added 1 cup of chopped carrots, and 2 cups of pulled, cooked chicken.  I also added salt and pepper to taste.  My husband and I thought it was really good.  My 2 year old liked it, too.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for posting.

This was easy and good!  It could be spiced up a little with some seasonings.  I used 1/2 the water and about 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta.  Also, but in 1/2 a bouillon cube.

Very easy recipe I made a large batch and thought it called for too much water-I only used half.  Everyone loved the soup will make again.

This turned out great. It was too rich for some of my kids but the one's that liked it took leftovers for the next two days as well.

I think maybe it should be 3 stars but since I made some changes maybe it was my fault.  I liked this but it was a little to cream of chickeny. I put in one can of chicken broth and one can of water so maybe you do need the other quart of water. I think I wanted a cheeser soup maybe if you replaced one of the cans of cream of chicken with cheddar cheese soup?  My husband really liked it so maybe it was just me.

Best soup EVER! Creamy, cheesy, yummy. I did like everyone else and added two cups of water, 2 cups water instead of the 2 quarts of water. There was def enough to feed 7-8 people. Our family of 5 had 2nds and hubby has enough to take for lunch tomorrow :)

This was good but not incredible.  I added 1/4 cup Picante Sauce for more pizzazz.  Also did NOT use 2 quarts of water.  Instead I used 1 can of chicken broth.  The finished soup a tad was too salty for my taste.

I made this recipe exactly the way stated. It was very watery. I think the water amount is wrong. Had great flavor though. Adjust water and it'll be great. Recipe says it serves 6-7, made with 2 quarts of water it would've served close to 20. I used flour to thicken it a bit. I'll use this recipe again but I will cut the water amount in half.

SO and I are sick so I made this for dinner, reducing the water to 5 cups and adding some seasoning (salt, pepper, parsley) to taste. It was very good this way, very rich, like a stew.

Super yummy for this cold day! I thought maybe there was too much water but it blended well and the cheese wasn't over powering either ^^
