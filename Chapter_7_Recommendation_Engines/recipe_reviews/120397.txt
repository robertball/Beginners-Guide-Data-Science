My family love these cookies, but they are a pain to make.  Here are some tips I picked up over the years making them.  The dough will really stick to your hands at first, but as you make more cookies they will not..you get a nice layer of oil on your hands. So make all the balls at once if you have the room. Also, don't bake these cookies on a stone, they just don't turn out as well. Finally, let them really cool on the the tray first.  then when you take them off the cookie tray put them on wax paper.  If you put them on wire racks the carmel can oozz out.  These are great cookies. I hope you give them a try!

Absolutely the best cookies I have ever made.  My husband said so too.  One tip, sticking unwrapped rolos in the freezer (about 20 minutes) seemed to help with the caramel oozing out problem because it stayed right in the middle for me.  (I also skipped the pecans and the drizzle on top and they were still fantastic!)

Great recipe! My kids said these were amazing. The only thing I changed was putting the Rolos in the freezer for 30 minutes before wrapping them in the dough.  The caramel only oozed out of 1 cookie. I also put powder sugar on my fingers before touching the dough. It will keep the dough from sticking to your fingers. This recipe will definately be on my list of yummy goodies!

My family LOVES this recipe!!! I have been using it for years.  I use 1 cup of sugar in the cookies(to make the measuring easier).  All my other measurments are the same. After I have mixed up the dough I cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 30 minutes to set the dough.  Then it is easier to handle and make into balls around the rolos.  I also omit the pecans and just roll he balls into sugar and then drizzle with white chocolate when done cooking.  These cookies are always a hit.  Be sure to let them cool a little on the pan before moving to a rack or the carmel will ooze out.

This were absolutely delicious. I read the reviews and followed others' suggestions: I froze the Rolos for 20-30 minutes and refrigerated the dough for a half hour before assembly. The rolos didn't burst during baking and the dough was easier to work with, though still a tad sticky. I measured out almost exactly a tablespoon of dough for each rolo (scooped it out with a tablespoon and scraped off the excess) and it was the perfect amount because I ended up with over 60 cookies. Odd that the recipe says the yield was only 30. The cookies definitely taste better after they've cooled because the caramel gets much gooier. These were a hit with family and friends.

This were not as big a pain to make as I thought.  They are very pretty and taste great.  I baked them on parchment and had no issues with them sticking.  I also took the advice to freeze the Rolos and that worked great.  I used white almond bark to drizzle on top.  I heated water, took it off the stove, put a couple squares of the almond bark in a zip lock bag, put the bag in the water until the bark is melted.  All you have to do is snip off a small corner of the bag and use it like a pastry bag to drizzle over the cookies.  When you are done, just throw the zip lock away!

I just finished these. My family loved them. They taste like a brownie I used Hershey Carmel filled Kisses when i ran out of the Rolos. The Hershey Kisses made a softer cookie

These cookies were amazing!  My husband isnt a huge fan of chocolate and even he loved them.  The only thing I will do next time I make the recipe is leave out the pecans.  They dont really do anything for the recipe and seem a pointless addition.

I have made these on numerous occasions and they are ALWAYS a hit!  Definitely easier if you freeze/chill the rolos beforehand so they do not explode when baking, and I prefer to chill the dough a bit too- makes it a little easier to work with.  They're a bit messy to make but WELL worth the effort!

I had a difficult time with this recipe. I am not a baker so I'm sure that had something to do with it. I put too much dough around the Rolo and therefore only ended up with 10 cookies. The dough was really hard to mix so I didn't add the nuts, but did sprinkle them on top. I had some difficulty getting the dough to stay closed over the Rolo so I had to keep washing my hands and putting flour on them. I was tired of working with the cookies so I ended up not putting the white chocolate on top. I think the cookies would have tasted better if they were smaller and therefore closer to the Rolo center. Over all it was a good recipe, but I probably won't make it again and if so, I'll allow myself more time.

WOW.  These are so good that I would buy them!  They taste like a brownie (but with cookie texture) and with caramel in the center.  My changes were to add 1/4 teaspoon salt, I left out the nuts (but still rolled the tops in sugar), and I drizzled those green and red Wilton candy melts on top to make them look festive.  Also I somehow got 40 cookies instead of 30.  The dough was easy to work with and I had 0 oozing problems, even without freezing the Rolos.  So, the verdict: very pretty, very easy, very yummy- what more could you want?

This is one of my favorites to bake (and eat :) They are super good warmed up so the caramel center is gooey and served with milk. Most of my baking is done during the holidays and though they're not christmasy they get eaten. I have changed it some instead of the balls (I found that they spread out while baking an the Rolo made them lumpy) I bake them in mini muffin pans. They come out perfect. I also omit the white chocolate. They really are rich enough.

I thought these were very good. I followed some others recommendations and put the caramels in the freezer before baking. Had no trouble with any caramel leaking.

These are some of the best cookies I have ever made. I did freeze the Rolos for a little while before making the cookies and I didn't have any of the cookies ooze. I didn't use the nuts because I am not a fan. The dough is pretty sticky but I just sprayed a little cooking spray on my hands and it wasn't too bad. I will definitely be making these again!

AMAZING cookies! A little time consuming between unwrapping the rolos and then wrapping the dough around them but well worth the effort. The white chocolate drizzle adds that finishing flare to it.   A keeper in my recipe box and I'll be making them again! Thanks for sharing!!

Good cookie recipe.  I thought it was easier to work with than what some of the other reviewers said.  Keep the dough and the rolos chilled and it's not quite as sticky.  The pecans added more flavor to the cookie and helped to balance some of the sweetness so I wouldn't leave those out.  Next time I will roll them in powdered sugar and cocoa powder instead of the granulated sugar.   I didn't not like the texture with with the sugar on top, but it was pretty.

Just made these and they came out great.  Found it helpful to chill the dough for about an hour before trying to roll. Also could not find rolos anywhere so used a Cadbury Carmello bar instead.

This cookies may be pretty but I found them to be very blah. Once they cool, the caramel inside becomes extremely hard and you have to reheat the cookie in order for it to even taste semi-good. I didn't have any trouble with the recipe and made them just as the recipe calls without any errors. I am extremely disappointed that I spent so much of my baking materials on these cookies!

Very good cookies, my boys love them. I do either cut the nuts in the cookies to half and omit the outer nuts, only dipping in sugar, or for a prettier cookie, cut the nuts inside out all together and just dip them in nuts and sugar. Came out great. Will make again.

These cookies were really good! I was a little hesitant to make them because they are a chocolate cookie and I thought it would be too much chocolate, but its not.  They tasted great. The only trouble I had was some of the caramel came out of the cookies after I cooked them. About half the cookies were fine, but the other half the caramels leaked right out. But they were worth the trouble because they tasted so great!

Made these for work and they were devoured.  I skipped the nuts; there was enough going on with these cookies and it took me ages to wrap the dough around the Rolos.  They do get stale in about a week, so make them for an event where they'll be eaten quickly. My mother didn't think the white chocolate topping was necessary, but I liked it.  I would like to try them with Reese's sometime.  Rich, delicious special-occasion cookies!

I've been making these every Christmas for the past 3 years and they are great. They look beautiful with the white chocolate drizzle, and taste delicious. The chocolate around the Rolo sort of soaks into the cookies so there's an extra gooey layer, it's wonderful. This year I used walnuts instead of pecans and it was just as lovely.

These were easy enough but not so wow.  Made these without chilling the rolos and had no problem with caramel leaking out.  The rolo kept its rolo shape so there was a big lump in the cookie.

These are fabulous!!!  I have to admit that I did not add the pecans or the white chocolate and still I had rave reviews.  I also froze the Rollos prior to baking and I also made the cookie a bit bigger to avoid the carmel melting out.

These are the best cookies ever!!! I have made them several times. They don't last long. I want to start my annual cookies for Christmas and I was wondering if someone had tried freezing them?

These were pretty good but not really special. I took some of the others advise and froze the rolos before wraping them in the cookies and it worked well. I used dutch cocoa which made the cookies black. I think it might be fun to do them this way again for halloween and drizzle them with orange and green colored white chocolate.

These are great fresh, but the caramel centers harden and become rather unpleasant after a few days. I prefer a tasty chocolate chip cookie over these any day.

WOW, THESE WERE AWESOME.  I MADE SOME WITH NUTS AND SOME WITHOUT AND MY 20-YEAR OLD BROTHER (AND HIS FRIENDS) AGREED THAT THEY WERE 'DELICIOUS'.  THEY ATE SO MANY, I HAD TO MAKE A THIRD BATCH...

A big hit at my house! My mom even asked me if I bought them somewhere, they were too good to be true :)  Two tips: 1. I left out the pecans... there is a lot going on in this cookie and the chocolate dough is quite tasty even without the nuts. 2. Be careful not to overheat the white chocolate. If it gets too stiff, add a touch of vegetable oil and mix it over heat, and you should be able to melt and drizzle!

This recipe turned out perfectly. After reading some of the reviews, which I found to be very helpful, the cookies were very easy to make. I placed the dough in the fridge for about 1/2 hour and the rollo's in the freezer for the same amount of time. I used a cookie scoop (1 tablespoon) and made all the balls first, then wrapped the dough around the frozen rollo and rolled them into balls. (No problem with sticky dough) I did not do the pecans or the glaze. I just sprinkled some powdered sugar on them. What a delight. This recipe is a winner!

These were great. Freeze the dough and rolos for approximately 30 minutes. Roll into a complete ball, otherwise they flatten out. Everyone raved.

Yummy!  I baked these with and without the Rolo candy.  I baked these and gave out to local businesses for a holiday treat.  I have had so many people want the recipe and say it's the best cookie they ever tasted.  THANKS allrecipes and Deb Walsh!

Really Really pretty and great!  My husband LOVES them and ate the whole plate!  Dough wasn't as sticky as I thought it would be, and I had no problem forming the balls.  This was a pleasant, easy cookie to make.

I enjoyed making these (very reminiscent of making mud pies as a child), and the taste was amazing (even without the white chocolate), but my hubby and I both have difficulty with our teeth and found these very difficult to eat.  Great idea!  Thanks for putting the fun into baking!

I'm confused about something. The ingredients list 17 TBLSP sugar diveded and also 1 cup pack brown sugar. Then the instructions begin with cream butter, 1 cup sugar and brown sugar? Should it read cream butter 1 cup brown sugar and one half of the divided white sugar?

These have a great chocolate flavour, but are less "carmely" than I would have liked.  I did not have a real problem with the rolo running out while baking, but I also froze them before rolling, just to be sure.

These were the BEST cookies ever. My husband who "doesn't like chocolate cookies" ate a whole batch! Luckily I tripled the recipe! Be sure to grease your hands up before rolling the dough. This is somewhat messy but well worth it!I will make again!

Tastes great!! Definately need to use Rollos though. I tried making some with caramel filled Hershey Kisses, and the caramel all came out onto the pan. A little more time consuming than I thought, I will definately make these on a weekend next time.

These had a great taste, but the white chocolate topping never set completely, so the cookies didn't travel well.  The tops were smudged and messy when I arrived at the party I took them to.  Maybe a little time in the fridge would have helped?  Otherwise, just take care to single-layer.

What a change from the typical Christmas cookie! I made sure I used a full Tbs of dough, flattened it and then placed the rolo in the middle of each. Be sure to roll in hands very well--I did not flatten--these naturally flatten. I doubled this recipe and not even one had caramel seep-age. No worries. ;)

I melted white bark in a saucepan on low and placed it in a plastic baggie, cut the corner & neatly drizzled the tops. I also added green & red sugars for color. Devine! 

My Fiance took these to work and everyone thought they were store bought. lol! I will make these an annual staple in my Christmas cookies. :) THANKS!

I don't typically like caramel. I made these for a cookie exchange. Everyone loved them! I decided to try one myself...and man oh man! Very yummy :)
Highly recommend this one!
I even refridgerated some of the dough and forgot to dip in the sugar (I didn't use almonds either time) and those were great too.

I made the dough following the directions minus the nuts and since I love peanut butter, I filled them with miniature PB cups (walmart's brand are THE best).  I almost didn't get to try them they disappeared so fast!  The cookie reminds me of a chewy brownie.  Awesome!

Now THESE were good! I picked the recipe because it was a little different from your average cookie. Easy to make and the caramel on the inside was great. I left off the last step of dipping in nuts because I didn't have time for that. I think they would have been even better with some mini chocolate chips added into the batter, since mini chocolate chips make EVERYTHING better!

The cookie itself was amazing tasting. Super rich chocolate taste but I found the rolo center to push that richness over the edge. Next time if I decide I want a chocolate cookie I'll be using this recipe but without the addition of the rolo.

Delicious! Didn't bother with the nuts, and I took the reviewers' advice to Freeze the Rolos and to refrigerate the dough first, but these were fantastic. Had no trouble with them after cooling and little trouble with the Rolos bursting. Never seen cookies disappear quite that fast!

I've made these a few times, but yesterday they came to work with  me for a competition.  Out of 8 cookies, I won!  Definitely a recipe that's worth the work.

These were very good, although a little time consuming to make. The texture is more like a brownie, and the cookies are quite beautiful -- I gave them to neighbors for Christmas, and everyone thought they were store-bought because of the appearance. They definitely taste best when they're warm and the caramel is all gooey!

These were terrific. I followed the advice of others and put the Rolos in the freezer for awhile before using. The caramel didn't ooze out of a single cookie while baking. These have officially become part of my annual Christmas cookie repertoire.

LOVE these cookies! First time making them they turned out perfect, they do spread out quite a bit in the oven so be sure to space them good. But my fiance will be eating them all tonight I think!

Awsome cookies!  Even without the white chocolate drizzle these cookies looked & tasted great and were a big hit! I did put the unwrapped rolos in the freezer for 30 mins or so as other reviewers had suggested & had no problems with oozing caramel.  Worth the time to make.

Yummmy...just made these for a Christmas party and they were a hit! I left out the pecans due to nut-allergy concerns and substituted white sugar crystals on the tops for a more decorative appearance. No white chocolate on hand, so I made a plain confectioner's sugar drizzle. Viola, they were awesome and looked store bought!

This recipe is amazing! I followed as directed and they came out perfect. I didn't know how to "cream butter", but I just melted some unsalted butter. I also skipped the white chocolate topping because I haven't appartently mastered the art of melting chocolate. The cookies came out chewy and pretty. The trick to keeping the carmel inside the cookies is to cool them on the cookie sheet completely before removing them. I also greased the pan a little. A big hit with my co-workers and friends. Thanks for posting!!

Excellent cookies! The only thing about them is that they are really messy to make. After trying to roll them up with my hands, I gave in and used my trusty icecream scoop and a spoon mix that gave me a nice clean results! They taste amazing, so will definitely be making them again!

I'm not a cook and found this recipe rather easy.  I took the advice on here by freezing the Rolos for 30 min. and refrigerating the dough for 30 min. before putting out.  I also ran out of time; didn't dip in sugar/pecans or drizzle with white chocolate.  My kids loved it and it was perfect for the cookie exchange I had!!

Awesome!  I decided to skip all the 'extras' and just make the chocolate cookie with the rolos inside.  I don't think it needs all the extras to be tasty!  I found that baking these on a silpat and letting them cool for ten full minutes on the silpat before taking them off prevented the caramel from leaking out and dripping down through the cooling rack.  Much less mess!  Hands down my favorie chocolate cookie!

These were excellent. I would suggest using baking flour to make to cookies bigger and fluffier so the caramel in the middle does not ooze out.

GREAT cookie. I made this last year for a holiday cookie exchange and came in first place !  Only thing I do different is use a little less sugar and I don't do the white chocolate drizzle on top.  I also make some plain without the Rolos. It's a great chocolate cookie all on it's own.

These are yummy and even better with a peanut butter cup.  I think rolos do not have enough caramel to fill the cookie properly so a different caramel candy may have been better, but the peanut butter cups were a better size and filled the cookies just right.  They really do taste a bit like a brownie.

As another person stated, this dough is hard to work with.  I did get close to 4 dozen cookies per batch for my cookie exchange, though.  Also, I had problems with the caramel leaking out of the cookies as they baked if left longer than 8 minutes but if taken out sooner, the cookies were unfinished in the middle. 

The cookies are yummy, but my name for them will now be "Pain in the butt" cookies. ;)

AWESOME!!!!  I used both Rolos and Peanut Butter Cups.  They are both amazing.  I am bringing them to a cookie exchange but everyone who has taste tested them already has loved them.  Didn't have to change a thing on the recipe.  Easy to make and look very nice!!  Thank you!!

The hubby went stupified with these...he loved them!  I am going to use this recipe for a cookie exchange, but make them a touch smaller with mini rolo's instead, this way I can give out 2 dz of these deluctable treats instead of one.
