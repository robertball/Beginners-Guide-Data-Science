This was very tasty, and I would make it again. Just a couple of things . . . in step #2, I believe that the setting that you want is "saute" (not sear). Also, you need to add some oil to the pot in order to get the seasoned floured meat to sear (brown). I used about 2 tablespoons of olive oil. My husband thought it was a bit too "herby", so I'd cut down on the Italian seasoning a bit next time. Overall, a tasty recipe that we enjoyed.
