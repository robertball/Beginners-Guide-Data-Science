Boy, is my husband's staff ever in for a treat tomorrow! These are just awesome, decadent good. I don't care for "prepared frosting" so I improvised a little for the topping.  While the brownies were still warm, I sprinkled them with toasted chopped pecans and poured enough carmamel sauce over to cover.  I stuck the pan in the fridge and when the caramel had set I drizzled the whole thing with a type of ganache - one cup of milk chocolate chips, about a tablespoon of butter, and a good splash of half and half (would have used heavy cream but I didn't have any).  When cutting these, run your knife under hot water and dry before each cut for the neatest, "clean cut" brownies. Pretty to look at and even better to eat!

Wow - this might be the best brownie recipe I have ever tried; served at a party, and everyone ate them right up, including an otherwise vegan, so that was really telling :)  A few notes: 

1) Other reviewers who suggested lining the pan with greased foil had a *great tip*: when it comes time to cut the brownies, it is so easy, with nothing broken  or stuck in the pan.

2) Substitutions/changes: a) Used a dark chocolate brownie mix, and added 1/2 Tbsp Grand Marnier (orange liqueur) to batter; echoed in the cream cheese layer by adding 1 tsp there; b) Doubled the cheesecake layer - in a 9x13 pan, this allows the brownie and cheesecake layers to be about equal; c) for cheescake, used light neufchatel cheese and fat-free sweetended condensed milk - believe me, the end product is still rich and tasty, you won't notice that it's lighter; d) skipped the frosting; these are so tasty and satisfying that it didn't seem necessary.

3)In my oven, 45 minutes would have been too long - baked for 37, until lightly golden, and look for center of cheesecake to still be slightly jiggly; after cooling, allow to get cold in fridge before cutting - makes it so much easier, with no mess.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are really great brownies! Since some of the other reviews said there was too much chocolate, I melted half a bag of milk choc. chips and spread on top. Not only was the choc. not overwelming but since you have to store these in the frig if you reheat one you don't have to worry about the icing melting all over the place. Also I did nnot have a problem with the layers seperating, I used pilsbury fudge brownie mix and fat free(yes!)cream cheese. Not only are these tasty but they look very nice and professional. My VERY picky 4 yr old ate 2 of these. I am very impressed with this recipe and I will make these brownies many, many more time. Thank you Nancy!

Excellent recipe!  Instead of frosting, I topped this with:  6oz chocolate chips and 1/2 cup butter- melt over low heat, then pour over brownies and refrigerate.  This topping is much easier to cut then frosting and very tasty!  Excellent brownies- I will be making these again!

Fantastic dessert!  I used No Pudge Brownie mix (fat free) and reduced fat cream cheese without any trouble.  After reading about problems cutting squares, I lined my pan with foil and sprayed it with oil.  After it baked and cooled, I lifted out the brownies and iced them.  Then I replaced them in the pan and refrigerated them until the icing set.  I took them out on foil again and cut the squares with a pizza cutter.  Worked like a charm!

FIVE STARS IS NOT ENOUGH!  You must try this recipe. I did not have any problems at all with this. I used a Fudge brownie mix from Duncan Hines, followed the cheesecake recipe exactly, except added 1 tsp lemon juice for some tang (oh yes, and low fat cr. cheese) and made my own fudge frosting with 2/3 C unsweetened cocoa pwdr, 3 C pwdr sugar 1 tsp vanilla and enough milk (anout 1/3 C) to make it easy to spread.  Got ABSOLUTE rave reviews. I would not double the cheesecake, it is roughly the same amt as the brownie. Oh yes, and I would recommend less cooking time, mine only took about 30 minutes. You'll love this one!

VERY GOOD, but very sweet and rich! try omitting the frosting and cut the cheesecake topping into the brownie with a knife before cooking to give it a swirled effect. Or try adding chocolate chips to the cheesecake mixture instead of frosting

I've made this recipe a couple of times so far and I'm about to make it again today...it's great.  So easy, so good.  Some things I'd like to mention--I never had the layers separate like some others have posted, but that may be due to chilling them before eating them.  I love them cold, especially with the frosting.  Also, I agree that using the dark and fudgy brownie mix keeps it together better, and tastes better.  Ms. Gervasi, if you made up this recipe all by yourself, you're one smart cookie.

P.S.--of course it's "not a cheesecake, not a brownie"...it's both!  That's the point..;)

Don't try to make them thicker or they will never cook in the middle :)  When using the correct pan, they are wonderful!

YUM!  I made these for my Girl Scout troop and their families for a get-together.  They were gobbled up and I was asked for the recipe immediately.  I chose to put the brownie mixture into muffin cups and then swirled the cheesecake layer with the brownie layer before baking.  They were delicious and moist.  They were SO good, I took another batch with me to my Bunko group 4 days later and again received lots of compliments.  Thanks Nancy!

I followed this recipe exactly as written (excecpt for the frosting). I had no problem with cooking time, but did make the brownies using 3 eggs for cake like brownies.  They were cooked perfectly.  Halfway through the cooking time I sprinkled the top with a bag of Heath Bar Toffee bits mixed with a half bag of choc. chips. The trick is to let the brownies cool completely before cutting, maybe even refrigerate a couple hours before cutting.  Will definatly make again!!! An yummy twist on regular brownies, sure to impress.

Rave reviews on this one ... from my in-laws!  Now they ask me to make it for all the family functions.  I use the Ghiradelli Fudge Brownie Mix and cook the brownie part first for a few minutes before adding the cream cheese topping.

These messy treats were a rave sensation when I took them to work last week. In fact they were voted "best", and the recipe was DEMANDED!  I had the same problem as many of the other people though, I had to fight to keep them from separating and falling apart. In anticipation of the problem I HEAVILY coated the baking pan with Bakers Joy, and I think it helped a lot. These treats were just so moist they wanted to fall apart when I tried to lift them out! I also used a turtle brownie mix, and it was WONDERFUL! I couldn't bring myself to ruin this recipe by piling a prepared frosting on top, so I improvised. After they had been in the refrigerator over night I drizzled the top with Hershey's Syrup and the caramel from the mix...and finished by sprinkling "nut topping" over the whole thing! Soooo yummy! I'm definitely going to make them for our family Christmas party!

Made these today and am disappointed the middle did not cook through. I did read some reviews but should have read a few more of the one who stated to cook brownies first then add topping. I will attempt again as the sides and a few others were cooked and actually tasted good. I even cooked them longer then the 45min because I was worried they wouldn't be cooked through by the time i took them out the cheesecake was brown.

These were really good.  The cheesecake topping was excellent.  I made them for my daughters party at school, and the kids loved them. I tried one myself, and I must say they did have some flaws.  I gave them 5 stars because I'd definately make them again, but there are just a few things I'd do differently.  Firstly, the cheesecake was done, so I took them out.  Cutting them later that night was when I realized the brownie wasn't done.  My daughter thought they were supposed to be that way and referred to them as 'brownie batter cheesecake bars'.  Next time I'd make the brownies 'cake like' opposed to 'fudge like'.  I also found the frosting to be unnecissary.  They'd be fine without it.  Will definately make again!!!  Valentines Day, made again.  I made the brownies cakelike (3 eggs instead of 2), and they turned out perfect. This is a delicious easy recipie, a real crowd pleaser!

These are great!  I read through the reviews to get some ideas.  I used another reviewer's suggestion and lined the pan with foil and used the spray and the pizza cutter - It worked perfectly!!!  Since I was making two batches and wasn't sure if the frosting was going to be too sweet, I made one with the frosting and one without.  I enjoyed them both but the kids definitely preferred the frosting.  These were super easy to make and cooked perfectly.  I will definitely make these again.

This was amazing! I didn't have a brownie mix on hand so had to make homemade brownies. spread the mix thin in a larger pan and put the cheese cake mixture over. To keep it from seperating, I swirled some of the 2 together in the middle, just a little and had no troule. To top it, I made a sweet ganach with 9 ozs semisweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup heavy cream heated to just boiling then poured over chips and stirred until fully incorperated. I waited for it to cool, but still be pourable before pouring over thee brownies. I refrigerated it for a day then cut in squares to put on a serving platter. They were a pretty big hit at our family Christmas party. Very yummy.

I did follow the recipe exactly and the cake turned out ok.  I was not impressed at all with the prepared frosting, it just spoiled the whole dessert.  It was too gooey and made cutting it difficult, presentation was pretty awful.  The brownies in my photos have been in the fridge for 4 days, so now easier to cut and move around...  Next time if I decide to make this again, I will either miss of the frosting all together or make my own.

They weren't as good as I had hoped. But still yummy. I'm going to try an even layer of cheesecake / brownie next time. And made the mistake of using fudge brownies - a bit too rich for my taste :D

My family loved these. Very rich with the frosting on top. The only problem was they don't come out of the pan very well even after greasing the pan.

These were so delicious!  I can't believe I made them!  I followed others advice and lined the brownie pan with aluminum foil sprayed with Pam.  This worked out wonderfully and nothing stuck.  I made them in the evening and refrigerated them overnight and cut them the next morning with a pizza cutter (as another suggested).  What a great idea!  They were just perfect.  I also omitted the chocolate icing as I don't think they really needed it.  They were a great hit at a party I brought them to.  Will definitely make again!

Yum!  Made these in cupcake tins, and the brownie "erupted" through the cheesecake layer, but they still turned out delicious!  I tried one without any frosting, and it was so rich already that I decided not to put frosting on any of them.  Very tasty!

These were just okay for us.  The cheesecake layer did seperate from the brownie layer everytime we cut them.  They tasted pretty good, but not a "knockout".  Followed the recipe as written.    Might play with the recipe someday just for kicks, but won't be a go-to recipe for special occasions.

I thought these were just ok... I expected them to be amazing though.  I didn't feel they were worth the extra effort, and will probably stick with regular brownies next time.

This was really great and my hubby loved it but i took the advice of the review that said use butter and choc chips to make to topping, BAD IDEA it was so gross the butter made it so greasy and gross, we scraped the topping off and ate it without it, next time im just going to use chocolate!!

These may be my new favorite!  I add double the cheesecake mixture.  For the icing I just heated a container of icing in the microwave for a minute and poured it over top.  I also added some crushed Heath bars on top!  DELISH!

since some people review that the batter was not fully cooked.i baked just the brownies batter for 15 min. then topped it with the cheesecake layer. it was done after another 30 min. i melted some bakers sweet chocolate and spread the chocolate over the cheesecake layer. i refrigerated it for over 2 hours. it was devoured in an instant! a BIG hit! :)

Out of this world amazing. I've had this recipe sitting in my recipe box for about 4 years and I finally got around to making it. I followed the recommendation of naples34102 and opted to make my own "frosting" which was more of a ganache... kind of. I used about 1c Hershey's milk chocolate chips and maybe 1/4c butter (didn't measure) and melted them...then added maybe 1/4c sour cream, stirred that in. Yum. Totally random to add the sour cream, (only "cream" i had was milk!) but yum. I also did a VERY thing layer of caramel ice cream topping while the brownies were warm. Let it set in refrigerator about 10 minutes, then added the chocolate topping. Also, following naples, run the knife under hot water and dry it after every cut...I learned this tip at the country club I work at and it makes for beautiful, clean slices. I prepped these before work--even at 6am they tasted wonderful. =)

These were amazing.  I made a batch to take to our son's "Meet the Coaches" night at school.  They were gone in a FLASH.  The teens swarmed over them.  Since I didn't have chocolate frosting on hand, I used 6 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup butter melted together & poured over top.  YUMMY!!

Whoah, these are super rich and pretty tasty! I followed the recipe exactly (for once) and I only have one complaint. The brownie layer and the cheesecake layer did not meld together at all, so that the cheesecake just kind of sits on top of the brownie. No big deal, but it was kind of a pain to cut them because the cheesecake kept sliding off the brownie. Yum, yum :)

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  It was a hit at Christmas!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Nancy--and thanks to all the Reviewers who suggested doubling the cheesecake topping--which made it about half brownie-half cheesecake, and using melted chocolate on top instead of frosting.  I used both tips and everyone raved about these!  My husband has requested that I make them for him to bring to work tomorrow.

These brownies are wonderful!  I made them for a Christmas party and they were a hit!  I used the melted chocolate chips instead of the frosting. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture to add a little more flavor.  I do suggest doubling the cheesecake layer...it was a little thin and hard to taste.  I am making them again this week!

This I tweaked. Bake brownies for about 10 minutes before adding the cheesecake mixture. I did 5 minutes and it still wasnt all of the way done. Just the edges were. It was still very good but just gooey. For the cheesecake mixture I added 2 tbsp lemon juice bc it was too sweet to be cheesecake. I also added 4 oz more cream cheese. I would probably add a full 8 oz of cream cheese next time and leave the other ingredient amounts the same.

Great recipe. My boyfriend is huge fan of fudge and anything chocolate. I decided to surprise him today for his lunch break with the brownies. I loved them. He loved them. I pretty much followed the guide except adding 1 tsp of almond extract and a pinch of cinnamon to the brownie batter.

This is a nice twist on brownies! I thought that the frosting might overwhelm the brownie and cheesecake flavor, so I took melted Hershey's milk chocolate chips and drizzled it  on top. Worked like a charm!

These brownies were very easy to make.  However, the taste just wasn't there.  They weren't very sweet, and ultimately tasted like a box mix with fake frosting on top.

These were a huge hit with my family! I changed it up a bit - I didn't frost them, and instead of layering the cheesecake mix over top of the brownie mix, I swirled the two together and got a really nice marbled effect. Absolutely delicious!!

This is super simple and very tasty.  Instead of using pre-made frosting (don't care for it too much) I melted down a Ghiradhelli dark chocolate bar and poured it over the top.  The resulting dessert had a nice solid frosting top and looked nice.  I will definitely add this in to my regular rotation.  Bonus points for an elegant-feeling update to an old favorite combined with ease of preparation.

I made half of the recipe and felt that these were good, but need more cheese cake.  Maybe the full recipe has more cheesecake goodness.  I made my own brownie batter and used a homemade chocolate glaze on top.

ohhhh the decadence.... these are to die for.  i chose to use a homemade fudge ganache for the top instead of store bought frosting, but otherwise followed this reciipe exactly.  i thought it hada great ratio of brownie to cheesecake....and it was amazing!

I liked these (followed recipe exactly), but I didn't think they were "rave-worthy."  I guess it's possible it was the mix I used, but I didn't really like the texture of the cream cheese topping -- I would have liked something more creamy and less cake-like.  Still weren't bad at all, though, just not my favorite!

So GOOD!! I baked 40 mins. - could have been 5 min. less.  Also did the milk choco. chips/butter & cream for the frosting.
Make again for sure!!

OK. I didn't do this exactly by the recipe, but I do count this as a fantastic idea.  The first thing I did differently was that I didn't use a package of brownie mix - but I made my own using the "Best Brownies" recipe on this site.  Secondly, I didn't make my cheesecake from scratch, but I used cheesecake mix.  And instead of "prepared chocolate frosting" I made mine from scratch using: 1 can of sweetened condensed milk, 3 Tbs. Cocoa powder, a few tablespoons of strong brewed coffee (to taste), and then add confectioners' sugar until desired thickness.  then after you're done making the icing - drizzle it over top the dessert.  It has a fabulous taste, but if your someone who doesn't like "really sweet" desserts, I wouldn't recommend this recipe, either that or cut back on the sugar.  Hope you enjoy! :)

These were yummy.  I actually forgot to add the egg to the cream cheese mix...it was late...and they were very good.  In fact, since I was fearful they'd be too sweet, I didn't even frost entire pan and the, less attractive-two layers went quicker that the frosted section.   Thank you for submitting.

This is a FANTASTIC brownie recipe.  I have made this a couple time now and every time I make it, there is nothing left.  (My hubby can't get enough) I agree with melting the chocolate chips for the topping.  This last time I melted chocolate chips and butterscotch chips together.  Made it even better.  Thanks for this great recipe!  It is definatly a must for my family and friends.  :D

This recipe was a hit!  The only thing I changed was instead of chocolate frosting on top, I sprinkled dark chocolate chips on top before I put it in the oven.  Everyone was asking me for the recipe and I will definitely make it again!

Best brownies I have ever made in my life!  I used Ganache (1 c. of semi sweet chocolate chips and 2/3 c of whipping cream) instead of icing.  Had the best reviews from the party.

For a great tasting brownie layer, use 2 boxes of the Pillsbury Thick & Fudgy Walnut brownie mix, and follow directions on the back of the box for a double batch (fits a 13x9 pan.)  The nuts in the brownie add so much!  I read many of the reviews, and first tried this recipe by making it as written -- very good.  The second time I made it, I doubled the cheesecake mixture as suggested in some of the reviews.  I didn't like this as well because the cheesecake layer was very thick -- it overwhelmed the brownie, and since the cheesecake was so thick, the edges became too dark (and dried out) before it was done in the middle of the pan.  The brownie layer was gooey in the middle of the pan.  I melted leftover Hershey kisses and swirled it over the top -- quick and tasty!  Got good reviews both times from friends, but next time I'll go back to the original recipe and try swirling the cheesecake layer in just a bit.

I needed a quick dessert for my husband to take to a work potluck, and had some brownie mix that I wouldn't have used otherwise, so I chose this recipe.  Very fast and easy to make.  I did not use store-bought frosting though (yuck).  Instead I made Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting from this site and it really made the brownies!  I kind of agree with some reviewers who said the brownie and cheesecake layer don't really "go" well together, but they're still tasty, and I'm glad I made them.

the prep was a bit more time consuming than regular brownies, but the presentation of the layers and the smell (not to mention the taste) was well worth it.  i used 2 tbsp flour instead of cornstarch and i added a bit of cinnamon when i put in the egg mixture.

I don't know if this recipe was awful or I just had a hard time making it.  It was hard to tell when the brownies were done, so when I cut into it after icing it they weren't cooked at all (1 hr baking time).  The topping was good and I will try this recipe again and give it more time.

What an incredible dessert and oh so rich!!  I took this in to work and everyone was amazed and couldn't stop raving about it.  I made it in a springform pan so it looked more like a cheesecake.  Once it was chilled, I microwaved a container of chocolate fudge frosting and poured it over the top so it dripped down the sides.  It looked as good as it tasted!!!

This was pretty good for my first try, but the next time I will make a few changes. I would definitely make the cheesecake part doubled, and I would make "fudgy" brownies on the bottom. This time I made "cakey" ones and they came out a bit dry. 
I didn't put icing on the top, I melted chocolate chips and drizzled that over the top, and then melted strawberry topping and did the same. 
The one complaint I have with the actual recipie is that the cheesecake didn't have much taste to it. I'm going to look at other cheesecake recipies and see if there's something I could add to give it a little more kick.

This turned out to be a big hit at a family dinner party.  I used Giradelli Chocolate Chip Brownie mix and placed it in a round pan to give it more of a "cheesecake" look.  I opted not to use frosting, which I was happy I did because the dish is already very rich.  I will use this recipe again by trying different versions.

11 10 12 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/15424/cheesecake-topped-brownies/ ... Okay, so I bought a box of Pillsbury Mocha Fudge brownie mix.  This recipe is on the back of it.  Yeah, it adds some cinnamon to the topping & calls it "Cappuccino Cheesecake Brownies" & uses less frosting drizzled on top; but it's the same recipe.  'Went looking for it here in case Pillsbury was a submitter so I could save it instead of a piece of paper.  Huh ... :/  :)  I only put in 1/16t cinnamon (their recipe says 1/4t in & 1/2 sprinkled on).  'Couldn't taste it after baking, but could in the batter (I'm one of those).  Since it's not cinnamon, it's nutmeg used for cappuccino & no chocolate, not so sure it's the right name for the recipe except that it looks a little like it with the sprinkling of it on top.  Anyway, it's a good combination.  The brownies were fudgy & the coffee taste was just right.  Now, to adjust my homemade recipe instead of cheating.  :D ...  3 20 17 Note: In this recipe ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/150524/brownie-cheesecake-bars/ ... there are two bars of cream cheese.  Other than that, quite similar.  Huh.  The one egg recipe, from this, can be dry.  Hmmm, two bars or half an egg?  I'll have to find out!  :)  I read that T of cornstarch helps with it not cracking.  'Wonder if it's needed with this brownie recipe, not being a fullfledged cheesecake.  'Wonder, I shall.  :)

So, these were OK, didn't taste bad, just think there are better recipes out there that combine cheesecake and brownies.  I doubled the cheesecake part, and baked about 10 mins longer because the middle portion wasn't done.  Having done this, I think it over-cooked the top of the cheesecake mixture giving it a slightly burnt taste. I understand this could all be my fault since I doubled it, but was following some advice of other reviewers...and I do like to taste the cheesecake. By looking at the picture, I wanted a thicker cheesecake part.  Also, as another reviewer noted, when I cut my brownies to eat them, the cheesecake separates from the brownie...not a big deal, still edible, just have to hold together.  I like these 2 tastes together, just probably won't make this particular recipe again as I've made some other variations I like better, like cheesecake-topped cupcakes.

My family thought these were delicious! They devoured them. Used recipe exactly, brownies were a little bit gooey in middle. Maybe next time I will use more of a cake like brownie to make sure it fully cooks in center.

This is so yummy and soooo easy! I've stopped asking what people want me to bring to get togethers because I know this is what they want. My kids call them "moms famous brownies" makes me feel awesome :D Enjoy!

It doesn't get any easier than this.  I lined my cake pan with foil like others suggested and pulled them out before frosting and cutting with a pizza cutter.  They came out perfectly...beautiful and DELICIOUS!

I was really disappointed with how these brownies turned out. What I found was that the layers of cream cheese and brown seperated from one another when I went to take them out of the pan. Also, I thought the cheesecake layer was a bit drier in other recipes that I have made. I think the first issue could have been resolved by swirling the two layers together..not sure about the second issue. I probably won't make this recipe again.

Very yummy! The only thing I changed was substituted applesauce for the oil in the brownie mix. I also made these in a muffin pan rather than a large pan. These were delicious!

These were just ok for me.  I thought they were too sweet and the cheesecake filling did not taste like cheesecake at all.  However, the layers were pretty and made a nice presentation at a family gathering.

Althought I don't normally eat chocolate, this one seemed very rich and yummy and from the appearance of the picture I could not resist making this treat for my family. I followed the recipe up until I took the brownies out to cool. I did not have any prepared chocolate frosting so I decided to make my own frosting. I used a double broiler and melted 1 cup of nestle chocolate chips with 1 T butter, added some milk and stirred until melted. I then spread this over the cream cheese brownies and I had exactly enough frosting for an 8x8 inch pan. This was not hard to prepare, just took about 10 minutes extra to make the chocolate frosting. I then put it in the refrigerator to set. UPDATE: I was told that this was very rich but in a good way and if it was just cheesecake and brownies without topping it would be perfect, all in all was good. they ate it all up!

Oh my goodness, these are seriously the best brownies I've ever had!  It was super easy to make, and delicious.  I didn't use the whole can of frosting, just enough to put a thin layer on the top, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

I absolutely love this recipe. this has been the only time I have actually made brownies that actually looked like a brownie is suppose to look. I took some to work and everyone loved them. Although I do find that the actually brownie really over powers the cheese mixture I could barely taste it (could it be because I added an extra 3 Tbs of cocoa power to the mix?) also I had to bake the brownies for about an 1hr because after the 45 mins I did the toothpick trick and the center was not done of the actually brownie the cheese part was,  so I put it back in the oven for 10 min cover with aluminum foil. I didn't frost them because to me I thought it would be too much.  Next time I will add about 4 oz more of cheese. Nevertheless I loved them and so did everyone.

FANTASTIC. Made these for a party and work, and got rave reviews both time. Used the One Bowl Brownie recipe and a modified version of the Chocolate Frosting III (1/4 cup butter, 3 tbs milk, 2 tsp corn starch after adequately sweet). Also make in a 9X9 pan with 3/4 the brownie recipe to the whole cheesecake recipe, as I love cheesecake.

This was not what I expected. My own fault. I wanted cheesecake w/ a brownie crust. This was really more brownies w/ cheesecake 'Frosting". The brownie got overcooked in the time it took to cook the cheesecake. I didn't use frosting, since just the thought made my teeth ache, instead I used satiny chocolate glaze from this site, using dark chocolate chips. It had a little bite that was perfect. The taste was good, but the burned brownies and skimpy cheesecake made it a disappointment.

Very good.  However, I took one reviewer's advice and doubled the cream cheese topping - NOT NECESSARY!  It was way too much, and my brownie did not set in the middle (and I baked it for 1.5 hrs; the edges were starting to burn).  But, what did cook, everyone loved.  The cream cheese topping is awesome.  I topped with a final layer of melted chocolate chips.

Made without sweetened condensed milk, put the cheesecake layer over homemade brownies, and did not put a layer of frosting on top. Used vegan cream cheese, turned out fine, not an outstanding dessert, but less boring than the typical brownie. My brother demanded I make these for our family get-together, since I now stick with "black bean brownies", which he hates. He liked these.

These were fantastic.  I made 3 types of brownies for my family Xmas and once people tried this one, it was the only one they ate.  It was rich and decadent, which is how I like my cheesecake and chocolate!

Mmmm!!  I omitted the cornstarch in the cream cheese mix and added choc chips to brownie batter.  I did not frost. I made one batch with the 'fudgy' recipe from the box (2 eggs)  and one batch with the 'cake like' recipe (3 eggs).  I prefer the 'fudgy' version. Made them for a bake sale and sold out right away.  Lots of compliments.  Cheap and Easy!!

These are the world's most decadent brownies! I used the fudgiest brownie mix I could find and topped them with a bittersweet chocolate ganache. I cut them into twelve large squares and took them to the local farmers' market. I sold out in record time and got requests for more the following week.

Made these for our churches small home group.  They were super easy to make and delicious.  I did add a bit more cream cheese to the mix (8oz. more).  Came out really really good.  They taste better chilled!  YUMMY!

These are great. I followed the recipe exactly and I have no complaints. My only suggestion for serving them is you put them in the refridgerator for an hour or so before you serve them so the cheese cake is nice and cold, the only way cheese cake should be eaten. Otherwise it doesn't taste very cream-cheesy. Excellent recipe will definately do again. I also used icing ontop when it was still fairly warm that way the icing melted into a very thin layer and wasnt too heavy and sweet on top.

These are soooo good. Better than Cheesecake Swirl Brownies. You diffently taste the cheesecake. For a simple recipe it took me a little while to make. First I didn't have 'sweetened condensed milk' on hand [after I started making them] I found a recipe to make your own, [on this sight] That saved the day, lol. Finished it, let it cool, went to do the frosting... Nope. None on hand. So I made the frosting given by LuvJezuz on this reveiwing page ,Turned out good, added more milk [about a TBLS.] to the frosting to make it more of a glaze.- This is the next morning and I have less than half a pan left. Also only had an 18.? oz box of a brownie mix ;Worked for me.

I loved these brownies. In my opinion they are much better the second day when they are cold then the first when they are still hot. At first the cheesecake has not completly cooled and so it does not taste as good. These are excellent though. I did make some changes: Instead of using a box mix I made the brownie base from scratch off the back of a Nestle Tollhouse Coco Powder box. Also I did not put frosting on the top, they were already really chocolatly. I did not have any problems with them sticking.

I had hesitated to try this recipe because of the store bought mix and frosting.  I made it to use up a box of brownie mix that I had and was pleasantly surprised--these are really good and extremely easy.  I did make the icing from scratch using the chocolate frosting III recipe from this site.  I think that made a big difference and wasn't much harder than canned frosting.  Will definitely make this again when I need a quick dessert that is a step up from plain brownies.  I think next time I'll add almond extract to the cheesecake mixture to give it a more distinctive taste.

Simply outstanding!!  I make these directly on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.  Once they cool slightly, I put the whole pan in the freezer for 15-20 minutes to firm up for frosting and then cut them with a pizza cutter.  Easy-peasy!!

I made these for a potluck and everyone loved them! Instead of the chocolate frosting on top, I drizzled melted chocolate over the brownies, which I thought dressed them up a little. Very good.

I used fudge brownies and topped with mint chocolate frosting.  Electric oven - still had 9 mins left and top was brown and sides were pulling away!  Delicious, and even better cold.  Everyone said they tasted like an Andes candies - but better.  Thanks!  **Multi tasking and baked 1st batch of brownies without the toppping - oops!**

Yum, yum, yum.  I made no changes to the recipe and it came out wonderful.  I baked mine for 45 minutes in a 9x13 pan (as directed) and the brownies were done as was the cheesecake topping (and I used a brownie mix that was "family" size and meant to be baked in a 9x13 pan.) I don't think the cheesecake was too sweet, but with the frosting, it was a perfect combination.  Thanks for sharing, Nancy.

My husband liked them. But they weren't very tasty to me. It just tasted like a regular brownie, the cheesecake topping didn't "pop" and I followed it to the T. It also took about 1 hour to bake.

I served these at a huge formal party and they were a huge hit. I made a double batch and made one batch swirled(originally I wasn't going to swirl it, but the cheesecake part was extra heavy because of the double amoount so it mixed with the brownie layer) and the other layered. The only differences were that the swirled brownies rose more and the layered brownies looked much prettier on top. I didn't use the chocolate frosting and instead drizzled melted chocolate over the brownies. It tasted great and looked good, too.

I made this recipe as written (except that I omitted the chocolate frosting -- the dessert is rich enough already).  It worked beautifully!! :)  I used a 9x13 glass baking pan greased with canola/vegetable oil, and the brownies didn't stick at all.  I used a fudge brownies mix, so the brownies were moist and fudgy (not dry) even after 45 minutes of baking.  This is a keeper! :)

Oh my goodness, talk about Heaven in a Pan!!  I topped these with a homemade chocolate fudge frositng, and they were spectacular!  The only change I made was to add mini milk chocolate chips to the cheesecake mixture!  I'll never make a pan of "plain" brownies again.  DELICIOUS!!

In my opinion, this was not a good combination. Even though I changed the cheesecake part of this recipe (using the cheesecake batter found in Chantal's NY Cheesecake recipe on this site), the cheesecake on top of the brownie mix did not work well together. Don't get me wrong. . . I love cheesecake and I love brownies. But something about this combination didn't work well. My husband says the texture differences were wrong, and I think he may be right. I hated using all those wonderful (and expenseive) ingredients and not having a top notch dessert. From now on, I'll keep these two delightful desserts as separate entities.

Wonderful....but make sure you cook the cheesecake mixture WITH the brownie mix at same time. First attempt, I didn't follow directions close enough....made brownies first, and then was going to put cheesecake on top, and saw I had screwed up. My husband ate the plain brownies anyhow!  This is a keeper!!!!!

Chewy, yummy, rich, with a thick layer of the cheesecake b/c I only had the brownie mix for an 8x8 pan but that didn't stop me! I used obviously only half the cream cheese mixture. Used neufatchel cheese, reduced to 1TB melted butter. Also omitted frosting. Baked according to the package directions (~28m) and dusted w/ cocoa powder w/ star stencils then chilled in the fridge. My dinner group LOVED it! I would add some (mint? raspberry?)chocolate chips in the brownie batter & lemon juice to the cream cheese mix next time. Make sure to shake the can of sweetened condensed milk well, b/c I did not and some of it was carmelized at the bottom of the can. Now what to do w/ the leftover cream cheese mixture...

First, the reviewer who mentioned the evaporated milk taste being too strong misread the recipe--remember that evaporated mil and sweetened condensed milk are not the same thing!

Second, I would recommend reducing the baking time, 45 minutes was too much in my oven.  Maybe use the minutes recommended on the brownie mix.

Third, I would double the cheesecake layer.  Of course, doubling the cheesecake layer may make it unnecessary to reduce the baking time!

Great recipe. I tried it once and everyone was very hesitant - they all loved it! Even my mom who does not like chocolate and my sister who said that I was messing up a batch of brownies :)

Now, there is a good reason to bake these at least every two weeks. I agreed with previous reviews - do not add frosting (I am a chocolate lover - and it is delicious enough without frosting). 

Thanks!

It had a great taste, even though I baked mine a little longer than I should have.  I tried the muffin tin idea, but forgot to reduce cooking time --my fault.  But they had a great taste.
They didn't fall apart (layer wise) at all, and I did ice mine with chocolate icing.
Mmmm Sinfully Rich!

I love this recipe.  I have seen it on another recipe website, I don't know if the submitter put it there too, but either way it is great!  The frosting makes it a little 'too' chocolaty for my tastes.  They were a hug hit at our church potluck.  Next time I make it, I'll put some cherry pie filling on top for more of a cheesecake effect.  It's wonderful!!!!  Thanks.

Really moist and delicious. I also used the turtle brownie mix with pecans in it and it was even more delicious. I also recommend swirling the two layers. Will definitely use this recipe again.

So delicious! Used a thin layer of chocolate frosting, cut them into small single servings and topped each one w/ a single cherry (canned pie filling) for a more festive look. Very pretty and they disappeard fast at my church's annual cookie exchange. Tried to swirl the brownie and cheesecake layers together to keep them from separating while cutting, but they still did a little.

These are good - what brownie isn't good??!!  But, I was a little disappointed in them - the cheesecake middle doesn't really stand out as much as I had anticipated.  I do like them and I might make them again, but I'll try what one other reviewer did and not frost them but melt choc. chips & butter and pour over the top instead.  These definitely are a great fix for a chocolate craving!

Not exactly what I was hoping for. Daughter and I followed directions accordingly. Wasnt like a cheesecake topping. More like a soft candied like topping with an eggy taste. It was half gone after a couple of days. Just wasnt what I was hoping for. Thought it would be like a chesecake on top of the brownie. Maybe next time we'll just make a cheese cake and put it on top of a brownie.

These were the best ever!! I didn't change any of the ingredients, however, I swirled the cheesecake into the brownie batter and when it was done, I topped it with a chocolate peppermint ganache! Delightful!

I vote drop the cream cheese frosting. I was having so many troubles making it and it didn't taste so good: ( Everything else was really good instead of using a store bought chocolate frosting i mixed whip cream and chocolate sauce. It was delicious!!! I ate most the frosting before everything was done baking.

I cut the recipe in half since my brownie mix was "snack size." It said I should use half an egg, but I just went ahead and mixed in the whole thing and it was fine. They are very rich, so I skipped the chocolate frosting and grated some semi sweet baker's chocolate on top. Verrry yummy. The picky husband and 8 year old loved them. Also suppppper easy and the boys thought they were getting something special ;)

It was awesome!!! I used a low fat brownie and low fat cream cheese and sprinkled the top with chocolate chips it was great!! However, I do warn you that is very rich and probably not a good idea if you don't like very sweet desserts... I love it, to me it is one of the best desserts I've done!! My husband... not soo much...

Easy and AWESOME!  I did as another poster suggested and for the frosting I used chocolate chips and a stick of butter  (duh, how can you go wrong?!)  I'm making 4 batches this weekend for my husband's work.

These were not very tasty. I followed the directions exactly and the "cheesecake" top was nicely browned but the brownies themselves were very under-done. I tried to eat them anyway but the cheesecake didn't taste like cheesecake and kept separating from the brownies. Maybe it was poor execution but i will not waste my time again.

These are great!  I thought the icing would make them way too sweet, so I left that off, but I did throw some mini semi-sweet chocolate chips into the brownie batter.  I made these for a bible study group tonight but of course I had to sample one first :)  I know everyone will enjoy them!

I added half a cup of smooth peanut butter to the cheesecake portion of the recipe.  They were a huge hit at the cook out I brought them to, and three different people asked for the recipe.

These were very good, but I did add some milk chocolate chips to brownie batter. Although good, there are other brownies I like much better, but every one who tasted these loved them.

I've made this twice and will make it many more times! It's perfect for when you want something a little more interesting than plain brownies, but not something as difficult and costly as a full-sized cheesecake. I did have a little trouble with it separating the first time, so the second time I swirled half the batter, then spread the other half on top. I also topped with chocolate chips as soon as it came out of the oven instead of using icing.

This is a fantastic recipe!  It was a hit with my whole family!!!  Can't wait to make it again.  It was delish!!!!!  I did make changes with the frosting since some comments said it was too sweet.  I used half the amount of frosting and mixed it with half a tub (small) of Cool Whip to balance out the sweetness.  It works great with this recipe.

I liked these. I think everyone else at my work did, too because there were none left! I personally thought they were a bit too sweet. Next time I make them I'm going to use a dark chocolate brownie mix, and drizzle the cheesecake topping with melted semisweet chocolate chips instead of frosting. I wanted to do the frosting for the nice layered look...but it really is a bit much as others said. Using foil in the pan made them turn out perfect with no breaking, and someone's suggestion for using a pizza cutter to cut them REALLY helped me get them to look great =)

There were a few things I did, thinking it'd be divine, that probably set me back. 1) Go with just a plane jane brownie mix that you enjoy, I tried Ghiradelli Ultimate brownie mix which turned out to be way to thick but, had it been just brownies it'd be delightful i'm sure. The only problem overall that I really had was the cheesecake layer separated itself from the brownies as I was trying to dish them from the pan. I also opted not to do a frosting as they were very rich on their own. They're very cute and presentable as is, also watch your oven as mine were done in just 35 minutes. Hopefully they'll be a hit as a Thanksgiving treat!

Seriously, words can't describe this dessert!  1.  It is super easy to make.  2. it bakes so nicely.  3.  It is just so yummy especially when it first comes out of the oven.  My family can't keep their hands off this dessert.  I can't keep my hands off.  As soon as my co workers know I brought a batch to work they are all in my office.  A definite crowd pleaser.

I had such high hopes for these brownies, since they were so highly rated, but was far from crazy about them.  To start with, it was hard to get the cheesecake mix to spread evenly over the brownie batter, even after I parbaked just the brownie mix for about 6 minutes, as another reviewer suggested.  The result was the middle bars were mostly cheesecake and not much brownie.  Secondly, the 45 minute cook time listed was far too long and the edges and bottoms were ridiculously dry.  Third, possibly due to the brownie dryness, the cheesecake and frosting separated from the bottom when I went to cut and serve them.  Argh!  Finally, I was less than impressed with the cheesecake layer's flavor.  It had the texture of cheesecake, but tasted overwhelmingly like the sweetened condensed milk and not like cheesecake.  (This was even after refrigeration, as another reviewer suggested.)  I would have given them two stars, but my husband thought they were pretty good, so I decided to give them three.

Fabulous and easy!!  I always have these ingredients on hand, also so it is great for last minute get-togethers.  For a halloween party I used food coloring to turn the cheesecake mixture orange - it was a huge hit!

Made this for hubby who loves both brownies and cheesecake. He said, "they're better than at a restaurant". So needless to say, I'm very pleased.

I made this as directed with only 2 changes.First because I read multiple posts about uncooked brownie batter, I parbaked my brownie layer for 6 minutes before adding the cheesecake layer. It came out perfect. Then in an attempt to avoid layer that I had read about, I ran a knife through to marble it a little bit. That really didn't matter, the layers still separated some. My dessert was chilled from 10am to 8pm so I don't think tempeture made a difference like others had speculated.  All in all, very tasty. I would make this again. I did frost them with Dunkin Heinz Triple Chocolate chip frosting and they were very decadent.

OK, these were hard to rate. I would give them a 2 because they fell apart horribly, but they tasted awesome, so that would be a 5. I decided on a 4 because taste is more important than presentation... to me anyway. I don't think that our box of brownie mix in Canada is as big as yours, because the brownie layer was really skinny! Next time I'll use 2 boxes. Anyways, they were a hit at my husbands work, so I'm sure I'll make them again.

Oh my goodness...these are fantastic!  My husband, brother-in-law, and some my husbands friends raved about these; claiming they "are the best brownies ever!" I really can't disagree.  They are rich, however if you love chocolate..then these brownies are your new bff!

I was so excited to try this recipe since I love both brownies and cheesecake.  The result was... eh... They were good but not great.  Other desserts were eaten first.  I think I probably should have cut back more on the cooking time since they seemed a little overcooked even when I took them out 5 min early.

Sooo yummy! I made these last night. As others suggested, I swirled the brownies and cheesecake before baking and I iced half with the choc. icing and left the other plain. I thought it was so good plain! My husband thought it was just to rich with the additional choc. on top. But, of course, my kids LOVED it!! This is a keeper!

This is so yummy! I took it to a dinner party and it was a hit!! I have given this recipe out several times and each time it was a hit! You really don't need the frosting unless you are feeling like you need the extra chocolate. I've made it both ways and it's delicious either way!

I had a really hard time tasting anything cheesecakey in these, it seemed like just extra effort for the additional creamcheese layer for no pay-off. Instead of using a prepackaged brownie mix, I made "Brooke's bombshell brownies" found on allrecipes. The brownies themselves were GREAT but next time I'll skip the added step of adding the cheesecake topping.

I didn't particularly like these, but my kids all did so I'll give this 4 stars. I did follow the recipe to the T.

This was a super-easy recipe that makes anyone look successful in the kitchen. I made these for a friend's birthday party and the guys tore them up.  After the figure-conscious girls heard the reviews, they couldn't help but cut off a bite to try. Big hit!  Thanks!

These were very good. My kids were fighting over the last piece. I also sent some over to my neighbor and she said they were much better than the boxed cheesecake brownie mixes. When I made them they had just as much cheesecake as brownie on them. I would have like more brownie so I'll just make more brownie batter next time. These are really rich and sweet so they should be cut into small pieces, a little goes a long way.

They were good, and I didn't have any problem with the layers seperating, but they needed "something".  I might try the orange liquer idea.  Also- the brownie was way gooey in the middle.  I'll have to grab an oven thermometer.

These brownies were a hit, and I didn't even use the frosting!  I doubled the cheesecake and cooked it a little bit longer.  I did not have any trouble with the layers coming apart as some have reported.  I think part of the problem that people have with these recipes is that they don't use an oven thermometer.  The thermometer within the oven is not reliable - get yourself a good thermometer and you will see a big difference in how things turn out.  Thanks Nancy for great recipe!

These are the best brownies EVER. I have become famous around my office for making them! They taste great even without the frosting on top. I think they taste the best straight out of the fridge (as a colleague of mine says, when they're cold, they practically melt in your mouth). So if I'm serving them at a party, I'll put out a few at a time and keep the rest in the fridge so that they stay chilled until I serve them.

These are really good. I used fudge brownie mix and skipped the icing. I tried one right after they cooled and didn't care for it although my boyfriend loved them. The cheesecake layer was the problem. The texture was to slimey. I put them in the fridge overnight and the next day they were perfect. The cheesecake mixture had hardened and I am in love.

They were very yummy, but the time/pan size seems to be off... in a 9x13 on 350 for 45 minutes the top was waaay too brown and the middle was not cooked.

i had the same problem as a previous review.  I baked it until the top was a nice golden brown. After cutting into it though to serve at a party, the brownie part was not even close to being done, a bit embarassing!  Still tasted pretty good around the edges

I have mixed feelings about this recipe.  It didn't really set up the way I expected it to.  However, after chilling in the fridge a few hours it is delicious although a little gooey.  I used caramel frosting which was very good.  This is an extremely rich treat, almost (I never thought I'd say this) too rich.

Ok.  I was expecting better considering the prior ratings.  I swirled the brownie batter with the cheesecake batter for appearance.  The pair just don't mesh well together taste-wise.

For some reason, mine didn't come out as sweet as I thought, in the cheesecake layer.  (I think I put in too little condensed milk).  So the frosting was just what it needed.  Otherwise, I might swirl the brownie and cheese next time and leave it at that.

These are very rich but SO good.  I used the pour and frost icing because it was all I had.  It almost turned into fudge after going in the refrigerator.  Cut into small squares, because a little goes a long way.  They taste and cut better cold to me.

Too rich for my husband and me. We could only share one. However, at the school dinner it was the first dessert to go. I like brownies and I like cheesecake but next time, if there is a next time, I will double the cheesecake and do a small amount of drizzled chocolate. Thanks.

Wonderful brownies.  Perfect for my sweet tooth and great for any chocoholic.  Definitely dresses up an ordinary brownie.  The cheesecake layer was perfect as well...just thick enough.  Mmmmm......

GREAT brownies, I made them for a party and people couldn't get enough of them.  I made my own chocolate frosting to go over them though and I think that also helped add the extra goodness (and fat..Hehe!)  Highly recommended!!!

These were fantastic the first day, but after they sat around for a couple of days (in the fridge), they weren't very good and I ended up throwing them away.  I doubled the cheesecake layer like other reviewers suggested - very smart idea!  Otherwise, you won't be able to taste the cheesecake.  By the way, this makes fabulous cheesecake batter!  I had some left over and I sat and ate every bit of it.

These were delicious, very rich.  

45 minutes was a little too long in my oven, the top was too brown but nothing that the frosting couldn't cover.

I froze the leftovers and realized you can eat them right from the freezer.  The brownie and cheesecake stay chewy and the frosting is like fudge.

Oh WOW! SO good! I doubled this recipe since I had a much larger pan and was cooking for a crowd. Be sure to use a really good brownie mix. The cheesecake center is fabulous and the chocolate icing tops it off. Simply delicious!

These were so wickedly good! My mom is a cheesecake fanatic, and the rest of my family loves brownies, so the mix was a hit. Really creative as well. Keep up the amazing work!

Incredible, my family loved this. Instead of frosting, I melted chocolate chips and butter and poured over top like others suggested.  A must try!

I didn't put the frosting on top.  This was such a great idea.  A real hit.  I used turtle brownie mix.  The brownies were a little chewy, so 4 starts.  Definitely will make again.

Wish I could give this more stars! How easy! And always gets rave reviews.  I got three marriage proposals out of this recipe (not that I accepted!)  I used a brownie mix with chocolate chunks in it for more ooomph!, and added toasted walnut pieces on it.  Always getting requests to make them.  A winner of a recipe.  :-)

So rich and delicious and very easy to make.  I didn't use quite a full can of frosting, was afraid it would make it a little too rich.  The pizza cutter is a great idea, nice straight lines and easier to make the sized pieces I wanted.   One of those ideas I should have thought of myself - duh!  I have a very similar recipe to this, minus the frosting, that is made from scratch and done in stages - so much more complicated and really, the taste is the same.  You could easily make this without the frosting and still have an excellent brownie.  Thanks, Nancy!

Wonderful! Did not put the frosting on but served with ice cream and carmel sauce instead.  My husband called it the perfect desert.  (Cheesecake, brownies, ice cream; the best of all worlds)

YUMMY!   I also lined pan with foil and greased the foil and didn't have a problem cutting them after they cooled.  You just have to clean the knife off after slicing each time. Didn't use frosting either.

Very delicious and easy to make. I baked them in a square pan with a removable bottom to avoid breakage. I also put them in the frige for an hour and they cut beautifully! I skipped the frosting because I felt they were perfect as they were! People will demand this recipe!! :)

These brownies were wonderful! I tried one while they were warm and it was okay, I tried one after they had been in the fridge overnight and they were soooooo good! These brownies actually taste better with a little chill on them. I did line my baking pan with foil and spray it with butter flavored pam and they came out with ease...I will use this recipe from now on for my cheesecake brownies..Thanks for a great recipe Nancy!

This recipie is definately a good one. One problem is that it is TOO SWEET! I do suggest making this enither way, just plan on eating only a little at a time. You may also like to skip the frosting.

Very good dessert. I have made this three times. It is a bit rich next time I will take some of the other reviewers suggestions and top with cherry pie filling instead of frosting.

Like the different take on brownies/cheesecake.  Made it for a family gathering and not a single one was left.  If you are a real cheesecake lover...don't think that this cheesecake will satisfy a connoisseur.  It is a very rich, chocolate dessert and it did the trick!

These were so yummy!!  They're a little too sweet for with the frosting, but I made batch without frosting & they were perfect.  These got rave reviews from everyone.  They come out even better if you use one of those "dark & fudgy" brownie recipes (the one I used came with extra syrup to put into the mix).  The dark brownies seem to stay moister.

It wasn't bad.  I used a homemade brownie base that ended up being a little over baked, but that's my fault for baking it for 15 minutes before adding the top. Next time, I'll bake it for less time, first.

As for the topping: eh.  It tasted fine but not enough like cheesecake to me.  Also, did not frost it.  I didn't see the point.

All in all, I'd make it again with some changes.

I made this recipe excatly as written and it was unbearably sweet even without the frosting! I am never one to say that something is to sweet! When the top was done the bottom was still raw and undercooked. The “cheesecake” filling tasted more like eggy sweet plaster. I don’t recommend wasting the ingredients to make this!

Made these for a cookout last weekend & everyone but my husband liked them. they did separate like many said on this site. They were tasty but we prefer just plain brownies. I will try making these once more.

Holy cow these brownies are AWESOME! They are sooooo rich and moist. I did not have one single problem with making these, or with removing them from the pan when it was time to eat them. I didn't use any foil to lift them out or anything extra than what the recipe calls for, I just made sure the pan was well oiled and didnt over cook the dessert. In my oven it took a little over 40 minutes but my oven is kind of old. They serve very well after letting them cool all the way in the fridge. I realize this was created because of no graham crackers but next time i make these, I am totally gonna use some or maybe some Oreos cause these browines need some crunch to offset the tenderness. Great addition for my dessert book!!

I made this recipe as directed and took it to my camera club meeting. Iwas told it's the best thing I've EVER brought and people were asking for the recipe.  It baked perfectly; got done through and through.  It was easy and I'll definitely make it again!

Absolutely loved this recipe. Instead of using the boxed brownie preparation I made mine from scratch then used the cream cheese topping as instructed. I didn't want to overdo the chocolate so instead of frosting I just made a peanut butter chocolate ganache on top which hardened as it set in the fridge making it a perfect combination of of everything good.. A definite keeper

I enjoyed this brownie recipe and took it to a Super Bowl party I attended last night.  I don't use canned frosting so I took other reviewer's suggestions and made a simple ganache to spread on the top (1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, 2 T. butter, and a few splashes of milk melted together until smooth).  My only regret is, I usually add semi-sweet chocolate chips and chopped nuts to any boxed brownie I make, and this time I didn't.  It would have made the final product so decadent.  The next time I will make those changes.  However, I still give this brownie 4.75 stars.

Made these this weekend, however I didn't have corn starch for the cream cheese mix and no chocolate frosting.  These turned out very good.  I found a chocolate ganache recipe and whipped that together and just drizzled it over the brownies.  Very good.  In fact, I'm sure it tastes better than the store bought frosting.  I'll be making
these again.... soon.

Made these for a graduation party and they were a big hit.  I usually don't like using boxed mixes but had to break down and use one and was pleased with how well it turned out.  As noted by another reviewer they didnt seem to completely cook in the center but that was perfectly fine with mine I like it that way.  It may also have been partly due to the oven that I was not use to.

I followed the recipe except that I made my own frosting from scratch because I don't like store-bought.  Unfortunately, this needs to bake probably 15-20 minutes longer than stated.  The cheesecake layer was brown on top and the time had elapsed so I took it out of the oven, cooled it, frosted it and cooled it again.  I was so excited to cut into it but unfortunately the brownie layer was thick and gooey and just not cooked all the way.  I had to throw the whole batch away.  I imagine it would be delicious if it was cooked, though.

These were awesome and went very quickly in my house! The cheesecake topping isn't terribly sweet, so it kind of balances the sweetness of the brownie. Very yummy!

I did not have frosting or any chocolate topping, for the first time ever, so I did not add the chocolate frosting to the top. I bake exactly as written minus the frosting and the cheesecake craked and separated from the brownie, I did use fudge brownie mix and the cheese cake layer was too thin. So, next time I will add another 8 oz of cream cheese, then I will pour a little of the cheesecake batter onto the brownie mix, swirl into brownie mix, then add the rest of the cheese cake mix. Maybe this will help keep it from separating.  I will also try it this way with and without the frosting top.  I will let you know how both turn out. This is a great recipe....just needs some tweaking.

What a great combo, brownies and cheesecake!!!!! I followed recipe exactly except didnt frost the top. I felt no need for it because the dessert is already sweet enough. Mines didn't turn out so pretty but very very yummy :)

I LOVED these!! They were sooo YUMMY. My whole family loved them. I took them over to my family's cookout. They were a big hit. I would recommend cooking them a little longer than suggested. We had ours with vanilla icecream.

Being a die hard cheesecake lover and chocolate fanatic I knew I could not go wrong with this recipe! They turned out exactly as I had hoped, chewy chocolatey, creamy and gooey. These brownies were the best of both worlds. I did swirl the cheese layer with the brownie layer slightly for a marbled effect, and also topped with crushed nuts for texture. I will definately be making these again! Thanks for posting :)

Oh baby! This is a good recipe! I used 1 egg, 2 Tbsp. water and 1/3 cup unsweetened apple sauce in the brownies instead of 2 eggs and the oil and low fat cream cheese in the topping..just to make this less heavy. I also sprinkled about a cup of shredded sweetened coconut and a half cup of slivered almonds on top of the brownie batter then poured the cream cheese mixture on top. I was able to cut them while still warm and didn't have any of the separation problems other cooks mentioned. Maybe the coconut and almonds were the glue that held it all together. These came out absolutely delicious..like a cream cheesy almond joy bar! I wanted to replicate the coconut almond brownie cheesecake from the "Cheesecake Factory" and of course this was much lighter, but the flavors are so there! I will make these brownies again and again..might even try other fun stuff in the middle like peanut butter chips, heath bar pieces or pecans and caramel!

These were good!  We didn't have any condensed milk so I used regular milk, about a 1/4 cup sugar and sour cream. I know, I wasn't sure how it would turn out either but actually it was very good.  Definitely not as sweet as I expected so they were fine with the icing.

My brownies came out very dry, but the cheesecake topping was amazing. I excluded the chocolate frosting. While they were good, it was too heavy of a dessert for me and my family's liking, so I will not be making these again.

These were a huge hit and I would've given them 5 stars, but they only baked halfway.  Given the other reviews, I made a pre-emptive strike and baked the brownie layer for a good 10 minutes before adding the cheesecake layer.  Didn't seem to help much.  They were completely gooey except on the very edge.  In a panic, I put them in the freezer and only took them out right before serving.  I told all my guests they were half baked and everyone still wanted to try them... then everyone ooed and aahed.  They were quite delicious.  Will probably try another recipe where the cheesecake is swirled in so that the whole brownie bakes... Thanks for the idea... and half-baked or not, they got rave reviews.

So very delicious! If I don't bring these nearly to every holiday or party I go to, I'm asked why I didn't make them. Even people who have told me they don't like cheesecake loved these. I usually make my brownies from scratch and it works fine with those too, definitely an awesome combination of two already delicious deserts :)

I made this recipe for a wedding dessert and EVERYONE loved it! It's not very healthy but if you are in the mood to veg out and watch movies and need a sweet tooth fix, this is the recipe that will do it! It's also easy to make.

For taste, I'd give this 5 stars because I made them for a party and everyone enjoyed them. However, I pulled them out of the oven, stuck a toothpick in a few places in the center, and it came out clean. Then, the next day when I went to cut them, the center wasn't done. I had to save the ones in the middle and bake them for my family, so I was a little short for the party. Thanks, and make SURE you bake these all the way through!

These were really good, but just a little rich.  My pregnant friend, who eats everything, could only eat about half of hers...but I ate the whole one, and hers because I LOVE chocolate.  I used Gheradelli Double Chocolate Brownies, and made a bit more of the cream cheese mixture as to offset the chocolate, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  It was delicious and super easy...but be warned this requires a pretty heavy sweet tooth!  Thanks for the post!

very simple and VERY tasty!  fun to serve because they look like you worked a little harder to make them! i topped them with homemade fudge frosting so they were extra good.

I don't know what happened! The cheesecake layer completely came off the brownies! I made them for a bake sale, but there was no way I could send them. Maybe I did something wrong with them?

These brownies are very good. I brought it to a family get together and many of the people said it was too rich for them and only ate a few bites.

These brownies were good and gooey!  The cheesecake part really doesn't stay on the top, but that's OK.  We did not use frosting and felt it really didn't need it.

Everyone loves this, but I can never quite get the cooking time right... I do one and a half of the cheesecake part but it always turns out brown and the brownies are mush in the center of the pan??  Anyone else have this problem?  BTW, I use cherry pie or strawberry tooping instead of frosting...AWESOME!

I usually leave off the frosting, as these are sweet enough and I'm not a fan of frosted brownies anyway. Otherwise, this recipe is perfect as is and I've received many compliments on this wonderful dessert!

This is wonderful!  I to it to a party and everyone loved it.  My husband made the frosting instead of using a store bought one and it tasted great.   It is very rich but now one of my favorite desserts!

When I told my friends that I got the recipe on-line and they were my guinea pigs, they weren't very excited to try dessert.  One bite changed their minds.  This was delicious and they all wanted to take some home.  This was the first time that I didn't have a ton of cake left over from a party.

Fabulous!!! Two of my favortie desserts wrapped up in one package! I was in heaven. I haven't meet a chocolate I didn't like and cheesecake is the second best thing ever created in my opinion, so when you put these two together; how could you possibly go wrong!??!! The only thing I would do any differently is to omit the frosting as this makes it too rich for some people. Not me, of course, but my husband scraped the frosting off and ate it separate. Then went back later and ate the cheescake topped brownie. Can't let anything go to waste, just didn't want it all at the same time, don't ya know!!

I made these for a party we had last night and they were a definite hit.  However, they were a bit too rich.  I think I'll try the melted chocolate topping others have suggested next time to cut down on some of the sweetness. Also, I had problems with my layers separating.  Any suggestions?  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these for my company Christmas party, and everyone really liked them.  The only reason that I give them a 4 is because the layers fell apart.  The flavor was great though, and I would make them again.

Previous reviews for this recipe were really helpful- I made some reccomended changes to use caramel on top instead of the frosting and also line the pan with sprayed foil. I served these at our Christmas party and they were yummy, but the two layers fell apart- no one seemed to mind too much, but they weren't a huge hit either. Personally liked them a lot- the cheescake mixture is great!

Wahoo! I've made this twice in one week for different little get togethers! I'll make it two more times before the year's up! The first time I followed the recipe exactly. The second time, I used vanilla icing (less sugar) and simply dyed it, put sprinkles and it really spruced up for a more delicate looking dessert!
Thanks!

These were really good. I baked the full 45 but probably could've lowered the time to 40 as my brownies were a little bit more than "lightly browned". They turned out great though & i'll probably make again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Way yum! I've used this recipe before out of one of my cookbooks.  With brownie mixes & frostings there's always room to play. I enjoy mine with fudge brownie & dark chocolate frosting for that extra chocolate fix!!

My friends and I have a dinner night where we cook without recipes - this one was so easy to do and tasted so good!  I was a hero.  If you like cheesecake and you like brownies, this is for you.  The only issue:  Sometimes the cheesecake likes to separate from the brownie when serving.  Easy to solve by eating :)

I really didn't like the combo and neither did my husband. I won't make again. Great idea, just not for us. Thanks anyway.

i made this for my family and put it in a square pan, baked for 50 minutes or else it would totally burn.  let cool, put in refridgerator to cool about 2 hours more.  finally i cut into them to find that they are not cooked through.  never so disappointed.  will never make again.

Truly delicious! These helped me win 3rd place in a brownie bake-off! Definitely better the next day, chilled, though! :)

Thanks for the recipe! These are a new favorite :)

VERY good!  One of three Valentine's desserts I made for my boyfriend.  Baked for 41 minutes so that they wouldn't come out hard.  Went light on the frosting, so that the cheesecake flavor wouldn't be masked.  He LOVED them, and I hardly know my way around a kitchen!

I made it, but used a graham cracker crust instead of brownies. It tasted okay...but I thought that the evaporated milk flavour was too strong and it was kind of heavy. It didn't really taste like cheesecake, actually. But my family liked it, so I guess it was alright.

This recipe sounded wonderful but I was disappointed with the cream cheese layer.  It was thin and did not have that rich taste I was looking for.

Very good.  Not super quick but fairly fast.  Not too sweet and not too rich, just right.  Made them as a birthday gift and to sell at a plant where I cater daily.  Makes a generous amount.  I think everyone should try it if they like brownies and cheesecake.

I made this recipe for a bridal shower. I didn't use all the cheese sauce  because I didn't want a deep square. I put the leftover in mini tart shells and topped it with a spoonfull of Canned cherry pie filling. Everybody loved them.

I didn´t like these brownies-cheesecake at all, as another reviewer said they were not a brownie nor a cheesecake, they were a mess to cut out. To my taste they were too sweet, my husband and brother said they were good, but still ... they´ll eat anything!!!, in my opinion this recipe is way overrated.                Moshi

what a yummy mess!  These were impossible to remove from the pan w/o all the layers coming apart and the fosting sticking to the knife.  I ended up with 20 good ones and 20 that went onto the brownie crumb pile.

So rich! So delectible!  We used this instead of a birthday cake for my husband's b'day.  He was pleasantly surprised and it was a big hit with all invited.  What  a great mixture of flavors. Instead of using a plain brownie mix, I used the Turtle mix.  The caramel added just the right touch!
