I got a little happy with the potatoes, and shortening: Increasing each by 1 1/2 tablespoons.  I cut back on the salt, only adding 2 teaspoons.  On this, my first, attempt I also adjusted the flour ratio, having only 5 1/4 cups rye flour, to which I added 3/4 cups whole wheat.  The additional whole wheat made the dough sticky so I ended up blending in another 1/4 - 1/3 cups all purpose flour during kneading. Even with the adjustments this is a nice, dense loaf of bread which is great tasting and ideal for sandwiches (i.e. Meatloaf)

I will try this again with the adjusted salt content and correct flour amounts.  This recipe is a keeper.
