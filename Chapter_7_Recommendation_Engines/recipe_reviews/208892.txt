This was good, but i think it's important to note that the seasoning packet suggested is basically MSG, and quite a bit of MSG at that.  I am a healthy eater and didn't realize this until i had already put the meat in the marinade.  I will stick with the beer and limes and figure out different seasoning for next time...

I just wanted to add that this can be cooked in a frying pan with a little oil.  Just add some sliced onion in there for extra flavor!  Also you do not have to use the beer, it is optional.  Or you may use less if you like.  I also noticed that some of you said it had a lot of sodium, so here is the link to another personal recipe using this same cut of meat    http://allrecipes.com/PersonalRecipe/62305757/Arranchera-Skirt-Steak-Taco-with-beer/Detail.aspx

I made this exactly as written down to the Corona and salsa verde and we loved ever bite.I orginally left the meat in strips but later chopped it up in bite size pieces making it easier to eat. Load them up with cilantro and onions or any topping of your choice and you can't go wrong. Thanks SB. I appreciate you and all that you have shared.

I went online and found that the Sazon's first ingredient was MSG......not good.......so I found a recipe for sazon that should help others here:
Sazon is referred to a lot in Spanish cooking as Sazon Goya. This is the combination of spices needed to replicate the Sazon taste.

 INGREDIENTS:
 1 tspSalt
 1 tspGarlic Powder
 1 tspCumin
 1 tspCoriander
 1 tspAnnatto

 Spanish Sazon (Dry Seasoning) Preparation:

 Combine well and store for future use.
 Even amounts is all that matters. If you need larger quantities double the amount listed.
 Sazon (1 1/4 tsp equals one packet of Sazon


Hope it works for everyone!

THIS WILL NOT DISAPPOINT!!  Hands down, it's the best taco recipe I've EVER made.  Very similar to the "street tacos" from taco carts/stands you see around.  I've served it about 5 times in the last 3 months to different groups of friends, and the compliments were endless.  Definitely my most popular dish!!  For the best results, follow the recipe EXACTLY with ONE exception: Double the lime juice.  This really takes it over the top.  Use very thinly sliced meat and don't overgrill.  Toast corn tortillas on an ungreased skillet.  I love, love, love this recipe!    I've made the included salsa recipe twice now and find it to be good but not as stellar as the meat recipe and maybe just a little too tedious..  The way I've come to love this dish is by making a "relish" (I use equal parts fresh jalape√±o and white onion, with a fair amount of cilantro and a few squirts of more lime juice, and throw it in a food processor until it's chopped to the consistency of pickle relish).  Serve a scoop of that with a few strips of meat, a few sprigs of fresh cilantro leaves, and a bit of hot sauce like Tapatio.  That's all you need!  I've tried Cojita cheese which is good, just not necessary.  Try it - you'll be adding this one to your recipe box for sure!

This recipe is the best I have ever tried I followed the directions to a tee. I made this several times, this last time I used a different brand of achiote seasoning it was a terrible almost bitter taste, that might be why there were some reviewers saying it was bland tasting. Definately buy a good quality of achiote seasoning there are several kinds available.

The meat turned out really goo! However, the reason that I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I couldn't find the sazon seasoning anywhere. I was however, able to find a recipe for sazon seasoning on a different website, So, I made my own (which didn't have all that MSG that other reviewers were complaining about). It was a success! Thanks so much!

Used this on a thick skirt steak.  Not for tacos, just a steak.  Very, very good.  I didn't have any white pepper(had used it all up) so I substituted chipotle hot sauce. Added juice of 1 lime and low sodium soy sauce.  Excellent flavor.  Family gobbled it up w/ avocado salsa.  Thanks ShareBear!

This is a delicious and versatile dish. If I don't have skirt steak on hand, I will use ground beef, sweet onion, 1 cube of cilantro bouillon, and a squeeze of lime juice and cook in a lightly buttered skillet until all ingredients are cooked thoroughly. I soften the corn tortillas in hot oil and serve with fresh cut cilantro, lime, salsa, and tomatoes. Leftovers are hard to come by.

Made very tasty Mexican tacos with this recipe the night I finally thought to look for the arrachera steak meat at a little carniceria (a Latino meat shop)~ & they had it! The meat was very thin - cut differently than Americans cut it. So happy to find it that I then bought a Carta Blanca beer, came home & immediately started marinating it together with the Goya Sazon (w/ coriander/"culantro" & annatto/"achiote"). I cooked it in a pan with a little oil & onions, although I know it would be enhanced by the grill's smokiness. Still, very tasty tacos, especially the next day. But I didn't like the peculiar Goya Sazon's flavor (& MSG) so much, so next time I'll try another Mex./ Latino seasoning, & also try making my own version of Sazon. ~ Thank you, SB, for sharing your recipe!

This recipe is delicious!  It was my first time cooking with Goya seasoning and we are big fans now.  I used flank steak since thats what we had in the freezer and that was the only change I made.  I will be making this again.  Thanks SB!

I bought my meat at a local grocery store and I trimmed quite a bit of fat off of it. I only had 8 packets of sazon goya seasoning and used that with half a lime and the beer and pepper I marinaded it for 4 hours next time I will marinade it longer or overnight...I was very good.  2 pounds doesn't go very far and we are a small family....2 adults and 2 girls..ages 9 and 5.  We all had 2 soft tacos with a little bit of meat left over. I also used my kitchen scissors to cut the meat into bit sized pieces before I cooked it...turned out great. Thanks.

This had a very good flavor and the meat turned out tender. It even tasted better the next day! I am only giving it 4 stars because I felt it needed more spice. Next time I will try mixing a little cayenne with the spices before sprinkling it on.

Made this for an informal BBQ for 10 people. This was a huge hit! The men were continually snacking on the meat after dinner was over (no leftovers)  I doubled recipe but actually decreased the amout of Sazon.  Came out wonderful and I will make this again often.

I bought 5 lbs of steak, seasoned each piece with salt and pepper, minced 3 cloves of garlic, 1/2 c. olive oil, and covered the steaks with cheap beer. IT WAS AWESOME!! Also, make sure that you ask them to trim and run the steak through the machine, otherwise it won't be as lean and tender.

happy accident- i like to add cumin to my mexican recipes, and my cumin and cinnamon jars look alike, so i had a few of these mexican beers that the recipe calls for, and i think you can guess what happened. the cinnamon actually gave it a nice flavor, a little bit of sweet along with the spicy. sounds gross but was actually very good

I must be crazy but I thought this was just OK? I thought the beer gave the stake an odd flavor. I think I would have prefered the taste of lime juice with the sazon.... I am giving it 3 stars only for the fact that the meat was amazingly tender and when stuffed in a taco with other great stuff it was ok.

This was great! I couldn't find skirt steak, so I used a london broil instead. Since it's winter, I broiled the steak about 6 or 7 mins. per side, so it was still a little pink in the very center. I sliced it thin on the bias, and it was amazing! Definitely a keeper!

Excellent!  I made a taco salad out of it instead of tacos.

This was yummy and easy to make. I broiled it in the oven instead of grilling the steak. I also added avocado, cilantro, sour and a salsa ontop of the taco. My family really enjoyed it.

I make this often, but the only thing I would change about this recipe is the amount of sazon goya, I usually use at the most 2 packets or even just one is fine, I crush 2 or 3 cloves of garlic, add some orange juice (fresh from an orange) of course you have to have beer and lime in it, I use 1 lime for the juice, before I squeeze the lime and orange I cut a thin slice of both and add it to the marinade, I also throw in a few sprigs of cilantro, a few slices of fresh onion, or even onion powder would be ok!! I add goya adobo, and some sea salt no measurements, I'd say 1/2 tsp of each. let it sit for at least 30 minutes, throw it on the grill and you got some carne asada!! I'm not criticizing the original recipe, I just want to add some helpful hints, that's all, enjoy

This is a good recipe just a few tips. When you purchase the meat ask the butcher to trim it and tell'em what your making with it. He /she will slice it extreamly thin and run it through a tenderizer. It make's a great difference, skirt steak tends to be tough when cooked. Also I maranade with fresh lime juice and beer, salt and pepper. For roughly 24 hours. Enjoy!!

Turned out just ok. The meat was still a little chewy even after all day in the sauce. Made just as it called for

It was just ok mainly because I discovered I do not like the taste of beer. The steak was very tender.

This was fantastic!  I was a little worried about cooking it that long, but it was perfectly tender.  The only thing I changed was that I didn't have Corona and just used a regular lite beer.  I threw some sliced onions and peppers into the marinade shortly before I grilled everything and made fajitas.  Even my husband had seconds which he never does!

This was great in tacos - I used sandwich steaks, home made sazon, and a lager we had on hand.  I marinated for about 1.5 hours and quickly sauteed the meat in a little olive oil - wonderful flavor - I will make these again.

Calling this marinade Arrachara is quite a stretch. I've had the real thing in Mexico, (got it from my translators mother-in-law) and this marinade isn't even close. Tasted OK,

This is it!!! I finally found a wonderful recipe for taco meat! Thank you so much for this SB! I just made this tonight! I followed the recipe exactly as written, sad to say, the only beer I had in the frig was a ...(uh, hum..) Bud Lite, but I figured, what the heck, I'm not a beer drinker so I don't really want to buy a whole six pack just to use one, so I took a chance, I have to say I am very, very pleased! (But next time I think I will spring for the Corona or Tecate) I actually had Sazon on hand, the brand I have is "Badia" and there's no MSG in it, I've read a few reviews that are concerned about the MSG, I too, avoid it when possible. But the "Badia" is still quite salty, so either way, I suggest being very careful not to over do it with sazon. I served mine just as you suggested, with beans, rice, warm tortillas, I garnished with fresh cilantro, limes, and onion. Wow, it was like I had a taco truck right in my kitchen! This recipe is a true keeper! Thanks again for this, I know I'll make it again and again!

Skirt steak is one of my favorites cuts- always flavorful- so I gave this a try.  Followed the recipe but only made 1 lb of meat (it was enough for the 2 of us) and because of the reviews complaining about it being too salty, I used 1/2 regular Goya Sazon and 1/2 Goya No Salt Sazon (was thrilled to find it in my supermarket). I live in an apartment and don't have ready access to a grill, so I seared it on the flat side of my stove top grill, left it red in the middle, then cut it into small pieces and reheated just before serving.  Since it was red it didn't overcook in the reheat process. I was afraid it would be too bland, but no- it was great, boyfriend loved it. Served on soft taco shells with lettuce shredded cheese, diced avocado, sliced green onion and chunky salsa.  Will definitely make again.

Loved it!  The meat was so tender and a flavor that was unique and I can't wait to make this again.  We made them into a wrap and it was hard to not have seconds!

I love the taste of this marinade! It makes the skirt steak so tender. I also made sliced onion and green pepper and marinated them as well.  Great recipe!
