I doubled this recipe (I actually had two day-old Kaiser rolls to use, believe it or not) and actually made meatballs out of them. I set half aside for tomorrow and used the other half to make Swedish Meatballs in a homemade cream sauce. Delicious!

Delicious recipe Amy! I make Frikadellen for my kids all the time. They love them hot or cold. Adding a little soy sauce and rolling them in breadcrumbs before baking is another variation. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!! Reminds me of home :)

Just the way my Mutti made them - but she breaded them also and called them "bouletten" I make these all the time - they are delicious on the grill also.

I followed the recipe exactly and my family couldn't stop raving about it! Even my 3 year old cleaned his plate. We love German food and will add this to our list of German favorites. Thanks for the recipe!

I have actually made these when I lived About an hour SW of Munich in Germany only I know them under a different name. The name we called them was Rissoles or Koenigsberger but the only difference i used was dill was a spice used and my mother in law who was born and raised in Germany (Swabian dialect) taught me this recipe it is actually one of my favorite and very easy..

Neither myself or my husband liked this recipe.  I made it into a meat loaf rather than burgers or meatballs but I followed the recipe as stated.  We didn’t like the consistency and it was quite bland.  Not sure why it got so many rave reviews.

They came out very good tasting but did not hold together, I will try a meat with less fat and that will do the trick next time. I used sliced bread and it worked great. My mom made these a lot and my aunt too when I visited in her in Germany. We love them.

Frikadellen is one of my favorites at our local German restaurant.  These are good but I am still on the hunt for the recipe with caraway seed.  Thanks for sharing Amy.

Did not have the Hungarian hot paprika.  Perhaps this is what makes the recipe.

I decided to give this a go since my husband is German. He liked it. It's just a flattened meatball.  There was nothing wrong with it but nothing special about it either.  I will say that they were moist and I am sure that can be attributed to the soaked Kaiser roll.

These were really good! We used veal and lamb instead of beef and pork, and didn’t have a Kaiser roll on hand so used some French baguette, but otherwise followed the recipe. They turned out so moist and delicious!

These actually came out AMAZING. I doubled the recipe. The rolls made the hamburgers so moist and delicious. I made a pan gravy to put on top of these. My kids are 3 and 5 and loved this! I couldn't believe how great they came out. Def going to make these often. Cheap and easy!  And I also followed some advice of the reviews and breaded them as well!! Great decision. Added a crispiness to the patties.

I guess I expected to much. We just came back from Germany and I was craving this dish, but I was very disappointed will not try it again  it seems like it lacked more ingredients.  It was very bland.

This was really good. I was afraid my picky eater wouldn't like it, but she had 2. It's nice having a traditional dish from my heritage. I fixed almost as written, with just a bit more pork than hamburger, because that's what was on hand, but everything else the same. Hot Hungarian Paprika is wonderful! Definite keeper.

Delicious!  I also made as a meatloaf and it is the best meatloaf I have ever made!  Very moist!  The kaiser rolls make a great breading for the meat.

This was good. I couldn't find a Kaiser roll locally, so used a ciabatta roll instead. I served it with roasted carrots and potatoes.

These were great!  I used a combo of minced red and green onion, and sauteed with a little garlic before adding to the meat mixture.  Also added some minced fresh mushrooms as well. 
Soaked the Kaiser roll in a combo of milk and water.  Served on a toasted Kaiser roll with sauerkraut with caraway seeds added, spicy kosher pickle, and German mustard.  Will definitely make again!  Wonder how it would be with a slice of Swiss added.  Hmmm.

These are great, better than a plain burger whether grilled or fried. Used recipe exactly, other than all beef as I had no pork. Took to a meeting and all raved. They stay moist inside, crispy outside even if well done. I get six patties to a pound of meat, no more plain burgers for us.

Made tonight for dinner and everyone enjoyed it but not overly so.  When you make this you will thing there is a lot of onion but there won't be.  the excess onion cooks up nicely around the burgers and really taste good.  I took some out of the bowl because I thought way too much but after cooking them I was sad I had taken them out. This is a greasy dish so if you like healthy this is not for you.   I served with green beans as suggested and it was a fairly quick and easy dinner to make.

Yum! Moist and flavorful. I didn't have hot paprika or a kaiser roll so I used sweet p. and a bolillo roll. I have never used moistened bread as a filler before. Excellent results! l might try smoked paprika next time. Mmmmm...leftovers with mushroom gravy.

'Ausgezeichnet', Amy !!!... that means "Excellent" in German as you know... I do them on a round steel grate over wood-fired oak coals on my campfire pit, and make them larger than the soft Kaiser rolls  I serve them on ... they go Great with a local craft Beer too !!!

Wonderful recipe. All nine of us devoured these. So much so that my soon to be twelve year old, "I don't like onions in anything," has requested this for his birthday dinner.
