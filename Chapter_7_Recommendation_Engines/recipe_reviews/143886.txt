I fell in love with crepes one year at IHOP when they were offering them seasonally.  This is a yummy substitute that fills my craving until it's offered again. I give it four stars though because I found the recipe needed some changes.  
I did the last steps of making the cream cheese filling and whipping the cream first, and I put it in the fridge. I'm glad I did this, because cooking the crepes was VERY time-consuming.  2 tablespoons of batter made the crepes too tiny, even when I did tip the pan every which way. So I upped it to about 4 tablespoons or a little less than 1/4 a cup. I also had to cook it on less than medium heat or else it set too fast before I could spread the batter.
   If I had to change anything about my experience, I would have made sure my husband was home to entertain our 15 month old daughter.  Cooking the crepes took so long, let's just say by the time I was done I had a screaming baby, a toy-scattered kitchen, and a messy diaper by the end of it.  If I had used 2 Tablespoons of batter each time, I would have been cooking half the day and brunch would have become afternoon dinner. 
Time-consuming-- yes, but it's worth the result-- at least until IHOP brings back the crepes!

I thought this recipe was great, the filing was a little too sweet for my husband so next time i will cut back on the sugar and i didnt use the lemon zest but aside from that they were excellent

For my best friend's bridal shower I chose a theme "Parisian Cafe" and I used this recipe for the crepes I made as appetizers. I used this recipe in combination with the recipe "Dessert Crepes" also from allrecipes. Everyone LOVED them. One person even told me that these crepes were better than some that she had at her favorite restaurant :)  I also ended up making them again a few days after the shower because they were so good. Both times I made them I didn't use lemon zest and the cream cheese filling still tasted great. The second time I didn't use lemon zest or lemon juice and they were still delicious.

I agree with other reviewers (wish I had read the reviews before making these).  The amount of sugar in the recipe is way too much.  The cream cheese mixture is too sweet.  I ended up adding another 8 ounces of cream cheese just to cut the sweetness and then discarded about a cup of the filling before adding the whipped cream.  I would make these again; however, I would use only 3/4 cup of confectioners sugar (you can always add more if you like, but you can't take it out after the fact).

I made these for my husband today and with the exception of leaving out lemon juice ( I was out) I followed the recipe to the letter.  My Husband ran out of adjectives describing how wonderful they were.  This will be a weekly item for him and I thank you for the fabulous recipe!

These were sooooooo good! After reading other reviews, I used less than the full amount of powdered sugar. I also used regular whipping creamed and whipped it without sweetening it. The filling turned out sweet but not too sweet.  I sliced my strawberries, tossed them with sugar and put them in the fridge while I did the filling and the crepes.   My crepes turned out okay but not great. Kind of blah tasting and they didn't look right but they worked, I think it was my pan. Still a delicious meal!

I used this recipe for the filling, but used the "Basic Crepes" recipe for the actual crepe. They were similar.  Made a couple changes to the filling after reading reviews.  I used only 1 cup of sifted confectioners sugar and I made the filling first and put in the fridge while preparing the crepes.  Next time I think I will leave out the lemon zest & only add 1/2 tsp lemon juice.  Used lowfat cream cheese. Also will increase the vanilla to 1 tsp.  Very filling, but also very good!

My husband especially loved this recipe. I made it to the letter except omitting the whipping cream entirely because I did not have any. I emasciated the strawberries and refrigerated them while I mixed together the cream cheese, powdered sugar, lemon and zest and vanilla. Then I refrigerated that as well. Make the crepes last and using the blender is a MUST! I use 1/4 cup of batter per crepe in a medium saut√© pan over medium heat sprayed with Pam between each crepe. Flip with a silicone spatula when the top becomes almost dry and full of bubbles

This review is for the filling only, as I had already made the crepes using the "basic crepe" recipe, also on this site. I usually make savory crepes, but hubs requested a dessert crepe (odd - as he usually doesn't eat sweets), but I needed a filling. I prepare the filling exactly as directed. I really liked the lemon flavor of the filling, but the kids not so much. The cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla and cream proportions are just right. If you choose to forego the lemon juice, you can always thin it out a bit with a splash of milk. Nice recipe - thanks!

I grew up on strawberry crepes but do not make them very often.  Decided to try this recipe as I make myself strawberry crepes for Mother's Day.  This was delicious!  I love sweets and these were perfect with a glass of milk.  I will be making crepes more often now that I have this recipe!

These are SO wonderful and easy!  It was sweet, but that was what was yummy about it.  We don't have something like this often so it was so fun to splurge.  We used cherry pie filing and canned whipped cream which was easy and yummy.  I think blueberry, strawberry, applie, peach, etc pie filling would work too.  I was able to get to where I was flipping them without a spatula!  When we DO make crepes, this will be our recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Would not change a thing with this recipe. They are wonderful all the way around.  I made my own whipping cream. and used frozen fruit like raspberry, blackberry, mango, and strawberry.  i have never made crepes before and this was easy. Thank you very much for this recipe!

I used this recipe for a Saturday brunch for my lovely wife.  I had already made everything in advance and in the fridge.  The rest was easy and quick.  I did back off on the confectioners sugar a bit.......1 cup.  I used fresh strawberries (as fresh as you can get them in February) but I imagine frozen would do. Delicious!  Thanks.

Just the recipe I was looking for! Drizzled a bit of chocolate on them for decoration. The only thing i did different was used a 1/4 cup of batter for each crepe. The filling was great as a dip for the berries as an appetizer.

Pretty good...not too sweet like others think. I like sweet but not too sweet and these fit in that range of sweet. I only used 1cup powdered sugar and added 1tsp vanilla to the batter. The crepes ended up good but a little greasy. I saved this recipe to make from now on however I plan on leaving out the lemon juice and zest. I used about half of what the recipe called for and I just didn't care for the lemony taste to it.

This recipe is fantastic! The lemon juice and zest just makes these crepes to die for! We followed it exactly - I made the crepes themselves and my fiance made the filling, including whipping the heavy cream by hand. Don't skip this ingredient - it's well worth it and makes the filling all the lighter

These were very good!  I did change some things to suit my family. I slow cooked blueberries with sugar and cornstarch instead of strawberries.  I only put cream cheese mix in the the center.  I put whipped cream on top.  Family loved!

These were great! I cut the powdered sugar back to about 1c and omitted the lemon juice and zest. I also used a different crepe recipe that calls for all milk (no water) and has baking powder.

Very time consuming but the crepes turned out very well. Definitely need at least 1/4 cup of batter for each crepe so this JUST served 4 people. Loved the strawberries.

I wasn't crazy about this one, but it wasn't awful either. In my opinion, the whole thing was way too sweet, which is something I rarely say. To balance out the tooth achingly sweet taste, I added 1/2 of ricotta cheese to the filling, and added some extra lemon juice and zest to really cut through and make a cleaner flavor. Overall, a good recipe for those wanting cavities, but it was simply too sweet for my taste.

I just made these for my husband today, it is his birthday, and we loved them! Not a single change and truly tasty. If you prepped the fruit and filling the night before (assuming the filling will hold up overnight) it would actually be a quick breakfast for any day. We will definitely be trying this again.

Amazing. I used the yield for four and got six. Also using a lower heat setting is much better. Best crape I've ever had.

I made these for my family for Father's Day brunch and what a treat. I read many reviews before making them and they came out amazing. I prepped the filling the day before which gave me a Head start. I reduced the amount of sugar to approximately 3/4 -1 cup and when whipping the cream I added just a tad of powdered sugar. Using 1/4 cup of batter on a well oiled medium sized pan was perfect and I oiled the pan with every other crepe to reduce the amount. I filled with strawberries and raspberries and they came out Devine. My brother said they were the best creeps he's ever had. I will definitely be making these again.

Fantastic! I have been a Strawberry Crepe fan for years and this recipe is better than any I have eaten in restaurants. I followed the recipe exactly only I eliminated the lemon zest since I'm not a lemon fan. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

I made a couple small changes but came out great. I added 1/4 tsp of vanilla to the crepes and used ricotta cheese instead of cream cheese to make the filling healthier.

I loved these! The only thing I did differently was I didn't mix in the Strawberries to the filling. I left the filling regular then used a container of frozen sweetened strawberries defrosted and added some fresh strawberries and plain whip cream to the top it. It made a wonderful sauce. My kids like it with nutella or a drizzle of chocolate syrup and whip cream on top!

Thanks to Rae for her stunning pic that brought my attention to this recipe! These were really nice for a special treat. It was my first time in years making crepes and these were delicious. I especially liked the lemon flavor in the cream mixture. It matched well with the strawberries. I would recommend starting with less sugar and adding more to taste unless you are into a super sweet filling. Also, you will need more than the two tbsp directed to make the crepes a decent size and not too thin. Time consuming, yes, but worth it in the end.

This was a pretty easy recipe to follow. I used my crepe maker to make the crepes which made it even easier! I didn't have icing sugar so I just used normal white sugar, which worked great. The crepes were tasty but REALLY rich...You can't have too many of them, but delicious!

So easy, quick, delicious and filling!  Just the way I love them in a restaurant! I'll definitely be making this recipe again.  I didn't add the butter to the crepes and they were perfect!  I might, however, double the crepe portion of the recipe since there was so much filling. :)

I really liked this but was glad that I looked at other reviews before I made it.  I made sure that I added the lemon juice, since it helps even out the sweetness.  I also started with 3/4 cup of powdered sugar.  That was just the right amount for my group.  Had a lot of the cream cheese mix left over...thinking of maybe a Graham cracker crust with more strawberries on top.  Very close to a no bake cheesecake flavor.  Yum!

Yum! This was the first time I've made crepes and they turned out fantastic. I did use more than 2 T of batter. I probably used about 1/4 of a cup per crepe. Maybe less I didn't measure though. I also used Mascarpone cheese instead of cream cheese. Drizzled with a bit of chocolate syrup. They were so good!! Thanks for the recipe!

I made these the other morning for breakfast and everyone loved them. Next time I may reduce the sugar a bit since I thought they were a little extra sweet but overall they were great! They are very time-consuming but worth it if you have the time. :) Oh and I used the dessert crepes on this website for my crepes and used this recipe for the filling.

This rating is for the filling only, because I used a different recipe for the crepes. We loved the filling spread on the inside with all kinds of fruit! One thing though; it wasn't possible to 'fold' in the whipped cream, I really had to beat it in, in the end. Delicious!

These are phenomenal! The lemon/cream cheese combination are perfect. I took the suggestion of others who commented and reduced the powdered sugar to 1/2 cup and it was great. I will be making this for breakfast every time I have visitors!

I used my own crepe recipe.  I have a good whole wheat oatmeal recipe.  I only used the cheese part.  Although I cut the sugar in half.  It tasted good  with the strawberries.

This has become my new favorite meal! These crepes are so sweet and wonderful. They are creamy and absolutely divine. If you like things sweet -- try these. If you don't, you may want to pass -- they were a bit too sweet for my dad, but I loved them!

They were good, but a bit too sweet.  So much so that my 3 and 5 year old couldn't finish theirs!  I would cut back on the whipped cream and powdered sugar next time.

A bit on the sweet side. With some tweaking this no doubt can be a great recipe.

I just made this and wow it was like having a crepe at a breakfast restaurant! I ate until full but I still want more. The filling makes a lot more than expected so you may want to half that if you are only cooking for 2-3ppl.

Made these last weekend for a dinner party. Had to make another batch since my crepe pan (actually a piadina pan) is so big that I only got about 5 crepes out of the recipe. Came out absolutely delicious, we'll definitely make them again. I also cut down on the sugar and it didn't do any harm. 

(funny though, to say Oh I didn't use the lemon zest and they came out way too sweet - and then telling the OP off about too much sugar. The sugar's to offset the lemon, duh :D )

This recipe is perfect! I didn't do any lemon but other than that, amazing! I had to use a huge pan so used more batter when making it and added a chocolate drizzle. My family loved it. I can't even make scrambled eggs without them catching on fire but baked goods is my forte and this was just plain fun to make. Atleast give it a try if you haven't tried already :) I recommend letting the cream cheese sit for awhile to let it soften or else you'll have a chunky/sugary filling. Good luck!

I liked the recipe but it was a bit too sweet for my taste. I will definitely not use as much sugar as it says. Otherwise they were fantastic. Yes they are time consuming yet extremely worth it!!!!

Just made this for my family, everyone love them!  The only thing I did different was that I decreased the amount of Powdered Sugar for the filling.  The filling is very rich, I did use lemon juice and lemon zest.  Everything was yummy!  I used a little Pam for each crepe cooked, made for easier flipping.  Topped with extra fruit and a dust of powdered sugar made for a lovely presentation!

The recipe was awesome I did make some changes to it ....I didn't put the lemon zest and added half a cup of he sugar and it tastes awesome !! The crepe had too much of the egg flavor so I was wondering if someone had made it with 2 eggs instead of one ? ...but over all was worth it and it tastes AMAZING !

This was awesome! My dad and I made this for my mom on Mother's Day. We used fresh vanilla bean and a splash of Chamborge liqour. We also maserated some raspberrys, blackberries and strawberries in the chamborge for a topping. They were amazing!

This was the best! I was tired of spending 12$ everyday Sunday so decided to give a try . Wasn't the best at the crepe making but  the filling tasted just like the restaurant! It makes a lot so I shared.

Made the cream cheese filling first (didn't use lemon zest) then the crepe mix. I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour. Didn't use the blender, just mixed in a bowl & whisked out the lumps. The crepes cook VERY fast. We wound up having a lot of cream cheese filling left, I feel it is only necessary to make half. The recipe says to put 1/3 C. cream cheese filling in each crepe but that is excessive. Tasted very good. Thanks.

Absolutely loved 'em!  Just as good as ihops!  I have a cast iron "Skookie" skillet that was perfect for forming the crepes.  I've even made this using a can of Reddi Wip whipped cream because I didn't have the heavy cream and they turned out awesome!  We just mixed the cream cheese mixture like it says in the directions.  We spread that on the crepes, added some sliced strawberries, rolled the crepe and  topped with the spray whipped topping.  It was wonderful either way!  My favorite spring recipe for my freshly picked strawberries!

I really enjoyed these crepes.  I made them for my mom's birthday and she thought they were great.  I bought a chocolate syrup to drizzle over the top and the strawberry/chocolate combination was fabulous!

I did not use the crepe portion of this recipe as I prefer the vanilla crepe recipe but I used this filling and cut down powdered sugar to 1 cup and substituted bananas for strawberries. Was VERY rich but delicious!

Crepes were a little time consuming but very easy to make.  Filling was great.  I did use a little less powdered sugar.  I loved the lemon filling to go with the sweet strawberries.

These were out of this world good! If you are in the mood for a sweet treat, please make these. The "filling" is almost like a cream cheese frosting,after you fold in the whipped cream it is total fluffy sweetness. I threw in some blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries to the mix. So good.

This was FANTASTIC!  I sliced up my strawberries and sprinkled with sugar first and let sit in my fridge to make more juices (for sauce).  I also added some whipped cream thinking I wouldn't have enough filling for the amount of crepes I made... wrong.  I ended up having to make another batch of crepes to use the filling.  Just a hint... make sure you use this the same day you mix it up, if you don't the liquid from the strawberries makes it very runny.  Just an FYI!

I loved the recipe. the crepes are very rich though. i served for breakfast with the intention of serving two per person, however, even my growing sons had trouble with more than one. They are very filling! Definitely use a blender or whisk the flour for the crepe part. I did neither, so the crepes had a few small lumps in it.

To save on calories, I used low fat cream cheese. I also only added lemon juice and the sugar, left out the cream. Wonderful filling either way!

I didn't make this recipe's version of the filling, because I have my own that is just cream cheese, a bit of sugar and lemon juice to taste. The crepe recipe itself is FANTASTIC. Easy to blend up, makes a really smooth batter that is the perfect consistency for thin, pliable, delicious crepes.  I ended up filling them with fresh fruit and my cream cheese mixture, topped with marionberry syrup. Will definitely make this one a staple.

These were amazing. My family told me that I should open a restaurant. The only changes that I made was that I used blackberries instead of strawberries and I did cut down to 3/4 cup of powdered sugar per the suggestion of other reviews. I used half of the berries to make a blackberry sauce and used the other half whole for inside the crepes an on top as a garnish. OMG...they were amazing.

Delicious. I would have preferred a sturdier filling than whipped cream though. A Cr√®me anglaise and a touch of whipped cream would be nice.

I mistakenly only had half the cream cheese called for, but that didn't stop me from giving this a go.  My filling was probably thinner than it would've been, but was still amazing!  It was a hit.  Because my family likes different fruits, I spread cream over the crepe, folded it and allowed them to put their fruit choice on top.  My 15 yr old son asked to have it tomorrow, but more of it.

Everyone in my family loved it.  Some of my kids like the strawberries a little sweeter, so I mixed 1/4 cup of sugar with my strawberries and let them sit overnight to sweeten the strawberries and bring out the juices.   I also cut some fresh strawberries for those who didn't want them as sweet.

I mixed in bananas for some and substituted bananas for some.     

I also added 3/4 cup of cool whip instead of 1/2 cup heavy cream, whipped.  This made the filling easier to spread and made it a little less dense.

I kept the leftover batter in the fridge.  The next morning I stirred the batter then made more.  So if you want to make everything the night before or make it before taking some to a friends house you can.

First time making crepes.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were amazing!  Now I don't have to go to Denny's for crepes! Yay!
The only thing comment I have to make is that I ended up with way more vanilla cream cheese than crepes.  Will probably double the crepe recipe next time.

I am wondering if the people who complained the filling was too sweet didn't put too little of whipped cream in?  The ingredients say 1 cup heavy whipping cream, whipped.  So, you should have equal to two cups of whipped cream once you've whipped it.  If you only add 1 cup of whipped cream, it probably will be too sweet.  (Cream doubles in volume when whipped).  You can add more whipped cream  to cut the sweetness.  Also if you don't add the lemon juice and zest, it will taste sweeter.  If you use fresh lemon zest and fresh juice from a lemon(not bottled), it will give a lighter lemon taste that is barely there.  I thought these were great as written.

This was so good.  I did make a few changes. I had made whipped cream with one cup of cream and 2 TBS sugar.  I only added a few TBS of powder sugar in the filling and it was PLENTY sweet.  I did not top with the filling just a dollop of my homemade whipped cream. Made for hubby for fathers day and he loved it.

LOVE THIS RECIPE! made a triple batch and it came out perfect ratios.  I only had about 2/3 of the required sugar on hand on honestly I think it was more than plenty. I don't think I'd care for it if it was any sweeter and I like sweets!  many other reviewers mentioned this as well. but all in all, I will definitely me making this again!

Perfect for Mother's Day brunch! This will be a new family tradition. However, I did reduce the sugar in the filling by 1/2 cup and use the "French Crepes" by Cyberchef as reference for  the crepes.  The recipe made exactly six large crepes using a 12 inch non-stick pan.

5/5! This is easy to make yet looks and tastes like you spent a long time in the kitchen! I made the filling the night before with 3/4 cup icing sugar.  I do have a sweet tooth so i'll use 1 cup the next time.

This was delicious-  I used thawed frozen strawberries mixed with fresh-  the juice made the crepes a little soggy if they weren't eaten right away but no one cared.  Outrageous!

I don't know how, but somehow I turned the crepe into pancakes slathered with cream cheese and topped with strawberries. 10/10 would cook again.

I do the bulk of the cooking in the house so this was my first crepe endeavor. I consider myself a well above average armature. Let us start with the good part, the wife loved the crepes and the overall creation was pretty basic. 
Now the less then satisfied part. These are easily corrected the second time around. There batter was more then enough for the entire neighborhood. I would make about half the batch next time and use 3 tbs. in a 6" pan.  Some have said the filling was too sweet. I did not find this to be so but it was a bear to blend the powdered sugar and cream cheese, glad I used a large deep bowl. the filling was enough for 8 well filled crepes. The topping came out too thick, may be my own fault my use of corn starch sometimes is heavy handed. 

All in all I will make some minor adjustments in the future but they went over with high marks.

This was my first experience at making crepes; considering that I believe they turned out very well. For those of us not knowledgeable in mastering the perfect crepe, it would be wise to advice the size of the pan required--6 to 8 inch, would have been helpful. Because I couldn't fathom using icing sugar, I used Canadian Maple Syrup which added a superb and delicious flavour. I will definitely give these and other crepes more attention in my kitchen. Thank you for enticing my culinary skills!

First time making cepes and they were a hit with my family. They are sweet but they are supposed to be. I followed the recipe exactly except for reducing the powdered sugar to one cup. The lemon zest and juice adds a nice balance to the filling. I used a quarter cup of batter to a ten inch skillet on medium heat, spraying with oil between crepes. Yielded nine crepes.

I chose to make the crepe portion- a 2/3 amount so I wasn't making crepes all night. I made the filling ahead as suggested which worked great. I used 3/4 cup of confectioners sugar which I think worked great. I also cut the lemon juice and lemon zest in half. I Loved the filling and so did my hubby.

Honestly, I didn't try the crepe batter part of this recipe... 
However, I did make the creamy, tangy, lemony filling and had it with strawberry crepes (a family recipe). The filling was SO GOOD. Will definitely look for other ways to use it...

I wish there was someplace we could add comments on All Recipe's new format.  I DON'T LIKE IT.   I much prefer listening to somebody do the recipe and explain what they are doing in place of that fast text and all that noise some people call music.  I have friends and other family members that used to like All Recipes site, but don't use it much anymore because of the new slant you are using on showing your recipes.  I will check back once in awhile and hope you get it together and get back to the more user friendly style you used to use.

Holy cow. These are delicious. My fiancee is a crepe fiend that used to work at a crepe, food truck. So, she is very picky when it comes to crepes. I made these for her for breakfast the other morning and she fell in love with them. The only problem is that now she wants me to make them for breakfast every morning. Do yourself a favor, make these.

I made these crepes again and they are delicious.  This is a great recipe.  I use pineapple instead of strawberries because I'm allergic to berries.  It was sooooo good.

I have never made crepes before but love them when out to eat at the breakfast restaurants...Always thought they were too hard to make & since my kids never minded having pancakes, I just never tried! Didn‚Äôt change a thing about this recipe. Would only ad that they cooked up beautifully on my ‚Äúseasoned‚Äù cast iron griddle! They are time consuming but worth the effort! I‚Äôll be making these again for breakfast at holiday gatherings for sure!

I sifted the flour the second time around because when I didn‚Äôt the batter turned lumpy and cooked unevenly. But other than that this is my favorite Sunday morning breakfast now!

Very good recipe- I've made a lot of crepes, and I love this recipe for:
a) easy to manipulate crepe batter proportions
b) simple ingredients
c) quick and easy
A lot of recipes can be a bit daunting and while I love making real pastry cream and have labored over elaborate French desserts, it can be time consuming, so I appreciate a simple, easy cream cheese filling that makes for a satisfying treat- fast.

My favorite part of this recipe: the water proportions makes this a perfectly spreadable & viscous batter to make it easy to swirl in a regular pan. Many other recipes are a TINY bit too thick, making it hard to swirl. This is the perfect consistency. 

The only reason I deducted a star: too much sugar in the cream cheese filling! I admit I'm sensitive to sweets, so I'm biased, but I still think this would be perfect with half the sugar.

I didn‚Äôt add the butter to the recipe, but added a small amount of butter to the pan each time I poured in more batter . The crepes and filling were delicious! This recipe is the closest to the recipe I have previously used. I‚Äôm happy to have found it. I will use it again.

I followed the directions but did cut back the amount of powdered sugar to 3/4 C. It was wonderful! My daughter thought it was better than IHOP! I will be making these again and try different fruit as well!!

First time making crepes and these came out spectacular! I added 1/2 cup of white sugar and the vanilla to the whipping cream when I whipped it and set a little aside to top the crepes with then just cut the powdered sugar in half when combining with the cream cheese. Excellent.

We only made the filling part and it was amazing. We've made ti twice already. Didn't add the full amount of confectioner's sugar, like other reviews suggested. Not too sweet but perfect in every way! So good.

I use this recipe for the filling only. I've made the crepes using it a couple of times, but there are better crepe recipes out there, in my opinion. But the filling is to die for! A perfect addition to not only crepes, but to pancakes, French toast, and waffles as well.

I made this for dessert tonight, and these crepes were delicious. I did use blackberries instead of strawberries, due to no organic strawberries at my grocery store. And I did use a bit less than 1/4 cup of batter for each crepe- I wasn't able to get it to spread properly with less batter than that. LOVED the ease of mixing the batter in the blender, and will use that tip for savory crepes too. My entire family loved them. I will be making these again.

These were marvelous! 
I made them exactly as indicated. 
The creme mixture is absolutely delightful! 
I agree with other reviewers that they are a little sweet, but that's one thing I really liked about them. The lemon offsets the sweetness and the strawberries add substance and texture.
I didn't think I liked crepes, but these will be something I will make again and again!

This was really good.   I did make a change as I did not have heavy cream and don't cook with it because of cholesterol. I decided to use one of those strawberry yogurt tubes the grandkids eat all the time instead of the cream AND I totally left out all of the sugar. I squeezed the whole tube into my Magic bullet blender and blended it with the cream cheese.  it was great.

I just made these for friends as a Sunday brunch and they turned out very good. They were a hit. I followed the recipe as is very closely. My only criticism is that there was a lot of filling and strawberries left over. I would recommend either doubling the crepe mixture or cutting the filling and strawberries in half.

Do the sweet n savory version. I use Amaretto and the whole family loves it. As for the filling, Don't Forget the Zest. It changes everything. When cooking the crepes, butter and movement, lots of both.

This was fantastic! Use a non stick pan and you don't have to use oil to make the crepes. I also had to make two batches f crepes as the filling is so rich and sweet! I would cut the sugar to about 1/4 - 1/2 cup in the future.  I rolled them up without filling and put mapel syrup on these for the little kids.

DELICIOUS! Definitely a keeper recipe! I made this dessert for mother's day and my mom enjoyed the gesture (and the food ;) The crepes turned out beautifully, and my usual nonstick pan worked magically as a substitute for a specialized crepe pan! The batter thinned out beautifully and I loved this dish! Thank you, meliss!

Yum! I have made strawberry crepes many times but, I think this is the best! I have used the same crepe recipe for years (in the Seattle Classic Cookbook) so did not use the one here. I used 1/2 cup of powdered sugar and it was perfect! I will make these again!

I just purchased a new crepe pan and wanted to try a new recipe. This was a home run! I followed ALMOST to a T, but I only added 3/4 t of powdered sugar at the suggestion of other reviewers and I'm glad that I did. It was plenty sweet enough. This is definitely a keeper and is saved on my favorites!

I only made the filling and it turned out super yummy. We had it in crepes (from another recipe) and the rest went on homemade waffles with strawberry syrup on top. I think the waffles were my favorite. It spread into them really great.

I made the crepes for a birthday party, doubling the recipe. It is time consuming but worth it. Everyone really liked them. My teenage daughter said it was the best thing she's ever eaten! I feel as though the filling, along with the strawberries makes it what it is...Mmm.  Another guest requested I make these for his party. ;-)

Excellent! I used canned blueberries in a light syrup (wasn't very sweet) and they were so yummy! I don't think the filling is too sweet at all, especially when using fresh/canned fruit that may be a bit tart on its own. I followed the recipe exactly, except for the use of blueberries. The filling is so fluffy and perfect with the delicious crepes. I saw a review that complained that 2 T of batter isn't enough.  It IS enough if you are using a small skillet. Crepes are meant to be very thin. If you have a medium sized skillet, then by all means, use more batter.

I agree these crepes are very good. I agree they are too sweet.  I also have suggestions about the Directions. Step 1 should have Batter as first word & Step 2 first word should be Filling. When reading 1 & 2 it is not impossible to see 2 as a continuation of 1. Move the whipping of the heavy cream into Directions as step 1 AND note that you need either two mixer bowls or clean the first bowl before proceeding. Yes it was too sweet and I attribute that to both the cream cheese and the confectioners  sugar. I'd  suggest  being more specific about the cream cheese by noting not using whipped or high end cream cheese that can curdle . Otherwise excellent and amazing how long it takes!

I only used the creme filling part of the recipe and I thought it was very good!  Not too sweet, but if someone thinks it is, it would be very easy to adjust by reducing the sugar.  I did not have lemon zest, so I just omitted that part of the recipe and used the "Dessert Crepes" recipe from allrecipes to put the filling in, as well as fresh sliced strawberries.  YUMMY!

These crepes were delicious but they are very heavy! I recommend to serve them as a desert instead of a breakfast option. I had my fill after eating one but they were so good I forced another down! It's like a no bake cheesecake in a crepe! A definite must try!

I love this recipe.   In reference to other people's comments on how the cream is too sweet, I added 1/2 cup sour cream instead of whipped cream.  The tartness was the perfect compliment to the sugar.  My kids absolutely loved them.

These were a big hit on Mother's Day. I did leave out about 1/2 cup of the confectioners sugar, as some of the reviews advised and everyone agreed it was for the best, as they were still quite sweet.

These were really delicious. Honestly the amount of powdered sugar was too much. Though you can alter that. Instead of folding the cream in I whipped it on a low setting. This made the cream very thick. I added a few table spoons of milk until it was the desired texture. The milk made it smooth and creamy, it was also not nearly as sweet!!

I enjoyed this a lot but it wasn't amazing.  I did as the reviews suggested and reduced the sugar in the filling to 3/4 cup.  Next time I would reduce the amount of lemon in the filling, because I was a little disappointed with how the lemon covered up the cream cheese.  The crepes themselves were a little plain, next time I would add a bit of sugar and vanilla into the batter.  Overall it was pretty good recipe.

These were decadent! However I am glad I read the reviews about the sugar! I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and honestly I might try 1/2 cup next time. Also two tablespoons of batter really wasn't enough to make a full crepe. I just poured enough in there to roll around and make a thin layer covering the bottom of the pan. Great recipe... we will make again! And I really didn't find it difficult to make. I made the filling and sliced strawberries first and put in fridge. Then I made the crepes and filled them. It didn't take long to cook the crepes. I'm not sure why some people claimed they took a long time...they cook through in like a minute.

I have not made the entire recipe as of yet. I just use the basic crepe recipe in this and it is wonderful and very easy. I do add  2 TBS of raw sugar when I am making them for my home made pumpkin seed butter and jam.  But when I use this crepe recipe for meats and veggies I do not put sugar in it. 
Very good and you can see my version on my page. I do use organic dinkel flour instead of basic wheat flour.

Super easy and super good. To cut down on fat and sugar I very lightly dusted the crepe with powder sugar. Then I put a thin strip of spreadable cream cheese on the crepe in the center where the berries go and filled it with the strawberries leaving off the whipped cream topping. It was just right for me as I don't like anything too sweet in the morning.I put 1/2 tsp vanilla in the batter since I left off the topping. Yummy!

Super yummy! My whole family loved them!
I skipped the whipped cream and added vanilla to the cream cheese. I also ended up making two batches of batter, otherwise I would have had so much filling left over. I used more than two tablespoons of batter, which made a slightly thicker crepe and probably why I had to make two batches!

I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup but I still found it way too sweet. So, I doubled the lemon juice and added 3/4 cup sour cream to the mixture.  It was richer and not as sweet tasting that way.  I told my family that they were strawberry cheesecake crepes.
