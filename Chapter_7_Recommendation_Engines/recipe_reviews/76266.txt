This was the best pumpkin cake that I have made or tasted. I made it for a Bible study group at our home, and nobody in the group believed that it was made with Splenda. I will definitely keep this recipe, and use it whenever I want to make a pumpkin cake.

This was easy to put together and the family liked it.  I don't care for the splenda aftertaste but others didn't notice it.  Be sure to smooth out the top before baking as what you see is what you get.

The frosting was perfect. For the cake I took out the brown sugar and added nutmeg to make it more like a spice cake. It went well with the maple in the frosting.

Excellent recipe for the fall. I added extra spices (ginger and nutmeg). I use Splenda Brown Sugar in place of real brown sugar to cut the calories further. I have made this in a bundt pan and a mini muffin pan, adjusting the time accordingly. It always comes out moist and delicious. I enjoy it very much!

The only changes I made to this recipe was the addition of walnuts and golden raisins and instead of "real" brown sugar, I used Brown Sugar Twin. It is fabulous! It baked really well with no intervention from me at all! Although I do agree with the reviewer that said, even out the top, because wysiwyg! Of course that is fine, too, mine was not that bad, actually! The texture is great, the flavor is awesome...I am so pleased and will be using this for Christmas give aways! It was so simple to make! The cream cheese frosting, I admit I was a bit leary of. I used the recipe for Splenda powerdered sugar (I cannot have processed sugar at all , so am always looking for ways to use splenda instead)
and it turned out just fine !I am just thrilled with these recipes, and they will be made again and again!

I have made this cake, twice. I made this as bundt cakes (just layering the frosting on the top) for Halloween and Thanksgiving parties at my work and it was a huge success. Excellent cake with a nice consistency and the frosting is an great topper.

This one is a KEEPER!!!  
My family (which includes 5 kids) just loved this recipe and could't believe that it was almost sugar free (only sugar was from 1/2 cup powdered sugar in frosting).  I will definately be making this one again.

This is the first time I've made something with splenda. I know splenda tends to seem sweeter than regular sugar so I thought it odd that it required the same amount of splenda as a substitute for regular sugar. I think maybe this recipe calls for too much splenda. It probably should be halfed, because there is a strong aftertaste with this cake when you put in 1 cup.

OUTSTANDING!
Made the "trial" one for Christmas and it was a hit.  Had a request to make another the next day.  Excellent.

This is a really excellent cake.  My husband is diabetic and I try to convert any recipes to sugar free, so I tweaked this one too.  I used 1 tablespoon of molasses rather than brown sugar and then increased the Splenda in the recipe to encompass the total amount of Splenda/brown sugar.  We both love it.

The frosting on this cake is absolutely wonderful!   I used in on a carrot cake for my diabetic husband and it is really good.  I will definitely be using it again on other cakes including pumpkin.

Very moist and delicious.  I made the cake and left off the frosting and served slices at a friend's luncheon.  Got great reviews.  Will make this one again and again.

This was a very moist and flavorful cake, nice spice flavor just as is. I made the cream cheese frosting and thought it was very good, I used the neufatchel cheese which is like cream cheese and used rum flavor inplace of the maple flavor. My Husband thought it was great.

Offered this as an alternative cake during an office party. People really liked it! Exchanged the brown sugar for Splenda Brown Sugar instead, as well as 4 regular eggs for the egg substitute. Made the creamcheese frosting with sf pudding too. Great basic recipe though.. could easily stand alone with the frosting. :-)

Very light and moist cake.  Was a big hit for Thanksgiving.  Buut I really did not care for the frosting.  Next time I might use a different frosting or none at all.
