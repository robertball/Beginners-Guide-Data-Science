I like the flavor of the recipe but made a few changes.  I mixed the sauce with 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 Lemon juice, and the 1 teaspoon Curry power and then brought to a boil.  I thickened the sauce with some corn starch and served it on the side.  The next time I wouldn't bother with the dreading and I would just pan sear the chicken breast with a little lemon pepper seasoning and olive oil.  Served it with Long grain brown rice and it was tasty.

Pretty tasty. I used panko crumbs on the chicken because I like the crunch. After I made the sauce, I sauted up some onions, snow peas and water chestnuts and added them to the sauce. I served this over shirataki noodles. The lemon was a bit strong for me so i added a dash of teriyaki sauce and some red pepper flakes for heat.

My family really liked this.  It was really easy, which is a big plus for me.  The chicken was sweet and flavorful, and the curry was not too strong to be overpowering.  I used regular sugar, because we didn't have Splenda, but I will buy some for the future times we have this for dinner.  Thanks!

These are really good! The first time I made them as chicken strips and the second time I did full chicken breasts. That worked just as well! This goes really well with brown rice.

This is VERY lemony.  The chicken and sauce were good but the sauce did not glaze the chicken, it's too thin.  Using Splenda left an awful fake aftertaste.  My family didn't seem to notice too much.  
I would make this again but I would use sugar and maybe even add 1/2 a  teaspoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce so that it coats the chicken better.

This was yummy! I used brown sugar instead of sweetener though. Nice and flavourful and creamy.

my husband and I loved it, the kids were not so sure, but I modified some. I did not have enough lemon juice, so I used half citrus pop. The kids usually like anything with the sauce separate and they don't like to dip, so I think they'll grow to love it in time. The neighbor's kids loved it. So 5 stars from us for a yummi treat.

My family really liked this! I left out the curry powder and used real sugar instead of splenda.

Quite tasty.  Can be served as an appetizer or a main course.  I served it as an appetizer with two  different dipping sauces; (Honey, Stone Ground mustard)

While titled "Lemon Chicken Strips" all I could taste was the curry powder, though still very delicious.

I am giving this a 2 star. Here's why. My hubby and one daughter loved this. Myself and 2 other of my children...didn't at all like it. I can't say I'd make this again for my whole family. But if hubby asks...I'll make it for him. I used 3 large chicken breasts and the amount of bread crumbs nor egg was enough to coat all my chicken pieces. So I added more. Which was almost 2 cups of bread crumbs and used 4 eggs. Then 15 minutes wasn't enough time to cook thoroughly for the amount of chicken chunks I had, cooked about 25-30 minutes. And then I get to the sauce. That's where I totally had issues. For me it was too lemony-sweet and barely the taste of curry. Even though I could smell it...my whole house smelled wonderful. Wished my senses agreed with my taste buds. I think if I had to try and do it again. Only to attempt. I'd reduce the sugar and--or increase the curry some. And I love love curry. And the sauce was liquidy flat, not at all like I thought it would be, I thought it would be more of a glaze when cooked. ;-( I regret and apologize, it wasn't for me.

YUMMY!!!!  Wasn't sure if the curry powder would overpower the lemon juice, but it was perfect!!!!  The only change I made was not cutting the tenders into bite sized pieces.  Very moist !!!

easy to do and had a unique flavor. I'm planning to reduce the sugar/sugar substitute to 1/4 cup. I served with rice and black beans.

Yummy!! Used half sweetener, half sugar. I'd definitely do it with all sweetener if I could. Loved it though. I'll definitely make it again.

We made this last night and it was very good.  The kids even liked it.  We used sugar instead of SPLENDA and put it over brown rice.  I will make it again. It has a big lemon taste so just a little drizzle of the sauce on each piece is more than enough to get a nice flavor. The sauce is the consistency of water which is fine because it bakes in and gives the whole chicken piece flavor.

I really didn't like the lemon sauce so i figured that is pretty much what the recipe was. I did give 2 stars though cause the breading for the chicken was good. I did, however, have to add more eggs and bread crumbs to coat the chicken.

This is ok, but it's not great. I won't make it again. It's flavors just didn't really go well together.  Kinda spicy, kinda sweet, but really funky. And I usually like funky things, just not this.  It would have been much better to just have boring chicken fingers (aka, leave off the sauce)

My husband loved this so much he requested it for dinner the next night too! The sauce is very good and easy to make although it did need to be thickened. The chicken strips were delicious with or without the sauce. A new favorite in our house!

Tasted great over rice!  Next time I will make more of the lemon sauce.
