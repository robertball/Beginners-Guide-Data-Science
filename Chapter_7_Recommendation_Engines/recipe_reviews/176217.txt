I love this recipe, I took it from a chili recipe my dad made when I was a child and added my own touch to it. Very easy to do. Make it in the morning and have it that night for dinner.

Best chili I've EVER made!!! Only change = I use 2 pounds of either ground deer or ground moose and minus the bell pepper. RAVES every time I make this meal!!! Little bit of shredded cheddar or sour cream or chives or onions on top...whatever your fancy!! IT'S TOTALLY "DA BOMB"!!

I altered this recipe to suit what I had on hand and it turned out great!! I used 1 10 oz can Rotel, a 12 oz can of diced tomatoes and an 8oz can of tomato sauce. I also replaced the canned beans with dried pinto & kidney beans that I cooked. Instead of using the slow cooker I made mine on the stove and simmered it for about 2 hours. The end result was out of this world!!

We're out in Texas so we used ground deer and also threw in some deer sausage. One note: The seasonings tasted better when we added them toward the end - we added ours about 1 hour before chili was done.

Wonderful with ground buffalo. But it makes too much with too litte meat. I use 1 lb of ground buffalo or ground turkey and ONE can of all the beans and half the bell pepper and onion

Excellent chili and very easy to make! I used ground Alaskan Moose and stuck to the recipe. Topped with shredded cheddar and a little sour cream. I'm a novice cook and this was a success for me. Exceptional chili... thank you for this recipe!!

This was quite good. The only thing I would change is SALT it needs SALT. But otherwise an amazing dish! Cannot go wrong with Moose.

I love this recipe so easy. I made it with 2 lbs. of ground moose. I substituted black beans for pinto and I left out the olives. I also added 1 Tblsp of chili powder. Delish!

GREAT MOOSE CHILI - but I had to make just a few adjustments.  I don't like to use processed seasons, so I added my own - Cumin, Cayenne Pepper, and Chili powder were my main ones.  I also used only kidney beans except for the chili beans which were black beans.  I used Rotel instead of the can of tomatoes.  and I added a can of tomato sauce.  I was amazed the olives were so good in the chili!  Best chili ever!  I also made gluten free cornbread to go with it!
