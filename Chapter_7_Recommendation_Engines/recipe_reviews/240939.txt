Followed the recipe (except I scaled it down for 4) as written for the exception of mushrooms. Made this for company and had to leave them out because of an allergy to them. This was enjoyed by all.

Beautiful recipe, just what I was looking for with the tomato base.  Fit perfectly in my 6 quart dutch oven  using near exact measurements and I took some extra time to brown the beef in batches.  I simmered on low for more than 2 hours with heavy lid and  I added the carrots and potatoes at the same  time rather than separately as suggested, it probably took another hour and then at end added the mushrooms.  This was so good!

I didn't use mushrooms but red and yellow peppers instead.  It was delicious......a keeper.

This is a great one-pot recipe! The only addition I made was to deglaze the pot with 1/2 cup red wine after browning the beef.

I would definitely say it's a repeat recipe, but add more paprika and less Worcestershire sauce.  The sauce was a bit much.  I'd say add half or 2/3 the sauce, and perhaps another 25% paprika.  Add more carrots as well.  Other than that, quite delicious.  The recipe doesn't say whether to stew uncovered or not, but I tried uncovered and it started to develop a skin on top.  I suggest partly covered to allow it to thicken without a skin.

The family loved this recipe.  The tomato base was a nice change from traditional beef stew.  The only change I made was to substitute red wine for water.

Made as directed but my tomatoes were "chili ready" with a touch of chili powder taste. This only enriched the flavor and made it more robust. Excellent recipe! Thanks~!

The only change I made was to the number of servings and it was  delicious.  The family loved it on a chilly day!!
