Easy and refreshing. The recipe as written will make about 1 gallon. I had to cut the recipe in half since my ice cream freezer is a 2 quart. I will definately keep this recipe handy. It really is very good. Thanks!

I halved the recipe and tweaked the fresh orange juice to sweetened condensed milk ratio. I also reduced the orange soda amount to 2/3rds of the halved amount. Ended up using: 3/4 cup fresh squeezed blood orange juice, 1/3rd of a 2 liter bottle of orange soda, half a can of crushed pineapple and 2/3rds a can of sweetened condensed milk. Turned out splendidly! Sweet, fruity and not overly sugary. Seriously good. The blood orange juice made it a pleasing raspberry color.

The recipe is great. I blended the pineapple in the blender before adding it to the other ingredients. This achieved a smoother end result since I don't care for the larger chunks.

This was super easy and tasty. Only change I made was I only used 3 cans of soda. I'm not sure what type of ice cream maker the original recipe writer has, but I'm pretty sure more than three cans and you'd have overflow... But, other than that, it's a terrific refreshing dessert.

I didn't like it, but my husband did. It turned out very dry and almost flaky. I also thought the sweetened condensed milk gave it a strange taste mixed with the orange flavor. I may try it again but I'm not sure what to adjust.
