This drink is awesome...takes you right to the islands!  I agree with other viewers to use equal parts of spiced rum and coconut rum.  I made enough for 2 so I used 2 jiggers of each and a 6 oz can of pineapple juice, 1/2 cup of oj and only 1 t. of grenadine.  Absolutely delicious!

Ok, this drink is ALL wrong.  Where do I begin? First of all, NEVER used flavored or spice rum in Tiki drinks.  Use an aged rum and a white rum.  NEVER EVER USE MALIBU! Second, there is never orange or pineapple juice in a Mai Tai.  There is Orange Curacao, an orange flavored liquer, but never juice of an orange.  Pineapple? Nope, never.  The real recipe is aged dark rum, white rum, juice of a REAL lime, orange curacao, orgeat, simple syrum.  Finally, garnish with a lime and fresh mint.  This recipe is all wrong.  SMH.

This was delicious and easy to try being 1 serving. I had everything on hand except spiced rum, so I used Myers dark rum. It was worth making another.

Great drink! I made exactly as recipe stated. The two rums are what make this drink. I made for our memorial weekend BBQ - big hit! Not a poor man's drink though - to buy all the ingredients gets pretty costly - but worth it for something different!

Great drink!  Mai Tai's are one of our favorite drinks.  I have made many many versions and this one is a great version.  I do think it is a MUST to add amaretto in this as well to get the almond flavor that Mai Tai's have.  Also half of a freshly squeezed lime is great in it as well!  I like to add the lime and amaretto in it to make a more authentic tasting Mai Tai, but this recipe is for sure still great as written.  Thanks for the recipe!  This will be added to the list of favorites.

AWESOME!  We did, however, increase the coconut rum to 1 full jigger.  We will definitely be making this again.

A Mai Tai does not have coconut in it at all.  It may be a good drink but should be called a Mai Tai.

This may be a tasty cocktail, but it is most definitely not a Mai Tai.  One of the required ingredients for the cocktail is orgeat syrup, it also does not use spiced or coconut rum.   These flavors are nothing like a well-made Mai Tai.

Added splash of dark rum on top (very fruity if you don't) and my parents who LOVE mai tai's said this was the best they have ever had!

I don't care that this is not an "authentic" Mai Tai - it is a pretty darn good drink - whatever it really is! I love the hint of spiciness from the spiced rum. I do want to try it again, this time adding the Amaretto & fresh lime as suggested by others. I do think that there's definitely enough coconut rum & would not add more. We were camping on the beach in the central California coast & as written, this refreshing cocktail fit right in!

Tastes just like all the mai tai's I've had on vacations!  And very easy to make.  Agree with everyone else to add equal amounts of the rums...  Very tasty!  Thanks for sharing.

Simple recipe, but didn't care for the taste which was very disappointing since I made a whole pitcher!  Don't know if it was the coconut rum, but something gave it a funky taste ~ and everything was just purchased to make these.  I will continue my quest for a good one!

I would never add almeretto , not do I add much grenadine(too sweet and sugary).  I do add Orgeat syrup which is the only way to make a real Mai Tai.  This is not readily available most times so I get why people add other stuff.  But if you ever can make it with the syrup you will taste a world of difference.

I set out to buy Trader Vic's Mai Tai mixer, but my local market didn't have it.  I didn't have the flavored, but I did have both Bacardi Gold and Bacardi Superior.  I mixed the two.  I'm very happy with this recipe and will never need a mixer again.

Good recipe!!! 4 stars until I added my own touches. I added Amaretto for that almond flavor, equaled the spiced and coconut rum as some reviewers suggested and a hint of simple syrup. Was a hit at the family Luau. Went faster than the frozen pina colada daiquiris. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I used 1 to 1 ratio for the Malibu and the Captain Morgan. Plus I added 3/4 ounce of lime juice. It was fantastic.

It’s an OK drink. It is nothing at all like a mai tai should be.

I like to mix the  juice, spiced rum, and coconut rum in a pitcher.  Then I add Grenadine after it is poured in a glass over ice.  A splash of Dark rum on the top is a nice little addition as well.

Perhaps not as authentic as some might enjoy, but tasty, simple, and scaleable for varying desires.  I have made this a few times now over the last couple weeks, the girls loved it.  Poured over ice and into travel mugs or into the fridge in a glass jar its nice for emergency applications.  I am using regular white rum instead of coconut, mostly because that is what I keep on hand here.

I’m not a huge drinker or alcohol, but I do enjoy fruity tropical type drinks. I love pineapple juice and orange juice. I bought captain morgans coconut rum and had spiced rum from the country of Grenada. I wasn’t impressed with it. All I tasted was the alcohol and minimal juice flavor.

Wife loved it. Try adding 1 drop of pure almond extract. Adds a nice nutty earthiness to it. But only one drop.

A big hit at our luau.  Used regular Bacardi Rum and Malibu.  Left out the grenadine.  We had tried out the authentic recipe (with Jamaican rum, orgeat, etc) but it was not our thing (syrupy alcohol flavor).  Dangerously delicious!

Tasty!  I  made a kiddie cocktail substituting ginger ale for the alcohol.  The kids loved those too!

I will use equal parts of spiced rum and coconut rum next time like others have suggested for a slightly stronger coconut flavor.
