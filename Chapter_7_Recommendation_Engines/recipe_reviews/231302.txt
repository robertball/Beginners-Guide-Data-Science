I made this with a few changes...I marinaded the catfish in the lime juice about 15 minutes. I baked it in 350* for 25 minutes.  I followed everything else.  GOOOOOD! fast and easy.

Oh MY GOSH!! I just finished it!  It was incredible!  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil.  I did it on the stove top.  I made homemade guacamole, made some black beans and warm corn tortillas.  WOW!!The butter sauce is delicious.  
This is fast and simple to make and my family and dinner guest loved it!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

This was great! I bought some catfish with the intention of making another dish on this website bit just didn't feel like making it anymore. I had to cook the catfish so it wouldn't go bad and was trying to find something easy and flavorful. We used everything BUT lime because we didn't have it on hand. It still came out really great! This also makes great leftovers. We used the juice of two lemons and had it with home made mashed potatoes as a side. Next time I will eat it on a fresh bed of salad greens for lunch. Will make this again.

Thanks Cyndi! I was looking for a way to oven bake 1 portion (1/2 pound) of a Turbot Filet; a mild white fish. This was perfect & went GREAT w/ the Zesty Quinoa from this site (though I used cous cous not quinoa); both had cilantro & lime & were a fresh/healthy meal after all the Christmas over-eating:)  I scaled the portions to one & then per another reviewer suggestion I mixed the sauce (replacing butter w/ olive oil) & marinated the fish for 15 minutes. Then wrapped it in a foil packet (leaving room for air to cirulate a bit) & baked for 12 minutes, checking it & did another few minutes until it was to my liking. Thanks!

I made this dish last night. It was easy, quick and came out great! I drizzled some of the cilanto butter left over in the pan on the fish as well. 2 out of 3 of my kids liked it :) (haha)

I was excited to try this & maybe (probably) “previously frozen” catfish tanked this recipe.  But I live near Seattle & “fresh catfish” is not readily available, quite like it is elsewhere in the US.  I might try this again with a local mild meaty fish local to the PNW!

High praise for the low-fat (non-fried) cooking option, I used a whole lemon & lime - and the herbed butter that came with the catfish.

I complimented this with wild rice & a beet salad made with figs, garlic, mayo & walnuts (also on all recipes).

Fantastic!  I have made this recipe 4 times.  Every time it was fabulous!  Lemon and lime are absolutely necessary.  Cilantro, optional.  ????

This recipe taught me why catfish is to be served breaded and fried. I like cilantro and I like catfish and I like lime. I did not like this recipe. Maybe with a different fish, I don't know.

I will use less butter next time. I feel like it poached in butter the first 10 minutes and I think I can reduce calories and keep flavor.  The cilantro wasn't really noticeable at all.  My fish fell apart, but that's my deal, probably. All in all, I will do this again.

I loved this recipe! My husband is not a fan of catfish and he totally LOVED this recipe! He said if I cooked it like this more often, he would not complain about eating catfish. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was perfect.

We really enjoyed this. We don't eat a lot of catfish but some friends gave us some. So I decided to try this recipe.  Followed directions completely.  Only complaint was  I want more sauce!!!

Baked as suggested. Used swai fish. Used lemon pepper and paprika with lime since I didn't have lime juice. Would marinate next time. Very good!

I baked it in the oven per another rating and it cooked evenly and the sauce was great, but it didn't seem to go well with the catfish.
