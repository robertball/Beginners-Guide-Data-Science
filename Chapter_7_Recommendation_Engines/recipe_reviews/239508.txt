My husband made this for me. We had a lot of green tomatoes from our garden to use but I just had surgery and wasn't up to canning. I found this recipe, which looked perfect for our needs. He made it using a lot more tomatoes (mix of yellow and red but mostly still green) and a lot less sour cream, but otherwise about the same for a triple recipe. This is spicy and creamy at its best! Love it and will make more. We froze most of it for use later, but need to use more tomatoes before they spoil. My favorite salsa!

Very tasty!!!  The only changes I made was to add more garlic & jalape√±os (I like spicy) and some onion.  I will certainly make this again.  Ate it as a dip with tortilla chips. Looking forward to trying it on tacos.  Thank you, Jamison7117, for posting this recipe!

The best salsa we've ever eaten!!! We first had it at Los Cabos in Columbus, TX and now make it all the time.
