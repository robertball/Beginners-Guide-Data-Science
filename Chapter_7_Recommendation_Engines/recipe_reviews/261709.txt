I had already purchased the salmon when I found this recipe. I had preserved lemons in my fridge (easy and more intense than those in the store- use Meyer's lemons). I substituted rice vinegar for the champagne vinegar. It was easy and though I doubted I wanted to put a vinaigrette on the salmon it seemed to "clean" the taste and texture. The sauce was easy and added a nice counterbalance. I kept the preserved lemon measurements the same even though i prepared two pounds of sockeye. Dinner guest worthy.
