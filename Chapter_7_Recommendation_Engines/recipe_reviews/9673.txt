I read the reviews before I made them and read about them coming out flat so I used unsalted butter and 1/2 the amount called for and they came out perfect!

Great Cookie.  It's sweet and a bit tangy.  I put some lemon zest insead of extract since I didn't have the extract.  I think this cookie might be great with dried cranberries; might make for a very festive Xmas cookie with them.

I'm going to have to agree with another review about how they look.  They taste great but mine didn't look anything like the picture.

The best lemon cookie I have found so far. The lemon flavor is strong and what I'm looking for.

Awesome! My husband said "that's how a cookie should be-flavorful and sweet and salty and crunchy and chewy".  This is my second time making them.  The first I used butter because I didnt have the no trans fat shorting.  This time I followed the recipe except I left out the raisons and added an extra cup of oatmeal.  So good (my husband doesn't like raisins, but I liked them that way too)

Not my favorite cookie. Omited the raisins. Added zest but still missing something, can't quite figure it out.

Very tasty, light, flavorful combination of tart/sweet.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, as another reviewer suggested, and I loved it.  Thanks!

These are excellent!  Great lemon flavor, with a little crunch to them.

I am going to give these cookies five stars for TASTE, but the presentation was not what I was looking for. The dough was very wet, and they spread out very thinly yet had a cakey texture. They tasted delicious, but I would have been embarrased to serve them or bring them to anything. I did really enjoy the taste though, so I could see us making them again. Thanks!

I might have baked them a little too long, cause I had trouble getting them off the cookie sheet. But I have a brand-new stove and am still learning its quirks. Yet they taste great, and so what if they're a little crispy. I used golden raisins to keep the "blonde" look. I just might try another batch after Christmas for a second taste test! :-)

Cut the shortening by half unless you like flat, crisp cookies.  I added and extra cup of rolled oats and an extra cup of flour, and used 3/4 c butter.  Add lemon zest if you want a stronger flavour.  I'd also substitute dried apricots for the raisins.

I used about 1/4 cup lemon juice only and baked this in 2 batches. I thought it wasn't quite sweet enough so I made a little lemonly glaze out of powdered sugar, lemon juice  & water and drizzled it over the cooled cookies just for an extra lemon touch. I brought these to work and my co-workers enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I gave this 5 stars, but it needs more body; so I added an extra 1/4 cup of oats and 1/4 cup of Craisins in addition to the ingredients as listed in the original recipe.

We love these cookies!!  I even add a half teaspoon more of the lemon extract to bring out the lemon flavor of the cookie.  A very interesting and delightful combination and change from the "norm."

How disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor was good but the end result, not so good.  I had very flat cookies, so I added another cup of oatmeal, still flat, so I added another (now at 3 cups) and they still didn't have shape, mind you I have only cooked them for about 8 min.  Very disappointing.  Taste...good, presentation...terrible.

Amazing! I rarely follow recipes as written. I usually just look recipes up for a base line & tweak them. For my version: I nixed the oats, added 1/2 cup more flour & a pinch more baking soda. I also bumped the lemon up to 1/3 cup juice & 2 1/2 tsp extract. In one batch I added 1 cup cranberries, in the other batch I added chopped macadamia & white chocolate chips.

I increased the flour to 2 cups, decreased lemon extract to 1 tsp, added the rind of 1 lemon and omitted the oatmeal.  This makes delicious, crisp lemon cookies that look nothing like the photo shown.  You'll love them!

These were so good! I used butter insead of shortening, omited the raisins, and added a little lemon zest. I think next time I make them I'll try adding some cranberries. My only criticism is that they kept falling apart. They're also not the prettiest cookie ever, but I think they make up for it in taste!

Easy and delicious! They turned out great and I reduced the sugar by half and used whole wheat flour to make them healthier.
