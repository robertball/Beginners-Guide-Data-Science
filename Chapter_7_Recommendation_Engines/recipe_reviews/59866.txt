A pretty darned accurate and authentic style of traditional Italian cooking! (See, we DO eat more than pasta and pizza, although this IS good with pasta, or roasted potatoes too!) Use olive oil and, if you can, fresh rosemary. And be sure not to overcook your chops or they'll be tough and dry. Growing up we always prepared chicken this way too--particularly good with a cut up fryer rather than boneless chicken breasts as you want to cook this long enough to infuse all these wonderful flavors into the meat. Simple yet delicious.

I made these for the first time a year and a half ago.  It is a great recipe.  I do cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and actually increase the wine to almost a full cup.  This allows a nice amount of sauce.  For those who experience "tough" chops, the key to this recipe is thickness.  The thicker the chop (get as close to 1-inch as you can) the better.  Breakfast-cut or traditional pork chops will not work.  They are too thin and will dry during the browning stage.  Use the thicker center cuts and they will turn out great!  Like other reviewers, I slice fresh yellow onion and mushroom and add them in the last few minutes of simmering.  If you're looking for a new spin on comfort foods, this is the recipe for you to try!  Goes perfectly with mashed potatoes and green beans sauteed in soy sauce and minced garlic.

Very good recipe for pork chops.  I used olive oil instead of butter to brown the chops, since I didn't have any wine on hand I used apple  juice (the light apple flavor was great with the pork), and I just cooked and turned them until they were done.  Came out great!  Delicious and pretty tender.  Great mix of flavors.

AWESOME!!!  But, 20 minutes is not long enough to cook.  I also do this with a  pork loin and cook in the crock pot, and everyone who tries it LOVES it!  And it smells ssoooo good while it cooks.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe!!!

the recipe works great, but try using fresh rosemary and it gets much better.  also, with chops, do a 1 hour brine with salt and brown sugar to keep the meat moist and add flavor-it works great.

WOW!  This is a fantastic recipe.  Very easy and VERY delicious!  I always use a fresh rosemary (you'll want to use about 3 tsp.)

This was very good.  I made this twice.  The second time I added some finely chopped onion and portabella mushroom when I added the sauce and it was even better.

I used fresh rosemary and I was afraid of it being too strong but next time I will know to add more! My hubby is a big fan of lots of flavor so once I realized this is a recipe with subtle flavors, I added garlic salt and greek seasoning to the chops while they were browning. This recipe is great, the wine and rosemary really give the pork chops a nice flavor and if you get thick chops and simmer them 15 to 20 minutes, they are really tender too! I added chopped onions and portabello mushrooms and turned the sauce into a gravy by adding cornstarch after everything was cooked. Next time, I will double the sauce because it was so yummy!! We enjoyed this very much, thanks.

Even though I haven't tried this yet, I will.  My husband is a pork chop lover.  I just can't see why people rate things that they have changed everything in the recipe.  If you're gonna rate it, make it like the recipe says.

This was a good base recipe, but I'm a "taster", and as a result, I modified it, after making it the original way...  I found the original way good, but lacking something... So I added 3 tbsp of herbes de provence, 1 tbsp of thyme, and 1/2 tsp of seasoned salt.  With these additions, I think it took it to five stars, and my family loved it!  I found that by browning the chops, then cooking it covered, on very low heat, I was able to let it cook for at least 1/2 hour and still remain tender and juicy.  With my modifications, I would definintely make this again, but without... maybe, maybe not.  My next time making it, I'm thinking about adding a little balsamic vinegar to it.

This was DELISH!! I altered the recipe slightly though. I used pork tenderloin cut into 1 inch medallions. After I browned the meat, I removed it from the pan, and then sauteed one shallot and some sliced mushrooms in the leftover butter and meat juices for a few minutes. I then added the salt and pepper, some thyme (as I'm not a big fan of rosemary), and the minced garlic. Then I added the wine...I'm not sure how much, but way more than one cup. I then put the meat back in the pan to simmer for a while.  After I had thought it had pretty much cooked through, I removed the meat again to a warming plate in the oven.  I then mixed some flour with some butter and added this to the sauce to thicken it. It was a little too thick, so I then added some chicken broth to thin it a little and then added the meat back in again. It may sound like a lot of extra steps, but it was still an easy meal to make and very tasty.  I will be making this again for sure!

Delicious!  My only modifications were to up the quantities of wine to one cup and add 1/2 tsp. black pepper, 1 teaspoon rosemary, and 5 cloves garlic.  This is a keeper!

I thought this was sort of bland, but my husband liked it.  I don't know if I would make it again.  Only if he asks for it.  I hate giving less than glowing reports as I know how hard people work on their recipes to make them just right.  This one just wasn't for me.  Thanks anyway.

This is basically the same as my usual pork chop recipe.  However, I use marjoram and basil instead of rosemary.  Fresh herbs are much better than dry.  Also, I use a meat tenderizer to pound the herbs and fresh black pepper into the chops before browning them.  This seems to make a big difference.  If you are a garlic fan, use more...I always do.  I wait and pour the wine in before simmering, using the wine to deglaze the pan...yum!  Use enough to cover the bottom of your pan.  I also usually thicken the sauce so we can have it with pasta or potatoes.  It's heavenly.

This recipe is basic and has lots of merit, however I tend not to mix my animal fats when cooking so I substituted coconut oil (which I am using more and more of these days) for the butter and by using fresh rosemary I increased the amount to 1/2 cup. Not to detract from the given recipe, I questioned my decisions and to be on the better side of caution I eliminated the garlic and shaved a fennel bulb. My daughter followed the original recipe as presented here and gave it a fie star rating, I can only give mine a four star and next time I will eliminate the rosemary, if using fenne,l and substitute tarragon. Good recipe, and if I may offer a tip, in Kitchen culture a chef/cook accepts the initial recipe as a guide only and may choose to modify or change ingredients, this does not detract from the body or the dish, so experiment!

Restaurant-quality dish and superior recipe prepared exactly as written. My comments: 1. Dried rosemary *does* work.(Fresh is always best, but my market was out.) 2. Using super-thick chops, I found that during the extra few minutes of simmering, as the liquid cooks down, small amounts of wine can be added without degrading the superb taste of the gravy. I served the pork with wild rice pilaf and, for color, a simplified ratatouille (red & yellow bell peppers, onion, tomato and minced garlic sauteed with grated Parmesan. Thank you, Stephanie!

Excellent!  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil to cut a little saturated fat out.  I also doubled the rosemary.  I steamed some asparagus for about 5 mins as a side dish, then sauteed it in the left over pan sauce for a minute for extra flavor.

The flavor of the sauce is wonderful, but I bought some chops that were on the thin side so they turned out a little dry.  I'll definately try again though with some thicker chops. Thanks!

Living alone I halved the recipe except for the garlic.  Only cut the wine by about 25%.  Added a can of mushrooms for the last 5 minutes of simmer.  Served with buttered carrots seasoned with thyme and a glass of the wine used in the recipe.  My nicely marbled boneless loin chops were moist and tender.  The sauce is likely the nicest things you can do to a can of mushrooms!  Looking forward to eating the other chop tomorrow night.  Thanks, Stephanie.

Very simple recipe with a nice flavor. I scaled the recipe to 4 and did not add as much salt. Also added more wine as it evaporated as was suggested. Cooked for 17 minutes, not 20 as well. I did as was suggested and steamed broccoli and added them to the pan to soak up the jucies. Very yummy. Nice spring salad to go along. We will definitely be making this dish again. Thank you very much!

Very tasty, and easy to make. I used 3/4 inch pork loin chops and they turned out very moist and tender. Like other reviewers, I also doubled the wine (used white cooking wine), and slightly increased the rosemary and pepper, and I also turned the chops every so often to make sure they soaked in as much flavor as possible. When the chops were done, I thickened the sauce with cornstarch to make a fabulous gravy. This is a new favorite in our house for sure - thanks for sharing!

My husband said these were the best pork chops he ever had.  Browned 2 chops in half amount of butter and half amount of olive oil.  Used the amount stated for everything else.  Even added a little extra wine and butter towards the end.  Thanks for delicious recipe.

I made this exactly as stated and it turned out really good!!  My entire family liked it a lot.  I served the pork chops with candied sweet potatoes which made them even better.

I was looking for a different way to prepare pork chops and had saved this recipe a while ago.  I did not have all of the ingredients but decided to make them anyway & improvise where I had to.  Instead of butter I browned the chops in olive oil - I am Italian and not only is it healthier, I prefer the flavor over butter.  I did not have any fresh/dried rosemary or fresh garlic so I substituted Italian seasoning and garlic powder.  The chops still turned out AMAZING and I will definitely be making them again with the fresh ingredients!!  I covered the pan, cooked the chops for about 20 minutes and thought they did not look done so I cooked them for 10 more minutes.  Unfortunately, I overcooked them a bit so next time I will stick with 20 minutes.  Because of the lid, the sauce did not thicken very much, so after removing the chops, I cranked up the heat to boil the sauce for a few minutes and it thickened up quite nicely!!  This is a simple recipe that yields delicious results - thanks for sharing!!

I very much enjoyed this recipe, but found it to be kind of salty (even with using only 1/4 to 1/2 of a tsp).  I doubled the wine and rosemary, and also added in a little onion powder.  Thickened it up with a little cornstarch at the end.  Thanks for a simple and tasty dish!

This recipe is quick, simple and really good! I prefer using extra virgin olive oil. I added a little bit of chicken stock to the sauce. As some reviewer pointed out, do not overcook your chops. I actually brined my pork chops before browning them. I also believe using fresh rosemary is the key. Thanks for sharing. This is a keeper!

Just made this tonight and it was amazing. Will definitely be making again. I used butter (smart balance) and since I didn't have any white wine i followed another person's suggestion of using apple juice. So juicy and flavorful! We had it on a bed of white rice and it was an excellent combination.

This was so easy and my 12 year old son said it was his favorite thing I've ever cooked him.  I added sliced fresh mushrooms to the skillet right after adding the wine and seasonings, and added another half cup of wine (because of the mushrooms).

This was very similar to the Thai Pork from this site.  I used white rice as a side dish (added a bit of sugar to make it a little sweet) and it tasted great.  Also added some mushrooms and some green onions as well. Thanks for the great recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe, adding a few things for my own personal taste, but following the cooking directions to a T and I'm glad I did. I haven't made pork chops before and have had more than a few dry ones and my day. If you follow this recipe, that won't happen. They are moist and tender with great flavor from the wine sauce. I'm a student, so the quality of ingredients I can afford aren't great, but I can't imagine how good this would be with high quality ingredients. This will be a staple during the hectic school year. It couldn't be more quick and easy!

excellent!!!! will make again! I cut my recipe in half because i was only making 2 chops and I didn't have any sauce left when i was done... would add more white wine next time. Also I browned the pork chops on medium high heat with the butter first then turned it down to medium almost to medium low and added the other ingredients and simmered for 20 minutes turning occasionally. Soooo Gooood!! thanks for the recipe!!!

3.5 Stars: I used medallions of pork tenderloin and fresh rosemary, but we did not get a lot of flavor from the sauce.  I added fresh lemon and it helped a lot.  I served it over pasta.

My husband and I thought this was delicious.  I used a little olive oil instead of butter.  I did not have any wine, so I used about 1/2 cup chicken broth with a little red wine vinegar.   Also, I left out the salt as it was not needed since I used the chicken broth.

Was looking for a new recipe for pork chops and this really fit the bill for simplicity and taste!  My husband even gave me a BIG "Mmmmm" when he took his first bite...which made me happy as he is a "Beef" man and only tolerates pork for me.  I followed the recipe except I used a cup of the wine and in the last few minutes, I threw in a handful of sliced onion...for me, EVERYTHING is better with some onion!    I will for sure be making this again!

AWESOME!  I would give it 6 stars if they let me.  Suggestions:  THICK cut pork chops with bone in.  Also, I used olive oil instead of butter and extra garlic.  I served it with spinach that I sauteed in the same pan once the pork was done.

I'm giving it 5 stars even though I only had red wine and thin chops. It was still really good and will try with white wine next time. I did brine them with salt for an hour like another suggested and made sure I didn't overcook. Ate with rice and peas. Quick and simple!

Delicious! and easy! I felt like I was eating a meal from a gourmet restaurant! I used fresh chopped Rosemary and a Chardonnay white wine. I made steamed grean beans with shallots as the side. Perfect "Adkins" meal.

This sounds gorgeous. I wonder if you could use cider instead if wine, or would that detract from the fact that this is meant to be Italian.

Great tasting and so easy! My kids loved it. I changed it a bit b/c we're not big salt eaters. I cut the salt to about 1/4tsp and that was more than enough, plus I doubled the rosemary and next time may add more garlic. I decided to toss in some asparagus, mushrooms and steamed carrots to the delicious pan drippings. Will absolutely make this again!

The recipe is spot on.  I used 2 very thick boneless chops and followed recipe for the sauce.  (didn't measure salt and pepper.) They were done and oh so tender after 20 minutes.  Discovered, however, that we are not big fans of rosemary so probably won't make again.  They were good tho....and if you love rosemary, you will love the chops!

Very simple to cook but surprisingly elegant and tasty. I used one-inch-thick boneless pork chops, and 20 minutes was exactly right. The chops were just done, tender and not dry, and the sauce was delicious. I will definitely make this again.

This was so good, I used half a cup of wine for two chops plus 2 cups of sliced mushrooms half and onion and 5 cloves of garlic that I sauted prior to searing the chops.

I was a little skeptical that so few ing could make such a wonderful sauce, but they sure did!  I'm a big fan of EVOO, but not for this sauce.  I think the "nutty" flavor of the browned butter is what gives this sauce its rich flavor.  They only changes I made were to season the chops (salt, pepper, garlic powder) & add a little 1/2 & 1/2 at the end (just enough to turn it a light carmel color).  My chops were a little dry, but my chops are always dry :)  DH said make sure you don't lose this recipe...can't wait to try it on chicken!

My boyfriend and I loved this. It's a keeper.  First I dusted my chops with flour, then used half olive oil and half butter to brown. I used half thyme and half rosemary. And I was a little more generous with my garlic.  And used lemon pepper instead of regular pepper. They came out great with a side of broccoli and mashed potatoes.   They came out great!

Don't change a thing! This recipe comes out delicious every time. Make sure to make a little extra sauce and saute the broccoli as the description suggests. It truly is the best veggie to pair with the pork chops. Add a side of wild rice and you've got a delicious dinner.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I didn't make any changes to this recipe -I'm a firm believer that usually the fewer the ingredients and more simple the recipe, the tastier the recipe.  I also allowed the many high reviews to impact my decision to make this recipe. I figured that if so many people gave it a high rating, I would also be able to give it a high rating (thinking
"that many people can't be wrong").  First of all, it seems that instead of the pork chops receiving flavour, that the sauce is infused with flavour... but you're still left with pork chops that have been bathed in butter, so the only flavour that remains is in the sauce, which while tasty doesn't impart any flavour into the pork.  The only way I will try this recipe again is if I can find some way to marinate the pork w/ the sauce.  I really wish I could have given it a 5 star rating -but unfortunately am not able to.

I tried this recipe last night. I didn't have any pork chops so used chicken breast and apple juice instead of wine..didn't have that either:) I took a package of cooked rice from the freezer where I always have some cooked on hand, mixed that with the juices in the pan and had a wonderful meal. Would love trying it with some mushrooms and onions next.

Excellent!  I cook the pork chops completely through BEFORE adding the wine.  Reduce heat to very low & there's always juice left.  Margarine works fine in place of butter.  The broccolli is a must!

The whole family loved this.  When I noticed the sauce was starting to get cooked down, I covered the pork chops until they were cooked through so we had plenty of sauce left.  Delicious!

Quick and easy and flavor was VERY good. Spices did not penetrate the (1-inch) thick chop(even though it was juicy), so I would prefer a thinner chop for this recipe. I expected a "sauce" so I was disappointed (even though it was flavorful)that I only had about a tablespoon of melted- butter-looking-liquid, with little bits of rosemary and garlic, left by the time the inch- thick chops got to done temperature. 
Maybe,if we covered(recipe said"cook UNCOVERED"), to finish cooking after browning, it would have been better ?  OR,using the thinner chops, there would be a little more "sauce" left.  The whole family liked the rosemary, garlic,wine,butter and black pepper flavor with the pork, so,I will definitely try this one again.

Good recipe for pork chops, simmering them in white wine really brings out the flavor.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and we enjoyed it very much.  I like that its a nice and easy weeknight recipe that doesn't take too long to cook.  I will be making this again!

Delightful, aromatic and simple to prepare.  I use Moscato, an Australian wine, such as Jacobs Creek brand, readily available in our small town grocery store.  A definite keeper for our family.

Wow!!! This was So So So good!!! I didn't use rosemary because the family really doesn't care for it. But I did use Tarragon in it's place....wonderful!!! Next time I will double or even triple up on the sauce. The Sauce is really the key ingredient in this recipe. My hats off to you Stephanie. Job well done.

These were just okay. I didn't have white white, so I used white grape juice. I also added mushrooms and onions for the last 5 mins of simmering. The flavor was okay but the chops were tough. Next time I'm going to buy thicker cuts of pork.

I double the wine, tripled the garlic, added a tsp of minced onion, and 1/4 tsp of ground ginger.  Seared on med high heat and used only 3 pork chops and this recipe turned out perfect!  I loved the sauce and served with mashed potatoes.  Tasted ah-mazing.  Definitely becoming a staple in my house

The directions were simple--perhaps more details were needed. First it said to cook the chops, no time given for each side. I interpreted that to mean brown on each side, as they were then going to simmer for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes my 1" chops weren't done. After about 10 minutes they were no longer pink, but they were so tough. Thinly sliced, with sauce poured over them, they were edible,but disappointing. I give it three stars just because the sauce was so tasty, but I wouldn't make these again.

Loved this recipe!  Based on other reviews I increased the wine to 3/4 cups to have a bit more sauce.  I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Definately put some of the sauce over the potatoes!  My husband rated these a 9.5 out of 10!  We both loved them!

This was a great recipe. On the advice of other reviewers I upped the wine to a full cup and reduced the salt to a 1/2 tsp. Only thing I'd do differently next time is substitute fresh rosemary for the dried. Awesome recipe and easy to follow for a new cook like myself. Even my picky toddler liked it!

Hubby accidentally took out pork tenderloin, so I cut them into medalions. !  A little Dijon mustard as a condiment at the side just added to the flavour.  I plated the medallions, and poured the sauce over spaghetti.  These were dee-lish - family just raved over them.  I can imagine doing up porkchops properly would taste equally wonderful!

My chops were thinner about 1 inch and i overcooked them.  Either i didnt have it high enough when browning them or cooked too long in the simmer.  But the flavor was delish and  will make again only reducing cooking time.

This is a great recipe!!  So flavorful, and so easy...the only thing we added was a little more garlic, and fresh rosemary.  Will make this again for sure.  An added plus was that it very low carb which is great for a diabetic.

Loved this! It was very easy to make, and my husband and I thought it was delicious. I was worried the chops would be dry as some reviewers said, so I made sure to use a thicker cut chop. Also, I don't like rosemary so I used dried oregano instead. Otherwise, I made the recipe as-is and we can't wait to have it again!

Oh my gosh, these were SO delicious!!  I ended up covering them at 19 minutes, turning the heat off and letting sit until we were ready - about 5 more minutes.  My picky kids weren't as thrilled, but the Mr. and I were absolutely smitten with these chops.  Will be adding these to our regular menu.

VERY GOOD!!  I made two chops, using EVOO to brown them, rather than butter.  I made the full amount of sauce because I was concerned that halving the sauce wouldn’t give me enough liquid to simmer in.  I used fresh rosemary.  I used a very low simmer for about 10 minutes and my chops were fully cooked and moist.  I did whisk in 1 T. butter at the end to richen up the sauce.  This is a thin sauce and I think next time I’ll add a little corn starch and water to thicken it up just a bit.  Very nice flavor and one that we’ll do again!   Thank you.  UPDATE 12/5/13 - Made this again as before, although I did thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch this time.  Very good!

Would give this 3-1/2 stars.  It was tasty but just needed something more.  I seasoned the chops with salt and pepper before browning them  instead of adding S&P to the sauce.  I think I would reduce the butter to 2-3 tbsp. since the sauce was a bit rich.  But I did love how the garlic caramelized in the cast iron pan.

I cannot believe that something so simple tastes so great! I really don't like pork chops. But this sure changes my mind. I did like the others and used Olive Oil instead of butter. I used a Chardonnay wine. To me it's fruitiness seems to really work well with the Rosemary. I doubled the wine,1 1/2 the Rosemary and garlic and added cornstarch to make the gravy thicker. Gravy the other food group.

These were wonderful.  I did make a couple of changes based on some other reviews... browned chops in half butter, half olive oil.  Substituted wine with a mix of apple juice and chicken broth, and used fresh rosemary.  In any case, they were great and the broccoli was divine!

Thanks for a great recipe!  My husband and I love it.  I used a pork loin and cut it into 1" chops.  I didn't have any wine so I used beef broth. The meat turned out so tender that you could cut it with a fork!  This is definitely a keeper recipe!

It was super easy to make but a bit too "rosemary-ish" for me.  Being that rosemary was the most prominent ingredient... it needed something to cut the strength.  Unless you LOVE rosemary and prefer it to be dominant, I think this needed something else.

Definitely the best pork chops I've ever cooked. I didn't even think I would like the rosemary but I really did. Sauteing veggies in the leftover sauce is a must! They were as good if not better than the chops!

So good, and smelled wonderful cooking.  If anything I would cut down the cooking time...but even so they had a great flavor and were so simple, with a rice pilaf and leftover green beans.  Great for a weeknight meal.  Thanks!

I am updating my comment on this recipe since I have been using it a while now. I usually make this with chicken instead of pork chops, and since this recipe is so simple, I just pour and sprinkle instead of following the recipe. I use apple juice instead of wine. It always turns out great and my family of 9 really enjoys it. This is a wonderful, basic, simple recipe that you just can't mess up.

I changed one thing in this recipe...used apple juice instead of wine because my family doesn't like the flavor of cooked wine.  That one small change, but this recipe was perfect!!!  Moist, juicy, delicious pork chops.

I kept the chops covered during the simmering, and am I glad I did! The sauce that was left was awesome! I served it with Oven Brown Rice (from this site) and drizzled the sauce over both the chops and the rice. I didn't have any fresh garlic, so I had to substitute garlic powder. Still delish!

An excellent pork recipe. The combination of wine, butter, and rosemary are delicious with this. I would however advise either cooking it covered, or using approximately double the amount of wine if cooking it uncovered, because the sauce had almost all disappeared by the time it was ready to be served by cooking it uncovered. This recipe is a definite keeper though.

I always think pork should marinated a long time to add to the flavor. This recipe seemed to quick to have that degree of flavor, Boy! was I wrong, these chops had a wonderful flavor, were tender and with a side of steamed carrots, it was a hit! Just seemed to easy to be this good, it's perfect for a last minute dinner when you want to impress someone.

Very easy and very delicious!  Great way to prepare pork chops.  It smelled wonderful while it was cooking, and it tasted just as good.  I added some mushrooms for a little more interest, but kept the recipe the same other than that.

My husband and I both love this recipe.  It has a wonderful taste and aroma, and I like the fact that it is a simple recipe with only a few ingredients that I already had at home.  Plus, we are trying to eat less carbs, and this recipe is a great low carb recipe.

Just made this, and my boyfriend and I are now enjoying it. Great flavor!!!! I'm usually more southern Italian (since that's where my family is from), but I have to admit I'm now a fan of our northern brethren too :D will make this again for sure!!!

Wonderful  and easy.  I've made these a few times now.  If I'm using thinner chops, I shortened the time a bit at the initial browning, but they still turned out great.  Thanks!

Quick, easy family pleaser! The only changes I made were to brown the chops in a mixture of half olive oil, half butter, I added more garlic and used fresh rosemary.  My picky eaters really liked this, and that says a lot in this house.  One of my sons rarely eats meat and ate an entire pork chop.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I try not to rate recipes 5 stars if they're not spectacular AS IS. Keep in mind as you consider trying this recipe that lots of people on here -- pretty much everyone -- rated it 5 stars and then went on to tell you how they changed it in some fairly big ways.  I was one of those people who changed it because I knew as an experienced cook that it wasn't gonna be great the way it was written.  I increased the wine to 1 cup and added sautéed mushrooms and onions & garlic plus I used fresh rosemary and lots more of it. I used half butter and half olive oil. I browned my chops until light brown on each side before adding the wine, deglazing the pan and letting the chops simmer for exactly 20 minutes.  The chops were about 3/4 to 1 inch thick. After 20 minutes (plus browning time) they were tough. Maybe it was the cut (although it was a center loin America's top choice cut) -- I don't know. I had to play with the sauce adding butter and pepper and a pinch of brown sugar when I thickened the sauce with a mixture of corn starch and cold water.  This was decent but not fantastic so I'm giving it three stars. Maybe next time I will brine the chops first if I try it again. I will admit that the bar is pretty high for me when it comes to loving a recipe so take that for what it's worth.

Man, this recipe was outstanding!  Barely changed anything.  I seasoned the chops to my preference (Tony's Chachere's, Everglades Seasoning and onion powder) because I always "flavor up" my meat before cooking, then simply sliced up an onion and added baby bella mushrooms.  Great, simple, quick but flavorful pork chops.

I found these pork chops a bit bland. They definitely needed more seasoning. Next time I will season with salt before browning, maybe garlic salt even. They did look pretty and if the flavor had been stronger it would have been a 4-5 star recipe.

This is one of the best recipes I have tried in awhile.  I made them early and let the chops sit in the sauce. When I went to warm it up again, I thickened the sauce a bit using corn starch.

this turned out great. I only used 3 chops but kept the sauce the same so there was plenty. I used a chardonnay for the wine, and used herbs de provence instead of rosemary. I also added a little tarragon, and then some sliced onions in the final five minutes or so. Next time I'll try adding mushrooms as well, and consider chicken instead of pork.

Very good.  Used half the listed butter and the other half EVOO, also doubled the garlic.  Sauteed the chops 3 mins each side.  20 mins was too much time to simmer because they turned out dry, next time I'll simmer for about 10-15 mins.  The sauce was really tasty but had to add more wine.

This was a hit with my fiance!  I made it exactly as directed.  The only thing I wish I would have done differently was to poke holes in the pork chops with a fork while they were simmering in the sauce, so they would've soaked it up a little more.  I thought they were kind of dry, but I am still giving it 5 stars because when dipped in the sauce, they were fantastic.  We thought the sauce had a very strong white wine flavor, but that was fine because we liked it.  :)

I followed the directions except skipped the salt, and my guests just thought it was okay. I usually make a breaded, baked pork chop, and they much prefer that recipe. It smelled good, but that as about it.

Great recipe. Waaaaayyyy too much salt. Definitely cut it in half at least. Didn't have fresh garlic on hand so I used a teaspoon of garlic salt. I also did two tablespoons of butter and two tablespoons of olive oil instead of just butter. Thanks!

Delicious!!!  I used Moscato because I had it and fresh rosemary from the garden.  Next time I may add 1/4 cup more wine because I want more sauce.  Will definitely make again and again.

The most wonderful flavor! I changed nothing intentionally. Used white Moscato, as that was the only white wine I had. I used fresh rosemary from the garden and olive oil instead of butter (because of high cholesterol). Another reviewer made a brine of salt and brown sugar, which I used because the chops weren't very thick.(Soak in brine for about 1/2 hr., then patted chops dry with paper towels before browning) The result was amazing! They were flavorful and moist. I cut the cooking time back by 7 min., as I didn't want the chops to dry out. My new favorite recipe for pork chops. One of my pet peeves is that people change the main recipe then give it a lower rating. I am sure the original was awesome, and kudos to the contributor!

This was wonderful!  I did make some changes.  I didn't have any wine so used 3/4 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar.  Used 3 cloves garlic, 1/2 onion and mushrooms.

This is a fantastic recipe! I love the flavor. I usually end up adding a little more white wine half way through so that there's more sauce left at the end. Otherwise, I don't change a thing.

DELICIOUS! After looking at many of the other chop recipes I decided on this one and am so glad I did! My family raved, and my daughter literally licked her plate! I used EVOO instead of butter, decreased the rosemary by half and added dried basil aprox 1/2 tsp. ,sea salt and peper to taste. The chops were moist, juicy, and tender. The sauce was heavenly. The chops I used were an inch plus center cut. Make sure the oil is good and hot when browning to help sear in juices, I also spooned the sauce over them while they were simmering. The sauce is sauce not gravy so don't expect it to be thick. Drizzled it over mashed potatoes and steamed grn beans. Can't wait to make for company!

Good chops but not what we are looking for.  Hubs and I enjoyed but not kids.  But I loved thickening up sauce with flour.  That shelled a lot!  Giving a three because kids weren't receptive.  Thank you, though!

Today I was my husband's culinary hero! I had apple cider at home so I used that instead of the wine and used seasoned salt instead of regular salt and pepper. When the pork was done, I removed them and thickened the sauce with a little corn starch. Served with roasted potatoes and steamed veggies. I highly recommend!

Increased the wine to 1 cup, but otherwise followed the recipe completely and it resulted in wonderful flavor. Added small amount of flour to the sauce to thicken it up... So good.

This was GREAT! Such a simple, elegant dish and sooo easy! Even without marinating it....the pork comes out super moist...because of the amount of time it simmers.  The sauce it makes is FANTASTIC...I followed some of the suggestions and reduced the amount of salt.  I would also up the wine next time to a cup instead of the 1/2 cup. This is my husband's new favorite way to have pork...will absolutely use again...thank you!

I am rating this 4 stars due to the good flavor that resulted.  I actually used pork-chops thicker than 1 inch, thus I needed a longer cooking time which resulted in the chops being overcooked and dry.  Next time I will definitely use chops 1 inch thick or smaller.  Also, I may start the process on stovetop and finish in the oven (sealed) to keep moisture in.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly (adding additional seasonings to taste) and it was good.

We didn't care for this at all and I'm not even sure why, because we like all the ingredients individually. I guess it was just the way everything tasted all together. Go figure. Thanx anyway.

Very easy and very tasty pork chops. I would suggest increasing the wine. The extra sauce is quite nice. Add a little rice pilaf and some ginger glazed carrots, you have a real nice meal.

Too much butter!! It was so heavy. I subbed apple juice for the wine and it was delicious. I had very lean chops that cooked up fast so I didn't simmer the sauce for the full 20 minutes, and instead added flour to thicken it up for a gravy that I poured on the chops. That gravy saved them because otherwise they would've been so dry! I might try this again but with chicken.

I cooked it almost exactly to the recipe, but missed the part about simmering...  when I realized this, I reduced the temperature.  Since I believed there should be some sorta juice left in the pan, I decided to add a little heavy whipping cream, which did just what I had expected.  
You may want to try adding mushrooms to the recipe as well.
Excellent recipe.   Great flavors.  Extremely easy, except when you've decided to drink some of the wine and watch a movie at the same time as you cook the dish...  ;).  Thank you for this simple, yet yummy dish!

YUMMO!! Following the recipe almost exactly; swapped olive oil for butter. Only giving it 4 stars because I thought it was a tad too salty, but I was the only one in the family who did. Thanks for the recipe! I'll make it often.

I prepared this recipe 2 days ago for dinner. It looked so simple I had little faith in it, but I was surprised with the results. It is a simple, easy to make recipe, but the result is great. It is a very tasty way to prepare pork chops. I followed the recipe as it is, the only change I made was adding a little flour to the sauce to thicken it a little bit. Thanks for sharing. My family definitively thank you. The three of us enjoyed our meal!

This was very tasty recipe.  and very simple to make.  I used thinner chops as I do not like the really thick ones.  I will try with chicken the next time.

UPDATE TO ORIGINAL RATING:  I used center cut bone-in chops and this was MUCH better the second time around.  Also used butter instead of olive oil.  ORIGINAL RATING:  This has real potential just as written...My mistake might have been in using boneless pork LOIN chops.  I almost always find this to be a tough cut of meat and these were no exception.  Next time I'll use bone-in chops instead.  The sauce was really good.  I think this would also be good with chicken.  NOTE:  I subbed 2T of olive oil for 2T of the butter.

Absolutely delicious! I accidently overcooked it so it wan't as tender as it could have been, but that was my fault not the recipe's fault. I had to use vermouth and cooking sherry as out of wine. Also some chicken broth when it cooked down too far. Great with the "Orzo with bsdil and parmesan" here on this site. They were fabulous together.

I love it. It's so easy to make. I didn't have white wine so I used cooking sherry + vegetable broth, and less salt (because cooking sherry is already salty). I also added dried onion flakes and extra rosemary. This definitely goes into my quick and tasty recipe box.

Like others suggested, I added more wine, mushrooms and onions. Threw in some carrot slices to simmer as well. Since carrots don't cook as fast as onions and mushrooms they added a nice crunch to the finished dish. The extra sauce was great with mashed potatoes! Overall a good weekday meal.

Terrific flavor and super easy!!  I didn't use the butter to brown the sides of the pork chops, but used spray canola oil in the pan and worked just great!  I will be putting this in the 'keeper pile'!!!!

I love this recipe! I've make it frequently for my family, and we all enjoy it. The only change I made to it after the first time I cooked it was to cut down DRASTICALLY on the salt. I usually add about 1/4 teaspoon instead of the 1 teaspoon noted in the recipe.

My grandfather's from Modena, and this is how we cooked a lot of our white meats, including pork.  However, I do normally use olive oil, not butter.  Just for fun, I tried this recipe instead.  The butter does add a little more flavor, so I've started using a mix of both oils.

I made this on a whim, because I had fresh rosemary and this is what I decided to make with it.  I was very happy with them.  They smelled AMAZING while cooking.  If I can figure out how to get all the flavor to infuse through the pork chop - they are 5 stars!

Wow, so good!  I love quick and easy recipes and this is so tasty too.  I had only three chops but increased the wine to one cup and it was plenty of sauce to pour over rice also.  I omitted the salt because pork is salty enough.  Used fresh rosemary and next time will add mushrooms as others have suggested.  The sauce is so good!  Thanks for sharing.

I would dredge these in flour so the sauce is thicker in the end.  Otherwise, wonderful!

This was so quick and easy to make and out-of-this world delicious! The only change I made was using pork tenderloins rather than chops. I used my trusty cast-iron skillet and after browning and adding all the sauce ingredients, simply finished it off in the oven, along with some sliced seasoned potatoes I'd started just before. Might roast some peppers next time too - possibilities are endless. Thanks for a marvelous recipe!

This recipe is amazing.   I love pork chops, and, was looking for a different way to prepare them, and this is divine.  I am not a person that cooking comes easy to them, but, I love good food, and, this was so easy, and, looked and tasted like someone else, who had a great deal of experience cooking, spent a lot of time preparing them.  Thank u so much for making me look good.   The only change I made was taking the pork chops out of the skillet immediately after browning them, and cooked the garlic, a little onion, and a half of a red pepper, and then put the pork chops back in to simmer for about 30 minutes.  I did not want to overcook the pork chops.   They were perfect, not dry at all, and,so easy.

Fantastic recipe. Just make sure to use thick chops, as other reviewers have said, and your meat will be tender. Easy to make and fabulous flavour!

Absolutely love this recipe. My daughter loved it as well, waiting on the hubby to get home from work, but I'm almost sure he'll think it's A-list material. I used one of the many Wines we received for X-Mas, we're not Wine drinkers in my house, but we always seem to get it as gifts and we end up regifting them. I'm happy that I found a way of being able to use the Wine as I always feel bad giving gifts away.

good change from the sweeter chops I usually make.
I did add a bit more chicken broth (sub for wine) to make more sauce in the end.
It was great!  Served over brown rice.

I've made something like this for a couple of years now and its really delicious!  I dust the chops in flour before browning in butter and then remove them and add garlic and hot chicken stock (that has a few sprigs of rosemary steeped in it) to the pan and cook it until its thickened.  Instead of pouring the sauce over the chops I mixed into some cooked chopped spinach...it was really delicious and I'll be making this again!

Very easy, simple recipe. I used boneless pork chops and 1/2 butter,1/2 olive oil to saute them. Otherwise didn't change a thing. My family loved them.

Very, very good. I used fresh rosemary & added some chopped onion. I served this with Green Beans with Bread Crumbs from this site. I'll try it with broccoli next time. This dish had a great flavor. Thanks Stephanie!

I laughed when my husband said it's like eating at a restaurant.  I unfortunately overcook the chops @ 20 minutes cooking after browning, but they were great anyways.  I added a little olive oil to the pan, so the butter wouldn't burn.  I doubled the sauce and after I took the chops out, I added broccoli and whole wheat pasta. Next time I will try fresh rosemary for more flavor.

Delicious! Sometimes I double the sauce just so I can have extra to pour over mashed potatoes. It is such a different way to serve pork chops. It's now a regular at our house, (even our young children love it)!

The whole family loved them! I used half the butter and a little olive oil. I also used chicken broth instead of wine because that is what I had. They were really good served over rice to soak up the sauce.

This gets a five for both simplicity and flavor.  We happen to love rosemary, but this recipe would adapt well if you used dill, thyme or any herb of your choice.  Thank you for a lovely way to prepare pork chops.

What a great, simple way to do pork chops! I used a Pinot Grigio and fresh rosemary and it was just amazing. I had to add more wine about halfway through because the sauce had reduced down to nothing, but other than that, no problems. I'll be making this again!

Very, very delicious recipe.  Strong rosemary and garlic flavors, along with the butter and wine.  Used a dry riesling and it turned out just fine.  Served with some veggies roasted in olive oil and the leftover porkchop sauce was delicious spooned over them.  Highly recommended.

This was very good and simple!  We made Nana's Mashed Turnip (also on allrecipes) and put some of the pan juices on them.  Very good.

This was very easy to make--next time I would definetely cut down on the salt (or use unsalted butter) and cut down on the butter. Otherwise a tasty dish that I will prepare again. Thanks!

Butter lovers only..... But we enjoyed this recipe for pork chops very much, especially since we are used to the traditional fried pork chop. A diffrent approach. :)

Sautéed chops in butter and oil. Increased garlic a bit. All else is the same as written being very careful not to dry out the pork. Served with roasted butternut squash.. Very good! Will make again

Easy and delicious and quick!  My pork chops were just a tad under 1" so I took them out of the frying pan early so they didn't overcook while I reduced the sauce.   They were moist and perfectly cooked.  To make the sauce a light gravy, I added a tablespoon of flour and cooked for a few minutes.   Excellent!!!

Absolutely fantastic! I've made this exactly as written. The second time, I used ghee instead of butter and low sodium chicken broth instead of white wine. Both were equally delicious. It's a favorite around here now.

Great recipe!  I used boneless pork sirloin chops and chicken broth instead of wine and used a combo of butter and olive oil and fresh rosemary.  We bother enjoyed it and I'll make it again.  Thanks.

Absolutely amazing! I doubled the white wine and used thick bone-in pork chops. I thickened the delicious gravy using Chia seeds that I blended in the blender first. Wow! I baked broccoli, lightly seasoned with a couple tabs of butter and fresh grated parmesan cheese and spooned the gravy over that before serving. I also peeled and cut up apples and cooked on low with water,a little butter and cinnamon. It was such a delicious meal. You must try it.

This was so much better than I expected, actually. The pork was tender and the sauce tasted great when poured on top of it. I made it with roasted asparagus and potatoes and we were really happy.

Very good.  Loved the flavor of the wine and rosemary.  Just to let you know you may want to double the ingredients for gravy. If you don't there maybe a fight for it.

I am a beginner cook, but this came out great.  I slightly overcooked it, but the pan sauce was terrific (I had to add water because it simmered away too fast).  I didn't have a dry white wine available, but a Riesling + water worked well (the sauce had a nice sweet tangy flavor).  My picky husband loved it.  I made the full amount of sauce for only 4 chops, and it seemed the right amount (even with the extra 1/2 cup water I added). Will definitely make it again and will try not to overcook it! :)

Love the taste of this recipe as well as the ease of making it. Will definitely make it again as an alternative to my usual baked pork chops recipe.  Added a little more white wine and some dried thyme. Cooked for 30 minutes rather than 20. Yum.

This pork chop was delicious. During dinner my husband could not stop talking about how good they are. The butter caramelizes nicely with the wine (used a sweet wine) and the pork chops are very moist (I even used a thick cut bone-in center cut pork chop).

Excellent! Easy to make, quick and simple.  I put this together in a few minutes after pulling some pork chops out of the freezer and letting them thaw. 

The only thing I did differently was to add about a teaspoon of flour to the sauce after removing the chops and reducing that down to a nice thick sauce.

I bought pork chops on sale today and had no plan for them until I saw this recipe.  It was super simple, exactly what I was in the mood for and I even made the broccoli cooked in the juices.  My only change was thyme in place of rosemary because my husband doesn't like rosemary. Very satisfying & flavorful!

Good recipe, didn't have white wine so I used some red and it turned out very nice, and it turned an interesting color!

This was easy but the chops were a little dry--maybe if I brined them first?  The haricots verts I cooked in the pan drippings were really good though.

This was delicious!  And so easy!  My husband and my mother loved it!  I had some room in the skillet, so I cut up a few potatoes and threw them in to brown in the butter and cook in the sauce.  Yummy!

My family loved this recipe!  I made a few modifications based on others reviews...added an onion with the wine and added basil and marjoram with the rosemary.  I also fried some broccoli in the pan when I removed the pork chops as the poster suggestion!  Will definitely make this again!!!

Very delicious! I used fresh rosemary (didn't have dry), and my chops were not very thick. Next time I will get the ones that are a little thicker, maybe they'll turn out even juicier. thank you for this recipe!

I think this is the best meal I have prepared EVER.  I used half butter/half olive oil.  I also used a cast iron skillet and after browning, placed the skillet right in the oven to finish cooking along with a separate dish of small potatoes, onions and broccoli with a drizzle of olive oil and sea salt.  Baked everything for 1/2 hour.  FANTASTIC.

I needed something with a little extra flavor for some loin chops and this sure did the trick! Like everyone else, I made a few changes to suit my pantry and our needs. Instead of butter and garlic I sauteed shallots in a bit of canola and then cooked the pork chops in that pan. I added shredded fresh rosemary instead of dried and simmered for only 8 minutes and then finished in an oven for extra tenderness while the rest of the dinner was finishing in the oven. The reduced sauce with shallots was wonderful and very flavorful.

Delicious just the way it is.  I used less butter and a little more wine so that it didn't start to burn as the alcohol came off.

This was great!! I did a couple things different since I didn't have all the ingredients. . . First I sauteed a small white onion in some olive oil and added some garlic powder. While the onions were going I rinsed and patted dry my thin cut pork chops then sprinkled them with salt. When the onions were almost done I added the 4tbs of butter. I let them cook for a little longer then placed my 8 thin chops on top. I didn't really brown them, just cooked them on med-hi heat until they were almost fully white then I flipped the chops and added half cup of sauvignon blanc and generously sprinkled Italian seasoning, basil and oregano and some cracked pepper too. I then lowered the heat to low and covered the dish and cooked them for about 25-35 minutes. I served this with some fantastic herbed hand mashed potatoes and fresh green beans. . . I know it says to pair with a red wine but I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of my white. This is actually a pretty light meal and was oh so delicious. . . Thanks so much for sharing!!

The flavor was good, but I was disappointed that the pork chops were still a bit dry and chewy.  I don't know what needs to be done (other than using a slow cooker) to make them tender.

Followed recipe.  Found the sauce to be excellent, but the pork didn't absorb as much flavor as I had hoped.  Did add baby Portobello mushrooms.  Will make again.

Just try this dish over the weekend.  I modified it little. I boiled pot of water. Until the water boiled. Put pork chop into the hot water. Seal the whole pork chop juice. As soon as all sealed. Take out. Following rest the recipe. It was delicious dish.

Against my better judgement, I simmered these uncovered for 20 minutes like the recipe directs.  After 20 minutes, the chops were still pretty pink inside.  I covered and simmered for an additional 5 minutes until done and the end result was very tough and pretty bland.  If I made these again, I'd definintely cover during simmering but considering the lack of flavor I won't try this one again.

This was delicious.  When just cooking for myself, I try to be health-conscious, so I only used 2 T butter.  I loved the sauce and would make a bit more next time...I served it with white rice and poured it over that too.

I tenderized and marinated the chops before preparing this recipe and they still came out quite tough--definitely not tender and delicious as I was expecting.  The sauce definitely needs more seasonings as it was very bland and also needs to be thickened as it was too watery.

Had 2 thick pork chops and kept the sauce the same proportions. Also used fresh rosemary. Chops were tender, but we didn't find them to be very flavorful.

Based on other reviews, I used olive oil instead of butter. I left out the salt and pepper because my family members aren't big fans of either. I also threw in some mushrooms and onions right before adding the white wine. My pork chops were so large, I barely managed to squeeze them into the pan side by side, but 20 minutes was the perfect amount of time to simmer them for. My family loved these! My dad actually insisted I leave the recipe with my mom because I'm moving out next week and he can't wait to have them again. I think my favorite part was the juice created by the wine; I'm sure it would be wonderful thickened up into a gravy to serve over mashed potatoes.

There are some saying that the cooking time is off . Its not off , its just with different thickness and size chops you have to expect different cooking times . Even a stove or the pan that you are cooking the recipe in cam alter the cooking time.

Good, and yes, extremely easy and simple.  I made a gravy out of the sauce and it was surprisingly good.  I added more rosemary--I love it--but otherwise kept as written.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, and my pork chops were quite overdone. It had really good flavor so I will try to make this again, but will cut down my browning time and see if that helps.

We found this just a little bland, but the chops were perfectly cooked.  I think I'll tinker a little more next time.  Needs to be a bit more savory for my taste.

The best kind of recipe: simple, well-edited "real" ingredients perfectly paired for amazing flavor... I wouldn't change a thing except to leave out the salt. I added sliced mushrooms, as some reviewers suggested, which turned out to give the light-bodied sauce something to cling to.

These were some tasty pork chops. I substituted apple juice for the wine and ended up having to add a little extra because it reduced so much, and I left out the rosemary.  I will definitely make these again. Yum!

I was afraid might be bland and wondered about simmering uncovered BUT it worked.  I did use fresh rosemary as suggested and good thick pork chops.  This turned out to be a nice flavorful alternative to grilled pork chops (even here in south too cold for that!).

I made this as written, except that I added an extra clove of garlic. This is one of those recipes where the flavor doesn't penetrate the meat, so you definitely need the sauce/juice served with the meat. It was only okay in taste - nothing spectacular. Be careful not to overcook the chops. I had half inch chops that I only cooked in the white wine for about 5-7 minutes after browning.

Excellent and very easy. I doubled the sauce and it was delicious on top of brown rice. My chops were over 1" thick, so I was worried they wouldn't be cooked through enough, but no worries there. I would like to try the variation with the onion and mushrooms next time. Reminds me very much of a Chicken Marsala for pork. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This is one of our family's favorite dishes. My 3-year old kept saying 'mmmm-good' at dinner tonight. I have found it better if I double the sauce ingredients. Otherwise it tends to get a little dry and we love having all the extra sauce to put on our rice, veggies and chops.

My family loves this.  I also cook a chicken breast in the same batch for a daughter who cannot eat pork, and it comes out great.  I slice the pork chops in half to only 5/8" thickness, and the cooking time of 20 minutes is just right at our 5000 foot altitude.

I'm a newcomer to the whole cooking thing, but this recipe was so easy to make and delicious to boot! My hubby loved it! And thanks for the reviewer advice about adding more wine, rosemary and cooking with mushrooms and onions, those additions made for a fantastic dish!

Delicious! And very easy...definitely use the fresh rosemary. Your chops will brown up more if you cook them in olive oil instead of butter but add a little butter back in for the sauce...

Felt these pork chops were okay... not fabulous. The thick cut pork chops need longer to cook than the recipe states...I added 10 minutes. Felt the rosemary was a little to overpowering. I used fresh ... maybe the problem. Not bad, just didn't deliver the wow! factor I had expected. The husband loved them though. Will try again with some minor adjustments.

This really has a hommy taste, I added the herbes of Provance and the thyme as recommended and used a little bit more of wine to have a nice sauce.

Very good - even the kids liked it! The "sauce" kind of boiled away though. Maybe simmered too high of heat. But still very good flavor.

The Modenese Pork Chop recipe was "okay". I followed as directed but I thought that the flavour was a little bit plain and boring. On the plus side this recipe was easy to make and can be made with ingredients lying around the house. I don't think I'll make this recipe again as I don't eat pork very often and I really was looking for something with a little more "bang".

I love this recipe.  I make it a couple times a month.  I substitute the wine with chick broth.  Lately I've forgotten to add garlic and it's still good.  

After the chops are finished I like to use the pan with all the juices cooked down to fry up some pirogies.

As some of the comments said, I used olive oil to brown the chops. And then cooked them in the white wine sauce. These pork chops came out amazing, in my search for healthy pork chop recipes, I have found nothing that compares to this recipe. Simple and tasty!

The flavor of the sauce was terrific although very thin. I cooked the chops according to the directions and they were pork jerky by the time they were done. If I make this again I will cut the cooking time down and slice the chops into smaller pieces.

As others have suggested, I used both butter and olive oil to brown the pork. I used 8 center cut boneless thin sliced pork chops and reduced the simmering time to 10 minutes (from 20). I put the broccoli in the steamer when I set the meat to simmer and it was done at the same time, perfect for sauteing the broccoli in the sauce. I served it with couscous. Rave reviews from hubby!

Very good but I must have done something wrong because the "sauce" I ended up with was just a greasy mess.  I did cook the brocolli in it but it just made it taste heavy and greasy.  The pork chops were wonderfully flavored!

Excellent. I added some half & half cream at the end to make a creamy sauce and it was delicious. I made this recipe with only 2 pork chops and that made it VERY garlicky. Next time I'll only use 1 clove of garlic if I have 2 chops.

I cut the butter in half, made instant mashed potatoes on the side, and stirred the sauce left in the frying pan (from the pork) into the instant potatoes (I cut the amt. of butter in half for the potatoes, too.) Very, very delicious! This is a recipe we will use over and over again.

Excellent recipe!  I made this, and for the first time my teenage stepson actually ate a whole plate of food that wasn't from McDonalds!  I mixed the leftover sauce in the pan with some noodles that I had boiled and it was wonderful!  Next time, I will try mixing the sauce in with mashed potatoes!

The whole family enjoyed this recipe which I tweaked a bit.  I added a sliced onion and some sliced mushrooms when I added the wine and remaining ingredients.  I did not cook for the full 20 minutes because I do not think my pork chops were thick enough to warrant that amount of time.  For the last five minutes or so, I put the chops on a warmed plate in the oven while I thickened the sauce with a dollop of sour cream.  I served with some steamed cauliflower and a nice spring mix salad.

Me and my husband liked this recipe. I thought there was a little to much butter so next time I am gonna try it with a little less butter. I also used apple juice instead of wine (like another reviewer suggested) because I didn't have any wine at home and it tasted great.

Very good flavor--I did a 1/2 & 1/2 cranapple juice/wine, just to add a touch of sweetness. My pork chops were a little less than 1 inch, and they got a little dry, but that was due to my always over-cooking pork chops! My rosemary bush is covered in about a foot of sleet right now, so I used Italian seasoning instead. I only used 1/2 teaspoon salt. The sauce was a little thin for our preference, so I thickened with a little flour, sour cream, and milk and made a nice gravy to serve over it. Took a hint from reviewer AmyLouise & made homemade applesauce (Holiday Cranberry Applesauce from this site) to serve with it.

A lovely classic! I just made it for the 8th or so time and upgraded from 4 to 5 stars. Make it as written the first time (although a teaspoon of salt is really way too much). Then experiment away... Well-browned pork/chicken/beef + wine + garlic + herb. The sky's the limit. At the 7000+ feet elevation here, 3/4 inch boneless pork chops took about 20 minutes simmering, so I think the cooking time given is a good approximation.

We didn't care for this much.  The pork still came out tough and dry.  The sauce that is made is very flavorful but couldn't make up for the chop itself.

Yum! Finally an easy different way for pork chops! I used 2 thick chops, rubbed with chopped garlic, salt and pepper.  Browned in butter substitute, added 1/2 onion, more garlic, fresh rosemary and used Chenin Blanc for a sweeter flavor - I think a Reisling would be good too. Cooked around 30 min. and added my greens. Very good and not dry at all!

This was so good. Instead of using the ending juice for brocolli I made it into a gravy and used to top baked sweet potatoes. I also used the prior suggestions of apple juice instead of wine. My husband and 5 year old loved it! They requested it again soon.

This recipe was awesome.  My 5 year old ate it, so it must be a winner!  I added a small can of mushrooms and served the dish with brown rice.  Excellent! My husband said it is a keeper!

This was lovely.  Nice and tasty and the pork chops were tender.  At the end of the cooking, I took the pork chops out and added cornflour to the liquid to make it into a thicker sauce which finished it off.  Will definately do this again.

This was delicious, easy, and will definitely make again. I left out the garlic and added only half of the salt. Cooked for 20 minutes, they came out moist with no hint of pink center. Towards the end, I needed to add a few more teaspoons of wine, to ensure there would be enough juices to cook the suggested steamed broccoli in.

This was so good! I used olive oil instead of butter, but other then that, I followed the recipe as is.  Very easy, too.

This was excellent, especially the hint about steaming broccoli then frying (I would rather call it sautee) in the liquid.  Our cooking times were quite a bit less than recommended, but it turned out GREAT!  Thanks.

This was pretty good, kinda different, but still good. It was very hard for me to fry pork chops though, I've always grilled or baked them.

This was quick and easy, and turned out pretty good. I did expect a bit more flavor, but I was still pleased with the results. There was no sauce left in the pan to pour over the pork when finished cooking like the recipe stated.

Very delicious! wonderful flavor!  Just a bit tough though.  Probably just the meat it self.  Even my 2 and 6 year old loved it!  Will make again.

The recipe was quick and easy.  The pork turned out tender and juicy.  The skillet I used was not large enough to hold all of the pork in a single layer so I  ended up adding more white wine to make sure more than the bottom layer was cooking.   I rotated the chops every few minutes until they were done.  I also reduced the amount of salt slightly. This one is a keeper.

My husband liked these a lot.  Unfortunately, I didn't use the best cut of meat for this.  It was very simple to make.  I paired it with the cheddar bay biscuits on this site and followed the suggestion to use the sauce for broccoli.  It was a nice & easy meal.  I did pound my pork chops to better infuse the flavor as one review suggested.  Oh, and I did cut back on the butter.

Very good!  I will cut back on the butter the next time I make it, probably by half.  I'm going to try marinating the chops in the wine mixture and add some capers.

These chops didn't knock my socks off, but they were still pretty good. My family enjoyed them a lot. I used a thin chop and the meat was a bit tough. Next time I will use a thicker chop and experiment with different herbs. Good recipe for pork!

I cringed slicing 4T of butter into the pan, but these chops were soooo worth the splurge!  Very juicy, and the sauce IS divine.  My only concern is that my husband liked them so much he'll want them regularly (treadmill, here I come!!).

Yummy!  I ended up using about 1 cup of wine as I continued adding it as it boiled off.  Found it a bit salty though and I will probably reduce the recipe to a 1/2 tsp next time.  I placed some brocolli in the pan at the same time as the chops were cooking and the brocolli was delicious. I only cooked 2 chops and I didn't reduce the recipe at all and I would do the same when using this recipe in the future.

Good recipe - I like the combination of rosemary with the pork.  My chops turned out really tender and had a nice mild flavor.  I wouldn't expect a sauce when this is done cooking...most of the liquid had evaporated while it simmered.  You could probably make a sauce by adding more wine and some cornstarch paste, but it's not necessary.  A good recipe overall!

WOW what an easy, fast, and tasty dinner. I followed the recipe but used red wine instead of white(thats what i had on hand) most don't use red because it discolors the meat. But, boy was it good.I took others advise and cooked with a lid 1/2 the time so sauce wouldn't dry up. A Keeper!

This was very good for such an easy recipe. I agree about doubling the sauce or covering (I wish I had read the other reviews first!). I served them with couscous & steamed broccoli & poured the sauce over all.

It's best erring on the side of under cooked with this recipe. 20 minutes is a long time to braise the pork chops after browning. I found them chewy and dry. I tried 10 minutes on a second round which was significantly better. Additionally, the recipe calls for pouring the drippings over the pork chops. I found that thickening the drippings with some corn starch makes for a nice gravy. Overall, I feel this recipe works with some touching up.

I've been making these for years now, thought I should really leave a review. Never liked pork chops when I was a child,as my mother just fried them and seasoned with salt and pepper.  They were always dry. This was the first pork chop recipe that made me fall in love with pork chops. Delicious, and I usually have all the ingredients on hand. Have always made it with fresh rosemary from my garden and I love adding portabello mushrooms to the skillet with them. Thank you for many years of enjoyment!

This is a nice recipe for thick chops. The sauce is great. Because the chops are thick, I feel they didn’t season up well on the inside, which I would have liked. But the sauce makes up for that.

Made this tonight with two chops, they were one inch thick. I read the reviews prior, and added more garlic and white wine. I ground up my own rosemary and used perhaps 1 teaspoon between the two chops on both sides. I also used olive oil for the higher smoke point to get a good sear  on the meat prior to adding the wine. 

While the wine and garlic was reducing / simmering, I added some thinly sliced onion strips. The chops came out tasty,  and while the flavors of the ingredients complimented each other well, especially the rosemary, I found the whole dish rather uninspiring. I guess the subtle flavor wasn't really what I was hoping for, yet I can't complain - it's exactly as described on the tin even with my small changes.

I thought this was delicious.  I made it according to the recipe and was pleased with it.  I paired it with the other recipe "Bacon Apples" and it was fantastic.

Great recipe that works great for chicken as well (what I used in this instance). I used a Pinot for the wine. I also seasoned each breast with plenty of garlic powder, salt and pepper and added plenty of fresh rosemary and garlic to the butter and wine (also used more than suggested by the recipe) and needless to say it wasn't lacking in flavor at all. One of the things that worked out great was that I made about double the amount of sauce and used some for a vegetable mix and the other part for the chicken breasts. After the breasts and veggies were done I transferred the juices to a sauce pan and added corn starch to make a delicious gravy that went well with the chicken and the veggies.

In the words of my husband, "These are the best pork chops I've ever had!"  I loved them too and they were super easy.  I used an electric skillet and bone-in chops. I worried about them drying out or burning them while simmering for 20 minutes, but I guess if they're simmering in a half of a stick of butter, it's not a problem!

This was a flavorful pork chop dish. I did modify by substituting apple cranberry cider instead of wine (did not have any) and thickened juice with cornstarch and water. My family said 5 stars and keep this recipe!

The only changes I made was to cook it longer so there was no more pink, PLUS I decided to try my new  Weber Steak n Chop Seasoning instead of the usual salt and pepper to taste,  then when it was all done melted and little bit of shredded mozzarella cheese, put lid on (with heat off) for it to naturally melt on top.

This made for a fantastic meal! However, I added almost an entire onion to the skillet while cooking the chops. They soaked up all that glorious wine and garlic. Without the onions, I'm afraid it would have been a little lackluster.

Make sure that you adjust your cook time depending on how thick your pork chops are. Mine were about 1/2 inch thick and 20 minutes was about 5 minutes too long I think. My pork chops came out pretty dry.  Also, the liquid cooked off pretty quickly, I had to add another 1/4 cup after 10 minutes. I know my heat was not too high, as I had my burner set on 4 (medium is 5), so lower than medium heat. The flavor was pretty good though, so I think I might try this recipe again with some adjustments.

I didn't have enough rosemary so substituted a little sage into the mix.  My son and daughter-in-law were over for dinner, and she doesn't really like pork of any kind., but she really liked this dish--even had her husband ask for the recipe!  Big score on this recipe!  Will definitely make it again!

I've made this several times and my husband loves it.  I've made it according to the recipe and I've also with some subs (olive oil for butter, Italian herb mix for rosemary); it's good both ways.  What I like best is that the timing of the recipe is flexible enough that the chops are still moist if I have to hold dinner for a little while.

This recipe is a keeper for us! The only changes we made was to increase the wine to a cup and use fresh rosemary from my herb garden. Next time we’ll try adding onion and mushrooms and possibly try to make the sauce into something we can eat on potatoes. The sauce SO good but could use some thickening (probably would’ve been just fine had we not increased the amount of wine.)

Great recipe, I've made it a few times with less salt and butter though, but it doesn't work well with 1 inch thick chops, 20 minutes is not enough to cook the inside and you don't want to eat not well cooked pork, maybe covering it would help. Works great with 1/2 inch chops though.

This is one of the most delicious home-cooked meals I've had. I added twice the white wine (some $3 Pinot) called for and let the mushrooms simmer with the pork chops. I added a little less garlic. Steamed some broccoli and asparagus in my rice-cooker and then let it simmer in the juices for just 5 minutes after the porkchops were done. 
The mushrooms and were broccoli were unbelievably delicious and the meat and asparagus were great as well. I am definitely going to be making this again.

Fantastic yet simple recipe!  I was out of white wine so I took a gamble and used marsala wine, everything else was as written.  Delicious!  I would like to try it with the white wine but this was so good I might just always use marsala!

We didn't care for these at all. They came out very dry and the flavour was too mild. Blah. The only thing we liked was the broccoli cooked in the sauce, as per the poster's suggestion.

This is a very good recipe. I made it as the recipe states. The only difference I made was to use still frozen broccoli. I stir fried it in the leftover sauce until it was thawed. The result was tender crunchy.

This is my first time cooking with wine and it was delicious!  I didn't buy one inch pork chops but they still turned out great. For a side I cooked green beans with mushrooms and onions and bread rolls. I will definitely cook this tomorrow!

DELICIOUS and easy! Followed the recipe exactly and it had lots of flavor, which is a requirement in my house. NOTE: If you use cooking wine, which is saltier than table wine, be sure to reduce the amount of salt you add or it will be too salty – even for a salt-aholic like me. I did that the second time I made it.

Kid approved!!I made this today!! My son said that I should go on the website and tell the ones who shared the recipe that they did a really good job. I followed the advice about adding the green beans and cooking them in the sauce after pulling out the pork chops. My son says that "the chicken" is really, really good. He is seven years old and loves it.

I read a lot of reviews before I start cooking, I like flavorful food so I had to change a few cooking technique   because this recipe is a base recipe, everyone has their own favorite flavor you can add more or less however you like. 

Double the wine, recommend dry wine 13% and higher such as Pinot Blanc or Pinot Grigio 
Add 1 onion 
More Rosemary and Thyme  

To make the chops NOT dry and very juicy you have to get thick cut at least 1 inch bone in! Brown the chops in very high heat DO NOT MOVE the meat around on the pan at all (casting iron is the best!!!) each side for 2 mins and around the fat area,  then add all the seasoning including the liquid ingredient, I added beef stock because I wanted to make gravy after the meat is done COVER the lid and cook for another 3 minutes 

Took out the chops place on the plate
I made roux for the gravy (1 flour+ 1 clarified butter)  
DONE! Husband is very picky with food, and he loves this! 

I give this review 4 stars because it was great base recipe only, Thank you so much

Reviewing while cooking. I can only but rate it 5, as it's a classic dish. 

Serving with roasted potatoes italian style - rosemary, garlic, olive oil. Dry potatoes first. Chop small. Arrange on baking tray. Salt, pepper.

Also serving with roast courgette and roasted tomatoes. Slice tomatoes without cutting - basically cut into them length and cross ways. Insert garlic into gaps. Pour over balsamic. Sprinkle with salt. 

For the chops, heating up skillet in oven. When very hot, to the hob. Cook as per this recipe, once chops are browned one side (5 mins over high heat), flip them over. Add in the wine as per recipe, along with rosemary, garlic. Put back into oven for 15 minutes. 

WIll post photo's when done ;)

As written, the recipe is fairly good.  If you are using thick pork chops, I highly recommend flipping them once about half way through the  20 minute simmer.  Also, it's not a bad idea to remove the chops from the pan after the initial sear, reduce the heat, the saute the garlic for 30-60 seconds (don't burn it!) just to take a little of the rawness out. Then deglaze the pan by adding the wine and finally adding back the chops.

As my pork chops were very thick, i cut them into smaller pieces as was able to get a nice sear. I added extra wine, and used it to de glaze the pan....it was scrumptious! Served with baby  red,white and purple potatoes  with sliced zucchini .

very good, the pan sauce it creates is delish. I used pork loin instead of chops because they were on sale. I served it with herbed rice pilaf which soaked up the sauce flavor nicely.

My pork chops came out tasty and succulent.  I put the pork chops in brine mixture (salt, sugar, grated lemon peel) for about an hour.

I used fresh rosemary and added a dash of dried thyme.  I also used Pinot Grigio white wine.

I will definitely make this recipe again.

TASTY!!!!

This is so good!! The only change I made is to add mushrooms when cooking because I had some on hand and now I always make it with mushrooms. I wouldn't change another thing. My husband loves it!!

It was simple, quick and delicious. The chops were juicy and had great flavor. I chose mashed potatoes instead of rice and enjoyed by all.

Was looking for a quick and easy pork chop recipe for dinner tonight and came across this one.  I followed the directions as written. The only thing I did different was after the chops were browned, I took them out of the pan and sautéed some onions. I only had 4 pork chops so I thought  there would be a lot more sauce then there was. I used cooking wine, instead of regular wine, because that's what I had. Maybe that was the reason. To compensate I added a little chicken broth. Next time I make these I will try regular white wine. But I thought this was quite tasty and as I said, I will try this recipe again.

i did make a couple of changes first  i couldn't get any Chardonnay like the other reviews suggested so i ended up using a sauvignon blanc  the other change was i added an extra 1/2 cup of wine to the chops they came out tender and tasting wonderful. I also sauteed some portabello mushrooms on the side to put on top. Definitely using this recipe again.

So much flavour for so little effort. Thick pork chops are a must for moist chops. I did add a smidgeon more wine and threw in a few cremini mushrooms at the end. Great flavour and a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was really good. I will change a few things next time that will make it 5 stars.  Heat pan hotter  then add butter and chops at the same time to get a proper sear. When you add butter too early you run the risk of burning it and lower heat does not sear pork. Also, a bit too much salt, maybe 3/4 tsp instead.

Great recipe thank you! Made first time as written  and scored a 5. Tonight I used fresh rosemary (3 tsp)increased wine to 1 cup and added onions and mushrooms as others recommended. 1" chops required 35 minutes cooked at a simmer! also a 5.

The combination of white wine, garlic and butter makes this dish a winner.  It was easy to make, uses ingredients I already have on hand, and my kids love it.  I will definitely make this again.

Incredible! Very easy dish to make.  The FLAVOR?  Well, I made these two nights ago; my wife is till telling people about it today. I just overheard her telling her mother about it over the phone. I read where a few people opted for olive oil instead of butter. I get it. I do keep plenty of olive oil on tap and many different flavors, I might add. I did consider using olive oil, but we generally eat healthy and like eat bad on occasion. So butter it was and butter was GOOOD!

Made the recipe almost exactly as described. I did this with bone in and boneless pork chops. I browned them to the color I wanted, then added the wine and ingredients, and for simmering reduced it to medium low. The pork   remained nice and tender, and we used fresh rosemary diced. This was our favorite part, bring liberal with the rosemary infused oilesque sauce. I'd recommend as many others making a little more of this than recommended. Well recieved by guests, a good dish.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was superb! The pork was tender and full of flavor. I used a full cup of white cooking wine with lemon flavor. I also seasoned the pork chops ahead of time with the salt, pepper, Rosemary leaves, and a little garlic powder before browning then in olive oil instead of butter. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and it was delicious. Also, the aroma of the pork in the wine sauce was heavenly and really made the kitchen smell nice. I will definitely be making this again.

Wow! Such a wonderful flavor for such little effort! I followed recipe exactly and it was delicious.  My pork was tender and juicy. Again, I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE, which called for thick cuts of meat. I checked with a meat thermometer occasionally until internal temp was 160. So exciting to find a recipe that uses what I have on hand, and has short prep time. Great example of "keep it simple stupid" .

I wasn't sure if I should make this as  my husband is not a big fan of rosemary but as it was just 1/2 teaspoon I went ahead. We both thought it was great. It was a nice, quick, simple way to fix pork chops. I thought that 1 tsp of salt was going to be too much so I only used 1/2 tsp.

I've made this several times now and I love it.  Especially because they freeze so well.  I put the frozen chop in the microwave on Express Defrost for 1.5 minutes, followed by another minute in the microwave on on high heat.  Incredibly moist, flavoroful and tender and beats any boxed frozen entree.

This recipe was just okay, and I'm not sure if I'll be making it again.  I simmered the pork chops for at least 25 minutes, but they were still slightly pink inside.  The only slight variations I made on the recipe were that I used fresh rosemary, I added a little extra wine, and I added mushrooms to the sauce while the pork chops simmered.  I feel the pork chops themselves were rather bland, even after spooning sauce onto them several times during the meal.  However, the mushrooms were delicious!  After simmering in the sauce, the mushrooms seemed to take on all the flavor of the sauce while the pork chops had no real flavor.  If you attempt this recipe, I highly recommend adding mushrooms as they were by far the best part of the meal.

I found 20 minutes was too long. I also found them a bit bland. However, I am going to give them another try just to make sure it was not user error.  Leftovers will make good pork fried rice! ;)

This is truly delicious. I make this with Trader Joe's French Cut pork chops and it is to die for. Wine and garlic are the strongest flavors and I love it.

this was fantastic.  I made it almost as is excpet I did salt/pepper to taste and used fresh rosemary.  I also didn't measure the wine I just poured in the pan to make sure I had it covering the bottom.  We all loved it-kids and all!

I come back to this one again and again.  I increase ingredients for a little more sauce, but you wouldn't really need to, and I agree with other reviewers that a thick porkchop is better.  I will try this with chicken as one Italian reviewer mentioned.  I'm sure is would be outstanding.

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight and it was delicious! I am in the beginning stages of really learning to cook and this was even easy for me to do. I did make a few modifications based on some of the reviews I read. I am trying to eat healthier so I used olive oil instead of butter and I didn't have any white wine so I used a reduced sodium chicken broth instead, and instead of the garlic cloves I used garlic powder. It was so tender and it had so much flavor. I just wished the sauce was a little thicker but I will definitely make this dish again!

Thick cut chops would be preferred, but the thinner cut of chop works fine in this recipe, you just have to keep a closer eye on it.  Brine them first if you have time, then brown them briefly and simmer for only about 10-12 minutes (maybe less depending on your chop).  Then remove the chops from the pan and cover in foil to keep warm.  Then continue simmering the sauce for about another ten minutes to reduce it a bit.

My go-to pork chop recipe! So delicious and so easy to make! (I even just use whatever white wine I have on hand and it always turns out delicious.) Thanks for the recipe!  
(Update: last time I made this I only had a Moscato on hand - waaaaay too sweet for me, I don't recommend that. My partner still loved it though!)

I found that the cooking time was too long, so I would advise using a meat thermometer and check the temperature five or ten minutes after adding the wine and other ingredients. (Pork should be about 145 degrees, I think.) I didn't have wine, so I used 1/4 cup white wine vinegar with 1/4 cup water instead.  Also, I added a couple of three-inch pieces of fresh rosemary instead of ground.  Wonderful recipe!

It was very good...I actually used thin chops and cooked them quickly. Also had the fresh rosemary in my garden and forgot it!  Still the dried was good.  Quick elegant meal....took 12 min.  I will try it again!

One of my favorite recipes from this site.  No-fail and fast enough to make for a weeknight dinner.   I add 3/4 Cup wine and 1/4 Cup water so there is more sauce.  Always use fresh rosemary if possible.
Adding a pkg of sliced fresh mushrooms while simmering is a nice touch.

Was very excited about this recipe, but really was dissapointed.  I made it exactly as written and it was very bland and the porkchops were very tough.  I used the large chops as suggested.  Will not make again.

We thought this was fantastic. Even with dried rosemary, the flavor imparted well. It is important to watch the temp on the meat to get it cooked without being overdone. Thank you for a great recipe we'll use again and again!

Followed the recipe with only one caveat - after removing the chops from the pan, I mixed 1 tsp corn starch with approx. 1/4 cup cold water and stirred it into the sauce to thicken it a little. Sauce stuck to the meat better and made a nice gravy to drizzle over mashed potatoes. Very good. Used Pinot Grigio for the wine and unsalted butter to reduce the sodium.

This was outstanding, so much so that we wanted more when we finished!  I used fresh rosemary instead of dried and added a few button mushrooms during the last 10 min. of simmering because I needed to use them up.  I will definitely be making this again!

Very good! I will use fresh rosemary next time and would love to try this with a loin. Simple, elegant.

Pretty good! A different way (for us) to prepare pork chops. Nice flavor! Of course, I added more garlic and more rosemary (fresh)... And next time I'll use more wine because we needed more sauce.

Despite the fact that I cooked this poorly (the meat was very underdone due to incorrect cooking temperature, my own fault), this turned out great. I think next time I will use olive oil instead of butter. I also served this with onions that I cooked in a mixture that resembled the sauce made from the pork. Not bad, but I really need to attempt this again.

Made this tonight for the family and we all loved it.  Quick, easy and delicious weeknight meal.  I followed the recipe instructions exactly and it turned out great!  Served it with mash potatoes and steamed cabbage - the sauce was wonderful over the potatoes!

This is my husband's FAVORITE recipe I make, to date.  He actually even requests it, and he never requests certain meals!  Even when I had to scramble and sub sparkling white grape juice mixed with a little white wine vinegar (that's what I had on hand) when I forgot we were out of wine once, he still loved it!

Fabulous!!! I defrosted pork chops and was going to bread and bake and realized I didn't have a key ingredient. I jumped on my allrecipes app and found this. It turned out so wonderful I think its our new favorite way to make pork chops!

These were a huge hit with my family!  The pork chops were moist and very flavorful!  I did substitute olive oil for the butter however.  I will also cut back on the salt next time because i don't care much for salt

Delicious, quick and easy!  I always shake and bake pork chops and was getting tired of it.  I came across this recipe and had all the ingredients so I gave it a shot.  My husband and 11yo son loved them.  I added extra wine so I more sauce.  I only simmered mine for 10 min and they were perfect.  My only problem was that I could'nt get good color on the pork chops.  They just did'nt want to brown.  I made more than 4 and tried to brown them at the same time, maybe that was to much.  Next time I'll try to brown them in batches.  Otherwise, this was very tasty.

excellent! I made this recipe with only 2 pork chops and the sauce was just enough. If I were making 4 I'd definitely double the recipe for the sauce. Savory and delicious, a hit with my family. Thank you for sharing this!

Wonderful.  I did not have 1 inch thick chops so I pounded the thinner ones out to tenderize.  I did make a few changes.  Sauteed shallots, used fresh rosemary, sauteed mushrooms and eliminated the salt.  It was still a bit salty for my taste but I do not use salt in any of my cooking so I may be overly sensitive to it.

This was very good! I used thin cut pork loins, but they actually cooked very nicely and were still juicy after about 25 minutes of cooking in the sauce. It was my first dinner I cooked for my boyfriend and he and I loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

My family and I have never been big pork chop eaters, but this recipe has made converts out of all of us.  These are very flavorful and this is my "go to" pork chop recipe.  Thank you!

Very good. I only used 2 tablespoons of butter for four pork chops.  The pork chops turn out very tender.

Nice and simple! I tripled the sauce, as I was making 9 pork chops - and I think I would double it for 4 to make sure there was enough. I would also suggest adding the salt nearer the end after your sauce reduces a bit - I didn't need as much as written, but that might just be my preference. Thanks for the recipe - a good, easy keeper!

The chops were flavorful and juicy.  I didn't have any broccoli.  So, I stir-fried green beans in the cooking liquid.  I don't like green beans cooked with meat, but they were very good.

This is the best recipe I have ever used to make pork chops!  The flavor of the "gravy" was amazing.  Unlike a lot of popular chops recipes, the sauce didn't overpower the nice cut of meat!  The one problem I did have was that towards the end of the cooking time, the pan gravy seemed to be drying out too fast so I added a little extra white wine.  I loved it, so did my honey, therefore, this is my new default pork chop recipe!!  Thanks

These were soo good! I made them exactly like the recipe calls for and they were great! I will leave out the salt next time as they were a touch too salty for my taste. The different brands of wines perhaps make a difference in how salty? Its such a simple recipe and yet it takes so good that its definitely a keeper for us!

This turned out to be very tasty.  It's a keeper in my book.  Although I did add a little more wine as some have suggested for more sauce, it still wasn't enough for me.  Next time, I'll either cover or turn down the heat just a bit when simmering.

This is a very easy and delicious dish!  I simmered the chops for a while longer than the recipe called for since they were so big. They came out very moist and flavorful. Also, I used fresh rosemary since I was out of the dried and added a little more wine than was called for to have more of the wonderful sauce.

I am always hesitant on trying new recipes but this was a major hit with my husband and I! The only thing I changed was that I doubled some of the ingredients so I had a little more sauce to put over the pork chops. Extra rosemary is wonderful too! Thanks for the recipe!!!

It was great.  I did have to add more wine (about 1 cup) and cook the pork chops longer (at least 45 minutes if not an hour), but besides that, everything was perfect! Thanks!

Family absolutely loved this.  I did the steamed broccoli in the pan juices for about 5 minutes and it was equally loved.  There was literally not a bit left over and my daughters (9 and 14) were still asking for more.

The flavor was pretty good.  I used white meat chops, but maybe the dark would have more flavor.  There wasn't enough in the pan for any kind of sauce to put over the chops and they took much longer to cook than the 25 minutes the recipe stated it would take.  So all in all, I don't think I'd do this one again.

I did a variation of this recipe.  I substituted chicken stock for the white wine, as I didn't have any.  And 2T olive oil for the butter.  The results were amazing!  My husband raved about the flavor.  Such a good recipe to add flavor and change to pork chops.

We thought this was pretty darned good, but not outstanding.  I followed the reciepe exactly and wouldn't suggest changing anything including the cooking time.  I did use boneless chops and they were almost overcooked, it might take longer if there are bones in your chops.  I will definately be making this again.

This was really good.  Had to cook the chops longer than the 20 min and they did dry out a little.  Next time I will double the sauce and thicken it.  That was the only complaint my family had.  Thanks!

This was delicious! I think I might have simmered it on too high of heat, because most of the sauce boiled away, so I added another 2 tablespoons of butter and another 1/4 cup of wine, and it worked out well.  I steamed broccoli and used the extra sauce to dip the broccoli in.  It was very tasty - thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty, yet not overally spicey.  The family loved it.  I have to say it was an easy dish to make and very flavorful.  I recommend this one.

These were pretty good.  Used apple juice like another reviewer suggested since I didn't have any white wine on hand.  Cook time closer to 30 mins.  Also, if you half the recipe make sure you keep the amount of sauce the same.

not bad, but not a lot of punch. Maybe they would be better with fresh rosemary?

Loved it! I also added chopped portobello mushroom and onion. Cooking time was increased to 25 minutes. A winner in my book!

YUM! Added 1/2 onion and rubbed pork with salt, pepper & garlic as someone else suggested.  Also used butter substitute.  Came out great- will definitely make again.

I found this to be a bit bland for my tastes...but to be fair, I did this in the slow cooker as opposed to stove top, so that may have made a difference.  I DID double all the seasonings though, but I also added a wedged sweet potato and carrots, so maybe they soaked up all the flavor (although they seemed a bit bland as well).  If I were to try this again, I would add more salt and some other seasonings perhaps...Thanks anyway.

Hmmm...I'm not sure about this one. Admittedly I used a different meat - a ham steak instead of pork chops but I didn't taste anything except white wine and salt! I might be willing to try it again with the chops but I'm not sure 20 minutes was enough time to cook out the flavor of the wine. My husband liked it but I didn't so I'm giving it 3 stars!

The sauce smelled great and it has some potential, but it was bland.  My chops turned out tough too.

The sauce smelled great and was very tasty.  The chops did come out a bit dry, but that could be my cooking rather than the recipe.
