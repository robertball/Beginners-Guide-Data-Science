I never manage to cook egg-dipped sandwiches all the way through without burning them, so I made this slightly differently: I dipped the bread in egg, cooked one side in the skillet, removed them and made the sandwich, then returned it to the skillet with the cooked sides facing inwards. Worked out perfectly. Thanks!

A trick I learned after too many sandwiches turning out raw in the middle? Make your "french toast" first. Cook it until the bread is very lightly browned and remove from skillet. Cool it a little, then top with your ham and cheese and make your sandwich. Then, all you have to do is finish cooking it in the skillet until the cheese is melted. Same outcome, no more raw middle!

For sodium content I reduced the amount of ham by half, and also reduced the amount of cheese.

Very good.  Perfect for leftovers.  I skipped the Worcestershire and hot sauce and it still came out to be very tasty.  Great on a potato roll.

This was awesome!! Made it exactly as the recipe called for, but  used colby-jack instead of cheddar, but it was still very, very good! Served with fries, perfect quick meal! Boyfriend loved it.

Great concept! However, I was not fond of the Worcestershire flavor. Make sure to cook over low heat so it heats through and melts the cheese without burning the bread.

Interesting... Pretty good... I used some peach salsa and honey mustard dressing in the sandwich so I changed it up a bit but the dip was very interesting and good  I haven't had anything quite like it before.  I will probably make this again...

This recipe did not work for me and I just ate the ham out of the middle.  I followed the recipe exactly but the flavor was odd and the bread on the inside was soggy.

I didn't care for this, but I guess when I want a "grilled cheese" I want a crispy traditional grilled cheese sandwich. For those that really like a Monte Cristo type sandwich, this would be an excellent recipe, but not for me.

Not bad at all, I didn't have hot pepper sauce so it was a bit blan, but I fixed that by serving it with a dollop of tomato ketchup. Great recipe for those in a rush.

Something a little different. Worcestershire flavor was dominant but I liked the way this turned out. I do love worcestershire though :) I ended up with plenty of egg mix left, so I am sure that cutting it in half would still coat 2 sandwiches. I'd eat this again, but I doubt my family would dare try it. It wasn't spicy but it did have a little warmth to it.

I cooked these slowly so that the cheese was completely melted. Good food to spoil yourself with on a cold night!

I actually made this with ham salad and added a slice of tomato. Great sandwich to go with a bowl of tomato soup on a chilly day. Thanks so much, it was really yummy!

We have ham running out our ears due to my Mom's excellent $find$ on hams. This is kind of like a Monte Cristo sandwich. We just used American cheese slices, cheddar would probably have been better. This is good. Thanks.

This was okay for me, not great.  I wanted it to be crispy but it was not.  Have to say that I left out the worcestershire sauce because it just seemed so much compared to the amount of egg.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

This sandwich really didn't have the taste that I excepted considering it contained hot sauce. But I thank you for submitting it.

Absolutely surprised. Did not put hot sauce in but better half added it to his.  I put syrup over mine I will now call this stuffed French toast. It was excellent.
