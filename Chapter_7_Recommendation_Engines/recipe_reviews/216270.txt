I made this for Christmas dinner and my family loved it. I do not eat pork and used turkey bacon in place of pancetta. Will definitely make again.

I'm always experimenting with stuffing recipes.  Made this for Christmas dinner, didn't change a thing and everyone loved it!

I halved the recipe since only 4 would be eating for this Thanksgiving, but kept the same amount of pancetta (because really, there's never not enough bacon!) and sherry. It was delicious! Everyone loved it!

A wonderful recipe -- unique and tasty. I mixed the finished recipe with a little mashed potatoes (kind of a PA Dutch version), which probably made it even tastier!

I usually don't like stuffing but really liked this. Couldn't find pancetta but used good quality bacon and it was still good.

I have the pickiest family when it comes to stuffing so imagine my shock when I was asked why I did not make a double batch!  I cooked the pancetta separately because I was concerned that the onions were becoming a dark brown mess.  When I added the pancetta I made sure to add all the juice from the pan as well.  Rave reviews from my group of 16 this year at Thanksgiving.

This recipe was delicious! I used bacon instead of pancetta because it was more readily available. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I found the rosemary to be almost a tad bit overpowering. I would make this recipe again but with only half the amount of rosemary.

I have made versions of this recipe for every Turkey dinner over the last 3 years. I tend to substitute maple bacon instead of pancetta, balsamic or apple cider vinegar instead of sherry, and I make my own breadcrumbs and seasonings. I used to cook for a living and people are always having seconds and thirds of this awesome stuffing!
