Liked the idea if the merengue on the top, but I think I'll stick to my usual rice pudding recipe. I found using just the egg yolks to thicken it made it gritty and not creamy

This was my favorite dish as a child and this recipe didnâ€™t disappoint. For a little twist, I used Almond extract instead of vanilla. Yum!

It was something different than I am use to making. I come from a swedish backround so making this was really cool.
