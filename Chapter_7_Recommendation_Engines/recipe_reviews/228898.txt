I liked this.  I don't have a reference to compare it to, but I would make this again.  I only used 14 ounces of tofu, it was all that would fit in the pot.  Loved the noodles.  My friend gave me fish flakes, so I made my own dashi stock.  I look forward to trying more recipes like this.

I made this recipe exactly as written and thought it was fantastic. I spent a semester studying in Japan (which does not make me an expert, but it does at least make me familiar) and I have to say this struck me as a very authentic, delicious dish. Make sure not to skip the mirin or dashi - their flavors are a must.

This is very close to the nabeyaki udon my grandma used to make.  The dashi stock is important, but if unavailable, chicken stock can work. It is very important to use fresh udon noodles. If you use packaged dry noodles, they will get very soggy and the texture ruins the dish.  I like to crack the eggs into the boiling broth and stir it a bit, then there are no big yolk balls.  In Hawaii, we eat nabeyaki udon with a bowl of hot rice. Yum yum!

Unfortunately I had chicken broth and not dashi. I'm sure this would be perfect if I were using the right ingredients. As it was, I thought it was great and will certainly make it again.

Great recipe. Used dried dashi powder from the japanese market (1 tsp per 3 cups of water). Only thing I would do differently would be not to add the extra salt as the dashi powder and soy sauce provided enough on their own. I like broth so I doubled the recipe and added a package of diced chicken thighs. I only used 1 package of tofu which was enough for me and I used half a package of dried shitakes which I soaked in water to reconstitute and then sliced them up.

This was a very delicious and surprising hearty soup.   Almost most too much "stuff" and not enough broth.  I will be mindful of adding another couple cups of dashi broth next time.   Flavor was nice though and tasted even better the next day.

Delicious! Used oyster mushrooms instead of shitake & left out the eggs but it was still unbelievably tasty. Used the konbudashi recipe (with bonito flakes) on this site as the base. My whole family ate it including my 3 year old who had never had Japanese food before.

I do not eat meat, so did not put in chicken or eggs. The soup was delicious!

Delicious but a little salty.  I might try reduced sodium soy sauce next time.

Mama liked it but. She told me next time cook the noodles but don't add them to the soup until she's ready to eat it. Apparently if you cook the noodles with the soup they get soggy. Next time I'll cook the noodles separately and she can throw them in when she wants to.

Amazing! Whole family loved it! Had to improvise a bit. No prepared dashi so I made my own. Used roasted seaweed but couldn’t find bonito flakes. I found a great fish bouillon paste for stock and it came out great. I don’t do tofu so added a few extra shiitakes and used beef instead of chicken. A new staple in our home for sure.

This has become a regular dinner in my family. We all love the taste of dashi, and while I prefer it without chicken, my husband won't eat the tofu.  So I pick out the chicken, he picks out the tofu, and a happy family eats together.  Seriously, make your own dashi if you can, and use mirin.  I ran out one time and made it with sake, but it was too harsh for the delicate chicken and broth.

I made it today. Made my own dashi stock with bonito flakes. The changes that I would bring though is dilute the stock a little bit cause I for one could not sip that base on its own and it felt a bit too overwhelming after several bites. And add more veggies - more carrots, mushrooms, bok choys. I actually did add more baby bok choy (14 or something). But will likely add some more next time. Also I added more chicken - 4 breasts. Didnt have tofu and I wanted to make this a more wholesome meal. Finally, I substituted leeks for green onion (since this was what I had) and added six eggs instead of four ;)

I doubled the batch and between the 3 of us, we ate it all!  Really good and easy.  I loaded it with more vegetables and diluted the broth a bit.

Great comfort food--maybe more liquid to substance ratio necessary but really quite lovely over all.

Super yummy and very easy.  I added shiitake mushrooms and used an amino acid "soy sauce".  All three of my children loved it.  If you get good udon it actually saves for a day or two nicely!

This was delicious! Very flexible recipe. I used veggie stock and added some bonito flakes to it. I had no other veggies but kale, and the soup was quite yummy with just noodles and kale.

Made a simplified version, without the noodles. The eggs were scrumptious, and the shiitakes just delicious. So easy to make! Definitely adding it to my rotation. Thanks!!

Great - and so easy!  For those who have never tried Japanese noodle soups - this is basically a healthier version of instant raman.  If you like that, you'll like this.  I use a 12 oz package of tofu and thought it was plenty.  You could make this with more broth if you like a brothier soup.
