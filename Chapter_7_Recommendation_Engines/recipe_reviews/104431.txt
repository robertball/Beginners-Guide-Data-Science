This was my first trying empanadas. These turned out great! I added yellow onions and green chili peppers that were in a can. Real easy to make!

I really wasn't sure how to rate this.  Our family loved it however I made several changes by combining several recipes I found.  Sorry if this is long winded but here is what I did.  First I made a seasoning mix with 1 tbs cumin, 2 tbs Paprika, 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder, dash of salt and a dash of pepper. I sauteed 1/2 a med white onion in olive oil, then added 1 lbs ground beef.  I used about 3/4 of the seasoning mix while browning the beef.  I then drained the beef well and back in the pan mixed in about 4 1/2 oz plain tomato sauce, 1 4oz drained can of green chilies and 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese. With it off the heat let the filling cool a bit.  While it was cooling I started flattening out my biscuits (the large, home style grands) when they were good and flat (about 2.5-3in across) I spooned about 1.5-2 tbs of filling in the center, folded over and pinched the ends, brushed them with beaten egg and baked on a greased cookie sheet for 15 min at 375. I have a little bit of filling leftover but the hubby requested I save it for burritos tomorrow. :)  We were all very impressed with the flavor, even my 2year old.

This was great!  The filling was perfect and the biscuit dough made it so easy.  The recipe kept in my refrigerator for a few days without spoiling too!

This was a fun recipe to make, my first time and so simple.  I used Jumbo biscuits, added chopped onion, chili powder and a bit of cumin to the meat mixture.  It made a lot of empanadas!  Froze the leftovers on a baking sheet then used the Food Saver to save them for a quick snack later on.  Will play with other fillings, possibly calzone!

The filling on these was good, but I added onion and jalepeno as well.  I agree with others about this being slightly misleading and not like any empanada I've ever had.  That being said, this is still a decent recipe but I had a really hard time with the dough as another reviewer mentioned as well.  I will probably try this again with large biscuits.  Update: If your even thinking about trying this, make the Fried Empanadas recipe instead: you make your own dough, but its really simple...also, those can be baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes if you don't want to fry them.

The filling is really great!  The only trouble I had with the recipe was the biscuit dough.  When I tried to fold the dough over the filling, I got holes in the dough.  Next time I will try the suggestion to use the large biscuits. I might also try puff pastry.

Served this at a party and everyone loved it.  Only complaint is that it leaked a bit - so be sure to seal tightly.

would I be able to fry these in oil instead of baking them? I might try it this week and see how they come out.

Added chopped onion, cumin and adobo sauce to the meat filling. While I thought that the biscuit was a bit much, the kids loved them.

It just wasn't that great.  It didn't really have a tex mex flavor. Kind of italian actually.

These were pretty good.  I gave them four stars instead of five because they weren't really like an empanada, which are fried.  For what it was though (baked biscuits with meat filling), it was good.

Boyfriend and I both loved them. I was already preparing a full pound of ground beef, so I just double the recipe, and got a whole bunch of these (not that that's a bad thing). :)

I followed this recipe exactly, and was unimpressed with the results. The biscuit taste was overpowering and the filling was rather bland. I've made other empanada recipes before and loved them, but decided to give these a try since they seemed simple. I'm not sure what happened since everyone else seems to love these, but mine were not good. Next time, I'll spend the extra time to make dough instead of using premade biscuits.

I thought this was a really good quick recipe.  My toddlers loved it and they tend to be very picky when it comes to anything with meat in it.  Thanks "LoveMy3Boys": I used your seasoning tips and it was a really good beef mixture.

I thought these were great and very easy to make.  The only change I made was I used left over steak instead of ground beef and doubled the amount of chiles.  I will make these again.  Thanks for the recipe!

these were okay. not a huge fan of the refrigerated canned biscuit flavor. but the filling was really good.
