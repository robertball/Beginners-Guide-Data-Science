These are good if you are looking for a cookie that is not real sweet.  Easy to make. Followed recipe exactly, if I were to make it again I would use sweeter chocolate.

I added some ground toasted almonds to give it more body, and these were great. The ganache is terrific. It sets perfectly. These were a hit.

Delicious, with or without the ganache! Also added toasted ground almonds like another review said, though not completely ground because they added a slight crunch to the consistency. Not too sweet and perfect with coffee or tea.

Very simple to throw together with common ingredients. Did not have the brand of specified chocolate, so I used 8 ozs. of another popular brand. Came out Great!

These cookies present very well, but seem to lack in taste... although the ganache is very nice, the base needs more.
