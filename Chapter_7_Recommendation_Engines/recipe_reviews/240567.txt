Did not care for this recipe, to much ginger and cinnamon.

I had to add way more sugar than it called for because my icing was runny. I brushed it on the cookies with a grill brush for braising. They dried pretty quickly so if you are wanting to add sprinkles or decorative candies you'll want to do so before icing the entire batch. Doesn't taste very good by itself but compliments a ginger cookie pretty well.
