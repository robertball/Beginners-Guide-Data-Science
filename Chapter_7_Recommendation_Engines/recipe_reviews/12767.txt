This was awesome!!!! I used Shrimp bisque, 3/4 lb of fresh peeled shrimp, used OLD BAy seasoning, pepper and Garlic powder from here I followed the recipe, but a note to those complaining of the pasta problems, DO NOT USE hard pasta boxed or wrapped, many major supermarkets sell refrigerated pasta which is more fresh and VERY soft, where you will have no problem mixing in the pasta, but if you're in a bind and only have hard angel hair, I would think to cook the pasta a bit where it softens up for you and is mixable.  But this dish is ti die for, no question...

WOW!!! My husband and I both LOVED this! I would make it again. After reading other reviews, I didnt want to take a chance of it being to "dry". So I used 1 1/2 cups of milk, and cut the mayo to 3/4 cup. I broke up the pasta before I added it,and it came out GREAT!!!I think I would try Orzo pasta next time instead of angel hair.

Great base for a recipe here, but after reading the previous reviews, I couldn't follow this one as written. I didn't use angel hair pasta, but used fideo mediano noodles. Also added the extra 1/2 cup of milk, as well as 2 tsp of Old Bay seasoning and 1/4 tsp of ground black pepper and probably 2 tsp of dried parsley leaves. Also to help with the issue of the noodles not cooking all the way, cooked in a low, flat casserole dish. Will probably use 1 tbsp of Old Bay next time and possibly see about adding in dry mustard as well. Flavor was very subtle with only 2 tsp. DH kept going back for more.

This dish was delicious!! I had some trouble finding cream of shrimp soup, so I used cream of mushroom (it was the only thing in my cupboard) and it turned out wonderfully! This is definitely a recipe I'm keeping in my rotation!!

I love crab, so I thought I'd try something different... boy, was I disappointed.  The mayonnaisse completely overpowers the flavor of this casserole, and the noodles turned out sticky & undercooked.  Had to throw most of it out.

We've been making this recipe on and off for a couple of years now.  We really love it!  It's wonderfully rich and delicious with garlic bread.  We've used cream of mushroom or chicken soup if we can't find the cream of shrimp.  It works just fine that way too.

This recipe is very tasty and easy to make (I used canned shrimp and crab).  I especially like the fact that the pasta does not have to be pre-cooked.  You just add the uncooked pasta right in before you bake it.  Yum Yum!!

this is a lovely recipe.  i used cream of mushroom soup and par cooked the noodles(not angel hair), added some worchestershire, a dash of tabasco and 1/2 C. white wine and used imitation crab (8 oz.).  mixed it all together in a big bowl with some of the cheese and put it in a 9x13 pan with foil and baked for 30 min.  then uncovered and sprinkled french's fried onions for 10 more min.  great dinner and next day lunch!!

I altered this recipe a bit. I reduced the mayo to 3/4 cup, increased the milk to 1 1/2 cups, added 1 cup of water, garlic powder, minced onion, salt, and pepper. Substituted the angel hair for the multi-colored spiral noodles, substituted cream of shrimp for cream of mushroom. Instead of sharp cheddar I used 6 oz of colby-jack and 6 oz of mozzarella. FABULOUS!!!

The flavor of this dish was okay, but the texture was very pasty, and the pasta not cooked through.  I would add more milk than the recipe called for.  I couldn't with a clean nutritional conscience, add all the cheese and onions this recipe called for, and I don't think it detracted from the recipe.  Someone suggested using orzo, which I tried and think was a good idea.

Overall this was a hit.  Next time I will delete the onions and add more milk.  (It needed more to slop up with dinner rolls)  Everyone in the family loved it!  Even my husband who doesn't eat pasta.  I used angel hair pasta and added seasonings to spice it up!

I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I didn't add the french onions, and I used less shredded cheese on top. I also substituted elbow macaroni noodles for the angel hair pasta. The end result was pretty good, but the flavor wasn't extraordinary. I'm going to make it again, however next time I'm going to try cream cheese instead of the mayo (which you can taste, and I didn't like that) and I recommend using spices like Old Bay to make it more flavorful.

This definitely had Red Lobster type restaurant potential. I used some leftover medium sized boiled, peeled cocktail shrimp I had instead of salad shrimp. No crab. (I had none). I did use the cream of shrimp soup and added about 1 tsp. of minced garlic and about 2 Tbsp. of dry sherry. This was just the right flavor zing without seeming to be a Scampi wannabe. I used extra sharp cheddar and accidentally mixed it in with the soup, shrimp and mayo mixture before I realized it was supposed to be on top. No problem though, I’d make it again that way. No angel hair, so I used a small thin egg noodle that would absorb the liquid quickly. This worked out well but I did take care to submerge the noodles as much as possible. Just the right delicate flavor and the bigger shrimp made for an expensive looking dish. This would be elegant for a dinner party and it would be really restaurant special if baked and served in individual ramekins instead of casserole style. I’d make this again. Leftovers are great too if warmed up gently in the microwave. I did serve asparagus with this, perfect combo! Some of those Red Lobster type homemade cheddar biscuit clones would be fabulous with it too.

Well to start off, I was one of those women that thought you had to rate the recipe "as is" or it would'nt be fair.  Now that I tried this recipe, using ideas from other raters, I think its fine to rate it accordingly. After all if the recipe had not of been submitted there would not of been one to adjust to individual tastes, so here goes:  this is how I made this recipe and it turned out delicious.  First of all I could not find cream of shrimp soup, so I used someones suggestion to use cream of mushroom.  Next, I dont like canned cocktail shrimp so I used 1 lb. of raw shrimp (I did not cook the shrimp before adding it to the mix.) I did use a can of crab meat.  After I started making the recipe I realized that I barely had any mayonaise, so I improvised.  I used equal amounts of mayonaise, tarter sauce, and ranch dressing to make a cup. Again, Using someones else's idea I used one a half cups of milk.  I also borrowed someones else's idea and added one tablespoon of old bay seasoning, garlic powder, and pepper. I followed the rest of the recipe as printed. My husband does not like fish, nor does he like shrimp linguine, but he absolutely loved this recipe!!  So even though I'm rating this according to the changes that I made, I still credit the one that submitted the recipe in the first place!  THUMBS UP!!

I was excited about this recipe but ended up disappointed. We had to add water so the pasta could fully cook, and it took about 20 extra minutes in the oven. The flavor wasn't too exciting either-- we decided we could add seasfood to white cheddar mac and cheese and get similar results.

This was a wonderful seafood recipe I made for company last weekend.  They raved over it.  I did use the suggestion to use Orzo pasta and it turned our great.  I also added the extra milk and cut down of the mayonaise.  To spice it up, I added garlic powder, minced onion and parsley to the mixture.  We also added parmesan cheese to the top after taking the foil off and broiled it for about 3 minutes.  It was a big crowd pleaser!

This was SO. SO. GOOD!!!!!  We totally enjoyed it!  I did add a scant teaspoon of Old Bay - but would add one heaping teaspoon (or more).  I also added a clove of garlic.  Okay - also, I used fresh pasta, but I would give it a dunk in boiling water for a couple of minutes so it doesn't absorb as much liquid.  One more also!  I would add 1/4 cup more milk and 1/4 cup more mayo - just for the extra liquid.
Thank you so much for an awesome recipe that we all enjoyed!!!!

try this lobster version: 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 lb imitation lobster and 1 cup of tiny shell pasta. Substitute sour cream for the mayonnaise to lighten a little - fabulous!

Very good.  I took the advice of other reviewers and left off the onions, and added Old Bay, garlic, and pepper.  I used thin spaghetti instead of angel hair, increased the milk to 2c., and it came out great, the pasta cooked completely.

Very very good!  I added lots of garlic (2 heaping tablespoons minced). Also used 1/2 t black pepper, and skipped the hot sauce because I didn't have any on hand. Next time I think I will use less onions, maybe 1/2 cup and saute them first. This is a great company dish-very rich.

This has to be the best recipe I have ever had.  How did you ever get this?  You have to know that I have been having a taste for only seafood.  I just think that I could just eat and eat your dish forever.  If you have any more ideas, I would love to try them.

This was awsome! My husband said it could have easily passed as a Red Lobster dish! I put all the ingredients in a crock-pot on low for 3 hours, then served over angel hair pasta. I also added some minced garlic to the recipe. 
**TWO THUMBS UP!**

the wife wanted crab and shrimp quiche. I cook, my choice. made this and actually almost followed the recipe. changes-- seriously sharp cheese from cabot, 1/2 and 1/2 for cow juice sub, imitation crab, subbed half low fat mayo and low fat sour cream for the mayo, and added English peas. I did add old bays and green tobacco sauce. I tried this first as written, it was good but bland, these changes suited our taste, I'm sure folks are gonna love this as written! oops, I did break up the angel hair pasta and added it. it was fine. update...I did boil the pasta @ 4 minutes, much better. the wife said this is one of the best things she has ever eaten.

Pretty good.  I cut the recipe in 1/2.  The mayonnaise is a bit overpowering, but that is a personal taste thing.  I think I would use the entire can of soup and cut the mayo (for a 1/2 recipe).  Added a little garlic and onions

This was great!!  I only made one change.  I thought 1 cup of mayo seemed a bit much.  I only added a 1/2 cup.   I also semi-cooked the noodles before baking.  I put them in boiling water and then started to prepare everything else.  They cooked for about 5-6 minutes.  Just enough to soften them up.

I HATE to change some one's recipe!  However, I wanted something different, so I read all reviews, then proceeded to add more milk (no fat evaporated), used Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom Soup, no fat Shredded Cheddar and added Old Bay Seasoning and Parsley-a tablespoon of each!  This is a wonderful, wonderful recipe and with my changes much less fat! Please try this one, absolutely delicious!

Delicious with a few of the changes other reviewers noted: about 1 3/4 c. milk, 3/4 c. mayonnaise, Old Bay, garlic powder and freshly ground pepper.  I didn't have shrimp on hand (usually do), but I did happen to have a whole pound of crab meat, so I used that.  I also used orzo rather than angel hair, and while it was good, I wasn't satisfied with the texture - too much 'small' stuff!  I think it would've seemed like a more substantial casserole with shrimp and larger pasta to contrast with the crab.  I also left off the fried onions.  I wonder if it would taste good with some spinach to break up the monochromatic look - it was all one color!  Otherwise, very good!

Good recipe with the inclusion of Old Bay seasoning.The previous reviewer who used a can of lobster bisque soup to sub for the cream of shrimp soup must not have used any milk. I used lobster bisque and 1.5 C milk and the end product was very loose and liquidy. Good base for a recipe, though.

When I taste tested the recipe after the first 35 mins, I was in heaven!! Rich sauce, hearty pieces of seafood... But when I added the french fried onions, it changed the entire flavor of the dish. It was awful! I actually threw it out. The casserole suddenly took on a burnt taste from the onions. I will make it again but eliminate the onions and only cook the dish for the original 35 minutes... then it will earn 5 stars!

Thought this was a unique recipe, and when we made it the taste was great!
We used half the recommended onions, and that was enough for us.
The angel hair kind of stuck together - next time I'll probably break it up more, or try the Orzo suggestion... Also may try the 'more milk, less mayo' suggestion next time as well.
Overall this is a great recipe - serving suggestions & all.  We will definately eat this again!!!

I altered this recipe based on other reviews.  I only had imitation crab and cream of mushroom soup so I used that.  I also used orzo pasta and mixed mayo, Miracle Whip and cream cheese to measure one cup.  I also mixed the sharp cheddar in with the soup mixture rather than putting on top.  I baked this an extra 10 minutes uncovered to ensure that the pasta was cooked.  Both my husband and I really enjoyed this dish and I will try this again and use a different cream soup and maybe different cheese.  This is a keeper.

Family liked it, but I made several modifications, such as using Orzo, 1/2 the mayo and double the milk, mixing 1/2 the cheese in with other ingredients, adding chopped spinach and onions, extra seasoning, and 1/2 the French fried onions.

My family loves this recipe and when I have the chance to cook for another family, I like to make this dish.  Everyone raves about it.  Absolutely the most creamy, rich dinner I know.  I use miracle whip instead of mayo (b/c of personal preference) and use orzo pasta (do not pre-cook it).  It is delicious.

My hubby made this tonight.  He used rice noodles instead of angel hair, cream of celery soup instead of cream of shrimp, and cream cheese and ricotta instead of mayonnaise.  We all liked it pretty well.  I think a milder cheese would work better on top, like a montery jack.  We used sharp cheddar, and it was pretty strong.  This was cery easy to make, though, and we did enjoy it.

Great recipe.  I did a few changes.  I used large frozen shrimp in place of salad shrimp.  I did not use crab meat or the cream of shrimp soup.  I used cream of mushroom soup & also added mushrooms & yellow squash.  I used spaghetti & cooked it first before adding it to the other ingredients.

Another reviewer on this site once said that they hate it when someone rates a recipes with less than five stars when they have altered a recipe. So I am giving this five stars to make them happy. Per another reviewers suggestion I put everything in the crock pot on high for three hours. I omited the french fried onions, and added a can of sliced mushrooms, and sliced black olives. I used fat free cheese, and added fat free cream cheese, 8 ounces. I also added a little fat free sour cream to make a heathlier version, I also added 1 tbp on old bay. I still think it needs something more, but I will make again. I also served this over whole wheat spegetti noodles.

Boy, is this delicious!  I didn't think canned soup could taste so good.  I took Janie12's advice and added some Old Bay and garlic.  I didn't add crab(didn't have).  I also didn't have shrimp soup and subbed cr of mushroom instead. The addition of 1 - 2 tablespoons of cooking sherry gave this a restaurant quality taste.  I also added one soup can of milk instead of just one cup.  I will make this again, although not often because it is so rich.  Thanks so much for the post Marilyn!

Followed directions to a tee and wonder if this is some sort of All Recipe insider joke.  "Let's rate it high to see if people actually make it!"

I love, just love, seafood.  I made it and did not feed it to my family (yes, dead serious).  I don't know what to do with the leftovers.  Not looking forward to lunch today.

Terrific Recipe! I used Imitation Crab meat and Cooked Shrimp.  I substituted Sharp Cheddar and also 1/2 cup of grated Romano Cheese.  It turned out fantastic and was served to guests who raved about it.  A KEEPER!

My husband gives 4 stars, but I give 3.  I did cook the pasta half way before adding and then followed the rest of the recipe to a T.  It is a very good base recipe, but once on my plate I did sprinkle on some ceyenne pepper to kick it up.  I will keep in my rotation. Just a note, I didn't get the mayo taste that everyone else was talking about, but see no problem in decreasing it if you don't like mayo...

This was really good! I made it a couple of months ago and I'm craving it again. I couldn't find cream of shrimp soup so I used a can of shrimp bisque (which added considerably to the cost of the recipe) and it turned out fine. I'm going to use less mayonnaise next time since my husband didn't like the mayo taste, although I did! I would also make sure that all the noodles are mixed thoroughly into the liquid - otherwise you could get some uncooked noodles around the edges. Wonderful, elegant and fast!

This was absolutely delicious and really easy to make.  I think it actually tastes better when you reheat the leftovers the next day, which is saying a lot in a family that doesn't like leftovers.

Great base recipe with lots of options! We had just cracked 3 dozen blue crabs (cooked Maryland style), so we used that and large peeled uncooked shrimp. I marinated the meat in Old bay, dry mustard & parsley (about 1T each), replaced the cream of shrimp soup with 1/2 can cream of celery & 1/2 can cream of mushroom. 2 cups of milk and 1/2 cup of mayo, plus 1/2 cup of water. Folded all that into the dish and sprinkled 1/2 cheddar 1/2 monterey jack. After 35 sprinkle on top crushed doritos (it works!) and then broil for 10 mins to brown the top better.  Great!

I followed the recipe perfectly but it just ended tasting like mayonaise.

This truly was sensational!  Used Pasta shell noodles that cook in 12min. & took advice on using the cream of mushroom soup also used mozarella cheese, no onions.  Thank you for the quick easy recipe.

This dish taste awesome!  But to be fair, I have to say that I did NOT use the "onions"......blech, those so totally do not go with seafood dishes!  And not ALL my pasta cooked thru.  I will make again, but next time partially cook the pasta or add more milk as other raters suggested.  Thanks for the input fellow raters!!

Horrible! The noodles were not cooked, and the taste was horrendous. I wouldn't even know where to begin to save this one. We had to throw and entire 13 X 9 dish of it out!

This was awesome. I did alter it: used 1lb canned crabmeat&omitted shrimp, used the orzo suggestion, added the 1/2c milk as suggested, sprinkled in garlic powder&old bay, reduced the cheese by 1/2&subbed Mexican mixture for cheddar and omitted the onions. Guess it's almost a new recipe!

This recipe was very tasty.  I had garlic bread and tossed salad with it.  I will be making it again in the future.

I was looking for a recipe to use up a can of crab meat other than just making crab cakes again.  This was good but not great.
