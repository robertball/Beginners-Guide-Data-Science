I really liked these. I had to do a couple of changes, i could not find my waffle iron so i made pancakes instead, and they had a nice crust(probably due to the corn meal) and nice and soft inside. I used coconut milk because i don't care for soy milk and i used gluten free oats and white rice flour.I did add some maple syrup to them. Very nice change from the regular waffle(pancake) breakfast.Thank you sueb for this recipe. It is a keeper..

I added 1 TBL sugar to the batter to try to help them to brown.  Use a fork and a spatula to remove from waffle iron because they want to crumble.  Pretty good for FODMAP.

It was hearty and yummy!

I used apple sauce instead of the oil.

As listed, these were missing something. I added 1/2 teaspoon salt, a tsp. of vanilla extract and a few tablespoons of organic sugar, substituted almond milk for the soy milk, and substituted Bob's Red Mill All-purpose Gluten-free flour instead of the rice flour. End result? Really flavorful pancakes. Would definitely make it again.

We thought these were very good - very mild in flavor, so they are a good base for whichever flavors you want to use, whether sweet (syrup, fruit, etc.) or savory (I think these would be awesome with chili over the top)! We served them for breakfast with maple syrup and everyone enjoyed them.
