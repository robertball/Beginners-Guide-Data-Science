What a simple recipe...and very tasty sauce!  The second time I made this, I didn't have time to make the meatballs, so I used cocktail weiners.  I also doubled the ketchup and brown sugar, except instead of double the ketchup, I added 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 KC Masterpeice Honey Smoke BBQ sauce.  I left it in the slow cooker on low for about 6 hours so that the weiners and sauce really got to cook together.  It was such a hit that I printed copies of the recipe and handed them out to over a dozen guests who asked for it!!  The wonderful thing about this recipe is that the base recipe is so simple, that "playing around", being creative, and really experimenting with different ingrediants will make everyone happy who tries this recipe.  With a little imagination, the possibilities of this recipe are endless!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Overall not a bad recipe.  I made this for dinner last night.  Very easy to make.  I would have left it cooking in the slow cooker longer though, maybe even overnight to really let the sauce cook in.  Turn it on low heat and leave it for the next night.  I too added the extra lb. of ground beef, I don't think it would have stayed together otherwise.  Then for the sauce you'll need to double the sugar and ketchup.  Instead I left the ketchup and sugar as it was and also added 1 can of crushed pineapple and 1 cup of my favorite BBQ sauce.  The sauce was great, but next time I might add some crushed red pepper or hot sauce to it as well.  It is a fantastic base recipe though, better than buying frozen meatballs, and if you just play with it a bit to get it how you really want it, it'll be your favorite meatball recipe.

This is a really simple and tasty appetizer! I highly recommend it to all. I was a little leary about the ketchup and brown sugar thing but it was delicious!!! I don't have kids to try it on so I tested it out on the people I work with and they disappeared! (the meatballs, not the people!)One person even ate them at 10am!! Definately try this one.

It does need something to hold the meatballs together...I find cooking them in the oven a couple extra minutes, maybe 5, works well.  Very easy to make and the sauce is a simple crowd pleaser.

The meat mixture was too soupy...I wonder if there are supposed to be breadcrumbs or cracker crumbs or something.  I added cracker crumbs and it worked well.  I only used half the amount of onion soup mix, and it was plenty!  Tasty, but not fabulous.

I made this for a recent Christmas party. I ended up eating about ten of them after they got out of the oven. They were very tasty. The sauce could be improved, you could use your own variations. Overall though this was an easy recipe to make.

This is a very good recipe that I have made countless times.  People always ask for the recipe (which I now know by heart) and I prefer this taste over the traditional "grape jelly" cocktail sauce.

I chose this recipe because it was so simple! The classic brown sugar and ketchup mix never goes wrong! :)  I cheated and got frozen meatballs from Costco because I was short on time and heated them up in my crock pot...Was a big hit at the party!

We have been making these meatballs for years and they always disappear. The meat mixture is somewhat sticky so I use a small cookie scoop to form the meatballs. I works great.

One of my go-to recipes!

I got this recipe years ago out of a Crock-Pot cookbook (with slightly different proportions) and it's definitely become one of my family's favorites and one of my party staples. The first time I made them was for my friend's son's first birthday, and they were a huge hit! Everyone loved them. It's amazing how those simply, almost cheap-sounding ingredients can create such a lovely tangy sauce.

I serve these for dinner sometimes over rice, or with crusty rolls to make sandwiches. They're also part of our annual Christmas Eve buffet-style dinner.

I make it with 1/4 cup of regular milk instead of 2/3 evaporated, and bake the balls for about 20 minutes at 325. For the sauce I use 2 cups ketchup, and I use dark brown sugar rather than light, and mix them right in the crock, no need to use a separate bowl. A touch of soy--maybe a Tbsp or so--is lovely in it as well. None of my measurements are exact at this point, since I've made it so many times, but that's basically it. Then I cook it on Low for 2 hours or so. 

A great recipe for any occasion. And the leftovers are just as delicious.

I use store bought meatballs (Rosina Italian Style meatballs are the best).  I added the mustard seed and Worcestershire sauce to the sauce.  Like others have said, play around with the recipe to suit your taste.  I also cooked them longer than the recipe said.  Be careful not to overcook.  I have had several people ask for the recipe.  It's so easy.

These were wonderful! I did add some bread crumbs, just 1/2 cup, because I was worried about them holding their shape. I took them to a family gathering on Christmas Eve and I got compliments from everyone! I also added a little garlic pepper to the sauce because I love that stuff!

Good except I recommend doubling the recipe as it is small, and 2 pkg's of onion soup mix is plenty even when doubled.

This IS an great recipe as is ~ but I only use 1 pkg dry onion soup mix.  BUT, lately, making the meatballs has become a tad time-consuming even though I love to entertain.  I now cheat: I buy the meatballs, use the ketchup & brown sugar per the recipe, but since it is a little sweet, I throw in 1/4c mustard in to counter the sweet.  Very good recipe both from scratch and modified.  Thanks for the posting!

I just don't know where I went wrong with this recipe. It turned out WAY too sweet for my taste and I could swear that I'd tasted the ketchup. Others in the house said that they were good but not great like the reviewers noted. Might be worth trying again w/some minor tweaking.

I adjusted this recipe a little. I used the meat recipe as it is shown but I didn't use the sauce suggested, I used a bottle to Diana's BBQ sauce and I put the sauce with 1 cup of water into a pressure cooker as I don't have a slow cooker, 15 minutes in there and they were a hit at my party, 9 people took your recipe! I will make these every chance I get as they make ME look good! Thanks so much for this recipe.

I wasn't that impressed with these, they were ok.....not as good as I was expecting. Too sweet and sugary for my taste (between the high fructose corn syrup in the ketchup and the brown sugar)
Probably won't make these again.

I made this as an appetizer on Christmas Eve.  Everyone really liked them!  I kept asking for feedback once my guests tried them and they all said they were pretty good.  They weren't totally gone, but I think that is because I had about four other appetizers out as well.  Will do again.  I did change the recipe a bit, however.  I added 1 cup bread crumbs, and added 2 1/2 pds of ground beef (as oppose to 1 - read the reviews before I made them and I noticed a lot of the responses was that it was too saucy so I fixed that by adding more beef).

Tastes like meatloaf in ball form. Mine didn't stay together though.  Maybe more breadcrumbs next time.

The meatballs were very tasty.  In preparing them, however, I added an extra pound of ground beef.  (There's a lot of liquid in this recipe.)  As a result, I added a little more ketchup and brown sugar (for the sauce).  Very tasty though.  Great as leftovers for meatball sandwiches!

Hoping for the best with all the good reviews, but just tasted like meat and ketchup, even after allowing it to sit in crock pot for a long time.

I thought that these tasted like regular cocktail meatballs.  They were good, but this is not an "out of this world" recipe.  I took the advice of another reviewer and doubled the sauce.

I don't eat beef but judging by my friends' reaction, they get 5*****! Many compliments and I admit the smell of the sauce slow cooking in the CrockPot was delicious to me! I used slightly over 1lb. of beef and had no problems with the balls being too 'wet' but also sprinkled some seasoned breadcrumbs anyway. Half BBQ sauce/half Ketchup for the sauce. I broiled for 10 min then put in CrockPot for 3 hrs --> were slightly overdone this way though. A hit appetizer and easy!

Quick and delishious appetizer. No one will ever guess what is in the sauce. I've been making the sauce after tasting it at a holiday party many years ago. If you are short on time, use the store frozen meat balls. Thanks for sharing!
