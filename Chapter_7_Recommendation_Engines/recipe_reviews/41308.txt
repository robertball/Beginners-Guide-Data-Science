I normally dont change recipes too much, but this recipe was such a great base that I got creative!  I had some leftover shredded zucchini that I needed to use up when I came across this recipe; 1C Zucchini and 1C shredded carrots. In place of the sugar, I used 1C Splenda and 1/4C brown sugar.  I used 1C whole wheat flour and 1- 1/4C all purpose flour.  In place of raisins I used half raisins and half dried cherries.  I also added a dash each of ground cloves and ground nutmeg.  I then glazed them with clear icing and sprinkled toasted coconut.  They turned out moist and tasted fabulous!

Excellent! Made this for teacher appreciation breakfast, one of over 20 items we served. Because so many choices offered, I made these as mini muffins. Used 1/2 walnuts, 1/2 pecans. Soaked raisins in pineapple juice. Greased mini muffin pans with cooking spray. Baked 20 min. Made 6 dz.

For added moistness I soaked the raisins in the reserved pineapple juice for about 15 minutes. I strained the raisins, saving the juice. I used the pineapple juice and made a powdered sugar glaze for the muffins. Little sweater, little less healthy, but really good.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time and then altered it the second time.  Alterations I made that made it better: cut out the pineapple (kids don't like it), cut the apple (extra step), added 1 more cup of grated carrots (to replace the apple), used 3/4c oil and 1/2c applsc (made it more moist and dense), increased the coconut to 1 cup (just because I like it), increased the nuts to 1 cup (just because I like it).  I sell muffins at my husbands shop and they are going to love this one!

I thought these muffins were okay, but my children practically inhaled them.  They are quite a lot of work for muffins, but I will definitely be making them again for the kids.

These were pretty good.  My 12 month old loves them.  I like the combination of healthy foods.  I am leaving it 5 star b/c I altered the recipe somewhat - halved the sugar and threw in a tablespoon of wheat germ. I may try it again with the original recipe.

These were absolutely delicious - sort of like a mini-carrot cake. I left the coconut out, but otherwise followed the recipe and received many compliments when I took them to church. They're very moist, even a couple of days later. The tops of mine got a little gooey, but that might be because I made them at night and they may not have cooled completely before I wrapped them up. I'll definitely make these again.

These are good muffins and they make a good snack or breakfast.  My 4 year old is not a carrot person, so I have to make sure and mix the carrots in real well or he'll think "orange worms" are in his muffins.  You could definitely add or take away what you like...cinnamon is good. I like making the mini muffins so my 1 year old can eat them too.

When I was in college, the local bagel shop sold these muffins.  After I got a job and moved away, I missed them so much!  This recipe is just like them!  It's awesome!  Don't judge it by the ingredients!

So good and moist! These are well worth the work of grating and chopping. I followed the recipe except I did omit the coconut. We had a brunch for Christmas and everyone loved these muffins. Everyone wants them again for New Years.

Really sweet, interesting, good! Very moist!  A different taste in every bite! They did not really rise as I'd expected but I don't find that a problem at all as the texture was fine. Maybe it's something I did or the quality of baking soda but I will be making these often even if nothing changes. A 1/4 cup measure is just right for 3" muffins (24).

Followed the recipe exactly and was rewarded with sweet, wonderful, flavorful muffins.  I will definitely make these again and again and again.  I might try using brown sugar instead of white sugar and cutting back a little bit, because they are pretty sweet.  Resist the temptation to gobble them all up straight out of the oven--the flavor is even better the second day.

I loved this recipe for several reasons!  The flavor and texture was excellent!  The nutritous ingredients make them a hearty, healthy snack or addition to breakfast.  Even though these didn't rise like a typical muffin, I wouldn't hesitate to make them again and again!  Thank you for submitting this recipe!

Was looking for a recipe I could turn vegan due to some diet restrictions I'm having to follow--and this recipe STILL was excellent.  Used all wheat flour, pumpkin for the oil, 1/2 banana + 1/4 tsp baking powder for each egg, honey and brown sugar for the sugar.  The results were excellent.  Thanks.

Lots of compliments at brunch. Very good.
However, baked them in Texas Muffin Pans, they
took 34 minutes.Perhaps setting should be higher,
advise if you have a solution to this.  I will make them again, they are sooooo good.

I thought these were just okay.  Followed the recipe exactly. They tasted like some of the Light versions of muffins I've tried.  Probably won't make again any time soon, too much work.

Excellent taste, and well worth the work (I don't have a food processor)!  I omitted the coconut and added flax seeds and sunflower seeds.  Also, used whole wheat flour, and they had an nice texture. After reading other people's comments about these muffins not rising well, I noticed there was no baking powder listed in the ingredients.  I included 1 tablespoon, and this seemed to be the right amount.  They rose well.  Would definitely make again.

Moist, delicious and stay fresh for several days.  I changed the recipe around a little with more whole wheat and unrefined sugar...my family and coworkers loved them.

Excellent muffins!  It did stick to the muffin papers though, next time I will probably just spray the pan instead of using them.

I, as well as a number of other adults, really enjoyed this recipe.  All the ingredients give these muffins a sweet and moist taste.  My boyfriend enjoyed these so much that he requested more!  However, I would not make this recipe for kids.  When I took them to my Sunday school class (the kids are 4), some of them refused to eat them because of the "vegetables stuck inside."

These muffins were easy & delicious!  
I substituted diced canned peaches 
for the apple & put a crumb top on them.  Awesome!

Substituted mostly whole wheat flour and used brown sugar (only one cup and still very sweet I think). I liked these muffins but I found the pineapple overwhelming, I think I will throw in some chunks of apple next time and just leave the pineapple out - was one too many flavours and it just took away from the rest of the muffin. Still good, just needs some tweaking!

This is an awesome recipe.  Made for my mom while she was recovering from surgery to serve to her friends when they visited, they all raved. They are moist and light and sweet.  Full of lots of nutritious good stuff too!!

These are wonderful and oh so moist.  I made 2 double batches this weekend and froze them.  Preperation is quick if you have a food processor.  I did not grate carrots and apples, shreadded in food processor and worked great.  YUMMY.  Did not add raisins or nuts as we do not care for either.  Still out of site!!

I find many Morning Glory muffin recipes to be very oily but the applesauce in these muffins prevents that.  I cut the sugar to a scant cup and made 20 large muffins that baked in 24 minutes.  A good breakfast muffin.

24 muffins gone in a flash! This moist, dense muffin is glorious indeed. Now my teen son has asked me to make this in a bundt cake pan to save him the trouble of unwrapping each muffin. That way he figures he can eat three at once.

I made these for a early morning visit from my pastor. They made the house smell wonderful and were very tasty. I left out the raisins, because I don't care for them. I also did a little drizzle of a glaze on the top. Mmm perfect. Thanks for the recipe.

I made the mistake of leaving out the coconut and raisens.. the muffins were extremely doughy.  I should have compensated with more flour.  I don't know if I'll make these again.

Very good! I added some Wheat Germ and substituted some wheat flour for about 1. cup of the white flour. Plus I diced up some dried apricots instead of the raisins! 

I will definitely make them again.

I made this specifically for my toddler who won't eat fruits or most veggies.  He LOVED them.  I reduced the sugar, and left out the walnuts and coconut.  I did use muffin paper cups and just peeled it off before I gave him one for his breakfast every morning. It worked great!  I even hand-wrote this recipe into our family recipe box!

Pretty good but not a great muffin recipe.  The muffins taste good but are very dense and almost a little too moist.

Really good.  Seemed like alot of ingredients, but it wasn't hard to put together.  They were really moist the next day, so I warmed them in the oven for a while to dry them out.  Yum! Kid friendly too:)

These were delicious.  I didn't have any apple or pineapple so I substituted a can of chopped drained peaches.  I also grated a small zuchinni with the carrots.  Very nutritious and delicious.  My kids loved them.  What a way to sneak in their fruit and vegetables.

Very good muffins.  I was a little disappointed at first because the reminded me of dessert more than a breakfast muffin.  I wondered if I shouldn't add some cream cheese frosting to the top!  But, they grew on me.  I'll make them again.

These were good but I wouldn't say "delicious".  They did remind me a little of carrot cake but heavier.  They make a hearty breakfast muffin.  There are too many ingredients in the recipe to make it 5 star.
