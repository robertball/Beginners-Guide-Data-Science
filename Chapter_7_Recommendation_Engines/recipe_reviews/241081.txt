Really good comfort food!  And surprisingly easy.  I had never had sardines and was intimidated at first, but they are so good for you and the video made it look easy.  Made only half the recipe with generous amounts of bread crumbs and pine nuts and no saffron.  Other than that, I followed exactly and it was so worth it!  I think it helped to have all the ingredients in place. I made the bread crumbs while pulling everything else together, and then cleaned through the canned sardines while the onions/fennel cooked.  The textures and flavors had incredible depth.  The taste reminded me of the beach!

I'm an big fan of sardines and not a fan of pasta at all so this was interesting for me. I really enjoyed the dish. I bought the slightly more expensive ($2.50, instead of 99c) sardines in olive oil which turned out to be smaller, they had tony bones so they didn't need to be cleaned, and they didn't smell at all (unlike the stink of the 99c ones -which I'm totally used to-). I almost slipped the breadcrumbs for panko but I'm glad I didn't. They were great. I had saffron in the house so this dish was super cheap to make too, which I really love.

This dish is delicious. This has become my go-to comfort food. I keep it stocked. The pine nuts, raisins, flavorful sardines and the fennel with a little bit of heat is so good. I really love it. I have made it several times with different white wines and sardine brands. I prefer using a Chablis and Kroger brand sardines (boneless/skinless). I almost always make it with-out the breadcrumbs. I either forget or just plain old don't want to make the extra effort! Either way it's  fabulous. This dish and I have converted many onto the beauty of canned sardines. Thanks, Chef John!

I've made this dish before using other recipes and this is the least flavorful of them all. I've gone back to the other recipes to try and figure out where this one falls short.  The first thing I noticed is that the others use red onions, not white. The second is that because the fennel and onions cook at different rates, the best recipes cook them separately to avoid the onions browning before the fennel. Then they mix them together once cooked. Then there the proportions. I would double the fennel and the garlic. Add a good handful of chopped parsley. Use more anchovy. The sardines are very important.  Use a high quality brand packed with olive oil. And, lastly, I don't think bucatini are correct for this dish. I'd use spaghetti. They are thinner and absorb the flavors more evenly.

Cooked the recipe as is with the exception of leaving out the pine nuts.  I loved it. Everybody else wasn't a fan. They didn't care for the sardines.  Great recipe.

Let me start by saying, that I am a big fan of Chef John.  Most of his original recipes are outstanding, and he puts unique twists on common recipes that make them typically even better.  But this recipe was not one of those favorites.  Honestly, my dislike is probably more a matter of personal taste that anything specific about the recipe.  I was somewhat skeptical from the start, but was willing to give it a shot due to Chef John's track record of surprising me and winning me over in similar situations.  The various ingredients sounded like some interesting flavor combinations...but in the end it all just melded together into something that no one in the family cared for.

This was quite good! Did not use the anchovy filet and put in a little extra salt instead. Surprisingly the raisins went really good with the other flavours.

The video was very helpful, but I think I need to practice.  It was OK, but not great.

Fantastic.. I added 2 anchovy filets instead of one, used dark raisins instead of golden and also chopped them up.  Needed a little salt, but it really brought out the flavor in the pine nuts & fennel. I love this. I will definitely make it again.

So good - love the mix of flavors and textures. I like it with panko bread crumbs on top.

Yum Yum Yum!!! This is so good. My dad was from Sicily as well as my mothers parents and let me tell you this is very authentic and delicious. That first bite takes me to my ancestors home town of Mazara Del Vallo. Definitely not for everyone as my husband isn't a fan but for me it's molta buona!

I don't like anchovies or sardines, but my son asked for something with anchovies and I found this. I thought it turned out pretty good, not as fishy tasting as I was expecting. My son who loves fish thought it was amazing, and even my husband who hates fish managed to eat a bowl at dinner. All in all, a good dish.

Made it exactly as written.  Loved the pasta and seasonings.  Especially that hint of anchovies.  Love croutons especially home made.   For this they were a total waste of time and really interfered with the taste of the Bucatini pasta.  Also made it too dry.   Would recommend side of salad/garlic bread instead.

Thank you Chef John! I made it exactly as written. Seasoned to taste. It was lovely. Iâ€™ve never tried sardines, I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.
