I love this salad.  Didn't have some of the ingredients so I used can corn (drained) and pabalon pepper instead of jalapeno pepper and green onions.   I saute the pepper and onions with the corn and followed the recipe as is.  It was a big hit at my gathering.  It's a keeper.

I love this refreshing salad. Use freshly picked corn for best flavor.

Great recipe! Everyone loved it. Didn't have a shallot, so I used onion with a little bit of garlic powder.

Love this! Use grilled corn or frozen (un-thawed) corn in a cast iron skillet. Both are fantastic!! Most people have not tried this so it wall make you a culinary star!
