I had spinach and avocado I needed to use before they got old, so I did an ingredient search for ideas besides making a salad.  I keep frozen bananas on hand.  This was a good smoothie recipe.  Wishing I had coconut water to substitute/add to it though.  I added matcha powder.  Great snack/lunch recipe.

Smooth and creamy, the vanilla is definitely a must! I used almond milk since I didn't have regular milk. Next time I might use less honey and more spinach.

I tried this smoothie for the first time today and it was delicious!  I omitted the honey, which was not needed since the banana added enough sweetness to the smoothie!

I am NOT a fan of spinach but decided to try this recipe because I am working towards better nutrition/eating right, and I like using smoothies to get more fruits and veggies down each day. This recipe surprised me. I expected to not like it but, ended up loving it! I taste the avocado more than anything, and I could totally have one of these every day.

The only change I made was that I doubled every ingredient in the recipe to make enough for two people.

Great smoothie! Not too sweet, very creamy and delicious. I used skimmed milk, otherwise kept to the recipe as is. Will definitely make again!

I absolutely loved it.  I used a frozen banana, frozen spinach and almond milk instead of 1%, no ice cubes, I added water and it was still very creamy and delicious.  Next time I will not  use as much honey or no honey at all and will add some flax seeds or chia seeds.  Yum Yum!

So very delicious!!! I use Almond milk to make this dairy free- reducing the heaviness that cow's milk leaves in the gut.  My go-to morning smoothie.  Light and fresh, but plenty filling at the same time!!!

Loved it! Made a few changes from the original, I was out of milk so I used to a bit of yogurt and water.. and I didn't put any honey in because I don't like it. Still takes amazing, loved it!

It tastes better than I thought it would. It has the perfect amount of natural sweetness, and I was full by the time I drank half the glass. This will definitely be a staple breakfast drink for me.

Doubled the recipe and made as directed.  It was not sweet and the spinach flavor stood out.  It could be because the bananas I had were smaller than what the recipe needed?? Hard to say.  So, on the second round, I added a little more banana (about 1/2 a banana) and a additional honey (about 1 tsp) to make it sweeter.  It was better.  The flavors were a bit more "equal".  I could taste the spinach, avocado, and the banana.  My son liked that he was eating healthy and that it tastes good  :)

I'd give this refreshing drink 4.5 stars if I could. It's very good but not excellent as far as taste goes.

I made it with lactose free, low fat milk and it turned out well! Was looking for a way to increase my iron with food (possible TMI alert!) the iron in supplements stop me up, so I look for dietary sources. Smoothies are a great way to include more greens in my diet. It was a bit too sweet for me, so I’ll try half of the honey. Next time.

Used almond milk.  Added turmeric powder.  Tasty, but for me it was really only one serving or two very small servings.

Tastes really sweet and creamy! I added half a scoop of vanilla protein powder and that threw off the taste some so I don't recommend that. I did use almond milk though and it tasted fine!

I have this smoothie every morning for breakfast! It's so healthy and delicious (mild, creamy flavor that's slightly sweet).

I made this smoothes twice today. Once for myself and then again for my daughter. We both LOVED IT!!! I omitted the vanilla by accident the first time but it was still delicious!! I will be adding this recipe to my list of favorites ... maybe even my top five!! Thanks for sharing :-)
