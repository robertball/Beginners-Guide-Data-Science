Classic recipe!   Simple and pure flavors.   I did have to increase the baking time to about 90 minutes, tenting the dish lightly with foil the last 30 minutes.   The nice thing is, this needs to rest before serving so you can finish up the rest of the meal. 
I used a deep dish 8 x 8 pan.  If you don't have one that size use a standard 9 x 9 pan.  Comte cheese may be difficult to find, use Gruyère or another good melting cheese if Comte is not available.   Remember to salt each layer of potatoes.  Comfort food at its best.

Used a starchy potato cut 1/8 inch thick. Takes a good 90 minutes to cook.Used half and half instead of heavy cream. Used Swiss cheese and a bit of Provolone since I could not find Comté. Seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder (could not find my garlic salt). Make sure you season every layers.This is very close to what I grew up with in France. Merci Solange!

Very easy and tasty. I brought it to a Christmas party and it was a hit. I couldn't find Comte cheese at my local market and didn't have time to go searching for it, so substituted an aged Gruyere and it worked fine. Otherwise, I made it per the recipe directions. I may experiment with infusing the cream with herbs, adding caramelized onions to each layer, using half and half, or using other cheeses. This would be easy to make in individual ramekins or to double (or triple!).

Wonderful dish.  Researched and found that I could use Gruyère  or Provolone in place of the Comte, so used Provolone.  Excellent.

It was delicious!  I did make some changes, though.  I used Gruyere cheese.  I also used half milk and half cream.  I diced a little garlic and mixed it in.  I think next time I may cook it a tad longer, but it was delicious!

The Comte cheese is required. It formed up and was extremely rich and wonderful.
