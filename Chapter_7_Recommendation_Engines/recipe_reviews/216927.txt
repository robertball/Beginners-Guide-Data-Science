I didn't have cinnamon schnapps but I DID have Fireball cinnamon whisky--I used that instead. I can tell you that didn't make any difference in the flavor at all. CRAZY good. I've had one so far and I'm already itching to make another. WINNING cocktail. I love it!

I also didn't have cinnamon schnapps and I didn't think about Fireball (should have read the reviews)... anyways I substituted Torani's cinnamon syrup and it was excellent.
