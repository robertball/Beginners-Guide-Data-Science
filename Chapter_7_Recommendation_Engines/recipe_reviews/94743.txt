It's funny how the simplest recipes can produce the yummiest dishes.  I absolutely love chili dogs and this recipe is as simple as they come.  I did not add the onions because I was too lazy to chop them, but have had chili dogs in the past with chopped onions and loved it.

They are good but not the best chili dog I have had. I don't think I care much for hormel chili.

An excellent way to eat a hot dog. I make these all the time when I can't get to our famous "Jimmy's Hot Dogs" in town.

I've always had a weakness for hot dogs because they taste so good and are so easy to make for a snack. My wife doesn't like for me to have hot dogs so I sneak one every so often. This recipe had been one of my favorites for years.

Excellent. I can't believe that this is a recipe on here! I do have to say one thing, there is just something about a hot dog bought from a NY street vendor that is better than any hot dog than I can make at home. Thank you.

Surprised to see that this is a recipe but it is good nevertheless. Used homemade chili with the family omitting the onions.

This is a really good recipe. I like to use sweet onions for this one.  Great recipe!
