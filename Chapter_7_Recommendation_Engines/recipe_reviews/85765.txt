I was worried after reading the reviews that it would come out dry so I added a little bit of chicken broth to the chops before I put them in the oven.  And after adding marsala wine and finishing I made a gravy with the sauce.  It came out good.  I will be making it again :)

I used thin pork chops with bones and made the recipe in an electric skillet instead of the oven. I browned the chops at 450 degrees in butter & olive oil (I believe butter gives a better flavor to the sauce than plain olive oil). I only cooked them for another 15 minutes after they were browned and I lowered the temperature to 250 degrees. I served them with garlic mashed potatos. My family absolutely loved them!

I agree with the first reviewer!  This did not work AT ALL.  The meat ended up like overcooked stew meat - it was stringy and chewy.  With so many pork recipes on this site I suggest you just pass this one up.

This came out great.  I used wheat flour, garlic salt and pepper. Used fresh basil and about 1t. lemon juice.  I didn't put them in the oven. Browned them on the stove and then added the chopped fresh basil on top of every chop.  Put in the wine, lemon juice and a tiny bit of water so they wouldn't dry.  This came out delicious.

I've made this a few times. It's becoming part of our standard dinner menu.
I find that if I cover the pork chops before baking and leave covered after adding the Marsala wine the chops come out so tender we don't even use a knife.

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted Lawry's seasoning salt in place of the garlic salt.  These chops were moist and tender. They melted in our mouths.  We served these with mashed potatoes.  Good stuff!

I love this recipe!  For our anniversary last year I wanted to make something special.  I spent hours going through recipes to find that "perfect recipe".  This is it!  I used a pork tenderloin because I love it and I had some fresh mushrooms that I threw in when I added the marsala because I needed to use them up (and we love mushrooms).  It was perfect!  I have made this many times at the request of my family - they love it.  My mother-in-law liked it so much she asked ME for the recipe!  You've got to try it!

Outstanding flavor and so easy to make. Only difference is the baking time. Using a package of 3 store bought 1/2 inch pork chops I browned the pork chops and only baked them for 15 minutes @ 350 degrees and they were perfect. I would even think 45 min. for the 1 inch chops is too long.

These are very tasty!  Fresh tasting with the basil and marsala wine.  I followed the recipe, other than using a fresh basil paste other than dry.  I did change the cooking time to about 20 minutes and then another 15 with the marsala wine.  I used boneless chops.

This is great!  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and even my picky grandson loved it.  I made it again for a dinner party and used sliced pork tenderloin in place of the pork chops and  added 1/2 c. sliced fresh mushrooms the last 15 minutes.  Everyone loved it! It is a family favorite. Thanks!

I didn't have enough garlic salt, and substituted Lawry's low sodium season salt and I added 2 teaspoons black pepper. I browned the pork chops in an iron frying pan. I had fresh basil and sliced it thin. I added 1/2 pound of sliced Portobello mushrooms. I placed the iron cover on the pan instead of foil. I let the chops bake for 30 minutes poured the Marsala wine over it all, and bumped the oven temperature up to 450. I let the chops simmer for 10 minutes and removed the cover for 5-10 more minutes. The chops were done completely and were delicious.

Once the wine was added the nice crisp coating on the chops went soggy. Not a dish I'd make again.

This was a good recipe and  nice alternative to breaded pork chops. The wine kept the pork from drying out. If you are using smaller pork chops, adjust the cooking time.

The good thing about these chops is that they were tender. The bad thing was that they were bland. I may try them one more time, but I would most definitely marinate them first.

I used only ingredients from original recipe but altered the method. I did the flour and garlic shake and browned in my electric skillet adding salt and pepper on top. After browning I added marsala and sprinkled fresh basil generously over top, covered and simmered coveted 15 minutes - husband was over the moon.

I used butterflied pork chops, and had to substitute Italian seasoning instead of basil (out of basil). Turned out very juicy and tender didn’t even need a knife. Will make this again.

Delicious!  The chops were so tender and tasty.  I followed everything as written except I made a gravy at the end.  Served it with asparagus and pierogi's.  Hubby was happy and so was the cook!  Super easy to make.

Turned out great. Only thing I did different was I used white wine , half a cup beef broth and chopped up an onion and threw it in there at the beginning of the baking time. Only baked for 45 minutes. Came out tender and delicious.

I followed this recipe as directed with the exception of pork chop type. I used a country style pork rib or pork loin (trimmed) and with the thicker and fattier cut of pork it came out perfect. One of my favorite go to pork recipes!

These came out a little too bland for my tastes and the flour only made them soggy when they cooked. I had to increase the temp to 425 to get them crispy like I like.

I followed this recipe to the letter.  My fairly costly pork chops were as tough as old boots.  Even my longsuffering husband couldn't even cut them..............

This was a great recipe for using Marsala in a different way than the traditional pork Marsala.  It was very tasty.  The only change I made was to use fresh basil.  I will definitely make it again.

I didn't like this. I baked them in the oven for 15 minutes, then put the marsala wine in, then baked for another 15 minutes and the meat was very tough and had no taste to it. I wont be making this again.

I love this I did not bake it in the oven I cooked it on the stove I added butter also and chicken broth to cut into the wine taste. I added mushrooms. I cooked noodles with it using onions and chicken broth in the noodles. I will cook this again.

The only change I made was to bake the chops for only 30 minutes (instead of 45) before adding the wine, and they were fully cooked. I only used 2 pork chops since it's just my husband and me, but we both enjoyed them. They were juicy and tender, and overall very easy, if a little time-consuming.

We absolutely love this recipe, and have made it multiple times.  I stumbled upon it while searching for recipes to use up our abundance of freash basil, which is the only modification I made to the original recipe.  Be sure to use thick chops, and use good marsala wine!

I made this last night and it was super easy and delicious - everyone was raving.  I used red wine cooking sauce because i did not have marsala but it was still so delicious.  i recommend it.  i served it with garlic sauteed asparagus and it was a great meal
