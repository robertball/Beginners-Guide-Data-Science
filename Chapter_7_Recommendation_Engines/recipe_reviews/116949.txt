I didn't have Parsley on hand so I substituted a list of Italian spices that I can't even remember. But it was still wonderful! Everyone loved them :)

These were luscious. I increased the butter and sugar both to 1 Tbsp. but followed the measurements exactly otherwise. I used my bread machine and ended up with a beautiful, easy to work with dough. They went really well with the eggplant parm I served last night. Yum!

These were very good.  Made them for a Christmas get together. I used the bread machine on the dough cycle and it worked great. They were a little hard to cut once they were rolled up, so next time I will maybe use the dental floss trick to cut them like with cinnamon rolls.

Yummy, but not as soft as expected.  Coat the top with butter, or else it comes out very white.  A golden sheen would make it far more appealing.

Fantastic! Loved by adults and kids alike!  I did proof the yeast before mixing...recipe is a bit vague about this. Used Kithenaid Mixer with dough hook. Dough was a bit sticky, but I was wary of using too much flour (per others comments). Hand-kneaded additional flour into dough before initial rise but dough was still nice and light and easy to work with.  Only other change was placing cut dough in lighly oiled muffin tins for second rise and baking. Dough had excellent oven spring and the rolls finished looking almost like a spiraled ice cream cone (I wish I would've taken a picture, but they're all gone)!   The Italian filling was delicious (Would've maybe preferred using less minced garlic and more cheese finishing with some garlic butter after the rolls baked...but they were great as is!).  Dough seems like it would be very versatile with a variety of savory or sweet fillings!   Would highly recommend!

Anything that gets my two young boys to come running yelling, "What's that yummy smell?!!!" gets 5 stars in my book! This tasted as good as it smelled. I followed the recipe exactly except I used my bread machine for the dough cycle. The result...a delicate, garlic roll that is out-of-this-world. Thanks, this is definitely a keeper!

Halved the recipe and baked in a 9" round cake pan...subbed 1 tsp dried parsley for fresh and added 1 tsp Italian seasoning.  Probably went a little heavy on the parmesan...rolls were pretty good...dough was really sticky after the first rise, didn't rise much in the second rise...rolls were a touch undercooked in the center after 30 min.  Taste was good.  I mixed the melted butter, herbs, and parmesan together to form a paste (since I was worried about even distribution of the herbs), which I spread over the dough...next time, I'll probably mix the herbs in with the butter and brush that over the dough, then sprinkle the whole thing liberally with the cheese, as the paste was a bit hard to spread.

These are good, really good.  They were a perfect bread for our pasta dinner.  The dough was very easy to work with and roll out.  They rose beautifully and had great flavor.  No complaints here!

Just made these tonight for supper and they were delicious.  Followed the direction exactly as written except I brushed them with butter after 20 mins and than baked them and additional 5 mins.  They turned out a beautiful golden color and tasted amazing.  Husband and 6 year old daughter both said they will request these again.

These are excellent.  The outside is a little crispy, while the inside is soft and tender.  Even without the herb/butter mixture, this dough would make great rolls!

I like this recipe. The dough is easy to work with and the rolls come out nice and soft - and not too sweet which is a plus for me. :D The filling: I did use a bit less garlic than the recipe states and it was a bit bland. However, since I don't like too much garlic, next time I made them I used parmesan, mozzarella, oregano, parsley, basil, a bit of tomato paste, and some finely chopped onion (cooked first) & capsicum (bell pepper) to make "pizza pinwheels" and they were very well received. :D

MMMMM, yummy!  These turned out great and went really well with World's Best Lasagna from this site!  Used 4 (large) cloves of garlic and I didn't have bread flour so just used regular all purpose.  I would be curious to try with bread flour to see what type of difference it makes.  Keeper for sure!

Fantastic-the only thing I did different was to brush the rolls with a little butter about 5 minutes before they were done.  Super yummy and they're really rather fancy looking for not a whole lot of work.

Wow, the smells coming out of my oven!! These were moist and delicious. I did make a couple additions: After brushing the dough with butter, I spread some tomato sauce over top (not too much). I also added dried basil, some red pepper flakes, and diced up sun-dried tomatoes to the garlic filling. DEEELISH!

I did this in my bread machine. After taking out the dough was extremely sticky. I ended up adding another cup of flour. They were pretty good.

We thought these rolls were fantastic! The seasonings were great, gave it just enough of an Italian flare but none of the ingredients were overpowering. I am a bad roll cutter, I guess, because we got 15 rolls out of it. These were great and I will definitely make again because they were so easy to do, and I always have these ingredients on hand. Thank you for this wonderful recipe, Patricia!

I made the dough in a bread maker, then finished the recipe as written.  The dough was a little sticky, but I was able to work with it.  Since I was serving these to company, I cut back on the garlic.  If I were to make this recipe again, I think I would add some herbs and powdered garlic to the dough as well.

I'm going against the grain here, but these were not our favorite. I made these exactly as written... The dough was super sticky and hard to work with, the dough didn't rise much during the first or second rise and they did not have much color to them once they were baked. I also felt that the finished roll was a bit on the dry side. They tasted ok, but not enough that I would want to go through the hassle of making them again. Thanks anyway for sharing. :)

These are wonderful and very easy to throw together.  I need to work on reducing the amount of flour I use so as to produce a lighter roll, but these came out great nonetheless. I forgot to brush the dough with butter before sprinkling on the garlic mixture and instead, just mixed it all together and spread it on; sort of like making cinnamon buns.  The aroma, oh... the aroma!  A great accompaniment to an Italian meal.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

Oh my gosh these were fantastic! The dough was so easy to work with and when baked was so tender. This recipe was so easy I let my 2 1/2 year old help out with the measuring and he "helped" me knead the dough and sprinkle the cheese. This was a great recipe to start with and I did tinker with the ingredients my second time making these. Here's what I changed: the dough I didn't change a thing, it was perfect as is. The filling: I brushed the dough with more butter than called for and my garlic was chopped almost to a paste so I rubbed it onto the butter/dough using my fingers. I used the parsley (if you don't have fresh parsley dried works just fine) and oregano called for and also some dried basil and a bit of dried red pepper flakes for just a tiny bit of bite. I used more than the 1/4 C of parmesan called for probably more like 1/2 a cup. After rolling, slicing and letting rise I brushed them with butter so they didn't bake up so pale, mine baked for about 35min. They're great as is and even better with marinara sauce to dip into. Next time I may try using some homemade pesto and mozzarella/parmesan filling along with some red pepper flakes. Give this recipe a chance, you won't be disapointed.

Increasing the butter to 2 tablespoons makes the resulting buns much more tender and not as dry as some complained of. 1.5 teaspoons isn't enough to make a difference. My dough was quite sticky as reviewers also mentioned, but it's normal to have to adjust the flour a bit ~ I usually add in a tbs at a time until it feels just right, which was necessary in this case. I spread 1/4 cup of pizza sauce on the dough instead of softened butter to turn these into pizza buns. 6 cloves of garlic is excessive unless you are a garlic fanatic. I knew my kids would take issue with that amount so to keep it simple I just sprinkled on a little garlic powder instead. These ended up being very tender and flavorful buns. Turning them into pizza pinwheels made them a great (and popular!) snack and lunchbox item for my kids, so I think I'll be making these often.

The bread portion was good, it was easy to make, and it looked beautiful, but the garlic flavor was too strong. If I were to make this again (which I probably won't because I have better bread recipes) I would first roast the garlic cloves with the skin on in a pan to mellow the garlic flavor.

these worked well, I put them in the freezer for quick additions to the school lunch box. Added green pepper, mushrooms and garlic to the filling to bulk it up more.

These rolls were really good and very easy to make. Only change I would make would be to use garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. I think it would be more consistantly spread throughout the roll. The fresh garlic gave some bites that were very garlicky cause it was difficult to spread evenly.

These rolls are so good!!! I made them with all purpose flour instead of bread flour and they came out great. It took longer for them to rise than the recipe stated. My Italian husband and father-in-law are going to love them:-)

i just found this recipe tonite and i am going to print this out and make them, but after reading some of the reviews, i am thinking that i am going to use the QUICK AND EASY PIZZA CRUST dough recipe from this website, since the ingredient list for the dough part is so similar.  i will report back once i do that.

Very easy - I used the dough hook on my Kitchenaid instead of kneading.  The dough was soft and very pliable.  I used fresh oregano and dried parsley, and brushed with melted butter when they were done.  Everyone loved them!

These were very good.  Lots of garlic in these- I actually only used 5 cloves because I thought 6 would be too many for the smaller amount of dough.  The whole family loved these.  They were simple to make, too.  I used one cup of whole-wheat flour.  Great presentation!

Made these the other night to go with Baked Ziti. They were a hit! I proofed my yeast first then added the remaining ingredients. Mine only took 2 cups of flour and did not have the sticky problem others mentioned. Rose beautifully. I didn't melt the butter, just spread
soften butter onto dough and used dry parsley. Also topped with softened butter before baking and they browned nicely. Very nice soft roll but next time I think I'll use roasted garlic as the raw garlic was very strong. These have so much potential for using other fillings!

Great rolls - my family loved them!  Keep the dough light, I used a little too much flour the first time and they were pretty heavy.  I tried again and they were beautiful.
