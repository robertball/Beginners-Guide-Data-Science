I love finding new ways to prepare sweet potatoes that don't involve the usual sickly sweet versions that are covered in brown sugar or other sweetness.  These are really creamy and very tasty.  The only issue I had was that I had to add in some liquid, otherwise they were too thick and more of a gluey consistency because of the cheese.   Apparently the AR Editors think this makes 12 servings. It does not. I'd say 6-8 servings tops, unless you're planning on only giving your guests a couple bites each.  The recipe submitter does state 8 servings in her personal version of this recipe though, which is more realistic.  I will definitely make this again.  It's the type of side dish that will leave your guests wondering what that secret ingredient is in your potatoes! Thank you harmonyb for sharing your recipe!

This was my first ever attempt at mashed sweet potatoes and we really loved the recipe! I added the 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice as suggested and feel it was a great add. And while I appreciate working to get away from the super sweet versions of sweet potatoes, I felt it needed just a "little" more sweet so I added about a TBSP of brown sugar. Just enough to get that salty/sweet effect! May try stevia next time. Great side!

The first couple of times I made this, I followed the recipe exactly--came out creamy and delicious.  I made them earlier this week and used plain greek yogurt and some honey--sooo yummy!

These mashed sweet potatoes are AWESOME!!! I love that these potatoes aren't overly sweet. They're super creamy and were easy to make. These potatoes were my favorite part of dinner tonight.

Our family absolutely loved it. We did not cut nor peel our potatoes, and followed the recipe. They came out great for us, creamy and smooth.  Thanks for the suggestion.

To say this was painfully easy doesn't do it justice. Super simple, and tastes like to you in way more effort than you did!(Always a win in my book!)

Easy to make and has a great texture. I would have given it 5 stars but it was a bit bland until I added a little sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice as recommended by several other reviewers.

These were super creamy and delicious. I brought them to a holiday party and they were a huge hit especially since there is no sugar in them. Sweet potatoes are so healthy, it is really a shame that most recipes include sugar. I also added pumpkin pie spice as one reviewer suggested. Great recipe!

I have to agree with France C when it comes to making a more savory sweet potato dish. There are far too many sickie sweet versions. This is a good recipe to go with fried chicken. My husband really liked it. I cooked the potatoes in a bowl of water in the microwave on baked potato setting for 4 potatoes.they turned out perfectly moist and delicious. I will certainly make this recipe again.

Yummy! (I'm not one of those who likes sugary sweet potatoes anyway.) I did make it with cream cheese because I like it and that's what I had. Turned out plenty creamy just as is.

My kids and I tried it as is and found it really bland. We tried some with a touch of maple syrup and some with a bit of brown sugar. None of the three were good enough to make again. Not terrible, just....not delicious. I really wanted to love this recipe, I've been looking for a healthier sweet potato recipe.

OMG; I loved these.  I had a bunch of sweet potatoes and couldn't think of anything I wanted to do with them.  This recipe is simple but don't let that fool you.  The cream cheese really creates a great consistency without adding sweetness. The salt is important too because it makes it more like a hearty side dish than a sweet, Thanksgiving kinda thing.  I served this dish with grilled ham steak and sauteed squash.  Whole family loved the sweet potatoes this way!

I found this recipe and didn't have enough cream cheese to substitute for the cheese but added what I had left. I also added 2 tbsp of local honey and abt a tbsp of cinnamon as I made more than the 4 large taters. I added enough cinnamon to taste and that amt will vary based on each individual person. U can always add more once you put them on your plate.

These were so simple and easy and i agree with reviewers that they are sweet wothout being overly sweet like with marshmallows.   I only used half the cream cheese and it was still creamy and delicious.  My kids liked it too.  This will be my new go-to recipe for sweet potatoes.
