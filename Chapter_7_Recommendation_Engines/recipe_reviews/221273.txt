I modified the original recipe so it's not a 5-star but I loved the final product.  After reviewing other comments, I added 2 things - double (triple) the almond extract and 3-4 oz of almond paste.  My almond paste was frozen, so I shaved them and mixed them into the flour/butter/sugar mix.  Please note that almond paste has sugar so you may want to reduce the amount of sugar.   The scones were pretty  and yummy; apricot and almond are good comb together.

These were amazing!  Loved the texture and the flavor. I did add a little vanilla extract with the almond extract.  This was my first time using buttermik. Loved them!

It, surprisingly, didn't taste like apricots or almonds. I tried topping it with an apricot preserve & powdered sugar glaze. Didn't really fix the bland flavor but it helped with the boring appearance.

I like how simple this was for a quick scone in the morning. The flavor was a little bland so definitely needs more extract. I followed recipe and just added 1/4 tsp vanilla, but it really wasnâ€™t enough. Next time I will add more almond extract and maybe raisins or nuts.

I made this recipe to use left-over finely chopped dried apricots from a previous recipe (apricot/almond pierogi). Since my apricots were already mind with almonds, I didn't add almond extract. I believe the food processed apricots landed a better consistency in the scones; less large chewy bits if I had chopped the apricot by hand. I also added a bit of powered sugar glaze for a touch of dessert sweetness, because they turned out more "cakey" with less crumb than traditional scones.

Since I altered the recipe by reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup, due to adding almond paste that was suggested another reviewer, I gave the recipe 4 stars. Overall a good recipe, although the dough was very dry so I added more milk ( fat-free, not buttermilk). I also used white whole wheat flour (didn't have self-rising) and the scones turned out fine. Since we like apricots & the taste of almond I'll make this again...thanks for posting!
