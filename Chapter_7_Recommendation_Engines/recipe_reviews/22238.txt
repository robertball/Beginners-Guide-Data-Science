Absolutely wonderful. I scaled it back to 3 servings & also took others advice about microwaving the potatoes 1st, I did it for about 5 minutes. I also left the peel on & sliced them that way. I took another persons advice & mixed the potatoes, cheese & onions in a bowl, put them on the bottom, poured milk over top and put pats of butter in as well. Then placed the chops over all that. I also poured a little bit of milk over the chops. Halfway through, I pulled the chops off, stirred the potatoes & put the chops back on making sure I flipped them. I used a lot of pepper (I am not a big salt fan). I also noticed it a little "watery" after the hour, so I left them in there a bit longer & took some of the juices and put over the chops. I think I may have used a little too much butter, but my fiancee who is SOOOOOOOOO picky about food, really enjoyed this. He voluntarily said, "This is something you can make again, this is really good"

This was really easy and good! I changed things alittle by  slicing my potatoes and microwaving them for about 5 min. first, but I pretty much kept everything else the same. I salt/peppered and alittle garlic powder on the chops before baking and mixed the oinions, potatoes and cheese up in a bowl, then put in pan, covered with milk and butter and chops. This turned out really good, with just the right flavor and chops were pretty tender. Great recipe!

This turned out great!  I cut the recipe in half, since it was just for my husband and I.  I microwaved the sliced potatoes for 10 minutes before putting them in the oven.  I also added a pinch of garlic powder.  The key to keeping the pork chops juicy is to put them under the potatoes.

This recipe is delicious!!! I made this without the pork chops. I took other reviewers' advice and cut the potatoes very thin and then microwaved them for 10 mins. I also mixed the potatoes, onions and cheese in a bowl and then put it all in baking dish. After adding the milk and 3 pats of butter I then spirnkled it with garlic powder and a little salt. I covered with foil for the first forty minutes and after 1 hour it was perfect!! My whole family loved it! Will definitely make again. Thanks!

I agree that one hour was not enough time for the potatoes.  I covered the dish hoping that would help cook the potatoes a little longer, but I still ended cooking them an extra 30 minutes, uncovering in the last 20 minutes.  I don't know if it was the covering of the dish but the milk did not cook in completely and the potatoes were still pretty milky.  Overall good taste but I think I will add flour in with the potatoes next time to try to thicken it up.

okay, first off never use thick cut pork chops in this recipe! That was what I had, so I tried it. Took over 2 hours to cook. Good flavor, but the cheese looks very unappealing. Looked back over the other reviews and this seems to be a common problem. The flavor is good, but perhaps a little pan searing before cooking would be better.

This is quite good.  I did feel the whole thing needed to be covered with foil for the first half of the baking time so as to ensure the potatoes would cook throughout.  Also, next time, I will combine the potatoes, cheese and onions before placing chops on top.  I feel these ingredients would be mixed together more as true scalloped potatoes if prepared that way.  Very good 'comfort food'.  Thanks.

These were okay! I read the reviews before I made them and  everyone seemed to recommend microwaving potatoes before-hand. I microwaved my potatoes for 5 minutes before placing them in the baking dish, and they still turned out under-cooked. I would recommend microwaving the potatoes for maybe 10 minutes. I would mix the milk, onions, and potatoes  very well first and then put the cheese on top. Bake covered. The recipe doesn't specify, but that would be best. Good luck.

We've been making a dish like this for over 40 years.  Our 7 kids grew-up on it, and they made it
for their kids.  We always precook the potatoes about 10 minutes, season and brown the steaks or chops with a little salt & pepper, garlic powder and
a tad of ground savory.  We use a can of cream of mushroom and celery soup, and 2 cans of milk.  Mix the soup and milk together, then in the baking dish, mix the soup mixture with the potatoes.  Nesle the chops into the potatoes, so they are almost covered in the soup mix. Bake covered until the potatoes are tender and meat juices run clear.  That's our version of scalloped potatoes and pork chops!

My family absolutely LOVED this recipe, even my  picky 6 yr. and 2 yr. olds!! I agree that something needs to be changed to get the potatoes cooked through. I'm making this recipe again tonight and am going to attempt to first microwave the potatoes SLIGHTLY before adding them to the baking dish. Other than this it is an excellent excellent meal. Thanks Jocelyne!

I was excited to make this b/c of all the stuggles of others... a test of my culinary skills lol! Well it seemed that no one had much luck with the recipe as is I took reviewers advice along with my own thoughts. FIrst I thinly slices my potatos and nuked in milk for about 7 minutes. During that time I seasoned and seared my chops and put them on the bottem of my baking dish. I combined the the cheese and onions w/ potatoes and poured them on top, sprinkled with additional cheese. Baked covered for 30 minutes at 350, uncovered and was concerned about the potatoes. Baked it uncovered at 375 for the last 30. iT WAS GREAT! So I know we all haate some one who is totally changing the recipe and than rates it lol... but for so many issues some tweaking had to be done. 4 stars for the idea and the ingredients (which I used exacatly)!

This was so good! I scaled it down to 3 servings as it's just my fiancé and I and it was the perfect amount. Luckily I had read the reviews prior to making this so I microwaved my potatoes for ten minutes, then mixed the cheese and onion in with them before putting them in the baking dish. I added the milk, then put in only 1 tbsp margarine before placing the chops, which I seasoned, on top. Finally, i added a little bit more milk over the chops, covered with foil and popped in the oven. After 30 minutes, I removed the foil and left in for the remaining 30 minutes. The potatoes were perfect and the pork chops were great. My fiancé was very happy with this  dish and told me to add it to "the book"! Thank you so much for sharing!

This was so good! The pork chops were very tender and tasty. I left the dish in the oven about 15 minutes longer and the top was so nice and brown! The potatoes were very done and tender. The only thing I did differently was to add a little bit less milk and little bit more cheese. I also layed the cheese with the potatoes so that they were cheesier and made sure the top potatoes were well-covered with cheese too. It was GREAT!!! My husband who is a picky eater, ate most of the pork chops by himself. He sure was stuffed.

Great comfort food. As written it's a bit bland but a little Seasoning Salt, Garlic Powder, and Onion Powder fixes that. 

I have made this many times and it's perfect for a busy night.
Thanks for sharing.

Yummy comfort food. Definitely microwave the sliced potatoes before putting them in the oven, if you want them fully cooked.

Me nor my husband liked this very much, I found that the cheese stuck too much to the pork chops not leaving the potatos very cheesy. And my daughter who LOVES potatos wouldn't eat them... I don't think I'll be making it again, the potatos didn't turn out very "scalloped" to me. I might use this as an idea with my own scalloped potato recipe with pork chops in the future though.

Family loved this dish. I however cooked it on 375 degrees F instead of 350 for one hour. Potatoes were perfect, the meat fell off the bones, it was just delicious. Thanks for sharing.

Keeper! with mods.   I dropped the recipe to 3 servings and added a half cup sliced mushrooms.  I used thin cut pork chops but would use regular cut or thick cut and sear them off before putting them in the casserole.  My prep time, thanks to a cuisinart was only about 10 minutes

This recipe sounds delicious, but after cooking there was a layer of grease in the dish and the cheese didn't melt well. It wasn't a pretty dish.

This was just edible, the potatoes tasted decent but the milk curdled and separated so it looked unappealing. I sliced the potatoes with the thinnest blade on my mandoline and it still took an extra 30 minutes to cook. I removed the pork chops after 1 hour and they were already dry and overcooked. I like the idea of this recipe but I would not make it again without significant changes.

I made the mistake of not reading the reviews befor cooking and had to cook for an additional 35 min and the potatoes were still not quite done.  I took out of the oven only because the pork was going to be overcooked.  I ended up trying to put each serving of potatoes in the microwave for a couple of minutes before serving.  I was only glad that we weren't on a time constraint for dinner.  Also the sauce was very gloppy.  Probably won't be making again.

Yummy. I also used parmesan cheese. I sprinkled it over the potatoes/onions & then added the shredded cheddar on top. Thanks for the yummy, easy recipe!  :)

Love it!  It was quick and easy.  The entire thing could be done in one dish.  Great for  busy mom's with newborns.

Update: I tried this in my slow cooker and it turn out great!  The potatoes were done to perfection.

It was okay, mine was kindof lumpy. I think I put too much milk and not enough potatoes.  I am going to try this recipe again though..

This is a fantastic recipe. My husband found it  a little bland, but my three picky kids loved it and they all had second helpings! I made a few changes. I added a sliced onion and I put the pork chops under the potatoes, as suggested by some reviewers. They turned out very tender- practically falling apart. There was a little too much liquid that I had to siphon off, but that was no problem. This recipe is definitely going into regular rotation.

My family has made this for years. But instead of milk and butter, we use a white suace. It eliminates the watery texture.

These were good but I didn't like how the cheese just got lumpy. Didn't really get cheese with the potatoes, just got lumps of cheese here and there. I added garlic powder cause I thought it need a little more seasoning.

This was a great recipe. The only thing I changed was the way I seasoned the pork chops. I used Adobo, Sazon, black pepper, basil, seasoning salt,garlic powder and bread crumbs. It tasted great. I didnt use as much chesse, I only used 2 cups and it didnt make a difference. All the seasoning on the pork chops gave the potatoes more flavor as well.

I reduced this recipe to two servings.  Browned one side of the chops and put the brown side down on the potatoes.  I used one can of cream of mushroom soup and one half can of milk for the liquid.  Excellent!

This was fantastic! I used sweet potatoes and half & half in place of the milk. An hour was perfect for the sweet potatoes. This was soooo easy and looked beautiful. I will make this many, many more times.

I also thought this recipe was delicious! Instead of using one cup of milk though, I used a cup of broth (beef, I think). That way I had the moisture I needed, and a little more flavor. They turned out great! We didn't have left-overs!

I had tried this recipe exactly as it was written but like everyone else the pork chops dried out before the potatoes were done. So I decided to modify it a little. First I browned my chops and seasoned them with garlic and herb mrs. dash. Then I put a layer of potatoes in the bottom of my pan adding the pork chops on top. I sauteed my onions before mixing them in the milk and I used cream of chicken soup for a little extra flavoring. I also put a layer of mild cheddar cheese on top of the chops with a few dabs of butter. Then I put another layer of potatoes on top of that along with a little more butter. I poured the milk mixture over top of everything just enough to make sure that the potatoes are covered. I baked it on 350 for 90 minutes then added the layer of cheese on top and baked it for another 30 minutes. The chops were so tender they fell apart taking them out of the pan and the potatoes were tender and the sauce was thick and creamy. Everyone has different tastes when it comes to cooking but I fed 10 people with this and never got one complaint!! Happy cooking!!

The recipe turned out great. I let the porkchops marinate in a mix of seasonng for a few hours to make them tender. I also added more cheese to potatoes and let it cook longer because potatoes were not done.

I think it was a great and tasty dish. My pork chops were awsome, how ever for some reason with my potatoes cut as thin as I could get them they had to cook longer than 60 min. Other than that the kids and wife and I loved it.

This was a simple recipe and very tasty.  I just used 2 boxes of the southwestern potatoes.  I followed the box directions but cut the heat to 370 from 400 though still flipped and stirred the potatoes and chops after 30 minutes.

This was almost a complete flop!  Here is what I did first of all I added garlic and nutmeg to the potato and onions.  After one hour cook time at 350 everything was cooked but I use that term loosly so I dropped the oven down to 300 and cooked another HOUR!  But wow what a difference.  I think the recipe might cook properly in one hour as stated if it were covered.

This was ok but pretty bland for my taste.  I followed the recomendations and microwaved the potatoes before putting them in the oven but they were still undercooked.  I'm going to try it again and add some more spices and microwave the potatoes longer.

Great recipe and easy too!
One concern, there was a great deal of "water" in the pan after baking.  I realize this comes from the potatoes and the cheese but the liquid was significant.

This recipe was excellent!  My husband loved it!  I did microwave my potatoes for about 8 minutes prior to baking and this did help.  I also added a heaping teaspoon of cornstarch to my milk to help thicken it.  I then sprinkled garlic powder over the potatoes.  I seasoned my pork chops on both sides with garlic salt and black pepper!  It turned out delicious!  I will certainly make this again!  Thank you!

Sorry, but this was kind of bland.  I took others advice and put the pork chops on the bottom, so that part worked ok.  But it was just too greasy and bland for me.  I probably won't make this again.

Overall, this recipe was one of the best I have gotten off of this site.  The pork turned out so juicy and VERY tasty.  I made a few alterations:  I used red potatoes instead of regular and left the skins on, I added crisp bacon to the potatoes, I used sweet onions and sauteed them prior to adding them to the potatoes, and I mixed all of the potato ingredients together then poured the milk over them before adding the chops.  I, too, had some difficulty getting the potatoes softened.  I did microwave them for about 3 minutes after slicing them, but will microwave them longer next time.  I covered the entire dish for the first 30 minutes of baking time, but still had to add 15 minutes to my baking time to get the pork and potatoes cooked.  The potatoes still had a bit of a firmness to them, but it was not too bad.  YUM!

A nice change for pork chops.  However, my potatoes were sliced under 2 millimeters and baked over an hour and still were not completely done.

I followed the instructions and baked it for the alloted time, the pork chops were done , the potatoes ended up baking for another 60 minutes. The milk made the dish very soupy and the cheese disolved in the mess

I made this recipe according to the instructions and when I checked it after an hour, neither the chops nor the potatoes were cooked. The pork chops were still bleeding completely pink! I had to put it in for an extra half hour to get everything actually cooked.

The recipe doesn't specify the thickness of the pork chops the size of the potatoes or the onion. Since all those vary quite a lot, it would be important to mention if you were using a small or large onion, etc, or if your pork chops are only 1/2 inch or whatever.

It's not even particularly tasty because the only ingredients that have any flavour are the salt, pepper and onions.

My bf works nights and I time supper to send him off with a fresh hot meal and a good lunch. Tonight he's starting hungry and having ramen noodles for his lunch because supper wasn't ready. I'm very disappointed by this recipe.

I love this receipe. I use a mix of cheddar, harvarti, and jarlsberg cheeses. I also use cream instead of milk. Next time, however, I will microwave the potatoes as many have suggested. I have made this dish many times (without the chops) and always have crunchy potatoes.

Simple recipe but I did not read the reviews before making this....didn't microwave my potatoes or sear my thick cut pork chops. I did use diced fresh garlic, paprika, and onion powder to enhance the flavor ( I used fresh green onions for added color). Hopefully it turns out well!! Will let you know!!!

The potatoes took forever to cook.  I had to remove the meat not to over cook it.  I dislike having to check the oven and add time.  I ended up broiling the dish (w/o meat) for 5 mins.  It tasted fantastic though!

It was ok. The pork chop was delicious, but the potatoes were undercooked and a cheesy mess. I cooked the dish for an extra half hour too. I probably won't make this again.

This turned out amazing after several changes that i got from other reviews.  I put the potatoes in the microwave for 5 minutes after slicing.  Add the onions and milk to the potatoes after, in a separate bowl.  I seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, and dried minced garlic and pan seared them.  I put the chops on the bottom of the casserole dish and added the potato mixture on top.  Put spoonfuls of butter on top of the potatoes and topped the whole thing with cheese.  Covered the dish with foil for half an hour at 350.  Was still worried about the potatoes, so I stirred the potatoes and bumped the oven to 375.  Back in for half an hour, uncovered.  Everything came out perfect.

I found that like many others on this site this recipe definately needs a lot of tweeking. The sauce is greasy and clumpy and definately takes more than 30 minutes to cook. I think I will keep looking for another recipe.

I'm sure the recipe would have turned out perfectly if I had made it to the written proportions, but I had to make do with what we had. It still turned out nice but a bit too liquidy for our tastes. I used 5 medium potatoes sliced, and had about 3/4 lb pork loin that I stripped up. I only used 2 cups of cheese and 1/2 cup milk. It seems I needed either more cheese or less milk. I also microwaved the potatoes once sliced for about 8-10 minutes before assembling. Everything cooked up well in the hour suggested. The meat was tender though it would have been better to have more. No complaints from my husband tho. I will most likely make it again with the chops.

Good, but I think it needs more cheese.  Like other reviewers I cooked the potatoes in the microwave first (5 whole white potatoes at 8 minutes--almost fully cooked).  I found mixing the ingredients ahead of time sort of difficult, as the cheese clumped into an unwieldly mess.  Next time I won't pre-mix.  I used boneless small pork chops which got too dry--I think--although everyone liked them.   I baked in a convection oven at 350 for about 35 minutes. My kids refuse to eat onion, so I substituted with onion flakes and I added garlic powder to the potatoe mix.  I topped the pork chops with steak seasoning. In the future, I'll add a bit of flour like others suggested, add more cheese, bake for less time, and only salt rather than steak season the pork chops.  Other thoughts, I'm at about 6000 feet above sea-level.  Thanks for the recipe!!  We'll definitely make it again (there are few recipes that everyone in the family likes!)

I followed others' advice and par cooked the potatoes in the microwave first, then mixed the potatoes with the onions, cheese and milk with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I had thick cut pork chops so I sauteed them first in olive oil and garlic and added on top of the potato mixture. Everything cooked fine in an hour, my husband LOVED it, but my daughters and I didn't like the potatoes very much. There were way too many onions and its too oily from all the cheese. I liked how tender the pork chops came out though, so if  tried this one again, I would use only half an onion and less cheese just sprinkled on top of the potatoes.

great recipe, easy and pretty quick.  I microwaved the potatoes for just under 10 minutes, but still had to increase the baking time by about 30 minutes to finish the potatoes.  I also used thick cut chops and split them in half.

I wish I had read the reviews of this before I put it in the oven on a night when dinner absolutely had to be ready at a specific time. There was absolutely no way that the potatoes were even close to being cooked in an hour and while others mentioned nuking the potatoes in the microwave first, we don't own a microwave, so boiling the potatoes and then slicing them could have worked. The pork was done after an hour and I finished cooking the potatoes today in my slow cooker on high for 4 hours.  The finished potatoes were a little weird...the sauce never really came together, I stirred several times but the finished dish was weird and separated.  I think making a white sauce would have been helpful instead of just using milk.  All that being said, my husband did say the potatoes were good and he won't mince words if he doesn't like something.

I chose to sear the pork chop on the stove with a little olive oil and garlic salt before adding them to the dish. This helps keep the pork tender and juicy. I did follow the advice of microwaving the potatoes and am glad I did. Enjoy!

ugh... I sliced my potatoes paper thin and even after two hours they were crunchy... The cheese / milk mixture was a coagulated goo... I only gave this two stars because the pork chops were fine.  My family begged me to never torture them with this one again... NO PROBLEM!

I have to agree that it was kind of bland.  The ingredients separated and the potatoes took a while longer to bake than expected.  Decent dish but would not make again.

We ate it, but it was nothing special.  Kind of bland.  The ingredients did separate, which made my husband dislike it to begin with.  He doesn't like his scallop potatoes saucy.  The pork chops were very bland.  Next time I will make my scallop potatoes, and season the meat differently.  I had to keep in oven way too long to get the potatoes done.  I can't even say that it was my doing, because I did follow the recipe.

My boyfriend loves it! The wet ingredients do tend to separate (curdled looking and greasy but it tastes fine). I now use cream and only add the cheese on top which looks and tastes nicer.

I wish I would've seared the chops first.  This wasn't a "pretty" dish.  The cheese didn't blend together to make a sauce...it was clumpy.  It tasted pretty good.  I will try it again and make a few modifications.

This was pretty good - we especially liked the potatoes but the pork was a bit bland even after seasoning with s&p and garlicpowder and searing before baking. I put the chops under the potatoes and microwaved the potatoes about 10min before baking. They were perfectly cooked - you have to cut them thin!  Again, good but not my favorite.

My Husband loved this!  I made it with 2 very large pork steaks, and added Lowerys seasoned salt and Lawerys garlic salt and lots of pepper and about 1/2 stick of butter,  it is a great meal served with early peas!

I always do the potatoes and pork seperate, This turned out very good. I used boneless pork chops, and about a cup and a half of cheese. Will make again.

This recipe is so good!  My 1 year old ate every bite and wanted more.  I did take the advice of others and used foil to line the pan.  I also boiled my potatoes until almost soft before putting them in the pan.  Next time I will put the chops on the bottom so my potatoes will be golden brown with all the cheese on top...YUMMY!!  These pork chops were still so tender!!  I will use this one again..Thank you!

I've made this recipe two times now and I've made a few changes each time.  I think I perfected it last night.  Instead of just adding the 2 1/2 cups of cheddar cheese, I used about 1 1/2 cups of cheddar, 1 1/2 cups of grated parm., and 1 cup of bleu cheese.  I also added fresh chives, probably 1-2 tablespoons.  I also add another 1/2 cup of milk.  It just makes the potatoes that much better.  My husband says if we ever start a restaurant, that we'd have to serve this!

This was really good, but I think next time I will do like the others and mix the potatoes, onions & cheese or maybe layer the cheese & potatoes in the pan before adding the chops.  Even so this was wonderful and very filling - I will definitely be making this dish again!

I really like this recipe because it is relatively easy to make and has really good flavor! The potatoes really don't cook in the time the recipe calls for and the first time I made this I tried to follow other people's advice about first cooking them in the microwave for ten minutes but it still didn't seem to be enough so this time I tried boiling the scalloped potatoes first and that was perfect! Just be careful not to over boil! :) also wanted to add that I left out the margarine this time because the cheese makes it "juicy" enough as it is. Pork chops come out very tender and delicious! I used the skinny ones and seasoned them with seasoning salt and pepper. Enjoy!!!

Doubled the amount of potatoes, sliced really thin and microwaved in 1 cup of milk for 15 minutes.  Only used 1/2 amount of cheese mixed with rest of milk and potatoes to melt before pouring over thin pork chops seasoned with salt and pepper. Totally eliminated butter and onions.  Next time I will grate my own cheese.  Pork chops were extremely tender.

My family absolutely loved this recipe!  I followed some of the tips left by other reviews, and cooked the potatoes and milk in the microwave for about 10 minutes before adding anything else and baking.  This is our new fave!

This was a great recipe! I microwaved my potatoes and they still weren't done but just cooked them longer.  Next time I will add the cheese later as it browned too much and made it pretty oily.  But the flavor was wonderful and my husband loved it!!   Thank you!!

This was really good. I used pork chops with the bone in them. I seasoned them with basil, garlic powder, salt, pepper and sazone. I did not have any onions on hand so I used onion powder for the potatos. They were very good. Thank you for the recipe.

When done, the potatoes were extremely greasy and the pork chops were flavorless.  A real waste of time and effort.

Followed directions to the letter, but potatoes did not cook all the way.  It came out way to "watery" which made the cheese come out a little unappetizing looking.  The pork was too dry for my liking.  Sorry, but I can't say that I'll be trying this one again.

I used red potatoes and cooked them a bit in the microwave before assembling the recipe as recommended by others. The potato part of this was really delicious but the pork chops were a bit blah.

I have made this for years and it is very good, but not quick.  Hint:  If you are REALLY in a hurry, it works just as well using a boxed scalloped or au gratin potato mix cooked in a skillet on top of the stove.

This was good.  Very hearty!  I have picky eaters at home and they all enjoyed it.  I would put it under the category of "comfort food".

I cooked this recipe 25 minutes longer than it called for and the potatoes were still slightly raw. The pork turned out very tasty and the flavor of the potatos was nice even if they hadn't finished cooking.

While this was very tasty, I can't rate it very highly for visuals. I found the butter to be unecessary, and it added a greasy texture to the entire dish. Also, while the cheese and milk mixture made a delicious combination, the milk appeared curdled; not the most appetizing-looking meal I've ever put on the table. Still, it's the taste that counts most, and this recipe had that going for it.
