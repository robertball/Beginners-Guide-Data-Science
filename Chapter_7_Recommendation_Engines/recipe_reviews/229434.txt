Made this recipe, but added some finely chopped celery to the onions and topped with buttered panko breadcrumbs.

I did not have all the ingredients, so I used regular rice, fresh broccoli which I chopped after cooking, and 1 cup shredded cheddar. I also took someone else's advice and used crushed ritz crackers instead of the bread cubes. Everyone really liked it. Very yummy.

I have been making this recipe for years, and it is always a hit! I don't use the bread cubes, but that is the only thing I do differently. This is so simple, yet comforting...a real winner~YUM! :)

The first time I made this dish, according to the provided information  (i.e. the recipe) it was delicious. Since that first encounter with this dish, 25 years ago, I never had it again  - imagine that,  25 years. I was so grateful to stumble upon a simple and easy recipe to create this awesome side dish. I've always loved broccoli, cheese, and rice separately, so why not combine them altogether and create a sensation dish. The only change that I have made to the recipe originally posted was instead of using cheese dip; namely  Cheese Whiz, I use the Tostadas brand of cheese dip - in particular the jalapeño cheddar.  It's great, and it adds a little and subtle kick to the dish.

I find the cheese dip to be bland so I added a 2 tablespoons of spicy, course-ground brown mustard which helped. Next time I'll use sharp cheddar. I also used cream of celery soup. It was good but not like I remember it from my childhood.

I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom because I don't like mushrooms. I used 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and didn 't put the buttered bread cubes on top. Will make it again this same way

I made this and we enjoyed it.  I had  roasted garlic cream of mushroom on hand so substituted that.  I also substituted cheddar cheese. This was a great dish that my son loved! We will definitely make this again.

It seemed a little dry and the Panko breadcrumbs weren’t a good add. I would probably add more broth to the dish. Will try again with changes.

Dinner for 10 and this was the perfect side dish. The first dish to be emptied and quickly. So simple to make and inexpensive. Another winning dish from AllRecipes.
