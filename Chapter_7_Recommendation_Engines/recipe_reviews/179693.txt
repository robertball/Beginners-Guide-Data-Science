This was an amazing dessert!  My parents watched me make and they were skeptical because I'm not known as the chef of house.  But, at our family's Thanksgiving party everybody LOVED it!  It was the favorite on the table and it was so easy to make! 
I couldn't find those Christie's cookies so I used ginger snaps instead which turned out to combine perfectly with the walnuts and maple syrup. It was an amazing dessert, super delicious, thank you so much!

This recipe was easy to follow and turned out wonderful! My husband even liked it better than store bought. It was the first cheesecake I have ever made and I am glad I chose this recipe.

This is the easies cheesecake I ever made.  Like the others, I could not find the Maple cookies and used graham crackers instead. This was a big hit at the neighbors dinner party.

This recipe is a keeper.  Both my husband and I loved it. I used a high quality Vermont maple syrup and made a graham cracker crust which I baked for 10 minutes before adding the filling.      I used a water bath and baked it at 350ยบ for 45 minutes, then left it in the oven for an hour with the oven door cracked open.  It was perfect, nice and creamy.    Really, really nice cheesecake.

The texture of this cheesecake was perfect and was super easy to make, but it was missing something for me...not sweet enough maybe or missing some flavor...not sure, just couldn't put my finger on it.  I used ginger snap cookies for the crust as suggested by other reviewers and used the whipped cream cheese in place of the brick.

RAVE reviews!  I used Ginger Snaps for the crust as suggested in another review since I couldn't find maple cookies.  Turned out wonderful.  Super simple to make.

Turned out great!  Not too sweet!  I used 1 cup of graham cracker crumbs in place of the crushed cookies.

I made this cheesecake and it was ok... I was disappointed in the flavor.  The cake itself tasted good, just like regular cheesecake, but didn't taste like maple at all.  I didn't like the crust, too greasy and again, couldn't taste the maple flavor at all, the walnuts took over the flavor.  Maybe next time, if I ever make it again, because 3 of my 4 children actually liked this cake - probably because they weren't expecting this maple flavor like me, I will put more maple syrup in the cheesecake batter, no walnuts and less butter in the crust.

Made it exactly as per recipe and it was awesome.  I used very dark maple syrup a friend makes and that added lots of flavour.  I might bake it 5 minutes less next time.  I will be making this again.
