Very good recipe, definitely worth the time taken to prepare the broth... However one tip to make it even healthier: prepare the broth the day before, and leave it over night on the refrigerator. Once it cools down all the fat from them meat will be on the top, so you just have to skim it out, before warming it again to before adding the toppings.

i haven't actually made this according to this recipe yet but my mum's been making it for years and it's great to see a recipe that actually tells you to make the broth, cause this recipe is all about the broth! it's not key to use ox-tali or beef knuckle, just as long as you have enough large beef bones. it's best to actually 'clean' the bones before you cook- either some vinegar or whisky with lots of hot water-gives a cleaner taste and a clearer broth. i also always grill the onion, anise, cinnamon, ginger and peppercorns first and place all in cheese cloth bag. finally a tip for preparing, to cook noodles place soaked noodles in a sieve and place in boiling water(stir if needed) til the noodles are just soft, make one bowl at a time and serve steaming hot. enjoy!

Fantastic authentic pho bo recipe. My husband and I spent a whole month in Vietnam and this tastes perfect.  I halved the water amount to 2 gallons. I only used beef neck bones for a nice clear broth. I didn't use the radish.  In cheese cloth I used Anise seed, ground cinnamon, ground peppercorns, and a lot more cloves. I about doubled all the spices as I'm used to very aromatic pho. I added the tablespoon of fish sauce and sugar and simmered for the 6 hours. Paper thin sirloin was great! Loaded it with only cilantro and green onions and noodles just like in Hanoi and this dish was delish! Thank you for such a great recipe to play with!

This was my first time making pho and it was really good! BUTTTT I have some recommendations that I think will make a load of difference. My soup didn't really have the "pho" flavor entirely, so I had put some "pho beef flavor" bullions into my pho. I just added one cube at a time to taste. That really brought out the pho flavor. (and these cubes are super cheap! 79 cents :) !!!) I also took my onions, cut them in half, wrapped them in foil, and put it on the stove to cook them a bit. Also, I ended up finding a packet of "pho seasoning" that had star anise, cinnamon, cloves, and other ingredients in there so I got that instead. It came with a seasoning bag too that you can throw right into the soup base. I also used an extra slice of ginger. Also, I could not find beef knuckle, so a nice vietnamese lady told me to get beef bones instead and it worked out great. Oh and you MUST get the fresh noodles that come in the regridgerator section, this will make a HUGE difference in the taste of your noodles. I originally bought the dried flat pho noodles and I did not like them at all. My boyfriend (who is vietnamese) told me to get the fresh ones from the cold section and those were like the ones you get from the store. =) Hope my review helps some folks! =)

I normally don't make pho with 'radish' in them, so I gave this recipe a try.  The radish gave a taste other than pho.  This is close to authethic but leave the radish out.

I loved this Pho recipe! It turned out wonderfully, it actually tasted like pho!  I have made pho before (even using the predone cube sachets and beef broth to try to spice it up) and it has turned out miserable and tasteless.  But this recipe tasted almost identical to my fave pho restraunt (I am proud of myself!).  

I ommitted the daikon since I didn't have it on hand and I didn't use the oxtail.  I used some large meaty bones from the butcher at the local asian market and they were perfect for a half sized recipe.  I followed everything else to a "T" and it was well worth the 6 1/2 hours it took the broth to cook and it smelled wonderful (after I added the spices).  Even my picky roommate loved it! (and he hates my cooking most of the time! :P)

I'm pretty new to pho and don't pretend to be an expert on the subject, but of the few recipes for pho on allrecipes, this is the most authentic imo. Good pho is all about the broth - it should be rich but light, meaty but fragrant; crumbling a beef bouillon cube into some hot water and tossing in a sliced onion isn't going to cut it! 

Personally, I omit the oxtail because they're just too expensive, and I use whatever meaty beef bones I can get at the store. Like any good stock, the key is simmering it slowly for as long as you can - I aim for 3 or 4 hours. I personally don't make it with daikon, but I don't think regular radish would be a bad substitute. You can't beat pho from a genuine Vietnamese restaurant,  but this is a decent recipe to satisfy a craving! Thanks!

I like vietnam pho but I don't like MSG taste. This is healty and wonderful recipe. I often use this recipe.  I just substitute beef brisket for beef knuckle and beef oxtail. Brisket is easy to buy and exellent taste for soup.

I've made this recipe twice.  Two ounces of star anise pods is a lot...I'm going to back off on those just a touch.  But other than that, this is a great, authentic recipe.  Knowing a few basic broth-making tips is key to this traditional soup:  1) be vigilant about skimming the scum off the top of the broth, and 2) always simmer, never boil the broth or the "scum" will be broken down and churned back into the broth making it gray instead of clear.

This had great flavor, I will definitely make it again. I made a few changes to the recipe. Per other reviews, I used lemongrass instead of daikon radish. I also used beef soup bones instead of beef knuckle, as I was unable to find any. I wanted to leave it in the crock pot all day, so I started the soup bones the night before on low, then added the oxtail and flavor ingredients in the morning. I cranked it up to high to get it up to the recommended crock pot temperature, then let it simmer on low all day. Finally, to remove most of the fat, I ladled the end product into a ziplock gallon bag and let the fat float to the surface, then cut away a small piece of the corner to drain out the broth. I pinched off the stream before the fat came through for a nice, lean broth (do this step in batches).

My daughter dated a man from Vietnam and he introduced me to pho.  I loved the pho his mother made and the pho we ordered at restaurants.  I tried this recipe and it was great but I have to admit that I like it better when someone else makes it.  I probably won't make it again but it was fun to try.

Great Pho.  I made it per recipe and it was very good.  I will make two changes to adjust to my own taste.  I would cut the star anise pods by half and only add 1.5 gallons of water.  I had to simmer it an additional 2-3 hours to reduce the volume to up the beef flavor.  I believe it will be resturant quality with these adjustments.  I would serve it to dinner guest any time.

This pho rivals what I've had in some relatively expensive restaurants. I couldn't get my hands on oxtails or beef knuckle, so I used beef shank. I also had to omit the radish because I couldn't find it. Those changes were very minor, and did not affect the outcome. I also suggest making the broth a day ahead and skimming the fat off the top prior to reheating.

Best recipe for pho I've ever tried. I omit the daikon, but this broth is Excellent! TIP for slicing the beef:  Put it in the freezer until it's partially frozen (or thaw it until it's still partly frozen). This allows you to slice it very thinly because it's firmer and sturdier.

I didn't have six hours but knew I wanted the authentic taste Therefore I followed the recipe ingredients and made a rush broth boiling the fatty side of a leftover roast and a few meat chunks of beef for flavour. The roast was really rare and it is also what I cut up thin for the soup. After boiling the meat for 15 minutes I added the oher broth ingredients including the onion and ginger,  I omited the cinnamon stick and anise pods as I was out and instead sprinkled in a pinch or two little golden dragon chinese five spice which consists of fennel, anise seed, ginger, clove, cinnamon. In the end I drained the broth and added thinly slices onion cut in rings the rare roast and noodles. It did the trick and in less then 40 minutes we were eating very authentic Beef pho. Given the short cut my husband and I both agreed it was a lot like the real thing.

OMG crazy awesome!  The whole family swarmed my kitchen for seconds, including my picky 9 yr old son but there was not enough broth.  There's only 2 things I will change next time, triple the spices & double the broth so we can have more.  Will definately make again!

This was extremely good! I made a whole Pho Platter and my family (even less adventurous eaters) loved it. I served it with a side of Bok Choy, sauteed in sesame oil and garlic and it was delicious.

Pho is the best! I used shrimp instead of meat, and used mung bean noodles for a change. Thin egg noodles are also really good because they don't get soggy! I didn't have the time to make the broth from scratch, so I used canned beef broth but still boiled everything else for an hour.  It tasted almost as good as the Pho place I use to work at :)

Amazing recipe.  I didn't change anything.  My husband and I eat pho often and this was every bit as good as the restaurant.  Highly recommend it worth the time it takes to make the broth.

This was great soup! I do think that 2 oz. of star anise is a misprint though because that was a huge amount, like 40 or so of them.  I talked to someone from Vietnam who makes Pho all the time and she said that she only adds 2 star anise.  Needless to say, I made it with the whole 2 oz and that flavor was a little overwhelming but still great.  The next time I made it, I made it with chicken instead of beef and only 2 star anise and it was even better!  I will make this often.

This recipe was really good but I alternated it. Oxtail are too expensive to use to make pho.  Believe me, pho restaurants do not use oxtails.  You don't have to use oxtail.  If you have access to an Asian store, use pho packets that already have the spices and you don't have to worry about measuring everything. Another tip, add carrots to ame the soup sweeter and also sugar to taste.  If you want thin cuts of meat, you can freeze the who piece first and then slice it.

Thank you for posting this recipe!  I always told my mother that I was born in the wrong part of the world (Mexico)...I was meant to be Vietnamese :0) or just Asian for that matter.  I drive and drive across town to have beef pho and just absolutely love it and wished I knew how to make it.  I made this exactly as you said...with the exception of the Daikon Radishes (could not find them so I threw in some red ones)  but anyway...it was FANTASTIC!!!  thanks a bunch!

I have never taken the time to make Pho the "real" way, but decided to try this one yesterday on a day off. I have a great recipe from Women's Health that I make all the time and only takes 30-45 min. My husband and I refer to it as "faux Pho". However, this one blew it out of the water. It's so worth the time, and truly not that difficult. The depth of rich flavor that comes from cooking down the bones and spices all day is incredible! I had no problem finding beef knuckle for dirt cheap at my market, thought eliminated the ox tail, as other reviews said its not necessary. Instead of sirloin I used skirt steak, I added soy sauce for salt, and reserved some Daikon and julienned it to use as a garnish. Not sure that I can go back to my quickie version now, may have to come up with some way of doing this in the crockpot for work nights!

WOW! Love it! I did use the cinnamon stick I bought from the Asian market. It was rather large (4-6 inches long, 1 inch in diameter) but it didn't overpower the broth like I expected. Also, I added 2 packs of meatballs because I love beef and meatball pho. Wonderful for such a cold, wet, and windy day. ***UPDATE*** The second time I made this, I added 3 sliced lemongrass and cooked for 10 hrs. It tasted great!

I just love pho and this is a great recipe with just a few alterations. I actually totally emitted the daikon. I added a whole white onion and I charred both the onion and the ginger root before adding to the broth. Instead of sugar I use rock sugar candy that I get from the local asian grocery store. I usually skim the fat off at least 2 times. My family loves this pho and I make it on a regular basis.

Almost as good as I've had on the streets in Hanoi and Saigon.  I roast my herbs in a dry wok before adding a home-made beef stock that cooks for 5+ hours, slowly.  Taste at the end to add more fish sauce if needed

Never heard of putting daikon radish in Pho, other than that OK, someone also suggested lemon grass, never heard of that in Pho also.

I followed the recipe as instructed, but  I don't think I will make this again because the ingredients cost about $40 and it was too much effort. I thought it was okay; I would rather go to my favorite restaurant to be fully satisfied.  This recipe is definitely not for me.

This is a great basic recipe for pho; however, you don't have to get the expensive stuff in terms of bones!  I just go to the butcher at the grocery store and they cut up whatever bones they have.  I've made it this way multiple times, and it turns out great!  Also, if you lightly toast the spices before putting them in the bag, the soup will be much more aromatic.

I followed this recipe to the T, and I think this recipe is just average.  I honestly will not try to cook this again because its too much work for a noodle soup.  Pho is very inexpensive where I live, so I think i will just continue to patronize our favorite pho place.

I must have done something wrong as mine came out really bad.  I followed the recipe, but our broth had no flavor.  I ended up adding some beef soup base, which made it taste better.  We love pho and I wanted to surprise my kids.  This ended up to be a very expensive dinner that no one enjoyed.   Next time we will stick to our local pho sho.  Thanks for the recipe-just did not seem to work for me.  I still can not figure out what I did wrong as this recipe has such high ratings.

This is a great, authentic recipe that I will make again and again. I only had about 1/2 oz. of star anise on hand but it still turned out great. I did find that for my taste the broth needed some additional fish sauce and salt added with the other condiments.

YUM !
I love and eat pho all the time.
This is alot of work but so worth it and is very very good for homecooked pho broth !
Every ingredient mentioned in the recipe is a must for the authenicity.... the daikon, fish sauce, down to the garnishes of Thai sweet basil ( not the Italian kind ) Sriracha sauce etc...
I am telling you. The soup is so fragrant the smell will flow all through your house...
Truely the ONLY pho recipe on this website that is worth your tastebuds.
***No lemongrass or garlic in pho !

I love this recipe! A few added ingredients to make it better: Boil some beef tendons and beef tripes.  You want to boil the beef tendons until it becomes very soft.  It takes at least 6-8 hours but it is absolutely worth it.  My husband loves the beef tendons and always request extras when I make pho for us.  The beef tripe can be boil with the soup.  Plus, I usually substitute the beef oxtails and sirloin with beef ribs!  The beef rib bones gives great flavors as well, if not more!  I usually also throw in some peeled shrimps for more flavoring.  As you can see, I love a lot of meat in my soup!

YUM!  Was so happy with my first attempt at making pho... I even daresay that I liked this better than my favorite local Vietnamese restaurant's pho.  The nice thing about this being from scratch, instead of using the premade spice packets is that you can adjust amounts of each spice to your own tastes.  From past experience with recipes for other types of Asian noodle soups, our family personally isn't big on too much star anise, so for this first time I only used a few pods (plus, it was all I had left on hand and I didn't have time to make it to my local grocer that'd have it in stock).  Used a little more ginger than called for and only made it for 1 gallon since I didn't want to make too much this first time around.  I also didn't use daikon because I didn't have it on hand.  Used grass-fed, pasture-raised beef knuckle from a local farm, no oxtail.  Boiled on high for 15 minutes, then drained and rinsed to get rid of all the impurities (very little given the type of beef used).  Then proceeded to simmer the stock on low for the given amount of time.  

I added some beef tendon and beefballs at the very end, since my kids all like it.  For our family of 5 it was perfect and everyone loved it.  My 21 m/o gobbled it all up.  Flavor was awesome.  Only change I'd make is I'd add a *little* bit more star anise, but that's it.  This recipe's a keeper!!  Can't wait to make it again!  And bonus, my home smelled of that wonderful pho aroma for the rest of the evening!

this recipe turned out pretty well but a few things had to be done different. my mother inlaw is from laos and I love her pho, but wanted to check if there were variations that sounded yummy.  The daikon is not needed and gives it a completely different flavor.  Pho seasoning packets from any asian store work wonders and is much cheaper!  Also putting the fish sauce and sugar in while cooking is not needed and actually the pho will taste much better if sugar and fish sauce are put in with the sriracha, garlic, bean sprouts ect. Another thing that can be added to pho with beef is tripe, it turns out very good.

Takes a while to make, but the wait is definitely well worth it. This tastes just like the pho at the  Vietnamese place on our street, but much better! I also grated extra white radish for the top of the soup -some went in and i cooked with the noodles, the ones on the top were raw-. Definitely making this one again.

Hit the spot! This pho recipe is soooo good. I couldn't find beef knuckle or oxtail so I used meaty shin pieces but everything else was exactly the same as the recipe. It turned out wonderfully. I can't wait to make this again- it was a huge sucess in my house. Thank you!

I made this in my slow cooker, so I didn't have to sit around all day babysitting my stove! I couldn't find oxtail, so I used two lbs. of beef soup bones instead, cooked the spices and bones and broth for 6 hours, then sliced up leftover cooked steak, and added the slices at the end just to warm them up. Delicious, and great flavour, although I did take the cinnamon stick and anise out after 4 hours as I thought it was getting a bit too strong for my taste. I will make this again and again- thanks for sharing!

I'd recommend roasting the onions whole before adding to the broth.  I'd use 4 onions.  I'd also recommend wrapping spices in a cheese cloth so that the spice bag can be taken out after about 4.5 hours, while the broth should cook on simmer (low heat) for about 7 hours.  I'd add 2 cloves of raw garlic and 2 pods of cademom as spices.  After bringing the stock to a boil, you should turn the heat down to simmer and continue skimming fat and foams off until the broth is clear.  Before putting bones and oxtail in, get water to a boiling point first.  This should help make the broth clearer.

Couldn't find beef knucles and didnt' have enough anise pods. That being said, the broth smelled better than it tasted. Lacking a little something. This takes a lot of work, but alas, we no longer live near any Vietnamese restaurants and I crave Pho.  I will definitely try it again using more anise.

This is a pretty authentic recipe. The one thing that strikes some as off here is the radish. It's dried radish that is used and it has a completely different taste- it will be packaged and labeled as dried radish or preserved radish and you will probably only find it at an asian market. Other than that great recipe!

Very very good!  My BIL introduced us to Pho in some nice little restaurants in Houston and I was trying to get rid of some rice noodles I had purchased by accident and I thought of Pho.  I substituted chicken backs for the beef bones, as we don't eat beef.  I didn't put slices of chicken in the bowls because I can't cut the chicken breasts thin enough (yet!).  I let the broth simmer all day (starting at 8 AM and dinner at 5).  My 4 and 6 year old and the picky neighbor kid who ate dinner with us that night, LOVED this meal.  We will make again.

I've never had pho, but my brother's girlfriend has and had been wanting to attempt to make her own at home for a while.  I found this recipe and we decided to give it a try.  I loved it and my brother's girlfriend was very pleased.  I will definitely be making this again.

Wow!  This is pretty good!  I pretty much halved the recipe but only used the beef oxtail.  I simmered this for 8 hours and omitted the fish sauce because I'm allergic.  Was a little on the bland side, probably because I didn't have enough meat.  Still tasted awesome with added salt though!  Thank you SO MUCH for this recipe!  Will definitely try this one again with more meat. :)

What a great recipe! Very authentic. I am glad I came across this as I can contorl the amount of sodium to my own needs and still enjoy a grea Pho whenever I want. I followed it exactly as descirbed. Took a lot of cooking time but well worth it!

I love this recipe!  My favorite side dish is the cooked radish from the soup. So yummy! Nevertheless, I can't get the salt measure correctly. Has anybody played with the salt yet? I feel the measures suggested in the recipe are insufficient but I seldom want to create a mistake. I was also wondering if folks tried substituting salt for soup soy sauce, and if yes, how the ratios worked out. I love the recipe because after I infuse more soy and fish sauce in my individual bowl, it is to die for me, but I am hoping to do it holistically in the pot. Appreciate your comments!

excellent recipe! i made some changes... For the broth i used beef bones instead of oxtail and beef knuckle (too expensive), added some celeriac root dumped in 2 bouillon cubes as well as all the onions, daikon radish etc. i also had a tea ball and i put the spices in that. this soup tasted just like my mothers! awesome!

Not bad for the first time making this. Family loved it.  Use 1-2 anise only.  Have to use beef bones which I forgot this time around. Overall pretty impressive for a noobie :D

Awesome!!! Suggestions to make it easier is to use a pre-made Pho broth paste/mix.  Also did not use any beef knuckles just oxtails.  Tasted great.

About to make - sounds wonderful.  Just a comment about the picture, which shows some kind of meat balls, which don't appear in the recipe.  Just make a note of the inconsistency.

I am simmering the broth right now and it smells FANTASTIC. I did not use star anise, or radish because I didn't have them on hand.. but if it tastes as good as it smells, I don't think me or my guys will have anything to worry about! (I am a caretaker of 5 teenage boys).  I did use a small handful of dashida (Korean beef soup base) earlier on instead of boiling beef knuckle for 2 hours... okay, okay so I cheated a bit, but it's my first time and I can only improve from here, right? ;) I'll try to upload a photo tomorrow when I serve this dish!

Wow this was a lot of work but worth it!  My hubby and I were craving some Pho and they don't have any Vietnamese restaurants where we moved to.  (Oh man do I miss the Asian food in Los Angeles!)  It was good but the broth was really rich and milky.  I think this was from the suggestion of using beef knucle which usually makes a milky broth.  Not like the clear delicate broth I'm used to getting.  I should have gone with my gut instinct and gotten a boneless cut.  I think part of the problem is that I also didn't leave the spice bag in longer than 5 min.  That was a personal thing.. I was tasting the broth and any longer would have been too strong on the spices for my taste. I added a large 'sweated' onion and toasted the spices before making the spice bag per suggestions.  Also be warned.. you WHOLE house will smell of this broth it's pretty potent.  Leave the windows open. :)

Followed the recipe exactly except I used beef soup bones found at my local grocery store.  Was a little bland so I had to add more salt, but that could have been a personal taste.  Other than that it turned out very close to authentic beef pho.

Very good.  My only change was to slow simmer the beef beforehand (I'm not into raw).  I didn't use anise as it interacts with a medication i take.  Otherwise, SO good and i make it regularly as I get a craving for it.

Will definitely make it again - I didn't use the beef knuckle with meat - just some regular steak strips and beef broth for simplicity, and it's less time consuming. Played around with the ingredients a bit, and you can add anything to it to make it your own.

This was an ok recipe but one that according to my chef friend, made a big mistake: telling the cook to bring the water to boil and "cooking" for two hours. It should've been bringing the broth to boil and then simmering it or at least giving it a lower temperature so it's not boiling for two hours. The pho ended up cloudy due to over boiling.

This definitely tasted like the real deal.  I made a few changes:

1. I used 4 lbs beef bones. I rinsed them off in hot water and then put them in the oven at 425 for 50 minutes, flipping them at 25 mins. 
2. I only used one onion.  I cut it in half and also put this in the oven with the ginger for ~40 minutes before adding it to the crockpot.
3. I put everything in a slow cooker and left it overnight and throughout the day (this had it simmering for ~18 hours)
4. I used two star anise pods, not 2 oz (I think this was a typo like others said)
5. I used the fresh noodles in the refrigerated section as advised by other reviewers. 
6. Didn't use radish like others said.

I agree it came out really oily, even after rinsing and roasting the bones.  It was better the 2nd day when I skimmed the fat off the top after it was in the fridge all night.   I will definitely make this a day ahead next time so I can skim that all off before the first serving! Sooo good and love that the broth is so healthy instead of the super salty ones you get at restaurants.  At first I thought this recipe needed more salt, but when you add lime or hot/sweet sauce it really isn't necessary.

I added twice as much ginger and 1 tablespoon of minced garlic to the broth and I also left out the radish. I strained the broth through cheesecloth in a strainer for a more clear broth. Delicious.... as good as any restaurant pho noodle soup I have had!!!!

Easy soup to fall in love with the  tender slices of beef and all those crunchy, spicy, herby garnishes we get to toss on top. I didn't make the broth and used sliced sirloin steak. I used those chewy Japanese Noodles. I like to set all the garnishes out so you can individually add what you like.

Worked out great. I made the mistake of not putting enough water because I was making a smaller batch since I knew it'd just be me and my husband eating a bulk of this dish, but the water worked down much more than I expected it to. Oops! Fortunately, I did a quick boil with some extra water while I waited for the fat to settle on the broth in a measuring cup. Thankfully it worked well and we ended up with enough broth for everyone. I did not use the radish and I'm fine with that as I'm not a fan anyway. I also had a premade bag of Pho seasonings from an international grocery store and added some carrots, celery, and garlic to the broth as instructed by a Thai friend who made some for me last year--I think I prefer that to adding radishes. By the way, I probably put too much salt, so be aware that it really doesn't need much more than this recipe calls for (I didn't measure, but pretty sure I put 1T worth in my half batch and I had to add water to my soup later). My husband is not a huge soup person and he really enjoyed this, so it's a win. And he's given me permission to make it every now and again. ;)

i skipped the radish and doubled the spices but at the end of eight hours, really didn't have a great beef flavored broth.  It smelled great, but still had little flavor.  Had to add a substantial amount of fish and soy sauce to get any flavor.  Next time, I will buy some beef and pho bullions to add as needed and roast the bones and onion before boiling as I've seen in some other recipes.

This beef Pho recipe was amazing! I was a little lazy and decided instead of making my own beef broth, I'd just use beef bouillon with all the other ingredients: the star anise, cloves, cinnamon and onions. I also added carrots as well. I took everybody's advice to sweat the onions (and carrots) before adding them to the soup base, which was a great idea! Just makes all the aromatic smells and flavors come together.
However, even though the beef broth did work in a pinch, because I did not have enough time to start making it from scratch, using the beef knuckle an ox tail; I would definitely go ahead next time and try to make the beef broth from scratch, if I have enough time. 
I am pretty much a novice in the kitchen, but this recipe was pretty easy and came out tasting pretty authentic. Well I guess as authentic as I can imagine since the only Pho I have had has been from Vietnamese restaurants in the States.
Anywho I garnished my Pho adding: udon noodles, cilantro, green onions, hard boiled eggs, sriracha, bean sprouts and limes.

When I lived in Portland, OR, I ate at Vietnamese restaurants frequently.  Now that I'm in middle of nowhere upstate NY, there are no such options and I really miss Pho.  The broth took a whole day to prepare - I wanted a strong, slowly cooked bone broth - but well worth it.  Before serving I added additional fish sauce to taste.  I also left out the radish based on other reviews.

I quartered this recipe and it saved me from having to go to a restaurant every time I have a craving. I used chicken broth and a beef bullion cube instead of starting from scratch with beef knuckles (since it's what I had on hand) and I only simmered the spice bag for 1 hour instead of 4. It was still amazing. Now that I have all of the spices on hand I will definitely make this again. Thank you very much!

Very authentic flavor...  I was pleasantly surprised! Substituted a couple of other soup bone/meat cuts for the stock, but by and large followed this recipe.  Also used the stock meat (shredded) for thai meatballs to go along with it.

I made this today with great anticipation. The house smelled wonderful while the broth was cooking...unfortunately it did not have enough flavor when we were eating it. I followed the recipe exactly but we were disappointed.

Fabulous!  Wonderfully authentic.  Gives all the right garnishes as well.  As good as the Pho shops in Seattle.
