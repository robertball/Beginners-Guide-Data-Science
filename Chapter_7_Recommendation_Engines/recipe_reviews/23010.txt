This is great!  I made it instead of cranberry sauce and it was a huge hit.  The only problem was that I couldn't find cranberry gelatin.  I used cherry which worked fine, but I am sure it would have been even better with cranberry.  Also, I was in a hurry to get this thing in the fridge before going to church, so I just threw it all together in a bowl.  It turned out great.  I don't think the added initial chilling is necessary, nor the additional step of pouring into 13x9 dish.  Perhaps it just creates a more interesting presentation or something.

Recipe was a big hit.   Couldn't find cranberry jello so I used strawberry.  Also I used a small can of mandarin oranges instead of the regular orange.

Very Good!!! I made this at Thanksgiving and it turned out delicious. I modified mine a little I  used cherry jello and add one extra pack of jello, 2- 14 oz. cans of whole cranberry sauce, extra 1/2 cup of sugar and 20oz. of Mandarin slices drained instead of oranges. I mixed my jello, sugar and hot water in the dish I was serving until jello dissolved and then added remaining ingredients and then refrigerated until ready to serve. It does taste better the longer it sets. I made mine 5 days before servings. Thanks Valorie for sharing this wonderful recipe!!! New family favorite.

I love this salad.  My mother passed this recipe to me and I make it everytime I find fresh cranberries.  Makes it better in my opinion.  I also use a large sugar-free raspberry jello instead of the one listed.  Awesome sauce even for those who don't like cranberries!!

This is a good spin on an old favoriat.  Sometimes if I have a bigger than expected crowd, I will mix whipped topping in with it.

Soooo good!  I made this instead of the traditional cranberries-in-a-can for Thanksgiving and my entire family loved it!  I had to use cherry jell-o because I couldn't find cranberry, but it was still amazing.  I have a feeling I'll be making it for Christmas too!

My mother-in-law introduced me to this dish. It is now a staple in our home for every fall/winter occasion. We omit the walnuts and oranges, but otherwise, I love this dish!

Found it!  My MIL makes this for holidays and I love it.  I will not eat cranberries out of a can.  This is so much healthier and tastes so fresh.  I like adding a little orange zest.  Any time we do holidays elsewhere I make this and I am so glad to have found the exact recipe on here because my MIL is out of town and I wasn't sure of the specific directions.  THANKS!

This was wonderful and is now a family favorite.  There is a fight for the last serving.  It is what my extended family asks that I bring every holiday. I add grapes because it is what my Grandmother did as well.  Enjoy! kimf

This is a close variation of a family favorite. 1 package fresh cranberries, 1 orange peeled (retain a little orange zest) 3 apples (cored only) cherry gelatin only 1 cup boiling water (juice from fruit will be other cup) chopped pecans instead of the walnuts. Grind cranberries, apples and orange in meat grinder. Dissolve gelatin with boiling water and mix all ingredients and chill till it's firm.

y husband makes a cranberry 'relish' very much like this but he uses black cherry jello and no celery. We eat it so fast we argue who gets the first taste!!!  It is important how to mix the jello so it gels properly. TRY this even if you don't like cranberries--you WILL NOT be sorry!!

My Mom always made this at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Her recipe also has a cup of crushed pineapple. Also uses one more cup of water. And I used a 12oz bag of cranberries. I blend them and the half orange in blender until chopped like I want using part of the water to do so. So good!!

I have made this twice now and everyone loves it, even those who don't typically like cranberry, like me.  I have made it once adding the extra sugar and once using only sugar from the jello and everyone liked that version better, otherwise it is too sweet and you miss out on the tartness of the cranberries.  I use raspberry jello and this year I have decided to make it in a muffin tin so everyone has their own individual gelatin salads.  I will updated my review and let you know how that worked.

I did this using 1 can of cranberry sauce, 1 can of cranberry sauce with berries, and small Box of Black Cherry Jello, and then followed the recipe, it is so good and simple to make, and at this time of the year, thats so important.

I have made this 3 times now, it is so fresh and delicious and beautiful. I omit the celery and grate about a tsp of orange zest. I use the whole peeled orange and chop it up in the food processor. I use the food processor to chop all the fruits and nuts, being careful to not overdo it and turn it into applesauce! If using a jello mold or bundt pan, dip the mold in warm water for about 15 seconds to loosen the jello from the pan before inverting it onto serving plate.

It’s a hit every time I make it! I sometimes substitute raspberry jello if I can’t find cranberry. Very delicious!

I made this using raspberry gelatin. I did cook my cranberries in water until they popped ( because that’s what Mom used to do). I then used the cranberry water in the gelatin. I used half the sugar because I like the tartness. Great!

Everyone’s tastes really varies:  i love sugar but need to cut down and kids often reject nuts and the bitterness of say, orange peel.  don’t forget the jello box may already have sugar.  I cut the sugar by half, trimmed a whole small orange of some of it’s white pith and seeded it and processed it peel and all, two smallish peeled Granny Smith apples, black cherry jello and toasted walnuts, and no celery.  I processed everything separately into the cuisinart and chopped it pretty well but not too much in order to give it some chew.  I liked it a lot,  it was sweet/tart and bright tasting-if that makes sense...A healthy recipe really with all the fruit and nuts (except for the sugar)

My husband loved it.  There is a bit of prep time but worth it.  Next time I will add pineapple and a bit less sugar so it has more tang for my taste.

I have made this for years, but my recipe calls for cherry gelatin, more oranges & cranberries, a smidge of fresh lemon juice and a tad less sugar. I also freeze my cranberries first and add them ground into the hot gelatin mixture, which acts as a quick-set for the gelatin.  I give my version 5 stars.

This dish has been in  my family for 4 generations but of course it was never written down. When it was my turn to take over the holiday meals I found this recipe; it is perfect.  I had to use cherry Jello, I'm not sure they make cranberry Jello any more. The apples  and celery add a nice crunch. I serve it on a lettuce leaf which makes it very Christmas y. Excellent!

This was great. Made it the day before Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it, even my brother who dislikes cranberries. Sister-in-law loved it. It was a hit. Reminded me of my grandmothers jello fruit salads. Thank you.

This is so delicious that I made it two weeks before Thanksgiving so we could have it twice! Came out perfect!

I changed it a little, used Mandarin oranges and used strawberry jello, used juice from oranges instead of all water. I love this recipe.

It was great. The only thing I would change is to add more cranberries. My husband shopped for me. He couldn't find cranberry jello. I have used raspberry in prior recipes but I guess since he likes cherry jello that is what he bought. I omitted the sugar since I like my cranberries on the tart side. It would be a 5 star recipe if I had the cranberry jello or had more cranberries.

My grandmother made this for every Thanksgiving with a few variations.  I use raspberry jello, leave out the oranges and use pecans instead of walnuts.  Everyone in the family loves it.  It is great with a thin layer of whipped cream on top.

This was super easy and delicious. Every one in my family loved it. I will absolutely be making it again. My mother told me I had to make it every Thanksgiving.
