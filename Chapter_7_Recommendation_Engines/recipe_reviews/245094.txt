As is the recipe is ok. I'd say that 3 cloves is not enough, I added 4 small cloves and we like  everything garlic-y AF in our house! I would also saute the mushrooms separately if you have fresh chantrelles as they hold SO MUCH water that they make the sauce too watery to just toss in with everything as the recipe suggests.

We liked this recipe. I did cook it in crock pot. I added spinach and egg noodles last  30 minutes. I did not add cream and flour. The liquid was enough to cook noodles in pot. Will cook again.

Very simple and delicious, super forgiving recipe! Just watch the liquid, I ended up with less chicken broth, also added whine while saut√©ed shallots to reduce it. I added red chili pepper flakes for a little spice. Definitely double the shallots and can completely do without flour. Serve over zucchini squash!

Excellent with the shiitake mushrooms.  I added a fresh tomato for color.
