This was fantastic!  The topping browned about 5 minutes early than the recipe said, otherwise I did everything as stated. Big success with the family - served warm with ice cream.

This was not bad, a little soupy and i didn't really like the topping, i found it kind of boring, i can't really put my finger on it, just for me it was missing a little something something

This was good, but it was a little wetter than I would have liked. I did used frozen peaches, but they were very well drained before putting the cobbler together. I used blueberries as suggested since huckleberries don't seem to be available in my area. This is a very tasty dessert served with vanilla ice cream.

Excellent recipe modified.  I used six fresh, ripe peaches, and 1 cup blueberries instead of huckleberries.  Additional mods: 1) Added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg to fruit mixture; 2) increased topping by one half; 3) to topping added 1/8 tsp. nutmeg and 1/8 tsp. cardamom; 4) substituted buttermilk for milk.  
As mentioned by others, the fruit mixture does end with more liquid than typical, however, with the increase in topping it evens out.  Delicious and will make again:)

07.27.17 ~ Not having huckleberries, I subbed blueberries like the submitter suggested.  I halved the recipe and served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  A nice ending to a dinner of 'BLT', 'Cucumber Sunomono' and 'Fast, Fresh Grape Tomato Salad' all recipes from AR.

Everyone loved it.  I made a few changes.  We have peach trees and berry bushes so I bumped up the fruit about 50%.  Instead of cinnamon I added ginger and cardamom to the topping.

Substituted blueberries for the huckleberries and honey for the sugar and was glad I did. If I would have used the sugar I would have eaten this all day and nothing else. As it was I had a hard time. Will definitely make again, Fantastic.

I used fresh peaches and blueberries and it was fantastic! My family loved it and gobbled it all up! I did increase the sugar with the fruit mixture because I knew my peaches were not super sweet and I used more than 3 cups of peaches.

This was delicious and came out perfect.  The only change I made was using  1 cup of frozen blueberries (threw them in frozen) and 4 cups of sliced peaches.  Topped with whipped cream, it was a nice finish to our dinner.

Way too much sugar in fruit  and in topping; too much topping. Halve the sugar in both parts and cut the topping in half to get a better fruit to topping ratio.

Made this with the changes suggested (including blueberries and Splenda). It was a two-thumbs-up hit with my husband and our dinner guests! Will definitely make this again.

Advice on how to avoid a soggy cobler -> Its amazing ! I used my own frozen huckleberries i picked myself ! I had a ton of left over juice in the pan tho. And i definately didnt want a soggy cobbler. So i used a syringe to get all the juices out, I then proceeded to use the extra juices and hucks to make a sauce topping ( which freakung rocked btw) and i hand made some whipped cream to go with it as well. This recipe is a winner with minor changes and additions.

Excellent recipe! I used a combination of ripe peaches of 3 different types and half huckleberries and half blueberries and it was delicious. I also add lemon juice to the fruit mixture and zest to the filling and the crumble.

Yummy, and not difficult.  I substituted frozen blackberries for the huckleberries, and I liked the additional tartness.  I made this in a solar oven for a solar cooking class and everyone raved.
