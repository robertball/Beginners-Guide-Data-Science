I love buttermilk, straight or mixed with cornbread (maybe a few pieces of onion).

Just to let people know, this recipe does NOT make buttermilk like you buy in the store. Never has, never will. You get 'buttermilk substitute' for cooking/baking. 

However, if you like to drink buttermilk, this recipe will always put a little pucker on your face. You get milk with vinegar. 

If you want CULTURED buttermilk, you must make it from a culture.

I think the author should have made this clear.

Usually I need buttermilk for a specific  recipe and  the rest of the carton would go to waste. Now I only make homemade buttermilk by using milk and vinegar. There is no need to ever buy it from the store again.

Use this method all the time - such a great tip for buttermilk when you don't have it or don't want to buy a whole container for one small recipe!

I usually do not have milk on hand but I had organic milk that I did not want to have to throw out and was planning on skinless chicken breast for dinner.  I also had organic lemon and decided to substitute the lemon for the vinegar.  The milk was perfect.  It was easy and really helped to moistness of the baked chicken.  I do suggest using this vinegar recipe to enhance your meal.

Thank you! I needed this for a recipe and forgot to purchase buttermilk. But now I can just make this and not have to waste leftover store bought buttermilk.

Clutch!! I use this all the time! The real deal is probably best but this works well in a pinch.
