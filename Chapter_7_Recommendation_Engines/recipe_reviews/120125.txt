After reading through a number of reviews, I feel it's important to make clear that these are not muffins, nor is this banana bread in a muffin tin--these are definitely cupcakes. Banana bread, of course, has a moist but dense crumb.  These are pleasantly sweet, moist, light and fluffy little cakes. And very GOOD cupcakes at that! I used buttermilk powder for the buttermilk, which is always nice for times like this when only a small amount of buttermilk is called for.  I skipped the frosting as I was craving a banana/chocolate combo and frosted them with "Chocolate Cream Frosting," also from this site. I tasted one before I even frosted them and had to restrain myself from having another--they were that delicious.

I have tried this recipe once with old bananas, nice and ripe. It really was the most amazing tasting little cakes i have ever had, and they were finished in no time, we honestly could not stop eating.
That day, i only really had bananas in the house, hence i didnt have special shortening or buttermilk, so i just replaced them with butter and normal milk. And what a fantastic little cake it was. I didnt even have time to ice them, we ate them all before i could finish the icing. Très très Bon!!

Excellent! Every time I serve these, I have someone ask me for the recipe. I've made them with buttermilk and with a milk/vinegar combo when I don't have buttermilk on hand, and they always turn out great.

These were excellent! We are banana bread snobs and it got a thumbs-up from my husband (his mouth was full of cupcake). Like other reviewers, I used butter instead of shortening, regular milk with a little extra butter (melted) and cream cheese in the frosting. And, they did require a longer cooking time to be done.

Excellent recipe!! very moist banana-ey cupcake, it's like a cross between muffin and cake.

I do suggest you cut the sugar, i only use 1 and 1/4 cup and it's perfectly sweet.
I also substitute half the milk in the icing for lemon juice (to balance all that sugar - giving it a fresher taste).

It takes me 30mnts to fully cooked it. (15mnts at 175C and 15mnts at 150C) i turn down the temp because the top's already turned golden brown at the first 15mnts - don't wanna burnt it :)

Very good, they're definitely cupcakes.  Some comments said they tasted like muffins, but they are definitely sweet and cake-like.

These turned out pretty good, not really amazing but they taste fine. I don't know if I would make them again, they're kind of a mediocre variation of banana bread, only with frosting. But they were fun to try!

These were delicious, although I overbaked mine just a tad. I added some dark rum & cinnamon to the batter and some rum flavoring to a brown sugar icing that I found on another website. Very good flavor and a great recipe!

Excellent recipe! These are perfectly proportioned cupcakes, they come out full and round. They are very light and taste great. I used chocolate icing rather than the butter icing in this recipe. Will keep this recipe on hand for my ripe bananas in the freezer.

My review is for the cake ONLY, as I iced these with AR's "Banana Butter Icing" instead. This is a great banana cake. If you don't use shortening (I use Crisco, it's trans-fat free, but do what you like), then be sure to use actual butter. Margarine or other butter-blends may or may not yield the correct result here. Baking is not an art; it's a science, governed by mathematical and physical rules. Making weird substitutions violates those rules, and can yield weird results. As written, this is nothing at ALL like banana bread barring a light banana flavor. If you want a stronger banana flavor, use banana extract, because every additional tablespoon of real bananas you introduce to this recipe messes up the liquid:dry ratio. That's my best advice. Now, if only someone could teach ME the trick of frosting cupcakes perfectly, I'd be in business. Thanks for the recipe, I got a perfect yield of 18!

These are SOOOO good! I needed to use some overripe bananas and this is the first banana recipe I can happily give 5 stars to!     I think it goes to show that there are a lot of good reviews here without highly advised "tweaking" recommendations, just mostly ingredient changes based on availability and some personal preferences!     I didn't change anything in the recipe, made them as is, other than using mini muffin tins. And everyone is right, they are delicious without frosting, could pass for a sweet cake-like version of mini banana muffins. I couldn't stop eating them!    I frosted some with the recipe here, less a 1/2 cup sugar and a bit more milk and the other half with that Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe some other folks mentioned.    They didn't need the frosting, and although they were good, I'd have to say they were even better plain. Next time, I might throw some chopped walnuts in the batter too!     Sidenote: It took 2 medium bananas to get 1 cup of mashed banana for me.

Fantastic!  I used a trick I saw on cooks illustrated tv to bump up the banana flavor.  Microwave the bananas (whether green or brown) for 5 minutes.  Strain the bananas and reserve the juice.  Simmer the juice until it's reduced by half, it will be a syrupy consistency.  Cool and add it back to the batter.  It really bumps up the banana flavor without adding all that extra liquid, especially if you're using black bananas!  I also reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup, and as others suggested, subbed brown sugar (3/4 c brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar).  You can't tell at all.  Next time I will reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup and see what it does.  I made these in mini cupcakes and regular.   Word of advice, when taking them out of the pan, whether you're using papers or not, they are really soft when warm.  I dented a few, and one fell onto the others when tipping them out of the pan and it split in half as well as sticking to the top of the other and ripping the yummy browned crust off. :(. After they've cooled a bit, they are less fragile.  Fantastic recipe, I'll be using it again and again!

I had one very ripe banana that I wanted to use up so I adapted this recipe cutting it by 2/3. The cupcakes were very light and delicate in texture. I'm looking forward to making this again when I have the full portion of bananas on hand. Very good with a cream cheese frosting.

Really yummy!  I love brown sugar with bananas, so I used 1 cup white and a 1/2 cup brown sugar.  My buttermilk was expired, so I went with the regular milk/vinegar trick.  I plan on using a cream cheese frosting and topping them with some toasted coconut!  Thanks

DELICIOUS! I used butter flavored shortening and added chocolate chips. My plan is to make banana-split cupcakes by hollowing out center, adding strawberry jam and topping with vanilla frosting. This recipe was exactly what I wanted.

Excellent cupcakes! A truly moist light banana-y cupcakes with a slight crunchy topping. Recipe was easy to follow and simple to put together. I used 1/2 cup butter instead of shortening. I mashed 2 very ripe bananas which equaled 1 cup the recipe called for. I also opted to use1 tsp of banana extract instead of vanilla extract. stirred in 1/4 c. buttermilk along with all other ingredients. I ended up 22 cute delicious cupcakes. I could taste the moist sweet fluffy cakes with lots of banana flavors running throughout - perfect! My house smelled of banans...Mmm.  As for the frosting, I decided to pass on the one called for in the recipe and use a chocolate frosting instead simply because everyone (except myself) loves chocolate frosting. This is a keeper for me! thank you for the recipe.

This were great except I think there is too much fat in the recipe. I will reduce the shortening in the future.  I also used plain greek yogurt instead of buttermilk and topped with a little ball of peanut butter before baking.  No frosting needed.  This recipe doubles well.

These are pretty good but not super sweet. I just made the cupcake and frosted with chocolate hazelnut frosting. I used three really ripe bananas that had been frozen and thawed. (I always put over ripe bananas in the freezer and then take them out and thaw them whenever I want to make something like banana bread. It works really well.)

I had tasted a banana cake made by a coworker a few years back and the taste and texture of these cupcakes reminded me of that cake.  Very yummy!  I chose to serve mine with a basic cream cheese icing and they were delicious!  Would be great with nuts, too!

I've made this dozens of times (without the frosting) and it's wonderful!  I've made a few changes of over time: the recipe scales back to 12 cupcakes well; brown sugar tastes better than white sugar; butter instead of shortening works well; a mix of butter and oil instead of shortening also yields a moist cake; using milk + vinegar works well; using plain milk works well; using almond milk was surprisingly delicious too!  A super versatile recipe if you need to play around with it.

5 stars as is AND an extra 5 stars for also being a great base to work with!

Great cupcakes!!  Everyone was surprised with the texture.  I think they were expecting banana muffins or banana bread, but these were definitely "cakes".  I got 19 out of a batch this afternoon and there is only 1 left.  But I had 7 grandkids for dinner tonight.

These were very good cupcakes.  I gave them 4 stars because they stick to the paper cup.  Although very moist, not like cake at all.  I used 5 bananas because that is how many I had.    Very banana-y flavor. I did make cream cheese icing and made it thin enough to dip the tops into.  Sprinkled nuts on top for come crunch for Hubby.   He loves them.  Told me to not forget this one. Thanks!

these cupcakes are great and so easy to make!!  I pretty much followed the recipes as is, except I added just a tad of cinnamon and used whole milk instead of butter milk (that was all I had on hand) and they turned out perfect!! Not a big fan of the frosting that is provided so will probably just try a cream cheese icing instead, but they are delicious on their own!!  Will definitely be making these again!!

My husband said that they were the best cupcakes that he had ever had. I made some peanut butter frosting to go on top! Yumm! They didn't last long! I didn't have buttermilk, so I used plain non-fat yogurt instead and also substituted butter for the shortening.

My kids (6 and 4) gobbled these up before I could even frost them.  Maybe next time!  The texture and flavor was very good.  Since I'm at 6600 ft. I halved the baking soda and powder so that I didn't end up with hockey pucks.  Also didn't have buttermilk, but sour cream did the job.  Made 17 cupcakes, baked for 20 minutes.

I have been craving banana baked goods, so when my daughter decided she wanted to bake cupcakes tonight for her grandma, we chose this recipe.  We followed it exactly, and OMG they are incredibly scrumptious!!!  We split one to determine whether we wanted to frost them.  They are awesome without frosting, But we went ahead and put chocolate frosting on them.  Wow- out of this world good!!!  Thanks for the great recipe- I will be making these again and again!

These cupcakes were delicious.  I followed the recipe pretty much as described and was awarded with a great cupcake.  To give it a little more pizazz, I put a little piece of pineapple in the middle.  My daughter said, "this is the best cupcake I've ever had".  The reason for the four stars is because the frosting was not spectacular.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

This was my first time trying this recipe.  I have just recently began baking for fun.  The only thing I changed was the amount of banana i put in the cupcake batter.  I used 4 medium bananas, mashed them, and then used an electric mixer to kinda liquify the bananas.  It produced 1 3/4 cup banana mash which made the moistness of these cupcakes unbelievable.  The recipe produced 24 cupcakes as opposed to 18 even filling 2/3 full.  I then topped them with a dollup of my homemade cream cheese frosting and roasted walnuts.  I brought them into the hospital and gave them away, and received RAVE reviews!!!  I give this recipe 5 stars easily and will cook these again very soon.

I'm on a baking vegan craze right now, and I'm low on ingredients. So, did some tweaking: Used 1/2 cup canola (out of shortening!! never let this happen in your kitchen!); substituted: flax for eggs, soy milk for buttermilk, and whole wheat for white AP; used three large bananas; added 1 C carob chips and crushed walnuts in batter and on top. SO light, tasty and moist! i'm never going back to banana bread! BAKE VEGAN! it's awesome when it comes out fab and every says it tastes fab..and then when the big vegan reveal happens, the shock value is priceless! ;)

These were just wonderful! So moist and flavorful. Definitely the consistency of a perfect cupcake, not banana bread. I followed the cake recipe exactly, except I didn't have buttermilk so I put 1 teaspoon lemon juice in my measuring cup then filled up to the 1/4 cup mark with milk. Voila, buttermilk! I didn't use this frosting, rather the chocolate cream cheese frosting recipe from this site. Decorated each cupcake with a banana chip on top. These got rave reviews, my guests couldn't stop eating them! Will make again and again.

Very yummy! I used 2 previously frozen bananas which needed almost no mashing. I added 1/8 C peanut butter in the batter before flour. Kids absolutely loved them, even without frosting.

excellent recipe for cupcakes - my husband is a banana fan but not me.   Anyway, even tho it is more cake than bread this is also the recipe I use quite often for banana bread which is wonderful too.

Great cupcakes.  I added cinnamon to the icing and topped it off with walnuts like the photo.  Very tasty.  I also used regular milk instead of butter milk, and butter instead of shortening.  Worked well.

Delicious!! Very simple and easy recipe likewise the overall taste is very easy and simple which isn't a bad thing at all. Sometimes it is nice to have a simple tasting thing, and sometimes they are more fitting for certain occasions!! They're good as in a family treat,picnic, get together and the like. They just aren't something you would pay $2-4 dollars for at a nice bakery. I used butter instead of shortening,  about 1/4 cup more sugar, only 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda, and sour cream instead of buttermilk. Taking advice from others I used cream cheese frosting and they turned out amazing.

I love these cupcakes! The best advice I can give to make these absolutely amazing is to USE VERY RIPE BANANAS! Also, I used a cream cheese frosting instead of the one supplied in the recipe.

This is a good recipe. The cupcake was moist and soft. Since I used whole wheat flour instead of the regular one, i doubled the milk. I dont have a buttermilk so what i did was add lemon to the milk and let it sit for 10 mins before adding it to the sugar/shortening mix. 1/4 cup of milk needs .75 teasespoon of lemon juice.

Three words: YUM! YUM! YUM! Make the cupcakes exactly like the recipe says but skip the frosting and nuts and top with a cream cream cheese, marshmallow, or chocolate frosting instead. (The frosting in this recipe is more like a glaze and looks like a runny mess unless you drizzle it on like in the picture.) Best cupcakes I've ever made! Thanks for the great recipe.

great recipe to work with and tweak! i omitted the icing, used butter instead of shortening, halved the sugar and added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and a cup of semisweet chocolate chips. it came out rich, moist, and fragrant (and not too sweet). super delicious! i'm definitely making these again! :)

I made these cupcakes for my daughter's first birthday (because she LOVES bananas) and they were a big hit! The previous reviewer was right in saying that these are "cupcakes" and not banana bread. They are light and fluffy with a good banana flavor. I did use butter instead of shortening (as I always do) and they were delicious! I used a vanilla cream-cheese frosting instead of the buttercream, but I'm sure either would be wonderful. Thank you for the terrific recipe! Definitely a keeper!

These are awesome! I haven't even put icing on them yet and about half of them are already gone.  I didn't have any shortening so I used 1/2 cup of canola oil and they came out great.  Going into the recipe box and used often. Thanks for the great recipe.

As I was preparing this recipe, I realized I was out of cupcake liners.  I just poured it in the pan and baked it that way, adjusting the time to bake longer  It was fabulous, and my guests loved it too.  I made a cream cheese frosting to put on it instead.

Just not that excited about these. I made exactly as stated and mine were pretty heavy for a cupcake. Not very moist either. I was dissapointed - but my hopes were pretty high due to all the rave reveiws. I would have been better off making my favorite banana cake (Banana cake VI)into muffins.

Moist and pretty good but didn't pack the banana flavor I expected (based on my personal review as well as a dozen or so taste-testers). I frosted with a chocolate buttercream frosting, which went over well... but a light cream cheese frosting would be nice too (not a huge fan of the plain frosting posted).

Terrific cupcakes!    I made these for a meeting and they disappeared.    Also gave some to two guys from the water company working on our property and they loved them.    I made no changes to the recipe.   Yummy - thanks.

I had some over ripe bananas that needed to be used or thrown out, so I tried this recipe this afternoon. The cupcakes turned out GREAT. Sweet and fluffy and exactly what I was looking for. I only had skim milk (instead of buttermilk)and butter (instead of shortening) in the house, and they worked just fine. The cupcakes were light and so tasty!! I topped them with chocolate frosting and they were absolutely perfect. My husband raved!! We will definitely use this recipe again when we have super ripe bananas that need to be used in a delicious way!!

These cupcakes are absolutely wonderful!!!!!! Very good banana flavor and moist. Added some chopped walnuts and used skim milk instead of buttermilk. Highly recommend this recipe. Could not help myself from trying them warm out of the oven before they were frosted. Had to eat 2 of them, they were so delicous!!! Thanks for sharing the recipe. I will be making these all the time!!!

I just made these for my husband's birthday and he loved them! Everyone else liked them as well. They are very moist and definitely cake-like, not like banana bread. The only alteration I made was doubling the vanilla and I used 4 medium very ripe bananas (one heaping cup). They needed to be baked a little longer, about 25 mins, but they still turned out delicious! This recipe is replacing my current banana cupcake recipe for sure! Oh and I frosted them with Betty Crocker cream cheese frosting, not the recipe included.

I made these with whole wheat flour and a simple cream cheese frosting for my son's first birthday. Based on other reviews I substituted softened butter and whole milk for the shortening and buttermilk. The adults said they were good, and my baby seemed to thoroughly enjoy his first cake experience!

I also used cream cheese instead of butter. Without frosting the cakes were okay, but with the frosting perfect. I put some cinnamon in half of the batter; with the cinnamon the cakes (actually: muffins) tastes better!

These cupcakes were delicious!  I had a jewelry party, and they were a big hit!  I had to bake them for the full 20 minutes.  I made a cream cheese icing for them instead of the one with the recipe.  I will definitely be making them again.

YUMMY! I've been baking a different cupcake every week now for several weeks, and this has been my favorite. Great cake consistency and banana flavor. I am so happy to have a new recipe to use with ripe bananas! I didn't use the above recipe, but the one on AR "Chocolate Ganche". Thanks for posting!

AWESOME banana cupcakes! I used butter instead of shortening, fat free milk with a little vinegar instead of buttermilk, ground flax seed and water (2 Tbls. ground flax, 6 Tbl. water) instead of eggs, and added fresh ground nutmeg. I knew these were going to be good when I tasted the batter (something I do when I replace the eggs in a recipe with flax seed- I would never eat raw egg!) I made 12 regular cupcakes, and 12 mini's. Light and fluffy cakes, with good flavor! I frosted them with cream cheese frosting made with 1/4 cup butter, 1 8oz pkg less fat cream cheese, powdered sugar that I used to the right consistency- didn't measure, and 1 tsp vanilla. I will use this recipe again and again...better than the banana cake recipes I've tried, and better than banana muffins.

Cut the sugar down to 1 cup. I did this, and they are sweet like a normal cupcake. I can't imagine what they would taste like with more sugar than 1 cup. 

Make sure your bananas are almost black. If not, they won't have any flavor.

Make sure your ingrediants are @ room temp. 

Her directions aren't very clear ... dont just dump in ingredients. The eggs need to be beat 30 seconds after each egg. The addition of the dry to wet should be done in 3 segments, and under 60 seconds. Add first of 3 dry ingred. , incorporate just to combine (about 10-15 seconds) repeat . 

DO NOT OVERMIX. I cooked the first batch for 18 minutes, they weren't done so my second round I left in for 21, they were much better.

Be careful when peeling off wrapper, they stick a bit. Thats annoying...

I paired with a light fluffy PB buttercream....heaven, a must try!

Absolutely wonderful! Made these for my work holiday party and they were a hit. Made some regular sized and baked for 18-18 1/2, and some mini-cupcakes that only needed about 15 minutes. Instead of using the icing as indicated, I made chocolate fudge frosting. Dropped a little in the center on top of the cupcake, and topped it off with a peanut. Great -- highly recommend!!

SO YUMMY!  Flavors of banana bread, but light and airy like a cupcake.  I substituted butter for shortening, then added a couple teaspoons of mayonnaise to keep the tenderness.  I also used a mix of milk and lemon juice for buttermilk.  I added a touch of strawberry extract to the frosting, then lightly topped with coconut flakes and chopped walnuts.  Really delish!

Everybody who's said that these are more like muffins and banana bread are way off mark. These are truly light, airy, and really delicious cupcakes and do stay true to everything that Wanda promises. I increased recipe to give 24 cupcakes and managed 30 out of them. I did some of these with metread's 'Cream Cheese Frosting with Brown Butter & Bourbon' recipe, and they were OUT OF THE WORLD. I did the rest with my own proportions of butter,confectioner's sugar and milk and a drop of red colour to make pink ribbons on the cupcakes for breast cancer awareness. These are splendid without frosting. And perhaps if you do want to frost them, you might consider cutting the sugar in the cupcakes a wee bit. P.S: I realised after putting these in the oven to bake, that I'd used butter instead of shortening....but no harm done whatsoever. =) Also, these took me between 15-18 minutes baing time. Thank you Wanda for sharing. This one is a definite keeper. =) P.P.S: Next time, I will cut the sugar down to 1 cup coz ripe bananas tend to lend a lot of sweetness too. (Cut back refers to original recipe for 18 cupcakes and not my increased version).

Cupcakes are very good, but expect to spend a lot more time making them than the recipe calls for. These are also more like muffins than cupcakes. But they do taste good.

First banana cupcake I ever made and didn't disappoint at all, very moist, light and doesn't need any frosting. Good as is! I used to love baking but after a few not so good results (end result too dense or heavy), I gave up on it. This cupcake inspired me again to bake. Thanks for a great recipe.

These are a real treat!  I loved the light cake texture.  Usually I avoid using shortening, but used an organic, non-hydrogenated vegetable shortening this time with great results...light texture & great flavor.  I made a half batch of the frosting which was plenty to generously frost all of the cupcakes.  We prefer desserts that aren't too sweet, and with the frosting, these delicious cupcakes started to be really sweet for us.  I will make them again, but probably skip the frosting unless it is a special occasion.  The banana cupcake itself (not the frosting) is the star here!

No mistaking these for muffins. Light, airy, delicious.
I used cream-cheese frosting (everything tastes better with cream cheese frosting), but even without the frosting these cupcakes are scrumptious.

I am not a very experienced baker. and these turned out wonderful!!!! They were fairly simple to make and tasted absolutely delicious. Very moist and had just the right amount of banana flavor. I used two which made them perfect. I will definitely make these again. I cannot comment on the icing tho as I used a cream cheese icing that i made. They'd be good without icing though!

The flavor is good but I don't think they are cupcake-like.  Just tastes like little loaves of banana bread.

These cupcakes are AMAZING! I too, like another member used butter in lieu of shortening and milk instead of buttermilk.  They still were great, although I think baking them on the longer side is what I will do next time, as they are turned out a little sticky and fell apart, not keeping there shape.

For the frosting, I used store bought cream cheese frosting and topped with chopped walnuts.  My husband just stole mine right out of my hand! :)

These are so delicious! I made them with the Chocolate Cream Frosting from this site as well and together they were incredible!  They were very light  and cupcake-y when they came out of the oven but then when I had to refrigerate them for the frosting they seemed to get more dense like a muffin.  Still amazing though!

Yum!  I substituted butter for the shortening  and milk for the buttermilk.  These are delicious!  I took others' advice and made cream cheese frosting to drizzle and dusted with pumpkin pie spice.  Absolutely delicious!

Gluten Free Diary Free and still Wonderful! Loved this recipe, great banana flavor without being heavy. I have some special diet needs so there are a few things I had to change, but they're still great. First, use White Rice Flour in place of all-purpose flour. I used pure orange juice instead of buttermilk, and olive oil in place of the shortening. I also replaced half of the sugar with honey, and added 2 TBS more then the recipe called for and one  banana extra. Most of these changes can be used to make any standard recipe gluten and dairy free. I don't recommend using honey for any more then half the amount of sugar, and if you don't want to use orange juice in a recipe try rice milk. My husband gave these a 9 out of 10, he said they'll be a 10 with frosting.

I made a double recipe of these because of so many ripe bananas and was surprised by how delicious they turned out. My family ate them without frosting and found them to be wonderful as is. Will make a caramel frosting for those that will make it to church.

I like banana bread.... I like cupcakes... so I thought these would be amazing... I followed the recipe to the letter, and I wouldn't make these again.  One of my friends loved them, but I feel like they need more banana flavor... and I didn't enjoy the texture.  I read a review saying these were just banana cupcakes, not a type of banana bread...nope... they're a hybrid.  for me they're a no, but again, that's just me, everyone else at my house loved them.

I tried making these todays and it came out very good.  It was moist, sweet, and delicious.  It took a little longer than the 15-20 minutes mentioned here. I recommend checking on them and using the toothpick method.  It may be a bit too sweet for some. You can cut back the sugar by a third since the bananas are already sweet.

I did not add the frosting. It was already good on its own.

Very Impressed! I was just shy by approx 1/8 cup banana and aded sour cream to accommodate. These delectable cakes were light and airy and sheer perfection. I made only half the frosting recipe and topped the cakes with a salted hazelnut sprinkle. This recipe is seriously wonderful. thank you very much for sharing it.

This was a good recipe.   It wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, but I think its as close to a cupcake texture as you can get with bananas.  Its definitely not as dense as a bread, but be careful not to overbake it.  My first pan turned out good, the second was in the same time and it turned out a little over done making them drier.  Overall, this one is a keeper...

This recipe is superb. Got it right at first try! However, I had reduced the sugar to 1 cup as I didn't want it to turned out too sweet. The kids just couldn't get enough of it and their friends has been pestering my children to ask me to bake it again. 5 stars for this recipe!

These turned out fabulous!!!! I did as others suggested and replaced the shortening with butter, I used half & half instead of butter milk, I added a bag of choc chunks to the batter, and added a block of regular cream cheese to the frosting. I doubled the recipe and got 30 regular sized cupcakes and baked them for exactly 20 mins. I will be making these for Christmas!!!! Mmmmmm!

This was my first attempt at making homemade cupcakes. This recipe is quick and easy and tastes fantastic! Everyone loved it.   Note: I only frosted half of the cupcakes, because I felt that the frosting wasn't needed, but some people prefer frosted cupcakes.

This recipe is a great way to use up old bananas!  To make the buttermilk I added 1 Tbs. white vinegar to a cup of milk and then just used 1/4 cup of it.  To mash the banana I put two very ripe bananas in a ziplock bag and squished them with my hands.  I then cut off the corner and squeezed out the banana.  I added some cinnamon and nutmeg for extra flavor.  Instead of the frosting given, I made my own cream cheese.

These were good..very delicate. I did add some cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg for extra flavor, but not too much to overpower the banana flavor. I also used some whole wheat pastry flour, which I always do when I can.  I would have given them 5 stars but I added some spice, and I feel that without them, these cupcakes would have neeed more flavor.  I do agree they were moist.  Also, I frosted mine with homemade cream cheese frosting, and I think it may have overpwowered them slightly.  Probably would have been better to just glaze them like the recipe suggested, but I feel like with a cupicake I want more icing.  But with banana, it's different.  They are so light that they do not need a heavy topping.  I now know for next time, if there is one. I might just stick with my favorite banana bread recipe!

Excellent recipe! My friends were all in heaven, and I've had multiple requests for these since. They're definitely a banana cake, like previous reviews said, and not a banana bread, but its the lightest fluffiest banana cake you'll ever have! My only changes were a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg for the cake, along with the extra bananas, and a touch of vanilla and cinnamon for the frosting.

Me and my 2 year old son love making these! They are fun and easy to make! We love them - they are so moist and don't even need the frosting on the top! Definately a 5 star recipe! (Oh, I just use regular milk instead of buttermilk).

The best!  I frost with cream cheese frosting, so just beat in a block of cream cheese to the given frosting recipe!

Despite all the rave reviews, I found this cupcake to be dry and somewhat grainy.  I followed the recipe except to substitute butter for the shortening as the recipe called for. Still, other cooks seemed to have good results with this substitution.  I frosted them with Banana Butter Icing elsewhere on this site and loved the icing.  Perhaps I'll try this again when I have some ripe bananas.

These were so amazing that we had to make a second batch on Sunday after demolishing the first batch we made Friday!  Thanks Wanda!  I used butter instead of shortening, cut the sugar down to 1 c. and added about 3/4 tsp. cinnamon.  I frosted the first batch with a Nutella frosting and made peanut butter frosting for the second batch.  OMG!!!

These were delicious. I prepared exactly as written. This will definitely be my go to recipe for banana cupcakes. The frosting was just the perfect sweetness and I topped with chopped walnuts. Everyone has raved about them!

these were SUPERB. light and fluffy, sweet, with a bit of banana flavor. my usually overly-critical mother said these were the best thing I've ever made. Will DEFINITELY make again.  I should also add that I used regular milk instead of buttermilk, but didn't make any noticeable difference to me. they were still excellent even with that substitution!

these banana cupcakes are BANANAS (a la rachel zoe)!  i did replace the shortening with 1/2 cup butter and lowered the sugar to 1 1/4 cups.  i also replaced 1/4 cup white sugar with dark brown sugar.  i used 2 medium-sized bananas for 1 cup.  they were moist and tasty with a vanilla-malt frosting.  i used my fave vanilla frosting recipe and just added 1/2 cup of malted milk powder.  maybe next time i will roast the bananas.  overall, delicious!!! :)

WOW to say the least.  These worked up quickly and turned out flawlessly.  Good texture and what a great way to use up the extra bananas that I had.  I did not make the icing - and they are cupcakes, not muffins as some have suggested - they are more cake than muffin for sure.

Wow, these are yummy! Ididn't have any buttermilk so like others I used regular milk. I also added about a tsp of cinnamon. I used a honey cinnamon frosting but to tell you the truth, the one I ate right out of the oven with no frosting was great just plain. Really over ripe bananas are the way to go with anything that is requiring bananas, so much more flavor.

These are WONDERFUL! Never thought a banana cupcake could be so tasty, made recipe exactly just in a batch of 24. My kids just LOVED them. Topped them with the "Creamy Chocolate Frosting" recipe from here and they taste like Ben & Jerry's Chunky Monkey ice cream! enough said..lol

These are nice.  I had a banana that desperately wanted a recipe to be in, so I halved this recipe and made a half batch.  My milk was sour so I did use it in the batter but wasn't willing to make the frosting with it.  I drizzled a fudge icing over it instead and it worked well.  The only issue I had was the bake time--I needed an extra 15 minutes, but that's okay.  That's why they make toothpicks!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe for banana cupcakes.  They were moist and delicious.  Be sure to use really ripe bananas for the most flavor.  I used a different recipe for the frosting, but it was similar to this recipe but included coconut flakes.  My family raved about them!

These cupcakes are incredible!  They're still cooling and I couldn't resist writing a review already!  I made the recipe just as is and they came out perfectly.  Note that the tops get rather brown before they are completely done.  I think they would be good even without frosting, but I frosted them with white chocolate buttercream, which is a heavenly addition.  This will be one of my new go-to recipes.

I followed the recipie exactly (well, besides making 12 servings instead of 18) and I thought they were amaaaazing! I LOVED them and wanted to eat them all day haha. But, I have to restrain myself. I iced them with the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" on this site and added some chopped nuts on top and they were amazing. They taste great alone too, though! I'm definitely making these again.

These cupcakes are AMAZING. I'm baking them for my manager's son's 2nd birthday party tomorrow and I'm already so excited about them! I baked my first batch and they taste AMAZING. The only changes I made were using butter instead of shortening and milk instead of buttermilk (didn't have either on hand). I also added just a tiny splash of lemon extract for a little extra umph! It only took them about 13 minutes to bake in my 350 degree oven, so make sure you watch them closely! THEY ARE SO GOOD! Perfect blend of sweetness and banana flavor. I haven't even tried frosting on them and I'm already in love. I plan on using the banana coconut frosting from this website (it's like a banana flavored version of what goes in german chocolate cake) I'll let you know how it goes! **Update 6/20** I ended up baking three batches of these cupcakes for the party coming out with about 70 total (i got a good 24 out each batch as oppposed to the 18 it says). I decided to use three different frostings to give people a choice: Chocolate cream cheese, peanut butter, and Banana nut frosting (all from this website)

The cupcake came out great, although it didn't rise like I expected it to. Probably had old baking soda or powder. The frosting was terrible! Needs some kind of flavoring. I ended up scraping it off!

Absolutely delicious!  I always keep brown bananas in the freezer in case I get inspired to make banana bread, but this recipe might inspire me to make banana cupcakes more often instead!  I frosted these with the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" recipe from this site and they were a huge hit.

Oh man were these ever good! Next time I will fill the tins fuller, as they didn't get quite as big as I would have liked, but they tasted WONDERFUL! I added about 1 cup of chocolate chips, and instead of the icing recipe used here, I made Cream Cheese frosting, as suggested by some previous reviews, and I for sure think that's the way to go. Super tasty!

MMMMMMMMMMMM!!! I put a little green food coloring in the batter for St. Patty's day. For the frosting, instead of butter, I used cream cheese and a touch of vanilla. These are yummy!!
UPDATE. Made these again and doubled the batch. They weren't quite as moist as the first time, but still pretty tasty.

These were the best cupcakes I've ever had. I'm don't like cake that much, but these were the perfect blend of banana bread and cupcake. And the icing, which I'm also not usually a fan of, was the perfect texture and taste. I cut the recipe and made 12 cupcakes, using 3 small bananas. For the icing, I whipped the butter. Then I added 1 tp. vanilla extract along with the other ingredients. I added sprinkles on top because I made them for a birthday. I'll definitely make this one again. Delicious!

These cupcakes are spectacular! The flavor and texture are perfect and they're sweet, but not horribly sweet. I made them using a store-bought chocolate sour cream frosting. The only reason I don't give it the full 5 stars is that I had some trouble with the baking. They did not bake all the way through in the 20 min. They also came out of the oven all puffed up, but about half of them sank in in the middle after cooling. Nothing frosting doesn't help cover, though :) I will certainly make these again! Great recipe!

These cupcakes were very good. I thought they were more of a cake-like muffin. I had 3 overripe bananas and they yielded one cup mashed bananas! I didn't have buttermilk so I used regular milk with a little vinegar. I had to bake them about 5-7 extra minutes. I did not really like the frosting, it had an overwhelming butter taste. Next time I will use a cream cheese frosting.

Yummmmm!!!  My family gobbled up these moist cupcakes.  The only change I made was using almond milk instead of buttermilk.  Turned out perfect.

Meh.  They were alright, but not spectacular.  I was trying the recipe out to possibly use for my son's first birthday party, but my search continues.  I didn't try the icing, just the cupcakes.

Cupcakes came out just a little more "muffiny" than I was hoping for.

I did one batch with dark chocolate chips and one batch plain, by far the chocolate chip batch was the better of the two.

Used a fluffy peanut butter frosting recipe which was very good.

I will use this recipe again but will use my mini loaf pans and serve more as a banana bread.

I will keep searching for a lighter, fluffier banana cupcake recipe.

A good friend of mine who is a caterer said that Bananas in her opinion can "create problems in lots of recipes"

I added mini-chocolate chips and frosted with a dark chocolate buttercream. It was delicious! My only complaint would be that I would have liked them to taste more like banana. But very easy and yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

I used 115g of butter instead of shortening and I didn't have any buttermilk so used 1/4 cup milk with 3/4 teaspoon of white vinegar. Took 23mins at 175 degrees C. Absolutely delicious!!! These are definitely not muffin, bread or even cake like. These are cupcakes - light and delicious. Will make these again and again.

These were very good. I did cut the sugar by 1/4 cup. I cut little cone shapes out of the top of each cupcake & filled with some lemon pudding. I made a home made banana-lemon frosting that my friends love. I just drizzled some on the tops. They were devoured in less that 20 minutes. I love the flavor of lemon & banana. I make a banana cake & split layers & fill with lemon pie filling. When I saw this recipe I thought it would work the same & be less work & it was!

WOW! These are delicious! Great cupcake texture and the banana flavour is a nice addition to what would otherwise be plain ol' vanilla cupcakes. I did substitute 1/4 cup sour cream for buttermilk, but that was the only alteration.

This recipe gives perfect moist semi fluffy/bread texture and rise. Just the way I like cupcakes. I use butter instead of shortening and reduce raw sugar to 1 1/4 c so it won't be too sweet with frosting. It took me a bit longer to bake at 175c. Delicious and will make this again soon. Perfect with peanut butter or chocolate frostings. The original recipe also tastes great without frosting. Thank you!

WOW! I am SOOOOOO surprised at the reaction my kids had. They are not cupcake fans but I made them to the recipe and used basic creamy chocolate frosting(1 C SHORTENING, 2 TSP VANILLA, 4 1/2 C SIFTED POWERED SUGAR, 1/4 C COCO, AND APPRX 1/3 C MILK ADDED 1TBSP AT A TIME) and it was awesome! Will make again and again! Thanks

This was a fantastic recipe just the way it was :) The cupcakes do not need the entire top frosted either! Throw the frosting in a bag, snip the corner and line that way :) Just enough!

I wanted to make a dessert for items I had on hand and found this recipe.  I used 1 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2....probably even a little less than that.  They turned out great.  My family ate them all with or without frosting.  I already had some frosting so I didn't make the one from the recipe.  I also made sure to use ripe bananas and it really had a nice banana flavor.

Fantastic recipe. Very light and fluffy, definitely not a muffin. Substitutions/alterations: instead of 1 1/2 cups of sugar, I used 1 cup of brown sugar as the bananas were quite ripe. I added a touch more banana than the recipe called for and about a tablespoon of extra margarine (instead of shortening). Result: airy gorgeous cake with a prominent banana flavour. Baking time was about 22 minutes for 15 cupcakes.

I made it for my Friend birthday, every one loved it.
Changes I made,
1. with 1/4 cup buttermilk the batter was way dry I used 1full cup of buttermilk.
2.Used butter instead of shortening 
3.used Banana Rum instead of Vanilla 
4. Added chocolate chip which made it very tasty.
5. Used Chocolate Frosting for decoration
I will make it again but I will follow the changes I made.
It was very moist and fluffy very cupcake taste

Originally, I made these substituting butter for shortening. They came out with a dense, banana-bread/muffin crumb, but great flavor.
Made these a second time the next day, substituting cake flour for half of the AP flour (by weight) and these came out with a MUCH lighter, more cake-like crumb. Very good banana flavor.

I agree; these are definitely cupcakes, not muffins. They were very light and airy. Next time I will use 3 bananas instead of two for a stronger taste. Also, try to pick out any black parts of the bananas before adding them into the batter. My cupcakes were filled with little black strings. I frosted them with peanut butter frosting with a chocolate drizzle for delicious Elvis cupcakes!

We thought that the cupcakes themselves were okay.  They did have a nice banana taste and they were a little dense.  The frosting was too buttery so we had to add extra powdered sugar, milk and a teaspoon of vanilla. I probably will not make it again.

I tried this recipe and it turned out fantastic but the loaf seems too compact or dense. Is there something I can do to make it lighter and fluffier?

I used a cup of whole wheat flour and a cup of all purpose flour just to make them healthier.   They turned out fine but you might want to cook them a little less because of the whole wheat flour addition.  I made a cream cheese icing for them and it was excellent.

The icing places these cupcakes over the top! Very good and moist. I added chopped pecans and added to 1/2 of the batter for my husband. He liked them both ways. This is a keeper recipe.

I'm usually a terrible cupcake maker - but this worked out TREMENDOUSLY well! Note that they are definitely cupcakes (not muffins) and I iced with a cream cheese-buttercream icing.

This recipe is definitely for cupcakes, not muffins. I used butter instead of shortening, and they tasted perfectly fine. I do suggest using 1 1/4 cups of sugar, because the second time I made these, I used that amount and they were just as sweet as the first time I made them with 1 1/2 cups. They are not as sweet as regular cupcakes, but then I think the bananas also add some sweetness. I will definitely make these again, and I highly recommend them.

Very good cupcakes! I substituted butter for the shortening, otherwise made it according to recipe. I haven't decided to frost them yet, they are good plain.  I just ate one warm from the oven and it was light and moist. Even though it's a cupcake, it still is similar in flavor to banana bread so hard to tell the difference other than it does seem lighter and fluffier. Still, a nice change! Thanks for the recipe!

I just got done baking these cupcakes and they were delicious. Very moist. I didn't have any cupcake liners so I just used baking spray to spray the cupcake cups and did it that way. So my baking time was around 30-35 minutes. I didn't prepare the frosting because after I tasted the first cupcake, I didn't feel the need to do so. My only concern is that once I make this again is to cut down on the sugar. Ripe bananas are already sweet themselves, so instead of 1 1/2 cups, I'll try 1/2 cup and etc. Overall, this were the bomb banana cupcakes ever!

yum yum yum! these are super tasty! i didn't have any fresh bananas on hand, so i used frozen ones; i'm thinking that's why they are more dense than they should be when i make them. i wouldn't describe them as cupcakes, but i wouldn't say muffins either. it really seems like a banana BREAD in cupcake form. i'm making them for the second time today (they're in the oven) because everyone loved them! i halved the icing amount because i thought it would be too much and even with half i still had a bit leftover. i piped a criss-cross design on it and sprinkled with walnuts. i imagine that with fresh bananas it would be a lot more cupcake-y but with frozen ones, you get a moist, dens-ish cupcake. still SUPER delicious though!

I added chocolate and butterscotch chips to this recipe and used plain milk instead of buttermilk and they were delicious! they took closer to 25 min to cook all the way through and the muffin pans definitely need to be greased REALLY well if you aren't using muffin cups. Other than that they turned out fantastically!!

Pretty good! I did find them a little too sweet, so I omitted the frosting. I added chopped walnuts to mine and chocolate chips to a few of them - both versions tasted good. I agree with another reviewer that they lacked a little bit of something - next time I'll use half brown and half white sugar, which I do with my usual banana bread recipe, and maybe add a pinch of cinnamon. Mine came out fluffy and moist, like a cupcake should be. I'll be playing around with these, they're a good starting off point.

I cut the recipe in half and made mine vegan, used Earth Balance buttery spread instead of shortening, So Delicious coconut creamer instead of buttermilk, for egg I used 3 tbsp hot water and 1 tbsp ground flax (set to rest until gooey like egg white).  It turned out so wonderful I wanted more after the first slice!

Awesome!! I didn't use the frosting listed. I search on this site and used the "fluffy peanut butter" frosting. It was great combining the two together. I made this recipe exactly as it is written and it needs no changes.

This recipe indeed makes 18 moist, delicious banana cupcakes!   I had a bunch of bananas that were about to go bad, so I used them -- super easy to mash. I followed the cupcake recipe to a tee, but used a different frosting for them.

These cupcakes were delicious! I took them to school and my classmates loved them. I would like them to be a little sweeter and banana-y but I am not sure how to tweak the recipe without altering the texture. Will definitely make again!

I used real salted butter instead of shortening, milk with a little vinegar for the buttermilk and about 1/2 cup more bananas.  These cupcakes turned out light, airy and wonderfully delicious!

This was a moist cake but, I didn't get a strong flavor.  It was kinda bland..even with 1 1/2 cups of bananas!  I'll try it again by adding another spice to it and perhaps using brn sugar.

These cupcakes were amazing!  I used two large bananas and added cinnamon.  The higlight, though, was frosting the cupcakes with a cream cheese peanut butter frosting.  You could make homemade (recipe from Bon Appetit); however, I used store bought cream cheese frosting and added creamy peanut butter to taste.  These were the best cupcakes I ever made!

Awesome cupcakes!  I used a cream cheese frosting and drizzled a little caramel.  However, my kids were eathing them with no icing.  They are that good!

These are excellent!  The texture is perfectly light, moist and fluffy.  I added chocolate chips at the end and will ALWAYS do so from now on.  Next time I'll add more banana for a stronger flavor, but otherwise, made as directed.  Needed the full 15 minutes to cook.

I had a second batch in the mixer not 5 minutes after my taste.  I knew these were not going to last.  My cupcakes turned out light, fluffy and simplistically divine.   I am happy to see a recipe that does not need to be tweeked to rate 5 stars.

Holy cow! These were amazing and I don't even care for banana baked goods! I did add a little extra banana however and they sunk so I think I will add a tiny bit more baking powder next time.

Wonderful cupcake recipe!! I used butter instead of shortening and milk instead of buttermilk, because this was kind of spur-of-the-moment and I didn't have any of either on hand, but the cupcakes still turned out really, really well. None survived the night! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a very nice banana cake recipe.  It's a lot like banana bread, but with a more fine texture.  I used butter instead of shortening which worked out great, and I made a different frosting that I thought went well with these- cream cheese, a mashed banana, a little vanilla, and honey to sweeten it.  I love that these have some nutrition in them, but my kids still think it's dessert.  These are really good for breakfast.  Thank you for the recipe!

These are very yummy cupcakes!  I substituted a stick of butter for the shortening and switched the buttermilk for whole milk and they still turned out very tasty.  Didn't try the frosting, but I'm thinking of whipping up a batch of chocolate frosting because I think the combination would be heavenly!

Thank you Wanda!! I made these with my boys(ages 5&7) for my husbands birthday(before the big party with the big cake and big family!) and not only were they easy and fun to make- but they smelled great while they were baking and tasted fantastic! I added a dash of allspice and a few mini choco.chips when I baked the last 6(for the boys) and they were a hit...I used a cream cheese frosting and I left a few without that even and they were still great!! I will be making these again soon! Thanks again!!

These cupcakes (definitely not like muffins) are amazingly delicious!  They are so light and fluffy with just a slight banana taste.  I made a cream cheese buttercream frosting from a cupcake cookbook I have.  Delectable! :)

Great! Had to make some substitutions. I used 1 cup spelt flour, 1/4 cup whole wheat, 1/4 cup all purpose flour. Added 1/2 cup chopped pecans. For the icing I used 1/4 cup ghee, 1/4 cup butter flavor crisco, & 3 tbsp vanilla flavored soy milk. My picky teenaged daughter ate four of them!

decided to try to bake something new.  these cupcakes are wonderful.  i used cream cheese frosting and i think that brings more sweetness to the cupcake.  It isn't that sweet and you can really taste the bananas.  very delicious.

Whoa!  This is cake-like and has a perfect rise for a cupcake.  Top this with peanut butter frosting (also from AllRecipes) and you've got a great combo!  I normally like walnuts with my banana bread, but this cupcake stands well on its own.

Amazing banana bread/cake recipe. I read the reviews before baking it and used only 1 cup of sugar (brown), besides 1 1/2 cups of banana instead of just one. I'm eating a delicious slice for breakfast just now!

These are awesome!  I was looking for a banana cupcake recipe because I had some dead bananas and my mom's birthday is tomorrow.  She loves banana stuff.  She also likes Ben & Jerry's Chunky Monkey ice cream, so I stirred in a bag of chocolate chips and some walnuts, and they are wonderful!  They don't even need icing.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks!

These were so good.  I don't think I've ever had banana cupcakes before.  But I was trying to find something my daughter would like for her first birthday, she loves bananas.  She didn't even touch hers but everyone else loved them.

The cupcakes are phenomenal! They are nowhere near muffin status.  They are light and just sweet enough ( I cut the sugar down to 1 c. because I topped it with a Banana rum buttercream).  They are very much cake like not dense at all like a muffin or banana bread.  They have an excellent banana flavor (the recipe calls for mashed bananas but I pureed them because I didn't want chunks, and that worked out great) Try this recipe you won't regret it!

I was afraid these might turn out muffin-y rather than cake-like... While they weren't super fluffy they definitely weren't muffins (which was good!)  Nice banana flavour too.  I used cake flour (that's what I had) and butter rather than shortening (again because I had it on hand).  Didn't try the icing because I wanted a cream cheese frosting instead. These were popular and I'll definitely make them again!

Instead of the frosting (sugary and buttery) I put some semi-sweet chocolate chips in the batter.  Chunky monkey baby!

Fantastic! Just perfect, nice, subtle flavour, not too sweet, but cupcakey enough. I used an extra 1/4 cup banana, half brown sugar and margerine instead of shortening, and they still turned out great. Will definitely make these again :) I used cream cheese frosting on top from allrecipes

Very nice recipe, but a little too sweet for my liking. I had only one egg, so that's all I used. Next time, I will drop the sugar to one cup. Distinct banana flavor. I plan to use a cream cheese frosting.

This recipes was really yummy.I did find I had to bake them 10 minutes longer than the recommended time.Although I used a little extra banana and some choc chips.I woudn't really call them a cupcake either but more like a muffin.Anyhoo my husband is downing them as we speak.

I made this recipe as directed except for I bought store-made cream cheese frosting.  They came out pretty good, except I just thought they tasted like banana bread poured into muffin cups - nothing real special.  I made them for my son's birthday because he likes bananas and I thought cupcakes sounded fun, but I think it disapointed kids hoping for cupcakes.  I would make this more for muffin-type situations.

So good that you don't need any icing at all. I just added 3/4 c of walnuts because I'm crazy about nuts.

Excellent.  Soft and moist cake.  I didn't have buttermilk so I just added a little vinegar to the milk.  Be sure to use really ripe bananas, the blacker the better for the best banana flavor.  Also replace half the butter with creme fraiche in the frosting.  If I didn't have creme fraiche on hand I would reduce the butter and add cream cheese.   Sprinkle finely chopped and toasted walnut on top.  Yum!

These are amazing! Moist...cupcake texture (not dense at all like bread). Fabluous with chocolate frosting. We made them into sock monkey cupcakes for a baby shower and everyone loved them. Definitely making again!

I followed the recipe except used butter instead of shortening. Came out perfect. Tried one without frosting, it was a little chewy like a muffin. I frosted them with the Creamy chocolate frosting from this site. To us they tasted like little banana cakes with frosting, not true cupcakes.

Had to substitute 1/3 of the sugar with brown sugar since I ran out...will likely repeat this substitute again as they were very tasty!  Also added chocolate chips.  No icing was needed for me to enjoy them fresh from the oven!

Very good cupcakes. I filled two pans. One rose perfectly round and the other deflated. I think the ones that fell were filled a little too high. I frosted them with the Creamy Chocolate Frosting because I absolutely love chocolate and banana together!

This recipe is excellent! I didn't have shortening and buttermilk so I used butter and buttermilk substitute (add vinegar to milk-> 1 tablespoon of vinegar for 1 cup of milk) this recipe asks for 1/4 of buttermilk so you can have an idea.
I will be making again whenever I have more ripe bananas.
Thx for sharing!!!!

These were good, but nothing spectacular.  I made them exactly as written, and they were just missing a little something, maybe some cinnamon, or more banana.  I topped these with banana nut frosting, and then they were pretty close to spectacular.

These are unbelievably delicious!  I was skeptical of banana cupcakes but I am now a believer!  I handed one to my two year old, walked over to get myself one and by the time I got back to him he was holding an empty wrapper yelling "MORE!"  The only thing I may have done differently is to use three large bananas rather than one cup.

Lovely cupcake with good balance in taste. Substituted shortening with butter, apple cider vinegar + milk for buttermilk and reduced sugar to one cup for my family who is rather intolerant of sweets. My cupcakes did take a little longer than 20 mins to be cooked though. Did not make the frosting but used nutella for a twist. Great snack anytime.

Very yummy!! I did not have shortening on hand so I used slightly softened salted butter, then cut back a bit on the salt. Also read other reviews and I did cut back some on the sugar.   I needed a larger amount of cupcakes so I made 1 and a half times the recipe; I got 21 nice sized cupcakes.   I ate one before frosting it, and they are delicious even on their own. Definitely a cake-like texture, not muffin-y.   Thanks for a great recipe! I will definitely make this again, when I need banana cupcakes.

These cupcakes were very easy to make and the flavor was okay.  I didn't change anything with the recipe or the frosting.  My husband made a comment that the flavors of the frosting and the cake didn't really go together and I agreed.  Maybe chocolate would have been better.

This recipe is amazing! The cupcakes are light to begin with, but to make them even lighter I used half all-purpose flour and half cake flour. I highly recommend this recipe!

xx thinkpink xo is exactly right.  Mediocre variation of banana bread with very sweet frosting.

These cupcakes are amazing!  I'm a spice freak so I always add cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves (as much as I'm in the mood for).  Also, I was out of vanilla one day and used orange extract instead--they turned out great!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Delicious!  I made half of the batch with chocolate chips and half without.  Both versions were amazing, but the banana flavor really comes through on the version without chocolate chips.  The chocolate chips almost overpowered it a little.  I'll definitely make these again!
