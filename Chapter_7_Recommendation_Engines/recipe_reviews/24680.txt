Yum!! I will definitely use this as my rib recipe. I tweaked it quite a bit because I had to use what was left in my cupboards. I substituted tomato sauce for the diced tomatos, brown sugar for the molasas, lemon juice for the lemons, and BBQ sauce for the Worchestire. I simmered them for only 1 hour and 15 minutes before cooking them in the oven because my ribs were boneless. They were so tender & the sauce was perfect. Thanks for sharing this!

Unreal, myself and friends indulged in many pounds of these ribs, during a canadian summer where we indulge in beer, this recipe scored high marks among everyone in attendance.

this is recipe can be done quicker if you do the ribs in a slow cooker overnight
 on low for 10 to 12 hours and than put them in the oven for the rest of your
 cooking time. the sauce can be done in another slowcooker
 for a few hours befor the ribs are out of their slowcooke. than you do the rest 
of the cooking time like the recipe says in the oven

These ribs turned out great!  It was the first time I had made ribs, and simmering them in the beer mixture gave them a wonderful flavor.  I just used a bottled barbeque sauce, but at some point I'm going to make the one listed here.  Bit hit with the husband.

Simmering the ribs for 2 hours resulted in something more like pulled pork for me rather than actual ribs you could pick up with your hands.  But this is a great and very tasty recipe!  I'd make it again, but I'd boil the ribs for less time.  Very yummy!

While simmering in beer may be an good idea, 2 hours is too long and the meat resembled crock pot meat which is mushy as opposed to tender and the flavor was cooked out of the pork. Sweet Baby Ray saved them.

Very tender (even before 2-1/2 hours cook time), and faster to prepare/cook than some of the other rib recipes that require marinating overnight or 3-hour cook times.

This is one of my family favorites.  It does not matter if its ribs or what we call "farmer ribs" (no bones).  I like the sauce coming from scratch and not out of a bottle.  I did substitute the ketchup with tomato sauce that we can ourselves.  I leave out the hot sauce and use our canned tomatoes with peppers instead, so I think the kick is the same.  My family LOVES this, and ribs is about one of the last things they want, even if the meat was raised by us and all organic.  We don't keep beer around, so I have used really good beers and have borrowed a cheap one from a neighbor.  It still turns out great.  My children thank you.  :)

This recipe is wonderful. Try changing beer flavors for the different seasons of the year. In winter I use a Bourbon barrel beer to give the ribs a more hearty flavor, and light beer in the summer then use the grill instead of the oven. My family loves when I make these ribs. Experiment with the beer flavor according to your own taste. I personally stay away from the ones that have any fruit flavor other than lemon or lime when using them for cooking.

Very good recipe.  I like my sauce a little sweeter so I added some brown sugar to taste.

These were easy and excellent.  I actually made one slab with this recipe and one using a crock pot method.  the crock pot ribs were mealy.  These were perfect.  The bbq sauce looks odd and my kids didn't want to try it at first, but they liked it once they did.  It has a great taste, not overly sweet.  A keeper!

I made it with a different sauce, and I used 2 bottles of beer.

But wow, the meat is falling off onto my plate leaving a clean bone behind!!!!! These are the best ribs I've ever had in my life! Thank you

I've been making the ribs like this for quite some time.  I use my own bbq sauce that I make, but I use this method for the ribs and OMG they are fantastic!  I use all beer and simmer them for 2 hours before putting them in the oven to finish them off and the meat just falls off the bone.  They are so delicious!  Thank you.

Great for guests.  Always a hit...tasty & tender fall off the bone.  I have made with store-bought bbq sauce which also tastes great but I prefer to use the BBQ sauce here.  My husband loves these and no longer orders ribs at restaurants.

I adapted this recipe for (oven) pulled BBQ chicken. (I'd never made it before so I really appreciated the help from the original recipe & from the reviewers.)

I marinated the chicken in beer for about an hour, then simmered it in the beer/water mix described here for a little over an hour. I used a bottled BBQ sauce, but added some lemon juice and dehydrated onions. Then I used the pan I'd seared the chicken in to brown some garlic. Then I added the sauce and simmered it for about 1/2 hour.

Then I covered the chicken with the sauce and baked at 200 for almost an hour. I shredded the chicken and mixed it up with the sauce.  It turned out FANTASTIC and I will use this again in the future.

I added a teaspoon of liquid smoke and was rewarded with spare ribs that tasted as good as the real deal. And my grill was not going to be fired up today with snow on the ground, I'm not that hard core. 
And don't just dump that braising liquid, I peeled some potatoes and boiled them in it while the meat was in the oven. Best boiled spuds ever!

We cooked these ribs up on a Sunday afternoon and they were delicious.  Our 1 year old is a very picky eater and she was screaming for more when we let her taste them.

Wonderful ribs for a cold and rainy day. The kids usually won't eat homemade ribs and with this recipe 5# wasn't enough.

The ribs cooked up nicely in the crockpot (loved the beer addition!).  We just weren't too crazy about the BBQ sauce that went over them.  They would have been better just using a bottled brand.  Sorry.

I too cheated with what I had on hand, bottled bbq sauce, beer, dehydrated onion. These directions were easy and I agree that the beer was a great idea. Our ribs were terrific. Our picky children loved them. After they were finished cooking, I did stick them under the broiler for a quick coloring, about 5 minutes, it colored the bones up really nice. Thank you!

Love this recipe. I've made it several times and it always turns out great. (Especially when it's cold out).
