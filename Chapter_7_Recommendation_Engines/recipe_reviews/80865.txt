I thought this would be yummy but I was severely disappointed-the only change I made was halving it, and it turned out terrible.  They didn't hold together at all, and I even added more bread crumbs.  Will not make again.

I amended the recipe a bit by using the whole egg instead of just the white and, I used dry bread crumb. They were surprisingly good.....

Seems like a lot of work, but had a great taste. Definately "Fry", no baking.

I was quite disappointed in this. Something didn't taste quite right, I think it may of been the cumin. I doubt I'll attempt to make this a different way. If so I'd absolutely add more corn, and consider baking!

These needed more of the spices. Once I added an extra egg and then flour just to get them to stick together, they had very little taste. Will add more of the spices next time. 2nd try will be better.

I used the whole egg and left out the sour cream. These were pretty tasty but I agree they could use more of the seasoning. If your cakes are too wet to stay together at first, stick them in the fridge for an hour or either the freezer for 20 minutes and that will firm them so they won't crumble. while cooking.
