This recipe is almost identical to a sandwich I had at a local cafe the other day. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think you need to pound the chicken breasts before grilling them. The sandwiches were HUGE and were really hard to eat, as is. Also, I would recommend pureeing the avocado and using it as a spread with the mayo. I will definitely use this recipe again and Thank you!

I marinate the chicken breasts before grilling. . .I've used honey mustard vinaigrette, Italian dressing, and Caesar dressing (not at the same time!)
and all add fab flavor and juiciness to the chicken.  I serve on honey wheat buns, also. . . just a little more "YUM" factor than white buns.  All three of my picky daughters love these sandwiches, and they are E-Z to prepare.  Gourmet-tasting sandwich with only drive-thru effort. Yay!!

This recipe was 5 stars with just a few minor changes!!  Add some bacon - it is so delicious on this sandwich!  Also, the avocado can be mashed up with the mayo to make a delicious spread(easier to eat that way).  We use a little less mayo and add some garlic powder to the spread mixture.  YUM!

This was great!  I added a little chilli powder to the chicken before grilling (I used my grill pan) for a little extra punch.  Instead of mayonnaise, I mashed the avacado with garlic salt and lemon juice, and spread it on the bun.  We loved it!

Fantastic! This recipe is so easy to make and delicious. I've made it as called for many times, but when I'm in a hurry, (for two ppl) I coat the one piece of chicken in olive oil, then liberally sprinkle course kosher salt and pepper on each side. Then I lightly sprinkle garlic powder and onion powder on (skipping the carmelized onions), and sautee until done. Warning, this can get a little smokey. I let the chicken cool for about 5 minutes and cut the chicken in half, lengthwise. I put cheese on each piece and microwave briefly (no more than 30 seconds, you don't want to dry the chicken out). Cover lightly with foil to let the steam melt the cheese the rest of the way. For the spread, I mash the avocado and lemon juice with a little less than a teaspoon of garlic salt, and leave out the mayo. Spread the avo-mix on four slices of bread/bun and microwave for 10 seconds to warm the spread and soften the bread. Assemble each sandwich with one half of the chicken, then spinach (or arugula or lettuce) and top with some thin slices of tomato if desired. I've made this a lot and it's a keeper! So good, I highly recommend this recipe.

As written, this is a 4 star recipe, I made it quite different.  I made true guacamole (added garlic, roma tomato, lime juice not lemon, onions), I also marinated the chicken in basalmic vinegar and emeril chicken rub.  I didn't add mayo and I did add some bacon.  Yum!

Delish! Only change I made was omitting the mayo as I'm not a big fan of it, and I figured the avocados would lend enough creaminess.  Served it on white, toasted hamburger buns, but I think it would be even better on a multigrain bun.  That's how I'll make it next time, and there will be a next time.  This one is a keeper!
Just a note...I noticed that the total prep and cook time was 1-1/2hours.  No, no, no....only took maybe 30 min. to pull this meal together.  :)

I love the carmelized onions on top! I gave the avocados a light mash just to make them easier to eat.

I've made these both on the grill and in the broiler and no matter the season they are great!  I will suggest, though, that you try and either get thin chicken breasts or use a meat tenderizer to pound them flatter.  Otherwise the sandwich can be difficult to eat!

Sooooo Good!  A very mild but fresh and natural taste.  We used fresh Italian bread instead of hamburger buns. YUM!

This was a perfect taste of summer.  I don't have a grill, or even a place to put one, so I did the whole thing on the stove.  

Whoever said to include bacon was 100% correct.  I cooked the bacon, then left the grease in the skillet and cooked everything else in the bacon grease.  As the chicken was close to done, I stacked onions, bacon and then cheese on top of the breast and let the cheese melt.  

Like others, I combined the mayo and avocado, plus some garlic powder, for a creamy, tangy finishing touch.  

As for the chicken itself, I took one chicken breast and cut it in half so that I had 2 thin chicken patties (only made 2, just me and my husband).  I then lightly sprinkled seasoned salt on both sides of the chicken.  I think seasoning provides a little more interest to the flavor without overpower the other flavors in the "burger."  I'm sure garlic powder, cajun seasoning or adobo powder would all work well too.  Cooked in the bacon grease, the chicken was so juicy and flavorful.  

I served it with sweet potato fries, corn on the cob and raw broccoli.  It totally hit the spot.

I knew the chicken would need more than salt and pepper so I seasoned with Greek seasoning and a little garlic powder.  Next time will use melted butter on the buns instead of using mayo as the sautéed onions made the sandwich quite slippery.

This is similiar to my recipe, which serves 2: Toast 4 slices whole-grain bread. Spread slices with combined 2 tablespooons blue cheese & 2 tablespoons mayonnaise. Divide thinly, diagonally-sliced grilled chicken breast; 4 slices, crisply cooked & drained bacon; 1/2 avocado, thinly sliced; onion & lettuce between the two sandwiches.  The way you make the sandwich is just a matter of personal taste and improvision.

So good!  I loved this one...I actually seasoned my chicken breasts with a BBQ seasoning blend by McCormick...and cooked them in a dry non-stick skillet (very tasty)....I also used red onion instead of vidalia and whole wheat sandwhich thins toasted (by Arnold)....I also used olive oil mayo which I love....cuts the fat and calories way down. May I also mention that I think I bought the best avacado ever....it was perfectly ripe and very creamy in texture and tasted great sprinkled with lemon juice. This sandwhich rocked out and I really loved the flavors. Provolone was a great cheese of choice for this as well.....will make again...Thanks!

I love these.  Have been making them over a year now and realized i should rate the recipe!!  I make them pretty true as written, but have also done them without the avocado (sometimes i can't get them ripe from the grocery on day of cooking) and sometimes without the onion (i forgot....).   Sometimes i use good quality buns, sometimes basic cheap-o burger buns. Tonight, I am frying bacon to go on top and will caramelize the onions in the bacon grease.  They are very delicious any way.  Thank you for the recipe!!

Edited to add ~ I do butterfly the chicken breasts and trim into appropriate sandwich shapes before grilling. Please, don't assume this chicken needs marinated or seasoned beyond the recipe. The flavors come together into something quite amazing. By all means, season or marinate if you must but there is nothing bland about this sandwich!

My rating has more to do with my substitution than the recipe itself.  USE AVOCADO!  I grabbed some avocado spread instead and although it was not bad, this sandwich would have been MUCH better with real avocado.  The idea is great and the chicken was too, but sometimes leaving well enough alone is worth the extra time and effort it may take.

UPDATE 07/2012:  We had this again the other night and made them with avocado slices.  I upgraded my rating from 3 stars to 4.  It was DEFINITELY worth the small effort it takes!

This was really good-plus easy and quick. I used thin-cut chicken breasts, which cooked fast and fit on the hamburger bun. I served coleslaw as a side.

Oh soooo good! I've even grilled in January in the northwest amid the snow to get this just as called for in recipe!  We use a loaf of fresh Italian bread to make the sandwiches instead of rolls.  My new favorite quick and easy dinner, goes great with s beer!

Fantastic recipe.  I don't use mayonnaise, but it was perfectly good without it.  Next time I'm going to try to put some ranch on it and see what happens.

Very good overall, but between the provolone cheese + mayo + avocado + butter used, I found it to be seriously (bordering on sickeningly) rich if you don't watch your portions. It's actually a fairly healthy recipe just based on ingredients, but the fat content is astronomical. I recommend this recipe, but I'd suggest going light with the mayo and slicing the avocado pretty thin on each burger.

This was really good. The only thing I changed was I used swiss cheese instead of provolone and I added potabella mushrooms to the onions. I also skipped the mayo, with the avocados i didn't think it was necessary, and I didn't miss it anyway.

A regular favorite at my house.  Definitely pound the chicken.  Add bacon, and swap provolone for pepper jack for a flavorful occasional twist.

These sounded so basic I couldn't see what the big deal was, but I'm so glad I made them anyway. The mix of sweet onion, provolone and avocado is amazing! My hsuband is a big beef guy, but even he fell in love with these. It's not summer anymore, but I'll make 'em on the George Foreman for sure :)

These were yummy. I also processed the avo and mayo toether until smooth. Unfortunately when it came time to cook it, my computer wouldn't log on to the net so I couldn't really remember all the recipe. I did season the chicken breasts with McCormick's garlic season salt and layerd my bread roll as: avo and mayo spread, vintage cheese, slices of tomato, salt and pepper, chicken and a swirl of mayo and more avo and mayo spread on the other side of the roll. So, I guess I forgot the onion. I'll have to try it that way next time. Hubby loved these! In fact, I will be making these quite often. They are fabulous.

These were wonderful!  I loved all the flavors going on.  We put a little bit of balsamic dressing on the chicken as it was grilling, just to add extra flavor.  We only made two sandwiches but used a whole (Walla Walla) onion.  I loved the carmelized onion!  Everything was great.  We had them on large, crusty hoagie rolls.  I tried to find whole wheat ones, but couldn't.  That would have made them even better!  I don't think these would fit on regular hamburger buns... most chicken breasts are pretty bit.  We had these with Easy Arugula Salad, from this site, and a bowls of fresh mixed berries.

This sandwich was so good. I cooked the chicken in a skillet because it was raining out and also melted the cheese over it before adding the avocado. Very tasty, will definitely make again!!!

I loved this recipe! The only change I would make is to use line with the avocado instead of the lemon juice. I did alter the recipe with the following changes. I marinated and pounded the chicken breast in an Italian dressing, honey, rice vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce and sauté'd them in bacon grease. ( I added bacon as suggested by many other reviewers). For the avocado spread, I used one fresh avocado,  juice of two lemons, cilantro, and about a tablespoon of miracle whip. Next time I will use guacamole and add jalapeños cause the hubs likes it spicy! I served this with fresh corn on the cob and homemade fries. Awesome! This is a keeper.

This was as good, if not better, than a chicken sandwich you would get in a restaurant. We followed the recipe exactly. We used hamburger buns from the bakery department.

Really a big hit with family, but I did the following: 1)mashed the avocado and mixed with lemon juice, 2)seasoned the chicken breasts with garlic powder, s&p, 3) lightly buttered the buns and toasted in oven, 4) sautéed Chicken in skillet (our grill is broken), after the onions had been caramelized in it. Other than that I followed the recipe. Would give it 4.5 stars actually.

Just about any way you choose to prepare these, they are delicious summer fare! The way I generally make these is to marinate my thin-sliced chicken breasts in a garlic vinaigrette and season them to taste. Lightly toasted onion buns thrown on the grill are fabulous! On the other side of the grill, I grill the onions (either Vidalia or Maui sweet) which have been tossed in a bit of canola oil and a sprinkling of sea salt and pepper in a foil packet. Sometimes I make the avocado spread, sometimes I use thinly-sliced avocado. I love mine with a little butter lettuce as well. Use whatever kind of cheese you like; it's all delicious! I generally serve with a side of sweet potato fries or a fresh bean or pasta salad. Bon Appetit!

Everything works together really well! I made homemade guacamole and spread it on instead of just laying slices of avocado. It was a good little switch and the flavors really popped.

Really good. I also didn't make the avacado spread and instead layered the avacado on top like it is in the picture. I squeezed lemon juice on to the chicken right before I added the cheese. I didn't use mayo and instead used mustard.

Really good! I only had cooked shredded chicken from leftovers and cooked it with the onion slices (which, by the way, I used red ones because they were the only sweet onions I had).  I also left out the cheese, as I thought the mayo and avocado were hearty enough (personal preference).  I also added a touch of chili powder to give these a more southwestern flavor and served with with a green salad.  This is a good recipe for chicken burgers!

Yes, yes, yes! Summer gets too boring with the standard all-beef burger. These burgers are savory as they are unique and a bit sweet to the taste. I would skip the mayo next time, but that may just be my taste.

This burger was great! Even my brother said he loves it, after telling me he wanted his without the avocado or onions (of course, I said no!). I used ground chicken burgers instead and like another reviewer said, I mixed the avocado and mayo (I only used about 1 tbsp) to make a spread. It came out great, but next time I'll probably add bacon to give it just a little bit of oomph. Thanks!

Perfect summer meal with great flavor that's very easy to throw together but has a gourmet feel! We loved it! My fiance doesn't like avocado but still loved it without too! P.S. We threw Havarti cheese on and it was delicious!

Absolutely delicous!  Made for lunch today.  I followed MOLLE888's advice and put the avacodo and mayo in the food processor and blended together as a spread.  Used only 3 tbsp. of mayo (preference) and kept everything else as written.  Wonderful...thanks

These burgers were quite tasty. Messy and gooey. Next time I would omit covering the avacado with water as I found it made it go a little bit slimy but other than that very good.

I made these for family and they were great!  The second time I made them, I did split the chicken breast halves long ways to make thinner strips, and I made homemade Guacamole. CRAZY GOOD!

Used Keywest Chicken (made from this site) that was left over from last night. I am a huge fan of avacados  - combined with the other ingredients  - fantastic! What an easy delisious sandwich.

Delicious!!! These were easy and came out great! We did forget to put the provolone on but they were still very tasty. We'll definitely be making them again.

Made these last night, were very tasty. I am quite new to avacado and didn't understand where the water comes in or why it has to be covered. I thought the lemon juice kept it from browning

This recipe is great just as it is written.  Yesterday I had fresh pineapple so instead of the sauteed onions I used a slice of grilled pineapple on each sandwich.  Not only saved an extra pan but was a  delicious twist!  I like it both ways and will always use the pineapple if I have it on hand.

This was pretty good - I followed the suggestions and marinated my chicken breasts in a balsamic vinegar/olive oil/herb bath after pounding them, and mashed the avocado with the lemon juice and a bit of mayo to make a spread.  I found the avocado spread way too slippery - it made the burger hard to eat - and the burger overall was okay but felt like it was missing something. It was sort of blah.  Next time I'll add bacon, which I think is sort of cheating because you can add bacon to pretty much any meat dish and people will automatically like it more, but maybe it's what this burger was missing.
It was just too much messy blah-ness on its own... This would make killer mini burgers though.

We used the George Foreman, pounded down the chicken, and put in for 5 minutes. Then followed the rest of the recipe exactly and LOVED it!  Tasted better than one you would get in a restaurant!

I am giving this 5 stars because I took the advice of others and changed somethings....

I marinated pounded chicken breasts in Newman's Own Light Caesar dressing... I mashed the avocado with some lemon and then mixed it with mayo instead of slicing it, and I topped it with bacon.

I also had muenster cheese on hand, so that is what I used in place of provolone.

These sandwiches were AWESOME.  My entire family (even 3 and 5 year olds) LOVED this.

These sandwiches are 5 stars!  I cooked the onions first and then added them and the cheese to the chicken while it was still on the grill. Added a little kick to it by mixing together mayo and chipolte sauce.

Very simple for first time chiefs and when teaching young ones about seasoning proportions. Honestly, for the salt and pepper, I decided to use Member’s Mark Himalayan Pink Salt and McCormick Gourmet Collection Crushed Red Pepper for not only the benefits, but the AMAZING flavor. I also liked how many of the things in the ingredients were very easy to obtain, and by the looks of the reviews, the ability to be flexible and add your own personal secret ingredient.  I really liked it! KEEP GOING!

I read the reviews before making this dish. I recommend marinating the chicken first (I used Italian dressing) then grilling it. I also combined the avocado, lemon juice and mayo into a spread which was less messy than dealing with the avocado slices falling out of the sandwich. I also recommend cooking bacon and adding it to the sandwich. My husband and I love this recipe and have added it to our recipe book.

Delish! The caramelized onions are milder than raw and they add a nice flavor. I love avocado and cheese on anything, so this was a no-brainer for me. I fried the chicken instead of grilling it, making sure it was nice and browned on both sides, then sauteed the onions in the chicken leavings.  I used sliced and toasted ciabatta rolls instead of hamburger buns and added Dijon mustard, lettuce, and tomato to make it complete. Hubby and I loved these sandwiches -- I'm definitely making them again!

The only change I made was to mash and mix the avocado with 2% Greek yogurt and did pound the chicken thinner.
The flavor of the sandwich was excellent. Easy and delicious.

I added bacon cooked from my cast iron skillet on top of the BBQ grill, then sautéed onions and bell peppers, cause bacon makes everything better   : )

My husband and I loved this recipe! I just smashed up the avocado and left out the lemon. Tried it without caramelizing the onions... MUCH better caramelized! I used  thin sliced chicken breasts from the grocery store and I highly recommend doing that! Also I used whole wheat buns. VERY yum & easy!

A great substitute for burger night.  I changed the lemon to lime and added a little freshly chopped cilantro to the avocado soak.  I marinated extra thin cut chicken breasts in  an olive oil, honey, lime cilantro mix.  Also used ciabatta bread instead of regular buns and browned them on the grill.  Probably a little bland without marinating the chicken first.

This has become one of our favorite meals. We omit the buns. I layer everything on the chicken, mayo first, onion, avocado and then the cheese. I let the cheese melt a little before serving.

Everyone  really loved this. The only changes  I made is marinated my chicken in Italian dressing 8 hrs before grilling and sauteed my onions in olive oil and a little brown sugar. Smashed avocado with lemon juice and dash of salt for spread forgot the provolone cheese though, will add next time because I will definitely make again.

Turned out great. I marinated the chicken in teriyaki sauce and cooked it on the George Foreman grill. Wonderful.

Delicious! Don't skip the simple step of placing buns on grill for a short time. It really adds to the wonderful textures of this sandwich.  I followed the recipe, but did add bacon. My husband, father in law and kids age 5,8 & 11 all loved it. Thank you for this crowd pleasing SIMPLE recipe!

Wow. We marinated our chicken in lemon pepper marinade. That's the only change. Very good recipe. It was not eaten right away, but I prepared everything ahead of time and made sandwiches for lunch at work.

Pretty good chicken burger. I pounded the chicken flat before & all whisked up some honey, Dijon mustard, olive oil, & some vinegar for a marinade before grilling. Did the cheese , onion,avacado & provolone as recipe calls to. Uncle bens basmati rice, Caesar salad & dinner was done.

I made this for Father's Day and it was a hit.
I always pound my chicken breasts flat so they cook evenly on the grill. I patted the breasts dry and marinaded them in lime juice for an hr. This recipe is very yummy and summery!

We used ciabatta bread instead of hamburger buns - I highly recommend this substitution. We also lightly coated the chicken in a sweet mustard sauce and caramelized the onions. Delicious is the only word for this meal.

Excellent chicken burgers! I added extra avacado and I left off the onion and used swiss cheese instead of provolone, because that's what I had on hand. I'll definitely make these again.

I've made these a couple times now and they are delicious!!   Definitely need to pound the chicken out.  I also mash up the avocado (w/ a little lime juice and garlic powder) and use it as a spread and leave the mayo out all together.
