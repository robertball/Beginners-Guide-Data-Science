We make this for Thanksgiving morning. It is so yummy and convenient. Because everyone doesn't wake up at the same time it's still hot whenever they are ready to eat. Also, we are freed up from cooking and cleaning up from breakfast, and can start Thanksgiving dinner. Love it.

I made this last year for Christmas eve morning & it turned out good. Easy to make & it's ready when you wake up! The only thing I'd change is to use half of the potatoes it calls for.

Put all the ingredients in the crock pot late Christmas night, so we could all wake up to breakfast already done.  First I noticed the smell.  Then I tasted a small piece, and I thought it was awful!!!  Bad smell and no flavor.

For being so simple, it turned out really good! My BF said it was a 5 stars because he loved it! He had it for supper last night, lunch and supper today as well (being as how it made a lot) and he wasn't complaining! lol The only change I think I might make to it next time is to add some veggies, like green or sweet peppers, onions, etc. Thanks for the recipe!

This was great! It was no work at all to set it up and made for an awesome start of the day the next morning. Maybe it was my cooker but I felt I needed to add more eggs than the recipe called for. Will try that next time!
