I found this meal easy and good...I had some Tyson pre grilled and cubed chicken I used to make it a faster meal...also I would probably have used about 1/4t plus 1/8t of the chili powder next time the kids thought it was too spicy or maybe sub reg chili powder...I sevres it with Spanish rice and it fit well :)

My mistake for using a recipe using soup for the sauce.  Tasted really processed, did not think it was spicey at all.  Will not make again.
