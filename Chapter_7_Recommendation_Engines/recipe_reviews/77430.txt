Heaven! Only change I made was substituting brown sugar (approx 2T) for the Splenda.  I'm just not a big fan of artificial sweeteners.  And don't you dare serve this over some cheap brand of vanilla ice cream!  I served it over Haagen Daaz vanilla and this dessert is to die for and couldn't be easier and quicker to make.  Even my kids loved it!

Oh my - I love strawberries and I love balsamic vinegar, but never thought of the two paried together! This is a really great dessert that's so simple and yet a bit on the elegant side. Not to mention it's low fat!!!

Great recipe.  I added a little more Balsamic to the strawberries and they were great.  We put them in crepes for breakfast.  Very easy to make.

Didn't cook this on the stove so I didn't use the butter. Used regular sugar and a little more balsamic vinegar. Fabulous! My kids loved them just as they were and I didn't get to put them over ice cream.

I'm giving this 4 stars because it has a lighter more delicate yet "proper" strawberry taste without the butter.  Just let the cut strawberries marinate in the balsamic vinegar long enough (few hours).  We like it with vanilla yogurt.

yum!  I used organic raw sugar,  no butter...  and no HEAT!  Instead I added about 3 tbsp of very good aged balsamic, sliced the berries evenly on the mandolin, and let them sit in the fridge for a couple of hours.  They made their own wonderful syrup.  I almost dont want to bother with the ice cream!   I'm thinking that investing in the "good" balsamic makes he difference here - and allows the sauce to be rich and thick without the addition of butter.   I'm going to be eating this all summer!

Simply Delicious. I used 1/4 cup sugar. My family loved it. The Balsamic vinegar gives it an exquisite flavor but doesn't taste like vinegar. Highly recommended.

I've made Strawberries and Balsamic Vinegar sprinkled with a little Spenda (or real sugar) for my non-diabetic friends.  

This stuff is amazing.  Sweet tart.  Really brings out the flavour of the berries.

I really wanted to try this recipe because I love fruit mascerated in Balsamic Vinegar. I used White Balsamic Vinegar in this because I received the bottle shown in the picutre from Avon and Ivon. I think it also kept the strawberries a natural red color. This is a very yummy, low calorie dessert and I will make again. Four star rating because I felt the strawberries broke down too much. Don't know if it is me or what. I would have liked for them to a littel more firm. But, this DID NOT affect the taste. Just the texture.

I used ordinary white sugar for this and it was wonderful. The strawberry flavour was intensified by the warm sugar/vinegar glaze. It doesn't taste like vinegar at all so don't be afraid to try it.

You can use real sugar with this if you want. Delicious! Everyone I make it for loves it. There have been some pretty picky taste buds too.

This recipe sounded a bit adventurous so I decided to surprise my husband with a new, tasty treat for dessert.  I was a bit disappointed though.  I bought a nice bottle of balsamic vinegar - as other reviewers suggested, but to me the flavors didn't meld as well as I was hoping they would.  I might try to make this again in the future, but it is not on my list of favorites.

I found the butter was important in making a syrup, contrary to what some reviews have suggested.  A quick splash of balsamic and 2-3 tablespoons of sugar is all you need to bring out the sweetness and tartness of the berries.

Awesome flavor combo! Don't use the cheapest basamic out there! Use a mid level price range one. 2nd time I let the sauce cool before adding over ice cream. First round was too soupy for us. I also added 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar instead of Splenda, and we doubled the sauce ingredients for serving over ice cream, pound cake, or french toast. Yummy!

fast, simple and delish. Next time would double the "sauce" for drizzling. For Valentines Day I put the frozen yogurt and strawberries over a chocolate brownie.

How wonderful to find this recipe.  Just last week we had this same dessert at a restaurant.  I can hardly wait to buy strawberries and make this at home.  Thanks Denmozz.

These are fantastic.  Don't worry about getting measurements exactly right; its the kind of recipe with a lot of wiggle room.  I just chopped in what looked like a T of butter, poured in what looked like the right amount of sugare, and then a shot of basalmic vinegar and simmered it up.  Not sure exactly how many strawberries; I just put in what I had left in my 'fridge.  Easy, easy, fantastic, fantastic.  My husband raved about it.  Will make these again and again, especially for an easy desert if we have guests.

The best ice cream topper! I had to use frozen berries this time but was amazing! Toped the dish with cornflakes toasted in butter and brown sugar. Warmed granola would have been great to. Thanks!

I made this with a bit less butter and used light butter. I also used real sugar. I really like balsamic and strawberries, but I don't think I like them enough together to make again. It did have a nice zip to it, though. I think I just like strawberries in the raw! :) Thanks.

Just made it and it's AMAZING!  If you're watching your sugar intake, as I am, the splenda works just fine. You don't taste the sourness of the vinegar at all =)

I was looking for a recipe for a fruit sauce for my french toast and I came across this one.  So it worked for the toast, I substituted vanilla extract for the balsamic and also didn't have enough strawberries so I used frozen raspberries for half of the fruit.  It turned out amazingly yummy.  Put it over french toast and sprinkled some powdered sugar over it.  Delicious!  Can't wait to try it with the balsamic.

Great idea!  It gave me an idea to make this with really good aged fig balsamic vinegar, left out the butter, used sugar and instead of cooking let the strawberries sit in the refrigerator for a couple of hours...yummo! I made strawberry shortcakes with it. On my way to the store for Haagen daz.

This is an awesome treat. I added some honey nut cereal topping as a crunch and honey to it. Then topped it with redi whip. This is addicting.

This recipe is awesome. Made them last night and my guest kept saying "OMG" with each spoonful. Your eyes close automatically as you eat these :) I fully agree with the reviewer that said "Don't you dare use some cheap ice cream."  Do yourself and your guests a big favor and use top quality french vanilla or vanilla bean ice cream. I made them when I was ready to serve dessert in order to prevent having to heat them up. Will definitely make these again. My friends will insist on it.

Substitute the Sucrolose with a bit of Real Maple Syurp with the balsamic, Strawberries never tasted so good. Its all I ever use now when preparing Strawberries, better for you too.

you're better off with a little less fine sugar (confectioners" if it must be powdered, or Blue Agave Syrup if not. I like this recipe.

This was pretty good but I probably wont make again only because not very many here like strawberries on their ice cream.  The balsamic really does enhance the flavor of the strawberries and you can not taste the vinegar.  I used regular sugar as we do not use diet products in our house.

Amazing! Who'd a thunk it, it was so good that instead of being a serving for 4 it was just barely enough for the 2 of us. No guilty feeling at all if you eat it without the ice cream. For a desert I would serve it with the ice cream as a snack, just the  dressed up berries on their own .  Very very good  thankyou for the recipe.

Divine!  As a diabetic, I appreciated the upfront inclusion of Sucralose, which is all I use. It's so good, I can't wait for peach season as I think the sauce would go well with those too.  As it is, it's a  great solution to what to do with all the strawberries I buy on sale that go bad so quickly.  If blueberries are on sale, I'll include some too.

So good on ice cream.  I thought the balsamic would be powerful, but wasn't.  I think less sugar will be used next time.  A great dessert if you want something fast & different.

Delicious! I used brown sugar instead because I don't like or carry Splenda-type sugars. I scooped some ice cream, along with these strawberries, inside of a tortilla bowl -- marvelous!

I first tried this about a year ago, using 2 tbsp real sugar - sucrolose is a migraine trigger for me.  I also topped it with just a touch of fresh cracked pepper (one turn of the mill per serving) and it was heavenly. I know it sounds odd, but it really did jazz it up quite a bit! It's my favourite way to serve strawberries (either heated as per recipe or just macerated)

This was very tasty, but the butter was unnecessary and there is too much sweetener for my taste. I used about a third of the Splenda that the recipe called for, and it was plenty sweet. Actually, I would cut it further next time and do equal parts balsamic vinegar and Splenda. This was a good start for me though, so thanks for the recipe!

Oh boy was this good!  Picked up a few pounds of fresh Florida strawberries from the farmer's market and decided to give this a go (to my partner's horror when I said I was putting balsamic VINEGAR in them).  Well guess what - it's delicious!  I used normal sugar instead of Splenda and cooked for about 4 minutes until the strawberries were deep red but still firm.  PERFECTION!  Will make again for sure!

This recipe is wonderful! These are so good to eat by itself, but I put them in a salad and it was excellent. I used a salad dressing that had balsamic vinegar already in it so the flavors were perfect together! It does not taste like vinegar either and even my kids loved them!

This was very yummy!  I just used regular sugar.  I made it ahead of time and stuck it in the fridge for dessert.  I had it with whipped cream instead of ice cream but was really wishing I'd done the ice cream.  It was very good!

This is an awesome recipe!  People I made it for didn't want to try it at first because they thought vinegar with strawberries was weird.  After they tried it, they LOVED it!  I did use a little less sweetener then the recipe, and used white sugar.  The people I had try it had it plain and over ice cream and both were great.

I followed as written but ate just the strawberries - no ice cream or whipped cream.  It made for a great evening snack.

Added a T marmalade as one reviewer suggested, loved it...also added a splash of real maple syrup as I happened to have some on hand.  Really good, this is only the first day of the season so I can hardly wait until the real local strawberries arrive so I can try this again!

Fantastic!  I was wary of the balsamic vinegar, but other reviewers were right, there wasn't the vinegary taste at all.  My hubby couldn't even guess what the sauce had in it.  

Truly gourmet taste.  I'll be making this for company - maybe even for Mother's Day!

Thanks!

I had balsamic on other dishes and liked it, however I didn't like it on the strawberries.  It may have been that I used a plain yogurt instead of a ice cream or frozen yogurt with more sugar.

What a winner!  I used frozen strawberries, because I didn't have fresh ones.  After heating them, I don't think it makes much difference.  It turned out very nice and is very quick to make--five minutes including thawing the strawberries.

I was apprehensive to try these, but  my roommate really wanted to.  So I did, and  I was pleasantly surprised.   these are actually pretty                                                    good.

I used Stevia so 1/2 the amount of sweetener was WAY more than enough. Also added extra balsamic.

I loved these strawberries.  I used brown sugar and couldn't quite imagine how the balsamic vinegar would taste, but the net effect was wonderful. I served this over yogurt to save in calories, but over ice cream it would be positively decadent.

I made it and I couldn't get enough of it.  The recipe calls for vanilla ice cream; however, I topped my chocolate cake with it.  Easy to make and a great spring dessert.

Delicious and satisfying for a sweet tooth! Could use over shortbread or eat plain like I did. As others suggested I eliminated butter and just let marinade in balsamic and truvia.

I initially gave this recipe a bad review. I'm writing to revise my opinion. After a few days the flavor settled very nicely and this turned out delicious. I used it with plain greek yogurt and it was much better than buying the yogurt with the fruit on the bottom. I made it with real sugar and next time I make it I will eliminate the butter. I don't think it's needed.

I used a quart of sliced strawberries rather than measuring for 2 cups. I also used granulated sugar and 1T white balsamic vinegar. I brought everything to a low boil briefly. Served cool over homemade Cottage Pudding, also from Allrecipes.

Absolutely delicious. I was looking for an easy dessert recipe so I could use up the extra strawberries that I had. I did not use the artificial sweetener, it's ok in my Coke but not in my food. I used the brown sugar as suggested by another reviewer and the sauce was outstanding. I now have an easy dessert to impress my friends. Thanks Denmozz.

I made this and used brown sugar. I used less than a 1/4 of a cup. Served it over Greek vanilla yogurt.OMG.
