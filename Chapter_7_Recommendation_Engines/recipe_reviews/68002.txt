When making this recipe I noticed the 4 cups of water on the list and thought "darnit, I don't have any chicken broth!" I had also read that other viewers had the same inclination to use chicken broth rather than water. So I went ahead and used the water because I didn't want to make a special trip to the store just for that ingredient. I am SO glad I didn't because it didn't need it! The soup was wonderful and flavorful. Some reviews said it was bland but I beg to differ! Also some said the ginger flavor was too over powering. I, again, disagree! I followed the recipe exactly and I am so glad I did! No changes necessary on this one! Thanks for the recipe. I will make it again for sure!

It was lovely to find a soup with very clean, clear, and simple flavours -- it didn't need more spice, which would have detracted from the individual nuances of the vegetables and the ginger.  For those who found it lacking in flavour, make sure that the ingredients used are of highest quality -- organic, fully ripened, rich in colour -- and the difference should be noticable.  I must say I liked the thickness, which is easily adjusted for different occasions.  A variation I tried and liked: simmer the squash intead of baking it, and add the cooking liquid to the soup instead of plain water; add 2 cups thoroughly cooked red split lentels; add a dash of nutmeg and a dash of gharam masala; and a touch of fresh lemon zest.

Loved this recipe! I did however as suggested in some of the reviews use chicken broth instead of water and I used low fat sour cream( 1 tablespoon) to make the soup creamy. 
I will make this again

I've made this four times now and each time has been a success.  Very tasty and easy!  To enrich the soup use clarified butter instead of evoo and use quality chicken stock instead of water.  To mellow out the ginger, try leaving it in large slices and then removing about half before the final puree.  I've taken to using white pepper instead of black, this adds to the flavor and appearance - no little black specs floating around.  I've also increased the cinnamon but . . . add slowly and stir well to bring the flavor up.  It should be a quiet after thought on the palate not the first introduction.

I love this soup. I added a teaspoon of orange zest, the juice of one orange and doubled the amount of ginger. My ten month old couldn't get enough of it either.

Great soup. I roast the carrots while I roast the squash, both in an inch or so of water, then use that water for the recipe, as it will hold more flavor and nutrients than water alone. I do use a combination of stock and water for more flavor.

I agree with bananafish below -- this was a delicious soup with delicate yet vibrant flavors! I added a small amount of chopped fresh sage to this soup and it was a nice, compatible addition. Also, I crushed the soup with a potato masher rather than blending it in a processor, and I think this chunky soft texture was perfect. Delicious!

This is definately a "ginger lovers" soup.  I enjoyed it but am not certain I would confidently serve it to company unless I knew they liked ginger also.  I ended up adding the other half of the squash and added one can of chicken broth to thin the soup out and give the soup more depth and flavor and without the additional liquid it was too thick.  I too needed to add lots of salt and about a teaspoon of sugar (I guess my carrots and squash weren't too sweet).  The cream definately added another dimension and the taste was wonderful with it.

This soup was a very tasty departure from the kinds of flavors I normally gravitate toward. I used pre-cut, cubed butternut squash, available in the refrigerated part of the produce section.  I tossed that with olive oil, salt and pepper, and several cloves of minced garlic, then roasted it in the oven for 35 minutes.  While the butternut squash baked, I sauteed the onion and a couple cloves of garlic in olive oil, then added the chopped carrots to saute for another 4-5 minutes. I then combined ALL of the ingredients in a slow cooker, and cooked on a low heat for 5-6 hours, then pureed in my blender.  (I should also mention that I used vegetable broth instead of plain water.) The depth of flavor was so fantastic that I didn't add the cream for fear of ruining what was already pretty perfect on its own.

Thanks for sharing this wonderfully delicious, nutritious and satisfying soup.  I loved it so much, I made it twice in one week.  Add a nice salad & crusty bread and you're on the road to healthy eating!!!  Beats all those soups out there that call for canned broth!!  
If you have other recipes on this order, please share them!!!

I made this soup for me & my boyfriend, and we loved it so much we ate it all in one sitting. Followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't use any heavy cream. But I did swirl a tiny bit of half and half over the top of the soup for aesthetic reasons. It was great.

Delicous and healthy.   The ginger -   A lot of reviewers say they found a 2" piece either too much or not enough ginger.  The problem with the recipe is it says a 2" piece, but doesn't say how thick the piece should be.  Instead, go by weight.  I used a 10g. piece and found that gave a noticeable flavor.  Anything less and the ginger might be too subtle.  I might try a bit more next time but again, be careful not to use so much it overpowers the other flavors.   Carrots took 35 min. on a slow simmer to become tender.   Seasoning -  If you use white pepper be very careful.  It is a very different seasoning from black pepper.  I used 1/8 tsp and found it too much!  I dislike the taste as well which tasted much different than black pepper to me.  Instead, use finely ground black pepper.  You won't notice any flecks and it tastes much better with this soup.   Season very gradually as it's a fine line between perfect and too much.  I used more salt than I thought I would need to bring out the best flavor - 1/2 - 3/4 tsp but add slowly and taste before adding more.    Another thing -   When I pureed the soup it was quite thick so added about a cup of hot water to thin a bit.  Total yield at the end was about 5 cups.   The cream added at the end did nothing to improve the flavor but it looks nice if you pour it on carefully in a nice swirl.  Otherwise it looks weird and out of place.

I never had butternut squash soup in my life, neither had my husband. I bought a b-nut squash as part of my new "One New Veggie Every Week" diet, and decided to try this one first...RIGHT CHOICE! I didn't have fresh ginger so I used a nice big piece of crystallized ginger.  We liked it with a bit more cinnamon, I mixed in about 1/8 tsp. right b4 serving .... OUTSTANDING! BRAVO!!

Very disappointed - all I could taste was the ginger and I didn't even use the entire amount called for.  If I did make this again, which I doubt, I would also use ground ginger since ginger does not puree very well.  Bits of ginger throughout the soup.

Fantastic flavor and luxurious, velvety texture. I did add a vegetable bouillon cube when I added the water. I didn't use the optional cream either so this was suitable for vegans. Everyone loved this soup and I'll make it again. Thanks so much.

Just finished eating this very delicious soup. I suppouse that the basic recipe would have been just as good; however I always like to add my only twist to things. I added a bit more garlic since I am a huge fun of this lovely aromatic, also I chopped a bit of red chili peppers and sauteed with the galirc and onion. I used can pumpkin (only thing I had in hand) and a bunch of cilatro in the last 10 minutes of cooking. I thought really hard about not adding the cinnamon since is not very liked in my house, but I did and it really brought all the flavours together. Thank you so much for giving me an easy way to impress my guest without having to slave over a stove :)

I loved the flavors in this soup! Plus, it was very easy to make. 

For a quicker, easier way to cook the squash, I recommend microwaving it for a few minutes at a time with just a little bit of water (just enough to cover the bottom) in a microwavable container.

What a great and easy soup!  I left out the heavy cream and I replaced two cups of water with chicken broth (two cups water, two cups chicken broth).  I also added a little more ginger then what the recipe called for.

I've made this 3 times now, and I'll keep on making it. This is an easy, extremely satisfying soup.

I used Olive Oil instead. Other than that, I didn't modify ingredients, other than omitting the salt/pepper. I always sprinkle in a pinch or 2 of cinnamon, and that's all this soup needs.

Thank you a million times over for sharing such a great recipe!

fantastic flavor, extremely lightweight. we really enjoy soups, especially on cold nights like we've had all week and this soup tasted fantastic - our only complaint is that it was so lightweight that even served alongside a big salad and chicken strips, it left us unsatisfied and scrounging for food for the rest of the evening. if you work out frequently, are pregnant or nursing, or otherwise have a high metabolism plan to serve this with a large meal. next time we'll try substituting cream for some of the water and adding more oil.

I had a Carrot Ginger soup in a restaurant in Atlanta but since I've moved away I've been trying to find a recipe. This one is awesome! A great blend of flavors and the consistency was very nice. Very easy to make with an immersion blender.

Great overall!

Not particulalry simple to make as the squash takes a while to cook.

I thought the ginger was quite subtle and I could have added more, but I love ginger. I loved the thick rustic texture of it. Very lovely soup!

I've been looking  for a good carrot soup recipe and this is it. The squash and the ginger give so much flavor to this soup. Consistency is good but could be adjusted.  I didn't have heavy cream so added a bit of milk and served it with sour cream and it was amazing.

Excellent flavor and thickness. I used coconut oil instead of olive oil, roasted pumpkin instead of butternut squash, and stock instead of water.

I thought this was delicious! I did cut the ginger a bit. I put the full amount in while the soup cooked and then I pulled out about a third of it before pureeing. I still thought it had a strong ginger flavor. Luckily I LOVE ginger. My husband didn't love it but he's still learning to enjoy veggies. 

I plan to make this recipe again soon. :)

I was so excited to try this recipe after having it at a local cafe, not to mention seeing the recipe's high rating.  The soup had no flavor whatsoever and was very bland.  I even added some curry powder hoping that would help.  The consistency and color were great, but it tasted like blah onion water.  Wasn't a hit with me.

This soup was relatively bland on its own. I added roughly a teaspoon of curry powder and a teaspoon of chili powder and it became the perfect carrot soup! 
Will be making again.

I will definitely make it again. Would give 5 stars, but I did use chicken stock as a sub for half of the liquid, added a cup of milk, plus 1 T of honey at the end before blending. Delicious!

I loved this recipe.  If you want a dairy free options, try is with coconut milk.  We are dairy free and wanted it creamy.  I substituted one can of coconut milk for 2 cups of the water.

Ive made this soup twice now. I like it better with a whole squash and about 3/4 lb carrots. i substitued chick stock for water and kept the amount of ginger because i love ginger. the cream/milk is optional.

This is a healthy and easy soup that tastes great. The only change I made was to use garlic powder instead of garlic cloves. Next time I would use less water, both to thicken the soup and to increase the flavor. I didn't have any heavy cream so I added a bit of cream cheese to my first bowl. Bad idea! This is not a cheese-friendly soup.

Spectacular!  Excellent recipe, exactly the starting point I was looking for.  Two minor deviations:  I was really generous with the ginger and added about a cup of coconut milk.

This is absolutely delicious and one of the few recipes on this site which needs no modifications in my opinion.  I agree with previous reviewers that no chicken or veggie stock is needed as the result is quite flavorful on its own.  I also agree that a dose of Garam Marsala could be an interesting addition, although I did not try this myself (yet).  People who think that the ginger is too overpowering should definitely stir in some cream or half&half before serving, it will take a bite out of the bite ;).  I loved it just the way it was and will definitely make this again!

I love carrot ginger soup and chose this recipe because of the great reviews it has listed.  I wouldn't have thought to add cinnamon so that was a great touch.  I used half water and half coconut milk as my liquid base which eliminates the need for the cream and gives a wonderfully rich flavour.  For a little variation, add some chopped fresh cilantro from your herb garden and squeeze in some fresh lime - makes it a different kind of yummy.  For winter I like to add a tblspn or two of smooth peanut butter to the original recipe - something I've always done with squash & pumpkin soups. Delicious.

Tops! I used half chicken broth & half water for richness. For a shortcut, I bought a bag of frozen organic butternut squash and omitted the first step. I also like more ginger, because we wanted something for after the Thanksgiving feast that would help our digestive tract! Served with half and half at the bottom of the bowl and topped with parmesan. Will make again!

I thought this soup was good.  Unfortunately I took somebody else's advice and added some nutmeg, which gave the whole batch a funny taste.  Next time I will make it as the recipe is stated.

very good! To use what I had on hand- I changed it a bit. Everything the same but I used Butternut squash soup that I had purchased at Trader Joes. I also threw in some leftover chicken broth in place of some of the water(from last nights chicken dinner). I felt the prep work was minimal. I used my blender to puree. Just plan to cook the butternut squash the day before or earlier in the day. If you do that, then you will have the soup done from start to finish in less than 30 minutes. Thanks for your recipe.

I've had carrot ginger soup at restaurants and often wanted to make my own.  This recipe is excellent - exactly as I had hoped it would be.  It's clean and simple, comfort food at its best.  As for the long prep time, it's really worth it, and it's no more onerous than most soups are.

Delicious! My changes: I used yellow squash because my store was out of butternut and I used a full one instead of half. I also used half an onion cause my onion was really large. Those were my only changes and it came out amazing! I can't wait to try it with butternut instead.

Delish!  The only changes I made were to remove the ginger pieces before blending (as recommended by other users), and I used veg stock in place of water. I also prefer to use plain Greek yogurt in place of heavy cream for garnish.

I made this to take to a private wine tasting and it was a definite hit. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a bit more ginger. Fabulous, and it looks like something you expect to get in a fancy restaurant. Try it if you want to impress your guests.

Wow, this should definitely be called GINGER and carrot soup :)  The ginger dominates, not necessarily in a bad way, but it's a little overpowering and I even removed some before pureeing the soup.  I definitely prefer some of the other fall soups over this one.

I made a double batch of this using home made vegetable stock, and because my family can be picky, I only used 1 piece of ginger for the double batch. I also subbed coconut milk for the cream b/c my boyfriend is allergic to dairy. FANTASTIC. Even better with a little cracked red pepper or cayenne!

Delicious!  Made a few changes, mostly out of necessity.  Used the whole squash, had to use powdered ginger (probably about 1/8 tsp).  I also used 3 cups broth as suggested by other reviewers, and the last cup of liquid I used 3/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup plain yogurt to give it a little tang.  It was a great mix of flavors.  Also, we added some crumbled bacon on top.  The added salty-savory flavor really made it extra yummy!

Good soup, but needed a lot more ginger and I would advise that you use milk or water rather than cream. Otherwise it ends up tasting too sweet. I thought the texture was a bit chunky, so next time I would cook the carrots for a bit longer before putting them in the blender.

A great soup for a winter day.  I used the whole squash, added two potatoes, one apple, and used chicken stock instead of water.  I also added probably twice the amount of garlic and ginger than what the recipe called for.  I omitted the cinnamon and heavy cream.  The result is a mild but layered taste that is also quite healthy!

I didn't have the buttternut squash, but even without this was fantastic! Have made it multiple times, perfect cold winter soup to keep everyone healthy. Also freezes incredibly well.

I loved finding a carrot butternut ginger soup!  Delicious!   I pretty much followed the recipe but couldn't resist adding an apple.  I also threw all ingredients in my crockpot for 4 hours--after microwaving the squash for a bit so I could scoop it out.

This soup is amazing!  The ginger and black pepper (to taste) do give it a nice spice.  Scale back if this is not your cup of tea.  I left out the cinnamon and swapped heavy cream for light sour cream. So yummy.

I love this soup!  It's so easy, great eaten hot anytime, but also wonderful served as a cool summer soup.  The only modifications I made were exchanging some of the water for chicken broth to boost the protein, and, from time to time, using frozen butternut squash for speed.  Fantastic!

Had no squash so I added one potato. Cut my ginger into 4 pieces and removed 3 of the pieces before I blended everything. This soup was just wonderful. Will make again and again.

This is a great recipe. 2 small changes that i made: As another reviewer mentioned, I took a few chunks of the ginger out of the soup before I blended it together and it still had plenty of ginger flavor. The second time I made this soup, I added 3 T. of butter to the soup before I blended it together and it took the soup from good to great.

I used this recently because I needed some ideas of what to do with the pulp from my juicer after making a combination of kale, beet greens, and carrot juice with ginger.  It was a perfect guideline.  I first olive-oiled the pulp in a cast iron skillet to get the water out (high heat, turning for 10 minutes), then used veggie broth to supplement for taste.  It was terrific, and I didn't have to compost the pulp.

I didn't have any squash because I also wanted some extra carbs for my young kids--so I boiled a yam, added cilatro to my boiling carrots (for extra flavour)and added some coconut milk when blending all together...yummy!

I doubled the recipe and thought it tasted quite carrot-y.  I liked the ginger, though took a little bit out before pureeing like some others suggested. I added more than a dash of cinnamon. Perhaps a bit of cayenne pepper to give more taste on my next batch?

Very good soup.  I added few teaspoons of butter at the end to smooth out the taste a little (didn't add the cream).  My 8 month old baby and my husband both LOVE this soup.

We liked it alright.  My 4 year old daughter, who LOVES the butternut squash soup recipe from this site, didn't like this one at all.  I dunno... I guess the ginger was a bit strong -- and I only used about half.

My family just ate this up (literally, hehe)! I used half vegetable stock, half water, and substituted half of the onion for leek (since we're not too big on strong onion in my family), and part of the squash was acorn squash, since we didn't have enough butternut.
I agree with another reviewer that you definitely have to like ginger to like the soup. I didn't even use all that the recipe called for and it was too strong for me, but my family likes ginger better than I do, so it was great to them.

Very subtle flavor-next time I would use more garlic and/or onion. Seems like we had to add a lot of salt/pepper.  But it was a nice flavor and very different.  My old blender did a fine job of pureeing the ginger, by the way.

What a great recipe!  I'm not a huge fan of cooked carrot so I just made it with more squash instead and it was perfect.  The cinnamon and cream are amazing touches.  I'll definitely be making this again!

What I liked about this recipe was that it was so easy.  What I had a problem with was the texture, it did not work for me.  I also needed a bit more depth with the flavor.  It seemed a tad flat.  I would consider some of the of reviewers recommendations to make the flavor more interesting.

Ths soup was absoutely wonderful.  I did however use a little less of the ginger only because ginger can have a very strong flavor.  I Served it at a big gathering of about 80 women.  The vote was about half and halfo f those who loved it and who didn't. But I loved it and will be making it again.
Thanks for the recipe.

I found it had little flavour other than the ginger. I think I may have over-seasoned it, which didn't help, but only because it didn't have much flavour when I tried it. Others who had it loved it though. Worth a try.

My husband and I both liked this soup very much.  In my version, I only used one clove of garlic.  I also used three heaping tb spoons of cream cheese and 1/3 cup of half & half instead of heavy cream.  We added some majoram, cayenne, cumin and a touch of tumeric.  My husband added a bit more cinnamon and ground clove.  Both of our versions turned out great.  If you like your soup thick, 4 cups of liquid might be a little too much.  Great recipe!

Myself and my 3 year old enjoyed this, but my husband and 20 month old did not.  It took a lot of prep work, so I would probably not make it often, but I will make it again.

It's a decent version, but kind of bland. I subbed half the water for chicken broth too. I added a beef bullion cube and extra salt for flavor and it jazzed it up a bit. I would grate the ginger next time, as the immersion blender left pieces that were a little large.

Used Chicken broth (low sodium), added 2 bay  leaves & a few more carrots than the recipe called for .  We ate it  with warm crusty whole grain bread... Delish??

added sage, cayenne (a pinch), mace, cinnamon, brown sugar and orange zest to three pounds of carrots, two inches of ginger , salt, pepper and generous amount of garlic to chicken broth. I did not add cream, but rather drizzled it. It's quite good. I had meant to put in a piece of squash, but that didn't pan out. So,it's pure carrot, ginger soup and other than it having a tiny grainy texture, is lovely.  This made three quarts.

To speed prep time, can use frozen squash and a bag of baby carrots (don't need to dice).  I used a jar of diced ginger from the grocery store Asian food refrigerated section in place of fresh ginger.

Followed another person's method of boiling the squash, added big pieces of the carrots as well to soften both at the same time.  Sauteed the onion (half) plus about a cup of a riced veggie medley I needed to use up in clarified butter as another review mentioned. Added a few red pepper flakes to kick it up.  Used garlic paste and ginger paste plus an immersion blender.  Skipped the cream.  Loved the result, very hearty.

I made this with jarred garlic, fresh ginger and water, following the recipe exactly. I did not use any cream.  It was amazing! The ginger made the soup. My mom hates ginger and garlic and she loved it, too.

I wanted it to be creamier.  I will simmer it longer and add more cream.  I would maybe add chicken or veggie stock instead of water to give it more flavor.

This was super bland. I had to add a ton of spices to salvage, but it still tasted like something was missing. Next time would use chicken stock or more garlic or something.

I used a large sweet potato instead of the butternut squash and boiled it all instead of turning on the oven. I added more ginger because I love it and I used coconut milk for the cream as well.  It's seems like a very flexible soup!

I loved this soup!
I didn't have squash on hand, but I had a sweet potato to use up and that added a beautiful flavour. 
Normally I like to roast my veggies first for added flavour, but I just tossed everything in the pot and it was great!
Added a bit of curry powder, and a splash of coconut milk instead of cream. A definite winner in our house!

The carrots I used were super sweet (when I tried them raw) so I was quite disappointed in the bland taste of the soup.  I guess I should have read the comments and tried using chicken broth.

Amazing taste. I used a little extra ginger and garlic because I love them. A garnish of cilantro or parsley and a drizzle of canned evaporated milk give it a little something extra.

Less ginger OR, even better: add grated ginger once served ;)
No cream. Add peanut butter and japaneese soy sauce.

Loved it! There is a strong ginger taste. If you're not a big fan you might want to cut the amount in half. I froze the leftovers for a few months and when thawed it was as good as the day I made it. Freezing seemed to tone down the ginger flavor. Overall I really liked this soup.

I decided to roast all of the vegetables instead of sauteing them. Used pre-cut butternut squash that I "evened up " a little bit to make the chunks more uniform in size, and baby carrots roasted whole, onions in large chunks. I sliced up the ginger separately and microwaved it in a little bit of water until soft, and then added that in with the roasted veggies when I pureed it all together. I thought the ginger taste was quite nice.

Very nice recipe, and very allergy-friendly.  I used gluten-free, low sodium chicken broth in place of water, and my butternut squash was large not medium.  Did not add any cream or half & half.  Used only about 2/3 of the amount of ginger stated, to keep it mild enough for some young children who were visiting us.  Did not add any salt or pepper since the broth was already flavored.  It was a big hit all around the table.  It came out much thicker than I expected, just shy of pureed squash texture, and despite pureeing it with an immersion blender there were still several large thin slices of ginger encountered.  The adults didn't mind that but the kids did.  Next time I would probably mince the ginger to avoid that issue, and would add another cup of water or broth.  We will definitely make this again.  We served it as a first course for Thanksgiving dinner and it would make a very nice winter lunch with crusty bread and some cheese.

Maybe just a little too much ginger flavor.  Nice and sweet though and the heavy cream adds some needed richness.

The texture was unappealing at best and the flavor very bland. I tried baking a butternut squash and pureed it along with some pumpkin to add more flavor - we still did not care for it.   I would, however, use this as a healthy alternative for store- bought baby food.

I love this soup! One time I had extra guests coming, so I added a baked sweet potato that I had on hand and 2 cans of coconut milk instead of the heavy cream--and wow, was that fantastic! Now, I regularly add the coconut milk, and if I have a sweet potato on hand I add that as well. I have even added some cilantro if I feel like going Thai!

Easy, healthy, tasty, affordable
 Made this exactly how it is above and thoroughly enjoyed it. Great dinner for dieters as it is super healthy but filling. This will be made again for sure.

I made it with carrots only and another time with butternut  squash.. The difference is not too noticeable and carrots are easier to cook... I like to add cumin, curry, red pepper spice, and olive oil... it goes well with a dollop of plain yogurt when you serve it.

I added I bit too much ginger. I doubled the recipe so I added coconut oil (about 3 tablespoons) while on lower temp. It tasted fantastic. This is a soup I will make again with the coconut oil again as well.

I used a full butternut squash and powdered garlic because we were out of fresh. It turned our great! I agree that there's plenty of flavor and stock is not necessary.

I have made this a couple of times and I love it.  It's so simple and delicious.  I have not made many tweaks to the recipe because it's wonderful on it's own, but I use a little bit of skim or 1/2% milk rather than heavy cream, and it still adds the creaminess I like without the fat.  I'm tempted to add some butter, but it's so much healthier without and it's wonderful as is.  Thanks for sharing!

This was excellent! I used 2 packets of chicken bouillon (for 2 of the 4 cups of water), and didn't have butternut squash so used 3 small yellow and orange peppers and cooked those with the onions. I also added 1/4 teaspoon cumin and a heaping 1/2 teaspoon turmeric and 4 cloves of crushed garlic instead of 3. Very flavorful!!! I topped it off with chopped cilantro and a dollop of greek yogurt- no cream.

I found that there was too much ginger in it ; it should probably be measured in tablespoons rather than inches.  My ginger knob was probably much thicker than the regular pieces.  The soup had a lovely flavour !  I added home made chicken broth instead of water & a can of coconut milk instead of heavy cream.  My guests enjoyed it & I'll make it again.

Recipe is simple, easy to follow, and results in a great soup. I will say that I added half of the ginger called for in the recipe and STILL found it a little overpowering. I might cook more carrots and add the other half of the butternut squash to mellow it out a bit. Anyway, I'll also mention that I used water (not chicken broth) as instructed and it was great. Good for vegetarian friends and for controlling the amount of salt.

Amazing! I doubled the recipe because I love to freeze stuff, added a can of lite coconut milk, cumin, cinnamon & nutmeg. I think I might use some flour because w the coconut milk and half a little thing of shipping cream it actually seems a teensy bit thin. But the flavors are awesome! Love it!!!

Very nice soup. I followed advice of others, adding sour cream to cream soup, chicken broth white pepper. Have this with some home made bread. There is no regret to make something different on a cold evening

Mmm..delightful! Substituted more carrots since I lacked butternut squash. Added a whisper of celery salt to the water and stirred in 3T of cream cheese at the end. Now that it is gone I realized I forgot to add cinnamon.. an excuse to make again!

This recipe is amazing it is as close to perfection as it gets. I used an already peeled half butternut squash to save time and chopped the carrots in my vitamix blender-honestly it could not have been easier. Loved it!

I've made this recipe several times now and it always comes out well. I add plenty of ginger, probably more than this recipe calls for, but I also boil it all together for a lot longer than 20 minutes so that the ginger is super tender and purees well. I'm also not a fan of the cinnamon addition to this -- I think it makes the soup a little too sweet, but that's my own preference. I add cumin instead and it adds just a hint of a more smoky, savory flavor. I've also been known to serve with a dollop of sour cream on top--perfect soup for cold winter days!

I LOVE ginger, so added the full amount called for but it was the only flavor that came through.  Very bitey. Maybe a case of winter vs spring ginger?  Spring ginger has much less bite.  With the addition of 1 and 1/2 butternuts and a second pound of carrots, I can slightly taste them.  All that being said, once I balanced out the ginger, it was a great soup.  Next time I plan to take the advice of "LeBlond"; I'll follow the recipe but put in big slices of ginger and remove half before the puree.  That way I can taste it and add more ginger if needed.

Loved this soup.....ok I have to admit I tweaked it a tad...but just a tad.   I love cinnamon, good thing as I accidentally added about 2x too much....I think it was a great addition.    I happened to use baby carrots, just because that's what I had.   I also added two bullion cubes of no sodium chicken  to the 4 cups of water just to give it a bit more flavor.

I was really excited to try this soup, but I found it to be just ok. Very gingery and not much carrot flavour. I used fresh ingredients from the Farmer's Market, but it just wasn't all that great. I will eat the leftovers tomorrow though, and I like how healthy it is.

This soup is cheap to make, and it tastes amazing.  Best of all, it's a very forgiving recipe.  You can screw around a bit with the spices and still have an amazing final product.

I'm allergic to milk, so I just stuck an immersion blender into my soup pot and pureed everything, then spiced it and let it simmer a bit longer to let the spices sink in.

I love this soup! I used a can of squash because I didn't have a fresh one and it still came out great! If you want milder ginger flavor, use a tbsp of fresh grated ginger. I wanted more so I doubled it. Thanks!

This was very good, although I ended up with bits of fibrous ginger in the soup. It may have been a little older ginger. Next time I'll try grating the ginger rather than slicing it.

I didn't have white pepper, or I would have used it... It has more zap than black. I liked this recipe, but I too found it a little bit lacking. I had to add a fair amount of salt to make it tasty, otherwise it just tasted like squash, mostly... It was fun to try for the first time, and I'll make it again, but I might use a vegetable broth instead of water and I'll get white pepper. :)

Great recipe!  A few minor changes...cooked 1/2 squash (14 oz) in microwave instead of oven (cut squash in half, scoop out seeds, micro for 5 minutes, scoop out inside, etc), used 1/2 chicken broth 1/2 water, added a bit of nutmeg in addition to cinnamon, used 1 T. of jarred minced ginger instead of fresh and stirred in a tablespoon or two of plain yogurt before serving.  Excellent subtle flavor and beautiful color!

Loved this.  I substituted a cup of frozen winter squash for the butternut squash.  Great time saver and flavor was similar.

I loved this recipe! I did a few substitutions. Mine came out more Squashy and not as Carroty.   Instead of using the 1/2 medium butternut squash, I used 30 oz of canned pureed butternut squash. Maybe cutting back would have let my version retain more of the carrot flavor.   Instead of a pound of carrots, I used 7 (2.5 oz) packets of baby carrots. I may have needed to add more, as my dad was not able to taste the carrots in my version.   I used at least 2 tsp pepper and at least 1 tsp salt, then added more if needed.   I used 1 tbsp ground cinnamon, then added more if needed.   The secret of the flavor of this recipe is the cinnamon.   I didn't need to add any chicken broth.

I hate to be a negative Nancy, but I didn't care for this soup. The ginger completely overpowered the other flavors. I made this recipe exactly as written. I do love that it is healthy, and it is a beautiful color, I just can't get past the strong taste of ginger. I'm saving it in the fridge just incase my boyfriend likes it. I enjoyed making it, though!

Way too much ginger that it was spicy and almost undrinkable, and I used less than the required amount. Decrease the ginger, add some whipped cream, and you'll be good to go.

Loved the cinnamon but use sparingly.  Used 2 small sweet potatoes instead of butternut squash...very good...heavy cream makes it!

Yummy and perfect for those miserable winter days to warm you up and give you a little kick!  I left out the creamand also the cinnamon, but added a few basil leaves and more ginger than listed as i love it and it tastes just as delicious!

We really enjoyed the simple harvest garden flavor and color of this healthy soup.  I didn't have much time so I revised the recipe to simmer the veggies all together in the water for about 8 minutes then just blend to make it smooth and creamy.  I also added a potato while simmering because I wanted to be sure my athlete teens got enough calories.  A recipe I have for butternut soup recommends a swirl of pesto on top of each bowl.  I love that for the flavor and the beautiful presentation.  I will definitely try that for this soup.

One reviewer commented that this is for ginger lovers only, but my 13 yo daughter HATES ginger (even a little in pie or cookies) and said she actually didn't mind it in this soup.  It wasn't overpowering at all.  Maybe it has to do with how thick the ginger root is?  Ours was about 1 1/4" thick.  

Anyway, thanks for the recipe.  We'll definitely use it again.

This soup was de-li-cious.  I didn't have any butternut squash, so I replaced it with about 3/4 cup unsweetened pumpkin puree.  I added some chicken broth powder to the soup a few minutes before putting it in a blender - it made an amazing difference!  Because of the chicken broth, I didn't need to add any salt; I didn't add the cinnamon either, because it was simply so perfect and I didn't dare change anything in case it would ruin it.  It was simply delicious, and not too creamy (I think that was because of the pumpkin puree).  A fabulous way to make sure those carrots (and pumpkin puree!) don't go to waste.  Thanks!  :P

I loved this recipe!  The creamy texture made you think it had cream in it, but it didn't!  It was all just veggies!  Very healthy and tasty.  I served it with a plop of sour cream and diced green onions to garnish.  Made this for my mom's birthday and she raved about it!  Adding extra ginger makes this soup stand out of the crowd too.  Thanks a lot!

GREAT! everyone in my house loved it... even my 20-month old nephew. I used candied ginger, b/c it was what I had on hand. and it wasn't as strong as fresh probably would have been.

Quick,easy and very tasty.I had some very fresh ginger which gave a very strong taste. I also  went heavy on the salt and pepper with some bullion and paprika to give some oomph.  
  Will certainly make this one again.

I had a fun time making this! I didn't feel like it took too long at all. It's a pretty good soup when made directly from the recipe, but like others, I felt that 4 cups of water may be alittle too much. Also, I thought that the cream was essential. So much, in fact, that I added it to the whole pot, not just in the individual bowls. I also felt that I added A LOT of salt, but that could just be me. Definitely worth the try, but I may try another since I am on the quest to find the best carrot soup out there!

This soup did take a lot of prep work, but it was tasty.  I love the flavors of this soup.  However, I was not a fan of the pureed texture, next time I will not mix it in the blender at the end, it reminded me of baby food.
