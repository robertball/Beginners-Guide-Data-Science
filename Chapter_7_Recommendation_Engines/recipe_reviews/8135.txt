Don't be put off by the ratings of * and **.  Not cooking the flour/milk mixture long enough will result in a "floury-tasting" frosting, so be sure to cook the mixture until reasonably thickened.  An actual ball doesn't need to form; it just has to be thick.  Also, as at least one other reviewer said, it's important to beat the sugar and butter at least 15 minutes - that's how you reduce the "grit" of the granulated sugar.  If you take your time and do it right, you'll be rewarded with the most remarkably smooth and creamy, buttery  frosting you've ever tasted.

This is a GREAT recipe that's easy to mess up: first, cook the flour and milk til it's thick (I don't know what a "ball" would be).  Then make sure the flour and milk combination is completely cool (no warmer than room temp) before mixing the butter in.  Finally, I like powdered sugar in this recipe better than granulated sugar.

I'm really surprised that people had trouble with this recipe.  I've made it at least 10 times and never had a problem.  Whisking the flour into the milk thoroughly before heating will eliminate lumps.  I've used both granulated sugar and powdered in this recipe and found that if the air is humid, the granulated will result in a grittier frosting.  But the flavor is to die for regardless!  The appearance of the milk/flour mixture is a bit off-putting once it's cooled, but once it's mixed with the butter/sugar, it's beautifully smooth and fluffy.  Thank so much, Jennifer!

This is, simply put, the best buttercream frosting. However, the description of cooking the milk and flour is poorly written - it should NOT (as others have noted) form a "ball". If you add the flour bit by bit and whisk constantly for several minutes over low-medium heat, your patience will be rewarded. The mixture will look like it's not thickening at all for what feels like a long time, and then the starch molecules in the flour finally burst and it will thicken quite rapidly from there. If you cook it low and slow and NEVER stop whisking, you will not get a floury taste! The mixture is finished when it *thickens* - like mashed potatoes that have been put through a blender. Cool it completely until it is room temperature before adding it to the other ingredients!  As far as the what-kind-of-sugar-to-use debate, here's what you should know: If you use powdered sugar, the frosting will be much sweeter than intended. (And if you like super-sweet, that may not be a bad thing!) If you use granulated sugar, you will need to beat it mercilessly until the granules finally dissolve. (Only stand mixers need apply!) The **best** sugar to use is called "super-fine" granulated sugar. It comes in small boxes and is utterly perfect for this kind of recipe, because it avoids the too-sweet of powdered sugar and dissolves much faster than a regular granulated sugar.  There's not a human being alive who doesn't taste this frosting and beg for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious and a great template for other flavors/extracts. To avoid flour lumps I made a roux. I took 4 tablespoons of the butter and melted it in my saucepan, then stirred in the flour. I cooked it this way for a few minutes to cook out the "floury taste." I slowly added the milk while whisking. This way is much faster, it thickened up right away.

I cant recommend this recipe enough! Sooo fluffy! Very good on coconut cupcakes and chocolate cake.

(When cooking the flour/butter it formed a ball... maybe this part was accidentally left out of the recipe?)

For those of you who tried this and it didn't work, TRY AGAIN!  This frosting is absolutely devine. Patience is the key here so take your time and your efforts will be rewarded 10-fold. My husband said he could have eaten all of it with a spoon. Don't try to form a ball when cooking.  Instead, keep stirring it about 15 or 20 minutes (a Mini Whipper fro Pampered Chef is the best!)until it gets really thick and then take it off the heat.  Cool until it's about 80 to 85 degrees and continue with the recipe.  If you let it get too cold, you'll have lumps in the finished product.

This is a wonderful buttercream frosting recipe! I think that the ingredients list should say powdered or confectioners sugar, though, NOT white sugar. If you use this recipe, use confectioners sugar! It turned out to be a wonderful consistency!

I used this frosting on a sponge cake and it got great reviews from my family. It was very creamy--not grainy at all, and just sweet enough. Don't worry about the milk/flour mixture turning into a ball. Simply use a whisk to blend the milk into the flour and then heat until very thick. I used my Kitchenaid mixer with the paddle attachment. First, I creamed the butter, sugar and vanilla (I also used 1/2 t. orange extract) for a full five minutes on the highest setting, scraping it down with a spatula once. Then I added the flour mixture and beat it for an additional 15 minutes. With the orange extract, the frosting tasted just like a creamsicle! I will definitely make this again.

i agree with "starla" and a couple others.  i have been cooking for 40 years and this is the second time that I couldn't use this.    when does it form a ball???  a lot of people substituted powdered sugar, why do we have to substitute if a recipe is rates 4 stars???  i ended up with the 1st product when you are starting a cake, a fluffy sugar and butter mixture.  don't try to fix this one!!!!!

Smooth consistency, very easy.  Cook and mix as directed, but substitue powdered sugar as suggested.  1/4 c cocoa powder makes a light, chocolate icing that is not overpowering.

Addendum:  I let my second batch cool too much.  The flour/milk mixture lumped up and refused to blend.  However, too warm would be bad for the butter mix.  Need to work on timing for this recipe.

I have made this recipe (under a different name) for 45 years. I found it in my grandmmother's recipe box. The post to whisk the flour and milk until thick is correct, not to a "ball", and you must let it cool completely, which thickens it more. Additionally, PLEASE use granulated sugar, even if you must use superfine (or measure sugar and magic-bullet-it to a powder). During years my tired mixer could not beat sugar in completely I would refrigerate overnight to let sugar dissolve and thaw and mix the next day before spreading over cake. Hide in refrigerator or someone will eat it! In recent years I have started adding 2 tablespoons meringue powder (at any stage but i tend to add to milk and flour before cooking) to help stabilize at room temperature because it does tend to get melty above 65 degrees or so. It takes all additions nicely; 2 8-ounce packages softened cream cheese for carrot cake or pumpkin bread icing, 2 squares melted baking chocolate, cooled, added in a thin stream as icing for yellow cake. It also takes color really well. Original recipe as I found it (in 1965) was called Aunt Mitzi's Icing. My aunt renamed it Lynn's Icing in 1973 because I was the only person who had ever made it. Anyone else have origins?

Loved this recipe!  I have always found buttercream frosting made with powdered sugar to be too sweet and often clumpy.  I had no idea you could make it with granulated sugar.  After reading the other reviews, I knew it was going to take some time.  I cooked the flour/milk recipe over low-med heat, stirred with a spoon until very thick (never made a ball). Removed from the pan to a separate dish to cool.  Meanwhile, beat the butter & sugar on med-high for probably 15 minutes, as one reviewer suggested.  Occasionally I stirred the flour mixture to help it cool quicker.  Then beat the two thoroughly.  The result was a perfectly light & smooth frosting that received great compliments!!  The only thing I would not recommend is refrigerating before spreading - mine got quite firm and I had to bring it back to room temperature.  Overall, it's exactly what I wanted to make and worth the time & effort to prepare!

For the people that say this is too sweet, DON'T USE powdered sugar.  The recipe calls for granulated b/c the end result is not supposed to be overly sweet.  I bake several times a week and friends go crazy over this frosting.   My mom made a similar recipe when I was growing up...called it "Pope's frosting"-not sure why? This is just a delicious recipe.  Don't cook until it forms a ball, just until it's thick and custardy...will actually look like smooth mashed potatoes.  Scrape into a bowl and cover will plastic wrap so it doesn't form a "skin".  I always pop in fridge for awhile.  Beat the butter & sugar for AT LEAST 10 minutes before you add thickened, COOLED milk mixture.  It is fluffy and soooo yummy.  And use the granulated sugar unless you want super sweet results with powdered sugar.

I read every review for this frosting carefully, substituting powdered sugar, but I still ended up with frosting that didn't complement my chocolate cake.  I cooked the milk/flour mixture and stirred it with a wisk, but I still managed to scald it.  I proceeded anyway, hoping the scalded scent would be masked by the butter & vanilla flavors.  I had to add some cocoa powder to try to disguise it even more, and I mixed it on high for a very long time.  While the body was quite light, the texture was too smooth and the flavor wasn't very good.

This is THE RECIPE to use to frost Red Velvet Cakes!!!! TRY THIS RECIPE w/ your next red velvet cake, if you do it right, you'll have an AUTHENTIC red velvet cake!!!

For those who've had bad luck.  Here are your problems.  If you've scalded the milk/flour mixture - your temperature is TOO high, use your knob, turn it down!  This is NOT rocket science, it's not going to "form a ball"  - it does need to thicken tho, best way to test it, use a wooden spoon dip it in the mixture, run your finger (clean) down the middle of the spoon, if the mixture stays on both sides of the spoon and doesn't run together down the middle, it's done!  
Cooling this to room temp is imperative, otherwise it will melt the butter.  You'll know if you've whipped the frosting long enough b/c the granulated sugar will not be noticeable, and will not be gritty.

I absolutely LOVE this buttercream frosting.  I made it for the 3rd time this weekend for my son's birthday cupcakes.  I don't change a thing with the recipe (aside from the cooking until a ball stage - I cook until it's a thick pudding consistency), and I got so many rave reviews, everyone loved it including 2 friends who have side businesses of decorating cakes - they both asked for the recipe.  One word of caution, the 2nd time I made it I let the flour/milk mixture sit too long and cool too much before combining with the butter/sugar....  It did NOT blend well and and gross chunks throughout.  I suggest stirring the flour/milk mixture often with a wire whisk while it cools and combining when it is just barely lukewarm.  I would say it was about 30 minutes or so after I turned the heat off.

I love this recipe!  I used unsalted buter so it didn't have that buttery taste, and you also have to make sure the butter is softened at room temperature.  Don't try to cheat and melt the butter in the microwave - you will get soup.  This was an excellent frosting!  I hit the jackpot when I found this one!  It has a light and smooth texture and was perfect for my son's birthday cake.  The flour mixture should be cooked until it is thick, like gravy.  It doesn't have to form a "ball" as I don't know what that means either, like one of the reviews I read.  Let it cool to room temperature b4 adding to the butter/sugar mixture.  I followed this recipe exactly and used granulated sugar.  If you beat the frosting long enough, you won't get that gritty taste and the sugar dissolves if the flour mixture is just the right temperature.  It did not take the full 15 minutes to beat though, more like 6 minutes.  If you give it a chance, this is a very good frosting!

I am giving this a 4 due to the inadequate directions.  The recipe itself is GREAT!  This is not a quick throw together recipe. If that is what you want go elsewhere.  To maximize time I put the sugar and butter in my stand mixer (on high and let them blend while I cooked the flour and milk.  (Both took aprox 15min.) I cooked the milk/flour at a low heat, slowly. The milk/flour did not form a ball, I just took it to a thick past.  Tasting a small amount to be sure it was not "floury" before pulling it off the heat.  While letting that cool, I returned to my butter/sugar.  It had taken a noticable difference in look.  I tested a small amount between my fingers.  It was just a little gritty but mostly fluffy, I accurately assumed that the thickened milk and vanilla would take care of the rest.  Once cooled I added the milk, then vanilla.  The result was amazing!  I would note that the type of milk you use will effect thickening time and would not recommend skim milk for this.  You want the cream.  When thickening you are essentially cooking out the water and leaving the milk fat(cream).

This is not good. Don't waste your time or ingredients.
I didn't like it but proceeded to frost some cupcakes with it.  I got about 12 frosted cupcakes.  With that much butter and my regular recipe I can frost about 20.  
It's tasteless and has no character.  
If you REALLY want buttercream search Rick's Special Buttercream on this website.  
My mother, a wonderful baker never made this kind of frosting with flour.  Now I know why.  two thumbs DOWN!

This is the best vanilla frosting I've ever made aside from Swiss Buttercream.  Finally one that doesn't have that raw powdered sugar flavor!   For what it's worth, here are my tips: To avoid lumps, add the flour to the pan then whisk in the milk as you pour it in before you turn on the heat.  Whisk it constantly while cooking, until it thickens to a gelatinous paste over low heat.  It doesn't have to form a ball!   I then transferred the paste to a bowl and placed that bowl in an ice water bath (another bowl partially filled with ice water) and stirred the mixture slowly to cool in down quicker.  It took about 10 minutes to get it noticeably cool to the touch.  I used superfine sugar to whip with the butter, it disolves into the butter better than regular granulated.  If you only have granulated sugar, you can grind it in a blender or food processor for a couple of minutes until it's finer in texture, but not until it turns to powder.  I always add an additional pinch of salt to sweet mixtures, it just seems to perk up the flavor more.

Someone gave me this recipe 30 yrs ago and sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't, but when it worked it was incredibly delicious. I looked in allrecipes hoping to find the secret to making this recipe work and followed the comments about being patient and really whipping the butter and sugar, letting the milk cool just to room temp. and adding it bit by bit, and it worked wonderfully. I am impatient by nature and I'm thinking the mistakes I made when making this frosting before were: not whipping the butter/sugar mix long enough, putting the thickened milk in the fridge and getting it too cool, and adding it in all at once to the butter, which apparently leads to a curdled unpleasant frosting. It's about time I figured out how to make this frosting right. Thanks!

I'm quite new to frosting and decorating cupcakes. This frosting is soooo easy and delicious. My kids squirt the remaining frosting from the piping bag directly into their mouth! However, it is a tad too soft for decorating or when left at room temperature after some time.

The whole point of this recipe is that you don't use powdered sugar to make it.  You want to use granulated.  It's very easy to make icing/frosting with powdered sugar - you don't have to go to this extra trouble.  But the extra effort is worth it here.

I have made this with just 2T of flour and it's turned out fine, in case you are having issues with it being "floury" tasting.

Make sure the flour and milk combination is room temp before mixing with butter/sugar; make sure the butter is room temp before you mix it with the sugar; make sure that you beat the final product until it is thicker than whipped cream.  Also, try almond extract instead of vanilla. 

Make it a day ahead of time and leave it out at room temp overnight.  The sugar crystals will dissolve into the butter and the consistency gets creamier.  It tastes better on day 2 and even better the next, if there's any left.  This frosting is definitely worth the extra effort.

I have been on the Great Buttercream Frosting Hunt for several years now and was never satisfied with any recipe.....until now! I am astonished at the silky texture and the buttery flavor, all with only one cup of butter! Followed the suggestions by others: whisked the flour into the cold milk before placing on the heat. I continued to whisk almost constantly until it was thick (a very creamy paste) and my whisk left tracks on the bottom of the pan. I folded it into my butter/sugar mixture while it was a bit warm, which I believed helped dissolve any sugar granules. (I used plain white sugar and salted butter).  The result was regal.  I thickly frosted a 9x13 cake and had frosting left over.  I will definitely make this again and will continute to experiment by thickening the milk/flour further, and will add lemon or orange extracts which should really complement this fantastic frosting. Finally....I have a keeper. Yay!

Light, fluffy and delicious frosting. I was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews but thought I would give it a try. I cooked and whisked the milk/flour mixture until it was a very thick paste. I transferred it to a bowl, covered and refrigerated while I started whipping the butter and sugar. I used Bakers Ultra Fine Granulated sugar which was the perfect choice. Not too sweet or gritty. After whipping the sugar and butter, I added the milk mixture (which I briskly stirred to remove any new lumps) and allowed it to whip for an additional 7-8 minutes. At the end I added the vanilla, and a pinch of salt to balance. It couldn't be better!

This recipe is AWESOME! Well worth the work. I have a food allergy to soy, so I cannot eat processed cake mixes and frostings. The whole trick to this is how long it's whipped. I whip the butter and sugar in the mixing bowl for 1/2 hour. While it's mixing, cook the milk and flour mix (I added 1 teaspoon butter)on low heat, and then increase temp to medium. As soon as it thickens to pudding consistency, I remove it from heat, let it sit on the stove at room temp for 20 minutes or so. Don't refridgerate it. Add the milk and flour mix to the mixing bowl in 2-3 separate increments, add the vanilla, and then mix another 10-15 minutes. Fantastic - tastes fabulous on chocolate layer cake! Thanks for this one!

We love cupcakes around here, so we make a lot of frostings. This one is the BEST buttercream frosting, period. The key to this is patience! First, whisk the flour and milk together completely before heating it.  Don't worry about the flour and milk forming a ball, either- it just needs to get to a smooth, thick consistency, but it takes some time over low to medium heat. KEEP WHISKING THE WHOLE TIME YOU ARE HEATING IT! Cool it to about 85 degrees and then add to the sugar/butter. You will not be disappointed!

This is not your typical rich buttercream.  If you're looking for a whipped type of icing that's not too sweet, this is perfect!  I cooked the flour & milk until it became thick (like white gravy).  I was worried that the sugar could be "grainy" or "crunchy" and it was a little bit at first but once I refrigerated it for a few hours.....everything came together perfectly.  I would use this recipe again!

This is so easy to make and is creamy and rich, almost like custard. It isn't light and fluffy like buttercream made with powdered sugar (i indthat overly sweet and gritty like toothpaste) but I prefer it by far. Keys to making it: 1. While making the flour and milk mixture, you really do have to stir it (I use rubber spatula) THE ENTIRE TIME or else it seizes up and gets lumpy. And while stirring you'll notice that the change in consistency happens suddenly, and I take it gf the heat before it is a ball as you may burn the flour. 2. Definitely cool it, completely or else if too warm it can turn your buttercream to slurpy goop, has happened to me. Something scientific I presume. 3. After adding the mixtures together really beat it until all sugar granules disappear or else you'll get those granules between your teeth. 4. You can flavor it with lemon almond extract flavored vodkas rims etc, easy to color and stays nice and thick, looks great swirled onto cupcakes. I've made Halloween brain cakes, ice ream cone cupcakes, roses, and it does hold up. Yum.

LOVED IT!! I am new to the baking world and have generally end up with baking disasters. I was apprehensive when I read the reviews on this frosting, but I had to try it for myself. I wanted a frosting that didn't use icing sugar, and this fit the bill. I mixed the milk (and some 35% cream) and flour first then cooked it until the bottom started to get thick and took it off the heat. Be sure to keep stirring as it cooks. I used a hand mixer (I read how lots of people used kitchen aid mixers and didn't know if a hand beater would work - it DOES!) I beat the sugar and butter until smooth (3-5 mins) and then added in the flour/milk mix and beat it smooth and added drops of red food coloring for pink frosting. Popped in the fridge for 20-25 mins, out and piped it onto vanilla cup cakes. Its EXACTLY the kind of frosting I wanted, not too sweet, smooth soft texture. This is a keeper!! I even joined allrecipes.com to comment because I feel like Martha Stewart or something, cant wait to share my cupcakes. YUMMY!

Been making this for years! Doesn't need to form a ball, just cook to a boil (stirring constantly) and it will be a thick paste, like pudding. Cool partially, stirring every couple of minutes, then press a sheet of plastic wrap on the surface(to prevent a skin from forming) and refrigerate.  I make the paste while my cake is baking, so it has ample time to cool.  Beat the sugar & butter very well, add the paste and beat.  White, granulated sugar is correct:  I have made this many times since I was a kid.  Always delicious, something different, not too sweet, great for a kids birthday when they are already overdosed on sugary treats.  I make it whenever I find myself out of confectioners' sugar, also.  I love it partially because it is nostalgic for me....

the first time i made this, it was not successful. i did not whisked the flour and milk enough that i couldn't remove the lumps on the flour. in the end, i could not pipe the frosting because of the lumps. i tried it the second time, making sure to whisk thoroughly the flour and the milk on the saucepan first before turning on the stove. you have to make sure that the flour was completely dissolved on the milk otherwise there would be lumps. be patient when mixing the flour/milk because eventually it would be sticky and would be glue like after a couple of mixing. you also have to cool it COMPLETELY, otherwise the butter/sugar will melt once you combine it. i always use this now when i bake cupcakes, not too sweet but creamy and delicious. definitely the best buttercream frosting for me(as of the moment).

I made this frosting today to put on a lemon bundt cake.  I had actually read about this type of frosting quite a long time ago but hadn't ever tried making it until today.

It is superb!  I used the measurements called for in the recipe except I used Lemon Extract instead of vanilla to go with my lemon cake.  I also used Superfine Granulated Sugar.  I thought about using powered sugar but really wanted to try it with granulated.  Since I already had both the regular table sugar and the superfine, I tried it with the superfine.

My frosting was not the least bit grainy, it's silky smooth.  I first mixed the flour/milk in a shaker bottle then poured into a saucepan and cooked, stirring constantly over medium low heat until it was very thick, but not until it formed a ball.  Then I stuck the pan into the fridge for a short time, just enough to cool it down completely but not to get outright cold.

I actually used my hand mixer and didn't have any problems but I do have a good hand mixer.  Anyway, creamed the butter for a bit, added the sugar and creamed again for about 5 minutes.  Added the flour/milk mixture and creamed about 5 more minutes.  Added the extract and then creamed for maybe 5 more minutes -- so, about 15 minutes total.

Yes, this is more time consuming then traditional buttercream but the texture is simply heavenly!

I really like the flavor of this frosting, almost like a cooked custard... yummy!!  I did make one small change, I made a roux with 2 T of butter and the flour, poured the milk in and and cooked it until it was thick.  This solved the possibility of it tasting floury.  It was very creamy and I think it would be decent for decorating.  I did use a piping bag to pipe it onto cupcakes and they looked beautiful.  Also, the color is not pure white which was not a big deal for me but if you need white white you might want to try a different recipe.

Oh wow!   Light and creamy with a delicious buttery flavor.  I usually detest frosting, viewing it as a necessary evil for decorating a cake or cupcakes.  But this recipe made me view cake as a vehicle for frosting.  It is quite soft, so wouldn't work well for detailed decorations, but it was made lovely 'swirly roses' on cupcakes.  Be careful not to overwhip it, or it almost becomes too smooth and buttery (there's a fine line between gritty and buttery, but I like to use the granulated sugar).  I will definitely make this again just as soon as I can fit back into my jeans.  ;)

Delicious, but it takes FOREVER to make - with a KitchenAid, it's little hassle, but a loooong time to wait for the granulated sugar to lose its grainy feel.

Delicious! Not too sweet, oh so creamy and just perfect exactly the way it is! The "ball" formation was a little confusing. I stopped stirring when it started sticking together and got to a peanut butter type consistency. I will use this again and again!

This was very easy to make and perfect for spreading as soon as I was done mixing them together.  Cook/whisk the flour till it thickens and pulls away from your pot.  To cool I put the pot in cool water.  This is great if you want a frosting that is not too sweet.

Wonderful frosting, but follow the directions closely. The granulated sugar is not a mistage, the more you whip the better the result. Take your time with this recipe and you'll be greatly rewarded. We also served this on top of brownies - AMAZING!

This frosting is almost identical to the one my mother always used on her red velvet cake - the only exception is that her recipe has an extra tablespoon of flour.  A "ball" does not form, though.  You have to add the milk slowly while whisking constantly to avoid lumps.  If it does get lumpy, press through a fine mesh sieve.  As others have stated, you must beat the butter/sugar for at least 15 minutes on high, scraping down the sides frequently, which completely incorporates the sugar and prevents granularity.  If done correctly, you really will be rewarded with the most easy-spreading, luxuriously textured frosting.

I agree with one of the previous posters.  I didn't have trouble making this recipe, it all came together as described.  But it's not what I look for in a frosting.  It was more like a mix between whipped cream and melted marshmallows.  The taste is nothing to shout about, and if eaten chilled, it leaves a slimy layer on the roof of my mouth.  Very light and fluffy, which most people seemed to like, so I had hopes it would be good, but in the end I just wished for something denser, with more flavor.  The cake is actually better without it.

this frosting was pretty good. i would maybe use it again. it wasn't as stiff as others, so it was hard to decorate with, but i wasn't worried about these cupcakes looking great. i followed the directions- cooking and stirring the flour and milk until like a roux, and i also beat the butter and sugar for ten minutes. only had minor granular taste. i like that it isn't too sweet.

This recipe is FABULOUS!!  If you take the time to do it right it really comes out beautifully.  Like others have said... cook the flour and milk until very thick to ensure you get out all the flour taste and mixing the butter and sugar for at least 15 minutes gets out all the grit and you are left with pure heaven!!

This recipe is incredible! Anyone who gave it less than 5 stars did not cook the flour enough. Like a lot of other reviewers who prepared this correctly stated- just cook it until it is nice and thick, I actually would NOT recommend cooking it until it formed a ball.   Also, if your frosting is gritty- then it needs to be mixed more. I mixed mine in my kitchen aid mixer, with the paddle attachment, for 15 minutes. It turned out creamy, silky and perfect!!

W.O.W.!  I have read some of the reviews and took the advise of those that have had success with it.  First: I tasted the flour/milk mixture to make sure it wasn't "floury" tasting, and it wasn't.  While I let it cool, I beat the sugar and butter together for about 10 minutes.  I then added the flour/milk mixture and let it continue to beat together for another 5 minutes.  Added the vanilla extract and it came out beautifully smooth and amazing!  Can't tell you enough how amazingly smooth and delicious this is!  Thanks for posting!

I made the recipe exactly as it says apart from following the advice to make a custard like mixture instead of a ball. Used it with "Happy birthday cake" recipe. Wonderful this is a keeper!

This is excellent frosting, the best I've ever tasted. The reviewers who have given it low ratings undoubtedly had trouble with the technique and timing, which is not a fault of the recipe. It also is not the fault of the recipe if you don't know standard cooking terms like "till a ball forms" or that yes, granulated sugar can be whipped into butter until smooth. DO NOT SUBSTITUTE POWDERED SUGAR. I tried it, and the result was a heavy and slick frosting; there's a reason the recipe calls for granulated sugar, namely that with long beating the sharp sugar granules incorporate lots of air into the  butter for a fluffiness powdered sugar does not create. Acquaint yourself with the cooking techniques, don't let the flour paste cool to cold or stiff, and the recipe will succeed.

This is THE BEST buttercream frosting I have ever made! I whisked the flour into the milk before cooking it, just as another reviewer had suggested, and it turned out perfectly with no lumps! I found though that the cooked flour and milk mixture was kind of gooey and gummy... so i thinned it out with a couple tsps of milk to help thin it out a little bit. The finished buttercream  was fabulous and creamy and light! Creaming the butter and the sugar for 15 minutes is a good idea and using superfine sugar is a good idea. I will be using this buttercream recipe over and over! Be careful! The milk/flour mix get lumpy VERY easily. I would advise you NOT to step away from the pot and to cook this on low heat and to stir with a whisk.

Excellent frosting. It is light. And doesn't need powdered sugar. I followed the directions exactly and came out as described. I added a little lemon juice at the end for a citrus kick that tasted amazing and got a lot of compliments - highly recommend. As for heating the milk/flour until ball - when you heat it, it becomes visibly thick and lumplike,then when you cool it, you can scoop it into a ball shape and it will almost hold. overcooking it beyond this can cause little bits of rubbery flour/milk pieces in the frosting. this is my husband's favorite frosting now.

Yumtastic! I didn't have to go to the store either, yay!  I whisked the milk and flour together before the saucepan got warm and kept whisking until it was bubbly and thick, then I added the sugar and whisked it some more. I put it in an airtight container and stuck it in the fridge until completely cooled. Then I whipped the ROOM TEMP butter for about 5 minutes, maybe more on high, added the Vanilla (this would be even extra good with Vanilla bean paste). Then I added the milk/flour/sugar paste and whipped it some more. It was the perfect consistency for piping onto cupcakes. This recipe generously frosted 24 cupcakes with extra left over (probably enough to do 6 more). This frosting has a sweet buttery flavor without being too sweet and the best part is (besides the flavor) that if you divide the recipe 30 ways, there is only 6.5 grams of fat per serving.

Lots of butter flavor. Wonderful consistency, soft and fluffy. I have a recipe similiar to this that I have used for years, the difference is that my recipe uses half shortening and half butter. The shortening cuts down the butter flavor, it tastes more like a whipped cream frosting. Great to use for filling cupcakes. Some have said that their frosting didn't thicken up (it has happened to me as well), make sure all bowls and utensils are dry and flour paste is cooled to at least room temperature. Put in refrigerator or freezer to quicken the cooling process. Butter should be at room temperature. Beat until the frosting is silky smooth, about 10 minutes. I would suggest increasing the vanilla to 2 teaspoons to help balance the strong butter flavor. It is a soft frosting, but I still use it to do borders and for writing on cakes. For chocolate frosting, add 2-3 tablespoons of cocoa.

This just never acquired a "buttercream" flavor.  It tasted like bad milk and flour, the butter only masks this flavor.

So good it should be illegal. I've been looking for this recipe for years. I wonder if the people who rated this poorly used the correct sugar. White sugar is not a good description for confectioners 10X.

I grew up on this recipe and thought it was a family secret - lol
It is a 5 star recipe in concept but after reading the reviews and having made the same errors as a young girl learning to bake I wanted to help others so they can make it without fail every time.

1. Use 5 tbsp flour, not 4
2. Cook the flour mixture until it is a thick paste and forms globs that stick together
3. Let the flour mixture cool COMPLETELY
4. Whip the butter and sugar until it is light and fluffy - this will take some time but is critical to prevent a granular texture 
5. Add vanilla and flour to fluffy whipped butter and sugar mixture and beat until well blended,thick and fluffy
6. Because there is butter in this recipe, when you refrigerate it be prepared for a change in texture as the butter will harden - it really does not need refridgeration before or after frosting your cake

AMAZING!!!  One suggestion  make sure you blend the flour mixture and sugar mixture for at leas t 10-15 minutes so sugar is dissolved.  A tasty, light frosting will result!!!  Oh, and the more vanilla, the better! I plan on adding a little pure vanilla bean next time around!.

This is the best frosting in the world and I have made it 40 to 60 times by now. Whoever made this recipe was brilliant. 

I do not understand why everyone says to use powdered sugar? Most likely because home bakers can't think outside of the box and feel the need to "tweak" every recipe with "their secret". If you like generic nasty frosting then use powdered sugar. 

If you want a very smooth, mellow, flavorful frosting then use granulated. People are absolutely stunned by the frosting and it is so easy to flavor with anything. 

I will say you have to be patient and let the milk/flour transform into a very thick ball like substance (so thick it "balls up like dough". It will start pulling away from the pan like bread does when you have added enough flour. Add extra flour if it is being temperamental and not pulling together. 

You also have to beat the frosting a long time to get the sugar to dissolve. Keep feeling the texture between your figures. When the grit is gone the frosting is done. Over beat and the fat will separate out and you will end up with greasy and runny frosting. This is not a stand mixer friendly frosting.

chocolate frosting - add about 2 oz. of melted but cool baker’s chocolate when combining butter and flour mixture. Adjust to taste from milk to dark choc.

Lemon frosting - extract plus zest to taste

I read the reviews about cooking it long enough.  I feel I did that. I let it cool to room temperature and I did not care for the consistency. I feel like that is the reason why there were bits of it in the frosting, plus I really didn't care for the texture of it.

I LOVED this frosting! I did not cook the milk and flour until it formed a ball, but just until it was a glue-y consistency. I also used pure can sugar and put it in the food processor first for a finer grit and added a tablespoon of honey to this recipe! It really does take 20+ min to beat it to the correct consistency.... Masterful.

GREAT RECIPE!  I used baker's sugar because it's finer and blended quicker.  I also used the idea of making a roux with 4 Tbsp. of the butter with 4 Tbsp.  Wondra Flour. (also finer texture) Topped off my banana cake wonderfully!! Thanks Jennifer!

This is almost the exact same recipe that my grandmother has used for years.  Normally I am a chocolate person, but when my Gma makes this frosting on a yellow butter cake, I melt!  I make this recipe on my own now and have never had it fail.  It always turns out fluffy and creamy.

I really liked the idea of a not-so-sweet frosting, similair to the cream cheese, but without cream cheese.  After researching, and finding this is the correct type to put on red velvet (according to some), I decided to try this one out.  The flour and butter forms a "ball" in the middle of the saucepan when you stir it, it's not literally round.  I waited until cooled and beat well, but mine was still a little strange looking.  It tasted good, but had a really interesting texture.  It was a nice change, but I'm not so sure it will replace my regular buttercream.

I love this frosting as is, light & not too heavy. I did decide to add 1/2 cup melted white chocolate during the cooking process this second time, & it was even better.  But great either way.

Eh, I've made better. It tastes better with chocolate cake batter. I would use powder sugar instead of granulated sugar because it is grainy. Also, not very sweet.

Easy to mess up. Stir the flour constanly or in seconds the flour will turn into a big yucky gob. If you let it cool too much and it is lumpy, throw it in a blender and it will be fine. Definitely a strong buttery taste.

This is the second recipe I've tried and was a little worried about the time factor.  I hated sitting there stirring over the stove for so long.  I hated sitting there creaming the butter and sugar forever.  But what I hated most was that it didn't make enough because once I tasted it I couldn't help but keep sneaking little tastes!  I wanted to load my cupcakes with this frosting but couldn't with 4 dozen.  I would go through all the work again in a heart beat...but next time I'll double the recipe.  It was velveety smooth (ok a few tiny lumps but I know it's bc I cooled the flour-milk mixture too much) and not too sweet, just perfect.  Maybe can add a pinch more vanilla next time for a stronger taste.  Loved it.

If you do this right, its the best frosting you will ever make. People always tell me that this is the best frosting they have ever tasted. Be sure to use butter NOT margarine! I used to use margarine and the frosting would always come out oily when done and it would look like it was melting on the cupcakes. I finally realized that I needed to use butter, and of course it came out amazing, not one bit oily. For the part about making the flour mixture, I always just stir it until it looks like a doughy mixture (it never forms a ball) Hope this helps :)

Loved this recipe.  Very fluffy, smooth and creamy.  I made this to go with cupcakes from the Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate cake recipe.  I only had 3/4 cup butter and it still worked good.  I cooked the milk/flour mixture til it was really thick like cookie dough.  To prevent lumps, I pressed the whole mixture through a sieve with a spatula.  I used my kitchenaid mixer and whipped it for a good 7-8 min, then added my food colouring gel.  It pipes really well on cupcakes and looks very pretty.

i just used this recipe for a halloween cake im making. its tastes sooo good! one of the best frostings ive ever had. its light and fluffy and just the right amount of sweetness. one thing though, when you cook the milk and flour only cook it until its thick like a gravy. make sure to stir constantly so it doesnt get lumpy.

I have never made buttercream frosting before and I found this recipe to be very simple to follow.  However it did take a very long time to beat together.  But the end result was perfect and smooth!  SO YUMMY!

Holy Moly. I never have reviewed a recipe on here before, but I had to do this one. I have never made frosting this good, and I have been baking (to rave reviews from friends and family) for over 20 years.  I was worried that the sugar would remain grainy. I beat the butter and sugar for 15 minutes, and it was still grainy, but once I added the flour/milk mixture (which was nearly solid once it was cooled), everything smoothed right out. After it all was well mixed, it seemed very liquidy. But once it was chilled, it was perfect. Amazingly perfect.   It's hard not to just eat the frosting from the bowl. Forget the cake!!

This was SO good! I saw the picture and made it before I made the actual cupcakes, I was so excited. It totally paid off. This is the best recipe EVER. I read a lot of reviews and saw some people made it w/ confectioner's sugar and some w/ granulated, so I made mine w/ 1/2 cup of each. It came out SO well! I put in some blue foood coloring and it's beautiful! I'm going over to a friend's house to make actual cupcakes, but the frosting is going to make them FABULOUS! Thank you sooo much for this recipe. It took a while to make, but was worth it. I'll never buy frosting again :D :D :D FIVE STARS!

This frosting turned out super fluffy but not too sweet, just perfect. You have to be patient. The milk and flour won't form a ball but heat it until it becomes really thick. The butter should sit at room temperature for a few hours, don't use it cold and don't microwave it. Cream it with the sugar with an electric mixer for 5 minutes, add the milk and flour mixture, cream it with the electric mixer again for another 5-10 minutes. Make sure to put it in the fridge for 30-45 minutes. Be patient and do these steps and this will be the best frosting you've ever had!

I'm baffled at all the low scores?? Not only is this buttercream DELICIOUS - but it's pretty, and it sets up well for piping.  I can't understand if people just don't know the basics of cooking or what?  It wasn't difficult to make and the milk/flour part really isn't that confusing?? If you read the reviews and see that others said "doesn't need to form a ball" - then you're good to go.  Great recipe!  I only gave it a 4 because it was a little more labor intensive than I may have wanted... but the end product was worth it!

I will never use another frosting recipe as long as I am baking. The only problem is that I ate so much before spreading it, that I fell short on frosting for the cake.
All kidding aside, the only drawback that I had, was perhaps I cooked the flour at too high a heat, because I ended up with microscopic dumplings in it.
Nonetheless, it is delicious. I used powdered sugar in regards to the reviews.
GREAT FROSTING!

This frosting was easy and awesome! I used it on a two layer 9 inch cake and it was plenty of frosting. I dyed it purple and put it on a french vanilla cake with blackberry filling in between the layers.

What????????????
I did not care for this frosting. The sugar never dissolved, making the frosting gritty. The directions said to cook the flour and milk until it formed a ball... it never did and I gave up. (A ball??) After the frosting was on the cake it turned into kind of a crunchy, greasy unappetizing mess. Not a recipe to use again.

Amazing! Sweet, and buttery! A great frosting for yellow cake! You can make it thick or thin.

EDIT: Try refridgerating this, I just left mine in the fridge for a few hours instead of 30 mins. and the consistency came out more like a frosting.

the number of one star ratings on this recipe made me pause, but this icing recipe is EXCELLENT. the best way to make sure the flour/milk mixture works is to 1) mix the milk and flour with a whisk or fork thoroughly before heating and 2) use a microwave set to medium/low power for about 5 minutes to heat the mixture. take the mixture out every 20-30 seconds to give it a good whisk. ONLY MICROWAVE until the mixture thickens(it will have the same consistency as ketchup)!! i think the lumps come through when the milk and flour is overcooked. the procedure for the base is very similar to that used to prepare bechamel sauce from scratch. cool to room temperature then incorporate into the whipped room temperature butter and sugar. (i used a food processor set to low). its stable, light and airy.

You absolutely HAVE to have an electric mixer to make this recipe, or else the consistency does not turn out right.  Also, check the sugar amount; my husband found this frosting so sweet, he would not finish the chocolate cake it was on, and I've never seen my husband turn down chocolate.

My grandmother's recipe is almost the same, and it's AMAZING.

Tips to make this work:
1. Use 5 Tbs of Flour
2. You need to cook that flour and milk until it's the consistency of brownie batter. I stir and stir and stir until it's difficult to stir anymore!!! 
3. Beat the hell out of the butter and sugar until the sugar is barely recognizable anymore. I am talking kitchenaid med-high speed for about 8-10 minutes. Stop to scrape down every now and then. This is essential to get a smooth consistency and no crunchy sugar! And this is all before adding the vanilla. Make sure it's creamed properly before doing so.
4. Beat the entire thing together until it's fluffy. That means don't turn off the machine until you have fluffy wonderful creamy consistency of icing. It looks like it's separated in the beginning, it's okay, just keep mixing and mixing and mixing. I promise it will eventually all blend together!!!

This was the lightest, fluffiest frosting I have ever eaten.  Not too sweet.  I used this for cupcakes for a friend's wedding and it got rave reviews!  I took the advice of another reviewer and beat the flour mixture in for about 15 minutes on high in my KitchenAid.  Turned out beautiful!  For optimum flavor you really should make it the day before.

I've looked for a super smooth and creamy frosting like this for a long time. Using superfine sugar is a very good tip, or else you have to beat it forever to get the coarser sugar to dissolve.   If you use unsalted butter, add a pinch of salt;  it needs it.  Cook the milk and flour, stirring constantly,  until you cannot stir down the boil.  That will get rid of a flour taste and adds beautiful texture to the frosting.  Have patience and follow directions.  This frosting is a dream come true.  NOTE:  it does not "harden" nor develop an outer, drier layer.  It stays very creamy and soft.  Just perfection!

I posted this recipe and I am glad so many of you have tried it.  It is certainly my favorite frosting.  As a kid whenever my mother was making a cake this was the frosting that went on "Aunt Mary's Chocolate Cake", which I have posted also.  

I just wanted to add, after reading several reviews, I have never used powered (confectioners) sugar.  All the years I have made this (and my mother before me) I have always used  regular/granular sugar.  The trick is to just beat the c**p out of it.  Enjoy!

Fairly quick and easy. I agree with a previous review, it is very important the flour and milk be allowed to thicken adequately. My only improvement to this would be to cut back a little on the sugar, it was a bit sweet for me. Otherwise, a great recipe.

If you don't have powdered sugar, or if you are new this is a great starter frosting. If you don't mix the ingridients just right it has a more icingf consistency or even a grainy one. Make sire to have a good porportion of flour and milk. Add it to the milk on a medium low heat. Do not blend the mixture, if anything wisk it, then use and electric mixture. If you do blend, do so for a short periodor the mixture will be too thin. When the mixture is thick and whipped looking put it in the fridge and wait. Patience is key in this tasty recipe! Good luck.

Awesome recipe! Just what I was looking for to frost my cupcakes with. Took the advice of another reviewer and added the flour gradually to the milk and kept on whisking. Also used icing sugar instead of granulated. I added orange flavoring instead of vanilla and added some colouring. Twas just perfect!!

I made this for the first time today and I loved it!!!!!!  I even doubled the recipe to make sure I would have enough.   It's nice and buttery but not too sweet.  This is the one you need if like you're like me & think rhe buttercream icing is way too sweet!  
 I was a little nervous after reading all the reviews about cooking the milk & flour, then making sure it was cool enough before adding to the butter/sugar mixture.  All in all I did pretty good for my first try.  Hopefully everyone likes this at the party tomorrow!!

It's a little misleading to say cook the flour and milk into a "ball."  It will be like paste but will not be a "ball" until it has cooled.  Don't cook the devil out of it hoping to create the "ball."  A couple minutes after it thickens (and on reduced heat) is OK.

I made 1-1/2 recipes of this to have a generous amount, and added a teaspoon of salt to keep it from being bland and 18 packets aspartame sweetener to bring up the sweetness.  Without this I would have rated it a three at best -- it's just not as sweet as you would expect a frosting to be.  (But it does have less calories and carbs.)

I suggest using very fresh flour only for this.  Stale flour adds an off-flavor here that might not be detectable in savory foods.

I didn't try the powdered sugar but see no reason why; there's enough moisture in the "library paste" to bring all sugar into solution.  Just beat at high speed like it says.  If using powdered sugar, it probably should use 1-1/2 times as much as granulated as powdering makes it less dense.

I made this frosting for a cake I was making for a baby shower.  I'm just starting out on a *very* small time basis with making cakes for local friends and family.  I had already made a "special" buttercream recipe from The Cake Bible to frost the cake, but at the last minute I decided to to the decorations in a completely different way than I'd originally planned.  This called for another large amount of frosting, but I didn't have any more of the fancy liqueur called for with the other buttercream recipe... so I looked for another recipe that would be easy, have ingredients I already had available, and wouldn't be the disgustingly-sweet shortening "buttercream" most recipes are this site... I found this one, and decided to try it, even though the ratings are only so-so.  WOW.  I had no issues whatsoever... my "I don't care for sweets" husband even liked it... it colored beautifully for my decorations, piped wonderfully... and had the texture of whipped cream which a bit more substance...buttery whipped cream!  My only changes were to use powdered sugar, since I had so much of it, and I was hoping it might add a bit of stability to the frosting for decorating, and I used almond extract instead of vanilla, to go along with the more "expensive" buttercream I'd already frosted the cake with.  Overall, the cake was a hit, this frosting was a hit, and I'm absolutely going to make it again!

This was very yummy and quite easy.  I followed the recipe and the suggestions. I cooked the milk and flour at a low-medium heat, whisking it gently while it thickened to make sure it didn't burn/scald -- about 5 minutes.  I  cooked it until it was quite thick.  I beat the butter and sugar for 10 minutes to make sure it was past the "gritty" stage -- quite easy to test by just tasting.  The butter/sugar mixture cooled to room temp while I mixed the  milk/flour mixture and then I folded both together and beat another minute, after throwing in a dash of vanilla.  I let it sit in the frig. for 20 minutes to thicken slightly.  It made a lovely, light-tasting frosting -- my husband raved that it was not heavy and super sugary -- like canned frosting.  I'll make again -- I always have these ingredients on hand and I'd like to make a chocolate version next time.

Very easy if you follow directions, don't worry about making "a ball". Just make sure the flour and milk get thick.. I whisked it the whole time and cooked it on a really low heat. I used granulated sugar and beat it for about 15-20 minutes off and on. I would do it during commercial breaks while I watched t.v.. It tastes so good!! I use either vanilla extract for the flavor or Mrs. Butterworths Original flavor pancake syrup. It's REALLY good!!  Don't be afraid to try it.

This is not to my liking! I read the reviews above, and I was so careful to pay attention to all the tips provided. I bake desserts very often and am the designated dessert maker on the holidays because everyone loves my cooking. So I do not accept that the disgusting texture and flavor were a result of poor baking skills. The person who said it was like baby oatmeal was right on target. Even stirring constantly with a whisk did not remove the flour lumps from the mixture. And the final product was not sweet like traditional buttercream icing. Rather, the flavor was more akin to Cool Whip. I don't recommend this recipe at all. Take the couple of minutes, if possible, to go to the store and pick up confectioners sugar. It'll be worth it.

this was a ok frosting, but the flour and milk would clump up in the frosting, and made it taste bad. I would probably not make this frosting again.

I ran out of icing sugar for frosting my cakes so this was a lifesaver!!! For chocolate buttercream i added about a 1/4 cup of cocoa powder then beat it with an electric mixer. The flour mixture never really forms a ball but it does get noticably thicker. Thanks for this great icing recipe with no icing sugar!!!

This is the most delicious, silky, creamy, decadent buttercream!  I've been making this type (with the flour) for years and use it on almost any cupcake, cakes such as banana and red velvet, and some cakey bars,   I've never had it fail.  The flour/milk 
does not need to form a ball - just stir till good and thick and it boils a bit.  I usually put a little piece of plastic wrap right on the surface of the mixture to prevent a "skin" of any sort as it's cooling.  I beat 
the butter and granulated sugar together first for only a few minutes, maybe 3-5, then with the room temperature flour mixture till fluffy and creamy, maybe another 3 minutes or so.  I've never had a 
floury taste nor a gritty texture.  This is really very easy to prepare and is very conducive to flavor variations, with chocolate being my favorite ( add cocoa and sometimes also some melted semisweet 
chocolate).  The only change I've ever made to this recipe is 
sometimes adding 1 extra tablespoon of flour for additional 
thickening.  Otherwise, follow this recipe as is for the most wonderful buttercream!

Very Very good! This was my first time making a buttercream frosting so I just kinda went with it. I mixed the flour and milk BEFORE putting it on the stove. When it starts to thicken up, take it off the heat. It also says the milk and flour will form a ball but it never does, so was confused about that part. The frosting was absolutely amazing! To remove the grainy sugar, I whipped it using my Kitchen-aid electric mixer and its came perfect! Don't refrigerate too longg. My cupcakes were a hit! THANK YOU!! (:

I have been searching and searching for a buttercream frosting that doesn't taste like you are taking a bite out of a stick of butter. 
So many recipes call for far too much sugar and way too much "grease"! Finally I found this and it is great. I tried giving it a couple of tablespoons of Nutella for a hazelnut flavour and for that I should have cut down on the recipe's sugar because it was a bit on the sweet side. But this recipe beats anything else I have tried. Kudos to Jennifer for sharing it. Easy to make and turns out great!

Realllyyy good frosting!!! Im rating a 4 because it took a longgg time to make. Firt step took foreverrrr and was unclear. How much heat? For how long? It didnt really turn into a "ball" but it was a sticky consistincy. I had it on medium heat for about 20 minutes. 

I used this on mini white cupcakes and everyone loves em. I added a little more vanilla so just tast before icing the cake/cupcakes. 

I dont think ill make this again just becausr there are so many recipes that are almost as good and take 5 minutes as opposed to near 30.

I tried mine with brown sugar.  The taste was awesome.  It was still tiny bit gritty even though I whipped it forever.  It was a little too soft in consistency (and I used 5T of flour), so I put it in the refrigerator before I iced the cake.  Then I kept the cake in the fridge.  Very good and easy to make!

This frosting is beyond amazing!  I made it for the first time today to top off banana cupcakes.  Based on what some reviewers said about it being too buttery tasting, I made it with half shortening, half butter.  Making it this way though, there wasn't enough butter flavor, so I added another 3 tablespoons of butter.  Taste came out just right, meaning the amount of butter flavor, as well as the sweetness.  I had seen this same recipe on another cooking website, and on that website they added 5 tablespoons of flour instead of the 4 tablespoons on this website.  Because some people said the frosting was a little too soft, I made it with the 5 tablespoons of flour.  For me it also did not cook into a ball; just thick, which is perfect anyway.  The frosting is still too soft for filling a cake.  It would just ooze out.  But there are so many other things it can be used for, like frosting the outside of a cake or topping cupcakes.  I think the texture is also perfect for filling doughnuts.  Also, I took another reviewer's recommendation and put the sugar in the blender first, to make a superfine sugar.  Because of that step, I didn't have to mix it as long as some people said they had to.  The end result was a smooth, silky frosting, and yummy beyond belief! If it were possible to give it more than five stars, I would.

I am a slightly above average cook/baker at best...this recipe is AMAZING!!!  The lightest, smoothest, fluffiest frosting ever.  It is, in my opinion, a cake only frosting...not cookies.  And it's NOT hard.  I substitute powdered sugar.  It doesn't form a ball...never forms a ball for me...but it does take a while of cooking and stirring (like 20 minutes).  then just follow the recipe.   It is amazing...truly amazing.

I was more than a little nervous when it came to adding the milk/flour mixture in with the creamed butter & sugar, but so glad I didn't hesitate. It was delicious! It got rave reviews - in fact, people told me next time I should just bring the frosting and spoons and forget the cake! It was light and fluffy and not too sweet - the usual problem with frosting in my opinion. I used it on a Pillsbury gluten-free cake mix (I'm a cook, not a baker!) and I also used gluten-free all purpose flour and organic vanilla rice milk for the milk/flour mixture. It worked beautifully! Next time I'm going to try a vegan version using coconut oil instead of butter and see what happens...will let you know how it works out!

i have been making this recipe for 30 years,  but the recipe i have is called Poor Mans Frosting, it  has always come out great, i use 1/2 butter and 1/2 crisco, if you use all butter its too soft, and needs to be refrigerated, the flour and milk should come out like oatmeal, thick and a paste, let cool a little and start putting it in your mixer  with the butter/crisco and sugar mixure a little at a time as you blend on high speed, beat together for at least 5 mins. Its great all the time, i freeze any remainder and defrost and use again another time.

This is a fantastic frosting recipe. I followed the directions exactly and took the advice of other posts, and my frosting turned out perfect! I do, like others here, recommend mixing your ingredients long enough to obtain that smooth creamy wonderful consistency that will please every palate.  I will use this recipe for all my frosting.

Not good at all.  My little ones were very disappointed, also! They helped make the cupcakes that the icing were going over.

I have never successfully made butter cream frosting before, but this came out perfect. I was worried about the granules of sugar, but it seemed like soon as the roux was added the sugar disappeared. it was smooth, light, fluffy, and not too sweet. I didn't have any vanilla left, so I added some caramel ice cream syrup and oh man, was it good!

I have never made homemade frosting before because I was always intimated by the idea. I read many of the previous reviews for this recipe and took the advice of at least 1 other person and made the roux before adding my milk. It did still take about 10 minutes to thicken. Having never made frosting before I wasn't sure what temperature to cook the mixture on, but I used low and then upped it slightly a few minutes in when I thought it might be to low. I followed the rest of the original recipe and it was so delicious!!  I could not stop licking the beaters! I would definitely recommend this frosting recipe to anyone, and even those who are brand new to homemade frosting. Next time I'll try experimenting with adding flavors.

I have been making this recipe for over 40 years and it ALWAYS gets rave reviews. I prefer using 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar instead of granulated . Make sure to beat at least 5 minutes after the cooked mixture is added so it is light and fluffy. You can make it chocolate by adding 3-4 oz. of melted unsweetened chocolate. This frosting is perfect for people who don't like "sweet" frostings.

I got this recipes from my Grandmother who used it for years before I was born.  Our amounts are 1/2 of what is listed but are the exact ingredients.  To make the flour/milk mixture cook until it is really thick (follows the spoon around the pan).  For the butter/sugar mixture, we use regular white sugar.  My recipe states to beat it for 4 minutes, then add the cooled flour/milk mixture and beat for 4 more minutes then add the vanilla.  Great frosting.  Compliments the cake without overpowering it!!!

This is probably my favorite frosting I've ever made! It is delicious, very creamy and not overly sweet...very rich, but oh, so good! I made it to frost some fat-free chocolate cupcakes I made (I guess this probably took something from the overall health factor of the cupcakes, but oh well! It was worth it!) and loved the results. I used a clean paintbrush to paint a stripe of food coloring paste on the inside of my pastry bag before filling it with the frosting to make the two-colored effect on the finished frosting. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe...I am going to make this a lot!!!

This is basically the same recipe as Waldolf Astoria frosting. You don't need to cook until the milk and flour form a ball, just whisk constantly over low heat until it becomes thick and pasty. Don't let chunks form on the bottom of the pan. When it is pasty remove from heat and let cool completely. Also, cream your butter first until it's nice and whipped, THEN add the sugar and cream again until light and fluffy. If you take the time and do it right this is an excellent buttercream recipe, especially if you're like me and don't like the super sweetness of frosting made with tons of powdered sugar.

I only made half the recipe, and it was more than enough for 2 dozen cupcakes! Very delicious and smooth frosting! Oh, and don't worry about making the milk mixture into a ball. Just thicken it.

I'd go 6 stars if I could.  this is the ONLY frosting recipe I'll ever use.  People who had trouble just didn't do it right.  Cooking the flour mixture until very thick is critical for success as is beating the REAL BUTTER and sugar until the sugar has dissolved. I'd remind you to keep any leftover cake in the fridge but you won't have any left with this frosting!  WONDERFUL!

A little cooking experience and patience is required for this recipe. You really have to wait and cook the flour & milk until it is thickened. The consistency should be about like bread dough, maybe a little less elastic. Don't be put off by the frosting's appearance before the other ingredients are added! When you're done, you'll have an amazingly fluffy frosting!  I made a Chai icing out of this by steeping two Chai teabags in the milk beforehand, and it was wonderful. The second time, I made blackberry icing by adding a handful or two of previously frozen blackberries at the end of the recipe.   The reason I love this recipe is it only uses one cup of sugar; most icings require four or more cups of powdered sugar. With this recipe, the frosting is not too sweet, and is healthier as well!

This recipe was a big hit! As suggested by another reviewer, I made sure to mix the butter and sugar for 15 minutes so that it wouldn't be gritty! Also, I wasn't sure if I would know when the flour mixture was thick enough, but it became very obvious when it reached the "thick" point (as someone else said, a ball doesn't need to form)! Oh, and if you are going to ice a cake, you need to double this recipe! This will be my standard buttercream recipe from now on!

Excellent consistency - excellent taste.  This is my new favorite buttercream frosting!  You'd never know it has flour in it - not too sweet, either, like the traditional buttercream.

This recipe is great! I wanted to try making it first before the cake, just to try and it worked, threw it in the fridge so I can start the cake. When the cake finally cooled, I took the frosting out of the fridge and started whipping it again with my mixer and it started to curdle. That really scared me and I thought it was ruined. But I left the mixer on for over 5 minutes and it whipped back to its fluffy state! I recommend making the frosting and decorating right away, to avoid the curdling. Flour and milk mixture, I just cooked it til it thickened. Also, it was a very warm day and the cupcakes held really well in the heat.Great taste too! Another keeper!

This truly is the best buttercream frosting. Like another user stated you need to blend the sugar and butter for AT LEAST 15 minutes to ensure it's nice and smooth. It's super easy to make. I used it on some cream cheese cookies and they didn't last through the day =)

It was fantastic! Just follow all of the suggestions to stir stir stir and it comes out like a dream.  Tastes like something that would be used in a high end bakery.  This will be my go to recipe for homemade frosting!!!

This recipe would work great as a substitute for pastry cream or merinuge buttercream if you ever run out of egg yolks or whites! A trick for eliminating the gritty sugar taste: boil the sugar with the milk and flour! Boil it for about 15-20 minutes. And definitely make sure it's cool before you add the butter at the end. When it's cool enough, it will look like very thick glue.

I don't really have anything to compare this recipe to, as I don't think I had ever tried real buttercream frosting before.  I even got a complement on it. I didn't have any problems with graininess due to using the white sugar, as I creamed the butter and sugar for a while.

I've never made buttercream before and ..oh my god, this was so light, fluffy, and delicious!  So much better than anything I've ever bought from the store.  I can see how people had issues with the graininess, but I kept beating the mixture after adding the flour/milk and it eventually went away.  Also, I highly recommend using a sift to put the flour in the milk, continuously whisking over medium heat, and then let it cool for about an hour.  It was actually cool to the touch when I added it to the sugar.  After the frosting came together, I added 1/2 cup of melted chocolate chips.  Orgasm in a bowl.

I am totally blown away by this frosting!  Not only did I use a hand mixer (ouch, might I add) but I also live in southeast Texas and my kitchen is HUMID!

Right before I combined the butter/sugar with the milk/flour mixture, I took a slight taste of the former.  Still gritty.  After adding the flour/milk goop and splashing on the vanilla, I was totally caught off guard when, after sampling once more, I found the frosting to be as creamy as I could imagine!

I will definitely make this frosting again.  But first, I will invest in a bowl mixer.

I made this frosting today for the first time, and boy is it good! It's a lot of work but it gives you a smooth, creamy texture and an amazing flavor that you can't get with confectioner's sugar recipes. Like others suggested, I whisked the flour with the milk before I cooked it over low heat. I cooked it until it was the consistency of pudding, and then let it cool while I beat the sugar and flour together (about fifteen minutes). Then I beat the milk mixture into the sugar/butter mixture for another five minutes. A totally smooth, not-too-sweet frosting with hints of caramel flavor. MMMMM!

Wow!!!!  This frosting is to die for!  Really.  If you take your time, follow the recipe, be patient, it is absolutely awesome.  I could have just eaten the frosting out of the bowl - seemed sad to waste it on a cake!  It is just the right amount of sweet, so smooth and creamy...  mmm.  I wish I could've given it 10 stars.

Usually i find frostings to sweet but this one had just the right amount of sweetness. One tip when cooking milk and flour it may take a little while and you'll wonder what your doing wrong but just be paitent and the ball will form.

I don't know about anyone else but mine NEVER came to a ball...I was very hesitant after that about this recipe...but went ahead and finished it. I refrigerated it for about 2 hours and then frosted cake with it. It wasn't a very sweet frosting which I liked...and once my cake was served...I got HUGE raves!!

This was good, but not at all what I expected.  I followed the recipe and got a beautiful, smooth and creamy frosting, but it wasn't sweet enough for my tastes.  It kind of tasted like a cross between a big chunk of butter and whip cream.  This is exactly what it says....butter-cream frosting.  I like it a lot more after it was in the fridge for awhile.  Now it definately tastes more like whipped cream, but that's not what I was looking for.  Not sure if I'll ever make this again, but it was definately worth a try......if I ever did make it again I would definately add more sugar!  Thanks! :)

WOW, you either love or hate this recipe.  I love it because it is  the same recipe given to me by my Aunt Joan who is an excellent cook!  Some pointers: cook the flour and milk on low and stir with a whisk constantly.  You'll know when it's done, it thinkens in a blink of an eye.  Remove from heat.  And folks, you MUST whip the butter and sugar for at least 15 minutes.  Use your stand-up mixer or else you are going to get a sore arm!  In that amount of time, the flour mixture has now cooled sufficiently.  Add the flour mixture SLOWLY and beat together very well.  Mine turns out GREAT every time!

Very good, you don't need to wait until it gets into a "ball", mine worked out ok when it was just thickened alot. Is good with regular white sugar, if you don't mind a gritty texture...if you do, definately use confectioners sugar.

04/00 - Very sweet and tasty, but not at all like buttercream.  Quite difficult to make and apply due to maleble texture.
11/06 - Tried this recipe again after 6 years using 10x confectioners sugar (had never heard of 'white sugar' last time around) and followed the recipe exactly; it still did not come out or taste as expected. I must be doing something wrong, but don't know what. I will not make again - my family wouldn't eat any more after the 1st bite. Sorry.

This is a great recipe if you remember to cool the flour mixture to room 
temperature.  Must also beat for quite a while(approx 10 minutes)before mixture
begins to thicken.

This was a nightmare. It was runny and looked and tasted nothing like buttercream. I suggest trying to find a better one.

Love this--it's easy and delicious!  My favorite for YEARS.  Fluffy, not-too-sweet, not grainy & not greasy.  I use this to frost between layers of the cake before layering another filling on top, (such as jam or lemon curd) to prevent the jam from getting absorbed into the cake.   The trick is to plan ahead--gotta let that flour/milk "pudding" mixture cool completely!  (I set my hot pan in a bowl of ice to speed up the process when I'm in a hurry.)  AND  whip everything until fluffy, first the sugar and butter  and then again when you add the "pudding".  And use whatever flavoring you want--don't limit yourself to vanilla.  I tried coconut and lemon and frosted a triple layer cake with lemon curd between the layers...like heaven!

This was very good. I made sure to beat the sugar and butter for a long time maybe 20 minutes or more and it was not gritty at all. I will never buy icing again

I never change a thing when I make this recipe. I love not having to use shortening or powdered sugar. I've made this at least 10 times and it's become my go-to. Tips: cook the flour mixture enough (it should be able to basically keep its own shape). Let the "ball" cool enough but NOT in the fridge. Beat it for quite awhile. Voila!

For those of you with questions about granulated white sugar, extra fine white sugar, and powdered confectioners white sugar, here's the secret:  put granulated white sugar in the blender.  It will become extra fine, and if you blend it long enough, it will become powdered.  This is how the food companies get us to pay MORE for something we can do in our own kitchens.  Same thing w/brown sugar; just add some molasses to white sugar.  (That's how they got it to turn white; they REMOVED the molasses.  Just put it back in.)  And vanilla sugar:  just add a split vanilla bean to a container of white sugar.  Easy as pie, and twice as good.

My family has been making this for years.  the flour mixture never turned into a ball as recipe says, we always cook until thick and a grey-ish blue in color, the trick is not letting the mixture get to cold and beating the butter and white sugar until it looks like whipped cream and all sugar is dissolved. (it will even turns white) add the flour mixture to the butter a tbl spoon at a time and beat well between each drop. it is very time consuming, but worth every minute. Was looking on a good way to make this chocolate,but have not seen.

This is a great frosting that's smoother and lighter than ordinary buttercream with powdered sugar and butter. We're gluten free so I use corn starch instead of flour. I think it's easier than working with flour because corn starch dissolves more easily and firms up more quickly. Mix 5 tbls of corn starch into half the milk -- whisk until it's all dissolved. Then put it on the heat, and stirring CONSTANTLY on medium-high heat, wait about a minute or two. It will quickly firm up. I continue to stir for another minute, then put the mixture in a bowl to cool in the fridge. Then continue with the recipe as shown.
Also -- if you beat the butter and granulated sugar really well for a long time, with soft (warmed to room temp) butter, you'll have a smoother, fluffier frosting. If you use powdered sugar, well, you don't really need the cooked flour because powdered sugar contains corn starch, so you might as well just follow a different recipe.

One of the best I've ever tasted. Made it for my daughters birthday because butter cream is all she'll eat. She is lactose intolerant so I used almond milk in the frosting and the coconut pudding filling (almond milk works great) I read the other reviews and agree with the lady that said the flour/milk mixture does not turn to a ball but as she said like mashed potatoes put thru a food processor. After it cooled down I put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes and then added it to the butter/ sugar mix. It turned out so nice. By the way if you get any lumps just use an electric hand mixer and beat it for a minute, it really smooths it out. I highly recommend this frosting, it beats those greasy tasting store bought ones hands down. I will be using this from now on.

seriously the best frosting ever!!!  I really questioned whether this was going to work throughout the whole process.  I blended the flour and milk in the bullet and then added it on the stove.  I also used some heavy cream along with the milk...just because I had it.  It did not take long at all to get to thick.  Actually I forgot about it while I put the butter and sugar in my kitchenaid.  It got thick a lot thicker than expected.  The sugar did take a long time in the kitchenaid to melt. But not as long as some of the other reviews I read.  Probably about 10 min.  I also thought it did better on medium than high. I also added a 1/4 powdered sugar because I thought it was not going to be that sweet and I knew my cake was not that sweet. My flour milk/milk did get to a ball stage though I was not expecting it too.  

I added it to the sugar/butter with the sugar not completely dissolved and when it was just barely warm hoping the small amount of heat would melt the sugar...turned out just perfect.  The most delicious creamy frosting ever!! (though I don't think I needed the extra 1/4 cup powdered sugar...should have trusted the process) I could not believe it.  I've never made frosting by adding cooked milk and flour...but it definitely works...so much so that I had to submit a review.  

It takes some time but it's definitely worth it!!  Thank you!!

I give this recipe a 5, but I DID make this change: I use 1/3 cup flour, mix it AND the sugar together, THEN add the milk and cook until thick. Cool and add vanilla and butter after. Excellent light and fluffy frosting, perfect for Waldorf Astoria cake!!

This is the best frosting I've ever had. I have used this every time I need to impress people AND IT WORKS :) I have made this for my hospital parties, my daughters pre-school parties, superbowl..-this frosting is a hit with all ages! Don't make this frosting if you don't want people hounding you for the recipe. Its not gritty, to sweet or greasy and it doesn't leave your mouth feeling "coated" like a lot of shortening based frostings. I use a very very similar recipe from this website http://tastykitchen.com/blog/2010/03/a-tasty-recipe-thats-the-best-frosting-ive-ever-had/

I have been making this as a frosting since 1969, when I came across it as a filling for a chocolate cake. Not only is it delicious and creamy, but uses remarkably little sugar and fat since the flour paste makes up for a cup of shortening. It must be cooked to a stiff paste, like mashed potatoes that have been put through the blender. I have not found it very useful for intricate piping work, but might use it for soft piping with a large tip. If you use granular sugar, beat it until no grit remains, 10-15 minutes with a stand mixer.

(1) Beat the sugar/butter mixture for 15min. (2) Cook milk & flour mixture on medium heat until it reaches "mashed potato consistency" approx. 15-20 min. As for the rest... stick to the recipe. DELICIOUS

this frosting was good but not the mind blowing, life changing frosting everyone was talking about. It was not very sweet, I like that, and it had an amazing light and fluffy texture that was just yummy, but maybe it was in my vanilla extract that the frosting fell flat for me. It just did not pack that punch that would make this a go to frosting. I will make this again and use different flavor profiles to maybe kick it up some. 

Tip's: the first time making the flour and milk part the heat was on medium high. that is way to high. When I added the flour it thicken up right away, so there was no time to get that raw taste out of the mix. also cooling it all the way will make the flour milk lumpy when mixing. if this happens start over. it will not work to give you that nice fluffy smooth texture we are all looking for. how I combated this problem. one I warmed the milk on the lowest setting of my stove. then added the flour all at once. mixing the whole time. it wil thicken very fast even on low take off the burner. mix mix mix. then back to the low heat to cook out that nasty flour taste. note if it form's this ball it will be hard to get it smooth. mine was a smooth white roux kind of gummy in texture. cooled for about 15 min. beating it every five min so a skin could not form. Sorry for the long post and I hope this all helps.

Surprised how this ended.  I decided to make this since I didn't have confectionery sugar.  I was nervous about making it since I didn't have an electric mixer but I managed to make it light an fluffy.  The trick I found to the flour milk mixture was to cook it on high stirring  constantly then stop stirring it for maybe 15-20 seconds.  When I returned to stirring it thickened right up!  Instead of a ball look for the mixture to be like cake batter or brownie batter consistency.  Once it is thick remove from heat and cool.  I then tackled the butter sugar whipping and after 20 minutes of beating on and off I thought it was as good as I could get it.  By this time the flower mixture was cool.  I mixed both together to find an amazing light fluffy concoction.  This was a hit on my cupcakes and it made so much extra I have a container in my fridge that I like to eat from! :)  YUM

I have a soy allergy so I always make my own icing, and I will tell you, this really is the best icing. The recipe actually does work just the way it is, but there are a few tips that make it easier:

-Read "white sugar" as "confectioner's sugar". I've done it both ways and granlated doesn't mess it up (and if you use fine it's not grainy either), but confectioner's sugar has a better level of sweetness in my opinion.

-Make a roux, it's just easier. Melt 3 tablespoons out of your cup of butter, stir in the flour, cook a little, add milk. When the milk starts to boil and you stir, it WILL thicken, and if you keep stirring it WILL form a ball (in that it's going to kling to the spoon and come away from the sides of the pot, turning into a ball). Sometimes, if you use too much butter to do this, the texture can be a little off, which leads us to...

-Oh no, I think I messed it up. If the dough ball has a funny texture or you accidentally blended them together while the dough ball was too hot, it's okay. If you think you messed up, mix it together anyway. Beat the hell out of it so that texture-wise it's smooth. Then chill it (I'm impatient, i pop it in the freezer). It's almost entirely butter, it will reharden. When it's more solid, beat it again until it's fluffy icing. You added a few steps, but you saved it, and I promise it tastes amazing.

I did not care for this recipe.  I read most of the reviews before and after attempting this recipe so was prepared for the challenge to get it right.  My flour/milk mixture got very thick and I allowed it to cool to room temperature.  My butter/sugar mixture was very creamy.  But when I mixed the two together, even after beating them for over a half hour the ingredients just kept separating.  It never left the liquid state either even after sitting over an hour in the fridge.

I give this recipe 5 starts! I needed a frosting recipe that did not require powdered sugar because I did not have any on hand. I must say that I am impressed with the way this turned out! (AND.. my husband loved it!) You need to beat your butter/sugar mixture for a very long time. If you have any graininess in your butter/sugar you need to beat it some more. Follow this recipe to a "T" and you'll have great tasting frosting! Will use again!

FANTASTIC frosting! Not too sweet and the perfect consistency.
The key is to make sure the flour is completely cooked (mine did not form a ball, but got very very thick) and to make sure the butter/sugar is creamed together a long time so the sugar dissolves completely.
My go to frosting recipe from now on!!

I made this frosting on cupcakes for a bunch of kids.  They all loved it and wanted another cupcake right after. They literally ate the frosting right off the top in one bite!

This is my husband's favorite frosting. He likes it on a Ho-Ho cake.  We used this recipe with a banana bar recipe, and it was better than eating buttered banana bread.

"forms a ball" meant absolutely nothing to me, and the recipe should specify more on the fact that the flour mixture cannot pass room temperature or it doesn't work, and the mixture was far too much of a liquid to be called "frosting"

I've made this frosting several times now. When I take the time to beat the sugar and butter together until the sugar is dissolved, it is delicious. It takes a solid six minutes, or longer, though. I've also substituted half the butter for peanut butter and that has worked well for a peanut butter frosting.

I have been using this recipe for twenty years, and it always turns out fine. I cannot figure out why people would sub powdered sugar in this, why not make a basic ps recipe then?  For a frosting that is a bit stiffer but tastes just as light and creamy, use half butter and half shortening. 

Remember that the flour/milk mixture MUST be room temperature or cooler! If not, you will end up with a runny mess. And the secret to this recipe is beating it, the more you beat, the better it is. 

I usually beat the sugar/butter for four minutes, add the flour/milk/ mix and vanilla and beat another four minutes, scrape, and beat an additional four minutes to make it even fluffier.

I loved this frosting. Being a person who likes sweet food but not too sweet, I used 2/3 cup sugar (and only had brown sugar in the house) instead of 1 cup. It came out wonderful. I didn't notice it being grainy despite using brown sugar. I would recommend adding less sugar to anyone else who is put off by traditional frostings (for example, those from the grocery store that are super sweet). I have leftover frosting in my fridge and plan to nibble on it..mmm

Best Buttercream is right!  I've used this for wedding cupcakes with rave reviews and the guys I work with beg me to bring them in at least once a month!

I cook the flour mixture until it's like a thick pudding and add it to the well beaten sugar and butter just before it's room temp.  I find it being a little warm helps disolve the sugar better. (but not warm enough to melt the butter)

DO NOT substitute powdered sugar - would be way too sweet.

Make sure you have a stand mixture and once you think you've beat it long enough, beat it that much more.

This recipe is tedious to make, but so worth the time and effort!

Oh wow, I'm having one of those "I can't believe I made that!" moments!  This frosting is luscious, it's my first time making a true frosting, I've tried icing before (yes there is a difference).  Definitely follow the suggestion to beat the sugar and butter for 15 mins, I think this is what made it turn out so well as it is so fluffy and creamy.  I loved it,, thank you!

Made this after reading many reviews.  I made as directed w/ no substitutions and came out better than i'd expected.  I am definately not an expericenced cook, so took the advice of others and beat butter sugar mix for 10-15 min.  I also found that constant stiring prevents from any scalding or lumps.  However while waiting for milk mixture to cool mine started to form a layer on top. I would recommend stiring a few times while cooling b/c this layer could cause lumps if cooled to much and thickened.  Luckily mine was creamy and light just as it was supposed to turn out and no gritty texture either.  Thx for the lovely recipe, really saved me time not having to run to store for whipping cream .

Very pleased with this frosting, one of the better I've ever tried.  Usually frostings are sweet and have that sugary, grit to the taste.  This one is very creamy and not overly sweet.  The only change was adding 1/2 tsp butter flavoring, 1/2 tsp vanilla and an orange tint for halloween decorating.  Kids and adults loved the frosted cupcakes.  Mahalo

I was searching for the best frosting out there and I must say this one is pretty awesome! It was very easy to make and not super sweet. Just the right amount of sweetness. It taste great and I didn't have any problem getting the right taste. I really do think that refrigerating it does make a difference when pipping.

This was a recipe that was WAY TOO easy to burn/melt etc... a ball??? didn't understand that term and the recipe directions did not mention the heat suggested to stir the milk and flour in the saucepan. A lot of it had to be estimated and I found granulated sugar made the icing very grainy. Lastly, Taking the saucepan mixture then cooling it to room temp. was nearly impossible! If it was too warm it'd melt the butter, and if you let it really cool to room temp. It stuck to the pan in big lumps and clumps.

this was a really good frosting. I gave it 4 stars simply because it looks terrible when colored.  I was looking for a recipe to replace the Wilton "butter cream" (with all that shortening ugh) this will be good for crumb coating before fondant and non colored frostings

I found this really odd. The taste was okay, not sickeningly sweet like traditional buttercream, but the texture was not very nice. The flour/milk mixture blended into the butter/sugar mixture left a very lumpy texture. No amount of mixing would have gotten rid of the lumps.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  I did not have milk on hand, so I used heavy cream.  I really liked the way it turned out with the heavy cream, I will make it like that from now on.  This recipe is AMAZING! Really, if you are debating about trying this one, DON'T!  Do yourself a favor and make it!  Not too sweet---just like whipped cream frosting!  Super light and creamy---holds shape well but is just like air!

Recipe is not very good.  Difficult to get flour lumps out as the recipe calls for cooking milk/flour until it forms a ball.  I tried this recipe twice... the second time around I only cooked it until it thickened.  The consistency was better; but still, the floury taste didn't suit.  Overall, I would not recommend this recipe.  After searching online and trying different recipes/styles of buttercream, I found one that was simple to make and delicious & MOST IMPORTANTLY DOES NOT CALL FOR FLOUR, EGG WHITES OR YOLKS (as I found with most recipes).  I guess SIMPLICITY is better (in this instance that's for sure).  Sorry, to whomever posted this recipe!

Best Buttercream Frosting Haiku: "Hmm, it's not the best. I followed the recipe. Gritty & greasy." I thought with all the great reviews and gorgeous pictures that I was in for a special treat when making this frosting for my daughter's Valentine cupcakes. (As a side note, I tinted them pink, but the shade that I came up with, well, it resembled brains, so I hope that I can re-create this particular hue of icing, should I have another Zombie BBQ.) Anyways, should I have followed the many reviewers who subbed confectioner's sugar for white sugar? I thought that seemed like a pretty substantial alteration from the original recipe, so I followed both ingredients, and technique, exactly. It wasn't difficult to make, and the frosting itself piped nice and glossy thru a cut-corner of a ziplock bag, but it tasted a little gritty, and left a slimy, heavy butter taste coating the inside of my mouth. (Not to mention my fingers.) My daughter began licking the frosting off the cupcakes, then changed her mind and instead ate the cupcake upside-down to avoid the frosting. I know, shocking! If I make this frosting again, I'll give confectioner's sugar a try instead.

This is THE holy grail of cupcake frosting. Yes, use powdered sugar. Make sure the flour is cooked. Beat it, whip it forEVER. Pipes like a dream. If it's not the best frosting you have ever tasted, throw it out and start over. A-MA-ZING.

I too use powdered sugar.  My family loves it, in fact today we had it on top of cinnamon rolls.  I find the best way to know the flour is cooked is it pulls away from the sides of my pan.

This recipe was the awesome.  It worked the first time I tried it, and I am not a cook (divorced dad trying to impress some new friends).  I added a little cinnamon to the recipe and frosted a batch of banana nut cookies.  Wow, homerun!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! Instead of 1 cup of butter I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening! Delicious!!!

Let me first thank you for posting this recipe! It was extremely easy to make, and extremely fluffy!!! My only issue with it was the icing was too buttery tasting! I know you probably can't fathom buttercream frosting being too buttery, but it was. It really tasted like I whipped up butter and smeared it on my cupcake!  Next time I will try halving the butter. As it was I added sugar and grandmarnier to try to mask the butter a bit, but it is still too strong.  I highly recommend this recipe, but play with it a bit!

I followed the recipe with ingredients as directed.  I didn't worry about a "ball"  but make sure the mixtue became thick.  I let it cool for about an hour.  I used much of that time to beat, beat beat and beat the butter-sugar mixture.  It gradually became less gritty...still was a touch...UNTIL i added the vanilla and milk-flour mixture.  It turned out WONDERFUL!!  (I did beat it for about 30 MINUTES!!)  I may need an artisan stand mixer if I make this again.  :)

I followed this recipe exactly as written by the author. I did not find that the flour and milk formed a ball. But they made a nice paste and I was happy with that so moved on to the next step.  It all mixed very well with my mixmaster. No gritty consistency. We creamed and tasted it to check consistency before adding the vanilla. Then creamed it more with the vanilla in it.  I was very impressed with this frosting.  Thank you to the author for sharing it. And I will surely be using it again. My children said "this is the best Mom".

Dont be afraid of this frosting.  It is very YUMMY and really simple to make. Its not hard AT ALL!!!  The key is to slowly add the milk to the flour so that you get a non-clumpy smooth consistancy, to not cook the flour TOO long, and to cream it with the mixer long enough that the granulated sugar disolves.  The result is scrumptious!  My WHOLE family loves this frosting

Really good frosting. I followed another reviewer and made a rue with the four then added the milk. I didn't really get the "forms a ball" part and was afraid of cooking the mixture any longer as it had already gotten pretty thinck. I added almond extract and left the mixtures to beat for about 15 minutes and it thickened up alot.

I wanted to love this frosting after reading all the great reviews, but, alas, did not.  I took others' advice and cooked the flour/milk into a thick paste (low heat, lots and lots of stirring) and beat the sugar and butter for 15 minutes. The flavor was fantastic, but the frosting had definite texture issues. had clumps of flour from the cooking that did beat out as I had hope and it was a bit greasy and "loose."  It did not hold up well on cupcakes.  Will probably not make this again.  Still looking for the perfect white frosting for chocolate cupcakes.

Made this yesterday for the 4th & everyone was going nuts over it.  It's the first time I have seen kids ask for 2nds on Cake & not the ice cream.  I heated the flour & milk until it was just thick.  Not a ball.  I tried the 1 C. granulated sugar & it was too grainy even beating it for 15 minutes.   Definitely use the 1/2 cup granulated sugar & 1/2 cup powdered.  I actually used a little less than 1/2 cup of granulated & a little more than 1/2 C. of powdered & it was perfect!  Make sure you beat it for 15 minutes.  I put a lot more vanilla than what is called for just to even out the butter & sugar flavor.  I just kept adding & tasting until it was right.  Remember, if you use a box mix, make sure you ad a huge tablespoon of Mayonnaise & a half a packet of dry instant pudding mix.  I used white chocolate pudding mix for one vanilla cake mix & one devil's food cake mix. It was so moist & so dense it was incredible.

This is the most incredible frosting I have ever made.  My whole family loved it.  I don't think I'll ever buy icing again.  I think the key to perfection is continuing to beat it.  I got all the granulated sugar smooth by doing so.

This was a good frosting!  I liked that it didn't call for too much sugar. My husband really liked it too! I used powdered sugar because I never use white sugar for frosting.  I also added color for a "star wars" cake I was doing... Color was okay, but made the frosting look more grainy.

Definitely very light, almost too light and fluffy.  We made a 4 layer cake and the layers were hard to keep from slipping around.  I also found that the milk curdles a little when you add the Vanilla to the mixture.

First time ever making buttercream frosting with the cooked flour/milk mixture.  So good!  Took the advice of others and just cooked the flour and milk until thickened (not a ball) on  med-low heat, and beat the granulated sugar and butter for about 10-15 minutes.  The texture is so smooth and the taste is delicious.

Can i just say AMAZING!!! I am not one for icing/frosting of any kind, but this recipe is great! It's soooo smooth and buttery it just melts in you mouth. It's not hard at all and take a whoel 10 mins. Like the suggestions below, mix the mik and flour first then heat. The mixture will thicken up pretty quickly, so keep on low heat. Thanks for sharing this great recipe. I will definitely use this again :)

I made it with white sugar just as it's written - it works beautifully.  Then I tried it again with confectioner's sugar (icing sugar)  What a disaster!  I had to use at least double the icing sugar for it to have any "body" .  If you chill this icing before using it, it can even be used for piping borders etc.

This is my favorite frosting.  It is perfect on Red Velvet or Spice Cake!  Do NOT substitute powdered sugar, just blend the butter and white sugar together until it becomes creamy...this can take 15 or so minutes but it is worth it.  Also, I just thicken my milk and flour.  It doesn't have to make a ball.

I don't really like frosting but this is the first frosting I've ever had that improved the taste of the cake.  I took another reviewer's advice and made a roux.  It came together quickly and worked perfectly.  Light and fluffy!

WOW!!!!!  I was looking for a buttercream recipe without using "shortening"......just butter,   and I picked the right one! This is unbelievable..so fluffy and light.  I added another 1/2 t. of vanilla and used it to stuff between 2 florentine cookies (from this site) After reading other reviews I was worried about how long to cook the flour mixture but I just cooked until it looked like paste....and didn't really let it cool very long, maybe 10 minutes.  It turned out delicious!!!!  Woo hoo!!!!! My daughter has it all over her face after licking the bowl.  great recipe

Amazing.  Just what I was looking for, not too sweet with perfect texture.  I followed recipe exactly.  I always took the "ball" stage as cooking it until it thickens and begins to stick together and lift away from the pan.  To avoid lumps, I whisked the flour into the milk prior to cooking it.  I also beat the butter/sugar mixture for quite some time - not until the sugar was completely dissolved but close.  If you make this the day before you want to serve it, the sugar should dissolve completely.  Just let it stand at room temp for a couple of hours prior to serving to soften it again.  
One more thing - don't over eat when you are combining the flour/milk with the butter/sugar mixture - I've made but this a number of times where it seemed to separate/curdle. If you mix it until it's just combined with a hand mixer it will be perfect.

This really did taste delicious.  It made up for the problems I had.  I mixed the butter and regular sugar on high for 45 minutes.  It was still grainy, but I continued on anyway.  I combined the flour mixture with the butter mixture until smooth, but when I was frosting the cake, I noticed there were little bits of the flour mixture... it looked weird... like itty bitty dumplings.  That batch set up nicely and when we finally ate the cake, there was no graininess from the sugar and no one noticed the bits of the flour mixture.  With the second batch I made, I used powdered sugar.  It wasn't grainy at all, and after combining, I still had little bits of the flour mixture even though I let that whip up extra to get rid of those bits.  Sadly, the second batch never set up properly, so I had to stick my cake in the garage overnight so the freezing cold temps would keep my cake in tact for the party the next day.  Problems aside, the frosting was delicious and got rave reviews.  I wouldn't use powdered sugar on this one but not sure how to get rid of those little flour mixture bits... I might try a different recipe next time and see if the taste is just as good...

A week later---I used this again at the request of a friend.  The little lumps were worse!  I was so worried that the frosting didn't look so great, but no one noticed the lumps and it got rave, absolute RAVE reviews for taste.  I used raspberry flavoring instead of vanilla.  Sigh... How do I get rid of the lumps?

ABSOLUTELY PERFECT flavor.  This frosting tastes like something my Grandma would have made.  It is absolutely delicious.  Not too sweet, forms up well and gives a wonderful homemade taste to any cake.  I used it on the 'simple white cake' from this site and it was WONDERFUL!

I thought this was the best frosting I have ever made, it wasn't too buttery like a lot of buttercream frostings.  The texture was just right. I changed the yield to 15 and it made just the right amount for 12 cupcakes.  I'm sticking to this recipe from now on!

I love this recipe!  I added a step 4 however, to make a raspberry buttercream frosting.  After you've refrigerated the mixture, add 1 can of Raspberry filling (I used Solo Raspberry Filling).  I used it to frost a cake last week for the first time and got many compliments, and requests for the recipe.  I also substituted a few other things.  I used Splenda instead of sugar, and whole wheat pastry flour instead of all-purpose.    In step one it mentions it "forms a ball" when cooking the milk/flour mixture.  This didn't make sense, but as someone else mentioned it is just until it's thick.  It personally reminded me of using milk/flour as a white gravy base.

This frosting turned out great!  I started by making a roux with the flour and 4 Tblsp. of the butter.  I used superfine sugar, and it took about 10 minutes mixing in my Kitchenaid mixer for the sugar to melt.  I also added 3 Tblsp. cocoa for chocolate frosting...would probably add more in the future.

This frosting is the BEST!!! I was worried it wouldn't turn out, but I was very happy with the flavor and amount of sugar called for.

Great frosting!  My first time making it and I loved it!  I did use confectioners sugar because I ran out of regular sugar though, but the flavor came up really good.  About the flour and milk turning into a ball...  I mixed the flour with the cold milk first and then I kept stirring in mid-low heat until it got thick like the texture of the butter and sugar already mixed.  It worked!   Left it in the fridge for about an hour!  And guess what?  No Lumps!  The recipe should state "confectioners sugar" instead of regular one...   My picky husband loved it!  My kids were stilling it from the bowl..... Thanks Jennifer

I accidentally put it into the fridge longer than I should have, and I beat it again, and I got crystals/looked lumpy. But the texture was so smooth. Another problem I had was it tasted funky, I don't know if it was because I used skim milk, but it tasted kinda like margarine/milk ish. But the taste was gone once I put it on the cake. Also, when I made it, I added cocoa. But in the end, it was still fairly successful.

I mixed the milk and flour before putting it on the heat and let it cool before adding it to the butter and sugar. The frosting came out marvelously!

This was very good. Made once as is, then again with 3 Tb of cocoa powder and an extra Tb of vanilla for chocolate buttercream. Delicious!

Ugh!!! This was awful! I don't know what I did wrong, I followed the instructions EXACTLY. I guess I let the flour/milk mixture sit too long, because I wound up with gross chunks in my frosting.  Despite this, I gave it a try and found that it was waaaay too sweet for my taste.  I can't imagine eating an entire piece of cake with this overly sugary frosting.

Best buttercream by far to say I can do it!! Im only 15 and this was very simple the only problm I had was when it said to heat it until it forms a ball?! Um that was hard for me to understand but then I found this other recipe that said to combine the milk and flour and heat until a smooth cream with no lumps.That was alot easier to understand and so thats the step i had to replace but boy does my family LOVE IT!! I gotta say this is the lightest and tastest buttercream I ever tasted!! five stars :P

I saw a similar recipe that I had made 1 week prior to trying this one. After reading the reviews I wanted to give another go at it. It came out SOOOO much better than the first attempt. Thanks for all the advice! Great recipe. Gonna make this one a lot! I just beat the heck out of the butter and then added the sugar gradually. I stirred the flour/milk mixture like crazy so there was no lumping (best to add flour and milk before heating up and mixing so there are no lumps to start with). I just really whipped this sucker and it paid off. I may have whipped it too much but it was still great! Thanks!

I had some trouble with this frosting.  When I added the milk mixture, the frosting looked like curds (i guess the oil from the butter and the water from the milk separated?).  Did anyone else have this problem?  I went on the internet to find out how to solve the problem (which was to add a little bit more butter and beat again), but does anyone know a way to PREVENT this from happening?   When the frosting did work out, it was fabulous :)  I added 2 tbsp of Match green tea and made a tastey green tea frosting!

I used this frosting to put on top of cupcakes. I am a beginner at cooking..the only things that i made out of scratch so far is a carrot cake from this website (so good) cupcakes and this frosting. IT tasted great but it was grainy..so i could taste the sugar. Im guessing i did something wrong cause this is the first frosting i ever made

Absolutely delicious. Definitely make a roux first with 4 tablespoons of the butter and it's almost impossible to stir and heat the flour/milk mixture too much.

I must admit, I did change one thing- I used Wondra (quick-mixing) flour for this recipe and it worked well. I mixed the butter and sugar for 14 minutes while I prepared the flour mixture. I let the milk/flour cool, but not too much- just above room temp- and added it to the butter/sugar and whipped it for 6 more minutes ( i put the vanilla in too of course). Incredibly whippy and smooth! Oh, I used the wisk attachment on my stand mixer.

OMG, this really IS the best!  The flour mixture makes the frosting stand up and stay nice on the cake.  It's not overly sweet or oily, and it's very light.  I made the flour stuff while the cake was in the oven -- it became a thick gluey glob, but it's the secret ingredient!  I really fluffed up the butter, then more fluffing with the sugar, then with the rest. My son loved the frosting, and he never cared for my old recipe with just butter, powdered sugar, vanilla and milk.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I find that this is a more labor-intensive way to get close to the same result as my favorite buttercream recipe, "Best Ever Buttercream Frosting," also from AllRecipes. I couldn't find it last night so I used this one (I only had granulated sugar). Despite beating the mixture for 20 minutes, mine still had sugar granules in it, and I would not have known it needed to be beaten that long had I not read the reviews. Due to the fact that it delivered a product inferior to what I am used to, and that the recipe is incomplete as written (cooking temp? beating speed/time?), I cannot give this more than two stars.

To make it Gluten Free I used tapicoa flour and 1/4 tsp of guar gum.  it was a little stickery, but worked great!  No one could tell it was Gluten Free.  Will definitely make again.

A complete waste.  Followed results perfectly and ended up with container full of goo.  It should also mention to not dream of piping anything on a cake with this.

I don't know if I did something wrong or what, but this did NOT work for me!
I had to add quite a bit of powdered sugar just so it would hold up (even after refrigerating it). It never did well & practically melted off the cake. 
Not a winner in my opinion. Sorry!

This just didn't taste like buttercream frosting to me, it tasted a lot more like whipped cream icing, which I am not a fan of.  I think this would taste great as maybe a filling for a cake, but not on the overall cake.  When mixing the flour and milk, I whisked so that there would be no lumps and that cooked up just fine, but when it was added to sugar/butter mix, it didn't break down completely and there were little "balls" throughout the icing.  Did not care for, but thanks for the recipe!

Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews first, so I had some lumps from not whisking the flour and milk.  I added 6 tablespoons of confectioners sugar after tasting it to sweeten it more and thicken it up.  I also put in an extra splash of vanilla extract.  It was a good spreading consistancy, but not thick enough for piping.  My husband and kids loved the taste, and I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe was extremely difficult to make.  I ended up throwing out all my ingredients because the frosting tasted more like butter than frosting.  I know it is a buttercream frosting but I wanted to taste frosting not butter. Not only was the recipe easy to get wrong, there was too much butter.  I ended up going with a tried and true buttercream that used 1/2 of the butter of this recipe.

First off teh milk and flour didn't form a ball no matter how long I cooked it. I couldn't get it not to be lumpy and it was to thin. It also tasted weird.

I was out of confectioner's sugar so I tried this but I don't think I'll use it again.  It wasn't horrible but it wasn't very good either. Nice to have an alternative in a pinch...but next time, I'd rather run to the store to pick up confectioner's sugar.  Sorry.

This was just an "okay" recipe.  I have made other buttercream frostings that were just as good (if not better) and were less work.  I probably wouldn't make again.

I'm with the "love" gang on this one.  I coomed the flour paste until it was thick but not quite a ball, and used granulated sugar, as directed.  Whipped butter and sugar a long time, and was rewarded with the most unctuous, balanced, lovely frosting ever.  Perfect for the "chocolate cake with white frosting" pregnancy craving.

This is the same recipe that my mother made ever since I was a kid and the ONLY buttercream frosting that I ever make. I usually make 1-1/2 times the recipe because I like it thick on the cake, but I've learned to cut back on the sugar when I make it 1-1/2 times the recipe (ingredients). Two keys to the success of this delicious frosting are slow cooking the flour and milk, and beating at a high speed for several minutes, also scraping the side of the bowl as you beat the frosting. Definitely worth the effort!

Was easy enough to make. I never got a ball out of my milk/flour, but it was really thick when I took it off of the heat. My family raved over this frosting and I will use it again.

Just tried this frosting on my daughter's b.d. cake - absolutely fantastic!  I paid attention to the other reviews & took the milk/flour off the heat just before it started to get really thick.  I beat the other ingredients for approx. 15 mins. and added the cooled milk/flour a little at a time - smooth as a babies behind.  This one's a keeper.

This frosting was so yummy! It takes a little time to stir, but is well worth it. It was the creamiest, most flavorful frosting I have ever made. Delicious!!

My friends loved this recipe.  It has a lighter flavor than the store bought frostings.  I like it over the store brand frostings, but there may be a better recipe out there.  Be sure to refrigerate.

Excellent--far better than store bought frosting.  I think the person who said it tasted like flour paste didn't cook it over the stove as the recipe indicates.  Thank you for this recipe.

Frosting was a hit.  I've struggled with different frosting recipes and this is definitely a keeper.  I was even asked if it was made from ice cream but that was because I had the cupcake in the refrigerator overnight.

As I as making the "ball" I have to admit I was thinking I'll never do this again.  You need  patience and a strong arm for the constant stirring.  

I used the frosting on a red velvet cupcake and they complimented each other perfectly

I made two batches of this to frost a larger chocolate cake.  There first batch I followed the recipe, the second batch I used powdered sugar instead of granulated and then I mixed the two batches.  Lastly, I added another teaspoon of vanilla. This made it perfect texture and sweetness for my liking and a match for cake I made.

This is fantastic, not too sweet, but super smooth!  To avoid a form a “skin”on the the flour mixture while it cools, I push a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface, then cool it quickly in freezer or fridge, depending on how much time I have.

I have searched high and low for a frosting. THIS IS IT!
it takes more time to beat the sugar and butter mixture but it is worth every minute. Light, fluffy, and not crazy sweet like with powdered sugar,
which I cannot stand. The flour and milk was easy peasy. This earns a 5 star rating.
Thank you SO much. This will now be my frosting from today forward.

I didn’t use a KitchenAid type of mixer and I think it caused the frosting to appear grainy when I added the food coloring. The taste was amazing but the texture was just a bit on the weird side. That didn’t stop a bunch of 12 to 13 year old boys from devouring the cake!

Okay, I’m pretty young, I’m just going into 6th grade. I made this delicious frosting and put it on cupcakes for a May the Fourth Be With You (Star Wars fanatic) treat for my class 3 years and counting, and everyone loved it! I made it today for a bake sale and everyone loves it. What I will say is you should cook the flour and milk until it’s thick; it will never form into a ball. Also, beat the sugar and butter for 15 MINUTES before you add the flour mixture. Make sure the flour mixture is completely cooled before you add it, otherwise the butter will melt and it will not be a good consistency. For all the people saying you should add confectioners sugar instead of granulated sugar, you should only do that if you want your frosting to be super sweet. I love this recipe, thank you for making it Jennifer!!

I tried making it and followed all the instructions properly, but it became lumpy and a very bad consistency. For me to get rid of all the lumps I had to melt it then put it through a sieve. The end result was not the best tasting icing also

This really is the best buttercream!!  I used my stand mixer to cream the butter and sugar for a long time then continued to mix with the flour and milk. I added more than a teaspoon of vanilla because I love vanilla!  I just let the mixer do most of the work - it’s hard to mix it for too long.  I frosted a double layer chocolate cake and still had a little left over.

I made this for my Sister’s 65th Birthday and everyone loved it. I did make  a few changes. I used Pillsbury Gluten free flour, buttermilk and unsalted butter. If you look under pictures at the Troll cake you will see the results. 
For those with issues on the flour/milk mixture  you need to make sure you stir constantly and cook until it forms a ball. I myself was very skeptical when I first started making the mixture, but it really does work.  I had never made icing with with flour or granulated sugar before but I think this will be my new go to icing.

Best ever. Be sure to use Ali’s hint (here in AR) to use 4Tbsp of the butter to make a roux with the 4 T of butter, then slowly add the milk while stirring until thick. While that cooks & cools the remaining butter & sugar can be whirring away in the mixer (I let that mix for at least 15 min, maybe more). I use the granulated sugar because I find confectioners too sweet. If there is some slight grittiness (not always; seems to depend on weather!) I don’t mind it at all. Definitely my “go to” frosting. It’s  smooth, creamy, easy to work with and very adaptable to additional flavors & coloring.

I will not make this frosting again because I am not sure what "forms a ball" means and mine never formed a ball. Also my outcome was very buttery and I think it had to do with the flour and milk mixture. which clearly doesn't work. when I put the frosting in my mouth it was like eating  a stick of butter!!!!!!!!!!!

Be patient with the first step, it takes a little while for the milk and flour to become thick. Just keep stirring and watching, and I had mine on around medium heat. I was nervous that not using powdered sugar would make it taste grainy, but it didn't at all! Very good recipe.

Great recipe, but first of all it does NOT form a ball. You only cook it until it's pasty and resembles a thick custard or pudding.

You can add melted chocolate, cocoa, coconut milk/cream, etc etc and add more milk or water to thin it down if it gets too thick.

Was super easy to make and it tasted great! I was in a jam and didn't have too much in my fridge but I had these basic  ingredients. Made a lemon cake and when this mixture was complete I added a bit of lemon juice and it was AMAZING...This will be my go to recipe from now on?

This recipe did not work well for me at all. I could taste the sugar grains in the frosting (I whipped for 15 minutes). Also, the flour and milk mixture did not incorporate well, it left clumps in it. The frosting did not have any stability, I won't be trying this recipe again!

I love this frosting so much. For the flour and milk mixture, you just have to cook it long enough for it to become thick. When the mixture cools, it becomes gelatinous and if you mix it, it forms into a ball. To get rid of the gritty texture in the butter and sugar, all you have to do it blend it for a while and it becomes so creamy and smooth.

This has been my go-to for all cakes and cupcakes for years now. It also makes a great filling for whoopie pies and filled cupcakes or donuts. I like it thicker, so I use a third of a cup of flour, and beat the flour mixture into the butter/sugar in 3 increments. One warning - this does not hold up well to heat. Tucson's weather, even in October, called for picnic cakes to stay in an ice chest until served. ??

PATIENCE is key. I made it to try it a wk before the birthday party and it was to die for. Then I was running like crazy the day of the birthday party and tried rushing through the process and I screwed up! Will make again tomorrow for another party. This time, the day before.

I only used this recipe because I ran out of powdered sugar and had a cake to frost. I followed the directions to a T and didn't have any trouble. However I really didn't care for the consistency or taste. It just wasn't good. I was hoping for better because of all the great reviews but I ended up scraping all the frosting off my piece of cake. I'll stick with my regular buttercream.

Made it as directed with a change suggested by other reviewers -- added 5 tbsp of flour instead of 4. 

The milk (I used unsweetened soya as had run out of regular milk) and flour mixture thickened very quickly into a loose ball. It looked a bit like glue. I had to use a small whisk and beat it rapidly to stop lumps from forming. 

The butter and sugar mixture I beat until very pale but it was still gritty. This totally disappeared when beaten with the cooled flour/milk mixture.  No idea how that works but I was pleasantly surprised. I flavoured the icing with lemon zest, lemon extract and yellow food colouring rather than vanilla. 

I don't actually like buttercream or any cupcake style icing but I like practicing my piping. This buttercream was not sickly sweet, in fact it was curiously unsweet. Which made it more bearable to eat, but I still scraped off the rosettes and shell border on top of the cake. The coating on the outside and between the layers of the cake was more than enough for me as this icing still very much has the same "mouthfeel" of regular buttercream. 

I wouldn't say I raved over it but it was nicer than normal buttercream and less fatty/sugary too.

Pretty good! Easy but time consuming. My cooked flour and milk was not a ball like for puff pastry, but it was super thick and when cooled would make a ball. I used half butter and half Crisco, also half granulated sugar and half powdered sugar. I whipped the cooled milk/flour mixture and gradually added the creamed butter sugar mixture to the flour mixture whipping well after each addition. Turned out with no lumps and no grit.Could be a little sweeter...maybe more powdered sugar.  I will make it again.

This recipe is amazing ! It taste like actually icing . 
To have NO flour taste once so ever , I whisked the flour and milk together then cooked over medium heat . Also to have less grit from the sugar I mixed for about 10-15 mins (:

I have never had a recipe fail as horribly as this one did.  I followed the recipe exactly, and made sure to whip my sugar and butter for 15 minutes in my kitchenaid mixer, and I whisked my milk and flour until it 'formed a ball'.  I mixed them together, and ended up with a lumpy, grainy mess.  THAT BEING SAID... I decided to try heating up the mess on the stove (since I was going to end up throwing it out anyways), and after the sugar dissolved, I poured it through a strainer.  What was left, I put in the fridge to cool down.  And it actually turned out quite nice.  So, hopefully this will help anyone who hasn't had success with this recipe to save their ingredients.  Doing it this way, I'v actually saved this recipe and will use again when I'm out of icing sugar.

This was odd and the instructions need to be revised. This needs to be whisked, constantly.  When the milk and flour are heated they need to be whisked the entire time. When all ingredients are incorporated together, they need to be whisked. This I did not do. I whisked the milk/flour but it wasn't enough, my frosting had gross starchy chunks in it. The flavor was decent but the word of the day is "Whisk!"

Made a rue as one person suggested but when I mixed the both the rue and the butter/sugar together and put in frig for 1/2 hr, the consistency was that of small cottage cheese. It was not as sweet either.. Next time I will use confectioner's sugar as one other person suggested.  Glad I also made a chocolate butter cream icing!

Awesome Frosting!  It does require a little more time and work, especially if you don't have a stand mixer, but the end result is perfect texture and flavor!  Whisk together milk and flour well before warming and continue to as it thickens. This will give you the nice smooth texture.  Also, no joke, beat the butter and sugar for at least 15 mins...  It will be a TINY "grainy" before you combine it with the thickened mixture, but not so much that it eventually won't combine.  The longer you beat the combined mixture, the fluffier and smoother it will be.  Not overly sweet and loved it that I didn't have to use powdered sugar to make a frosting, making it not overly sweet!

I wanted to comment on the "ball" description because lots of comments I read mentioned that this was confusing . When I was a kid my mom went through a candy making phase and I remembered something about cooking the liquid until it forms a ball when you add a drop of it to a cup of water. I believe this is what this recipe is referring to.

Admittedly, I didn't read all the reviews which explained how not to get lumps, so I had lumps, but despite that, I still didn't care for the flavor. Frosting to me, just should be sweeter. After not liking taste of standard recipe, I added cocoa, but I really didn't like that either. Consistency (without lumps) was nice.

The milk/flour mixture nearly did me in. But the 3rd time was a charm. My first attempt wasn't whisked enough and the flour didn't dissolve thoroughly into the milk. There were little flour balls in the warm milk. 2nd attempt, I let it get too sticky with this image of a ball that was supposed to form. It cooled and became a gel like substance. I hoped it'd turn out right if it was whisked enough with the butter and sugar. Nope. It was like mini tapioca balls in my frosting. The third time I pulled the mixture from the med/ low heat once it was like thick gravy. I stirred it the whole time it cooled and it had a thick pudding texture at room temp when I added it to the butter/sugar. Perfection on the 3rd round! I'm glad I tried again even though I was afraid I would just waste even more butter!

I have been making this style of buttercream for several years and I have NEVER had anything but raves for it.  I admit I didn't find the recipe here, but in other old cookbooks and online sources.  It is very easy if you work carefully and pay attention to what you are doing.  DO NOT substitute powdered sugar!! The best frostings are always made from regular granulated sugar - but they usually take some more effort.  However, once you have had a good  "non powdered sugar" frosting you will never go back!  Mix the flour thoroughly into a small amount of the milk, and make sure it is completely incorporated - with no undissolved lumps.  Then, add the rest of the milk and cook it slowly over medium heat - whisking NON STOP.  The mixture will form a stiff paste when it is fully cooked and ready to go.  Don't cook it any longer once it has formed that paste.  Add the mixture to the bowl of your mixer, and add the sugar FIRST - mixing on high and letting the sugar melt completely into the warm flour mixture.  Continue beating on high until it has completely cooled - THEN add the butter, a couple tablespoons at a time until it is all incorporated.  Continue beating until it is thick, glossy and super silky.  This takes on any flavor addition beautifully and it is never too sweet - always silky and light.

Made it for the first time last night, and it is absolutely wonderful! It has a silky like texture and it's not too sweet at all! I added a tablespoon of meringue powder just to ensure I could pipe it on to my cupcakes. It turned out perfectly, YUM!!!

This is the same favorite recipe we have in the family that my aunt used to make for 60 years!  I like to shake the flour and milk in a shaker or jar. (think gravy). Forget the Ball comment.  Just thicken like gravy.  No lumps!  Make sure to use granulated and mix forever until no grit.  It’s so worth it.  Very nice frosting.  Your  guests who do not like excessively sweet frosting will like this one.

I was so excited to try this recipe after reading reviews. Unfortunately it was an utter failure. Not on my part, it came together just fine. The consistency was just right but the flavor was just not good. Also- 1 cup of flour and barely any yields.

This recipe was awesome.  It turned out much better than I expected!  It was smooth and creamy, and not at all to sweet.  A bit gritty because of the granulated sugar I used, but that may have been caused by the fact that I didn't feel like  mixing it for the recommended time (10-15 minutes).  I also added a little extra vanilla, and it was perfect. 

Will definitely be my go-to recipe.

This is a great recipe! I read some of the reviews and I had to comment. I was watching g'kids for my daughter who had to go to the hospital. She had promised a cake for a dinner that evening so g'pa finished it. This recipe came up when I searched. I made it for the first time with no problem. I used granulated auger and probably didn't let the milk/flour paste cool long enough but it was very smooth and tasty. Not grainy at all. My new favorite. I made it at home for g'ma but with Kefir instead of dead milk. My new new favorite!

I was disappointed in this recipe.  It wasn't hard to make, turned out smooth and creamy but with no taste.  If your looking for a buttercream or a truly sweet frosting, this isn't it.  It tastes more like the whipped variety of frosting.

I've used this recipe 3 times and it has not failed me yet. my family loves it and told me not to ever use anything else. so I guess that answers that! If you follow the directions, you shouldn't have any problems and don't alter anything. just wondering how it will work on cookies, has anyone ever tried it?

Wow! This is my go to frosting from now on! Both my husband and son who usually scrap off frosting loved it! I made this because I didn't have powdered sugar. I did not have patience for 15 mins  with the butter and sugar and it was gritty. I also only had White whole wheat flour. It was absolutely delicious and fluffy.I did not put it in fridge before frosting. I would be afraid to use powder sugar and make it too sweet, then my guys won't like it. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was wonderful -so creamy and delightful and not too sweet! I'd give it 5 stars but I'd prefer if it was just a *bit* thicker.  I made it according to the recipe, taking into account some of the tremendously helpful comments.  For example, while cooking the flour/milk mixture I got the mashed-potato consistency that someone mentioned; it only formed a ball once the mixture had cooled to room temp.  I used granulated sugar and took the recommendation of beating it "mercilessly" -it didn't look totally uniform/dissolved but after a while I relented, and I was pleased to find that the final product was delightfully creamy!  I'm going to try to tweak it to get it a little thicker.

This is my go-to recipe for making buttercream frosting. Every time I use it on a cake it people always ask what kind of frosting it is and demand the recipe! My trick is to substitute heavy cream for the milk. It adds just a little more lightness to the frosting when it is whipped. Like others have said, only cook the dairy and flour until it has thickened. Be certain that part of the recipe is entirely cooled before you add it to the butter and sugar. IF you happen to add it too early (like I have done) and your frosting turns to soup, refrigerate everything until it is cool and whip it up. Also, do not use confectioners sugar. If you want to add a different flavor, use some of trader joe's organic granulated sugar. For whatever reason it adds a very interesting and delicious flavor to the icing. Happy baking!

My first time making this recipe and I am astonished how delicious it is! Smooth and fluffy. I followed some of the recommendations of other posters: creamed the butter/sugar for full 15mins. Used a thermometer to make sure milk/flour did not cool too much after thickening and the smell/taste of raw flour was gone. (mine was fine at 75.. others said 80-85). Don't rush this! It is worth the time... and no garbage ingredients! Outstanding. I can't wait to color it and frost my cake. Bliss.

I followed this Recipe fully... and I thought it was amazing... I usually buy these creme filled Donuts from a Bakery in my area... and I love the cream filling... the Baker told me it was just Butter Cream Frosting... When I tasted this icing recipe I was amazed at how much it tasted like the cream inside the Donuts... This is a keeper for sure...

Good but took a long, long time to get the graininess out.  I whipped the sugar and butter for 45 minutes on high in my Kitchen Aid and then added the flour/milk mix.  That only needed a minute to mix.  I do not like confectioners sugar, too sweet for me so I am pleased with this recipe but it does take time and patience.

This is a very old recipe, used by my grandmother and great grandmother exactly as written here.  The milk/flour once it reaches a boil begins to thicken and looks like kids paste-that's what you're going for, then COOL it thoroughly. The recipe is for REGULAR sugar not confectioners sugar and to use confectioners sugar does not work properly. Once the 'paste' is cooled cream together the butter and white sugar well before combining the two mixtures. Then let it beat on stand mixer at least 10 minutes.  It is the best frosting ever.

I felt like a real gourmet! The flavor was fantastic. The texture really comes together. Read the reviews & follow the directions. Be patient. I was a little skeptical, but it worked great. One reviewer gave a temperature reading that was helpful for cooling the flour/milk mixture - 85 degrees. I also made sure I stirred the mixture as it cooled. I beat the butter and sugar for a good while (watched Downton Abbey finale) as the flour/milk cooled. The recipe as listed made enough to frost a 2 layer, 9" round cake with a bit left over. I paired the frosting with Heavenly White Cake submitted by Carol on Allrecipes.com Love this site & the reviews - so helpful for me.

This recipe, to tell you the truth, disappointed me. From all the good reviews and the amazing pictures, I imagined a much, well, better, frosting. The texture was very strange, and it was kind of tasteless. To fix this I added more vanilla than the recipe called for. This recipe should also add steps saying what it looks like at each stage. I wasn't sure if I was doing it right, even though I followed the recipe very thoroughly. Even though I am disappointed with this recipe, the final result wasn't as bad as I thought it would be... hence the extra vanilla.

I chose to try this recipe based on a few of the great reviews. After all the time and work I put into this frosting it came out lumpy. The frosting taste was good but the consistency did not come out so well at all. It was almost like cottage cheese. I do not recommend this recipe

Ok let me start by saying after reading the reviews I went into this with major patience. I ended up with a hot mess in a bowl. Too sweet and despite beating it within an inch of the poor bowl's life it was still slightly gritty. Maybe next time I will try powdered sugar or a half and half mix.

I tried this recipe for the 1st time for my husbands 40th birthday cake and his first reaction was "wow this isn't store bought is it!" Thank you this was simple and delicious!!! Just take the time to really cream the butter and the sugar so it's fluffy!

This did not turn out at all.  It did thicken eventually, but the flour mixture never became a ball, so after about twenty minutes I decided to stop cooking/whisking and let it cool to room temperature. Once added to the butter mixture it ended up full of lumps.  A half hour in my stand mixture didn't help. I really didn't care for the flavor of this either. Sorry - I was really hoping for a back-up frosting for those days I run out of powdered sugar!

Have patience and this will pay off.  Don't use powder sugar, don't worry about forming a ball, and cool to room temp.  I followed the recipe after reading a lot of the reviews.  The one thing I did do was to gradually add the flour mixture.  I also added some extra vanilla extract.  I also wisked the butter and sugar with my stand mixer for a LONG time! Adding the flour mixture while it is at room temp helps break down the sugar.  Mine is still slightly gritty, but nothing I could complain about.  Be patient and this recipe will pay off!

I tried this recipe many years ago. It's the best because I am concerned about the amount of sugar used for frosting. This recipe is not too sweet. Everybody who have tried my buttercake with this buttercream loved it. It's the buttercream that made it so special. When I tried the recipe for the first time, the milk and flour mixture got tiny lumps so I had to throw it away and do it again. The subsequent tries went well. Patience and practice makes it easier and easier. Use the lowest fire on your burner. Keep stirring the milk and four mixture ALL THE TIME. Remove the pan from  burner if the mixture starts to thicken but keep stirring. The heat in the mixture will continue to cook the starchy mixture. When the mixture is starchy enough (like the creamy peanut butter consistency), sit the pan in cold or room temperature water and let the starch mixture cool.

I am not generally a fan of butter cream frosting, however it was necessary for this particular batch of holiday cupcakes. After reading the reviews I was curious as to how this would end up. I used buttermilk with the flour instead of milk because I had some left over from another project and needed to use it before it went bad. I cooked over low-medium heat and stirred it almost continuously with a small whisk. When it got a little thicker than gravy, I took it off the heat and continued to stir. I creamed the butter and sugar while cooking the milk and flour. When everything was about room temp it all went in the mixer. I want the milk mixture to soften the butter a little so I put it in not completely cooled but definitely not hot. I followed other reviews and let the mixer go for it. After about 15 min I taste tested and it was smooth. I should have let it go a little longer because even though I scraped the sides several times there were still one or two gritty spots. Clearly I was taste testing all the way through. I could not believe how good it was. I must say it was a success. Everyone commented on how good the frosting was. It had an almost complex cream cheese type flavor. I used vanilla extract so I assume it was the buttermilk that really punched up the flavor. It was formed enough to pipe unto cupcakes, but probably not stiff enough to do some serious creative cake decor like flowers etc. I bet that can be remedied with some tweaking here or there.

I didn't see any reduction in grittiness until I combined flour mix with butter mix. The sugar never completely disolved. Followed instructions to the letter. I beat my sugar/butter for 20 min total. Beat flour/milk and butter mixture for 10 min. After all that I ended up adding cream and powdered sugar to make it sweeter.

I made this with a hand mixer.  I mixed for 15 minutes and it was still grainy and I used superfine sugar.  I  switched over to my kitchen aid and it was smooth in about 5 minutes.  Next time I won't use a hand mixer for this recipe.

I tried this tonight after carefully reading reviews.  Thought I wouldn't botch it up but i did somehow.  I got the milk/flour thing down right but the end result was not a good consistency. I don't know if I over beat it at the end. Or the only other problem I think might have been the butter was not 100% rm temp. I did cream the  butter & sugar  for 20-25 min so it wasn't gritty. You can see the butter separating and it looks terrible!  it still tasted ok. Any suggestions where I went wrong?  I do want to try it again.

I have never heard of this recipe called buttercream before. We grew up calling it long john frosting. My mom got it from a baker in Minnesota who used it as his filling in his eclairs and cream puffs, but my mom used it as frosting. The only difference was instead of 4 tablespoons our recipe calls for 8 tablespoons of flour so the mixture is a bit more stiff, and I beat the cooled flour mixture with the electric mixer before I blend the two mixtures. it makes a great substitute to cream cheese frosting on a Red Velvet cake.

I followed directions very carefully, and whipped my sugar/butter for 20+ minutes, and it was totally grainy still. I cooked the flour mixture low for about 20 minutes. went ahead and finished it, and it tasted just like flour. with a hint of sugar. i have made flour frosting before, but that one used the sugar cooked with the flour and it tasted better and texture was better.

I made  this  by  forming a  roux  with  about  four  tablespoons  of  butter  and  added  an  extra  tablespoon  of  flour  because  it  seemed too  wet.  I  added  the  milk  and  it  thickened  up  almost  immediately.  I  let  it  cool,  then  mixed  the  butter  with the  sugar  that I  put  in  the  food  processor to  make  it  finer.  I  didn't  let  the  mixture  cool  enough, so  it  melted  the  butter  and  sugar mixture and I  added  vanilla  extract. I  put  it  in  the  freezer  until  thicker  and  cooled.  I  tasted  it  and  it  tasted  very  custard  like,  which  was  good,  but  not  what I  was  looking  for  in a  frosting. I  was  testing  the  frosting  for  another  cake. I  added a  chocolate  ganache  and  powdered  sugar,  because  it  wasn't  sweet  enough and  it  turned  into a  very  good  frosting.  I  want  to  give  this  recipe another  try. I  think  I'll  try  by  not  forming a  roux.  I'm  very  disappointed  because  I  had  high  hopes  for  this  recipe. Does  anyone  have  advice  on  how I  can  fix  it?  For  now,  I'm  using a  different  buttercream  for  that  cake.

It tastes spectacular, but the texture was disgusting. Had I put the mixture in when it was still warm I think it would have turned out beautifully, but letting it cool to room temp is a HUGE mistake - you end up with a jiggly, solid rubber ball that will NOT blend into the butter/sugar mixture, no matter how long you beat it!

So I'll probably try this again,  tempering it instead of letting it cool. DON'T LEAVE IT TO COOL OFF...unless you like tapioca in your buttercream icing.

TAKE YOUR TIME!!! This is worth the wait. I have spent years looking for a great buttercream recipe, that's not too sweet. Use ultra fine sugar if you can, but this is a dream come true! So delicious, so creamy!  You can't rush perfection...

This frosting never fails to surprise me everytime I make it. This recipe calls for a lot of flour considering this is a frosting we're making here, however it tastes nothing like it! Has anyone ever tried to halve the butter though? I do this because of fear of making the frosting too buttery and I'm thankful for not daring myself into it because I think it tastes 10x better this way. It has a whip cream-like taste to it with a hint of butter, almost like whip cream from a can but with a texture that keeps its hold. I double the recipe and get a great amount of frosting. I'm really happy about discovering this recipe, it's definitely a keeper.

I read the reviews, followed the instructions and it turned smooth and creamy!  I like to cook, but am almost average.... but this recipe is GREAT!  I don't understand why people have problems with this, maybe they rushed it?  It did take some time and effort, but well worth it.

I LOVED this recipe! It does take some "prep-time" but doesn't anything worth eating! I made the recipe as it is listed, granulated sugar and all, and it was not gritty, lumpy or "flour-y"! It isn't always the recipe rather the method of preparation; however, I did not allow the milk and flour to cool to room temperature rather spooned small amounts into the whipping butter and sugar (It looked like a thick, smooth pudding when I mixed the two)! Overall this is a very good recipe. (Be sure to use a good quality butter!) Happy cooking!

I will never EVER use another buttercream frosting recipe again.  Mine came out so light and fluffy.  The flour/milk didn't necessarily make a ball, but it was certainly thick enough to make one...I mean if you really WANT a ball. Anyway, used regular sugar but put it in the food processor to make it a little finer. Used it several times, most recently for an informal wedding cake, and EVERYONE raved about it. Had to email the recipe to something like 25 people. ADDENDUM: Does anyone have any idea how to make this into a chocolate frosting?  I see other buttercream recipes, but none like this with the flour mixture

My Mom has been making this frosting for so long that I actually thought it was a "secret family recipe". Oh well. But the part that does seem to be secret? DO NOT USE POWDERED SUGAR, PEOPLE. And if you don't follow the recipe, and you get a crappy product, that is not the fault of the recipe and a reason to give something a 1-star rating. Made properly this really is the best frosting you'll ever taste. 

My criticisms of this recipe as written: flour + water (milk in this case) = lumps if not handled properly. Ever had lumpy gravy? That's why. Mix the flour and milk VERY WELL and VERY QUICKLY before cooking. I use an immersion blender and mine always comes out great. This mixture doesn't have to form a ball, as some have mentioned, but a thick paste. I let it sit out to cool while I made the other half of the recipe, not in the 'fridge. Either stir while it cools or press plastic wrap against the surface to avoid the "skin".

This is AMAZING! I messed up the first time by not cooking the flour/milk enough, and also melting the butter... bad move... solid butter, and heat the milk/flour till it literally balls up like mashed potato looking consistency. make sure to beat the sugar butter combo allot too it helps. following the instructions for mixing is important on this one for sure!

I have been making this frosting for. . . all my life. . .50 years!!! It was handed down to me from my Mom, who got this when she worked in a little bakery in Chicago during college. The flour is just supposed to thicken, not form a ball. Immediately put the pan in the refrigerator to cool it completely. When cool, add to your butter mixture. It is absolutely the best frosting ever, and anytime I make it, everyone wants the recipe!!! It will become one of your favorites, too!!!

I had high hopes from this recipe based on reviews. Everything came together just fine, although more time consuming and labor intensive than the usual butter-powdered sugar-milk-vanilla icing. We just did not care for this at all. It tastes like room temperature Cool Whip, void of any flavor or sweetness.

This the frosting I grew up with, and I love it because it is not overly sweet. It's pretty easy to alter too. I've been known to use frozen and thawed pureed strawberries instead of milk, and create a yummy strawberry buttercream.

This is a recipe I have used since childhood.  We used to call it "cooked" buttercream frosting versus the confectioners sugar/butter beaten buttercream frosting.  It is light and fluffy, not cloying and sweet like supermarket frostings.  It colors well, and can take on varying flavors like orange, vanilla, almond extract, etc.  The flour-milk roux does not have to ball up (although I have had it do so), it merely needs to thicken and cool before adding to the sugar and butter.  Whole-wheat flour doesn't work well, so forget about trying to be healthier.  In lieu of all butter, my mother used to use half butter, half shortening, and it worked surprisingly well. I have used both confectioners and regular sugar, however,it is important that the regular sugar is creamed with the butter until it is no longer grainy.  You can use Baker's or castor sugar (which is regular sugar ground up to be finer)or grind your regular sugar up a bit in your food processor.  The cake should be at room temperature when served, or the frosting will taste stiff and greasy. Use it all, it is not great leftover for the same reason.

BEST FROSTING EVER!
At first, I was a little wary of this recipe; as I was cooking the milk and the flour, it wasn't thickening. But that is when I realized that the flour had sunk to the bottom and thickened into a paste which stuck to the bottom of the pan. But as I scraped that up, the milk thickened right away. It was disgusting looking and at that point I was 95% positive that I was NOT going to use this recipe. But boy was I wrong! After beating it with the butter and sugar mix it became fluffy and delicious. By far one of my top frosting favorites. It still has a buttercream flavor to it, but it is airy and less dense than traditional butter cream. I found that it worked really well with an almond flavoring. 
Definitively see this one through to the end. The recipe even made enough to generously decorate a three layer cake!

Best Frosting Ever. I'm the type of person who usually scrapes all the frosting off of cakes and cupcakes because I just don't like most frostings. This recipe is the correct sweetness for me. It is more work than other recipes, but so worth it. 

I followed another reviewers advice and made a roux as the first step instead. That basically means I added a little butter to it. It's easy: Melt a little butter - (about the same amount as the flour, or even a little less), slowly add in the flour while you stir with whisk. This will kind of form a ball. Then SLOWLY add in the milk, while stirring constantly. I would describe the final state of the roux as slightly thicker than what you'd expect for a frosting. Then follow the recipe as described. Beating the sugar and butter together will take a good 15 minutes. But that's enough time for the roux to go down to a reasonable temp, so it's all good.

I halved it and still had twice as much frosting as I needed to cover two dozen cupcakes. I threw the rest in the freezer. Not sure if that was a good idea or not. I'll find out later.

I was a little worried after reading the reviews, but I got this recipe my first time making it. All the reviews were really helpful. You have to stir the milk/flour mixture and heat it until it is like a thick paste, and then you have to beat everything on high with a hand mixer for at least ten minutes. I did fifteen and it was as light and creamy as a feather with no chunks (other than what you would usually see in buttercream). Very happy with this recipe, and that it did not need any obscure ingredients, just the basics! :)

I was short on ingredients so i substituted 1 cup of heavy cream for 1 cup of milk and used 2 sticks of margarine instead of butter and it turned out so creamy. I was in a hurry so i added the cream/flour mixture while it was still warm.  It did ball up, i was stiring with a whisk and eventually it started to get thick and adhere to my whisk. when i added everything together i used my hand mixer on the highest setting until the granulated sugar was no longer granulated.this was delicious and the substitutes turned out perfect. This was my first time ever making homemade icing so i have faith that everyone can do it!

It's really good. And really easy though
I made the mistake of not reading all the directions beforehand - I was up very late waiting for everything to cool down. My mistake. 
This is my husbands new favourite - it's not too sweet and healthier than the recipes made with whipping cream.

I wanted to make buttercream without shortening and tried this recipe. It tastes great but the flour-milk mixture became lumpy. I left it too long to cool. Anyone suggest how long to leave it out to room temperature? I'll do it again though and hopefully, becomes better.

It doesn't form a ball like the recipe says, you have to make sure the flour/milk mixture gets really really thick while cooking it on low and make sure you constantly wisk it while it is cooking or you could get lumps. Even as it was cooling I stirred it a bit.  Patience is key.  If you are not patient it will not turn out good.  If you are, this is an amazing frosting.

Patience is the key! It took me a super long time to make this but it was totally worth it. Whip the final product until it isn't grainy, even if it takes 25 minutes. I substituted it for cream cheese frosting on a carrot cake and it was so smooth and delicious that nobody could tell the difference. I go a little heavier on the vanilla flavoring as well.

I have made this frosting so many times I lost count.  It is sincerely the best frosting I have ever had.  The first time I made it we almost did not have enough to frost the cupcakes because my husband and I kept eating it! This frosting is very light, so does not do well for decorating other then simple swirl on a cupcake or a shell along the bottom of a cake.  I tried adding more flour with the milk and it does help make it a little stiffer and easier to use for decorating.

i thought it was really good tasting and not hard at all to follow! about the powdered suger, i read one review that said it was best to use granulated sugar on humid days and white sugar on other days. since i live in Brazil and now is rainy season i wanted to use powdered sugar but i didnt have a whole cup of powdered sugar so i used half and half and it worked out great!!! the flower and butter mixture i didnt have a problem but i didnt wait around for the "ball" so as not to burn the mix but i let it get creamy and thickand let it cool conserdably. my family loved it!!! -tastes great with my familie's now favorite black magic cake!!!

I felt it seemed rather gritty because of the fact that the sugar isn't melted I assume. I'm going to try this recipe with splenda next time. I think it will blend better than granulated sugar, and I'm making it for my uncle who is diabetic (:

This was very time consuming and definitely not near the best I have ever had.  The milk/flour mixture never did "ball" and the end result was a frosting that was gritty, lumpy and sort of bland.  I even added some cream and beat it for about 20 minutes.  Also you have to use food coloring....the natural state is a light tan (probably because of the cooked mixture).  I'll stick with my old standby of butter and powdered sugar, thank you.

I liked the idea of this recipe because confectioners sugar wasn't used.  I substituted the butter and milk with soy alternatives due to food allergies.  I didn't understand the "ball" instruction and it never quite reached that stage...more of a pasty clump.  After waiting an hour for this to set to frosting consistency, it was still a greasy mess and was littered with clumps of flour and tasted awful.  I will not try this recipe again but hope that it works well for others.

This came out smooth enough but the flavor was way too buttery and not very sweet. It was like spreading butter over cookies with a little sprinkle of sugar on top. I will not make it again.

My mom always made this and she made it a bit different.   She uses cornstarch and allows it to thicken but no to the thickness of a ball.  A big key factor is also whipping the butter and sugar for a full 15 min.  It should look like ice cream before it is done.  Of course I make it like mom does.  I LOVE this frosting.

Mix sugar and flour  Mix one third of the flour mixture with milk to start and to get the lumps out. Add the rest of the milk and cook in microwave for ten minutes. While hot put into mixer on high and work out lumps. I used to cover it and place in the refrigerator the night before use. I have made hundreds of wedding cakes with a recipe similar to this. Very happy brides!!

Maybe I did something wrong, but I can't seem to get this frosting to stop running all over the place. To make matters worse, I'm having to pick out the lumps of flour. And, it doesn't taste nearly as good as regular buttercream. I'm hoping I can still salvage my cake.

This was an awesome recipe. I decided to make an anniversary cake for my parents at the last minute before realizing I was out of confectioners (powdered) sugar. Used this recipe, but to speed it up, after cooking the flower/milk portion I left out for 5 minutes to cool, and then put in the refrigerator w/ no cover. Took about 10 minutes to cool and then I put the flower/milk with the sugar and butter in my stand mixer on medium and added the vanilla while it was going. I kept the wisk going for about 15 minutes and to avoid the cooling for 30 minutes step I added about 4 tablespoons of cream cheese and kept whipping for another 5 minutes on high to get a thicker consistency.
Turned out VERY fluffy and light and tastes great. This may be my new stand by especially after how fast it was using the fridge.

I really like this frosting, I've made my fair share of cakes, always looking for a new frosting.  I don't care for most frosting, too sweet and a lot of the time either gritty from sugar or too much shortening taste.  This one just right, but too creamy to decorate with.  I followed suggestion of a reviewer, mixed milk&flour before heating, removed from heat when a little "ball" formed on spoon, it thickened as it cooled.  I also have kitchenaide mixer, so I turned it on and left it.  It whipped up similar to whipped cream.  I don't think hand mixing would achieve desired results, hand mixer might, but would take time.

This is one of my favorite icings second only to SWBC. I can't stand icing sugar so I wanted to find an alternative and could only find two that I loved. I can mix cream cheese, chocolate, apples (for an apple frosting w cinnamon) butter and anything else I want to flavor it with. It's not as fast as icing sugar everyone is use to but it's worth it.

Tried this and it tasted great, no lumps and simply fabulous.  I left it in the refrigerator for about 3 hours and it turned rock hard.  I whipped it again to bring to consistency and it turned watery and lumpy.  I used it on a cake and refrigerated it so I am hoping that it will get a little firmer on the cake.  Again, the flavor is fantastic and I will try using it again in the future.

I've never gotten more compliments on my cupcakes than I have since using this frosting. Added a little more sugar and sometimes add cocoa to make chocolate frosting. it's a huge hit. Thanks!!!

Taste was really good, but I found it a little gritty using white sugar.  Awesome when using powdered sugar, though.

Excellent recipe.  I added the flour one tbsp at time while whisking the milk.  I then stirred the mixture over a hight temperature until it almost become a "ball" l(as referred to by another reviewer).  I also used icing sugar instead of granular sugar.  I only had to beat the mixture for about 3 minutes, before adding the other ingredients.  Super easy, pretty fast and darn delicious.

Unfortunately, I think this recipe has suffered from too many bits of advice because I read all reviews, got a bit nervous (although I have been making frosting for many years), and ended up dissatisfied with the finished product twice.  Then I looked for another recipe, found "white frosting" which is essentially the same (save for 1/2 shortening--1/2 butter) but without all the reviews, followed the short directions and made easy, wonderful, fluffy, perfectly sweet icing.  Not sure if it was the shortening or just stepping away from all the suggestions attached to this recipe.

I should have read the reviews first.  I used sugar instead of powdered sugar and it was very gritty.  Tasted good but did not use on the cake.  I know better then that when making frosting!

This frosting was awful.  I followed the recipe to a tee.  I heated the flour and milk until it was in a ball, stirring coninuously.  I also beat the mixture at the end for a LOOOOOOONG time thinking that it would get lighter and fluffier.  It never did.  The final product looked and tasted like butter, slightly sweetened.  It was heavy and greasy, and not fluffy or spreadable at all.  It was not something that I would ever put on a cake.  It was more like something that you would spread onto a roll (like honey butter).  I ended up throwing the whole batch down the drain and had to go to the store and buy canned frosting.  Very disappointing.

This frosting was delicious!  Unfortunately it was't quite the right consistency for piping/decorating.  It didn't hold shape really well for piping flowers or anything and it was so buttery I couldn't really get the colors to mix evenly in the buttercream.  But the taste was wonderful!  Almost like thick whipped cream.  I had to make two batches to cover my round double layer 9 inch cake.  Next time I would make this for covering the cake and a different recipe for the decorating- but we did lick the bowl!

have made this for years for Red Velvet cak frosting.  When you cook the flour and milk just make sure you cook it until very thick, stirring constantly.  Then let it cool with wrap over the top so no "skin" forms.  Cream the butter and sugar well.  Perfect!!  and I never have to referigerate but I do use heaping tablespoons of the flour.

Best buttercream EVER!  It took me 25 minutes to cooke the flour/milk mixture.  Knowing this I'll do it while my cookies are baking next time instead of after.  My kids were chomping at the bit to eat our sugar cookies, but the frosting wasn't ready yet.

I like how this recipes taste but I noticed its just a little bit greasy.  I used it to pipe some decorations on a cake and I couldnt get the leaves to form right.  No matter what I did it always looked like a butterfly!  I'm thinking I made it a little too thin, how can I make it  thicker?

I have tried this recipe twice now, and I get poor results from it. The flour and milk never form a ball, and after I cool the mixture and try to beat it in with the butter and sugar, it becomes smooth for just enough time for me to turn off the mixture. Then, about a minute later, it looks grainy and weird again, not smooth. I even tried using confectioner's sugar instead, since I though the regular sugar might be the problem.  There are better recipes out there for buttercream frosting; I just wish I could find the one I used before, instead of this one.

I had no problem with the texture or any of the cooking process. The flour thickened and did not burn. I cooled it completely and beat the butter and sugar with a mixer for over 15 minutes before adding the flour mixture. No lumps. It is creamy and easy to make. The problem was the flavor (my husband and I both agreed) It had a burned, metallic taste to it and it was rather bland besides that. It was also too light for me as a prefer a richer and thicker frosting. If you have no frosting or confectioners sugar on hand, I suppose it will do but I will probably try another recipe next time. It might also work for those who don't want anything too sweet.

ok so I just finished my first attempt at this forsting. I must admit I am very impatient and do believe it was probably my faults that created such a disaster. I did cook the flour until it formed a think paste, not quite a "ball" but a nice paste formed. I allowed it to cool a bit, maybe not quite to room temp. I followed the other directions, I thought, to a T. I never was able to beat the flour and sugar until "fluffy" however, it seems after what felt like forever it was still thin. I am refrigerating now in hopes that it will thicken even more. The taste, however, it outstanding and if you ever need buttercream soup, I am your girl!

I did not have a problem making this frosting but I did not like the taste of it when I was done. I was looking for a basic buttercream frosting to go with a yellow cake with raspberry cream filling that I was making and was very disappointed with how this turned out. I could tell that there was flour in the mixture and something was just off. I have tried making it a few more times to see if any of these suggestions made the taste better but I have not found one to work. Personally this frosting was just bland and did not wow me.

I too used this recipe and this turned out more like sweeten condensed milk, so I added a cup of conf sugar, 2 cups of apflour, 1-1/2tsp of baking powder, pinch of salt, another tsp vanilla, and the butter cream cake is excellent. I used a bundt pan and baked at 350 for 45-55 mins.

Started out ok - I have never cooked flour / milk for an icing recipe. The color of the frosting was sort of translucent, which looked weird. After combining everything, it still didn't look or taste right. I added another stick of butter and powdered sugar to taste and consistency. Turned out fabulous after adding my own ideas to it. I will research icings a little more before doing this one again. I do bake a lot, so I am not fully sold on this recipe!

Pretty good- after tinkering around with it. As it is, it's a very easy and nice recipe, although a bit bland and not very sweet. I added two cups of powdered sugar and about 1/4 cup of cocoa powder to make a chocolate frosting. With those adjustments, it was perfect! Dreamy and smooth. I most likely just have a big sweet tooth, but if I make it again without the cocoa powder, I'll probably end up making it a bit sweeter.

To be honest I'm very upset right now. I follwed the recipe to the T and I ended up with a bowl full of butter and chunks. I couldn't even make it into a frosting. IT WAS LIKE WATER! Not trying this one again.

I hate giving things a poor rating in case it is just me doing something wrong. I cant imagine with this simple recipe what I could have done wrong. It just was NOT good. I would not call it "BEST" buttercream frosting. I used this recipe only because I was out of powdered sugar and this was the only one I could find that used regular sugar. Maybe that is what made it bad?

I liked this recipe because it didn't use tons of powdered sugar.  Followed the recipe exactly, and the consistency came out quite nice.  The frosting wasn't too sweet which is just how I like it, but it is very, very buttery.

Very good, and not difficult.  Time consuming, yes, but much better than the powdered sugar and butter with a couple tablespoons of milk recipe.  Smoother, not too sweet.

Great recipe.  I've been avoiding buttercream recipes that required cooking, but it wasn't as daunting as I thought.  I followed the other recommendations  and whisked the flour and milk together first.  It thickened up pretty quickly (It did eventually form a clump like ball as it cooled).  And I used white sugar and did whip it for 20 minutes! to get rid of the gritty feel.  Once I added the flour mixture it all smoothed right out.  It was great.

This turned out great! I substituted powdered sugar because anytime I cream regular sugar into butter its grainy. The milk and flour mixture needs to be whisked constantly and it comes together very fast so don't walk away! No ball is formed. It just gets thick. Vigorous whisking takes care of the lumps.

I thought it was great.  The taste was nice and it was fluffy.  It did have some grit but for me it didn't matter much because I was using it under fondant.  If I try to use it as a stand-alone frosting I may try a super fine sugar or even powdered.

I used granulated sugar as instructed and beat it for 28 hours but it remained gritty, even after adding the flour mixture. I had to throw it away. I give 2 stars because it would probably work with powdered sugar.

This was a fantastic recipe! I followed the directions and got a smooth, rich, not too sweet frosting. The only thing I changed was that I took the milk and flour mixture off the stove once it reached the consistency of pudding (you'll know when to take it off the heat when you're making it--trust me!)

The frosting tasted good but I ended up with little clear/yellowish globs.  It looked ok when it was first done but my cake needed to cool so I put the frosting in the refrigerator.  It got really hard and when I stirred it up to make it a good consistancy to frost the cake, it appeared curdled and yellowish.  After awhile it began to separate and look really gross.  I will not use this recipe again.

I love this recipe. It is simple and delicious. I did what one of the reviewers suggested and made a roux than added milk. When it was thick, I let it chill. When it got to room temperature, it looked like a ball when I would stir it.  I also used 1/4 cup brown sugar (to go with my caramel cake) in addition to the white sugar. I love this recipe!!!

I made this frosting for the second time in just a couple of days.  The first time I used it, I didn't have all-purpose flour on hand so I used self-rising four.  The flavor was okay but the texture was pasty and had tiny globules in it.  I was convinced it was the flour I used so I tried it again.  Although the texture was better, it still had tiny globules in it.  I can't understand how fellow posters have gotten a perfect result, even on the first try!  I'm also confused by the fact that the recipe doesn't tell you at what temp to cook the flour & milk.  I tried both a medium and high heat and got the same results.  I stirred until there was almost a ball, and let it get to room temp before mixing it with the sugar/butter.  As vague as the intructions were, I followed them implicitly.  I'm left baffled.

My friends mom had this recipe and I have finally found it.  There is no reason to use any other recipe if you are making home made.  Don't let the milk and flour thing scare you.  I sifted the flour, wisked it into cold milk, then cooked over 6 heat stirring constatly for about 4 minutes.  Take off heat and stir if it starts getting lumpy.  Just get it thick.
I also took the advise of on of the gals from Wisconsin and beat the sugar, butter, vanilla with the paddle from Kitchen Aid mixer for 5 minutes, then mixed all on high (after flour mix was room temp) and beat with wire wisk for 15 minutes.  It was a teeny grainy after 15 so I did for 2 more minutes.  Night and day difference from that last 2 minutes.  I also took about a half cup of the frosting in a cup and lightly frosted the cake before putting frosting in the fridge to keep the crumbs our of the final frosting.

I really enjoyed the recipe.  First attempt, and I want to thank the recommendation of first making the roux and the suggestion of blending the mixture for upwards of 15 - 20 minutes.
I rate it a 4 because this was my first exposure to buttercream and don't want to disappoint any experts.

This recipe has been in my family for years.  My mom received it from a lady friend of hers who received it from her mother.  It's the most delicious tasting frosting.  But you must beat it on high for 4 to 5 mins.  I sometimes add drained crushed pineapple to this frosting to add a little different taste to it.  It's great!!!!

I had to do this recipe twice so I can understand why some people had a hard time. To avoid the lumpiness, use a whisk to mix the flour and milk. It did come out a bit grainy but next time I will try to beat it a little more. It has a light and fluffy texture. This recipe made more than enough for a two layer 9 inch cake. Will definitely try again!

This recipe was super easy, I don't know why so many gave it a bad review.  I'm a novice and did it all by hand and it came out creamy and smooth.  The flavor is a little more buttery than I expected, but it tastes great on my lemon cupcakes.

I, too, had trouble liking this receipe. To me the taste of flour over rode the buttercream flavor. Could be that I over cooked the milk and flour mixture looking for that "ball"? I think next time I may just try blending the 2 until it becomes a 'thick' texture and let it cool to become the "ball" that the receipe calls for. I just can't see it returning a positive result with the use of flour.

The taste of this recipe is great. However I followed it exactly and it did not come out smooth and fluffy. It was more like small clumps. Everything was at room temperature so I don't know what I did not do but I know it did not turn out as expected.

Disregarding my unease about the granulated sugar, I followed this recipe exactly.  It's actually quite simple, though labor intensive as-is.  The milk and flour mixture was very easy -- slowly whisk the milk into the flour, and watch it closely as you heat it.  When bubbles start to form around the edges of the pot, watch it closely and don't stop stirring!  When it looks like you're stirring library paste, remove from heat and cool (when completely cooled, my mixture actually did sort of "ball up" as I stirred it).  I beat the butter and sugar until I thought my arm was going to fall off (approx. 20 minutes), and the mixture was still gritty when I added the milk/flour.  The result was incredibly rich and thick yet not too sweet, but there was still the tiniest bit of crystallized sugar remaining. For me that was maddening!  LOL 

I will definitely use this recipe again, but NOT with granulated sugar.

I will never go back to plain ol' frosting after using this recipe!  I have made it many times, and I did have ONE instance where it didn't turn out perfectly.  As another poster said, this was because I let the flour mix cool down too much.  I haven't had the problem again.

Having never made a frosting like this before i took the directions litteraly. The flour and milk doesn't make a "ball". I cooked the flour and milk for 20 minutes, Stiring the whole time and all I got was a Glutonous Mess! when i added it to the Butter and sugar I again Followed directions and beat it for 20 minutes and still got little lumps of flour in the frosting... not only that it didn;t have any taste. Maybe you just need the knack it takes to make this... but i really don;t see how the ratio of 1cup butter and 1 cup sugar can taste nice. I'd try this before you make it for something special so you don;t waste an hour of your time or a decent cake. 
Oh! I made another buttercream frosting... it took me less the 4 minutes and it turned out great and I had 24 cupcakes decorated and done by the time it took to make this "frosting"

Excellent texture and taste.  Success seems to be dependent on heating the milk and flour to the right thickness and cooling to the right temperature and slowly adding to the butter and sugar and mixing at high speed for 15-20 minutes.  I whisked the flour and 1% milk before heating using the microwave techinque another reviewer suggested.  I used half butter and half Blue Bonnet margarine.  Margarines vary a great deal with the % of vegetable oil.  If you are making the frosting and the kitchen is hot or humid that can affect negatively affect the thickness of the frosting.  Finally pure vanilla extracts have a better taste than the cheaper imitiation extracts. These factors may have contributed to the unsuccessful outcomes resulting in low star ratings.

Wow, this was sweet!  I can't believe some reviewers said it wasn't overly sweet.  This is the sweetest frosting I've ever had.  The method worked perfectly.  The milk thickened up, and the butter mixture wasn't grainy.  I let it mix in the stand mixer for about 15 minutes, and it was very creamy.  However, it didn't really spread nicely.  It kind of separated on the cake.

This was very easy to make and was delicious!  I substituted 1/2C Brummel and Brown Spread for half of the butter and I used the Splenda/Sugar baking mix, it was not calorie free but better than nothing.
I will definately use this again.

I don't know that I would taste this and say it's buttercream, but it is a very smooth frosting and the taste is very good.  It's kind of fun to make as well, watching the milk mixture get thick so quickly.

This was the best recipe for buttercream I have tried. It was not too sweet and was very easy to make. I read the other reviews and I was a little afraid to try this, but it turned out excellent!

If I didn't have a stand up mixer it would have killed my arm. However it was a wonderful frosting, my husband loved it!! :-)

This was perfect- My sister and I were looking for my mom's recipe and couldn't find it.  This is almost exact.

I thought this frosting was great- but I love the rich buttercream frosting from the bakery. Thanks to the other posters for their suggestions. I also cooked the milk/flour mixture on low, and stirred it with a whisk the whole time. I took it off the burner when it was barely thickened and let it cool completely while I mixed the butter and sugar. I added the milk/flour mixture a small amount at a time, and beat thoroughly after each addition. The total beating time came out to about 20 minutes. No lumps, no grit.

I did not care for this recipe. I hate to give a bad review, but this was the first thing I've ever made that I couldn't "fix." First, it took forever to cook the flour and milk into a goopy ball shape. Then, once it was cooled and mixed with the butter, it turned in to lumps and gave off an odor which reminded me of spoiled baby formula. I was looking for a recipe that doesn't have confectioners sugar and I guess I'll just have to keep looking.

This recipe sounded great, but turned out terrible. The frosting was lumpy, and when it is warmed to room temp, it gets runny and greasy. I followed the directions to a tee, but it still turned out bad.

It tasted alright, but I don't think I would use it again.  It had a horrible consistency -  it was still lumpy, even after using a high-powered electric mixer.
