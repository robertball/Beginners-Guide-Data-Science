I used my own homemade dry ranch dressing in this dip recipe and reduced fat sour cream. I did add a touch of Frank's Hot Sauce for a little kick. I wanted a more uniform dip. What I did was throw all the ingredients into my food processor and pulse until smooth. THEN, I chilled the dip for an hour before serving. I loved the combination of all the ingredients together but you know, I really think this dip could use some parmesan cheese. Not much, just a touch to give it a little bit of that flavor.

I first tried this recipe back in September 2012 for a Sunday dinner party and it was a big success. I have made it a couple more times since then for get togethers and myself. I do add a small amount of some strong, pungent flavored cheeses when I make it for myself because that is how I like it. The down side is I don't know the starting calorie count before I add the extra cheeses and I tend to eat more of this dip then I should. Yes it is that good.

2 disclaimers - I am not a huge fan of spinach dip and I can't stand mayo. But spinach dip is always a crowd pleaser so I hold my nose and make it. So, when I saw this receipe and realized it did not involve mayo, I had to try it and I am glad I did!! My grocery store was out of sourdough rounds so I served it in a bowl with cubed sourdough bread. It was a huge hit!! The bowl looked like it had been licked clean. This one is a keeper!!

This is delicious! I read all of the reviews about it being too salty and was only going to use 1/2 of the ranch dressing package but as I kept tasting  ;) I ended up using the whole thing and it was perfect as written! Thank you

I normally use home made ranch seasoning, but was short on time so bought the packet.  It was saltier than desired as a result, but still tasted great and I would make again with my home made version ranch.  I served with french bread and baby carrots.

Omitted water chesnuts and french bread for a very Keto/low carb option friendly. I paired it with plain pork skins and also celery sticks for delicious snacks.

I love Hidden Valley Ranch dip made from the packet, but I think the flavor is too over-powering for this recipe.

I have been making this recipe for years and it is always a big hit.  We entertain for several holidays throughout the year and this is a constant on our appetizer menu.  I serve in a bowl with a tray of thin-sliced French bread, as well as a tray containing a variety of crackers.

I have been using this recipe for years. It is often requested.
I replace the water chestnuts with artichoke hearts.
