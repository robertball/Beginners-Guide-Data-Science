I took this recipe to a potluck and everyone kept raving about how amazing it was. My friend who is a food critic and restaurant owner went on and on about delicious it was. I did add/change a few things. I added some bacon under the onions as well as on top, on the advice of another reviewer. I also added some more cheddar and asiago cheese on top under the crackers and shaved Parmesan cheese. Also the group I was taking the dish to are all big fans of garlic so I minced up a garlic clove and sautéed for a minute in the butter before I added the flour. All the flavors blended perfectly! This will be my go to potluck dish from now on!

DELICIOUS!  I followed the recipe to a "T", other than 1/2ing it and making it in an 8" square pan (I also forgot to add the parsley and used 2% milk...ok, but I was CLOSE to recipe ;) ).  This is rich and delightful.  While I won't make it often because it's so calorie laden, it was delicious.  I wasn't sure about the onions, but they really made it (be sure to use sweet onions).  I think this sauce would also make an excellent white sauce for mac and cheese!  THANKS for the recipe!

OMG! This is now my go to recipe for au-gratin potatoes.  Made this with Easter dinner and everyone's raving about how good they were.  My brother even asked for the recipe and he's a wonderful chef.  I highly recommend this recipe and would have given it ten stars if I could.

I used 2 cups of heavy cream instead of one. 1 1/4 cups making sauce 3/4 cups poured on before baking. I also mixed asiago, parmesan and chedder cheese with ritz crackers for topping. I did not cook potatoes first. I cooked for 1 hour on 375

EXCELLENT!!! I made two batches; one for our Thanksgiving dinner and one for our Church bakesale! They were a definite hit, which I will be making again.  The only difference I made with the second batch was to simply put the potatoes and sauce in a bowl together to get all the potatoes covered and then put everything into the baking pan. I did think there was more sauce than potatoes, but nobody complained!!!

Theses were really good potatoes. I really enjoyed the blend of cheeses. Cooking the potatoes before was a bit of a pain. Wondering if I can skip this step and just cook them longer. (Or maybe microwave them to soften them a little).

This was a big hit at my office Christmas party.  I just added fried and chopped maple bacon under the onion layer.  Delicious!  Thank you!
I baked the night before, and then cut up in squares, and put in crock pot to cook on low till lunch at work.  Perfect.

YUMMYx1000!! I added a few extra Ritz crackers for the topping. More crunch is always a good thing. Don't over crush the crackers.

Looking for the best recipe  was hard, so many to choose from, but I am very pleased with this one.
I made my first dish Christmas 2015 and it was a big hit with my entire family. It will now be a big part of our traditional Christmas dinner. But the second time I did it was even better ! (What confidence can do), I sautéed the sliced onions, added more cream and  bacon topping.This recipe will sure be handed down to my children and families.

Delicious! I used red onion for sweet onions, Lucerne Fat-Free Half & Half for the milk and cream and a parmesan/romano/asiago mix for the parmesan and romano. I also added minced garlic and peas to the layer between the potatoes.

Two thumbs up from all. I love this recipe. I don't think there is any way to mess it up, unless you put something like chocolate or other obscure item. I had to use up my heavy whipping cream so I added a little bit more than the recipe called for and adjusted with milk for the right consistency. I used the 4 cheese mexican variety and it gave it good color. I didn't have any butter crackers, so I just used panko for the top instead and watched for the right color in the final bake.

Very easy to make with great results.  The creamy sauce is perfect.  Guests gushed with compliments.  I used crushed potato chips for topping.  Very definitely will make again.

Very good! I skipped the crackers on top as they are not our taste but made it verbatim. Was exceptionally good, nice creamy cheese sauce really was a hit. Will make again and planning on making it for the church potluck!

I'm not sure if I'm just super slow but this dish took me an hour and 10 minutes not 25 as stated. That being said I don't care how look it takes it's absolutely delicious and everyone loves it and always asks for recipe. Didn't charge a thing except I split it between two 11x7" pans cause I parbake one to freeze. Works out great.

This was a big hit for Christmas dinner!  To adequately cover a 9x13 dish, I used twice the amount of crushed crackers.  I also added little sour cream  (1/2 cup).

Wonderful dish! Cheese sauce is delicious and I would love to use it on veggies or Mac and cheese! I opted to lightly sautée the onions to ensure they were tender. Other than that followed recipe exactly. It needed longer cooking time but think it was due to me not cooking potatoes long enough. Highly recommend this recipe!

This was so salty I could hardly eat it.  The asiago cheese I guess was already salty and then you add the other cheese and the crackers it was too much.  Also I did not use the parmesan cheese, I would have had to throw it out.  It said not to peel the potatoes, and the peelings fell off while cooking and they were a little stringy.  If I made this again, I would change a lot of things.

Delicious and simple. I loved it. It took a lil longer to cook than I thought, so I recommend you start this dish before your other side dishes if you have any.

Great recipe but the potatoes were overdone when I cooked them for 15 minutes so keep an eye on that.

Very good. I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it. It also easier then I thought it would be. I used an Italian blend cheese instead of asiago and added cooked bacon to the sweet onions.

Grrrreat recipe!  Thanks for sharing. I too, put caramelized onions in the middle and used Feta instead of Asiago because thats all we had for the third cheese. The house smelled fantastic as it cooked.

Great recipe.  My family all loved it.   The only thing I did differently was to carmelize the onions a bit first.    I recommend it!

Loved this recipe! I've had scalloped/au gratin failures before because the potatoes were still hard, but this recipe is flawless! I changed only two things: threw in some garlic powder and sautéed the sweet onion. Otherwise, it's perfect the way it is. RAVE reviews at thanksgiving!

Very tasty and rich. I thinned it out with an additional 1/4 cup of milk, and added some vegetables to make it into a main dish. Add a bit of bread and it's dinner.
