This Tequila Shrimp was very yummy!! I have been making it for about 6 months now and have made just a few changes. I melt the butter at the lowest heat setting then once melted I sift about 1/2tsp to 1tsp cornstarch to the butter and stir untill most of the cornstarch is blended with the butter (to make a rue).  Another thing I have done is added 1/4 tsp Cheyenne pepper to the mixture along with the salt and chili pepper.those were the only changes I made to it and its GREAT!! My Hubby is a picky eater and he gave me the 2 thumbs up and even asks me to make it for dinner.  I have also let my God son try it and he LOVES it and always asks for 2nd's (which is rare!!).  I hope my comment helps anyone out there wanting to try it or who has already tried it but wanted to try something a little different.

Fabulous flavor! The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because the sauce did not evaporate & could have been a little thicker. Next time, I will add a little cornstarch to it. The was perfectly complemented with Panamanian rice & beans and leftovers served as a delicious shrimp omlet the following morning. Yum!

This was just GREAT. Granted, I almost doubled the garlic and lime juice, and added a little salt and cumin, I pretty much stuck to the recipe.   I served it with brown rice, black beans with salsa and lime tortilla chips. Awesome recipe!

I would give this 6 stars if I could. My sauce and shrimp was a bit more "orange-ish" in color - the chili powder.  I never knew so few ingredients wound taste to unbelievable. I skipped the cilantro. Served with rice and fresh tomatos and avocado. So far, this was best result I've had from any recipe I've ever tried from this website, and I've had some good results. Restaurant quality for sure.

Easy to prepare and very, very tastey.  Didn't have any chili powder so used red pepper flakes instead which gave it a nice kick.  Best to use a clear tequila.

Found it a bit weak in flavour so added some dried red pepper chilies and then removed shrimp as soon as they were cooked and kept them warm while I reduced the liquid and used it over the top. Set shrimp on top of lime cilantro rice that had been put in a mold ring.

I expected a bit more zip, I'll do this again but might use fresh chili instead of powder. I served it over egg noodles, all in all it was a tasty dish and easy to prepare.

This literally could not be easier or more delicious. I took a few cues from other reviewers and mixed a tablespoon of cornstarch in with the butter as I melted it at a low temperature and the sauce was a perfect consistency. I also served it over couscous (I had no rice) with sliced avocado. I'm not a big tequila drinker so I purchased a very small bottle of Patron Silver for $6.00 just to make this and it was well worth it. I also must admit I had a little shot as a was cooking, which should be mandatory, as it added to the whole experience. My husband and I were both in love with this shrimp and it will most certainly become part of my dinner repertoire.

This is a great summer recipe- very light. I tossed cilantro in the sauce at the end ( I love cilantro! ) and let it blend in, and served it over rice. I also double the sauce to have lots for the rice to soak up.

pretty good. The type of tequila that's used probably determines the taste. Do not waste your time or $ on the cilantro because you don't actually eat it. I thought it went into the dish and it was just a garnish, I don't need garnish at my house because the meal speaks for itself. The lime could have been eliminated as well. My boyfriend rated it at a 4, then i told him to have some lime with it, he did then he then rated it a 3. I did however make the cilantro lime rice to serve the shrimp on, from this website. I made the 2nd recipe that comes up in the search results--bad idea if you do not like cilantro.

Five stars are NOT enough for this recipe.  It is SO amazing.  So easy to make and sooooo yummy.  My boyfriend and I ended up making it two nights in a row the first time we made it because of how much we loved it.

This was very bland.  Could have benefited from more herbs, such as garlic and cilantro, and citrus juices.

This is an absolute winner.  One of my guests joked that he wanted to lick the bowl!  Instead of reducing the sauce (and letting the shrimp get cold) I quickly whisked some Wondra flour into the drippings.  Delicious.

Super easy to make and came out tasty.  I used scallops and shrimp and added a bit more tequila (I didn't want the sauce to evaporate) and served it over rice.

This was very good.  I did have to add a little bit of cornstarch because my sauce did not thicken.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Delicious!  This has become a staple in my household.  I serve it with rice, black beans, sauteed peppers and onion (fajita style) and a half an avocado per person.  It's a simple meal to prepare and it's one of my boyfriend's favorite dishes.  Thank you so much for sharing this one!

This was fabulous.  Really great flavor & not your typical lemon garlic shrimp type dish.  We really love it & have added it to the rotation.

Please, DON'T SIMMER UNTIL LIQUID EVAPORATES! With that much butter and almost half a cup of liquid from the tequila and lime juice, plus the shrimp's liquid, your medium shrimp will be very overcooked. Aside from cooking just until the shrimp were done, I followed this recipe almost exactly and we really enjoyed the dish. I did use chipotle powder instead of chili powder and added the chopped cilantro with the pepper to cook down a little. Thanks for sharing.

Oh, YUM!  Super easy recipe, and very flavorful!  I doubled the ingredients so there'd be extra sauce.  The cilantro really added a nice flavor.  It was delicious - even my picky husband raved about it.

Maybe I did something wrong but I didn't care for this recipe at all.  I think 6 minutes total is too long to cook shrimp for, and I think 6 minutes isn't enough time to infuse the shrimp with any of the lime tequila flavor.  Maybe if I marinated the shrimp beforehand in the tequila, lime, garlic and chili powder and then cooked it quickly in the butter it would work better.  The way the recipe was written, I feel like while the aroma was amazing, the shrimp was overcooked and had no flavor.

Yum!  Perfect for a very quick dinner during the week!  We live on the Texas Gulf Coast and always have tons of shrimp on hand. This recipe was a great way to use some of it up.  I especially like how easy this recipe is to tweak and it still comes out delicious.

Wife wanted shrimp for dinner so i used the recipe here to make them. Unfortunately our county is dry on sunday so i couldnt get tequilla but used everythung else as is written. I added it to fettuccine noodles and used a garlic butter sauce for the noodles. She thought it was awesome so Ive got that going for me.

I have made this twice and my bf and I both loved it both times. I did only make 1lb of shrimp. I reduced the tequila to 3 tbsp but kept the lime juice at 3 tbsp.  so good the first time my bf got the ingredients out and asked me to make it.

I was expecting this recipe to be spicier. I think I'll add some red pepper flakes if I make it again, but I made the recipe for friends who do no prefer spicy food, and they said it was a hit!

Loved this recipe!  I have a bag of pre-cooked, frozen shrimp that I used for this recipe.  I just thawed out 1 serving of shrimp and scaled the recipe down for one serving.  It was absolutely delicious!  Quick and easy, too (I think I was done in 6 minutes)!

I did this recipe following 8 servings to a 'T' and the tequila was to strong for my taste. It might have been the type I used. I was just okay. Maybe next time I'll either use a different tequila or just less of it. I didn't add to much butter because the shrimp sweat out water therefore I had enough juice to pour over my rice.

This was awesome!  The only reason I'm giving it a 4 is because the sauce didn't evaporate and we thought it was a little too garlicky.  Next time I'll add some cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it and cut the garlic in half.  Made it with the cilantro-lime rice from this site and there were no leftovers!

This was  amazing.  I followed the suggestion of others and added corn starch but otherwise followed the recipe to a tee.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I'll add a little more spice but otherwise, this was wonderful.  Served this with Mexican Rice III also from this site. We chopped up the leftovers and had shrimp tacos the next night.  Double yummy!

This is an awesome recipe for putting in a shrimp Taco. I have also made it for  chicken tacos using cut up chicken breasts.  I add  southwestern salad mix in the wrap with their dressing and some garlic butter rice on the side. It's is spot on for a wonderful taste with flour or corn tortilla's. Thanks for this forever!

These were wonderful. We used the shrimp to make tostadas and even with all the extra ingredients you could still taste the shrimp and butter and tequila. They were very satisfying.

Hubby and I love this recipe.  I make it with a lime jalapeno cilantro rice and fresh corn, cut from cob and sauteed in butter and sprinkled with chili powder.
If I have some crusty bread to serve with this, I make more of the sauce and don't let it completely cook down, so we can dip the bread.  Sooo good!

this was so delicious.. i didn't follow the directions and used this more as a marinade/cooking liquid.. left out the butter.. put everything in a zip lock bag and marinated for about 30 min's.. used mahi mahi fillets, doubled the chili powder, and subbed bottled lemon juice for the lime.. poured everything into a pan and cooked until done.. used the leftover juice to pour over rice.. ty so much for the recipe

After I messed with this, it is definatly a 5.  I made as listed, but the liquid wasnt evaporating and was very watery and didn't have much taste (I'm assuming the shrimp was really watery??)  Anyway, I dumped out half of my liquid and then readded in the tequila and lime juice (1/2 recipe amounts) and dumped in more chile powder and garlic salt to taste.  Taste was great, but still thought it was too thin, so I sprinkled some flour over the shrimp and stirred in.  The shrimp and thickened sauce could go inside wraps.
