My sister-in-law is from Taiwan.  She taught me to fix mushrooms like this except I saute 1 thinly sliced onion and 1/2 tsp. garlic salt with the mushrooms.

So wonderful. Be sure to add the salt at the end, otherwise it draws out the mushrooms' moisture too quickly and the texture isn't as pleasant.

This is great! I would definitely add a tablespoon of chopped garlic in the melted butter for additional flavor. I also sometimes add a splash of white wine and/or some parsley, which is also a great flavor with sauteed mushrooms.

This goes great on top of grilled steaks or hamburgers. Season to taste (1/2 tsp might be too much depending on the seasoning blend you're using!) but don't sprinkle the salt on until the mushroom liquid has evaporated and they've gotten back to sizzling. Definitely cook long enough and at high enough temperature so that the mushrooms get golden brown and the liquid from them evaporates (flabby, unbrowned mushrooms are not as flavorful!).

ABSOLUTELY Fantastic! Easy to make & delish! hubby scraped every last scrap from the boul & my daughter asked if we can make it everynight till she's tired of it!:=) I added a dash of cajun seasoning for that kick! I was great! I'll be making it again.

Great on steaks!  I added a drizzle of olive oil to the butter, one clove of garlic about half-way through and finished with a splash of white wine.  Delicious and I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again!

This is how I always prepare mushrooms and they taste wonderful!  You can do so many things with these mushrooms, sometimes I add sour cream and make a stroganoff type sauce.  You can also add them to alfredo, or top burgers with them. For Thanksgiving toss the sauteed mushrooms with stuffing. Mmmmm!

This is delicious and so easy.  There are times when I will add some garlic to this and maybe a splash of wine, but usually the simpler the better.  Thanks for the post.

Wonderful simple side dish.  Most of the time I will omit the butter for a lighter side dish.  Also, I have sauteed garlic and onion with the mushrooms and put this mixture on top of toasted italian bread sprinkled with a little bit of mozzarella cheese.  Makes a great lunch.

This really is a great go-to recipe! I sometimes add some Half and Half towards the end to give it a creamy texture and taste. Always turns out great and is an awesome recipe for those extra mushrooms!

Yum! I love these! So easy, I finally got these right thanks to reading the reviews about how to cook them and when to add the salt.  I think I could use less salt and more butter and they would be fine.  I did add garlic (1 clove) and would like to try it w/sauteed onions, too.

side dish was ok. I rated it a 3 stars as recipe was written. With my additions I rated it a 4 stars because I added little black pepper, a little salt to taste, a little garlic, a couple dashes of whorchestershire sauce and some fresh chopped flat leaf parsely. I think it would have tasted even better if I used a splash of white wine with a squeeze of lemon juice in place of the whorchestershire sauce. Nonetheless, I think the mushrooms needed a little something besides just butter and salt so I made the adjustments above to suit my tastes.

These were pretty good.... I didn't have any wine which is what I usually use for mushrooms... glad to see all I need is a little butter...

PS. I used chives as well...

Perfect compliment to a steak.  Very easy to make and the only changeI made was to add one chopped clove of garlic half way through cooking.  I also waited a bit to add the salt as others suggested.  Thanks!

We topped our eggs with these this morning and they were fantastic as is.  I am sure cooking them with onions and Worcestershire sauce would be great too for dinner dishes.  These mushrooms can add a certain elegance to whatever you're making and the simplicity helps so much.

This recipe would be good, if you remember a couple of things in cooking with mushrooms.  Fresh mushrooms should be cooked at more than a medium heat or else they just steam.  As for the seasoned salt, mushrooms should only be lightly seasoned AT THE END of cooking after the juices have evaporated.  Adding just a dash of nutmeg can make this an outstanding dish.

Simple and easy, love it!  Good flavor too.  I put them on burgers and they were delicious.  I used garlic powder, pepper, and added a touch of chopped onion leftover from the burgers.  Took another reviewer's advice and added the salt just after the moisture had evaporated.  Yum!

Great basic recipe for fresh mushrooms. The recipe doesn't specify the type of season salt, so I used a garlic and basil season salt that I had. It was terrific.

Great recipe but we found it way too salty. Next time, I will reduce the salt by half and add 1 teaspoon of crushed garlic. That should make it amazing!

Holy moley were these salty!! To try to save these mushrooms I added a tablespoon of white wine and few shakes of dried parsley. They were still salty, but not nearly as bad as before. If you make this I HIGHLY recommend cutting back on the seasoned salt. If you try it as it is and you taste it while cooking and it's too salty, add the white wine. It'll help.

great recipe, like others i sauteed onions and garlic, put them on the side, sauteed mushrooms only cut in half, not sliced. Then combined everything with a dash of salt in the final minute of cooking.

Much better if you sautee thinly sliced onion and chopped garlic before adding the mushrooms - and yes, salt at the end not during the sauteeing.

I use whole mushrooms and trim the stems off.  You must cook them long enough for all the liquid too cook off, about 10 to 15 minutes on medium heat; turn them frequently.  They will shink in size and their flavor intensifies as the liquid cooks off!  I don't add any salt, just the muchrooms cooked in butter.  I could cook up 2 or 3 pounds of these and make it a meal for myself, except that my husband would fight me for them.  My kids don't care for mushrooms, but that's OK because that means there's more for me and hubby to enjoy!!!  Adding some minced garlic at the end so it won't burn and some fresh minced parsley sounds like it would take these mushrooms over the top!

These are great! I have been making mushrooms this way for years. 9 times out of 10, this is how I prepare them. I always add just regular salt and pepper, garlic powder and parsley. The butter gives these such a wonderful flavor. They go great with just about anything! :)

Doubled the recipe and added a splash or two of Worchestershire sauce. Simple and easy, nothing fancy. Served with a meatloaf and steamed broccoli. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious and simple.  Added about 1 teaspoon minced garlic to the butter and followed other's advice to add salt towards the end.  Very easy and a great side to grilled steak.

I absolutely cannot have a steak w/o these mushrooms, however, with the addition of steak sauce added at the end of cook time and heated through, these mushrooms are rated out of this world!

I learned to cook mushrooms this way in home ec..years ago and showed my mother to make this way.  I use this as my quickie recipe for mushrooms although I use either olive oil and butter buds or smart balance spread instead of butter.   I also make a version where I add chopped fresh rosemary to taste (or dried italian seasoning), red wine and black pepper.  Either way is quick and easy and tastes wonderful.

This is a great basic recipe and if you are not used to cooking your mushrooms I suggest you start with this recipe and make no adjustments and see what you think.  I often do like to add/subtract when following recipes on this site but it cracks me up when I see a simple recipe such as "Last Minute Mushrooms" and people are "reviewing" it stating they 'added broccoli' or 'stirred in cheese and/or mustard' or 'throw in some wine'!  People - I love reading the reviews and use the comments to choose what to prepare but sometimes it does get a bit funny!  Hey, nothing wrong with that?

I used a 16oz container of mushrooms. I added 2 cloves of garlic, half of a small onion, and all together about 3 tablespoons of salted butter. I minced the garlic and sautéd it for about 5 min then added the onion. Once the onion was soft I added the mushrooms and cooked them until soft. They turned out great  :3 hope this helps

Love this recipe! I use it to top a grilled T-bone steak. Even as a side dish this is so good.

My husband can be very fussy, and not a big veggie eater. He said "definitely make those again". Simple, easy & delicious! I cooked them with a lid, made its own sauce.

This was my first time cooking mushrooms and it was very good with a few additions. I gave it a 4 with recipe as is and a 5 with the additions I added from a few comments. I added a little olive oil to the butter. Half way through cooking I added a garlic clove, a splash of worcestershire sauce, a splash of white cooking wine. As someone said added the seasoning salt to soon will dry the mushrooms out so I added the seasoning salt right before it finished cooking. I also took someones advice and made sure the mushroom got browned. Actually some of mine were a little black in some spots, but this was delicious.  I will definitely make this again. Very simple and quick even with the additions.

I enjoyed this recipe for mushrooms.  It was quick and simple.  The only changes I made was to use regular salt instead of seasoned salt and I added a splash of worcestershire sauce and a sprinkle of pepper.  They were delicious!

Simple, delicious and a wonderful side to steak.   I didn't even use seasoned salt, just kosher salt and fresh ground black peppper.  Minimal ingredients let the delicate taste of the mushrooms shine through.

This was okay, but it was WAY too salty for my tastes. I'd cut the seasoned salt down quite a bit. It was a very quick and easy side dish, though. Thanks :)

My husband surprisingly loved these mushrooms. He likes Italian food and said that next time he would put more Parmesan cheese afterwards and less salt on it. (I didn't measure the salt as directed -- so that is my fault). Overall, we loved this recipe and will use again! Thank you for sharing!

Better than other mushroom saute recipes, and so much easier.  Thanks, Carrie, for reminding me of the way I used to prepare mushrooms!  Like others, I sometimes add garlic and parsley, but the recipe is excellent just as written.

With a little more time, there is so much you can do with mushrooms, but these are simple, quick, and tasty.  I doubled the recipe and my husband and I ate them all in one sitting, next to a great filet mignon, scalloped potatoes, and sesame green beans.  I used Penzey's 4/S seasoned salt, my favorite!
