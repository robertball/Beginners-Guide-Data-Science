We liked this, but I altered it a little because when I smelled it the liquid smoke was a little overwhelming.  I added some soy sauce and about a tablespoon of molasses to 'cut' the liquid smoke a little.  I marinated the brisket over night then smoked it all day, very tender and full of flavor.

My family loves this marinade. I cooked my brisket in the crockpot for about 7 hours, it was wonderful.

This recipe is very good. If you try it on smaller pieces of steak, which would probably be good, also, you might want to halve the pepper. I tried it on a 3 or 4 pound brisket by marinading it for about 3 hours and then grilling it. Very good to excellent taste!

The only change that I made was eliminating the onion salt, and substituted one sliced whole white onion, slice thin.  Don't skip on the Red Wine, a Burgundy or a Cabernet works.

I left out the red wine and used 1 bottle of liquid smoke, celery-garlic   & onion salt and let it marinade over night. In morning I added 2 TB. Worcestershire sauce and slow cooked it in crock pot all day (7+ hrs). Delicious and tender.

I had to cut the pepper a little bit too, but I love the liquid smoke flavoring. It doesn't really say how long to marinate or how long to cook the Brisket. So I was a little confused. I only had time to marinate about 1 hour. I browned the brisket on both sides in a skillet, poured on marinade and covered the rest of the way with beef broth. Cooked on stovetop over low heat for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Wonderful!

I used onion powder instead of onion salt and 2tsp of pepper.  I actually marinated ribeye steaks for 48 hours.  The steak was very tender and we enjoyed the flavor.

I've used this but with a 1/4 cup of brown sugar added and I used soy sauce in place of the worcestershire sauce when I didn't have the worcestershire and it was awesome.

Was pretty good for such an easy recipe. Going to go a few steps farther next time with some variations from other recipes.

I didn't love this but maybe I was having a bad taste bud day because my husband and daughter really enjoyed it. I cut the recipe in half and used it on a 2 1/2 lb tri-tip and grilled it. I did use onion powder instead of onion salt. Will probably try it again.

Really good! I also added a little bit of kitchen bouquet, and Cajun Power garlic sauce, which is something I have readily available in Louisiana. After marinating, I threw my brisket in a crockpot because it was a small portion that I was cooking it to "top" some baked potatoes. I just halved the  recipe since I had less beef.
