This was a nice flavor, but a little too thick of a consistency for me to want to eat it as a soup. I realize the size of my squash may have been a factor, but it was medium sized for the options I had. Would be wonderful as a sauce with rice, veggies & chicken.  I will add some broth before I eat it again.  I liked the flavor though...nice to have a different take on butternut squash soup!

Excellent flavor. I added 1\2 cup chicken broth to thin the soup out a little. Will only use one tablespoon of red curry paste the next time I make this so my daughter will be able to eat it as well.

First off, I deplore! measurements like, "1 squash" or 1/2 onion.  WHAT SIZE?  Is it so hard to be specific as in cups, teaspoons, etc?  AARGH!  In any event, I made a half recipe, as is my standard procedure for new recipes.  This sounded like it would be good.  I love red curry, and had high hopes.  Actually, the recipe was quite good, even though my husband did not like it.  However, a few cautions:  I used one green pepper because I did not have any red peppers.  The overwhelming flavor of the soup was green pepper.  I would definitely cut back.  I used half a can of coconut milk, and ended up adding the rest because the soup was so thick it could almost not be stirred.  All said and done, this tasted like red curry sauce overwhelmed with green pepper, with a hint of squash.  IF I make it again, I will definitely cut down on the pepper and have extra coconut milk on hand!
