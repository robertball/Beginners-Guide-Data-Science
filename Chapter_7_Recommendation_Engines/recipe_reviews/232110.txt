I am the creator of this recipe and I will be adding a picture soon. It's the wrong size! :(  I wanted to add a few notes, I only use about half of the rice and save the rest to use with another meal that week. I also use almost an entire can of low sodium tomato sauce. I also use Sargento provolone/mozzarella slices (I break the piece in half and then lay the cheese in the zucchini boats, they fit perfectly). I hope you all enjoy this recipe as much as our family.

This recipe was awesome.  I had to use ground beef instead of chicken because that was all I had, and I cut the jalepeno to only one because I'm a self proclaimed spice wimp, and my children only like mild spice.  It was sooooooo delicious, enjoyed by adults and children, and healthy - veggies included!  I love a balanced meal all in one!

Perfect way to use up those over sized zucchini! I followed the recipe and found it to be a little bland so I doubled up on the worcestershire sauce, oregano, basil & garlic. Turned out great!

I enjoyed the concept and presentation though the overall flavor needed something more.  Good way to use bountiful zucchini.

Yummy!!
I did have to make some changes. I've had gastric bypass surgery and cannot eat rice. I cut the recipe in half, instead of rice I used 1/2 cup Quinoa cooked in chicken broth. Used a whole can of tomato sauce (15 oz) and mix Mozzarella in with the mix. I didn't have provolone. When sauteing the veggies I also added mushrooms. After I filled the zucchini with the meat and veggie mixture I added more shredded mozzarella and parmesan. I the topped it off with a can of Italian diced tomatoes. It made a lot of sauce and was so good. Thanks cookinmama for the great recipe.

Substituted chicken for beef and pork for the red-meat-eaters in my house; It was a hit!  The zucchini in my garden grew to the length of my pan, so I only used two zucchinis, but they looked nice and cut up well in the pan.  I brought it to a pot luck dinner, and brought home an almost empty pan!

It seemed very bland. Could have used some more flavor. Way too much rice for filling

Wonderful basic recipe to follow. I didn’t want rice and ran out of quinoa but it was even delicious without it. I used a very big zucchini which was so unbelievably tender,skin and all. Yum!

I didn’t have all the ingredients but substituted and loved having the original recipe as a guideline!  I used a big zucchini from a neighbor’s garden and some chicken I grilled yesterday. I had brown rice and used El Pato sauce with jalapeño in place of the fresh jalapeño and plain tomato sauce. It was a super way to use gifted zucchini and leftover grilled chicken!  Thanks!

This is great.  Thanks!  I added more provolone, just by taste.  I also used shredded chicken instead of ground.  Next time I may add more jalapenos just for the zing.

this was a great inspiration !  I changed it up as I didn't have provolone and used all Parmesan and ground chicken .  I used a quinoa and brown rice blend with garlic in a pouch for ease, used herbs de Provence in place of other dried herbs and added some scallions.  for some punch I dashed in 3 dashes of Tabasco.    Instead of tomato sauce I used fresh tomatoes , some tomato paste and a little chicken broth and cooked it all together before I baked it in the zucchini   .. really good thanks to the one who started a great recipe!

Outstanding. I made this last night.  What a hit. The only change I made was shredding leftover roasted chicken instead of the ground meat.

This was really good! I did change a few things...I used quinoa instead of rice and only used 1/2 cup which was the perfect amount. Also only did 1 pepper, yellow onion instead of red added mozzarella to the dish. It was de-lish!!! I I used one large zucchini instead of 5 small ones. Will definitely cook again ;-)

I haven't tried the recipe yet, but am thinking you could skip the first 15 minute roasting of the zucchini.Since I don't like zucchini too mushy, I think it would be cooked enough in the 30 minute roasting after it has been stuffed. Will try it like this and post a review following my experiment. Otherwise, sounds delicious.

I didn't read the review about only using half the rice, so I ended up having a lot of the mixture leftover even after packing those zucchini full.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I pureed a tomato other than that I followed the recipe to a T.  Taste was great and everyone loved it!
