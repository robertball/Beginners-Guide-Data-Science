after reading everyones review. I did a little tweaking myself. I added two whole eggs. granted its not as low fat then but it did give the batter the moistness it needed, and it did come out more like a brownie. I thought they tasted good and were very moist. be sure to let them cool for a few on the cookie sheet when they come out of the oven tho.

Surprisingly enough, this recipe was fairly moist. I did change some things since the recipe came out really sticky when I followed it. I used maple syrup since I had no corn syrup, also I added about a quarter cup of milk and added a whole cup of flour instead of just 2/3 cup. I also added only 1/2 a cup of sugar instead and the cookies turned out to be the perfect sweetness. I will definitely bake this again.

Despite the reviews, I tried this recipe and liked it.  I love chocolate and I browsed for something with cocoa and quick oats and got this one.  I was suprised to find that these cookies really taste like brownies.  I did add twice the amount of corn syrup which made them very moist and delicious!!!

I thought these were excellent. I don't understand the negative reviews. They DO taste like brownies and they are moist. I did add about 2 Tbsp more corn syrup. I also mixed the whole thing up with a spatula instead of a mixer. For those who rated low because there is an aftertaste - it's cocoa - so if you don't especially like cocoa then you won't like the aftertaste.

Quite yummy...I've been making these for about 4 months now, and just last week at the store, I purchased an Odawala Bar that tastes EXACTLY like these (minus the almonds). And those are over a buck each!  I made some modifications to the recipe as well. I use 1/3 cup whole wheat flour and 1/3 cup wheat germ (and no AP flour). As other readers have suggested, I use 2 whole eggs instead of 2 egg whites. And I let them cool on the baking sheet for at least 2-3 minutes before removing them to a wire rack.

I originally followed another review that said to double the amount of corn syrup in this cookie. That was a really bad idea! I finally came back to this recipe and tried it again, this time following the recipe exactly, but I had to add some vegetable oil because there wasn't enough moisture to incorporate the ingredients well. The cookies still turned out rather sticky, but much better than the last time. You can taste the nice hint of chocolate, but they still seem to be missing a little something that would improve the flavour and counter the sticky corn syrup. I don't think I'll really want to make them again.

For a low-cal cookie, this one turned out pretty good. They have a strong chocolatey flavor, but at all too sweet. Def. grease/spray the cookie sheet - they will stick.

I decided to ignore the previous comments and to try these cookies-I am a chocolate and oatmeal addict. These cookies tasted awful. Not very much like chocolate and not very sweet, even with additional sugar. I will not make these again.

I loved this recipe!! The cookies came out soft and chewy with just the right amount of chocolate flavour. At first I thought they would come out small but they expanded a nice bit without flattening. I will make these again. Excellent recipe!

I didn't think they tasted anything like brownies.  WILL NOT WARD OFF THE CHOCOLATE CRAVING.  I thought they were dry and without flavor.

Great low-cal/low-fat recipe! I followed the suggestion of using whole eggs and mixed the cocoa powder in with the wet ingredients to help dissolve it (always tastes better to me that way but it could be in my head.) As a health-conscious person with a positively insatiable sweet tooth, I will definitely make these again with a few modifications- could definitely use just a smidge more flour.

These are easy, healthy, and satisfying.  No, it won't compare to a full-fat brownie, but how could it?  I played a bit with the recipe - one whole egg instead of egg whites, old-fashioned instead of quick oats, added about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of applesauce and much less corn syrup, and when the batter was a bit runny, added rice krispies until it seemed more like cookie batter consistency.  Loved them!

This recipe was great.  Very chocolaty, a bit cake-like, and delicious.  The only thing I changed is that I used Agave Nectar instead of corn syrup, because that's all I have.  They turned out great, and the mix was just the right consistency.  These are so easy; I'm sure I'll make them again and again.

These were very good and stayed moist for a long time. Quick and easy to make. The only thing I did different is that I used dark cocoa instead of regular. Will make again.

I thought that it was delicious!  They lack a little bit of sugar, however for a low fat and low calorie treat, I enjoyed them!  They were fluffy like a brownie and the oatmeal added a nice flavor.  I dusted them with conf. sugar after they cooled.  I will make this again!

Here's how I got these cookies to 36 calories per cookie. 1) decrease sugar to 1/2 cup 2) use Aunt Jemima lite syrup. Here's how I added some tastiness. 1) used chocolate extract, instead of vanilla. 2) use old fashioned oats. Since I'm on a strict calorie diet, I measured and added up everything, totaling 1,174 calories. I used a teaspoon and got 33 cookies. This equals 35.58 calories per cookie. YUMMY! Thanks for the very low calorie cookies!

Disclaimer: I made these as brownies, not cookies. Used whole eggs, and added ONE RIPE MASHED BANANA (which really helps with the texture & sweetness). Also added some mini-marshmallows. Very tasty and low fat. Cut into about 16 small, square brownies. The banana taste with the chocolate is amazing. Baked at 350 for 30 min.

Good, even with all of my modifications due to not having some of the ingredients.  Substituted whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour, used whole eggs instead of just egg whites (for moisture), & substituted honey for corn syrup.  Would have added 1 or 2 egg whites for more moisture, and shortened bake time by 1-2 minutes, they were slightly dry.

So dry I couldn't mix it,.. had to add more egg white, more corn syrup and even a tbsp of milk.  Texture of cardboard and minimal flavour. Waste of ingredients and time.

This rating actually came from my husband. He and I love brownies and we wanted a treat that wouldn't make us feel horrible about ourselves afterward. Here's the deal, if you are making this recipe with the expectation that it is going to taste as good as a regular cookie or a brownie for that matter, this isn't the recipe for you. It met our expectations because we knew it wasn't supposed to taste the way a regular cookie tastes. We liked them. However, after reading some of the reviews, I changed a few things. I added 2 whole eggs and substituted half of the sugar with Splenda. I realize adding the eggs adds more calories, but I think it may be necessary for the consistency. Also, I don't know who can actually get 30 cookies out of this recipe, but I certainly couldn't. It made about 15 instead. I would make this again and my husband would eat them again!

these cookies taste pretty good, but the best thing is they are so healthy!  To make them healthier than the recipe suggests I used non-bleached flour, and honey instead of corn syrup. They are dry though so I added only half the flour the next time I made them and they were good.

I looked through the reviews of this before i tried it! I decided to go with the 2 whole eggs and maple syrup instead of corn syrup. I used belgian chocolate instead of cocoa because i didn't have any cocoa handy. I know this pretty much changes the recipe but its the same base in principle and it worked for me! The cookies spread out a bit but i started with a tester, so that went well! My kids LOVED them and they turned out super.

I'm surprised these cookies scored so low, I was almost detered from making them. They're actually quite good. There not exactly moist, but I still liked the texture. Extremely easy to make, too! Will try again.

While these cookies were very quick and easy to make, they tasted really terrible.

These are great cookies!  To boost the "health" content, I used 1/3 cup whole wheat flour and 1/3 cup whole wheat flour instead of 2/3 cup all-purpose flour.  Instead of white sugar I used a product called "More Fiber," a Stevia product with added fiber content.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used two whole eggs instead of egg whites.  They came out incredibly moist.  Be careful not to over-beat the ingredients; the cookies will come out tough if you do.

These are awesome and so easy to make. Great texture, moist and brownie-like. I didn't have corn syrup so I used honey and they tasted great. I don't understand why the yield is 2 1/2 dozen. I only got 1 dozen and I did not make large cookies.
That said, I can't wait to make these again.

3 STARS on taste, but extra star for EASE! My cookies tasted a little powdery, and were not the chocolaty rich flavor I was hoping for.  Very EASY and inexpensive to make, so I recommend you try them and see if they work for you. REMEMBER they are low-fat, so if you are really craving a brownie then this recipe won't satisfy! I used an airbake pan sprayed with oil, and my cookies did NOT stick. I increased flour to 1 cup (used wheat) added extra egg white (additional 20 calories) instead of including the egg yolks (which would be additional 50 calories per yolk).  The mixture is dry, but keep working it until it all mixes together.  I think adding walnuts (great for your brain) and a little drizzle of low-fat, lite, or sugar free Hersey syrup would complement them well and keep them Low-Calorie/Fat.

I think these are actually really delicious. The only problem is they are a little dry when done, so I am not sure what I'd want to change. I followed the recipe along with some of the suggestions. I used 1 egg and one egg white; I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup (I only used probably about 1/6 of a cup or less--I'd probably want to try lite corn syrup next time because the sugar was far too much and I could taste the maple); I also had to add just a splash of milk to get it all mixed together. I baked a small portion of the mix, and then decided to mix the rest with some espresso. I added just a small bit (probably 1-2 tbs worth), and it's absolutely delicious! I had to add just a little more flour (maybe a teaspoon) and some more oats to get it back to a decent consistency, but I definitely prefer it with the espresso!  I'm new to baking, so if anyone has any hints as to how to get the cookies more moist without adding too much more sugar (more corn syrup, etc.) I'd greatly appreciate it! Maybe the suggestion of a banana would work.

Easy to prepare, and pretty good tasting too. Mine came out a bit crispy on the edges, but chewy on the inside. They weren't overly chocolatey.

These were ok but I would not make them again. I thought they were really liquidy before cooked. When they were done, they were pretty flat. No one was crazy for them, not even my chocoholic dad. I gave them three stars because they were all eaten. But that was probably because I only made twenty four. Sorry..

Well, this recipe had some mixed reviews.  So I thought that since I like chocolate so much, it can't be that bad.  Then I made them...I even added some chocolate chips to try and meet my chocolate craving, didn't work.  I also added powdered sugar on top, that was about the only thing I enjoyed while eating the cookie.  Sorry!  I really wanted to like it.

I really liked these cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly.  At first it doesn't seem like there will be enough moisture to work in the dry ingredients, but keep working on it, and it will eventually all mix together.  Also, for someone watching what they eat, these are a tastey low fat/low calorie cookie!

These cookies have excellent nutritional value, but they lack in texture. They were a little bit crunchy, I would prefer them to be more chewy, make bars maybe? However, I will make this recipe again. They had an excellent flavor.

I thought these cookies were awesome! Must admit, though, that I did add a little more corn syrup to moisten the dry ingredients. Sifted some powdered sugar on top...yum, yum, yum! Good warm, but still chewy and tasty when cool. Try 'em!

These cookies really do taste like brownies! They are a little crispy on the outside and moist and chewey on the inside. They have a great texture and chocolate flavor and are low in fat too!
One tip, don't over bake. 10 minute baking time was plenty.

Used whole eggs instead of just whites and a smidge more corn syrup than called for and an extra teaspoon cocoa powder... It mixes up like tar and I wasn't sure how it would turn out but my goodness these are so good when everything is said and done! I will definitely make these again!

These are my favourite cookies. I crave them and then I just have to make a batch! They really do taste like a brownie crossed with an oatmeal cookie, which is like my ultimate dessert. I don't get what all the complaints are about... these things rock my world.

Delicious! I did make two significant changes: I used the whole egg, and instead of unsweetened cocoa, I actually used Mexican-spiced ground chocolate (which is actually just a hot cocoa mix that I happened to have at home). They came out moist and chewy and delicious - more like cookies than brownies though.

For those who need a quick and easy chocolate(and low-calorie)fix, this can help!  While not the sweetest of treats, this does have a nice chocolate taste.  I didn't have any corn syrup so I substituted an equal measure of honey.  The cookies turned out great and I will have no problem making them again when I need a cookie quick fix.

I tried this recipe to find alternatives to little debbie cakes in my sons lunch. The only thing I changed was adding the 2 egg yellows. My son loved them and said he would like them in his lunch.  I thought they were a decent chocolate low fat dessert. Of course full fat is better!

Needs something. My cookies came out so flat and lacked flavor. I even followed the recipe exactly. I won't be making these again

These cookies are addicting.  They're chocolately and chewy and you can't stop eating them.

i found these cookies rather a bit too sweet...i added some extra corn syrup as recommended and the cookies came out with a rather overpowering corn-syrup taste. next time i think i'll just add an extra egg or too. (I also think that these taste much better with milk because the liquid dilutes that corn syrup)

i made this using two whole eggs after reading the reviews from everyone else. i also used honey instead of corn syrup to add more flavour. They were not that great the first day, but i found they got better over the next couple days. i would make them again

for low fat, i was pretty impressed. i did, however, use whole eggs, and i didn't have corn syrup so i ended up using 1/4c honey and 1/4c brown sugar and 1/4c water to make up for it.  i think it was a little too much water though and ended up being more of the consistency of a brownie so i threw it all into a 9x9.  oh, and i also added 1/2 dessicated cocnut and 1/2c chocolate chips and although it probably upped the fat, it tasted awesome!  maybe next time i'll add a little more cocoa since i'm really a chocolate fan.  i will be making these again!

wow. this is a really, really great lowfatlowcal cookie. i didn't think it would be good from other people's reviews, but they were fine. followed recipe exactly; mixed dry together and then added whites, the combined, syrup, then combined, and finally vanilla. they were chewy yet crunchy.  followed another reviewer and baked 1st batch as a cookie and filled the rest in an 8x8 to make brownies. dusted with confectioner's sugar. if you try the cookies and realize the flavor or sweetness isn't enough, drizzle with honey. these were great, will def. make again!!! thanks!!!

I added about 3 tbsp butter and 1/2 a cup of butterscotch chips and sprinkled powdered sugar on top of them before they baked.  I only kept them in the oven for 8 minutes.  I got 36 cookies.  They're SO moist on the inside and just a little slightly crunchy on the outside.  VERY VERY GOOD this way.

Pretty good!  I followed the recipe to a T and discoverd that there wasn't enough liquid with just the egg whites, vanilla and corn syrup.  I couldn't even moisten all of the dry ingredients.  So I added a little canola oil thinking it would fix them up.  I didn't measure it, just added enough to make them moist - maybe 1/4 cup in the end or less.  The cookies turned out pretty good!  I feared that adding too much corn syrup would make them too crunchy (something I've experienced before).  
   So in the end I will probably make these again, but modify it slightly - perhaps 1 egg and 1 egg white, plus 3 T. of oil (or maybe 2 T. of butter) just to get them going.  Easy part was everything is always in the pantry ready to go.  I'm not too gung-ho on super low fat, a little fat is OK by me.  I also got 24 cookies total.

I made this recipe into brownies by doubling the recipe and pressing the dough into a 9x13 inch pan. I think it probably helped hold in the miosture of the cookie, but there is definitly a lack of flavor. For a lowfat treat, I guess they will do. Just don't keep trying them over and over again, as I did, waiting for a chocolate fix! It just won't happen!

Very good!  Tasty enough that my kids (and husband) will eat them, but healthy enough to make me want to make them again and again.  Only 4 stars because, well, healthy doesn't taste as good as butter.  I had to add about a Tbl. more of cornsyrup.  Make sure you spray the sheet, even if it's nonstick.  Great one bowl recipe!  Thanks!

OH. MY. GOD. These cookies are soooo good! I don't know why there were bad reviews. I didn't add any extra corn syrup, and they turned out great. I loooove them!

Good, very chewy. I thought they we're ok, but my boyfriend loved them. I used the suggestion of using half all-purpose flour and half whole-wheat. Definately, worth it if you're watching calories. Also I only got 2 dozen out of it.

Yummm...I made these cookies today, they were great. I used half all-purpose, half whole-wheat flour. I also did half white and half brown sugar. Next time I might try all whole-wheat, and there will be a next time! They spread out quite a bit and were nice and crewy...not sure how much they taste like brownies though...but I haven't had a cooled down one yet! :-) I also didn't get 30 cookies out of the recipe but I probably just made them a bit too large.

--I have now made them with 100% whole wheat flour and they taste just as good as the 50-50 version. But I have a storage question. If I store the cookies tightly in a container then end up turning soft. If I leave them in an open container then end up very hard. Any storage suggestions from anyone? Thanks!

I loved these and so did my nearly 3 year old son.  They really taste like brownies, and they're low fat too.

I thought this recipe was "OK". I will probably not try it again. My husband hated them. They have a funny after taste but I liked the texture. I am not aure how to improve.

I wasn't very impressed with these at all. They had some sort of weird after taste.  Nobody in the house would eat them.  I ended up throwing them out. Sorry.
