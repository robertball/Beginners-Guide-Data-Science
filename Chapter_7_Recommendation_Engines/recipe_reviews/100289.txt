Thank goodness I only did 3 of these to try them!  I did scale the serving size to 3. Hubby said the feta completely overpowered, and he has had his share of stuffed jalapenos in the past. I think the ratio of feta to cream cheese should be reversed. I may just skip these and continue making the bacon wrapped grilled jalapenos.

I loved these. I didn't measure the cream cheese or feta, just eyeballed it (as RR would say). After I added the cream cheese and feta I put them back into the oven until they got golden bubbles.   Oh & I couldn't find red jalepenos, so I just used green.

We made these for our wedding reception and they are FANTASTIC!  Some of the Jalapenos can be really hot, and there is no way of telling (size doesn't matter!) but the cooling feta is just fantastic.  We had a quite a few comments on these being great!

Easy and yummy as a side dish or appetizer.  I sprinkled a little cayenne pepper over the tops for a little extra color.  Served with chicken tacos and black beans.

I served these at my Thanksgiving party and they went over great.  Not too hot and the cheese combinations were a hit.  I used the green jalapenos instead of the red and a 5:2 ratio of feta to cream cheese.  Instead of marinating the peppers in olive oil I used vegetable oil and they turned out well.

I really liked how the Jalapenos turned out w/ the marinade and cooking them in the oven. I will definetly keep that part of the recipe.  I made half with just plain feta.  It was okay.  The other half I chopped up baby shrimp and mixed with feta.  Those were really good.

I used 5 parts feta to 2 parts cream cheese.  I baked them until heated through.  They went quickly.

These are awesome and so much easier to make than breading and frying.  I double and triple the batch cause they go fast at a gathering

Awesome! I used big green jalapenos and had to increase the amount of cheese, but the ratio of cream cheese and feta was good for my tastes.

I upped the amount of vinegar and was glad I did.

I also let the peppers marinate in the oil and vinegar while chilling. I think that melded the flavour more.

I was skeptical about this recipe, but I made it for New years Eve anyway. Everyone LOVED them. They were delicious and just needed a little more jalepeno juice to soak in to make them a little spicier. That would be the only change that i made. I used a little extra cream cheese and feta to fill them all.

These took way more oil and vinegar and then were oily and slippery. It was difficult to put the cheese on the peppers and there just wasn't anything special about them. I may try it again and skip the marinating and roasting the peppers first.

I think this recipe is missing something. They were good but something seemed off to me. My family seemed to enjoy.
