What an amazing recipe,  very flavorful with a nice kick of spice!  I made the harissa sauce from chef Johns recipe on this site.  I like it spicy so I left the seeds in the habanero when making the harissa.  Make this recipe exactly as is but keep in mind that the longer you marinade the chicken the more flavorful it will be.  Between 3-8 hours if you have the patience to wait that long.  Also,  Cut the final cooking time down by 5 minutes or the chicken will come out on the dry side and the veggies will be overdone.  At least that was my experience.  Making the harissa is a little tedious but sooooo worth it!  One of my favorite sauces and can be put on anything.

The only vegetables I had were red onions but it still turned out great. I will make this again and again. I am a new convert to harissa and am learning how to use it.

We cut the veggies into large quarters, tossed with olive oil, cumin, salt and pepper then grilled to perfection before cutting into bite size pieces to serve with the kabobs which we also grilled.  Add a little bread and some yogurt sauce and you've got the makings for a wonderful summer evening meal on the deck.

This was wonderful! I marinated the chicken in the spices overnight, skewered them and made shish-kabobs. Cooked them on the grill. I didn't have the veges. I served them over couscous. Definitely will make again!

This is so good! I added 2 green peppers and didn't have button mush so I used 1pd of baby bellas. I also upped the salt to 1 tsp. Added 1/4 tsp garlic powder and a couple shakes of pepper to the veg as well. My chicken was a little over cooked so next time I will cook for 15 min closed and 5 min open. I served this with homemade pita bread. It was spectacular.
