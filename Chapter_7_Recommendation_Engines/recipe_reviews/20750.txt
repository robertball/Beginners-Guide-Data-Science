I have made this quiche 6 or 8 times.  It is delicious.  At first I found that the store-bought frozen crust baked in the aluminum pie pan was often soggy or soft.  The last time I made it I removed the still frozen crust from the cheapie pan and put it in my oven safe glass (Pyrex) pie pan.  What a difference!  Crispy and flakey.  My Pyrex pan is a little bigger but during baking the crust molded to fit.  Another tip for ultimate presentation:  Just before baking place thinly sliced cheddar slivers in a starburst pattern in the center of the quiche.  Sprinkle with a dry green herb like dill or thyme.  Beautiful AND delicius!

This was REALLY good!!  I didn't have (or want to make) a crust, so I just didn't use one. Hubby liked it better this way, said "you can taste the crab better without it". I didn't think this was bland at all; the flavor of the crab really came through. I added a little salt, pepper and garlic powder, and used 3 eggs and Alpine Lace reduced fat swiss cheese and light mayo. (Prepared this way, it's only 4 points per serving in Weight Watchers.) Good recipe! Thanks!

This was really good, with the following changes: I added one egg, about 1/3 cup of green onion, about a 1/2 teaspoon of lemon pepper seasoning, and about 1/4 cup of white wine. I also used closer to 2 cups of cheese--a mix of cheddar, mozzarella, and swiss. With all the additions, my quiche had to bake for about 50 minutes. Without the additions, I don't think it would have been as tasty, nor would it have filled the pie shell adequately.

This was WONDERFUL.  My husband quit eating only when it was all gone.  I added a package of chopped spinach (very well drained!!) to add some green to the meal.  Served it with a fruit salad.  Someone mentioned that this was runny...I would advise letting this set for 5 minutes after removing from the oven.

The base for this quiche recipe is foolproof.  I love the base because it uses ingredients that I always have on hand.  I used jumbo lump crabmeat and Gruyere cheese and added 1/4 t kosher salt and pepper.  I did, however, have to make an additional half a recipe of filling in order to fill the pie shell.  No big deal though.  I made the quiches the night before the baby shower I was hosting and then just warmed them in a 350 deg. oven for 15 minutes.  Everyone raved aboout them.

This was excellent.  My husband is a very picky eater, but for some reason he likes imitation crab.  I did make the crust, i just like homemade pie crust.  The only modification was that I added extra cheese.  My husband ate half the pie and then asked for it again the next night:)  It looks like this will be a staple in our house. ok so here is an update: I have made this many times since and do it a bit different now. I add half of an onion chopped finely as well as some cayenne pepper, and I use three eggs. Also i chop the crab because i don't like biting into huge chunks. I have also made it many times omitting the crust

Our favorite quiche recipe is a Mexican one full of peppers and onions so this reipce was approached with some trepidation regarding potential lack of flavor.  We were pleasantly surprised and pleased by the turnout.  I adjusted a little, using a refrigerated pie crust that I pre-baked 10 minutes in a 9" deep dish ceramic pie plate.  I follwed other reviewers' suggestions and added an extra egg and a little more milk and cheese.  The only addition I made was to add a half cup of chopped scallions.  (I also forgot to add the cornstarch and given the outcome I'm not sure what purpose it was supposed to serve.)  The flavors here were delicate yet nicely balanced.  The addition of the scallions gave a dash of added 'oomph' that we think complemented the flavor of the crab and Swiss without overpowering it.  We'll make this again!

I made this for supper tonight and really enjoyed it.  I did add about 2 T of grated fresh onion and about a 1/4 tsp of salt.  Baked for 38 minutes and it was perfect.  Thank you for a great little recipe that's easy to make on a weeknight.

Delicious! I used 2 cans of backfin crabmeat (8 oz total), 3 eggs and omitted the crust. Served with a big green salad. I'm adding this to my rotation of family favorites!

This has become one of our favorite recipes!  I have found that using the flake variety of imitation crab meat works better than the lump because it distributes more evenly throughout the quiche.  Very good and budget friendly!

I like all of the ingredients in this dish, love quiche...so I expected this would be a big hit for me and was planning on having it for leftover lunches all week. The only change I made was to add some chopped green onions, but I was highly disappointed. It was a weird texture and the taste was extremely artificial to me. I am going to try one more piece later today, but I am afraid I'm going to have to toss the whole thing. :-(

This dish was great! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used three eggs instead of two, sauteed about 1/4 cup onion and two garlic cloves in oil and bacon grease, crumbled three strips of bacon and added some salt, pepper and cayenne pepper as well as a tsp of Frank's hot sauce. I also used low fat miracle whip. I used a little more crab meat and swiss than the recipe called for. I  love how the dish was so light and fluffy, yet creamy and the flavor was perfect. Some quiche's I've made were toughm eggy or soggy. None of that here. My husband loved it and his mother is an expert at quiche. I will be making this again and again! The only down side was how much we ate!

This was absolutely delish!  The only changes I made was adding one more egg to the mix, and I followed another reviewers advice and baked it in a pyrex pie pan.  Other then that, I followed it to the letter.  It was sweet, savory, and light, perfect texture.  Next time I make it I might try adding different veggies and spices for variety, but cooked as is, this recipe is fool proof.  I made it with a toddler roaming around my legs and a three year old running circles around the toddler...easy, fast, and amazing.

Excellent! I made this for an anniversary brunch and it was very well received, even by those who were a little uncertain about having crab in the morning.  
This recipe was also fairly quick and easy, which I appreciated.

Minor changes: I did bake the pie crust in advance (15 minutes at 425, then turned the oven down to 350, added the filling, and baked according to the directions) and I used light mayonnaise.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made a homemade crust with it, that although came out delicious, made it a pretty high fat dish.  I think if I do it again, which I will, I will use a packaged crust to cut out some of the fat.  In addition, I steamed some fresh asparagus and added it to the filling - I would highly recommend that addition - the two flavors were great.  Excellent dish overall.  All you need is a side salad and some crusty bread!

I would call this one of my tried and true recipes.  Have made it several times and never use a crust.  The most recent time I used pepper jack cheese instead of swiss.  Also added some granulated garlic, 1/4 tsp Old Bay, and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  This boosted the flavor and it was GREAT!  I always add something to give a bit of green color - either chopped spinach or sauteed kale - whatever I have on hand, 1/4 cup or so.  Served with salad and crusty bread, it makes a great meal.

Terrific!  I had 2 cups of swiss cheese so I used all of it, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  It's just as good heated up in the microwave the next day.  This is going to be repeated time and time again.

Just eh...average! Knowing that imitation crab is not that great (had leftover from making sushi btw), I expected the other ingredients to make it up for it but it actually ended up being mushy. Maybe gruyere would work and add green onions.

I made this a year ago and found it a bit bland.  I embellished the recipe today to rave reviews all around the table.  Instead of 1-1/2 cups swiss cheese, I used 1 cup shredded swiss cheese, and 1/2 cup shaved parmesan cheese.  I added green onion, a splash of Worcestershire sauce, and some fresh ground pepper.  Finally, I used a single can of real crab meat and approximately 15 medium size cooked, deveined shrimp (tail off).  I cooked it at 350 degrees, but found that 40 minutes was not long enough.  An extra 15 minutes gave a perfect result.

I am not a big seafood person, but for some reason I really like the imitation crab. I have made this recipe probably a dozen times. The only changes I make is that I do not use a crust, I use 4 eggs and evaporated milk for richness. My husband would eat the whole thing if I would let him but would have to fight me for it!  This is an wonderful recipe and I am going to make it for breakfast on Thanksgiving. Thanks for sharing it!!

This got rave reviews at our Easter party but I did make a few changes to the recipe.  Thank you to the original poster for providing a great base!

I omitted the cornstarch, used 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of fat free half and half, omitted the pie crust, used a cheddar and mozzarella cheese mix, REAL crab meat (8oz. lump)and since I omitted the pie shell I used some plain bread crumbs.

I wanted individual servings so instead of using a 9" pie pan I used a muffin pan that has 12 muffin wells.  Sprayed the pan with Pam cooking spray, sprinkled the bottom of each muffin well with plain bread crumbs, spooned roughly 2tbsp of the crab mixture into each well then sprinkled the tops with more bread crumbs and a little bit of grated Parmesan.  I made two batches of these and they were gone in no time.  I think next time I will even try reducing the milk to just 1/4 cup FF half and half and add in 1/4 cup of white wine and some thinly sliced green onions.

Absolutely delicious.  In the midst of a winter storm I had a craving for quiche and found this one. Didn't have swiss so used cheddar & mozzarella.  Read a review saying she made it without a crust and being lazy I did the same, spraying the dish slightly and added an extra egg.  Can't wait to try it with swiss cheese.  Thanks for recipe!!!

I made this quiche and a spinache w/canadian bacon. The spinache one was amazing while the crab one wasn't that great, although the next day while eating leftovers the crab one was wayyy better. Not sure why but if I make the crab again I will let it sit in the fridge over night and just re-heat it the next day. The only thing I did different was to add onion, salt, pepper and I did some swiss and some cheddar cheeses.

I've done this recipe many times and it's always been a great success.  Once I had leftover cooked salmon and replaced the crab on this recipe with it.  It was delicious.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

I was a little skeptical of this one but so glad I tried it anyway! I did use less mayo (1/4 cup) and added an egg in an attempt to lower the fat. My hubby gave it that funny look (like he's trying to say 'what the heck did you make now') but he ate 3 pieces and wanted to take the rest for dinner at work. Next time I will add some spinach as other reviewers suggested.

Delicious!  I added half of a small onion and some sliced mushroom, as well as an extra egg.  Took about 50 minutes to cook.  So easy to make with ingredients I already had!

This recipe is a winner!  Per the suggestion of another reviewer, I added in 1/4 c. white wine, 1/3 c. green onions, 1/2 tsp. of garlic pepper seasoning (I was out of lemon pepper), and 1 extra egg.  I also used 2% milk, reduced fat mayonnaise, Gruyere, and real lump crabmeat.  I think the next time I'll try adding in a little lemon juice and substitute asparagus for the green onions.  Thanks so much for sharing a great recipe!  This is a "keeper" recipe for an elegant luncheon/brunch.

I followed another reviewer's comments and added an additional egg, green onions and 1/4 c. white wine and did not use a crust.  This came out well considering I do not normally use imitation crab meat.  I rated a four instead of five because it went over good with the family but not great.  Overall, fun to use a new product and get the kids to try something new.

My family did not like this recipe.  However it is my fault for not making sure we liked imitation crab first.  If you like imitation crab you will probably like this quiche.

It was very good but I did change a bit of the recipe. I used real crab meat, 3 medium eggs, and spinach.

I made this with real crab and added some extra liquid (eggs and cream) to fill the pie shell. My family found it to be "too fishy," but I put some Frank's hot sauce on mine and enjoyed it immensely.

I need to re-try this another time. I don't know if it was the cornstarch I used or the fact that it was imitation crab meat vs. real. I'm also not sure if I like Swiss as the choice of cheese. It was very, very runny. I will re-try another time & post.

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I followed the recipe as submitted - I found the flavor to be bland & lacking in presentation, it even looked dull. I gave the recipe 3 stars when made as submitted (actually, I belive it is more worthy of 3 1/2 stars).  The second time I made this, I did not use a shell (really not necessary), I used 3 eggs, 1 1/2 tsp of cornstarch, 1 small chopped onion, chopped chives (to give it some color), added a couple dashes of salt and of garlic powder. With these additions, the recipe is a definate 5 star recipe.

Absolutely wonderful! I threw in a little garlic powder, used three eggs like many others suggested and used about a quarter teaspoon of pepper flakes and it turned out really great. I also used cream instead of milk because it was what I had on hand. This is saved to be used many more times.

Very good, it was a hit at the party I made it for.  I did adjust the recipe though.  I sautaed 1/2 a package of frozen chopped spinich with 1/4 cup of chopped onion, 4 oz. of sliced mushroom, and 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic.  I used 3 eggs because thats what many viewers suggested.  I used the crab and swiss as directed.  Not only did this dish taste great, it looked pretty as well.  Would definately make again.

So delicious!!! I doubled the recipe and my husband ate a whole one by himself! The next time I make it I think I'll use real crab. I bet that will make it even better! A great recipe and simple to make!

Excellent recipe!  My husband made himself sick eating so much of it and keeps asking me to make more.  I used 3 eggs instead of 2 and added salt, pepper, parsley, and garlic salt.

I thought this was a good dish with lots of potential.  Although the original lacks any spices, variations will really set this dish apart.  I added bacon and onions to mine, and also considered using green peppers and mushrooms (definitely next time).  All in all, a good dish that will fill the family's stomach!

After going through quite a few similar recipies and comments, the only complaint seemed to be that it needed some spice.  So I just went ahead and added 1 tsp of OldBay seasoning, 1 tsp of onion powder, little garlic, 2 tsp salt, 2 shakes of tabasco. After 30 min, it was no way near done.  My other quiche recipies cookfor about 50 min..so I let it cook more. I thought it was pretty good.  My husband said he thought it was as good as it could be for "imitation crab".

I love love love this recipe!
My sister gave this recipe to me after I commented how good it was when she made it.
I think next time I will put a pre-made pie shell into my own dish as the bottom can get a little soft and I really like another person's suggestion about adding asparagus! I will defenitly try this next time!

This was my first attempt at making a quiche and it came out rather nice. I didn't have any cornstarch around, so I used a tablespoon floor and half a tablespoon baking powder to thicken it all. By the way, I didn't bother shredding the crab or the cheese or beating the eggs, I just put all ingredients in a mixer and filled the pastry.

This was fantastic! The only changes I made were to use real crab and I added an extra egg. It also took a little longer to cook; around 50 mins, but that may have been because of the extra egg. My whole family thought it was delicious! Plus, it was super easy to put together:) Definitely a keeper!

This was really good.  I used Dungeness crab that my brother in law caught.  I added a little bit of chopped spinach (well drained) just to make me feel like I was getting some vegetables.  This also made me feel like it was ok to fry up two slices of bacon (chopped) and then in the bacon fat I fried up some diced onion.  Added everything to the mix.  Served it for a Christmas brunch and it was a hit.

This was pretty good, but even with an extra egg and more cheese, it didn't fill up the crust.  Also, I would chop up the crab next time, as a previous reviewer suggested.  Very quick & easy, and I will try it again with modifications.

VERY GOOD!  Unique and delicious (even for someone who doesn't caren't for swiss cheese normally!).  I have made this twice - once for myself and then the second time for a couple who had a premature baby in the hospital and our church group was feeding twice a week.  I know I took a risk taking a quiche (with seafood no less) for the couple, but they LOVED it.    Both times I used REAL crab and that's honestly the way to go.  I have lived in Alaska for awhile now and am lucky enough to get it.  The couple I made the 2nd quiche for is from the east coast and so while the crab varieties are different than what they grew up with, they also adored this recipe.    Definitely a keeper!

Had some imitation crab leftover that needed to be used up and this was a great choice!  Excellent flavor and so creamy.  I did add some chopped sweet onion, sweet orange peppers, a bit of chopped fresh spinach and a bit of Old Bay seasoning.  This will be a regular dish for us, especially during the cold winter months.  Thanks for this rec!

This is a great recipe. I always make it without the crust and leave out the cornstarch to make it low carb, and it turns out great.  I shred the crab in my food processor. This freezes amazing as well, I always make a few extra and keep in the freezer for a quick lunch

to make this slightly lower calorie, I skipped the shell and baked like usual. It's a nice change to your typical quiche.

I added an extra egg as others suggested.  Even my 2 year old loved it.  I did add a little more cheese, and green onions with some salt and pepper, but very simple and easy.  It won't be a weekly rotation, but definitely a keeper!

I love this recipe! I doubled it and baked it in a 13x9x2 for 40 min. I did not have cornstarch on hand, so I slowley incorporated flour into the milk, added half of a fine chopped onion and replaced the swiss with the chedder I had on hand. It came out PERFECT, and I can't wait to make this again!

This recipe is fabulous! I made just a couple changes... I used part-skim mozzerella instead of swiss and added some dill for flavor. Instead of using a regular pie crust, I used layers of phyllo dough to cut some fat and calories. It turned out delicious! Will definitely make again!

I usually try to follow a recipe exactly how it is before I start tweaking it.  That being said, we liked it just as the recipe was written.  I may play with it later by adding ingredients but this was great.

This recipe is terriffic!  I have used both the canned crab meat and the imitation crab, and they are both very delicious!  I know the calories in this recipe are not low, but it is worth it, especially for special occasions.  I served this to my husband Christmas morning along with some fresh fruit and he was delighted - almost ate the whole thing!

This recipe comes together so quickly!  I can get it into the oven in five minutes!  My husband and I enjoyed it for years exactly as written.  Lately I've gotten a little more adventerous and added green onion, or chives, or dill, or frozen spinach.  Amazingly my picky husband has eaten and enjoyed all versions.  Great as leftovers as well.  I highly reccomend this one.

I have found that if you add 1/2 pound of chopped shrimp to the recipe, it tastes even better.  You do have to cook it a bit longer, maybe for 60 minutes, but it's delicious.  My kids love this one, it's a hit with the entire family.

I've made this twice; once with 2 eggs and once with 3.  Definitely prefer the 3 egg version--much firmer.  I slipped a frozen pie crust out of the aluminum pan and into a pyrex pan; the frozen crust molded to the pyrex pan shape nicely.  I used low fat milk and mayo.  Next time I think I'll add some chives or shallots.

Added 2 strips bacon, garlic, kosher salt, crushed black pepper, onion, Frank's hot sauce, and a sprinkle of paprika on top.  Used 3 eggs, baked for 50 minutes.  Was a hit with husband and son.  Frozen Pillsbury crust was a little sweet, though.  Would add more pepper and cayenne pepper next time.

Although the imitation crab I used didn't impart any particular flavor worth discussing, this is definitely going to become my standard quiche recipe.  The flavor was great and the texture was consistant and creamy yet fluffy.  I rarely have sour cream or heavy cream on hand which is standard in many quiche recipes, but I always have mayo.  This had the best flavor compared to other quiches I tried.  I won't do the crab again, but I can't wait to try it with other ingredients.  A wonderful base quiche!

Absolutely wonderful!  Everyone loved it, and asked that I be sure to keep this recipe and make it again.  (I used a Pillsbury ready-made crust from the refrigerator section of the grocery store.) Prep time only 5 minutes!

this quiche is absolutely fabulous!  my SO loves it too, and he is not a fan of either quiche or imitation crab.  i make it frequently, and use whatever cheese i have at the time.  i also add salt, pepper, and a little garlic powder for more flavor.

I thought this was ok, but Husband - admittedly, not a huge fan of imitation crabmeat - wasn't interested in anything more than a few bites. I found it rather sweet and a bit boring. Perhaps a blend of cheeses might have added more flavor. Oh well, thanks anyway.

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't have any cornstarch, so I took the advice of another member and substituded a tablespoon of flour and half a tablespoon of baking powder.  I also added half a bag of broccoli that I microwaved for about 4 minutes.  I will certainly make this again.

Yum Yum! This is so easy and versatile.  I can't wait to try different ingredients.  I did add Lawry's salt and a pinch of garlic powder, as some said it was bland.  I think I will try with phyllo cups as small appetizers...

I used 8 oz real frozen crab meat instead of imitation and followed the recipe.  It was excellent.  I served at my Christmas Eve dinner party.  Thanks, Debra

Good basic & quick recipe but I found it lacking flavor.  I added old bay which made for great flavor, however I'll be looking for a healthier add.  Next time I'll also be substituting some healthier choices but sticking with this basic, good recipe.

With the addition of a little bit of garlic powder, salt and pepper, this was really really good!  Even my husband, who is not usually a fan of quiches, liked this.

My quiche took more like 55 minutes to cook all the way through.

Great simple recipe! Like the others I used 3 eggs, I had to substitute flour for the cornstarch (didn't have any), added some fresh asparagus pieces, and sprinkled in some garlic salt & parsley flakes.

Yum, yum & yum!  We loved this quiche.  So simple to make with simple ingredients but the taste was outstanding!  I had two pie crust so I doubled the recipe, made one in my quiche pan and one in a regular pie pan.  Both baked for the same amount of time, exactly 40 minutes.  I'm so glad I made 2 so we'll have plenty of leftovers!

Huge hit!!  I cut way back on the cheese and used havarti only 3/4 cup and a bit less of the mayo, which next time I will try Greek yogurt to cut back the fat.

Solid recipe! I used real, canned crab instead of imitation crab (two cans), and used a cup of swiss cheese and a half cup of mozarella. I also used a little Velveeta cheese on top for extra color, although it did nothing for the taste.  Bake time was at least 40 minutes, and my oven tends to be hotter than most. Next time I may add a bit of crumbled bacon for extra flavor.

I was a little afraid, but wanted to try a new quiche.  This is very tasty and SO SIMPLE!  The whole family liked it.  I make quiche often, so I admit I did add 2 more eggs and a whole package of crab because I knew we wouldn't eat it left over.  Very nice blend of flavors--thanks for sharing!

Great! I use 3 eggs, 1 spoon of milk and choped 2 green onions. I did not use crust to cut callories. I also used 1 cup of low fat mozarella and 1/2 cup of sharp chedder - it come great and very colorfull! I backed at convection oven for 25min. Next time should do at least 35min. Next time will add more onion and may be other veggie. Thank you for recipe. It is great basic recipe to use as is or to experiment with ingridients!

Everyone loved it. I did use low fat cream instead of mayo (I never ever eat mayo because I've read it is bad for you, thought I do like it). Also used mozarella and manchego cheese as that was all I had on hand and some salt and pepper.

Very good. I added the green onion as someone else suggested. I wanted it to be thicker, so I added 12 oz crab instead of 8 oz and added 2 cups of swiss instead of 1 and a half. Also, added some salt and pepper. Will make again.

Very good, easy quiche. I added green onions and cracked black pepper. I substituted cottage cheese for the mayo (which I don't like), and used 4 eggs and no milk. It turned out delicious, filling, and not runny at all.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was great. I also used 3 eggs, about 2 cups of cheese and added some chopped spinach.  My 16 yr old said it was GREAT and my 1 yr old even ate it too!  The base of this recipe will become a staple in our home!

Thanks so much for this recipe.  We had it for dinner, sprinkled a little Old Bay on top, perfect!

Oh, my goodness.  We have had this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Great "core" recipe where your imagination is the limit.  I have added spinach and green onion to this recipe with thinly sliced tomatoes on top.  Or I will completely change it up and add bacon and onions with cheddar cheese, instead of the crab and swiss.  Also, I have found that the crust cooks more evenly if I put it in my glass pie pan.

Good quiche but I prefer another one because this had a strong mayo taste.

Nice but has no flavor. I added some broccoli, red bell pepper and garlic. I also used egg beaters instead of eggs.

The quiche was very good but didn't come close to filling up the pie shell.   I would make half again as much filling the next time.

I liked it a lot. I didn't have cornstarch so I used flour. I only had cheddar available so I used that. I also used 3 eggs and added more imitation crab. I sauteed a half of onion and added seasoning salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I'll be making this again!  :)

I made this for a light lunch for my mother and sister in law, it was lovely! The only thing I added was fresh basil because it just seemed like a beautiful thing to do. I served it with a spring greens salad. they both asked for the recipe!

This is a very easy recipe, instead of imitation crab I used a full pound of real crab and added some chives for some color, everyone loved it!

Really easy and great!  I took the advice of others and added an extra egg and some red pepper flakes.  I sauteed a few sliced mushrooms up, adding a bit of salt to get the moisture out and added that with some chopped red pepper and scallions to the mix.  I used two 6 oz. cans of crabmeat that I had in my pantry and it came out surprisingly good.  My husband and son ate it and both asked for seconds.  Who says real men don't eat quiche?  I made another one with fresh mushrooms that I sauteed with onions, scallions, cheddar curds (from a previous night's snacking), and a little pan fried pancetta. Because of my additions, I cooked it for 45 minutes and let it sit for 5 minutes, but it really should have sat for 10 minutes to set up.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this a couple times and love it. I did make alot of changes however. I used flour instead of corn starch. I also added fresh mushrooms, red peppers, green onions and some extra spices. Garlic powder, and all spice. I made a home-made pie crust that was baked already, and it turned out great!

Loved it. Used 1/2 cup of egg substitute, 1/2 c of miracle whip and 1/2 cup skim milk instead of what was listed, saved some fat/calories. The result was just fantastic. Great way to use imitation crab meat.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but it turned out AWESOME!  I used 3 eggs instead of 2, used instant biscuits pressed into the pie pan instead of pie crust.  I also decreased the milk and mayo by about 2 teas each, and added some dill for flavor.  Substitute ham and mushrooms and cheddar cheese instead of the swiss and crab...  So many variations are possible on this one, but it always turns out wonderful!  Thanks!

This was good!  Took forever to set up though, I had to cook it for like an hour.  

Definately something different. It was good, but lacking that punch I would really like it to have.

This is delicious!  I, too, increased it to 3 eggs and did not use a crust.  I also substituted asiago cheese for the swiss and added crushed red pepper flakes (we like spicy).

Wow...what a dish.  This was fabulous.  I, like other users, used 3 eggs, fat free mayo (SmartBeat, not Miracle Whip) and also added sauteed green peppers, onions, and garlic.  I crumbed up 3 strips of bacon and then seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic salt, and a little cayanne pepper.  I baked it for a little under 50 minutes and it came out amazing.  The insides stay super moist and gooey.  For my first time making a quiche, I was quite impressed with the flavors.  Yum!

This was my first attempt at a quiche. It tasted yummy, but something just wasn't right... I had to cook it double the time on the recipe and have no idea why. I followed everything exact... but it came out really watery in the middle so I had to double the cooking time. Maybe too much egg? Not sure what the problem was... I also don't understand why there aren't any seasonsings listed. I added a little bit of black pepper and garlic salt.

I made this today and it was a hit with everyone.  I will definitely be making it again.  I changed the recipe a little to make it less calories.  I used fat-free mayo and just sprayed the pie plate with olive oil & didn't use a crust.  I also chopped a small bit of onions & green pepper, carmelized them and added them.  I used lump crabmeat instead of imitation crab.  Added a bit of Old Bay seasoning.  It was scrumptious.  Even my husband who doesn't normally like quiche LOVED it!
Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was pretty good.  Very rich, however very bland.  If I made this again, I would chop the crab along with shredding it, I didn't care for the texture.  I would also add some hot sauce or something else to give it a kick.

I made this for brunch with a can of real crab (6.5oz) and the only cheese I had, which was colby-jack. It was very good, quick and tasty, but I did end up baking it for 40 min. Let it cool quite a while before you serve it or it's a little messy.

My, my, these are certainly sweet.  The mayo was a little overbearing... Nice texture, however.  Although my guests were polite, I couldn't eat more than two bites of this.  Not as good as the name sounds - won't be making again.

Simple and delicious.  I added about 1/2 cup of sauteed mushrooms and onions.  I'll definitely make this again.I

Update:  I love this recipe!  The mayonnaise gives it a beautiful, silky texture.  This time, I added broccoli, home-grown cherry tomatoes, and onions to the crab.  I also used a smoked Swiss cheese.  It was delicious!

I have made this quiche many times, but always with real crabmeat.  This time I made it as a Crustless Quiche, an old recipe I’ve had for a very time.  The quiche as is is always popular and delicious.

The picture attached to this recipe is not accurate. There is obviously spinach or some other green in the pictured quiche but nowhere is it mentioned in the recipe.

Very good! I halved it and used an oval-shaped au gratin dish, spraying with cooking spray. I made this crustless. It is easier, lighter and nothing to detract from the flavor of the quiche. I also added a little garlic powder, dried parsley, parmesan cheese and a tiny amount of cayenne pepper.  Sprinkled top with more parmesan and a little paprika. It was ready at 30 min. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for a ladies brunch we gave for a coworker.  It was fantastic!!  I was skeptical with the mayo as an ingredient, but this was a keeper.  My husband loved it too.

Well, I almost made it exactly as the recipe called for! The only change I made was to add some Monterray Jack cheese to the small amount of Swiss cheese I had on hand to have enough. I may still have enough imitation crab for another one, because we both enjoyed this dish.

I used real crab meat from Trader Joe’s instead of imitation. Next time I would use a deep dish pie crust, add an extra egg or two, and add some green onions.

Made exactly as called for. I would make it again but only with fresh crab. I wasn't fond of the wannabe crab meat.

Added an extra egg and switched sour cream for the mayo. Also included some sliced green onion otherwise the quiche is very pale without color.

Pretty good quiche. I used a refrigerated roll out pie crust and added 1 Tablespoon dried shallots, 1/2 Tablespoon chives,  and a good sprinkling of pepper.  I used Sargento natural swiss slices, and chopped up about 8 oz cheese. Overall a good basic quiche.

I've made this recipe several times, tho I make it crust-less (I'm gluten free and lazy), and I use a muffin tin to make a dozen 'quichettes'.
I've made the recipe as is, added kale, used whichever shredded cheese I have on hand, replaced some of the milk with half and half when I had it on hand, altered the seasonings and spices.  It always comes out good.
 This is  a great recipe - awesome as is yet infinitely versatile.  Easy to make and tasty. 
My grandson says it is Fabulous! and my daughter agrees.

I made this as written with the following changes: I smeared a spoonful of sour cream on the bottom of the pie crust before adding the filling. I also used 3 eggs instead of 2 (my backyard hen's eggs are not all that large), and used closer to 2 cups of shredded swiss. Also, added a handful of chopped sweet onions & a dash of cayenne to the filling. Yummy! Will make again!!

Made this for the first time yesterday and it was a hit. So good had to make another one! I did increase the recipe a little to fill the pie dish but minor detail.
This is good cold too.
Quick, easy and delicious!

You don't need a crust for this quiche.  It was quite tasty but it definitely needs salt.  I think I would add spinach or asparagus next time.

This was really good. I made a few simple changes to the recipe.   Used real crab and 4 eggs and 1/4 cup mayo. Everything stayed the same and it was excellent. I will use this recipe over and over agan.

I have made this multiple times, and my boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE it.  The last time I made it was the best, and all I did differently was bake out the crust by piercing it with a fork on the bottom and around the edge several times and baking it for about 7-8 minutes before putting in the filling.  The crust was perfect and flaky and delicious.  Highly recommended!

Great recipe!  As recommended I used 3 eggs instead of 2 - glad I did.  Easy to make new versions - our favorite to date is cooked chorizo (8 0z. +/-) and half a small can of diced green chiles.  Mine took about 60 minutes to get done. Yumm!!

This was pretty good but desperatley needs onion or something. I added green onion to mine but hardly noticed it. I will use reg. onion next time. This will probably be delicious with real crab meat (eh, but maybe not worth the money)Anyway, good recipe.

I make this every once in awhile.  Most of the time it turns out great. However, I have had a couple of times were it didn't set up right.  Regardless, it is delicious.  I like to add a little green onion.

I really liked it, but my father didn't say much...I think it needed onions or spices.  Also make sure you use a shallow pie dish, if you follow recipe, cause it only filled my deep dish pie pan halfway, I knew it would with only 2 eggs, but like to follow recipes the first time!

I have made this recipe many, many times.  I always make it without the crust, just bake the mixture in a glass pie pan.  With some marinated grape tomatoes as a side, it is one of my favorite lunches.

Have made this a few times and it is very filling.  However, this recipe is not perfect as-is so be sure to read through the reviews and use some suggestions there on how to make it better.

I made this quiche for a dinner party, and everyone raved about it.  My best friend is still talking about it.  I did add a little extra crab and some green onion, but that was the only change.  Fabulous recipe!!

So, I know how people don't really like their recipe to be doctored with..or maybe that's just me :) This recipe was a great starter one, just needed a little something something...I used a low fat swiss cheese and a little parmesan. I added green onions and 3 eggs. The mayo was the Japanese kind that comes in that squeezy bottle...I have a thing for it. I will be making this again..it is a good recipe :) Thanks!

This was pretty flavorful.  I used real crab meat instead of the immitation.  Too expensive to make often, but when you need a seafood dish, this was EXCELLENT with a green salad.

I use 3 eggs and 1/3 cup miracle whip instead of mayo. Also add about 1 cup steamed veggies - broccoli, peppers, etc. - and some seasonings - salt, pepper, paprika.

This was pretty good and easy to make. We had leftover crab from crab leg dinner the night before. I was afraid it would be too bland as it did not call for any spices, so I added white pepper.Did however have to bake it about 50 minutes.I can see how this could be a good starter recipe. you could add lots of different veggies or whatever to have something different anytime.Thanks

Delicious!!!  This was a huge hit.  Very easy to prepare and pretty presentation.  The only thing I did different (by accident) was I cooked it at 400 instead of 350.  It was done in 35 minutes and was not runny inside or overcooked.  I will make this many more times.

Definitely has a sweet flavor - try using a very light, flaky crust to balance out.

I was not particularly impressed, it was good but not great.  However, my family really liked this, even my finicky child.  I used both canned and imitation crab and added nutmeg, but I thought it was a bit bland.  I will play with this recipe to see if I can give it some zip.

Very easy way to do quiche, but very rich.  I can't say I noticed much flavor other than swiss and mayo. Perhaps it would help to add some additional seasoning, as other reviewers suggested.
