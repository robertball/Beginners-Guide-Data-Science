Easy to make and tastes WONDERFUL.  I made a few changes, only out of necessity.  With changes or not, your family will love this dish.  I used fresh pineapple instead of canned crushed.  I added some water with a bit extra sugar since I didn't have the syrup from the canned pineapple. Also, I cut the pineapple into chunks. I prefer chunky pineapple in my sauce. Of course, I couldn't whisk the mixture, but stirring worked fine too. I had planned to take a photo to post, but my family devoured it before I could. Also, I didn't dice the green pepper.  I cut it (and the celery) into julienne strips.  The times are pretty much right on target.  You can make this dinner in under 30 minutes and your family will think you worked really hard!!

This was spectacular!  I used a red onion and instead of lemon juice I used apple cider vinegar...a little less than half a cup.  I used red peppers instead of green peppers and we loved this!  I served it with Jasmine rice.

I'm the first to comment on this dish and i must say it is to die for! All that i expected and more. All the flavors just pop out at you and its just so flavorful. The only thing i added to it that the recipe didn't have was some sesame seeds and i only used 1 bell pepper.

I'm a freshman in college and don't have much experience with cooking, however I saw all of the great reviews and decided to go ahead and give it a go.  It was delicious!  I was so pleasantly surprised that I was able to pull it off!  My mother, sister, and stepdad all said it was just as good as from a Chinese restaurant.  The only difference between the two is that at the place we get take-out from, they fry the chicken (like a tempura batter).  However, this is a healthier alternative to the fried chicken, and just as delicious.  I chose to make this with red peppers rather than green peppers, and I also used a sweet onion rather than a regular onion.  I served it over white rice, for which I just purchased the cheap frozen kind.  My mom asked me to make this again one night for dinner!

Just made this for dinner tonight. Everyone loved it.  I substituted the small sweet red, yellow, and orange peppers instead of the green peppers.  The girls like those better.  Also used fresh squeezed Meyer lemons for the lemon juice.  The girls said it was better than our local Chinese take out restaurants sweet and sour chicken (which they love).  Will definitely make this again.

Best and easiest sweet and sour chicken I have tried on this site!  I made a few changes out of neccesity, using a can of cubed pineapple with about half of the syrup and snow peas instead of the celery and gr. peppers.  It was AWESOME!  Tonight I will make again using the exact recipe!

Tried this just for a change....and well kind of wish I didn't. Let's just say I had my doubts when cooking it....and while it wasn't bad....as my boyfriend said "I'll eat it, but I won't ask for it" XD

This was a very easy recipe to follow, and will come out nice if you prep as directions say. 

I prepped all of my items before cooking to ensure that my sauce would taste how I wanted. It took me about 10 minutes to do so. I did however leave out the celery.

Cooking time was about 15-20 minutes I made rice along with the chicken.

This recipe was amazing! The sauce is just so good. I substituted the green peppers for red peppers as another reviewer suggested and I feel like with the sweet pineapple taste, red would better than green. I also did not have brown sugar and used regular sugar instead but a little less than in the recipe, worked just fine. I have to say, over a little bit of rice, this recipe is yummmmmmy! :)

This was soooo good. I am still salivating. Easy ingredients. I used fresh pineapple and mashed up with a potato masher. I might use a little less ketchup--maybe add AFTER everything else in the sauce.

This was really good and very easy to make. My boyfriend loved it! The ketchup freaked me out a little, so I didn't put the whole amount and I probably should have. Still came out yummy!

Delicious! This is restaurant quality! I will make this again for sure, we loved it.  I used cornstarch instead of flour and added some diagonal sliced carrots for color and a dash of red pepper flakes for a little heat. 
I also used pineapple chunks.  Great recipe. Perfect sauce!

This was delicious. It was exactly what I was craving and the recipe ingredients were all things I had on hand. It tasted good as is but I'll probably use a little less ketchup next time. Also, I threw in a little less than a table spoon of bread crumbs to thicken up the sauce since I only used pineapple juice, not crushed pineapple. One other variation I used was to cut the chicken breast at a 45° angle to make slices instead of cubes so the chicken would cook a little faster. For sure will make again.

So easy and delicious. I also made some modifications. Pineapple tidbits instead. Had leftover broccoli, snow peas, cauliflower & carrot mix instead of celery & peppers. 2 tbsp cider vinegar added for a nice bite. Hoped for leftovers...didn't happen.

Where we live there is a lot of Asian food restaurants and I have to say this recipe was pretty good. The chicken came out a little soft and soggy but was still tasty. I added some different vegetables to the mix like carrots and cherry tomatoes and Chinese snap peas and it came out good.  Will definitely make this agin.

I'm so surprised at how this turned out. I had family visiting over the weekend and decided to try out this recipe. I followed it to the letter. I did add carrots to the dish but that's it. 
Everyone enjoyed it including my husband who doesn't like ketchup or "sweet meats", as he says.

I liked the chicken, however, didn't care for the sauce. It was just too lemony and when everything was smothered in it, was a little too much for me.

I am not into sweet meat dishes, but I did like this one. I used apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice per another suggestion. It tasted just like sweet and sour chicken from a restaurant. It was a good dish, but I probably won't be making it anymore. However, I will make the seasoned, coated, chicken chucks for future dishes.

Turned out excellent!  We added chilli flakes and spicy ketchup, added the right amount of heat. We used a red pepper and a green to add some colour. We also talked a about adding baby corn!

This was surprisingly delicious.  I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup (because ketchup is vile) and it turned out great.  When I first mixed in the BBQ sauce the scent was so overwhelming that I wasn't too hopeful about the end result but I will definitely make this again.

I also used red and yellow sweet peppers, instead of celery and green pepper.

Love this recipe!  Easy to make, no soy sauce and tastes great! Used red peppers instead of green and next time will add water chestnuts.

This was ultra easy to make and SOOOO good. 

I tripled the recipe planning to freeze some for future meals... but my teenager kids finished it off before I could!

It's already been requested again!

Great recipe for a crowd and 3 generations . I doubled for 8 people.
I did not add extra salt as ketchup has salt in it and also cut down a bit on brown sugar .
Questioning my prowess in the kitchen however as prep time took me longer than mentioned even accounting for doubling recipe

My husband and I loved this so much.  I did add some extras to my sweet and sour sauce and improvised by omitting sum things.  I did use Chinese 5 spice. My go to all spice for Asian cooking.

This recipe is a good version of the dish.  It's sweet, but not too bad.  If you don't like sweet recipes, you might want to avoid this recipe.  As for us,  the family liked it a lot.  I would definitely make it again.

This was outstanding, excellent flavor!  But I must confess, out of necessity I used six cut up pork chops instead of chicken (didn't have any) and I was low on lemon juice so I used approx half lemon juice and half apple cider vinegar.  My wife  commented and said I need to give his five stars!  Will definitely make is again with pork or chicken!

I made it exactly as stated in the recipe except I used fresh pineapple cut into tidbits as I didn’t have crushed pineapple. I had guests that night and all four of us loved it. I will make this again soon. Loved it!!!

Very good and comes together quickly. I halved it and used chicken tenderloins. I had fresh pineapple spears on hand in juice that needed to be used, so I went with that. Better than take-out since you know what's in it.

This is my first time doing a full recipe (from a to z!) and this is super easy to make, and very delicious! The reason why i gave it 4-stars is because i made some changes to it. I added only half a lemon and poured a little bit (around 3-4 tablespoons) of white vinegar,  and decreased the amount of sugar (i felt 1/3 cup was too much and the ketchup was sweet already). I also cut some pineapples and poured a little of its water, since i didn’t have the option mentioned in the recipe. Overall I achieved the desired sweetness and sourness!  I loved it and so did my mom!

This dish was a nice surprise.  Very easy to make with ingredients that you are more likely to have.  I made it as directed except that I had a couple lemons to use so I used fresh lemon juice.  It had great flavor and came together nicely.  My husband was impressed!  Will definitely make it again.

It was good! I ended up adding a little extra brown sugar and pineapple to the sauce, but other than that I followed the directions. Easy and delicious!

As my 5 year old put it, "Mommy, this would be good if you took the sauce off and put it in a bowl."  Exactly.  The sauce ruined this dish.  I don't know if it was the combination of the lemon juice and pineapple but it was VERY sour and no matter how much brown sugar I added to it, it didn't improve.  I think next time I might try making this recipe and then pouring store-bought bottled sweet and sour sauce over it.   Also, it wasn't as quick to make as advertised.  Maybe I'm slow, but it took me about 1 1/2 hours from start to finish.

It's really authentic and easy. Almost tastes like my dad's. I used some apple cider vinegar (about 1/4 of a cup) in lieu of pineapples/pineapple syrup. And I cooked my chicken well done in the wok to achieve a crispy chicken texture (another bonus; everything in the wok meal!).

This makes your chicken pieces very tender if you cook it long enough.  I skipped the salt and instead used 1 clove fresh garlic and soy sauce.  I made the sauce and heated it in a saucepan and then combined the prepared the chicken pieces in dish in the oven for 20 minutes.

This is a GREAT recipe and easy to make.  I used fresh pineapple chunks and a T or two pineapple juice.  I didn't remove chicken from pan to sauté the vegetables just pushed it to the side.   We loved it and I will make again.

Fantastic!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time I doubled the sauce and more than doubled the pineapple.  I added 3 tbs cornstarch and water to thicken it at the end.  We liked it even better with more sauce.  I will make this regularly.  Thanks for the recipe!

It's a lovely recipes. I just made some changes:  I added soya sauce, corn starch and vinegar instead of ketchup and lime. I also marinated the chicken for half an hour first in salt pepper and garlic powder. It was very tasty.

I was really skeptical of how ketchup, a ton of lemon juice, and brown sugar could make a sweet n sour sauce, but WOW, I couldn't believe how well it turned out! Couldn't be easier. Loved the chicken breading, and will make chicken like that again even without the sauce.

Easy to make and tasted great. My kids loved it and said it tasted just like the sauce you get at a Chinese restaurant. I used a peppers and onions mix(red, green, orange, and yellow peppers, red onion) that was already pre cut from the grocery store which made it super simple. The sauce can be overpowering if you're not into that sort of thing but you could keep it on the side or add less of it.

I substituted beef stir fry for the chicken and udon noodles instead of rice based off of what was in the pantry.  It came out decent but definitely would be better using chicken.

Wonderful dish and really easy! I used the whole package of chicken my son brought home (1.68#), and used red bell pepper instead of green. I made slightly more of the flour mixture because of the extra chicken. This dish goes together quickly once you start cooking, so be sure to do all your prep ahead of putting the chicken on the heat. I had a helper in the kitchen to make long-grain rice, but both can be easily managed.

I made it family friendly for my family which included no celery or onion. I did add some some celery salt and onion powder two my sauteing peppers. Garlic salt and black pepper with the flour for the coating on the chicken. I also used half of an orange , red and yellow pepper instead of green pepper. All other ingredients the same.

Fussy hubby said "you'll have to make this again".  Changes  were using cornstarch mixed in some cool water and adding  a squeeze or two of ketchup to lean it toward the reddish sweet & sour versions.  An assortment of veggies can be used and cooked just enough to be bright and tender.

Excellent recipe...made some  changes...first I added a bit of cornstarch to the flour when coating the chicken breast pieces. I put dry ingredients in plastic bag and it was quicker and less messy to coat all pieces at once.  I only used three chicken cutlets. Also,  We do not like green peppers or celery so I used frozen veggies...I  rinsed 1 whole bag of frozen broccoli florets and half a bag of frozen red peppers under hot water and let them drain well- did not cook them until I added to recipe. .I also used sliced pineapple in heavy syrup. I minced the slices and added the syrup to the liquid sauce mixture as recipe states. Added leftover slices on top. After stir frying chicken pieces, I removed them and then added broccoli , peppers and fresh onion to pan. After five minutes of stir frying, I returned chicken and followed recipe as is. We loved it! Very flavorful!

Absolutely wonderful! I omitted the green bell peppers as I didn't have any on hand, but otherwise followed the rest of the recipe. It was delicious and my family loved it, including my baby. I served it with some steamed white rice with peas. Will be making again!

Made this almost exactly as written.  After putting chicken back in the skillet with onion, green pepper, and sauce, I put it in the oven at 350 for 25 minutes.  Uncovered.  The sauce reduced to a sticky glaze.  Chicken was very tender.  Delicious over rice.

This recipe turned out great! I used fresh pineapple instead of canned, cut into chunks. I also left out the celery because my husband hates it. The only other change was that I ran out of lemon juice, so I probably only used about 1/4 cup. It still turned out great! My husband wanted more sauce, but I thought it covered everything nicely. Will make again and again!

Skipped the celery (because I hate it) but otherwise liked this a lot.  I think I'll try adding more stuff to it without changing the amount of sauce since I felt there was a bit too much.

After I read the reviews, I decided to make this recipe even though I have never made sweet and sour sauce without soya sauce. I used more chicken breast, and instead of using flour, I made a gluten free version - sprinkled garlic salt all over the chicken then 2 T tapioca starch rather than the flour.  I omitted the green pepper, instead used 1/2 red pepper, carrots, half an onion, all julienned, celery and pea pods.  I had fresh sweet pineapple so for the sauce, I used 1/3 c ketchup, 1/2 cup  brown sugar, 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, 1/4 cup lemon juice and a scant amount of tapioca starch to thicken.  I would definitely make this again - my husband loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy - yes.
Quick - enough
Nutritious - somewhat
Edible - Barely
I should have known with a Chinese-American style food recipe that includes ketchup as the major ingredient.

I made this, but I didn't love it. I didn't like how tart/sour it came out. I wanted to be able to taste the sweet & sour, but the sour overshadowed the sweet. If I ever attempt to make it again, I will reduce the amount of lemon juice to 1/4 cup.

This was very good.  Did not use lemon juice, but pineapple juice instead.  Might use pineapple chunks next time instead of the crushed pineapple.  Served over chow mein noodles, but would also be good over rice.

Loved it and easy.  I did add a little cornstarch to flour misture as it makes the chicken a little crunchier before putting in the sauce.

I didn't really like this.  I used a really good fresh pineapple and less lemon than the ingredients called for.  It was too sweet and too sour.  I'm not a big fan of ketchup either.  Maybe the ketchup ruined it, I'm not sure.  The only thing that helped me eat this dish was piling on cilantro.  My child thought it was 4-star worthy, but not me.

I used only green peppers and pineapple chunks.  It was delicious.  Everyone loved it.  I added a little Corn Starch to thicken the sauce since I used 16 oz can with the juice

Most of my family really liked this!! Easy and painless. It was a little on the heavy side with ketchup, definitely had a strong taste. If I was to make this again I would use less ketchup. Other than that, it was delicious!

I actually thought it was pretty tasty, I might've added too many veggies while making it though!   It was easy to make and healthy to.

Made this the other night...Good for those who like sweet & sour chicken and it was super easy to make. It was good but we had lots left over and I can only take so much sweet & sour chicken. Next time I'll cut the recipe in half.

I would definitely make again! I just took the advice of another who substituted apple cider vinegar instead of the lemon juice. Just under a half a cup. Served with sticky rice and used red bell pepper. Family ate it up!!

Absolutely delicious! I've made this twice and served over white/jasmine rice.  I'm not an very experienced cook, and it's an easy to follow recipe. Definitely takes more than 25 minutes, but it's totally worth it. It's extremely flavorful and makes for excellent leftovers!

My husband and I really loved this. I made a couple of changes - I added an extra pepper and instead of 1/2 cup of pineapple chunks I used a small tin (385ml - Canadian) of pineapple tidbits, decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and omitted the ketchup. It was a real hit.

I( made this tonight and not only is it very easy; it tastes GREAT!  I didn't have any celery, though and i only used 1 green pepper.  Also, used pineapple in juice rather than syrup.  Definately a keeper!

Preparation wise fairly easy, I cut my chicken up for it on shopping day and froze it.
Next time I think I will use all red peppers they are a bit sweeter.
Taste wise it lacked a little flavor 
....so I will figure it out and tweak it next time.

I made this almost exactly as the recipe said.  Added some garlic, salt and pepper to the veggies while cooking and also used fresh pineapple and served over jasmine rice.  It was easy and very tasty!  The whole family enjoyed it.  It's on the rotation list :)

Great recipe. I've never tried making a sweet & sour chicken recipe before, but this was delicious. I used red and yellow peppers instead of green because that's what I had on hand, and I used real pineapple instead of canned. 2 lemons gave me a little less than 1/2 a cup. Only giving it 4 because there was a little too much sauce for the amount of chicken called for, so next time I will make a little more chicken or save some sauce as it will probably be great accompanying some vegetables too.

Really good, easy recipe.  I simplified this just slightly, I threw the flour and spices in a bag with the chicken, gave a shake to coat and dumped into the frying pan. I only browned the chicken before adding the vegetables in with the chicken, let the veggies cook down slightly then added the pineapple, ketchup and apple cider vinegar (didn't have lemon juice). Then I just let the entire thing simmer while I made rice.
For the pineapple I used crushed but I used an entire small can instead of half of one.  I added only a tiny bit more sugar to sweeten it up slightly after adding the extra pineapple.

Very simple recipe that makes a nice meal. My 8-year-old HATES pineapple, but she ate this with rice. However, I did have to season to taste, but I wouldn't rate it lower for that.

It's a great recipe.  I doubled the chicken for our family of six, and added two tablespoons of corn starch to the flour which helped thicken it in the end.  Used a small orange bell pepper and small red bell pepper as I cannot tolerate the green very well, and sprinkled some scallion over at the end.    We needed to adjust the sauce to our family ... cut the ketchup and lemon juice in half.  Added apple cider vinegar and adjusted the brown sugar up some. Next time I make this (and I will!) I want to add a tablespoon of hoisin sauce, which I didn't have on hand, and add some sliced water chestnuts.  Otherwise, very very good!

I tried this recipe, but made a cpl changes - I used cornstarch instead of flour since it holds up better than flour in sauce. I also used the sweet red yellow & orange peppers in place of green. I was wary of using ketchup only since I'm not a fan, so didn't use quite 1/2 cup. Also, after combining chicken & veggies, I simmered it for a little bit, then added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it a little. All in all it was yummy!!!'

I followed the recipe exactly. Didn't care for it. My boys (ages 3 & 5) tried it but didn't like it either, nor did my husband. Odd taste...I'll just stick to my regular stir fry.

This recipe was awesome! I'm a terrible cook but this was really easy and delicious. if you've ever had a sweet & sour chicken Lean Cuisine, that's pretty much exactly what this is like if you plate it on a bed of steamed rice.

This was good, not wonderful. My boyfriend liked it, but said the chicken needed more seasoning and I have to agree, but that's an easy fix. The sauce was nice, loads better than pre-packaged sweet and sour. I served it over steamed white rice and it made for a very pretty presentation. Might make it again if I have the ingredients on hand, but I wouldn't go out of may way to buy them. Heated up great next day.

I don't normally like sweet and sour chicken, but this was awesome. Very flavorful indeed. I added fresh ginger and I think that extra kick really did it for me. 

I played around with ingredients since I'm on a paleo diet, and due to personal preferences. First, I omitted flour, obviously, so I didn't batter the chicken pieces. 2 fresh lemons gave me 1/2 cup lemon juice, but you might want a 3rd handy just in case. Instead of brown sugar, I used just under 1/3 cup of raw cane sugar plus a tiny bit of blackstrap molasses, maybe a teaspoon. 

Next time I'll serve this as soon as I add the sauce (which had already been simmering by itself while I cooked the meat) because I don't want to overcook the green peppers.
