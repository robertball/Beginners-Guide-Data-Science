Very easy to make - great recipe to have the kids help with - the only thing I did different....once everything is combined they are very similair to rice krispe bars so I put wax paper over the pan to help smash it down, otherwise it's very sticky.  YUMMMMMY!!!!

I prefer real s'mores.  While it tasted good it made a mess that was very hard to clean out of my cast iron without ruining my seasoning.  It also didn't have the emphasis on marshmellow like regular smores have which is why I'm rating it with 4 stars.  If I make this again I'll be lining my pan with aluminum foil.

Had a bunch of people over for a firepit and hotdogs tonight and decided to make these instead of doing them the traditional way - it was also very cold (about 2 degrees above freezing) and didn't want people to have to wait for S'mores.  Anyway, I did it on the stove top (the butter and marshmallows), added chocolate chips with the broken graham wafers and pressed it into a 9" square lined with parchment paper.  Cut it into 16 pieces and everyone LOVED it.  Will definitely do this again, thank you!!

Since I do not go camping, I made this by melting the butter and marshmallows in the oven.  After mixing the contents, I sprinkled milk chocolate chips on top and spread when melted.  Yum Yum

This is great! We make ours with Golden Grahams cereal. Much easier than breaking up the wafers and also a little more flavor! Definitely a camping favorite!

Made this on the stove in a pot. Sprayed large baking sheet with sides with Pam. Sprayed hands with a little Pam and pressed onto sheet. Cooled in fridge and cut into squares. I would use a few more marshmallows next time.

This was fun to make! Actually I didn't make it....my daughter and neice did....and they had fun while they did it. We didn't do this at a campfire, we did it in a cake pan on the stove, but it worked great!

As others have stated, VERY sticky.  We cooked this on our last camping trip in the dutch oven.  I forgot to bring wax paper as others suggested, so I had to use the spoon to press it down which did not work at all because it was sooo sticky.  It also stuck to the pan really bad and took forever to clean up *** but it was DELICIOUS!!!  REALLY YUMMY!!! *** (Just need to figure out a way to keep it from sticking to cast iron dutch oven).  Have I mentioned that it was really messy and sticky??

I did this at home with the microwave. It is a cross between s'mores and marshmallow treats. The kids liked them.
