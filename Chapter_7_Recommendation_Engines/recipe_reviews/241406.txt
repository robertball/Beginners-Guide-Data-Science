I made this as is except I used fresh cooked beets and some water (and maybe a little more chocolate chips). I wonder if I screwed up the proportions though as I was only able to fill my 3 loaf pans about 1/3 of the way full. The result was tasty and chocolate-y but more like a brownie than a cake. Next time I think I'll just use 2 loaf pans or a 8x8 brownie pan.

I only ever make half of this recipe and have probably done it differently a dozen times now. The only one that it was bad was when I used under cooked, barely blended beets (idk what I was thinking). The last time I added orange zest to the top and it was amazing!

I made it according to the recipe and it has a bit of an earthy after tone. I think next time I would reduce the juice from the beet can and use water to purée the beets. The cake is super moist and delicious.

I was looking for a way to disguise unwanted fresh beets, and this recipe did it! I boiled the beets until fork tender (40 minutes or so), peeled them and used water to purée. Due to baking with a toddler, I baked as mini muffins (got 30 from a half recipe) and accidentally used bread flour and forgot the chocolate chips. Mini muffins baked in about 12 minutes. Toddler ate 3 straight from the cooling pan, so they’re a hit!

Very good cake! I added 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of 1/2 just to make sure it was chocolaty enough. It is dense fudgey and holds together well just as the recipe contributer says.

This was a great way to use up some extra beets. I used 4 small-medium beets that I had leftover from a hummus recipe. I used 1/2 cup of water when I ground them in the food processor and used a full cup of chocolate chips. Delicious, moist, and very fudgey!

The kids loved it saying it's a cake that tastes like a brownie. I used half canola and half olive oil and poured all the batter into an 8x8 inch glass pan and baked a little longer (until passing the clean toothpick test).

Delicious! I used a 9x13 pan for 30 minutes and it was perfect. I pureed the beets with a splash of tap water instead of beet juice as recommended and used half vegetable oil/half olive because I've never made an olive oil cake...
I also put a bit of homemade icing on it but it can stand alone as well. Wonderful!

This is the second time I have made this cake.  my friend who hates beets loves this cake.  I use a cake mix too.  It's so rich I don't use any frosting just a shake of powdered sugar.
