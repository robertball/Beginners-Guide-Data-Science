This is a good method.  The overnight soak - cook on low is great.   This recipe needs more salt.  Also, you don't need the oil at all.  I prefer the beans more whole so I didn't smash / mash them but they are good like that.  I just prefer to not use any fat to refry the beans.

I made these with Italian barlotti beans because I don't have pinto beans available to me. I enjoyed the ease and healthiness of having refried beans without all the additives and sodium with store-bought. They were delicious on my tacos and burritos. Thank you Melissa Lindsey Gibson for the recipe.

I added a few chunks of onion  and a few cloves of garlic when starting to slow cook to add a little more healthy flavoring.  YUM!

I make this daily. Somehow the "Chef" went to far. I'm still trying to understand what the oil, salt and leaf are for. It's so much simpler than you might think. Plus all the extra stuff can easily be added later or even per serving. Not everyone wants the same unnecessary twist on food the " Chef" does.

Add extras so it becomes personal to your taste, I added one green chile pepper for beans with a kick and a spoonful of Knorrs chicken flavor and dash of cumin and garlic powder because thatâ€™s how I make my beans on the stovetop.  Basically I copy my usual way onto the crockpot.    The soaking of the beans is new for me but the beans are super good.

I always go to Pollo Loco to get this but I decided to make it myself for the first time ever and guess what! Super easy and I enjoyed it for lunch today.

I had to improvise the amounts and there was too much oil.  Easy recipe however.

The beans are easy to prepare. I added diced jalapeno and onions to the slow cooker. I didn't mash them since they were great as is.
