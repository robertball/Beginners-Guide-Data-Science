I LOVE panzanella salad, and I LOVED this! I did cheat and use marinated asparagus (I've been trying to figure out what to do w. it, lol), but that just added an extra yum. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

I added too much bread and didn't compensate with enough sauce and didn't let set long enough.

This was delicious - loved it. Had more than I needed though and decided to keep some in the fridge for leftovers. If you think you'll do this, don't add all the bread initially. Store the unused bread in an airtight container until needed. It tasted fantastic the next day when I had it for lunch!

Good flavor but turned out slightly soggy. I added fresh herbs.

I made this for a dinner party with some other foodies & it was a big hit!   Even better the next day as stated by other reviewers.  I will make this again and again...

This makes a very large salad, great for a Sunday dinner for 5 to 6 people; the kalamata olives are the best part!. I have a few recommendations:  If you don't have crusty bread, use large croutons instead, and if you don't have olive oil and red wine vinegar you can use Italian dressing. For the asparagus, fill a bowl with water add ice cubes, let that sit on the counter until the asparagus is boiled, dump into the bowl after it is cooked. Use the pearl size mozzarella balls or cut them in half before mixing into the salad. Toss the salad with the dressing (omit the bread) let it sit in the fridge or table for 20 minutes or more, and then toss the bread/croutons in at the very last minute. When the bread is mixed in early it gets very, very mushy; if you intend to have leftovers, it's best to store the salad without the bread/croutons mixed in. Sprinkle shaved Italian style cheese on top before serving. Meanwhile, it's a very good mix of vegetables and a tasty delicious salad!

Absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I tripled everything.  Only needed to double the dressing, though. Served it to a group of 22 and everyone raved about it.
