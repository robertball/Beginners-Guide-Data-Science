Easily a new weekend favorite and perfect for making large batches for week lunch prep. Love the addition of the cauliflower and zucchini which makes me feel like I'm making healthier choices. Only cheat was I sprinkled a little bit of parmesan cheese on top (which is not Paleo-friendly) - Omit the cheese to make it fully Paleo.

This was my first time to even stuffed cabbage and I used turkey instead of beef. The instructions were so easy to follow and the taste was outstanding. I will make these again.

Super easy and foraying healthy.  A bit time consuming the first time I made it, However I was able to cut prep in time the second time.  I left the egg and flour out never missing it in the outcome.

These were tasty little morsels, but the prep time and the number of steps make it unlikely that I repeat this.  I prepared exactly as directed, and I did not change any ingredients, except to use only one head of cabbage.  This dish was not part of my culture, growing up, so, though I have heard of it, I've never had it before.  It was tasty and filling.  A great way to incorporate vegetables, I believe I will omit the cabbage and turn it into a meat loaf,  which IS part of my culture.  I served it with pureed cauliflower, subbing for mashed potatoes, and we enjoyed the meal.  Thanks for the idea!

Great for Low carb/keto  diet. Didn't even miss the rice. I made my own sauce though. I just use tomatoe sauce, sweetener and a bit of vinegar for a sweet and sour sauce. Will make again and again. Thanks for the recipe

Fantastic recipe! These were outstanding!  The only thing is that I found it to be labor intensive. I work full time so a Thursday evening wasn't the best choice. I would definitely choose to make them on a weekend. Oh, and invite the kids. This recipe is enough to feed an army!

This was a hit with my boys and husband who had resisted the Paleo movement in our home. I used collard greens for half the recipe and liked that they were sturdier than cabbage leaves. I cut out the tough parts of the stem too. It had been added to the family favorites list
