These are perfect! The batter gets super thick. I used Amy C's Brown Rice Flour Blend (on AR) instead of the type listed. I didn't add any more almond milk than written and I'm glad I didn't. The waffles were crispy outside and tender on the inside. The flavor is excellent! A great recipe to keep handy. Make extra and freeze; you'll want these around all the time.

Delicious, but I had to add additional almond milk and pumpkin puree because the batter was too thick to spread in my waffle iron.  I'm delighted to have a wonderful gluten-free, dairy-free recipe for my favorite fall brunch item!

I substituted rice milk instead of almond and a tad bit of olive oil instead of coconut and goose eggs instead of chiken but i only used 2 bc goose eggs are bigger (I'm allergic) AND STILL THEY TURNED OUT GREAT

Fantastic, my whole family loved it.  So yummy we didn't need to add any butter or syrup at the table.  I doubled the recipe to use the whole can of puree and to have leftovers.   I almost always make a few changes.  I used Bob's 1 for 1 flour and Bob's GF oats (made into meal in the food processor).   Dairy milk.  For sweetness I used half Maple syrup and half coconut sugar.  I actually ran out of cinnamon and used cinnamon extract and I omitted the pumpkin spice.  Nice thick batter, need to spread it out in the waffle iron but they cook up great. I turned my heat down from 5 to 4 (out of 7) as they started to get just a bit over done.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These came out pretty dry; I used Pillsbury GF mix.  Very thick batter, and I wasn’t thrilled with the texture at all.  My grands are coming to visit. Hope they love them. We will see. I certainly won’t make them for myself again.

This is a great recipe as-is, but I‘m only giving it four stars because of the addition of the maple syrup to the batter. I made half the recipe with the syrup and half without and couldn’t really tell a difference in taste at all. If I can’t taste it, why add the extra calories? Drizzling (really just a small drizzle—like the amount in total the recipe calls for!!) the syrup on the top of the finished waffles or lightly dusting with powdered sugar adds the sweetness so you can actually taste it.

These waffles were pretty good. I used 1/4c coconut flour, 1 c rice flour and 1 c almond flour. I think next time I’d try it with different flours, as they were a tad dry. However nothing that couldn’t be solved with a lake of syrup. Very filling! Fun pumpkin idea.

In deciding something to make with leftover pumpkin I did a Google search and made these earlier today for my wife to have for brunch, she's both gluten and dairy free.  We were both amazed by the texture/flavor and spice balance, all of which is perfect and needs no tweaking!  Followed the recipe exactly expect for using rice milk in place of the almond milk since I didn't have almond milk on hand.  Used my wife's special flour blend of white/brown rice, tapioca and coconut flours with xanthum gum.  Some of the best waffles I've ever head, and I'm not gluten or dairy free!  Thanks for a great recipe, I've bookmarked it and will definitely be making again!  :-)

I followed recipe & added about 2T agave nectar for just a little more sweetness. I was concerned they might take on a coconut flavor from the oil, but they didn’t! I might add a little more spice next time, but I like a lot. Thanks for great recipe! :)
