Despite the review that RotorTrash left (and yes, my taste buds are perfectly refined, so thank you for that), I used cheddar. The chance that a family of five on a budget will have goat cheese is slim to none. It was very, very good and my kids loved it. RotorTrash, I hope to someday use goat cheese, but in the meantime, my very refined taste buds loved the cheddar.

Who knew cheese perference was such a controversial issue, especially in a dish that's basically peasant food. (The best kind in IMHO.)  Since there are varieties of goat cheese that range from mild to pungent, and from fresh to aged, the recipe as written leaves a lot a wiggle room. Like saying use a half a cup of cow cheese.  And in this recipe, that's okay because it's hard to mix potatoes, cheese and smoked pork without coming up with something that tastes wonderful.  I made it with asiago, new potatoes and pancetta because that's what I had on hand.  Using maple bacon and sharp cheddar would make it love letter to Vermont.  Someone mentioned using feta, I think, which would make it more delicate and I'd probably pair that with Canadian bacon. Onions or scallions can be substituted for leeks.  Oregon Golds for a softer texture, Reds for a firmer one. And that's what I like about this recipe. It's all good.

This is a great recipe!  I substitued cheddar for the goat cheese and it still turned out wonderful.  I will make this one over and over again! *****Made this again 10/14/2005 with the correct ingredients, and I think I prefer the cheddar I used last time over the goat cheese.  I bet blue cheese would be yummy too.  Used a bag of baby tri-color potatoes (purple, red, and yellow) from Trader Joe's.  To the reviewer wondering what size of potatoes to use, I used potatoes that were probably 4-5 inches long the last time I made this, and it seemed to work well.

I dont know why anyone would choose to use cheddar in this recipe over goat cheese. The cheddar would take away numerous levels of depth from the amazing flavor combinations in this beautiful gratin. If your taste buds aren't refined enough for goat cheese or you dont have it on hand, dont waste your time. This is one of the best recipes I have found on this site, My ONLY complaint is that it doesnt make nearly enough. I am bringing this to Thanksgiving dinner this year, it is sure to be a hit.

I found this recipe and was intrigued. I decided to make this with ingredients I had on hand: Idaho rather than purple potatoes, Feta rather than Goat Cheese, and Green Onion rather than leaks. I felt these were minor modifications and am pleased to report that this lived up to its name...it is indeed FABULOUS. I was concerned about the lack of herbs and seasonings but it was perfect as written. I did top with fresh chives, from my garden, so that I could take a "pretty" picture. Thanks for this recipe as it is a keeper.

I made the recipe exactly as written.  Loved it!! Got mad reviews from my finicky friends.  I really loved the flavor of the goat cheese.  Would never think of using anything else.

This is so yummy! I didn't have bacon or goat cheese, so I substituted canadian bacon slices and mozzarella. Even so, the flavors are wonderful. I can't wait to make this again.

This potatoe dish was DELICIOUS!!
A few minor comments -
1) This is not a difficult recipe, but it does take a little preparation time.
2)  I used regular Idaho potatoes, and it worked fine.
3)  This dish may be alittle rich for some people's taste, so just decrease the cheese and bacon or increase the potatoes.

This was a great recipe, but I made some modifications. First, I didn't have any bacon so I left that out and sauteed 2 leeks and a shallot in a combo of butter and olive oil. Then I sliced a peeled apple very thinly and threw that in with the leeks and shallot. Next I used 6 purple potatoes sliced them really thin and coated them with flour. Then I threw them in with the leek/shallots/apples. I don't know if I used too much flour or what, but the mixture was still very thick even after adding a half cup of milk, I ended up using about a cup and a quarter of milk. Then I added cheddar cheese mixed it up really well, put it in a casserole dish, topped with breadcrumbs and baked at 400 for about 35 mins. MMMM Good! Thanks for the recipe Stacey!

I want to try this recipe, but I'm always baffled by measurements like "8 purple potatoes."  It's like saying "one onion."  Sizes vary from golfball to softball size, so the flavor would certainly be affected by the size you chose. The potatoes I have on hand are very small and I don't know if purple potatoes are sold in larger sizes. A reference to weight or volume (4 cups slice for example)would be much more helpful.  Has anyone who has made this give a more accurate proportion?

I deducted a star not because of taste, but because this recipe should list the amount of potatoes by weight, not by quantity since potato sizes can vary greatly. That said, I doubled the recipe, used a 2 LB bag of potatoes, and baked in a 9x3 dish. I didn't have goat cheese or leeks, so used cheddar and one garden fresh shallot. I removed the bacon before adding the shallot and chopped. Once the shallot was cooked to my liking, I replaced the bacon, added the milk and cheese first (to melt and heat up easier) then the potatoes. If I ever have goat cheese I need to use up, I'll try in  this recipe, but it tastes great with cheddar.

This was delicious!  Easily the best gratin potatos I have EVER made - this recipe will be my new stand-by for potatos.  (I had to rate it 4 stars because I changed a few things - used cheddar as suggested by other reviewers, and because it was all I had on hand, and omitted the bacon since we don't eat pork).  I look forward to trying it with goat cheese though - it sounds amazing.  Thanks for an easy, yummy recipe.

I love this recipe!  What a great way to use leeks without making soup.  I couldn't find purple potatoes so I used a combonation of red and yukon gold, and added shallots.  I worried about the cheese, but it was perfect!  We couldn't get enough.

Perfect, easy and versatile recipe!  I didn't have leeks or goat cheese, but happened to have a tub of crumbled bleu cheese in the fridge, so used that and an onion.  I got rave reviews, but I think I will prefer the goat cheese - can't wait to make it again!

I also substituted cheddar for the goat cheese, and I found the flavor to be a little bland, although I think a little salt might have done the trick.  This was an easy recipe, and I will try it again adding some salt and possibly more milk.

So good, and I've made this many times. I usually add a couple of garlic cloves in the food processor when I'm slicing the potatoes.

I cooked more bacon than recipe stated to use with a different dish.  This created too much bacon grease and the potatoes were a little greasier than they needed to be.  I still loved them but I would follow the directions more closely next time and use just 4 strips of bacon.

extremely good. 8 potatoes is a sort of vague amount, so i weighed 8 average blue potatoes (which are fairly small) and came up with 1.25 lbs, which seems about right for 4 servings. i used feta, as the goat cheese i had on hand is $24/lb...not using that for peasant potatoes! a half an onion was a fine substitute for the unavailable leek, and i didn't attempt to cook the mixture together before baking - it seemed like a silly and slightly redundant idea. the end result was amazingly creamy and crispy at the same time. i will make this again with different potatoes and cheeses; i've got a block of smoked gouda that i think would be divine!

This was a delicious recipe for leeks which I sliced in my food processor using the 2 mm slicing blade. I drained some of the bacon fat as it was too plentiful. I used red-skinned potatoes, but they must have been larger than the recipe called for because I ended up using double the flour to coat the potato slices. I increased to one cup of milk with about 10 ounces of goat cheese. I used a larger glass dish - 9 by 13 inches. The flavor and texture was perfect and a real hit with my family.

Excellent recipe. Everyone loved it. I found that it was too much flour so it was a little too dry after baking.  Minor modifications next time but go for this one.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. My daughter put me up to buying purple potatoes and I was so happy to know that *somebody* must have a recipe to cook them. I used shredded sharp cheddar, turkey bacon and rice flour.
