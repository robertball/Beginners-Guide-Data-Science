Easy to make, with just the right taste of heat!  I used cinnamon chips since I didn't have chocolate chips, and omitted the cinnamon.  When pouring this into the pan, I doubted that it would firm up.  I was pleasantly surprised when it did firm up!  One suggestion for others who want to make this is to sift the powdered sugar before combining ingredients, so you don't wonder what kind of nuts were used!!!

I will definitely make this again.  I used coconut milk and butter (I won't use margarine).  I had to throw the whole mix back in the saucepan because my chocolate chips weren't melting completely by pouring the liquid over all the dry ingredients (next time I think I will try melting the chips in the saucepan with the coconut milk and butter).  Measurement-wise, I ended up adding more coconut milk to make a creamier texture.  I didn't measure, just added a little at a time while the mixture was in the saucepan.  First time making fudge and my coworkers loved it!  Thank you!

It seems that it would be okay but the heated ingredients did not seem to melt the chocolate chips.  Could perhaps the amounts be wrong?   My ending consistency was not the same as the picture, not as moist.  It was very dry and hard to get to stick together.
