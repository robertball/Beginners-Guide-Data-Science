I have made this salad for 30 years. The trick is not scorching the sauce. Times change so I have added pepper cheese to this, gives it a really good flavor balance.

Excellent, to me it was nostalgic and comforting.  Reminded me of a salad that would have been served at a wedding or baby shower 40 years ago.  It is sweet upon first bite, however, the cheese balances it with a bit of tanginess.  I will make this again.

This is a simple salad to make.  I ate it once at a small restaurant in town and they called it "Pineapple Cheese Salad".  It was served along with a croissant and chips.  Perfect!
