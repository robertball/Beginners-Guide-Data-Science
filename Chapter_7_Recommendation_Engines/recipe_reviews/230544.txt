I cut this back to one large serving and used reduced fat milk instead of half-n-half. This is DELICIOUS. I actually made two, one right after the other. Seriously heaven in a cup.

This is SO good. It was a bit too thick and sweet for me as written. (Even so, I drank the whole cup anyway!) So I made it using 2% milk and thinned it by adding just a little more than my 1 serving called for. I used Irish Cream because that's what I had, and it was delicious! This gives me a reason to look forward to winter!

Made this for my husband's teenage son (without the Frangelico) and just added a shot to mine.  I also used whole mik instead of half and half.  It tastes just like liquid Nutella...imagine that!  : )  I also added a splash of vanilla.  I would make again, but I think I'll have to add some dark chocolate or cocoa to mine as it 's just a bit too sweet for me.  Teenager loved it, so it's a keeper.  It's certainly easy!  Thanks for the recipe.

It's just tastes like Nutella, nothing big! And the picture is just great. It shows exactly how messy this is!

Very, very rich! I added a fourth of a cup of milk to my one serving.  By doing that it was more to my taste and the consistency was easier to drink.

Made this for my brother while baby sitting of course without the alcohol! Used 1cup of 2% milk and 5 tablespoons of Nutella for just one cup of it and also added to splashd of vanilla. He really liked it but I personally thought it was a little too sweet!

This was fabulous! I have even tried it without the liquor and was good as well with a few marshmallows for the kids. I know this is going to be a staple in this household!
