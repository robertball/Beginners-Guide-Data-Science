Interesting concept, but didn't work well at high altitude.  It probably took nearly an hour to get the filling to thicken - and then only after I added another teaspoon of cornstarch.  By the time it was thicker and I was filling the layers, it turned to granules as it cooled in the pan!  What a lumpy mess!  And, after burning my finger on the filling as it was spooned out of the pan, there was no way I was going to attempt making a 7-minute frosting - another potential "boiling" fiasco, too!  I used the Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting recipe from this website and it worked just fine.  At least it *looked* okay... The cake was actually very dry and crumbly.  Cutting it was another story - with the rock-hard "filling" in between the layers, it's nearly impossible to cut without a hammer and chisel.  However, it tastes okay.  Just definitely not worth 5 stars!
