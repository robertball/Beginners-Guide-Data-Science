I changed a few things in this recipe that I thought made it better.  They are: Used light brown sugar in place of the white sugar. Replaced the corn syrup with 1 tablespoon of molasses and 1 tablespoon of honey. Added 1/8 teaspoon of allspice and 1/8 teaspoon of cloves

It was my first time making pumpkin pie and for any first timers YES, the batter is very runny but don't worry it will work! Wish I knew this before hand cause I started to freak out a bit pouring the batter into the pie crusts. Best pumpkin pie flavor I have ever tasted :)

This recipe made a fabulously thick pumpkin pie.  It was a hit during Thanksgiving and I didn't have to change a thing.

Great recipe!  The recipe did not state whether it was a deep dish or regular 9" pie shell. I used a regular 9" and had a lot left over and my pie spilled over as I transferred it into the oven making a big mess as it spilled onto the cookie sheet and later burned filling my kitchen with smoke and setting off the smoke alarms!! I did substitute the white sugar with light brown and the light corn syrup with molasses as one of the other reviewers suggested. I added 1/4 teaspoon of allspice and ground cloves. The pie was delicious.  The pumpkin filling is indeed very thin and I wondered if it would thicken. It did beautifully. My baking time was exactly as the recipe called for. Don't forget to turn your oven down to 325 after 10 minutes, and cover the edges of the crust with foil. I forgot this step and my edges burned.  I learned a lot from baking my first homemade pumpkin pie in many years. I have enough fresh pumpkin frozen for 10 more pies. I'm sure the next one will be much improved.

I have never wrote a review before. This flavor/taste of this pie is fantastic. However the cooking time is completely off. I had to cook it for a total of 75 minutes.  I will definitely make this again! I hope my family enjoys it as well - Thanks for sharing

This recipe makes a fabulous pie.  I have made more than a few pumpkin pies but never one that tastes this good.  The only thing I changed was using brown sugar instead of white.  The taste and texture of this pie almost made me swoon and I can't stop picking at it.  Shoot, it hardly needs whip cream it is so good. 

I would like to offer a word of baking advice: it's a CUSTARD and as such the best test for doneness is, after an hour in the oven, I jiggle it. Just like I would a cheesecake or creme brulee.  It should be set around the outside and have a little jiggle in the middle.  If you bake it until it doesn't move, the pumpkin pie tastes dry and gets those really ugly cracks in the top.  It should be smooth, creamy and silky.

Great recipe.  I made it just the way it was written.  I did need to bake it almost twice the amount of time as stated.  I'm not sure why being that I'm not in a high altitude and have a fairly new oven.

The taste and ease of making this pie is outstanding.  But, the cooking time is off...way off.  It took 70 minutes and I had to treat it like a cheesecake by turning off the oven and leaving it in for another 20 min.  Due to the extra time, foil is needed for the crust, which is not needed in most pie recipes nor is it mentioned in this recipe.  Using a deep 9-inch pie shell, I wasted a lot of pie filling after filling it.  Again, this is a delicious recipe, it just needs to be revamped.  The next time I use this and double it, I'll use three regular-size pie shells to avoid wasting such wonderful filling.

Being a first-time pie maker, I was really surprised at how well this recipe came out! I was nervous at how runny it was when I poured it in my deep dish crust, but it came out wonderfully! It took me about an hour and a half to bake it all together, but I might have overcooked it a little. Good thing I tried it out today so I can get it spot on for Thanksgiving. I think I will try the foil over the crust next time and add a little bit more spices. Thanks for sharing!

I made this in a 9" Pillsbury frozen standard pie crust. There was way too much filling. I probably froze an amount equal to what was used. Next time, I am going to try a deep dish as the pie didn't seem that tall. I did 1/2 c white sugar & 1/4c brown sugar. My baking time was also longer (about 15-20 minutes)

Easy, delicious pumpkin pie.  I made a few small changes after reading the reviews here.  Used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar, doubled the cinnamon, and used 1 tbsp each honey and molasses instead of the corn syrup.  I used a deep dish pie pan and had no problems with excess filling or spills.  After turning the oven down to 325, I baked it for an hour.  It never tested "done" with a knife, but firmed up perfectly and had a very nice texture when served the next day.  Great pumpkin flavor, very smooth texture, and all around great reviews from family when served for Thanksgiving.

I made this at Thanksgiving and people who don't normally eat pumpkin pie ate it. I really needed to make more pies. I used a prepared deep dish pie crust. My oven is a wall oven so I didn't have problems with spilling but I could see if you had a regular oven it would be a dance to try and get it in the oven without spilling it. I use 1/4 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon as my changes. It really does need additional time for the second part of baking. I bake it 10 minutes for the first part and then 50 minutes for the second part. It comes out perfect.

Actually, think this might be my fave pumpkin pie recipe from this site.  I assembled it just as directed and used a deep dish pie crust.  I did have to bake the pie for about 15 minutes more than the called time.  Turned out perfectly!!!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this yesterday and it was amazing! It was the first pie I have ever made. I didn't have any corn syrup left so I used 1 tablespoon of molasses and 1 tablespoon of honey instead. I also added 1/8 teaspoon of allspice. I also used the store bought pie dough to save time. The batter was very runny like others said but it firmed up perfectly. And it took about 75 minutes total to cook. I covered the edges of the crust with tin foil and my crust came out perfectly browned! I'm definitely making this for Thanksgiving! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Absolutely LOVED this pie. have never really liked pumpkin pie or actually ate it..but this is my BF's fav kind of pie, so I tried this recipe and he said it was "orgasmic"..only thing I would do different next time is bake it a little longer, 10 minutes maybe or less..the middle was a little soft...but it was all eaten in 2 days!

This recipe worked out well for me, although I cheated and used apple pie spice for  the spices, and it cooked for an extra 30 minutes. 
To combat the spill problem most people have, I put the filling into a pitcher, then put the crust on a cookie sheet and onto the oven rack, and then poured the filling into the crust. No spillage! My family loves the flavor and now I make it every year.

AWESOME!!!  This was my first attempt at homemade pumpkin pie and it was a home run!  I did make the following changes: used 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/4 c white sugar, used 1.5 t pumpkin pie spice in place of the listed spices, used 1 T honey and 1 T molasses instead of the corn cyrup.  I had to bake it for 70 minutes on 325 instead of the listed 30.  The batter is VERY runny and I was worried, but it firmed up perfectly!  Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

It's far too watery going into the oven and, like many other reviewers, it takes FOREVER to cook. The recipe states that it should only take about 40 minutes, but I'd had mine in the oven for 1 hour, 15 minutes, and the middle has yet to set. The taste was passable, but I've had much better. :-(

It was an okay pumpkin pie but not as phenomenal as i thought it would be after reading the reviews.  I was able to fit it into my 9 inch pie pan no problem but it took FOREVER, almost 2 hours, to cook and it needed a little more flavor.  I've made other pumpkin pies before and have never needed that much time to bake.

This pie was delicious, and I was very proud of it especially because this was my first time making pumpkin pie! The only thing is that mine actually took more like an hour per pie to bake instead of the 30 min. as the recipe indicates. Perhaps its altitude or something of that nature...

Tastes good, however, too much filling for basic pie crust. I had to dump a whole bunch down the garbage disposal. Cooking time is not accurate. It took much longer than the suggested time. Maybe the temperature is recorded wrong? If foil prevents the crust from burning then it should be mentioned in the recipe to be included. Happy Cooking.

The recipe itself is very good. The measurements are a little off. I needed more Pumpkin Puree then the recipe called for, the mixture was at first very thin. I have made a lot of pies so I had to use my discretion. I didn't use ginger, I added Vanilla extract. The pie crust became a little burned because the pie was in longer than expect. When it comes to the cooking time I had to use my own personal judgement. I had my pie in for about 50-60 minutes. Either way the pie came out amazing and I would use the recipe again with the few minor changes

I've made it twice. Delicious but the cooking time was way off for me. At least 60 minutes at 325 and my oven tends to run hot.

The best pumpkin pie ever! This was my first attempt at making a pumpkin pie and I was floored at how easy and delicious it turned was. Wow. I used a premade crust from Whole Woods with no hydrogenated oils, covered the crust with foil for the last 15 minutes or so and the whole thing came out perfect. I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks!

I switched out the corn syrup for a tablespoon of molasses and a tablespoon of maple syrup and put in half dark brown sugar and half white sugar (what I had in the house).  I also added in a bit of extra cinnamon, 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves and 1/8 teaspoon allspice.  As others have noted, this recipe made way too much and I think I put too much into my pie dish.  This meant it took a REALLY long time to cook.  I had to keep checking on it and I even think it was overcooked a bit.  Next time, I won't fill up the pie so much.  However, everyone said it was delicious.  This recipe, or at least my adjustment of it, is not too sweet, which my guests enjoyed, but it would also be good with maybe a bit more sugar.  I also cut out a bit of pie crust with a snowflake cookie cutter and baked this on it's own small baking sheet.  I dusted it with powdered sugar and then placed it on the pie to make it extra special for our Christmas celebration!

This was awesome. I used a real pumpkin and just pureed it in the food processor. So easy. Then I used Pie Crust III, which made it even easier. I think I cooked it a little too long though. It was still really good!

So far, I've had to re-time my pie twice after the first 30 minutes, as the center has not set.  It's been about an hour since  put the sucker in and still hardly set.  The ingredients were listed out of order, so if you are one to go by ingredients alone, you're going to be SOL.  If I were to re-write the recipe, I'd say put the pan with the crust on a foil lined pan on the middle rack of your oven AND THEN pour in the filling.  This will prevent the mess I've read in other reviewers.  At this point, be sure to cover the entire pie with a length of foil, as the high sugar/butter content in the crust and filling will make this whole thing prone to burning.  As far as the baking time... That's still up in the air.  I don't know how everybody else got such "superb" results.

Thanks for sharing a recipe generations old!!! I did find that i had to leave it in the oven longer than the recommended time. Doubled up on the cinnamon because i didn't have all the spices and used cardamom as well. Didn't have evaporated milk but found that whole milk was fine, just added a little flour and corn syrup to ensure it wouldn't run by the time it was out of the oven. Delicious!

I swapped the light corn syrup and added molasses as one person suggested.  Very good though it darkens the filling a bit. If you have the servings set at 8, the recipe makes about 4 cups of filling. I find that this will fill a 9-inch tin pie plate without spilling over. Instead of filling the pie plate on the counter and trying to move it to the oven, place the pie plate in the oven and pour the filling into it. Be careful that you don't miss and pour into the oven. This works perfectly. As far as the spices, I've made this recipe a couple of times. The first time I substituted pumpkin pie spice for the three spices the recipe calls for. The second time I used the actual spices. Either way works for taste. Cooking time is definitely longer than the recipe calls for. Add about 20-25 minutes to the cooking time, checking periodically with a knife to see if the pie is set.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it tasted great except the baking time is really off!!  I ended up baking it for another 25 minutes, which I hadn't planned on, and it finally sent, but the flavor was good and will probably make it again.

Delicious recipe~ I replaced the corn syrup with molasses as suggested, and also did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  I had to cook it for double the time stated.  It is a perfect recipe, and will be my new stand by for sure!

An all around easy recipe to follow. I made the same modifications that Brandiren did, and I agree that they made it better. Making the triple recipe in two pies took about 60 minutes at the 325F step for two pies.

This is the first time I've ever made pumpkin pie and this recipe was amazing! I didn't change a thing as far as the ingredients. It was QUITE runny at first, so you have to be careful when you place it in the oven. Also, I had to bake it for an extra 40 minutes at the end. Other than that, it was fabulous. My husband loves it! :)

So delicious and much better than the Libby's can recipe!  I used  dark brown sugar in place of the white sugar, replaced the corn syrup with 1 tablespoon of molasses and 1 tablespoon of honey. Also added 1 T of whiskey and 1 t vanilla. Subbed about 1 and 1/2 t pumpkin pie spice instead of spices and threw in a sprinkling of dried orange peel. This is the bomb! Making it again tomorrow for Thanksgiving~

Pie is absolutely delicious! I did find that the cooking time is not quite right. After dropping the temperature to 325, I found the cooking time to be more around 50 minutes than 30. Next time I may try only dropping it down to 350.

Great recipe. Was a huge hit at Thanksgiving! Although I did double up all the spices.. As my family likes very flavorful/spicy food. Cooking time was WAY off like others mentioned.. Around 70 minutes in the oven overall. But a very solid recipe that I will use many times

My absolutely favorite pumpkin pie recipe!  I use it every year now! Like  everyone else has noted, cooking time needs to be doubled and cover your crust. I also think making your own  pumpkin puree makes a huge difference on flavor. This recipe has the potential to turn a pumpkin pie hater into a lover!

I thought this recipe really was great! It reminded me of my Grandmother's Pumpkin Pie! Each recipe makes 1 nine inch deep dish pie! I doubled it to make one and it filled up two crust all the way!

Cooking the pumpkin in the oven was genius!This was an easy scratch pie to make but I felt it lacked depth - try adding 50% more of each seasoning to give the pie a fuller flavor.

I used PP spice instead of the separate spices.
I have been making pumpkin a long time.  This is the best recipes that I have ever used.  I also used my home-grown pumpkin

Very good pie. I have always liked pumpkin pie and this is some of the best. This is going to be my contribution to the fourth of july party this year. It's going to be a hit, i just know it. Thank you for this excellent recipe.

I made this yesterday to be our christmas day dessert. It was my first time making any pie. It was very easy. I did not change anything and it came out GREAT. My family loved it and said it was the best pumpkin pie ever. I too made a big mess trying to pour it into the crust as it was very thin but that is one of the joy's of cookinh. Now I know for next time.

This was the first time for me to make a homemade pie & it was perfect!  Everyone loved it & I was even asked for the recipe. It made 2 deep dish pies (I used frozen & they were great). Please note, I did have to cook it longer than recommended.  I just did it in 10 minute intervals until the knife came out clean.

I love this pie! As everyone else stated it needed to bake longer than stated - after turning it down to 325 I baked it for 50 min, not 30. It does turn out to be more than you can use in one pie - but i doubled the recipe and made 2 pies for Thanksgiving and froze enough for 1 more pie (for Christmas)! Overall this was a great recipe and other than the baking time - I made no adjustments to the recipe.

This was my first pie experience.  I was a little nervous about how runny the batter was but it turned out great.  The cooking time was way off and the knife never actually came out clean.  After 60 minutes it started bubbling so I took it out and it seemed to set nice when cooling.  Tasted great!

Pumpkin pie is my favorite pie of all pies and this recipe is a keeper.  It does need a deep dish crust and definitely has to cook much longer than stated in the recipe.  After reducing the oven temperature, I have to cook it another hour.  Rather than testing doneness with a knife, I give the pie a little shake to make sure it is set.  The knife test leaves a gash in an otherwise beautiful pie.

The taste of this pumpkin pie was good but the cooking time was way off. I had to cook it an additional 90 minutes more than what is listed in the recipe. I thought it was strange that I had to keep coming back and it was still very wet. When I saw others in the review section commenting on the same issue I had I didn't feel bad. Because I followed this recipe to a T. I even kept reading the steps and measurements to make sure I did everything correct, which I did. This recipe really needs to be updated.

A true classic recipe for the most classic Thanksgiving dessert. We gathered everyone on the whole block for this year, including my good-for-nothing brother-in-law, James. Somehow, even he was enamored with the pie we made! Despite him marrying my sister WITHOUT the blessing of our parents, and not delivering on his promise to raise another beautiful family like ours, he had to give credit for how excellent this pie turned out. My one trick? MAKE THE PUMPKIN PURÉE FROM SCRATCH. Not to sound pretentious, but it’s better fresh from god’s green earth. James could get right learning a thing or two about the splendors of our earth...

Best pie ever. swapped brown sugar for white, but folllowed the rest. If you need help figuring out when it's done, use a meat thermometer. If its 175 mid way between center & edges, it's done.

Not a big fan of how this came out. I followed the directions as stated and the pie came out like soup. I had to bake for an extra 40 minutes and the texture still came out too watery. Won't be trying this recipe again!

if you make more then one at a time add at least 7 min. Depending on oven. My oven is a bit hotter then ones in the past. So keep an eye on it.

Delicious! I put pumkin pie spies and I notice I did not have to use as such sugar. I used 1 tsp. White Splendar and I spinkled 2 tsp. of Piloncillo cane brown sugar on top before putting it in the oven. 
Thank you for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe. As other reviews have pointed out, the cooking time is completely off.  It took about 75 minutes to bake but once it was done it was well worth the wait.  My family and friends thought it was delicious and one of the best pumpkin pies they had ever had.

Great recipe  Will definitely make again !  Like others have suggested, I cut  the pumpkin in quarters in the oven at 350° for about 45 minutes then mashed. I also added a quarter teaspoon of vanilla.

YUM. I made a couple of very minor changes: doubled the cinnamon,  used 1/3 brown sugar and 2/3 white, included 1/4 ts ground cloves with the other spices, covered the crusts with foil for all but the last ten minutes of baking, and added about 50-60 minutes to the bake time (at the lower temp). Yum, yum, yum.

Delicious! It needed about 10 more minutes in the oven for me, so make sure to check it with a knife or tooth pick before you take it out of the oven. A family favorite!

I am rating this 3 stars as recipe is written. To make it 5 stars, double the spices, and use brown sugar instead of white. Also, aluminum foil the edges of the crust and keep in the oven around 70 - 80 minutes, depending on your oven (just keep a really close eye on it).

I did not add the corn syrup, I made it more spicier and added just a little more ginger to give it that extra punch.

I decided to use this recipe instead of the one on the can of puree, which we always did before. The main reason was that I had some pure maple syrup and I wanted to use that instead of the corn syrup. That is the only change I made. I do agree with the other reviewer who said the bake time was off, mine took much longer, too, at least 60 minutes total. It was good, tasted just like my mom used to make.

Great recipe.  The directions say that the pie is done when a knife inserted into the pie comes out clean, but I think this is a mistake.  The pie comes out firm, but still somewhat liquidy.  As it cools, it sets up - a custard.

Husband loves pumpkin pie. Personally, pecan is my favorite. I was really worried during the process of mixing it up and baking as my consistency was very soupy (I've never made pumpkin pie before so that may have been what it was supposed to look like), but it came out great! Husband loved it and I thought it was pretty good myself.

My husband loves pumpkin pie. I have never made one so I gave this recipe a try. He LOVED it! He said it was as good or better than the one his mother always made but I am not supposed to mention that! I doubled the cinnamon. I am not a huge pumpkin pie fan but I had a piece and liked it. I will definitely make this recipe again!

I made it but it didn’t turn out right as to it was still somewhat soupy in the middle. Tasted good but wasn’t right. One thing I wouldn’t put in it is the flour. I talked to my grandmother and she said she doesn’t put flour in hers. I also talked to my aunt and she told me that she follows the recipe that’s on the can of the pumpkin puree

I followed this recipe to the letter twice. The first time, I got soup. Thought maybe it was me, so the second time I tried chilling it in the fridge for a day and a half. Went to cut it and it was still soup.

Highly disappointed.  The pie was soupy and I follow the instructions to a tee!    Trying to salvage it by cooking  it at 350 degrees for a longer period of time.  I just hope I don't have to trash the two pies I made using this receipe.  Family reunion tomorrow.  Doing a baked mac and cheese backup.

Wonderful pumpkin custard!  Just what I wanted.  I followed review comments and used 1/2c dark brown sugar and 1/4c granulated sugar and 2TBSP honey and no corn syrup.  If you don't like pies too sweet, you could use just 1/2c sugar. Everyone loved it.  It is now my go to pumpkin pie recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!

Everything was spot on with this recipe as far as taste, except the time frame. I had all ingredients on hand, so no store shopping! As everyone stated in their reviews it does take about 70 min+ to bake this pie, but it's worth it! I did have to use two 9 in. deep dish pre-made shells, it was just too much for the one shell. I gave four stars due to timing.

I’ve used this recipe for a few years now and my pies ti n out excellent every time! I bake like 10 of these every Thanksgiving for all my relatives and coworkers. I haven’t changed anything in the recipe but I do have to bake it about an hour total. Maybe next time I’ll try substituting sugar and corn syrup ;) thanks you this awesome recipe! Definitely staying in my recipe box forever!

Excellent taste! As others have stated, the cook time is way off. Mine were in the oven about 1.5 hrs. Also, I doubled the recipe and ended up having to toss some filling. Probably could have made 3 pies out of it.

I took the advice of another reviewer and swapped the corn syrup with a tablespoon of molasses and one of honey.  Really added a great flavor to the pie.

Our 6 yr old daughter has been wanting to make a pumpkin pie every since her school's field trip to a local pumpkin patch/farm. Needless to say, it wasn't big enough for us to use her pumpkin so we used some canned store bought pumpkin. Considering this was our first attempt, I must say it was absolutely delicious as we're usually a sweet potato pie family but with a few adjustments to taste, it came out fan-tas-tic!!!!!

I just made this recipe and I'm sorry to say I didn't care for the flavor at all. I even added 1/2 tsp of extra cinnamon like others suggested. I did used a deep dish pie shell from Pillsbury and it baked up nicely but just don't care for the flavor. Gonna keep looking for a recipe I can love. Sorry.

Yes, yes, yes. Don’t change a thing. This is seriously the best pumpkin pie out there. I never review things, but this is worth reviewing because it’s more like a 10 star recipe!!! I use homemade pumpkin purée... buy a pie pumpkin, cut it in half, scoop out the seeds, and bake it cut side down for about 45 minutes or until fork tender. Simply scoop the pumpkin out and chill it before using, so it doesn’t cook the egg in your recipe. It gives it a flavor that is completely unmatched; almost like a honey-sweetness instead of a sugar sweetness. I’ve made this for several years and everyone always loves it!!!

I made this according to directions, but used a cheesecake pan for some extra depth. I cooked for the suggested time, but the crust underneath was not done enough. Maybe because of the pan I used? I did not like the fact that the recipe makes too much filling for a normal sized pie, but not enough for two pies. If I make this again,  I might add less milk to reduce waste. The flavor of the pie was ok, but the overall result was disappointing.

This is now my go to recipe for pumpkin pie. It is creamy and has a great flavor.   However, at 325 the pie was still not done after 55 minutes.  I turned the oven up to 350 and it only took 10 minutes to finish baking.  I will bake it at 350 the next time.

Only four stars because it was the first homemade pie we have ever made. It was delicious, but we didn't have anything to compare it to. The recipe made more than enough filling for one pie, so we split it between two small 9" crusts. Our two pies were a tad bit skimpy, but not enough to complain about.  May have worked better with one deep crust.

I thought this pie was VERY VERY good.  BUT the timing is waaaaaaaaaaay  waaaaaaaaaaaaay off on this recipe!!!  it took over an hour to bake the two pies.  it was so runny when using the time stated in the recipe.  so if you make this, don't be in any rush.  the flavor is VERY good.  i used dark brown sugar instead of white.  that was my only change...i ALWAYS make pumpkin pies with brown sugar.  and i added like a little more than 1/4 tsp of ground cloves.  i like a little clove flavor, so i always add that too.  got lots of compliments on at thanksgiving dinner yesterday.

This pie is AMAZING!!! A few notes: I've made it several times and I've only ever made it using an actual pie pumpkin. It's worth your time!!! Just cut the pie pumpkin in half, scoop out the seeds, then bake face-down at 350° for 45 minutes or until the pumpkin is fork-tender. It is so so so so good. Also: the cooking time is much longer than the recipe states, so don't freak out when it's still completely runny after 40 minutes  it takes more like 2 hours or so. Everything else is PERFECT!!

This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever tasted. It is delicious! Like other reviewers, I substituted the corn syrup for 1 Tbp molasses and 1 Tbs honey, used light brown sugar instead of white, and because I was out of ground ginger, I used fresh grated ginger instead. It was divine. It did take about 30 extra minutes until I felt it was done enough to take out of the oven. And next time I will definitely place the pie pans on the oven rack and use a pitcher to pour the filling in! It is crazy hard to put in the over without spilling. But it's all so worth it!!!

I made this for Christmas dinner, it was delicious!! I subbed the spices for 1 Tbs pumpkin spice and it was perfect! The sweetened condensed milk adds the perfect amount of sweetness- no need to add sugar or any sweetener! Loved this recipe.

the pie came out great - high and even.   I used 2 eggs instead of one and brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Other than that, I used what the recipe said.  It came out delicious.  thick and creamy and not too pumpkiny.   I baked it until when a knife inserted came out clean.  It was perfect.

Awesome pie!!! Perfect as is. No need to change anything except the cooking time, for a total of probably 75 minutes. But it is truly worth the wait. I didn't have to cover the crust and it will fill a deep dish pie crust.

Someone else suggested pouring the liquid in the pie shell with the shell in the oven. Great idea. I gave this 3 stars cause the spices weren't enough. Will try again but with cloves and maybe allspice along with the ones in this recipe.

This is a great recipe! I didn't change anything like some readers suggest, but the cooking time in the recipe is way off. This pie needs at least 30-45 minutes longer in the oven, This is the only reason I  gave it 4, and not 5 stars.

I haven't cut into this pie yet as I made it for Thanksgiving tomorrow. However, I just wanted to give everyone a heads up. The cooking time is way off. Once the oven temp is down to 325 it took an hour to finish baking and I had to put foil around the edges so my crust didn't burn. Also, use a deep dish pie crust or 2 regular pie crusts. This makes a lot of filling. Make sure you also use a cookie sheet to bake the pie on so you don't have spillage in your oven.

Doubling the recipe filled two deep-dish 9-inch pie crusts.  Very good flavor and texture.  Baking time was closer to one hour.

I'd never made a pumpkin pie with Karo syrup in it...and I still can't decide if I like it better with or without.  The syrup definitely makes for a smoother consistency...but it also makes it a little sweeter; which I realized I could remedy by adding less regular sugar to the recipe.  By doing that, I think I would use this as my standard pumpkin pie recipe.  Everyone else who tasted it, loved it.

This made more than would fit in a standard pie crust.  I poured the excess in a small tart pan, no crust and made an extra crustless pie. Cooking time also was a little more than indicated but  not excessve.

Unbelievable, DO NOT change an ingredient.  Perfect texture and taste. Yes, cooking time should be increased to 65 minutes after setting oven temp to 325.  That aside, This IS the new standard for pumpkin pie in our home.  Thank You for the receipe!

I wonder...  Do those who think they changed a few things when stating: "Instead of white sugar and molassas, I used brown sugar." know that they "REALLY DIDN'T." Regardless, I did not use corn syrup because I didn't have any (I will the next time) despite the fact,  This pie turned out pretty good.  Will definately use this recipe again but WITH corn syrup to see if I missed out on the "secret"

Very good although I didn't had corn syrup.  I prefere  this recipe to the ones made with Eagle Brand milk, which I find to sweet.

I made this in a deep dish crust and it made a good pie. I prebaked the crust about ten minutes so it wouldn't be mushy on bottom and that worked well. The pie itself was good but not the best I've ever made. I might try it again with a few tweaks to the recipe.

Last year we had a great pumpkin harvest, so I looked for recipes to use them.  We have made this pie 6 or 7 times since then, and every time it has been perfect.  Haven't made any changes - it's perfect as it is!

Fantastic recipe. As one taster said, "You don't know what you're missing." Cooking time is crazy off, especially if you triple the recipe as suggested: bake 10 minutes on 450 as written, then allow almost 45 minutes for baking on 325. Sturdy (but not thick!) crust a necessity. Yum!

I tried this recipe last year & my family loved it,
this year I made it for Halloween then decided to use the same recipe for sweet potato pie & everybody loved it. it is definitely the most delicious & at the same time lightest pumpkin pie recipe. I saved it to my email as there are 100s of other recipes on this site. This is definitely the best & I will keep making it. as for he baking time: you don't have to dry it out you can just let it "settle", but this is a personal preference.

I will definitely make it again. I give it 4 stars only because it was very good but not super-fantastic-amazing.  I followed the recipe as is and had enough to fill two frozen pie crusts. I was afraid that they would overflow based on other reviews and used deep dish crusts but those proved to be too much volume.  I think that the recipe as written would fill two regular pie crusts nicely.  I ended up tacking on an ADDITIONAL 40 minutes onto the directions (we don't live in an elevated area) -- no big deal, just a heads up. Overall, a nice treat.

I made this recipe with an Oreo pie crust and topped it with whipped cream and Oreo crumbles. It was TO DIE FOR and my friends finished it in about 10 minutes at our potluck dinner! Even before Turkey seconds...

I never made pumpkin pie before and it turned out wonderful!  By mistake I added too much nutmeg and cinnamon (double what it called for) and decided on my own to add some allspice...but it was really really good!!  I was worried at first because the batter was so runny, and the time to cook it was so short.  I put it in the oven expecting it to take much longer than 30 minutes, but to my amazement it set wonderfully and was ready just as the recipe said!!

This was my first pumpkin pie-a few mistakes but I think it turned out the way it's supposed to. I used cardamom instead of nutmeg and it was TASTY! Also, i forgot to put the egg in until the end so im not sure how that affected it.  It was very very runny batter - im not sure if that's right or not, it also took a bit longer to cook than recipe says. it took about 55 minutes total.

My first attempt at this pie. I doubled the recipe, with the exception of the condensed milk. Yes, the cooking time was off - 60 minutes total for me. Fantastic taste and presentation.

Like other reviewers said, I had to increase the baking time by @ 20-25 minutes.  Other than that, the pie was delicious!  I used fresh pumpkin, very nice flavor, good balance of spices for my family.  I'll make this again for sure.

Awesome pie! Wow this was good!  This was my first time baking a pumpkin pie (we usually do store bought) and it was so easy! I did get some pre-made pie crusts (two deep dish) and split the filling between them...which didn't make the filling go all the way to the top but it can feed more people now. I didn't need to tweak the recipe or anything. Absolutely wonderful!

I won't give this less than a three because everyone seems to like this but I can't see any reason why it made such a top of the list. I followed these directions to a T and had to cook this for almost two hours and it came out looking like a bad pumpkin custard.

Very tasty, but too runny in the center. Even after I gave it 24 hours, the center was a runny mess. I think I'd try a little more flour or a little less evaporated milk next time.
