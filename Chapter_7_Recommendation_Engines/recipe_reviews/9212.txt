I really DID enjoy the flavor of this recipe. My hubby was helping me prepare some of the vegetables and failed to get the onions small enough, so that when we tasted the casserole they were still not soft and a bit too crunchy.  In the future, I may saut√© the onions to make them softer.  I also used 1/3 fat cream cheese and noticed no difference between the regular and the less fat taste.  I also ran out of regular yellow squash and threw in some butternut squash.  BUT it still tasted yummy.  Apparently one yellow squash only makes about one cup of cooked squash.  Hope you will enjoy it! Carole Cummings...in Plano, Texas

I tried this recipe for guests since it had consistently been 5-star rated.  I'll admit I'm not the best cook but I usually don't fail this badly on a recipe.  First, I was confused on the amount of squash to use.  I had about 9 cups uncooked and it cooked down to about 6 1/2.  Maybe that was my problem.  I also chopped my carrot and onion in a food processor so maybe it was too finely chopped.  Beyond this, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was way too watery so I baked for 15 more minutes.  Still mushy and too late to serve with dinner. I didn't think it tasted very good and the stuffing mix on top was too hard and crunchy.  I don't know how I could have messed this up so badly but could use some advice.  Also, would suggest better detail on the recipe, particularly on the quantity of squash and how to cook it.  I blanched mine.  And was I supposed to do something to prepare the stuffing mix prior to sprinkling it on top?  I can't imagine that it was supposed to be as hard as little rocks!  Sorry to spoil the excellent ratings, but this sure didn't work for me!

This was AWESOME!  I didn't change a thing.  I had SEVERAL people ask me for the recipe.

Tip:  I didn't know how much squash equalled 8 cups... it seems it's about 2.5 pounds.

This was a nice change to my usual squash casserole. I was a bit nervous with this combination of ingredients and squash but the flavor was wonderful. I thought it was going to be runny before I baked it but it turned out just right after cooking. I did have to add a little salt but my family really likes salt so that probably had something to do with it. Thanks for sharing this Robin

This was excellent, colorful, tasty and easy to make.  I did freak out about the butter content, but I added it all anyways and it was just fabulous.  I was having a dinner meeting party for my equestrian club so I wanted varitey.  The most requested recipie from everyone was this one.  They said that it was just different and so very delicious.  Now I do tend to like my foods more creamier.  Next time I may use a small egg instead of a large egg.  I also cooked the squash to where I could just pierce it with a fork, not mushy before adding to the mixture and cooking.  I thin I did add extra cream cheese because I love it.  Thanks for a great recipie.

With many recipes that call for stuffing topping, it works better to add that ingredient about half-way through the oven baking part. The topping doesn't need to "cook" and I've found it will sometimes get too hard/brown otherwise.

Have just prepared ingredients for baking - remains to be seen how it tastes.  HOWEVER, listing the squash ingredient as 8 cups COOKED squash is not helpful, especially to someone who is not all that expert in the kitchen!  I cooked about 12 cups uncooked squash to get ALMOST 8 cups cooked squash.  Revise recipe!

Very good. Good flavoring. I sliced carrots and cooked them with the squash instead of grating them.

So good!  I didn't have enough squash, so I used about half squash and half ROMA TOMATOES.  It was a great idea!  Instead of the soup, I made my own "soup" from butter, flour, chicken broth, and milk.  Great recipe!

My family, including the kids, loved this recipe. It's a much lighter consistency than the usual squash casserole recipe that has the cheddar cheese base.  If you don't use salt when you cook the squash, make sure you add a little to the mix.  It sets best after the casserole has cooled a little.

Very, very tasty. Simple to make. I would say 45 minutes to cook though. Will make again often!

This recipe is awsome.  The cream cheese really makes a difference.  I served this at a Thanksgiving gathering and EVERYONE love it. They remarked it was "off the chain"  This recipe is superb!

This was just too rich for us - the flavor was good, but a little scoop went way too far.

I made this for Thanksgiving after I read the reviews.  I was so disappointed. This tasted like a dish that you would get at a cafeteria or an old folks home.   I made it for 7 people and they all rated it a 4 out of 10.

It was good but not great.  Was a little too creamy for our taste.  Not sure I will make again.

I have made this recipe twice in the last two weeks and my family loves it.  The only thing I do differently is saute the onions and carrots first so that they aren't too crunchy, and I sprinkle water over the stuffing on top so it is not too crunchy as well.  Other than that I stuck to it.  You could even use zucchini or any type of squash in place of the yellow, and you could use different soups for something different.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it gave me a good way to use up my garden squash.

Very delicious.  Make sure you have enough for seconds.  I have also gotten accustomed to the request for the recipe.
