Absolutely delicious! I made half the recipe using Roma tomatoes, thinly sliced.  I mixed the basil with the Parmesan cheese then topped the tomato with the mixture. I broiled them in my Wolfgang Puck Pressure Oven for 90 seconds.  I didn't share, I made a meal out of them and ate them all!!

Everyone liked these. I used a little cheese between each layer to stick the ingredients together. Instead of just broiling, I turned oven on to 180-190 F(melting point for parmesan cheese) and kept them in oven until the cheese started to melt, then broiled quickly to finish them. I made them the day before the party and refrigerated them. Served cold/room temperature.

This was super easy and a quick appetizer (although I made it as a snack for myself!)  I was able to use fresh basil from my garden, which is great too.  I agree with Staci - watch these as they will burn easily.  Overall super easy and pretty - things I'm always looking for in my food :)

Delicious! Be very careful watching these as the Pretzel Crisps can burn easily.
