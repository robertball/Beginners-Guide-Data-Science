This was a big hit.  I added snap peas and substituted the water for chicken broth.

Wonderful soup. I was amazing at the amount flavor, but not at all overpowering. My family and I loved it!!! Even my mother, whose isn't a big fan of fresh ginger. I served it with eggrolls and a simple vegitable stirfry. I will most certainly make this soup again.

Excellent recipe after 'tweaking' a bit - instead of water, I used Asian soy ginger broth which I believe added a needed kick, and low fat coconut milk.  This is not a spicy Thai soup, but still is very flavorful and super easy.  Will definitely make again.

This is something I would make again.  I think it would compliment any Asian dinner.  I subbed chicken broth for the water, but I think it may have taken away from some of the coconut flavor.  I also left out the fish sauce as I don't like fish sauce. Next time I will also dice the chicken because long strips were hard to eat in a soup. Other than that I think the recipe is great.

I am on a soup kick - my guy really liked this one - he swears he feels like a teen-ager the next day after eating something with ginger in it.  Whatever!??!  This was super easy to make and just tastes better and better as it gets oldler.  Will keep this one.  Didn't change anything.  Thanks submitter.

We love this soup!  I've made it twice now and it was perfect each time.  I followed the advice of the other reviewers and substituted chicken broth for the water and added some fresh garlic.  Delicious!

Don't do anything to this recipe... it's fantastic! We are going to make it at least once every couple weeks! This is not a spicy soup... the ginger does not make it spicy so if that's what you are looking for you will have to add extra spice.

We loved this.  Fixed it using chicken broth instead of water otherwise no changes.  Next time I'm thinking I will try this with cod.

Delicious! I sauteed broccoli with a small shallot in some coconut oil and added it to the soup while the broccoli was still somewhat crunchy; I find the broccoli gets too mushy when cooked with the rest of the ingredients in the soup.

This "Thai Ginger Soup" is my new "go to" recipe for cold and flu season: it has coconut milk (with the immune-system boosting properties of medium-chain triglycerides); lime juice (rich in vitamin C for fighting infections); and loads of ginger (a traditional medicine). On top of that, it tastes great! I made mine with homemade chicken stock instead of water, and the combination of coconut milk, chicken stock, and ginger tasted excellent on its own without further embellishment, although I did especially like the green-onion garnish on top. It is something to keep in mind if you live in a rural community (like I did while growing up) without access to ingredients like fish sauce, fresh lime juice, and cilantro. Thank you TORIHAWK for sharing your recipe.

Simple and delicious. Can add diced carrots, mushrooms and baby corn for extra textures, and a very small Thai pepper for heat.

This soup was easy to make and just OK.  My husband and I agree it doesn't rate a 4-5 star rating.  Something seems to be missing even though using other rater's suggestions I used chicken broth instead of water, added water chestnuts and snow peas.  Wouldn't go out of my way to make this again.

Very tasty, though we modified it some.  Used veggie broth instead of water, salad shrimp instead of chicken, the entire bunch of green onions (white & light green parts only), more cilantro, and we added snow peas.

Wow - this is fantastic!  I added sliced mushrooms, sliced bell pepper, and a minced red chili to the soup to give it a little more substance.  Definitely a keeper.

Quick and Delicious!  I have a very authentic recipe for Tom Kar Gai soup that I usually make, but since I didn't have time to go to the asian market, and didn't have galanga, kifir lime leaves, or lemon grass on hand, I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  Well this recipe exceeded my expectations.  It was almost as good as the real thing!  I added sliced carrots and straw mushrooms and it was a huge hit.  I will definitely make this one again.

I think this is a good base to a recipe but needs some flavor.  As some of the other reviews did, I also used chicken broth instead of water.  I also added water chestnuts, cilantro and thai chilis for some heat.

Delicious and quick soup to make. Didn't add fish sauce b/c never have on hand. Had leftover coconut milk from another Thai recipe and worked great when I halved the recipe to make 2 servings.  I already had diced cooked chicken, which was a time saver.

Mmm...  I doubled the recipe, omitted the chicken breast and used a bag of Trader Joe's Chicken Potstickers instead and added 2 tbsp of red curry paste because my hubby and I like some heat.  Sooo tasty!

This was soup was very delicious! The only change I made was using chicken stock instead of water. This soup was full of flavor to me and one I'll make again for just me, especially if feeling under the weather. Thank you for this easy and delicious recipe!

If you put a bit sugar in it, it’d be better cause you’ll get a sour but a little salty soup with a sweet taste!

Light fresh tasting appetizer soup, I used some leftover roasted chicken so it was super easy! Added a bit bit more fish sauce and a touch of red rooster chili garlic sauce for heat.......as you sip the flavors become more complex, so as you reach the end you are very satisfied but not full and ready for the next course.....Lovely

WOW!!! this recipe exceeded my expectations!!! so easy, so fresh, this is my new FAVORITE soup.  I used the chicken broth instead of water as others suggested.  Everything else the same!!! So thankful I came upon this one :) You will not be dissapointed!

absolutely delightful and very easy to make! I would recommend marinating the chicken in coconut milk for at least an hour before cooking, and definitely add noodles. They're just delectable with the broth!

I would give this 4.5 stars if I could.  It was really good.. ALMOST as good as my fav thai restaurant.  I probably added 4x the amount of green onions and I in tofu instead of chicken to make it vegetarian.  oh my god it was yummy.

I found this soup to be quite bland.  I tried adding red chiles and extra fish sauce to spice it up, when that didn't work I threw in heaps of garlic and fresh basil--still didn't have much flavor.  I also added onions to the vegetable stip stage.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I wouldn't recommend this recipe as is.

Really excellent!  I even messed up and used an extra cup of water by mistake, and it was still wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!
