I make a similiar version to this. I use more cranberries and add slivered almonds and chopped onion. I don't use any dill at all. Makes a tuna sandwich a more interesting.

Really good!  A nice change from regular tuna sandwiches.  I don't care for dill weed, so I just left it out.

I love tuna salad for lunch and when I came across this recipe it sounded different so I thought I'd give it a try. I used only one 6 oz. can of tuna with 2 Tbsp. of Hellman's light mayo and curry powder vs. dried dill weed. I added some chopped celery for some crunch and a little salt and pepper. This was a a nice departure from my usual tuna salad - slightly sweet and great on lightly toasted whole grain bread!

Great twist on an old recipe.  The tuna, of course, is soft and I knew my family wouldn't like it that way so I added about 2 T. sliced almonds and omitted the dill.  Great lunch box addition for my husband and the kids. Instead of the same old, same old carrots or celery, the cranberries add an unexpected twist.  My husband called me from work to tell me that he LOVED the tuna -- thank you for getting my husband to eat his lunch!

This is one of my all-time favs from this site! I craved this sandwich when I was preggers with my boys! I would put chips in the sandwich for the salt content. I love the sweet/salty combo, and I always add extra dill! I stock dried cranberries and tuna in my pantry just to make this. Thanks for the great tuna salad recipe!

This is quite tasty, and a nice change from the regular tuna sandwich. I like the dill and the cranberries together. I put mine on some crispbread, with some dill pickle relish and topped with a bit of grated cheddar.

I made this for lunch today and while it was very tasty, I think that I'll make it differently next time by adding more cranberries and perhaps something crunchy like almonds, pecans, or walnuts.

Had a change of plans for supper...had a pork tenderloin out but the dogs decided they would like it for supper more than we would.  I needed something fast (nothing defrosted) and thought this would do the trick.  I loved the cranberries mixed in.  I actually added 1 more tbsp. of lite mayonnaise (preference) and added more cranberries to the tuna mixture.  Thanks

Very tastey, but for more of a kick I added some dijon mustard.  Very yummy and a nice change from the regular tuna sandwhich.

I really liked the dried cranberries in my tuna sandwich, however, next time I'll do without the dill flavor.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I read all the reviews and decided I wanted to try the recipe with slivered almonds for crunch factor. Wasn't sure whether I would include the dill or not... long cooking story short -- I ended using everything it called for and then some! Doubled, maybe even tripled the cranberries, a generous dose of dill and salt -- lots of almonds -- and when even then it seemed a little ho-hum, I added some minced onions like another reviewer suggested. Now, THAT is what I am talking about! Much more like you might eat at a restaurant or something. I served it on croissants, though I think it would be good on toasted wheat or anything, really. A good start of a recipe, but much yummier with more flavor...Thanks for sharing, though!

Once you have cranberries with tuna you'll never eat tuna alone again. We love these as wraps or toasted bread.

I made this for my kids' school lunch, although the first batch was so good I ate it myself, and had to make a second for their lunch! My kids LOVED it in their school lunch. We ate ours with saltine crackers... delicious!!!

Very delicious~! It's a nice change from how I usually eat tuna, sweet instead of tart. I used all the ingredients as directed, but I added the mayonnaise according to taste. I found that the original 2T was just too dry for me. I also added about 2T of sliced and chopped almonds, and roughly 2T of freshly chopped apple. I ate it on toasted whole wheat bread with Laughing Cow Spreadable Low Fat Creamy Swiss Cheese spread on it, and it was delicious!

I was getting sick of the same old tuna and celery salad and thought I would give this a try. Very good! I did add more cranberries. And also added celery bc it definitely (to me) needs a crunch. Though I would like to try it with almonds like other reviewers suggested. Def. will make again!

Nice basic recipe and easy on the budget. After making and eating it both myself and my husband thought it needs a little more mayo next time. Also 2 cans barely made their 3 sandwiches so next time we will use more turn and mayo.

I did an ingredient search to find out if this recipe had already been entered. If it hadn't, I was prepared to submit it. This is one tuna salad recipe that everyone should try. A friend passed it along to me and I love it. I do add 1 full teaspoon of dill weed, simply because I love the dill flavor. I also use no-fat or low-fat mayo or Miracle Whip to reduce the calorie and fat counts. I look forward to trying some of the embellishments, such as nuts, that other reviewers have suggested. I first learned about this recipe a couple of weeks ago and have already prepared it three times.

I really enjoy this recipe. It has just the right amount of mayonnaise (ie, not that much) and a slightly sweet taste. It's perfect for a picnic or hot summer day at home.

I think this is a great base for this style tuna salad, I only gave four stars due to my alterations in the recipe. I omitted the dill weed, added half an apple chopped, half a stalk of celery chopped. The tuna brand DOES matter, I had done my first batch with Starkist Albacore in water and the next time used Bumble Bee.. all were happier with the Starkist.. was more chunky as oppossed to the fine texture of Bumble Bee. Use a good Mulitgrain bread and toast it with some crisp Romaine and wala! My hubby even likes this!

I was a little hesitant but VERY curious about this recipe as I wanted something different for lunch. I was pleasantly surprised and had half of it gone before I knew it. Yum! You can of course adjust the mayo or use Miracle Whip like I did because that is what I had. Wonderful combination of flavors! I've found a great lunch idea for work that has lots less fat than traditional tuna salads.

I made it as written and ate  4s in a single meal. It was quick and good, but also a bit dry and bland. Next time I would add a little more mayo and probably try some of the other reviewers' additions, such as curry, onion or celery.

I would NEVER think to out cranberries in a tuna salad.  It tastes so good! I didn't have dill weed so I used chopped dill pickle.  I added slivered almonds for crunch.  I don't think I will ever eat plain Jane tuna salad ever again.

Made as directed and liked it. Then decided to make changes to suit my taste - felt it needed more mayo; however, since I do not care for low fat mayonnaise and did not want to increase the regular mayonnaise,  I added a dollop of Greek yogurt. In addition, I added chopped celery. May try with slivered almonds in the future.  I also increased the dill to suit my taste buds. Since I watch my carb intake, serving  on a bed of lettuce is a good option.

Pretty good. More mayo the better. A bit of spicy mustard adds flavor. The cranberries give it that perfect sweetness and a nice added texture. Leave out the dill unless you really like dill. Added some sliced almonds for an extra crunch- good but not necessary. Great on a toasted English muffin.

This is a really nice twist on tuna salad.  Our family must eat gluten free (no wheat) so we ate it with "scoops" corn chips and the salt & sweet combo was really nice.

Wow, this is yummy!  I just made it for lunch with whole wheat toast.  I used light mayo and added one stalk of celery and 2 T sliced almonds.  I couldn't detect the light mayo at all (I was worried it would affect the taste) with all those other good flavors.  It was nice that the recipe didn't call for too much mayo to begin with.  I used the dill and meant to add onion, too - maybe next time.  Bottom line: I think the recipe is good as-is OR dressed up.  Thanks for my new tuna salad recipe!

The ingrediants make this a 5 star recipe but I disagree with the amounts.  It's good as is but not as good as it could be.  I added a lot more mayo about 1/2 cup cranberries and I would add more dill next time.  Although I was using freeze dried which may not be as strong flavored as fresh or dried.  With my changes it was gone before that day was out.

My youngest two love plain tuna salad but I wanted to shake things up a bit so when I told them that I was  making tuna salad they started to pulll out ingrediants when I told them that I didn't need certain items my three year old said "No eggs and cery (celery) I no eat" and my five year old insisted on onion in it, so I added three hard boiled eggs, 1 very small onion and 1 stalk of celery chopped, and another tablespoon of Miracle Whip we don't use mayonaisse. It was great, my 13 year old refuses to eat tuna or anythhing with cranberries in it, there was 1/2 day of school today so we were about done eating lunch when they came home and she was "Starving" because it was tuna sandwiches today at school, I had 1 sandwich left on my [late and she asked if she could have a bite  before I could tell her what it was she had grabbed it and wolfed down the sandwich even though she isn't fond of wheat bread when I asked her what she thought she said it was great even though it was on wheat bread and wanted to know what it was. She was surprised when I told her that her two least favorite foods were in it. Thank you for this recipe now I can make tuna salad sandwiches for all of my kids without my 13 year old having to eat something else.

I thought this was really good! I used dried tart cherries instead of cranberries because I just happened to have them and I added about 1/3 cup of diced yellow onion. Tasted wonderful!

Yummy! I love the dill and the cranberries.  I added a little more dill, a little more mayo, chopped celery, sliced almonds, and sweet relish.  I told my husband I was making a tuna salad for sandwiches.  He was pleasantly surprised when he saw that it was not the old boring tuna and mayo version.  This is the way I will make tuna salad from now on!

Yummy, I've even tried adding grapes thanks to my adopted Momma who I I've known for 60 plus years.  She just halves them and adds them to both her chicken and tuna salad it is yummy.  Of Course She's been consistently cooking for an Awesome Italian family For many years and everything thing she does is "The Best"

This tuna salad is amazing on those Hawaiian dinner rolls.  Added some chopped celery for added crunch.  Skipped the dill because I am not a fan of dill.  Made a whole tray of these for a pot luck and there was not one left!

This turned out good, but I knew it would be too bland for us as written. However, it was a good base. I used dried cilantro instead of dill and, as suggested by another reviewer, used some curry powder. I added probably another tablespoon of cranberries and some red onion.

Excellent! I used light mayo and dill relish instead of dill weed. I was able to put less mayo in because the relish helped keep it moist.

When I saw this recipe, I thought as a tuna salad lover, I had to try it! Well, it's amazing. I had to add double the mayo so it wasn't too dry. I also left it in the fridge for a few hours so the cranberries really had a chance to blend in. Other reviewers felt it needed texture, just a little bit of lettuce was more than enough. Can't say how much I love this!

I absolutely love this recipe.  It has such a good flavor.  I used it an hors d'oeuvre with crackers for a party and it was a HUGE hit.  I used the left overs in a salad and it was phenomenal.

I love this recipe.  I actually looked for it after I purchased something similar from a local store's deli.  I added more dill than this recipe called for and added one finely chopped shallot.  I think shallot or a mild white onion adds a nice kick to it!  My favorite way to eat this tuna salad is "tuna melt" style with a slice of Jarlsberg cheese on whole grain bread.  Yum, yum.

I usually find tuna salad incredibly bland so I was intrigued by this recipe.  I would never have thought to put cranberries with tuna, but it's great!  Like other reviewers, I chose to throw in some sliced almonds, and I stuffed it into pita pockets between 2 leaves of lettuce.  It made tuna salad seem like something special.

The cranberries add pizzazz and turn an ordinary tuna sandwich into something special.  Such a simple thing and makes a big difference. Have made this several times.

Awesome!  My husband loves this in his lunch.  A different take on the traditional tuna-salad sandwich, and definitely worth a try to anyone who is even just slightly curious.  You'll like it!  I usually add celery for a little but of crunch.

I love it (and I'm not a big fan of tuna)!  Great combination of flavors - don't omit the dill weed until you try it!  It's great!

This was a really great way to prepare the same old tuna fish sandwich. The dried cranberries added a sweet and salty taste. I omitted the dill and used rye bread. I also added almonds, which added a necessary crunch.

This is wonderful!! I did not use dried dill weed though. I squeezed the juice out of half a lemon and mixed it with tuna, safflower mayo and cranberries and topped it with lettuce on some wheat bread. Now I will always have cranberries stocked so I can make these sandwiches.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

This was tasty but failed to 'wow' me. The dill flavour was nice and the cranberries added a sweetness to the sandwich but I don't think that tuna requires a sweet flavour with it. I used less mayo as I prefer my tuna a litte more dry. I think I will try this with chopped turkey or chicken rather than tuna.

My husband and I split a tuna sandwich sometimes for lunch so I only use half the recipe, we really like it but haven't yet tried it with dill, sounds good though!

Couldn't find our dill weed so used dill relish instead. Didn't follow actual amounts, but used all ingredients minus the salt and it was a yummy lunch!

I omit the dill and added ginger. Definitely impressed hubby when I used rye bread and romaine lettuce in a sandwich.

I liked this tuna. I did put chips on mine, like another reviewer, which I do all the time anyway. But the chips gave it a little something extra. I think next time I will add some onion. A keeper!

This is very tasty and a great idea. However, there seems to be too little of everything in the recipe. I think it needs double the mayo and double the dill. I didn't need the salt, but I think it could deal with a squeeze of lemon juice for extra flavour. This recipe has great potential and is a super fast fix for dinner after a long day.
