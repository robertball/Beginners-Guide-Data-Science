I made this a couple of times and they turn out good, But, I do now put in the undisolved yeast and things.  what I do is put the yeast, salt, sugar, and water together then wait a few minutes, then I add the flour and oil,and cheese, mix good and put into the muffin tins and let rise then bake, they turn out great.
