Zucchini, garlic, onion, olive oil and Parmesan cheese.  An enthusiastic YES!  Just one problem - and you'll find out immediately what that is if you cook this (especially the garlic) over high heat.  Medium heat is more like it and you must still be careful with the garlic to make sure it doesn't burn! Thirty seconds or so should be adequate, just until it is fragrant. In fact, I always add my garlic last.

I cooked this for our vegetarians, but even our "meat eaters" loved it!  My daughter has a tomato allergy, and so many zucchini recipes use them.  It is wonderful to find a simple and delicious recipe that does not.  This is definitely a keeper!

We liked this dish. Wonder what some crumbled bacon would add to it?!

I probably did something wrong, but it turned out SO watery. Not a fan.
