Made as recipe stated with boneless ribs. Was very flat, so I covered in Sweet Baby Rays Barbecue Sauce and broiled in oven for 10 minutes. Very tasty and tender.

Not tender Not flavorful Had to broil it 6 more minutes. Needed more seasoning or a ton of BBQ sauce. Sorry not a winner

Fast and Easy when you want ribs but donâ€™t have all day  for grilling. I followed recipe exactly as written and used Sweet Baby Rays Hickory and Brown Sugar sauce. Excellent

Fall off the bone ribs...a little too much.  I also took them out slathered them in BBQ sauce and placed under broiler for a few minutes.  Fast and easy!!
