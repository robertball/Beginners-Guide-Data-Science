This was absolutely spectacular it tasted great and we all loved it. The problem that people have been having is that they follow the recipe directly. So here's what we did: added vegetable such as baby corn, bell peppers and ccarrots, added 2 extra spoons of soy sauce and on top of all this we did a little less fish sauce. Bon appetit. P.s If ur not to strickt on calories you can always at a tea spoon of cream which gives it that extra bit of texture.

I thought this dish had potential but was way too salty.  Next time I will cut back on the fish sauce and add more sugar.  Also I think I will add some rice vinegar.

I thought this was going to be so good as I was making it, but it was incredibly salty.  In fact, we had to throw out most of it.  I didn't use light soy sauce either and now I know why the recipe calls for it.  Also, it wasn't spicy enough.  If I made this again, I would cut way back on the soy sauce and up the spice.  Very disappointed.

I wish I'd read the reviews before making this recipe.  It was way way too salty I would cut back on the fish sauce by at least half.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I think if you'd exchange the soy sauce for oyster sauce, your food would be less salty and more Thai flavored.  I received dash of this and a dash of that recipe for Thai chicken with cashews and that be the only thing that they told me different to do.

As written this is a 3 star recipe but with a few minor changes it could easily be 5 stars. First, based on the other reviews I only used 2 T fish sauce. I used 2 Serrano Chilies. For the sauce I would add minced garlic and about 1 T. toasted sesame oil. For the stir fry I used untoasted sesame oil but I think I would use peanut oil next time. This would definitely benefit from the addition of some vegetables. Thanks for an inspiring recipe.

It was ok. I did follow the recipe but boy it was too salty, combining fish sauce & soy sauce not a good idea. When pouring the sauce pour it slowly & taste it before pouring all of them. I have to remove the sauce & add extra water to remove the saltiness of it.
Overall, it taste good. Thank you for the recipe.

We found it to be good with no changes made and just the right amount of  heat. Will definitely make again.

I made this tonight and it was a dud. It needs garlic,  ginger and red pepper flakes. It was salty and not very flavorful. I'll try it again with the additions I suggested.

I made a few changes and my one year old daughter loved it. I skipped the cashews and chili peppers. I started out by stir frying fresh carrots with some frozen veggies in my wok. Added fresh bok Choy, mushrooms, and beef slices. It was delicious over a bed of fried rice. Not too salty at all...maybe because I used so many veggies.

Even with the suggested change of less soy and fish sauce it was still very salty.  Although, I did find that the leftovers (to which I added stir fry noodles) was far less salty.   Ok for an easy dish.
