I made this after lunch and then served it to two grandchildren after their naps. They liked it. Then I served it as dessert for my husband and me after dinner. Considering I have not eaten sweets in 8 weeks, I thought it was very refreshing. It's definitely a healthy alternative to sugar laden sweets and snacks and something I don't feel guilty eating. The only problem I see is that the bananas darkened a little. I'm wondering if they will darken even more by tomorrow.

The taste was good, but the texture was not. My kids and I didn't like the pieces of orange in it. Maybe a bit of orange juice instead, or mandarin oranges might be better to us as far as the texture goes.
