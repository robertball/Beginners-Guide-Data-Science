I made this exactly as written and couldn't taste the lemon, parsley or mint, so I ended up using about 1 tbsp of each. I also added more garlic.  With these amounts, the chickpeas are very flavorful.  For those who don't like spicy, I suggest you cut back on the red pepper flakes. I liked the bite, so I thought 1 tsp was perfect. A nice change of pace and a very healthy side dish.

Delicious, so easy, great flavour, super filling.  The fresh mint is definitely essential so don't skip it.  Not too much though!  I added more onion and garlic than instructed.

this was not to my taste; I would reduce the lemon juice by about half, and double or triple the amount of parsley used.
