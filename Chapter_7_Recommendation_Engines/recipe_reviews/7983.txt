I made this one for my husband who loves fruitcake. It was moist, buttery with a nice proportion of fruit to cake. It was a big hit!

This is the second year I have made this recipe for the holidays.  I used double the rum.  I used golden raisins and currants.  I used a mixture of lemon and orange peels.  After baking I dunked the cakes in rum and let them soak some up.  Then gave them time to mellow.  Slices best when cold.  My grandmother was French, and this recipe is close to what she made, according to my mother.  Thanks for the recipe!

Being a beginner at baking I found this recipe simple and fool proof! I have made it three times now - two were for xmas presents and both people have requested another. I made a few changes to make a dent in the fat content as follows: used half-fat butter and instead of light cream I used virtually no-fat yoghurt. Also used double the rum. If possible keep it wrapped for a few days and each day drizzle the top with a little more rum. The result is well worth it!!

I made this last year and this year also.  It is easy, and wonderful.  
I do make it in a less-fat manor -- I pour the rum over the fruit while I mix up the other ingredients.  And, I substitute low fat eggnog for the cream, use EggBeaters instead of Eggs, and use Smart Balance instead of butter (which requires another 3 tbs of unsweetened applesauce to keep the moistness..

This was a good start.  I liked the texture and the mild flavor from the rum, but missed the spices used in more traditional fruit cakes.  I will definitly be using this recipe again, I will just add some spices to help with the flavor.

Great, super-simple recipe! I used sultana and thompson raisens as well as a whole bunch of candied fruit. This cake was chalk-jam full of fruit and nuts.

This is definitely our kind of cake because we do like all the fruits.   This also keeps well (wrapped in foil) - can also drizzle some rum over the top after it is baked.   I did make one change and that was to subsitute corn syrup for honey (no honey lovers here) which works fine.  Highly recommend this little fruit cake.

I made it for Christmas and everyone loved it. Instead of regular raisins I used black currants. Wonderful fruitcake!

Very tasty.  It has a different texture than a quick bread - thicker and a little coarse.  Doesn't really need a topping but might be especially good w/ homemade orange butter.  I replaced RUM with more honey and cream.  Will make again.

Good flavor, but very dry.
