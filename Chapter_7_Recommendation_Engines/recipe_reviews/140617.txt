I'm not a vegan, but I love granola.  This was an excellent recipe.  I'm not a big molasses fan so I substituted comb honey or agave nectar.  I also just used raisins instead of mixed fruit and apricots because I did not have them on hand.  I will definitely make this again!

I was very excited to make my very first batch of granola.  Unfortunately, I would not make this particular recipe again.  It had too much molasses and turned out very brown.  It also burned in my oven after being in there for only 8 minutes.  Lastly, my husband and I had sick tummies after eating some of it.  If you can stomach a lot of molasses and are a dedicated vegan, go ahead and try it!  The ingredients are particularly nutritious for expecting mothers (much folic acid and iron).

Who knew making granola could be so easy? Although the premise is great, I found it a little bland. Perhaps a little more spice and just a little more sweetener would be good.   Word to the wise: better to take out of the oven sooner than later. I kept thinking it didn't quite look toasted enough after stirring it two or three times... so I left it in... and got some burnt pieces on the edge.

I used 1/4 cup maple and 1/4 cup molasses.  It was perfect. It's important to stir every 10 minutes and if your oven runs hot, lower it to 325degrees and leave it in the oven a few extra minutes. It's best to heat it slower than to burn it.

This recipe gets 4 stars for not using oil to make granola. This recipe is also good as a basic granola that you can add whatever you want to after it is baked. I baked it first as written and then baked it again with modifications. 

I agree with other reviewers that felt that cooking this granola at 350 degrees F is too long and too hot.  It was also not sweet enough for our tastes.

First I made this with the suggested ingredients and baked for the 30 minutes at 350 degrees F, stirring and checking it at 10 minute intervals.  I used parchment paper in my two pans.  It browned up nicely.  Unfortunately, it was burnt tasting.  

Next the modifications: I made my second (and third!) batch with more liquid ingredients; I mixed up 1/2 cup honey, 1/2 cup maple syrup, 1/4 cup apple juice and 1 tsp vanilla.  This time I cooked it, as other reviewers have suggested, at 325 degrees F for 20 minutes mixing it up and switching my pans after 10 minutes.  I pulled it out before it got brown or hard/dried out.  There was even some moisture remaining when I stirred it up after I removed it from the oven.  It dried as it cooled.  This combination made the perfect crunchy, sweet-tasting granola. 

I will use this recipe again as modified.

Very good!!  Next time I'm going to substitute the molasses with Agave to see how that turns out.

This is a great snack.  I found that 30 minutes was a bit too long when using 2 baking sheets, so the next time I just used one.  I may try 2 baking sheets again for 20-25 minutes.

This was great!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out wonderfully.  Make sure to stir the granola every 10 minutes, as the edges get very browned.  Thanks for the recipe!

Hi 

My top tip would be to leave adding the dried fruit until after its taken out of the oven, otherwise it dries out and goes hard.

The recipe was quite good, my SIL was so thankful when I gave her the batch I made. My husband and I just loved the flavor. And will make again. Super easy recipe and very quick to throw together and bake. I'm trying the next batch with agave. TY

Just made this with some tweaks of my own.  Smells and tastes great.  But, I agree that the cooking time is too long.  At 20 minutes total, it was getting very brown.  One question,  what constitutes a serving?  Thanks for the recipe.

I used honey instead of molasses and baked at 325 per other reviews. I only used 1 11x17 pan, and it worked great. I really like the apple juice addition, and it has a nice crunch.
