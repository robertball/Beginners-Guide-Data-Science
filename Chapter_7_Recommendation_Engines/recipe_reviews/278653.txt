Liked it much and easy to prepare! I did it a little differently mixed everything together and then layered it in the pan, also mixed crushed corn chips cheese and black olives on top gave it some crunch!

I have always made this exact dish, but called it chicken enchiladas! I don't care for the red sauce, so give it a try with green enchilada sauce! Different flavor. (I did give the red sauce a try for this review.)

When I first attempted to make this, I asked my dad to grill the chicken, but he grilled it to DEATH! So, I couldn't make it. But the next time, I just cooked the chicken thighs on the stove top for about 10-12 minutes with salt and pepper for seasoning and then finished baking them in the oven using thyme, tarragon, oregano, rosemary, and a garlic herb blend that I get at Kroger until done. I combined the salsa roja with the green salsa verde, used Taco Bell shredded cheese blend and Kraft Mexican cheese alternately, used less chicken than what the recipe called for, added the other ingredients in the recipe, and everything turned out great! 
I will definitely try to make this at least once a month. Hopefully one day I will make it with the grilled chicken next time.

I made two versions.  One with the refried beans (I used black beans) and one without because some of my kids don't like beans.   I added black olives and some of us added Tabasco to the final product.  The four boys and husband all said it was good and  most of it was eaten up.  (To be fair, 4 teenage boys and a husband, not much goes to waste)  I gave 4 starts because I think it could use more salsa and I just don't really like the texture of corn tortillas.  But it was good!

No corn and used shredded rotisserie chicken.  Pretty good.  Will try again.

I will definitely make it again. I didn't have all the ingredients but it still turned out really good. Super easy
