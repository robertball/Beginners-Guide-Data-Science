These beans are awesome! I use Catalina dressing instead of French.  I also use fresh beans because they are easier to handle and slightly cook the bacon before wrapping the beans.  These always impress!

My mother-in law makes these and they are always a holiday favorite.  She does use Catalina Dressing and recomends letting them sit for a least 4 hours before cooking.

I have been making these beans for years.  It's always requested for the holidays.  I do agree with the suggestion of slightly cooking the bacon before rolling the bundles.  For added zip,use peppered bacon and zesty French dressing

I made these as an alternative to the regular green bean casserole for Thanksgiving.  People either loved them or didn't care for them.  I used whole green beans that were frozen in their own steam bags which I steamed for about 1/2 the time recommended on the package before cooling and wrapping with bacon and then covered with fat free Catalina dressing.  I would definitely make this recipe again.

A wonderful presentation & flavor for the everyday green bean.  Great for a dinner party & each guest feels special to receive her own little bundle.

I have been making these for years, but I have one more secret for you! Add a dry mix of italian dressing before the wet dressing. Also let them marinate over night or longer and the flavore is absorbed and pickles the green beans. I keep two cans soaking in my fridge at all times so we can have this treat and any time.

Oh so yummy!  And really easy to make!  The only modification I made was to season the bacon with some cajun seasoning first.  I'm from Louisiana and put cajun seasoning on everything :)

We have an overload of green beans from the garden and I was browsing recipes to use them up. This one caught my attention and honestly, I'm surprised at how good they are! Because my beans were fresh, I steamed them to crisp tender and wrapped with pre-cooked bacon. This way, it only took about 10 minutes in the oven for the bacon to crisp and the dressing to get a bit bubbly. We all enjoyed them, especially my daughter who like the sweetness that came from the French dressing.  I suspect that cooking canned beans @375 for 30 minutes would make them pretty mushy. Try this with fresh green beans!

AMAZING!!! (I also partially cooked the bacon before wrapping the green beANS).  My husband isn't usually vocal about HOW MUCH he likes something- but he & the rest of the family sure did on this! AMAZING!

These were delicious! Next time I am going to let them marinate in the dressing to soak up the flavor before I cook them.

Boyfriend loved them... he hates vegetables so by soaking them in dressing and wrapping pork around it, he was thrilled. For someone who likes fresh food, it was serious overkill on the flavors.

Apparently my son-in-law likes this so much that he is expecting it again this year for Christmas dinner! I don't bundle them, though. Sorry, but I'm lazy! I just throw it all in a pan and use Ken's Steak House fat-free dressing. The bacon has lots of fat anyway. But I like how easy it is.
