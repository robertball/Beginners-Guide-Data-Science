This was a lot of work and time.  The filling and frosting didn"t come out the way I thought it would.  I may have cooked it too long but it had an awesome flavor. I followed the recipe as posted.  May find a different lemon frosting next time.  Gave it 4 stars because even though it was time consuming the flavor is very lemony!!

This is my favorite lemon cake recipe. I don't care for the glaze consistency of the frosting, so I use a different frosting recipe.

This is a very old Southern Cake receipt. In Georgia we call it a lemon cheese cake. You are right about the photo but I have never known the recipe for this to match one! In my family we frost the sides with Divinity Fudge. It is not a cake for beginners! Once mastered it is very good.

I really wanted to like this recipe but couldn't.  As other reviewers have said, the glaze consistency is way off. I ended up tempering in an extra egg yolk and cooking (boiling) it for around 10-15 minutes to get it to thicken up. I should have just used my "stand by" lemon pie filling recipe.  The cake itself came out somewhat dry, I don't think I overworked it, but I could have done so. They show frosting in the picture, but there is no frosting recipe with this cake.  I ended up making a lemon cream cheese frosting. I like the idea of a six layer lemon cake with a curd filling, but this one isn't it.

I'll make this again, but might half the filling, as I didn't split the layers and it was too much. Needless to say, it's delicious, lemony and wasn't that difficult to make. I found the filling a bit tricky to get right, I was expecting it to be more of a curd than the syrup it ended up being.  Very nice!

I thought the cake was delicious- dense and moist. The glaze was very sweet -but thin and the cake is "plain" enough it can take it. I can to use a separate recipe for the frosting (I chose lemon) overall good/great cake

I was so excited when I found this recipe. I am not a baker at all and suddenly got the bug to start trying different recipes. I used this recipe for my mom's 70th birthday as a surprise. I thought I could adjust the recipe based on the suggestions of previous reviews but the cake was terrible, to hard to cut. The only thing that I improved was the lemon flavor but the cake itself was not moist and fluffy and just too stiff. Too much work for such a great disappointment! It took me 3 hours to complete. Unless you are a pretty confident baker and know how to adjust the recipe for your benefit, I suggest just using an entirely different recipe. I've had great success with other home made recipes that I've tried.
