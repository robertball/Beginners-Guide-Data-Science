This was quite tasty! The recipe didn't specify what type/color  miso to use - I normally use white, however I had some dark rice miso on hand so that's what I used. I added a couple teaspoons of dashi to the water since my miso didn't have added dashi. Other than this minor change, the flavor was good. I don't usually put carrot and potato in my miso soup, so that was a nice change.  A couple recommendations: there is no need to dirty two pots. Just use the large pot that the vegetables were cooked in to make the soup. I would probably use less wakame next time, but that's just personal preference.
