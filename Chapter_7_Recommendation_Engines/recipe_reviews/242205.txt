I have made many spelt pizza dough recipes, getting soggy crumby bottoms that stick to the pan....This one is hands down, the BEST. I followed the recipe to a T, and got a wonderful little pizza, with a crunchy base and a soft middle. It held up well to the toppings I added--and one of the pizzas was a meatlovers, so it had a lot of toppings on it. My family avoids wheat as we do not tolerate it very well, however we digest spelt just fine. I don't think I'll find a better recipe than this one, so I think I'll stop looking! Although I am wondering if this one might lend itself to my grill....we'll see!

Just as a tip make sure you are not overzealous with the amount of dough you use for an individual pizza. After the dough rises slightly its a good idea to stretch it out relatively thin so you end up with a lighter feeling pizza. It's heavy if you use regular/fast food pizza thickness. You can also make small pizza pockets or eat thirds or halves of individual pizzas.

This dough came together easily, and baked up nicely.  It has a nice flavor, crispy texture with a bit of chew.  I followed the advice from the video and heated it in a cast iron pan on the stovetop before baking, and that was a mistake.  The crusts burned on the bottom, and it was unnecessary anyway, since they baked plenty crispy at 475.  Next time I'll try using a pizza pan and seeing if they might be a bit chewier that way.

Great recipe, the crust is thin and crispy, but everything holds together. I use regular spelt flour.

Phenomenal. Followed directions exactly (aside from cooking first in skillet) baked for about 15 min at 475. So easy to make and a really yummy thin crust. Thank you so much for sharing this!

Tasty. But you need to do your research on spelt. It is NOT gluten-free so celiacs and other gluten-related diseases may NOT use this. It is much lower in gluten than bread wheat and has more nutrients. Makes it healthier for most of us to be sure and I use it frequently in my flour blends when I want a little more rising action. The two wheats belong to the same genera but spelt is either a different species or is a subspecies. Apparently this last issue is till being debated.

Thanks again for a fantastic recipe, Chef John! My son is obsessed with pizza and i've been buying some for him every week. My family has been playing around with spelt flour for pancakes and some bread. This is what i've been looking for. Tried it out today and it taste great! Great tip on how to make it crunchy with a cast iron pan. Threw it in the fridge after it proofed. Took it out 30 mins before using it and it worked great!

Easy to make and spelt is so much better for you. This is the only pizza base we use in our house.

Wow John!  Haven't tried it with spelt yet; I will.  Cast iron is my favorite item to cook with.  Just about everything I own is cast iron.  I was doing a lot of fireplace cooking during Irma as my power was out.  This would be Incredible to cook on a campfire or grill.  Never thought of pizza over the fire.  I am on it!  The beauty of it is taking the skillet off the stovetop and popping it right into the oven!

This was good.  I've only made pizza dough from scratch twice now, and this was the 2nd time.  As an experiment, I used beer (warmed to the prescribed temp) instead of water.  I'll make it again and maybe try water.

This is my go-to recipe for making pizza crust, dough for Stromboli, and I’ve made several loaves of bread out of this recipe. My family said that this is the best homemade bread I’ve made.

I made this crust following the directions with no altering. It was delicious! It was easy to make and the crust was nice and crisp without being hard.  I cooked it following Chef John's instructions using an iron skillet and it worked perfectly. I will definitely be making this crust again.

I loved this recipe. Followed ingredients exactly but put in the bread machine. It was a little sticky so sprayed a bowl with oil and put dough in there with a little flour and lightly kneaded. Rolled out dough and put in my large cold cast iron skillet.  Baked at 475F. It was crispy and delicious.

I didn't have time to let the dough rise completely so halved all the steps—and my oven only goes to 225C—it was still a very tasty dough! I used wholemeal spelt,  and it was good topped with pistachio pesto, red peppers and bocconcini
