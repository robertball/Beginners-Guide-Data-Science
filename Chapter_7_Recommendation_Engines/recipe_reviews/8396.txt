This cake is so chocolatey and moist, and so easy to make. I made it with my 2 1/2 year old, and he had a great time. If I hadn't made it myself I never would have known that it's w/o eggs.I will definately make this again, will also use this recipe for cupcakes. I agree with another reviewer that this cake should be renamed, "chocolate oil cake" doesn't sound very appealing, but the cake is really great!Update: I used this recipe for cupcakes, took 20 minutes to bake and came out really good -I got 24 cupcakes out of this recipe. (This cake also freezes well.)

wow i am impressed at the simplicity of this recipie and how perfect it came out. I halved the recipie and substituted applesuace for the oil and make 6 cupcakes out of it. Replace the oil for apple sauce saves a boat load of calories and each muffin i made only has 200 calories. Im eating these with some milk. yum a somewhat healthy chocolate fix this is, so moist and soft.

I'm giving this a 3 star for taste.  It's a good chocolate cake.  However, I attempted to bake it in 2 9-inch rounds.  I was trying to make a chocolate layer cake.  I buttered and cocoa-ed the pans.  Unfortunately they stuck badly and werent usable (although my family enjoyed my "mistake").

Very similar to a recipe my family has made for years.  It's the best chocolate cake ever, in my opinion!  I use 1 tsp. salt, 2 tsp. vanilla and only 3/4 cup oil; then bake 30 min.  It's yummy!

I found the results of this cake to be similiar to a devil's food cake recipe that I often use.  This recipe is certainly rich and chocolately, but I didn't find it chewy at all, just wonderfully moist.  I think the results are excellent if you want a very moist cake, and especially if you don't happen to have eggs handy.  The only change I would make is to add a little more salt to the recipe.  I made this for a friend's birthday and covered it with whipped cream and fresh strawberries.  It was incredibly good.  This is my new favorite chocolate cake recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

This is great because: it's very easy, very quick, very chocolatey, very moist, very inexpensive, and very easy to clean up after (one bowl- yeah)!  I brought this to a meeting and it was very well received too!  I sub'd 1 c. of packed brown sugar for one of the cups of white sugar because that was what I had on hand.  Turned out great & I just dusted with powdered sugar to serve.  The only thing it needs is a "prettier" name- maybe "Super Cake"!

This is a good basic chocolate cake.  It's easy to put together with ingredients usually on hand.  I frosted my cake with a jumbo Hershey's bar.  I broke it into sections and placed evenly over the hot cake and allowed it to melt.  Then I smoothed it over the entire cake.

I made this cake for a friend with a dairy allergy.  It tasted pretty good - a lot like a boxed cake mix.  It would work as a vegan cake as well.  I improvised a non-dairy frosting of melted semisweet chocolate chips, 3 tbs brewed coffee, 1 tbs canola oil, and a little maple syrup for sweetener.  Worked well together

The cake was very moist and delicious.  It was perfect because I needed to make cake but I didn't have any eggs!  I think I'll stick to this recipe and save my eggs for something else!

This DOES have a name--Wacky Cake.  Surprised no one else recognized it.  It's a depression era recipe, and this is the same recipe as mine except that mine takes 2/3 C oil.  Maybe that's why some are finding this recipe a bit oily.  I've always added an extra teaspoon of vanilla as it boosts the flavor, and dark cocoa is best with this recipe.  You won't like this cake if you only like cakes that are light and have a fine crumb.  This one is dense and moist.  Takes no milk or eggs, thus it's usefulness during the depression.  Look it up online; there are quite a few variations on this theme.  Perhaps the current economic climate is forcing it's comeback...

Excellent flavor and very moist!  This is my new favorite chocolate cake!  I add 2/3 cup oil instead of the whole cup to lessen the fat and it is still extremely moist.

So upset with this disaster. Mostly cos this time I tried to follow the recipe and only changed a few things: I used apple vinegar , sunflower oil instead of vegetable oil, 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar. For so much flour, 1/4 cup cocoa seemed very little..and the batter didn't taste chocholatey enough so I added melted chocholate.  I knew something was wrong when my dog couldn't be bothered to stand in front of the oven when I was baking! She rolled over in her sleep and I knew this was a goner....the result was strange and too heavy...sorta gluey and mildly sweet. Nobody would eat it.Back to eggs and butter cakes for me, sorry.

I didnt have any oil, so I used 1/2 cup applesauce and half a cup butter. And  I used dark cocoa instead of regular. Turned out great, this is now my on-hand choc cake go-to recipe.

This recipe makes 24 cupcakes, filled with 1/4 cup batter.  They were baked in 18 minutes.  Quick and easy and good when you want something chocolatey.  No frosting is really necessary because they are very moist.

I halved this recipe. It came out really moist and just delicious. The recipe didnt mention to oil/flour the pan, but i did anyway so it wouldnt stick. Also, to spruce it up, I didn't have the ingredients to make my own icing, so I used half a jar of marshmallow creme. It came out SO good!

I only rated this 4 stars because I did feel I needed to make minor changes to it. Don't get me wrong the recipe is a very good basic cake especially if your out of eggs. I added 1tsp salt and after it was all mixed it didn't taste chocolaty enough for my taste so I added a squirt of Hershey's syrup and it gave it a more traditional chocolate flavor. I will definitely make again and perhaps add chocolate chips.

I made this cake today, for dessert tonight. It is FANTASTIC! so fluffy and light... and rich! it is very yummy, easy, and fast to make. I followed the directions completely, with the exception that I added a bit more salt. I paired it with whip cream, sliced strawberries, and blueberries.  I highly reccommend this recipe.

we have made this cake in our family for generations...the only difference I see is we add 2 tablespoons real vanilla extract and mix it right in the 13 X 9" pan to save dishes...makes it even easier.

I tried this cake some time last week and while it was very easy to make, it seems to have some flaws in the amount of oil to use. I followed the recipe exactly and while the cake was moist, it had an oily feel to it. I would definitely make this cake again, just use less oil next time.

The texture of this cake is nice but it's not very chocolatey and has an off flavor to it.  The next time I want cake, I'll just wait until I have eggs on hand.

I followed the recipe, but used two 9 inch round silicon cake pans.  It only took 22 minutes to bake.  After resting for 10 minutes, the cakes came out of the pans just fine.  I used cool whip/chocolate pudding/powdered sugar frosting and it was delicious!

Yay for a yummy VEGAN desert!  I added a handful of chocolate chips and cooked it in a bundt pan (50 minutes).  It stuck, but tastes great.  Next time I will try to use half applesauce and half oil.

I was a little afraid when I saw the better which was rather runny, but it baked up fine.  Though, I had to extend the cook time about five minutes.  It is very moist, and stuck to the pan (which I didn't grease).  The taste is kind of bland, lacking in chocolatey-ness.  It wasn't my favorite, but was made better by an icing I whipped up.

This cake can NEVER be made as a layer cake.  I have used this recipe for nearly 10 years. I always have the ingredients on hand. It is my son's favorite and the first thing I take to a potluck.  You can make cup cakes with this, but not a layer cake.  I usually bake in an 8" square pan, or increase the ingrdients by 50% to make a 9x13.  EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT recipe. With a cold glass of milk, this is the cake to eat to mend that broken heart. This is the cake to "make it all better."

to be perfectly honest, I never actually made this cake. However, my sister did and although the cake was a nice flavor, it was as dry as a desert!! (and she's a fine baker)

This cake was delicious! I would have never guessed that it was egg and dairy free. The texture was moist (much like a devil's food). It was wonderful that the entire family I made the cake for was able to enjoy it (one of them has egg and dairy allergies). I made a dairy free frosting with vegetable shortening, powdered sugar, vanilla, butter flavoring and water. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I found this too heavy and oily.  We ate it but didn't enjoy it a whole lot. I followed the recipe to a tee, but baked it in a bundt pan.  I don't think the pan made much difference.

You don't have ti dirty a bowl. Just mix all the dry ingredients in the baking pan & make three "wells" in dry ingredients.  Put vinegar in one, oil in one and vanilla in the other.  Pour water over the top and stir well.  I also add a tsp. of cinnamon in with the dry ingredients.

This is my husbands favorite cake.  It is quick & easy to make and comes out quite moist.  I do think that it is better if you use 1 white sugar & 1 Brown sugar.  I iced it with the Hard Chocolate Icing from this site & it was total chocolate overload.  Yum!

This did not turn out well at all... it stuck in the (buttered) pan, and tasted not very sweet or rich... kinda bland. I will keep searching for the perfect chocolate cake recipe... this isn't it.

I made this because I wanted a recipe without butter (I didn't have any and its expensive and hard to get in china) and this cake tasted really good. Maybe not quite as good as with butter, but for kids it was perfect. Made cupcakes.

This cake is fantastic! Very moist & chocolaty and so easy! I used 3/4 t. salt, other than that followed recipe exactly. Topped it with "Food Processor Chocolate Whipped Cream Frosting"--double batch.

Wow .. this was REALLY easy to make!! And the result wasn't bad at all! Except that i baked it in a round pan and it was a little bit small, so the middle didn't cook as much .. but it was fine, "it tastes like chocolate filling" is what they said! So ya! next time i'll put frosting on it or something .. It's Great =)

this was so wonderful and soft and moist. I topped it with a basic buttercream frosting recipe I had on hand, it came out just lovely. Update: make it with coconut extract instead of vanilla and coffee instead of water for a super delicious cake!

This cake was very easy to make so I would definitely make it again. Although it was not the best chocolate cake I ever had it was tasty. I sprayed the layer pans prior to adding the batter so they came out very easily and cleanly.

This is one of the best chocolate cakes I've had, and it was also  so easy to make! Someone said they thought it tasted like a cake mix, but I didn't think so at all. It is so rich, moist and dense. I just put sweetened whipped cream on top and that was enough. This would also be a good food storage cake recipe since it doesn't have eggs or milk or butter, in case you have an emergency need to bake a cake! :)

My hubby is a chocolate cake-aholic. I made this for his birthday and he loved it. It's very moist. It bakes evenly -- without the crown in the middle, so it would be great for layers, too. I usually use mixes, but this cake was as easy as a mix. I'll definately make it again.

This is a great, versatile recipe.  I made it as a sheet cake, and as cupcakes (changing the baking times, of course).  Very tasty and moist each time.  Great with any frosting or just a dusting of powdered sugar!

This recipe is a keeper! Not only does it have great flavor, it's simple, quick and all ingredents are kept in most pantry's. I used this recipe for a Bridal shower, and made cupcakes istead of a cake. It worked great. The recipe yeilds exactly 24 cupcakes and I baked them for 30 min. They were perfectly round and fluffy. I topped them of with buttercream icing. Thanks for the recipe!

Just had to write to say how wonderfully easy this is! I did add 3/4-C. cocoa instead of just 1/2-C. and it was just as chocolately as I had NEEDED it to be. Thank You again, for such an easy cake recipe that I can make with things I have on hand!

i made this cake today .i mixed the cocoa powder in water and added.this prevents lumps and the cocoa mixes well into the flour.
i halved the amount exactly. soon after baking there was a hard crust  on top  which made me think i ve choosen the wrong recipe. but by the evening/next day it turned out amazingly moist and soft.nobody believed its without eggs and butter.i didnt have white vinegar so added apple cider vinegar and the rest followed the recipe exactly.definitely a  great,easy cake .thanks for sharing the recipe.

This cake is pretty good. It is very moist with great texture, but I really think I miss the eggs. The taste is lacking a bit. Next time will cut back to 3/4 c. oil and add an egg. Either way, a quick fix for a pretty good dessert. Thanks!

This recipe is amazing!  Don't need to bother buying a chocolate cake mix again - this recipe is very easy and moist.  It's also great because it has no eggs/dairy and rises perfect without them.  This is a keeper I will use exclusively for my chocolate cakes - thanks for sharing!

Great chocolate cake if you are in a hurry and don't have any butter or eggs on hand. Well, even if you do this is a great cake recipe. I added a drizzled topping of melted semi-sweet chocolate. Easy and goood!

This is basically a very good and easy recipe...maybe not the best out there but certainly acceptable.   For those who complained about it stick I would suggest you do not use butter to grease your cake tins.   Lard or shortening is much more reliable because butter tends to burn and stick.   At least this is what I find.   Cake pan release like PAM is always better.

Perfect! I was making mayo cake but I ran out of mayo after just a 1/2 cup so I found this recipe and followed everything, just with an extra 1/2 cup of mayo because I had already added to the mix. I did use whet flour because it was what I had at home, but the wheat taste was too strong. I am sure with white flour this will be perfect.

FABULOUS cake!  Moist and flavourful. I halved the recipe for an 8" square, added about 1/4 cup of mini chocolate chips as well as 1 Tablespoon of instant coffee mixed in the water.  I am calling it "Easy Eggless Chocolate Cake" instead of using 'oil' in its name, with EASY emphasized (one bowl and no mixer!!). Try it everyone!

This recipe dates back to the depression & war years, when eggs, butter & milk were rationed. You could find the recipe in government issued recipe booklets with suggestions on how to cook & bake without eggs & dairy. 

The cake was known as Whacky cake, Depression cake, Eggless Butterless Chocolate cake, One Pan Chocolate Cake, Three Hole Chocolate cake, & a slew of other quirky nicknames it garnered throughout the years, but this is the first time I've seen it referred to as Chocolate Oil Cake! 

This is a good basic chocolate cake recipe & without fail, it'll be moist everytime you make it. 

I can assure you though, from years of baking this cake & the fact it calls for vinegar & soda for levening,  you will receive a mixture of positive & negative feedback comments such as:  'I love this cake' ... 'this cake tastes great' .... 'This cake is wonderful!' .... 

Or: 'Eww, I don't like this cake'...  'What's wrong with this cake?' 'Why does this cake taste funny?'...


Happy Baking!!   : )

I liked it, it was good, just not the flavor I was expecting. I never really thought about how much flavor eggs give to cakes. I think I prefer 'egg recipes' better. This was good, if I didnt have eggs & was In need of a chocolate cake fix - I would definetly make again.

I was a little nervous after mixing this up and seeing how thin the batter was and the way it smelled because of the vinegar...but let me tell you...this is one delicious cake!  I did add some chocolate chips and a little extra vanilla to it after reading some other reviews, but I think it would still be perfect without them.  Try this cake...I don't think you'll be disappointed!!

My husband had this as a child and it was his favorite.  His mom used to call it Wacky Cake, I think it may have been a  cake from the depression because of the simple ingredients.  Anytime we want a simple, moist, and delicious cake this is our go to.  It is quick and great with just a dusting of confectioners sugar.  Sixty years later and it is still his first choice for a birthday cake.

This recipe was given to my Mom from a great-aunt back in 1962...it was called "Crazy Cake", due to having no eggs in it.  A family favorite, I bake it often.  Because a 9 X 13 cake is more difficult to store, I usually bake it in a bundt pan sprayed with Pam for Baking spray.  Comes out very easily - never had one stick yet!  I have added chopped chocolate chips and also jarred mincemeat for delicious results.  Easy recipe to add to.  I DO use 3/4 c. cocoa (my preference) along with 1 T vanilla and 1 tsp. salt.

This was the easiest scratch cake I've ever made!  I used lactose free milk instead of water.  I honestly think I could've just sat down with the bowl of batter and a spoon and been very happy.  I have a ridiculous sweet tooth so the next piece I have I think I'll drizzle some caramel or chocolate sauce or throw some frosting on it, but if you're not huge into super sweet things this might be just right for you.  My family really, really liked it as is.

This is similar to my mother-in-laws depression era cake - make it better with the following changes: use 2 cups cooled black coffee for the water and add 1/2 tsp of almond extract. It will be darker, moister and so flavorful.

i edited it! 2 cups vanilla rice milk instead of water; reduce to 1 cup of sugar; + cinnamon, and cake flour instead of all-purpose.  2 9 inch rounds 22 minutes (thanks to previous post suggestion!)

Rich is right! This is the best chocolate cake ever.  We're a small family so unless company's coming, next time I'll make less. It was actually difficult to finish! Oh, the challenges one must endure.

I have made this several times and it is fantastic! It's very moist and light.  I usually halve the recipe and make one 9" cake layer, and I just dust it with powdered sugar and serve it that way, or with fresh sliced strawberries if they're around.  This makes an extremely easy, fast and foolproof dessert.  The only drawback is that because of the lack of eggs, this cake doesn't have a very stiff structure and so it wouldn't work well as a layer cake. But as a one-layer cake or as cupcakes it works great and is one of the moistest, most delicious chocolate cakes I've ever tried.  When I was in college the cafeteria served vegan chocolate cake, and it was way better than their non-vegan cake.  My friends and I never believed it was really vegan because it was so good.  But after trying this recipe, I believe!

Love this recipe!  I've used it several times for cakes and cupcakes and it has always produced a flawlessly moist cake.  If you judge this cake by the batter, you are truly missing out.  The batter is not tasty (probably someting to do with the vinager in it) and rather runny, but the end product is EXCELLENT.  I've had more requests for this cake than any other.

**amendment to my previous review** 
It's been a few days since I made this cake and it's still very moist. Another thing I might add to this cake is cinnamon. For some reason I feel that flavour would compliment this cake. Also if I halve the recipe again I will use the full teaspoon of vanilla. It's just lacking a little something. 

Ok this was really, really good. I will definitely make it again when I need a quick and easy chocolate cake. I halved the recipe because I didn't want to make such a big batch. I used only 3/4 cup of sugar and I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil to lighten it up and cut the fat. I did sprinkle some chocolate chips on top just to add a little something special. Since I halved the recipe it only cooked for about 35 minutes.

I agree with other reviewers that the title “Chocolate Oil Cake” is the wrong name, but it is an incredibly good cake for not having eggs or dairy! I made this for a birthday party and no one would have known the difference! It was SUPER easy too. I was a little hesitant about using cocoa powder as chocolate but it was so moist and the perfect amount of sugary taste. I cut the recipe in half though, because 3 cups of flour seemed like more than I’ve ever baked with before. I did take another reviewer’s advice and kept the salt at ½  tsp. though, and the vanilla extract at 1 tsp. After combining all the said ingredients, I folded in strawberries (chopped into small pieces) and baked for about 45 minutes. When the cake cooled I dusted it with powdered sugar and added three whole strawberries for decoration. The strawberries were a yummy addition and they toned down the chocolate. Overall, I'm extremely impressed by this simple idea!

This was a good cake, but the taste of the oil I used came thru too much I thought.. very good though. Cake came out moist and tasted good.  I might try this recipe again using a lighter type of oil.. I think I used vegetable oil.

Made this for hubby's birthday since he loves chocolate cake and it was a big success.  I hate to admit I've only made cakes from scratch a couple of times.  Now that I've found this one, I will definitely make it more often!  Easy and delicious.  Served with the Chocolate Frosting I submitted by tianne on this site.  Thanks!

This cake is AWESOME!  My dad is vegetarian and doesn't eat eggs or anything with eggs, so it is perfect.  My grandpa in a chocoholic and he really loved it.  When I was searching for this recipe, I was actually looking for an oil cake that my grandma use to make.  The recipe is pretty much the same, but you marble it.  Add all the dry ingredients, minus the cocoa, and mix with the wet ingredients.  Divide the mix and add the cocoa to half.  When you are pouring it in the pan mix bits of the cocoa and regular batter.  Afterwards, pull a fork through the batter to mix it up even more.  This recipe is just perfect.  Love it!!!

This is my husbands most favorite cake in the world!!!!  Everytime I make it I top it with a butter cream frosting, last time I baked it in a greased and floured bundt pan for his birthday and it was awesome! Sometimes I use 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white, and it is just wonderful!

This cake is so easy to make, and it is simply delicious!  It's not overly sweet, so when used with a frosting (I make a mocha-buttercream frosting) the overall cake is a nice, sweet treat without being too sweet.  Even my dad, who doesn't like chocolate cake likes this recipe.  I did manage to cook it in two 9" rounds, but you have to really grease and flour the bottom.  Next time I might use parchment paper on the bottom instead, as one of the rounds did stick a little.  I am definitely using this again in the future!

I love this cake. I've made it as cupcakes both times (so far) and I find it a deliciously moist, spongey chocolate cake. It doesn't even need frosting, though a thin sugar frosting could do if you really want frosting.  I've experimented with the oil and vinegar used - one time I used cold-pressed rapeseed oil instead of canola (gave it a nutty flavour) and another raspberry vinegar instead of distilled white (subtle berry flavour). I'm going to try apple vinegar next, and I might add a dash of cinnamon to bring out the chocolate flavour.  All in all, great and very easy chocolate cake, so easy to adapt to what you have at home. Definitely a keeper!!

Very moist and delicious!  Has a fudge-cake consistency. I used dark dutch cocoa powder instead of regular cocoa.  To make the chocolate flavor "pop" I added a teaspoon of instant coffee.  I chose not to frost the cake, but served with mint chocolate chip ice cream while the cake was still warm. It was so awesome!

Not very happy with the cake. The consistency is nice and moist but it hardly tastes of chocolate. Also it took a long time to cook and stuck to the bottom of the pan despite cake release. Won't make it again.

No eggs! How great is that? I loved sipping my coffee with it. This cake is not too sweet. I didn't have any frosting, so I put cinnamon swirl cream cheese and a few walnuts on top. Very good!

My husband loved this! I increased the salt to one tsp. and the vanilla to 2 tsp. as some other reviewers suggested. Very moist and great flavor! Next time I might add some mini chocolate chips and top with some hot fudge from a jar to make it super chocolatey. But it was great just by itself!

This is as close to a box cake as you're going to get without actually making it out of a box. I thought it was pretty good, certainly one of the easier cake recipes I've come across. This may just become my chocolate cake staple. It was so simple.

A great recipe, the cake was delicious! I am curious about the uses of baking soda and powder in an eggless cake because I've tried a similar recipe that called for both, while this one only needed bakng soda. I also made some changes. First I used brown instead of white sugar, and cut the amount in half because I used unsweetened applesauce in place of oil and added 2 crushed ripe bananas. Tossed in some raisins too. Would have been even better if I had pistachios. This is a new staple for me as I love chocolate but am trying to watch my calorie intake.

Fantastic - I've been trying several different scratch cake recipes that I could make in my toaster oven; this one is the easiest, cheapest, and most importantly, the tastiest. I re-scaled the recipe to 8 servings to bake in a 6" X 8" toaster oven pan (which provides 6 normal pieces or 4 gluttonous pieces). Highly, highly recommended.

I do have to admit it was a little too gooey for my rediculously picky taste but i enjoyed this recipe and will continue using it. I replaces the regular cocoa powder in my second batch (the first was a bit too bland)with Gheridelli's chocolate powder and the taste was divine!

This recipe isn't bad. Pretty good and easy to make- But definitely TASTES oily. It leaves a weighty feeling in your tummy. Mine wouldn't cook well either. It's a bit too gooey and I thought the oil could be reduced. Beyond the cooking oil- the chocolate flavor was nice.

Great moist cake - could do with more sugar as it was a bit bitter. I made half the recipe so maybe this affected the taste.

If there was ever a perfect cake recipe, this is it. So easy to make, one bowl, one spoon. Everyone loved it, complimented me and asked for the recipe (which I denied them!) It is especially good if you are short on ingredients or preperation time. With no egg, no butter, I had everything I needed to make this. Will definetly make again! Two thumbs up!

Best scratch chocolate cake I have ever made. I baked it as for a 2 layer birthday cake and used a cooked chocolate glaze for the topping. My family loved it, especially when they discovered that is safe for our Vegan friends and those intolerant of lactose and cholesterol. Thank you for sharing!

Easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I couldn't stand the taste.  I even tried making the kids taste it and they made the same face I did.  It hit the trash.  It's not that the recipe is bad per say...I personally just thought it tasted horrible.

The only thing I did was cut this recipe in half to use it as cupcakes.  I made homemade frosting for them and took them to a birthday party.  They were LOVED by all.  I was hoping to have a couple to take back home, but there weren't even crumbs left.  This was YUMMY!  Next time I will try it with the applesauce that I have seen recommended.  But I didn't change anything in it.

My family has been using this recipe for over 50 years...we know it as Crazy Chocolate Cake.  It doesn't work for layer cake, but in my mind it is the best chocolate cake ever.  Cut the recipe in half and bake in an 8" pan for smaller group.  My mom always used to ice it with chocolate frosting laced with coffee.  Yum!

I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9" silicone pan for only about 20-25 minutes. The texture of the cake is very soft and fluffy, but the flavour needs work. It gets better the next day. It needs something on the side, or a frosting--it doesn't have enough flavour to stand on its own. If I try this one again, I would bake it a day ahead and add one or more of the following: additional cocoa, white or bittersweet chocolate chips or chunks, coffee, almond extract, etc. I served the cake with whipped cream and slices of strawberry and banana. (It's very good with the banana.)

This cake is absolutely awesome! I followed the advice of previous reviewers and used a 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce.  In addition to the baking soda called for in the recipe, I also added an equal amount of baking powder along with two tablespoons of instant coffee to enhance the flavor of the chocolate. I also increased the amount of cocoa powder to 3/4 of a cup. Instead of using white vinegar, I used apple cider vinegar.

This batter mixed up very well and was not runny at all as other people have expressed.  The cake came out perfectly and was deliciously rich and chocolatey!  I don't miss eggs or butter in this recipe at all.

This is a keeper in my house and my new favorite homemade chocolate cake recipe!

Texture-wise it was perfect, spongy and very moist...but taste-wise?...I'm not so sure. I'm not saying it tastes bad but it's not good either. My solution was to serve it with a scoop of vanilla-pecan ice cream and that saved the cake.

This cake was pretty good.  A little heavy but that could be to me using egg substite instead of eggs.  Will make again.

This was a very simple, moist & delicious cake. I did make one change, just to cut down on the calories & fat. Instead of 1 c. oil, I used 1/2 c. applesauce & 1/2 c. oil. Thanks for the recipe! I will be making this one again....

Super simple to make this one. This was similar in taste to a texas sheet cake. Mild chocolate flavor. Light fluffy cake. This really needs an icing though as it is rather plain on it's own. I spread 1 1/2 c of peanut butter on the cake while it was still warm, after letting it cool about 20 min., then spread a layer of chocolate frosting over the pb layer when it had cooled. Thanks.

Moist.  Great.  I did alter a little.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Did grease pan.  Then I baked 1/2 time and put dark chocolate chips on the top then finished bake time.  Best cake I have had in a long time.  Will make it again.

Wonderful Cake, Moist, light and tasty and a nice chocolate flavor but not to much. I found it needed to be cooked about 15 mins longer than the recipe said, but it was a certain do again recipe 5 out 5 (although very sugary and 1/2 bottle of oil).

I would rate this a five but I had to tweak it after I made it the first time because it seemed like it was missing some richness - the second time, I added a melted dark chocolate bar, used strong coffee instead of water, half applesauce/half oil and added 1/4 c add'l cocoa powder and 1/2 c add'l sugar. This is my own personal taste but I feel it was spectacular the second time around. On the whole, the original recipe has a really great texture and I really am glad to have the recipe to adjust to my own tastes.

I made this for a luncheon at Valentine's, and I drained a 16 oz. jar of Maraschino cherries into a measuring cup (it made about 1 cup) and added water to make the 2 cups of water that is called for.  Then, I added 1 tsp. of almond flavoring.
I frosted the cake with extra creamy Cool Whip, decorated it with the drained cherries, and it was beautiful AND delicious.  Many people asked for the recipe.

I tried this last night and it turned out very well.  I've never made a cake from scratch before.  I made it in a 9x13 pan.  I was missing white vinegar so I took a friend's suggestion and actually added 2 tbsp of lime juice.  (probably should have been lemon but i didn't have that either)  Just need something citrusy (sp?) to counteract the amount of sugar.  Turned out well and everybody loved it.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!!! 

I used to just make cakes from mixes I got at the grocery store. I decided to try making one from scratch. so I came to Allrecipes, and found this recipe. I made it, and everyone loved it so much, my fiance asked me to make one for his Dad for Father's Day. His dad was only going to eat about half, and give the rest back so we could have some, but needless to say, we never saw a crumb of it :D

MOIST! I halved the recipe and made a batch of cupcakes. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes. 

This recipe does not require frosting and you likely won't miss it, it's that moist. 

I loved not having to have eggs on hand though the cupcakes were a little fragile because of that, but it made it more convenient for me.

I also loved the one bowl mixing, no beaters needed aspect. 

I will make this one again and again. Very chocolatey, moist and easy...it's a winner!

Absolutely fabulous cake!  I made the suggestions by a previous reviewer:  1 tsp salt, 2 tsp vanilla, and 3/4 cup oil.  In my oven it took 33 min.  Great flavor and texture.  My husband called it a "home run."  I will definitely make this again.

This cake had a fine taste but ended up dense and bit crusty on top and around the edges. I had cooked it five minutes less because I had started to smell a slight burning scent. So cooking the for the entire time would have made it crunchy.

I had a party to go to and wanted to bake something. But alas! I was out of eggs. After searching for a while, I discovered this recipe through the Chefling App. I had all of the ingredients, so I tried it. It was a hit! People couldn’t tell there were no eggs or butter. They were shocked when I told them that it was vegan! Great recipe!

This cake has become a favourite at my house. I first made it because I didn't have butter or eggs and wanted cake, but it is so easy and delicious that I now make it quite often and it's always popular. I dust the finished cake with some icing sugar and drizzle with a homemade chocolate sauce and it's easily as nice as anything you'd get in a fancy cafè.

Beautiful cake. Very moist and great taste. My husband says it's the best chocolate cake he's had in a long while. Easy to make too with only one bowl. Took it to a meeting. A couple people took a piece home too! Must be a winner. Will definitely be making this again. I didn't have a 9 by 13" cake tin, so I used a 9 by 9" inch cake tin. This made the cake deeper and didn't cook through in the 40 minutes, so I let it cook longer at a lower heat and it came out fine.

Ran out of baking soda, subbed with baking powder, ditched the vinegar and used hot water. 160 for 30mins. Very fine and smooth mouth feel. Can be used in stacked cakes, I guess since it doesn't have large bubbles because I used baking powder. Love this!

It tasted very floury, I don't think there was enough cocoa powder. I used a decent cocoa product too, made from a reputable chocolate company. It was also very sweet.

Otherwise it was simple enough to make. Moist.

To offset the floury taste, I made a very chocolate-y icing.

I have experimented with this recipe. For other ppl like me who don't think this is quite chocolate enough:

-I suggest 1.5 cups of cocoa powder (not 0.5 cups in the recipe)
-also reducing sugar from 2 cups to 1.5 cups was an improvement

-for something more adventurous, add 1 cup of crushed walnuts, it's delicious --> keep in mind it is less moist as a result though
-2 tablespoons of coffee (barely noted in the taste)
-also if baking as a muffin: adding 1 teaspoon of peanut butter into the middle of the batter leaves a pleasant surprise!

The first time I made this cake, I did it exactly to recipe except for accidentally putting in too much baking soda. Because of that, I think it tasted too strongly of baking soda.  Still, it was popular with the family and they ate every bite.  But it was really just too much cake and took too long to bake. The second time I made it, I halved the recipe, was more careful with the measurements and it tasted much better.  I also added a little cinnamon, because I think it intensifies the chocolate flavor. It's a great recipe to have on hand when you are low on eggs or milk and still want something moist and chocolatey .  This cake recipe is a keeper and I am sure I will make it again and again.  So good with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream (we had cool whip) on it.

This recipe turned out great! I thought it was odd that this recipe had vinegar in it so out of curiosity,I made a batter enough for 6 cupcakes... to my surprise, it´s actually better than previous chocolate cupcakes I've made! It´s chocolatey, moist, soft and very easy to make ... this is definitely going to be my go to chocolate cake and cupcake recipe...

Most chocolate cakes on this site taste like store bought ones which arent the worst  but if I go through all the effort to make a cake from scratch I want it to taste that way. This cake doesn't taste store bought and is very moist it hits the spot perfectly. I also added a bot of cinnamon and cayenne too. 9/10 would bake again :)

My husband has a life-threatening dairy allergy. Sometimes substitutions are easy to make, and sometimes they completely ruin a recipe. I was so thrilled to find a recipe that contained ingredients that were all perfectly safe for my husband. This cake is ridiculously quick and easy to make and it is insanely good. My son and husband request this recipe every year for their birthday cakes - in fact I'm off to make one now for my son's birthday today.

I made this cake to take to a  dinner party where the hostess is allergic to dairy products and it was a hit! It was very moist and chocolaty and delicious. I made a few changes to the recipe because I didn't have vegetable oil and vanilla. I used 3-1/2 tsp of baking powder instead of 2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp of coconut extract instead of vanilla extract, and 1 cup coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I baked it for 1 hour. Then I frosted it with dairy-free chocolate frosting. Yummmm!!

Very, very easy. Took me less than 10 min. from pulling out ingredients to drying off the mixing bowl. I used baking powder instead of soda and added more cocoa powder (I find recipes generally use too little cocoa for my taste). I finished it off with a simple icing made from powdered sugar, cocoa and water.

The texture is light, moist and soft and a bit crumbly. The flavour was OK, but next time I'll use part melted butter for flavour - using only oil is not quite good enough.

It keeps well, too. I kept it under lid, and even on the second day it was really nice, hardly stale at all.

I tried this recipe and was at first a bit dubious as to how it would turn out - I have found this a very cheap and easy cake to do working with people who have very little in the way of funds and often new to baking this is excellent.  Putting it all together and mixing is great for people of all ages and really simple. The cake is a big hit with everyone who has had it. Very chocolaty, rich in flavour and very moist. I am going to try this recipe using custard powder instead of cocoa just to see if it would work - I like to experiment and think this might make an alternative cake. I especially love this recipe as instead of water you can use a fruit juice such as orange or blackcurrant if you are planning to put toppings on top or inside - it is also great for people with lactose or egg intolerance so it is a handy tasty recipe to have on file highly recommend it.

Im enjoying a slice of this delicious cake while commenting. It turned out surprisingly very nice.  I will attempt adding a cup of cold coffee instead of just water as someone suggested earlier next time around and see how we go otherwise I will not change a thing to this recipe.
Cant wait to take some for other family members to try out. 5 Stars!!!

I've made wacky cake for years, I learned it from my Nana who grew up during the depression. I couldn't find her recipe tonight, so when a chocoholic gets a craving, Allrecipes to the rescue again! This recipe was really good! Since there are only 2 of us in the house, I cut the recipe in half and baked in an 8x8 pan about 30 minutes. Every wacky cake I've made, I always add a little extra cocoa powder(about a tablespoon) since that is what my Nana did. I did change up this recipe slightly, I used half water, half orange juice, and it gave the cake a fantastic flavor! If you like those chocolate oranges at xmas time that you throw on the ground to break, then try this with the orange juice! I made a quick glaze for this with some powdered sugar and orange juice. Even with just the 2 of us, I don't think this cake will last past breakfast tomorrow morning! Thanks so much for the recipe! :)

Not bad for a cake without eggs!  The cake was moist, chocolatey, and spongy.  But I'm still more of a fan of traditional chocolate cakes.  Good cake, but not sold on the eggless idea.

I used special dark cocoa and put in 3/4 c because most cakes are not chocolatey enough for me.  I also put in an extra 1/4 c oil to compensate...  its in the oven now, but the batter is delicious.  I agree on the salt, I think it is salty, I will probably leave it out next time as I used apple cider vinegar.

I made this cake and I love it! It was the easiest cake to make and i had all the ingredients on hand. This cake was moist and delicious. After reading other reviews I doubled the the vanilla and salt amounts and reduced the oil to 2/3 cup. Perfect!! Thanks for sharing!!!

I used milk instead of water in this recipe to make it extra moist but it stuck to the pan and fell apart.  So I crumbled it and added ganache on top... delicious!!!

No one in my family of 4 cared for this cake. I followed one of the reviews to use 3/4 of oil and 2 tsp. of vanilla. It is so heavy and not much flavor. I prefer light and fluffy cakes. I will not be making this again.

What a delightful, easy dessert.  I made it for Valentine's Day gift - quick, easy, moist, chocolatey, what else can you ask for.  The recipe was followed exactly- make sure that you use fresh baking soda - baking is difficult in high altitudes and this was perfect.  Thank you for the recipe.

I grew up on this cake, in my family it's referred to as "THE Chocolate Cake". My mom found the recipe in the newspaper (when eggs were hard to get during the depression). It was the B-day cake requested most of the time by my kids. You can just dust it with confectioners sugar if you like, but I make a homemade mocha-chocolate frosting, which my son said is the BEST combination. The frosting is light and fluffy, but this cake is a very dense moist cake (not light and fluffy). The only change (from my mom's recipe) is we always used cider vinager (I don't think it really matters). But it does NOT work to substitute applesauce for oil (as I read in one of the reviews). We LOVE this cake, and it's now on a third generation (my grandkids) asking for it when their B-day comes around!

This was delicious!! Very moist. Not sure what I did wrong though, because mine fell. It was like a molten chocolate in the middle but the other parts were very good. I added crushed walnuts as I am not a chocolate fan but I love nuts with any chocolate desert. It had a moist brownie flavor. I also added 1/4 cup more of cocoa powder. I also subbed out 1/2 cup of oil for 1/2 cup of applesauce. I melted some chocolate chips on top and then spread it across the cake and it is soooooo good. I gave it a 4 simply because I really think the additional cocoa was needed. Without the chocolate chips it would probably be good with confectioners sugar on top. If you like your cakes very sweet then you will probably need to add a bit more sugar. I also ended up cooking it for an additional 10 minutes because when I first tested it the center was too wet. This may have contributed to it falling. I had to set my timer for an additional 5 minutes twice.

As others suggested I made this with coffee (2 tsp instant coffee added to 2 cups boiling water, cooled) instead of water, and 1 tbsp of vanilla.  Delicious but not very sweet.  Thank you for sharing!

I grew up on this recipe - know in my family as Poor Man's Chocolate Cake"  because there were no eggs in it.  My mother always made a homemade chocolate/mocha frosting and to this day, every time I make it, the memories come back.  My kids love it better than a store cake or box cake!

This recipe is the same as one my daughter gave me called "Six Minute Chocolate Cake" only hers is only half the recipe and makes one 8 or 9 inch layer.  Perfect for a small family.  You can mix it right in the baking pan.  We sometimes substitute some or all of the water for coffee.  Great with raspberry jam heated to syrupy consistency and drizzled over top and a little whip cream.  Yummy!

I absolutely love this cake! I follow the recipe exactly and it comes out perfect every time.  As other reviewers have mentioned it is also great because it lacks all the most common allergens (except for gluten).  My mother is a teacher at a private elementary school and she has the kids make this as cupcakes whenever someone has a birthday, perfect for a school because it is mostly allergen free and it seems impossible for the kids to ruin, no matter what mistake they make it still turns out delicious, plus you can lick the batter!  Also, if the birthday boy or girl wants vanilla cake she leaves out the cocoa and adds extra vanilla, it makes a good, all be it not exceptional, vanilla cake too.

My sister is lactose intolerant, and we have spent a lot of time trying to find a recipe that works. When we tried this cake, we were amazed at how moist and rich it was. I make it all the time now, even without my sister! :) The only thing I would recommend is to substitute the water with 1 1/2 cups soymilk. Makes for a richer cake.

I love this recipe, over the past yearI have made this recipe at least dozen times!  There is a child in my daughters class allergic to dairy so make this for all her class parties decorated in the appropriate theme and do the same for my son's daycare where a child has an egg allergy.   I have recieved letters form both parents appreciating the effort to include their children in the celebrations.   A great reciped when you need to be allergy aware!

This cake turned out well. It was a darker color than I had expected, and a little dry but I may have baked it a little longer than I should have. I would cut back the cocoa and/or add a little bit more sugar as it was a little heavy on the chocolate and not as sweet as one would think a chocolate cake should be. Over all, it was good, with positive approval from my family (as this was a birthday cake for my husband).

Great recipe, easy and using practical ingredients. I used 2/3 cup hershey's cocoa powder because I read other reviewers who thought it needed more flavor.  I definitely did not want to over-do-it with vanilla extract, so I used more chocolate!  Also, I substituted 1/2 c veg oil for 1/2 c of plain (no sugar added) off-brand applesauce.  It was still moist, possibly less dense than it could have been if I had used all oil (but who knows?) and I did have a BIT of trouble getting it out of my well-greased spring-form 8" round cake pan.  No worries, I pieced it bake together and covered with icing ;-)  I could have easily cut the cake through the middle using floss while it was warm because the 8" round made it fairly tall.  But I ran out of time and just had to pour the Chocolate Ganache (also from this website) over the top.  Also, because I used a different size pan I needed to bake it longer- about an hour. I was afraid the outside was getting too crisp so I covered a circle of foil around outside while the center finished mostly. When it cooled the ishly-gooey center set up more.  The cake went over so well at the party and was served within a few a hours of baking.  Took me about 2 hours or more total (measuring, icing, etc). Lastly I had to use a REALLY LARGE mixing bowl...

It's a pretty good cake,it's not very sweet so it needs frosting.The plus side is that it's easy to make,doesn't include milk or eggs,and pretty decent in flavor and texture.

This cake is very moist. The batter itself didn't taste that good so I was starting to worry about this one while it was baking. I wanted to bake a layered cake so I used 2 9-inch round pans and 30 minutes was the perfect baking time. Next time I will not use this for a layered cake because it is so soft and moist that the top layer sunk into the bottom quite a bit. I'm giving in 4 stars because it wasn't as "chocolate-y" as I had hoped. I'm going to try it again and maybe add some more cocoa or melted chocolate chips next time because I love the texture.

This recipe worked great. I didn't have any vinegar so I excluded it and doubled the vanilla. Instead of a cake I made cupcakes and baked them for about 17 minutes. These turned out perfect.

Functional but a bit dissapointing; I followed it to a tee but it does indeed taste like one of those boxed mix cakes. Very easy though, but I wish the end product smelled as good as the batter did.

Don't be deterred by this ill-named cake, it is simply delicious. I followed the recipe as-is, adding an additional 1/2 cup of cocoa powder per the advice I read in other reviews and I was thrilled with the final result. It turned out perfectly chocolate-y. This cake makes my stomach smile.

I had to bake this cake for 50 minutes to cook it through. I followed the recipe almost exactly except for substituting milk for some of the water. This cake did not have much chocolate flavor, and the cake was not moist. It did not have much sweetness and definitely needs a frosting or powdered sugar. It also needs more vanilla and sugar.

This cake is delicious!  It is moist and light.  I did add an egg, just to give it some hight, I'm not sure if it really made any difference...  Next time I will try without any eggs and see if it will come any different, I will also substitue hald of the oil with applesauce to reduce the fat and calories.  Made it for a birthday party and everyone - kids and adults LOVED it and peolpe were asking for the recipe.  I love the fact that this cake is so simple to make.  It takes about 5 minutes of prep work , that's all!  Thank you for a wonderful recipie! I will deffinitley make it again

Very moist, nice flavor and not too sweet, but very hard to remove from a bundt pan, which had been well greased and dusted with cocoa powder.  My original plan had been to dust with confectioners sugar, but I was forced to hide the craters in the top by filling with frosting.

I have never before been successful at making a cake, and this one was TOPS!  Very simple recipe, and vegan to boot.  The baking time was substantially longer than listed.  Also, be aware that the cake rises a lot, so don't fill your pan the whole way up or it will overflow!

VERY dense. VERY good. We added melted chocolate chips to the batter and had to cook it longer to get the middle to finish cooking. By the time it was done, the edges were very crispy. The homemade chocolate butter cream frosting helped soften it up, though. :D We used 9x13 and it was the perfect size!

I made this recipe for a quick last minute dessert for a dinner I was hosting.  I was nervouse about the outcome, but it was a huge hit!  I served it slightly warm with chocolate frosting.  This cake was sooooooo moist.    I will make this again for sure.  The next time I will try substituting applesauce as I feel guilty eating a cake with that much oil.

Made this cake yesterday on a whim. it was FAB! My husband devoured a quarter of the cake by himself! I did sub 1/2 water, 1/2 milk. The cake was very fluffy and moist, with chewy brownie-like edges. I topped it with a homemade chocolate icing and toasted almonds. Will be making again!

This is the only recipe I've found that tasted almost as moist and delicious as the Betty Crocker cake mix. However, I made some alterations. Instead of water, I used 2 cups brewed (decaffinated) coffee, and I brought the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2. Very delicious recipe. A perfect 5 out of 5!

Delicious and so easy to make! I modified it a little bit. I used 1/2 cup oil plus 1/2 cup applesauce and put a creamy homemade creamcheese icing on it. I baked it in a 10X15 glass pan so the cake wasn't quite as high. YUMMY!

My little niece is allegic to dairy so i tried this cake.  It was very good and a big hit at her birthday!    Nice and moist and tasty though I did make a few chgs based on reading the other reviews - I added in an egg, used 1 C of cocoa powder and replace 1 of the cups of water with a cup of strong coffee.    Also I used canola oil since that was the only oil I had - so it was even healthier!  I made cupcakes, baked for 20 min at 350.

I made a few changes to the original and it came out great. I halved the recipe and made these changes: I used 1 cup dark chocolate chips and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips and reduced the sugar to 1 cup (I don't like it very sweet, it's the chocolate I crave). I didn't have white vinegar and used dark vinegar instead. And I baked in a microwave on Medium for about 5-6 mins and let it cool. Awesome with chilled milk!

I made this with spelt flour (wheat allergy) and it was delicious.  I loved the easy cleanup of only one bowl, too!  I've made this twice now and the only addition was a little bit of cinnamon because I always add cinnamon to anything chocolate I bake.  It is delicious!  Try it!

When I came across this recipe I was searching for the most powerful chocolate craving killer I could find and thank goodness I found it. I am not a major chocolate fan but I get those insane chocolate cravings every so often and I am glad to say I have the solution thanks to your recipe.

I usually make it, with just a few changes, for my diabetic friend. I substitute agave nectar for sugar and whole grain flour for white flour. it's delicious and we don't feel as bad as eating the regular version of the cake :)

At first I didn't think this recipe was too good...I had baked it in a large round and the top became crunchy and it took longer to cook (but that was likely because it was in a round pan).  So, slightly disappointed with its outcome, I shoved it in the fridge thinking that we may eat it if we're really hungry the next day.  The Next Day...it was moist after having sat in the fridge overnight...it was delicious!  I'm planning to make them again, this time though, they will sit in the fridge for a few hours before eating!

The cake was moist, but i couldn't get over the oily taste. Maybe i'll give it another try, but cut the oil requirements in half or so.

I altered this recipe by substituting the oil for applesauce. Based on other reviews, I also decided to add some brown sugar (about 1/2 cup) and a bit more cocoa to make it more sweet. The cake came out ok, but not great. It was still a bit bland. It was not moist but more of a spongy, drier texture. It was not my favorite recipe and will not make it again.

Very good cake, just like everyone has said "moist, chocolatey, soft". The only things I did differently was add white and dark chocolate chips and cut the oil to 3/4 C. I could still taste the canola oil in th cake, next time will try to use apple sauce instead

i made this tonight..my first attempt was a fail because i failed to read how you can't use it as a layer cake.  It didn't cook in the middle and it actually slid and fell on the floor (it was doomed from the start) it didn't land on the top so i used the cooked pieces and crumbled them into a pie pan and poured marshmallow cream over it and called it cake disaster.  The second attempt was perfect b/c i halved the batter into my 9 inch round and covered it with fudge frosting and ganache.  it made up for the lack in "chocolate" flavor from the cake it complimented it extremely well.
I will be using this again...It is perfect for sweet sugary icings.

This was probably the best cake I have ever made. It was so moist and ridiculously easy. It didn't last very long, lol, but I plan to make it again and again. Either a dusting of powdered sugar, or homemade cream cheese frosting is a nice finisher.

It's the best chocolate cake I've made, but it was a bit too oily for me.  My husband liked it, though.  I don't think it's chocolaty enough for me.  I used Duncan Hines Whipped frosting in a can to cover and that helped a lot.  Thank you!  I will keep this recipe and tweak it the next time I bake.

I made this for my sister figures b-day. what I did differently is just decorate it with TONS of blue/green/turquoise icing that was mixed with mint extract to give a mint chocolate flavoring. Thank you so much for posting such a simple recipe!

I just made this cake and I baked it in a bundt pan for exactly 40 minutes and it came out perfectly.  I had no problems getting it out of the pan.  Some people stated that it was very sticky and stuck to their pans.  I used my heavy Wilton nonstick bundt pan and it turned out perfectly after cooling in the pan for about 30 minutes.  After cooling I dusted it with a generous amount of powdered sugar.  I am so glad that I did that b/c this cake is not very sweet at all.  It is very moist and dense, but not very sweet.  I do admit that I always shy a little when measuring sugar, but even with the full amount it wouldn't be very sweet.  I thought about using all applesauce instead of oil next time.  Just to see what happens.4*'s worth if you need a quick, easy and fast baking cake.  Definitely glaze it or dust it with sugar.

After reading the reviews, i decided to add more cocoa powder and reduce the flour. And it turned out quite rich in flavor. Try to dust it with powdered sugar and drizzle it with chocolate ganache. Yum!

This is the best recipe for chocolate cake I have ever tried! It is so moist and fudge-like! I didn't even frost it, I just dusted it with powdered sugar and it was just fine.  My kids love it too! This is definately a family fave!

This is the exact recipe my Mom always made for my birthday growing up...she called it "Poor Man's Chocolate Cake".  It is my all time favorite with peanut butter frosting and when she has extra time, she makes a double layer cake with Kahlua Ganache filling!!! Heavenly!...and yes, it definitely tastes better if you make it a day ahead!  I made it recently and five days later, my husband said it still tasted amazing!!

It was the week before payday- no milk, no eggs, no butter, and I NEEDED a chocolate cake.  This is the recipe that saved the day!  Good chocolate flavor, great moist texture.  Keeps really well (amazingly, there is some left after 3 days).  We added in about 3/4 bag of chocolate chips to make it more exciting.  We will definitely make this again to go with our beans and rice for breakfast, lunch and dinner as we "count down" to the next payday!

Although i love the crispy top thanks to the oil, I missed the buttery flavor I felt it needed.  The other reviewers are right to say it's better sitting for awhile.  The flavors blend better after a day.  I'm glad I added more cocoa or else I think it would just be a brown, bland cake.

Delicious! Followed just a she said, people were raving. However 2 notes:

1) I had "spirit" vinegar, and it worked just aswell.

2) I had to leave it in over an 70 min for it to fully cook. Served next morning, so moist!

I made this cake because so many reviews said it was good with just powdered sugar on top.  I really thought that it tasted like it was missing something, no one here cared for it.  One good point - if you're looking for a vegan cake then it's pretty good but I would definitely frost it.

WOW.

I found this cake becuase I was in the mood for chocolate cake, but had no eggs or milk.  It came out perfect.  Everyone in my family loves it.  The taste was perfect, and it was so moist.  Wow.  I will definatly bake this again.

My first attempt at this also had the same problem of being still raw in the middle; but I found out that if you pour less of the batter in the cake pan (I did about half the second time) it fully cooked through.
With taste and texture, it came out delicious and fluffy. However after eating this, I felt really heavy and groggy for some reason (maybe because it just feels weird to know that I'm eating so much oil). The third and fourth cake I made of this had the same reaction with me.

It does need more chocolate, and taste alright.  It is also really quick to make.  I will not be making this again.

Taste was good, but not to die for, still not chocolate-y enough for my taste, and I added extra 2 tbsp of cocoa powder. Consistency was a little gooey and it took way much longer to bake, but this is probably because i made some changes. I will probably try this again, adding more chocolate of course. Thank you :)

Just made this cake today for valentines day.  Its awesome, I only used 3/4 cup oil and then I used 1/4 cup blackberry brandy. YUM!! It needs no frosting, I just dusted it with powdered sugar. This is a quick and simple recipe and VERY VERY good.

I made this because it sounded interesting, but I was happy when I noticed that it is vegan.  I topped it with an improvised frosting of baking chocolate, sugar, coffee, and coconut.  Delicious!

The cake does taste alot like a box mix. The only problem I had with it was the inside of the cake was very moist but the bottom was very dry. It's actually alot better after being refridgerated overnight also.

I decided to make this for my niece's birthday.  I made cupcakes instead of a cake.  I added 2 tsps vanilla, 1 tsp salt, and only used 1/2 cup oil. I also added 2 special dark hershey bars of melted chocolate.  Instead of vinegar, I used 2 eggs.  They came out really good!! Very moist and not too chocolately.  Tastes very close to the box cake mixes!

What a fantastically easy recipe. I loved the fact I only needed to use one bowl. This cake was certainly moist, not chewy though and after reading one or two reviews that commented the cake tasted less "chocolate-y," I added in more cocoa powder and just melted a chocolate bar to make the frosting. Otherwise, this recipe was great. Thanks for sharing!

The texture was great, but it wasn't a rich or chocolatey cake. Almost more like a chocolate loaf. I think it'd be a good base for a chocolate banana cake. 3 stars for taste, the convenience of not having to use butter or eggs brings it to 4.

Really, this cake was good...I used 2 8" metal pans and had a hard time getting the middle to bake, while the inside seemed "crispy".  Could have been that the temp should have been lowered since I was using metal instead(standard 9x13" is glass I think).  Will definitely try again and also use in a pinch as it was so easy and the middle was very yummy.  PS  I used 2 tbsp instant coffee in with the water and it gave it a deeper, more chocolatey flavor.

This recipe was very easy and made a great cake.  I added some orange zest, which worked well.  I would follow the suggestion of another review and make the cake two days ahead of time.  Time only made the cake better.

Oh sooooooo GOOD!!!  I can't believe how easy this was to make, and how wonderful it tasted!!  I did make one small change since it was for an adult birthday party...after it was cool, I poked holes in each layer with a toothpick and drizzled on about 1/8 cup of kalua.  It gave it an added depth of flavor.  I will definetly make this one again!!  Thanks

Considering the effort that went into making it, this cake has wonderful texture and flavor: moist and  not cloying at all! My 6 year old niece personally set some aside for, she said, "breakfast, lunch and dinner tomorrow". Thank you!

this cake is easy and quite delicious. the only downfall is evident in it's name: oil. the end product is rather oily. don't get me wrong, this recipe is definitely a keeper!
