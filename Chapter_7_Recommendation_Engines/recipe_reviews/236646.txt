This is a great recipe but, as the submitter, can attest to the fact that it would be almost impossible to get 64 servings from anything which fits into an 8x8 pan!  However, it is very rich and can serve quite a few because of that.  Please note that ingredients should read 1 1/4 cups crumbs - no idea where the other comes from!  Also, the chocolate doesn't have to be from those, or any, brand name products.

It tastes great! I used 1 and 1/4 packages from 1 box. I used 2 packages before I realized this, and used WAY too much. It was still delectable! Key lime fudge for sure!

Graham crackers need to be greatly reduced (ended up with 3-4 crusts instead of 1), and lime juice could be slightly increased to yeild a firmer set on the chocolate. Other than that, you have won over someone who really does not like white chocolate.

My whole family loved it! I had a few limes I needed to use so I made this and it was wonderful! I did put in 1/2 cup lime juice and a little extra of the zest. It was great! We let it sit all night and it wasn’t the same consistency as “fudge”. It held its shape but was borderline runny but it didn’t bother any of my people! I will definitely make it again!

We loved the fudge portion of the recipe!!!! That being said the crust is really good as well only problem being the amount of graham cracker crumbs needs to be cut in half. The crust was way to thick and not enough butter when I made.

I am new at making candy and thought this would be an easy one to add to my list. I kinda knew as I was making it that the graham cracker crust was gonna be way off...a whole box of crumbs to 1/3 cup of butter? Did I miss something? I should have used my instincts but I went with the recipe and have no crust on the bottom of my pie fudge. The flavor is AMAZING just have to try again to figure out how to get the graham crackers to actually stick to the fudge.

This recipe is delicious--but I recommend using all chips or all bars for convenience; I hate buying two different kinds of the same thing!

Very yummy!  Reminded me more of a bar than fudge...probably because of the graham cracker crust.  Tastes like Key Lime Pie bites.
