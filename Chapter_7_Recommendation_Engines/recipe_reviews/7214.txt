After i read everyone's very helpful commments, i changed the recipe - 3.5 cups pear processed, then half a cup of pears cut up into chunks. even then, i realized that the joy of pear is in the subtlety of its taste - the bread still barely tasted like pear. i also used 1.75c sugar and halved the cinnamon and used less than 2/3c oil - the extra pears made it wetter. could use a little more soda.  maybe some allspice. it's decent bread if you have a lot of pears...

I've made this bread for years now and everytime I make it, I get another compliment on it and a request for the recipe.  I make this exact from what your recipe says.  Its good with a cup of tea in the  morning.

This has a very subtle taste to be sure, but it is moist and sweet. I used canned pears which was time saver!

Not what I was expecting...a very good bread but very similar to zucchini bread, thought it would have more of a pear taste.

I received a basket of fruit as a gift and it had a lot of pears. No one in my family eats pears so I tried this recipe. My family loved it but I never told them there were pears in it and they couldn't tell. I left the nuts out of the recipe. It was very moist-almost tasted like my pumpkin bread recipe. I would make this again.

Great fruit bread!  Minced some ripe pears and had a tasty treat.  No other adjustments were necessary.  That bread was GONE.

This bread was delicious...almost sweet enough to be a dessert!  A hot, buttered slice is a wonderful way to start your day.  You will certainly enjoy this moist, flavorful loaf!

Pretty simple to make aside from grating the pears.  The bread was a bit bland though, no pear taste.  It would be good with a bit of jam or with milk.  I also thought it might taste nice with a brown sugar crumble top, kind of like coffee cake.

Very tasty and easy, but I didn't get much pear taste out of it--the end result was a little like carrot cake. Next time I think I'll increase the amount of fruit I put in.

Not bad for using up pears. I tried reducing the oil a bit, but they came out a little tough. Good flavour, though. Nicer warmed up in microwave.

I followed the advice of other reviews by adding nutmeg (really compliments the pear) & subbing applesauce for the oil.  I also used closer to 3 pears, pureeing one and dicing the other 2 rather than shredding.  Some reviewers said the bread lacked pear flavor - mine didn't.

I had super-ripe pears so I had a go at this.  Tasty and fairly wholesome with the following changes: whole wheat flour and whole oats for 2 of the cups of white flour; reduced the sugar to 1 c.; 1/3 c. canola oil and subbed vanilla yogurt for the remaining oil, cut the cinnamon back and added nutmeg and ginger; and added 3 slices of candied ginger that I minced and 1/4 c. of currants.  I made 22 muffins with the recipe which I baked for 25 minutes.  Topped them with raw sugar crystals for crunch and whole oats for decoration.  I just mashed the pears with a potato masher and drained the accumulated juice after it sat.  I will make this again.

I thought this bread was really good, however, I didn't taste the pears at all.  I could certainly taste the cinnamon.  But since I don't care for pears, my family does, it was good.  They liked it, I liked it.

I used a large muffin tin for this bread and it turned out so good. The cooking time was reduced to about 45 min. They were all gone in one day! I also put in some pear chunks near the top.

This isn't a new recipe, and the bread looks exactly like any banana bread would, but I liked using pear instead of banana - it was a nice change.  It sure didn't last long at my house.

We received some over ripe pears in a fruit basket and were unable to shred them, so pear mash worked just fine.  My husband and five children loved the bread; it was very moist and enjoyable. This is quite an accomplishment for my family, as out of the seven of us, only one enjoys the flavor pears.  Unfortunately, our Dalmatian pup (9 months) also enjoyed a loaf in a half by climbing on the counter top...

This is a very good tasting bread.  I used canned pears instead of fresh and just chopped them up.  The mix was a bit dry, so I added a little of the canned juice along with the pears.  It baked in the same amount of time indicated with the extra juice.  This bread is on the sweet side, but maybe that's because of the extra juice. I will make this again!

I baked this, without the nuts, for a local pear festival and won a first place ribbon!  It is a flavorful, moist cake-like bread.

Such a nice, moist, softly sweet bread. I used two cups whole wheat and 3/4 cup all-purpose flour. Next time I think I will use all whole wheat. I also used 1-1/2 cup Splenda in place of all the sugar, and 1/4 cup applesauce in place of the equivalent amount of oil. I used three Bartlet pears, still hard, that I chopped in the food processor. I baked it in four small loaf pans (but it would have fit in three) for about 35 minutes.

I just finished baking this bread and my husband ate half of it already!! I added some ingredients after reading several reviews.  I added about a cup more of pears, 1 smashed banana, about 1/8 of nutmeg, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and 1 tsp of vanilla to make the bread sweeter.

I decided to use this recipe and make muffins instead today, they turn out great. 
I had some left over pear puree, from making pear butter, so i used it as well. It is a great way to use left over puree. I set the oven to 325 and cooked the muffins for 35mins.

This recipe turned out wonderfully! The only change I made was that I added 1 tbsp. of vanilla instead of 2 tsp. I also chopped the pears instead of shredding them. My pears were very ripe so it turned out moist and fluffy. It also had a nice pear flavor. I think because of th fact that the pears were chopped so when you bite into it you get nice pieces of pears in each bite.... yummmm! PS... my daughter loved it as well!!!

Fabulous quick bread! I made a few revisions to the recipe though. As others suggested, I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup of white, and 3/4 cup of light brown. I also reduced the oil to 1/2 cup, and added two very ripe, mashed bananas. For the pear, I used 2 cups of pear purée, and also added 1 cup of white chocolate chips. It turned out fantastic - I will make this over and over again!

This recipe is excellent! The only thing I changed was that I used: 1/2 tsp cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cloves (only because I ran out of cinnamon!). It came out fantastic! I have to admit I was skeptical, but this bread is super moist and very flavorful. Yum. Definitely try this recipe. UPDATE: I have since made this recipe using canned pears and it is equally tasty, if not better!

Great recipe! I did make some of the same changes as others -- applesauce for the oil, added nutmeg, cut sugar nearly in half, substituted whole wheat flour, made into muffins (baking for 17 minutes)... All in all, I think this deserves 5 stars. Nice change to the usual banana bread.

I guess I am actually reviewing an apple bread because I couldn't find pear in the middle of winter in Tokyo.  I also substituted 1/2cup of the oil with apple sauce, and only used 1/2 the sugar.  But it's definitely one of the most flavorful and low-fat (after taking out the oil) and moist quickbread I've ever made.

Excellent recipe!  I "healthed" it up a bit by making the following changes: switch out two of the cups of flour for whole wheat pastry flour; add a cup of wheat bran for extra fiber; use 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce and 2 Tbs of canola oil instead of 3/4 cup of oil; replace one cup of the sugar with Splenda; leave the skins on the pears for extra fiber and nutrients.  I didn't have pecans on hand, so I used walnuts.  Also, I reduced the sugar/splenda to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 cups, and I still thought it was unnecessarily sweet.  I'll probably cut it down to 1 cup next time.  All in all, this was a delicious was to use up those pears!

I made this recipe just as stated. It was a hit with everyone who tried it.  I have shared the bread and the recipe with family members. The only suggestion I have is that it works better to use pears that are not overly ripe.

I made this last week as written and wasn't bad but tonight I made a couple changes that made these superb. First, no oil, used unsweetened applesauce. Second, 2 cups of chopped not shredded pears. Lastly, I added 2 mashed bananas. Such a wonderful blend of flavor of three fruits and I made muffins instead of bread.

I suggest using very ripe pears. Just like with banana bread, you would use very ripe bananas. This is how you get more moisture and flavor.

This recipe was pretty good use of an abundance of pears; although, it was a bit sweeter than I was expecting.  I did make a few changes though, as follows:  1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar, and 4 cups chopped pears rather than the 2 shredded.  I made 24 muffins with this recipe rather than 2 loaves.  Muffins are easier for my toddler to hold on to, and I found the consistency was more cake like and suited to muffins.  I would make this again, as we really enjoyed them but I may decrease the sugar a bit the next time.  Thanks for the post.  It was a good basis to put my own spin on it.

Moist and flavorful. I did make quite a few changes though. I added 2 ripened mashed bananas, 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar,1 cup whole wheat flour and the remaining flour white, used walnuts instead of pecans (out of necessity)and also added a pinch of nutmeg. My baking soda and powder were outdated which made for a flatter loaf. Be sure to check your expiration dates or test them using hot H20! No fizz no good. Overall very good and useful way to use up the abundance of pears in our yard. Will definately make again with fresh soda and powder. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent bread!  I used half whole wheat and half white flour, and I used half brown sugar and half white.  Also, I wanted chunks of pear in my bread, so I didn't shred the pears but rather cut them into big chunks (and used a generous two cups).  And instead of flouring my bread pans, I cinnamon-sugared them, which I find I definitely prefer for sweet quick breads.

Delicious. I halved the recipe and subsituted some wheat flour for the white. I used the two cups of pears even though I halved the recipe to keep it moist and very flavorful. I also just mashed the pears with a fork instead of grated them. It was uch easier and it still left some chunks of pear in the bread.  I also only used half the sugar.
Excellent made into muffins and cooked in about 25 minutes.

This bread was delicious and very easy to make. I make it often and alway get rave review. The only changes I made was to add almond extract and leave out the pecans because I do not like nuts. I also made it in a bundt pan. The bread was moist, sweet and delicious! I would take the advice of others and use applesauce in place of the oil for a healthier bread and perhaps cut down on the sugar a little. It was really sweet--very much like a dessert rather than a bread you'd eat for breakfast. I will make this often. Next time I will reduce the sugar to 1.5 cups and use unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil. I also don't shred by pear. I simply peel and chop.

Really loved this! I used more pears and instead of using 2 loaf pans I baked the whole amount in a decorative bundt cake pan! It came out looking so nice! Got some great compliments on it.

One of our favorite quick breads!  We often use up pears that have gotten a little overripe (by accident) in this recipe and it makes for a really moist bread!

Very yummy recipe.  I followed the measurements exactly omitting the nuts since a child is allergic.  I actually put the dry ingredients in a ziplock baggie and mixed them together and then mixed the eggs, oil, sugar, vanilla and pears in a large bowl and added the flour mixture to the wet mixture (instead of the other way around) and it worked perfectly.  Four pears shredded was all I needed and since the skins were so thin I didn't bother to peel them.

Loved this.  Great breakfast bread.  Used 1/2 amount of cinnamon and substituted ground cloves and nutmeg.  I also used 1/4 c oil and 1/2 c applesauce.  Next time I will try all applesauce.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  The house smelled heavenly while the bread was in the oven!  The only thing I changed was I added a dash of ground cloves, nutmeg, and all spice to the dry ingredients.

This was not a bad bread, but it did not taste a thing like pears at all to me.  It was not as moist as I would have hoped.  Good flavor, but not what I was looking for.

I chopped the pears instead of shredding. Also, I cut the oil to 1/2 cup and increased the pears to about 2 2/3 cups. Very moist and flavorful! No doubt I'll be making this again.

I have made this bread, as is or substituting walnuts for pecans, several times in the past couple months. It's so tasty and moist and gone in a flash. This is one of my most favorite recipies by far. I will make this again and again.

This was delicious and easy. I used the largest hole on my grater/grinder, and you can see the pears and taste them a little. The first day the bread tasted a little dry. We were away for 2 days and left the bread well wrapped on the kitchen counter. When we arrived home we each had a piece of the bread, and it was delicious and moist. My advice is to make the bread a day ahead of time.

Excellent moist cake with a subtle flavour (I increased cinnamon to 1.5 tsp and added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg) - I baked it in a large muffin tin and got 18 large muffins out of the original recipe.  I baked them at 165F/325C for 30 minutes and they turned out beautifully.  I topped them off with Caramel Frosting V, which made for a delicious combination.  My toddler and my husband loved these muffins!

mmmmmmm, i never had pear bread before! what a delicious, mellow taste. i can't wait to try it toasted! note: 3 large northwest bartlett pears gave me exactly 2 cups shredded. i gently rolled my grated pear in a paper towel to remove the excess moisture (don't squeeze dry). you can grate your pears during basic prep because they won't discolor through oxidation like apples do. many thanks angela, this one's a keeper!

Omg!  So delicious.  The only difference was I blended 4 ripe pears with one extra lg. ripe banana.  After everything was blended together I mixed in two chopped ripe pears!  My daughters could get enough!  35 min for muffin tins and 45 for mini cake pan.  Thank u for the awesome recipe!

Used less oil and sugar.  (Used diced canned pears instead of shredded pears).

This was good but should be called pear cake.  I was hoping for something more like a quick bread. Next time I will definitely decrease the sugar and oil as well as the vanilla.

I bought a bunch of canned pears just to find that my kids don't like them and since they're packed in heavy syrup I can't eat them.

This recipe was the perfect solution.  I doubled the recipe and used up four cans of pears!  You have to squeeze the syrup out well and reduce the sugar a bit (I used 3 instead of 4 cups in a double batch) to make up for the heavy syrup that's still in the pears but other than that not a single change!  :-)

They love it!  Thanks.

Delicious!  I grated my slightly overripe Bartletts without peeling them and the bread came out with a rich pear flavour. Perhaps this is not possible with other varieties of pear (ones with much thicker skins), but I would try to include some... fiber is good for you!

a great easy bread. I followed others advice and made the following substitutions: used apple sauce instead of oil. cut the sugar to 1.5 cups(don't cut it too much) add 1/8 tsp nutmeg, 1 Tbs vanilla, 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of orange zest.

I just chopped the pears and the bug hunks made it amazing.

This has become a MUST HAVE for my family at the holidays.  It is rich, moist, "cinnamonny", and always delicious.  I leave out the nuts for my family's preference, and fan out thin slices of fresh pear on top of the bread before it bakes for presentation.  A true winner!

I'm a pear grower in Oregon, so of course I love to make home made goodies of pear, and I also gift them.  This is a great recipe!  I added 1/2 t. cloves for a little zip.  I also don't peel the pears, just core and dice.  You will love it!

This is fantastic!  I peeled and shredded three medium pears, which wound up being slightly more than 2 cups.  I also subbed no-sugar-added applesauce for the oil and egg beaters for 2 of the eggs to make it much lower in fat.  Per other reviews, I used 1 Tbsp of vanilla and added 1/8 tsp of nutmeg.

This was great.  I made the following changes:
1. Reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups
2. Used only half tbsp cinnamon and added a half tbsp ground cardamon.
3. Added 1/2 cup or so golden raisins.
4. Baked as muffins for 30 minutes (made approximately 16 muffins).

I think the cardamon is really what made these muffins distinctive and delicious.

Cut the sugar in 1/2 and split it between white and brown and used applesauce instead of oil.  I also used my canned pears instead of fresh.  This is great!  Especially warm with some butter!

I had tons of over ripe pears to use and not alot of ingredients to hand.  So to make this I used half wholewheat and half self raising flour, 1 cup of white sugar, 1/2tsp cinnamon, 1/2tsp ground ginger, 1 cup of pear puree (I also mixed in one over ripe banana) instead of oil, 2 cups of choppped pears, a handful of chopped dates and a hanful of raisins.  Pretty yummy!!  I did find them still a bit sweet (even after not adding the full amount of sugar) so next time I'll just omit it.  I made 12 muffins and one loaf in total.

I took advice from another reviewer and diced the pears to try and get more pear flavor. Both my husband and I weren't all that fond of biting into the occasional cold mush... but to each his own. ;) The cinnamon dominated the taste anyway (which I like) so I'm pretty sure grating will be sufficient next time. It was very good (even with the chunks)! I recommend this recipe and will make it again!

This bread is delicious!! It rises really well so don't overfill your pans. I made everything as is except I added a teaspoon of ground coriander, which I think added a lovely depth of flavor to the bread. Will definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe this morning for our playgroup. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups regular flour, and some brown sugar in place of the white sugar. I baked it one hour, and would probably bake it about 55 minutes  the next time. In addition, I might even add more pear to it. Nonetheless, it is delicious! One of the little boys was sniffing and said, "Wow, it smells so good in here!" The moms and kids loved it - just about everyone had seconds (or thirds). I will certainly make this again!

A light and pleasant recipe.  I altered this recipe slightly to accommodate making muffins rather than bread loaves.  First, I halved the recipe which prepared dough ample for making twelve pear muffins.  Furthermore, I diced two ripe Anjou pears, providing exactly one cup of sweet pear fruit.  I omitted the pecans and added a pinch of pure maple sugar on the top of each muffin before placing in the oven for twenty-five minutes.  Homemade honey butter provides a pleasant complement to these muffins.

This recipe would be good with apples instead of the pears.  It was very good.  I substituted apple sauce for 1/2 of the oil.

I had some pears that were going bad and needed to do something with them quick...I came across this recipe, and gave it a try.  It was delicious.  My two-year-old called it "cake bread", which is a huge compliment coming from him (cake is his reference for anything sweet and good).  My only deviations from the original recipe--I didn't have pecans, so those were omitted, and I added a jar of baby food pears (4 oz) because I was afraid my pears wouldn't measure up to the amount required. Well worth trying!!!

I made a few changes to this bread.  I omitted all the oil and just used applesauce, and used 1/2 cup less sugar.  I thought the bread was sweet enough with that amount of sugar.  I also diced the pears up instead of shredding them so that i would have chuncks of pear through out the bread.  The applesauce changed the texture of the bread a bit, not as moist but overall this is a great recipe.  I plan to use it again!

This bread is absolutely delicious!  I made the recipe, as is, but without nuts (didn't have any on hand).  I didn't shred my pears as they were too soft so I cut them up and put them in the food processor.  A great way to use up your extra pears.  My husband loves this bread!  It had a cinnamon flavor with light pear overtones.  Yummy!

I am a relative newcomer to the bread making world, great winter weekend projects.  We had some pears on the verge of going south, so I tried my hand here--the family went through this bread like a hot knife through butter.  Just made it again today for Easter, but I did go off recipe now that I am getting to know my way around.  Went half and half on the flour using wheat, went applesauce instead of oil, brown sugar instead of white, doubled the cinnamon, added one more pear and two bananas.  Needs a bit longer in the oven, but great results.  Threw in some flax meal to make it seam healthy...

we got those huge pears from Harry & David as a gift and found this recipe. I decreased sugar by 1/2 c., increased flour by 1/2 c.,shredded 3 pears and drained in colander, omitted pecans--otherwise did recipe exactly, baked for 55 min, they came out beautifully, plan to make 2 more loaves today as gifts. Great way to use pears.

This is a very flexible recipe and a great way to use up all those pears on my neighbor's tree!  The taste and texture of the pears is a nice change from bannana and zucchini breads and the nuts give it some crunch.  My loaves had a rustic, old-fashioned look and taste.

It was a zip to use my apple peeler to peel and slice the pears; then I sliced the stacks of slices into quarters.  I used a heaping three cups of pears.  To improve the healthiness of the bread I used 1 C of freshly milled white whole wheat flour and 1 C. freshly milled spelt, as well as 1 C. store bought all purpose flour.  I followed other suggestions and used home-canned low sugar applesauce as a substitute for most of the oil and added 1/8 t. allspice, 1/8 t. cloves, and 1/2 t. ginger.  Next time I will add 1/2 t. nutmeg and leave out the allspice.  I used half brown sugar and half white, but next time will cut the sugar by 1/2 cup. I had no pecans so I substitued walnuts. I forgot to add the vanilla, so I drizzled the top with a powdered sugar/vanilla/milk glaze.

I divided the two loaves in half and distributed them to my taste testers.  My mom loved it but thought it a little sweet.  My four co-workers were crazy about it.  My neighbor loved it.  My lawn mowing kid ate it with gusto.  I really loved the heartiness of the flours contrasted with the soft texture and flavor of the pears.

I am planning to make more loaves this afternoon to freeze.  The horses loved the pear peelings and cores.

I used 1c. brown sugar and 1c. white. also I only cooked it an hour, and I think that was too long. It was very good, but would have been better if it wasn't overcooked.

Good recipe! We used seckel pears (sugar pears) and added ground cloves. The cloves really set the flavor of the pears off.

Everyone raved over the bread.  I ground the pecans a bit more and added cinnamon sugar to bake on top.  It added the flavor needed to carry the recipe.

I recently discovered that my picky toddler loves different kinds of bread so I've been creative in finding ways to put fruit or vegetables in my bread and muffin recipes.  I actually really liked this recipe.  I used three cups of pears.  The taste of pears is very subtle but the bread is very moist.

Pear flavor is minimal, but nice and moist! I only used two eggs and replaced some oil with water. I used four ripe pears and chopped them finely. It taste great, but its not the best bread.

Amazing!  I keep getting requests for this bread at work.  I've used it for a few fundraisers.  I use organic pears and it's now known as "Organic Pear Bread," it sells like hot cakes.  Some employees asked me if they could buy the whole loaf.  I wish it was healthier, but it's SO GOOD that I can't get myself to change a single thing.  Thanks so much for this gem!

YUMMY!!! Was a little skeptical about this one, but it turned out great. OK almost, I thought it was going to fit in one loaf pan and was cooking fine but after about 30 min it spilled, thankfully I decided to put a cookie sheet under it. Next time I'll just make 4 large muffins and the rest will go in the loaf pan. I didn't shred the pears either, mine were very ripe so all I did was mash them like making banana bread. The taste isn't so much pear but more spice-ish but tastes great either way. Will make this again though for sure and will add more pears. Might even try a variety of apple and pear together. Great recipe thanks!

I have many pears this year and have been baking up a storm. The only thing I changed was using Splenda instead of sugar, and it turned out wonderfully. Quite delicious.

This bread turned out very yummy! I was wanting to find something using pears since we have a tree out back and so many just go to waste. I did make a few changes, I had 2 small apples that needed to be used up so I shredded them, also decreased the oil to 1/2 cup and added 2 mashed ripe bananas. I don't use sugar so used splenda instead. 
I'll deffinatly make this bread again.

This is the first bread I have ever made, and it came out great.  I found this recipe while looking for something I could use the canned pears I've had in the pantry for a year.  This was delicious, moist, and was super-easy for a first timer.  I especially love that it didn't require a mixer.

Taking suggestions, I used all applesauce (no oil) and rather than decreasing the sugar, I used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown. I also chopped/diced the pears. This just cooled off enough for a taste--and it's just right--not too sweet, perfect amount of moistness/firmness. Others said this was too "light" for a bread, but I think it came out perfect. I mixed this by hand, so maybe that's why? The cinnamon is the main flavor, so next time, I think I'll use more pears (maybe 1/2 again as much). Thanks for a new and easy way to use pears!

Loved it!  Had never thought of using pears in a bread before finding this recipe, great way to use up some extra fruit.  Only changes I made were those suggestions in other reviews: used half oil and half applesauce, added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and increased cinnamon to 1-1/2 tsp.  Also used walnuts simply because they were on-hand.  Definitely a recipe to repeat!

I altered this recipe a bit.  I used  3 1/2 diced pears instead of shredding and I added a banana.  I also used 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2 cups and I baked it in 1 loaf pan.  I like a heavey, doey bread and this was more cake-like.  The taste was delicious, just a little light to be called a bread.

Growing up, my Grandmother always sent us a bottle of homemade pear jam no matter where we lived in the U.S.  When I saw this recipe for Pear Bread I thought of her and of how delicous it would go with her recipe for her famous jam.  Sure enough I was right...as soon as this bread came out of the oven, we spread slices with butter and her delicious pear jam!  I'm pretty sure we got a glimpse of heaven within those two minutes of inhaling this delicious treat!  Followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks so much for this delicious recipe!

Well #1, big banana bread fan and probably made the mistake of "assuming" this would be a sweet bread like that. Wrong. Eventhough lots of "sweet ingr." not a sweet bread and can hardly taste the pear. In fairness, this bread is light tasting and a good staple bread for maybe tea?  So to me, I'd put this in the CAKE category and add a frosting, which is what I did, and EVERYONE at the party loved it. I did have a plate of the "loaf pieces" and people couldn't believe it was the same recipe, hence why I think the "bread" compliments the frosting.  So I'm keeping it just to use up all the pears from the tree.

Pretty good, I made a few adjustments based on what I had available. Namely, the two cups of pears were a combination of pears, apples and bananas and the pecans were substituted with crushed gingersnap cookies. It is a good way to use up fruit.

This is an incredible usage of pears!!!!!  We have TWO pear trees in our backyard... I'm using up quite a few.  Today alone I made 17 loaves and froze them for some winter day!  Yum.  Co-workers raved and wanted the recipe.  This is now in my "favorite" section of my recipe box.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This recipe makes a nice, moist bread even though I completely substituted the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour. I added more pears (chopped, not shredded) than the 2 cups, which gave it more of a "pear taste", and the spices made the bread smell really good while it was in the oven. The recipe uses two 8"x5" pans which I didn't have. Instead, I used two 9" x 5" pans and baked it for ~50 minutes, and it still came out fine. I used chopped walnuts but will try pecans next time. This is a nice alternative to banana bread.

Very good!!  Even my very picky 7 year old loved it, and I mean LOVED IT!.  I used 3/4 cup all-purpose flour and 3/4 of whole wheat flour.  And the family still loved it and didn't notice the difference.

This is delicious and moist. I had never even heard of pear bread until I found myself with too many ripening pears. I used the AllRecipes search engine and plugged in flour, sugar, eggs and pears and there it was. So glad I found it.

What a nice loaf.  Very flavourful!  You need three pears even if you can get two cups from two I think.  This recipe works pretty well as muffins too.

Yum!  This recipe is fantastic.   I used 3 bartlett pears and ended up dicing them  (1/4 to 1/2") because shredding just made mush.   This put chunks of juicy, sweet fruit throughout the bread.  The pecans are a must - they add texture and great flavor.   Two other notes:  Mine baked faster than the recipe suggested (about one hour) and I sprinkled some coarse sugar (called Raw sugar in the supermarket) on top before baking and it made a wonderful, crunchy crust.   Next time I think I'll add some diced candied ginger to the mix. Give this recipe a try!

Angela, Your pear bread recipe beats any other sweet bread I've ever eaten. This bread was a big hit with my family. Everyone wants the recipe. I think the way one is to mix the dry then the wet and barely stir together is what makes it so moist. Positiveley delicious, and I am hard to please. thanks!

This bread has a very mild flavor.  My husband and I (and children) enjoyed the bread, however, other relatives thought it was a little bland.  It is subtle in flavor, but it really grows on you the more you eat.

This was so rich and delicious. Only thing I changed was adding a shake of nutmeg to the ingredients. Also topped the bread with thin layers of pears before baking.  I chopped the pears because I had soft ones that wouldn’t shred. Made another batch the next day with the remaining pears.

I didn't have that size loaf pan so I made muffins instead and only baked them for 35 minutes. I listened to others and added 1/4 C of brown sugar and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  I also used applesauce instead of oil and sprinkled white sugar on the top before baking to give them a crispy top! Broke the muffins in half when they were done and put butter on them! Huge hit! Loved them. Great starter recipe if you want to substitute apples, banana's etc.

Unfortunately, this pear loaf is very uninteresting. I definitely would rather make a banana loaf instead. Someone did say - the pear is kind of subtle or something , but I don’t see the point then really. 
I couldn’t possibly even gift it. It’s in the bread tin.

I've made 6 loaves  so far! The pears I used were from an 80 year old tree. Needless to say crummy for most things. BUT! the pear bread is divine, Definitely will be making a lot more to use the pears up and free. I think this is the last year for the tree branches are snapping off.

A moist and delicious bread even though I didn't have any pecans and only one cup of shredded pears.   I halved the recipes except for using 1 egg, 1/3 cup of vegetable oil, and 2 tsp. of cinnamon.  An excellent recipe!

There was just one addition not necessarily a change.  I used pumpkin spice because it has all the spice flavoring  you need.  Other than this addition, I made it exactly as the recipe called for.  It was delicious, moist, and a definite keeper.  The batter was perfect for my two small loaf pans.  We polished off one in less than eight hours.  I wrapped the second one in plastic wrap, but I suspect that it will be gone by the end of the day!!!!!  Great recipe even without a pear taste.

This is a tasty fruit bread!  During this season when pears are inexpensive, this bread is an easy gift to bake & take when visiting friends/family or when you want to share something at work around the coffee station. It freezes well, too. -Paula Akbari

Used a half cup of oil and a quarter cup of applesauce for a little healthier bread. Added chopped nuts too. Delicious! Also used canned pears.

It was very good fresh out of the oven. But it was VERY dry the next day. It had a good spice cake flavor to it. You really don't taste the pears at all. Ill make this one again!

This turned out great. Followed the recipe but was a little short of pears so added some cranberry sauce that I made at the same time.  I like it toasted with a little cream cheese on it.

This is incredibly good.  As written, five stars.  The second time I made it I made some adjustments to make it healthier, and it was just as delicious.  I used three cups of oat flour.  1 1/2 cups of sugar. 1/2 cup coconut oil, 1/4 cup non fat Greek yogurt (plain and vanilla both work well).  Added 1/4 cup ground flax seed.  Big hit with everyone.  Thanks for sharing!

Very nice bread. Mine was slightly overcooked :( due to my oven having an issue that needs to addressed. Other than that, I made some small changes to my liking. I replaced the oil with applesauce and cut the sugar to 1 1/3 cup. I also halved the  cinnamon but added a few pinches each of ginger, cloves and nutmeg, as well as 2 TBLSP flaxseed. I was short on fresh pears, so I added half a chopped apple to compensate. In place of the pecans I subbed walnuts, using a little less but still reserving some to put on top of the batter, along with some turbinado sugar. When dusting the pan with flour, I also added some cinnamon-sugar. This is a keeper that I'll be sure to make again, even trying other additions. Thanks ANGIEGAIL!

MY BELOVED AND I MADE THIS BREAD THIS AFTERNOON. WE USED OUR FOOD PROCESSOR TO SHRED THE PEARS AFTER THEY WERE PEELED. I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY THE PEARS WERE TOO JUICEY. AND THERE FOR REALLY MADE FOR A SOUPY KIND OF SHREDDING. WE STILL USED IT AND MADE THIS PEAR BREAD USING WHEAT FLOUR. ITS REALLY GOOD! WE EVEN MADE ONE LOAF FOR MY HUSBANDS PARENTS :) IT DOES NEED ALIL BUTTER BECAUSE WHEAT FLOUR CAN BE SOMEWHAT DRY. WE GIVE THIS PEAR BREAD 4 STARS. NX TIME IF WE MAKE IT AGAIN WE WILL USE SMALL THIN SLICES OF PEARS AND CHOP THEM UP AND ADD THEM TO MIX. WOULD ADD PHOTO,BUT ITS ALL COVERED :) MAYBE NX TIME.

Great bread!! Perfectly crisp crust complimenting the moist inside. It had very subtle pear taste so I'll be adding more fruit next time.

When I was stirring it felt stiff.  I added one cup of milk.  It came out moist and fluffy.  I also added slivers of pear down the top of the bread.  Nice touch!

This was absolutely fabulous! I used 2 cans of pears because that's what I had. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! I liked the chunks of pears and the subtle flavor it leaves on your tongue.  The folks at work inhaled it with many many compliments. It was moist and held together well.  I think next time I will use 1/4-1/2 cup less sugar, though.

I was very disappointed in this bread.  I realize that pear is a subtle flavor, however, there was absolutely no flavor of pear in this bread.  It's as if I made a sweet bread with no fruit flavor...tastes as if something is missing.  I even added more pear than the recipe called for, added some ground ginger and a bit of brown sugar.  Even with butter on it, it lacks flavor.  Sorry, I give it 2 1/2 stars.

Just made this bread. I didn't have any pecans. It is absolutely delicious. I had 3 pears going soft so I didn't need to shred them just cut them in small pieces. Also my oven may be off but I only baked for 45 minutes.

I thought this was phenomenal even though the pear taste was VERY subtle. I'm not so sure that I would add more pears though, I thought this was delicious as is...at least while it was still warm with some butter!

Not a bad recipe at all. I had a TON of pears that were not holding up so well in my fridge and had to do something with them and this bread was perfect. We omitted the pecans because of a nut allergy in the house and instead of shredding I just chopped up the pears into small pieces. Had a slice with a cuppa coffee right when it came out of the oven and was moist with a nice taste. Thanks for sharing!

I used 1/2-Splenda and 1/2-sugar.  I also substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  The bread turned out delicious.  The only reason I ranked this 4-star is because of the texture of pears in bread.  My family got caught-up in the graininess of the texture that pears present.

This was a good way to get rid of pears, but as a bread it was more cinnamon-spice flavored than pear.  I think I still prefer zucchini, pumpkin and banana breads to this one.  It was a great experiment though, and it was easy enough to be worth the effort.

wonderful recipe :)  i made a few variations after reading other reviewers- cutting down to 1c sugar, applesauce instead of oil, and increasing the amount of pears. i look forward to making this over and over again.

Very good flavor.  I chopped the pears up fairly fine as they were too ripe to grate, but a couple whirls in the food processor or mashing a bit with a fork might be better (and faster).  I will definitely make this bread again.

Yummy,different, very moist and tasty.  Baked it in 4 small loaf pans and reduced the time as I wanted to freeze some.
A definite keeper and I liked pecans, wouldn't substitute walnuts.

Very good! I thought there was too much cinnamon the first time I made it so the second time I subbed a half tsp of cinnamon with 1/4 tsp each of cloves and nutmeg. Perfect!

I was looking for a way to use up my pricey gourmet pears which were overripe, and this was it!  I thought this bread was merely tasty, but several of my coworkers said it was the best quick bread they'd ever eaten.  This from an office that eats a lot of quick bread.  Wow!

I didn't think Pear Bread would have much flavor but I had alot of pears to use up. I was pleasantly surprised. It is a moist and delicious bread. My husband loves it.

So good.  I got lots of compliments.  I love to keep a loaf on hand in the freezer.
