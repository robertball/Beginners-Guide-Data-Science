Flat and dense. Maybe I didn't beat it enough? It didn't specify the beater speed. I wouldn't make again.

Very easy to make.  The cake rose beautifully.  I beat the eggs really well first, then added the rest of the ingredients and beat in my stand mixer for about 1 minute on medium high.  It's rather a dry cake - I think it needs a an icing drizzle of some kind.  Some cakes get more moist after sitting overnight and if this one does I will add to this review but right now it needs a cup of tea or coffee to go with it.
