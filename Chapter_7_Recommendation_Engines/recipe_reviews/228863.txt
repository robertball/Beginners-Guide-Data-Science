After a long day of slaying rampaging bunnies or fighting off the asparagus demon from the land of no refunds, nothing will perk you up quite so well as these brownies. If it is your decision to use this recipe that has been stolen from the gods of the porcelain throne, be aware that you can reduce any amount of strong coffee to the required amount. And with that I leave you, for I must now go forth to conquer, pillage and burn down that infernal zone known simply as the shore of Jersey. So Sayeth the Mustard Pimp

These are really good. I didn't change anything as I wanted to experience the full coffee flavor..Only issue.. it took a LOT longer then 30 minutes to reduce 8 cups of coffee to 2/3 of a cup . I made the reduction the night before and then threw the brownies together quickly the next morning. I don't think these would be good for kids as they ardent very sweet and the coffee taste is quite pronounced.. which is good for me

i made the recipe as is, nothing added or taken out... it's good just seems to be missing a little something. perhaps the chocolate chunks or maybe a toffee glaze would serve the coffee taste some justice. 

i'll be trying them again with the modifications soon , very soon!

This was a wonderful recipe to start with, but I added a few changes for extra flavor: I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and about 1/4 cup more of unsweetened cocoa powder, because I like my brownies extra sweet and chocolately! I also added a dash of cinnamon for flavor and instead of following the recipe's coffee instructions, used 2/3 cup of regularly brewed coffee I had left over from the same morning. 
These are great, super moist brownies! 
Thanks so much for the recipe!

I like my brownies fudgy so I did the following: A) used 1 egg and 2 egg yolks B) used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 brown sugar C) added in chocolate chunks. The coffee reduction took too long for my liking but overall it was a VERY tasty, perfect ratio of chocolate to coffee fudge brownie.

Although like everyone else said the time to reduce is much longer it is worth it. These are the best brownies I've ever tasted. I used Hershey dark cocoa powder which almost made them  black but the taste is incredible. Will make again. Thank you for the recipe.

I made these according to this recipe except for adding in 1 egg yolk (I like my brownies very dense). My first issue with this recipe is reducing the coffee. Extremely time consuming, and it took me almost an hour, not 30 minutes. Then letting it cool to room temp? I'm sorry, I don't want my brownies to take 3 hours to make! When they were finally done, I do have to say they were delicious. The coffee taste is definitely there, without being too overpowering. But does it really justify all that time spent? I'm not too sure. The only issue I had with the finished product is that they were still a bit too cakey for my liking, but I think that could be fixed by using just a little less flour. I can definitely tell they're caffeinated, so don't eat too many before bed!
