I am SOOO glad I took a chance and tried this recipe. I was a little skeptical about the ingredients (mostly the part about eating raw zucchini!), but it is awesome! Light and summery, with a great flavor. I brought it to a party and everyone loved it (and I'm pretty sure they weren't lying- haha!). I used one green and 2 red apples and followed the recipe exactly- no changes are needed. Please give this a try- you will be pleasantly surprised! (also- I used one medium zucchini though you could certainly use 2... 2 medium is better than one large zucchini so you can avoid all those huge zucchini seeds)

Yummy! I used yellow squash and zucchini added even more color. I only had 2 apples but wish I had all 3. I agree that it needs to marinade at least over night!

I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand, and so substituted champagne vinegar. Honestly, it was not a bad salad, but it didn't hit a chord with any of my family. Maybe the red wine vinegar is critical to this dish. I wouldn't let my experience stop you from trying this salad. It has merits. It is crunchy, tart and sweet. Maybe it will be better tomorrow. I served it after only one hour in the refrigerator. I think it would benefit from another textural element. Everything in it is crunchy.

My previous review was cut off. Some of the add-ins I thought of besides pickled artichokes...were some type of bean (garbanzo, red or black bean), avocado, or perhaps mandarin oranges.  I would try walnuts, sunflower seeds or pine nuts (if you want more crunch).  Has anyone tried anything ? I saw cranberries.  Great just the way it is though!!

I was very surprised on how good this recipe turned out.  I too was hesitant to put these ingredients together, but all and all, it was a good, fresh, and tasty salad!  Used red pepper since its sweeter and Vidalia onion.. Used olive oil and white wine vinegar since these are the things I had in my pantry.  Turned out great!

I loved it! and my husband (the picky one, told me it was awesome!) 
It is not so sweet, neither dry or oily because of the dressing... the perfect flavour and notes of the green pepper.

This is a good fresh recipe for using up the zucchinis and apples in season. I made 1/2 recipe and we both liked it. I used red bell pepper and yellow onion because that is what I had on hand. I gave a bit to my husband for lunch and told him it was zucchini apple salad. The title did not excite him but, he said it was better than he thought it would be. The rest is marinating for dinner. Season it to taste.

The recipe description says it all. I let it sit in the fridge for about five hours and stirred occasionally to distribute the marinade. I cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon because that's what I do, and used 3 teaspoons of fresh basil instead of dried. Otherwise, I followed the recipe, using Royal Gala apples. It was delicious!

I loved this salad and will make it again for sure.  We have yellow and green zucchini, oh sooooo many, so good way to use up a couple of larger ones.

I use olive oil (we have an olive orchard and harvest them for the oil) and fresh basil from the garden, and also substituted the red wine vinegar with a fig balsamic.  I let that sit in the salad about 4 hours before our first taste and it was delicious.  I think many variations would be easy with these base ingredients, so I am anxious to try some more.  I have some peaches ripening, and the onion flavoring with the peaches sounds great too.  Great recipe.

Simple and delicious. I used a honey crisp apple and fresh basil instead of dried. This recipe was quick and easy - a colorful salad to accompany summer cookout foods. I'll be making this again!

Easy to make.  I have now taken it to 2 potlucks and people just rave about it and ask for the recipe.  I make it just like the original recipe.  It does make a lot of salad so it is a great option for a potluck.  Each day it marinates, it just becomes better.

I liked the recipe, but I would not put in all these sweet apples.   I did use a pear as I didn't have the three apples on hand.  it also needed more vinegar as it was not tart enough for me.  I also put in nice parsley which gave it a little more flavor.

I omitted onion and let it marinate for 8 hours and it tasted great! I might add dried cranberries next time too.

I looooved this recipe! I made a few changes based on what I had. I subbed cucumber for the green pepper. I added beans to make it a main dish. I used balsamic vinegar instead of the wine vinegar and didn’t add the sugar. It was so tasty! I can only imagine how wonderful the recipe is as it’s written. I’ll be trying that soon! I never would have thought to put zucchini and apple together like this. Thanks for the idea!

This is an amazing salad - especially if you DON'T like zucchini.  I took it to a potluck and everyone thought the zucchini were cucumbers!  It was a hit...and an even bigger hit when folks found out it was made with zucchini!

This is a delicious way to use up zucchini! I do agree that he salad could use another texture. I boil pasta while putting together he fresh produce ingredients; fargalle and penne both work great! I also want to try adding rotisserie chicken to make it more of a meal cause that would be yummy too!

I made this according to the recipe and found the onion and pepper became soggy and overpowered the dish after marinating overnite. I made it again, left out the onion and pepper, and added 1/2 cup celery.

MUCH BETTER!

I now use this salad and just use 18 year old balsamic vinegar. I just found out about this vinegar.  If you haven't tried it you need to because it is sooo good.  I got mine at one of those specialty oil and vinegar shops you see at tourist towns.  The salad does taste better after the veggies and fruit are cold.  So if you want to get rid of the oil, try it.

I am always on the lookout for different summer salads, especially ones without carbs. This is an amazingly healthy and scrumptious option! It has become  one of my family’s favorites overnight. It’s an unusual combination of savory and just slightly sweet, and goes perfectly with grilled chicken. I will be making this often. Perfect exactly as written!

Colorful and fresh delicious summer salad! I am so glad I read some reviews before serving. It definitely tastes better after marinating in the fridge for a few hours. I also served on bed of baby spinach (trying to get those veggies in). Great for office parties or get togethers.

Who would have thought to combine all of these ingredients would create such a great summer salad. It was great. I served it with hamburgers.  I did peel the zucchinis and used super sweet apples, honey crisp. I’m taking this to our next office potluck for sure.  Thanks for sharing!!!

This was great!  Simple, fresh tasting.  I did not have the Red Wine Vinegar, used Apple Cider Vinegar.  Suppose you could have used any vinegar.  Three different Apples.  One Granny Smith is a must for me, nice and tart.  Served after 4 hours and again the next day.  Seems to be best to leave overnight.  Anyway I'll make this again, but get some Red Wine Vinegar first. Thanks for the Recipe.

Eh...  Not really our cup of tea.  It didn't sound like a good mix, but reading the reviews, I thought I'd give it a try.  Kind of sad that I did.  It was something different, but we didn't care for it.

This turned out so well!  I was a little skeptical at first but it is really yummy. I used red delicious apples, a whole orange bell pepper and white wine vinegar instead of red.  I think next time I might add walnuts or pecans.

Loved this salad, as did my adult family.....but I added lots more vinegar, more basil, one more tsp  sugar and salt and used 1/2 canola and 1/2 olive oil for "vegetable oil".

Great salad and easy to put together! I used apple cider vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar because that is what I had in stock. I was hesitant because of the raw zucchinis but we all loved it.
I made it several hours in advance and kept it in the fridge to marinate.

So easy and tasty, the dressing is perfect as written. I may try it with fresh basil next time, and switch out the type of apples I use, depending on what I have. This is really nice!

I used 3 medium zucchini, 3 small gala apples, grapeseed oil instead of vegetable oil, and fresh basil. I used a hand-held spiralizer for the zucchini, and a food processor for the rest. It is very tasty; I will definitely make it again.

I wasn't sure about this combination, but was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't have red wine vinegar, so substituted with apple cider vinegar and it turned out great.  I didn't have any green pepper so didn't add that, and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Will do again since I have apple trees and zucchini growing on my property.

I've made this dish twice now in a week's time. Once for home, once for work. Will be making again for family reunion this weekend. So easy! I used 1 TB white vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. Adjusted the amount of red onion down a bit. Used fresh basil leaves instead of dried.

Easy and delicious. Used half zucchini and half yellow squash and added shrimp for protein. Light and refreshing summer lunch.

We ate it freshly made and liked it very much.  I had not chilled it, and I made it exactly as written.  My husband said it is a "keeper".  I will definitely tell family and friends about this one.

I really love this salad.  The only thing I changed was I used red pepper instead of green.

I wasn't crazy about this salad.  I think the basil didn't work well. Next time, I would use the same ingredients, but just toss with a vinegar-based dressing from a bottle.

This is very good,  I made this a "raw" healthier dish by leaving out the sugar and used apple cider vinegar and olive oil.  Fresh, Crisp and very TASTY!

I loved the combination of the apple and zucchini. I think that beyond that, you have the option of adding a lot of things. The only thing I changed was that a yellow pepper instead of green and  I added about a tablespoon of chopped mint and juice of half of a lime- for some added punch. Will make this again.

I made this for a potluck at work and it turned out good. Make it the night before though to let everything marinate.

The only problem I had was that this makes a LOT of salad, so I ended up with quite a bit leftover. It held up pretty well, but I can only eat so much of this salad in a week and my husband is allergic to apples, so he was no help. Otherwise, yum!
