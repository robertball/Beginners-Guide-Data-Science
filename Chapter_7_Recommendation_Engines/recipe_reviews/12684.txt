It was very good but not as flaky as I though it would be.

Beautiful and flaky. Hubby loves it!!! But I do have a question, can you freeze this dough.  I would love to make this and divide it into individual crusts because I make usually a pie or two a week

Happy to find this again, used it years ago and had since lost it. I'd make it plain for my dessert pies, but I look forward to trying it flavored w/ Mrs. Dash Garlic & Herb for another layer of flavor for my pot pies.

This worked pretty well for my chicken pot pie. It was the first time in my 50 years that I made pie dough from scratch!
