I only made changes because I didn't have all the correct ingredients. Thankfully this recipe is very forgiving. I substituted black beans for the pinto beans, white rice for the brown rice and a packet of taco seasoning instead of fajita seasoning. Super easy to prepare, easy to serve and it didn't destroy our kitchen. My wife and I really enjoyed it. I will make this one again!

Love this dish! But to make it better add fresh cilantro, lime juice, and salt to the rice.

Cut way down on fat - used a bit of oil, ground turkey instead of beef. Did not need to cook rice ahead of time as I added 1 C instant brown rice with 1/2 C water and an undrained can of diced tomatoes with chilies and cilantro and let simmer (covered) until rice was done. The rice absorbed the liquid from the tomatoes and salsa.

I only cared for this just cooked. It is very different than a burrito places burrito bowl. It is more like a healthy scratch recipe for a hamburger helper with beans instead of the noodles. I used lean beef and simple subs I had to make were using chicken taco seasoning for fajita seasoning, kidney beans for the pinto, cooked farro for the brown rice, and I made my own homemade fresh salsa today with tomatoes, onions, green peppers, etc. I have to admit I liked it best before adding the cheese. It tasted much better on top. I later added extra homemade salsa to bring back the fresher flavor and a little extra seasoning. Just be careful with the seasoning if not wanting too much of a salty flavor. Either way, it made for a quick meal on a busy day, and I don't normally consider hamburger dishes high fiber ones.

It was very bland so I added more of the fajita seasoning and some diced green chilies; very easy to make and serve over lettuce as a salad.

Used Crockpot pressure cooker to cook meat. Dumped meat out to drain, cooked rice in cooker. Returned meat to cooker along with all other ingredients. Put on "Keep Warm" while I made a spinach salad. Wonderful and easy dish to make.

I don’t eat much Hispanic food but my husband loves it. I made this with a few changes
I used hot Italian sausage instead of beef
I added chopped onion and garlic
I also added a small can of jalapeños. 
Hubby rates it a 10!

I almost prepared this as written, I had homemade charro beans instead of canned so that means mine probably has more seasonings. It was quick and easy and we all enjoyed.
