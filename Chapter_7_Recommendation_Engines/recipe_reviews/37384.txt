The BEST KING CAKE!  This was the best K.C. I've made.(teens agreed!)  I make one every year.  Best if eaten in 2 days.  I paid special attention to the room temp. and the temp. of 1st four ingredients matched the water temp. on the yeast package (115-120 deg), not the recipe temp.  Filling:  Substitute half of the gran. sugar with lt. brown sugar and I added pecans.  Can be sub. fruit filling.  Also, I filled it differently.  I rolled it out as suggested, and put filling across the center covering 50% of the dough then I folded the sides to the center and lightly pressed ends together and twisted the dough in the traditional method.  To twist:  grab the short edge(end) of the dough and turn(wind) about 3 times then wind the other end abt. 3 times in the reverse direction.  Lift the dough near the center and lightly shake to move the twisted rings into position, trying to keep the center filling seam on the inside of twist. Bake on a pizza pan.  Also, I use a butter cream or cream cheese frosting.  Suggested frosting is very sweet and on top of that, you are pouring on sugar!  Woo!  I never cook the cake with the baby in it.  I push it into the bottom of the cooked cake.  Half recipe to make just one cake.

This is the best & easiest king cake I've ever made. Even better than the ones shipped in from Louisiana!  I tried Emeril's recipe last year and this recipie was better!  Highly recommended!

having lived in louisiana for 13 years, i was excited to finally make my own since i live in cincy and haven't found any i really like here. at first, i wasn't sure if i did a good job, but the more i ate it, the more delicious i realized it was. i made a few mistakes as a rookie - i took the advice of folding it together, then twisting it instead of jelly-rolling it and i didn't do it tight enough. so some parts were too fat and where it came together, too skinny. but otherwise, it looked authntic. i also split the sugar b/w white and brown and added some pecans as suggested. yummy. i will try the cream cheese filling next time. i also bought the icing but colored my own sugar. it was so easy, i just couldn't justify the expense of buying the colors premade. now if i can just figure out how to fill it with bavarian cream - my favorite king cake filling ever.

This recipe produces a king cake that compares very favorably with the many bakery versions I tasted while living in New Orleans.  The icing/decorating instructions, however, are far fussier than what they do in the Big Easy.  Usually, they put a thin layer of white icing just on the top, then sprinkle it with a little bit of colored sugar.  I did this and ended up using less than half of the suggested icing and maybe 2 tsp. of each colored sugar.

I twist both of the cakes together to make a larger one and bake for 25-30 minutes.  To decorate I make 2/3 of the frosting (still a lot!) leave it uncolored and use store bought sugars because they are brighter than my homemade attempts.

People.  This is good king cake.  This recipe is a WINNER.  As a antive Louisianian, I've eaten king cake all my life, and like the others here have said, this recipe is top-notch.  This is as good, if not better than anything you can buy down here, or for that matter, anywhere.  And it's also fun to make.  Most certainly a 5 star recipe.

This turned out suprisingly well, considering I'd never baked with yeast before.  For a filling, I used cream cheese mixed with powdered sugar - very good!!  Next time I'll use cream cheese frosting too.

This was very good.  FOllowed recipe exept for frosting. I not color it and I did have to add quite a bit more milk to get a good consistency to drizzle on cake...also I bought colored sugar to save the hassle of using food coloring.  I bought a little plastic baby and stuck it in the bottom of cake after cooking.

Growing up in Louisiana, i've tasted a ton of king cakes.  This one definitely was right up there with the best of those.  I used store-bought icing and just sprinkled the colored sugar over it.  Very moist, very tasty, and very gone.

This came out beautifully.  I was out of sour cream so I used heavy cream w/lemon juice added and it worked out wonderfully.   I added some vanilla extract to the dough and a touch of cinnamon as well.  I also omitted the raisins.   My husband and roommate both loved this.  Its not terribly sweet and will be wonderful with coffee in the morning.

This was my first attempt at a king cake.  I took it to a party and everyone loved it.  Very good presentation.  

The dough is very easy to work with and I plan to use it for cinnamon rolls.

This recipe is delicious.  I made my cakes without the colored icing, and added more coloring to the sugar topping.  It's really easy to make, too!

This was excellent. Everyone enjoyed this after our Mardi Gras dinner. I colored vanilla frosting instead of making it from scratch.

This has been my favorite of all the King Cake doughs I've tried, probably because it's the most like a cinnamon roll dough. It's tender and easy to work with like those. The filling didn't really thrill me, as I prefer brown sugar or a cream cheese filling, but really the filling is the easy (and fun!) part to modify. I do always add more filling to King Cake than the recipes imply, just because I like it. Thanks for the recipe, Southern Living magazine!

I made this recipe more healthy by using fat free yogurt, reduced fat margarine, half Splenda and half sugar, and half whole wheat baking flour, half white flour, and the results were fabulous.  Instead of cinnamon/sugar, I filled the cake with a fat free cream cheese, banana, and pineapple puree.

I lived in NOLA for a few years, and really missed the King Cake.  Last year, we got one delivered from Haydel's and it was great.  This year I forgot to order it until it was too late, so (with the help of my mom) I tried this recipe instead.  It is awesome.  It's super-moist and delicious.  I don't think I used quite as much sugar on top as the recipe called for, but I definitely used more than enough ;)  

Like other folks, I didn't bother to color the frosting as most NOLA bakeries don't seem to do that either.  The coloring from the sugars, however, will spread into the frosting a bit.  I cheated and crushed large decorative sugars from the store to use on this cake.  I think I should have used an egg beater or something to make the frosting, however, as mine came out a little lumpy.

This is the real deal. Relatively easy and very tasty, especially with the tweaks recommended by other users like using pecans and brown sugar in the filling, this is a winner. My only additional tweak is that I would double the filling recipe next time to better the filling-to-dough ratio. I've got 40 New Orleans Mardi Gras under my belt, and even though I live in Texas now, this recipe tastes like home.

The first year my restaurant location was open during Mardi Gras, I brought in king cake for everyone (2/3 of the recipe). The next day, there was none left over. 

This year, I carried on the tradition. Although I wasn't scheduled to work until the evening, I brought it in before lunch so my day shift could enjoy it as well. They were given explicit instructions to make sure there was enough left over for  the evening crew. When I arrived at 4pm, they were most unapologetic for leaving just 3 pieces for 8 employees. Definately a winning recipe! (And next year, I'm giving one  to day shift and one to evening shift, and making an extra recipe for myself!)

I live in New Orleans, and while there is no substitute for a Randazzo's king cake, this one is decent.  It was a little dry with just the cinnamon and sugar for filling.  I added some chopped walnuts and a little butter, and it was a little better.  I also used the basic recipe but with cream cheese beat with powdered sugar as the filling instead, and this king cake came out very moist and delicious.

This cake was exactly what I was looking for.  I made 3 cakes, taking one to my son's school, sending one to my husband's office, and keeping one at home.  Everyone everywhere loved it and wanted the recipe.  One lady my husband works with asked if I would make her king cakes for next Mardi Gras.  These were as good as any of the cakes I've bought in New Orleans, and you can add any filling you'd like.  Very good recipe.  Thank you!

Everybody loved this at my parent's Mardi Gras party. I made this with reduced fat sour cream and it still tasted rich. I bought icing and only iced one cake. Most people preferred the uniced cake.Absolutely delicious, won't wait for Mardi Gras to make it again!

I made this recipe for my students when we discussed the history of Mardi Gras.  The kids thought that this was the best thing that they had ever eaten and even asked me if I would make it again for the next day!  I will definitely use this recipe again!

This turned out just like the King Cakes I had in New Orleans. To save on time, skip the step where you color the icing, it really isn't necessary because of the colored sugars. The ones in New Orleans usually have just white frosting with colored sugars anyway. I'm going to keep this recipe forever!

This recipe was pretty close to our King Cakes in New Orleans.  Instead of coloring my own sugars, I just picked up some from the arts and crafts stores in the cake decorating department.  It was a very nice substitute for the one from New Orleans.  Thank you!

excellent cake! Lots of fun making this with my hubby and 4 yr.old.  I doubled the filling and used brown sugar instead of white and also added pecans.  We will make this again!

I have had a king cake for my birthday every year of my life... until recently. When I lived in New Orleans as a child, we bought them at the bakery. As an young adult, my mother had them shipped to me. As an adult and since my mother's passing, I have not had a king cake! So, this year I decided, with my children, to attempt to make a king cake myself... and I used this recipe. It is the BEST king cake I have ever had! We followed the recipe exactly except we added cinnamon to the cream cheese filling and braided the two cakes together for a larger cake.  Sharing the heritage of the king cake, Mardi Gras and some of my own childhood experiences with my children all while making this wonderful recipe was well worth the time... not to mention, this recipe was better than ANY I have ever had :)

I made this cake for a Cajun party and it was a huge hit, especially with the kids. Since I couldn't find a plastic baby Jesus, I replaced it with one whole almond. A poor substitute, but one that's used in gateau des rois (the quebecois version of a king cake). Thanks for the great recipe. I'll make it again for sure.

Although I was born and raised in Louisiana, I live in the midwest now where most people have never heard of King Cake.  This is the 1st king cake I've had in years! And the 1st one I have ever made! It was awesome and worth the extra effort.

Perfect king cake!  I'm from BR, lived for years in New Orleans, but now I'm up in Seattle with no king cake to be found during mardi gras season.  So I figured I'd start making 'em. I decided to try this one, and have since fed it to all my friends.  10/10 Louisianians up here agree - this is better than most king cakes we've ever bought back home! Moist, not too sweet, no goopy filling.  I don't color the frosting, just put the colored sugar onto white frosting.  It's also good with a praline filling - pecans + butter + brown sugar.

My husband recently challenged me to bake a King Cake - something I, being from Ohio, had never heard of - and he, a native New-Orlean, had never eaten outside of a restaurant! The very next day I baked up this cake while he was at work - when he came home, he FLIPPED! He said it was the best King Cake he'd ever had, immediately called his family to brag, and then asked me to bake a second after only one slice. It was great! I followed the recipe exactly - put a space heater in the closet for the 85 degree yeast reaction. Thanks!

This was my first King Cake to make and it was terrific.  I grew up in Baton Rouge surrounded by bakeries specializing in King Cakes so I had low expectations for cooking a cake that was up to Louisiana standards; but this recipe was terrific.  I'm even thinking about making one in a heart shape and using red, pink, and white frosting for V-Day.  

I did 1/2 the cake portion of the recipe keeping the filling, frosting and sugar the amount suggested.  Though I could have used 1/3 of the amount of colored sugars and been fine.

This was so delicious!  I had never even heard of a King Cake until the day I made this one.  The dough was wonderful to work with and warm out of the oven it was as good as any bakery could have made.  I used white frosting and sprinkled with yellow, purple and green sugars - a big hit!

I'm from Louisiana and have TONS of different King cakes. This is by far the BEST one ever! It was kind of a pain to make but extremely worth it! I will definitely be making this every year for our annual Mardi Gras party instead of buying one!
