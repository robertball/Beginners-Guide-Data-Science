This was very good but I did make a few changes because of what I had on hand and some likes and dislikes of individual family members.  I left out the red pepper.  I used 4 1/2 t powdered garlic instead of cloves.  I used regular paprika instead of smoked. I did not have any corn on hand or lime juice so I used lemon juice.  I used gluten free beef broth instead of vegetable.  Instead of making the cornbread mix, I used Krustaez gluten free cornbread mix; I needed to keep the recipe gf plus it seemed easier to just make the box mix.  I did not use any jalapenos.  This was really good and I would make again; might even add some hamburger to it, next time.
