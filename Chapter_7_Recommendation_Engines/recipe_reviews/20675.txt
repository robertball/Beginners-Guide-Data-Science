Oh my this is good! Hubby can't stand any sort of meatloaf. Until now! He LOVED this which says quite a lot. I doubled it and we still didn't have a lot leftover for sandwiches. He piled his plate high! I made mashed potatoes and green peas to go with it. Tip for cutting the grease: put several pieces of sandwich bread underneath the meatloaf. It will soak up a lot of the grease, then just throw the nasty greasy bread away when the loaf is done! Thank you Rempels for sharing your recipe!!!!

I am on a perpetual search for a good meatloaf recipe, have tried many, and my hubby and I really like this one.  It is good for making meatloaf burgers, too!  Just add about 1/4 more cracker crumbs to make the burgers firmer.  Plus, a good glaze for the meatloaf is 3T ketchup, 1T honey and 1/2t worchestershire. Pour it on before baking and you've got yourself one GOOD meatloaf!

I have been making my meatloaf recipe - then taking the mixture and pressing  it into hamburger patties.    They freeze really well and then when I want a burger,  I just pop a couple out of the freezer (make sure to use 2 pieces of wax paper between the patties)  and put it straight onto the BBQ  frozen.      LOVE IT AS A HAMBURGER  :)

I have made this recipe twice now and it is really a taste treat. This last time, I added 1/2 cup ketchup, a little finely chopped green pepper, and a few extra crackers. I saved a little of the ketchup mixture and topped the meatloaf with it during the last 1/2 hour of baking. I served it to company and was asked for a copy of the recipe so they could make it too. Thanks for the great recipe Connie.

Simple and excellent recipe.  My husband and son love it.  My mother-in-law even asked for the recipe!  Used lean ground beef & followed the recipe. I'm tired of people changing 10 things in the recipe & then giving a review.  Try as-is first, then modify if need be and leave an honest review of the actual recipe.

Wonderful meatloaf!  To avoid the saltiness that many reviewers have noted, try using 2.5 tbsp of dried minced onions in place of the dry onion soup mix.  As I was out of ketchup, I subbed chili glaze (small round bottle) which gave the the meatloaf an additional kick, and used the glaze noted in "Connie's Jan 2009" review.  Very tasty!!!!  Reviewers Please Note:  If you can find cheese crackers such as Carr's cheese melts (gourmet crackers), they truly make this recipe go from wonderful to over the top!  Thanks Connie for a great submission!

Umm ummm good!! I haven't made meatloaf in YEARS  . . . weary of pitching meatloafs in the garbage time after time.  My hubby, who is not a big meat loaf fan   REALLY enjoyed this one. I made a couple changes.  I used 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound ground pork, 1 cup crushed cracker, part chedder and part pepper jack cheese,  a little minced red pepper, filled the 1/4 measuring cup halfway with ketchup and the rest with BBQ sauce.  I also used the glaze (ketchup, honey, worchestershire) suggested by another reviewer.

I scaled this recipe to 72 servings for our Wed. night church dinner.  Everyone loved it, even the children and teenagers!  After everyone was fed, we had 3 servings left!  People were coming into the kitchen while it was still in the oven and expressed how wonderful it smelled.  Even those who did not care for meatloaf could not resist this recipe!

So good!! I wish I had leftovers!! I made two pans last night for a dinner party (7 people) and by the end there was absolutley no meatloaf left!!  I took the advice of Mrs. Rempel her self and used 3/4 chedder cheese and 1/4 mozzarella and I also used Cheez-its insted of butter crackers. I sifted the onion soup mix and added only the flakes and a few pinches of the powder.  I made the glaze recommend by KINZ: 3T ketchup, 1T honey and 1/2t worchestershire.  I poured it over the meat before backing and it made one amazing meatloaf!!

My husband rated this meatloaf as "lacking any pizzaz".  It was good, it just wasn't the "wow" I was expecting after reading everyone else's reviews.  It reminded me of something the old ladies bring to church for a potluck.  It was fine, but I think I'll stick to my own recipe.  
*edit* I had to give this another try since everyone else loves it so much.  So this time I made it for my parents and reduced the eggs to 2, the ketchup to 2 T. and added  an extra tablespoon of steak sauce. I also added the glaze of ketchup, honey, and worchestershire suggested by another reviewer. It turned out much better and everyone really liked it this time. I've also made it with the bread in the bottom and without.  This recipe is incredibly greasy, but the meatloaf sticks to the bread, leaving you with a soggy bread residue on the bottom.  It's way better to just leave out the bread and drain out the grease, because even with the bread, you still have to drain it.

My husband said that this tasted more like a huge grilled hamburger than a meatloaf -- a huge compliment from a guy who hates meatloaf!  I added Romano cheese and liquid smoke for fun, but the recipe itself is definitely a keeper!  We all loved it.

I like meatloaf and this is very good, destined to be one of my favorites. I added red pepper and a couple of tablespoons of steak sauce to the top of the meatloaf while it baked. I also substituted cheese flavored crackers because that's what I had. There were no leftovers.

I am a meat loaf lover and my wife has been making great meat loaf for 30 years.  This is the first one I made and I think it is better than hers.  If you tell her that I will deny it.  I took the advice of other reviewers and was generous on the amount of crackers, and used almost a cup.  I mixed Ritz together with Cheeze-its. After baking 30 minutes I topped with the glaze Paula Deen uses - 1/3 cup ketchup, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and 1 tablespoon brown mustard (Guldens). It was delicious.  I'm glad I found this recipe.

WOW! This is the meatloaf haters meatloaf. Most young adults can't wait to leave home to try out their wings. I was anxious to escape Thursday (meatloaf) nights. lol I've made this twice, once to the letter and once with 2 lbs. of meat, 1/2 hamburger, 1/2 ground sausage. DELISH no matter what you do. I wonder about the review from the "professional" cook that gave it one star and called it bland. I wonder what a "professional" is doing on this website and using a recipe that calls for an envelope of onion soup mix, and how he could miss the flavor it imparts. I'm not a food snob at all but I doubt that "professional" does much cooking with truffle butter, knows what a pinch of saffron can do to mussels cooked in wine or a pan of risotto and from which culinary school he graduated. It's delicious, divine and after 30 years of not eating meatloaf, I'm a lover of this! Thank you so much!!

First time around I made the recipe exactly as shown (I find it odd that people make significant changes to a recipe the first time they try it then attempt to rate the recipe.  Their rating applies only to their changed recipe, not the published recipe).  It was excellent.  The second time I used low sodium onion soup mix (do a web search) and added the glaze of 3 T catsup, 1T honey, & 1/2t Worcestershire sauce atop the meatloaf 30 minutes into cooking.  The glaze added a little pizzzaz but the base recipe is excellent either way.  It's a keeper meatloaf recipe and will grace our table over and over in the future.

There is really no reason anyone should give this recipe below a 5 star.  It is absolutely perfect as written.  Adjustments can be made for "what you had on hand, or what your picky "whatever" will eat or will not eat."  But this IS the perfect meatloaf.  IF there are any leftovers, they are sure to be delicious the next day still as meatloaf and as meatloaf sandwiches with mayo and bread.

Please don't add a 1/4 tsp. of this or that and THEN rate is as a 4+, it's perfect the way it is.

Sorry I'm in a grumpy mood from the heat and drought!

My perpetual search for the perfect meatloaf is O-V-E-R! Although I still had to make s0me alterations for this recipe, thus the 4 stars. First, reviewers were complaining about this being to0 salty so what i did was put 1T of onion powder in place of onion soup mix. Next, to0 bland. The solution? Put glaze on it. Mix 1/2 c Ketchup + 1 Tbsp Vinegar + 1 T Yellow Mustard + 1/4 c sugar. Brush it during the last 15 mins of baking. Mmmm-mmm. now that's a five star recipe.. Thanks f0r sharing!

I put bread at the bottom of the dish to absorb the grease because I used ground chuck. It was not enough to soak up all of the grease. In the future, I will use ground round or sirloin.  Another comment said to not use all of the contents of the onion soup mix, however, I put it all in and it tasted great! My boyfriend who is not a big fan of meatloaf loved this recipe. Thank you for helping me expand our dinner choices!

Ugh; way too salty.  I did read the reviews where others had the same complaint, but, since I was increasing the meat from 1.5 pounds to 2 pounds (I added a pound of ground pork), I thought I would be fine.  No such luck, I think that with the salt from the Ritz crackers, the onion soup mix's salt content is too excessive.  I wish I'd taken the tip from other reviewers to skip the soup mix and just use onion flakes. I think next time I want meatloaf, I'll use the copycat recipe for Claim Jumper instead.

My family really enjoyed this meatloaf. I used a mixture of ground beef and ground pork, as I always do with any meatloaf. I doubled the recipe and made two loaves, and since I only had one package of dry onion soup, I also added some dried minced onion. I was glad to find another use for the A1 Steak Sauce in my frig, since no one ever puts it on their steak!

This meatloaf is excellent! The only thing I changed was very minor.  I used 1 TBSP. BBQ sauce and 1 TBSP. steak sauce instead of the called for 2 TBSP's of steak sauce.  I also mixed a little ketchup and BBQ sauce and brushed the top of the loaf before baking.  This meatloaf is part of our weekly menu, my husband and daughter both love it! The onion soup mix, shredded cheese and the crushed crackers make this meatlof stand out.

Alright meatloaf with the addition of a glaze made from ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and honey. A bit on the bland side for our taste, but not bad. Held together nicely when sliced. Surprised that I could not taste much of the cheese even though I added extra and used 1/2 sharp cheddar, 1/2 mild.

My husband does not like meatloaf and my son asked me to make it.  I found this recipe and liked the reviews.  The only substitutions I made were I used 2 lbs ground turkey and I made a sauce for the top (1/2 ketchup & 1/2 steak sauce).  It was wonderful!  Very moist, drained the "juice" off for the dogs - they're fans too!  My husband enjoyed it and said he'd gladly eat it again.  My son was impressed!  Another review thought it was too salty and didn't use the base to the onion soup mix, but I used it and I think it would have been bland without it.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Very easy and tasty recipe.  My kids loved it and fought for seconds. My high-maintenance girlfriend whom stated "Meatloaf . . . I hate meatloaf, I just don't like the consistency . . . No, seriously, I NEVER like it" tasted it and moaned with pleasure.  No I said, you don't like meatloaf, you don't want any . . . I reached for her last piece and she nearly ripped my arm off.  VERDICT - The recipe pleases all.

My cousin and I really enjoyed this meatloaf.  To me, it needed a little more kick, but to him, it was perfect.  He said it was meatloaf that tasted like meatloaf, which is a good thing!

This is a fantastic basic recipe for meatloaf. You can tweak it a million different ways and it always comes out great. I like to add some chopped green onions, Sriracha and a few cloves of minced garlic. One warning though - the recipe as-is borders on being too salty because of the onion soup mix. (I find that adding 3/4 of the package is perfect.) If you decide to add anything such as worcestershire or soy sauce to the mix just be mindful of the salt content and adjust ingredients accordingly.

Really, really good meatloaf! I heard several audible "mmmmmmm"s from the hubby, and my 7 year old son, who rarely eats dinner, ate every bite. That speaks volumes! I didn't change a thing- if you're going to make a bunch of changes, I say just submit your own recipe.

Connie’s recipe was good...” about 1/4 more cracker crumbs to make the burgers firmer plus, a good glaze for the meatloaf is 3T ketchup, 1T honey and 1/2t Worcestershire. Pour it on before baking” just coat the top no need for extra it will just makes the meatloaf runny. Drain off all excess grease before serving. We used buffalo meat which is low in fat, very flavorful. Let meatloaf cool for 5 to 10 mins before serving.

I don't even like meatloaf and I ate this one!  And DH loved it.  I used beefy onion soup mix, and crushed Cheez-its.  I also glazed it with the mix a review suggestion of ketchup, honey, and worchestershire.  Will definitely make this one again.

Wonderful meatloaf recipe!  The steak sauce, crackers and cheddar cheese add to make a tasty, moist meatloaf.  Unfortunately there were NO leftovers for lunch! A nice change from the oatmeal and tomato juice/catsup recipe.  I added a glaze of brown sugar, catsup and mustard before baking and it was awesome!

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Ms. Remple for posting your recipe.  I have never been able to make an outstanding meatloaf, but with your recipe my husband said it was delicious and a keeper!  I only modified it a bit by using a little less onion soup mix, part of the cheese was a pepper jack (because I did not have enough cheddar on hand) and I used 18 regular crackers (sprayed with butter and microwaved until crisp) instead of the buttery round crackers because I didn't have them on hand either.  This is now the only way I will ever make meatloaf - so simple and so good!

This was really good.  My husband liked it. The addition of cheddar cheese gave this meatloaf a little extra taste and texture that we liked.  I did add ketchup mixed with brown sugar and mustard as a topping while it baked.  I will definetly make this again.

On the blase side and overly salty due to the onion soup mix. Sorry Rempel family,  you can keep this family recipe.

Very good meatloaf recipe...DH thought it was fabulous! He started with some ketchup on his serving, then later mentioned he actually liked it better with no ketchup on top! I agree, so one can really taste the flavor of this meatloaf. I used about 2 lbs. of meat, and ended up having to bake for 90 mins. to reach temp. of 160 degrees. Wonderful recipe - thanks for sharing...can't wait to have the leftovers in sandwiches!

My family enjoyed this.  I made as is except I did add ketchup to the top before baking.  It is very flavorful and simple to prepare.  It is a tad salty adding the soup mix, ketchup, A-1, and butter crackers but no one complained.  I would make this again.  Oh, and next time, I will shape into a loaf and bake on a cookie sheet lined with tinfoil to cut down on the grease.

I read all of the  suggestions, but decided to make the original recipe to establish a baseline.  It is excellent as is, and the only addition for the next time, will be to add pepper.

My family loved this meatloaf! I doubled the recipe and made it into two loaves. I don't use a loaf pan to bake meatloaf in - I just form it into a loaf shape and bake it in a 9 x 13 baking dish. I used the tip to place bread slices under the meatloaf before baking, and it worked great! The meatloaf wasn't at all greasy, as many other people said. I think the key is to follow exactly what the recipe says and use LEAN ground beef.

This is soooooo goooood!!! I agree, this receipe is a keeper!! With a recommendation from another review I also used the worchestershire sauce instead of the steak sauce.  Its so easy and the best its yummy!! I did find I could of fit into one loaf pan...Putting into two pans made it not as "high" as I would of liked.  Next time I make it I will put it into one pan.  Can't wait!!

I used 2 lbs. of ground turkey meat in place of ground beef.  I sauteed 6 oz. Portobello mushrooms, and 5 minced cloves of garlic in Extra Virgin olive oil then added a chopped red bell pepper, 2/3 c. Italian style breadcrumbs, 1 pk dry onion soup mix and half a block of freshly grated extra sharp cheddar cheese to the ground turkey.  Next, I whisked 3 organic free ranged eggs, 1/3 c. ketchup, and 1/3 c. chipotle steak sauce then combined that with the turkey mixture.  Served the Turkey loaf with steamed broccoli and cauliflower with a side of California ripe olives.  I must say, this was the best meatloaf I've ever made!  And, it garnered me a much coveted golden Stamp of Approval (SOA) from Mi Gato Loco

Excellent recipe.  I didn't have any of the crackers called for in the recipe, so used regular saltines.  The end result was still incredible..

This recipe is ok but only as a quick fix weeknight meal only. I read some reviews about how people had tried other meatloaf recipes and how this one was the best...blah, blah. I was thinking that the recipe didn't look like much, but then again it got so many good reviews... onion soup flavored beef loaf was what it was. I didn't like the crackers, I like the texture that breadcrumbs give the traditional meatloaf. There is nothing special about this meatloaf in any way. This is an excellent example of people posting really simple recipes that aren't even very good and people rating them highly just because the recipe is cheap and easy. The recipe is good for something quick, but not even close to being the end all of meatloaf recipes.  I wasn't impressed.

This is coming from someone who usually does not enjoy meat - this is really good. I did sub ground turkey but otherwise made as is. It was perfect - not dry and not greasy like others complained about.   The whole family seemed to enjoy it.  Will definately be adding this to the rotation.

I hate meatloaf, so I was ready to be polite when served this at a friend's house.  However, it was delicious!  My husband could have eaten the entire loaf by himself and I had two servings.  It was so good we made it ourselves just a few days later.  We didn't have the ritz crackers, so in a pinch we used saltines...the ritz crackers are better.  
Also, it does have quite a bit of grease on the sides by the time it is done cooking, we just poured it off and it was fine.
Will be making this again.

I have used this for a base recipe for 4 years. One thing I alter is to use 1/2 of the onion soup mix and bread crumbs instead of crackers to help with cost. I also add worchseshire sauce and parsley flaks for color. I only add 3/4 of the cheese or till it looks right.  To make individual servings I scoop 1/3 lb portions onto a cookie sheet and bake. Bake time is shorter, to add glaze I transfer them to a 9x13 or 2in hotel pan so the meat is sitting in the glaze and not the greese. These also freeze wonderfly and you can take out the number you need. If you cook from frozen they will take about the time recipe states.

This was just... OK. A little dull. And, the cheese in the recipe made it a little too greasy for my taste. I have other meatloaf recipes that I like much better than this one. Sorry!

My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe.  He says I can't make it if I am just going to make one.  Tonight I made THREE so he can have it at work all week long.  I make a glaze for the top that I put on for the last 20 minutes or so.  I just do ketchup, brown sugar and mustard.  SOOOOO YUMMY!!!!

I am making this for the 100th time tonight and I forgot to buy the crackers so I used Italian style breadcrumbs instead and it was just as good.  I also noticed that when I use the 80/20 ground beef it is a much moister and tastier meatloaf!!!

We love this recipe! I can't stand traditional meat loaf with the ketchup stuff on the top (gross) so I love this recipe as it goes light on the tomatos. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out wonderful. We used the leanest ground beef available, which probably cut back on the oiliness of it. Absolutely added to my favorites! Thanks so much to the Rempel family!

Excellent!I was looking for a good old fashioned recipe, one that was simple and straightforward, and this was a big hit! And you can tweak it many different ways to your liking. I added strips of turkey bacon on the top, in the last half hour of cooking time, it came out great. If you are looking for a simple yet tasty and moist meatloaf, use this recipe.

I have made this recipe many times and everyone loves it. I have also made some changes to it which come in handy depending on the occasion. I have added shredded carrots for color and a little flavor. I have also chopped a jalapeno and added it to the dry ingredients before combining. I like the Jalapeno. I have also changed the steak sauce/ketchup mixture to a chunky salsa in equal amounts and it worked out really well. This is a very easy and very flexible recipe. Thanks for posting it. I've been using it for years now.

Everyone loved this, except my onion-hating daughter who spotted the bits of onion right away.  I've heard you can whirl the soupmix in the blender before using it, so all the onion bits are pulverized, so that's what I'll do next time.

Excellent... I have been looking for a great meatloaf and I have found it.  I was a little worried about adding cheese, but everyone asked for seconds.  A definate will do again.  Thanks Mrs. Rempel.

I had to use up some beef before it went bad, and decided to try this recipe. Both my husband and the friend we had over for dinner loved it - she said she normally does not eat anyone's meatloaf but her mom's (and she called me the next day to thank me again!) and my husband said this was his favorite meatloaf of all the ones I've tried thus far. I did what someone suggested and used 1 T. steak sauce and 1 T. bbq sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

I've had this recipe in my box for over 4 years. Even though I love cheese I was worried as to how it would taste in a meatloaf. It was sooo good and now I could kick myself for not trying this sooner. I topped it with ketchup and placed 2 pieces of sandwich bread on the bottom of my loaf pan (to soak up the fat) and it was basically greasless. I loved it.

A variation which I suggest:  use white cheddar cheezits instead of the crackers and cheese.  I also used a spicy BBQ sauce instead of the ketchup to kick up the taste.  Loved it.

This is an excellent meatloaf!!  Try it as written the first time, then adjust it.  I don't feel it needs any tweaking.  It is delicious the way it is.  I am not a new cook, either.  I have raised 6 children and have been cooking since I was thirteen. Now I cook for my grandchildren. Meatloaf was a staple in our house, and I just like trying new varieties.  This one is a definite keeper.  It is moist, well seasoned, and most of all, kid friendly too.  Yummmm......

HALLELUJAH!!!! A meatloaf recipe that I can and will make over and over again! I made changes, but only because my picky husband wont eat anything with onion (onion soup mix). So instead I just used garlic powder and onion powder. I kept everything else the same and followed others advice of placing bread slices underneath as it baked. 
My husband must have complimented this meatloaf 6 times before he finally stopped eating it! I teased him and told him I was going to throw away the leftovers because there was no room in the fridge. "OH NO YOUR NOT" haha calm down dear, it was a joke.  Thanks for the great recipe, Ill be keeping this and making it again and again. 
**Side note, a lot of the negative reviews sate that it is too salty. I did not have this issue since I did not use the onion soup mix, my suggestion would be to omit it all together and add some garlic and onion powder in its place.  When I did this, it was not salty at all. Great flavor from the ketchup/A1 and crackers. I also added a little less cheese I think since I only had a partial bag left. Try this with out the soup mix!

If you've been searching for a traditional meatloaf that wasn't bland, bland, bland, well baby, your ship has come in! This is the recipe I've waited 30 years to find. I didn't have the soup mix, so faked it with dried minced onions and some beef bouillon. Because I'm gluten free, I used corn flake crumbs for the crackers. Everything else as written. I made 2 mini-loaves on a foil-lined pan and baked it in my toaster oven at 350º for 45 minutes. So very, very tasty, especially with the beef gravy  I made and Chef John's mashed potatoes. With fresh peas for green stuff, this was the ideal comfort meal for a cold spring evening. ***Update*** I made this again tonight WITH the soup mix and doubled the cheese, cutting it into cubes. Gooey, cheesy melty goodness!

Thank you thank you thank you!  I have tried to duplicate my mother's recipe my entire life without success.  This is as close as it gets:)  Delicious!  The only change I made was to add bread slices to the bottom of the pan to eliminate grease. Why mess with perfection!

Fantastic!!
The first meatloaf I've made (in about 40 years) that we loved.  
Didn't have any butter round crackers, so substituted with the same amount of flavored breadcrumbs.
Great meatloaf!

One of the best meatloaf recipes around!(if you like onion)...I made this for a party I went to and got plenty of compliments.  If you're looking to healthy this up you can switch to extra lean turkey meat. no fat shredded cheddar and whole wheat bread crumb s (instead of crackers).  Tastes equally delicious. I highly recommend this recipe!!

This was good but not the great recipe I am looking for.  My family liked it but also said that they didn't want it again.  My impression was that the steak sauce was a bit too tangy.  I followed the recipe with only one change, I used meatloaf mix instead of ground beef.  Thanks for sharing your family recipe.

This really didn't do it for me.  I guess I must prefer a more classic meat loaf.  It was pretty bland and the cheese did not add to it.  My 4 year old liked it ok, but had to dip it in ketchup for flavor.

Meatloaf haters must try this recipe! Holy cow! The whole family enjoyed this. I did swap out most of the ketchup for A1 sauce and used a monterey cheese. It took about 50 minutes to cook. 5 star all the way!

Very delicious! Unfortunately, I didn't have butter crackers so I used plain bread crumbs and a tbs of butter. Turned out very tasty but next time I would try it with the butter crackers.

I have a recipe I have used many times for meatloaf with onion soup mix. I decided to try this recipe because it was very similar, but with a couple of added ingredients. The taste was okay, but I found it to be very dry and also salty. The texture I believe was the result of me using too lean of a beef, and it may have been my fault, but that wouldn't affect the salty taste. I was not sure why the ketchup and steak sauce were mixed in either instead of topping the meatloaf, which I think would have tasted much better.

Sorry, but without a topping, this meatloaf is just ordinary and nothing special. Others have made their own toppings and given 5 star ratings, but since the original recipe has none, I could only give this two stars.

I LOVE this meatloaf.  I've made some in the past that bombed, and I was starting to think that I just didn't like meatloaf, until I made this recipe.  I used the Paula Dean glaze that someone else suggested (brown sugar, mustard, tomato sauce (because I don't like ketchup)).  I think any good meat glaze should definitely contain brown sugar.  All of my meatloaf in the past was soooo greasy, so I always drain the grease right before glazing this 30 minutes into cooking, and then I drain it one more time about 5 minutes before it's done (I reglaze it afterwards).  That way, this is NEVER greasy.  Such a simple fix, but I never thought about it before.

My husband (who is very picky) made this for dinner the other night.  It was a HUGE success!!! We all loved it, even my 16 month old daughter. The only thing that I would do differently would be to only add 1/2 of the soup mix, it was just a bit to salty for me but my hubby LOVED IT!! Now that he has one success under his belt he will make dinner more often!!!!

overall good recipe, but cook time was not near long enough, after an hour, the middle was still pretty raw, ended up cooking 1 1/2 hours.  Hubby liked the sauce on top, I agree.  Served w/ cheddar mash. potato's and salad.  Will only make again if I have lots of time.

I've tried a lot of meatloafs and this is my favorite so far.  My only complaint was that the onion soup mix was a little overpowering.  I may not use the whole pouch next time.

I typically hate meatloaf but I LOVE this recipe. It's so easy and always turns out great. I used some of the suggestions from other reviewers and added a glaze made of ketchup, Worcestershire, honey and brown sugar. I haven't perfected the glaze yet but the meatloaf is fantastic.

I'm not a big fan of meatloaf, but this was very good. My grandfather requested meatloaf for his birthday dinner and I wanted to make one that was really good--and this did the trick.  Not a lot of people in our family are meatloaf lovers, but I got lots of compliments on this. Just about everyone went back for 2nd helpings and my husband had 3rds. Since I was serving 10 people I doubled the recipe and shaped the loaf myself, putting it on a cookie sheet to bake and covered with foil.  I took the foil off and cooked for another 15 minutes at about 400 degrees to brown. It held its shape really well even when cut, and had just the right amount of moistness when we ate it. At the end of dinner there was only about 1/8 of the loaf left!

This is great meatloaf. For once I didn't have to drown mine in Ketchup. My husband and twin 4 year olds loved it also. I followed the recipe exactly, just added some pepper and garlic powder. I did not think it was too salty with the whole package of onion mix. Thank you for the recipe, will be making this again!

EDIT~ Made this for the third time tonight. Instead of an actual loaf, I put the meat mixture in halfed green peppers (boiled peppers for 10 minutes prior to stuffing). Turned out great!!! Thanks again for this recipe.

WAY too salty.  The cheese doesn't really add much.  If I were to make this again (which I've kindly been asked not to) I'd used 1/2 a package of onion soup mix and skip the cheese.  On the up side, the left overs are good in a sandwich or in veggie soup.

Haha, I have used the Rempel Family Meatloaf for a long time and just now saw Connie's comment to not use the entire package of onion soup mix; I've always used the whole thing and have never found it too salty for us! I have made this so many times I've lost count and it is great for family as well as company.

Very good meatloaf, the best I've had.  The only suggestion I'd make is to cut back on the steak sauce, it was a little overwhelming for my tastes, but my husband loved it.  Just depends on how much you like steak sauce I guess.  Overall, very easy and delicious!

Great meatloaf! I had been using Campbell's Kitchen "Best Ever" recipe, which I thought was the best, but I'm so glad I found this recipe! I follow the recipe exactly and it's wonderful. I do put slices of bread underneath the meatloaf to soak up the grease. Thanks so much for the recipe, I make it ALL the time!

I never write a review but I have to review this. I never liked meatloaf because it always tasted like a big meatball to me. This recipe is amazing. The ONLY thing I do differently is to use half turkey, half beef. Too wet?  No way, not enough flavor? Ridiculous. The combo of ingredients are perfect.  I made this again tonight with guests and they couldnt get enough of it. A great recipe!!

Yumm! I made this recipe just as instructed and followed another reviewers advice for putting 2 slices of bread in the bottom to soak up grease. Great tip! I used 1 tbsp of A1 and 1 tbsp of 57 for the steak sauce.  I also added a ketchup glaze and stuck it back in the oven for 10 minutes after it was fully baked, out of personal preference. Basic recipe, but delicious!

Turned out very moist and not a bit dry!  Something about the flavor wasn't going over well with me, tho - I think it was the steak sauce, which I'm not a fan of to begin with.  Should I make this again, I will substitute BBQ sauce.

I made this last night with some penne pasta and a salad. This was quite greasy even after using the bread on bottom. I drained off the grease and the meatloaf itself was so good. Thank you!

Maybe I did something wrong but I think I'll stick to my old recipe  for meatloaf. I thought it was rather bland and the meat was greasy from the cheese. I even put 2 pieces of bread under it to catch the grease. I wouldn't recommend this and won't make it again.

This is truly a great meatloaf recipe!
I suggest either adding more crackers or placing a couple slices of bread on the bottom of the loaf pan to absorb some of the meat and cheese oils, I also used garlic flavored steak sauce which tasted wonderful!

Sweetie-pi loved this recipe; I thought it was very good. I thought this had a wonderful meatloaf texture and was nice and moist and made from ingredients I often have on hand.  However, I found it to be very salty from the onion soup mix. Next time I will reduce the amount to half.  Also I deliberately baked this in a larger dish, 11"x7", but sized it for a 9"x5",  as I like to have a nice crust all around and it also makes the fat easier to drain.

YUMMY! I was worried that my loaf would be too dry since I used 90% lean organic beef for this meatloaf.  But after mixing the egg/A-1/ketchup mixture it was nice 'n moist.  Eventhough my meat was lean I too put the bread (english muffins actually) under the meat and it was still sooo moist after cooking.  My family loved the smell thru the whole house as it cooked.  The only thing I changed in this recipe was the addition of a heaping spoon of my jarred garlic to the egg mix & a little extra cheese too. Oh, and I used 2 lbs. of meat but kept everything else the same. I used the whole onion soup packet and it wasn't close to too salty. Half way thru cooking I did a glaze of ketchup honey & a squirt of mustard to the top.  I served with shredded hashbrowns & ketchup for the kiddos. Thanks for the great post & congrats on all the 5 star reviews, you should be proud Connie!

I thought this was very good.  Followed the recipe to a "T" which I rarely do, and it was perfect.  Didn't even need ketchup or anything to dip it in, which is a huge plus in my book.  Steak sauce was an EXCELLENT idea.  Way to go Connie Rempel.  We enjoyed your family meatloaf.  Post more Rempel family recipes.

I am not a meatloaf fan, but my husband is so I thought I would give this recipe a try since it had such good reviews!  We both really enjoyed this!  The only changes I made was using 1/2 onion soup mix, and instead of 2 tbs. of steak sauce-I used 1 tbs. steak sauce and 1 tbs. BBQ sauce! I also added a little chopped onion and celery.  SO GOOD! My  husband said this is the best meatloaf he has ever had!  The cheese does make it greasy but the taste is amazing.  It did take an hour and a half for it to cook too!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've been trying to find the perfect meatloaf recipe, and this is just NOT it. I expected it to be awesome because of all the great reviews it's received, but my husband & I took one bite of it and trashed it.  Maybe it was the brand of soup mix I used??  I followed the recipe exactly, then adding a little cayenne...  THAT sure wasn't the cause for the aweful taste!  I don't recommend this recipe, and still searching...

This meatloaf is fantastic.  I did not change a
thing in the recipe.  My husband said that it was
the best meatloaf he has ever had. It was so good
that there was none leftover.  The only thing
I will do different next time is to increase the
recipe (I missed my meatloaf sandwich for lunch
the next day). Thank you Connie for sharing with
us.

This meatloaf is amazing. I've made it twice.  Once during an ice storm I substituted fresh bread crumbs I made in my food processor for the cracker crumbs and provolone and cheddar mix. I top it with ketchup mixed w/bbq sauce.  It is so so good!  After reading other reviews, maybe I'll try the brown sugar meatloaf as well. Thanks for the great recipe.

My husband says he hates meatloaf, HATES it.  But if I make this particular meatloaf with Cheez-its, he devours it.  He says it's not really meatloaf, it's a giant, cheesy meatball.  Whatever.

This meatloaf was a hit with the family.  I used everything except for the onion soup mix (because I forgot to pick it up…shucks).  I did add my usual suspects (garlic powder, onion powder, basil, season salt, black pepper, etc.) and I used Ritz crackers.  I also made this for 9 servings.  Would definitely recommend and make this again.

This was a hit!  A little too much onion flavor - will reduce the dry onion soup mix next time.

This is my families favorite meatloaf!  I use 1 1/2 lb beef and 1 lb sausage and then up the other ingredients besides the onion mix.  This makes a large meatloaf and my husband always tells me to make more because he loves the leftovers so much.  I also add the glaze someone else suggested of 3T ketchup, 1T honey and 1/2 tsp Worchester.  This really puts it over the top good.

I followed the recipe exact, except for doing as one reviewer did, and sifted the onion soup mix to separate the dried onion from the powder. After doing this, I added all the dried onion, and then used 2 tsp. of the powder. I did this because of reviews of the meatloaf being too salty; I use grass fed beef (it's expensive, even for ground beef), and I didn't want to ruin the dish with too much salt! With this change it's a super yummy, comfort food, 5* recipe! Also, I just shape the meat mixture into a 9x5 loaf, inside of a 7x11 baking dish. This way there is no problem with the whole loaf being immersed in grease.

This is the best meatloaf.  I have subbed regular dried breadcrumbs for the crackers if I don't have them on hand.  I've also covered this is bacon before putting in the oven.  It's always moist and delicious (the onion soup mix is a must and gives this a really nice flavor).  I also use a larger pan and just mold it into a loaf shape, leaving room between the loaf and the pan so that the fat has a place to go other than staying in the meat loaf. I have tried many meatloaf recipes from this site but this one is the best.

I am a food lover in my 40s, and this is the best meatloaf I've ever had.  I've made this recipe twice myself at home, and the flavors and texture are so incredible.  Soft yet holds well together.  I can whip it all together in about 20 minutes.  I use two pounds of hamburger which yields a pretty thick loaf, but then there's lots of leftovers, and those flavors really soak in overnight.  Don't worry about too much of this and that -- it's safe to experiment on this recipe.  I tried using different steak sauce last time (Montreal Steak), and a little extra ketchup (I like sauce).  Yummy!  I also make my own glaze made up brown sugar, ketchup, and worchestire sauce which I brush on about 10-15 minutes before the end of cooking.  This meatloaf would probably make my top 10 of all time dinners.

I thought this was really a good meatloaf recipe-I knew it was too salty after reading a few reviews so I just used 1/2 package of the onion soup mix. Not having steak sauce, I substituted 1 1/2 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and it was fine. Thank you-no leftovers in the fridge a day later!

The husband and I really enjoyed this meatloaf:) The onion soup mix definitely adds a great flavor to it. I read some of the reviews and used the suggestion of adding a glaze to the top before cooking. The glaze is 2T of ketchup, 1T of honey, and 1/2 t of worchestire sauce. So yummy, I wil be making this again!! :)

Great and easy recipe. My husband and I have never agreed on a meatloaf recipe, until now! The only thing I added was the last 25 minutes of cooking I added more ketchup and A1 sauce on top.

This recipe is delicious!  I up the servings to 8 (uses 2 pounds meat) to ensure leftovers the next day.  I didn't have steak sauce so I used worcestershire and it totally works.  Thanks for a new staple dinner dish in our home!

This honestly is the best meatloaf ever.  I've always used my Italian Grandmother's recipe that has been passed down to everyone in the family.  This was such a flavorful, moist and just overall scrumptious meal.  The only changes I made was that I added only a half of the onion soup mix packet because that's what I had on hand and I think it was perfect.  Some other reviewers said that the meal was a little too salty so I think adding only half was the trick.  Also instead of steak sauce, I used Worcestershire sauce and it was fabulous.  I highly recommend this meatloaf and will definitely be using this recipe again.

In general I think meatloaf recipes are for cowards, but the cheese intrigued me. This makes a moist and tasty loaf that got a thumbs up from the family. The leftovers were a bit too crumbly to make good sandwiches, but then there weren't many leftovers.

I live with 3 boys who have never had meatloaf. I decided to make two loves. One that's more traditional (easy meatloaf by janet caldwell) and this recipe. I loved both equally in different ways, but the boys absolutely LOVED this recipe. The only big change I made was adding a hardboiled egg into it. One of the roommates thought it was a good idea, so I put one in there just for him. These men acted like boys. The other two whined about how there wasn't a hardboiled egg in there for them.  I personally didn't try it and don't really care for a hardboiled egg in there. The boys seem to like the idea. I've been getting request lately to make this meatloaf again. So great job, connie. Love the loaf and personally wouldn't change a thing. Probably going to make it again very soon. One exactly like this (plus hardboiled eggs) and one with leek soup mix instead. I have that around the house sometimes, so I'd like to know if it'll make a good sub if I'm too lazy to go to the store to pick up just soup mix. =)

correction: the roommate said it was a softboiled egg not hardboiled

Thanks Connie for a wonderful dinner! My kids don't eat meatloaf but they loved this so much. My husband said, "Oh! this is surely a keeper!" I followed the exact recipe, however, I doubled the ketchup. And followed the suggestion of a reviewer to whisk eggs together with 1/4 cup ketchup and steak sauce then save the other 1/4 ketchup and put on top of the meatloaf during the 1/2 hour baking. I also added 1 finely chopped red pepper. And also, since I don't have dry onion soup mix on my cupboard, I substituted it with 2 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder. Oh my! My daughter's right, this is surely the best meatloaf in the whole world =)

Oh my goodness this was the best meatloaf ever.  I personally cannot stand meatloaf because people always put green peppers in it.  This recipe was easy and amazing.

This has become my go-to meatloaf recipe.  I have made it a few times.  It is a huge hit in my household.  The only thing I change is I leave out the onion soup mix and just use onion powder.  My husband hates onions, and that soup mix has chunks of onions in it.  If I use the onion powder he has no idea and it is still very tasty!!

I thought this was just OK, but my husband and youngest son gobbled it up so I have to change my rating to five stars. Next time, I'll double the cheese and maybe it will appeal to me more.

I made this last night, it was really good.  I followed the recipe 99% only difference is I added S&P out of habbit, I would skip the S next time as you get plenty from the onion soup mix.  The flavor was good, it was moist and stayed together, and was not too dense.  Will make again and may add a glaze as other reviewers have.  Also instead of A1 steak sauce I may use a a sweeter steak sauce such as Peter Lugars, also another reviewer used Chili sauce in place of ketchup which sounded good.

This was the first meatloaf I ever made and I was very pleased with it. I used a pound of ground turkey and half pound of country sausage instead of ground beef as that is what I had around the kitchen and it was still delicious. I also added 1/4 of a chopped green bell pepper and 1/4 of a small white onion as they were in my fridge and needed to be used up. I also used BBQ sauce instead of steak sauce because that it what I had. I can't compare it to the original recipe but I'm sure it was delicious also!

This is our family favorite and so easy.  The only change is we use is the glaze(either bottled barbecue sauce or brown sugar,ketchup and lemon juice) Oh Ritz crackers for the buttery round crackers are a definate plus!!!

I made this about a week ago. Not sure what happened, but the meatloaf itself had a very soft/mushy consistency and fell apart when I cut it - I was unable to put a nice slice on any of the plates. Instead of regular steak sauce, I used a cracked black pepper steak sauce and it completely overpowered any other flavor in the dish. Not sure what modifications (other than reducing the amount of steak sauce) that I can make in order to improve this recipe, so this is one that I will just have to take out of my recipe box. So sorry.

Not bad. Onion soup was a little overpowering but hubby commented that "it didn't have the Alpo taste" that meatloaf made with tomato paste has.

AMAZING! Blew my moms meatloaf outta the water. I did what another user said and put 2 slices of bread in the bottom of the loaf pan to absorb the grease. Only thing i changed was i added 2 Tbs of worcestershire to the egg slurry.

I hate meatloaf that has too much going on in it. This one doesn't have too much in it but it does have a lot of flavor! Put bread on the bottom of the pan for sure to soak up the grease because I used lean ground beef and there was a thick layer of grease floating on top. Soaked it up and it was very good and juicy!

I followed the recipe, only added some sweet BBQ sauce, a little bit of garlic salt, I added about 3/4 cup buttery crackers, and I did not add the entire packet of onion soup mix (i added about 3/4 of it). It turned out absolutely amazing! Best meatloaf I have ever had!

Very tasty meatloaf.  I was looking for a different recipe and came across this one.  My hubby is a meatloaf fanatic and asks for it frequently.  Instead of making the same meatloaf I usually make, which we absolutely love, I decided to try something different for a change.  I'm glad I did.  I'll be adding this recipe to my rotation of meatloaf recipes.  Thank you for sharing it!

I'm not a meatloaf fan, but this stuff is amazing!  My husband loves it, and I've made it when we've had other people over for dinner and they all love it, too.  It seems like I saw someone say before not to add the whole envelope of dry onion soup mix, so I just add the dried onions and some of the seasoning.  It turns out great every time.

This is fantastic! Actually use Cheezit's Hot & Spicy instead of buttery rounds and put a local homemade jalepeno cranberry jelly on top  - everything else the same, YUMMY!!! Even the pickiest-ever elderly dad eats this and loves it!! Thank you for this fabulous recipe!

Love, Love this recipe. My husband looks forwards to nights when I make this and my 2 year old can't get enough either.  Simple, easy, recipe.  I do add a topping that a reviewer shared on January 9, 2009 (Connie) 3T Ketchup, 1T Honey and 1t of worchestershire sauce. Excellent.

I'm another one that doesn't usually like meatloaf that much but I saw the good reviews & decided to try it. Very good! Easy too. I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have any onion soup mix so used this substitute that I found on Food.com - (1/4 c dried onion flakes, 2T beef bouillon granules, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp parsley flakes, 1/8 tsp celery seed, 1/8 tsp paprika, 1/8 tsp pepper). Everyone liked it, including 10 y/o & 19 mo. sons. Only my 8 y/o daughter did not, but she doesn't count since she wouldn't even TRY it. This is a keeper. I will make this again. *Also I used Ritz wheat crackers & the glaze that another reviewer suggested - 3T ketchup, 1T honey, 1/2 T worschetshire. Delicious!

Perfect Meatloaf !!  Made per the recipe - tho...I used Beefy Onion Soup mix...also used the Ketchup, Honey & Worcestershire Sauce glaze...glaze not only on top but also layered in the middle...used lean Ground Beef and molded my loaf in the middle of a 9x14 glass pyrex to keep additional grease away from the loaf - Absolutely Delicious !!  Made Great sandwiches the next day and no heartburn !  YUMBO !!!  :-)

Made as recipe stated, put did follow advice of another and put slice of bread on bottom to soak up some extra grease, which really helped. I also made a little extra ketchup sauce and put on top with last 15 minutes of baking.   It was gobbled up by all and we all agreed 5.stars is warranted!  Thanks rempel family for sharing.

Eh, not as good as the others have indicated.  If you're looking for something other than your traditional meatloaf, then go for it.  It was easy to make and it wasn't dry at all. I don't think I liked the combination of the ketchup and steak sauce.

I make it as the recipe reads - I do layer my pyrex with a couple of pieces of loaf bread - it helps absorb the oil.  Family loves it.

Made this last night and it was a huge hit - adults and kids. Didn't have dry onion soup mix so substituted with small chopped onion. Be sure to double the recipe since it goes fast.

Amazing chili.  I took other's advice and put 2 pieces of bread at the bottom of the pan.  They soak up all the grease.  I improvise and add steak sauce to it, but otherwise I follow the recipe.  Great leftovers.

This was just "eh" for me ... the cheese threw me off because of the glooby texture, kinda like fat in my mouth and my husband thought it gave a "funky" taste.
I did like another reviewer's suggestion of putting two slices of bread at the bottom to soak up the oil - genius!
Overall, this wasn't bad, but probably not something I'd try again. Too bad, I wanted to like it more.

I grew up HATING meatloaf, and my husband wouldn't even consider it for years - but this is so seriously delicious I could make it at least once a week.  TIP FOR THOSE WHO DON"T LOVE ONION - I sift the lipton soup mix so that the dried onions are not in there but the flavor is.  This makes all the difference.  I also am more generous with the ritz and the cheese and it is just so incredibly good.  I will never make another meatloaf - this is the ONE.

This came out great!  I didn't have crackers, so I added 1 cup of seasoned bread crumbs.  Instead of steak sauce I used honey bbq sauce.  Before baking I brushed the top with a mustard/ketchup/brown sugar mixture.  The flavor was just right...not too salty, not too sweet.  Served with garlic cheddar smashed potatoes.  Will be making again!

This is one of the few recipes I have given 5 stars. This is the first meatloaf that my family has ever loved. I followed the recipe exactly and added the glaze another reviewer mentioned that uses honey and ketchup. This recipe was definitely a keeper.

I generally don't like the meaty taste of meatloaf, but I LOVED this (and my husband loved me for making it!). I added half of a packet of dry ranch too for additional flavor. It does get a bit gooey, so I plan to use the suggestion of bread underneath next time I make it. Serve with a vegetable and mashed potatoes for a great, midwestern-style meal!

Delicious.  I used bread crumbs in stead of crackers and 1/4 cup of steak sauce.  I figured since I had extra lean ground beef I would need more moisture.  It was a hit, my husband and two sisters loved it.

I didn't care for this at all... not the texture, not the flavor - nothing.  To be fair, I consider meatloaf a comfort food.  I adore the meatloaf from Cracker Barrel restaurants, so I have a certain expectation.  Also, I made this by reducing the servings to 4, so that may also have had something to do with it.  While I don't have any desire to try this again, if I was forced to, I'd increase the crushed crackers.

I followed this recipe exactly.  My family thought it was ok.  I had to cook it about 1.5 hours because the middle wasn't cooked after 1 hour. There was a lot of liquid that came out of it while cooking.  I had to drain it and put it back in the oven to finish cooking.  I let it rest before cutting it, and it kind of fell apart a bit when slicing.  It was moist, but not a keeper in our family.

I wish I could give this recipe more stars!  This is my favorite recipe I have found on this site so far.  I make it exactly as written, and I wouldn't change a thing!  My family actually loves this meatloaf recipe!  I make it at least twice or three times a month.  :)

I have tried all of the top-rated meatloaf recipes on this site and this is hands down the best ever.  I have no need to try any other recipe.  I make this meatloaf exactly as the recipe states, except when I'm trying to be "healthy".  On those rare occasions I use 97% lean beef, reduced fat Ritz crackers and reduced fat Shredded Cheddar.  Still tastes amazing.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Great recipe!  I used 93% lean ground beef so I was scared it was going to be dry but it was supermoist!  I didn't have onion soup mix so I used vegetable and it worked out fine.    I took the advice of some other users and made the glaze. I was also cooking for two so I made mini meatloaves and froze the rest of the meatloaf mix.  Will definitely make again!

YEAH! it's just what I was looking for. I used 1lb ground turkey & 1/2lb beef, forgot to grab Ritz so I used bread crumbs and it turned out really good! I think this would work as meatballs as well.

BEST MEATLOAF!! Im not a huge fan of meatloaf - this was excellent!! I did substitute chopped white bread for the crackers. and I added some cheddar cheese and chopped tomato....ALSO - key to good meatloaf is to place a slice or two (I use 2) of bread at the bottom of the baking pan underneath the meatloaf to catch the drippings otherwise your meatloaf will be soggy and fall apart. GREAT RECIPE, try it!

Made this last week and it was fabulous.  The only changes I made were in using ground chuck (80/20), making a glaze for the top and placing bread slices beneath the loaf to sop up the excess grease.  Very moist and flavorful.  The family loved this.  Will most definitely be making it again.  Thank you, Connie, for a great meatloaf recipe.

An easy recipe with outstanding results.  Hubby said to always use this recipe in the future.  I added a sweet-and-sour glaze of ketchup, honey and cider vinegar, which I always use on meatloaf.

This is an excellent recipe exactly as is. I have made some adjustmenets since the first go-round that I like. I use ground bison instead of beef because of the lower fat content and I use double the amount of steak sauce because I like the added flavor of the steak sauce. We use this recipe A LOT!! A big THANK YOU to Connie for posting!

This was the best meatloaf recipe i've ever tried.  This is up there with Cotton Patch meatloaf! thanks! 
I added all of the onion soup packet and used 2 lbs of 80/20 meat. I've made this with the ketchup topping and without and this meatloaf is better without.  I put 2 slices of bread under the meatloaf and of course it worked out great.  Make sure to spray your pan down with non-stick cooking spray.

This was really good. I am giving it five stars but I did make one change. I didn't have onion soup mix, but had ranch dressing mix and used 1/2 a packet of that instead. Everything else was exactly to the recipe...the cheese was good and something I'd never tried in a meatloaf before. Next time I'll have some soup mix on hand, and I'm sure it will be wonderful too. Thank you for sharing a great recipe.

This is the BEST meatloaf I have ever eaten.  I made it for dinner tonight and my 5 yr. old son sat there and kept saying "Mmmm, Mmmmm".  He said he wants it again tomorrow night.  That was the best compliment I could get.  My 15 yr. old son who has never liked meatloaf said it was good also.  This is a definite keeper.  Thanks to the Rempel Family for this great recipe.

My hubby really liked this, he ate all the leftovers - which is a rarity in this house. I was not overly impressed - I should've bought leaner ground beef - there was WAY too much grease. I loved the suggestion of putting two pieces of bread at the bottom of the pan to soak up the grease then toss before serving.

Great recipe, full of flavor. I used parmesan flavored bread crumbs instead of the crushed crackers, used barb. sauce instead of steak sauce and removed more than half of the onions out of the onion soup mix. It still made a great meatloaf I will make many more times. We will have meatloaf sandwiches from the leftovers.

This is now my favorite meatloaf recipe.  It was really easy and really tasty.  My husband even asked about the recipe.  It's nothing all that extraordinary....it's meatloaf....but it's a really good meatloaf and really simple to make.  I made a few very minor changes to the recipe.  I used 1 lb of ground bison (easy to find at the grocery store these days, and we prefer the taste of it plus it's better for you).  I used white cheddar flavored cheez-its for the crackers.  I used mainly just the big flakes and not all the powder from the onion soup mix.  I subbed bbq sauce for ketchup.  I made a glaze by mixing up a little bit extra of the bbq/steak sauce mixture and setting some aside before adding egg to the rest of it.  The cheese I used happened to be a Mexican shredded mixture, but I don't think that was all that important.  It took about 50 minutes to cook.  Served with Julienne cut fries and corn and we gobbled it up.  Well, not the 4 yr old and 6 yr old, but I didn't think they would - they're too picky, still!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! This is by FAR the best meatloaf I have ever had! I never thought it could taste so goo. I followed the recipe exactly, using the recipe submitter's added suggestion of just using the onion flakes from the soup mix. I used crushed cheez-its since I didn't have butter crackers. I also used a store brand steak sauce since I thought that the taste A1 Sauce would be too overpowering. Like some other reviewers, I added a glaze to the top of the meatloaf before baking - ketchup, a dab of steak sauce and lots of brown sugar. I will NEVER use another meatloaf recipe again! Never thought I would love meatloaf so much! Thanks so much for this recipe.

Okay, so I am a meatloaf freak haha I love meatloaf! I always thought my mom's recipe was the best until I had this one...>WOW! The only thing I did differently was used worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce as I am not a fan. I also had to up the ingredients to make it larger because the original recipe would not have fed my family of 7. WOW, THIS IS NOW THE ONLY RECIPE I WILL USE FOR MEATLOAF! ***** stars from me!

Very good! Nice and moist with lots of flavor. I added some garlic powder and salt and pepper to the meat and for the liquid portion used a combo of ketchup, BBQ sauce, and the steak sauce.

My husband is NOT a meatloaf fan at all.  I have tried several different recipes over the years and nothing impressed him.  When he took his first bite of  this recipe the look on his face was classic.  He not only liked this meatloaf he loved it and he finished all the leftovers. Do not change a thing with this recipe it is perfect the way it is!

Sorry, but I really didnt like this. And I love meatloaf. I have never rated a recipe badly either.  It was quick and easy to make and it had great ratings so I thought it would be good. It just tasted like a lipton onion burger, the kind  we ate when we were kids. If you love lipton onion burgers, try this.

Make sure to use lean ground beef.  you may also want to put a piece of bread in the bottom of the pan to soak up the juices.  Other than that, it's very good.

This recipe is awesome and it's actually the first time I've attempted to make a meat loaf!

I made just a few tweaks.  Instead of one packet of onion soup mix I used half a packet of McCormick Meat Loaf Seasoning and half a packet of Ranch dressing mix.  I also used 1/2 c shredded cheese and crushed club crackers since that's what I had on hand.  I cooked this for the full hour and it was PERFECTION!  

Next time I will use meat leaner than 90/10 cos there was just a TON of fat even though I used the bread underneath trick.  I was able to pour most off it off.  Might even try with turkey burger.

My husband made this meatloaf for dinner at the firehall. It was a huge hit. He substituted the French onion soup mix for 1 medium diced onion and added a little garlic and onion powder as well. He and the rest of the firefighters said that it was the best meatloaf that they had ever had.

Wonderful!  I used ground turkey and no cheese to cut down on the fat.  I think it would have been better with lean beef, so I will use that next time instead of turkey.  I used crushed multi-grain saltines instead of buttery round crackers to make it a bit more healthy.  I tried the glaze another reviewer mentioned (ketchup, honey, and worchestershire sauce), but didn't think it went all that well (for some reason had an Asian glaze taste).  Next time, I'll just pour some ketchup on the top, as I do with my other meatloaf recipe.  I like this recipe because there is no onion or bell pepper chopping.  Thanks for sharing it!

Quite tasty and very easy to make. The addition of a glaze for the last 15 minutes makes it more flavorful. I used 1T brown sugar, 2T ketchup and 1T Worcestershire sauce for the glaze and it was delicious!

If my husband had rated this, it would have gotten 8 stars.  Couldn't quit talking about it.  I liked it, not as much as him.  Will certainly make again   
though, esp since it is so easy.  Thanks.

This was okay.  I think it needed a little something but it was still good.  To be fair though, I did make it with ground turkey [health reasons], so that probably took away from the awesome beef flavor.  The whole family liked it just fine.  I would probably make it again.

The family was evenly split in our opinion of this meatloaf.  My kids absolutely loved it.  They thought it was wonderful.  I didn't think it was that great, and the husband thought it was just "okay"  Not bad, I have certainly tried worse, but I have also had better.

This made an EXCELLENT meatloaf.  The flavor of the steak sauce was a little overpowering for me, though.  Next time I'll use a little less.

My husbands new favorite meatloaf. I really like the added cheese. My hubby always wants me to melt cheese on top of his anyway. This way its already in there! I just add a tad more than the recipe calls for, because we really like it cheesy. Excellent recipe!!!!

Connie, we loved your recipe. The only thing I did differently was to use two full lbs. of ground beef.   Delicious mixture, nice change of pace, and I'll be doing this one again. Thank you, and thanks for your most helpful review!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had.  My family started making this a year ago and we make it about twice a month!! We threw out all other meatloaf recipes and will never make it another way.

This was okay.  I'm not a fan of meatloaf but I did eat my portion of it.  We thought we had steak sauce but when we discovered that we didn't, we used barbeque sauce instead.  I think making it with steak sauce next time will be an improvement.  However, 2 eggs are way too much!  The meatloaf came out too moist, so next time we'll just use 1 egg.  Overall, it was good.

This is the best meatloaf ever. I've given this recipe to so many people, it is now a staple in many of my friends' and familys' homes. My boyfriend requested that I make it at least once a week. I even wrote a list and put it on his refrigerator: Keep on Hand for Meatloaf...
I've modified it a bit. I don't measure anything anymore since I've made it so often. I use far more cheese than the recipe says to and extra steak sauce. And I use 2 pounds of beef. I use Club crackers because they taste better than Ritz and sometimes I use mexican blend shredded cheese and beefy onion soup mix. This is just soooo good and soooo easy.

Absolutely fabulous meatloaf!  I made some changes - I did use the entire seasoning packet and didn't find it to be salty (I used lipton onion soup.)  I used one tbls. of A-1 spicy steak sauce and 1 tbls. heinz 57.  I put one heaping spoonful of minced garlic with some of the garlic juice.  I used cheeze its as others suggested.  I did 1/2 cup mexican blend cheese and 1/4 mozzerella cheese.  I also used the lemon, ketchup, mustard, brown sugar glaze that was put on the "Glazed Meatloaf #1" on top and was delicious!  Make sure to put a glaze on your meatloaf.  Will make again thanks Connie!

My family and I really liked this meatloaf.  Actually, I made it into patties, dropped the topping, and added brown gravy for a smothered steak kind of thing with mashed potatoes.  I also only used half or less of the onion soup mix.  Hubby asked for it again the next week!

This meatloaf was sublime!  I've gone through MANY meatloaf recipes trying to find the one with the right flavor and this was perfect.  I'm usually a person that drowns their meatloaf in gravy because often it's bland, but I didn't use ANY gravy when I ate this, that's saying a lot!  I took the advice of many of the previous posters cutting the onion soup packet down to 1/2 and using 1 tablespoon of steak sauce and one tablespoon of bbq sauce instead of 2 tablespoons of steak sauce.  I also used a "meatloaf meat" (beef, pork and veal ground up together) from the supermarket instead of plain beef.  Then spread some ketchup ontop before putting it in the oven.  My boyfriend said he'd never had meatloaf that was so soft and moist.  The texture was aboslutely wonderful, no problems with it falling apart.  I can't wait to make this meatloaf again!!!

I've tried making several meatloafs from this site for years and this is just simply the best.  Next time I'll cut the A1 and add some worschershire.  Regardless, this is a terrific recipe as is and seemingly easy to modify.

We enjoyed this. The cheese was little different from the more traditional meatloafs but in this case it helped the flavor even more.

This is one of the easier recipies I have tried for meatloaf. I didn't have buttery round crackers and used regular saltines. I ran out of steak sauce and used bbq. sauce. I also added a bit of teriaki sauce to give it a kick. I added more cheese sprinkled on the top in the last 5 minutes of cooking because my kids love cheese. It turned out really well. Will make again.

This was extremely moist, however, I was so excited to taste everything we put in, and only tasted A1 steak sauce!  I will try this again, with half the steak sauce nexx time.  Also, every meatloaf needs a glaze, so make sure to add one!

After reading the other comments about this being too salty, I only put in half the soup mix and used the lower sodium Worcestershire instead of steak sauce.  It still turned out way too salty.  We were chugging water all night.  Will not make again.

I have made this meatloaf so many times I can't even count anymore, my family loves it. I've played around with the recipe a bit after trying it as is, and it just keep getting better and better. I've added green and black olives...different cheeses...substituted Italian style bread crumbs instead of crackers...added in eggs and milk to keep it moist ....yummy I know what we're having for dinner tomorrow! !!

The most perfect meatloaf recipe I have ever tasted. Followed the directions exactly, did not need the extra liquid. 
My kids are the only ones on the block that get excited for meatloaf night.

This is the only meatloaf recipe I have used since I found it on 12/6/2009.  My family and I absolutely love it as is! and...that I can change it up if I want to, and it still turns out wonderful.  Sometimes I add the cheese, sometimes not, delicious either way.  I have used Panko breadcrumbs with a bit of skim milk, and added a couple finely grated carrots (or zucchini) to make it a bit more healthy.  I always use the glaze Connie recommends. I have an intolerance to MSG, so I get my onion mix (like Frontier Soups) from the local health food store. I have to do that with my Ranch and taco seasoning mix also, or make from scratch(good recipes on this site). It's a shame most big brands use MSG in their products.

I have made this recipe several times as my family says this is the best meatloaf I have ever baked. I recommend this to anybody looking for a delicious meatloaf with very simple ingredients.

I had never made meatloaf before. I love my Mom's meatloaf, but it always gives me heartburn. I chose this recipe because it looked easy and I like all of the ingredients. I'm giving this recipe 4 stars as it is written. I've made it a few times now and have made a couple of minor changes that makes it perfect for us. I use BBQ sauce in the mixture instead of ketchup, I use ground round (just enough fat to keep it moist, but not so much to make it greasy), I'm generous with the cheese (I like to shred my own Vermont Sharp White Cheddar), and I top it with ketchup and bacon before throwing it in the oven. I also mix the eggs, onion soup mix, bbq sauce, and steak sauce together with a fork in a separate bowl to make sure they are well blended before hand mixing it all into the burger. I think it reconstitutes the dried onion flakes in the soup mix better and also insures better distribution in the meat. Plus my Mom always says you don't want to keep handling and remixing the meat and beating it up. I form it into a loose football shape and put it in a loaf pan (a made for TV one that has a lift out tray for the meatloaf and holes to allow the grease to drain away from the meatloaf). A loosely packed meatloaf makes the texture lighter (which we like). If you like it firmer then smash it into your pan for a more solid texture.

Not bad. I didn't have the crackers so I had to use breadcrumbs. I loved the steak sauce and dry onion soup mix, but M was a bit confused as to why there wasn't any ketchup on top (as he's used to). It was fun to try something different but I think we'll stick to our usual meatloaf recipe (gotta keep the man happy).

This meatloaf was simple to make and delicious!! My husband, kids, and grandfather loved this! The only adjustment I made was I used  half to 3 quarters of a packet of dried onion soup mix rather than the whole packet.   I also smothered the top with a blend of steak sauce, honey, and ketchup. Awesome!!! The leftovers were very yummy on a hamburger roll the next day. This will be the only way I make meatloaf from now on!!

This is my go-to recipe for meatloaf. The only thing I do differently is add potato chips (sometimes flavored, sometimes not) rather than the crackers. If I do this, I used dried onions rather than onion soup mix, so it won't be too salty. Wonderful!

Family loved it!  My husband doesn't eat beef or pork, so we made it with ground turkey.  Served it with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  Perfect comfort winter food.

We liked this recipe. My husband thinks it will work well with Elk because the cheese adds oil and elk tends to get dry. My 2 year old son even like it and it was the first thing gone from his plate where he usually does not want to eat meat.

This is probably one of THE best meatloaf recipes I've EVER fixed for my Family. I did make a few small changes by adding 1/4 cup EACH of both Red & Green Bell Pepper & I made a "Glaze" of 1/2 Cup EACH of Brown Sugar=pressed in bottom of loaf pan & then Ketchup on top of that. Otherwise I followed the Recipe. My youngest son NEVER liked meatloaf, BUT he loved this one & asked for seconds! Needless to say, there were NO leftovers...They're already asking for another one!Thanks Connie for a fabulous meatloaf recipe!

This was my first attempt at making meatloaf as a meal for my family. I've had plenty of other peoples meatloaf, but this was so delicious for the many times I made it, that we tossed out the traditional Christmas turkey dinner, and had this instead. Thank you so much for sharing this and making it a part of my family's cookbook :D

So good! Even my picky eaters in the family ate this up!  It was on the salty side for our taste so I think next time I'll use the advice of others and use dried onion flakes instead of the onion soup mix or only use half the packet of soup mix.  Other than that minor change I wouldn't change a thing.  Delicious!

I have been searching endlessly for a good meatloaf recipe but all of the recipes that I tried seemed to be lacking something. Well, I am happy to finally be able to stop looking. I loved it and so did my boyfriend and my 3 year old daughter. I made it exactly as written and we all thought it was sooo yummy! It's definitely a keeper.

Pretty good!  I used the suggestion by shoegirl to put bread in the bottom of the dish to soak up grease, and the sauce listed in Connie's review.  The sauce was excellent.  I also added green peppers.

I made exactly as written and used A1 for the steak sauce. I was expecting a wonderful meatloaf but thought it was just ok. I only use ketchup on meatloaf that's not that good, and I had to use it this time :( 
The "Glazed Meatloaf II" from this site is wonderful!!

flavor was just OK.  Meatloaf just fell apart. Ina's was better.  This was moist, but I did not care for it.  Lord, let me find a meatloaf that is moist, flavorful, and will stay in slices.  I don't think one exists.

I made this tonight and fam loved it BUT, I was a bit disappointed b/c I did not "get" the cheese taste I had hoped for.  I used Cheeze-Its and increased by a 1/4 cup as was suggested by a reviewer; also increased shredded cheddar to 1 cup.  Will def make again - maybe with more cheese?  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  I made it for some company I had over and they asked for the recipe so they could make it the next night.  I used Cheez-Its because that is what I had on hand.

This was the best meatloaf yet. I used 2 lbs of hamburger as that was the size of my package. So I added more crackers. Also added dehydrated onions and used taco shredded cheese. My husband loved it.

O...M...G! This is the best meatloaf ever! Dare I say, better than mom's? I was a little put off by mixing the eggs with ketchup and steak sauce, but followed the recipe, adjusting for what I had on hand (No crackers, used bread crumbs. No steak sauce, used Tuscan Italian dressing. Added 1/2 pound of mild sausage). Didn't need to add extra spices or anything. Baked wonderful in less than an hour. Served with some nuked potatoes (I got lazy and didn't want to peel and cut up potatoes for mashed). Only comment: I might add some more bread crumbs, cause it was a little crumbly, but that doesn't bother me at all!

I am not a huge meatloaf fan, but my husband had been asking for it for dinner.  Total comfort food.  There was a lot of grease though, so next time I will take the suggestion of putting pieces of bread underneath to absorb some of it.

This was OK.  There was something missing and very, very greasy.  Edible though, and maybe leftovers will be yummier.

This is our new recipe for meatloaf. It was very moist and flavorful and got great reviews from my husband. I did not have any crackers so I used bread crumbs and we also ran out of ketchup so I used BBQ sauce.

I have always made the same old kind of meatloaf that my mother made and my mother-in-law too.  The kind with ketchup in it and on top of it.  I was never too crazy about it.  My husband actually really liked this recipe and so did I.  I will make meatloaf this way from now on.  I may try one of the other reviewers sauces the next time.  Thanks for your recipe!

I don't really go out of my way to write reviews, but I had to this time. I love meatloaf and have been on the hunt for a quick, easy meatloaf with the perfect texture. I had to use Hot and Spicy A1 instead of plain steak sauce, but that's the only thing I did differently from the recipe. I cut it down to 2 servings and it worked out perfectly. Thank you! This has become my go-to recipe for meatloaf.

Yup, this is it - my new go-to meatloaf recipe.  Just the right amount of everything.  It would be good without the cheese, but it does make it even better.

Fantastic meatloaf! I'm a meatloaf lover and my husband is not, so I was trying to find a different recipe to get him to like it - this one worked!!! I followed the recipe except for using ground turkey instead of hamburger.

I've made this recipe twice now, and the family has loved it both times.  My daughter doesn't eat beef, so I substituted 1 lb. ground pork and 1 lb. ground turkey, which makes the overall yield bigger, but doesn't adversely effect the taste, in my opinion.

Really good meatloaf.  
I want to add this update (11/27/17) that this is my go-to meatloaf recipe. It is absolutely perfect as-is, but I have been making this with ground turkey and I feel it's even better. Thank you Rempel family for sharing!

WOW.  This was WONDERFUL. If you are interested in changing it up a bit: I doubled the ground beef and added 1 lb of Jimmy Dean HOT breakfast sausage, an extra egg and Tony's Chachere's - but left all other measurements the same.  Because of a lot of reviews saying this could be dry, I added 1/4 c. of cream of mushroom soup and used worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce.  I also cooked them in muffin pans and cut WAY down the cooking time.  SO juicy. SO good.  Thank you to the Rempel Family for this recipe!  We will never cook regular old meatloaf again.

Not great. This is the second ground meat recipe I've made with onion soup mix and I think we just don't like that flavor. It dominates the whole thing, I couldn't taste the steak sauce or cheese at all. I did give it 3 stars because the texture was good and it stayed moist.

The few people that said it was not good or dry or something must be doing something wrong. This is easy to make, smells delicious while baking and when you add your favorite glaze for the last 20 mins it is simply awesome as written. Moist and same story here, meatloaf haters that enjoyed it. The only thing I changed was due to not having the buttery round crackers so I subbed them with keebler buttery smooth crackers... YUM! Thos who didn't like it, try making it again.

Great recipe!  I didn't have steak sauce on hand, so I used BBQ sauce with sone worcestershire added in.  This was a simple recipe that tasted great.

I had to comment on this recipe! Rempel Family - You do meatloaf right! This was the most flavorful & delicious meatloaf I've ever had. I used a little extra steak sauce (personal preference) & also used the Pork, Beef, Veal meat mixture (best for making meatloafs or meatballs). I will be using this as my go to recipe for years to come! My fiance told me that next time I can just make him his own loaf to eat alone :-)  Thanks for sharing a GREAT recipe!!

Best meatloaf ever! Two major things: use 97% fat free ground beef~ very small amount of extra grease in pan. I lined my pan with foil and checked the meat after 30 minutes of cooking to drain fat; there was probably only a tablespoon to drain. I followed the recipe to a T except per one review I did add a glaze on the top 5 minutes before it was fully cooked Glaze: 3TBSP ketchup; 1TBSP honey and 1tsp worcestershire sauce. My husband and 18 year old son ate seconds. It is definitely on my list to make again. Thanks for sharing!

this was delicious!  i remember meatloaf as being so bad however i wanted to make for myself at least once.  this will now be a dinner staple.  the only thing is i though it was a bit salty so next time i'll make sure to brush the salt off of the crackers.

My family ate this without complaint, but there are better recipes out there.  I thought the taste and texture of the onion soup mix was too pronounced.  OK for a fast weeknight meatloaf.

This was so easy and my family and I loved it.  I used Ritz crackers and only used the onion flakes and not the soup in the mix.  I also used the glaze of honey. ketchup, and worcestershire sauce.  I will be making this often.

I followed the advice of the author and sifted out the seasoning from the onion soup mix.  Don't do it! My meatloaf was bland! I also followed someone elses advice to soak up the grease by putting bread in the bottom... Don't do this either! It doesn't make for a very nice presentation. I was all excited about the Cheez-it's, but I couldn't tell! I think it's worth trying AS WRITTEN. ;)

Oh dear heavens to Betsy!!  This meatloaf is absolutely fantastic!  I had to make one modification though - substituting dried minced onions for the onion soup mix (I didn't have any on hand).  I can only imagine it tasting even better with the soup mix.  I had to cook mine for a full 60 minutes.   I will no longer make anything but this meatloaf.

Very good...will most likely make again. The only change that I made was that I added 2tsp more then the recommend brown sugar and added a 1/4 c. More of the bread crumbs...overall very good...even the kids who are picky eaters asked for seconds. Definitely would recommend to others

I thought this was good. Did make a few changes. Used Ritz Roasted Vegetable crackers, sifted out most of the powder from the onion soup mix. Also, my boyfriend doesn't like ketchup, so I used tomato sauce in its place. Put brown sugar, worcestershire, and tomato sauce on top before baking. All in all, pretty good!

Best.  Meatloaf.  Ever.

Used the honey/ketchup/worcestershire glaze recommended by Connie and it was perfect.

This was really good.  It's true what everyone was saying.  My BF doesn't really like meatloaf but really like this version.  I followed the directions exactly and cooked for about 55 minutes.  I did add the glaze someone suggested with the ketchup and honey and it was a nice added touch.  :)

Thought it was very good classic comfort food! I did add some breadcrumbs with the crackers and put ketchup on top during last ten minutes before being done. Would make again for sure.

This is a staple recipe I use once a month or so now. I was really surprised with the last low review but I will share my changes and that may even help the last reviewers feeling it was greasy:

Most of the time I make this with ground turkey. Now and then when I have a hankering for beefy flavor I will do beef but this really is a good one to try replacing with healthier turkey. If you have never used turkey and want to start being healthier, do half beef half turkey and slowly get the family converted : ) 
The other thing I change is I never cook it in a loaf/bread pan. If you used a fattier cut of ground beef and cooked it in a loaf pan it will be swimming in grease and perhaps thats what happened to the last reviewer. 
I just shape the meat mix (which is sort of sloppy and less firm than other meatloaf mixes) into a loaf shape and bake in a greased or pammed 11x 7 pan.
I usually frost the loaves before cooking lightly with ketchup or bbq sauce.
Ohh and if I am short on time I shape it into six mini loaves that are about 6"x2" (dollar bill size) top with ketchup and they are done in about 25-30 mins

An outstanding meatloaf recipe as this stands.  I did make a variation that was equally as good.  Instead of the Onion Soup mix, I substiuted Frenches Fried Onions.  Placed these into the food processor for a couple seconds just to bring down their size.  It melded well with this recipe and didn't add much salt to the meatloaf.  Also saved some of these onions to sprinkle on the top of the loaf prior to baking.  This gave the meatloaf a little crunchy top when it was done.  I added a two tablespoons of Franks Hot Sauce to the top of the meatloaf prior to baking.  It just added a small kick to the bite.  Nothing to object to.  It's a great flavor.  I also added some grated romano to the cheeses.  This is a great meatloaf.  I believe the cheese gives this a nice, moist consistancy.  It's not dry.  Monitored the internal temp to 160 as suggested with a meat probe.  A good idea so as not to over cook this.  A true 5 star recipe !!

Made it exactly like it calls for only didnt have the steak sauce so used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce in place of that and it came out sooo awesome! I added the complete packet of onion soup mix and didnt find that it was too salty like another had said. In the future I think I'll add some more seasoning in the form of herbs but I think everything it calls for was just perfect!

Yummmmmm!!! This is a great recipe. I made it a few times but never got a chance to review it. The only thing I do different is that I use Diana Sauce for Gourmet Rib & Chicken instead of the ketchup. It gives it a great taste & I also add a pinch of cinnamon & a pinch of allspice to the mixture.

Yummy. I made this adjusting it to 8 servings (and these are HUGE servings, by the way). I used 1/2 ground turkey, 1/2 ground beef; subbed crackers for tortillas. Everyone loved it. Have made this before with the same results (everyone loving it). Thanks for sharing.

This was great! I used 2lbs hamburger and 3 eggs, for the steak sauce I used A1.  I cooked for almost an hour at 350 with foil on it.  Then coated it with the mixture of 3T ketchup, 1 T honey, 1/2 T A1, took foil off and cooked for about 15-20 longer. It was moist and flavorful! DH says the best he ever had.  Kids even loved it.  I also put bread at the bottom and I see how it does catch the grease, great idea.  Will make again!

Very good.  My husband loved it.  I used mozerella cheese because I didn't have cheddar.  It was VERY good.  Will get rid of other meatloaf recipes and use this one.

I followed this recipe exactly, except I did not use the crackers...I did not want to add any additional fat.  I used extra lean beef (96/4) and used wheat thins in place of the crackers.  (just what I had on hand)  I don't think this makes any difference in the flavor.  I used Knorr French Onion soup mix and A1 steaksauce.  I really, really liked the flavor, a lot.  My fiance liked it, but also said it tasted like onion soup.  My picky 6 yr old who likes nothing at all..didnt like this lol.  This is definitely a keeper for me. I love love the onion soup flavor in this, and how easy it is to make.

Very good! Would've been better if I'd followed the directions. I only had saltine crackers so I used them and my meatloaf came out a little salty (duh). It was still good but I'll go by the original recipe next time.

I wasn't that excited with this.  I followed the recipe and even caught the update from her to sift the onion soup bits out.  I'm going to go back to my TT recipe.

This was great.  I used 2 lbs of ground beef, but didn't change any other ingredients.  My husband and I love the crusty edges so we do a free form meat loaf on a cookie sheet.  That way there is more browned edges, and I upped the cooking temp to 360 so that I could get a little more crust built up.  BUT the ingredients were great and the steak sauce is subtle but tasty.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  We are keeping it in our recipe book for future use!

Okay, I have been meaning to write a reviews to this for AGES..... I have been making this recipe for as long as I have been on AR, and it is so far the BEST recipe... I don't even make my mother's recipe anymore.  LOL! Two things I wanted to say:  1) The ONLY change I make, is BBQ sauce instead of steak sauce (we never have steak sauce in the house, but tons of BBQ sauce).  Sometimes I use Kansas City-style BBQ sauce, sometimes I use Korean style.... depends on the mood of the day.  Try different BBQ sauces with your mood.  2) (And the main reason I wrote this tonight).... this meatloaf is STILL good, moist and juicy, even when overcooked.... *laughs*.  My husband and I are gamers, and tend to forget things sometimes.  I forgot to put on the timer, and we forgot about the meatloaf.  It was in 20 minutes too long, and was STILL delicious:)   THIS is the ONLY meatloaf we make now:)

I never make any other meatloaf than this one. Started out with just the basic recipe which was phenomenal, and as time has gone by, I've added some things. Like instead of buttery round crackers, I use roasted vegetable ritz, I added a little extra garlic, soy sauce (I like salt, don't judge lol) and then doubled the recipe. Omg. Yum.

This recipe was very good. I used the traditional ritz crackers and only used half of the onion mix since many said it was too salty. I actually would have liked a little more salt so I might add the entire package next time. I put a ketchup, brown sugar and worchestershire sauce glaze on about halfway thorough. It came out very moist and delicious!

I used this recipe as a guide and modified it to what I had on hand and my preference.  I used 1 lb. of ground sirloin and 1 lb. of ground pork, for the cracker crumbs, I used 1/3 c. Ritz crackers and 1/3 c. Cheez-Its, used 1 c. cheddar cheese, sifted onions from dry onion soup mix (as suggested), 1/4 c. diced onion, 1/4 c. diced green bell pepper, 2 eggs, 1/8 c. ketchup, 2 T. steak sauce, pepper to taste and though this sounds weird but tastes awesome is 1/4 c. cocktail sauce (It gives a great zip to the meatloaf but is not distinguishable).  I cooked in 350 degree F oven for 75 minutes.  Did not top with any sauce but left BBQ and steak sauce at the table - none was used as the meatloaf was great without it.  AWESOME RECIPE!  Thank you for posting.

I followed the suggestions of adding bread to the bottom, adding some spices and the ketchup/honey/worsteshire topping, and it is the best meatloaf I ever tasted.  I used a combo of 93/100 and 90/100 ground meat.   I used left over gouda cheese from a dinner party but look forward to using cheddar.   I never though meatloaf could taste this amazing. Thanks for the recipe and the suggestions.

While I was making this meatloaf, I realized that it's almost exactly the way my dad makes his burgers. Same ingredients except for the eggs and ketchup (which would go ON the actual burger after cooking). It's a keeper for the rare times we do make meatloaf. Do yourselves a favor though and follow the other reviewers suggestion and put bread at the bottom of the dish. Best way to get rid of the excess grease.

The best meat loaf I've made in a very long time. I added 1/4 tsp liquid smoke and my husband really enjoyed that. I also glazed it as suggested with 3 tblsp. ketchup, 1 tblsp. honey, and 1/2 tsp. worcestershire sauce. I heated it till the honey was melted and smooth, spooned it over meatloaf before baking. Yummy!

My husband loved this dish he asks me to make it at least once a week. I listened to another suggestion and put bread at the bottom of the dish I used to cook the meatloaf and it soaked all the extra grease up and I just threw them away. Also this tile I will add ketchup to the top and bake it and see how it turns out!

Loved it. I had Peter Luger's Steak sauce and Lipton Golden Onion soup mix on hand. This is a keeper for me. I generally just make the version using the original Lipton Onion soup mix but not any more. thank you Rempel Family.

I kept the ingredients the same as the recipe states...namely I didn't sift the onions out of the onion soup mix and it turned out awesome!  THIS is now our meatloaf recipe.  I used 1tbs honey, 3tbs ketchup and 1/2 tsp worchestershire sauce glaze on mine.  This was completely gone...everyone loved it!

I am married to a cattle rancher so the beef supply is not a problem! This meat loaf was outstanding. We all loved it. I wanted meat loaf sandwhiches for tomorrow but its all gone. You can really taste the steak sauce and onion mix. YUMO! 5 year old and 12 year old loved it too. Excellent! Thanks! Only suggestion is make 2 pans so you have those great sandwhiches the next day!

Absolutely delicious.  Sifted out the onions from the soupmix and used only the onions as directed at a later comment by the submitter.  Did not change anything else.  My entire family loved this!  Other meatloaf recipes were not successful.  Thank you so much!

Was really good and pretty easy. I did not have the grease problem....actually the opposite. This was the dryest meatloaf I made in a long time and it took a lot to clean out that pan (3 days worth of soaking for some reason!) but it was delicious!

Very yummy!  Even my husband who "hates" meatloaf liked it.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I used the ketchup/honey/worchestershire sauce glaze and it was fantastic.  I also used the 2 slices of bread on the bottom of the pan trick to soak up some of the excess grease.  Just make sure you get all the bread off the bottom before you serve it because it is pretty mushy.

I cooked this meatloaf this weekend and both me and my hub loved it. I used regular crackers and Lizano Salsa from Costa Rica which is wonderful instead of steak sauce. I baked it 10 min more and when I served it didn't fall apart at all. The only changes I will make the next time is to put some more cheese, less Ketchup and on the bottom some sliced of bread to suck the grease and leave the meatloaf more consistent

I like a good meatloaf, one that is flavorful and works good the next day for cold meatloaf sandwiches!! I loved this recipe!! The only thing that I should have done was make a double batch!! Husband who is not a meatloaf fan even liked this. I did notice during cooking that it had a lot of grease in the pan like some of the other reviews pointed out so mid-way through baking, I just dumped it out and put it back in the oven. It took the full hour for mine to be done. I did make a glaze and put it on top but even without it, it would have still been good. Like other reviews who thought it was salty, I did not have a problem with that at all but I would recommend using a good onion soup mix like Liptons.

Delicious!!  I followed the recipe as written except I substituted the ketchup/steak sauce with BBQ sauce. VERY TASTY!! I also pressed some brown sugar into the bottom of the pan with a squirt more of BBQ. When it was done, I flipped it over and had a wonderful glaze!!

Haven't made meatloaf in years and my husband had a sudden desire for it.  Did I go to one of my many cookbooks? No, I came to allrecipes and found a recipe for a delicious meatloaf.  I did add 1/4 diced green pepper.  Don't know why, just thought it might enhance the meatloaf.  It didn't.  I am not a fan of steak sauce and think next time I will leave it out and add instead some French's Fried Onions.  Otherwise, I will make it  as per recipe.  Thanks, Connie.

I have used a recipe from a Lipton Mushroom/Onion soup box for the last 20 years.  Every so often I try different recipes but the kids have always preferred the original.  I tried this recipe and my family voted this meatloaf their favorite!  I found it a little bland.  Next time, I'll use the Mushroom/Onion mix for a little more flavor and the glaze suggested by "Connie".

Delicious! I have made this so many times, that I have found some of my own variations that I love, but it's good as is. I usually use a mix of beef, pork, and sausage (equal parts beef and pork and about 1/4 pound of sausage). I also use the flakes of the onion soup mix and only half of the powder. I add about a tsp. of minced garlic and a dash of worstershire to the egg mixture & I use about a cup of cheese. I also use a pan that has holes in the bottom and I place another loaf pan under using wads of aluminum foil to separate them. This allows the meatloaf to drain while cooking. I always use a glaze on top too. Worstershire, Ketchup, and Honey. I have had many compliments on this meal. Best ever!

This is a super salty recipe - with the onion soup mix, ketchup and steak sauce it is overwhelming.  Other reviewers have recommended sifting out flakes and not using the rest, because of the salt content.  I would say... just use dried onions instead of onion soup mix.

We've made this about 3 times. Every bit gets eaten and everyone loves it! I use A-1 steak sauce and we don't sift out the powder in the soup mix, as it doesn't seem too salty for us. This is THE meatloaf recipe from now on. Love it!

This would have perfect if i had used a leaner meat.  Thankfully, someone recommended putting bread in the bottom of the pan and it helped soak up alot of the grease.

I did sift out the powder from the onion soup mix like the submitter wrote in her review, and we really enjoyed this.  Tasted great the next day too on a cold meatloaf sandwich.  Kids liked it too.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly except I did sift out the power in the soup mix - only using the flakes and added a simple glaze of 3 T ketchup, 1 T honey and 1 T worcestershire sauce...it was awesome. Even better the next day in a sandwich.

Hands down the tastiest meatloaf recipe!  I made it the first time with cheddar cheese but decided to make it a second time without to take down the calories.  Personally, I liked it without because I found it to be too greasy with the cheese.

My husband crinkled his nose when I first made this meatloaf, because he said he wasn't "big on meatloaf," but when he tasted this, he loved it.  He's even requested that I make it from time to time, so he's a convert!  I crave this recipe sometimes, especially in the dead of winter when some good ol' comfort food is all one needs.  I've experimented with this recipe from time to time -- little things like different flavored crackers and different types of steak sauce.  In short, it's hard to screw this one up, and it's a nice versatile recipe.

Ok, I will say upfront that I HATE meatloaf!  It's nasty and the consistency is horrible.  My wife and family are always disappointed as we never have it since I won't eat it.  My wife wanted me to try this one and I must say, it made me a believer!  I had two helpings and it was great.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband would never eat meatloaf growing up, and was very hesitant to even try this when I made it. He loved it! Thank you! I also added a glaze to the top of mine made with mustard, ketchup, and brown sugar.

This is the best! First time making it, so I followed it to the letter.  It was so moist and flavorful.  I even followed Connie Rempel's added advice and sifted some of the salt out of the onion soup, used cheese flavored crackers.  My family is starting to think that I'm a great cook!

This meatloaf is the best I've had.  I used half a packet of the onion soup mix, because I didn't feel like sorting out the dried onions.  I also couldn't find the cheese flavored Ritz, so I used normal.  The only thing I'll do different next time is to double the recipe and make 2 loaves.

My favorite meatloaf recipe is still the Tantalizingly Tangy meatloaf also on this site (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Tantalizingly-Tangy-Meatloaf/Detail.aspx), but this is a good 2nd choice. I love these ridiculously easy recipes; it almost seems unfair that such delicious meals are so simple to prepare. This will go into our regular rotation. Thank you!

This was THEE best meatloaf I have ever had!  Great flavor!  I followed the recipe exactly; perfect.  I would reccommend making it as the recipe suggests the first time around and waiting until the second time (and there will be a second time) to make any changes.  It was pretty greasy on top when I took it out of the oven, but that did not take away from the taste in the least.  Wonderful!  This is my new standard for meatloaf recipes!  Thanks Connie!

There is so much stuff in this meatloaf that one taste over powers the next. One thing that really stood out was the steak sauce. I was suprised because according to 1094 people this is the best meatloaf they ever tasted.

This was "OK." Nothing special (IMHO). Made this for my bf & I this past week. It was quick to whip up AND I had all of the ingredients on hand (HUGE plus!). I had to make a few changes to suit my/our tastes, however. Here's what I did: a) subbed ground turkey breast (all I had), b) used crushed cheddar Ritz crackers & equal amounts of cheddar & mozzarella cheese as Connie suggested, c) 'sifted' out the onion flakes from my packet of dried soup mix (again, Connie's suggestion) & d) made a glaze of 3 T katsup, 1 T honey & 1/2 t W sauce as many other reviewer's did. My pkg. of turkey was 1.25 lb., so I scaled this to feed 5 & adjusted all measurements accordingly. I also added a few 'pinches' of the dry soup powder to my meatloaf mix (hint: to sift the flakes from the powder, use a wire mesh strainer set atop a lg. bowl; give it a few good shakes to loosen the clumps of powder, using your hands if necessary). I was concerned at first b/c my meatloaf mix. was VERY 'wet,' but the finished product turned out great (perfect consistency after it sat for 5 min.)! To boot, I barely had any grease to deal with :) While my bf & I thought this was good (we both had seconds), we agreed that it was not 'great' & that I should continue my search for a meatloaf that better suits us. My bf commented that it was a shame that we could barely detect the cheese (a waste of calories).  Served w/ scalloped potatoes, peas/carrots & french vanilla ice cream w/ choc. syrup for dessert! Thx. for sh

This was awesome. The only thing I did different is took the suggestion of another member and made 3T ketchup, 1/2t steaksauce and 1T honey and coated it on the meatloaf about 30 minutes through. Next time will also put break on bottom as another user suggested to soak up grease. I didn't think I would have much grease because I used 93% lean hamburger meat but you still do.

This was excellent! best meat loaf I've ever had. Followed receipt to a T.  I did make a glaze for the top with brown sugar, ketchup, mustard, worstershire, etc. and added that on the last 15 minutes. Very good. Will make again.

My boyfriend made this last night for dinner and it was hands-down the best meatloaf we have ever had.  He wasn't exactly thrilled when I announced I wanted a meatloaf night.  I strategically picked this recipe because of the ingredients...he loves steak sauce and cheese. :) It was so good!  It really tastes great!  So easy to make also.

I have made several meatloaf recipes over the years, searching for one which our whole family could agree on.  This is the one!  I made some adjustments (see below) so that it would feed our family of six, and even my usually picky 14 year old daughter loved it and had seconds.  Here are the adjustments I made:  2 lbs lean ground beef instead of 1 1/2, 1 cup crackers instead of 1/2, 3/4 cup ketchup instead of 1/4, and 2 1/2 Tbsp steak sauce, instead of 2.  I also substituted Monterrey Jack cheese for the Cheddar, because I didn't have any on hand.

This is sooo good. I try not to use a lot of artificial ingredients with preservatives in my cooking (i.e. onion soup mix), so I left it out, using 1/2 cup of minced onion instead. I was trying to find a substitution for the Ritz, but couldn't think of anything, so I ended up caving in and using a box I had left over from a Christmas gift. This was a wise choice. The crackers make the meatloaf quite tasty.

I'm on the hunt for THE meatloaf recipe, and for us this is the one.  I, too, didn't add the entire pkg of soup mix.  I added some garlic and onion powder and pepper.  I also topped w/ glaze of honey, worch. sauce, and ketchup.  We loved it, and not a bit left over!  Too bad! ;(

I'm a vegetarian - fiance is NOT. So learning to cook meat dishes has been somewhat of a fiasco! The exception to that is the REMPEL FAMILY MEATLOAF!!! Fiance said it was better than his favorite meatloaf at the store!! Feeling so thrilled to have actually made something not only edible, but positively enjoyable! Very easy to make!!

Very easy recipe and it came out delicious! The second time i made it i used ground turkey and because of the ketchup and steak sauce, no one could tell the difference! I also made it into mini meat loafs in a large cup cake pan and cooked it only 40 minutes. I intended on freezing a couple for later but there was none left!

I have never been a fan of meatloaf, but my husband likes it so I have tried it numerous times over the years. This is the first one I've tried that I really liked.  It was very easy too.  I didn't have "Cheese Ritz crackers" as recommended by Connie Rempel in the first review, so I used a mixture of traditional Ritz crackers and Cheez Its.  Worked very well. The meatloaf held together well, and was moist and flavorful.  Will definitely make this one again. Thanks for the post.

I never liked Meatloaf growing up, so I have been looking high and low for a good recipe. This one was fantastic! I made it exactly as the recipe was written the first time and was blown away at how moist and flavorful the meatloaf was. The second time I added a diced onion and a diced green bell pepper to the mix as well as some "Cajun Power" garlic sauce. This is now OUR family meatloaf too! Thank you for sharing it!

AMAZING!!!!  I've been using allrecipes.com for 7 years now and this is the first time I felt the need to rave about a recipe.  I only had 1 pound of gr. beef so I added a few more crushed crackers but that's the only changes.  It was incredible.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This was great.  I did as she noted on her comment in the most helpful section.  Also, I added one carrot I did peelings/shavings.  I also added one red pepper diced & used dried onions.  Added one tablespoon ketchup to the top.  Used bread crumbs.  Still turned out good!  We prefer the sweet meatloaf but hubby is newly diabetic so we are trying to make adjustments!

I thought this meatloaf had very good flavor but mine kind of fell apart when it was cut. I will try it again and maybe use a little more cracker crumbs to hold it together. I put a glaze on top which consisted of 1/3 C ketchup, 1/3 C brown sugar and 1 T dry mustard.

So delicious! I'm another reviewer that is not so much a "meatloaf" person but this was really delicious. Not your ordinary plain meatloaf. I did make a few changes...I used crushed cheez-its as that's what I had. I also used half ketchup and half BBQ sauce in the egg mixture. I topped it with the suggested glaze by a fellow reviewer (we all agreed the glaze is a must!). Mine took 1 hour and 30 minutes at 350 to reach 160 degrees on my meat thermometer. My 6-year-old said it reminded him of his favorite White Castle hamburger :) Really, really good recipe. Thanks for sharing it!

This was delicious.  I was worried about it being too salty because of using the whole packet of onion soup, but it was perfect.  Very tender.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and lowfat Ritz crackers.  Very good, will make again.
*UPDATE* I made it again with ground turkey but instead of crackers, I used 1/2 cup of oatmeal.  Like some others, I made a glaze using 1 Tbls honey, 3 Tbls ketchup and 1/2 tsp Worchestershire sauce.  It came out great.

This was fantastic and I don't even like meatloaf - I just made it after my husband begged for it and I really liked this recipe.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and put bread in the bottom of the pan to soak up the grease and I also made a glaze that you brush on top before cooking:  3T ketchup, 1T honey and 1/2t worchestershire.

If your meatloaf recipe doesn't get the family cheering, try this one! Children included! One of my step-sons requested this as his birthday meal, he loves it that much!
After making this in a loaf pan for over a year, I decided to try using a muffin pan instead. It cuts the cooking time in HALF! I seperated the mixture into 10 muffin cups. Now it's even less time to an awesome family dinner on a work night.

I've made this recipe at least one a week for about a month. It's easy to make changes (1/2 ground beef, 1/2 turkey...) and each time I have been pleased with the results. The only thing I want to add as a novice meat loaf maker is to never use anything other than lean ground beef. I couldn't believe the amount of fat I drained out. Newbie mistake.

This was really good considering how easy it was to prepare.  I don't make meatloaf often and when I do, it's usually pretty boring.  I did not add steak sauce but a little worcestire instead.  That's the only change I made.  Very good.

This recipe was simple and delicious.  Being a garlic lover, I added some minced fresh garlic.  Also, when I put bread under my meatloaf to soak up the grease, I use thick sliced stale bread.  Works much better than thn cut fresh.  I am also a fan of a pinch of cayenne being from Louisiana.  Kids don't even notice if I don't go overboard.

I thought it was pretty good.  But hubby didn't like it all that much. Tasted a little to much like steak sauce.

This was very moist and tasty but the onion soup mix was a bit strong.  I think I may do half as much mix and add in some cooked onions next time.  My husband loved it and he's not a big meatloaf fan.  Finally I can make meatloaf for dinner! Thanks, great recipe!

This is a tasty recipe but I don't think it can beat the Brown Sugar Meatloaf on this site. I used barbecue sauce for the steak sauce. I sifted out the flakes from a packet of powdered onion gravy (couldn't find onion soup) and used the onion flakes and 2 tsp of the actual gravy powder for a little extra flavor. This was a very tender meatloaf, so much so that it didn't hold tegether very well; maybe an extra 1/4 cup Ritz crumbs would make it firmer? I might make this again, but I'll probably return to my brown sugar recipe. :) Thanks anyway!

This meatloaf was VERY good - I set it on a broiler pan and didn't have any problems with excessive moisture/grease. The outside of this meatloaf was the best so in the future, I'll make two mini loaves instead of just one. I couldn't find cheddar Ritz so I made due with Goldfish crackers and they worked great. Thanks for the recipe !

This was totally awesome. My husband and I loved it. It’s worth six stars. Changes: Used dehydrated onion flakes instead of onion soup mix. That reduces the salt and I didn’t have it. ;)  Added 3 Tbsp of steak sauce instead of two, and used an 8 x 12 pan so we can remove it from the dish. Oh yeah, its meatloaf so we use our hands to mix it up.  I definitely recommend using a 93/7 ground beef over an 80/20 as the cheese can produce a lot of oil and the very lean meat produces (shock) less grease.  Super yummy. It is going in the file!

This is the BEST meatloaf that I have ever tasted. My husband and I have been making the old meatloaf with oatmeal for years. We tried this new receipe and feel in love with it. The meat sticks together well and has a wonderful taste. Don't change anything! It is perfect as is. Thank you so much for sharing!!!!

Good tasting meatloaf.  I used garlic Ritz crackers and about 2 lbs. 90/10 hamburger.  Used a cooking rack, but, did not have much grease at all.  I added 2 more tablespoons more A-1 steak sauce.  The glaze was the kicker. 1/4 cup katsup, 2T. A-1 marinade, 2T. honey, 1T. honey mustard, 1T. brown sugar and 2T. Zesty cocktail sauce w/ horseradish.  Made a slope in the middle and, WOW good combo.

Amaaaaazing!!! YUMMY!  My first time doing the meatloaf since i was brought up around a family who said meatloaf was a waste of hamburger. It turned out GREAT!  My boyfriend (like many guys apparently) is not a huge fan of meatloaf. He said, and I quote "Oh my gosh, Wow! This is....the best meatloaf I have ever had babe" Definitely a keeper!

This was pretty good. Everyone in my house liked it. I took other reviewers' advice and cut down a bit on the onion soup mix. Also, I used Worchestershire sauce instead of steak sauce, since that's what I had on hand. I mixed ketchup & dijon mustard to make a glaze for the top. Yum!

This was excellent. A piece of bread in the bottom of the pan was definitely helpful to soak up the grease. This glaze also made it great: a good glaze for the meatloaf is 3T ketchup, 1T honey and 1/2t worchestershire.

Delicious! I hate the grease leftover though so instead of putting it in a loaf pan, I form the loaf and place it in a 9 x 13 pan. The cheese burns but it beats eating all that grease. Also, during the last 15 minutes,  I add a glaze: 3 tbsp ketchup, 1 tbsp A1, and just a splash of tabasco. We love the little kick it adds!

This meatloaf was so flavorful and moist. I increased the cheese by about 1/3 a cup.  I made the brown sugar meatloaf the other week, and my office thought it couldn't be beat--this kicked it's butt out of my recipe book! Obviously will make again. I think next time I will add in some green peppers and onions to the mix. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was good!!! I did add a few additional things like a finely chopped onion and some Worcester sauce. I added some ketchup, steak sauce, mozza cheese and CLUBHOUSE spicy pepper melody to the top of the meatloaf about 20 minutes before removing it from the oven. This was truly an easy and tasty meatloaf!!

This is a good meatloaf recipe but I like a bit more 'kick' so I added some hot sauce - don't know if we are allowed to use namebrands here.  Another way to 'help' this and any meatloaf recipe is to form the loaf, place on a foil covered baking sheet and bake.  The grease cooks out and away, much better than cooking in the grease stuck in a loaf pan.

I'm vegetarian, so I'm going on the comments of my husband and two daughters. My husband thought the onion soup was overwhelming,one daughter said it was "OK" and the other didn't like those crunchy things (crackers) in it. Sorry.

***Please take the other reviewers advice and add bread to soak up the grease! 
It doesn't taste like the "typical" meatloaf recipe like I remembered as a child.  It was MUCH better.  My boyfriend also gave it rave reviews!  The flavor in this meatloaf was delicious.  It was also very moist. Thanks Rempel Family, this recipe will now be my favorite meatloaf recipe!
Update-11.12, my boyfriend told me last night that we should make this recipe once a week.  I'm trying to get him to agree to once a month.  52 days of meat loaf is a bit much for me, but it sure is a great recipe!!!

Def. will be my staple meatloaf recipe!! So moist and delish!! I did make a couple changes however...I used 1/4 ritz crackers crushed in food processor as well as 1/4 cup oatmeal which I ran through the food process as well. I also used 1/3 cup egg replacer instead of 2 whole eggs. Other than that everything else the same YUM YUM! Oh also, i used 93% lean meat and it was still nice and moist!

this is a delicious meatloaf however my lips tingled for 2 hours from all the sodium. i knew this recipe would be salty since the soup mix, crackers, cheddar, catsup & steak sauce are loaded with the stuff. i sifted out the dehydrated onions (retaining the bouillion) to cut the salt back a tad & substituted 1/2 chopped onion instead. thanks for your family recipe connie but i won't make this again because of health concerns.

Very tasty meatloaf! I really like the addition of the cheese; it makes the meatloaf so moist. I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be a little too wet. I added a few more crackers than was called for to get the right texture, but other than that, no more changes were needed. Thanks to the Rempel family for sharing this recipe!

The best meatloaf I've ever made.  I used saltines in place of Ritz crackers.  Also, used 1 lb ground round and 1/2 pound of meat-replacement crumbles (made from soy).  Was excellent, got rave reviews from the hubby.

This was very good. One thing I did different was I only added half of the egg mixture to the beef mix. It started to look watery. Came out great. I also did mini meatloafs in stead of one big one. Cooks quicker. Thanks Connie for sharing this one. It replaced my last recipe.

This was excellent. We baked it in several mini loaf pans so that it would cook faster. Everyone had their own individual meatloaf. We also added ketchup to the top of each one before we baked them. Everyone loved it and couldn't believe there was cheese in it.

Let me preface this review by stating that I LOVE meatloaf.  However, I was disappointed in this recipe.  I deviated only in adding freshly ground black pepper and glazing the loaf as suggested by another reviewer (2 tbsp. of ketchup, 2 tbsp. of honey and 1 tsp. worstershire) but the flavor, in my opinion, was merely mediocre. It is very easy, however and very simple.  Thanks anyway Rempel Family!

I've tried making many meatloafs, and this is the one that my family has liked the best. I used beefy onion soup mix (because it was all I had on hand) and cut the steak sauce in half because I'm not a big fan of steak sauce.

The left overs were even better tasting two days later. 

It's also one of the easiest meatloafs I've ever made.

What a wonderful recipe!  I doubled the recipe and used a mini-loaf pan (available @ cooking stores) to make 8 individual servings.  The loaf was tender and extremely flavorful!  A real winner :>

This was my first attempt at meatloaf, and it was great!  When my husband came home and found out I had made meatloaf he started raving about how great his Mom's BBQ meatloaf was, so I was a little worried, but as soon as he took a bite, he loved it!  I didn't have any steak sauce on hand, so I just add a bit of worchestire sauce.  I also top the meatloaf with about a 1/3 cup of ketchup mixed with a little mustard and about 1.5 tbls. of brown sugar before I cook it.  It was great!!  UPDATE 6/15/10:  I have made this dozens of times and it is STILL the best meatloaf I or anyone I make it for has had.  The extra suace I make for the the top is the best part!  I have tried freezing it in a foil pan after preparation but before cooking for future meals and it turns out OK, but definitely best fresh

This is a great meatloaf.  I did make some changes to the recipe.  I left out the cheese. I added some fresh minced garlic.  I used the whole onion soup mix but increased the ground beef to 2 lbs.  Substitute the cracker crumbs with bread crumbs. Another reviewer's suggestion to line the bottom of the pan with bread was genius!  It kept the loaf above most of the grease in the pan.  I freeze old bread just for this purpose.  Try it you won't be disappointed!

After reading the positive reviews, I was looking forward to making this. Followed the recipe exactly, and it was the greasiest meatloaf I've ever seen - in spite of using very lean beef. It also fell apart when taken out of the pan. My family thought the taste was just ok. I wish I had taken other reviewers advice about putting bread in the bottom to soak up the grease. Using 2 pounds of meat may have helped keep it from falling apart. Guess I'll have to keep looking for a meatloaf recipe that we like.

Per the recipe submitter's "review", I used the onion flakes only from the onion soup mix to avoid too much salt.  I think I might like to increase the steak sauce and use two packets of the onion flakes, rather than just one.  I kind of missed not having a sweet topping on it, such as the one in this website's Brown Sugar Meatloaf which I think we prefer.  Can't wait for meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow though!  Thank you!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had, and I grew up having the mom who made 'the best meatloaf,' even though I always had to put ketchup on hers.  No need for ketchup on this meatloaf, it is FULL of flavor!!!

Very good! It's nice to find a meatloaf so moist and flavorful that it doesn't need a glaze. That said, I agree with the "little salty" comments from previous reviewers. I did pull out a tablespoon or so of the onion soup mix because of their warnings. You could easily go up to 2 lbs. of meat for this recipe. Just add a little more catsup, steak sauce, cheese and breadcrumbs. I cooked it (1.5 lbs. 90% lean ground beef) for 1 hr., and it was still very moist, and it was delicious cold, too. Hellllloooo meatloaf sandwich in tomorrow's lunch. Also - I tried the bread trick to soak up the excess fat. Worked like a charm. Try this one!

I've made this meatloaf quite a few times. It's now our meatloaf of choice and we love it. The only change I made was cut the soup mix in half and added half a small onion, minced, for texture. I also use extra lean beef.

I always hated meatloaf.  However, this is very tasty!  As others suggested, I placed bread on the bottom of the loaf pan and I'm glad I did as it was very oily.  I also used 3/4 C of breadcrumbs instead of the crackers.  I used worstershire sauce in place of steak sauce.  Next time I may cut down on the egg to reduce the oiliness.  It is very good and I will make it again!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I LOVE meatloaf but the rest of the family doesn't feel the same way. I made this last night and they LOVED it. I did make a few changes as suggested by others: added bread to soak up the excess fat and added 3/4 cup of round crackers. I didn't have steak sauce and substituted 1 tsp of liquid smoke(mesquite). I of course always searching for healthy lowfat meals subsituted eggs for egg whites and used lowfat round crackers. It came out sooo flavorful! If my husband claims it's outstanding and barely left any for my teenage son then I know this a keeper!

Sorry, but we found this recipe to be entirely too salty.  I didn't have quite a pound of ground beef (I used ground serloin), but went ahead with the recipe as posted.  It was super salty!  I won't try this one again, but if you do, I would make certain that you use at least 2 pounds of beef.  Thanks for the recipe, though.  I might try a version of this again, only adding half of the Onion Soup Mix and use breadcrumbs instead of crackers.  It did turn out nice and moist, though.

This is excellent and as close to the one my mom made before she passed away but never got the recipe for.  This is true comfort food, moist, tasty and so easy to make.  I just used a special meatloaf pan that has the insert with the holes to keep the fat from the meat.  This is a keeper and thanks for sharing.

Excellent meatloaf recipe.  I was so tired of my usual recipe with the sauce on top and was just looking for a down-home meatloaf.  This fit the bill for us.  I followed the receipe exactly as written with no problems.

Using lowfat cheddar gets rid of the greasiness from the cheese.  I also use only half of the powder and all of the minced onions from the soup mix.

I am not a big meat eater, and I have never made meatloaf before. I decided to make this recipe based on the excellent reviews, and that we had some ground beef in the freezer that would not last too long. My husband wasn't excited - the last time he ate meatloaf was as a child (his mother's recipe), and he never liked it. I convinced him to give it a try and boy am I (and he!) glad that I did! He LOVED it! I have never seen him wolf down a meal as fast as he did,let alone wolf down seconds! I made this with his favourite veggie Asparagus (pan fried recipe from this website) and I was so surprised to see him take a second helping of meatloaf with not even the remotest interest in the asparagus! I loved it too - almost went for seconds but stopped myself as I'm watching my weight :-). I used: 2lbs extra lean ground beef, half and half crushed ritz crackers and bread crumbs, chopped green pepper, garlic paste, teriyaki and worcestershire sauces (we didn't have any steak sauce), half the cheese, half a packet of lipton onion soup mix sifted to remove most of the salt, and the 2 eggs and amount of ketchup in the recipe. I also added some hot sauce for an extra kick, and used some of the sauce mix as a glaze prior to baking. The texture was perfect and it didn't fall. It was like something out of a magazine! I served with some mushroom gravy (canned). It was an excellent meal and if my husband has anything to do with it, I will be making this often. Great recipe!

Excellent, though I did make some modifications. I used stove top stuffing (savory herb) instead of cracker crumbs, used real onion instead of lipton soup powder; added green pepper and celery and mixed cheeses such as swiss, casserole and shredded parmesan cheese. I added salt/pepper and garlic powder to taste. i also lined the pan with nonstick foil and put a 1/4 cup packed brown sugar on the bottom and covered that with 1/4 cup ketchup before packing the meatloaf down on top of it. Also, I took a piece of the mixture before baking it and fried it on the stovetop to make sure I had the seasonings done right. My husband HATES meatloaf and always grumbles when I make it, but he was raving about this one!

This is very good. My hubby thought that there was a bit too much cheese. I think he might be sick because you can never have too much cheese! This meatloaf appeals to the different palates at my house. Thanks for the submission!

I am SHOCKED! I am a 49 year old veteran meat loaf HATER! It is a meal that makes me shrink as few others do. BUT I have a husband that likes meatloaf, so every 5 years or so I cringe and stir up a batch, figuring I can just lose weight that day. WELL! This meatloaf is SO good! The only change I made was to add 4 slices of crisply cooked and crumbled bacon before baking, and topped with a thin layer of shredded cheddar. AWESOME recipe! My family will now enjoy meat loaf as often as once per month! Thank you, Connie!

My family loves meatloaf, so we have been trying different recipes for years.  The one that we have been using most recently is the one on the Lipton Onion Soup package, and we THOUGHT we really liked it.  Until I made this recipe.  I made it exactly as written, and was told by my entire family that this is the only meatloaf recipe I am allowed to use from now on.  It is delicious!!  Thanks, Connie, for sharing this jewel with us.

This was very good, I stuck the recipe except for using cheddar goldfish crackers (there are no cheddar ritz available anywhere around here) used A-1 for the steak sauce, sifted the onion soup mix & put in half, and added garlic and a little oatmeal. It had a really good flavor. I cooked it in a bundt pan and it took about an hour and 45 minutes (I used at least 3 lbs of meat since hubby likes the leftovers in his lunch)I like to make a mixture of ketchup, mustard and a little sugar (can use brown or white) to put over the top the last 15 minutes or so. Thank you! I will be making this one again

Now this is comfort food!  This was my first time making meatloaf and it turned out delicious.  I followed the changes submitted by Connie Rempel on 06/11/02 and modified based on what I had on hand.  I used regular flavored Ritz, smoked cheddar, and mozz. cheese.  I also added the glaze recommended by Kinz on 08/01/02.  Perfect for those cold days!!  Thanks Connie!

This was an excellent meatloaf.  I doubled the recipe to make two loaves.  The only change I made was using 1 1.4 oz. of Knorr french onion soup instead of 2 1 oz. packages.  I also covered the loaves with about 3/4 c. mixture of ketchup, scant sugar and worchestire.  The texture of the loaves was perfect, with just the right amount of saltiness.  My sister-in-law also brought meatloaf to the party - mine got gobbled up on 2nd servings but hers did not!  The only change I would make in the future is to add a dab of hot sauce as the author suggests; not to make it spicy but just to add a little punch.

I am not a meatloaf fan in general, my husband however loves it.  I found this recipe and LOVE IT! To speed cooking, I use a bundt pan.  I also substitue half the ketchup for steak sauce for more kick.  This is a family favorite and we've had it several times.  Thanks for sharing it Connie!

My husband is a gourmet chef, and he loved this meatloaf.  He told me this was a keeper and to make it again! My kids and I loved it as well.  It was delicious and definitly different from the old hum drum.  I recommend this meatloaf to anyone who likes flavor.  I had no problems with it staying together.  It was the perfect texture.
Thanks for the recipe!

Our family has never liked meatloaf, but after reading the reviews I had to give it a try.  This was VERY good; the best I've ever tried and much better that my mothers.  Moist and flavorful. I did only add 1/2 package of the onion soup mix (to reduce the salt).  The meatloaf did fall apart after taking it out of the oven, but at the suggestion of another reviewer, I let it sit and it did firm up.

My husband LOVED the recipe.  One of his favorite meatloafs. But, I thought it was extremely salty.  I will try it next time cutting down on the soy and the onion soup mix.  And seeing the cheddar soup comes in low sodium.

This meatloaf was very good.  It smelled divine while it was baking and was much more flavorful than other meatloaf recipies that I have tried.  Like some other reviewers mentioned, mine didn't hold together very well.  My only other complaint is that it was a bit too salty for my taste.  I will make this again for sure, but I won't use all of the onion soup mix next time to cut back on the salt.  Thanks for a good recipe.

I've never met a meatloaf I didn't hate so my personal opinion of "it was less terrible than any other meatloaf I've had" is quite a compliment. The other members of my family LOVED this recipe (even my 2 year old picky eater!). I was instructed to throw away any other meatloaf recipes I might have and use ONLY this one from now on. :-) Thanks for such an easy, delicious receipe!

Great meatloaf!  My family thought it was absolutely fabulous.  Our two-year old finished it on her plate and pointed for more!  Very tasty, nice presentation.  My only negative comment was that it didn't hold together well; next time I'll work the meat together more.

I made this last nite & it was GREAT! SO MOIST & GREAT flavor. The only thing I did differently was to add ketchup on top during last 15 min. of baking. It was a HIT in my family!! From the 18 month old, to the 12 yr old, to my boyfriend!! Not to mention, ME! 
Definitely a keeper! Thanks!! :o)

This was a good meatloaf, my husband even liked it, and he doesn't care for meatloaf.  My kids liked it too, and I will make again in the future.  The soup mix makes it smell soo good while cooking.

This is the best meat loaf I have ever tasted, and believe me I have tasted quite
a few.  I added half ground lean turkey.  I will make this again.  AAAAA+++++

This recipe could not have been easier for someone who already has very little time and manages what little of it she has poorly.  My husband said that this could not be meatloaf because they aren't supposed to taste that incredible.  Thank you!

Thank you so much, made this meat loaf tonight and it was absolutely stunning. It is mid summer in South Africa at the moment, I served the meatloaf with a side salad and sauteed mushrooms. Brilliant

I've made this too many times to count! Only change I make is halving the amount of onion mix and adding chopped onions .
All love it and I'll never try another recipe, this is it for us.

Adding a glaze and reducing the steak sauce by half made it a winner.  I can't believe someone gave this one star because it was "too fat and unhealthy" -  seriously?   Go find a turkey meatloaf recipe then.    You had to know going into it that it was fattening not "healthy" - just read the ingredients for pete's sake.

Followed the recipe exactly, and was extremely pleased with the results. The next time  I added bacon strips (2) to the top the last 5 minutes in the oven and then mixed Ketchup with brown sugar then covered the cooked bacon with the mixture, and then I added Cheddar Cheese on top of that and let  the Cheese  melt for  5 minutes more.

I made this exactly as written and my husband and I both loved it! It's important to use lean ground beef to avoid an overload of fat. The cheese and A-1 sauce are a nice addition. 
My go-to meatloaf recipe from now on!

I already have a good meatloaf recipe that the hubby likes but I was in the mood for something different. I asked him if he wanted me to make it with onion soup mix and he said yes. I was on a quest for a good recipe and came across this one. It went over well. Everyone came back for seconds, always a good sign. This will be getting added to my recipe box. I didn't change anything. We had mashed potatoes with homemade beef gravy and it was a very yummy meal. Thanks for sharing it.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever had! The onion soup mix is the key ingredient here! It adds wonderful flavor.  First time I made it as is, wonderful! Then I tweaked it a little afterwards, I suggest using 83% ground beef as the added fat makes it really juicy, and I used CheezIt crackers crushed instead of Ritz, either way are wonderful, I thought the cheese crackers were just an added flavor that made it really good. My mom even said it's the best she's ever had and it's now a regular in our house.

Thought this had great flavor. Have made it twice and getting ready to have again this evening. Made mashed potatoes and gravy. Great winter comfort food. Substituted homage enchilada sauce for the ketchup. Added a nice spicy taste.

This recipe is fantastic! I love meatloaf and have tried numerous recipes. This one surpasses all others (sorry, Mom!) While doubling the recipe on one occasion, I found that I only had one package of onion soup mix. Even this version was amazing!!!!! This recipe is a "must have" in your collection! Thanks for sharing it!

I have made this meatloaf twice now and it's really good.  The first time, as is, and it was great.  The second time, I added just a splash of worchestchire sauce and gave it a tiny bit of a kick.  Really good though either way...

Made this tonight and my husband and I loved it! He usually doesn't like my meatloaf but he actually went back for seconds! I cooked it the full 60 minutes and added the sauce which was recommended by other viewers (ketchup, honey and worschestershire). Remple - 1  Me- 0

I didn't like it.  i thought the steak sauce overpowered it and I didn't use a whole packet of onion soup mix and I thought that sort of gave it a not-so-great taste also.  I liked the idea of the crackers and cheese.  Next time I will increase the amount of ketchup and use my own spices, salt, pepper, garlic and onion.  If you really like steak sauce, then this is for you.  Maybe it's the steaksauce I used- i don't know.  I used A-1 brand and my neice said it was spicy (which is wasn't) but she didn't really like it.

I was skeptical because it sounded too easy. Made the following changes - didn't have ketchup so i used 1/4 tomato sauce, few squirts of mustard, worcheshire, and melindas habanero hot sauce. Also used ground deer instead of beef. This was awesome!!! My husband loooved it, he had it for breakfast and lunch the next day and told me to keep the recipe :) thank you!!!!

Very flavorful & juicy without being overbearing. I used regular Ritz instead of the Cheese Ritz, used only the onion flakes from the soup mix as suggested, and 1 1/4 TBSP. Worchestershire sauce instead of steak sauce. 55 min. at 350 F. was perfect for the toaster oven. My picky son ate every bite. I might make it next time with either sliced jalapenos or bacon mixed in.

This is the best meatloaf out there! I have eaten a lot of good meatloaf but nothing stands up to this. Every one of my 5 children love this and that is saying something. The recipe is wonderful as it is written but for an even added touch of pizzaz make the glaze in Delia's "Glazed Meatloaf II" recipe and use 1/4 cup of it for the ketchup in this recipe and then use the remainder as a glaze on top per the instructions in Delia's recipe. WOW!

I think this would have been good but I may have have overmixed the meat (learned that from Paula Deen)so it came out a little gummy.  I have never done it with Crackers before.  The flavor was pretty good and the Crackers made it more rich and buttery.  I want to try it one more time and see if it comes out good next time.  I love Meatloaf and like to try all different recipes.

Ive tried many meatloaf recipes but never found one I wanted to be my go-to meatloaf.  This recipe is officially it! I'm sure It would be perfect as written, but ground turkey was what I had on hand so I used that.  I had to add more crackers (used 30 crackers total) because turkey is a little wetter in texture.  I did the bread in the pan trick too.  Perfect flavor and texture!

It was ok. I followed the recipe except that I used 2 lbs. ground beef so I increased other ingredients accordingly. I didn't care for the cheese so I will omit it if I makes this again.

I have played around with meatloaf recipes for years and have been frustrated that I couldn't find one that everyone liked. Until now! Delicious! I used Worcestershire sauce instead of steak just because I didn't have steak sauce in the house. Will definitely make this one again.

Loved this recipe. I used what I had on hand we only had 85% lean beef but that was ok, because I know I always can drain it before I put the glaze on. I didn't have dry onion soup mix, instead I used 2.5 TBS dry minced onions. I used toll house light buttery crackers. Baked it for 25 minutes, drained the fat out and put the Connie's glaze recipe 3 TBS ketchup, 1 TBS honey, 1/2 tsp worcestershire, then baked it another 25 minutes, I then turn on my oven light to see how it looked & set the oven to broil for less than 2 minutes to make my glaze topping look good. Hubby loved this recipe and so did I. We liked this recipe more than the brown sugar meatloaf. Thank you!

Made this just as written.  I had an old favorite meat loaf recipe that my family loved, but tried this just for the change.  Oh, my goodness!  Who knew meatloaf could be so different?  My hubby LOVED it and said, "No offence, the old recipe was great, but this is the best I've ever had."  Thanks so much.

I really like this recipe the only thing that I will change next time is using  half the package of onion soup mix the whole package kind of overpowered the taste of the meatloaf. And using the bread slices underneath worked wonderfully!

I've made this meatloaf a few times and it is a definite 5 stars with the changes I made. Totally new recipe, I know, but it's sooo good this way I just had to share (-:

I halved the onion soup (next time I'll just cut it down by a quarter), added a few extra squeezes of ketchup, liquid smoke (maybe 1 tbsp), worcestershire sauce (maybe 2 tbsp), cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp), and 1/4 c brown sugar. I subbed the plain crackers with cheddar goldfish crackers. 

The glaze mentioned in one of the first few reviews is a must, as is placing bread on the bottom of the pan to reduce grease. You could just dump it out a few times while cooking. I did that the first time I made it and it worked out fine. I wouldn't try it when I double the recipe, as I did this time. 

I didn't have time for the loaf to cook so I just threw it into the skillet and browned the  out of it. Again, I did double the recipe and it took maybe 10 minutes for a third of the batch to cook. It turned out to be a delicious "loose meat" sandwich on country potato bread, topped with American cheese and a little mayo. The extra onion soup mix wasn't missed when this recipe is used as a sandwich filling, but I'll be sure to add that onion soup (minus a quarter) the next time I make it in loaf form.

Think I'm in the mood for a snack lol

Not a fan! I thought I would copy the recipe exactly but did use 1 pound ground beef & 1/2 pound of ground pork. The meatloaf was salty and was a little mushy. Won't make this again

This is a terrific meatloaf recipe. I substitute ground turkey for ground beef and it is even better.  Add a few additional spices such as basil and oregano and this is a really winner.

I think the cheese made it far too greasy for me. 
The steak sauce flavor was OK, and the onions were nice, but I wanted something more - for example, adding some dried herbs of some kind would have been nice. I won't make it again as-is; I would probably reduce the cheese and add some dried herbs.

Love this recipe. I followed the recipe and it turned out great. Only complaint I have is that it is really greasy, but I think the comes with the meatloaf territory a bit. I just drained the grease. I had tried someone's step of placing the bread underneath, but that just left me with bread stuck to my meatloaf. Everyone loved it anyways, greasy and everything. I love the taste, it has some unusual meatloaf ingredients and that's what makes it so tasty!

I've tried dozens of meatloaf recipes looking for the perfect one, and this is it! Definitely going in our regular rotation! I made a couple of minor changes to this recipe. I used half ground beef and half ground pork, and I used a 10x5 loaf pan instead of a 9x5, then I transferred the loaf into a broiler pan for the last ten minutes to crisp up the sides and bottom. It was cooked perfectly in 50 minutes. Loved it!

This one is a keeper.  I minced onions, red pepper and one clove of garlic as substitute for dried onion mix.  Added seasoned salt - pepper blend. My son hates sauces so didn't put any on top.

So good! Ours fell apart, but it may have been because we didnt use lean ground beef... And the extra grease made it too soft to hold together but the taste was fantastic!

This is great, kid friendly meatloaf.  Everyone loves it. You can just throw everything into a bowl and mix it all together with your hands; the extra steps aren't necessary. I always use 1 T Worcestershire sauce and 1 T A1.  Although it's best with buttery crackers, when I don't have them I substitute for other crackers or bread crumbs and that is good too.  Also, I always do the ketchup/honey/Worcestershire glaze, which my mom did too. Don't forget to use lean beef.  One time I didn't and it was a greasy mess.

This is one of the only recipes I have made that the WHOLE family loved (in my crew of 7 picky eaters)! They said, "Mom, you should do a cooking contest!" Wow... that might have been one of the best feelings I've ever had at the diner table. Thanks for a great recipe! I followed it exactly and won't change a thing!

I'm not a fan of meatloaf....at all....but this is like a meat party in my mouth!!  I sometimes use herb seasoned stuffing in place of the crackers.  I've also tried bar-b-q sauce instead of the ketchup and steak sauce.  YUMMY

I've been making this recipe about twice a month for years. The only things I do differently: I use 1 lb. ground beef & 1 lb. ground turkey, I use 1/8 c. ketchup + 1/8 c. BBQ sauce, a Tbsp. Worcestershire, and I only use half the packet of onion soup mix. I also make a ketchup-mustard-brown sugar topping that I pour over the top for the last 15 minutes of cooking. One of my kids accompanies her meatloaf with extra BBQ sauce. This make delicious next-day sandwiches.

Made this for weeknight family dinner.  It has a very dense, meaty texture (which I'm not sure was a good thing); however, we found this meatloaf to be seriously lacking in flavor.  Even my 'carnivore' husband said he likes my old standby meatloaf recipe better. 
  Think I'll go back to using my old meatloaf recipe -- it's more moist and has more flavor.  The leftovers of mine re-heat much better (especially for next-day meatloaf sandwiches! Yum!) as it is more moist.  Also, I missed the tiny bits of green pepper/onion/tomato that I enjoy in my recipe.  (BUT . . . I might use the "glaze" from other reader's Tips on this recipe, on my own!  So something gained at least!)

Followed the recipe to a T. Meatloaf was moist, but lacked taste.
I'm going to have to disagree with those who think that this is the best meatloaf recipe.

I made this meatloaf tonight and my family loved it; even my picky 15-year old asked for a second serving!! I did tweak the recipe just a little; it calls for ½ cup buttery crackers and I used a full cup; in addition I also substituted ¼ cup of Kraft Smokey BBQ Sauce in place of the 2-Tablespoons of “Steak Sauce” it called for.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  My family left only a very small portion for me to make a sandwich out of the next day at lunch.  Delicious!!

The first time I made this I didn't have any steak sauce. I used soy sauce and worcestershire instead. I've made it 2 more times since then, and find that a little bit of each of those (along with the steak sauce) makes it so much better! Great recipe!

Wonderful meatloaf!!  I followed the directions exactly and had a perfectly moist and tasty meatloaf on hand.  I will note that I had to cook it for about an hour and 45 minutes in order for the internal temp to reach 165.  Also, I put 2 slices of bread on the bottom of the pan to soak up the grease, and made a glaze of ketchup, brown sugar, and mustard to coat the top.  I put half of the glaze on when it went into the oven and the rest halfway through. Overall, a VERY good meatloaf!

This is just about fantastic.  Instead of ground beef, I used lean ground turkey so there was NO GREASE at all.  For the crackers, I used the Ritz Baked lower fat/calories.  I think the reason this was so good is due to some other suggestions like the glaze (honey, ketchup, etc) which I used as a layer between and on top.  Also, I added a layer of Feta cheese to the center.  My oven may not be exact but 350 is a little low.  It wound up in the oven about 1.5 to 2 hours.  Regardless, the flavor is awesome and I highly suggest using ground turkey or chicken instead of beef.  No grease/fat and holds all the flavors really well.

If you really want to add flavor and consistancy to the meatloaf, add 1/2 pound of pork sausage to each pound of hamburger and for extra moistness, add a portion of milk...cookingfriend...

I am not a fan of meatloaf myself, but my husband loves it - tried this recipe with the hope that I might tolerate meatloaf more and I have to say that I liked it.  As for my husband, he LOVED it!  And my kids even ate it which was surprising to me since they are younger and in 'picky' phase when it comes to food.  Other family members (who happen to like meatloaf in general also) have had it and they said it was really good, one of the best they've had...  So this one is definitely a keeper in the recipe box...

I added chopped parsley, onion, garlic, a tiny bit of chopped fennel and omitted ketchup, steak sauce and dry onion.  Also instead of round crackers put some bread crumbs.  Of course salt and pepper.  It was superb!  Cooking time was about 50 minutes.  Definitely will make again!!

By far, the best meatloaf recipe I've tried yet. Perfect consistency, not too wet, not too dry, and my father inlaw ate it like it was his last meal. Spectacular!

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED IT!  A couple of little changes:  i used ritz garlic butter crackers, instead of just the traditional ritz:  and i added three slices of bacon to the top and then a glaze:  Glaze consisted of such: 
1/3 cup brown sugar 
1 tablespoon lemon juice 
1 teaspoon dry mustard 
½ cup ketchup 
placed the bacon on top of the meatloaf and added the glaze then baked it.  
IT WAS AWESOME!  the boyfriend loved it, and I HATE MEATLOAF and I loved it. Will cook it again and again and again, it is a new recipe of mine!  Thanks!

Love this meatloaf! Used a mixture of pork and beef, and it turned out great! Only tweek I would make is putting a little sauce on the top of it before you bake.  I used 1/4 cup ketchup mixed with 2 TB brown sugar, 1/4 teas dry mustard, and a pinch of nutmeg....YUM!

Good meatloaf, easy, no crazy ingredients. I topped with some bacon I wanted to use up. Probably won't make anytime again soon, only because there's so many other meatloaf recipes out there!

This is one of the best meatloaf recipes ever!! I hated meatloaf growing up as a kid, and my husband loves it, so, I'm forever in search of a recipe we can all enjoy. This is now the gold standard in our house!! The glaze recipe in the review by Connie definitely puts this meatloaf over the top!

I only gave this 4 stars because I did find it a little too salty. Next time I think I will up the amount of ground beef to two lbs or either use low sodium ritz. But other than that it was nice and moist with good flavor.Very close to my mother's meatloaf but she never added the cheese.

This meatloaf is crazy good.  I followed the recipe as written, the only change being I used crushed up goldfish crackers since I didn't have any butter crackers, and other reviewers had mentioned using cheese crackers.  And I used a shredded cheddar/mozzarella blend since that's what I had on hand.  I whisked up the egg, ketchup and steak sauce together before adding it to the meat.  I also made the glaze suggested by other reviewers, and it was tasty, but I don't think it added anything to the meatloaf.  the bites without the glaze were just as good as the bites with.  Yummo Connie, thanks for sharing!

Thanks Remple Family, whoever you may be. This is the best meatloaf I ever have had. 
I made a topping with Ketchup, Worcestershire sauce & Brown Sugar because I believe all meatloaves should have a glaze!

I really liked this recipe! It was super delicious, but the husband and I think we should add some Green Pepper and maybe Celery next time. We didn't add the steak sauce because we didn't have any, so we used Worcestershire. YUMMY!!!

I haven't sliced it yet but grabbed a little piece and it tastes and smells awesome.  Can't wait until my husband is done with chores so we can eat.  I didn't have steak sauce so the only sub I made was adding about 1 T of barbacue sauce instead, otherwise I followed exactly.

I know it's summertime and not meatloaf weather, but I was rating another recipe and figured I should rate this one while I was at it.  This is my go to meatloaf.  Quite a change from boring meatloaf.  I follow the recipe to a T and it's moist and flavorful every time.

I thought this recipe was good.  I made it for my daycare kids and half of them liked it and the other half didn't.  Your choice of steak sauce will make a difference because it really is a strong flavor in the meatloaf. I followed this recipe exactly but if I make it again I will use less steak sauce.

Wow, amazing meatloaf!! Made some alterations, used Ritz Cracker chips instead of buttery rounds, omitted the cheese, and before I put it in the oven took another reviewers suggestion and added ketchup and honey glaze, but I also added 1T of chives, and 1T of purple onions. Boyfriend went up for seconds! Delic!!

Instead of the onion soup,I added chopped onions and tomatoes. Used a1 as the steak sauce. It was great! My husband loved it, and it was perfectly shaped and didn't fall apart.

I tried this recipe in my never ending search for meatloaf that will slice neatly the next day. This did.  I'll be honest now and say that after following the beef/crackers/egg ratio, I went off on my own, adding extra seasonings and leaving out the cheese. It made really yummy sandwiches today so thanks for that! :o)

I made this dish last night, and we loved it.  I did add one thing... a few tablespoons of BBQ sauce.  And it really tasted great with this recipe.  Next time I think that I will make a double batch of this recipe and make meatloaf sandwiches throughout the week.

This was delicious! I didn't have buttery round crackers so I used reduced fat cheese nips instead and I didn't have steak sauce so I skipped that. My hubby also wanted me to stuff this meatloaf so I stuffed it with deli ham and mozzerella cheese. I know that I didn't completely follow the recipe and people get annoyed with that but I just wanted to say that this was the best meatloaf I ever had the way I made it. I think it would have been just as fabulous without stuffing it as well.

This is a very good one. I do one thing different though, for moisture I add about 1/2 of a can of tomato juice to the meatloaf and increase the buttery crackers just a little. It is moist when it goes in and moist when it comes out. But rarely are there leftovers! Of course ketchup on top before baking.

I made the recipe as is and my hubby and son loved it. They usually are not big meatloaf fans, but they both agreed this one was very good. I have tried several meatloaf recipes over the years, and this is our favorite.

I was never a big fan of meatloaf until I made this recipe. It's definitely a keeper!  To cut down on the saltiness, I only use half of the envelope of onion soup mix. Thank you Mrs. Rempel!

Great recipe!  The meatloaf turned out super moist, at first I thought there may be too much liquid, but it mixed up fine.  I used dried onion flakes instead of onion soup mix as suggested.  Also, topped the meatloaf with steak sauce and ketchup before putting it in the oven for an hour.  Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious.  I read the recommendations and added 1/2 cup of ketchup and also saved some of the egg mixture to glaze the meatloaf with approx. 30min. of cook time left. I also used 1/4 cup of buttery round crackers and 1/4 cup of crushed Cheez-Its.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Definitely have to strain out all the powder from the onion soup packet.  I used onion/mushroom which I liked alot.  Maybe cut down on the amount of steak sauce.  I had to use plain saltines as that is what I had on hand. Otherwise, we all really liked this!

I left out the onion soup mix because I didn't have any, but put in onion powder.  I was not impressed but maybe that's because I left out the soup mix.

I used Turkey instead of beef, left out the cheese, added fresh garlic.  Not my favorite, but that is because I used turkey, the recipe was very good.  I did save some of the egg mixture for the top!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever made. Instead of all beef I used a meatloaf mix made up of beef, pork, and veal. My husband loved my old meatloaf but I wanted to try something new. Wow! It was good!

Pretty good!  I didn't read the chef's comment about separating out the onion soup mix so was very worried about saltiness after I put it in the oven.  No need to worry!  No need to worry!  I had also added the honey glaze per several recommendations; it was just the perfect touch and most likely countered the possibility of too much salt.  Would make again.

Amazing!  I used a little extra crackers, and swapped worcestershire sauce for steak sauce (we don't keep any in the house), but this was GREAT!  I want it to be lunch tomorrow so I can eat the leftovers!

I hate to give bad reviews, but this did not taste good at all.  My husband and I both enjoy meatloaf and we couldn't even eat it.  I saved it for leftovers thinking it may get better the next day, and it was just as bad.  I don't know what went wrong.  It was very greasy and just had a bad taste.  I was hoping to find a different type of meatloaf to add to the rotation, but this certainly isn't it.

I had never eaten meatloaf let alone made it before. I saw that this recipe looked simple so I tried it. It was super easy. I added the ketchup/honey/worchester glaze that an other reviewer put on here (I doubled it). I think it would have been boring without out it! I enjoyed it & served it with mashed potatoes. It was very watery/greasy from the fat draining from the meat-I will have to try to drain it next time. It did fall apart a little, but who cares?! Not my favorite recipe on here, but definetly a keeper for easy/cheap dinner ideas. Thanks!

So excited! I just prepared this with a few minor changes and WOW! :) Thank you so much for sharing, Connie!!! I have long sought such a wonderful meatloaf recipe. I omitted the cheese and used crushed cheddar goldfish crackers. I used Beefy Onion mix and didn't have steak sauce so I used 2 tbspns of ketchup with (about equal amounts) onion powder & honey to substitute. I cannot wait to make it again. Thanks!

My meatloaf-hating husband ate this (he also hates onions and peppers and all kinds of other things...).  He actually ate his whole piece that I served him, and had no complaints other than the onion soup was just a bit too much.  Next time I'll put in less of that, but otherwise it was yummy.

Followed the recipe as written.  It was just OK, nothing amazing.  Totally edible, but don't think it was worth making a 2nd time.  Sorry.

my family HATES meatloaf but LOVES this recipe! It is delicious. We use a muffin meatloaf pan to make this version and it's always a hit :)

I made this exactly as the recipe called, only adding a ketchup and worchester sauce glaze.  In my 6yo daughter's words "Mom, this was the best supper ever", we all loved this meatloaf.  Next time I will cut back on the onion soup a little, otherwise is was great!  I'm keeping this recipe and making again!

I love it!  I didn't have steak sauce handy so I used about 1/4 cup of barbeque sauce and 3 splashes of worcestershire sauce along with the ketchup. I also only used the flakes of the onion soup mix.

increased cracker crumbs by 1/4 cup as other reviewers suggested and only used flakes in the onion soup mix as submitter suggested. this meatloaf was fantastic! my boyfriend loved it, he ate 1/2 the meatloaf and then the leftover piece as a sandwich at work the following day.

I chose this recipe since it was so close to how I make mine...only problem, since I was winging it, some days it was good, some days just ok. Thankfully now it is awesome everytime!! Great Recipe, only change I made is that I use the Beefy Onion soup mix and Worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce and it gives it a really great flavor!

Pretty good, but the onion soup mix was a little overpowering. Adding a ketchup based glaze helped some.

No, not for our family = it doesn't have the traditional tomato taste that we love in a meatloaf.  The cheesed also made it very high in fat.

This was the best meatloaf I have had in a long time. I had stopped making meatloaf because I couldnt seem to get the flavor I wanted and this was it. I noticed that there were several reviews that said that it was to salty and to use only the onions out of the soup. This makes no sense- that would take away from the flavor and wouldnt the recipe just call for dried minced onion? Maybe just use low-sodium crackers instead... Just a thought.. I used the glaze that i found in another review(ketchup, honey. worch) and it was excellent.. I will making this again and next time I will double it so we have leftovers!

i followed this recipe to a t, except i used EXTRA lean ground beef, and mixed everything in my kitchen aid mixture which pretty much made the meal effortless... also added several dashes of Worcestershire and Tabasco to the mixture before padding it into the pan as well as thoroughly sifting the french onion soup mix into it. Oh, the steak sauce i used was Tamarind steak sauce from Jamaica... and the glaze on top as suggested by someone else was 3T KETCHUP 1T HONEY and 1t Worcestershire. i sprinkled fresh red pepper flakes over the whole thing. baked exactly one hour and i served it with Velveeta and bacon scalloped potatoes. the loaf had just enough spice to warm you up, but next time i am adding a layer of that glaze in the middle of the loaf, it really completed the dish!! thanks connie!

I thought this meatloaf was too dry. I used the complete 1 ounce package of dry onion soup mix, and I think this made the meatloaf slightly salty. If was were making this recipe again, I think I would add a small can of tomato sauce to the mixture.

OOOOhhhh, this was WONDERFUL!!!  I had previously tried a few other recipes, but this is it!  I'm stickin with this from now on.  I followed the recipe, except I used all the soup mix (didn't sift it out) and I add worstechire sauce and a little liquid smoke.  Couldn't find cheese flavored ritz, so used Cheez Its.  I also followed another reviewers comment and put sandwich bread under and around it to soak up the grease, worked AMAZINGLY!  Thank you sooooo much for sharing this recipe!

Got meatloafed out growing up but my husband loves it, so I had to find a new twist on it. This is the best meatloaf ever! I used Guoda cheese in it and a little for a topper. Unreal! Also used a tip from another review and used bread underneath to soak up grease! Outstanding

My family really liked this meatloaf recipe.  I've made two or three from this site and this one was their favorite.  Made a few changes based on what I had in the pantry.  I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and panko bread crumbs instead of crushed crackers.  I also added some italian seasoning and garlic.

I use this website all the time but have never joined. I did today just to write a review about this recipe. I made the Rempel Family meatloaf tonight for my family. I have 3 kids and have cooked meatloaf before and the kids wouldn't eat it. Tonight was  a completely different story. It was a huge hit! My husband even said it was the best meatloaf he has ever eaten. I highly recommend this recipe!

What a wonderful meatloaf! My family eats cheese like it is going out of style, so this was perfect! I did not have steak sauce, so I added BBQ sauce and Worchestershire sauce. Worked out wonderfully. The only problem I had was there wasn't enough! Next time I have to double the recipe! Thank you so much for sharing this one!

This was the best meatloaf we've ever had!  I used Better Cheddar crackers, sifted the onions out of the mix to make them less salty, and added the glaze of 3 T ketchup, 1 T honey, and 1/2 T worcestire.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever tasted/made.  I couldnt find the cheese flavored crackers, so I used the regular ones and it still turned out amazing!  My husband loved it, no leftovers!

Very good, quite diff than BBQ meatloaf/spinach and oats I am used to.  I felt it needed a little salt, but hubs & kids said it was fine.  We took advice of previous post & used bread to line the pan to soak up the grease....made like meatloaf saturated toast on the bottom, my husband said it made a great sandwich, lol just kidding!!! :)

Good recipe.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and only had 1 packet of onion soup mix (called for 2 since I scaled mine to 8 servings).  I enjoyed it.  I will have to try it with the beef to see if that is better.  My young children would't eat it but the rest of the family liked it.

Tried this recipe for the first time...easy recipe and very good flavor! Followed all ingredients exactly except I used 1 lb lean ground beef and 1 lb ground turkey. My family loved it and the leftovers were just as tastey the next day. Will make this again for sure!

If you don't want it to be so greasy AND a bit more healthy, use extra lean ground beef and 2% milk cheese. The greese will be cut in half before you even cook it! :) Delicious!

Excellent recipe!  I made it twice before posting my review and was extremely happy with the recipe both times. The second time, I doubled it for leftovers the following day. I stuck to the recipe exactly x2, shaped the loaf and placed it in the center of a 11x9 baking dish.  I placed slices of bread under to absorb any excess grease (as suggested by another reviewer) and it was just as good as the first time, just bigger!  The bread really does absorb well and is very easy to remove from the bottom of the loaf once it is done. Thank you for this excellent recipe!

Good basic meatloaf recipe. i used 1#beef and 1/2# venison. instead of using full amount of ketchup, i filled the measuring cup 1/2 full of ketchup and filled the rest with bbq sauce. i cooked this the day after i made it (my DH didn't want meatloaf that night) and as a result it was kind of mushy, so i think that was my fault more than the recipe's, since i didn't see anyone else had that problem. i used the glaze that someone else recommended: ketchup, honey and worcestershire. next time i would definitely use bbq sauce instead of the ketchup in the glaze.

This meatloaf is wonderful, I've never been much of a meatloaf fan and neither has my son and husband but I made a meatloaf and used this recipe and we all loved it.  The whole thing was eaten, that's very unusual for my family.  I sifted the soup mix like suggested and  just added a honey glaze to the top to finish it off...it is just great.

This meatloaf is a keeper! I threw out my old recipe and have replaced it with the Rempel's. I have made it with lean ground beef....excellent! Then another day I used ground turkey meat...also excellent! You can't go wrong with this recipe. Yummy!  :-))

This was very good.  I made exactly as written, and the only thing I would change is cutting back on the steak sauce, and that's only because I am not a fan of it and the flavor was pronounced in the meatloaf.  I think if I used only 1T it would be fine for my taste, but if you like that flavor then I'm sure the full amount would be fine for you.  It was very moist!  Will definitely make it again.

This is  delicious! Thank you Connie Rempel! I add a little mincced garlic crushed pepperconn and a shake of Mrs Dash table belnd and Panlo style bread crumbs to the mix. Instead of buttr crackers I use cruched Better Cheddar crakers. I like my loaf pan with Reynolds aluminu, foil the non stick kind. I bake ti for an hour and serve with a side of ketchep for dipping and Betty Crocker instant garlic mashed potatoes. I am VERY picky about meatloaf. THis is a winner and the go to one for me and my family!

My boyfriend and I love this meatloaf.  He says its the best he's ever had.  The only tweeks I made are adding a little extra cheese and saltines instead of the buttery round (its what we usually have on hand) and we add a topping of ketchup mixed with brown sugar.  Great recipe, thank you!

This recipe is a great change to the traditional meatloaf recipe. I used ground turkey in place of beef and substituted panko crispy bread crumbs by progresso for the crackers. I will use this recipe again and again.

Loved this meatloaf! This is the first meatloaf recipe I have actually liked. I love the fact that I didn't have to drench it in ketchup to get it down my throat... the taste was perfect. I did add just a little ketchup and worthshire sauce on the top the last 30 minutes it was in the oven. My husband loved this as well, and the leftovers were just as good :)

I didn't think this was very good.  I don't think I liked the steak sauce I used A1 and won't be trying it again but thinks for sharing.

The best meatloaf in the world!  The only change I do is instead of a package of dry onion soup mix, I use real onions and garlic (my husband has a reaction to MSG, which is in packaged soup mixes).  Also instead of steak sauce I use a jalapeño pepper hot sauce. Yummy!  My husband is always asking for more!

I made this for dinner tonight.  Thank you so much for sharing because this was the best meatloaf I've ever tasted!!!  I have saved it and definitely make again!!!  I didn't sift the dry onion soup mix as suggested and thought it tasted just fine.

My Goodness! I just made this for dinner this evening & did I get the complements! And from  one who does not like meat loaf, period. The only thing I changed was to use dry minced onion & some onion powder instead of the soup. Thank You for a great new recipe we'll be enjoying for a long time.

Good, but not as good as my basic meatloaf recipe. My family prefers a topping of ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar for a little sweetness!

Though I liked the flavor, I found this to be too greasy and too salty.  (I did put two pieces of bread to soak up extra grease.. maybe I will toast them next time! hah!)  I used 85/15 and regular mild Cheddar.  Next time I will buy 90/10 meat and low fat cheese.  I am also planning on low sodium/light salt crackers.. maybe no salt and fresh onion instead of the soup.  The last 15 minutes of cooking I topped this with a mixture of ketchup, steak sauce, brown sugar, and honey bbq sauce.  (I would have used honey - but I was out.) Like I said, I did like the flavor - I'm just going to play with it a bit more.  :)  Thanks for sharing.

This meatloaf is AWESOME! It's so simple. I re-calculate the recipe to accommodate 2lb of hamburger and use only two eggs instead of three.

Absolutely wonderful.  Thanks for the tip about sifting out the soup mix and just using the flakes; first batch was nice enough but you're right, it was a little salt-heavy.  Second batch with sifted out soup mix was just awesome.  Thanks guys!

My husband absolutely LOVES this meatloaf! He says it's the best he ever had! I never have been a meatloaf fan but this was pretty darn delicious. I cooked it a bit higher (380) so the top could brown a bit more and used BBQ sauce instead of the steak sauce. This is a keeper!

This was a tasty recipe.  I tested it out on my two teenage boys first, one of them had thirds, the other just had seconds  ;).  I think I will make again for the rest of the family (two teenage girls, 13 and 14, and two more boys 4 and 6) and my DH and see what they think. I added 1 1/2 tsp dijon mustard, and a dash of worcestershire sauce to the wet ingredients, and I glazed the meatloaf with 1/4c. Ketchup, 1tbl honey, 1 tsp dijon mustard, a pinch of pepper and dash of worcestershire....it was a great compliment to the flavor profile.

Connie - my family loves  your recipe! After fixing this recipe several times, I have started substituting 2 tablespoons of dried minced onions ( from the spice section at the grocery store ) instead of the onion soup mix.

We didn't care for this. There wasn't much of any flavor (meat and cheddar is what I could taste), and the meat was falling apart everywhere. Still looking for a good meatloaf!

I made this recipe into patties that I cooked on my stovetop. The flavor was good if you enjoy a dominate steak sauce taste. The patties did not hold together at all. I suspect that if I had baked it into a meatloaf, as directed, it would have been more solid! The addition of cheese to the mix was interesting.

This recipe turned out great! I'm glad I gave it a try even though I had to substitute a few items.   No onion soup and no steak sauce - instead I used (2) garlic cloves crushed & chopped, (2) tbs Worcestershire sauce and approx. 1 tsp Italian Spices.  For a throw together with what is on hand recipe it was surprisingly tasty.  Enjoy!

This is one of the best meatloaf dishes I have ever had. I never had a meatloaf with A1 steak sauce, and that is a great idea. I tried alot of different meatloafs and this is the only one I saved. I used cheesenips because I did not have regular crackers, but turned out fantastic.

I thought the whole package of onion soup mix was a little overwhelming but overall this was very good - my family LOVED it - with Diane's Colcannon from this site..

My husband really enjoyed this meatloaf and would have given it 5* - I took one star off because I felt the steak sauce flavor was too strong for my liking.  I made it as written, including sifting out the soup and adding only the onion flakes from the packaged soup.  Next time I will probably just make it with fresh onions though.  Great tip from a previous reviewer to put slices of bread underneath to soak up the grease - I will always do this for meatloaf from now on!

This was interesting. I'm not a fan of meatloaf, but I didn't mind this so much. My husband felt the same way. My 9 year old son loved it, except for the onion soup mix. He recommended making it again without it.

I split the meat 1/2 turkey, 1/2 beef and my husband was none the wiser.  Also, I used beefy onion soup mix, which may have helped cover the turkey taste :)

What a great recipe-thank you Connie! Based on other reviews, I used ground turkey (I never use beef), added minced some garlic and jalopeno for kick, and half an onion. I also added more of the ketchup glaze on top. Yum!!

This was my first attempt at making meatloaf, as I am not a big fan. I thought this recipe was pretty good. I used crushed Christie Cheese Bits (what I had), added some worchestershire and a few drops of tobacco, and used Tony Roma's original barbecue sauce (for the steak sauce). If I ever make meatloaf again, I would probably use this recipe.

Very tasty, nice change from average meatloaf and husband loved it!  I used entire package of onion soup mix (didn't sift out the powdery stuff as recipe provider suggested in her review).  I also used 2 lbs. ground beef and added a medium chopped up onion.  I also added a can of chopped mushrooms because they seemed like they would go with the other ingredients nicely - very good!  Other than that, I followed recipe as written.  Very delicious, my new meatloaf standby!

Very flavorful, moist meatloaf.  I substituted ground turkey for ground beef, and it still came out great.  Not dried out at all.  I highly recommend this for a quick, easy dinner.

Very flavorful! But turned out way too greasy-will do as others suggested and use bread to soak it up next time. Or use turkey burger instead.  A good, tasty meatloaf I will be making again.

I tried this meatloaf thinking it would be a lot like a good cheese burger and it was!  I loved it.  My wife enjoyed it but not as much as I.  My twins not at all.  They love cheese so I thought they would like it but Dad struck out.  The recipe didn't.  I'll make it again and just plan on something else for the kids.

okay , i don't want to offend anyone, but to give the recipe the review it deserves, i have to say , the first thing my husband said after he took the first bite was " thats good f'ing meatloaf!"  It was really good. The only change i made was i used bbq sauce since i was out of steak sauce. i will be keeping this recipe around for a long time. thank you again for such a great recipe!

This is the best meatloaf recipe I have tried, yet.  I didn't add quite as much onion soup mix as called for, and I added an orange pepper and about 1/2 a grilled onion, as well.  It was great  - this recipe is a keeper!

This was my first meatloaf ever made, and it turned out pretty good.  I only used about half the cheese and used buttery garlic club crackers.  I only had one pound of meat, so I just sort of estimated with the ingredients.  I also added a few spices---worcest. sauce, garlic, slap yo mamma seasoning for a little spice bite, and chives.  I took it out of the oven and made a glaze of ketchup, A-1, and worcest. sauce for the top and put it in for another 15 minutes.

I am not a big fan of meatloaf but this is probably the best I've ever had.  I put a fork full in my mouth and said "wow, this is really good!" - which was a surprise since it was just meatloaf :)    This will be the recipe we use from now on.    BTW, I used whatever crackers I had on hand and they worked just fine.

I thought I'd try something different than my usual meatloaf recipe.  I was very pleased with the texture of this, as it was tender and moist but not at all mushy, which I was a little concerned with given that it had both crushed crackers and ketchup.  I've found in the past that meatloaf with too much ketchup has turned the meat a bit mushy, which is probably from the vinegar breaking down the meat?  Anyway, it was very tasty and the whole family enjoyed it.  I would've given it five stars, but I felt like it was missing something.

This is definitely a keeper, as suggested, i used townhouse flipsides cheddar flavored pretzel crackers as it was the only cheese crackers that i had in my pantry, sifted the dry onion soup mix and added about 1/4 cup of milk 1/8 tsp of pepper and 1 to 2 Tablespoons of yellow onion. SUPERB!!  Like a lot of people, i DO NOT really care for meatloaf, but my daughter loves it, so i made this for her, but i think i ate more then she did. Smothered in gravy with a baked potato and broccoli/cauliflower and cheese, you can't go wrong with this recipe!!!

This recipe was super moist and had a great flavor. I did not have hamburger so I used ground elk meat and I added ketchup to the top for the last 10 mins of baking. I also had to turn my oven up to 400 degrees for the an extra 10 mins to get it to the 160 degrees. There were no left overs !!! I will definately make again.

Really delicious, flavorful and moist (but still held together when slicing).  I can cook many things, but have always had a hard time with meatloaf.  Finally!  I bought 3 more pounds of meat to make some extras and put in the freezer.  This is going into the normal meal rotation.  Thank you!!!

Good Stuff!  Tried it with Bold and Spicy A1 and it was not as good as the regular A1 so I'd stick to that :)

This meatloaf was amongst the best I have ever tasted.  I also put the honey, ketchup and soy sauce (substitute for the Worcestershire) on for the last 30 minutes of baking.  My husband took the leftovers to work and ended up having to share because it smelled so delicious.  I will certainly use this recipe again.

This is a fairly good recipe for meatloaf but nothing special - I've made several meatloaves that were better.  I don't really understand all the rave reviews of this one.  It was average.

Pretty good, but. I used Lipton Onion soup and the onions were crunchy and a bit too oniony. Might be best to put onion mix in egg/kethup/steak sause mixture and rehydrate for 30 minutes prior to mixture to meat. If you don't like heavy onion, reduce onion mix a bit.

This meatloaf was one of the best I've had in a while! I made the recipe exactly as it is written and it all turned out great! We had it for dinner, and there was just enough for meatloaf sandwiches for lunch the next day! Yum, yum!

Savory and moist - not your boring meatloaf!  (DO NOT SIFT OUT THE SOUP MIX - IT IS NOT TOO SALTY:)  How can you go wrong with cheese, ritz crackers and onion soup mix.  I made 8 of these for a grad dinner and everyone loved it.  Make mac n cheese and you got yourself a comfort dinner that can't be beat!  Only suggestion is the steak sauce is a little overpowering so just replaced with more ketchup.

Awesome! I made this for the first time last year for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! It has been the only recipe I use for meatloaf ever since. I use sharp cheddar cheese, Lipton's Beefy Onion soup and one of the sweeter varieties of A-1 steak sauce where the recipe calls for them - just suggestions!

This was pretty good. I didn't care for the onion soup mix,but that's just personal preference. I'd much rather chop an onion and maybe a green pepper instead. Overall, a good meatloaf.

We just had this delicious meatloaf for dinner and it was a hit both with the adults and with my teenaged son.  I followed the recipe as written, only adding about 1/4 cup of milk to soften it up.  Thanks for sharing, Connie!

I am eating this as I type! Perfet on a cool fall evening - sliced on a baguette with fresh green beans on the side. Followed the recipe as is except for substituted one T Worc. sauce instead of A1. I did not find this to be too salty whatsoever. Highly recommend - this will be one of our regular recipes this winter! Thanks:)

I made these for my family for dinner tonight.  Both of my kids and my husband liked it.  It turned out moist.  But be sure you like the A-1 steak sauce if you are making it because you taste it a lot more than anything else.  Next time, I will cut down on the amount of A-1 so I can taste the other stuff more.

Found this last year and have been making it faithfully since.  This is by far the best meatloaf me and my family have ever tasted.  My picky kids and my meatloaf loathing husband all love it!  I do nothing different except throw in a few extra crackers.  Otherwise, it falls apart. Cut up the leftovers and add to a jar of spaghetti sauce for a DELICIOUS meat sauce!  Tomorrow night's dinner!

This was a pretty ordinary meatloaf.  Next time I will try it using cheddar crackers and see if it livens things up a bit.  Taste o.k., but nothing to get excited about.

Amen and pass the potatoes.  I used normal buttery ritz, not cheezy and I did not sift out the onion soup mix, just used it as is and I did not think this was too salty.  I topped it with ketchup while cooking and it was great!

I used Cheeze Its and it worked just fine.  I think I'll double the topping next time (2 tbsp ketchup, 1 tbsp honey & 1/2 tsp worshesire)and cook the other half on the stove and serve it on the side because my boyfriend wanted more ketchup and he put cold ketchup on the top - ick~

Excellent flavor and very moist. Can be a bit crumbly. Maybe more crackers to hold it together better.

This was my 1st time ever making a meatloaf (my fam is not much of a meatloaf fan) & it was wonderful!!!  It couldn’t be more moist & flavorful!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added about ¼ cup more cheese.  Next time I think I will add a bit more crackers as well.  FABULOUS!!!

The idea of meatloaf has never really appealed to me, and since neither my partner or I had it growing up, it never even occurred to us to try it! I came across this recipe and with all the rave reviews, decided to give it a try. Wow. It was really tasty and moist and my partner (who had low expectations and almost ALWAYS limits himself to one serving at meal times) even had a second serving and polished off the rest for lunch the next day. This recipe is definitely a keeper - Thank you!

Another 5 star review for this recipe! Used regular Ritz crackers, on hand, and maybe a little extra cheese (LOVE IT).  I did sift out the flakes from onion soup cause DH HATES too salty food.  This was fine.. Spread a little ketchup on top before baking. Really good meatloaf.

Yummo!  This is easily the best meatloaf recipe I've ever made!  I didn't have cheese crackers, but used another type, and I didn't have onion soup mix, but used onions and onion powder.  I also put a glaze of ketchup, honey, and worcestershire sauce.  It was delicious and my dear hubby loved it also!!!  Will definitely make this again!

THe texture is nice--the meat is not chewy.  I think what made it this way was the added cheese and crackers.  BTW you can't really taste the cheese.  My meatloaf turned out kind of crumbly.

I am not a big meatloaf fan, but I really liked this meatloaf.  I read Connie's additional comments on her recipe before I made it and decided to adjust her recipe slightly.  She said to use cheese flavored butter crackers, but I have never heard of such a thing, so I stuck with regular.  She also suggested using only the flakes out of the onion soup mix, but that would just be dried onions.  She thought it was too salty with the whole packet.  I used half the packet and thought it could stand some more.  I love the cheese in this meatloaf.  One more thing, I never have steak sauce, so I substituted worchestershire sauce.  It worked out nicely.  A very good meatloaf, and I would make it again.

This was excellent!  I didn't exactly measure anything out.  I just threw it all together and 'eyeballed' what I felt looked like a decent amount.  Instead of the onion soup mix I added french onion dip mix.  It's all in the seasoning... right?  :).  I squished it into the pan and topped it with BBQ sauce and fresh mozzarella balls.  Yum!

This was by far a very tasty recipe although just a little bit salty. I did not make any adjustments other than homemade BBQ sauce for a topping. It definitely was delicious! It was also a hit with my husband ant it was only the first time he has ever had meatloaf.

Great meatloaf recipe.  Fits perfectly into a loaf pan and really stays together.  So many meatloafs fall apart while baking or when cutting. Bravo!

YUM! YUM! YUM! This recipe is a keeper. Made to a "T" and added the suggested glaze of 3T ketchup, 1T honey and 1/2t worchestershire.  Baked in 6 mini loaves and served with mashed potatoes. We loved it. Thanks!

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I did a Easter theme meatloaf, and really really got the jaws dropping with my kids. I guess they not only enjoyed the meatloaf shaped as an Easter Egg, but loved that it was really good, tender, not dry. This gets my 5 star all the way.

This meatloaf was just ok for us - nothing special. I used the cheese crackers as recommended by the recipe writer. We thought the cheese crackers gave the meatloaf an odd taste once cooked.  Thought I would try this for something different, but, I will stick with my regular meatloaf recipe.

Awesome! I used dried onion instead of the onion mix but otherwise followed the recipe exactly! My husband who really, really doesn't like meatloaf had seconds and all three kids loved it. Less than a week and it's already been requested again!

Very easy recipe to make and the taste is so good. I made my own little changes after reading past reviews. Instead of buttery round crackers I used Cheez-it square crackers. I also used an onion and garlic packet intended for potatoes. I did not use all of the mix just about 3/4 of it. That is all the substitutions I made when it came to the ingredients. As for the preparation no difference followed it through, the egg mixture with steak sauce and ketchup is simple and a good marinade for the ground beef. I took my loaf pan and lined it with 3 slices of bread (any kind will do), this will help soak up the excess fat drippings unless your gonna use it for gravy then I would not use bread on the bottom. Other than that the cook time and temperature made it just right. Cool the loaf after taking out of oven for about 10 minutes that way all the moisture stays in. I highly recommend this recipe, will make again for my family.

I was trying to find a different meatloaf recipe, this one was ok but I thought was missing something.  I think a glaze would have helped it.  I did like the cheese, which I have never put in meatloaf before.  I did use 93/7 ground beef and there was no fat.  My boyfriend said he liked it, but if I make it again I will add chopped onion and something else.

I chose this recipe as my first meatloaf ever, and it turned out surprisingly well (even for my amateur cooking skills).  I'm impressed.  I used a spicy BBQ sauce instead of steak sauce, since that's all we had, and it seemed to work just as well.  I will definitely make this again!

This is good meatloaf - I followed the suggestion made of just using the onion flakes and not all the seasonings from the soup packet (I did use a little of the seasonings) and using the cheese crackers.  I could not find 'cheese ritz' crackers as suggested, but I did use 'Cheez-its' - and I used 1 cup instead of a 1/2 cup.  I WILL use some sort of topping next time I make it.  It was excellent with A-1 steak sauce :)

I was very surprised that this meatloaf tasted so horrible, since the rating was so high. The only thing I didn't add was the cheese, which I think would have made this meatloaf worse. The steak sauce flavor was too strong, I used A1 cracked pepper. I was looking for something different than my own recipe, but I think I'll stick with it. I would not recommend this recipe, Sorry. Also, I just noticed “tips” from the author of this recipe, unfortunately, as I am sure most did not see the alterations to the recipe.

Ok, so I loved this recipe.  My husband got the final vote and gave it 4 stars.  I found it very moist and flavorful. Used the glaze as suggested on the site (ketchup, honey, worstes). It was a bit salty.  Oh well, he gets final vote.

I scaled to 10 servings but still tweaked it. I used 3lbs grbeef. Crushed about 20 crackers. Used 2 fistfuls of my hubbys hands for cheese (Half monterrey/half cheddar). 1 pk onion soup mix, 4 eggs, 2 tblspns A1 steak sauce. I did layer the bottom of my casserole pan(no bread pan) with about 5 pieces of bread like another user had recommended. For the glaze i used the ketchup and A1 sauce! Magnificent! Everyone loved it! I plan on putting this in the spin!

We made this meatloaf for a 50's party on 2.21.09...120 guests...we received rave reviews.  Followed the recipe exactly except added a glaze of ketchup. Moist, nice flavor.  This will be my go to meatloaf from now on...for my family might spice it up with some salsa:)  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!!

I scaled this so I could use 2 lbs. of ground beef.  I added extra crackers (one sleeve of Ritz crackers - about 1/4 lb.) and used 3 eggs.  It didn't set up as firm as I had hoped.  I used the glaze another reviewer suggested (3 T. ketchup, 1 T. honey and 1/2 t. Worcestershire sauce) and it was great.  I used mild cheddar but next time I might try some mozzarella, too.  It was pretty good for basic meatloaf but it almost seemed like it was missing something to give it a little "zing."

Excellent - kids loved it. Picky 6 year asked for unprecented "seconds". Made w/ plain bread crumbs as did not have the butter crackers and used 1/2 the soup mix. Came perfect. Thanks for the great recipe.

I am a meatloaf lover and this recipe is awesome!!  Such great flavor.  I ate sooo much my I had to lay on the couch for about an hour and a half afterward.  Even my wife...who is the main cook in the house, commented how good it was.  Nice job Connie!  I will revisit this recipe many times in the future.

This was the ultimate.  I have always had problems with the end product falling apart...not this one.  It was delicious, dense, and filled with flavor.  I opted to also add jalapenos for a little heat with the cheddar, then make a quick ketchup/ brown sugar glaze for the top.  Thanks so much to the reviewer who suggested using two disposable pans, punching holes in the top one (separating the two pans with crunched up tin foil) to allow the grease to drain.  It was an absolutely great solution to a really common problem.

This is the third or fourth time I've used this recipe.  It's really versatile and oh so delicious!    As other reviewers I also used half beef/half pork, half ketchup/half bbq sauce (hubby hates ketchup) and I added quite a bit of tabasco this time (I'm pregnant and craving the spice lately).

Hubby and I love this meatloaf and I will be making it for years to come.

My family loved this recipe!  It's the only meatloaf I will make from now on.  I always use the topping someone else suggested (3tsp Ketchup, 1tsp honey, 1/2tsp Worcestershire).  We like it better using the thicker style of shredded cheese instead of the style you would use on say, tacos.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was quick, easy, and delicious. My husband doesn't like meatloaf but I was in the mood for it and decided he was just going to have to eat what I cooked :). He said this was the best he had ever had and ate two large slabs of it :). I will definitely make this again!!! I didn't change a thing...used A1 for my steak sauce. It was delicious :)

Made this for about the fourth time.  It is wonderful.  This time remembered to grind up the onion soup mix so my picky daughter wouldn't see the bits of onion. Made exactly as written.  Used Heinz 57 steak sauce because my husband does like A-1.  Excellent.  The whole family likes it.  I freeze the leftovers with some mashed potatoes for really good lunches for my husband to take to work.

Excellent meatloaf! I used 1/2 buttery round crackers and 1/2 cheddar crackers. I also topped the meatloaf with a ketchup/bbq sauce/worsteshire sauce combo. Thought the smokey bbq sauce went well with the cheddar in the meatloaf. Very moist, even after sitting in a warm oven for a couple of hours (unexpected doctor visit before dinner!). Thanks Rempels!

My boyfriend really liked the recipe... me not so much...  What I did like was the idea of cooking a meatloaf more like a cake- this did a beautiful job of cooking the meat perfectly (and it forced the juices to stay in the meat).  Did not like the A1 (the steak sauce I used)... the taste overwhelmed the loaf. Next time I'd cut it down to less than 1/2 of what the recipe asks for.

Terrific - Easy - Tasty.  I would not change a thing.  It is a little greasy but not so much that I would start to alter the ingredients.  Once cooked, take out of loaf pan and place on a plate and this solves a grease issue.

This has definitely entered in my Fall-Spring dinner rotation.

My kid's loved it.  I couldn't quite give it 5, because even though I used 96% lean beef, I still had lots of grease (maybe I'll use a good quality cheese next time).  It was very rich as well, but I'll definitely make again.

I've been on a mission to find the best meatloaf recipe since I invested in a meatloaf pan from Williams Sonoma.

This one wins.  I made exactly as directed and it was excellent.

I thought this was a great meatloaf recipe. Next time I might use a leaner ground beef to cut some of the grease. I put bread underneath the mixture (as suggested by another user) to help absorb grease and that turned out to be helpful. Overall, very yummy! Will definitely make again :)

Awesome!! By far the best meatloaf I have ever made.  My family could not get enough. Instead of BBQ sauce I put in some chili sauce and drizzled Frank's Redhot on top before baking, just add some zip.

I made this last night for me and my husband and we LOVED it! It was so delicious and is now my new standard meatloaf recipe. I am reccomending it to my friends and family. In the few negative reviews people mentioned it being too greasy and too salty...we did not notice this. I baked the meatloaf on a cookie sheet so any grease that drained out from the cheese did not affect the meatloaf, but I imagine baking it on bread, as some suggested, would help if this was a bother. And we definitely didn't think it was too salty. It was perfect in our opinion. I also added a glaze of ketchup, worcestershire sauce and honey and measured by taste. It was out of this world, so moist and tasty. I highly reccomend. Thank you!

Recently my dad and I have tried creating many new foods from new recipes and I happened to find this recipe. Well, I tried it and we loved it! My grandma who lives in a nursing home had some too and she thought she was in heaven. The next time I made this meatloaf I added larger chunks of cheese to be a little more cheesy, the other kind wasn't really noticeble, as well as another tablespoon of steak sauce. It turned out to be PERFECT!! So kudos to this recipe and 5 stars for a great creation!

I did a few modifications because I didn't have all the ingredients.   I used ground venison, a can of french onion soup, and bread crumbs instead of crackers.  I also put sliced bacon on the bottom and this is the best meatloaf I have made so far!

Fantastic! My only complaint is that it is a little greasy, but this is solved by draining off some of the grease.

This is the best meatloaf.  I used a 1.3-pound package of lean ground turkey and 1 pound of extra-lean ground beef.  I also used 2 packages of the onion soup mix.  This makes yummy meatloaf sandwiches with the leftovers.  Highly recommend this one!

I finally found my 'go to' meatloaf recipe.  I've tried many different ones and my husband and I declared this one is the best by far.  Definitely a keeper!  I made it as is, but only used 1lb of beef because that's what I had.  Still turned out perfect, mmmm!

I usually make a meatloaf like this when I want to use the tailend of an almost empty bag of crackers. I've done it with 
Goldfish, Ritz, and almost every flavor of Cheese-It's you can think of. Really great for when you want to clean out your cupboards!

This never fails to disappear off my table. I usually will add either spinach or matchstick carrots or sometimes both, depends on what I have on hand.

family favorite! I replaced the crackers for crushed up garic cheese croutons. topped with a glaze made of ketchup, worshire, sugar, dash of vinegar and mustard. Baked till the edges were crispy. So flavorful and moist!

Every one took a second serving (especially the kids!)
I used Westchester sauce instead of steak sauce (only 1 tbsp)
Thank you!

Although my fam said they liked the same old meatloaf that I usually make, we did enjoy this very much.  Very moist and flavorful.  I did use bread crumbs instead of the crackers, next time I will try the crackers and see if it makes a difference in the end.  Thanks for your family recipe!

Very good but (in my opinion) I don't think it will replace Eileen's Meatloaf. Served with mashed potatoes and homemade brown gravy. Tasted even better the next day with ketchup or the homemade brown gravy on top!!!

Very easy recipe and my husband loved it.  I did cook it over bread slices that soaked up the grease and I also used the glaze suggested by Kinz.  It was very good.  I didn't have anything but those Kraft Mac-n-Cheese crackers that recently showed up on store shelves, so I used those instead of Ritz. I also didn't have steak sauce on hand, so I had to skip that ingredient. As suggested by the author I sifted out most of the powder from the onion soup mix and just used the onion bits.  Will certainly make this one again.

Thanks for sharing your family recipe! I really enjoyed it. I think the steak sauce adds a great unique flavor. I'm not a big meat eater, but this was a really great dinner! I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfectly. Thanks again!

Fabulous!! 
I made it as stated, only change was I had to use 4 dashes o worchestshire sauce as I had no steak sauce. I also used the whole package of onion soup mix..and used the cheese flavoured crackers. Delish. Family said it was the best meatloaf they ever had. 
I served it with mashed potatoes, green beans & gravy.

This is an easy and simple recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and used A1 sauce for the steak sauce. I also took Connie's advice and used cheese Ritz. The meatloaf turned out well.  The recipe is great as it is, but I might add more cracker crumbs next time to give it more of a meatloaf texture rather than burger texture.

Fantastic meatloaf (and I'm not even a meatload fan!!!)  My husband said it's better than his mom's! :)  Insead of using crachers, I used 1 cup Garlic and Herb bread crumbs. Other than that, I kept the recipe the same. I will make this meatloaf again! Thanks!

I've tried a number of meatload recipes and this was very good. I used crushed cheese crackers, the bread under it to soak up excess grease (used the low fat ground beef) and the honey, ketchup, worcestershire mixture on top. Also sifted the soup mix to use very little of the power and kept the onions. The biggest test is huggy loved it too.   This now replaces my other meatloaf recipes.Thank you!

Wonderful meatloaf! This was my first time ever making meatloaf and my husband gave it "two thumbs up". I eye-balled most of the ingredients, except the eggs and the ketchup (I measured them), and we didn't have steak sauce at all. And the meatloaf was still great. I didn't use a whole packet of onion soup mix, and I'm not sure if that's the reason it wasn't salty. I even had to add salt after it was cooked. I also used crumbled plain crouton, and oh yeah, for the cheese I used shredded mozzarella and a taco cheese blend. Wonderful!

This meatloaf was very rich and flavorful...almost too much so.  It was also a little goopy.  The pieces did not stay together when sliced.  They just fell apart. If I make it again, I would add extra meat, keeping the other ingredients the same.

This was really yummy and different from the meatloaf I am use to.  I will make this again.  I didnt have any steak sauce so I just used a little extra ketchup.

I have been using the base recipe of the Lipton Onion Soup Mix box for years, but with some varioations I've picked up. This one is just right. The butter round crackers is the perfect addition. Sometimes I use 1 lb sausage and 1 lb hamburger to spice it up a little more. I love the suggestion of adding bread on the bottom to soak up the grease.

I made it as a 'helping hands' dinner for friends and was so pleased with this meatloaf.  This had so much taste; not your standard, boring meatloaf.

Wow! This is sooooo good! I never liked meatloaf before trying this recipe, but now I think it will become a regular dinner staple. My husband also loved it! The cheese and the steak sauce make all the difference. I made a few tweaks myself: I used crushed Cheez-its crackers instead of Ritz type crackers, and I used a cup of cheese instead of 3/4 cup. I used about 1 1/2 tbsp. onion flakes and 1/2 tsp. of sage, and basil instead of the dry onion soup mix since I didn't have any, also a few grinds of salt and pepper. The glaze suggested by Kinz really made this meatloaf outstanding too, I highly recommend it. I doubled the worcestershire, and cut the honey in half though since my husband doesn't like anything sweet with meat, and it wasn't sweet at all. This recipe is a keeper for sure! Thank you for sharing it! -Louise

I had tried to prepare a meatloaf only once in my life before I found this recipe. I tried it and my husband about died! He said it's better than his mom's, which is a great compliment to me! She's a wonderful cook! Thanks for the great recipe. I'll be using this one for years to come!

Healthier version of this awesome meatloaf turned out great! I used 1 pound of 99% fat free ground turkey in place of the 1 1/2 pound ground beef. In place of the steaksauce I used worchestershire sauce, I added a few dashes of Dave's hotsauce. I also strained the onions out of the soup mix and only used them like suggested by a Rempel family member in a previous review. Oh and I used a mixture of shredded cheese I had on hand. Thanks for the great reciped!!

According to my husband, this is better than what Cracker Barrel serves and he likes theirs.  

I only had whole wheat Ritz crackers so that's what I used and I also used egg beaters rather than whole eggs.  There was too much liquid mixture so I'd probably scale back on that.  Also, I scaled the recipe to 8 servings as I had 2 lbs of beef to use and it took about 1 hour and 15 minutes for it to cook all the way through.  Next time I'll try oatmeal in place of the crackers ås that's what my husband likes and suggested.

Was very good...but I will tweak the recipe and follow the other reviews warnings, next time. Was terribly to salty. Must cut back on the onion soup mix. Also definitely needs to be put on bread or on a rack in the pan...is very greasy! I did put the glaze on top...gave it a great flavor! Will make again with the changes.

It was okay.  I do like using the ritz crakers instead of just breadcrumbs but I wasn't crazy about the cheese in the meat and for my family the dry onion soup mix made it too salty.  We love meatloaf but this one just wasn't our fav.

This was very average tasting for us, nothing special. I did change it though and maybe it was my fault, but I cooked it in a muffin pan to make little "muffin" style meatloaves for my children to eat. They just didn't taste very good unfortunately. BTW I did put the glaze on them also and they took almost as long as called for to cook them!

This was the first time I ever attempted meatloaf and it was the best meatloaf I have ever eaten! I never really liked meatloaf, but was so sick of eating the same things that I thought I would give it a try. My boyfriend loved it too and he scoffs at meatloaf.

This recipe is great!  Not only is it easy, but it's very, very tasty.  I'm sure it can be modified in various ways, but I made it just as directed.  

Note:  I used a lot of generic/off-brand ingredients, and it turned out fine (e.g., onion soup mix, crackers).

Another thing I liked:  the meatloaf was ready before the rest of the meal (mashed potatoes & green beans), so I kept in in the oven, covered and on a low temperature -- and it did not dry out.

You gonna like it!

This tasted fine but it wasn't the best meatloaf I have made. I found it a bit greasy but it may have been because I used a meatloaf mix and the pork would add grease.  I did cook it on the bread but the grease floated to the top of the meatloaf.

Made this last week for a small get together and everyone RAVED and wanted the recipe.  The only thing I did different was the glaze.  Believe it or not I used ketchup, mustard and tobasco sauce.  It turned out GREAT.  Thanks for staple recipe!!!!

Very flavorful and easy to prepare.  My family really enjoyed it.  When I realized I had no crackers to make it on one occasion, I substituted them for baked potato chips... came out just as good.

I have very picky kids - and this recipe is now on the regular rotation despite them having hated meatloaf their whole lives!  I usually make it as is.  Sometimes will change up by using ground turkey instead.  Have used a packet of Ramen seasoning when out of Dry Onion Soup.  Have used cheez-its if out of Ritz, too.  Best tip: put two slices of bread at bottom of pan before filling with meatloaf, and they will absorbe ALL the grease! Super excellent recipe!

I have been making this recipe for about two yrs. but am just now rating it.
Awesome! I have tweaked it a bit though.
I use Lipton savory herb soup mix, but not the entire package as it can be salty if you use the whole thing and I use Jack Daniels spicy BBQ sauce instead of Ketchsup.  I've used it with Turkey also.
Folks alway enjoy and ask for the recipe.
Thanks Connie!

Fabulous! I didn't have time to measure anything out so I just eye-balled it.  I  mixed all ingredients together, except the meat and eggs.  I then added the meat and then mixed in the beaten eggs last. I also added about 1/3 c. of Romano that I had on hand and wanted to get rid of.  My shredded cheese was a mixture of Colby/Monterey jack. I topped the meatloaf with a glaze that another review suggested (3 t. ketchup, 1 t. honey and 1/2 t. Worcestershire). Turned out perfect.  Served w/ mashed potatoes and veggies. 
Edited:  Made this several times. I now add 2 slices of bread to the bottom to soak up the grease and wanted to note that this fits perfectly in a Calphalon 9" loaf pan.

I made this last night and the recipe was great...I did make some changes...instead of the onion soup mix I used McCormick meat loaf seasoning...I added green pepper and onions but I didnt use cheese b/c I thought that wouldnt have tasted good with the pepper/onions...I used Ritz crackers and it came out great...I will make again.

This recipe is fab! So flavorful and moist! It is quite greasy, so I'd reccomend putting the sandwich bread in the bottom to help soak up the grease as another member suggested.
Also, I made a glaze for the top with about a quarter cup of Diana BBQ sauce, 2 tbsps of honey and a tbsp of Worcestershire sauce. Deeeee-lish!

This was the most delicious meatloaf I've ever had. I added more steak sauce for extra flavor and it was perfect. The fiance raved the entire time he was eating.

This was terrific! Based on the reviews, I did the following: I sifted out and used only the onions from the dry onion soup mix. I used worchestershire sauce as my steak sauce. I didn't have any "buttery" or cheesy crackers, so I used a mixture of crushed goldfish crackers and wheat crackers. I put a glaze of 3 T ketchup, 1 T honey, and 2 t worchestershire sauce on top. I also put a few slices of bread in the bottom to absorb some grease. It was extremely moist and flavorful. I plan to add this to my regular rotation!

We have probably made this 5+ times.  Make sure to put some bread on the bottom of the muffin pan to soak up some of the grease.  This is a keeper!

The most delicious meatloaf I've ever had.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and made slight changes to the amount of ingredient since I only had 1.25 pounds of meat.  The only change I would possibly make is to add some fresh onion.  DELICOUS!!!

Flavor was ok but in my opinion this recipe made a tough meatloaf and it also was very greasy from the cheddar cheese used.

I made this delicious meatloaf for dinner tonight,and i LOVE it! I am a bonafide meatloaf hater since they all seem to taste and smell the same.
Since hubby is always whining for meatloaf,i decided to give this recipe a chance.It rocks!
The taste is fantastic! Only changes i made were to add 2 cloves of roasted minced garlic and sweet red bell pepper.
This is a keeper!

Very good!  My husband doesn't like change, and loves my meatloaf - or rather my mother's recipe -  so this is the first new meatloaf recipe I've used in 13 years.  It was basic enough that he didn't give me the old "Did you do something different?" yet I was able to enjoy a subtly different flavored meatloaf.  I did have to omit the cheese (...this time...) because I have to ease him into drastic, life-altering changes like adding cheese to meatloaf.  :-) Steak sauce added a nice taste, and I used Townhouse crackers.  Thought the soup mix might make it too salty, but it did not.  Very flavorful!  Will try it again.

Meatloaf is one of those dishes I make every now and then to use up ground beef, but my family doesn't really love it -- until now!  This recipe was a big hit.  The only changes I made were to substitute Worcestershire sauce for the steak sauce and add a coating of ketchup on top before baking.

I wanted to try a meatloaf recipe with ground turkey.  I tried this recipe and I have to say that I will NEVER make a beef meatloaf again.  This was excellent.  My husband is sooooo picky, and HE loves it, too.  This is going into our dinner rotation.

I have been trying to find a meatloaf recipe to beat my husband's mother's recipe ;)  He said this is the one!  I used "beefy onion soup mix" and topped the meatloaf with more cheddar cheese for the last 10 min of baking time.  He loved it!

This was AWESOME!!!  I didn't change a thing, although I only had 1 egg instead of 2, but it still was a big hit.  My 3 yr old who is the hardest to get to eat, even asked for a second helping.  This one is now my meatloaf recipe for life!!

I never take the time to rate recipes but I had to on this one. I have a picky 4 year old who tries to live off of mac n cheese, crackers, bread, etc...well, I tried this recipe and he wanted seconds! Yay! I've found a way to get protein in him! Thanks for this one. I didn't have any steak sauce on hand, I used the mini cheese crackers, added a squirt of bbq sauce, and pepper to taste. Very good...will make again.

This turned out wonderful!  I didn't have cheddar cheese so I used mozarella and I didn't have Ritz crackers so I used Cheese-Its Reduced Fat crackers and it was still great.  I also used egg whites instead of the whole egg and I added some hot sauce.  Both my husband and I liked it and best of all no leftovers!

good but not as good as I expected, although it may have been my fault.  I followed the revised directions, I sifted the soup and I added hot sauce.  I couldn't find cheese ritz so I just used wheat crackers instead.  I just thought it lacked pizazz.  I did end up making a ketchup, steak sauce, and hot sauce topping that made it better the 2nd time around.  Also I cooked it about 10 degrees too much so I will have to try it again at the correct temp.

This was a good meatloaf recipe, but nothing special.  After reading some of the reviews like "best ever" and "my husband doesn't like meatloaf but he loves this!" I was disappointed in it.

I and my family really liked this take on meatloaf.  The steak sauce was a delightful twist.  I was unfortunately out of onion soup mix so I substituted with ranch dressing mix, delish.

My parents were visiting and I cooked my booty off the entire two weeks.  This is the one recipe my Mom absolutely HAD to have.  Even reminded me at the airport to mail it to her.  It was really good.  I used 1 tbspn Heinz 57 and 1 tbspn A1.  I also used bread crumbs instead of butter crackers.  Loved it!

I made a few alterations based on other  reviews. I used dried minced onion instead of the soup mix to cut back sodium. I also used cornflake crumbs instead of crackers because that is what i had. I used 2 lbs of meet as well and a slight splash of milk because I don't like bone dry meatloaf. Tomato paste instead of ketchup for less sugar, and finely grated cheese melts internally better.

This was a really good meatloaf recipe - it reminded me of my mom's meatloaf when I was a kid. I added BBQ sauce instead of ketchup for a more smokey flavor.

Moist, yummy meatloaf.  The glaze really added a nice touch - as recommended, 3 tbsp ketchup, 1 tbsp honey and 1/2 tbsp worchestershire sauce.  Only other changes were 2/3 pkg onion soup mix, worchestershire sauce instead of steak sauce and seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers.

I followed this recipe with the exception of the onion soup because I did not have any on hand. I used fresh chopped onion and green pepper in its place. I also added extra cheese. With the changes, the dish was delicious, and I will make this again. Thanks for a great recipe.

My hubby is a super fan of this meatloaf.  I tried the brown sugar meat loaf that was highly rated on this site and he didn't like it half as much.  Next time, I will us cheddar Ritz crackers as suggested in comments.  Can't go wrong with more cheese. :)

This was very good! I made this tonight for my hubby and my friend and they both loved it! I used worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce and added the full packet of onion mix. It came out very flavorful! It was a tad on the dry side the first time I made it, so the next time I cooked it until it reached 150 degrees (about 40 minutes) and it was way better! Very moist and full of flavor! I highly recommend this one!

This is the best meatloaf i and my family have ever tasted!  In fact, it's the only dish I have made ever that my family requests again  - more to do with my cooking than the recipes I've tried! :)  I make this exactly as is - it's perfect!

This was a huge hit.Everyone was asking for more after it was all gone.The only thing I'd do differently is next time pick out the onion pieces from the onion soup mix.

I followed the original recipe exactly.  I have always HATED meatloaf...until tonight.  It wasn't too salty, it had great flavor, wasn't dry and the mixed in cheese was fabulous.  It wasn't greasy either, surprisingly.  No renditions needed, perfect the way it is.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Finally!  I have wanted to LOVE meatloaf and this one has made a believer out of me!  I followed the recipe as directed, except that I used Fiesta Ranch Dip mix instead of onion soup mix, and it was SO tasty and SO moist (maybe a little too moist to look pretty, as it crumbled a bit when removed from the pan.)  We like rach dressings and dips, so this was a good substitution, thanks to the reviewer who mentioned it before!  Now we can eat meatloaf at my house on a regular basis, my whole family liked it!

OMG this is superb the best meatloaf i've had! It's very moist and tasty. I ommit the onion soup b/c i don't have any. I added garlic powder and italian seasoning on the meat mixture. I love the other reviewers tip to put bread at the bottom of the pan to absorb oil, very nifty! I sure love this and i pack a slice to my hubby's lunch bag hoping he'll ask for more tomorrow. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

What a great meatloaf! It was very moist & flavorful. I used a 1-1/4 lb. package of meatloaf mix (2/3 beef & 1/3 pork)from Safeway. I added all the other ingredients per the recipe except the onion soup. I was worried about the saltiness per the other reviews, so I left out a little of the powdered portion of the soup mix. It was perfect. I thought the cheese mixed throughout was really good but didn't overpower it with a "cheesy" taste. Thanks Rempel Family!

I doubled the cheezit amount to 1 cup and only used a half package of dry onion soup mix...I also doubled the amount of cheese and the meatloaf stayed very moist.  I used ketchup on the top for a glaze...I would probably increase my amount of ketchup in the recipe to 1/2 cup or add in a small can of tomato paste.   I served this with sour cream and chive mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables....Will definitely make this again with a few revisions....

My husband is not a fan of meatloaf, I blame most of the dislike on his vegetarian  diet. I made the recipe using quorn ground meat style (mushroom protein) and a blend of jalapeno jack and cheddar cheese.  We both loved it.  He even plans on eating it again. Next time I am going to try an extra egg to see if it will stick together better.

Very good, but a little salty.  Rather than ketchup I use a small can of tomato paste to cut some of the salty flavor.  I also use left over corn flakes ILO of crackers.

Really good stuff!! This was the first time I have ever made meatloaf and it came out perfect!  I sifted the onion "chips" out of the soup package and only used those, and spread some ketchup on top before baking.  I also substituted bread crumbs for the crackers and it came out great!

I usually hate meatloaf, but this is one of the best tasting meatloaf recipes I've had.  The steak sauce (I used A-1) really added alot of flavor. My husband has never really liked any meatloaf other than his mother's and he admitted that this one was better!  I also added 2 Tbsp of grated onion.  We'll definetly have this againQ

I was not a meatloaf eater but my husband really wanted me to make one.  This recipe sounded a little different so I thought I'd try it. Very good!  Flavorful and easy to make. I've made it twice now and pretty much have followed the recipe exactly as stated.

Any one worried about making a dry meatloaf should make this as it turned out very moist. I think I used too much ketchup on mine as in some bites I felt I was just tasting ketchup -so do not be tempted to add more than recipe states!
My husband enjoyed it and he can be fussy. It was not a WOW dinner but good.

I have made this recipe for years as a family favorite.  The only change we make is using BBQ sauce for the ketchup and adding a little salsa for some extra kick.  Also, we spoon the mixture into muffin pans so it bakes faster (30 min at 350 degrees)and makes nice little individual servings.

Great meatloaf recipe! This is the only meatloaf I've made for my husband that he'll eat just as heartily as his mother's! I made two small changes: instead of the onion soup mix I used a package of Fiesta Ranch Dip Mix...the flavor this adds is phenomenal! Secondly, I used half the suggested amount of ketchup and used Heintz 57 for the other half.

YUMMY!  A meal pleaser at my house.  All three children LOVED it. My husband said I can now make it again. After almost 8 years of marriage this was the second time to make it and it was a keeper. :)
Thank you!!

I thought this was amazing. I was scared to use all of the seasoning from the onion soup mix so I only used about 1/2. It still had an incredible flavor to it. Thanks

I definitely followed some of the additions/changes suggested and the glaze of 1/2 c. ketchup, 1 tbsp. vinegar, 1 tbsp. yellow mustard, 1/4 c. sugar is a MUST!  I cannot wait to make this for my Mom...I know she will be blown away that the meatloaf I make will be better than hers! (Sorry Mom!)

This was absolutely awesome. My first meatloaf experience was a success. Next time I would add more cheese and ketchup and A1.

Hi, I made this meatloaf for dinner tonight for myself and my husband and we both thought it was very very bland it needs alot of help we like really flavorful food and this just was not. Although, I do think it would be a good basic recipe to start with and add lots of flavor to it..but as written bland,bland,bland!!!!
Thanks,

I'm writing this after my teenage daughter and her friends finished demolishing this meatloaf and RAVING about it.  This, of course, after the fact of my daughter being mortified that her mother was serving meatloaf for dinner!!  I didn't have any onion soup mix so used beef bouillion & onion powder to replace.  Also was out of steak sauce so improvised with some stir fry sauce and a bit of worchestershire.  Don't know how my changes affected original recipe but it was still great.  Also, added ketchup to top for last 15 minutes or so.  Definitely one we'll be making again.

This is the best Meatloaf recipe I have ever found bar none! I normally don't care for it too much but my husband gets bored with chicken so this is now a go to recipe of mine. I did change the recipe slightly. I used a 50/50 mix of beef and grownd lamb. Added 1/2 a chopped red onion and a pinch of cayenne pepper. It's awesome and versatile. Next time I will add more cheese.

Great Recipe!  I lined bottom of the pan with bread to absorb grease and put 3 pieces of american cheese the last 20 minutes. Definately in my top 2 meatloaf recipies! Needed to cook a few more minutes but that may be my oven. My 10month, 3 & 4 yr old and husband all ate it up fast - easiest dinner in months!!!! Thanks!

Yum! Now that's the good stuff!! I fixed this for dinner tonight and followed the recipe except for the crackers. I didn't have any so I used bread crumbs instead. We all just loved this meatloaf!! I made a glaze of 1 cup ketchup, 1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce, and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Fantastic!

This is a staple meal for my home!!  It is so easy and fast to make -- a huge timesaver with lots of flavour too.  I assemble it in the morning, then pop it in the oven for exactly 1 hour when I'm ready.  I nuke some veggies and make some rice to go with this -- my boyfriend absolutely loves this meatloaf!!  This recipe was the reason I became a member of allrecipes!!!

Maybe I did something wrong, but when I made this a couple months ago, it was disastrous. When I took the loaf out of the oven, it was floating in grease and the flavor was not good. I had added a glaze, as a previous review suggested, and I remember that being tasty, but it still couldn't save this dish.

Delicious!  I had second and thirds, which never happens with meatloaf.  I've always liked my mom's meatloaf but I can never make it as well as she does (there's no written recipe for it) so I went recipe searching.  I really enjoyed this recipe, it's simple but flavorful and it wasn't dry at all (my meatloafs usually are).  The only change was that I added some spinach, as another reviewer had suggested and I made mine in an 8x8 pan...so it technically wasn't a "loaf" but it was still good.  Thanks for the recipe!

My roommate and I loved this. I made a few changes, but I think it would have been good as is, too. I used only 1/2 of the onion soup mix, added some diced garlic, and added about 2/3 cup of spinach. I will definitely keep making this. Thank you!

I'd give this a 5, my husband liked alot but said it was "missing the ketchup like mom used to make"  :-) so next time I'll probably put some on.  Topping or no, this was a fabulous recipe.  It was very moist and the steak sauce gave great flavor but didn't overwhelm. Only change made was using a couple Tbs of dried minced onion instead of the soup mix since you're only supposed to use the onions anyway.    A definite keeper!

Obviously, I am in the minority, and to be fair, I guess I am just not a mealoaf person.  Fortunately, I read the review by the submitter and sifted the onion flakes out of the soup mix, but other than that I made the recipe as written.  It wasn't a bad meatloaf, it just wasn't an interesting meatloaf.  I think that putting a glaze on it like other reviewers suggested would bump it up to ****.

After trying many meatloaf recipes, I have finally found a keeper!! My picky family all loved this recipe! They all like to ruin a perfectly good steak with steak sauce an I am not real fond of the sweeter meatloaf recipes, so I thought this would be a good recipe to try. It was the perfect combination for all of us. I did use 2 lbs of hamburger so I just upped the cheese to 1c., crackers to 3/4c., and kethup to 1/3c. Otherwise everything else was the same and it was perfect! Thank you Rempel family!!!

Good to try some local recipes! It was delicious and so simple. I used frozen bread crumbs rather that crackers. Yummy--hubby said it was better that the brown sugar meatloaf I usually make.

Excellent Meatloaf! And I have a very picky crew, so a definite 5 star rating! I ended up using 2 lbs beef for our large family, and the packet of onion soup mix was 1 3/8 oz, and I used all of it, and I was out of buttery crackers so used saltines, but followed rest of recipe exactly. Not only will I make this again, but I will be passing this on to my sisters and Mom, it was gobbled up with gusto!

This meatloaf is absolutely delicious.  I used to despise meatloaf night in my parent's house as a child b/c I deemed the meatloaf as inedible, and I was afraid to make it for years.  However, this meat loaf is extremely easy to make, and it turns out so moist and tender!!!  You don't need a gravy or glaze for this (and I'm the type who DOUSES condiments on my meat).  Even the husband, a self-proclaimed meatloaf hater, went back for seconds!

This was one of the best meatloafs I have ever tasted! Per others' suggestions, I only used 1 egg instead of 2 and it was perfect. I would strongly suggest mixing ketchup, steak sauce, and brown sugar (amounts of each to your specific taste) and spoon it all over the top of the meatloaf before baking. Wow!!!

This is a very good and easy meatloaf recipe.  I do use 2 lbs. of meat and add diced green pepper.  Make sure you do not over cook it so that it stays moist.

I have used this recipe for years now, my family and friends just love it. The only thing that I add to it, is a glaze that I make up with 3/4 c katchup, 2 tbsps. mustard and 4 tbsps. brown sugar. I put it on top the last 15 mins. of baking, yum yummy.

Long live the Rempels!!!! This is a terrific meatloaf! Other than using meatloaf mix (pork, veal, and beef) instead of all ground beef, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly. It was flavorful and so very, very moist! Hubby and I used the leftovers to make meatloaf sandwiches with a bit of mayonnaise the next day and we agreed that the meatloaf tasted even better a day later. Thanks for sharing such a fabulous recipe. This one is a real keeper!

This was a hit!  Added 1/2 cup chopped onion, basil, and italian seasoning.  TO SHORTEN COOKING TIME: Instead of using the "loaf" pan, spread the meat mixture in a pie plate and create a ring by making a two-inch hole in the center, bake at the same temperature for 25 to 30 minutes. It works just as well.

This is a very good recipe.  It gave me a lot of good ideas for my own meatloaf.  The picture helped alot, I made a side dish of green peppers, onions, and mushrooms to put on top of the meatloaf.  This is the key for this recipe.  My boyfriend still covered it with ketcup though.  He says that you can never have too much ketcup!!!

This recipe was okay.  I hated the onion soup mix in it, which is strange because I use it in other recipes.  My husband didn't like the steak sauce.  The meat was so wet, I would use 2 lbs instead of 1.5 lbs.  My advise is to go to the most helpful and read the review with the highest number.  I think if I had read it first it would have been better.

Not a bad meatloaf.  The steak sauce may have been a bit overpowering.  My family thought it was so-so.  I am still looking for the ultimate meatloaf recipe.

We thought this was very good. Got a little scared when I added the egg mixture to the meat, it seemed like to much liquid to me. I added a touch more cracker crumbs to help bind it. Also, used the 2 slices of bread in the bottom of the pan and it worked like a CHARM! I'll always do that from now on. Thought this had a great meatloaf flavor, you can taste the steak sauce too. Thank you!

HONESTLY FOR MEATLOAF THIS ONE IS FANTASTIC! I DID MAKE SOME CHANGES TO THE ORIGINAL RECIPE IN THAT ADDED I MUSHROOM TO THE MEAT MIX AND ADDED MORE CHEASE TO THE MIX. I ALSO THEN PLACED ONLY HALF THE MEATLOAF ON THE PAN AND SHAPED THEN PLACED A LAYER OF MOZERRALLA CHEESE AND SLICES OF BOILED EGGS. LASTLY I ADDED THE SWEET AND SOUR MEATLOAF'S TOPPING AS SUGGESTED AND USED THE BREAD TO CONTROL THE OIL. IT TURNED OUT GREAT, REAL BIG HIT. TRY THE EGGS AND CHEESE IN THE MIDDLE IF YOU GET A CHANCE, I GOT GREAT COMPLIMENTS ON THAT TECHNIQUE.

I love this recipe. I have been using it for about a year. Husband requests it about once a month. I only use 1 lb of meat and eyeball the other ingredients. So far I have made this with ground pork, turkey, bison, and beef. Sometimes throw in diced onions or jalepenos if I have them. A definite staple!

This is about as good as a meatloaf is going to get. Unfortunately, meatloaf has it's limits. That said, it's a touch better than my mother used to make... which is saying something.

My husband is also one of those picky eaters and he was very hesitant to try this, but he did and really liked it.  I think that you could add more steak sauce or something with a kick like Worcestershire or chipotle Tabasco, maybe a little green onion for color or fresh garlic.  I doubled the recipe and mixed (about 1.2 lbs) 80% lean ground beef with (about 2 lbs)93% lean and used the bread on the bottom...turned out great.  Oh and don't worry if you use a little too many crackers.  As for too much salt, onion soup mix is rather salty so just adjust that to your preference.  However I made a double batch and froze half - I do not recommend this.  When the frozen one was cooked it was mushy.

Very good, my husband enjoyed it.  He said it tasted like meatloaf is supposed to taste.  If you let the meatloaf sit for a little bit it won't be so runny.

I have been on a quest to find the perfect meatloaf recipe that wows my husband. This is not the perfect recipe yet; however,it is still very delicious. With a little tweaking and extra spice I think it could be even better. I used 1/2 pound of ground pork and 1 & 1/2 pounds of lean ground beef, and I added 2 minced garlic cloves. I kept everything else the same. Next time I think I will use chili sauce instead of ketchup. I think I will also make a gravy to go with it. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested putting bread on the bottom of the pan to absorb the grease-it worked great! The texture was perfect-I will definitely be making this again. Thank you for the recipe!

Put bread in the bottom of the pan to soak up the grease as suggested.  Served this to my family of 5.  There was not any left.  This is a keeper.

Very good, very easy.....be sure to make gravy with the drippings. Meatloaf without gravy is no fun.

I am not a big fan of meatloaf but I wanted to try something new for my husband. This is the best meatloaf I have ever tasted. I've made it several times now since first finding this recipe and everyone absolutely loves it. Thanks you so much for submitting this...it's now one of our favorite meals!

I made it exactly according to the recipe and it is fabulous.  It also makes great leftover meatloaf sandwiches with mustard.  It was a bit greasy and I will try the low-fat cheese next time.  Try this - you won't be disappointed!

I was a little leary about trying this recipes at the firehouse without first trying it at home!!  Well, let me tell you, the guys were very, very impressed!!  I doubled the recipe, and made 2 using 3 lbs. of ground beef for each, and followed exactly.  Almost wasn't enough for 10 hungry guys..  According to the recipe, I made enough for 24 servings.  Very, very good.  This one is a keeper!

You cannot go wrong w/ this recipe.  I made this w/ 2 lbs. of ground beef instead of 1 1/2 lbs. but only used 1 pkg of onion soup mix and it was still seasoned perfectly.  I used Club crackers instead of the round ones.  The whole family loved this one...can't wait to make into sandwiches tomorrow. I'll definitely make this again!

Flavourful!  I topped it with some Raspberry Chipolte sauce and sprinkled w/ pepper.  The nice thing about the recipe is it is a great base that allows you to add to it, like minced veggies.  Beware of the salt content, you may want to decrease it by 1/2 a teaspoon OR just use 2 pounds beef instead.

Good meatloaf but a little too sweet and a little too much onion. Next time I will use only half the onion soup mix and will use brown gravy instead of the ketchup I used on top. I think that is why it was sweet. Otherwise very good.

Let me join the masses by saying it was WONDERFUL! My husband wasn't too thrilled when I said meatloaf was for dinner, but he said it was excellent! The steak sauce gave it a unique flavor, and the onion soup mix made it just salty enough without overdoing it!
Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful meatloaf. I made a little more than the recipe said and made the meatloaf in muffin cups.
I also used 1/2 lean beef and 1/2 turkey. It was delicious. I didn't have onion soup so I used chopped onion and green peppers with ketchup, worcestershire sauce.
It seemed very greasy in the muffin pan, but it tasted great. Ritz crackers and cheese added a nice touch. I used reduced fat cheddar and a little mozzerella.
YUMMMMMMY!

This was wonderful! I have tried several recipes and this one really hit it off with my family. I did however substitute mozzerella chesse for the cheddar and i used plain bread crumbs.  The steak sauce was a wonderful addition to this recipe.  Thanks Again!

Excellent meat loaf! It was delicious. After reading all of the reviews (especially the submitter - Connie Rempel's) I sifted the onion lipton soup and and only used a pinch or two of the powder - this helped to reduce the saltiness. I saw that some people used Cheese flavored crackers and I couldnt find any so I used regular Ritz cracker  which was perfect because the recipe already calls for cheddar cheese. This recipe was excellent, my husband and daughter both loved it.  Thanks so much Connie!!!!

Great meatloaf! One of my kids who hates meatloaf actually ate all of his. I made it last night for dinner. I don't like to adjust recipes, but had to because I didn't have steak sauce like I thought. I substituted with 2 tbsps of teriyaki marinade...Also when I mixed everything it seemed a little too wet, so I added 1/2 cp seasoned bread crumbs. Came out perfect. Thanks!

I added real (not dried) minced garlic, Worcestershire sauce, a tsp or so of mustard, and some sauteed onion pieces.  Be careful up don't make it too wet! The butter crackers are perfect!  It gives the meatloaf a nicer texture than bread crumbs.

This meat loaf recipe was absolutely scrumptious!  If you’re looking for a traditional tasting meat loaf that’s quick and easy, this is the recipe you need.  It’s very flavorful and moist, yet not overpowering to the palate – giving it a real home-cooked taste.  Since I did not have on hand “buttery crackers,” or onion soup mix, I substituted with round wheat crackers and used about ¼ cup of Frenchy’s French Fried Onions (crushed) with 2 tsp of onion powder.  I served it with mashed potatoes & gravy, broccoli spears and carrots with a Monterey Jack cheese sauce.  My husband & I loved it.  Thank you for sharing!

This is the most delicious, flavorful meatloaf I have ever had the good fortune to make.  I've tried many recipes and always the meatloaf is just bleh, but this is so easy and the cheese and steak sauce add such a nice dimension to it.  I heated up a seperate jar of gravy to put on top because my husband loves it with gravy.  Definately try this recipe, it's top notch!

Deliciously moist!  I've been searching for a meatloaf recipe that doesn't get me a wrinkled nose when asked "what's for supper?" This past the test hubby & kid (1, 5, & 15) approved.  Great job, thank you! :)

This is my new favorite meatloaf!!! For years I've been using the Lipton Onion Soup Mix meatloaf recipe, but decided to try this and DH and I both LOVED it!!!!!  I used saltines instead of buttery crackers and it was still delicious - can't wait to eat the leftovers!

I love this recipe as written, but I've made some changes to suit our family and it came out great! I use 1 pound ground venison and 1 pound ground pork in place of beef, 1/2 cup crushed hot and spicy cheezit crackers in place of butter crackers,and 2tsp dragon sauce (like a hot soy sauce), 1 tsp worchestershire sauce, and a tablesoon of garlic onion jam in place of the steak sauce. I also bake it in a 9x9 inch pan so it's done a little sooner. The kids love it and it's one of my husbands favorite meals. Even the way it's written originally is fabulous. Best meatloaf recipe I 've ever found... and I've looked! thanks!

A very simple yet tasty recipe. I followed others advice and added an onion and the whole packet of onion soup. Mine was not too salty (as others have commented)so I guess it depends on the brand of soup you use. It was also very light in texture which was great. I will definitely make this again- more so than the brown sugar meatloaf which to my taste is too sweet.

There were a lot of reviews that kept comparing this meatloaf to the BROWN SUGAR MEATLOAF... This is what i have to say... I love the brown sugar meatloaf, and i love this one too! It just depends what you are in the mood for! Sweet or more traditional with a little something different. My husband LOVED this! That is saying something i my house! Great recipe!!!!!

We had this last night, and it was awesome!!  It doesn't taste like meatloaf, which is why we liked it so much.  We cooked it longer than the recipe indicated and served with the Company Potatoes from this site.

It's ok... my friends said it was good, but I thought it was a bit too salty.  I'm a gravy person and I like gravy with my meatloaf and it was just too salty for gravy.

WOW! My whole family loved it. I am a garlic lover so I pressed 2 cloves of garlic into it and only used half the package of onion soup mix. Next time I make it I might use a pepper jack cheese to give it a little kick.

I've made many a meatloaf, but this by far is the best recipe that I have found.  Everyone loved it! I had doubled the recipe so that we could have left overs, but there wasn't much left.  I will be making this over & over again. I didn't have the onion soup mix, but I did have a packet of vegetable soup mix, I used that & added a little extra minced onion & it came out great.  Thank You Connie for a great recipe!!

This is an average good meatloaf.  Nothing exceptionally good or bad.  I would half the soup mix unless you really like the taste of onions.

After reading the comments about this recipe I knew it was a good one, but I had a few reservations.  So… I sifted out the onion soup mix as Connie suggested, to avoid too much salt.  I mixed everything together very well and let the meatloaf rest a few minutes after baking, to avoid crumbling.  The result?  DELICIOUS!  It has a sweet, mild oniony taste and really fills you up.    I'll make it again.

This was a great variation on plain, boring meatloaf! I used tomato sauce instead of ketchup and it turned out great! The only complaint from my family was that there was too much onion. I think I will only use half of the onion soup mix next time.

This recipe didn't turn out quite so great for me.  I followed the directions to a tee, but my husband didn't like the smell of it, so he wouldn't eat it.  I tried a small portion of it, but ended up throwing the entire meatloaf away.  Not sure why mine came out so gross.

Excellent! While my husband is a big fan of meatloaf, I am not but this I really liked! Next time I make it,the only change I'd make would be half a package of onion soup. The onions were a little overpowering.

This meat loaf was quite good. I had mixed reviews from my kids, two loved it and two hated it. I added a glaze of ketchup, lemon juice, steak sauce and mustard powder. I really like the addition of a glaze. My only complaint with this meatloaf is that it didn't hold together well, even after significant cooling. Maybe some added cracker crumbs and egg might improve the sticking quality. Overall, excellent taste, good texture.

I made this recipe and we loved it.  Then, I made a low-carb version and loved it just as much.  I substituted plain (not spiced) pork rinds for the crackers, substituted mustard (the deli kind that has horseradish)for the ketchup & steak sauce, substituted dehydrated onions for the onion soup mix, and added bacon & sage.  Turned out great.

Awesome!  I love the original version here but have tweaked over the years for our family. I use ground turkey (NOT the EXTRA lean kind), which eliminates any grease mentioned in other reviews. I typically use bread crumbs in place of crackers. I add one small diced onion and  a can of sliced mushrooms (drained) to the meat mixture. I top with a layer of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce before popping in the oven. Excellent flavor--you'd never miss the beef! My mother in law happened upon some leftovers in our fridge and ate it for lunch-she said that this was the best meatloaf she ever had! We love the leftovers on sandwiches.

Meatloaf is my boyfirend's favorite dinner. I used this recipe for my first ever meatloaf. He loved it and so did I! (And meatloaf is not even one of my favorite things to eat!)

This was the first time I ever made meatloaf - it was for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved it - said it tasted like his mom's - a pretty good compliment I think!  I might use a little less ketchup next time though - it seemed there was a little too much.

After reading some of the reviews, I used 2 pounds of beef and 1/2 pkg. of the onion soup mix.  It turned out very well and my husband really liked it.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Great! Now I finally have a meatloaf recipe the whole family loves. I served this as part of my "comfort food" menu right after a family funeral, and everyone raved about this. My husband wants me to make it every week!

This is a great meatloaf!  I was in the kitchen for five minutes preparing it, and in an hour, it was done!  Even my husband, who's not a meatloaf lover, ate it up.

This was probably the fifth meal I've cooked in my entire life.  My husband is the head chef around here.  This recipe was so easy, quick, and it came out absolutley wonderful.  My husband ate almost the whole pan.  My two year old loved it too.

I found this recipe to be rather bland.  I didn't use the soup mix because of the MSG but added lots of carmelized onion.

Delicious. This is a good recipe. My kids love meatloaf but this is the ticket at the end of a long work day. This recipe is quick and easy. I made a ketchup, brown sugar, Worcester sauce glaze for the second half of baking.

Made it according to the recipe except I used 2 lbs of ground beef. It came out great and my family loved it. We ate it hot, and also used it cold for meatloaf sandwiches :-)

My husband loved it and he's picky about his meatloaf.  I can't make any other now!  Only thing I did differently was change the ketchup to tomato sauce, and I didn't have the "round" crackers so I used Club Crackers.

I beat the wet ingredients together, add the dry onion soup, and let it soak a few minutes before adding the ground beef.  Turns out delicious every time!

Absolutely delicious!!
I doubled the recipe.  The only changes I made was using half A-1 steak sauce and half Worcestershire Sauce and I used a colby jack cheese (it’s what I had in the fridge) instead of cheddar.  My entire family loved it. Thank goodness I made a double batch. Thanks for the recipe!!

I have made this more times than i can count. That's the truth. I use Mrs. Remple's changes, but other than that I make it as written. People practically lick their dishes when I serve this. Stop looking through recipes, you just found the perfect meatloaf.

I use to hate meatloaf.  And, the hubby loves it.  This recipe was shared with me back in 2001.  My friend Cathy called it the "blob!"  She also adds 1/2 cup of chopped onion to it and it's.  delicious!!!   Glad to make this meatloaf any day of the week!

This was very good, I spread a layer of breadcrumbs on the bottom of the baking dish.  Modified slightly with 3/4 cup crushed saltine crackers,  jalepeno Jack cheese and 1 tsp. pepper.  I followed other recommendations and topped with a glaze; 3 tbsp. Ketchup, 1 tbsp. honey and 1/2 tbsp. Worchestershire.  Thanks for sharing!

What hasn't been said about this WONDERFUL meatloaf?   It was very good, although I did make a few changes - 93% gr. beef, Ritz Garlic Butter crackers, A-1 sauce, 1/2 pkt. of  onion  soup mix (due to the high sodium), along with 1/2 of a diced onion.  I did not add the ketchup.  I baked in four mini loaf pans (to freeze later).  I had no grease to drain, and the loafs were still moist.  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you.

My family LOVES this. It’s the only meatloaf I ever make. My hubby and 11 year old asked for seconds. The only thing was I was low on ketchup (didn’t have enough for 1/4 cup) so I just used the little ketchup we had and some bbq sauce til it was 1/4 cup. Super yummy!

Very good fluffy meatloaf! I used seasoned Italian bread crumbs in place of the crackers. Yummy!

It was really good - even my pickiest eater ate it :)
I subbed 1/2 ground turkey and it was still very greasy/juicy.  I used 1 c. of cheese, and 1 full cup of crushed crackers.  The glaze on top is not needed in my opinion.  Goes great with brown gravy.   Cook for at least an hour, and I upped the temp to 425 for the last 20 minutes - turned out great.

Only change made was I used 2# ground beef instead of the 1.5 in the recipe. Turned out moist and flavorful, the best meatloaf made in my almost 62 years. I also topped it with the ketchup, honey and Worcestershire mix, as suggested in a past review. Rave reviews from my guys and  super easy - you have to give this a try. Thanks Connie!!!!

My husband does NOT like meatloaf, so I gave up on making it. But, no more! I followed the recipe, just went a little heavier on the crackers, added a little cayenne cause we like heat, and glazed the top with Baby Ray's bbq sauce.....the kitchen smelled amazing while this was in the oven...my husband LOVED it! My son and I loved it, I was in shock!!!  Maybe it's the cheddar cheese or the Ritz crackers.  Ritz crackers now come in flavors, so I used "garlic butter", I cannot stress enough how delicious this was for my picky eaters, it's easy, only a few ingredients and it's a savory wonderful family meal, meatloaf is back!!  almost forgot.....the leftovers, I'm gonna pack this into a soft tortilla w/cheddar cheese, and crushed red pepper, cuz it's that good!! This is 6 stars but, they only allow 5.

This was close to perfect. I didn’t have the “round butter crackers” so I substituted the “rectangle butter crackers”. It turned out very moist, and cooked  fully in the time specified. . I think I’ll add  some more cheese next time, but the proportions were perfect in this recipe.

EVERY SINGLE person raved about this meatloaf!!!  I added 1/2 cup of milk and  only 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar cheese (shredded).  Substituted Worcestershire for steak sauce and since we did not have any in the cupboard.  Cooked only until it registered 160 degrees in center.  I poured off the grease and let the dish rest for 15 minutes before serving.  It was unbelievably moist and flavorable!  No leftovers of this dish!!!

I thought it was pretty good. I don't know that I will make it again because there are too many other recipes to try. It was good but not my favorite. Everything turned out fine. It was moist enough and the loaf kept its shape, never fell apart. It smelled wonderful while baking.  It is just a matter of taste I guess.

This meatloaf was delicious! I misread the ingredients and used BBQ sauce instead of steak sauce—made no difference. Easy recipe and is definitely a keeper. Thanks!

This was my first time making meatloaf with this recipe and I can honestly say it was the most best meatloaf I have ever made. It came out really moist and very flavorful. My husband and son really liked it and I will definitely be making this again.

This is a good meatloaf recipe. I left the cheese out (not my choice) so next time I will add it. I also may have cooked it a bit too long and/or used ground beef with too low  a fat content-it was a tad dry. I don’t think it was the recipe’s fault though.

Didnt have crackers so used panko bread crumbs. Didnt have steak sauce so used worchestire sauce. 
Have made with crackers and steak sauce, but taste is pretty close to the same.....which is DELICIOUS!

I thought my old recipe was good, until I tried this one. This is definitely my new favorite! I doubled the recipe; otherwise I followed it exactly, because I had all the ingredients called for. The meatloaf came out firm but tender and moist, and it's delicious!

DE. LISH. It was so moist and flavorful. I followed the recipe with the only tweak being that I used 1 lb of ground beef and 1/2 lb mild ground sausage. I used Ritz crackers and Heinz 57 for the steak sauce. It was so good. The cheese sort of oozes out the top a little and looks so appetizing. Will definitely make this again and probably double the batch since it was all gobbled up.

I made this for dinner hoping it would be a good meal and have some leftover. My wife is sick so I have to cook at times. Now, let me tell you I am no cook. The directions were easy to understand and the cooking time was accurate. (I just put new heating elements in oven and a new gasket on the door) I made it a second time and doubled the recipe for leftovers through the week. I did not have onion soup mix this time so I used onion powder-1 tsp., garlic powder 2 tsp., cayenne pepper 1tsp., and Lawry's seasoned salt 2 tsp. Remember this is 3 pounds of meat. I measured the cheese with it on the heavy side. This meatloaf is very fast and easy to make and the flavor is very good. The texture is ideal. (I had meatloaf that was a bit to juicy) My wife is already feeling better. Thanks for this recipe.

Outstanding as written. Always try and follow the original initially and it was excellent. Will probably play with it a little to see where it goes, but it is very very good. Easy peasy too.

Love this recipe. I have been making this for years. I only add half a package of onion mix because too much upsets our stomachs. Sometimes I have to add extra cracker to soak up some moisture. I'm gonna try in burger form next time.

1.27.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/20675/rempel-family-meatloaf/ ... 'Only change was plain breadcrumbs instead of crackers.  It didn't "wow" anyone here.  Ground beef, steak sauce & a bit of cheese primarily.  No magic, but we'll certainly finish it.

I've looked far and wide for the best meatloaf recipe and this is it! At times, I've been without butter crackers, so I improvised with breadcrumbs and melted butter. The more butter, the better. It makes a delicious burger as well. Babeque sauce on top and or in the mix is a nice addition too. Thank you Rempel Family,,,,

Love this recipe! I make it for 8 servings. I add 2 TBSP, 2 tps of minced onion.  On top of the meatloaf I added 3 TBS of Ketchup, 1 TBSP Honey, and 1/2 Tsp of Worstershire sauce.  Turned out great!

This I'll make again, very good indeed.  I made a larger loaf using 36 oz of 93% lean ground beef and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly.  I substituted Stubb's Original BBQ for ketchup and added some Worcestershire sauce too.  It was a little firm mixing up so I added a bit of water until it reached the desired consistency.  I shaped the mixture into a loaf on foil-lined baking sheet and baked until it was 160 degrees.   Excellent every meal for 3 days following.  Will make again!

My boyfriends exact words were "This meatloaf is killer!" It truly is delicious. The biggest complaint I got after making it was there wasn't enough for leftovers.

Absolutely the best meatloaf I ever made.  Some minor changes. I always start my meatloaf with 1 lb of lean hamburger and 1 lb of ground pork. I added a daub of sour cream and a tsp of cayenne. I also let my mixed meatloaf sit in the refrigerator covered for a couple of hours before forming the loaf and baking. That's it. My wife and I invited another couple over for dinner. We just kept coming back for more. The four of us finished it off. So much for left overs for sandwiches the next day.

This turned out really well. It had a nice flavor and my BF and his friend ate it up! I did use a mix of lean beef and ground pork that I had left over. Everything else was the same ratio with half a recipe because it was for just the two men. I did add extra cracker crumbs (prob 1/3 cup for the half recipe)  because it was too moist....I shaped it in the pan thinking it was still a bit moist but my goal was a not dry meatloaf. Half way through cooking time I drained the fat, very little, as well as 3/4 the way done, still not too much. I did do a glaze (per reviews) of ketchup, honey and Worcestershire the last 15 minutes because....yeah, it's meatloaf and that's how we were raised....it was moist and stayed  together with little effort. I will make this again!! Thank you for sahring!

Someone taught me to concave down the center of meatloaf for a more even cook ....an added bonus is the extra thick layer of glaze, if you prefer....and when using a loaf pan, after forming your loaf, pack it away fom the edges of the pan to leave room for the fat to pool so you can drain it during the cooking process. You can use it for gravy or the dog bowl, either way someone is going to be happy!

This was the best meatloaf I have ever made. My family raved about it and my 4 year old ate all of it. Thanks for sharing and I will be making this one again. The only change I made was adding a glaze of ketchup, brown sugar and steak sauce on the top for the last 30 minutes.

I only made one change. Added more steak sauce. We used A-1 but you could easily change the flavor up by using whatever your favorite is. Made it according to the recipe except for that. It's great!

Made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious. Very flavorful. Made meatloaf as indicated but did add a topping of ketchup, Worcestershire and brown sugar during the last 5 min. Will certainly make again. Thank you for the recipe.

Oops, accidentally submitted an incomplete review. Anyhoo ... Found this recipe years ago and it’s my (and my daughter’s) favorite. So glad I came across it again and have it added to my AR faves. I’ve never been a big meatloaf fan (don’t dig the too-soft texture or sweet ketchup taste of most); this one is more firm and savory.

Great meatloaf! This recipe needs no revision except for the  Keto folks: Try the no sugar added catsup and instead of the buttery crackers use crushed pork rinds. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter and add the crushed pork rinds to the butter then mix that in with the eggs, catsup and steak sauce mixture. Pretty dang good.

Delicious meatloaf however I only used 1/2  packet of onion soup mix to cut down on salt.  I added 1/2 cup of chopped onions & 1/4 cup of chopped celery to add the flavor.  To also cut back on the fat I used 12oz of Buffalo meat & the rest was lean ground beef.  This did not cut down on beef flavor & my family loved it!  Even my mom was surprised by my meat combo but it didn’t stop her from getting a second helping.  I would have given this a five star rating but since I altered recipe it can only get 4 stars.

I was missing some ingredients and had to improvise. It was still amazing. Used Garden Vegetable Ritz crackers instead of original, only had one pound of beef, and used Shullsburg sharp cheddar cheese spread in lieu of shredded cheese because it was what I had available. Added extra 1/4 c crackers to make up for missing meat. Made in glass loaf dish sprayed with cooking spray. The man loved it and I was very pleased with how great it turned out. Will definitely make it again.

Holy Meatloaf!  What a hit with the family.  Super easy to make, smelt amazing while cooking and came out perfect.  I did use ground beef, veal & pork combo instead of plain ground beef. Served with a cheesy hasbrown casserole and corn.  Thanks for the recipe!

lets face it - if you have a discerning palate there's only so much you can do with meatloaf.  however, this was the tastiest and  most moist meatloaf I've ever had and this is now my new meatloaf recipe.   I served this with chef johns mushroom gravy and both my young adult boys went for thirds which never happened with meatloaf before.   thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was a great surprise- the perfect meatloaf!  I was a little skeptical at first because it seemed too easy, using minimal ingredients and being so simple to make.  I was completely wrong- this baked beautifully, had a wonderful appearance, and was absolutely delicious.  My family wants this again and again- and I love having something so simple that tastes as if you spent hours assembling and baking.  I changed absolutely nothing and I'm glad I didn't!  Thanks for a "wow" recipe...

We love meatloaf. This one did not disappoint. One of the best we have eaten. I drained the grease after 45 minutes and added 2 teaspoons both ketchup and steak sauce to top, continued to bake for 15 more minutes. Meatloaf was dense and held together beautifully. Taste was phenomenal.

It's okay not to die for, maybe because I subbed the Ketchup out and replaced it with Tomato Sauce. I think what saved it was melting some Cheddar on the top and browning it the last 5 minutes in the oven with the broiler on low.

I have been using this recipe for about 5 years.  I use it for the homeless ministry I'm involved with at my local church.  I cook for our local homeless shelter about 3 times a year, and this meatloaf is always a HIT!  What I do a little differently with this recipe is that I make them into "mini" size, so they are individual servings.  I also make this for around 100 people, so I adjust the amounts needed for that. 
For the topping, I will leave some of the meatloaves plain, with no topping.  And I'll put a topping of ketchup, brown sugar and mustard on some, and the others I'll put bacon on the top.  That way people can choose whatever meatloaf they want.

The whole family likes this meatloaf.  Even my 11-yr-old son, who never like meatloaf before, looks forward to this meatloaf for dinner.

My only modification is that I use 1/2 of the onion soup mix.

Been making several meatloaf recipes recently and this has been the best. It was insanely delicious. Subbed in gluten free Italian breadcrumbs. I've made it twice, first time was a bit over done. Second time I baked for 50 minutes which put it at right above 160 degrees in all parts, I think that was key, it was perfectly baked and very moist at that point.

This is an extremely flavorful and DELICIOUS meatloaf!!! My husband (a gourmet cook and very critical) loved it! Juicy, rich and satisfying. I made the recipe as written, added mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli as sides for a complete meal. It's a keeper!!

I followed the recipe exactly as written. I read many of the reviews before begining. Because I was concerned about the fat contact, I used extra-lean chop meat; and I hardly got any grease! :)

My 17 yr. old and my 12 yr. old, both liked the flavor of the meatloaf.  I thought the flavor was just average; nothing special. So, I don't understand how there are so many great reviews? I don't think I'll be making this again.

Made this for myself. My co-workers swarmed in on the smell in the office. "What ya' got there Ron? Smells good!" But they didn't get any. Needless to say, there was their own meatloaf lunches brought in in the next few days. You can do the ketchup and brown sugar mix on it the last 15 minutes in the oven but I thought it was just fine with cold ketchup after nuking it. Recommended. I did add some diced onion from my garden.

Very good when I made it the first time. Though I added a little extra cumin and ketchup. The second time I reduced the onion soup mix along with using beef/pork blend. It definitely didn't turn out as nicely.

Very good! I made it exactly as written except for adding the glaze another reviewer suggested. 3T ketchup, 1T honey and
1/2t Worcestershire. I will make this again.

This was pretty good. A new flavor to my usual Parmesan turkey meatloaf. Mine turned out try for some reason. And it was super salty. Next time I would probably only use one packet of the onion soup mix and maybe include some dried onions. I will say, I normally need to eat any meatloaf with ketchup and I didn't need anything for this bad boy. I'd also add more cheese.

Great recipe! My friend went back for THIRDS! Was worried about saltiness from other's reviews, but we thought it was perfect as-is.
I made it with 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground pork. Though I'm guessing that original recipe was suggesting Ritz crackers, I used Cheez-Its. I also added per other's suggestions the 1/2 c. ketchup/2 T brown sugar/1T brown mustard glaze as a topping which was nice both for aesthetics and a bit more moisture. However, next time I will cut the brown sugar down to 1T, just because ketchup already is sweet.
I drained off most of the fat about 1/2 hour into cooking, and therefore didn't find it too greasy at the end.
Will definitely be making this again.

I found it extremely dry.  Perhaps I used the wrong blend of ground beef.  I would suggest a blend that has more fat, such as 70%.  I was dissapointed.

Sometimes I'll add finely chopped celery and bell peppers, but most of the time, I'll prepare it as written.  My family likes it, and that's a winner in my book!  Hate to say it Mom, but it beats your recipe!

I was skeptical because it was so simple to make. I was pleasantly surprised when it was done. It was delicious. 
I will make it again and again!
I substituted a chopped yellow onion in place of the onion soup mix. I'll try that next time.

Since my burger is in 1 lb packages, i used 2 so upped the crumbs to 3/4 cup and eggs to 4 small ones and added a little milk instead of water to make it more moist.  I baked it in a  9x13 and spread tomato sauce over the top for extra tang.  We LOVED it!!  Will definately make it again :}  Love the jazzed up flavor from the A1.  Will probably add more cheese next time too :}  Wonderful recipe and simple :D

The jury is out on this meatloaf. I have been making meatloaf for > 40 years and decided to change things up a bit by trying this recipe. I thought it was just ok. Hubs loved it. I would give 3 stars, hubby would give 5 stars thus the 4 star rating.  I made recipe exactly as written as I always do on first try. Used 85 lean ground beef, next time I might use 90 lean as there was a fair amount of grease in the pan. Will make it again.

This was the best meatloaf I have ever had.  (and I'm not crazy about meatloaf) I decided to try it due to the good reviews.  I think I would add more crushed crackers next time to help hold it together better.  I also used the glaze suggested by others which was very good.  All in all, I would make it again for sure!

I didn't have onion soup mix on hand so I took a 
Beef boulluon cube melted it in boiling water and onions and let it simmer til onions were tender and put the onions and a little of the broth in the mixture . It tasted great according to my grandchildren. I loved it too.

I haven't made yet because I'm trying to figure out a way around the packaged onion soup! Although I love the flavor, I cannot tolerate MSG and it is loaded!
All the other great additions sound delightful!

Let me start by saying I have not made it.  It just showed up in my email so I clicked the link to take a look because I love meatloaf.

Processed foods?  No way I will make a recipe that calls for ketchup, steak sauce and soup mix.

I make my meatloaf with ground beef, ground pork, onions, garlic, bell pepper, bread crumbs, eggs, tomato sauce (yes, canned) and salt and pepper.  Delicious!

Very, very good!  I used Lipton's Beefy Onion soup mix & since I didn't have any steak sauce on hand, I used Worcestershire sauce instead.  I also made a topping, as other reviewers suggested, of 3 T. Ketchup, 1 T. Honey & 1/2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce which I added 30 minutes into baking.  Yum!  Served it with baked potatoes & green beans.  Next time I will use cheddar & Swiss cheeses & will double the topping.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe, Connie!

I made it exactly as the recipe said.  It was pretty good.  My husband is picky as hell and his mother use to make a meatloaf I've never been able to duplicate, I love meatloaf but he didn't want to have any but his moms ??.  So I found this one said let me try it, if you dont like I'll never try again!  Well he liked it, he even took the leftovers for lunch!  Only thing I might change is add more liquid, either more ketchup, or a tad of water, it was a bit firm.  Of course then he probably wouldn't like it! ??

This was too moist. I do like the idea of adding dry onion soup mix instead of raw onion as I usually do to our regular meatloaf. I won't use this recipe again though. Not a firm loaf.

Amazing, this is now how I'll make meatloaf. The only things I did  different was 1.) the ritz crackers, I took five crackers out of the tube and ate them, then crushed the rest and put them in the loaf and 2.) I used ground turkey. Delicious, I'm converted.

Excellent meatloaf better than my usual. I add a little more than 1/2 cup of crushed crackers and I would add even more next time. Probably 1 cup of crushed crackers would be good. I also added a small minced onion, I would add the onion again  and next time I would probably throw in one or two bell peppers.

Everyone loved it! My guests said it was very good, I said it was just meatloaf. They said yes, but it was a very good meatloaf! Great flavor, easy to prepare. I cooked mine on a baking sheet covered with foil, no loaf pan. I just shaped the meat into a loaf. Will be making this every time I make meat loaf.

I make this with ground chicken,  use beef bouillon, and add bread crumbs ( chicken is wetter than beef), chopped green peppers, and chopped onion. My family will rave about this every time and do not want any other kind of meatloaf!

This has been a regular rotation for our family for a few years. The only changes I've made over time is to use whole wheat crackers, tsp of dry Coleman's mustard for some "pep", little less ketchup and a little Worcestershire sauce in place of ketchup, and about 1/2 of plain Panko breadcrumbs in addition to the crackers. We are salt sensitive in our family, but have not found this to be too salty. Go figure! I drain the fat from bottom as I have found adding bread slices to the bottom is just plain messy! Sometimes I use all lean ground beef, but do prefer it with a mix of ground sirloin and ground  pork. I don't use a glaze because hubbie swears his mother's meatloaf (from mid 60s-mid 70s had NO ketchup in it....yuh...ok!!!  Thanks for a staple in our house!

I left out the steak sauce as we had none.  Followed everything else.  Though I made the meatloaf, I do not eat meat.  The folks who did eat it claimed it was delicious.

I made it as the recipe says ,without the cheese.
I don't believe the cheese would add much flavour the excellent flavour without.

One of the best meatloaf recipes I have ever made!  My family LOVES it.  I make it as is, and every bite is gone pretty quickly.  Sometimes for a little variety, I put the mixture in large cup muffin pans (makes 6-8), and top with mashed potato "icing".  Super fun and tasty.

I have seen this recipe on this site for years and finally decided to try it.  I used Panko crumbs, as I had no crackers.  Reading reviews, I used 3/4 pkg. of the onion soup mix.  Never put cheese in my meatloaf, before.  Definitely will make this again.  He said this was my best meatloaf, yet!  Thanks.

No changes  -  best meatloaf I've made in years.  I make my meatloaf in a pan with a raised rack on bottom which means it's not sitting in grease as its cooking.

My daughter that complains every time I make meatloaf, said 'this is actually really good' that is  a stunning endorsement.  I will make this my go to recipe from now on.  
I will recommend that you let it sit for 15 minutes before cutting or serving, due to it being so moist.

I have made this multiple times and it's always a hit. The only thing I do differently is to use fresh onion instead of soup mix if I have it. If I have sundried tomato, I'll add that as well.

Love it! I did make a few changes. I sauted 1/4 cup of onion, red and green peppers in butter, 2 Tbls of ketchup and 2 Tbls. BBQ sauce and only used 1 egg. I also sprinkled fried onion on top. Amazing!

First, I thought I had all the ingredients and then freaked out when I realized I didn't have the onion soup mix.  No problem, I just found a recipe for that and continued on.  Everyone raved and I wouldn't make any changes.  Delish!!

Made as stated with exception of dry onion mix, didn't have any on hand so used clubhouse meatloaf mix.  The meatloaf was very moist and tasty, would make again but would add more cheese and a few more crackers, whilst these were recommended in other reviews I like to try recipes 'as is ' first then tweak if need be.  Would most definitely cook again. Great recipe

I forgot how greezy meatloaf is. I liked it added a bit extra crackers, cheese, steak sauce, used real chopped onion. I'll make it again.  Just might use less egg next time the sauce part was very wet which didn't help the grease situation. Padded with paper towels helps.

husband is a very picky eater. he loved it. I used saltine crackers because I didn't have the others and it was fine.  My only mistake was to use A1 for steak sauce. I think I will try BBQ or other sauce. A 1 was to strong for my liking. I will absolutely do it again.

I love the addition of the steak sauce in this :) the only thing I did different was added some sautéed onions and garlic

This was the best meatloaf I've had in a long time.  I made a few minor changes--breadcrumbs (2 slices--ends) instead of crackers (because my family CONSISTENTLY opens new bread without finishing the last loaf), a mixture of ketchup and bbq sauce (a little more bbq sauce than ketchup) instead of straight ketchup, fresh onion (whole) and bell pepper (half) in addition to the onion soup mix, and 2# of ground beef instead of 1.5#.  It was DELICIOUS!  And my family LOVED it!.

My family loves this meatloaf recipe!! The only change I made was I used Italian bread crumbs instead of the crackers and it comes out amazing!! I've made this meatloaf at least a dozen times since I came across the recipe. Thanks!

The taste was good.  No problem there.  My issue was, IT FELL APART!  Made it as written and upon trying to lift it from the  dish, it started falling apart, and KEPT falling apart.  So we had a pile of hamburger on the plate vs. a slice of meatloaf.  I'm assuming the 2 eggs were not enough to hold things together.  11 Ritz crackers didn't have enough starch to do it either.  A shame, as the taste was pretty good.

This was a very easy and super tasty meatloaf.  Toddlers and adults alike loved it.  The only thing I would suggest would be to skim off the fat/juices from the top after it's done cooking.

I made this for Father's Day for my meatloaf-loving husband, and he loved it!  I topped it with the glaze and used 1 lb. of 96% lean hamburger and 1/2 lb. of ground turkey. This cut down on the amount of grease in the end product. Other reviewers had mentioned "all the grease in the bottom of the pan" and "this was really greasy." I knew that two-thirds 96% lean hamburger and one-third ground turkey would help with that, but I also lined a baking sheet with parchment paper and shaped my meatloaf into a large mound in the middle of the parchment. I then poured the glaze over it. I learned this tip from a Cooks Illustrated recipe for meatloaf and I've done it ever since. It soaks up the grease and keeps it from surrounding the bottom of the meatloaf -- it really works well. 

The only other thing I would change would be to add about 1/2 - 1 cup of finely diced onions and some finely diced fresh or dried parsley. The meatloaf didn't have a whole lot of texture, and that would definitely give it a little punch. This was die-hard DELICIOUS, though. Seriously...

Finally a meatloaf that my family will eat! I didn't do the glaze that many reviewers mentioned bc dh doesn't like sweet entrees. I used 93% lean ground beef and it was not greasy at all. This one's a keeper.

I never use the same meatloaf recipe twice because I'm always slightly disappointed.  Not this time! Family of 5 raved about this one. I lightly brushed top w/honey BBQ last 20 min but that detracted from flavor. It's a keeper as-is.

I searched for a long time for a good meatloaf recipe, and I finally found this one!  It is SO easy and quick to throw together.  I always at least double the recipe and I usually use oats in place of the butter crackers, but that's because I always have the oats and I figure it's a little healthier that way.    We are a family of  9 (plus whoever else may be at our house), and everybody loves this recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Yep. That's a keeper! We didn't change a single thing and thought it was great as is. Served with French style green beans, mashed potatoes, gravy, and rolls.

This is by far the best meatloaf recipe I have ever had. It's wonderful just as written and that's the way I made it for about a year but lactose restrictions made me tweak it. Now I omit the cheese and add a tablespoon of beef boullion powder (usually knorr brand) and actually like it this way better. No one has missed the cheese, I'm not sure it was adding much flavor but it was adding extra grease. The bullion tones down the onion soup a little and adds a richness to the whole thing. However you make it, you're sure to find it a winner!

EASY GREAT FLAVOUFUL   We enjoyed this. I used 2 lbs. beef and 2 eggs , could use 3 eggs. I used soda crackers. I did not do bread on bottom tip because I listened to other review about it sticking to meatloaf so decided to just deal with the grease.
Onion soup and steak sauce adds lots of flavor.
Really good . Make again.

I'd never made meatloaf before and recently my boys tried some somewhere and begged me to make it for them. Meatloaf is never high on my list of cravings, but good meatloaf is hard to pass up. 

I used 3lbs of grass fed ground beef, doubled the ingredients and followed the instructions exactly. 

I know many don't like meatloaf because of how it's prepared but this recipe is OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD!!! They couldn't stop talking about how good it was and now my Dad wants me to make it for him because my Mom won't. LOL. It's going into our rotation of "must have meals".

I think i may jazz it up slightly next time and add just a little big of sausage to it. Could end up greasy, so I'm not sure.

I love meatloaf, and this is one of the best!  I love this recipe because it's so simple. The onion soup adds great flavor and cuts out chopping the onions! This is now the only meatloaf recipe I use. It makes a great meatloaf sandwich the next day, too.

This was a hit with everyone! I must say I did add the topping of 3T ketchup, 1T honey and 1/2t worchestershire. I poured it over the meatloaf halfway through it's bake time. Also, instead of crushed crackers, I used Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs. I had no onion soup mix so I used onion powder along with other seasoning: Cajun seasoning, cumin, parsley, paprika plus a dash of pepper flakes (we like it spicy!). I left the egg out because I was out of them!

I completely agree with "Sharrong" when she mentions not to change the recipe until you tried it as is.  Well I did just that and LOVED IT.  the next time I tried it I didn't have any steak sauce on hand, so I substituted a "creole Dijon " cooking sauce and...yum!  The moral of this story is: super meatloaf recipe that can be modified.

it was good--but my husband said I already made good meatloaf so why  use this recipe ? - I think  if I make again  I would only use half of soup mix -- I use organic lean  ground round-- so very  good quality  meat-- in this recipe  I did not use grated cheese- used  cheez crackers ( prefer  just  plain bread crumbs)  -and 1 egg -- it was  good we ate it - but like hubby says I already had a good  recipe so that tells it all - ha

I was impressed with the flavor, texture & ease of making.  The cheese made me wonder how good it would be.  I used 1/2 ground pork & half ground beef, (1 pound 11 oz total meat) becuz that's what I had in the frig. Didn't change anything else, other than mixing everything all at one time & topping it with a ketchup/brown sugar glaze.  I believe the quality of your meat plays a big part in how good this recipe (and most others) will be.  I used my oven probe to cook to correct temp. Stayed moist and was firm enough to slice easily without falling apart.  I will make this one again!

Outstanding! I have spent many hours toiling over the perfect meatloaf. This one is super easy, super tasty, and the texture and consistency is excellent. I added chili flakes and I glazed it with a catsup, brown sugar and mustard glaze (personal preference) otherwise I made the recipe by the book. It is going to be my go to meatloaf from now on.

I have been trying meatloaf recipes all my married life (44 years) and this is the first time I have actually liked the finished dish.  My objection has always been that you taste either the onions or the peppers or the tomato sauce or the bread binder.  With this recipe, you taste only the meat and maybe the onions but they're so small as to be inconsequential.  I would never have guessed what was in this meatloaf but the result was delicious.  I made it as the recipe directed and only decided that next time I would use a more lean beef and double the recipe.  Hubby said there weren't enough leftovers!

I rarely comment but it's is necessary. This was THE BEST meatloaf I've ever made!!! One rater said that it has the taste of a burger which IS TRUE!! My picky 14 teenager took one bite and said  "Oh yeah!" and  inhaled the rest! Absolutely delicious & heck yeah I'm going to make this again!! No changes are needed!  Thank you so much for sharing!! You really have reinvented the meatloaf!! Wowsers!!!

Hubby and I just finished dinner; this meatloaf was the star.  WE LOVED IT!  We're both "very" senior citizens thus we've had MANY meatloaves in our day - this recipe (I made it as written with the only exception being: 3 T. ketchup, 1 T.honey, ½ t. Worcestershire sauce as a glaze per another review) has become our new family go-to recipe.  Really, really yummy!  Thank you for posting, Connie!

Anyone who is looking for an exceptional meat loaf recipe, look no further. This is by far probably the best and my husband agrees. I would suggest making very little changes to this recipe. Everything blended nicely together and adding the crackers to the mix really gave it that crunchy appeal without making it overpowering. I was very pleased with the results and this will be my go to meat loaf recipe from now on.

We are always looking for a Good Meatloaf recipe and we just found it. Very simple but very tasty. I added a bit of hot sauce because we like a bit of heat, but other than that exact recipe. Thank you for sharing. My first comment on a recipe tells you how long we have been trying to find and make a good Meat Loaf.

i really do like meatloaf but don't make it often. Saw this recipe with all the positive reviews and tried it. It's awesome! Usually need some ketchup or tomato soup on top, but it's not needed here! Very flavorful, easy to make! I actually had a few meals from this and finished all of it! I'll make it again in a heartbeat! Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!

Made as written.   Didn't change anything.  I  liked it but the gang didn't.

It really does need some help.  Too coarse and too bland for them.
I will always rate a recipe as written.

This meatloaf is so flavorful that it doesn't require any changes or a glaze added to amp up flavor.  It's super moist, but still holds together nicely. It's a keeper.

Really easy & delicious. Followed recipe except used cheddar/mozzarella blend for cheese & added ketchup / honey / Worcestershire glaze. Baked 50 minutes & served with mashed potatoes. My kids, 8 & 10, who usually eat Japanese food, loved it.

This is the most delicious meatloaf I have ever had! It was a bit too wet, so I ended up using a whole sleeve of the crackers, and I cooked it in a muffin tin for 30 minutes. Perfection!

Very nice!  I followed the recipe, except for the addition of a half a chopped onion.  I took another user's advice and placed the meatloaf roll on two slices of bread to soak up any grease and removed the bread just before serving the meatloaf. Cook time was 50 minutes 160 degrees.  It turned out perfect! I served with garlic mashed potatoes with butter and cream cheese, homemade cheddar garlic biscuits, and boiled carrots with a honey mustard worcestershire sauce glaze, YUMMY!

Tried this recipe, found it quite greasy I even used extra lean beef. I tried again and omitted  the cheddar cheese, added grated carrot for color and used my finger to poke holes and added blue cheese in the finger holes(about 8)
Hubby thought it was the best meat loaf he has had in a long time.

It was pretty good.  I had all of the ingredients in the house which is why I made it instead of my normal meatloaf.  I would say I used 2 lb of meat since that is what I had thawed.  I did increase the cracker crumbs a little since I had the extra meat.  I will still make my normal meatloaf, but will add this one on occasion too.

Rempel Family Meatloaf Haiku: "texture's the best part. The flavor's just not all there. Needed some more oomph." We were most delighted w/ the perfectly-moist, yet not fall-aparty texture of this meatloaf, which sliced nicely, and translated into a tasty leftover sandwich the next day. That was the recipe's 1st ding against our rating though, the fact that there WERE any leftovers at all. Usually we obliterate an entire meatloaf at one meal, but this one wasn't finished due to it just not being flavorful enough. I followed everything as written, except using Heinz Chili Sauce instead of ketchup, but it's pretty much a more seasoned version of ketchup anyways. I thought for sure w/ the buttery Ritz crackers, the cheese, the packet of onion soup mix, and the hundreds of glowing reviews that we were in for meatloaf-nirvana, but unfortunately, this just wasn't our loaf.

I too have made many meatloafs over the years.  This recipe is a "keeper" for sure.  Thank you for sharing your family favorite.

I rarely leave reviews but this recipe was phenomenal! I followed the other suggestions to cover the meatloaf with ketchup, worcestershire sauce, and honey. I didn't have the dry onion mix so I just added the spices individually. My boyfriend is so picky and rarely likes anything "different" but he loved this! So good!

I never was a meatloaf person until making this! Now it is a family favorite and I make it every time I get a chance. The onion soup mix is a nice alternative for those of us who don't like diced - or any - onions in our food! Thank you for sharing.

I and my family don't really like traditional meatloaf, but our family does like A1 steaksauce so I decided to give it a try.  My teenage daughter was not to happy when I told her what was for dinner.  She took her first bite and said it was good. She hounds me to make it now. My husband likes it also. It would be 5 stars from my daughter but it's still meatloaf to me and I like it but just don't love it like my daughter does.

Holy cow this is UHMAZING! So easy! No chopping, no fancy bread crumbs. Just love it! I made it exactly as listed. Went the full hour in a non stick loaf pan. Perfect.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever tried and tasted (I've tried about 10 different recipes over the years)!  My family absolutely loves it!  It is easy to put together, moist and delicious.  The seasoning is perfect!  The only change I make is adding a glaze of 1/4 cup ketchup, 1 T. steak sauce, 2 T. honey and 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to the top of the meatloaf before cooking. If I use anything less than 96% lean ground beef, I add about 1/4 cup extra crushed Ritz crackers.  Then there is very little oil/fat at the bottom of the pan.

DELICIOUS! AMAZING! I loved this recipe as well as my hubby.  We both had 2.5 pieces it was that good!  Only change made was I used our grocery store (Publix) Meatloaf Blend where instead of pure ground beef it has pork in it as well.  Looking forward to making it again as it will be a new family staple.

Loved it.  Husband said it was a five star meat loaf - and he does not care for meat loaf.  The second time I made it I topped it with a glaze (ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar and brown mustard) after 30 minutes of cooking.  Awesome!  For those who complain that it is too watery, you need to use LEAN ground beef.  (90-95% lean). Thanks!

I always read the tweaks from people to get their ideas as every family is different. When someone I lived with made meatloaf, it was alway wet / soggy on the bottom, tasteless and we didn't like it. Read suggestions to use bread on the bottom of the dish to soak up moisture during cooking which didn't work for some. I was out of bread but had bagles so I used 1 divided in half with the soft side down and it worked perfectly. Soaked up everything and the crust prevented sticking to the bottom of the meatloaf. Cheddar fish crackers because the kids like them rather than the butter crackers and 3/4 bbq sauce 1/4 ketchup again, to give the kids the flavors they like.

This turned out very tasty. I put a glaze topping on it that Connie recommended. I didn't have any honey so I used Peanut Oil. 3T ketchup, 1T Peanut Oil and 1/2t worchestershire. It was very good!

I make this "almost" as is, but will change things depending on the ingredients on hand...for example, it calls for 1.5 pounds of meat...I happened to have 1 lb. beef and 1 lb pork (2 lbs. total), so I mixed them...delicious.  Another time I had saltines and used them in place of butter crackers.  Delicious. It's a basic ratio recipe, and the family (including very picky kids) eat it and go back for seconds, and their friends eat it and approve.  My daughter (16) said "why does everyone complain about meatloaf?  It's  delcious!"  I think it's because many people put in onions, bell pepper, etc. and kids just don't like crunchy mystery chunks in their food.  They will when they get older...but for now, this meal is good and much better than eating something from a fast food joint.  Mine will eat green beans as a side to it.  Anyway, I've made this several times, with slight variations to the amounts, etc...but it comes out great each time.  There are lots of good meatloaf recipes, but this is simple and gets approval from everyone, so it is now my go to recipe.

This is my go to meatloaf recipe.  I use ground turkey instead of beef.  I also omit the dry onion mix and add chopped green bell peppers and onions.  I also mix a little honey and ketchup to make a glaze.  Good stuff!!

Wonderful! My previous attempts at meatloaf have not been successful. This is so good, I will definitely make again.  I made the glaze the other rater suggested, ketchup,  honey and worchestershire.  For a little kick I added 1/2t of hotsauce.

Insanely delicious!  I made these into mini-loaves and baked them in my Nuwave oven.  My husband wasn't such a huge fan, but I don't care; I like them!  Be mindful, though:  they're very rich and heavy, so you'll want something else in your meal to balance it out.  Yum!

Made exactly as written. The loaf stayed together nicely. Pretty darn good. Thanks for sharing! Since my last rating I have made this three times.  I double the recipe to make two. One for my husband the other one for my three kids.  My whole family loves this meatloaf. I make exactly as written.  Yummy, yummy yummy!  Thanks again for sharing!  Try it. It's different.....

I've been making meatloaf for years.  I have a recipe I love, but, I have picky eaters that wouldn't touch meatloaf until I tried this recipe.  Now they actually request it!  I don't make any changes to the recipe.  It is a good recipe as is.

I was asked to make a meatloaf to create meatloaf sandwiches for a function. This is the one I chose and it was a huge hit.  I didn't have enough beef I hand to make the 2 loaves so I substituted ground pork for half the meat. I added the glaze that has been recommended. It was a huge hit.

Delicious.  Used ingredients as indicated, but baked at 350 for 45 minutes then added glaze of  3T ketchup, 1T honey, and 1/2t worchestershire and increased temp to 375 for an additional 15 minutes then under the broiler for 2 minutes.  Meatloaf was completely devoured by my family of 6.

I've never been a fan of meatloaf but my husband loves it so I decided to give it a try. I replaced ketchup with chili sauce. I was really pleased with it. My 12 year old raved about it. I will make it again.

Family favorite.  I don't alter it much except more bread crumbs because we always have more meat.

It's quickly become my family's favorite. I tend to use the ketchup glaze towards the last 30 minutes in the oven. Italian bread crumbs will work in lieu of crackers but following the recipe as is produces fabulous results. I have substituted 3/4lbs of ground beef for ground turkey for a leaner version with the same great flavor. Thank you for this recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was just a little too salty and a little greasy for my taste. It's not the worst recipe I've tried for meatloaf but it's not one of the greatest either.

I made this recipe twice, the first time it was PERFECT!!!!  I used ground chuck...and my 19 month old picky eater granddaughter had TWO SLICES OF THIS!  I must admit I was jealous as my son and husband and son in law said it was the best meatloaf ever...and I thought "mine" was!  Oh well...whatever makes 'em happy and fed!  The second time I did this recipe was a disaster!  I did not use ground chuck and a fattier ground beef (that is what I get for grabbing instead of reading the label for fat content!) and it was sooooo greasy...but it got finished but not with the compliments like before!  So...note to self:  use ground chuck! Thank you for sharing this recipe!  It is a keeper!

Love this recipe! It is a regular staple in my household. We have it a couple times a month. I sometimes use tomato sauce instead of ketchup and I add garlic just because I love garlic.

Made exactly as described, but no one in our family cared for this at all. It just had a weird texture, and not much flavor. We ate a few bites, then went to reheat yesterday's leftovers. Oh, well. I felt it was my civic duty to put in a rating since the reason I tried this was its super high rating.

Excellent! In my version, I skipped the onion soup because I didn't want all the salt. Instead, I added a cup of lightly sauteed chopped onions. Worked fine. I also added about 1/4 c. milk instead of water to moisten the raw loaf. Comfort food at its best.

I didn't enjoy this at all, the Lipton mix gave it a different taste, and perhaps due to the breadcrumbs, it had a funny texture. Will not make again.

Unfortunately none of the family was able to eat this. The grease from the cheese, the crackers, and the extra lean ground beef made this meatloaf a severe disappointment. I will definitely not be using cheese or butter crackers in meatloaf again.

Amazing recipe, it's always a hit whenever it's made. I used 2 lbs of ground pork instead of lean ground beef and added half an onion (minced).

This was amazing.  I used half ground chicken and half ground beef so the mixture was super moist. A few extra crackers and it held together and was so moist and delicious.

I've tried the other highly rated meatloaf recipes on this site, and this is my favorite. I've made it with and without modifications, and it is good either way. My favorite combination is using worcestershire sauce as my steak sauce, and adding the honey/ketchup/worcester glaze recommended by Connie. Then I add some cheese over the top of it. I usually only use 1 lb of hamburger, and it turns out fine without modifying the amount of any of the other ingredients. By far the best meatloaf I have ever tasted, and my husband and kids think so too.

I made this meatloaf for the first time tonight, and my husband and i loved it. I think though next time I'll had a full cup of crushed crackers. The meatloaf fell apart a little when I was putting it on a serving plate. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. The meatloaf has such flavor. I think it's the combination of onion soup, and cheddar cheese. I'll be making the recipe again. I served a salad, and boiled red potatoes with it.

I have tried to make meatloaf many times, and each time my husband and I end up throwing it out. But not this time, the meatloaf was delicious and just the right consistency. Not too wet, not too dry.

This is the best meatloaf recipe I've had in a long, long time!  I took it to work for lunch and shared it with friends and they had to have it as well....

I hate  meatloaf and I liked this recipe.  Made per other reviewers- bread on bottom to soak up grease.  Heinz chili instead of ketchup and glasz for top

Not being a fan of meatloaf, I rarely make the same meatloaf recipe twice. This one, however, will very definitely end my search for a good tasting meatloaf. My husband thought this was exceptional.

This was a perfect meatloaf. Not too dry, not over-seasoned. The whole family loved it and it made great leftovers. I only had 1 pound of lean ground beef so I had to substitute lamb for the rest of the meat but it still had a great flavor. I will use less cheese next time, I think. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.

Delicious!! I made it exactly as written but cooked it as a loaf in the centre of a  11x17 to allow room for the grease to drain away...came out PERFECT! My new go-to recipe.

Just tried this meatloaf last night.  The flavor was good, but because I used ground turkey and lamb instead of beef I think it changed the flavor a bit.
My husband liked it though, as did I.... might try a bit more crackers next time as it was quite moist when I put it in the pans... I doubled the recipe too because I like to be able to use it for leftovers during the week... and we cooked it a bit longer because it was so moist... came out good... we'll do it again!

My "old faithful" recipe is much loved in my family, so imagine my surprise when, with one bite, my bride pronounced this "the best meatloaf ever"! After I tried it myself, I had to agree! It contains several of my favorite ingredients, and the flavors come together perfectly in this recipe. Since it wasn't specified, I used Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce for the steak sauce (my people are from the Gulf Coast!), and 80/20 ground chuck. My old recipe is going into the back of the file tonight! Can't wait for the grandkids to try it.

I think the "secret" ingredient in this is the steak sauce...which I don't llike outside of this recipe.  I make as recipe states most often...once in a while I will steam a red pepper, puree in with an immersion blender, and substitute that for the ketchup...kids don't know...its yummy!

I really HATE meatloaf! But this, I LOVE! You'll probably need to make a topping and when the meatloaf is almost done, I pour off all the grease and add my topping mix. But this meatloaf is GREAT!

I loved this recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe is written and it was superb.  I did not find it too salty at all.  I will say you should be careful about the French Onion soup mix as the recipe calls for 1 ounce and my package was 1.25 ounces.  I just didn't put it all in.  Maybe all of it would have made it too salty.  I did not put a glaze on the top - just some ketchup like i do for all my meatloaves. It was great.  This is definitely my go to meatloaf recipe from now on!

Loved the recipe.  If you think it is too greasy, try using leaner ground beef, or don't bake in a meatloaf pan.  Simply turn out into a 13 x 9 pan, and form a loaf type mound.  Top with ketchup for a nice tasty glaze.  Any grease just drains into the pan, and the loaf is delicious.

For the folks who find regular hamburger too greasy, here in Goldfield and Tonopah, Nv. we have a sale on tri-tip roast about twice a month. The butcher is happy to grind this for us and the meat is so lean you need to oil the pan for burgers. This goes really well in this meatloaf. Also for really good "no grease" tacos. He will also cut the roast into stew meat. You have the added confidence of having all the ground beef coming from one hunk of steer instead of several different animals.

Tried this recipe but eliminated the cheese.  It was delicious and liked by everyone.  The reason I didn't put the cheese in the meatloaf is that I forgot to write it on my grocery list. It was great without it and actually wasn't even missed until much later after dinner.  I also used "meatloaf mix" which my grocery store has pre-packaged using two-thirds ground steak and one-third ground pork.  It was excellent!!

This is the only meatloaf recipe I use now. I double all of the ingredients except for the eggs and soup mix. I use 3 eggs and 1 pkg. of soup mix. This makes 2 nice size meat loaves. Bake side by side in a 9 x 13 pan for 50 minutes. Perfect!

My husband's favorite meal is meatloaf and this is his favorite recipe.  He's not crazy about glaze on top so instead, I put a few slices of bacon on the top of the meatloaf before baking.  I sometimes substitute worcestershire for the steak sauce and saltines instead of buttery round crackers (depending on what I have on hand).

Surprisingly this was very good.  I wasn't sure about a meatloaf without much tomato base to it.  We enjoyed it, had a great flavor and can't wait to have a meatloaf sandwich out of this.  I used the A1 cracked peppercorn steak sauce in this.  We all enjoyed this meatloaf, yet not my all time favorite.

This is a keeper in our family. Be sure to use very lean beef. There is a sauce I saw on here that is a must on top, honey, ketchup and Worcestershire. Very yummy. We use the left overs for meatloaf sandwiches, yum!!!!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever made!  It's great for low carb diets and I also use this recipe to make hamburgers.  I omit the ketchup so the burgers are not too juciy for the BBQ.  The kids and their freinds are always looking to come over for BBQs, hoping that I am making "My Burgers!"

I rarely stray from my own recipe but I had no oats on hand, so I tried this recipe since I had some Ritz in the cupboard.  SOOOOOOO good.  Probably the best meatloaf recipe I've ever tried and I loved that this recipe didn't call for sloppy bbq sauce topped all over the top so it doesn't dry out -- I cooked mine at a higher temp for a shorter period on convection and it was sooooo moist. LOVE IT!

Made exactly as stated other than using 2 lbs of beef because that's how it was packaged. Added a little extra of everything other than the soup mix since there was extra beef and cooked in a 9x9 pan. My husband and I decided this is our go to recipe for meatloaf. I'm not a huge meatloaf fan, but I couldn't stop eating this, didn't even make a topping for it as it just didn't need it. Can't wait to make sandwiches out of the leftovers!

This meatloaf is delicious and different than your standard run-of-the-mill loaf. My husband and I would thoroughly enjoy eating this again. The only reason I did not give it a five star is because hubby dearest prefers loafs with actual onions/mushrooms/peppers in it. This will be a wonderful addition to our regular recipes though.

This recipe was awesome! I have never loved meatloaf but I tried this recipe and was fighting my fiance for seconds. The only difference we did was use Worcestershire instead of steak sauce as that was what we had on hand. Loved it thanks.

We liked it, but like the other one better.  I'd make it again just to break up always having the same one.

I have never been a fan of meatloaf, but I liked this one. Nice and savory! It is also really easy, and we didn't think it was too salty at all. Didn't make a single change.

The only meatloaf my hubby will eat.  He does not like onions, so I used a packet of onion soup mix using only the powder (no dried onions) instead of fresh onion and it had tons of flavor.  Great recipe!

DELICIOUS!!!!! I do not use steak sauce so I substituted Worcestershire sauce. My husband and son had seconds and the leftovers will make great sandwiches.

I do not care for salty food and I do not think this meatloaf was salty at all. The meatloaf produced a lot of liquid/grease but I just drained the liquid. We did not need to add ketchup or anything to make it taste good. Extremely moist. 

Will definitely make again.

Surprisingly flavorful. Kids loved it. I used plain dried onion instead of soup mix, works fine. The glaze that someone suggested (3 T ketchup, 1 T honey, 1/2T worcester) really makes it.

Made this tonight and the only thing I didn't have was the steak sauce because we never use it and I wasn't going to buy it just for this.  Like others, couldn't taste the cheese, so maybe next time more cheese.  My husband thought it was good, he's "eat it again".  It seemed kind of dry but it is probably because I put in too many crackers...didn't measure them exactly.  Thanks for a new recipe for an old standby.

Everytime I make this it gets rave reviews.  The only changes I made was I adjusted the serving to 8 so that I could just use 2lbs of hamburger, since most of the time I use frozen burger.  With that adjustment, use only 1 package of the soup mix, 3 eggs and 2 Tbsp of A1. 

Based on the suggestions from other people, I always put 2 pieces of bread in the bottom of my pan to soak up grease.  I also top the meatloaf with a mixture of  3 Tbsp ketchup, 1 Tbsp honey and 1 tsp worchestershire sauce.

I have changed this to my regular meatloaf recipe now. I don't use the whole envelope of dry onion mix because I'm not a huge fan of onion, but this is very good and stays moist.

Definitely worth a try!  Made recipe as is!  Thank you Connie!

Not only did the house smell great while this was cooking, it tastes delicious as well!  The only issue my family had with this is that there wasn't enough of it.  Next time I will be making a double batch for sure!

Delicous as written, I did add a couple of garlic cloves because we like garlic. My husband would like for me to add a little red pepper next time for a little heat. We loved it and it will become a meal we will make often. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

It is very good. However these raving reviews I didn't understand. If you follow the onion soup recipe for meat loaf, it's not that far off! I followed the recipe exactly. It could use a glaze/sauce but isn't mandatory. But it probably would be better with it.

Meatloaf! Paradise by the Oven's Light! This got gobbled most quickly, lol! The texture was just a bit lacking ... something, I don't know, but I think I did it to myself by crushing the crackers too thoroughly. Next time I might halve the soup and add some minced onions.

I finally registered just to leave a review.  This was very simple and very tasty.  Even my wife who despises meatloaf said it was good (that’s pretty impressive for her).  I’ve been looking for recipes I can make with nice lean meat.  I bought a cheap little meat grinder a few months ago and I have to tell you, you can get it leaner and it always tastes better, the meat is so bright red when you grind it yourself….anyhow, thanks for the recipe, I’ll be using it a lot more!

My husband loves this meatloaf!everytime i make it and he walks through the door after work,he is all smiles! i found that adding one egg instead of two keeps it together better and I also use dry vegetable soup mix and sift the powder out,to keep it less salty.i also use low salt crackers.sorry about my changes,but even without them it was sooo good! Just like variations :)

The best meatloaf I've had and the family agrees. I did add some herbs and some fried onion and garlic, but the basic recipe is fantastic, so moist and tasty. I also used the glazing Connie mentioned; honey, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Mmmmm!

Loved it!  Finally found a meatloaf recipe that works.  I took the advice of some of the others.  I used cheddar crackers and I used Heinz chili sauce.  I also made the glaze for the top.  My husband and my 9 year old son had 2 helpings.

Glorious meatloaf!  The crackers and cheese inside was SUCH a pleasant surprise of deliciousness.  I did a pork and beef combo and it came out moist and EXTREMELY flavorful.  I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was so delicious!  I love trying new meatloaf recipes.  This one was very moist and the cheese gave it such a different, delicious taste.  Instead of the steak sauce though, I did use 2 tablespoons of hickory flavored bar-b-que sauce.  I am positive this meatloaf will be in my oven many more times!  Thanks, Rempel family!!

Excellent! I made it the way it is written and it came out perfect. I have tried many meatloaf recipes and I will never use another one again. Moist and delicious. I think i might omit the cheese next time becuase I am not really sure it needed it. Thanks for sharing!

This was a great spin on traditional meatloaf. The steak sauce added a great flavor. I added 1 tsp. of dried basil, a couple dashes of garlic powder and salt and pepper to create some depth. Overall a great recipe that produces a moist and flavorful meatloaf that my husband loved.

This turned out very beefy..... more like a burger than meatloaf.  Plus you couldnt taste the cheese in it at all.  The soup mix was an interesting twist, but freshly chopped onions always tastes better.

Being from the Midwest, my wife of 41 years and I consider meatloaf a "comfort" food. After trying the Rempel Family Meatloaf, we have a new favorite. I'm retired, but my wife is still teaching; therefore, I try to find new recipes to prepare for supper. When I read the recipe for this meatloaf and some of the rating comments, I went with more cracker crumbs (16 buttery Club crackers) and the glaze described by another chef. Also, I sifted the onion pieces from the soup mix. What a terrific meal! We will definitely add this one to the "Favorites" category!

I am a huge fan of meatloaf and wanted to try a different recipe.  Boy, did I choose the right one!  This was OUTSTANDING!    I made a few changes... I only had Ritz Veggie crackers and used those instead.  YUM!  Plus, I didn't have steak sauce, so I used Maggie's Seasoning.  I probably ate 1/2 of the meatloaf myself.  My 4 year old downed a ton too.  I will be making this going foward from now on.  Soooooooo good!

This was really wonderful!  Really great flavor and moist.  I used 1 lb ground beef and about 1.4 lbs ground pork.  I always make meatloaf with pork and beef.  I just think it makes for a tastier and moister meatloaf.  I added about 1/8 c. more of crushed crackers just so I could use up the package.  Also, I used a Mexican mix of shredded cheese, as that is what I had on hand & I added about a cup total.  All other ingredients I followed to the tee!  I separated mine into 2 loaves.  Froze one and cooked one at 350 for about 20 mins.  I combined 2 T brown sugar with a 1/3 c ketchup and spread this on top of the meatloaf and returned it to the oven for another 10 minutes.  Be warned that ground meats need to reach an internal temp of 165, not 160 as the recipe states. * Update - to regular recipe add 1 large carrot and 1 celery stalk shredded.

This is a great meatloaf probably one of the best meatloafs I've ever had the only thing I did different was I added a red pepper and an onion that I sauteed in olive first let cool off then mixed it in the meat, do not sift out the onion soup mix, it's not salty at all when added to the meatloaf, 5 star rating for sure.

I made the recipe exactly as is with the exception of using BBQ sauce instead of the steak sauce (to make it more kid friendly).  It wasn't bad...but wasn't thrilling either. More bland than I would have liked. And the onion soup mix didn't work so well (I used Lipton's) because the dehydrated onions didn't all get hydrated. Kind of gross to bite into a dehydrated onion.  I did put bread beneath the loaf and it was a wonderful idea for soaking up extra grease.   I'll make this again, but I will add some more zest to it when I do...perhaps I'll try the steak sauce!

This recipe is incredible. It is incredibly flavorful and not goopy at all. I like meatloaf, but I *love* this meatloaf. I made this last week and my husband was almost in tears, he loved it so much. He's specifically requested it again next week. I didn't have any steak sauce on hand, so I just substituted Worcestershire sauce and some grill seasoning. Either way, it is a great addition to my repertoire.

Great recipe!  Very easy to make it your own.  I like to add about half a chopped onion, and usually up the burger to 2 lbs.  Sometimes I use sour cream and worcestershire sauce instead of ketchup and steak sauce.  Also, if you are not getting the right consistency, you may be overworking the hamburger.  Just mix to combine.  The trick with bread on the bottom is a must.  Wonderful!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever tasted! The only substitution I made was using ground turkey instead of ground beef. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out superb! This will make delicious sandwiches tomorrow!! Thanks.

This is a great recipe, and a few small changes can make it even more interesting without extra effort.

Instead of the "buttery round crackers" try the French Onion crackers from the same company, or the cheese buttery round crackers.

Top the meatloaf with leftover smashed up crackers or breadcrumbs for a little more texture.

This recipe also works really well if you substitute ground pork.

Place a couple slices of plain boring bread under the meatloaf in the pan to soak up excess grease.

This was fantastic!  I used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 barbeque sauce and the glaze as suggested by others.  I didn't have any dry onion soup mix on hand and used Montreal steak seasoning instead.  My meat loaf loving husband said it was the best he's ever had.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It was a great flavor but almost a little too rich/salty for my taste. I will definetly try again with a little less onion soup. The way the soup/moisture ended up on top of the mealoaf after cooking was fantastic.

This was the best meatloaf I have ever made! (I was a little worried b/c the last time I attempted to make meatloaf it didn't turn out!) This was a big success & I will def make this again! I did sift the onion soup before mixing into meat mixture. I placed 2 pieces of bread under the meatloaf to soak up the grease, as suggested in previous reviews. I added honey to the glaze. Yumm-oh! :)

I made this today and it fell apart!! It was a bit too much on the moist side and I used the exact ingredient measurements as stated in the recipe.... I did give it 5 Stars for the taste.. very good!   I will make this again but what can I do to prevent it from falling apart? Is it the bread trick?  Thanks!

Absolutely Fabulous! I have tried so many meatloafs, and so many got trashed.... but not this one! The first time I made it, I made NO changes.... the 2nd time, I made a 2 minor changes, by using Heinz 57 for the steak sauce and Smoked Gouda cheese instead of cheddar.... and WOW! It was superb!  You really can't lose with this recipe!

This was great. I substiuted Hot & Spicy  Cheese-its for the crackers, worcesteshire sauce for the steak sauce and I used half the package of the onion soup mix. Ten minutes before it was done, I put some ketchup mixed with brown sugar on the top. Came out perfect.

Delicious, but high in fat/calories.  But, since most meatloaf is, I'd rate this at the top of my meatloaf choices.  Definitely going into my recipe box!

Followed the recipe to a T - hubby (who LOVES meatloaf) really enjoyed it, and myself that isn't so crazy about meatloaf, thought it was decent. It's a keeper.

This is always a hit at my house!  I follow the directions exactly, except for the topping, I add a bit of BBQ sauce (about a tbsp) to the mixture, to add a bit of zing.  Delicious!

Fantastic recipe.  Hate mushy meatloaf, so this was fantastic.  Substituted the steak sauce for Worcestershire per recipe and mixed 1 c. ketchup with 1 Tbsp. worcestershire as glaze for last 10 min. of baking.  Awesome!  Making burgers on onion rolls tonight with leftovers!

I followed the recipe with a few exceptions......I added 1 cup of crushed Ritz instead of 1/2, added ground pepper, left out the cheese, and mixed in a tbsp of worcestershire sauce with eggs, ketchup, and steak sauce. Then after baking, I mixed more ketchup with a tiny bit of steak sauce and poured on top of loaf and baked another 15-20 min at 400 degrees. YUM! Myself, my husband, and even our 9 yr old loved it.

Yummy!!  Very flavorful! Perfect consistency.  Everyone in my family loved it, except my picky son who doesn't like onions... The onion soup mix had chunky onions in it, so maybe find one that doesn't next time...  My husband said it was the best meatloaf he's ever had!  Yeah!

WOW, I thought the meatloaf I usually make was moist... This was unbelievable! I found this recipe when trying to find a different way to make meatloaf without going crazy with the ingredients, like some recipes do. The only things I changed was the amount (I made a 2 1/2 lb meatloaf) and I used Monterey Jack cheese because thats all I had on hand. And the results were amazing. I've never had meatloaf that was as moist as this was! This is going to be the recipe I use from now on- Thanks much!

OMG!!! Amazing, I cannot get over what an delicious meatloaf recipe this is.  We are a family of four, I made a Giangantic meatloaf (2.5 lbs), hoping to have left overs for tomorrow.  NOT!  This meatloaf did not last, my sons and husband loved it.  Connie, you should patent the recipe. The only thing different I did was add a can of Campbell's french onion soup.  I needed to add some liquid to it because of the size of the meatloaf.  I did not need to add salt or any additional seasonings.  Since I almost doubled the amount of beef, I doubled the crackers, 1 cup of cheese (shreded as called in the recipe), 1/2 cup ketchup, and 3 tablespoons steak sauce.  Amazing, my compliments to Mrs. Rempel for this recipe. And most of all, thanks for sharing.

This was my first time making meatloaf. My husband has been trying to get me to make one. Since I get most of my recipes from Allrecipes I figured I could find a good one here. I was not disappointed. This was soooo good!!! The only thing I did was substitute ground turkey for the beef. Thank you Connie for this awesome recipe!! And I didn't find it salty at all when I filtered out the soup...

This was a very tasty meatloaf recipe.  I didn't see the tip about the cheese ritz and the onion flakes, but used regular ritz and the soup mix.  Came out great.  I ended up using a garlic apple cheddar cheese and it really added a nice flavor.  I will definitely use this recipe again, the family loved it!

Fabulous recipe!  My 6yr old had seconds and then couldn't help eating right out of the pan!! Not 5stars because of no glaze topping - used one of the other reviewer's recommendation for a ketchup, honey & worchestire glaze.   We will definitely make this again as a perfect family meal served with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.

Very good! I followed another review  and added sauce to the top,otherwise  followed the recipe. As others said, it was a bit salty, but suited our taste. Everyone had two servings. I will definately make again, this is a great variation to traditional meat loaf.

Delicious! Even my 9 year old ate it and he usually doesn't eat meatloaf, especially with onions. I didn't have steak sauce so I substituted 1T Worcestershire and 1T BBQ sauce. Also made the glaze that was recommended. My husband suggested cooking it 55-60 minutes as the center was a little softer than the rest. Definitely a keeper, will make again and again. Thanks!

Good Recipe. Based on the comments about the meatloaf being too salty and greasy I changed it a bit and it came out pretty good. I used fresh onion instead of soup mix. I also placed three pieces of bread underneath the meatloaf so that it absorbed the grease. I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic and 1/4 c. of fresh chopped fresh parsley.

We really didn't care either way for this meatloaf. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't really that great. I used 2 lbs. of ground meat and though that 2 eggs was too much. I also did what Connie said and used cheese crackers and a cheese blend instead of just cheddar and sifted out the soup mix and left just the onion flakes. My husband and I thought it was just really bland even after heavily seasoning it with cajun seasoning. (I'm from Louisiana, we season everything heavily!) I even used Chipotle flavored cheese crackers. I was really disappointed because I guess I had high expectations, but the flavor just wasn't there. We couldn't even taste the cheese, just seemed like a waste of calories. But oh well :)

I love this recipe...super yummy.  My changes were that I only used 1 pound of lean ground beef and then finely shredded yellow zucchini (squeezed out) to it to make up for the meat. My kids asked what it was and I told them it was shredded cheese (couldnt do that with green though).  also, I used whole wheat Ritz.  Yummy...now my go to meatloaf recipe.

Delish just as written!  I did take the advice of another user and put a couple of slices of bread on the bottom of my pan.  This was perfect for the loaf not to sit in a puddle of grease during baking.  Moist, juicy and very flavorful.  I did shape the loaf a bit instead of completely pressing in the pan.  Thanks Connie!  A keeper!

I thought it was ok, but my son and husband liked it more than the brown sugar meatloaf on this site.  It definitely needs a glaze for more flavor.

I had my doubts about this recipe as I am not a steak sauce fan and neither is my husband. I am so glad that I tried it anyway!! We loved it. I probably added more cheese then the recipe stated because I love cheese, but it was moist and yummy. The only thing I did different was to make a brown sugar/ketchup glaze for the top of the meatloaf and that gave a nice sweet crunch to the savory meat. Definitely will make aghain!!

Yowza is this good. I do NOT like meatloaf and set out to find one that both my husband and I would like (as he is a meatloaf lover.) This is delicious. I've made it several times. It's definitely fun to play with and try new things but the recipe as is tastes amazing. It also makes excellent leftovers. Thanks Connie for making me a meatloaf lover!

I have always hated meatloaf, but I wanted to try one last time just in case. I'm so glad I did, because this was AMAZING. It's now how I cook meatloaf, and I do all sorts of variations suggsted, though the way its written works great.

Very good flavor but seemed to not sit real well.  A little on the rich side.  Next time I won't use the whole package of soup mix.

This was a nice change from standard tomato sauce/ketchup style meatloaf.  I was short on a few ingredients, so had to change the recipe: only used 1 egg, used about 1/3 cup of half ketchup/half tomato sauce mix, added a couple teaspoons of worchesterchire and a dash of liquid smoke (per previous reviewer's suggestion), substituted a generous handful of steak seasoning, onion powder and garlic powder for the onion soup mix, and added about 1/4 cup more crackers.  I put half the meatloaf in the pan, layered 4 slices of pepperjack on top, then added the rest of the meat.  Topped with a tomato sauce/honey/worchesterchire glaze and baked 60 minutes.  The result was a meatloaf that tasted cheesy, slightly spicy, and char broiled, and was more firm than traditional meatloaf.  My husband doesn't like mushy tomato-y meatloaf, so he loved this.  Overall, a great recipe to make as is or play with.  Thanks Rempels!

Flavor was fantastic, but I am still a novice meatloaf maker and cannot figure out why mine won't stick together.

What a simple but great recipe. I did use saltine crackers and worcestshire sauce as that was what I had on hand. Definately a good recipe to keep as the ingredients you usually have on hand. Also a good recipe for a meatloaf without onions!

This was a nice change from my savory meatloaf, really enjoyed the buttery crackers in stead of bread crumbs or saltines which I usually add. Tried the glaze someone suggested, I thought it was very good, but some while they really enjoyed the meat felt it was too sweet, with the glaze. Thanks for posting, next time I will try it without the glaze/

I wish I could give it more stars considering everyone else seemed to have loved this recipe. I guess it just wasn't my taste. I found that I had to cook it much longer than called for and it fell apart very easily. Perhaps I just partial to my mothers recipe, glad I tried it though!

This was very good. It was so moist I couldn't get it out of the pan without it breaking apart! I do like gravy on my meatloaf which didn't go too well with all the cheese in it. I will probably cut back the cheese or use something a little milder next time. But its a keeper!

This meatloaf is the best! I always made a good meatloaf with no real recipe, but one day I came across this and decided to try it. I cover it with a can of tomato soup towards the end of cooking time. It is great!

Very tasty and moist. I shaped the meatloaf into mini loafs instead of putting into the 9x5 pan and it cooked in half the time. Will definitely make this again.

One of the best recipes on this site. My husband said it was better than his moms meatloaf which is a HUGE compliment. I used cheese-its instead of Ritz but other than that I stuck to the recipe. Thank you for posting this meatloaf!

I like this better than regular meatloaf. I didn't have bread crumbs so I used a portion of a package of cornbread mix.  It worked very well. I think this might be even better with some French Fried Onions on top.

We've just finished our supper.  WOW! Husband enjoys many versions of meatloaf and I usually don't care for any of it. We both really, really enjoyed this recipe! This one is a winner and will be the only way I prepare meatloaf in the future.  He's already looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I add a 2 tbsp brown sugar to the mix to make this the PERFECT meatloaf. No icky, sticky ketchup mess needed on the top to make this moist. And the flavor combo is fabulous, especially for the low amount of ingredients. We won't even try another meatloaf recipe anymore. This is the meal my husband wanted before leaving for Kurdistan.

Very good meatloaf. It is a bit different from what most people expect when they think of the traditional meatloaf, buy my boyfriend and really enjoyed it and have added it are rotating menus. I followed the recipe exactly and found it just right. The steak sauce taste is a little strong, but I love that cause I really enjoy my A1 sauce, and I think that is what gives this meatloaf its zing. My only negative is I find that some of the larger bits of the onion in the dried soup mix sometimes don't mix in well and leave a bit of unwanted stringy crunch.

I was looking for a new meatloaf recipe and when I saw all the reviews and how many stars I knew I had to try this.  Honestly, this is one of the best recipes for meatloaf ever!  I agree with another reviewer that said that they only used the onions of the onion soup mix because I did find this to be a tad salty, but, other than that it was amazing!  Great job Connie!

I just tried this recipe tonight and really enjoyed it.  I only had 1.20 pounds ground beef available, but I kept everything else exactly the same. I thought it was excellent.  I didn't see the author's remarks about using cheese flavored ritz crackers and the comments about the soup mix until after (because it was not mentioned in the actual recipe)... but I still felt it was very good. I love salt, so it definitely wasn't too salty for me with the soup mix.  My husband does not like a lot of salt, but he didn't think it was overly salty.  I used regular ritz and thought it still came out really tasty.  I used sharp cheddar cheese...cooked for a full hour.  Made mashed potatoes  and brown gravy and had a wonderful meal!!!  very good recipe and I loved that it was simple and easy to make and I had everything already in my house (a huge bonus when you are strapped for time and need to come up with something asap).  Thanks!

I personally didn't care for the recipe that much on the first day but reheating it the next day it tasted great as a sandwich. My son loved it both days. He shoveled it in like someone might steal it. Kid Approved!

Probably one of the best I've made!  I modified a bit though - I used about half a package of onion soup and I was out of steak sauce so I used a spicy bbq instead.   Delish!!!

This was a wonderful meatloaf!!! The only addition I made was a bar-b-que sauce/ketchup/brown sugar topping.

I was so sick of meatloaf because it was the same old thing. I tried this recipe and the family liked it and I liked it too. It had a different taste to it and I will make this again.

Definately one of the better meatloafs I have ever had.  I am going to keep this one!  I have been getting raved reviews on it.  I am a big fan of glazing as others have said.  I used Earl Campbells Special Sauce.  I suggest something with a little heat.

My fiancee dubbed this "the best meatloaf he has ever had."  I have never seen him get so excited about leftovers!  It gets better each day.  And this is sooo easy to make.  Made a red gravy sauce from FoodNetwork website (sorry!) to go over the meatloaf along with mashed potatoes and green beans.

I have always been looking for a good meatloaf recipe.  I have found it.  This was great.  I added a little more crackers but left all the rest the same. My husband is an Executive Chef and he said it was good.  Then he said it was very very good.  Thank you!

This meatloaf received high ratings, and it sounded delicious with the crackers and cheese (I usually make basic meatloaf with oatmeal, milk, ketchup, and other sauces), but after I took the first bite I felt it was way too salty.  My husband said it was "okay", but we continued to eat it because we didn't want it to go to waste.  I will continue my search for the ultimate meatloaf recipe!

Very tasty meatloaf. I've bene making meatloaf for yesrs & years, but this made for a nice change. I loved the idea of adding the Ritz crackers, and will most likely add more the next time I make this. And if the family has their way, I'll be making my meatloaf based on this recipe from now on lol. I don't much care for steak sauce, but dh loved the extra "oomph" of flavor.

This was very good, a great texture and didn't fall apart like some meatloaves...my husband liked it more than I did, I didn't really like the flavor of the onion soup/steak sauce. Just depends on what your tastes are, but it is a good recipe.

I have always hated meatloaf, but my guy brags about his moms cooking,  especially her meatloaf, so I decided to attempt it for him. In the 3 years I've been cooking for him, this was the first time he's ever said "Just like my mom made!" I'm now a meatloaf fan also, guess I've just never had a good one before. This recipe was perfect as is, I wouldn't alter it a bit. Mashed potatoes with beef gravy and green beans made it a delicious classic home cooked meal!

This recipe is excellent -- but I too altered it a tad. I used worcestershire sauce, and probably about 3 tbsp of it. I used a sharp aged cheddar cheese and layered it throughout the meatloaf instead of mixing it right in. I used about half a pkg of onion soup mix because I only had 1 lb. of meat, and added extra freshly chopped onions. Didn't bake the ketchup into it either. This is our new favorite meatloaf recipe.

This is a great recipe but I did modify a bit.  I use only 1 egg and a sleeve of butter crackers.  I use lipton onion soup but only the flakes -- no powder as it makes it really salty.  I then add a little ketchup during the last 15 min of cooking so it's cooked for about 1 hr.  Perfect every time!!

I really loved the flavor of this meatloaf. I did not have steak sauce in the house, but I'm not a fan of steak sauce so it tasted fine to me. I used ground breast of turkey instead of ground beef. I added a little more cheese, and I squirted a bit of ketchup on top and sprinkled some cheese about 10 minutes before it was done. The fiance loved it, but maybe I'll ease up on the cheese next time! A keeper for my recipe box :-)

This is very good, and different from usual meatloaves (which are not normally a hit in our house). I used 4% fat beef and it worked beautifully. It does remind us of a giant cheeseburger, which is not a bad thing!

This was the best meatloaf I've ever had.  I've made this recipe twice and my kids have eaten it well both times.  My 6 year old actually got a second helping, and my 4 year old that's a very very picky eater ate 1 helping.  My boyfriend loved it as well.  Very good recipe.  Thank-you for posting it!!

Absolutley delicious! My family does NOT like meatloaf, especially my husband, but he and our 6 year old twins cant get enought of this. I make the recipe and then scoop even amounts into a caphalon cupcake pan. This way each mini meatloaf is nice and crispy and we dont all fight over the top. They also take less time to cook this way...about 30 minutes with my speed bake fan on. They LOVE Mommy's "meatloaf cupcakes"! Thanks Connie!

I've made this one twice, with two totally different results. The first time was excellent, the second time not so much. Unless you're absolutely certain you have enough of each spice/sauce, go with a bit more. And use lean ground beef, or the resulting grease will make a less attractive meal.

I haven't made meatloaf in years because my husband and I hate it, but my son asked for it.  I followed the recipe exactly, and we thought it was very good.  I think the onion soup mix mellows out the onion taste, and the steak sauce is a nice touch for extra flavor.  Thank you!

This was good. I overcooked the meatloaf so it came out quite dry but that was my fault.  Still tasty in the end.

I made this recipe exactly s written - even with using cheese Ritz and only the flakes of the onion soup mix. I would give it a 5 for juicyness but for flavor a 3. My husband and I thought it was really bland, nothing to it really. I will stick with my meatloaf recipe. Sorry.

We thought this meatloaf was just okay. It was a nice change, but I think I'll probably stick with the Betty Crocker one. I did make a few changes, but I don't think they would've made that huge of a difference. I used regular bread crumbs instead of crushed crackers, and used Worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce (matter of what I had on hand). It was quite greasy, but the bread trick probably would've helped that.

I had never made meatloaf before and I was nervous because my hubby loves it, and he loved this recipe!  Definitely spray pan before placing meat in.  I didn't think it needed it b/c ground beef is normally pretty greasy...but it does! I will keep this to make again and again!

This was a really good meatloaf!!  I loved that it held together so well and had so much flavor (followed the recipe exactly, except used Saltine crumbs).  It WAS very greasy, but I just removed the whole loaf from the pan right when I pulled it out because the grease had collected in the bottom.  I also made the glaze of ketchup, Worcestershire, and honey mentioned in previous reviews.  Yummy!!    Will make this again!  Thank you!

Wrapped this in bacon, added sliced bread in the bottom to catch grease, and served to my boyfriend (who is the best cook ever). LOVED IT!!!  Thank you so much!

Fabulous meatloaf.  I used pork instead and added finely chopped veggies too.  Had people ask for the recipe.

This was awesome - I made a few adjustments based on what was in the house and really liked it so I'll stick with them next time.  I used 1lb ground beef and 1/2 lbs italian turkey sausage (I had links so just cut off casing and mixed in).  Also substituted worcestershire for the steak sauce and used the glaze another user suggested (ketchup, honey, worcestershire)  Was great that night and even better the next day on a pita with cheese and french's fried onions.  Husband loved it and kids GOBBLED IT UP!

The flavor of this meatloaf was fantastic...just a note for all regarding greasiness/dryness...this is typically due to what type of meat is used and the fat content.  For example, 80% lean ground beef will result in much greasier meatloaf, while 93% lean and above will result in a drier dish.  The amount of fat in meat does provide more flavor, which is something you sacrifice when using extremely lean cuts...hope this helps!

This is an awesome recipe! After reading the reviews and going by my own tastes, I added 2 tablespoons of Worsechester Sauce to keep it a little more moist. I am not a fan of onions so I think I will strain them out of the mix the next time I make it. I also left it in the oven an extra 10 minutes. One piece of advice, for easier cleanup, grease the pan or spray with Pam. My family and friends loved it and it was suggested I make double next time for leftover meatloaf sandwiches the next day.

This is a VERY good recipe for meatloaf.  Very moist and delicious.  However, I found it to be very salty.  The second time I made this, I cut the onion soup mix in half and it seemed just perfect for me.

This meatloaf was really good.  I couldn't give it 5 stars because it wasn't quite as good as the Brown Sugar Meatloaf recipe on here.  But still very good and I would probably make again.

I've got two children ages 2 and 3 and they both loved this recipe. My husband told me not to change a thing about it. I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out great!  The next time I went grocery shopping I stocked up on the dry ingredients so that I would always have them on hand. It's great!!!

This is a great meatloaf recipe! I did not cook it in a loaf pan as I do not like to have my meatloaf sit in it's own grease. I shaped it and cooked it in a 13X9 pan. Everyone loved it.

Really enjoyed this meatloaf and of course I made some changes. I used venison, didn't have any dry onion soup mix but did have some french onion dip and it was wonderful. Nice and moist, made wonderful sandwiches for lunches. I omitted the cheese cause it's not my favorite thing.

Disappointed... :-(   I think it was the texture that I didn't care for. We used the glaze that another member recommended and that was good, but it was probably the best part. I won't be making this again.

I made this recipe with ground turkey.  I used A-1 sauce for the steak sauce and this may have been a bit powerful against the ground turkey.  IF I make again, it will be with the beef as called for, but I think I will try worcestershire for a milder taste. BTW, kids wouldn't touch.

This wasn't our favorite recipe.  A bit on the salty-side, and not enough on the sweet-side, for our meatloaf taste.

I've tried several meatloaf recipes, and this one is a keeper.  Instead of using a loaf pan, I just shaped it into a loaf and baked it on a slotted pan (so the grease could come out).  The meatloaf didn't hold together too well, but maybe that's because of how I baked it.  I used a glaze of 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp mustard powder, and a little nutmeg.  I'll definitely make again!

Brilliant!  Thank you Rempel Family for this delicious recipe!  I used 2.25lbs of beef (change to 9 servings to get correct ingredient ratio) and topped it with the ketchup/honey/worcestershire glaze mentioned by another reviewer.  Delicious!  I wouldn't change a thing!

Delish!I'm not a big meatloaf fan but I wanted something comforting and found this recipe. I didn't have any onion soup mix so I subed onion powder, parsley flakes, and ground celery seed. Instead of making a glaze I wrapped 3 pieces of bacon around the loaf. Will make again.

I hated meatloaf until I tried this recipe!  It's actually very similar to the recipe I use to make hamburger patties.  It's just me and my husband, so I made this recipe "as is" and split it into two loafs (freezing one to cook later).  Perfect portions!  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans (and cottage cheese for DH...it's his way of eating meatloaf...what can I say?)  ;-)

I was so excited about trying this after all the reviews, but ended up being very disappointed.  The meatloaf fell apart and I didn't like the taste at all.  I actually went back to read the reviews again wondering if I missed something.  Oh well.

My son in law, who dislikes meatloaf, is now a fan of this recipe.  It's now one of my daughter's "regulars". My 2 year old granddaughter, who doesn't like meat, loves this! This is the perfect meatloaf.  Don't change a thing. I use Heinz 57 for the steak sauce. I tried A1, since the brand isn't specified, and feel 57 is the way to go.

This was a great spin on meatloaf.  We really enjoyed it, and I loved how it was meatloaf, but it had an edge... it was different.  Really great, easy weeknight recipe.

Very good!  I made it the way Connie Rempel suggested and it turned out perfectly.  My husband loved it also and he normally hates meatloaf.  Also, I glazed the top with tomato sauce and worcetershier sauce.

I have tried a lot of meatloaf recipes and this is one of the best.  Very moist and full of flavor.  I will definately make this again.  Thank you Rempel Family!

We all loved this meatloaf and for me to say ALL is a big deal because I don't like meatloaf but I loved this one!    I used Knorr french onion soup mix, it was 1.5oz and I used it all.  I made the suggested glaze for the top also.  A note about it being "too greasy" you can help avoid this by using good lean ground beef!

Just made this recipe for dinner tonight.  My husband loved it.  Used ritz crackers and the entire packet of onion soup mix.  Followed someones suggestion & put 2 slices of bread underneath to soak up grease.  Worked great.  Thanks for a great recipe

I'd give this meatloaf 10 stars if I could, it was THAT good. I've made several kinds of meatloaf looking for a down-home, southern cooking style meatloaf. THIS is it (ironic since the poster is in Canada!). I found Connie Rempel's review that said not to use the entire packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix, but to sift out the powder and only use the onion bits. And I did do that and then ended up using a smidge of the powder (a tsp or so) because I really like Lipton Onion. It was perfect. Served with a glaze on top (1/2 c ketchup, 1/3 c brown sugar & 1 T lemon juice), plus mashed potatoes and green beans--it's already a huge favorite of this southern family. Thank you, Rempels!

THANK YOU!! After almost 10 years of marriage I finally made a meatloaf my hubby loves. As an added bonus the kids loved it too. I made as directed except topped it with a glaze of ketchup, brown sugar and A1 per some of the reviews I read.

My husband thinks I can cook meatloaf, when it fact it has been this recipe for the last couple of years.  I have tried several things to change the recipe around.  I always throw in some diced red onion, green peppers (occasionally an some aniheim pepper too - very spicy).  I like to mix up some ketchup with some heinz 57 as the ketchup topper of the meatloaf (with some spices of course).  Never have been told that my meatloaf was bad yet!  Recommend with 5 gold stars!!!

yummy... this recipe is so good and the house smells like heaven when you bake it. I serve it with mashed potatoes and a vegetable of choice. I even made a gravy with the drippings. The last time I made it I made them in a large muffin pan. My hubby liked it this way best. he loves the crusty edge all the way around.

It was pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly but it wasn't really what I expected. My husband didn't like it but he doesn't really like meatloaf anyways. I might make it again but not use the onion soup mix and change a few things. Thanks though!

This is a "husband pleaser". The flavors were a little too strong for me, but he thought it was great. I would make this again if he asks, but I prefer less seasoning and more meat flavor myself.

Delicious!  I only used about 1/2 of the onion soup mix (recommended by others) and I formed it into a loaf and baked in on a sheet pan.  Also, I topped it w/ the glaze that Connie recommended(Jan. 9, 2004)- the glaze was great!  Thanks Connie!

Excellent recipe.  I used butter crackers, not cheese crackers and it came out great.  The meatloaf wasn't dry at all.  I also made a glaze that one of the other reviewers mentioned.

Mmmm, so yummy!I'm not a real meatloaf fan, but I LOVED this meatloaf! And my husband ... well lets just say he wanted more meatloaf instead of dessert! He was crazy about it! The only change I made was putting part of the ketchup up on top. Delicious! Thank you for sharing it!

I made this tonight for a family dinner and everybody loved it except for my husband but he hates all meatloaf!  I mixed it up ahead of time in the morning when I had time and then just popped it in the oven later. Rather than ritz crackers I used cheezits and for the last bit of baking I covered the top with a ketchup/steaksauce/tobasco mixture.

This was very good. I don't normally like meatloaf and I did like this recipe. I used bbq sauce instead of ketchup because that's what I had on hand. Other than that, I followed the recipe and definitely will be making it again.

Didn't get rave reviews from hubby, but he did say it tasted really good.  I did give it four stars because he's the one that says meat shouldn't be sweet...what does he know?  I tasted it and thought it was great.  I used Club reduced fat cracker instead of butter flavored.

This wasn't a bad change to regular old meatloaf.  Instead of ketchup, I used KC Masterpiece Honey BBQ sauce.  I also used half Cheez It Cheddar Jack crackers and half Ritz butter rounds.  Lastly, instead of all steak sauce, I used half steak sauce and half Worchestire.  It turned out pretty tasty.  However, next time I will definitely try the honey/BBQ sauce/ketchup topping other reviewers suggested.  I guess I'm just used to a sauce on top of a meatloaf!  I'd make this again.

WOW!  This meatloaf is to die for!  I rarely eat meatloaf but had a craving, and this hit the spot.  I was hesitant about the cheese, but it made the meat moist and flavorful without being like a cheeseburger.  I followed the directions exactly for the meat, glazed with a 3:2 mixture of ketchup and steak sauce, and baked for 60 minutes.

Tasty!  Much less salty (and better) if you don't use most of the powder from the soup mix.  I also use whatever whole grain crackers I have on hand...cheese, plain wheat whatever.  My husband and 5 year old are never thrilled with meatloaf and this one is no exception.  I slip it in every now and again though because I like it.

So yummy! We are having it for dinner again tonight.  I basically stayed with the recipe, but found out too late that I didn't have any steak sauce on hand--oh well it still tasted great.  This is a terrific "sandwich" meatloaf.

THis was pretty good. Did like some of the other suggested I added more crackers, onions, bell pepper. Didn't have steak sauce but did have Heinz 57 and used it.  Thanks for sharing.

Wow, I'm not a meatloaf lover, but had some ground round I needed to use up.  Only because it was ground round did it not stick well together, I should have added one more egg.  Like other reviewers of other meatloaf recipes, I put a slice of bread on the bottom of the pan, before forming the loaf, in an effot to absorb all the unwanted grease.  This recipe was fantastic and I now look forward to making meatloaf more often.  Thanks for sharing a family recipe.

I love this recipe! It's SO good. I'm normally not a meatloaf fan (It's like a burger, for dinner..?) but this one is amazing. I've used turkey instead of beef, and it's SO good. My husband thinks this is better than his Mom's! YAY! Thank you for sharing, it makes my mouth water just thinking of it!

This recipe was good. I made more of the topping and even crushed up fried onions in it and spread it on top of the meatloaf about 15 minutes before it was done! I also used Flipside Cheddar cracker pretzels instead of reg. crackers.

The flavor was very good. I would recommend maybe putting a few slices of bread in the bottom of the pan to soak up grease or use a very lean meat. I wasn't really able to slice it, it pretty much just crumbled.

Excellent recipe- i substituted the steak sauce for worchester sauce and it made it nice and moist. I also took the advice to add bread slices to absorb the grease and it was a hit!

Excellent !  I doubled this recipe and instead of 3 punds of beef I did one pound each of beef, veal and pork. WOW ! great flavor. I also topped it off with cheese on one of the pans to see what would happened, was good. Great comfort food recipe.

So easy, quick, and great tasting. My husband and son (scarfed it up) loved it and ate the entire thing. I didn't have cheddar so I used american cheese and it worked out just fine. I also added a slice of bread soaked in milk to add moisture. Great recipe for a busy day!

This is an excellent recipe.  I used low-fat cheddar cheese nips for the crackers and sifted out the onion soup powder as suggested by the recipe submitter.  I have never ever used a loaf pan to cook my meatloafs.  The thought of the meat sitting in all that grease just grosses me out.  I have always shaped the meatloaf and put it on a jelly roll type sheet pan with a lipped edge and set the meat on foil or parchment paper (easy cleanup).  I prefer the result so much more.  I made a topping out of ketchup, brown sugar and lemon juice and put that on after about 30 min. Oh I did put a bit of worcestershire sauce in the meat mix (my only change to the recipe other than cooking method and topping).  Close to my favorite loaf recipe. The real test will be how tomorrow's meatloaf sandwich tastes.  One of the main reasons I make meatloaf in the first place!

This is my new meatloaf recipe!  I used turkey instead of beef, and I didn't have steak sauce, so I used barbecue as some other reviewers suggested.  It was very good!  Though I did leave it in for an extra ten minutes, I like that crusty top.

My family are all big meat eaters. The more meat the better. I, however, am a little more picky. It must be GOOD. I had no doubt my family would like this recipe but I was surprised at how much I loved it! The meatloaf is very, very moist with a great flavor even though there aren't many "seasonings" in it. I will probably add a little garlic and salt/pepper next time but other than that it's perfect!! All my other meatloaf recipes fell very short - and now they're in the trash! This one is a top five in my house already!! Can't wait to make it again.

I loved it.  She is right-the recipe is very forgiving and easy to adjust to your tastes.  I subbed BBQ sauce instead of steak sauce, subbed cheese crackers for the  butter rounds, added a cup of bread crumbs, 3 oz of finely diced onion, 1 oz fresh diced banana pepper, and then I topped it with American cheese and tomato juice before I baked it.  Everyone here eats at different times so I split it into 3 smaller pans (making it possible to add more onions to the loaf I would later devour with a roomie) and *bonus!* I only had to cook them for 35-40 min to reach the 160 degrees.

This was pretty good.  My picky kids ate every bite.  I used the glaze someone here mentioned - 3 T. ketcup, 1 T. honey and 1/2 t. worcheshire sauce (my kids didn't like it without the glaze). Next time I will double it.  Also, my meatloaf fell apart when I tried to cut it and I thought it could use a bit more flavour.  Next time I will add some Tabasco sauce.  Will make again.

This is pretty good, a little too eggy for me.  I added some green onion in with the ground beef mixture.  When it had 20 minutes left I added a ketchup/vinegar/wing sauce mixture on top for a little tangy spice.  Usually leftover meatloaf sits in my fridge, but we had meatloaf sandwiches for lunch.

Moist and delicious recipe.  My husband prefers very 'dense' meatloaf, so this wasn't for him.  But for me, I thought it was very tasty.

I doubled this recipe to have leftovers for meatloaf sandwiches! Very good recipe exactley as is. I usually use bread crumbs and worchestershire sauce but the crackers and steak sauce were yummy! A bit too salty for my taste but everyone else loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

My family loved this recipe. I used the Glaze another member suggested(doubled it), added 1/2 cup diced bell pepper. Only had "Vegetable" flavored Ritz on hand, and aded 3 links Italian Turkey Sausage. Used "BOLD" A-1 sauce. I used the whole package of soup mix, we didn't find it too salty. It's aforgiving recipe, make to your families taste.

This was a good meatloaf.  My only suggestion is to make sure you crumble the crackers into very fine crumbs - the larger pieces I left while in a hurry became mushy and not-so-appetizing in the finished product!

This was EXCELLENT!  Very easy to make, and it tasted wonderful!  I liked how there wasn't a layer of liquidy grease on top when I took it out of the oven, like I usually have a problem with.  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  Will make again, thanks!

This was okay but not overly impressive.  I think I'm so use to my mom's that all the other meatloafs don't taste right to me.  All in all it was pretty good.

I followed the recipe exactly, and the resulting meatloaf was very moist and tender.  To ensure the best taste, I ground high quality meat in a food processor.  The only complaint I have is that the meatloaf was a tiny bit bland, so I had to serve it smothered in ketchup or gravy.  But other than that, it was my first time making meatloaf, and I'm happy to say that it was a success!

This was great.  I used A1 instead of ketchup (I don't like meatloaf, especially with ketchup.)  I was amazed that I could actually put it in my mouth and it was actually good.  Meatloaf is my husband's favorite, but I hadn't made it in about 5yrs and finally decided to make it for him tonight.  I'm glad I did.  I will be using this recipe again and again.  Thanks!

After trying dozens of meatloaf recipes this is now the only one I use!  I usually use Club cracker because that is what I have on hand, I use about 1/2 of the packet of onion soup mix and line the pan with bread to catch the grease.  For me this had the perfect texture light and just moist enough and crispy on the edges.

I love this recipe!  Tonight when I said I'd make meatloaf, dh asked that I made that "one I made last time".  The only change I made was to use breadcrumbs instead of crackers (I didn't have crackers on hand) and I also added some diced green bell pepper since my whole family loves them.  I use a ketchup/worcestershire sauce glaze that I mix myself.  Instead of one big loaf pan, I make a mini-meatloaf for each family member.  This reduces the cooking time to about 25-30 minutes. The only complaint I have is that for my family - this meatloaf hardly makes 6 servings!

This was fantastic, I cut the recipe down a little but pretty much followed it.  I baked it long enough that it got nice and crispy on the top and sides.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

My husband said best meatloaf ever.  I think I'll try to reduce the salt a little thought next time.  I cooked it in my convection oven without a cover and it came out nice and crispy on the edges.

This recipe made me a star in my house. Great taste and so easy. I added some green onion and a bit more cheese. I also, followed the advise of another member and put bread on the bottom to help with the grease.
Great recipe. Will make again forsure.

Very good will be making this again.  I made a lower fat recipe using 1/2 pound 96% lean ground beef and 1/2 pound ground turkey breast.  Reduced fat crackers, egg beaters and 2% cheese.  And then formed it into loaf and baked on broiling pan to drain the grease. I did use the ketchup, honey glaze. This was much easier than recipe I have been using.  Thanks for great recipe.

First time meatloafer - this was great! I had a generic store brand buttery rounds and they worked fine. I also used a meatloaf meat mix - ground beef, veal, and pork. MUCH more flavor I would imagine than just beef. True meatloaf is made with that combo anyways. Also, I used the cheese from a pizza shred mix from the store - mozzarella, cheddar, parmesan. Worked out great. I dont think it was too salty at all, I used 3/4 of the package of onion mix instead of the full and that did the trick. I think you need the flavor from the powder so I dont suggest removing it unless you're on a low sodium diet.

This is a really good meatloaf.  I have made it several times since finding the recipe.  I do as others have suggested and just use the dried onions from the sifted onion soup mix.  It is a nice change from the tomato based meatloaf I grew up with.  This one is more savory.

This is the first meatloaf I've ever made, and it was awesome! I'm really picky about leftovers, and this heats up great the next day. I usually use a few extra crackers and a little bit extra cheese, and instead of ketchup and steak sauce I just use BBQ sauce. My husband really likes it, and it's one of the few leftovers that actually disappear.

Loved this recipe. I usually make Paula Deen's BBQ meatloaf but this is a nice change.  It helps that it is super easy to make.  I did make the glaze as suggested by others.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

A very good recipe for meatloaf.  My husband and 11 year old son loved it! I only had half the amount of cheddar cheese on hand so I used mozzarella as well.  I also added a touch of worcheshire sauce to the egg mixture.  Great recipe for meatloaf, will use again.  I think next time I will glaze it with some ketchup and brown sugar on top. Thanks!!

This is a good, moist basic meatloaf that my family all ate (a plus).  I added fresh garlic, which I think made it taste all the better.

This was a wonderful meatloaf. I have issues getting mine to actually stick to the loaf shape and this worked great. I did take out the onion mix though b/c my family doesnt like it. But otherwise wonderful!

The taste was good, but the consistancy was off.  Mine fell apart.  I used the suggestion of other reviewers of putting bread in the bottom.  Could that have messed with it?  I felt like there was not enough crackers, or maybe too much ketchup.  The flavor was really good, so I will try it again in the future.  I did not think it was too salty at all.

My husband went nuts over this!!! He is a big fan of the traditional plain meatloaf, but when I saw this, I had to try it. I am a vegetarian-so I did not taste it. I sent at least two servings to work with him & he called less than 2 hours later saying he ate it all!! He even thought about having the rest for breakfast :)

I followed the recipe with just a couple changes suggested by others. I cooked it on two pieces of bread to help with grease. I also got rid of the onion soup and instead used 1/2 package of dry Ranch dressing and 1/2 package of McCormicks Meatloaf seasoning. There were lots of reviews saying it was salty so I used low sodium ritz and it seemed to be perfect. I used 93/7 beef. Next time I want to try 3T ketchup, 1/2T honey and 1t worchestershire for a glaze on top. Thanks for the GREAT recipe--will be making over and over.

Yum!!  
Loved this recipe and so easy. 

I only had 1 Lb. of ground beef, so I added a 1/2 a cup or so of Bread Crumbs, and I didn't have Buttery Round Crackers so I used some Cheese Goldfish crackers.
I cooked it for 50 Min.  

Thanks!

I'm not much of a meatloaf person, but this was pretty good.  I loved the addition of steak sauce, but didn't like the flavor from the onion soup.  It tasted really overpowering.

This is literally the best meatloaf I've ever had!  I have always hated meatloaf and I'm not overexaggerating!  I love cheese so I decided I might like this one!  Everyone I've fixed it for thinks it rocks!  I like to add a can of green chiles, use the glaze from reviewer KINZ (i think) and put bacon on the top.  Thanks for a great recipe, I can finally eat meatloaf!

My husband loves this and wants it once a week now!  The only thing I changed is I use bread crumbs, instead of crackers - just because I happened to have a large can of bread crumbs already in the pantry.

Wonderful recipe!

I am giving this recipe five stars, even though I don't add the cheese.  My whole family (mostly picky) love it!  I do make a couple changes, though.  I substitute ground pork for about 1/2 of the meat, and add the ketchup, honey, and worsteshire glaze before baking.  It is so moist and flavorful!

This was a nice change from my usual meatloaf recipe. I make a meatloaf that has chopped peppers and onions etc. and its hard to get my picky kids to eat it. They loved this and had at least 2 slices each. I will definitely make again!

This was a big hit at my house. The steak sauce gives it such a great flavor! Next time I will use 2 pounds of meat, add a little more cheese (because we can't ever have too much cheese), and increase the ketchup/steak sauce mixture a bit. Delicious!!

i must say, this was the easiest thing i have ever made.  i am new to cooking and following recipes and meatloaf has been far from a favorite in my house, but after my husband had his teeth worked on i had to find something he'd be able to get down without too much chewing... well, he is not only a picky eater but he tends to be brutaly honest almost to a fault and he went absolutely crazy for this from the first bite... at first i was thinking, he must be kidding me, but as he kept eating, i felt like i was reading the reviews over and over again, "omg babe, this is delicious" while inhaling mouthfuls, needless to say, i am making it again tonight... i just wanted to say thanks for the recipe and all of the reviews... awesome!

My husband and kids really enjoy this version of meatloaf.  Instead of topping with ketchup, I've always topped meatloaf with a favorite bbq sauce, gives it a kick.

My family did not care for this.  I found it to be a little too greasy.  I used lean ground beef and a meatloaf pan so the grease can drain away but it still seemed really greasy. I also thought that it was a little too salty.  Sorry, but I would not make this one again.

This was so delicious! I've only made meatloaf 2 times ever and I definitely will be making this one again! My 18 month old son loved it and he's very picky. I did not sift out the powder from the onion soup and I used the glaze of ketchup, honey and worcestershire for the top just to make sure it stayed moist. It baked for an hour and was still really moist. Next time I make this recipe, I will add more cheese and more ritz crackers as you could barely taste them. But it was still great! Thanks Rempels.

This recipe was fantastic!  We made this for dinner at church for about 160 people, and it was a hit!  It is moist and full of flavor.

I have to say this recipe was very good. I made a 4 lb meatloaf and there were no leftovers ( 5 people ). I did follow a few suggestions from other reviewers. I used the 2 complete packs of onion soup mix I did not sift out the powder but remember I made 4 lbs so with this much meat it was not salty at all. I definately lined the pan with bread. It made clean up quick and easy. I also used the glaze of ketchup, honey and wostershire which was a perfect glaze to this meatloaf. Next time I make this recipe, I will use 1 less egg. I found the mixture way too soft and had to add more ritz crackers. Everyone loved this recipe and I WILL do this again. Thanks for this great recipe.

Pretty good recipe. This was my first time making meat loaf and it came out good. I forgot to add the cheese, but I don't think it was lacking anything.

I'm not a meatloaf fan but my family loves it. This was one of my first attempts at "scratch" and it came out great. I added some Montreal steak grill seasoning and put a ketchup, mustard, worcestershire mix on top and put it on top of two bread slices as one reviewer suggested. It did take longer than 45 minutes to cook. I finally  upped the oven temp to 375 and that got it moving along. Good job!

Did not have a problem with it being too dry when in the raw form.  And once it was cooked it fell apart.  Will not use again.

A little bland for my family's taste but a great base to work with. I will try again but add my spices and maybe some bbq sauce on top for a nice glaze.

I made this last night, and it turned out fine, but wasn't anything amazing.  It was a little too moist, so maybe I should have lengthened the cooking time.  I added a glaze to the top per other reviews, which was tasty.  All in all I'd say this was fine, but nothing to die for.

This was a really good meatloaf recipe. It held together well and had a great flavor (vs. that boring lump of meat flavor that many don't like with meatloaf). I added a ketchup & brown sugar combo to the top, which I will probably leave off next time as the BBQ didn't blend well with the flavorful meatloaf.

Wow. Yum. Amazing. This was tender and delicious!  I did put the slice of bread on the bottom of the pan to soak up grease, although I don't think it was necessary.  Maybe people who have more grease in theirs are putting in more cheese than called for? Anyway, I also sifted out the onion soup and just used the flakes from that.  I thought this was just perfect!

I made this recipe last night for my entire family and even my very picky son loved it!
It was a huge hit and very easy to make. I sifted the onion soup as suggested so that it wouldn't come out too salty and it was just perfect!
Thanks for sharing, it's a keeper!!!

This was my first time making meatloaf and it turned out great! I had to make a couple of changes though based on what I had in my kitchen and personal taste preference. First of all, I only used 1 lb. of 93% lean ground beef. With all the fixings, the meatloaf held together and didn't fall apart at all. Also, used a broiler pan so there was no grease on the meatloaf. I prefer japanese bread crumbs (panko) and used that instead of buttered crackers. My family is watching our salt intake, so I left out the onion soup mix and just added some salt, pepper, garlic powder, and dried diced onions. I added about 2 dashes of worchestshire sauce and about 1/2 teaspoon of brown sugar too. Lastly, I made a ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar glaze to top off the meatloaf. With all these changes, my first meatloaf turned out really tasty. We made sandwiches with the leftovers the following day. I'll definitely add some fresh veggies in the mix next time. Thanks for the recipe Rempel Family!

I love this recipe. It makes luscious meatloaf. Is it a bit heavy? Yup.....but use a cooling rack over a cookie sheet and it is a lot lighter.

Let's see...I had mixed reviews on this one.  My soon to be son-in-law and one of my grandkids absolutely loved it.  My husband said it was tasty, but that he preferred my other recipe for meatloaf.  My daughter and I had the same reaction...good, but something in it was...in it too much.  I figured it to be the onion soup mix...too many of the flakes.  I will make again, but add only about half of the soup flavoring mix (I did strain out the soup part as suggested by the author of the recipe).  All in all, it was a nice change for meatloaf.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

This was a pretty good meatloaf.  Very moist and tasty.  Didn't need to add any salt or pepper to the recipe or even after.  Made butter and herb pasta and french green beans with the meal.

This is almost identical to my meatloaf/burger/meatball recipe. The only differance is I dont used steak sauce but BBQ sauce instead and add 1 tsp worchester. I do not add the cheese as its to heavy and not necessary. Also dont add all of the soup powder as it is tooooo salty. This is a great all round recipe.

I really liked this recipe. It was a little oily, but I followed someones tip about placing a slice of bread in the pan to help absorb the grease.

I've never liked meat loaf... This converted me!  I added a bit of garlic, pepper and a couple of dashes of liquid smoke. Lo and behold, I like meatloaf!

This recipe is what I make when I'm trying to get back in my guy's good graces.  It works every time.  I recently took the advice of another reveiwer and put a couple of slices of bread on the bottom.  Great tip.  I also spread half the meatloaf mix in the pan, make a hollow and put a couple of thin slices of cheddar cheese, and cover with the other half of the mix and then spread 1/2 cup of Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce on the top.

I really enjoyed this recipe, and I have never liked a meatloaf in my entire life! It was pretty salty, I think next time I will cut down on the soup mix, but it was still delicious.

My official meat loaf recipe now.  Awesome!  I used bread crumbs instead of crackers, added a splash of hot sauce to the liquids mixture, and put a sauce on top half way through cooking.  (about a tbs and a half of brown sugar and mustard, 3 tbs ketchup)  Be sure to put bread at the bottom of the pan to get the grease.

I made this recipe "as it" but left out the cheese.  Neither me nor my husband are big cheese eaters.  I still thought the recipe turned out really well, except for the grease left in the pan.  I'll try bread in the bottom next time.  Shhh don't tell, but my husband says this meatloaf is better than his mom's!!

Great meatloaf.  I wish I would have made more than just 4 servings so could have leftovers.  I did the glaze that someone recommended in the reviews and added onion and green pepper to it.  My son and husband just kept telling how great it was.

Delicious just how it is -- but I normally add a little Maggi and Worcester sauce to spice it up. Adding fresh bread crumbs is great too -- comes out moist and delicious every time.

This was good.  I think I will use bread crumbs next time because I'm not a fan of using crackers in cooking.  The only crackers I had were 50/50 crackers that my husband gets from the Indian store, which are half regular and half sweet.  So that with the ketchup and steak sauce made this taste like it had a cup of sugar in it and it was just a little too much.  But that is certainly my fault and not the fault of the recipe.  I will try it again soon, maybe this week, with bread crumbs and will make twice the recipe because my family gobbled this up fast.  My kids ate more than they usually do for dinner and my 5 year old daughter actually went back for a 3rd piece.

My husband and I both really liked this meatloaf.  I followed other suggestions and only added 1/2 of the onion soup packet and added a glaze of ketchup, honey and worchestier on the top of the meatloaf.

wow. I have never seen a meatloaf disappear so fast. My room mate had a bad experience with meatloaf, and was convinced it looked and tasted like cat food. She was pleasantly surprised and gobbled down two pieces.

I took the advice of another and baked this on a broiler pan so that the grease would drip down away from the meat.  LOVED that idea- worked great.  I personally liked the meatloaf- very moist, but I did one package of onion soup to 2 lbs of ground beef and still thought it was way to oniony.  My husband hates onions and he had a hard time with this one.  Next time I will use the onion soup mix put sift out half of the onion flakes.  Yummy recipe if you like onion though!

I have tried several meatloaf recipes from this site and in my opinion this one is the best. I followed the recipe, formed into a loaf-shape and cooked on a cookie sheet, the outer part was so nice and slightly crisp. I have really disliked the meatloafs on here with the ketchup/sugar/mustard toppings, none of them have been good. This meatloaf is simple but has a lot of flavor.

This recipe is awesome!  I have avoided making meatloaf for years because of comments like "Let's not have this for a while."  When I made this I did according to the recipe listed.  Everyone one loved it; even my picky 8 year old.  They went looking for the left overs the next day.  Great job Rempel Family!

I have to admit, I think meatloaf is rather boring. But  my husband likes it so I decided to look for a new recipe. i found this, and boy am I ever glad, it is sooooo incredibly tasty. The kids gobbled it, and I didn't even mix it with my mashed potatos, or drown it in gravy. Very good flavor, juicy...just plain yummy. I did however do as others had done, and used only the flakes in the soup mix, so as not to overpower it. It turned out perfect. Guess I'm gonna make meatloaf more often now.

This is great meatloaf! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the modifications I thought it needed. I was worried about this being too salty, and saw the submitter's suggestion in the reviews to just use the flakes of the soup mix, but I love all that soup mix flavor.  I decided to increase the amount of meat to 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground pork.  I used reduced sodium Ritz and increased all the other incredients just a tad to compensate for the increased amount of meat.  To add some zip I used chili sauce instead of ketchup and a Bold and Spicy steak sauce.  Then I baked on a broiler pan, which I always do when making meatloaf to get more of the surface area brown and let the extra fat drip away.  Turned out fantastic, not too salty but with great flavor.  This is definately one of my favorite meatloaves.

Quite good. I usually just use the recipe on the Lipton Onion Soup box, and this is very similar with a couple additions and a change or two.

YUM! The whole family loves this meatloaf. I added lots of veggies to it as well - shredded carrots, chopped onions, chopped green pepper. These veggies made it crumbly, but very tasty. Thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe!

This meatloaf was very flavorful and moist.  I usually end up dousing my meatloaf with ketchup, but this didn't need it.

This was a great meatloaf.  I was so tired of the old breadcrumbs and egg recipe - this was a nice change.  I only put halve a package of the onion soup mix and it was great.  This is a keeper.

I felt this meatloaf lacked flavor and altho I cut back on the dry soup mix we still found it too salty for our tastes. I added a glaze topping just to give it some kind of pizazz. Not a bad meatloaf by any stretch of the imagination, but in the future I'll stick to my usual all natural ingredients. Thank you just the same!

This was really really good.  I made the original recipe, but didn't have any steak sauce so I used worcestshire sauce.  I'll try again just to see with the steak sauce, but I thought it was great the way I made it.  Thanks!

This is an excellent meatloaf.  The onion soup mix makes this awesome! I love salt, so the whole 1 oz. packet was great to me.  Others may want to cut down on the soup mix.  The cheese is great too.  Next time I will put two slices of bacon over the top before cooking.  Perfect recipe!

This was good but now that I have made it once I know what I need to do to make it great. I doubled the recipe but had only package of onion soup mix and I'm glad because the onion flavor was strong as it was.

Next time I will skip the onion soup mix and use some spices instead and add more steak sauce....

Need to reduce the onion soup mix - the flavor was overwhelming.  Also, the texture would be better if you increased the amount of crackers.

Best meatloaf ever.  My husband absolutely loved this also!  I made a double batch and froze half of it.  The only thing I did different was...I put a whole onion in the double batch and one packet onion soup mix.  It was wonderful.

Yum! I saw this recipe when it was the recipe of the day. I made this recipe with the glaze listed in the reviews and it was great. I mixed 1 lb of lean beef, and half of a pound of ground turkey, which did not turn out to look very appealing, but it was still a tasty dinner. Next time I will stick with one kind of ground meat to have a better consistency. The glaze really MADE the whole thing, great suggestion.

This was one of the best meatloaf dinners I have ever served. Very moist and delicious. I actually doubled the recipe (1 lb groud Turkey breast and 1 lb ground beef)so we could have plenty of left-overs - I'm so happy I did!

LOVED this recipe! the onion soup mix really added great flavor to it. I think that next time, I will add more of the steak sauce to it, as i couldnt really taste it in the meatloaf.

This was the best Meatloaf I've ever tasted, I even had the left overs as a snack! I made the glaze to go on it as well that someone else posted but I found it was to much, it was more like a sauce all over it. I will definetly make it again, and only use half the glaze on top and omit the Onion Soup Mix, because I don't like Onions!

This is an excellent recipe, the best meatloaf I have made thus far! I did add the honey, ketchup and Worcestershire. It was great, but not neccessary as this is a fantastic tasting meatloaf on it's own.

I made this last night and my son (aka the meatloaf expert) said it was the best he has ever had!  I used more crackers than the recipe called for - close to double and I added some Worcestershire sauce since I only had a little steak sauce left in the bottle!  Followed everything else as indicated.  This will definitely become a regular meal in our house!

It was a little salty for us but then we really don't use salt when eating or cooking. Next time I think I won't use the whole packet of soup mix and just add some onions.

Pretty good as per my family...(I didnt taste it). I used a little less than 1/2 lb. of lean ground beef, 1 egg, reduced fat townhouse crackers, reduced fat cheddar, and bold and spicy steak sauce. Hubby and kids ate it up. I also drizzled ketchup in a zig zag direction prior to baking. When done, I immediately drained the extra grease from the pan. Served with Easy spicy roasted potaotes from this site and broccoli. Might make again....family really prefers Brownsugar Meatloaf from this site. Thanks.

I loved this recipe.  It has a unique taste to it.  It's definitely a big step up from ordinary meatloaf.  I use Maggi sauce and I do not bother putting in the crackers.  It is truley tasty!

I followed the recipe but I didn't have any cheddar cheese on hand, but I had monteray jack, & colby cheese. It tunred out pretty good. Kids & husband ate it up. My 4 year old had seconds, which never happens.

It did start to look as if it was going to be too moist; but in all fairness, I did not measure exactly one and a half pounds of ground beef. I added some seasoned bread crumbs to it. I also followed another review and made the "glaze". My boyfriend said it was the best meatloaf!!!!! I loved it too.

So easy and so yummy!!!  I use dehydrated onion instead of the onion soup mix, and use ground turkey.  My husband loves this and wants to try making burgers out of it!!

I thought my usual meatloaf recipe was pretty darn good, until I tried this recipe that is. I gotta tell you, we loved this recipe and my hubby even ate the leftovers which he never does! I will be making this again and again!! Thanks for a   delicious recipe Rempel family!!!

My husband liked this. I thought it tasted more like what you would get when grilling a hamburger just baked and without the bun. It didn't taste like what I thought meatloaf tasted like. I think if I make it again I will use the egg mixture as a glaze and not in with the meat. When I was trying to make the 'loaf' it was slipping out of my hands and I had a hard time keeping it together. Overall it was good. Thanks for the other reviews. All were helpful...espcecially putting bread on the bottom to soak up the grease! :)

I didn't have any ketchup on hand, but I happened to have just the right amount of salsa left over... I also added a splash of water to moisten the soup mix (I used a packet of Knorr vegetable soup mix). For the meat I used a mix of veal, pork and beef. Turned out absolutely delicious!

My husband loved this!  I used meatloaf mixture (1/2 pound each of ground veal, pork, and sirloin meat).  I also added chopped onions and peppers (I had red, green, and yellow on hand).  I put bread under the mixture to soak up some of the grease.  Very moist and yummy!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had. I followed the recipe to a T and it came out great! My husband said it was the best meatloaf he had ever had too. I usually use my Mother's recipe but her's is kind of a little of this and a little of that and she doesn't have it written down so I thought I would try this. We both loved my mother's recipe until this. Now I know what it is supposed to taste like. It was so moist! I usually pour a lot of ketchup on, but this didn't need it. Thanks for the best meatloaf recipe ever!

This has got to be the best meatloaf I have ever eaten.  My hubby doesn't care much for meatloaf, and he loved this.  We double the recipe, make two loaves, and have meatloaf subs the next day!  Awesome!

Thanks for a great recipe.  I subbed in water crackers for the ritz, which I didn't have, but it was still great. Wondering if maybe one could just substitute in dried onion for the soup mix and avoid wasting a package? I poured out the grease from the side of the pan before serving, which made it a lot easier to slice (and more appetizing, too).  Loved how quick and easy it was!

We found this to be a very good recipe.  I did add some extra seasonings to punch up the flavor, and next time I make it, I will probably add a ketchup glaze on the top.  Thank you for this versatile recipe.

I usually make the kind of meatloaf that requires a glaze but wanted a change so I tried this recipe.  Followed exactly including sifting the onion soup so only the flakes were used.  It was pretty good but not a five star dish as I think I am used to a glaze with meat loaf.  I cooked it for the full hour, couldn't see this being done in 45 min.  My 14 yr old son loved it but my 12 year old wasn't blown away.  Oh, and no one could tell that there was any cheese in it, they were surprised when I told them!  A very moist meatloaf, definitely not dry.  I am not sure if I will make again as I like the Glazed Meatloaf I on this site a little better.  Thanks for the recipe though!

I have never made meatloaf due to bad memories of our family recipe.  I couldn't stand it!  My husband requested it, and after 10 years of marriage I thought I would give it a try.  This is one of those few meals that goes under *EVERYBODY* liked it!  All three boys and my DH and myself.  I'm making it again after only a week.

This recipe is terrific! My mother (who is an incredible cook in her own right) commented several times at dinner on how good this meatloaf was! This is a real keeper - thanks Rempel family!

My husband and I absolutely loved this meatloaf!!  We used ground moose meat (we're in Alaska!) and it was great. I did use the ketchup topping that one of the other users recommended and I think it may have been a bit bland without it. I will definitely be putting this in the dinner rotation.  Thanks for the great recipe!

One word from my family "Sensational". We have a much loved family recipe that i have used forever, and although they did like the other one better, they loved this one and were quite happy to have this meatloaf once in a while. Very moist and full of yummy flavour. I also did what a couple of other reviewers suggested and added a glaze i made up of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar. Thanks

Admittedly, I am not a huge fan of meatloaf but often find myself preparing it for my husband who LOVES it. I had elk sausage on hand (outdoorsman's wife) so I included some instead of all the beef called for in this recipe. It worked wonderfully. Thank you for this recipe - I will prepare it again for sure!

This is a great recipe for those who like a more savory meatloaf rather than sweet.  My family loved it and asked that I make this recipe from now on.  It also made wonderful sandwiches the next day.  Thanks for sharing it!

This is an excellent recipe.  It is bursting with flavor and very moist. I think the cheese is the secret ingredient meat loaf has been needing.  Definitely a keeper.

I had some sausage I needed to use up so I combined it with the turkey for this recipe.  I also used regular saltines instead of the buttered crackers, the rest of the recipe I followed as is.  This was really good.  Not my favorite, but very good.

This was just slightly different from my mom's recipe...it had cheese in it. And I wasn't too sure about cheese in a meatloaf but really you couldn't tell it was there. All it did was made sure the meatloaf stayed moist. And boy did it! We loved this! Will use again.

I forgot the cheese (ok my man doesn't like cheese) and use an onion dip mix.  My man loved it which is hard to do!!!  But it was good for me but missing something or something wrong.  Maybe it's because I used his Hienze 57 sauce and I never ate steak sauce before.  Will probably make again just because he liked it.

Not a big fan of meatloaf, but this was outstanding. My husband RAVED about how moist and tasty is was. I served it with tomato sauce and put chopped tomatoes and fresh mushrooms on top, the last 15 minutes of cooking. This is a keeper!

Update: I make this all the time and my very picky kids love it and ask for it often. The other night, I made hamburger patties out of it. They were devoured. Great change from the norm and super juicy.

Very tasty!  Thanks for the great recipe! My kids usually don't like meatloaf, but they cleaned their plates!  The only thing I did differently was to put a glaze of ketchup and honey on top.

Very good.  I would definitely make it again.  Although, next time I would reduce the onion soup mix to maybe half the package.  It was a little overpowering to our tastes.  I might increase the steak sauce a bit.

We really liked the flavor of this, but I prefer the texture of fresh onions over the dried soup kind. I liked that it doesn't have a topping, so you can flavor as desired after the fact (most ketchup/brown sugar tops are too sweet for me).

I left out the steak sauce and used saltine crackers instead of Ritz.  I've never used onion soup mix in a meatloaf and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  It made all the difference.  Loved it.  Thank you.

My husband and I went crazy over this recipe.  It was moist and light, not dense and dry like most recipes.  I made some brown gravy using drippings and beef broth which tied the whole dish together.

My kids who HATE meatloaf, love this recipe.  I like others have suggested do put bread in the bottom of the pan to soak up the grease.  Turns out great everytime.

Good Stuff!  I put bacon on the top when I cooked it just to keep in moist!  I also used "spicy" steak sauce by A1.  I didn't use it on purpose just grabbed the wrong one.  Worked out fine.

Myhusband loves meatloaf.  I usually stick to the recipe on the back of the soup box and he loves it, but he raved about this meatloaf.  I substituted barbeque sauce for the steak sauce and it was perfect.

Rempel family, after tasting your meatloaf I may have to move in for a while and see what else you are cooking.  Yum!

Not being a meatloaf fan.... I thought this was fantastic!  I'm not one that likes the ketchup/sugary tops of meatloaf, so this was wonderful!  My neighbors and I love it!  The bread bottom was a great idea and I am glad that I read reviews before making this.  I was also happy that it was so moist!  Great job!

My husband said, "You can make this ANYTIME!"  The only thing I did different was use Worchestire sauce instead of steak sauce, and I cooked it in muffin tins instead of in a loaf.  Cooked all of it and froze the "muffins" we didn't eat.  They were great reheated in the oven another day.  I also made a glaze of ketchup, brown sugar and mustard.  Great recipe!

This is the tastiest meatloaf. The tip of putting slices of bread in the bottom of the pan to absorb the grease worked great.

Our family loves this recipe!  I'm just learning to cook really so I find top-rated recipes and follow them exactly.  That's what I did with this one and now I've been forbidden by my family to change a thing.  This is in our regular rotation. Thanks Rempel family!

If you are looking for recipes, stop here! This meatloaf is so good. I had a recipe from an Italian neighbor and this blows it out of the water. It is so moist and heats up so well the next day. My only suggestion is the cooking time. 350 was much too low. I cooked for an extra 1/2 hour. Mrs. Rempel you will have to share more of your recipes, my husband loves this!

Very good recipe.  Easy to follow with stuff you have on hand.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and added the glaze (2T ketchup, 1T honey and 1t Worchest.)  I used 2 lbs of very lean, organic beef and it was not dry at all.  No leftovers and as my son said "this is one gooood meatloaf."

EXCELLENT!! I added a LAYER OF PUFF PASTRY to the top and it made it even better. I used crushed Cheez-its in place of the butter crackers and added a touch of tabasco. I definitely suggest trying this.

I made this for my husband for dinner, and we both loved it!  I used a steak sauce which had tobasco in it (hubby likes things spicy!), and I had to use tomato paste since we were out of ketchup, but the result was still wonderful!  Terrific when heated up for leftovers, as well - the cheese really adds something to it (I used 1 full cup versus the 3/4 cup as listed).  Will definitely make this again... thanks!

Wow, very good recipe! I wasn't able to find cheese ritz, and substituted a cheddar/monterey jack cheese mix instead. For a nice glaze I took the suggestion of another comment. 1 tbsp. honey, 3 tbsp. ketchup, and 1 tsp. of worschtershire.

I substituted bread crumbs for the crackers.  My husband enjoyed this recipe, however stated it was overall rather bland.  I didn't like this recipe at all.  I didn't like the onion soup flavoring, I much prefer to add fresh chopped onion and bell pepper to my meatloaf.  I felt the addition of steak sauce and cheese did not make up for the lack of spices added.  I had no problems with this being overly greasy because I drain off the grease as it cooks (as I do with all meatloaves).  Overall, the texture and taste left much to be desired and I will only make this again if my husband requests it

It's a great base and doens't need too much more- but it did need a little more. My first mistake was that I just didn't mix it well enough. There were beefy chuncks with no extra flavor and other chuncks with flavor overload. (Obviously this has nothing to do with the recipe- human error) 2nd issue was it was dry. I took it out at 50 minutes. I was a little worried with the grease that was bubbling up, but it was a little too dry. (Ketcup always fixes that!) Anyway- in a perfect world, if I had properly mixed it, my hubby and I wanted to a little extra something. Maybe a few dashes of a dry italian seasonings? But all in all it was good. I loved the cheese in it and the texture. I will modify in the future- but definatley a good working recipe.
Thanks!

I made this recipe as written and it's not only the best meatloaf I'VE ever made, it's the best I've ever had.  Even the 2 lb was eaten so quickly there was barely enough for a coveted meatloaf sandwich the next day. Kudos to the Rempel Family.

So, so good. We had it with breadcrumbs instead of the crackers and used a mushroom "finishing sauce" on top with mashed potatoes. It ended up with a very smooth consistency and great flavor, just like an old restaurant recipe that I used to love

I'm generally not a meatloaf fan, but I read all the reviews and had to try (for my hubby).  It was great.  Many of the reviews suggested going up to 2 lbs of beef, which is what I did and it turned out great.  I even ate leftovers!

Very good.  I didn't have onion soup mix so I used real onion and meat loaf seasoning but it was still really nice.  Crackers made it nice and moist.  Even had meatload sandwiches the next day. :)

This was one of the best meatloaf. The whole family loved it. It was not dry nor greasy and thanks to who said to put two pieces of butter bread on top  to help with the grease it works.

This recipe was delicious.  My husband loved it and said I should always make the meatloaf this way.  The taste of it was great, didn't add more or less of any of the ingredients and it tasted wonderful.  And taste is a big factor to me, it can't taste bland or plain, this meatloaf had flavor.  Excellent recipe.

My meat eating man did not seem thrilled with this recipe - tho he did eat two rather large slabs in one sitting. I, too, had to drain off the grease before slicing (dog loved that in his bowl!), but it cooked up well and seemed moist. Next time, I'm going to try my mother's recipe, and see...

I have never had such a delicious meatloaf! This was beyond my expectations. This dish is very flavorful. Other meatloaves I have made turn out to be bland and boring. Not this one. I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I will change next time will be to use a little less of the soup mix. I'm not a lover of onions.

Fantastic recipe.  Very simple and very moist.  This has become the only meatloaf recipe we use in my house.  As a matter of fact when anyone wants meatloaf now, they ask for Rempel Meatloaf!  HA HA!  Thank you.

Great.  I did have to let the meat set and poor off a little grease, but not too much.  I think perhaps adding some fresh onions would make it even better.

My mom's meatloaf is the best but it's very time-consuming and you have to babysit while it cooks.  This is a wonderful week-night meal!  Easy and quick, plus I had most of the ingredients right in my pantry and freezer.  I didn't change a thing - loved it as is!

This is such a big hit with both the co-workers AND the family! A bit of work with all the ingredients, but so, so worth it! I used the topping/sauce from another recipe, though, and the 'body' of this one. Perfect!

We loved it!  Very moist.  The only changes I made to the recipe was I added a cup of crackers, and a cup of cheddar cheese.  In addition, I added the sliced bread to soak-up the grease as others suggested.

Loved it. My family enjoyed this and the leftovers. Had to drain the grease off, must be my selection of meat I bought. I put a mixture of brown sugar, ketchup and worchestershire sauce on top. Delicious.

This was a great meatloaf. It was moist and flavorful. I used shredded mozzerella instead of cheddar because it was all I had and it worked out well.

I read some of the reviews and really I don't agree that the recipe was too salty... I liked the meatloaf but to me it was kinda bland and extra greasy.  I think I will definitely next time use the bread tip as others have mentioned.  I think it is good and easy but I still like my mom's the best.

Another case of smells great in the oven, but   not so much when you eat it.  It was edible, but won't use this recipe again.  It was very oniony.  If you're not a big onion fan try another  recipe without onion soup mix.

Was it just me or was this very salty?  The only thing I did differently was use less cracker than called for, simply because I didn't have enough.  I did not substitute anything in it's place so I can't figure out why it seemed so salty to me.  Anyhow, it had a good flavor otherwise and I just took each bit with mashed potatoes to even it out.  The kids really enjoyed it too.

Tasted great.  I had to substitute 1/2 c. bread crumbs as another reviewer did, since my husband forgot to buy the buttered crackers, but it still was a great meatloaf.  (I added some chopped up 'real' onions too). Thanks!

I am NOT a meatloaf fan, but this is TOTALLY delicious.  I haven't eaten meatloaf without dipping it in ketchup for YEARS, but this is so moist and delicious that no ketchup is needed.  It's a bit greasy in the pan, but not at all when served.

Good recipe but made exactly like indicated, the dried onion mix is very strong. Mixed with Worstershire, it is too heavy on the spice for my families tastes.  I love a variety of spices and foods and this was too strong even for my palate. If I try again I will use 2# of meat to thin out the heavy spice.

I think this is my first time making meatloaf.  I used a mexican cheese blend and seasoned breadcrumbs because that's what I had on hand.  My husband and I loved this recipe!  It was a little greasy, but not bad.  We will make this again!

I really liked the flavor of this recipe, but it was pretty oily and it didn't stay together very well. We kind of had a "meat pile" although my kids gobbled it up and loved it. Maybe someone knows how to keep it together better? Anyway, great recipe!

We love this recipe, and we're not big meatloaf-lovers. I substituted spicy Cheez-Its for the crackers, and used parmesean for part of the cheese. Very tasty!  I used the whole package of soup mix and it wasn't too salty for us.  It does get greasy, so it's good to drain the meatloaf a few minutes before it's done cooking. I also made a sweet'n'sour glaze off of one of the other recipes on this site, and it was delicious!

I have tried many recipes for meatloaf and this one is definitely the best. Like many others I only used 1/2 package of the onion soup mix and added a bit of garlic.
Next time will add another tablespoon of steak sauce for additional zip.

This recipe was a HUGE hit.  My family was fighting over it.  I reduced the onion soup mix by half and I took the glaze recipe from Glazed Meatloaf recipe.  It was great.  I'm adding this one to my regular recipes.

I have had a difficult time in the past finding a meatloaf recipe that all the members of my family likes. I think I have finally found it, with one slight alteration. I only used half the package of dry onion soup mix. If I had used the entire package, it may have been too salty. The next time I make this I will try using a different type of cheese, just to change it up.

This recipe is so good, I actually got my stubborn (but sweet) 17 yr. old son to eat meatloaf for the first time in his life!  I have several VERY good meatloaf recipes that I've collected over the years, but he won't touch a single one of them.  Granted, he had just come home for dinner after running 7 miles in soccer practice and probably would've eaten anything, but it was still a major breakthrough!  Next time I make this, I will follow the suggestion to go easy on the powder from the onion soup mix, as it was a bit on the salty side, but not overbearing.  Also, I may add a little drizzle of ketchup over the top the last 15 min. of cooking, just because we usually like some sort of gravy or sauce with our meat.  Overall, great recipe!

I heard so many Ohhhh's and Ahhhh's from my family I began to feel like Martha Stewart (not sure if that's good or bad).  This was wonderful.  I made it once using the beef, pork and veal mixture from the supermarket and it was not nearly as good as just plain old ground beef.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

In 30 years I have done a million meatloaves.  I truly love this one with one change, I don't like the flavor from dry onion soup mix so I used real onions.  Meatloaf, mashed potatoes, corn....straight back to my childhood!

I thought this was ok, but not as flavorful as the Kitchen sink Meatloaf recipe on this site which is similar but also has a few other ingredients (maybe when i scaled down the recipe I messed up somewhere and thats how i lost some of the flavor).  Still good though!

I have made this recipe several times.  I'm not a big fan of meatloaf but this is awesome, I find myself craving to fix it now. The only thing I do is also put extra steak sauce in the mixture and put a combination of ketchup and steak sauce mixed together on the top of the meatloaf also. Thank for sharing it great!!!!!

I followed the recipe to a T and it was very good...hubby even said to add it to the meal rotation!  The only thing is I think I'll use only half a packet of the onion soup mix next time...the onion flavor seemed a little strong.  But other than that, great recipe, thanks!

I really like this meatloaf.  Normally I despite meatloaf but I think for me it is the steak sauce that makes all the difference.  It gives this a bit of a zip that ordinary meatloaf just does not have.  DH is thankful for this recipe too, since before I refused to make meatloaf for him.  Thanks!

This was my 1st attempt at meatloaf, my husband is a fan.  He said this is the best he's ever had.  It was pretty greasy w/ the cheese, but just poured out the excess after cooking.  Good and rich with the cheese though.  Oh, didn't have steak sauce, so just substituted with bbq sauce and a dash of worcestershire.  Tasty!

It wasn't awful, but my family wasn't very impressed. Much too salty - and we really missed the vegetables I usually use (this recipe seems to use cheese instead.)

My husband thought this was outstanding, and he hasn't liked any other meatloaf I have ever made.  I made it because the title read, "My husband won't eat any other meat loaf but mine."  Now my husband only likes this recipe! He is a steak fan so this was really a perfect meatloaf for his taste buds. The rest of the family also enjoyed it. Even if you love traditional meat loaf this is worth a try for a nice change of pace. Great job, Connie!

Flavor was good but the cheese made the meat loaf pretty greasy and the onion soup made it a little salty.  Husband loved it though.

I've tried this recipe before but have since made a great revision. I used to use ground turkey, but that honestly takes away so much flavor. I know it's better for me, but I'd rather have tastier meatloaf and just not eat as much of it as often. This time I used a meatloaf mix (1/3 of each: ground beef, ground veal, ground pork) prepared by my grocer. My husband says it's his favorite meal and he never liked meatloaf before! It really is fantastic!

We really enjoyed this meatloaf.  I am not a big fan of glazes on meatloaf, and we love cheese.  So, this really fit the bill.  Another big plus, easy to make.  10 minutes and then plop it into the oven.

Found it average in flavor. Texture wise it was too greasy and I also had a hard time with it falling apart. I wonder if it has to do with the fat content in the beef (but mine was extra lean) or the texture that you crumble the crackers?

A wonderful, flavourful meatloaf, with a deliciously moist texture.  I'm always looking for new appealing ways to use ground beef, and this is one of the better meatloaf recipes I've tried.

I wanted a moist, tasty meatloaf recipe that wasn't too sweet or two hamburger-y... I followed this recipe with one change, I added about a cup and a half of veggies I put through my mini food processor (celery, zucchini, onion, tomato but most veggies would work, I've been doing this for years to meatloaf) The result was amazing!  Not saying anything was wrong with the original recipe, but adding veggies makes it moister and healthier.  Also cooked it in a flat pan vs. a loaf pan and it was just fine! EXCELLENT!

I'm so glad I finally tried this recipe.  I followed the suggstions given by the submitter, and used cheddar Ritz crackers.  I also brushed the top with a little hickory BBQ sauce.  It was a very tasty meatloaf.  I didn't have trouble with it holding together at all.  I did cook it for the full hour.

Made this last night and it was very good.  I didn't realize I was out of cheddar cheese, so I had to substitute with mozzarella, but other than that I followed it to a T.  My only complaint was that it didn't hold up.  I never added the optional water because it was very wet to begin with.  I even let it stand 10-15 minutes before cutting into it and it still fell apart.  Very tasty though!

THE BEST!  It's my oldest daughter's favorite meal! Quick and easy! It may seem as though it will not "stay together"...but I use an oval shaped glass pan and it comes out perfect everytime!

The best meatloaf I've ever had and the only one I'll ever make.  I've never encountered a meatloaf so juicy and flavorful, and neither has anyone I've served it to.

This was pretty good.  I did add oatmeal as the crackers didn't seem to thicken it up enough.  Tasted like it was missing "something" and it did not firm up like I thought it would, and this was after cooking it much longer than the recipe called for.  It was still a nice tasting recipe though. maybe i would cook it a little longer next time & see how it browns up. Thank you Connie!

A little greasy coming right out of the oven, but leftovers are great for cold sandwiches.

I thought it was a great meatloaf, but my boyfriend thought it was too dry. We may try more water next time, but I think it's great!

Delicious! I didn't have any steak sauce so I added garlic, worcestershire sauce, and some extra seasonings.

Different...follwed recipe to a T but didn't seem to wanna "stay together" like mine regular meatlof does. Used Lipton onion soup mix and was way too much onion for my taste....a-1 and ketchup was a little weird.  Think I'll stick with hamburger, onion, egg, bread crumbs.

DELICIOUS!!!!!! I followed the recipe to a T and it was perfect! As I was mixing all of the ingredients together my husband walked by and asked me what I was making because it smelled good, and it wasn't even in the oven yet!! I'm not really a meatloaf person(my mothers gives me nightmares), but I will definitely be making this one again!! THANK YOU REMPEL'S!

Two thumbs up for the Rempels.  Hands down the best meatloaf we have ever had, and we rarely make the same meatloaf twice.  Our search has ended!

Boy I LOVE a good meatloaf, and this is it! Only change I made was to use breadcrumbs because I had no crackers, and I used onion/mushroom soup mix. I also cooked in a stoneware loaf pan, and this was cooked to perfection. Did not dry out as some meatloafs can. Thanks!

4.8.2004- Very good meatloaf, made it exactly the way it is.  Will make again. 10.7.2017 - We were making this meatloaf for a long time until having to go gluten free a few years ago. The recipe is easy to convert by subbing with (1) 1/2 cup GF Bread Crumbs (add some melted butter if desired); (2) Dry Onion Soup Mix: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/217155/dry-onion-soup-mix/, but sub the bouillon with 1 tsp of Vegan and Gluten-Free Broth Powder: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/240511/vegan-and-gluten-free-broth-powder/;  (3) If you can't find or are out of GF steak sauce, use worcestershire sauce. These conversions to make the recipe GF does not alter the taste of the original recipe at all. We're very happy to enjoy this recipe again!

Delicious. I gave my boyfriend quite a scare when I told him I was trying a new meatloaf recipe, but after one bite he declared that this is now THE meatloaf recipe.

Followed some other reccomendations - sifted the onion soup mix so it wouldn't be too salty and added probably half a cup of bread crumbs cause it looked too gooey to me. Also made the glaze out of honey, steak sauce, and ketchup. It turned out fabulous - will definitely keep making this one.

My husband really likes this meatloaf - nice taste and texture he says.  I have made it three times now and each time he says he likes it although he's not typically a meatloaf fan.  
      
I love meatloaf yet this tastes boring and "soggy" to me even though I've tried adding fresh minced onions, onion powder, garlic salt, bbq sauce along with the A1, and a dash of our favorite hot sauce - Ace Bandito.  I think the additions helped but didn't make it GREAT for me.

It's time for me to move on and look for another meatloaf recipe although this is a good standby for the times when I want one I know at least hubby will like.

I used this recipe the first time I made meatloaf..expecting it to be a 'great..i have to use up ground beef, might as well make a meatloaf...yay..:( '  Well, that wasnt the case with this...everybody just raved about it, I made it for 3 dinners in a row!  I used white cheddar...and I also made it about 5 hours ahead of time and put it in the fridge..i think it marinated it!  YUMMY!

This meatloaf is delicious and extremely easy to make. I made it with ground venison because that's all I had in my freezer and it was great. It tasted just as good leftover the next day.

2/7/11.  I've recommended this recipe to friends and family and everyone has told me that it's the best meatloaf recipe they have made.  I agree! 7/16/2010.  Review update.  I first made this meatloaf a few years ago.  Since then, it's become a family favorite.  I make it at least every other week.  I read some of the other reviews before making this dish.  I substituted half lean ground beef and half ground turkey. I used low salt crackers and low fat cheese.  The outcome was a juicy and tasty meat loaf.  Thanks for the recipe Connie. 1/9/2020...The more I make this meatloaf, the more I love it as does my family. Great recipe!

I tried this meatloaf recipe for a "change", but my husband and daughter asked me to please keep making my usual meatloaf.  It was pretty good, but will not make again because my family asked me not to.  It was fun to try something different, though!

As an Atkins dieter, I used shredded carrot for filler instead of the buttery crackers to reduce the carbs. I also cut the onion soup mix to half for the same reason (and as suggested by some reviewers). The carrots were a good option, but my boyfriend rated it "bland." That was a surprise. Next time I'll splurge and use the whole packet. Good, quick comfort food.

Very good meatloaf hubby and kids really liked it even the picky 2 year old.  It was a little on the salty side.  Next time I will use low sodium buttery crackers.  But the family loved it.

I've made this twice so far, both times to rave reviews from my husband and 5 year-old son.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Mine didn't hold together well either time, so I'll just keep practicing until it does - I don't think anyone will mind!  Thanks Connie!

Everyone loved this dish, even those who don't like meatloaf!  I used 2lbs. ground sirloin and it turned out well.  It says add water to the mix if necessary, so I did and then there was too much juice. Next time I won't do that. I will make it again.

I have made this recipe many times over the years, and I've tried some of the most popular suggestions others have made.  This is one recipe that needs no tweaking!  I always return to the original recipe.

I was out of ketchup the last time I made this (I know!  Who runs out of ketchup?) so I substituted chili cocktail sauce.  The flavor was excellent, but apparently it has a higher moisture content than ketchup; the meatloaf didn't firm up like it usually does.  Even so, this is STILL the best recipe I've ever found!

This is a really good meatloaf and easy to make.  My husband and I just recently started eating meat again (after 10 years!) and this was the first meatloaf I made.  If I can make it taste good, anybody can!

This recipe makes super flavorful meatloaf.  I use it all the time and everyone who tries it loves it.  Sometimes I use breadcrumbs instead of crackers, but it's good both ways.

I was a little nervous the first time I made this - I sent it to work with my husband when he a co-workers were taking turns bringing meals in -We had not even tried it out yet......but it was a hit so I gave it a try at home and everyone enjoyed it. I dont even care for meat loaf and I had seconds.  Thanks

Easily the best meatloaf I've had to date.  It was very moist and had a great flavor.  I made it according to the recipe except I did as suggested in another review and sifted and used only the onion flakes from the soup mix.

This meatloaf was really good.  My son didn't care for it (VERY picky eater...only kid i know that doesn't like fries or pizza), but we loved it.  It was very easy to make, but was not bland at all.  I've made it twice in one week!  Glad I chose this recipe.

This was tasty, though a bit too salty.  Strangely, it didn't smell very good when it was reheated!?!  We prefer the brown sugar meatloaf.

This is a great recipe. I alternate this with the "Brown Sugar Meatloaf," they are both so different, I can't decide which one is better, so they tie for favorites in this family.

I have to say this is by far the best meat loaf I have ever tasted!! Kudos to the recipe originator!! It was fast and easy and oh so tasty!! I used ground sirloin, low sodium onion soup and lower fat cheese as we are counting fat grams!! My family loved it.

I have never found a recipe that we liked until this one.  I just kept going back to my tried and true "a little of this & that" which was sometimes good and sometimes not.  It's great to have a recipe that I know will always turn out good!

This was #1 until I made the brown-sugar meatloaf.

This was so good!  I have never liked meatloaf until I made this.  My husband and I both thought it was awesome!  It was easy to make; I added a little garlic powder for extra flavor too.

The family loved it, especially the kids.  My wife swore I could never make a meat loaf better than her mom's.  Well, guess what?  I did and we even had the leftovers for lunch the next day!

I'm sure that this recipe is probably very good and I will try to make it again. But this time I will make sure that I will have all ingredients that I need on hand.  I ran out of the regular ketchup and I had to borrow some of my kids green ketchup, it was the most disgusting thing I have ever made.  I don't know if I couldn't get past the look of it to determine if it tasted good or not.

I made this for my boyfriend who is one of the pickiest and most critical eaters I know.  After the first bite, he looked up at me and said it was positively the best meatloaf he'd ever had.  It is now almost 7 years later, and I make this recipe every time I make meatloaf.

This was tasty, but the onion soup mix was a bit overpowering.  Neither of my children, who are both big meat eaters, cared for this dish.  The adults however, did.  I am glad I tried the recipe, as it was moist and flavorful, but I think I will stick with my current recipe for meat loaf.

Full of flavor and easy to make.  My husband said this tastes different from any meat loaf he has had before, but was ok with it.  He's not a big fan of meat loaf in general, but I am and I loved it!

This meatloaf recipes has got to be the best I've ever eaten. My husband and I are usually "ketchup drowners" when it comes to meatloaf - but this one, we don't even touch the bottle once we serve it!  Goes wonderful with mashed potatoes, brown gravy and green beans.  A keeper for sure!

Delicious.  My husband and kids loved it.  Made great sandwiches.  I used a mixture of beef, pork and veal.
