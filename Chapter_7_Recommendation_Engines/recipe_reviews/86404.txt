I followed this recipe exactly as stated and then added the following:  Before dressing: bamboo shoots, dried cranberries and scallions.  After mixing everything with the dressing, I topped it with the fried rice noodles you get in a can.  This was so tasty and a great way to get your greens and also use up any extra chicken. We'll make it again.

OMG! I just made this, I mean I am eating it as I type this. It tastes just like Chinese should taste like. It was so simple and I had all of the ingredients in my cabinet. I follwed the recipe exactly except for the cilantro, I used green onion instead. My four year old is even eating it!!!!!

This recipe nailed it.  It's exactly how I expect Chinese chicken salad to taste.  I left out the cilantro (I'm allergic) and used slightly less soy sauce.  I'm so thrilled not to have to buy those overpriced salad mix bags anymore!

Absolutely delicious!  I used shredded rotisserie chicken, and low-sodium soy sauce, and omitted the cilantro.  I also added some mandarin oranges and topped it with some toasted slivered almonds.  As the name says, it's quick, and it's oh so good!

Pretty darn good overall. The cilantro made such a difference in this salad.  It was great. Even so, it felt like it needed a little bit of something else, so we added mandarin oranges, but it still needed something...maybe craisins or something like that.

This was delicious! I changed the dressing to 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, and I seasoned the chicken with a seasoning before I roasted it. Used a mixture of lettuce, cucumber, and tomato along with the cilantro. Can't wait to make this again!

This salad was great!  It tasted just like a chinese salad out of a restaurant!  To add a little bit of flair, I bought fried wonton strips from a local Chinese restaurant.  It received raved reviews.

Pretty good stuff! My bag of salad was 10 oz- but I left the dressing amounts the same- maybe I shouldn't have! I used pre-cooked grilled chicken strips from Costco- very good. This has a strong soy flavor, but maybe because I didn't use enough salad! Definitely don't toss the salad with the dressing unless all will be eaten immediately. Otherwise, keep them separate to serve individually. This was good for my low carb diet.(used Splenda)

Very tasty, like salad at a good Chinese restaurant!   I didn't use chicken.  Tips:  Definitely do not refrigerate, only tastes good fresh;
Do mix dressing so sugar will be disbursed; 
Use lots of cilantro;

The only alteration we did was to substitute the field greens with shredded cabbage. It turned out great! Everyone loved it. I suspect it would be just as good with field greens and next time I make it I may try that.

This tastes great -- as others have said it tastes like what you might get in a restaurant.  I added canned mandarin oranges, chow mein noodles, and dry roasted peanuts.  The chow mein noodles especially gave it a bit of added interest and crunch.  I served it along with potstickers from the frozen section, and a few california rolls from the grocery deli.  Together it made a pretty and yummy meal.

This was okay...The dressing was a bit too salty for our tastes...My suggestion would be to maybe start out with 1-1 1/2 TBS of soy sauce and taste it first...add more if needed..I should have done that :(

My family, including two large teenage sons, loved this.  We followed exactly except we left out the cilantro and added chow mein noodles for some crunch.  It was fabulous and so easy!

My hubby loves this and always orders it when we go out.  After reading the reviews I understand, like "dah" what I was doing wrong when I made it for him & why he doesn't like mine.
I like a substantial meal. A solid salad, if it is going to be a meal.
I sneak in every available, appropriate ingredient I have on hand, and I have lots of ingredients in my pantry.
What I got is that this salad is simple, light & has the only ingredient I never have on hand--cilantro.
I didn't love it at all...but my husband, really, really did..
Thanks for letting me see this salad is not for me, and can be enjoyed

fabulously delicious and easy.  if you're looking for something quick and healthy I recommend this recipe.  The only thing I did was cut the soy down to 2 tablespoons, used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I added a little plum sauce to give it that oriental kick.  tossed and served.

Ease up on the soy, and add peanuts or cashews, plus broken dry ramen noodles and diced onions. Yum!

The dressing is great. I always make a double batch and refrigerate the left overs. I also use it as a dipping sauce for pot stickers.

To me, Chinese chicken salad is all about the dressing, and this was ok, but not as full-flavored as I had hoped.  My goal was something like Soy Vey's Sesame Chicken Salad Dressing and this had a thinner more vinegary taste.   I used unseasoned rice wine vinegar and will try in the future with seasoned vinegar.

Excellent as is. Here are a few suggestions for a more authentic Asian salad. Instead of lettuce use a Cole crop like Chinese cabbage, Napa cabbage, kale, or bok choi, sliced into 3/8 inch strips. These will give more flavor and crunch.  I also grate in about a teaspoon of fresh ginger.  I agree with halving the soy sauce, which can be overpowering.
