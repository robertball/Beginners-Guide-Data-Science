These are great!  I decided to add heath toffee bits so I decreased the amount of of chocolate chips to a 1 1/2 C and decreased the brown sugar to 1 C.  The toasted coconut and pecans are incredible in this cookie. The milk chocolate toffee bits add another crunch to this great recipe.  These are so good.  I baked mine for 11-12 minutes.  They will not be done looking but they will turn out perfect.  The cookie will be chewy in the middle.  I think we have found a new favorite! I didn't quite have enough oats, so I increased the flour to make up for it.  This cookie turned out wonderful.  I think you would have a hard time finding a better cookie in a bakery!

Holy buttery, peacany, brown sugary goodness!  My husband and I both loved these.  Made exactly as the recipe stated.  Toasting the coconut is a great idea.  They were nice plump chewy delicious cookies.  They are definitely going in the cookie rotation in our house.  No changes necessary.

delicious! I love the texture in these cookies. Be sure not to overbake them. Remove them from the oven when still slightly soft. Let cool on pan about a minute, then remove.

Yum!!! This delicious oatmeal, chocolate chip, toasted coconut and pecan cookie recipe is a winner.  The toasted coconuts and pecans give it a wonderful nutty flavor.  I followed the recipe with a couple of suggestions by reviewers.  First, since I used sweetened coconut, semi sweet chocolate chips, and added toffee chips, I reduced the brown sugar to 1 cup and white sugar to 1/4.  It was still plenty sweet.  Also, since I added the toffee chips I reduced the chocolate chips to 1 cup and there was still lots of chocolatey flavor.   Lastly, I checked the cookies after 8 or 9 minutes and they were done.    They were, as another reviewer described, crispy on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside.  Also, it made probably more like 48 cookies for me instead of 36.  My family loved these cookies and specifically requested them for Thanksgiving.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Chewy, warm, chocolate and coconut goodness! I made four dozen cookies using this recipe and they were tasty hot out of the oven and after they cooled. I increased the baking time by one minute because they were so soft that they would fall apart when I tried to put them on the cooling racks. I will be making these again!

These are a hit in our family.  Exceptional taste and crunch.  Everyone raves and most request the recipe.  I make these frequently.  I substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of regular flour. It's a keeper.

Great cookies especially on a rainy Saturday! I used 1/2 c. whole wheat flour and the rest regular flour and added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and dark chocolate chips. Had plenty of flavor and sweetness to me. My butter wasn't quite soft enough so I nuked it just a little bit which made the cookies come out flatter. I think it made them have the texture of a lace cookie  a little bit. But they were still chewy and delicious.

Good cookies!  I did have to increase the flour about 1/4-1/2 more.  The first batch I cooked we flat and crunchy, but once I added the flour, they came out soft and chewy.  Next time I may add some toffee chips, as one reviewer suggested.  A simple recipe to add to!

Well, I can certainly see what all the hullabaloo is about!! These are great.  Used chopped mixed nuts (to get rid of them) in place of pecans and it was great.  Also, 1 cup of each sugar.  Cooked 11 minutes at 325 in convection oven and they are perfect.

I made this exactly according to recipe!! My entire family about devours the entire batch as they come out of the oven. There is nothing not to love about this cookie. Chocolate, coconut, nuts, and oats all in one delicious cookie. I make an extra batch and make into 2 rolls and freeze. Next time I want cookies I just take out a roll, cut off some cookies and bake. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Thank you for this recipe.  I made nearly a dozen different types of cookies today for holiday gift giving.  This one is my new favorite.  It leaves regular chocolate chip cookies in the dust.

Wonderful! Chewy on the inside, crisp on the outside. I had to make a few changes due to ingredients on hand. I substituted 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour for the 2 cups of flour, 3 eggs (mine were on the small side from my hens), and I had no vanilla extract so I used a teaspoon of almond extract. I didn't have white sugar, and replaced it with sugar in the raw. I had no pecans, but toasted extra coconut. The coconut that I had on hand was unsweetened. These turned out AMAZING! I just wanted to let people who like to use whole wheat flour that they came out great!

Made these for a friend's birthday in February and have had to make them once a month since-- they are amazing. Such simple treats, but with a great, complex flavor. You will not be able to eat just one! Follow the recipe exactly-- maybe add some ground flax meal to up the health of them-- and then enjoy ravenously!

Excellent cookie recipe. The only change I made was switching walnuts for the pecans since we don't care for pecans.I think next time I will try adding some raisins or dried cranberries.

Great recipe. I didn't have enough oats so I only used 1 and a half cups, plus extra coconut, and it was perfect.  Very yummy.

These are the most addictive cookies I have ever made!  I make the full batch and freeze the batter in the shape of a log. Simply cut off as many cookies that you want to bake at a time.

I adjusted the recipe to accommodate our new healthful foods. I used all purpose spelt flour, 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil and coconut sugar in place of other sugars and quail eggs.

These are AMAZING! Make sure and use a stand mixer because it seems it would be impossible to hand mix all of these delicious ingredients together! I followed the recipe exactly but added around a 1/3 of a cup of Toffee bits!

Fantastic cookies and so easy to make!  Love them as written.  My 16 year old football lineman son calls them the perfect cookie and he's judged quite a few. lol!

These are like the chocolate-chip-cookie version of an everything bagel.  All of the flavors (except the chocolate) sort of meld together into a chewy, crunchy whole.  I added a half-cup or so of leftover Heath bar bits, because why not, and rolled the cookies into golf-ball-sized balls before baking.  I also added an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar because I was short that much white.  All in all, very tasty, and substantial enough that you're not so tempted to eat six at a time!

These are a staple now where I bake - but as written the dough comes out a little dry.  I cut back on the flour and oatmeal just a bit and underbake it slightly to get it how I like it.

Made these today with only one change. I decreased the brown sugar to 1 cup. I baked them for 12 minutes. They were absolutely devine!
