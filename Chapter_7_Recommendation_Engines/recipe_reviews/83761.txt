This made a delicious meal!  However, I had issues with the recipe.  First, it took the lentils 1 1/2 hours to cook. Second, the description says "red lentil sauce;" instead it's just a layer of lentils. Also, it made way too much for one pizza crust.  Ate with knife and fork and it was very messy.  I would make this again, but the recipe is a bit misleading.

I was looking up different ways to use up my lentils without resorting to soup again.  This pizza is actually pretty tasty AFTER changing the recipe a bit.  Lentils take twice as long to cook.  I mixed the lentils with the other stuff cause the layer seemed pointless.  Also I HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting TWO pizza crusts... way too much stuff for one.

Has more fiber in it than any human would ever need; pretty tasty, but sits in the stomach like a ton of bricks.

Unusual and wonderful! I loved that it was vegetarian but my family is full of carnivores so I added some cubed left over chicken. I could eat the topping just on its own without the crust, it's just wonderful

one of the best recipes we've ever made!  we were making this vegan and couldn't find a ready-made crust that was vegan so we substituted wheat pita bread and decreased the cooking time.  came out wonderfully.  takes a little work but absolutely worth it.

I think there is a mistake in the directions. The submitter states that she uses a "curried red lentil sauce" in place of tomato sauce but the directions call for it all to be stirred in together. I came up with nothing but mush. It still tasted good but the texture was a bit off-putting.  Next time, I'll try frying up the onions, garlic, spices (which is more traditional Indian style) and add the lentils to that. Then make the sweet potato/eggplant mixture on it's own.

Interesting way to use the ingredients in a pizza.  I would make this again, but change a few things as I found it to be a bit bland and I had to add a lot of salt to it.  Next time I would use a few different types of cheese and use more than the recipe called for.

Excellent pizza! I did everything pretty much as explained in the recipe, except I used mozzarella and goat cheese to give it a little kick. I also used whole wheat pita bread instead of pizza crust. It makes really good individual pizzas and everyone can modify it to their liking. To use pitas, cook 10 minutes on a pan and then an additional 3-5 minutes directly on the rack to make it a little more crispy. Goat cheese works really well with this pizza!

I was very skeptical about this pizza, but it turned out great!  The lentils were very mushy, so I just mixed them in with the veggies.  I used yams instead of sweet potatoes and added a bit of nutmeg.  I also added more cheese than it called for and also topped it off with some longhorn goat cheese.  Will definitely be making this again.

I'm sorry but this was just awful. I like all of the ingredients (eggplant, sweet potato, lentils) which is why I tried it, but I guess the combination just doesn't work on a pizza.

I'm rather new to being a vegetarian and to cooking in general, but I found this recipe easy and delicious!!!  I substituted diced tomatoes and some balsamic vinaigrette and it was one of the best meals I've ever had.  I tried it on mini pita pizza crusts and it was good and I ate the leftovers without the bread which was also good.

I spread the mixture over the equivalent of 2 crusts as others have sggested.  I used extra sweet potatoes to replace the omitted eggplant. A 1/2 lb. of  mozzarella cheese replaced the romano cheese called for.  We loved the spices!  This is a great pizza!

This was very interesting!  I liked it, even though the flavors were quite unusual for pizza.  The Romano cheese I got was a bit stinky, and I almost liked it better under the cheese.  If you have sweet potato and eggplant to use up, I would recommend trying this at least once.

Great idea but needs tinkering. Swap the cumin and curry powder measurements, use cumin seed instead of powder, add them to the oil rather than what's already in the pan. Needs cilantro.  I added a bit of dark brown sugar; would've used golden raisins instead but was out, and used chana (split chickpea) dal because it's what I had on hand.  And it certainly needs a substantial crust. 

This would be great as a sauce to a hearty homemade pasta (orechiette, say) if you skipped the lentils and used cooked ceci (chick peas) instead.
