Wow! These were the BEST turkey burgers I've ever had. To be honest, I was iffy about using a recipe that was new and didn't have a picture but I'm glad I did. I already had all of the ingedients in bulk (and thanks to Costco, it's actually fairly inexpensive for ingredients like Pesto and Feta cheese). I don't have an outdoor grill, but I baked them at about 400 for 10 minutes and then broiled them until they were browned (about 8 minutes). I toasted the buns and topped it with a sauce that I make which is equal parts mayo and dijon mustard mixed with about a teaspoon of fresh garlic and a dash of crushed red pepper. These are the best burgers I've ever had. Thank you SO much for this recipe!

This recipe deserves 5 stars prepared as directed, but I made some changes when I cooked it for friends.  This is my best reviewed food item. I replace a little more than half the bread crumbs with Italian bread crumbs. I use a little less feta. I don't add the extra salt while cooking. And the two things I force on anyone eating this are: 1) Must use english muffins for bread 2) Must top with chopped dried cranberries. This is easily my favorite turkey burger, and some of my friends prefer this recipe to beef.

These burgers were great with some adjustments.  First I didn't use the feta. I know the recipe said Mediterranean-Style burger.  I make Mediterranean burgers.  They are made with feta cheese, olives, and tzatziki sauce. These are Pesto burgers.  After they were done, I put on Provolone cheese and smeared pesto on a toasted bun. Garnished with boston lettuce and tomatoes.  Wonderful.

I use ground turkey all the time as it is healthier (and cheaper) than ground beef. I am always looking for something different, and I was excited to try this recipe. I buy turkey in 1 lb packages, so that's how much I used.  Also, I was out of gas for my grill so I had to cook them on the stove top. I didn't have any problems cooking them. However, the end result was a little disappointing. I thought there was too much pesto. I will only use 1 tbsp next time. I really like this flavor, but it was overwhelming. My husband thought they were too salty, so I will also cut back on the seasoned salt next time as well. I didn't add the additional on top, so I will probably only use t tsp total. I also wanted more cheese, so next time I will probably add 3/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup. With those modifications I think they will be a lot better!

Yum!  I read all of the previous reviews and came up with my on little version of these burgers, and they were quite tasty.  I mixed 1 T of pesto, a few shakes of garlic powder and about 3 T of diced red onion to the turkey.  It made four burgers that I broiled about six minutes on each side.  I ate this turkey burger on a whole wheat bun with just a tiny bit of mayonnaise, mustard and ketchup in addition to a large leaf of Romaine lettuce, a slice of red onion and a few small banana peppers.  Next time I'll be sure to have some slices of cheddar cheese on hand to melt on top.  I served the burgers with a baked bean dish.  So tasty!  Thank you!

My husband and I thought these were very good, a nice change from regular beef burgers.  Moist and flavorful.  I used some of the pesto I had and added it to some mayo with a little garlic.  It made a nice spread and gave the burgers an extra zip.  The recipe as written deserves five stars.

Very good burger. With the turkey it is lighter than beef and the pesto adds a great little extra flavor.  We're definately going to have these again!

These are the best turkey burgers I've ever had! I've made them exactly as the recipe states, and I've made them with a few changes. You're going to have some difficulty keeping the patties intact due to the lack of fat, but a couple things seem to help. I add an egg to the mixture and freeze the formed patties for about a half hour. I also like to add a little parmesan cheese. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  I cut down the seasoned salt because of other reviews but not next time.  Also I could not taste the feta so I may double that when I make them again.  I used Panko bread crumbs and let the mixture sit about 30 minutes before baking to let everything "meld".   I baked on a sheet pan for about 20 minutes at 375 then broiled for about 5 minutes.  I had no problem with them falling apart.  Served on Honey-Oat Pan Rolls (recipe from this site).

These were pretty tasty, but I didn't like the texture of the meat with the breadcrumbs. I'd probably try an egg instead, or else less breadcrumbs. (It probably didn't help either that I had mixed panko in with my reg breadcrumbs and that was all I had.) I did not add the stated amount of salt in the burger nor on top, but I think it would be more flavorful to only sprinkle it on top. That's what we do with hamburgers and they're always fabulous. My kids loved these as well, thank you!

I love making homemade burgers and rarely do beef.  I have tried many different recipes - this one is fantastic!  I chose it as I had some homemade pesto in my fridge to use - my pesto actually had some sun-dried tomatoes in it too - SO YUMMY!  I left out the seasoned salt and had to sub in oats as I was out my panko crumbs.  Repeat for sure, so good!

I'm not a fan of people making several changes and then reviewing a recipe so I made this exactly as stated... and they were delicious!  Even my beef-loving husband liked them.  With that being said, next time I will make a change or two by adding a chunk of fontina inside (I love cheese!) and also use less salt.  Very good recipe, thanks!

As always, I rate a recipe as presented. I thought these were great burgers, but I would use less salt next time. I served them on whole wheat hamburger buns, but they needed something else and I couldn't think what. Now that I've read other comments I know that next time I'll serve them with mozzarella cheese, additional pesto, lettuce and tomato.

Fabulous recipe.  I am on low carb diet and usually turkey is just so bland and tasteless.  I love pesto sauce and googled a recipe before trying to make up my own! Low fat pesto is also low in carbs, 4.0 per 100g.   Anyway, I didn't have feta (although I will try it) so I used Philly cream cheese, and omitted the breadcrumbs. I also put in a chopped spring onion.  I didn't need an egg as the cheese was wet.  It was gorgeous served with a green salad.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm not a fan of ground turkey in anything other than chili, but these were great and extremely easy!  I scaled back the salt and only had Italian breadcrumbs on hand.  Perfect with a slice of tomato on a toasted whole wheat roll, although I would have still enjoyed it without a bun.

I've been making this for the last couple of years and it's a family favorite. I make up a big batch and freeze some, then thaw and cook. I sometimes sub a rice or corn cereal for the bread crumbs due to a gluten allergy in the family. Regardless, they are always delicious!

These burgers were liked by my family, and easy on the cook, especially with premade pesto. Used ground chicken because the grocery store was out of ground turkey. Topped with tzatziki, lettuce and fresh tomatoes. Thanks!

This was delicious! The only changes I made were to use mozzarella/provolone cheese and sea salt instead of seasoned salt. I served on toasted ciabbatta bread, with a little pesto mayo on the bread.

Very Tasty! I made as written without the salt and adding 1 egg as other reviewers suggested. Cooked them in a pan and they were delish. Next time I will add some chopped kalamata olives.

I thought this recipe sounded great, but I'm only a fan of feta cheese in certain things. I make this recipe all the time now with a few alterations. I don't use seasoned salt - I season the mix with salt and pepper. I do everything else the same except the feta cheese. I buy garlic and herb boursin cheese and put half of the small wheel into the turkey burger mix. I don't have a grill, so I brown them in a pan and then finish them in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes. At the end, I place the remaining boursin on top of the burgers and put them back in to melt. I mix a little pesto with mayonnaise to put on the rolls, and there you have it.. probably the best turkey burgers I've ever had.

For those who can't have bread or are trying to eat low carb: I replaced the bread crumbs with silken tofu (different from regular tofu), which was a tip I found online from a chef's video...and it worked great! The burgers held together and were nice and moist. And then of course I ate them without buns and used large pieces of curly leaf spinach as my "bun".  I also used less seasoned salt (maybe a scant teaspoon) and didn't salt during cooking. My handy dandy George Foreman grilled them very nicely, and they turned out DELICIOUS. I think next time I will increase the pesto because I love that flavor.

These are delicious!  I had to make my own basil pesto because I didn't have any, but I think that made the burgers even better. Just mix the below ingredients in a food processor.   3/4 cup fresh basil leaves 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1/3 cup pine nuts or walnuts 3 medium sized garlic cloves, minced

I consider myself a burger connoisseur (as they are my favorite food), so please take this as the huge compliment it is when I say, these are the best turkey burgers I have ever tasted. I think they might just rival the best beef burger I've ever eaten. I made this to the directions, only using Italian breadcrumbs in place of plain. The texture was like a dry cookie dough and I was worried they would be dry, but I was wrong. That feta and the olive oil from the pesto melted through every nook and cranny and made for a flavorful and moist burger. I baked mine at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. I read someone's review that had broiled them in the last few mins to put a little crunch on the outside, but I do not recommend that since I almost caught my oven on fire doing that. The olive oil pops and hits the broiler element and it poofed a bit of fire up and scared me. If you want to put a browner crust on the outside, I recommend pan frying instead. Brilliant recipe and I wish I had leftovers, but they were gone in 15 minutes!

Awesome awesome taste. Feta cheese really makes the flavor great. My hubby who doesn't like pesto really enjoyed these and the kids thought they were great too! I used homemade pesto wit basil, pine nuts, olive oil, and parm cheese in a food processor that I previously froze.

So good and so easy! The second time I made these I added a little bit more feta and pesto and they came out perfect. I could eat the burger alone, no toppings or bun required (trying to limit carbs), as they had plenty of flavor. They were not at all dry and still just as good reheated the next day. Definitely a keeper!

Very moist and flavorful.  Made the burgers as exactly as written.  The only thing is that they tasted a bit salty.  Will make again but will reduce salt to 1/2 tsp.  Some reviews stated that the burgers fell apart.  The key is to form a patty with a small indentation in the middle and rub with a little oil.  Put the meat on the grill, but only turn them once halfway through.  Hope this helps!

These were tasty burgers, but I would likely try another recipe before sticking with this one.  It was a nice variation.  I left out bread crumbs & seasoned salt and used beef on the grill.

I always want to try a good turkey burger recipe.  This one is pretty good.  It has great flavor and the bread crumbs help to hold it together yet remain juicy.  I did not add any of the salt as I felt that was way too much.  I used only 1/4 c. of seasoned bread crumbs.  Grilled with a little mayo, lettuce and tomato....it was yummy.

After reading all the rave reviews, I was excited to finally try this.  However, I was less than thrilled with the results.  I may have overcooked them, because they turned out pretty dry and bland.  I thought it could have used more pesto, as I didn't really get a good flavor of it as I'd hoped.  I like the suggestion of another reviewer who mixed some pesto w/mayo to spread on the bun.  And a nice provolone cheese, would add to it as well.  For my first attempt at a turkey burger, though, I was disappointed.

This was not a hit, although from the ingredients it should have been.  My family thought the texture was odd, and it was dry (that could have been my fault for grilling it too long).

These were grand.  I didn't add any of the salt as I figured the cheese would add enough.  I think I would increase the amount of feta next time.  Of course not letting well enough alone I topped my burger with chopped green olives and red pepper.  Yep that did it for me.  A definate "make again".

So yummy! I made garlic basil pesto to use for this recipe but forgot to get feta cheese. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. next time I'll be sure to use feta or maybe cheddar cheese. It seemed I did have to grill the burgers a little longer than 5 minutes each side, maybe about 8 minutes. But I used a meat thermometer to read inside meat temp until it reached about 170 degrees. This recipe is a keeper!

These were really good! I didn't use the Feta since my guys don't like it- just left it out.  MOIST and VERY good!  Used the mustard/mayo/red pepper sauce that another reviewer made- super tasty. I made these in an electric skillet vs the grill and they were JUICY!
Update: Made these again with the Feta and EVERYONE includhing kids and my husband RAVED... DON'T leave it out...

Finally, a tasty turkey burger. I grilled these indoors on a George Foreman Grill. They were ready in five minutes. Served them on deli rounds,able to enjoy the burger without too much bread.

I wanted to use turkey, but I only had beef on hand. I made the burgers with blue cheese instead of feta, and I added Montreal steak seasoning instead of seasoned salt. I grilled these on a stove-top grill pan. Superb!

my husband and i thought this burger was delicious.  make sure you cut the seasonings down if you only use 1 lb of turkey--this may be why some people thought it was too salty (the recipe calls for over a lb).  i broiled each side 6-7 min and topped it with onion and spinach and rubbed a bit extra pesto on the bun with some mayo.  i didn't add the seasoned salt at the end, but instead a light sprinkle of crushed red pepper.

Excellent. I did cut down the pesto some, because I like a more subtle flavor.

Burgers were very moist, and I loved the pesto flavor. I did cut down the seasoning salt to 1 tsp total and used sundried tomato basil feta cheese with good results. I agree with a previous reviewer that there is possibly too much filler (i.e., breadcrumbs) in the recipe, so I may decrease it to 1/4 cup next time I prepare these; however, they did hold together nicely on the grill. My husband asked me to save this recipe, which means it definitely was a winner in our house!

These were the best burgers I've had all summer! Definitely a keeper. I followed the recipe as is and topped the burger with mayo and julienned sun-dried tomatoes.  Delicious!

My family loved these. I wanted to use more pesto, but my hubby said they were good "as is!" I didn't like that the feta cheese wasn't melted more, so next time, I may use mozzerella instead.

They were a nice alternative to just our usual plain turkey burgers.

These were the best burgers ever!  I used Italian breadcrumbs, and omitted the salt & cooked them on the grill.  I used home made pesto, and mixed a little with mayo for the bun, and the taste was out of this world. I can't wait to make them again - thanks for an awesome recipe!

Super good as is! I did a search for the recipe of the turkey burger from a local restaurant and this popped up. It’s better than the restaurant! We cooked inside because of weather.

I didn't have a grill available so I started the burgers in an ovenproof pan for about two to three minutes a side and then finished in a 350 oven for ten minutes. I used Panko bread crumbs and to add a bit of texture I added 1/2 cup of toasted unsalted peppina (pumpkin) seeds.
I served them with a mango chutney sauce.  Mix;
1/2 cup mayo. Teaspoon curry. 2 Tablespoons mango chutney. Pinch of chili powder.2 Tablespoons of lime juice.

The BESTTurkey burgers hands down! Made as directed except no extra season salt while cooking. Do th overcook 5-8 minutes per side.  No grill? Frying pan great too. Entire family loves them.

Made beef burgers for the family, (didn't think they'd like turkey ) and these for myself last night, made extra thinking I'd have left overs for today, nope 12 year old son tasted them and decided they're better than beef burgers. Will be having these all summer. Thanks for posting.

This recipe was wonderful!! I made up the patties and cooked them in the oven. I thought the combination of ingredients in ground turkey patties was exceptional! I did not put the bread crumbs in the recipe because I am avoiding bread at this time and I ate the patties without putting them on a bun. It made 6 patties that were about 2.5 in diameter. I ate the extra patties for 3 days and heated them up in the microwave. They were delicious!

These were fabulous- everyone in the house LOVED em. I would suggest cutting down on the amount of breadcrumbs (I used about 2 TBSP), unless your going for a "meatloaf" type of burger. Added chopped spinach, red bell pepper & made mini patties on my panini press. Served as a lettuce wrap on bibb lettuce. DIVINE!!
PLEASE NOTE: These burgers are not meant to serve with your typical mustard & ketchup toppings. If you eat them that way, please don't give them a bad review b/c they taste weird!

Instead of season salt, I used a turkey rub blend from Savory Spice. Other than that I pretty much followed the recipe, except that I cooked them in a pan on the stove because I didn't feel like grilling in the dark.  These are delicious burgers!

Tried it today And it was awesome.  Big hit with 3 year old and hubby.  Only thing I changed was that I used panko crumbs because that's all I had on hand.  I also used 1 1/2 tsp of salt in mixture...no extra because other reviews said the salt should be lowered.  Everything was tasty.  Keeper

I am NOT a cook, and I love a recipe that tastes so great like this one for people like me!!  It was so incredibly good!  I only changed 2 things based on others comments; I skipped the feta cheese and topped them with a slice of provolone instead.  Made them last week and bought turkey today to make more tonight, so easy!!

These were fantastic.  I made the recipe exactly as shown, only I made them into small sliders and cooked them on a stove-top grill pan.  I was nervous that they were going to be dry like so many turkey burgers are, especially because I decided to use the 99.5% lean ground turkey breast.  Not so with this recipe!  This makes a juicey flavorful burger that even the traditional beef burger lovers will go crazy over!

Just finished dinner with these burgers. I would have rated them higher without the seasoned salt. Made a couple of adjustments due to personal preference. I left out the seasoned salt completely. I was pretty sure the feta and jarred pesto would provide plenty of saltiness and for my taste it did. Added an egg white for a binder and some finely chopped purple onion and freshly ground black pepper. Served with fresh green and wax beans, carrots and potatoes from my garden. Delicious!!!!!!!!!! 
PS: leaving out the seasoned salt brought the sodium down to a heart healthy approximate 150 mg for a 4 oz burger!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Excellent recipe for moist turkey burgers.  I recently read that adding olive oil makes the turkey more moist, but the pesto does the same thing.  This is a hit with the whole family!

This is the recipe that just might redeem the turkey burger for those of us that love juicy, flavorful burgers. I was looking for leaner burger options and I am so glad I gave this a try. The pesto gives the turkey meat enough juiciness and the flavors are like fireworks. Yummmmm.

Anyone who says these burgers are too dry is doing something wrong. They are AMAZING. I used Cavender's greek seasoning instead of seasoning salt, and since it was December, I broiled them in the oven instead of grilling them, but otherwise kept the recipe identical. Huge hit with the whole family, including my 3 year old!

Made this recipe using lean ground beef and the burgers came out phenomenal!  They were juicy and rich with flavor.

Simple and delicious--really loved these and will make frequently.  I omitted the salt and used a basic seasoning blend to suit our health and taste preference.

These tasted great. With the recommendations of others I added a little more pesto and I added a big handful of italian blend cheese. For some reason my burgers fell apart on the grill but it really wasnt a problem because we were using pita pockets instead of buns (its what was on hand) so really it worked out the way they crumbled in the pita pockets. Great flavor! I served with baked crinkle cut fries!

I thought the english muffin made this dish, I tried these as is, the first time.  The second time I made these I added either provole or mozzerella cheese (on top), and 1 extra Tbs of pesto.  As is, this recipe is great.  I just can't help tweeking for my own taste

These were extremely good.  The only change I made was to cut down on the salt.  I figure people can always add more.  Thank you for these.  I will make them again and again.  Didn't even use buns - the burgers are pretty big and filling.

I make turkey burgers all the time and usually I just add whatever I feel like adding. These were the best I've had so far. The pesto and cheese gave so much flavor. They were moist and delicious. Thank you for the recipe!

This is my favorite burger recipe!  I also take a little of the pesto and mix it with some mayo and garlic powder to make a sauce for the burger!  The only other change I made is to lessen the amount of seasoned salt.  This is a really good transition burger from beef to turkey if you are trying to get your family to eat more turkey. MMMMMM!

Delicious! I made these almost exactly as is (I didn't have feta, but melted a goat cheese on top, and used a creole seasoning instead of seasoning salt) and they were wonderful! I will make these again and again. What a wonderful way to use ground turkey.

Great base recipe, like others I've since made some changes. I don't usually use feta, the first time I used Borsin which was great but expensive. Really anything grated or soft works. Garlic powder instead of minced garlic, and no added salt (pesto is salty already). I sometimes add chopped onions. Finally I use Italian bread crumbs for more of a kick.

We absolutely loved these...made them without all the salt, just used a little pinch of regular ground up sea salt.  My husband is such a picky eater I was worried he wouldn't like it.  He was really iffy about trying turkey burgers in the fist place.  It was the first time we've ever had turkey burgers, and we enjoyed them very much.  They are now on our menu!  Thank you!

I really loved this recipe.  Even my husband enjoyed it.  We didn't have buns so we ate them plain with a little ketchup they were great!  I baked them in the oven for 15 min and broiled them a bit to brown them as a previous reviewer noted.  Put them on tin foil for a fast clean up!  Will def make again!

yum, yum, yum.  Juicy and moist and delish!!!  Even my beef eating husband loved it and was surprised.  My 1 1/2 year old ate an entire patty too.  I followed the recipe except I cut down on the salt.  So tasty.  I will make it again for sure.

This recipe is hands down my favorite burger recipe. I have made it several times and it has been a huge hit. I don't use any of the seasoned salt and I add a bunch of sundried tomatoes to the mixture before grilling.    SO DELICIOUS!

great receipe ... didn't have pesto but did have lots of basil.  Used fresh sweet basil plus lemon basil, garlic chives, oregano & thyme combined to about 3 tbsp chopped, and panko bread crumbs plus one egg.  Let the mix rest in the refrigerator for a few hours so the flavours would develop a bit from the fresh herbs.  Result was great!  Costco in our area sells ground turkey on a regular basis, so this is going to make it to our table a lot more often.

We made this with 80% lean beef and it was amazing.  Also, we were out of feta so we used shredded mozzarella.

Fabulous! I used ground turkey BREAST, and added 1/4 cup melted butter to the mixture, along with a dash of lemon pepper. YUMMY!

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!  My husband is a very very picky eater and he loved these as well, and that says a LOT.  The flavors were perfectly balanced, I wouldn't change a thing about it.  I was a little concerned that the feta would be strong, but it really wasn't at all (I'm not a huge feta fan).  I served these on a bun with a little mayo and boston lettuce with a tomato/mozz. salad on the side.  Perfection!

These were SO good!  I made them exactly as the recipe states, but added provolone cheese on top.  My husband raved about them in a way I haven't heard in a long time.

I would just way rather eat a beef hamburger. My husband liked it. It was really hard to cook - it fell apart and I burned it - peeled off the burned layer, turned way down, burned again, peeled it off turned way low and it took forever!!

These were amazing!  And the kids ate them better than they do a regular burger.  I did not have bread crumbs when I made it last, but they still come out great!

I usually bristle at the thought of turkey burgers, but these were sooooo delicious! I replaced all of the seasoned salt with just a half tsp. of regular salt, mixed in, and I didn't bother with the garlic, since there's garlic in the pesto, although it would surely be good. I'll be grilling these outside often when the weather gets nice, but for now, I've just been broiling them on High, for about four minutes per side. No need for a bun, either--they're so tasty all by themselves. My boyfriend wants them every day!

Everyone in my family loved these turkey burgers including my husband who typically can't stand ground turkey in any recipe.  They were incredibly moist and the texture was very much like hamburgers.  We added lettuce and a sliced tomato, and "Wow...awesome"!

5 stars on taste, 1 star on texture... im really weird about the texture of my burgers and the ground turkey just didnt do it for me... might try it with beef next time but im not so sure that would end up being very good.  left out the salt and cooked them in a frying pan instead of on the grill since some people complained about them falling apart.  good in theory, just that texture gets to me.... definitely not the fault of the ingredients... just the meat... *sigh* oh well..

Fabulous! This was full of flavor and easy to make. I didn't add the bread crumbs and the burgers formed and stay together pretty well while grilling. A few lost little pieces of their ends but the burger still had its shape.

**Wow!**  So very surprised!  We decided to start eating healthier and well.. I love my burgers!  I didn't have high expectations, but must say - this was excellent.  I probably added more garlic and pesto and we ate with whole grain light buns.  I served with a salad!  Yummy!  I think the key is to make sure the ing. are really mixed well - meaning really get in there and knead them together!

I really liked these. I added diced onion because that helps keep ground turkey moist and use a homemade low fat pesto I had in the freezer. Really yummy. I served this on a orowheat sandwich thin roll with extra pesto and sauted broccoli slaw

I have made this several times, and the guests always ask for the recipe.  Now it is a staple for many of my friends weekly menus.  It is EASY, delicious and original.  The turkey is super moist.  My heart will break if I ever lost this recipe.  THANKS for a keeper.

Delicious, but definitely cut back on the salt. I only used half the amount and didn't sprinkle any additional salt on the burgers, and they were perfect. I used a little bit of leftover pesto and made pesto mayonnaise to serve with the burgers - YUM!

We weren't wild about these... they were much to salty and had too much pesto (and I like pesto!).  Good idea... needs alterations though.  I served them on English Muffins, which we all liked.

Very moist and very flavorful, but not overpowering.  I cooked them on the stove top instead of grilling (too cold outside!).  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This is a very flavorful burger.  I was a bit skeptical that it would be dry since no egg is used but the pesto seemed to add enough moisture.  I didn't include the feta cheese as I had none but topped it with Cooper white American cheese and that worked fine.

In the summer I make these burgers about once a week. Since I make them so often I use two pounds of ground turkey breast and always add  more pesto and feta because I love both. They are super easy and taste great. Grill 5 minutes on each side - try to not over cook them or they will be dry.

YUM! We made as is except for subbing shredded parm for the feta. We slathered garlic butter on buns and toasted them in the oven - and topped burgers with fresh bruschetta. My kids said “save this recipe”!

Delicious! I normally try to avoid turkey since I find it dry & not flavorful, but with the pesto & season salt it really was juicy & bursting with flavor.

Actually made this recipe with super-lean 4% fat beef. It made a surprisingly moist and delicious burger. Will have to try it with turkey at some point.

I made this recipe with beef instead of turkey and it came out great. I love finding new ways to spice up basic dishes. Will make again for sure

Made just as recipe indicated but probably used a bit more garlic as we love garlic.  Also mixed some pesto with mayo to put on the bun. This was an excellent turkey burger and easy to do recipe.

This is my second time making a homemade turkey burger. Back in May, I attempted to make Amy's Turkey burger when it fell apart on the bun. This time, it was a bit better, but it did fall apart, but was edible. I think I made it too big for one person. Like in the magazine, I took Ashley's suggestion to boil and bake in the oven--only I did it in my toaster oven. I did pass on the red onion and fresh basil since I didn't have any. B But I would make it again someday.

Hey, this was pretty good! I made the recipe as stated, using homemade pesto. We have a Traeger grill so I don’t know if that’s why I had to double the cooking time for the burgers to reach 165 degrees temp.  We skipped the bun, saved a lot of calories. My picky husband announced this recipe is a keeper!

Will definitely make again!!! Skipped the seasoning, used about 1/3 c breadcrumbs, and about half the feta called for to save fat/calories. Drool...the kids loved this.

Yum! My first attempt at using ground turkey, I made it according to directions and did not change a thing.  My  pesto was home made.  These burgers were moist and so flavorful.  I will definitely make again and again!

I am always looking for a recipe for turkey burgers and this was really good!  The burgers were so easy to get together and the pesto gave the burgers a great flavor.   I wasn't crazy about the use of the bread crumbs because it gave the burgers a meatloaf like texture.   I will make again, but, reduce the amount of breadcrumbs added.   I used cheddar cheese instead of feta just because of our preference.

Omg. Such a  great flavor !!   Made it as said.except for flavored salt. And no salt after 1/2 cooking .  I used English muffins , fresh jersey tomatoes ad baby spinach leaves mayo as condiment .   Felt like we act so healthy.  Took the suggestion of tin foil on the grill  with Pam .  No sticking and little cleanup.  You won't be disappointed .

I just happened to have all the ingredients for this recipe. We happened to have mesclun greens and cherry tomatoes from our garden, so I laid the burger on a bed of greens, topped it with cherry tomatoes and pearl mozzarella marinated in a bit of evoo, garlic paste, and basil paste, and drizzled a basalmic vinegar and honey reduction over the whole thing. It was delicious! My husband raved about it. We had leftovers tonight and it was just as good the second time. Definitely a keeper!

Awesome! I love recipes that are specifically for ground turkey as I don't ever buy ground beef. I had to use asiago instead of feta but they were still fantastic. Will definitely make again, though my 7 yr old didn't especially like them.

With a few changes, this is one of my favorite recipes and easy go to.   I use parmesan cheese instead of feta and Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain, then omit the seasoning salt.  I add pesto to mayo for a yummy sandwich spread and a tomato slice.  Perfect! I've also used this recipe to make meatballs, baked in the oven.  Sooo good!

I used Italian bread crumbs, and didn't use the extra salt (the store bought pesto I use is pretty salty in general). I also refrigerated the patties for 30 minutes before, because I wasn't quite ready to cook them. I think that helped them stick together on the George Forman grill pretty good! Hubby prefers beef burgers, but I may make these again for me! :)

Used recipe as template based on what I had on hand.  I used seasoned breadcrumbs and a little grated parm (only cheese I had). I also added some minced onion. I used less salt than the recipe called for and it was still too salty for my liking; next time I probably won't add any. All in all they turned out great!

Best turkey burgers ever! Used blue cheese instead of feta.  Very moist and held together on the grill.  Topped with cheddar cheese and chipotle mayo.  My teenage son loved them!

I did make this with ground beef and ricotta cheese, and added an egg and used 2 Tbsp pesto per pound.  Delicious!  Will try the turkey way.

this was great! I had a little less than a pound of turkey left over so I just used that. Made 3.5 burgers. I used cracker meal instead of bread crumbs cause that's what I had on hand. and left out the feta so everyone could choose their own cheese. I also did more garlic and less pesto just cause I love garlic and 2 table spoons of pesto sounds like a lot. 
Also don't flip these too many times because turkey crumbles easier.

These had a lot of flavor.  I used lean ground turkey white meat and they were dry.  Also used blue cheese instead of feta as a matter of personal taste.  Next time would use more cheese and more pesto.

I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic and Italian seasoned bread crumbs (because that is what I had).  I used the remaining feta that I had on hand, which might not have been quite a 1/2 cup.  We liked them very much (and my husband can be picky).  We are going to try different turkey burger recipes to try to get away from red meat.

Not bad but not terrific either.  Just ok honestly and I really wanted them to be amazing.  They stayed moist and that part was good but the overall flavor wasn't much to be excited about.  Will keep this around and try to tweak it but as its posted, I can only give it 3 stars.

We loved this recipe, even our 9 year old.  Will definitely make again.  We followed the recipe to a tea and wouldn't change a thing.  We took the advice of one of the reviewers and served them on toasted english muffins.  They were delicious.javascript:void(0);

Love these turkey burgers! And that's saying a lot, because I'm not a big fan of turkey burgers. I made them as directed except cooked them on a George Foreman grill (it was snowing outside). We also didn't use buns, didn't need them. So good!

This is my family's favorite turkey burger recipe.  The only change I have made is to use 1/2 regular low fat feta and 1/2 garlic herb feta.

Tried this last night and followed the recipe pretty much. Used a bit less bread crumbs and a bit more feta. Fried them on my stove top and they were pretty awesome. Ate with whole wheat bread, topped with tomato, a bit of mozzarella cheese, avocado, mushrooms, and onions. Had blue tortilla chips on the side. Great low cal meal.

Now don't get upset with me!  I changed the meat from turkey to Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage!  I needed to find a good way to use it up, and this fit the bill exactly because I had the pesto, I had the feta, and the bread crumbs.  When I put those ingredients into the Search, this is what popped up!  This was a very yummy lunch that my husband and I shared.  I do think that the next time I make it I will mix the sausage with the turkey half and half so that it's not quite so rich, but that's neither here nor there.  This was delicious!

These were great! I cooked them in the oven following another reviewers suggestion of 10 minutes at 350 then broil till brown (8-ish minutes) I'll cook them on the grill this summer but they were fantastic!! I didn't have any feta so I just topped w provs

This is a family favorite eaten by even my pickiest eaters.  My only negative is that the ingredients are a bit pricey (if you buy pesto and feta) We don't make it as much as we'd like when on a budget.

Best I have tried so far. Didn't have feta, so used parmesan. Didn't use seasoning salt, just a few shakes of sea salt. Very moist and very flavorful. Mixed up a simple pesto/mayo sauce and ate without a bun. Husband thought it very good, and he is a big beef eater.

These were delicious!  I will definitely make them again.  The one change I will make is to the seasoned salt.  They were just too salty for me with the pesto, feta cheese, and 1.5 teaspoons of seasoned salt.  I will either cut the seasoned salt out or only add about 1/4 of a teaspoon.  Thanks for the recipe though!  It's a keeper!

OMG. These burgers are fantastic! I made them exactly as the recipe directed, then grilled them on a charcoal (not gas) grill. I would never have guessed these were made of turkey; and the pesto & feta gives them a wonderful twist. This recipe is a keeper!

Instead of feta I used 1/4 cup mozzarella and 1/2 tsp parmesan cheese. Used 1 lb ground turkey, 3 tbsp pesto, 1/2 tsp seasoning salt, 1/4 cup italian seasoned breadcrumbs and 1 tsp of minced garlic. Made 4 patties and cooked them on the BBQ. Best turkey burgers I've had! Everyone loved them. Would love to try using english muffins for buns next time.

These are delicious if you follow the recipe to a T...I must say that I've made them a few times and lately I've been adding jarred sundried tomatoes to the mix...the tomatoes are packed in oil so they add a little bit of fat to help flavor and keep the pattys from falling apart...mmm,mmm,mmm! Serve with tzatziki sauce and/or hummus.....FANSASTIC!

What a great burger!!!
I didn't know how this would all turn out but both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised! The only change that I made was to used crushed pretzels instead of bread crumbs b/c I didn't have any. 
We just used ketchup with it and potato buns!

These turkey burgers were delicious!  I didn't add any salt--feta is already slightly salty so there's absolutely no need for that (especially adding an entire 1/2 tsp per serving!)  I've also added  chopped dried cranberries or cherries into the ground turkey with delicious results (or take the lazy way and just spread a touch of raspberry jam on the bun in place of savory condiments).

These were the best turkey burgers I've ever had! I cut down a bit on the feta and boosted the pesto (I had frozen some homemade sans parm cheese) and used ground up pretzels (gluten-free) for the bread crumbs. Broiled 5 min each side.  Were so moist and flavorful.  Will be making these again!

Absolutely amazing. I don't have seasoned salt so I leave it out, sometimes I throw in some fresh parmesan or onions to taste, but it's delicious without. I usually serve on whole wheat buns or fresh rolls with onions and baby spinach. These are ALWAYS a hit with everyone, even the die hard beef eaters. Moist, flavorful and delicious! I don't have a grill so I use my George Forman - yum.

We made thios for a day at the amusement park. Prepped them the night before and agrilled them the next day. I was grilling for a bunch of teenagers. EVERYONE loved them, even the picky eaters. Was such a hit, they requested them to be made again. Wonderful recipe.

These are my new favorite turkey burgers! I followed the recipe exactly but omitted the salt as a personal preference. I also used a tiny bit of egg whites (egg beaters) to keep them from falling apart. They were great and I'll definitely be using this from now on!

These were excellent!  I skipped the salt altogether, added an extra tablespoon of pesto, and also added an egg &  1/3 cup of milk--helped with holding the burgers together & making them tender.  Served with a sauce of plain Greek yogurt mixed with fresh parsley, with spinach & tomato on top.  My date said they tasted like a salad in a burger!  Yum.

I've been looking forward to trying this dish for a long time, and it certainly didn't disappoint! Sooo delicious! Only changes made were that I seasoned the meat with Toby's Salt and Pepper and added a little egg white to ensure everything stayed together. Can't wait to make these again for my BF and family!

These were excellent! I have a hard time convincing my husband to try turkey burgers as he always finds them too "flavorless" but he devoured these and asked me to make them again! I did leave out all the salt in the recipe and used sun-dried tomato pesto (all I had on hand). It gave them a nice tang and really added to the flavor. I also added a inch of red pepper and toasted wheat buns with Parmesan cheese on the grill. Great recipe, thank you!

So flavorful! What an easy, good meal. I topped mine with tomatoes to give it a little extra juiciness - the recipe itself is a bit dry. Next time im going to splash a little butter spray on the roll and give it a grill as well. These are good re-heated too!!!

These were very, very tasty -- even with no bread crumbs and less salt (low carb diet, high BP), and my granddaughter, who drives us crazy with her refusal to eat just about everything, loved them!  I ate mine with a fork, granddaughter ate hers on a bun.  Both ways are excellent!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I've never tried turkey burgers, was always a little skeptical ( I love a good cheeseburger), but these, are AMAZING!! By far one of the best recipes I have ever made. I have made them twice and once replaced the feta with provolone and love both versions! Thank you for this recipe!

loved it... I doubled for 6 people and it was perfect.  Lots of flavour without the fat !  Anyone know if the nutritional info is accurate on these?  I just started weight watchers and based on the cal/fat/fibre -- one of these equals 9 points !  wow... that is half my daily allowance!

These were sensational! So very flavourful! The only change I made was to reduce the salt. I found using half the salt was good since Feta is so salty. This burger with lettuce, tomato, red onion, and mayo on a bun was a wonderful matchup!

These are very good, but I gave 4 stars because I changed it a little bit. I don't keep feta in my fridge, so I left that out. I also left out the minced garlic since my homemade pesto is very garlicky. We loved them and my husband requested them again! Really yummy to serve on english muffins with pesto mayo and provolone!

I happened to have all the ingredients on hand, so I whipped this up. I used ground beef instead of turkey and a little more pesto and garlic than called for. Took a common suggestion and mixed a bit of mayo with some pesto for a topping, and WOW, was it good. Having a friend over for a movie??? This will be excellent for an informal occassion.         this is

Delish. Used half the pesto, double the garlic, half or less of the feta, about a third of the salt and half of the bread crumbs- baked at 400 for 10 minutes then broiled until they sweat, flipping once. Yum.

I cut back on the seasoned salt, since it's so easy to sprinkle it on top according to taste, but I think the measurements given for the rest of the seasonings are just about right, at least for me. Excellent change of pace burger!

These taste more like meatballs than burgers.  I followed directions exactly (as I always do when trying a new recipe).  Taste isn't bad, but not great.  You cannot taste the pesto -- best part was the feta cheese.  I would not make again.

These were surprisingly good burgers.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I added one scoop of couscous. And instead of seasoned salt I used greek seasoning.  I cooked in skillet with olive oil.  So good.

I thought this recipe was fantastic!  I followed it pretty much to a tee, without the addition of the extra seasoned salt half-way through.  I cooked my burgers on my George Foreman for 5 mins - they had an excellent crust on the outside and were very juicy and flavorful on the inside.  I only made 2 burgers and made the rest into mini meatballs for tonight's dinner (oven - 450 degrees for 15 mins).  I think the flavor will go well with any italian side I want to pair it with.  Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely use it again!

These are delicious!  I followed the recipe and only substitued 1tsp greek salt and 1/2 tsp seasoned salt for the mix.  My boyfriend grilled them...and total perfection!  I was skeptical w the ingredients, but it was the perfect combo.  You didn't even need a sauce to dip the burger in bc it had so much flavor.  Will definitely add to the rotation!

These were absolutely delicious. I used some 'better burger seasoning' (salt, pepper, red pepper, onion powder) I had from a local meat market instead of seasoning salt, and only used 1 1/2 teaspoons. The pesto & feta combo was fantastic. It's cold in Wisconsin right now, so I cooked on the stop top in a grill pan - only needs 4 or 5 minutes on each side. Careful not to over cook... they'll get quite dry. Fabulous flavor - I will make these again and again. Served on whole wheat bun with lettuce, tomato, and a smear of pesto on the bun. Yum!

I loved these!  The only thing I changed was I just sprinkled a little season salt in the mix, did not add any more and cut back on the bread crumbs.  I've tried a lot of turkey burgers and this is definately one of my favorites!

Great recipe, it was my first time using a recipe that called for ground turkey.  I didn't have basil pesto so I made my own pesto using spearmint and olive oil delicious!!!!!  I will be making these burgers again .

I made these for my family and everybody adored them, even the "turkey is for women" guys.  They are super easy to make, and taste even better with a few extra dashes of spices.

we love these burgers and they are now in our rotation.  They are the most moist and flavorful turkey burgers we've had.  We make a pesto mayo to put on the bun and it makes this burger even better!  YUM!

We love this with a big slice of tomato and some homemade pesto mayo. Only change I make is to use grated parmesan instead of feta, but it's great either way.

I made this using sun-dried tomato pesto.  Everyone enjoyed them.  I didn't have feta, so used an Italian cheese blend.  I'm sure the flavor was different than the original, but we liked it nonetheless.

I thought these were great!  (As did my ground turkey hating husband!)  I added some chopped olives as well and put it on an english muffin (as suggested in another review.) I topped with some fresh greens and brushed some balsamic vinegar on the english muffin.

Fixed these using 1 pound ground chicken and 1 pound ground turkey and just doubled the spices. We never eat our burgers on a bun, and we agreed that these were among the best burgers I have ever fixed. A definate keeper!

Quite possibly the best burger I've ever had! I'll never want to go back to beef after these turkey burgers. I used reduced fat feta cheese, 99% fat free turkey and italian seasoned breadcrumbs - the flavor was fantastic! My boyfriend put swiss cheese on top and said it was great, but the feta in the burger was enough for me. We put blue cheese dressing as the condiment on our buns, as well as lettuce, grilled mushrooms and onions. I'll definitely be making this again

Great recipe.  Would be nice with some type of mayonnaise spread.  I will be on the lookout for one next time I cook these up.

These were pretty good.  I cut way back on the salt (just a dash) and used my own homemade pesto, and about half the amount of bread crumbs indicated, as I don't like a lot of filler in my burgers.  Used a basil and sun-dried tomato feta.  They came out just a tad dry, so maybe next time I'll add some egg white to help bind.

Delicious!
I was amazed at how moist and flavourful these burgers are. I served them with grilled zucchini and yellow squash and also melon ball salad. I think these may be better than regular hamburgers.

Very good!  I didn't think it was too salty or to pesto-y, but I also didn't use more than 1 tbsp of pesto--all I had.  I did use the amount of seasoned salt it called for, and I added more garlic than called for.  All in all, we enjoyed it, even the bf, who usually scoffs at turkey burgers.  I think I've found at least one other turkey burger he'll eat!  Thanks!

I just started to get into the idea of cooking and tried this burger on for size. It was one of the best turkey burgers i've had so far. And just being cautious i added nearly half of the recommended salt and it tasted excellent. I've already told others to give this one a shot. Good stuff.

I agree with those that thought this was too salty and I think there was a little too much pesto, even though I never thought I would ever say those words! I would make them again but tone down the salty ingredients and maybe add more spices

These burgers were excellent, my husband and I loved them. I was really surprised they came out so good. I was also skeptical of the recipe because it only had 10 reviews, but I am so happy I took the risk!
Loved these burgers, will make many more times!

This was incredibly simple to make and used the timer on the stove to 5 minutes per side at medium high heat.  That may have been too much but the burgers were great.  I also made the recipe to six burgers, saving half for another day for me and the wife.

Enjoy.

This burger was SOOOO good!  I was sad that I didn't have more turkey because I would have eaten another one.  My boyfriend and I loved this meal.  It was so easy to make. I will be making it again for sure!
