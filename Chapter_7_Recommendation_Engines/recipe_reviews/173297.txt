I doubled everything and put it into a 9x13 pan. I also added a can of beans in chili sauce on top of the meat. Increase baking time to allow for extra size. YUM!

You should try this, it's really good!  I followed the recipe as written.  Having read a couple of reviews stating the pie plate was too full, I instead used an oblong Corning Ware casserole dish.  I don't know the dimensions of the dish, but it was a bit larger than the pie plate and had deeper sides.  There was no issue with leaking over the edges.  We served this with refried beans on the side, and sour cream on top.  Delicious and easy, I will be making this again.

I made this tonight and yeah, it's pretty good. The one thing that throws me is the amount of yeast...2 packs? I used a quarter of that and the "crust" was perfect.

You have to try this recipe!  It was easy, and delicious!  I thought the cornbread-like crust would be a weird combination with the -tex mex flavors in the dish, but it was great!

My husband and all 7 of my children loved this dish! I have been trying out different recipes and asking my children how many stars they give each recipe.  My 6-year-old son said, "Mom, I give this 1,000 stars!" We especially loved the crust, and I agree with the last review - make sure and use a large dish.

This was very easy to make and a hit with everyone in the family. I doubled up the recipe and added 1 can of chili beans to it. Would definitely make again!

Very good, it did run over use a large pie plate.  Did not put chips on top as didn't need the flavor.

Nice flavor combo with the cornbread crust. Used tortilla chips instead of corn chips. Very easy to make. I baked it in a 7x11 inch rectangle baking dish.

My hubsand and I loved this dish. It is simple and uses ingredients we regularly keep on hand. Make sure to use a deep dish pie pan as requested as it will certainly not fit in anything else.

The entire family LOVED this!!!! Even the little guys who are PICKY!  They ate every bite.  The only thing we did differently was use the Taco Bell seasoning for the packages, boxed cornbread (way easier) and we fried homemade tortillas chips for the top.   Fabulous!!!

FAMILY FAVORITE! I had made these over 5 times for my very large family.. always a hit!! I double the amount of ground beef for a 9x13 inch pan. I also add onions and corn to the meat. I have never put the corn chips on top. Not sure how that would taste?? But I just have a side of corn tortilla chips to eat the taco bake like a dip. Also have a side of sour cream. Truly a favorite for my 40+ people family! Made it for thanksgiving and they wanted it again for christmas! A hit at other get togethers also.

Good concept, lots of room for improvement.  Add beans, jalapenos, corn to the corn bread, olives, lettuce, sour cream, anything really.  It needs more flavor and a bigger pan it runs over so use something deeper, not a lot deeper lost about a 1/2 cup worth of food.  I put a cookie sheet under it and it caught the overflow.  This dish has potential so if you're creative go for it.

I made this in my cast iron frying pan and the bottom crust was excellant it had a nice crispy crust .  I grated monteray jack cheese over the meat and used a cheddar on the top over the chips.  My family loved this and I will definately make it again.

It's a good base to work off of but I found it needed a lot of additional toppings (after baking) to make it taste good.  I also used only 1 packet of yeast, and it worked just fine.  Also, I used a larger casserole dish as recommended by others.  I served with fresh salsa, cilantro, sour cream, and avocado.  Without the toppings it just tasted like seasoned meat on cornbread.

Absolutely delicious! The only change I made was to skip the corn oil and use vegetable oil, simply because I didn't have any, and it turned out great! My husbands co-workers were jealous of his leftovers at work the next day!

What a great dish!  The wife and I are looking for easy dishes that have great taste and this fit the bill.  After reading the reviews, next time I'll add a can of chilli beans - we thought it did need a little more moisture.  Love the cornbread but it was a tad dry.  Even our son said this was a keeper.  My bet is any leftovers will be gone before morning - and it won't be because of the wife or me.

So I used a foil pan, casserole size and it was perfect for this recipe. Wow! This was delicious!! Easy to make and cleanup was a cinch. My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this dinner. I could see kids devouring this meal and I definitely will make again and again!

MUST change size of pan, a pie dish is to small. This is a great recipe tho, we used Elk instead of beef and also added one can of chili, and topped with sliced olives. You could add corn or green chilies even. Thanks for sharing it was great

Very good!  I took the advice of another and only used 1 packet of yeast and still thought it was a little "breadier".  Next time I'll use tortillas to line the bottom.

I really liked the flavor and I also added a can of chili beans as many others have. I doubled the recipe but next time I will only use one packet of yeast. There was a little too much crust for us. I also used the taco seasoning recipe on AR and I think it makes it taste so much better.

This was a little salty for my tastebuds. It was good but I wish there was more of a sweetness to the cornbread to balance the saltyness from the taco meat. All in all a good recipe though.

I reduced yeast to one packet, topped batter with half pound of ground turkey mixed w/half package of taco seasoning then topped with leftover chili, a few sliced jalapenos, bbq corn chips and cheese. This was very good - whole family liked it - a little dry but much better if you top with sour cream!

I was VERY disappointed in this recipe!  I found that the meat, cheese, and salsa got lost in the bread part of the dish.  I used cornmeal (and usually love it), but this made it dry.  Overall, it was a very bland, dry dish.  Will definitely not make it again.

We made it just as the recipe read, except for using my 9X13 baking pan instead of a pie pan.  It turned out perfect!  Everyone loved it.  I will make it again soon.

I am thinking the quality of your salsa is important to this recipe.  We loved it!  I doubled the recipe, but not the salsa or oil, then divided between two pie pans.  One with cheese - one without for the lactose intolerant and milk allergic in the family.

I wasn't sure if we were supposed to make the ground beef as directed on the taco mix package, but that is what I did. I used a seasoning packet and the 3/4 cup of water it calls for, and let it boil then simmer for 10 minutes as called for. If I had not done this, it would have been WAY too dry. I think the recipe should be a bit more specific regarding this. EDIT: I have made this recipe at least a dozen times since I first came upon it. I double it and bake it in a 13x9" pan, but use 1 1/2lbs of beef. I use either taco-seasoned beef or sloppy joes beef. My family actually prefers this with a sloppy joe beef mixture. I do add extra salsa, and I am very careful not to overcook it. I think these 2 things help keep it moist and prevent it from being dry (as well as being sure to stick it in a cold oven, and making sure the milk is the proper temperature). We LOVE this recipe.

Very dry; I am thinking about possibly mixing the salsa and meat rather than layering them. Maybe that would help.

The recipe has too much yeast in my opinion. I used one envelope instead and it was perfect. Added more salsa than what was needed for more of a bite but overall delicious.

Two stars for being a quick easy meal to put together, one star on taste.  I made the recipe exactly as called for - same brand name ingredients and everything.  The result was my husband couldn't even finish the small slice I gave him. It tasted like pure yeast and taco meat - not an appetizing combination.  Maybe it would be ok IF the crust was a traditional cornbread batter??? But, my family would much rather have a nacho bake with tortilla chips than this yeast flavored batter.

First of all I doubled the recipe because it sounded so good. We did not like the batter bottom at all. It was hard to explain. Corn bread might have tasted better on the bottom or just tortilla chips. The top part tastes good. I could not eat the bottom part. The overall recipe is good just not the bottom part. It is a great idea just needs something different on the bottom. Another thing I am glad I put a cookie sheet with tin foil under my pan because I would have had stuff burnt on my oven!

I have made this a few times now.  The first the whole family enjoyed it.  I added the cheese to the family's liking. The second time I made the mistake of making the crust first and then realized I was out of taco seasoning.  By the time the rest was added the crust had raised so much that the filling sunk to the bottom.  Needless to say my family didn't particularly enjoy it.

I'm giving this five stars because it's everything the recipe says it is.  It's a little heavy for me, but that's personal taste.  It was very easy to make.  I used the Qorn brand soy-based ground beef substitute, that worked great.  ALSO I got home and realized I didn't have any quick-rise yeast.  I used 1 tsp of baking soda + 1 1/2 tsp baking powder instead, and that worked just fine.  The cornbread base rose well and tasted good.  I made it in a 9x9 inch square baking pan and had no overflow.  Were I to make this again, I'd probably try less cheese and meat (or whatever) and add beans and corn, maybe some cilantro.

Overall this was a great recipe. I like a lot of spice, so I added lots of cumin, garlic powder, season salt. Also the cornbread was a little dry. But the recipe was still great, and I would make it again and again!

This was such an easy and yummy meal, thank-you so much! I did a few changes, I just added 1/2 cup onion while cooking the meat. I also added about 1/2 cup fresh tomatoes, and that's it. It was so good, I served it with sour cream. Will definetly make again, and pass recipe on!

Everything tasted good except no matter what I tried, and I made this three times, the corn meal never quite baked enough. I've finally given up and will probably not make this again.

Wonderful! Wonderful! Doubled the recipe and baked in a 13x9 pan. I doctored mine a bit though.  I followed the batter recipe pretty spot on.  Just added an extra egg. I also chopped up a half an onion and two tomatoes and cooked it with the hamburger after the hamburger was completely cooked.  I also added a layer of lettuce before the chips and cheese where put on.  after it came out of the oven I gave the family the option of adding their own salsa and sour creme. This bake was a huge hit in this house:)

My family loved this meal. I was in a rush when I cooked it so I left a couple things out. I didn't put the taco seasoning in the ground beef, and I forgot the egg in the batter. It was still delicious and hearty! Will be making this dish again and again (with all ingredients)

I've made this twice now and it was really good. I was going to make this for a ladies night and had an afternoon nap planning to get up and get it ready. Well, I overslept, but it was so quick and easy it was ready on time, with rave reviews from all! Excellent recipe! Thanks for sharing.

I doubled the recipe to fit in a 9x13 pan, but used one can of chili beans and 1 pound meat.  The kids liked it, very filling.  It would make a good potluck casserole.

I followed the directions but made a few changes,  -used only 1 packet of yeast, added 1/2 can of kidney beans, left out the salsa (as I was out), and I used crumbled tortilla chips since I didn't have any corn chips. Next time I would add chopped tomatoes or salsa and maybe a bit of sour cream when served.  My kids loved it and I would surely make it again. Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

WAYYY Too much yeast.  The fritos were soggy for leftovers.  Next time I'm going to use less yeast, and put the fritos on separately.  Other than that, pretty tasty!

Hooray!!  My kids LOVED it, and it was soooo easy.  I used leftover veggi taco meat.  Instead of the corn bread topping, I used just a regular flour.  Also used leftover tortilla chips (which I was happy to have a use for instead of them going stale). Very tasty.

This was GREAT! I doubled the recipe and put it in my lasagna pan. I added corn on top of the meat before I put the salsa and cheese on. I didn't put the corn chips on, I put them on the side and just added them when we put the food on our plate because I knew we would have leftovers and I didn't think the corn chips would be very good warmed up and soggy. Will be making this again!!!

Iadded about 3T sugar for a sweeter cornbread and used taco seasoning from this website (Taco Seasoning I). Only used 1 packet yeast and it turned out awesome.

I didn't like the idea of cooking the cornbread with the rest. I guess if your family could finish in one sitting, that would work. I didn't and I am glad I didn't.  I felt this needed more to it.

I made with a cornmeal mix and maybe that was why my crust was a little dry, but it was still really good.  Topped with lettuce and taco sauce on our plates.  Very good.

This was much easier to make than I thought it would be and my husband and daughter liked it fairly well. I think next time I will add more vegetables to it - maybe some black beans and some sauteed red pepper, to make it a little healthier. Thanks!

1 of my kids liked this, the other 2 did not. The one who liked it called it "taco cake" which pretty much describes the taste and consistency of the cornbread "crust". I thought it was pretty bad: dry meat, dry cornbread, flavorless. Next time, I'll just make tacos.

eh.  I think that with refried beans, as someone else suggested, that this dish would be way better.  Also, it's a bit much for a main dish.  Would be better for a potluck as a side.

I was surprised that even my husband (not a corn or cornmeal fan) really enjoyed this.  I'm giving it 4 stars because the fam all said I could make it again, but they weren't begging to have it back.  Good recipe I'm sure I'll use over and over.

We liked this as a quick night dinner. My husband didnt like it without sour cream on top, but with it he ate it just fine. I did double all ingredients EXCEPT the yeast and the crust/bread turned out great. Baked it about 40 minutes in a 9x13 pan.

I doubled the recipe including the yeast. This made too strong a yeasty taste. No one would eat it. But the idea is great, so i'm going to try again using 3 envelopes of yeast rather than 4. I hope this solves it because it sounds so good!

Three starts because this dish was quite dry. I wondered how it could be possible to get the crust cooked. But it did! The crust reminded me of couscous. That's why my husband didn't like it, and I did. For seasoning I used the taco Seasoning 1 from this site. Very good! Will not make this taco bake again.

YUM! Very good. I had no soft shell tacos and not enough hard shell tacos but wanted some mexican...remembered seeing this recipe. Yummy. A+ Will make again. I added corn kernals to my cornmeal mix. It was a touch dry, but was  fixed by adding taco sauce (really good with it) and green/red salsa to it afterwards.  Next time, I may pump up the veggies (beans, peppers, etc.).

This was one freakin' simple recipe to make! I doubled it and baked it in a 9X13 cassrole dish....turned out perfect! Search for homemade taco seasoning on this site and it's a taste of Mexican / American...or Canadian, depending on where you live. Wouldn't change a thing. Great low budget meal.

I did not care for the crust in this.  I thought it was very bland and a bit too thick.  Maybe dividing the dough or omitting it all together and substituting it with crecent rolls would be better.

My family really liked this.  I used the cornbread recipe on the package of Indian Head corn meal, except I used all cornmeal and no flour, baking powder instead of yeast, 2 eggs.  The cornbread was moist.  I also used an extra 1/2 cup of cheese and skipped the chips.  A 10 inch, deep dish pie plate held everything, but I baked it on a cookie sheet just in case.  Everyone said this was a keeper!

I have made this recipe almost ten times now... Love it! Forget the yeast, it's not important. You can make the cornbread as the box indicates, and use that for the crust without the added ngredients, if you wish. I add salsa to the top before baking, so the favors soak in better. DEFINITELY serve with sour cream!

I added minced onion and crushed Fritos to the dough and I let it rise and baked the dough for 15 minutes before adding the filling, then finished baking.  I also used beans and corn rather than ground beef. Avocado was nice as one of the toppings.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

The crust is a great base, but I made it as written and found that the ratio between crust & toppings wasn’t balanced.  Next time I will add more toppings, but I will definitely make it again.

Made it according to the directions except I left out the cheese and added a can of black beans.  I served it with mixture of finely chopped lettuce, tomato, cilantro and avocado mixed together with lime juice.  Those that wanted dairy added sour cream.  My husband requested this again.  I was unsure how much bulk yeast to add (i never buy packets) so I put 2 teaspoons of the rapid rise yeast in the batter and mixed in a bowl.  Then spread it in a larger pie plate.  It almost over flowed.

This is one of my family's favorites! I could say we were having this every night and they wouldn't complain.

We made this with ground turkey and that is why it might've been a little dryer so if you use turkey I would recommend to use more salsa and more cheese.

This was just okay. The flavor was not as strong as I would have liked.
