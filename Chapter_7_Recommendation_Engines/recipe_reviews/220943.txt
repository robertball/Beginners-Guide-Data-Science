This has become a weekend staple at our home. AMAZING BISCUITS!! I finally figured out how to freeze the un-cooked biscuits so now I always have them on hand, but only have to make them once a week.  FYI if you're interested... make the recipe as is, except don't brush them with the butter milk.  Instead put all the un-cook biscuits on a cookie sheet with parchment paper on the tray.  Cover well with plastic wrap and put in the freezer.  Once frozen solid, put into a zip bag and leave in the freezer.  When you want to eat them you can have as many or as few as you need

 Pre-heat the oven to 475F and put frozen biscuits on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet; brush with buttermilk.  Put in the oven for 7 minutes, then without opening the oven turn the oven off and leave the biscuits in for 5 more or until lightly browned (don't open the door during this phase until the 5 min. are up).  add 1 min at a time until lightly browned.  Remove and enjoy!

This is a great recipe! I did not change any of the ingredients, but in the directions I put the flour and ice cold butter into a foodprocessor and blized it together for about 30 seconds- (Much easier than cutting it in) Then I continued as directed. The biscuts still came out light and flaky.

I use a "vegetable peeler" to grate an entire stick of butter. It works great! So quick and so much easier! Toss those long thin flakes of butter with the dry ingredients to keep them from sticking back together. 
The best buttermilk biscuits I've made since I began my quest for the perfect biscuit. I love the folding technique that left the biscuits with the perfect consistency not to mention flaky. Delicious!

OMG! These biscuits are incredible! They're so "deceptively" easy to make and they come out light, moist, and fluffy. Plus they rise nice and high -what more could you want from a buttermilk biscuit! I baked these on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brushed the tops with melted butter during the last five minutes of baking...WOW what a great biscuit!

Thanks for the recipe and the video.  We love them.  

I freeze the extra UNCOOKED BISCUITS for a quick eat in the future.  Bake them from the frozen state in the preheated oven at 450 for 8 minutes.  Don't open the door for another 8 minutes.  From freezer to plate = 16 minutes.  Plus, I notice no difference in taste or quality to the freshly made.

The perfect biscuit recipe! Only change I made was just to use the whole butter stick. The method he uses to work the dough is brilliant. You are not in danger of over working the dough, as that is what makes a dense biscuit, by using the fold and press method. I have made these several times and the taste is wonderful. They bake up light and fluffy.  Two important tips that I have learned in making the perfect biscuit. 
1) use an up and down motion with your biscuit cutter or glass(whichever you use to cut your biscuits). Using a twisting motion causes the edges to seal and you will not get a good rise. 
2) when placing the cut biscuit dough on your baking sheet, place them so they touch one another. This also helps reach a wonderful rise as they bake. 
I have deemed this the definitive biscuit recipe and my search has ended here. As a matter of fact, I'm making these in the morning since the kids, yet again, have another snow day. 
And as always... Enjoy!

Yum!  I always make drop biscuits because of ease and convenience but am glad I took the plunge with cut outs!  These are easy and delicious!  You can't go wrong with Chef John's recipes!  p.s. I make sour milk instead of using buttermilk: 2T lemon juice and milk to make 1 cup.

Well, I can see I'm in the minority here, but while the flavor was good, these were dry and hard...Maybe it was something I did. I followed the recipe to a 'T'. I've made other biscuits in this manner w/o problems, so I can't imagine what went wrong. I will give these another try soon, and update. Thanks for sharing. :)

This is one of the best buttermilk recipes on this site.   I sometimes, after cutting in the butter, put it back in the fridge for about 30 mins. because the colder the better.  Other than that they are perfect.........you can also add a few teaspoons of sugar and then you have a dessert biscuit.     Substituting soured milk is not as good so worth investing in real buttermilk.  Thanks for printing this and highly recommend.  I am an award winning baker.

Wonderful standard recipe.  There is a certain skill set needed to make good biscuits, so check out the video for tips.  Make sure you touch the dough as LITTLE as possible to yield the most tender and flaky results.  In order to avoid over-working the dough, after everything is mostly combined, I turn out onto a lightly floured surface and pat into a 1" thick round, then cut into wedges (like you would a pizza or pie).  This also avoids any left over scraps.  Once you get the method down, this is a no-fail recipe.

Excellent Biscuits! Have made them a couple of times, once following the recipe to the letter. The 2nd time I made them I was a bit short on butter, so I substituted some sour cream in place of half the butter. They turned out delicious, light and fluffy as well!  Can't go wrong with this recipe.

sometimes, just sometimes the problem is not the cook but the ingredients. I have found that checking the expirement date on the backing powder,soda ect. before you start cooking instead of after will solve a lot of problems.  i have found that sometimes the ingredients don't have to be out of date just close ! this is true with all baking items. check those labels first and just maybe save your project

Oh my goodness!  I received so many accolades on these wonderful biscuits!  My daughter who is a chef said I have a winner and should make them more often.  My mom complimented me on how good they taste.  My son can't stop eating them and my grand daughter is on her second one.  At this rate I'll have to put some away for my husband and middle boy. Thanks so much!

These were delightful!  Slight modifications include freezing the butter and then cutting into the flour mixture.  I then placed it back in the freezer for about five minutes before adding the cold buttermilk.  Perfect texture.

Best ever recipe! I always keep a stick of butter in the freezer just to make these. I grate the butter into the flour and toss. Perfect every time. (It's one stick minus one tablespoon)

I gave it 5 stars... used the recipe twice substituting half the flour with rosehip flour the first time and pokeweed flour the second time... both batches turned out great and I felt like a professional chef... the only other differences were I sprayed the pan with an oil spray instead of using parchment paper and I cut the biscuits into rectangles using a knife instead of using a  round cookie cutter... that way there is no excess to knead over again

Really great recipe! I took the advice of a couple other reviewers and used the whole stick of butter (freezing it, then grating it in to the flour mixture). I also made sure to cut straight up and down rather than twisting the edges "sealed" and also placed them right up against one another on the pan. They were perfect! Next time, I may roll them out thicker and make about 6 nice, tall, fluffy biscuits with this recipe, just for fun. ;-)

I just made these biscuits and they were wonderful! After reading the reviews I decided to use my food processor since I have very bad hands. I pulsed the dry ingredients 3 times to mix them, then I added the butter which I had cut into small pieces. I pulsed that 4 times and it was crumbly so I added the milk and pulsed 4 times so it would hold together. I removed it and followed the rest of the directions as to patting it out. All in all it was oven ready in 4 minutes. My cookie cutter was only 2 inches so I had to adjust my cook time to 11 minutes. These were very simple to make and had a great taste.

These are the best buiscuits ever!! The texture was perfect and they worked wonderfully with whole wheat flour as well! I ran out of all purpose flour the first time i used this recipe and had to use whole wheat. It was amazing. The difference in texture from the normal ones was...nonexistant. They always turn out wonderfullty and hold shape very well, they don't break or fall apart or crumble when you cut them open. I followed the recipe to a T , remembered not to knead my dough to much(just fold it a few times, made my biscuits a little bigger and thicker than the recipe says and brushed them with buttermilk before baking. These biscuits turn out delicious everytime and i will continue to use this recipe as the whole family loves it!

Love this! Watched video and did exactly as listed in recipe. Never made biscuits from scratch until now. I was always so intimidated to even try. However thanks to this recipe, my biscuits turned out excellent even for a beginner! My husband loved them and was just as shocked as I was that they turned out so good since I ACTUALLY made them from scratch! THANK YOU CHEF JOHN for getting me on track to becoming a great cook!!! No more biscuit recipes for me that start with "open can here" or "open box here"

Made these as directed, but used my food processor. Put the butter and dry ingredients in the freezer overnight, along with the food processor bowl and blade.  Process the butter and dry ingredients just until it resembles slightly wet sand, then drizzle in the buttermilk. To make them more tender (no kneading), I turned the mixture out into a 8x8 baking pan, and used a sharp knife to cut the mixture into 9 equal pieces.  The biscuits came out tall and tender, and perfect for the sausage gravy I had made!!!

As I'm about to become an innkeeper, I've been trying biscuit recipes and variations for months. This is da bomb. Straight up recipe, first time. Boom! Best I ever made. I'll try again tomorrow. Oh, and they reheat in the microwave in about 13  seconds.

The biscuits rose very high and were tender and flaky. I think freezing the butter made the difference. Delicious!

I followed the recipe and they came out decent. Second time I modified a bit. I added 1 1/2 tsp sugar, cut the salt in half and brushed with melted butter instead of buttermilk and came out more savory. Just need to reduce cooking time by maybe a minute or two and voila! These were for strawberry short cake.

I am an amateur baker and did not look forward to making another batch of failed biscuits. This is by far the best biscuits I have ever eaten whether purchased at a store, bakery, restaurant or some family favorite recipe. AND A BREEZE TO MAKE. My husband and I immediately ate 3 a piece. I wished I had doubled the recipe.

Great Recipe Chef John, thanks for sharing it! A fantastic addition to my sausage gravy and I am sure many other things as well. Everyone in my Family loves them. The only thing I am going to do different next time is brush the tops of the Biscuits with melted Butter instead of Buttermilk to get them to brown up for me a little faster without prolonging the baking time to get them to brown, but that's just aesthetics. Delicious nonetheless!

OH YUM!  These are heavenly and tender!  Easy to make too.  I used a drinking glass upside down to cut out the biscuites.  Be sure to rub a little flour on it before cutting out each biscuit.

These are truly excellent biscuits! I grate my frozen butter with a small hand grater & rub it in by hand, but other than that I did everything as specified and they came out wonderfully. Thanks so much!

Wow, I love all of Chef John's recipies!  These biscuits are amazing and since I am a southern girl, I am very picky about buttermilk biscuits.  Bake these, you will be in biscuit heaven.  These taste just like the ones my grandmother made.  Thank you Chef John.

I chose this recipe because it doesn't use lard or shortening, and it was very good.  The only difference I made was that I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cup white flour.  I also mixed it in my food processor and I wasn't dissapointed!

I love making biscuits from scratch now! I bake at 450 in a cast iron skillet, and I use the whole stick of butter ( couldn't leave the last tablespoon by itself!) and they turn out wonderfully! Crispy bottom and fluffy middle!

Excellent!  Used a microplane grater placed over the bowl of flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to grate the chilled butter and mixed in with fork while grating.  Cut into squares instead of rounds, as the dough was already in a rectangle.  Did not brush the tops, as my hands were moist with placing the biscuits on the silpat.  These were just right - crispy on the outside and soft and wonderful inside.  Made 8 biscuits and froze half - hope those hints are good ones!  Thanks so much, Chef John.  Your recipes can always be counted on to be the best

Great tasting fluffy biscuits.  I used the rolling pin method as described in the recipe, next time I will just pat it down with my fingers.  When you use the rolling pin, I feel like the don't rise as much.  Also I will pat it down to about 3/4" instead of 1/2".  Otherwise this is a good solid recipe and it produced tasty biscuits with a good texture.

Great recipe! Buttery and flakey. I didn't have buttermilk so, I substituted 1C greek honey yogurt and 1/2C-3/4C milk. Next time, I would roll dough to be 1" thick instead of 1/2"

very good.  had all the items on hand, except the buttermilk...so i made my own with a bit of vinegar.  I brushed my biscuits with melted butter though.  It did make 12 biscuits, wish i had made maybe 9 so they would be a bit thicker.  They were very good, i will make these again and use this is my "go to" recipe i will just make less biscuits! :)

I made these. Chef John's Buttermilk Biscuites. I baked them. I yielded 4 giant, beautiful biscuits. I like the baking soda taste. I liked the salt amount taste also. Seems to be a good biscuit. I wrote the name down as for myself as the buttermilk biscuits, that I was going to use for me myself. For myself! Thank you Chef John's Buttermilk Biscuits and allrecipes.com for my biscuits that I made. I liked making these Chef John's Buttermilk Biscuits. I enjoyed the measurements and the sodium intake and the salt intake. Really good "basic" biscuit. I made them and baked them on a Sunday. They turned out. They turned out really good. :)

Awesome! The first time I made it they turned out really good, which is saying something like I'm not much of a bread maker and it was my first time. They were easy and gone with in a few minutes.

These were pretty good biscuits, but I wasn't able to get 12 from this recipe.  I did rest the dough in the fridge for about 15min after kneading.  While I liked the idea of the buttermilk on top, it did make them a tiny bit soggy.  Otherwise, decent flavor and texture, if a little greasy from all that butter.

I made half of the recipe with my 18 month old. I didn't use ice cold butter, but I had some in the fridge. I cut the dough using my hand and a fork since we don't have a food processor, and it still became nice and crumbly. I also brushed with egg wash since I ran out of buttermilk. It was our first time making those and they were simply delicious. We separated them in half and ate them with jam. I found them healthy enough for my daughter to devour. This will become our quick go to recipe for biscuits.

The flavor was great,  but these were the flattest biscuits I have ever made! I think my issue was 3/4 cups of buttermilk was not enough, my dough was dry and I think missing the necessary moisture to make the biscuits get nice and fluffy.

Wow! What a great find! I didn't change a thing in the recipe. Sure, my biscuits came out flat and less appealing than the ones featured, but that's entirely my fault since I always seem to make them uneven. Go figure. Despite my kitchen blunders, the biscuits were still light and flaky. They were a big hit with the family too. In fact, they ate them up---literally! Definitely making again (hopefully making it perfect the next go around).

once again Chef John does it again. These turned out great. They were flaky and chewy, not tuff at all. I listened to another reviewer and used my processor for the cutting of the butter and flour mixture. They turned out great without much work. nice

No changes and YES I will make it again. UPDATE: I made a DOUBLE batch and froze them on a sheet pan then packed into 2-1qt size Ziploc bags.  I've cooked them from frozen and also let them partially thaw, then cook them at 400 and cook longer. Both taste great but the partial thawing causes them to rise a bit higher. (Think I'll try the reviewer that bakes at 450  8 min and leaves in another 8 min) I live alone and routinely bake and cook items, freeze them in portions on a sheet pan, then  put in a large freezer bag or shrink wrap (depending on item) with my Food Saver. ;) I've done everything from tuna casserole & cornbread dressing to garlic spinach & mashed potatoes to Texas Sheet Cake and unbaked 6" fruit pies....  all taste freshly made.

Years of trial and error when it comes to biscuit making have resulted in perfect buttermilk biscuits - tender, flakey, sky high.  Still I experiment, always wondering if my biscuits could be improved upon. 

So, what are great biscuits? Essentially a fairly common mixture of flour, baking powder, salt, butter - and buttermilk.  The difference in the recipe lies in the handling. I decided to give 'Chef John's' method a whirl. The result? A biscuit that was, yes, tender and flakey, but not nearly as high as the method I normally use and, to my mind (and my tester's) far more dense. I far prefer my method.

Turn the dough out onto your board. Handle as minimally as possible and pat - do not roll - your dough into a rectangle. Cut and place quite close together on your cookie sheet (this ensures a higher biscuit). Brush with a mixture of melted butter, salt, and sugar (caramelizes when the biscuits bake, resulting in a wonderfully crisp top) and bake at 450-475 for 12-15 minutes. Frankly I would go head to head with Chef John in a biscuit competition any day. Bring it.

These have potential!  I really want to rate these 3.5 stars but not quite a 4.  I've been looking for the quintessential biscuit recipe but haven't found it.  The bottoms of these baked to a thick, hard crust.  They weren't burned but just "too done".  They had a nice rise and looked pretty!  When I asked my esteemed panel of judges (husband and son) we all agreed that they "tasted like the ingredients" as in "not quite baked but had just a bit of a raw taste" even though they were thoroughly baked.  They were also lacking a flavor element so I think I will add just a touch of sugar (1 1/2 tsp) next time and see if that helps.  I will also bake them on an airbake cookie sheet to insulate the bottoms.  I used a Silpat (which I love and highly recommend) but I used a standard rimmed baking sheet fearing butter may leak out all over my oven - I've had that happen with other recipes.  Leaking was minimal with these so I think I can use the air insulated sheet.  I made the dough cold by mixing the dry with the butter and freezing it for 24 hours.  The dough stayed beautifully cold while I worked with it and, I believe, it really helped with the rising.  As Martha Stewart says "Make it cold and bake it hot!"  I will try this recipe again with a few adjustments and hope my quest will finally end!

OMG, these were so good.  I thought I had totally messed them up because I wasn't sure if I mixed and folded them too much but they turned out perfect. Wonderful flavor, flaky, easy to make and my entire family gobbled them up!  Only thing I did different was to add vinegar to milk since I didn't have any buttermilk on hand and I grated the butter as others suggested.

Best biscuit recipe- THEY RISE! Previously my biscuits always tased good but they were hockey pucks.

And I have to say whoever suggested freezing and grating the butter-genius!  I made a test batch to make sure I would like them and they would rise, then for the batch I wanted hot at dinner, I mixed the dry ingredients and the butter and set them aside.  Then 10 minutes before I wanted to put them in the oven I added the milk and assembled.  For one batch I used sour milk made with 2 T lemon juice and the rest milk; for the other I used 2 T white vineagar and the milk.  I am sure it would be even better with buttermilk but I don't keep it in the house so I adjusted.

I use milk with vinegar in it instead of buttermilk, but they are awesome. I recommend watching the video as it gives hints that will help your biscuits in general regardless of recipe. Although this recipe is so good you may never want to look for another.

Wanna know how easy these are to make? I'll tell you! I'm not a chef by any stretch of the imagination, but my wife always puts me to work making these little beauties while she makes the sausage gravy to put on top of them. They come out so well, my mother-in-law who is a great cook tried them and gave me huge compliments and asked me to show her this recipe.

Me and my grandma made these.... If you double the ingredients you get more fluffier and crispier biscuits. And you don't need partchment paper go to a flat surface and put some flour..(This way you can't get enough THANKS!)

I've made this recipe twice and the second time they came out better and fluffier.  I don't recommend actually rolling them out to a rectangle.  This seemed to make flatter, denser biscuits.  Instead, just pat the dough into a rectangle and follow all the steps.  I also only make about 6-7 biscuits and they come out nice and big and fluffy.

These are perfect biscuits. I didn't vary the recipe at all. (Except that I had to add a little more buttermilk because my homemade buttermilk came out a little too think.) These are quick, easy, and really too good for words.

This recipe was very good. A tabl. of sugar made it even better. The video shows Chef John turning the biscuit cutter after he cuts into the dough. For a lighter biscuit do not turn the cutter, biscuits will rise even better.

I made these exactly like the recipe. The only mess up is I rolled them out too thin. They did not rise that high, but they were very tasty. I did not work the dough very hard either when I rolled it.
The recipe was very easy, the aroma is wonderful, I liked the slight crispness of the outer biscuit.
As far as the inner texture and fluffiness I messed that up, and was not fluffy enough for a good answer. I know I will master this biscuit recipe.

I made this today. Was very careful to not over manipulate the dough. It was flaky, however I thought it would be fluffier and raise more. I thought it tasted doughy. Thought it would be tastier, more of something I can't put my finger on, more salt?  Not sure... I followed the recipe exactly. With the exception of cutting them into rounds. My husband loved them. They cooked up nicely.  Took a photo but couldn't upload it!!!???? Don't know why!

I made these per the directions, only omitting the salt because I used salted butter and they came out kind of bland and didn't brown well at all.  Butter notes were well pronounced and the buttermilk gave it a nice tang, but without more salt, they'll probably end up getting pitched.  Next time I'll add the salt on top of the salt already in the butter.  The rise on these biscuits could also use some extra help (but they are flaky), so next time a full tablespoon of baking powder.  Great tip for those who don't happen to have a food processor or shortening cutter on hand is to freeze your butter, then use a box cutter to grate the butter into the flour.  I'll keep practicing until I get this right!

I am a horrible biscuit maker! These did not come out perfect, but better than my usual. Like it says in the video, 
It may take a few times, so I will keep trying since it is a pretty easy recipe. Not bad. I liked it.

Halved this recipe, & used kefir in place of the buttermilk.

Pressed it into a rectangled & cut 4 square biscuits out of it.

They were delicious. I would make them again.

Flavor was good, but they were not flaky and were pretty dry. I didn't have any buttermilk on hand so made my own and had to use skim milk, so I am thinking this was the major flaw. I will try them again with the actual buttermilk.  They were very easy to make and my 19 month old had a ball helping me pound out the dough on the counter!

Very dry and salty. I expected fluffy and moist. Would not make again. I only gave it two stars because they did become biscuits.

I increased the buttermilk by 1/8 cup (my dough was far too dry),  eliminated the salt since I use salted butter and used a full stick of butter. I also reduced the baking soda to 1/8 tsp because I am wary of using both baking powder and soda together.  These were flat, too dense, a bit too salty and totally lackluster. Meh.

I have been making biscuits sine I was 10 yrs old (that’s over 50 years) and this is the basic recipe that all southerners use. As with most things, practice makes perfect. Couple of pointers that ensure perfect biscuits every time - 1) Use a soft, winter wheat flour such as White Lilly. You can order it on line if it’s not available in your area. 2) Use self-rising flour and make your life easier by eliminating measuring baking soda, powder and salt. 3) I use a mixture of butter and shortening. Butter gives flavor, shortening gives flakiness. 4 or 5 TBL ice cold butter and 2 or 3 of shortening. 4) Cold,cold,cold! I even keep my flour in the fridge. 5) cut butter and shortening into small cubes and rub it in with your hands. Use a snapping motion with your thumbs and forefingers to flatten and “rub” it into the flour 6) MOST IMPORTANT- use a sharp biscuit cutter in a straight down and up motion. DO NOT TWIST! Twisting or using a dull cutter (such as a drinking glass) compresses the edges and prevents rising. 7) Lastly use a hot oven. I bake at 450 -500 for 10 min. and brush with melted butter as soon as they are done. There is nothing more satisfying as a perfectly baked, hot biscuit!

These were a good base recipe but they definitely needed more salt. Next time I will probably increase salt to 2 tsp or use salted butter. I will also use a larger cookie cutter and increase the making time slightly  as they were too small with a 2.5” cutter. Another tip is to freeze a stick of butter for about 10 minutes and grate the butter rather than slice it. It incorporates the butter more thoroughly and it will pretty much guarantee flaky layers.

The perfect biscuit recipe! I threw all of the dry ingredients into a food processor, added the cold butter in 1 Tbsp tabs, pulsed till coarse and butter thoroughly cut in, added the buttermilk, pulsed until dough formed a cohesive ball, rolled into a floured surface, cut and baked. Absolutely fantastic! Light, fluffy, the perfect biscuit texture!!

I unhappily made these biscuits a few times - small, flat, and bland- until I found a suitable recipe that I love! The ratio in this dough is way off. For two cups of flour, you need a full cup of buttermilk and a bit less butter. You also need more baking powder to get them to rise properly.

I need a better pastry cutter so I can make these much more often.  I love love love biscuits and these are delicious.  Make them.  Soon.  We are having ours with turkey soup after Thanksgiving.  I doubled the batch so I can eat them half the night then have more for breakfast tomorrow.  Also, you CAN be bold and rather than roll and cut in nice circles, over and over until you have one last lump of dough, just roll them into a vague rectangle, and cut into two inch squares.  Taste the same, but you don't loose the tenderness by kneading them several times.  Yum!!!

These were wonderful, but 3/4 cup of buttermilk wasn’t nearly enough. My dough wouldn’t even come together much less get that nice stickiness you want from biscuit dough. I upped it to 1 cup, but ended up pouring a bit more in.

These were fabulous. I made exactly as directed, except that 3/4 cup buttermilk wasn't enough to form crumbs into dough, so I added a few more tablespoons of buttermilk.

I folded and added my thumbprint as per the video, and these were super flaky! The buttermilk wash on top resulted in the perfect golden brown with a lightly crisp top! 

I have found my new biscuit recipe.

Super flaky and high rising! I took a shortcut in cutting; I patted it out to a 9 in.square and cut it into nine pieces. They took a minute or two longer to bake since they were bigger.

This is a simple recipe that has been a hit in my house! The recipe as is gets 5 stars. Make sure that all ingredients are kept cold! I actually sift the flour and use a potato peeler to slice the butter (4tbsp butter & 3tbsp shortening). I put the bowl with flour and butter in the freezer for 15 min as well as the cup of buttermilk. This yields a pretty good rise from the dough. I have tried this with Saco buttermilk blend and they are just as good.

Best fluffiest buttermilk biscuits I've ever made. I did use self rising flour as a shortcut and graded the butter with a cheese grater. Worked  fantastic 
Thanks Chef John for another great one

I have been experimenting with biscuit recipes looking for the perfect one for Thanksgiving. This one is great, but I had to modify it after reading the reviews. I used 1 cup of buttermilk, I used salted butter, and 1/8 teaspoon of salt (should've used more they were missing that flavor), 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, and 2 1/4 cup of flour. They were good just still a little bland. I will be using these for Thanksgiving just adding a bit more salt.

Like another reviewer said, I am in the minority - because mine turned out dry and pretty tasteless.  Yes, I can see the layers, but since the biscuits weren't pull-apart flaky, I don't see any advantage to the triple fold. I also think the flavor isn't exceptional enough to use real butter; shortening usually produces a tender dough.

Great recipe. We used gluten free flour, so it should be noted to lower the heat OR cook for about half the time and let sit for a few minutes as the oven cools down. About halfway through I had to take them out of the oven because it started smoking. EEK!

Otherwise, this would make a great buttermilk biscuit with regular flour. I'll have to toy around with the recipe to see what can be done about times with gluten free items.

I made these tonight for dinner...they are so good! I can't stop eating them. A few notes though; they are a bit salty and I think they should be at least an inch thick and perhaps smaller in diameter, I'm not sure about that though. I just wanted to say thanks for a great biscuit.

These were too crunchy for me. If I were to ever make them again - which is unlikely - I would roll them thicker, bake them at a lower temperature, and lessen the bake time.

I did as some others, I put the flour mixture and butter in a food processor first, then the buttermilk in there to combine.  And then patted together into a rectangle.  Instead of cutting into 12 round biscuits, I made 10 square"ish" biscuits.  Baked for 16 minutes.  Will make this again.

Never been much of a baker, but these make it easy to look good in my families eyes. I mix it up sometimes with garlic and shredded cheese. Gonna add some herbs in the future for some more depth. The second time I made them I threw away my need for waste and just started cutting them into squares. Now I don't toughen up the dough for a second round.

Yummy. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used sour cream instead. I topped the biscuits with a dab of butter instead of using the buttermilk. The biscuits turned out so moist and flaky. I also baked at 400 degrees.  This recipe is a keeper.

These were great! I grated the butter onto a wax paper lined cookie sheet THEN froze it...very easy and freezes quickly. I also patted the dough out instead of rolling, then cut into squares. This was easier than dealing with the leftover scraps from cutting into circles and gave them a nice, rustic look. They have a very buttery flavor, so they were a nice alternative to my usual biscuits made with shortening.

Excellent recipe.  After trying several different ones, I've settled on this as my "go to" recipe.  I don't use parchment or brush with buttermilk before baking. Just oil the pan, dip the cut biscuits in the oil and turn over (for a tender top).

I grew up eating "fluffy" biscuits but have decided that flaky biscuits placed apart on the pan are more to my liking now.

Another excellent recipe from Chef John.  I followed the directions except for cutting with a biscuit cutter, I used my food processor and pulsed about 10 times.  I rolled it out and just cut into 12 rectangles, no waste, no re-rolling.  15 minutes was perfect and they were crunchy on the outside, flaky goodness on the inside.

Unbelievably good! I used 1 cup of buttermilk and brushes the biscuits with butter before cooking and they turned out amazing!! So delicious I could have eaten them all myself. Made enough dough for probably 2 dozen with this recipe. Only cooked 1 dozen and froze the rest of the dough, hope it works out when I go to cook em again

I usually switch off between 2 other recipes for biscuits that I have, but saw this and decided to try it. They puffed up nice and tasted good when hot out of the oven. As soon as they started to cool off, they weren't that great. My family asked me why I didn't make the usual ones. I usually make lots so they can have the leftovers in the morning with breakfast. They were hard and not very tasty. My family was not too happy and I used 3 cubes of butter because I tripled it which made it more expensive to make than using shortening.  So I probably won't make these again.

Slightly dry and hard, despite tossing in that extra tablespoon of butter.  I'm sure that's where the 'practice makes perfect' comes in- I always roll them too thin.  Otherwise very flaky and quite delicious.

These came out perfect! They were buttery, fluffy, yet crispy on the outside and perfect in the inside. I forgot that I was out of baking soda, so I just threw in some more baking powder.

I had them come out 3 different ways. The amount of buttermilk is the key for me. First time was a bit hard but my wife liked them that way for Bisq and gravy. 2ed was flaky and I did not work the dough as much. 3ed was with a little more Buttermilk and came out moist and tender. I am at 2300 ft and use a convection oven.

Did half wheat and half all-purpose flour. It didn't rise very much but they still had a great texture, taste, and overall quality. I also used Kefir instead of buttermilk. A+

Perfection in a biscuit. Light, flaky, buttery goodness. I'm not sure if my oven is off, but I have made these twice now, and both times I have had to take them out after 12 min. instead of 15 to keep the tops from browning too much. Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter. I'm so glad I found this gem!

Perfect, perfect, perfect!!! Can you tell I really love these biscuits and this recipe?! This is the first biscuit recipe that I have tried that the biscuits actually came out flaky, buttery and not tough and flat. I had basically given up on making biscuits from scratch but made a red velvet cake and had leftover buttermilk that I didn't want to waste and came across this recipe on AR. The video was great and extremely helpful! I followed everything by the recipe and made perfect buttermilk biscuits to go with our Easter ham dinner. And we have some left to make ham sandwiches with for lunch! Thanks for the great recipe and video.

Bye bye old biscuit recipe....hello Chef John's!! These look great, are easy to make, and taste great! I didn't have buttermilk so I poured a little under one tbl. of lemon juice in a measuring cup and poured milk over it to the 1 cup line, then mixed together and left sit for 5 min, then used what the recipe called for. I also had only margarine instead of butter so I used that instead. I don't have biscuit cutters so I used the end of a glass that I dipped in flour to cut them.   UPDATE:  I like to use Blue Bonnet margarine sticks the best when I don't have real butter, they still taste great, and I now use Gold Medal Better For Bread flour instead of all-purpose, they seem to come with a better, softer texture inside, also, I use the whole stick instead of the 7 tbl., no matter which I use.

I had a plain (no sugar or flavors) drinkable lowfat yogurt smoothie on hand, so I used it in lieu of buttermilk. Excellent results.

I have used this recipe twice for breakfast biscuits and my family, even my Mother-In-Law raved about how good they are.  The first time I just dropped them and they were still absolutely delicious and melt in your mouth.  This has become my favorite biscuit recipe.

I've tried lots of biscuit recipes in the past, and had pretty good success, but I have to say, these are the best biscuits I've ever made!  I did make a couple of small alterations.  I added about 2T of shortning and 2T of sugar.  Other than that, I followed the instructions to a T.  I even watched the tutorial video for the dough "folding" instructions...that helped. I won't ever use another recipe for biscuits...I've found perfection! :)

My biscuits didn't rise to well at all but they were delicious.. really good in fact. I added a tablespoon of sugar and used an entire stick of butter. I'm thinking the reason they didn't rise well was because my cutter(meaning cup from the cabinet) was bigger than the one the recipe called for.. I'm going to try it again today and see how they turn out...

Hey Chef John! Loved these biscuits even if I did change slightly. I used 3 T of lard (I make myself) & 3 T of salted butter. I used the salt called for anyway. Used my K/A stand mixer with the beater attachment to cut in the frozen fats but I mixed in the buttermilk just like your video shows. I needed a T more milk to get it right but that's how things go sometimes. I did lightly smear room temp butter on the top before each tri-fold. Then wrapped in cling wrap and left in the fridge & pulled out an hour b4 I was ready roll/cut/bake. I went with 1" thick so I got 8. I brushed tops with mix of 1 T melted butter & 1 T buttermilk which worked really nice. I baked on super-stoneware which worked perfect - no overdone bottoms. Finally SUCCESS and a biscuit that isn't dry or leaden. Thanks for the vid - I was definitely overworking the dough in past efforts. NOTE: make sure to use fresh baking powder - CHECK THE DATE! I'm going to make 2 batches next time and freeze extra (unbaked) to have handy. I'll follow baking tip reviewer CORKIDEKAT gave on that. Thanks a bunch!

As a cook I have made about 30,000 buttermilk biscuits. If they are less than a half inch they won't rise and they will be hocky pucks. If they are too thick even 3/4 of an inch they will be large great looking biscuits but the center won't be done. My oven temperature was 525 for 8 min. Whatever temperature you bake them, when you smell them they are done. If they start to brown on the bottom turn on the broiler on the top and watch them carefully. 30 sec. too long and they can burn. I had a pan of melted butter and a brush waiting for them to come out. To this day I never got tired of them. To cut up the butter I used a cooling rack that was sturdy and about 1/4 inch or less openings. The cut cold butter falls into the flour to be mixed dry before the addition of the liquids. If the butter is cold it will not cling as you shove it through the rack. Takes about 1.5 seconds. The mix seemed to last about 15 min. after that it didn't rise as well. The left over pieces when pressed together can be rolled and will make a few more. If you are making more then recycle leftover bits into the next batch. Dough that has aged a little and is not expected to rise can be mixed with a little more flour and rolled out 1/8 inch thick for some of the best dumplins ever. The dumplin dough will be a little tough to keep its shape. Cut into 1 inch squares. There you have it you can make buttered biscuits, gravy and dumplins out of the same dough. Make fried chicken and invite me over! :-D

I think my only mistake was that I used Brown Rice flour (gluten free attempt) opposed to all purpose, because mine did not rise as nicely as the picture indicates. Regardless, they tasted great (had it alongside with stew) and the boys liked it , and that's all that matters sometimes!! I'll just make it the right way next time and hopefully I'll get a better result. I do recommend this recipe! They're great and surprisingly easy to make! :)

Super easy.  I added a touch more buttermilk and cheddar cheese shred, and made them as drop biscuits.  According to the husband, these are the best biscuits I've made, yet.

Best homemade biscuits I've made sofar - and I suck at biscuits.  First ones came out great, second ones not so good.  I used 2% milk on the first batch and buttermilk powder & water for the 2nd (according to the directions on the can).  I don't keep buttermilk on hand, so I will make with milk again and report back.  Would have never thought to brush the tops, it really makes the tops nice.

Perfect. Followed exactly as written. I'm becoming a fan of Chef John. You can pretty much count on his recipes being exact. Light, golden biscuits. Even used with sausage gravy, came out great.

What an awesome recipe!! I make the dough exactly as stated, down to rolling it out. At the point where the instructions say to roll it out, I just pat it into a rectangle and cut it into 10 - 12 squares (I don't have a biscuit cutter that size).  They cook up flaky and light.  I do find that I have some flour left over with this amount of buttermilk, even though my dough has some really wet parts.  Probably user error though.  I don't want to overmix and melt the butter.  Overall a great recipe that I will make again and again!  :)

These were very tasty and turned out well for my 2nd time making biscuits.  mine didn't rise as high as I see some others, but still giving 5 stars as I think that is from lack of experience on biscuits.

Perfect biscuits in every way.  Light, flaky, crispy and toasted on the little rough edges, and delicious.  And it's just as easy as any other simple biscuit recipe.  I let a frozen stick of butter sit out for 10 minutes, and it was just right for cutting into slices.  The dough was pretty sticky, so I needed to add quite a bit as I worked it, which led to overworking it some.  These will be even better when I get that part just right.  I measured the thickness and size of my cutter, but it only made 8 biscuits.  Great recipe.

I've never been able to make scratch biscuits but after only 3 try's, I'm doing it!!!  I cut my butter up and put it in a zip lock baggie so it will be ready when I am!  I cut the biscuits a little thicker and they come out great.  Keep buttermilk and frozen butter on hand all the time!

So easy! Definition of what a homemade biscuit should taste like. Don’t skip the butter going in the freezer or preheating the oven to proper temp.

This was my 1st attempt at homemade biscuits. Chef John's recipes are always a winner so I decided to give him a shot. My batter was definitely more wet and I had to end up adding a bunch more flour but in the end appearance taste and texture were absolutely perfect. I will definitely make these again.

I don’t know what wrong.  I followed the video exactly.  They were too salty but I didn’t have unsalted butter and didn’t adjust the salt so that explains that problem.  They were less then 1 inch tall.

Huge hit with the family. Lots of flakes layers.  Crisp on the outside and soft inside.

Working with the frozen butter is a challenge, but definitely worth the effort.

I folded the dough five times instead of three.  Hope CJ doesn't object, but after all, I am the Boss of my Biscuits.

I struggled with an old Betty Crocker recipe, and so got on allrecipes and typed in "Chef John Biscuits".  I have learned any time I can't get it just right, to add "Chef John" to the search.  The folding over of the dough and the use of both baking powder and baking soda are what I think made the difference, so today (and going forward), the biscuits in my home are delicious.

I just made these. They are FABULOUS!! I didn’t have buttermilk on hand so I “made” it with 1 cup 2% milk & 1 T lemon juice. They came out soft, yet lightly crunchy on the bottoms & a little on sides which added to the taste.  They are perfect inside & out, and airy & flaky. Keeper & will be my only biscuit recipe from now on!

Way too much flour, very dry and tasted like flour. I will make it again but will decrease the flour by at least 1/2 cup and eliminate the baking soda and increase the buttermilk.

I made this recipe exactly as listed.  Following the suggestion of another member, I used a cheese grater on a frozen stick of butter. It was relatively easy to make but mine didn't rise so my biscuits stayed only a half inch thick. I will try again and roll them out thicker than a half an inch. I wanted to use these for bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit sandwiches and will use one biscuit on the top and one on the bottom because they were too thin to cut and put the fillings inside. The flavor was awesome.

Perfect. Cutting in the butter but not over doing it and the folding step make this recipe work. Just add sausage in cream gravy!

This recipe is a family favorite.  The only thing I do differently is to freeze the butter and then grate it before incorporating it into the flour mixture.  This step seems to really help distribute the butter.  I also use one full cup of  buttermilk.  

They are very good, so good in fact that I don't really like restaurant biscuits anymore.

I had limited supplies but these still turned out good.  I may have rolled too much.  For lower sodium, use unsalted butter. 
 Enjoy trying Chef John's recipes!

For buttermilk used 1 cup of milk and 1 tbsp of lemon juice.   Use my VitaMix to do the initial mixing.  

Biscuits turned out okay.  Tasted great however they were more or less flat.  I like high-rise biscuits.  I don't know if the biscuits rose much at all.

I usually knead my biscuits until my arms get tired because I am stupid.  On these I tried the 3 fold method.  Still got flat biscuits.  Will give them another try or two then go back to buying bags of frozen biscuits from the store.

Very yummy. Easy. Came out great. I used a full stick of butter and a cheese grater.

Second time I made it with toddlers so they didn’t rise as well but I baked them in my cast iron skillet and they turned out great.

This was my first attempt at making biscuits using this recipe.  The results were very good and appreciated by all who tried them at dinner.  The only change I made was that I grated the frozen butter which made it easier to blend with the dry ingredients.

I made these biscuits, but they were pretty much flavorless. I think the recipe needs more salt. I will make it in the future and include more salt in the recipe.

Fantastic but technique sensitive. DO NOT overwork the dough. The result will still be tasty, but won’t be a nice crumbly biscuit.

this is my go to biscuit recipe.  Make sure your butter and milk are super cold.  If your out of buttermilk, regular milk works fine as a sub.

I make it exactly per instructions and my family raves about it.  The biscuits are warm comfort food.  Goes great with butter and jam.  The buttermilk is key to the flavor.  Mine always come out light, fluffy and super tender.  I would like to see if I can get some more flaky layers with a little more folding.

I made a double batch and mixed the butter and flour with a paddle attachment in my electric mixer. Then I lightly mixed in the buttermilk and finished hand mixing it on a baking sheet. I wanted biscuits big enough for a sandwich so mine were larger in diameter and not as tall. I saved the rest in the freezer, this recipe goes GREAT with sausage gravy

I have never made biscuits before so I don't have another recipe to compare it to, but these turned out so good. Way better than store bought or fast food biscuits for sure. Mine didn't puff up as much as I thought they would but I might have rolled them out too thin or just over handled the dough.  I will definitely make these again, they were fast and easy and delicious.

Fantastic.  Followed the recipe exactly. The only thing is I didn't have a 2 1/2" cutter. I used a lid of a jar. It was a little small but they tasted awesome. Thanks for the great recipe.

These are our standard fare for breakfast and dinners. Our quick meal for the week is SOS over these biscuits, and they are delicious! The only change I made was to brush the tops with butter rather than buttermilk.

Mine came out flat, but they were good and fluffy inside. I can’t make a decent biscuit to save my life, but like I said these came out pretty good. This southerner came out defective lol

These are the best (and best looking) biscuits I've had in a long time.  Brushing the buttermilk on top gives the biscuits a beautiful shine.  They were almost too pretty to eat.

I include  1/2 cup more of unbleached flour, 1 teaspoons more of baking powder,  1/2 teaspoon more of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon more of baking soda.  When done baking for 15 mins at 425  degrees, I brush additional buttermilk and olive oil on the biscuits. I use the rim of one cup measure for shaping the biscuits.

Fantastic! My Husband loves these! I made them in my lodge cast iron biscuit pan. Preheated the pan then lightly buttered the individual rounds in the pan. Placed the cut out biscuit dough in the pan and brushed them with buttermilk. Watched them closely as I only have a convection toaster oven. Baked them at 450 checking at 10 minutes and every 5 minutes after until golden brown. About 30 minutes total. Definitely making again soon. So delicious. Lightly crispy on the outside. Nice crumb inside.

Yeah, these are what I wanted!!  I live outside the US, and biscuits don't happen here.  In the past when I have tried to make them, they were tough, hard, hockey pucks.  Golden brown hockey pucks, but ....  This morning I made these.  I have a gas stove and it requires electricity to maintain temps, and normally doesn't get hot enough for biscuits.  This morning, no power.  I had the dough made and decided to go ahead and just keep a close eye on them.  Well, long story short, they are fabulous!  I only cooked them about 8 minutes but they were perfectly done.  Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy inside.  Grating the butter cuts about 5 minutes off the time needed to prepare them, so in less than 20 minutes I had my first two with butter melting and my tummy happy.  Thanks, Chef John.

This was a new biscuit recipe.  I like to follow the recipe directions, use the ingredients and the steps as written.  The biscuits came out of the oven and met my expectation.  I wanted a moist and tasty biscuit.  This batch of biscuits were for  that morning's breakfast and were served with local organic honey and unsalted butter.  My husband loves biscuits and in two days the biscuits were gone.

Light, crumbly, delicious! This was my first time attempting buttermilk biscuits and I’m so happy with how they turned out. I subbed 1 cup heavy cream + 1Tbsp vinegar for the buttermilk (3/4 c for dough & the rest for brushing on), added shredded rosemary Manchego cheese (about 1/4 cup, definitely should have added more), shredded frozen butter with cheese shredder, and instead of folding just kneaded a couple minutes in the bowl. WOW are these light and wonderful!!

This is exactly what I was looking for! Wonderful texture, the flavor is perfect for a buttermilk biscuit & so easy to make. I did not bake them on a silicone baking sheet because I don't own one & thought of baking them on parchment paper but decided to bake them on a plain cookie sheet simply because I wanted the bottoms to be a firm crust. That is exactly what I got and they were perfect for me. If you want soft pillows of heavenly biscuit goodness, be sure to use a silicone mat for baking them. This is a wonderful recipe!! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe with us.

Just found this recipe and as some others have done, I substituted real butter for the shortening. They do definitely get tall and with the butter substitution, had a great flavor!

These turned out fantastic! I was a bit skeptical of biscuits since I tried to make them once and failed miserably. This being my 2nd time after 5 years or so, and they tasted sooo good! I followed the recipe to the T. Nothing to change!  Keep it as is!!

Having spent most of my life in the South, I'm very picky when it comes to biscuits - but this recipe quickly became our new standby. It flakes just as well as any of the shortening recipes, but makes it so that you don't have to keep shortening on hand. It pairs well with Southern sausage gravy, and doesn't have the slightly sweet taste that many butter biscuit recipes have, making it ideal for a savory dish.

Disappointed! I enjoy trying new recipes and was expecting a delicious biscuit based on reviews. Not at all like Grandma used to make, but everyone’s taste is different.

I've always been intimidated by biscuit recipes for some reason, but I've always had great luck with Chef John's recipes, so I thought I'd give this one a try... and I was not disappointed! I wasn't sure if I was doing it right, but after I took them out of the oven, they looked pretty gosh darn good! there were a few left over, so I made little sausage breakfast sliders. Definitely a keeper recipe.

I've made these a few times for my family and they come out great. As with most biscuit recipes, I adjust the flour-to-milk ratio so the consistency of the dough is right before I start the folding process. When the dough is treated gently during mixing/folding they bake up light and flaky.

Made these this morning. I followed the recipe precisely. Texture is great. They ARE easy, BUT the flavor is gross. They taste like baking soda. I'm from the South and there are definitely better tasting biscuits out there. They may be more work, but it's worth it. Won't be making these again.

These were so good.  I had to stop my bf from eating them all. I used a little less salt than the recipe required and they were still salty enough. I folded the dough four times instead of three.  They were buttery and flaky. What more could you want?

I was looking for a good biscuit recipe and I came across it. it took me about an hour in a half to start to finish. I was able to make it with just a whisk and my hands to combine it. you don't need a pastry blender. it was a pretty good recipe. I made it and had a brunch with them. they are perfect for biscuits and gravy. uhm so good. I am writing this as i eat them. it tastes so good with fried eggs.
I highly recommend these recipe for recipes.

First time I made recipe exactly as printed.  Delicious.  Second time (this morning!) I tried a few changes:  used 1 c. unbleached flour and 1 c. white whole wheat flour, and rather than the butter, I used 4 T. Crisco and 3 T. coconut oil.  Delicious.  I didn't brush the tops with buttermilk, and they still browned nicely.  This recipe is a win no matter the changes I made!

The taste was good, but they were dry and crumbly.  The dough didn't seem to have enough liquid/fat to hold together.

I have been trying different biscuit recipes and this one is great!  Even though I accidentally put in one cup of buttermilk instead of 3/4...they still baked up great.  Crunchy tops and bottoms and fluffy in-between!!!

Just tried the recipe for my first time. My only mistake was rolling it out too thin, next time three-quarter inch. My oven bakes unevenly which is always a challenge so I have to watch the temperature and time baking. Love that there was a little crunch on the bottom using parchment paper. I did not brush mine with buttermilk before baking, I will try that next batch !

I guess the only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars is more about my lack of baking skills than the recipe itself. I’ve tried this three times and although I’ve had results that we’re OK I just find that making buttermilk biscuits is probably not my thing. Getting the dough to have the right amount of moisture while not overworking it, but getting it to hold together and being able to fold it over from a rectangle three times etc. is just a little bit beyond me.  The flavor of the biscuits was great though; Henceforth the four stars. Level of difficulty is why I didn’t give it a  five. In fairness, chef John does say that you have to do this about a dozen times before you’ll get it right. I don’t have the patience for that. LOL

Exceptional!!  Excellent tender, crispy, flaky, buttery perfect biscuit!!

I used a whole stick of butter.  Well done!!  Make it a little thicker than half inch for less biscuits a little thicker.

You can't get much better than these! The only tiny change I did was add that whole stick of butter, instead of keeping out the 1 Tbs left. They rose high and have an amazing tender, fluffy, buttery taste & texture. The bottoms had a real thin, slightly fried like, barely crispy layer. Hands down the best biscuits I have ever had. It blows all the best restaurant biscuits out of the water! I mean it...a-b-s-o-l-u-t-e-l-y irresistible.

I don't make biscuits that often and forgot what my fav recipe is JP big daddy biscuit recipe on allrecipes is my favorite! These are ok just small and not as poofy as I prefer. You shouldn't have to make a recipe 12 times as it says in video. If you want big biscuits make 6  not 12 and leave thicker instead of rolling to 1/2 inch thick. Also I don't recommend food processor I've done it both ways and pastry tool will give you taller biscuits

Man, Chef John knows what he's doing! Everything of his that I make is FABULOUS. This recipe is a bit more work, because everything is cold. I even froze the bowl and all the ingredients except the buttermilk. Instead of cutting in the butter, I grated it and whisked. I did sift the dry ingredients also. I didn't have buttermilk, so I made my own (1 cup milk with 2 T white vinegar, refrigerated overnight, nice and bubbly). To get the most biscuits from the dough without overworking it trying to obtain the "extra" ones, I rolled the dough into a rectangle and then cut square biscuits using a putty knife. I like 'em big, so the yield was only 6. I baked them at 375? for 20 minutes, and they were perfect, evenly golden, with a nice rise. The crust is like biting into a puff pastry or croissant, soft inside but not airy. I will make these again.

Very good biscuits. Flavorful. Kind of dense, though. Maybe it's just the kind of butter I used.

I grated the butter and froze it before adding it to the flour.  This is beautifully flaky and perfect for an egg breakfast sandwich.

This is a classic biscuit recipe.  High, flaky, and delicious!  Just like Grandma, Mama, me and my daughter always made!  Love 'em with a little butter and preserves!

I was a Bisquick person before this recipe and my biscuits were always "meh."  Tonight I was out of Bisquick so I came upon this recipe from Chef John.  They were so good!  I keep powdered buttermilk on hand and I used it in this recipe by mixing with the other dry ingredients and then adding water for the liquid.  No more subpar biscuits for this girl. Thanks Chef John!

I actually baked the biscuits in my air fryer. They turned out great! I had a hard time keeping my husband out of them. He doesn't eat biscuits very often. He declared them fantastic and said I need to save this recipe. Way to go, Chef John!

We have a dairy allergy so I subbed regular crisco for the butter and coconut creamer with a tablespoon of lemon juice for the buttermilk. These are light and fluffy but not too much so. I did try with butter flavor crisco but in a side by side taste test all family members prefer the ones with regular crisco. I have also rolled and cut the dough and refrigerated overnight or frozen and cooked later. They don’t rise quite as high but close and the frozen ones take about 1.5 times the cooking time. I also used the dough to make a biscuit with a sausage baked in the middle and they turned out great. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Wow, great recipe! These look and taste just like Popeyes. I made my old buttermilk by adding a dash of lemon juice to the milk, and brushed with melted butter.

I have  made these buttermilk biscuits  for 3 time I do believe. I have to put my oven at 300 degree because my oven is very old same with my house. 1970's but  yes that were cooked all the way. But is say put you buttermilk biscuits bumping up to each other and that will rise straight  up no side ways. I was only get 7 biscuits. that because I use large biscuits circle brush buttermilk all over them start cooking and watching . Oh one more thing I forgot to tell you is that I use cookies sheet  tin foil and spray with butter pam little bit. just right

Very easy to make. I don't have a pastry cutter so I grated my butter as others suggested. Even the biscuits made from the scraps left over after cutting the first group ended up delicious and flaky.

I'm a beginner baker - very easy to make! I watched the  video which was very helpful, and I used the whole stick of butter like someone recommended. I forgot to brush on the buttermilk before baking, and they still came out great!

If you want this recipe to turn out right, you'll want to add a bit more buttermilk and use White Lily AP Flour (most important part).

I don’t know what I did wrong. I’ve made breads a ton of times before, bread, tortillas, naan, cornbreads, and cakes. These did not ride for me at all. I’ve been cooking for a long time so I’m really unsure what happened. I followed the recipe except adding the butter on top. Maybe that was it? I’ll try these again though.

Well I messed this up. It all went well until I accidentally put in 1 full cup of buttermilk. Ooops!  Oh well. I compensated by adding 1.5 tsp of sugar and of course more flour. Then when I was cutting a made it too thin and ended up with 15 biscuits!  Well no wants a flat biscuit so I redid about half of them and recut. Then because I had used up all my buttermilk I brushed with melted butter after they baked. Still came out delicious! The ironic part is the biscuits I didn’t remake were a little tough but the ones I remade, and this worked more, came out tender and fluffy!  The opposite of what I would have thought. But both tasted great and my family won’t notice. The moral of the story is that this is a forgiving recipe but watch that buttermilk!  By the way adding the sugar gave a slight sweet taste to biscuits as expected and was fantastic! I would recommend that modification.   Southern cooking requires sugar in everything.

I followed the recipe as best as is possible.  The butter we use is not marked as it is in the States, so there was a bit of guessing there as to if I was using the right amount.  Also, the counter top oven I use is fickle.  Consequently, the biscuits didn't raise much.  However, the taste is fantastic!  The texture is flaky on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside.  I will certainly use this recipe again.

Wow! The best biscuits I’ve ever made. The folding of the dough makes a big difference. The only change I made was to use my food processor to cut butter into flour mixture. Short pulses with processor made it quick and easy. Take care not to over do it when processing. Great recipe.

I made it exactly as written. Very good instructions. My family couldn’t believe it was homemade because of all the flaky layers. Opened right up for butter and jam. It took an extra 4 minutes to cook till golden brown.

These were ok, but not fabulous.  I tried them a couple of times because John said it takes some practice.  I make laminated dough fairly often so the technique was nothing new.  The biscuits were somewhat flaky, but not worth the effort involved.

This is an excellent recipe! My first time making biscuits (buttermilk or otherwise), and they turned out delicious! I did substitute lactose free milk and lemon juice (1 teaspoon for 1 cup of milk) for the buttercream. I can't say how it would compare to using actual buttercream, but it turned out really well! Thanks Chef John!

Good biscuits, turned out a little flat for me. Chef John is right, takes a few times to get it down. Biscuits were tasty so I'm going to keep trying.

Perfectly crispy, flaky & soft. Topped with eggs and Chef John's Mushroom Gravy for a hearty breakfast. I never have buttermilk on hand so I add 1 tbs. of vinegar to 1 cup of milk and let it sit for a few minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

Followed the directions and video exactly and they turned out just as I was expected! The video helped so much so I didn’t work the dough too much. I thought it was too salty but I used salted butter along with the recommended amount of salt. I’d reduce that by half next time.

The flavor and texture are fabulous. As long as you don't overwork the dough they turn out light, flaky and moist. These are so easy they will be my go-to biscuit!

Chef John, these biscuits are so delicious! I had to make a change because of my husbands health. He has to watch his salt intake and increase his fibre. Not to deprive him of biscuits, I changed the flour to whole wheat flour and added only 1/4 tsp of salt and used unsalted butter of course. Your method is what makes these biscuits so amazing. I have made so many of your recipes and have never been disappointed!

The best biscuits that I have made up to this point.  I followed the directions pretty much to the letter.  Maybe a smidge more butter or a table spoon more buttermilk but not much more than that.  I think that there is still room for improvement but I think that just comes from personal experience.

Delicious light & fluffy. Made these with rendered,  solidified, cold leaf lard, from local organically raised pigs, in place of butter. NO chemicals except the leaveners. Just perferfection!

This is an easy to follow recipe that works very well. In the procedure part of the recipe the only change that we made was to use the pastry cutter again after the buttermilk was folded in. The dough was not consistent enough just using the spatula, so a few more minutes with the pastry cutter made the dough more uniform. The biscuits rose nicely, had a light interior texture and crispy exterior with a mildly salty taste. We will make this recipe again.

Light, fluffy, and flaky, these are delicious and this has become my go to recipe. They have layers that are just as "grand" as a popular canned biscuit and are nearly as quick to make but taste just that much better and have a much nicer texture. I highly recommend giving this recipe a try.

Love these!!!  They are so flaky and delicious! I like to play with the sizes and thickness.  If you make them somewhat thin, you can pop them into the toaster the next day and they crisp up just like they’re fresh from the oven.  Thayer great in so many ways- from smothered with honey or for breakfast sandwiches. Theyre ALWAYS a win!

Great recipe.  I finally made great biscuits for Thanksgiving.  I made the dough a day ahead and froze it.  On Thanksgiving, I rolled it out, cut and baked and they came out perfect.  I also brushed a little melted butter on top. They came out soft on the inside and flaky on the outside and very tasty.  I also made two batches. Thanks for the video and recipe.

I'm a pretty serious cook, but am SO not a baker. I really love the old style buttermilk biscuits from my childhood. Not only did these taste great, they were perfectly flaky and easy enough that even I could make them. Keeping this recipe as my go-to. Thanks Chef John.

Finally, I followed the directions and carefully enough. We have lovely fluffy and layered biscuits. I'm taking a bow. I hear your clapping. Did it finally. Now to make more for family.

These were great and delicious also! In fact, I made them again right away—and rolled them out a bit thicker for extra puffy, flaky bisquits! Thanks, Chef John!

This is the second time I made these biscuits and as Chef John suggested, practice makes perfect. The biscuits were flaky but with a bit of crunch.....and sooooo good. Followed the recipe exactly.

This is the first time I’ve made “cut” biscuits and this is the only recipe I will use. I had a lot of fun with my first attempt:) I was a little overly confident, then thought I was screwing up, shrugged my shoulders and threw them in the oven anyway and they came out FANTASTIC!! Oh Chef, bless your heart for all your wonderful recipes and great commentary;)

I have made these buttermilk biscuits 4 times. The first 3 times they turned out tasty but did not rise. I knew I would get it right,  if I kept trying to get the knack of it. I made these biscuits again today. The only thing I did differently was to put the dough in the freezer after bringing it together and folding. Then I rolled out and cut into rounds. This time they turned out light and fluffy and high. I am so happy they came out perfect!

I’ve made these a few times. They are wonderful as biscuits and I’ve also used the recipe for a pot pie crust and it’s fantastic. Do be careful not to over work the dough. It’ll still taste good, but wont have the amazing flakiness.

These biscuits were absolutely delicious. I made a double batch and used to complete sticks of butter. Soft, battery, tender, great what’s the spread of jam, Florida with bacon and egg has a sandwich.You can’t go wrong with Chef John.

I've never made biscuits before and I'm glad I finally did. Mine aren't fluffy like the picture so I must have rolled them too thin... will have to make that adjustment next time. But they're still delicious!

Tasted great, didn't fluff. 
Used regular Bob's red mill flour... Is all I can think could have made the fail. I looked for another recipe, than mine, which was doing the same; now I need to up my baking powder, I guess. Any ideas?
5 stars since my own recipe failed.

Perfect!  I've made it as written, and have also substituted whey (from homemade yogurt) for the buttermilk.  They are delicious either way.

I have never made biscuits until today, & chose a recipe from Chef John because I’ve made so many of his recipes & they’ve all been terrific. Unfortunately this wasn’t one of those times, but I know it was something I did & not the recipe. They took much longer to bake then the recipe called for, & came out hard. They seemed very dry when I mixed them so I added a couple of extra tablespoons of buttermilk to bring it together. I will try again & would appreciate suggestions.

I think I'll end up memorizing this recipe from making it multiple times- it's definitely a keeper. I admit I did use a slightly different method when incorporating the butter into the flour mixture, just because it's a technique I'm used to and am comfortable with.  After cutting in the butter for a few minutes with a pastry cutter, when there were still small lumps of butter visible in the "coarse crumb" texture, I switched to using my hands. I picked up handfulls of the mixture and flattened the butter pieces into thin flakes by sliding one hand against the other. The end result is a crumbly mixture with small, flat pieces of butter coated in flour which helps create flaky layers (think rough puff pastry). I also used a full 1/2 cup of butter (because I didn't feel like measuring 7 tbsps).  Turned out great!

i've tried several biscuit recipes trying to find the best. I don't have to look any further..These are the bomb! I did roll them thinner than they should have been so they can only be even better next time when I make them a little thicker...

Excellent recipe! I followed the directions exactly and my muffins turned out gréât. Watching the video was like a cooking lesson. I did not know about folding the dough over and over again. I learned that this is what causes the flakey layers to develop. I was very proud of my little biscuits and would make them for company.  They turned out better than the biscuits you get at the "fried chicken restaurants". I did notice though, that my buttermilk did not have any of the little yellow dots like I saw in the recipe.  I do remember seeing buttermilk with little dots of butter years ago.  I will have to check on other brands. Thanks so much for the recipe. I can't wait to have some more muffins for breakfast tomorrow.

Each time I make this, it gets more refined.  Each time better than the last.  I put mixed all of my dry ingredients the night before and placed them in the freezer.  I did that on accident, because I didn’t have sausage thawed out like I thought.  Not sure if that was what changed or not, but these things got super tall and fluffy this time.  Note: I made this one time by substituting Bobs Gluten Free flour and they turned out better than any other gluten free biscuit I have had.  They weren’t fluffy of course, but they tasted good.  Thanks Chef John!!!

Just perfect. Moist and fluffy on the inside and just enough crispiness on the outside. I followed the recipe as written, and these ended up being the best biscuits I’ve ever made.

I thought this was delightful. I made one mistake. I used salted butter and the recipe asked for unsalted. The end result was a slightly saltier biscuit than I would have wanted. Solution- use unsalted butter and add the salt as stated OR use salted butter and omit the teaspoon as stated in the recipe. 

A keeper for sure.

My new go-to biscuit recipe.   One thing I did different,  was I almost froze the butter,  then instead of cutting it,  I grated right over the flour mixture with a course cheese grater.    Grate,  combine, grate combine until the butter was incorporated.   This seemed to keep the butter from getting mushed.  Biscuits were 1.5 inches tall after baking.

These were very simple to make and texture was almost perfect. Only thing I did differently was to use food processor to mix flour with butter.  My husband said these were the best biscuits I’ve made.  Definitely my go to recipe for biscuits.

These biscuits are easy and tasty but the first few times I made them I had problems getting them to rise despite following directions the best I could. Then I did my mixing in a food processor and they rose beautifully! Try it if you have the same problem!

Like so many others, I froze a stick of butter and grated it in.  So much easier that way.  Actually just semi froze one for 15 minutes because I was running short on time.  Cooked them in my cast iron skillet and a few minutes before they were done I hit the tops with a little melted butter.  This is a super simple, very good recipe that comes together fast.  Biscuits were flaky and while I didn't get quite the rise I wanted  they were delicious!

I had just made scones using buttermilk, and was looking for a recipe to use my leftovers... this recipe is actually exactly the same as the scones, except there's no sugar.
They are very good. When you eat them with jam, you don't miss the sweetness. And they're very good with cheese too!

Followed the recipe to the letter - something I don't normally do. The dough didn't come together well. They were flat and funny tasting. I've made other biscuits and didn't have the problems I had with this. Looked at the video were it said you would have to make it multiple times to perfect it. I'll just go back to the other recipe I found on this site. The biscuits came out fine on that one.

These are the best biscuits !! Just  perfect ! And extremely simple. Thank you for the video,  that helped with technique.( I used becel unsalted margerine (the new for baking pre portioned) instead of shortening or butter. I cut it up into pieces and froze it. It is very interesting that there is no sugar and I didn’t miss it either as a someone else said. I used all purpose flour, I  didn’t have any self rising flour. So use what you have on hand . Seems to me, what’s important is the buttermilk and technique .

I didn't have a pastry cutter or parchment paper so I improvised.  The biscuits didn't brown and didn't rise but except for being a little salty they were good.

I stirred the dough "just until it came together", as instructed, and I thought "Wow.  What a sticky mess!"  Having faith in Chef John, I carried on.  I used a floured piece of parchment paper to do the "folding" and these are some of the best biscuits I have ever made or eaten.  I highly recommend this recipe!

These turned out really well.  My downfall is not knowing for sure how thick the dough is when I roll it out.  My biscuits were not has high and fluffy as I like them to be.  I think it was due to rolling the dough out too thin.  Do any of you have tips on what I can do to make sure the dough thickness is correct?

I felt that these biscuits were a bit salty; perhaps using both baking powder and baking soda caused it., and I’m always leary of using both.  My husband also felt  they were salty, and I won’t be making them again. The dough was nice, but I think baking powder only and at least part lard is the way to go.

Great flavor. The dough seemed slightly dry so i added closer to a cup of buttermilk instead of 3/4. The key with biscuits for me is the handling of the dough. I used a food processor with a dough blade to pulse he dry ingredients and butter. I then turned into a shallow bowl and added the buttermilk and mixed gently  but only worked the dough till it just barely came together. It was still crumbly in parts. . turned out onto floured board and pressed into a circle (I didn't make the rectangle) with a wooden spoon dipped in flour.

Also I like biscuits a bit puffier so i only made 8 one inch  biscuits with a round cutter  and placed them touching side to side on the pan.  

The flavor was great. Will make again.

This recipe is the best. I was looking for a recipe for cheddar biscuits that didn’t use  Bisquik mix and found this recipe. I added the following to the batter, 3 oz shredded cheddar cheese, 1 tsp garlic, 1/8 tsp onion powder and 1/8 tsp parsley.  While searching through AR for a biscuit recipe I came across Cheddar Biscuits with Old Bay seasoning topping . I made a batch of the topping and brushed it on the hot, out of the oven biscuits.  So yummy. The hubs said they were the best biscuits I’ve  ever made. Thank you ChefJohn for sharing  your recipe. Thank you AR for being the best sight for recipe searches.

These biscuits are wonderful. Takes me back to my southern roots in Tennessee. After making them three times the only thing I changed was that I brushed them with butter instead of buttermilk before baking. Also, I couldn't find whole buttermilk so I had to buy low fat. I have to say it was great though. I don't know if the changes helped or the fact that I am more comfortable with the recipe. A must try if you love fresh, from scratch, biscuits.

Not sure if I did something wrong, as I followed the recipe and the video. Visually, these biscuits were BEAUTIFUL and really big with nice layers, but the flavor was bland and bready.  If I make it again, I may try to used salted butter versus the unsalted and instead of brushing the top with buttermilk...brush it with melted butter. Crossing my fingers that will at least remedy the bland, bready lack of flavor because I really want to like these biscuits when they look that pretty.

These biscuits have great texture.  They have a slight crispness on the outside with soft layers in the middle.  

I easily turned them vegan by substituting butter for Smart Balance (or any other vegan substitute) and making buttermilk from almond milk.  (Don't skip this step.  You'll need the acid from the vinegar for it to rise properly with the baking soda.)  For the vegan buttermilk, add 1 Tbsp of vinegar to 1 cup of non-dairy, unsweetened milk.  Wait 5-10 minutes and it will thicken and curdle.   With the vegan version, you will still get the flakey texture and buttery taste.  Follow the folding directions to create the flakey layers.  
Thanks Chef John!

I make these at least once a week. Perfect ratio of butter and flour (We like our biscuits buttery). I have used milk instead of buttermilk. I have cooked these in a cast iron and on a baking sheet and both turn out perfect. Instead of brushing buttermilk on the top I usually just spray the tops with cooking spray, it yields the the same results.

I have always fell flat at making biscuits but these were wonderful! I was very careful not to overwork the dough and I did not do his folding technique.  I will be making them again and again.

Once again, Chef John's techniques knock it out of the park. The folding technique he describes here is just what my biscuits needed. That, combined with the extreme hands off approach and chilling the butter in the freezer are key. I have never made a biscuit that was this beautifully flakey while still being soft. The crispness on the outside is perfect. Forget the celebrity chefs, my go to for the perfect recipe AND method is this guy. Check out his Crispy Pork Cutlet recipe. It has a spicy pickle gravy that is easy and absolutely delicious. It has become a regular in our dinner rotation.

This is a wonderful biscuit recipe. Slightly crunchy on the top and fluffy, buttery layers on the inside. It’s my new go-to biscuit recipe. Because I’m inherently lazy I grated the cold butter on a cheese grater before adding it to the flour mixture. Worked like a charm. Thank you for the recipe.

I used this recipe to make my 1st buttermilk biscuit and turned out really good, soft and flaky. But I modified the method, I didn’t rolled the batter, but only folded it about 5 times.

So made these for breakfast maybe 2-3 times a year I decide to make from scratch biscuits and gravy. Today was my day. I normally make drop biscuits but decided to give it a try. not too bad for the first try. I used powdered buttermilk 3/4 cup and a tablespoon more of water.  I rolled them too thin.
Otherwise tasted great.  odd dough out. don't re- roll the dough. I did roll it like a pun wheel to prevent over working. those turned out great.

A tip that I use it to grate the butter. 
Makes it flaky and layered. Amazing,  if they could get any better.

Great recipe! Was a winner in our household and didnt last 5 minutes. They were just so moist and delicious! One little trick i learnt that worked for me was to get the butter very very cold then grate it in, meant less handling and really made them come out great!

I made these for the second time this morning and they turned out great both times! When my wife pulled her biscuit apart this morning she claimed that it was "commercial worthy" with the perfect layers and steam rising. I followed the recipe exactly. My only complaint is the tops are a little pale.

Pretty good, and easy to make, though they do come out just a shade on the dry side. I've made this a couple of times now, and the second time I doubled the baking soda which worked way better I thought. One helpful tip: if you don't have buttermilk on hand, you can substitute white vinegar and normal milk in a 1:16 ratio. I've tried it both ways, and I find the two approaches indistinguishable.

My absolute favorite, and now ONLY, biscuit recipe I will ever make. I always have frozen butter anyway, so it's easy to take a sharp knife (carefully, of course) and get it to shred up perfectly. I always add the full stick (8 tbs instead of 7 tbs), and end up cutting the dough in 9 pieces. It's a very yummy, simple recipe to follow. It's really critical to layer as Chef John states - otherwise you end up with dense little hockey pucks instead of fluffy buttery biscuits. Yum, thanks for such a great recipe!!

These buiscits "tasted " fine, but they never rose in either batch I made. They were just dense pucks of biscuit. I don't know what I did wrong.  I followed the instructions verbatim. Maybe Yankees are just not meant to make a decent biscuit.

I loved how easy this was to put together and tasted pretty great too. I would however, not recommend rolling out the dough with a rolling pin. I thought the biscuits looked flat and when I hand patted my last few biscuits, I was happier with the more natural look and the expansion of the biscuit.

The video technique helped a lot. I chose to shred the butter as others suggested. The mixture as written seemed too dry for me as the ingredients would not stick together to allow me to move the dough from the bowl to the rolling area, so I added a few more tbs of buttermilk. I cooked for 15 minutes as written. Next time, I would cook a minute or do less as these seemed a bit dry to me. Good go-to recipe but I’m going to keep looking for another.

I liked this recipe. I won't call it incredible but it was good. The biscuits came out with a nice golder color. They were a bit crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Now, for the people who say that they came out flat, biscuit dough needs to be manipulated the least amount of time. Second, my tip to avoid dryness is to bake them close together. It will work. Bake them in two batches and close to each other and you will have very nice moist edges. I will still continue making the Never Fail Biscuits from this site which delivers an unbelievably delicious soft and fluffy biscuit. I will keep this one for sake of variety as they are crispy on the outside and fluffy buttery on the inside.

I had to make these in a 400 degree oven because I was also baking something else. I simply baked them a little longer , and they turned out wonderfully! Also ,I Shaped them by hand ,instead of using a biscuit cutter.

In my search for a perfect Biscuit , I tried this recipe.  It was OK, they did not cook fully, so the inside was dense, but well layered.  The buttermilk topping did not allow nice browning and crispiness of the tops.  The only parts I changed was I grated frozen butter into the flour, and placed the biscuits side by side to allow for the best rising, during cooking.

I found these did not rise very well and weren't as fluffy as I would like. Mind you, I do believe I made them too small. I will try another recipe next time.

having never made biscuits before this recipe seemed easy enough. I've made it twice now and yes the biscuuts have turned out great both times. I used the cheese grater suggestion to make incorporating the butter easier, however both times my dough was way too crumbly/dry to even attempt the folding technique. Not sure what I'm doing wrong. On my second attempt I even put the dry butter mixture in the freezer for about 20 minutes and increased my buttermilk. Baking isn't new to me, but this has me stumped.

I measured very precious and kept everything really cold. This is the first time I am happy with how my biscuits came out. The technique was perfect! Thank you. CHANGED: I exchanged unsweetened Almond Milk for cows milk but added a tsp. of Distilled White Vinegar to the Almond Milk. Tasted so good.  I didn't try the original but this way tastes so good I probably won't. I baked mine for 20 min.

These are wonderful! And so simple to do. I love biscuits and always hated my recipe.  I am so happy to find this one!  I did try it one time with whole wheat flour and they were much flatter - I suppose that's to be expected.

Thanks Chef John for a wonderful recipe. I  loved your easy instructions in the video and was able to make them right the first time. Fantastic and is now my go to recipe for biscuits, the only changes I make is to add 1/2 tsp sugar and I brush the cooked biscuits with melted butter vs the milk beforehand. 

Some tips for newbies: you can use a whole stick of butter and use regular milk or cream and just add 2 tsp of vinegar to make buttermilk. I use a food processor to mix ingredients, when I add the buttermilk I only do four pulses before I dump it out on the counter. Make sure to watch the video, the dough is supposed to be ugly looking with clumps of butter and flour and just barely holding together. This is what makes it crusty and flaky later. Yum yum yum!

During Hurricane Irma, my mother lost power at her home and she was hosting a disabled relative because of the evacuation. I had lost power as well but mine came back on a day before hers and I had to cook breakfast for two households with no access to the store. I had to use what was available. Thank God for this recipe. It was excellent!! Made sausage gravy and biscuits (along with bacon, potatoes and eggs).

HORRIBLE!  Absolutely terrible.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY,  but the biscuits turned out so bad that every bit went down the garbage disposal.  This recipe contains WAY too much butter.  It melted and dripped off the pan and onto the stove, smoked and turned on the smoke detector.  The biscuits themselves did not rise, despite the FRESH baking powder I purchased, and they were far too greasy to eat.  I've been baking biscuits for 45 years, but always with Bisquick, and they've always turned out perfectly.  (I had run out of the stuff, which is why I turned to this recipe instead.)  Needless to say, I'm returning to Bisquick from now on.  What a waste!  And now I have an oven to clean...

I used cold margarine because that's what I had and I used a fork to cut it into the flour and sour 2% milk. I used the lid from grated cheese container as a cutter. This recipe worked great. Yeild 12 biscuits.

I made these in no time at all and they turned out flaky, yummy and just a touch of crunchy. Thank you for such a great recipe.

First time making home made biscuits, I rate it a 5 as they did taste good, crunchy outside, flaky inside.

Amazing. Had to add about a tb more buttermilk to bring the dough together. Excellent crumb, tender and flaky.

These are easy and authentic southern buttermilk biscuits.  The only advice I have is to not pat the dough down very hard as you want layers of flaky biscuit.  I had to eat one right out of the oven and they are delicious!

This is an awesome recipe. In the summer I bake the biscuits on the outdoor grill using the same temperature and time. Just put three bricks under a heavy baking sheet or cast iron skillet to deflect the direct heat on the grill.

Such a great recipe for buttermilk biscuits.  Rich, moist, flakey, delicious.  Brushing the tops with a bit of buttermilk before baking gives them a bit of crunch as well.  Probably the best buttermilk biscuits I've ever made.  I made them as directed.

This was my second try at a Buttermilk Biscuit recipe and this one was a winner! The wet and dry ingredients together were too dry so I added extra milk (previous recipe was same way and biscuits were like crackers). I also mis-read the "brush tops with buttermilk" and used butter by mistake. But they were moist and flaky and I loved them.

Super easy biscuit recipe! I don't own a pastry scraper so I used a fork and my fingers but everything turned out just fine. Easy, few ingredients (I use wheat flour) and a yummy biscuit!

Yum! My 5yo has taken a liking to scones and similar so I have been trying out some recipes so she can have some in her school lunches. This is my favourite so far. I added a touch of sugar and cinnamon to the batter to give it sweet undertones, and it produced a lovely, light, bouncy biscuit. Split in two, topped with a spread of strawberry jam and eaten warm, these were divine.

I made these biscuits using the trick from another reviewer of combining 3/4cup milk with 2 T. Vinegar to make fake buttermilk.  I also used a vegetable peeler to peel the cold butter like a different reviewer suggested.  This worked really great.  Delish!

I try a different biscuit recipe every Saturday, in search of the best results. This one is the best I have found...rises well, fluffy with biscuit texture, flakey layers and a delicate crisp on top and bottom. I added garlic, parsley flakes and a bit of grated cheese. I probably could have given them another minute in the oven, but I like them to not get too brown on the bottom. Loved these, will make again!

I made them with one small procedural change. I used a grater and grated the butter before adding. Outstanding! Made them a second time and added a tablespoon of freshly chopped rosemary. Even better! 
This is now my one and only biscuit recipe.

SO GOOD!! I adjusted the recipe for only 6 and then put 4 tablespoons of butter and a third of yogurt instead of buttermilk. It was crazy sticky so I didn't attempt to roll it out and just plopped it on the tray and in 15 minutes they were soft and delicious!

According to the kids, this gets 5 out of 5 stars. I used whole wheat pastry flour and homemade kefir in place of the buttermilk. These are indeed flaky and browned nicely except for the top. I might brush more buttermilk on top next time.

O. My. These are wonderful!  Seldom go wrong with Chef John, these are over the top. I did have to add about two extra tablespoons of buttermilk to the dough, glad I did, it really needed it. The only other change was to cut the dough into squares as opposed to using a cookie cutter. No waste, no extra rolling out. The buttermilk on the top produces a little crunch.

Great recipe and the puff pastry styled folding technique makes for a flacky, layered biscuit!  Since this method leaves the dough already in a rectangle, rather than cut out rounds, I just sliced into biscuit squares.  This eliminates having to re-roll scraps which will be tougher than the first cuts.

Biscuits have never been a signature item I make. Never tall enough, too dry, crumbling, taste of baking powder. These are AWESOME! I did use my processor & made quick work of mixing. Turned out, patted, folded the 3x's, rolled & cut. Brushing the tops with buttermilk gave the nicest top. Next time, I believe I'll use a cutter bigger than 2 1/2". Love, love, love these!

Rather than cutting out the biscuits, I shaped the dough into a rectangle and cut it into 12 squares. That way, no dough was wasted and the dough was not handled as much. I thought? these biscuits would be hard and dry because of the texture of the dough after I was done kneading it, but they weren't! Amazing recipe!

Didn't have any buttermilk so made my own. Teaspoon of white  distilled vinegar per cup of milk and refrigerate for 5 minutes. These biscuits came out better than I had hoped.  Thanks Chef John for another winner!

They are crispy on the outside, very fluffy, super tender and  excellent flavour. The other  two times I added one egg to the buttermilk and one tablespoon of white sugar to the dry ingredients. These small additions just kick up the flavour profile a wee bit. 
Two thumbs way up again Chef John!

It w was probably me. I like to roll and probably did too much and too thin. They came out very dense and thin, will try again because they were good.

Excellent recipe! Very good as presented, next time we'll cut the salt by half and see how it goes. We only had salted butter on hand and could probably forego the extra salt altogether. Also, we didn't have buttermilk so we put 1 Tbs. white cider vinegar in the milk, let it set ten minutes, and it turned out great. Thanks!

These are great.  First time I have made biscuits that turned out as they should.  The only thing I did differently is roll them out thinner. This gave me 14 biscuits.  I do not think I would have gotten 12 servings if I had rolled them out according to directions.  I will make these again for sure.

These are AMAZING biscuits. They have the perfect texture and they're really easy to make. Do follow all the directions closely, and don't overmix. If you don't have biscuit cutters and you're using a cup or something to cut them out remember not to twist as you're cutting through the dough, it creates a vacuum and they won't rise as well.

I've always be hesitant to make biscuits, afraid they wouldn't be flaky enough or bland. Oh my was I wrong. Didn't change a thing and these were great. Didn't use a rolling pin, turned the dough out onto a floured surface and used my fingers to pat our the dough, folded into thirds a few times and just patted the dough. It was so easy and the biscuits were so flaky. They were light and layered due to the folding of the dough. Will definitely make these again and again!!

These biscuits have the most amazing flavor.  But, for some reason, I can't seem to get them to rise.  I'm not sure what the issue is but they come out like little hockey pucks.  I keep making them because they taste so good.  I am not sure if the error is with the recipe or myself.

these are sooooo light, fluffy and tender. Really nice flavour, brushed buttermilk on top with thumbprint gives nice look and slight  browning. If you like soft crowd the pan, otherwise space as usual for biscuits and they will crisp up on outside a little more. These will be my only biscuit recipe from now on. Freeze them, defrost and they are still wonderfully soft.

Luckily I read the whole recipe first. The buttermilk listed in the ingredients is not what you need to make the biscuit.
They turned out great, but someone unfamiliar with baking may get confused.

Easy recipe.  I freeze some before brushing with milk and pull out as needed.  Didn't have buttermilk.  Added several drops of lemon juice.  Let milk stand on the counter for a few minutes then into the freezer to chill up again.  When pushed for time I don't cut the butter in as long and alway regret it...still yummy but if you take the time with the butter it's worth it.

My biscuits came out a bit flat, but I am sure it is baker error and not recipe.

I am a biscuit novice but the video was very helpful to get an idea of the technique. Delicious use for the leftover buttermilk from making Chef Johns fried chicken.

Excellent biscuits!  I wanted to add a different flavor so I included 1/4 of sugar. Since it had more dry ingredients than called for, I added a little more buttermilk. They turned out great!!

I made two batches of these biscuits for Thanksgiving.  The first batch came out overdone and flat.  For the second batch, I froze the butter for a while and then baked them for 12 minutes instead of 15.  They were done perfect, more flaky , but still FLAT!  I typically love everything I make of Chef John's, and though these were flavorful, I just couldn't serve them for my family dinner.  I went back to my standard drop biscuits instead.

This recipe and technique is absolutely fool-proof. I love the tri-fold pastry technique when pressing the dough because it produces such great layers in the end product; and, brushing the tops with buttermilk is a perfect way to create a lightly-browned top without making them greasy. I never have buttermilk in the house so I made my own by adding a couple teaspoons of white wine vinegar to milk, and I didn't have any unsalted butter so I used some really good English butter and didn't add any salt. This will be my go-to biscuit recipe from now on!!

Whenever I have made biscuits in the past they are always beautiful but inedible - like lovely rocks. I sliced and chilled the butter just like Chef John said.  I cut in the butter with my pastry blender without twisting, as another reviewer suggested. I stirred in the buttermilk until just combined - until I didn't see anymore pools of buttermilk - and stopped stirring. I followed Chef John's instructions on folding the rectangle into thirds, then gently rolled out the dough. The only change I made was I cut the biscuit dough with a knife because I was afraid to manipulate the dough scraps after using a biscuit cutter.

I baked only two biscuits because that was all I needed. I froze the remaining biscuits before baking as another reviewer suggested. To cook the frozen biscuits, I preheated the oven to 425°F, brushed buttermilk on the tops of each, and baked for 15 minutes. The frozen biscuits were just as light and yummy as the fresh ones. I placed the frozen biscuits so that they were touching, and they did rise higher than those that didn't touch. My husband loves biscuits and gravy. My gravy is killer - now my biscuits are, too. Thank you, Chef John!

I tried this recipe 3 times, and didn't rise. They didn't taste good. The first time I made these, they were flat and looked like tortillas. I feel like I'm just waisting my ingredients.

I will definitely make these again!!!  I too followed the recipe and found it a smidge dry..just added a little more buttermilk.  Next time though, I will let the dough rest  a little before rolling it out....much more fluffier end product I found!  Thank you for the recipe

These dinner rolls are soooo much better than regular 'ole dinner roles. Yes, they're slightly more work ....but worth it!
I've made these dozens of times now and they're always a hit. Throw in some herbs and they're even more delicious.

I've tried this recipe before and never had beautiful biscuits like chef john. Today I tried again and didn't roll my dough out. Instead I pressed it and cut my biscuits thick! They turned out perfectly golden and flaky and beautifully layered!

Just finished making these and they are great! Flaky, moist and tasty. I don't have a pastry cutter so I just used my hands to break up the butter in the flour.  First time ever making biscuits from scratch and very happy with how they turned out!

They didn't turn out as high and flaky as I would've liked. I used a Mickey Mouse cookie cutter because my wife loves Z Mickey Mouse. I'll update my review after my family ties them.

The folding and "kneading" process in this recipe is key.  Take the time to fold and pat the dough in the way the recipe states and you will have the fluffy moist biscuits promised.

fantastic recipe!  Easy and a great way to finish leftover buttermilk. The coating on top makes them glossy and lovely.  Followed the tip of using the vegetable grater to slice the butter.  Genius!!

What could be easier than making biscuits, right?  Not necessarily so, for me, that is!   It was the frozen butter in this recipe that was the turning point.  I tend to over-knead-> warmed up butter!  With these two improvements, the results couldn't have been better!  I'm now biscuit makin' machine!  Thanks for the video-very helpful.

Easy to make and delicious!  I use the food processor to cut in my refrigerated butter into my flour mixture.  Didn't have buttermilk on hand so just added 1 tablespoon of vinegar to my milk and let it sit for 5 minutes.  These turned out perfect!

I tried this twice and they did not rise either time, nor did they taste very good. I substituted the buttermilk for almond milk + lemon juice.

AWESOME!!!!!!  These are the best biscuits I've ever had!  The folding technique Chef John teaches is just awesome.  It's one of those things you just have to see done and then you get it!  I did make a few changes, I used a full 1/2 cup of FROZEN butter, grated with a cheese grater.  I also added 2 tbsp. of sugar.  I've also found you get the best rise if just after you mix it up, you GENTLY pat it into a rough ball or mound, wrap it in plastic wrap sprayed with vegetable spray and then pop it in the fridge for a couple of hours. Then pull it out, do the folding technique, then cut out your biscuits.    Oh I also brushed the tops with melted salted butter (no substitutions) before and after they were baked.  I then whipped up some breakfast sausage gravy and WOW!  Best biscuits and gravy I've ever had.  These biscuits are tender and then crunchy in just the right spots.  Even though they are tender, they do hold up to gravy.   If you can make a good pie crust by hand, you can do this.  It's a very similar technique when cutting in the butter and adding the liquid.  You want to toss it together, NOT stir.  You will feel like a chef when you make these awesome little babies!!!  One final tip, if you make your mound to cut from rectangular and then cut square biscuits, you don't have any waste and they ALL turn out with the same awesome texture!

Best biscuit recipe I've tried so far!  Only part I skipped was the buttermilk brushing over the top.  I froze butter and grated it like another reviewer suggested - so easy.  It seemed dry when I was forming it to cut, but it turned out perfect.  I made these as a side for a big breakfast but wound up only eating these with just a bit of butter and honey.  I could have eaten the whole batch - but didn't - this time.  Thanks Chef John!!

I love Chef John's recipes, no exception here. I did grate my butter and set it in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes before incorporating. Makes everything go together much quicker and keeps the end product flakey.

I didn't measure the buttermilk; I just eyeballed it. I think I probably added more than the recipe called for and they turned out perfect! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They pull apart in tender layers too.

I have made these several times.  I take butter out of the freezer and grate it with a box grater, no other changes. The folding and turning proces gives you the layers.  When you turn the dough out of the bowl it is an unincorporated mess.  By the third turn, it is smooth as silk.  I pat it out into a rectangle and cut it into square biscuits, no waste.  Great recipe!

After trying countless recipes for buttermilk biscuits I hesitated to try this one. I bit the bullet and used my fingers to break up the very hard cold butter into the flour mix. Using lemon juice to make my own buttermilk and a tad less flour than stated I reluctantly rolled the dough out and cut it  six large circles. Then dough seemed a bit stiff  to me but I placed them on a parchment paper lined cookie tray and popped them in the oven crossing my fingers. The result? A slightly crispy outside and layered buttery flaked inside. The butter made my entire kitchen smell heavenly! As long as you make sure the butter and milk is freezing cold this is certainly the most incredible biscuit you can make. I should know my boyfriend is from North Carolina! Blessed be!

I didn't make any changes and would make again. 
Just a few tips of my own for those that may have problems: Keep the butter cold so the fat doesn't break down (so don't use your hands). Don't overwork your dough or you'll get the tough, hard biscuits you are trying to avoid.  Don't roll your dough with a pin, but press it out with your hands. Don't twist your cutter when you cut because this will seal the edges and you won't get a good lift, making a denser, flatter, and tougher biscuit. Finally, don't ever use a glass or cup to cut biscuits because this too will seal the edges and prevent the flakiness and lightness that you're looking for.
As for the recipe, I LOVE that it can stand on it's own and tastes like a great biscuit.  Most biscuits are used as flavor holders.  For example, eating a grape jelly biscuit with a "whop it on the counter biscuit" or other recipes, you basically eat grape jelly held together with flavorless dough.  This recipe, you'd get a great biscuit flavor with grape jelly added. The flavor of this biscuit is devine!  LOVE IT!

I selected this recipe for a meal in my culinary class, it turned out great, I froze the butter before using it, and if you don't have buttermilk you can substitute it by mixing together milk and vinegar

This is the way I have made them for years and years. My g and other made them this way too. I found this recipe and used it and am quite pleased. The only difference is we always just used milk, not butter milk. I love the butter milk version.

I stopped looking for buttermilk biscuit recipes once I found Chef John's and I have been making it for years.  No changes or substitutions are needed.   Wonderful and so easy to make.  Thank you Chef John.

My resulting dough was pretty dry and they did not rise at all - they were like little discs.  Still good.

Great recipe. I am not a great biscuit maker and I have been told it takes practice. I didn't change anything in the recipe. The biscuits weren't the prettiest but they tasted wonderful. I was using for biscuits and gravy so looks didn't matter.

Hallelujah! Finally after years of attempting good, tender biscuits, I made these and they are great-just as Chef John said! I used dry buttermilk powder with cold water rather than buttermilk (following directions on powder container). I froze extras for later. Yum. Thanks, Chef!

These were super awesome and will be my go-to for buttermilk biscuits. If you don't have buttermilk you can just add 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar to your milk. Let it sit to "curdle" for 5-10 minutes. I also used lactose-free, fat-free milk (as I do in all of my baking) and it came out perfect. I wouldn't change anything BUT I look forward to modifying this recipe to a savory one for holidays.

My go-to biscuit recipe - comes together quickly and tastes great! I follow the recipe exactly as written - it blows the refrigerator biscuits in a can that I used to use, out of the water. Biggest take-away: do not twist the biscuit cutter (which I used to do) - straight down and straight up to get all the flaky layers!

Finally, I have found my forever biscuit recipe & prep method!! As always, Chef John makes it simple to get amazing results. The frozen butter is KEY. The only change I made was to make my own buttermilk (1C milk +1Tbsp white vinegar). These were picture perfect & the most delicious biscuits I've ever made. Will have to get a photo next time though...by the time the idea occurred to me, they were all long gone!

Delicious! I didn't have buttermilk, so I squeezed the juice from one small lemon into my measuring glass and filled it with 2% milk to the 3/4 cup line. I also used an egg wash on top. These are easily the best biscuits I have ever made! I strongly recommend watching the video to see how he handles the dough.  You have to start folding the dough when it is not fully together and  dough-like. Thanks, Chef John! You are the best! :)

I have to say the video Chef John provided made a believer out of me for the method to produce flakey LAYERED biscuits. I know now his recommendation of stopping the mixing of the ingredients before you feel it's time, and allowing the final mixing to be completed during the folding over process is the key to lighter, flakier biscuits. I was skeptical about stopping the mixing in the bowl before I felt the dough to be ready, but I forged ahead as per the video......and the dough turned out exactly as John said it would.  I also used my food processor to pulse the ice cold butter into the dry ingredients, taking care to stop while the bits of butter were still visible. The ingredient measurements and baking times were spot on. The biscuits came out tender and flakey with layers of buttery goodness. Hubby loved them hot and once cooled,  they keep well to split and toast the next day.  These are easy to make and have become "My" biscuit recipe.

I mixed together the dry ingredients and butter, then froze it. When I was ready to have biscuits, I took out half the dry mix, added half the buttermilk, and baked a small batch. They were very good. A week or so later, I used the the second half of the mix, adding a bit of cinnamon, dusting the rolling surface with sugar and flour, and folded some dried cranberries into the dough. I glazed them with an orange icing. Wonderful!

The flavor is fantastic. The folding gave these lovely flakey layers. My preschooler literally pounded his little fist on the table and yelled "these! Are! Yummy!" However the darn things didn't rise. I follow directions and did NOT twist the cutter so idk but they were good and I'll try it again.

These biscuits are OUTSTANDING.  I made them last night and was quite pleased with the results.  I watched the video and followed the recipe exactly as written; with NO modifications or changes.

I used real buttermilk, not the milk with vinegar method or the powdered stuff.  I've used both of these types of buttermilk before but real buttermilk just makes a world of difference.  And best of all; you can FREEZE the leftover buttermilk into any amount of single size serving you need.  Just thaw the amount of buttermilk you need for your next recipe.

My biscuits turned out exactly as pictured; FLAKY and TALL.   

This will be my one and only biscuit recipe.

THANK YOU...THANK YOU...THANK YOU Chef John

I made these in a dorm kitchen which limits me greatly and was worried about my only loosely cut-in butter and lack of space to shape and fold the dough. With some improvising I was able to make what turned out to be really good biscuits despite us all saying "forget it" and winging it on half the steps. 
Very easy and delicious. We forgot to brush the buttermilk on top and it was still fine.

I cheated and used self-rising flour so I could omit the baking powder and baking soda.  The biscuits still turned out nice and flakey.  Chef John hasn't let me down yet when it comes to breads.

Working with frozen butter was not fun at all. I found the biscuits to be dry and bland. I won't be making them again.

I have used my Mom and Grandmothers biscuit recipe for 30 years with not one complaint but I was wanting to try something different so I came across Chef John's recipe and tried it. AMAZING!   Flakey with perfect texture. I have retired my old biscuit recipe for a while.  And I have added a lot of Chef John's culinary creations to my favorites.

These were the best looking biscuits I've ever made.  This is the first time I've used the roll and fold method for making biscuits.  Turned out amazing.  Fluffy and flaky.  Also, I used my fingers to rub the butter into the dry ingredients, rather than cutting the fat into the dry ingredients.  It was a very sticky dough for a biscuit dough.

I tried these tonight and six out of twelve turned out great and the six I rolled a little to thin but still I kept a  close eye on them in the oven so they wouldn't over cook.  They turned out pretty good.  They were soft and the family loved that I made fresh biscuits :)  I'll keep working with this recipe because I'm sure each time I'll get better and better at it.

I usually make my own biscuit recipe, but wanted to try something new using buttermilk.  This was a very good recipe, the outside was slightly crispy on the edges, but the inside rather tender and soft.  I did add a little bit of sugar to my recipe because I like mine to have a hint of sweetness.  All in all, they were very good.

Easy and delicious!! Made exactly as per the recipe. My only issue, and it was my mistake, was that I rolled it out too thin but the biscuit still had layers , were fluffy, and tasted delicious.

I've never, ever made biscuits before today. I gre up eating them every morning when my grandma stayed with us over the summers. This biscuit recipe beat granny's for sure! Flaky, buttery goodness! I used the food processor and near frozen butter.

NOTE: To anyone that thought these biscuits were dry or too salty, make sure you are using unsalted butter and make sure your oven has been calibrated. 
I usually make biscuits with self-rising flour because every time I try  making them with baking powder (different recipes) they always seem heavy and flavorless. Today I didn't have any self-rising so I decided to give it one more shot. I knew I could trust Chef John! These biscuits are moist, light, flaky, and tasty. I followed the recipe to the letter. Next time I'll add just a tad more buttermilk  because the dough still tried to crumble even after the third fold.

I used half AP and half whole wheat flour. I also added cheese and minced onion. They came out awesome! I've NEVER made a decent batch of biscuits before these.

I've made these a lot!  I always use 1 cup of buttermilk and freeze my butter prior to adding it.  Amazing!   Add some cheese and top melted butter with parsley and garlic powder for red lobster style.  So Good!

I didn't change a thing and they came out perfectly! Next time I'll use a bigger cutter to make it better for breakfast sandwiches. The 2-1/2" cutter size are slider size and it makes 12 perfectly. I will be adding this to my breakfast favs for sure!

I made these and they came out quite good. They didn't have much of a buttery taste so I might add just a little bit more next time, but other then that they came out flaky and delicious.

I grated the butter with a large hole grater and used slightly more buttermilk than the recipe called for.  The biscuits were delicious but a little crunchier on the outside than I would have preferred.

This is a great recipe for flaky biscuits. It has no crazy/hard to find ingredients, and comes together quite quick.

The only thing I did different from the recipe is grate my cold butter on a box grater, then let the shredded butter chill further before adding it to dry ingredients.

I only baked off about half of the biscuits and froze the other half, which I will bake at a later time and report back on how they did!

This recipe is perfect.  I'm a self-proclaimed biscuit connoisseur  and have never found a recipe that rivaled my South Carolina grannie's buttermilk biscuits.  Until now.  Perfect biscuits every time!  Just be sure to use unsalted butter as the recipe states or else they will be a bit on the salty side.

This was an easy and amazing recipe. I only added an extra tablespoon of butter. So it was a total of 8 tblspn. All that was left of the stick. It was so good.

This is such an amazing recipe. The biscuits come out very crunchy and delicious. They are a little buttery, but that is what makes it really good! I recommend this recipe to everyone!

Ran out of buttermilk so I brushed the tops with regular milk.  Biscuits have a light crispiness on the outside, light and tender on the inside.  Just perfect.  Found my new biscuit recipe!

No changes were needed.  Barely kneaded it except for when I folded it three times.  Husband said these are the best biscuits.  Coming from him speaks volumes.  Making them again right now per his request.  Great recipe, Chef!

I'm disappointed. I followed the instructions to a T, doubling the recipe, and not only are these biscuits bland, but they didn't rise much. In fact, the first tray shrunk in diameter, and I wasn't able to cut 24 biscuits from the doubled recipe. The second tray only had about 7 biscuits on it. Those, I rolled out to almost 2" thickness. They came out only a little better looking.

Loved them! I've tried to make biscuits before but they were either too dry or not flaky or hard on the bottom.  I made Chef John's biscuits following each step on the video. I made them exactly as stated on the recipe. I baked them on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. They're flaky and buttery delicious. They are the best biscuits I have ever tasted and I made them!! I have finally found biscuits worthy enough for Christmas breakfast! (p.s. My husband ate 6 !)

Hands down the best biscuits we have ever tasted, at home or in a restaurant. We don't have a pastry cutter so I just worked the butter in by hand, and it worked just fine. I also used regular butter (not unsalted), but we are huge butter & salt lovers around here so that probably made them even better.  So excited to have found such an easy and delicious and FAST biscuit recipe, I can't wait to throw out all the other failed biscuit recipes I've collected over the years!

Fantastic! These can be frozen (uncooked) 
on a pan then put in freezer ziplock bags and you will have delicious biscuits whenever you need them. Brush with buttermilk just before putting in the oven.

This was a very good recipe. I used ½ the salt and added about ¼ cup more buttermilk than it asked for. I also added a small handful of mixed berries to the centre of each one. They were delicious and very moist. My company loved them.

My biscuits were super easy and delicious! I placed all of my dry ingredients into my kitchen aid mixer with the whisk attachment, when i needed to cut in butter I used a fork since my pastry blender was nowhere to be seen. Then I made the space in middle poured in buttermilk using same attachment until I had a dough. :)

Omg so good. I grated the butter with a grater but it was messy. Next time I would try one viewers suggestion and grate in food processor. I baked on a hot pizza stone but next time will use a cast iron skillet  I wolfed down three with honey. I saw some viewers suggested freezing the biscuits. I wonder how they lasted long enough to freeze.  they taste best warm from the oven.

I've always had trouble making biscuits so have shied away from them.  They were always hard as rocks!  This recipe was so easy and quick and they tasted yummy with honey and butter!  My husband loved them.  I made no changes whatsoever but I remembered after eating that my daughter-in-law, who makes the best biscuit ever, always put the flower and butter back in the freezer for about 15 minutes.  Next time I will do that.  I love Chef John!!!!

The flavor and texture seemed similar to a mcdonalds biscuit..which my husband was ecstatic about lol. I did wish they had risen a bit more as they seemed to not grow much in the oven.  I will keep messing with it and try more baking powder next time.

I always know that when I'm making a Chef John recipe it will be a hit!  No different for this one. I made the biscuits exactly as the recipe states and they're beautiful and delicious. I love a biscuit that I can peel layers off of and this biscuit does it for me! I brushed the tops with melted butter when they came out of the oven and ate TWO of them hot.  I will definitely make them again and use the freezing tips found in some of the reviews.

No need to look any further for a perfect biscuit, this is the only recipe you will ever need! 
Awesome, high-rising, flaky, buttery rich flavor! What more could you want in a biscuit?
Follow directions exactly and you won't be disappointed.

For years I've been searching for a biscuit recipe to emulate the wonderful country-style biscuits from Cracker Barrel or KFC, and I think I've found it. These are very buttery and flaky and not at all hard to make. The folding technique really sets these biscuits apart! I followed the recipes to the letter (except mine had to bake about 20 minutes until they browned) and the results were wonderful.

The only "problem" with this recipe is that you need to double it! :) They're soooo tasty!

I ended up using about a cup of buttermilk instead of suggested 3/4 c and folded an extra turn.   Video is exceptional to really see best way to make flaky biscuits.

This is my go to biscuit recipe.  My only modification is that I make it in the food processor - being careful not to over process.  

If you add about 1/4 c sugar (or less according to your preference) this also makes a wonderful shortcake for strawberry shortcake.

I wanted a basic buttermilk biscuit recipe and this is it.  I don't brush the buttermilk on top but that doesn't change the flavor.  These are soft, flaky and delicious!

These are nice and fluffy biscuits. I make a few minor modifications, primarily due to availability of ingredients where we live. Buttermilk is practically nonexistent in our corner of the globe, so I use whole yogurt without any added sugar in the same proportion. I also add some grated cheese right after I blend in the butter, just to add a bit of character. About the only thing I ever liked at Red Lobster was their biscuits (way back in the day -- never go there anymore) and likes the little bit of cheese flavor they had. I also had some incredible biscuits several years ago at a place called the Blue Plate Cafe in Memphis. They were light, fluffy, and melt-in-your-mouth good. These remind me a great deal of those. I've had numerous requests for them over the years. Wonderful recipe.

I only had salted butter so I cut the salt in half.  I also grated my frozen butter into the flour stirring a few times to mix it in and keep it from sticking together.  By the time I was done grating the butter, I only had to stir it one last time before adding the buttermilk. So quick and easy.  These were light, flaky, and not dry at all even though I over cooked them a bit.  Excellent recipe.

Great recipe! I just made these this morning. I didn't change anything except as you can see the shape. I didn't have a round cutter so I used a knife and just cut square shapes. The extra dough became my big biscuit. I used my Ninja blender to cut the dough into the flour. I was worried that it wouldn't do well but because the butter was frozen it came out perfect. I just did really quick pulse. I mixed the buttermilk in the bowl with the flour mixture. Flaky on the inside and just a little crunch on the outside Delicious. I will definitely make again and also recommend.

Very good.  I thought the biscuit might be to thin but they puffed up beautifully.  Kept the leftovers for 24 hours and still delicious.

If you follow the instructions to the letter, you will be very pleased with flaky and buttery homemade biscuits! They need to be eaten the same day as freshness is very important to the taste. The next day I had a few left over and, while they were good to eat, these buscuits are just plain incredible right out of the oven!

Great biscuit recipe, since we do not have a pastry slicer I had to hand press the flour mix with the butter slices to form the crumbled dough but all in all the recipe was easy and they tasted better than most restaurants could hope for!

Made these this morning with Bill's sausage gravy recipe that is on this site.These were absolutely fantastic! Right on up there with cracker barrel's! This is definitely my go to recipe. Did not change a thing. Not dry at all! Very moist, soft, a bit of flakiness just the way a biscuit should be. I will be making these again with some honey drizzled over them :)

I had to add an extra splash of milk but the moisture in flour varies so that doesn't mean that everyone will need it. I have made dozens and dozens of biscuits in my life. My mother made heavenly drop biscuits so I frequently do that but I made these to top a chicken and biscuit casserole. They are beautiful! Think I've found my go-to biscuit recipe.

I kinda messed them up by pulling them out of the oven 5 minutes in to do the dimple and brush the buttermilk (I'd forgot). Up until that point they were rising good but did not rise anymore from there. They were a bit flat, not fluffy because of this but no less crumbly or good. I wish I had left them alone but you live and you learn. The flavor was still great so I give them 5 stars despite my mistake, I have no doubt it would have been amazing when done right and I will definitely make these again.

they rose beautifully and came out fluffy and golden which was great, BUT the flavor wasnt very good. i think it needed more salt maybe. honestly it might be my fault entirely by using reduced fat buttermilk. i will try this recipe again with regular buttermilk, a tad bit more salt or salted butter and i will be sure to re-review.

Tried this recipe this morning and used the food processor like one reviewer suggested.  Put the biscuits right next to each other as another reviewed suggested, and they rose beautifully.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The first biscuit recipe I have been really successful with.  So excited to finally find the perfect recipe.  We did use all fresh ingredients just purchased (unbleached all purpose flour, baking powder and soda).  Now I can offically call myself a cook!

Light and fluffy !!  I grated frozen butter so no need to blend just stirred. Also used whole wheat flour just for fun.  Enjoying now with maple syrup and a hot cup of coffee.  Oh so delicious on a cold Canadian morning...

I had to try these twice to get a good result. The first time I was too afraid to work the dough and I rolled them too thin. Try two I just worked the dough like I typically do for biscuits and I patted them out to about 3/4" instead of rolling. Much, much better. Maybe next time they'll even be better.

These have great flavor! I brushed too much buttermilk on each one. Other than that, they were perfect. This is my new standard buttermilk biscuit recipe. Thanks for sharing and thanks for the video.

Followed this recipe exactly.  I used my food processor since it was recommended by another reviewer - so glad I did.  This recipe was so quick and easy.  Talk about a great recipe.  My biscuits turned out great!  They tasted great also!

Thanks, highly recommend this recipe.  We will be making these again!  Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow and the next day :P

Chef John, this is the absolute BEST biscuit recipe I have ever tried.  It reminds me of the biscuits my grnadmother used to make.  She mixed them in a bowl and squeezed them out by hand.  It was a work of art I witnessed watching her.  And they were so light they melted in your mouth.  Chef John you have knocked this one out of the park.  These biscuits took me back to my Grandmothers house!  What a delicious gift on Christmas Eve!   Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

Great recipe! I followed the recipe, sans the parchment paper, and they turned out just right. They have a wonderful flavor, a crispy outside, and a flaky inside.

This recipe works great everytime (so long as you don't overcook them!)! I've used whole milk when I don't have any buttermilk and it's not quite as good but they still get gobbled up! I've also used this recipe to make cup shapes as a base for different dishes baked in a muffin tin by rolling it out very thing and they still end up as a flaky crust. It's also an easy recipe to remember so it's a great go-to!

This was my very first time ever trying and exactly following  a recipe let alone a biscuit recipe and let me tell you.... "IT WAS A SUCCESS" It was bit frightening when I turn the ,not so moist dough, onto the table to kneed it into shape but I persevered.  I baked them this morning and I felt so proud of myself when I served my family warm fresh biscuits with scrambled eggs.  Thank you so much Chef John.

These biscuits were wonderful!  I took another users advice and used a food processor to mix the butter in rather than cutting it in.  This is my new "go-to" biscuit recipe!

Taste was outstanding. Not dry at all, perfect.Easy to make. I did it really quickly and didn't use a round cutter. I just cut the dough into 12 pieces. I posted a picture. I also thre it into a stand mixer. I'll try it again when I have more time to spend. I have no doubt I could get taller biscuits if I took more care in mixing, rolling and folding.

I had to make this twice to get it right. The first time the dough was too dry. The second time I increased the amount of buttermilk to 1 cup. Also, on the second try, instead of cutting up the butter, I used a cheese grater and grated the cold butter into the dry ingredients. If you use this method, be sure to coat the butter shreds with the dry ingredients so they don't clump together. Second try was much better! I still need more practice, though.

Whipped up a double batch of these beautiful buttermilk biscuits. Chef John, you never let me down. I watched the video to make sure I had a handle on the technique. My husband and daughter loved them; my grandfather proclaimed that surely the way to a man's heart is paved with these biscuits. The only change I made was to instead of cutting rounds and handling the dough that much more I used a pizza cutter to slice equal sized squares. Who says biscuits have to be round?

Well, ICE COLD is certainly the secret! After years of tasty but rather flat biscuits, my family -and I- was pleasantly surprised by the lightness of these babies.

Great recipe! I've made it to the letter and variations with cheese and garlic (add an extra two Tbsp of milk and a cup of shredded cheese and garlic to taste) and it always comes out flaky and tender.

fan-frickin-tabulous!

I followed the recipe as written, except I accidentally added an extra tablespoon of butter (one stick total) to the dough.  They turned out beautiful, tender, and tasty!

These biscuits didn't rise much, but they were still delicious. (Coulda been my fault about the not rising part.)

My family loves these. I fold the dough a bit more, then roll out to 1/4 then pinch two together, so when done the split easier for little fingers.

I have tried various biscuit recipes, but this is the one that finally resulted in what I want in a biscuit. The folding method gave me those flaky layers that I've always had trouble with. Will make this my go-to biscuit recipe from now on!

These were wonderful. As someone who has never done a biscuit more complex than a Bisquick drop biscuit, I thought I was being ambitious by trying this homemade biscuit for the first time. I'm pretty experienced in the kitchen but recently trying to expand by doing things like my own pie crusts and now biscuits (things that can be ruined being overworked)...it turned out fantastic! My only word of advice it not to fear your dough being under-worked. Chef John's video is a wonderful guide. I always freeze half my butter when I buy it (Costco) and it works well when doing biscuits (AND pie crusts for that matter). They didn't seem to rise much but I made them pretty small, next time I will double the recipe and roll my dough out thicker. They were pretty flaky and the flavor was absolutely wonderful. I made them for the hubby, and my 10 month old daughter, and when my older kids tried them, they demanded more. Unfortunately we ate them all, haha these will be a hot commodity around my house. (*EDIT: Made them again, and this time I just made 6 large biscuits--I cut the dough with a knife ad just made square biscuits to eliminate having the leftover tough ones--and it was wonderful!)

Amazing!! I found it necessary to knead the dough before I patted it and folded it in thirds. Make sure you follow the recipe to the letter, because all the steps which don't seem needed- such as making an indentation on the biscuits before baking them- really pay off!! I used homemade buttermilk (milk with vinegar added to it) and it worked well. I also would encourage you not to completely omit the salt- that's partly why these biscuits taste so good! I will definitely be making them again soon.

I give it a 5 star rating because I made changes and it didn't turn out as expected, so I will remake these and rerate if necessary. I used my food processor and zipped everything up in it. It was fast and easy, but they did not fluff up. They were quite flat and a little dry. But the flavor was excellent. Next time I will mix everything all by hand and see if being gentler with the dough yields a better, fluffier, moister biscuit.

These were really good and pretty easy. Next time, I will roll out the dough to more than the 1/2 inch stated in the recipe. My re-rolled biscuits at about 1 inch thick turned out better than the ones done at 1/2 inch. Otherwise, a great method and a solid recipe. Thanks Chef John!!

These were truly easy - follow the video and you can't go wrong! Nice and buttery.

I did grate the butter instead of cutting it in (I don't have a pastry cutter at the moment) but the end results were perfect.

These turned out really well each time I've made them. Make sure you don't overwork the dough, or the texture will suffer, as with any biscuit. It should also be noted that self rising flour works wonderfully in this recipe if you don't have plain on hand! If they're turning out dry, you should have added just a bit more buttermilk to your dough. A big part of making biscuits is getting the dough just right and there's not really a way to tell you how to do that through text. You just have to practice, practice practice until you find your personal "sweet spot" where your dough isn't too dry, nor too sticky/wet. It also really helps if you start out with your butter frozen before cutting it in with a hand held pastry blender.

I first tried this recipe about 3-4 months ago, and I can't even count how many times I have already made them since then. Followed the recipe exactly, nothing needs to be changed. Flaky, soft and moist inside, crispy outside. Love the fact you can make it when you have time,  freeze them, and bake in the mornings as many as you need, serving them hot and fresh. Thank you, reviewers, who gave this idea! My husband can eat them every morning and not get tired :) Now I always double the portion, so I don't need to make them every week, but only every other :)

Great recipe! I only added small amount of cane sugar to each layer of dough during the rolling, plus some raisin to the last layer - as a result I made delicious cookies! Many thanks!

This was a fantastic recipe! The biscuits turned out buttery, just a little crunchy in the perfect places, and a perfect breakfast, lunch, snack, or even a perfect biscuit to go with soups or dinner foods! Also, I added two tsp of white sugar to add just a little bit of sweetness, and that was really good. Great recipe overall! For those who say that they turned out hard or not well, I think that it's not the recipes fault. Did you add something that wasn't listed in the recipe? Did you cook them for too long? I would have to say that it's a 99% chance that you did something wrong, not the recipe. 
Very nice overall.

Very flaky and buttery. Hoped for a better rise, so maybe I did something wrong. Will try making them again. Not easy to get biscuits just right, is it?

I just made this recipe...first time in a LONG time I've made biscuits from scratch.  I wanted to teach my neighbor's daughters about biscuit-making and, while ordinarily I don't take such a risk as to cook for other people with a recipe I've never tried, Chef John's recipes have never let me down. 

This one was no exception. My biscuits turned out very light and flaky, rose up nice and tall with a perfectly browned and slightly "crispy" crown, and had the perfect flavour of butteryness and NOT the overpowering taste of baking soda that is often present in scratch biscuits made from inferior recipes.

I loved these biscuits! I added herbs de provence to my first batch and cheese and herbs to the second. These biscuits turned out very nice and flaky.

These were the best biscuits I have ever made. Light, flaky. Wonderful. I used dry buttermilk and they turned out great. I also took the advise of one review and mixed the flour and butter in the food processor and that worked great. i will be making these again real soon!

OK, I'm a pretty good cook and baker but I have never been able to make a decent biscuit. That changed tonight. I followed this recipe and Chef John's technique. They are so good. I did use very cold butter flavored shortening which I added in small pieces like the slices of butter. Wish I had read the reviews about freezing the extra UNCOOKED biscuits but these will be good for breakfast. Patisht

This recipe was awesome if you follow it I unfortunately did not.  I did however make one correctly and it was great, as for the others I rolled the dough to thin and they had good flavor but were not great. So my suggestion is dbl the dough because if your gonna make a flour mess you may as well get enough dough for a cpl meals and freeze the unused uncooked biscuits between wax paper in a freezer bag and error on the side of caution and stop rolling a few rolls before you think you should stop no one has ever turned their nose up at a tall flaky biscuit.

I love this recipe. I like my biscuits a little more buttermilk-y so I just used the whole stick of butter and a whole cup of buttermilk and baked them an extra min or two and they are just a tad more sense and moist- perfect!

I really did not want to keep folding the dough and was tempted to just drop them on the baking sheet but so glad I followed instructions.  They were awesome.  I had to urge my husband to try one, he said he was not hungry and would wait until they cooled... but he changed his mind and ended up eating five! I did use salted butter because I did not have unsalted.  They were so good I do not know if I will use unsalted next time and I will make them bigger. This recipe is a keeper.

I had never made buttermilk biscuits before, the recipe was a lot easier than I thought it would be. My family loved them and my daughter said they tasted like kfc's biscuits.That was a huge compliment, thank you so much for sharing.

This is the only recipe I use for buttermilk biscuts. The only thing different I do is I use the method that Chef john uses to make his buttercrust pastry dough. It's easier this way and it always comes out perfect.

This recipe is very easy, and I loved how flaky the biscuits were.  I do have two complaints: 1) although I followed the recipe to a T, the biscuits were starting to darken underneath before getting any color on top. Therefore I was left with a beautifully golden biscuit with a black bottom.  2)  I feel the biscuits could have used some sugar or honey for a touch of sweetness.  Best biscuit recipe with regards to flakiness and height, but not the best tasting :(

I made this recipe tonight for supper to help fill up all my boys and everyone loved it!!  AND - I did as another reviewer suggested when she was short on butter and I only put in 4T. butter (which also made the recipe lighter and a bit healthier, too) and the other 3T were low-fat sour cream.  I shaved the butter per suggestion of another reviewer as well and it worked like a charm. It only took a few minutes to cut it all in.  Delicious! Thanks for sharing!

The flavor and texture of these biscuits are outstanding.  They are wonderfully flaky.  The buttermilk biscuits I've been baking for over 50 years are pretty fabulous, but these are better.  Real buttermilk makes a difference here.  This recipe can easily be halved if you have a small family, yielding four big, fluffy biscuits.

Perfection.  We loved these biscuits.  They came out perfectly layered and flakey.  I tried the vegetable peeler for the butter, like another reviewer suggested.  It worked out great.  My only tip is when the butter starts to get slippery coat it with some of the flour mixture to help keep your grip.

They would have been perfect except for the fact that you could REALLY taste the baking soda/powder.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  I blended the flour with the baking soda and powder as the recipe says but these are inedible.  I will try to use less baking powder next time.

These are fantastic biscuits, the best I have ever made. I would even go so far as to say they are the best I've ever had.  I also froze them after cutting out and cooked them later with great success. I have a new favorite biscuit recipe- thank you!

Veganized it with vegan buttermilk (almond milk+lemon juice) and Earth's Balance instead of butter. Rolled it out as a big biscuit and used it as the crust on a squash and portobello casserole/pot pie. Delicious.

First time and great results. I end up adding almost a full cup of butter milk. My kids loved it.

The best I've ever made, at least ... I was obliged to add a bit more buttermilk at the combining stage (step 5), as I didn't quite have "dough" yet.  They came out tender, flaky, nice flavor, and I scored some points with the wife -- always a good thing.

I've made this twice now and it's definitely the best biscuit recipe I've tried. Very flaky. I like to dress mine up with thick sliced peppered ham and aged white cheddar with just a stone ground mustard. Thanks for sharing!

Followed recipe exactly (video is helpful). Rose beautifully; tasted great; quick to make. Tips: don't overcook. In my oven, at least, 15 minutes is too long, especially if you space the biscuits an inch or more apart. If they are touching in the pan they will be softer. Also, if you keep unsalted butter in the freezer all the time it will last virtually forever and be ready for any baking activity that requires super cold butter like this one. Finally, as another reviewer said, cutting the butter into the flour is much easier with a food processor. Process for about 20 seconds. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Words won't do justice to how delicious these biscuits are!  They are awesome! Look no further!  You have found THE biscuit recipe!  As I was making them, I was thinking that they were a bit more involved than the last (disappointing) recipe I had tried.  The folding and re-rolling was new; so, maybe... They looked the same rolled out and cut and I was skeptical about the buttermilk wash.  And then they started to bake...Oh, my goodness! They smelled wonderful, rose beautifully and I was amazed at how delicious they were! Chef John, thank you for sharing!  I've already searched for more of your recipes!

You can't go wrong when you follow Chef John's instructions.  I never would have believed I would be making things like buttermilk biscuits and pie crust from scratch, but it's all happening.  I have made these and Chef John's cream biscuits, and my Southern husband liked them equally.  They smell heavenly and look impressive.  Thank you for another winning recipe, Chef John!

I used 100% all natural white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour and homemade cultured buttermilk. These biscuits were soft and moist and my family of 7 loved them! Will add this to my favorites!

They were very good and attractive... But only after using 50% more liquid than was called for. Before that, it wouldn't have even made a pie dough!

I absolutely love these biscuits. I follow the recipe as is however I don't drink regular milk so I use vanilla almond milk and I sour it myself. Still turns out wonderfully. A family favorite.

Excellent biscuits! I've used this recipe several times each time their better, at first I rolled too thin. My biscuit cutter must be bigger, I only get 6 cut out then kinda shape the rest into two more. Super good with "Bill's sausage gravy" or jam.

These were great, and, like most biscuits, very quick to make. The dough was drier than I thought it would be, so instead of the folding technique described, I kneaded it a few times and then patted it out to cut. They needed to bake longer, but my oven is slow, so 15 minutes would likely work in a different oven. Thanks!

Wow.   These are super -- was in the mood to serve tall, puffy biscuits tonight -- ones that would hold a lot of honey & butter.   Couldn't have asked for more.  Followed recipe pretty closely.

Thank you Chef John for the recipe and the video. I do not have a pastry cutter and the last time I attempted to make scratch biscuits, it took forever to cut the butter in with a fork. This time, I took another reviewer's suggestion and used a grater to grate the very cold butter into the flour, and then I used a fork to just work it in until it resembled course crumbs. Worked perfectly. I followed the rest of the instructions exactly and the biscuits came out delicious. I made them last night and my husband has asked for them again tonight. If you're a novice to biscuit-making like me, take a few minutes and watch the video first. This is definitely a winning recipe.

I changed this recipes to 4 teaspoons of baking power, 1 cup buttermilk, and 2 tablespoons of sugar and everything else was the same.  The changes I made added a different flavor to the biscuits and they were extremely soft on the inside.

These biscuits were gorgeous and delicious.  And since I try to eat a wheat-free diet, I substituted spelt flour for the white flour in the same measurement and they turned out beautifully.  Chef John is fabulous!  :)

Just made these for my family's breakfast. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used a priceless tip from an allrecipes reviewer that I read long ago. Pour a full Tablespoon of white vinegar into your 1 cup measuring cup, then fill the rest with milk. Stir gently, wait 5 minutes, and you have buttermilk substitute! Everything else I followed exactly to the recipe, and they were great! Thank you Chef John...p.s. The video is very helpful to watch first if you haven't made biscuits before or if it's been a while.

Loved loved loved this. I grew up with buttermilk biscuits like these, but my mothers recipe doesn't work for me due to the sea level difference.  These are perfect to fill the hole there loss caused.  Tender, flakey and they puffed wonderfully.  I was concerned about some other reviews that said they came out dry, so I did add an extra tsp of butter and baked for 13 and a half minutes.  They came out perfect!

Another zinger Chef John.  While they were cooking, I was lamenting the fact that I would like to have incorporated a little garlic flavor when I read Jillian's comment that she brushes them with butter in the last five minutes.  Presto, I brushed them with a little butter and garlic salt.  Incredible accompaniment to last night's leftover pot roast with extra gravy!

If these got any more perfect, I'd eat them 24/7.  I was put off at first by the gooey dough but it worked up GREAT in the end.  I used sour milk instead of buttermilk with obviously great results.  I also mixed the dough in my food processor -- cuts the butter in wonderfully!  I used the first batch to make breakfast pockets, patting blobs of dough onto the baking sheet into rounds, topping with meat / cheese then patting on another blob of dough until the edges sealed. I've used whole wheat flour as well -- a bit dry but good with jam.  I've also used an ice cream scoop to portion the dough.  Making a batch now, to see how it works into cinnamon rolls...

I followed instructions exactly, except I had to add almost a 1/4 cup more buttermilk (I live in dry Colorado). These are wonderful! Like Chef John said, crispy and tender and chewy. All the textures you want in a biscuit.

This was a very good (and easy!) recipe.  I only made two small changes: I didn't freeze the butter, but cut it into small chunks and mixed it into the flour with my food processor.  Second, I used a mixture of white and white wheat flour.  Came out very tasty, and went very well with my sausage gravy.

So I accidentally rolled mine a little too flat, but these were still very good. I didn't have enough buttermilk to brush some on top of them. I brushed butter on them. Still very good.

Hands down this Recipe is a keeper in all due respect. I followed it to the Tee. And they simply came out Dandy. You can't miss with it..If I can do it with hands that have all thumbs attached. Anyone can do it without fail.

Great recipe!!! Made them small, 1" rounds. They rose so high they actually fell over so I think I will need to do 1/4" instead of 1/2". Super flaky and tender. Loved them!!!

These are excellent!  Easy to make and so flaky. I also put the flour mixture in processor and put butter chunks in. Very simple. Then I put the flour/butter mix back in bowl and put in the freezer for a few minutes before adding milk. Brushed with melted butter 5 minutes before they were done baking.  Had them with country fried steak and gravy. Yummy!

This was a very nice biscuit. I made my buttermilk with 3/4 cup of milk and tablespoon or so of lemon juice. I also used a stone pan to bake them and the bottom came out perfectly golden brown.

Excellent recipe, video and tips.  Followed measurements exactly and biscuits had distinct layers of buttery goodness.  this was my first attempt at making biscuits from scratch.  Thank you Chef John!!  
No more shortcut canned biscuits for me... ;o)

My husband has been dying for me to figure out how to make flaky biscuits, and this recipe is the winner.  It went together quickly and the biscuits melted in our mouths.  This is my new go-to recipe for biscuits!

Very simple, fast, & easy recipe! The Buttermilk biscuits came out perfectly! I did add a little more buttermilk to the recipe, but only because they came out so very moist when I tried it that way!

All I can say is that they came out great.  My mom would be proud...and jealous that she didn't get one.  My only suggestion is to watch the video for sure if you have not made biscuits before.

Like the video says, you really need to do this recipe several times to master it.  If I had settled on one try I probably would have rated the recipe 3 stars and moved on, but tried it a couple more times and the biscuits got better each time.  Big key was not over-mixing.

My wife and mother-in-law loved these so it doesn't matter what I think. I feel they could use a little more butter but what do I know. We will be eating these a lot so it's a good thing it's such an easy recipe. Plus they are way better for you then those biscuits from a can. -JOSH

I tried this twice and it was amazing both times.  I used regular flour the first time and winter wheat flour the second.  Using the winter wheat made the biscuits lighter and crispier but the flavor was great in both.

I cooked half of the recipe.  I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so, I used 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of milk and added 1/2 tablespoon of vinegar.  I let it sit for about 5 minutes.  I followed the recipe as is but instead of brushing buttermilk on the top of the biscuits, I dipped them in butter.  Update:  I used to use a biscuit cutter to make the biscuits but because of the round shape I was losing a lot of the dough.  When I make half of the recipe, I now cut the biscuits in thirds.  They end up in log form instead of traditional biscuit form but they still taste delicious.  Bake for 13 minutes.

Very tasty.  I have yet to perfect them as mine didn't rise as much as I think they should have.  May also reduce the butter next time, a bit too rich for my taste.

Just made these 1st time. Watching the video made it easier knowing what to expect. They turned out great for this first timer but I wish I would have made them just a little thicker to only get 12. Also I used powdered buttermilk because I didn't have liquid, worked just fine. Taste was great, you could smell the butter while they were baking! No need to put butter on them at the table. My favorite part was the crisp parts. Give it a try, I will definitely make again!

These are the first real biscuits I have ever made and I consider myself a talented baker. They were AMAZING! Also, they were fairly easy and turned out beautiful. My husband and I could not eat enough of them! I highly suggest making this recipe.

Best biscuits I've ever made! Maybe the best I ever et. It should be a bit labor intensive (if you're doing it right). The frozen butter is difficult to cut into the flour, but well worth the effort. Invest in a good pastry cutter; your wrists will thank you.

Also, I usually prepare the dry ingredients and butter the night before, then leave in the coldest spot in the fridge for morning. That way all I have to do before breakfast is add the buttermilk, knead/fold, and cut.

The taste was great! However, they weren't browning on top even after I brushed them with melted butter at 13 minutes. They also didn't rise as much as expected. I ended up baking them for close to 20 minutes. They we're just slightly browning on top, but found the bottoms were extra crispy (not burnt, but heading that direction). I placed them on a silicone mat on a cookie sheet.  I'll move my rack closer to middle of the oven next time to see if that helps balance the heating. Once again, the taste was great and the prep so simple... will keep working at it!

The best biscuit recipe ever.  Can't keep them in the house when I make them.  Have to double sometimes triple the recipe just to make sure I have enough.  It is a must in our house.  Never buying can biscuits again.

These are great!  I absolutely LOVE most if not all types of bread and usually shy away from making it because I know I'll eat it...but I had leftover buttermilk from holiday cakes and didn't want to throw it away. 

Anyway, these were super easy to make and came out delicious.   The taste was dead on.  In looking at the pictures, mine didn't come out as pretty as some of the others but I think that's just a matter of figuring out how to work with the dough.  Also, I only had bread flour so that could have made the difference too.  I'll definitely make again.

They turned out a bit too dense for my family, but the flavor was great so they were eaten.  I believe next time I will drop them by spoonfuls and cook at a lower heat for a bit longer time.

These biscuits were totally awesome and super easy to make! If you watch the video of chef John making them, it is really helpful. I used an entire stick of butter instead of just 7 oz b/c who doesn't love butter? I also used a teensy bit more buttermilk but otherwise followed the recipe, and chef John's very detailed instructions, to the T! Delicious!!

Flakey with great rise.  I halved recipe using only 3T of butter - mine cooked in about 9 or 10" (thank goodness I checked as I started to smell them) - actually, they were almost beginning to burn so watch time.

Baked up moist and flaky. I didn't have buttermilk so used what I had which was half and half which I soured with a tablespoon of white vinegar and I used salted butter. I did forget to brush the tops and dent them with my finger but they still turned out well.  Definitely would make them again.

Great recipe!  I forgot to put the butter in the freezer and these still turned out great - very light and flakey!  Pretty simple to make up and they went great with Bill's Sausage Gravy from this site.

This is THE biscuit recipe I have been searching for ever since I started making biscuits.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It is now the official biscuit of our household. Hint: I made the dough, cut out the biscuits, and then froze them.  We were able to enjoy biscuits for the rest of the week.  Flavor was the same but they didn't puff quite as high.  However, we were okay with that.

Really quite excellent.  The tender but chewy quality of the biscuit was really yummy.  Super easy to make and the only suggestion is to double the recipe because it makes a small amount otherwise

I have tried many a biscuit recipe trying to find one similar to my late mom-ma's. Well, this one wasn't it, but boy was it wonderful! Easy to make and a bit crisp on the outside and so soft inside.  I made it for biscuits and gravy but they were just calling for jam.  I only had salted butter and cut back on the salt to 1/2 tsp and they came out fine. A keeper for sure, thanks for posting this recipe Chef John!

I have tried out several biscuit recipes and this one is great.  I used half the batch as dumplings in some chicken dumpling soup and baked the other half.  I had to leave just as the family was sitting down to eat, but when I got home, there were almost no leftovers!

This was my first time making roll-out biscuits (usually I do drop biscuits) and they came out wonderfully. Mine don't look like his with the pretty layers, but I'm sure that's an experience issue -- I lack it! Thanks for sharing, Chef John!

Not a bad recipe at all.  The first time I made them they were a failure, but that wasn't the recipes fault I think I under mixed the ingredients.  The second time I made them I used a food processor is a dough attachment to mix it and they turned out great, nice and fluffy.  I omitted the salt since the butter I was using was salted and after tasting them it looks like I probably could have left the salt in and it wouldn't have mattered.  Either way I'll be making these again.

These are great and exactly what I was looking for! It really is surprisingly easy, and they're so deliciously flaky.

These turned out perfect! Even my picky eaters went back for seconds. I really liked how easy they were too.

Watched the video, went into the kitchen and viola!, we had the best biscuits ever!  Simply follow the video instructions and you cant go wrong!  I did increase the buttermilk to 1 full cup.

These were the best. I used a little less butter, salt and soda and the biscuits still came out great.

Used to make doughnuts and it turned out great, will use to make actual biscuits. Light texture.
