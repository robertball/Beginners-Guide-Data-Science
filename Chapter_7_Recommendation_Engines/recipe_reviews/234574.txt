We made these little pot pies last week. They were so easy to put together and came out delicious. My picky son ate two of them. A great family recipe for a working mom.

I used leftover roast instead of chicken and that was delicious too.  Must top with cheese!

Tried it with the refrigerator Pillsbury Grand like someone else posted, "...not bad, but not great..." I tried this again with thawed freezer Pillsbury Southern style biscuit and that was the difference for us. Prep time is more but the results are great. For a quick meal use the refrigerator Grands. You will like them. If you have a little more time use the freezer  biscuit, you will not be disappointed.

This recipe was amazing with some (lots of) changes. The picture was taken after we devoured half of the food! 
You have to add some spices and fresh veggies for some more flavor, double the chicken and add more gravy. The spices I added were salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, and sage. I added this to two large chicken breasts as they cooked and also a tad bit more to the mix. The gravy I made was 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1/2 can of cream of mushroom. I also chopped up 1/2 a green pepper into small pieces, 1/4 onion, 1 stalk of celery (and the leaves) and 1 Clove of garlic for fresh flavor along with the frozen veggies (only 6oz of the frozen veggies necessary). This recipe made a lot of left over filling. That's the best part. When the pies are done cooking (I cooked for 25 mins) it's necessary to top with extra filling (yummy). I also topped these mini pies with shredded cheese before cooking! A+!

My chicken was already flavored so I didn't add any seasoning . If you want something simple this is it . Other reviewers commented that it didn't have enough and I disagree . If your chicken is seasoned you should be all set . I used left over roasted chicken . I have two picky boys and they loved it !!! I wouldn't change anything . Will be making this again !!!!

Not five stars, but a definite four stars.  Eating these were fun and filling, which makes up for the missing fifth star. I stuck with the recipe which is unusual for me.  The only change is that I had a 6 muffin tin and eight biscuits, so I separated the remaining 2 biscuits (peeling them apart in thirds) and covered the tops with the 1/3 separated biscuits.  Wow!  So easy and so good. family loved them too.  Next time I might at some garlic powder and onion powder, but the were really good just as the recipe alone.

This recipe is ok as written. It becomes infinitely better if you add some chopped onion, salt, pepper, and maybe garlic depending on taste.

This is a really good recipe although a little bland. Next time I will add some spices. I didn't have any flaky biscuits, so just used the Grands.  Great recipe for leftover chicken or turkey.  I think I will try them with leftover beef & use cream of mushroom soup...Wonder if anyone has tried that?

Great way to use leftovers, especially after Thanksgiving.  I used apple-wood smoked turkey instead of chicken.  I cut up and sauteed some leftover carrot and celery sticks as part of the vegie mix, plus I used up the leftover corn.  I couldn't resist adding a splash of white wine to the vegies when they were cooking, and I stirred in the 1/4 cup of leftover gravy so it wouldn't go to waste.  I also used up some partial bags of frozen vegies and that was a plus.  For flavor, simplicity, and use of leftovers it is a five, but the high sodium of the canned soup and high fat of the canned biscuits lowers it to a four.  (If that doesn't bother you, consider it a five-star rating.)  It also takes a lot longer than 45 minutes to put together and bake, even if you disregard that I chopped and sauteed some raw vegies. I will make it again, if only to use up dark turkey after Thanksgiving in something besides soup.

I made this last night.  Oh my gosh - so easy and yummy!!  Tweaked it a little - I used cream of potato soup and added some sautéed onions to the filling .  I think each muffin could use a little less breadiness so next time I might try to divide each biscuit in half.  Also thought about trying crescent rolls flattened out or the dreaded phyllo route.  I came in the door last night at 7:30 and dinner was literally ready by 8:00.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This is a fabulous recipe. My family loves chicken pot pie and this was a fun and easy way to serve them up. Initially I was a little concerned that it would be a bit bland, but noticed others thought the same. I used my large size muffin tin, worked out well. Also made a few minor changes: 

* Veggies: Instead of a frozen veggie mix I'd probably never use again. I just used 1/2 c each of frozen peas and corn, diced up a fresh carrot (yes, won't be overly soft, but my family does not enjoy mushy cooked carrots), and about a 1/4 cup of diced onion. 
* Herbs/Spices: I also added 1-2 tablespoons of dried Italian herb mix, 1/2 tsp of pepper. No need to add any salt to this. 
* I also upped the amount of chicken (diced two breasts, maybe 1.5-2 cups.

Loved it with minor modifications.  Used Cream of Celery Soup & frozen broccoli & corn sprinkling in some sage & a bit of crushed red peppers for a bit of zing, pan fried a chicken breast in a little butter with Thyme, Rosemary & Garlic Powder, before chopping it up and mixing it in with the soup & veggies.  No problem with flavor & I'll be making these again!

This recipe was so easy.  I used left over chicken from last night's dinner.  I added a little garlic and onion powder to the mix.  I will definitely do this again and maybe use taco meat and cheese next time.

This is a fantastic, easy recipe. I added several spices per other reviews which was definitely needed. I thought the Grands flaky biscuits were perfect. Also added a little cheese on top. Pan was gone in no time & family asked to get this on the permanent rotation. Thanks for the recipe -it's a keeper!

Some day in the future I'll use soup, but I had time today so I made my own sauce using heart healthy butter, skim milk and low sodium chicken flavoring with the flour. My biscuits were low fat and it ended up being a darn good meal with not a whole lot of the "bad" ingredients we have to be so careful to ingest. Thanks for the recipe!!

This was easy and good.  I used lemon-pepper chicken to flavor it up a bit and it was satisfying.

For those who didn't like the "breadiness" of them, maybe they should try making the same mistake I did. :)  I mistakenly bought crescent rolls at the store rather than biscuits.  So I lined each buttered muffin cup with an unrolled crescent roll and smashed it around a bit to close any gaps.  My wife, mother-in-law and I think it was great mistake.

My next attempt will be hamburger, onions and broccoli cheddar soup.

So simple and so good! What more could you ask for? I have two go-to chicken pot pie recipes and this one has been our favorite as of late. I like the individual servings. Really press the flaky dough in the muffin tins so you can put as much filling in as possible. We all love these!

This wasn't bad when I added some salt, pepper, onion, garlic powder, and mushrooms, but it's almost identical to another chicken pot pie recipe on this site that's much less time consuming. These are really only worth the effort if you want them to look cute for company or happen to have a muffin tin but no casserole or baking pan.

I made these tonight.  They were pretty good. The veggies and biscuits didn't cook through even after I added 8 min. Next time I'll probably cook lower for longer. Still a great easy week night dinner.

Yummy! Super easy, great weeknight meal. I had a lot of filling left so I kept it warm while the pot pies were cooking and served them on top of the left over filling.

I made this last week for me and my 8 yo daughter.  I seasoned everything before adding it to the condensed soup.  Wish I would have used a bigger can as I would have liked more gravy.  I just used what veggies I had on hand.  Pretty good and very cute after they're all baked up lol

Great way to enjoy the comfort food of mini pot pies but even I needed to add some spices to perk up the flavor - added Greek seasoning and onion flakes.  Will make again but need to get more creative with meat and soup options.

All of my family seemed to enjoy this new recipe.  Dough was a little raw on the inside but if I baked any longer they would have been too done on the outside.

A little bland for our taste. I added a clove of finely chopped garlic and a small onion chopped and sauteed prior to adding the soup and frozen vegetables.  Sprinkle a little shredded cheddar cheese on top near the end of the baking.

I made the vegetarian version of this...given I was cooking for only my husband and myself, I decided making individual pot pies made the most sense. I used fresh mixed stir fry veggies, sautéed them in garlic, olive oil, and then added a variety of spices including curry powder! I then mixed in cream of mushroom soup with about half a cup of milk and this was my mixture. Turned out great--husband loved it and definitely will try again for a family party!

I made a few alterations. I tasted the mixture before stuffing and decided to add some all purpose seasoning. I also had 2 potatoes laying around so I chopped those, nuked them and threw em in. I used a whole can of Kirkland canned chicken and added a little milk. It didn't really need the milk in just thought it may be a little creamier in the end. Before I threw them in I topped with a little dash of seasoning again and will top with some cheese when the come out. Can't wait to try them!

I tried these for the first time tonight. I think they came out pretty well. 

I took them out at 25 minutes as 375 degrees, but that seemed a little early, the dough was still gooey. I was able to just leave them in the oven while it was off, for a few more minutes to crisp them up. I put mine in paper and aluminum cupcake cups, the paper stuck to the dough and felt like i wasted food. the aluminum cups were  a lot easier to remove. (They didn't make a mess at all, surprise surprise, i thought i'd have to clean the oven after! but not mess at all!)

They were a little bland, but some post-cooking pepper and garlic salt made them much tastier. (Next time, I'm going to season the mixture before wrapping them)

Considering that they are the size of a cupcake, they are very surprisingly filling! i finished one, and thought "maybe i can handle a second," i'm able halfway through my 2nd and I can't eat anymore!

I have a bigger family, there are 6 of us. So I made a little extra of everything. Three cups of veggies, 2 cups of chicken, and 1.5 cans of soup. I think the mixture was well-balanced for eyeball measuring.

IMPORTANT Results: My 3 year old nephew LOVED it. My 5 year old nephew (can be pretty picky) wasn't too excited but liked it more after some pepper. My 10 year old nephew ate TWO.  

I'm excited to try different ingredients, like adding bacon bits, or different meat, different soup (maybe beef stew?)

We did not like this at all.  It was extremely bland and not at all appetizing.  The filling was too little for the amount of breading, and there was no way to add more filling to balance the ratio within the muffin tin.  It is quick and easy, but I will not make it again.  My husband had one and then popped a bag of popcorn, because he couldn't eat another.  My daughter wouldn't even finish hers.

Love this!! Super easy and tastes great!  Must add seasoning however if your chicken is seasoned you may be ok not adding any other spices. I used seasoned salt, celery seed, and garlic powder on chicken.

Pretty good, simple recipe.  I recommend jazzing it up if you have time- see review recommendations. I followed the recipe to a T and the cream of chicken taste with the grands combo could have used some more pizzazz.

Perfect way to use up my left over chicken from a different night in the week. Added some left over Rosemary as well. A lot of filling was left over so in a pinch I pulled out crescent rolls and used the 4 squares to make 4 more. That’s a good substitute if you don’t have any biscuits. Hit in my house! This is a great recipe to use of thanksgiving left overs

Super easy. I used my circular meat tenderizer to press great discs out of the biscuits.  I used Progresso's Chicken Pot Pie style soup with extra frozen corn and peas added.  I had left over smoked and pulled chicken.  Baked at 350 for 20, then sprinkled with cheese and baked another 5. Hoping the work pot luck likes them like I did!

Had issues with the biscuits not cooking in the middle where the mix and the biscuit met. Giving this a 4 star rating because it was good, after some creative re-baking.

My husband wants this on our menu rotation! I did use Crescent Rolls because that's what I had and canned chicken that was already seasoned with lemon pepper and I added some Italian seasoning to the soup mix. Great way to use up any left-over veggies and so easy!

Overall this turned out really well. Since the entire ingredient list is processed, I kept in mind to add flavor and move away from the generic taste that frozen veg and canned soup can have. For the veggies I sauteed baby carrots with butter, adding minced garlic and chopped onion then tossed in the peas and corn from frozen. I was in a super time crunch so ended up using a can of water packed chicken that turned out rather well, especially since it was easy to shred. I sauteed the chicken adding salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Tip: the filling must stand on its own! I seasoned to taste with garlic powder and s&p. These hand pies were easy and cute, but the biscuit was a little thick. Next time I may try some pie crust or half a biscuit per pie as well as make my own gravy.

I made these earlier this week and they were great! The ingredients are inexpensive, they were easy to put together, and were tasty when finished. These did not store well in the refrigerator for me (maybe it was the biscuits I used) but for a day-of dinner these work great.

We really enjoyed these & they were easy to make.  I did make a couple of minor adjustments to suit our tastes.  First, I seasoned the chicken breast with salt & pepper while it was sautéing.  Second, once the chicken was cooked, I used the same pan to sauté up about 1/4 of a large diced onion & 1 minced garlic clove to add to the filling.  I also had to cook for a few extra minutes to get the biscuits to brown up nicely.  My husband suggested that we try again with a lighter dough, maybe a pie crust?  Overall, this is a keeper & will make it's way into our dinner rotation - the filling options leave room for endless variation.  Thanks for sharing!

YUM!  Easy and delicious.  My husband loves chicken pot pie so I had to try this. Will definitely be making this again. I used a Corning Ware 3" deep bowl.  Pressed out the Grands to quickly cover bottom and sides before adding the filling. I used 3 skinless chicken breasts that I had boiled, seasoned and diced. Used steamer mixed veggies that I put in microwave about 2 minutes and cream of celery soup. Then baked it in my convection oven. We are full time RVers and this is so easy and delicious.  We had leftovers for the next day. SO GOOD.

Bought a chicken breast and seasoned with salt & pepper and pan cooked and it was a good amount of chicken.  Added some garlic powder and thyme to the mixture per other reviews.  Baked in ramekins, and was quick and good - but not as good as a more in depth 'home-made' chicken pot pie.  Would make again for a party, but not for dinner.

Followed other reviews before making . I was worried about undercooked biscuits so I placed the biscuit and filling in every other muffin slot so that each mini pie would not touch another. Covered with aluminium foil after 10 mins so wouldn't burn. Added broccoli, sauteed onions, garlic salt, and lots of salt and pepper.  I liked this dish :)

I use a little less than called for on the veggies, and cook the chicken with garlic, salt, paprika, and oregano. My roommate loves them. Great and easy to make, and the leftovers are great, too.

I decided to make these tonight and they were so simple and easy to make. I mixed all my ingredients and then cut up some fresh onion and celery to add into it. I also added a tbsp of Soy sauce to the mix to kinda thin out the cream of chicken and give it some more flavor. I used the rest of the filling to top each pie and then spread some grated cheese over each and let it bake until it was melted. 
I loved these definitely going to make them again.

Easy recipe for a quick meal.  Most people have mixed vegetables on hand,  so this meal is great for someone who needs dinner in a hurry.  I agree with most that you need to add a little onion and garlic for flavor, otherwise it's kind of bland.  Can use chicken or beef, and change the soups, depending on desired taste.  Makes plenty.  We use two rolls of grands bisquicks.

This recipe was so quick and so easy and my picky eaters loved it so much. ( they ate 2 each). I made a few changes myself. I added some potatoes, took out the green beans, diced the carrots smaller, and added plenty of salt and pepper. I will definitely make this again and again!!!

Quick and easy recipe..I used this as a "left over turkey" go to meal and made my own turkey gravy to mix with the meat and veggies. Delicious!! I bet it would be good with Cream of mushroom too. I love how you can mix and match meats and sauces.

Delish!   My kiddos loved them too. My variation: I made homemade cream of celery soup (GF,DF) it's super simple and so much healthier. All you need is  a Potato, 4 celery stalks with leaves, 1/4 onion, 4 garlic cloves,  2 c water, s&p- boil everything for 15 minutes, blend and you'll have cream of celery soup.

My son, boyfriend and I all loved these!  I only made a couple of small changes... I used cream of mushroom soup, instead of cream of chicken.  Also, when I cooked my chicken ahead of time, I seasoned it with salt, pepper, and Adobo.  The little pot pies came out excellent!

This would be a big hit when including the children in when making this and I'm sure they would have fun.  But I have to say they were just ok.  I felt like there should have been more seasoning and he ratio of the biscuit to filling was off.  Too much bread.

I only changed two things with this recipe and it was nothing to do with taste. I used canned chicken because I wanted it shredded, these are tiny and I wanted plenty of chicken in eacc pot pie. The only other change was the top, I pinched it closed entirely and added mozzerlla cheese. These are great without the fuss of extra flavoring ??

This is an easy but good recipe, great way to use up some leftover chicken or turkey. I also did it with leftover roast beef, vegetables, and beef gravy. It turned out great.

Yes I've made it twice this month. My husband & I both love it, tonight he made me promise that we would have them once a week. It's so easy to make, and at my age any recipe that taste that good and is easy to make is a delight to me. I am wondering how it would be with cheddar cheese soup in place of the cream of chicken soup. Has anyone tried that?

I made these for dinner tonight and they are fantastic! The entire family loved them!
I did have a lot of leftover filling (and I way over stuffed them),  so next time I will buy 2 cans of biscuits. I used the herbed cream of chicken soup, and I mixed some shredded cheddar into the filling. Delish!
For the leftover filling, I just made some white rice to pour it over and that will be lunch tomorrow!

My daughter made this last night and it was soo easy and  soo delicious.. The only thing she did different was boil the chicken in chicken broth and added just a tad bit to the mixture and it gave the chicken a great flavor....

Really enjoyed these. Simple and easy. I seasoned the chicken with pepper, garlic salt and Santa Maria seasoning. Baked and then in a frying pan added a little garlic and browned with olive oil. It was good. Would make again. Great comfort food and perfect size.

It definitely needed to be cooked longer, it was still doughy after 22 minutes.  I also seasoned the chicken with sage, thyme and salt like other reviewers suggested.  It's a fun alternative to regular chicken pot pie.

These were good and easy. Plus my kids liked them. With that being said I will definitely make again. Next time using just frozen corn and peas and diced potatoes. I made extra filing on the stove top to add to them before serving and I'm glad I did. I felt like they needed more when I tasted mine.

Made these last night, I doubled everything from the original recipe (making 16 biscuits + 5 made from scratch with bisquick) and did the following modifications as well: per another user I added 1/2 TSP pepper and 1TBSP It. seasoning ( I didn't have any other It herbs lying around). I increased the cooked chicken to approx. 1.5 cups/batch and sprinkled shredded cheese on top of 1/2 the final product. I also cooked them in cupcake sleeves to help mitigate the cleanup. 

They went over well: everyone said they enjoyed them, I enjoyed the recipe as well. I'd add a different seasoning next time (versus It seasoning) but since it was all I had on hand, it filled the bland gap in the recipe nicely. Easy-peasy supper after an afternoon cleaning out the basement-which is what I appreciated most about it! I will definitely be making these again.

These were pretty good but a little bland for my taste.  Still, it's nothing that some seasonings couldn't fix the next time we make.  We went from having no idea what to eat to a meal with ingredients on hand in about 35 minutes.  That's a pretty good accomplishment in my opinion!  Forgot to mention that we doubled the chicken which I would definitely do again to make it more filling.

Easy to convert to vegetarian! I used Cream of Mushroom instead of Cream of Chicken and it was good! It would be extra good with some pepper and thyme or rosemary mixed in with the veggies.
