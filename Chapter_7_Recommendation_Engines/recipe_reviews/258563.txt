This Hash Hoppel Poppel recipe was delicious! My 3 year old watched as I prepared it and happily ate once it was finished. I did bake it for about 30 minutes. We all loved it!!

All my life, I have heard of hash, but it was not part of my mom's culture, so I had never experienced it.  I tried this recipe, because I like breakfast recipes that may be made in advance, and then leftovers work for breakfasts on busy mornings.  Well, I'm glad I tried it, because I have eaten it 2 days in a row, and I will eat it again tomorrow!  This has lots of tasty veggies, and I really think for the number of eggs, I could easily double the veggies for even more flavor, next time.  This was lovely on a bed of fresh spinach, with some cantaloupe on the side.  No need for additional meat, as there is plenty in the dish.  Pantry finds are always fun, and now I know what folks are talking about, when they talk about hash!  Thanks for the idea!

Mmmmmm... We couldn't stop eating this! We are just a small family of 3 and our 9 x 13 pan was almost empty from so many extra helpings, up to thirds. Easy to make! I did have to cook my for 35 minutes until it was done.  I didn't measure my salt and pepper. I just did the usual shakes before seeing the measurements.

My family always made it with quartered slices of summer sausage instead of corned beef.
