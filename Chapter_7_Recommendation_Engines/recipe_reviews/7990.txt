A great cheesecake... with some modifications to suit the taste of my friends. First, I made this crust out of oreos - I think it fits better. I think the chocolate cheesecake would be overwhelming, so I mixed the chocolate with a little bit of the cheescake batter and swirled it throughout the plain batter. I did the same thing with some of the caramel, so when we cut into the cheesecake, you could see the chocolate and caramel ribbons without overpowering the cheesecake. I did put in the layer of caramel and pecans, and it was excellent! I always bake my cheesecakes in a springform pan fit inside one of those silicone cake pans, then place the cheesecake in a roasting pan and put water halfway up the side of the cheesecake pan. This has always worked well for me - I get the benefits of a waterbath without the leaking that foil can do. Before I boxed it up to take to work, I used some Smuckers hot fudge topping to cover the top of the cake in a very thin layer, then placed pecan halves around. Finally, I drizzled what was left of the caramel sauce on top of this cake. It looked beatuiful! I am known for my cheesecakes, and my coworkers were quite impressed. Try this one - you won't be disappointed@

This cheesecake was awesome with one simple change. Instead of melting the chocolate chips and adding to the batter, I added 1 cup of mini semi-sweet morsels to the batter. This made it a little less chocolatey and even prettier. After baking the cheesecake I also drizzled some caramel ice cream topping over the top and then sprinkled a few more mini chocolate chips and chopped pecans. Looked professionally made!!

Thank you for this recipe! Nobody ever believes that I made this myself, they assume I bought it. I've actually never used the vanilla wafers, I like to use the Oreo cookie crumbs that come in a box. And I found that melting the caramels and milk in a glass bowl in the microwave is easier and takes less time.

This is great! Here are some good hints to make it better: Use oreo cookie crumbs instead of vanilla wafers.  Build up the sides of the crust and only pour the caramel close to the edge, but not all the way to the edge.  When I poured it to the edge it made a large build up of caramel that was very hard.  Also, allow the caramel to cool before pouring the cheese mixture on top of it.  When making the cheese mixture, allow the cream cheese to come to room temp before  mixing.  That will make it a richer and smoother filling.  Enjoy!

Great recipe!!!  I changed the vanilla wafers to Oreo crumbs, and I used Hershey's Milk Chocolate Chips instead of the semisweet.  It turned out to be amazingly authentic to the original "Turtle".  I also susbtituted T.Marzetti's Caramel Dip instead of unwrapping all those caramels and melting them.

Incredible!  I made this for Thanksgiving, and my stepfather wouldn't let it leave the house.  They were practically fighting over it.  I have made it several times since then, and if you cook it longer at a lower temperature it becomes even creamier!

This recipe is awesome! I made two cakes because I had a daughter and a friend with birthdays.  My friend requested a Turtle Cheesecake.  I followed reviews and used oreo cookies for the crust, added mini choc chips to the batter, and softened the cream cheese to room temp before mixing. I baked in a water bath so the caramel wouldn't get hard; turned off oven at end of baking time and let cool in oven about 3 hours before chilling. Cheesecakes came out perfect! To garnish I melted milk choc chips in microwave, dipped my fingertips in and flung the chocolate across cakes in opposite directions, then I placed pecans around the edge. I posted a photo because it looked so pretty. My friend and family raved about how good it was! I will definitely make again.

Spray the bottom of the pan with cooking spray, put parchment paper on top of that, then spray the paper.  Otherwise it sticks horribly to the bottom.    Also, just nuke the caramels with evaporated milk.  Same for chocolate chips.  Much easier, faster & less messy.  Finally, definitely use a pre-made oreo cookie crust!!  (Forget the graham cracker crust.)

The idea of the caramel and pecans was great, but I used a graham cracker crust and Chantal's New York Cheesecake for the actual cheesecake part then topped with pecans and chocolate sauce.

What a fantastic recipe! I'd give this recipe more stars if I could! I took this to a holiday party and it was the biggest hit.  Everyone was raving about it and people were asking me for the recipe.  I thought it was a pretty easy recipe too.  Like another person suggested, I topped it with chopped pecans and drizzeled carmel.  It dressed it up and made it look more yummy.  This one is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a delicious cheesecake. I wanted to make my own birthday cake so I chose this one because of all of the nice reviews. You were all right! I altered the crust by using half oreos and half chocolate cookies with chocolate cream filling (from the bulk section). I only used about 3 Tablespoons of butter instead of 6 in the crust and I toasted extra pecans and added those to the crust. The cake was so creamy and good, thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was very RICH and decident!  I actually didn't have enough of the carmels but I did have extra ice cream carmel sauce, so I added it to the milk.  But I don't think it was necessary.  And I also forgot to the pecans down before I spread the cream cheese in the middle...since the edges were exposed I was able to get a few around the edges.  My favorite was decorating the top.  Since of course mine cracked (Im always afraid it's not cooked long enough, nothing worse then under cooked desserts).  So what I did was I drizzeled some remaining carmel sauce on top.  Then I sprinkled a few chunks of chocolate chips and the pecans.  Then I melted some Lindt Chocolate and drizzled that back and forth.  It looked professionally done.  The cake was very heavy.  And everyone wanted a large piece, however everyone felt sick after, but man it was worth it.  I didn't really try any thing different thought the recipe was pretty good on it's own.  Thanks for sharing :)
UPDATE::::: so I made this again, trust me to always do something wrong.  I bought enough carmels this time, and had some left over which was good.  Because without measuring the can of milk I just plopped it right in.  where I am there is not the smaller cans they're the size up.  Anyway so I added the extra carmels on hand to make the sauce thicker.  And I actually put the carmel mixture in properly.  This is such an AWESOME dessert! Yes it is sweet, yes it is rich, but that is what cheesecake is all about! its a fave!

Really yummy, but I had minor crust issues.  When I poured in the filling my crust all pushed to the outside.  I think next time before pouring in cream cheese mix I'll put in freezer to set up for 30 minutes or so.  Otherwise...awesome!

WOW!  If I could give this recipe even more stars, I would definitely do it!  This was SO worth my time in baking this delicious cheesecake.  My BF absoultely loved it!  He wanted to share the 1st slice, but I knew that we needed our own plates.  Here's what I did: I bought a springform pan from wal-mart cost was about $10, greased the entire pan with butter, used 14 oreo cookies with a few tablespoons of butter & baked it for about 7 min. I melted the caramel pieces with the evaporated milk in the mircrowave & did the same thing for the chocolate, (thanks to the other reviewers).  I reserved some of the caramel sauce to decorate the cheesecake at the end.  I also made chocolate sauce for the toppings by using 1/2 chocolate chips and a little bit of cream.  I finished the cheesecake with more pecans.  I'm craving this right now!  Can't wait to get home from work so that I can have more.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I loved this  recipe! My 1st time making cheesecake and it turned out amazing. I used Smuckers caramel and fudge on top; and for the pecans I coated them with the same caramel and put them in the oven for 10 min, and put that on top. All my topping were on top and. For the crust i used chocolate graham crackers and smashed them with a bean smasher. *the key was to not over mix the batter!

The cake had a strange consistency and combined with the caramel layer it was far too sweet. Cloying even. I was embarrassed to serve it and when I did my guests didn't find it up to par either. I won't be making this again.

Made this recipe last night. I think when they say 1 can evaporated milk they mean the half can that you can buy at the supermarket. I mistakely used the whole can and ended up pouring over 1/2 out.  Like others said the caramel was way too runny! Mixed some of that mixture with 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture to add extra caramel flavour. This cheesecake is by far AWESOME!!! Please make it, you and others will not be disappointed with the results.

Great recipe!  Made for my pregnant sister in law and she went nutty over it...either it was the craving or it was really good.  I used caramel sauce so didn't need the evap milk obviously as then you don't need to make the caramel sauce.  Worked great.  Acutally it was Dulce Delecce sauce.  Supurb!  drizzled with a bit of the sauce, mileted milk chocolate and pecans

My daughter and I made this for our family for Christmas Eve dinner. We  never made a cheesecake before.  We appreciated everyone's comments.  The cheesecake turned out simply delicious and looked beautiful. Our family LOVED it and talked about it for a week.

Yummy!  I followed the advice of other reviewers & made a few revisions.  I made an Oreo crust & added mini chocolate chips to the batter instead of melting them.  I also took the easy way out & used Marzetti's caramel dip in place of melting caramels.  I garnished the cheesecake with pecan halves & drizzled melted semisweet chocolate over the top.  People raved & couldn't believe I made it myself!

This was a great cheesecake.  Remember not to overbeat the batter because it will rise in the oven, then fall just a little after you take it out. This is a baked custard. The protein in the eggs is what binds it together in the baking process.  The best thing about this cake is how much fun it is to decorate. You can use chocolate, caramel, and nuts in any creative way. This dessert was a great presentation at our Christmas party. I will make this one again.

This cheesecake is to die for!  The flavors blend beautifully and the texture is smooth.  I've yet to have it crack.  I try to keep all the ingredients on hand for an impromptu dessert.

I make cheesecake all of the time and this was fabulous, but I did make a few changes to avoid the extra mess that comes with melting caramel and chocolate.
Instead of melting caramels, I used hot caramel ice cream topping.
I didn't melt the chocolate chips,  I sprinkled them over the pecan/caramel layer.
I topped the whole thing with more caramel and chococolate chips.

This was a crowd pleaser. As suggested by another reviewer, I didn't melt the chocolate chips and it worked well.

I love this recipe just the way it is, but I love chocolate and caramel. This is rich and so tasty. I made it for my husband's birthday that we celebrated with all our friends. Everyone raved about how delicious it was...I agree, it's a tasty treat. I make it several times a year and enjoy it more each time. Thanks for this amazing recipe!

Simply delicious!! Instead of completely combining the chocolate with the cream cheese mixture, I folded it in, allowing for a swirled effect. Looked and tasted superb! =)

This cheesecake is fantastic!  I used oreo crumbs instead of vanilla wafer crumbs, and milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  I, like many others, just added the chocolate chips to the batter without melting them.  I also used caramel ice cream topping instead of melting caramels.  It turned out great!  I sprinkled a few chocolate chips and pecans over the top and drizzled a little bit of caramel, after the cheesecake had cooled for about an hour.  It looked professional, and tasted awesome.

Outstanding!  Not so hard to make and OOOO so good.  Only change I made was sweet chocolate chips instead of semisweet.  I am not so much a chocolate lover.

This turned out magnificent! Beyond my expectations. Like some others I made the crust into an Oreo cookie crust, didn't mix the chocolate into the cheesecake but marbled it and some caramel into it. I also did the chocolate/caramel/pecan topping. It was perfection and tasted amazing!

amazing!!! What a wonderful cake. I made chocolate pecans to decorate. It did crack though despite playing with the temp (450, then 250) and not opening the oven. Oh well...

I have a recipe I have used for years that is almost identical to this. The changes others have made are easy options I have used and I noticed a couple that did not realize that you do not need the evaporated milk if you use caaramel sauce. Don't it will NEVER thicken. I always use a water bath for cheesecakes so they do not crack but also with this one the caramel will not get hard or burn with a water bath. Do not place caramel all the way to the edge of crust and I always go up the sides of pan with crust.  Melt chips in microwave with just a small amount of milk or cream never water and it will drizzle over top beautifully. I also marble the chocolate in the batter instead of fully incorporate it. I have made turtle cheesecake for almost every occasion and my husband takes it to work every so often for the maintenance shop and they down it so quick that there are times he didn't get any so I make an extra for those occasions! Awesome recipe and beautiful looking dessert!

LOVED IT!!!! This was my first cheesecake i've ever made and everyone thought I bought it. The only changes I made was that I used ice cream caramel topping just because I couldn't find any other type of caramel and it still came out awesome. Definitely will make again!

Excellent!!!  I went with the oreo cookie crumbs instead of the vanilla wafer.  I'm testing recipes to bring to Holiday gatherings, so I only had this one to share with my husband.  I cut it up into bite-size squares and threw it in the freezer.  Perfect!  Definately going to use this one for the holidays.

I read many reviews before making this cheesecake and made the following changes: added extra butter to springformpan, used oreo's instead of nilla wafers, and placed caramel in the center of crust.  The cheesecake flovor was ok, caramel still steeped out sides and I could not get outter ring off.  I would recommend not putting caramel on top of crust instead just of top of cheesecake.  I would also use a New York style cheesecake for the base.  Would make againg but only with the above changes.

This is sure to please any crowd. I made it once and had many request to make it again.   I followed someone's suggestion and used the Oreo crust instead of vanilla wafers, and used the mini chips in the actual cheese part, it turned out perfect.   Next time I make it, I think I will buy the dipping caramel instead of unwrapping all 50 candies (what a pain).

turned out very good! used graham crackers for the crust. only problem was caramels mixed with evaporated milk was too runny. next time will melt caramels with a small portion of milk until they are spreadable, but not liquid. i left most of the batter regular flavored and melted chocolate chips with a portion of the batter. i swirled it in, it made an impressive marble pattern.

This cheesecake is amazing!! I did substitute chocolate crumbs for vanilla, but other than that I followed the recipe. The next time I make it, I will try it with caramel sauce, just because it's a pain in the butt unwrapping the caramels. I reserved some of the caramel mixture and drizzeled it over the top along with some melted chocolate and then topped that with more chopped pecans. To prevent the caramel mixture from being displaced with the next layer, I put it in the fridge to thicken it, and then spooned the cheesecake mixture over it. I will definitely make it again, everyone loved it. It's not too sweet, just very rich.

I haven't taken it out of the pan yet, but so far, this cake is lovely!  I followed the suggestions of others and used caramel sauce, and did not melt the chocolate chips before stirring them in.  This looks to be a very good basic cheesecake recipe.

No matter how tempting you really need to refrigerate before serving to keep the layers together. Top with drizzled chocolate and chopped pecans. Very rich and creamy!!!

Oh boy, this was good! I would advise using caramel sauce for the caramel layer instead of waiting for a batch of caramels to melt. It is essentially the same thing and it takes less time. If you also don't have a double broiler on hand just as I did, you can just stick the chocolate chips in a saucepan with a tiny bit of water and melt them that way for a quicker result. My whole family and my boyfriend really enjoyed this and it tasted the best about a day and a half after baking, in my opinion.

This was my first attempt at making a baked cheesecake. I give it 4 stars because the texture and presentation were good, but it did not taste, or remind me of the taste of turtles chocolates. Like many suggested I used Oreo Cookie crumbs for the crust and caramel ice cream topping to make it a little easier. I did not use the water bath method but I think I will if I ever make this particular cheesecake again. The caramel was pushed to the outside edges of the cake, there was none left in the center of the cake, and turned into a hard and chewy layer all around the outside of the cake that was barely edible. Everything else was delicious, and I had lots of fun decorating the top of the cake.

This was the first cheesecake I have ever made and it turned out perfect!! I made the crust with oreos and left out that chocolate because I prefer original cheesecakes. I also had to up the amount of oreos because it didn't make enough crust but not a big deal. Defenitly will make this again!! Thank you!

This was a great cheesecake! Great flavor.  I ended up just microwaving the caramels since they were taking forever in the double boiler.  My friends said it was a keeper recipe! I will definitely make this again.

I have made this twice, once with crushed oreo cookies, and once with oreo crumbs. If you just do the crumbs, 2 c is way too much in comparison to the butter and my crust was falling apart like crazy. If you do the oreo cookies, 2 cups is enougfh, but you have to make sure to put some wax paper on the bottom of the pan so that the crust will come off with the cake. other than that i did everything else the same as the recipe, except always milk chocolate chips and a few more of them

I need more stars! This makes an awesome cake!  My granddaughter, Gabi at  2 1/2 years old, and I  made this last weekend for her mama's birthday. I studied the article, Baking Cheesecake, Step by Step in preparation for making it. I am happy to say that the cake turned out perfectly and looked very professional.

I made this cheese cake for a good friends birthday, that's what she wanted.  First Timer here.....  Followed the NY Cheese Cake Recipe and followed this one for the chocolate/pecans/caramels additions.  Decorated my cake similar to the picture and it turned out excellent.

This turned out so pretty.  I followed the recipe pretty much as it states except I didn't melt the choco chips, I just threw them into the batter.  Also, I reserved half of the caramel for the top.  I wasn't really worried about the top cracking b/c I knew I was going to decorate the top.  I added caramel, pecans and some more choco chips to the top and it turned out beautiful.  I know my brother is going to love this for his b-day!

I bake each month for the office birthdays and this cheesecake was a HUGE hit with everyone.  I already had graham crackers crushed, so i used them to make the crust.  I've already been warned this will be a regular request from the gang.

This was sooooo decadent and delicious and go rave reviews.  I followed the recipe as is, but did drizzle chocolate and caramel sauce and some pecans on the top of the cake to make it pretty.  I cooked it in a water bath as I usually do with cheesecakes, but it still cracked.  I think the pecans created air pockets that I could not get out.  I will try to avoid this problem next time by mixing the melted caramels with pecans instead of layering them separately.  Like other reviewers, I used oreo cookie crumbs for the crust instead of the vanilla wafer crumbs.

Really good recipe! Just made it for my husbands birthday. I even used salted butter (on accident) and it turned out fine. Also did the "no-no" and used some not regular cream cheese (i used one regular, one reduced fat and one fat free) and it still turned out with only a minor amount of cracking on the top.

If I could give this recipe 15 stars I would, it's that good.  I did the recipe exactly as instructed and it was so wonderful.  I made it for my mom and dad's visit and they said that it was the best they'd ever had.  My husband loved it but I told him that it was definitely a "company" dessert because of the calorie count and the time it takes, but it is SO worth it.  I think next time I'm going to really slather on the butter on the pan sides so the caramel might come out easier, but that was no big deal.  This stuff is so good I would have eaten it right out of the pan.... thank you thank you thank you for this recipe!

Wow! This was excellent and a real crowd pleaser. It got rave reviews from every person who tried it. I had no problems with the cake cracking or sticking to the pan. I think this may be because the store was out of cheap springform pans so I bought a $17 (ouch!) pan. I definitely plan to make this again as soon as I have an excuse to do so!

This was my first cheesecake with "stuff" in it and it was great. I substituted white chocolate chips for the semi-sweet so I don't think it's as chocolatey as it would be - next time I'll follow the recipe (but it still tastes delicious). I also used a waterbath - no cracks. I did not, however, realize that the nuts and caramel were going to creep up the sides of the pan instead of staying on the bottom. Turned out perfect though.

This is a DELICIOUS recipe. FYI- I melted the caramels, etc. in a pan directly on the stove, as I do not have a double broiler and it all came out fine. Some work, but very rich!

My husband's daughter asked me to make a turtle cheesecake for her graduation party.  I found this recipe on your website.  This recipe totally blew everyone away.  It's the only way I can describe their reaction.  The graduate lives in IN.  We live in WI.  She took the (very small amount of) leftovers home on the plane with her.  Thank you for this fabulous recipe!  Lynn Fields

Yes, unfortunately, I did not read the review before putting the cake in the oven!  All was fine, however, I, too agree that the recipe should have mentioned the topping....the photo shows a topping, but no mention of it in the recipe.  For the topping, I just used store bought Hersheys Dark Chocolate ice cream topping, and caramel topping and a chopped nut combo that I got in the same aisle.  I took this cheesecake to our Fabulous Feminist Fundraiser tonight for the dessert auction.  It went for $175.00!!!!!! Starting bid was $10!  The table that won it said it was the best they had ever had and loved the crust/caramel/nuts part the best!!!!!

I have made this cheesecake multiple times (including as the groom's "cake" at our wedding --my husband loves it), and it's always a hit! 
I melted and mixed the chocolate chips into the batter the first time I made this, and it was too rich for us, so I either mix half into the batter unmelted or divide the caramel, pecans, and chocolate chips and sprinkle half of each on top of the crust, as the recipe calls for with the caramel and pecans, and use the other half on top of the cheesecake for decoration. It's delicious!

Try the original before making suggested changes.  It is delicious as is.  I like oreo as much as the next person but the original really gives a vanilla/caramel taste that contrasts the chocolate.  And the melted chocolate chips create a smooth consistent chocolate flavor in every bite.  Love it!!!

The caramel is runny, the flavor of the filling is poor at best.  It's not even worth the try to fix it up.  There are better recipes to use for sure.

Loved it!!! I made it w the Oreo crust and instead of mixing in the chocolate, I melted it and drizzled across the top then swirled with a knife before baking. It turned out so well that there is never one crumb left! I do advise putting it in a water bath to prevent cracking the cake. This is a no brainer. Even if you are a novice cheesecaker, YOU CAN DO THIS! :)

This cheesecake was delicious! Unfortunately for me, I do not know how to use or even have a spring form pan so instead I bought two Oreo pie crust and made two cakes with those. I reduced the cooking time by 15 minutes. I would suggest checking often for each over is different. 

I did not want to make it to chocolaty so I just mixed the chocolate chips in with the pecans. I only mixed half a cup of the pecans in with the batter and saved the other half to be on top of the cakes. I poured some caramel on the bottom of each cake and saved the rest for the middle and top of the cakes. I only filled half of the batter up in each pie then swirled some caramel around then layered the rest of the batter on top.

This cheesecake is fantatic!! I made it for Christmas dinner and it was a hit.  It is a bit rich and sweet though, so a small piece goes a long way.  I made a graham cracker crust and it was great! Next time I may use a bit less caramel, but either way, I loved it and will make it again. :-)

I made this exactly for a special church event and everyone said it was outstanding and wanted the recipe.  The only tiny thing I changed is the crust.  I used graham cracker crust because that is all I had in my pantry.  No need to change this recipe, b/c it is that outstanding and delicious.

All I can say is keep this recipe how it is.. 

The only the i changed was instead of mixing in chocolate i just swirled it... because i thought it would be too sweet with the chocolate drizzle and Carmel and i thought the Nuts weren't going to be good but it was a hit, great job guys

This is a great recipe that is not hard to make.  I have never made a cheesecake and everyone liked this one.  I used an oreo cookie crust and melted the caramels in the microwave.  I also put a half cup of milk chocolate chips on top of the caramel layer instead of mixing them in.  Once the cheesecake came out to the oven I drizzled caramel on top that I had saved and then sprinkled another half cup of chocolate chips on top.  It was great!

awesome recipe, I did not melt the choc chips and add them, I added mini chips to the batter and used a graham cracker crust.  Very rich and I get requests for this all the time.  Thanx for the recipe.......

I was very intimidated at the thought of baking a cheesecake but this was a gift to my husband for Valentines day.  My family all agreed it was the best cheesecake they had tasted.  I would only suggest having extra caramel, chocolate and pecans on hand to decorate the top as it is in the photo!  Five stars for yummy!

This was the first cheesecake I have ever made. I made it for the annual Christmas Toy Run Chili supper, it was a HIT. I did make a few changes though. I put 1/2 of the caramel/pecan mixture on the crust. On the top of the cheesecake I drizzled 1/2 c melted milk chocolate chips, 1 package (8oz.) Heath Milk chocolate toffee bits and the remaining caramel/pecan mixture. I baked it for the 40 min. but used the hot water bath technique. Loved it and will make again soon!

This cheesecake was great. I made the crust out of oreos just out of personal preference. I didn't melt the chocolate chips instead I added 1 cup of semi-sweet chips to the batter. After cooling the cheesecake I drizzled caramel and chocolate ice cream toppings over the top and sprinkled a few chopped pecans on top.

I made some moderations to this recipe.  I used an 8x8 square pan-- only 2 light cream cheese, i tried melting the caramels in milk--but would have rather used the caramel dip, used oreo's for crust and 1/2 of butter (the goo in the oreos help it stick together).  would make it again- very rich.

YUM! This was awesome. I made it for my son's 18th birthday. I did make a couple of changes. I used a can of boiled sweetened condensed milk in place of the caramels. I LOVE the taste. I swirled the melted chocolate into the batter to make it marbled instead of fully mixing the chocolate in. Thanks for the recipe. It will be used many times!

The taste was delicious, everyone enjoyed it!  I used light cream cheese (which I usually do for all cheesecakes) and it turned out wonderful.  My only problem was with the caramel...while baking, the caramel sauce got way too thin and leaked out of the pan.  So I was not left with a nice layer of caramel inside, but a burnt layer outside.  Next time I will start with half the amount of evaporated milk asked for.

I made this cheesecake for my own birthday party. I used the nilla wafers for the crust, however I added some finely chopped pecans to the crust. I also added a semi sweet chocolate ganache to cover the whole cake, sprinkled chopped pecans, and drizzled caramel over the top. It looked beautiful and tasted great.

This one made DH hit the floor! I modified as some suggested with the Oreo crust and swirling the chocolate and caramel through the cheesecake batter and it worked wonderfully. I submitted this for our company bake off and won the cheesecake division and the grand prize. This one's definitely a keeper!!!

this was the first cheesecake i've made and it turned out perfect! no oozing caramel and it didn't stick either. next time i think i will keep the crust the same but make 1 1/2 to 2 times the cheesecake. i thought the cheesecake flavor was a bit overwhelmed by all the caramel, chocolate and pecans.

made this one over the weekend and was a hit with my girlfriend!  used grahm craker crumbs and had to use at least 3 tbps additional butter than recipe called for, also added a dash of sugar. i think the crust was my favorite!  followed one of the suggestions and marbled the chocolate instead of stirring in.  turned out okay, but chocolate was not spread all the way throug the cheescake, was only really on top and got hard and crunchy after baking.  also saved some of the carmel and drizzled over the top, which was good. next time I will follow the recipe and see how it turns out.

Yum, Yum!  I made this for a pie/cake auction and it sold for over $20.00.  Is truly going to be a standard recipe - Thanks!  I'd recommend that you bake the cheese cake on the cookie sheet, too (not just baking the crust), as something (not cake - maybe butter or caramel?) dripped to the bottom of the oven.  Also, I greased and wax papered (and greased again) the bottom of the springform pan; next time I'll be sure to wax paper the sides, too - the caramel got pretty gooey.  But YUMMMMMMMM!  Thanks again for a terrific recipe!

I made this for our family Christmas Eve gathering, and it was very nearly inhaled.  I did make a few changes because of pantry options.  I used a premade chocolate pie crust, which I wish now I would have made the original crust because I think it would have tasted better, and caramel ice cream syrup, which I liked just fine.  Also, I added additional caramel syrup and pecans on the top.  I steamed my oven like you're supposed to do with homemade cheesecake, but I don't think I put the water in early enough, as I still got some minimal cracking.  But overall, it was amazing, and I would definitely make it again.

Fantastic recipe! I made this for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. I did modify it just a bit based on other reviews. I used the Oreo crumbs for the crust. I also swirled my chips into the cheesecake. Will definitely make again and again! Thank you for such a great and super easy recipe!!!

I made this for Father's Day and my dad and family loved it!
I took the suggestion of some reviews and swirled the melted chocolate into the cheesecake mixture instead of totally combining it. I accidentally only bought a half cup of pecans but it was the perfect amount.
It took quite a bit longer than 40 minutes to bake, probably closer to an hour for me
Will definitely make again!

This was  delicious!  Like a lot of the others I too went with the Oreo crust.  I also decide to make this a sweet and salty turtle cheesecake and used salted pecans as well as salted caramel pieces.  It turned out better than I could've possibly imagined and will no doubt be making this many more time to come.

Terrific premise- my crew and I don't think there's anything much better than Turtles.  

Most of the basic ingredients,  proportions and cook time for this recipe are just fine.

What I kept: 
Nilla wafer crust, ceam cheese base, toasted chopped pecans 

What I changed after reading other reviews:
1-) I used about 1/2 jar total of Stonewall Kitchen sea salt caramel sauce rather than melting a bag of caramel candies.  (1/4 jar for over crust and 1/4 jar for top decorating) 
2-) I used 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips( not melted)  mixed into the cheesecake batter, rather than melting the chocolate and making it a chocolate batter.
- other hint- put a pan under your spring form pan in the oven for any leaking 

It was a big hit for Christmas!  It is quite rich.  Small slices are plenty, so it serves a large gathering well- especially when other treats are plentiful.. 
 Will probably make it again for another special occasion.

I would give it five stars but it does not give you directions for making the topping.  Since it is pictured with this and would add to the taste how to finish it off should be part of the receipe

I will definitely make a his again. The caramel was amazing! What I will do differently next time though, I will not add the melted chocolate that the cheese. I think visually it will be more appealing with the white cream cheese on top. The light brown cheese color just wasn't all that pretty looking. It surely was tasty, but I may try just drizzling the melt d chocolate on the top, after it has cooled.

A great cheesecake!  I followed some of the other suggestions using an Oreo crust, mini chocolate chips in the vanilla cheesecake, and splitting the carmel/pecan layer between bottom on the crust and the top after baking.  Everyone loved it.  There was not a crumb left.

I just pulled this out of the oven, and my cheesecake looks nothing like anyone else's.  With the batter poured on top of the crust, caramel, and pecans,  per the directions, how does the cheesecake come out looking like the photo?  Is everyone pulling my leg that it comes out looking like the photo?  Well, you fooled me!

This is a great recipe! I followed a few changes. I used a package of Oreo cookies, added the butter and baked as directed. Followed the recipe and put the melted Carmel and pecans on th crust. Made the cheese cake. Cut in the melted chocolate and caramel like suggested. Turned out perfect. Baked as directed..40 mins at 350... Left it in the oven to cool. No cracks, perfect   Drizzled leftover Carmel and chocolate and added the rest of the pecans to the top. Totally looks as amazing as it tastes!

I didn't really understand this recipe why is the caramels and pecans on the bottom and also it was too much of the Carmel mixture but I followed the recipe just like it said,  but it's cooking I'll let you know if it was worth it,....ok all done  very hard to come out of the pan probably will use parchment paper with lots of butter and will not put all the caramel mixture and will not add chocolate to the mixture but I will when done and cooked drizzle with chocolate and caramels with pecans  and sprinkle chocolate chips on top my review stands at 2 stars

This is a great cheesecake for a large crowd.  The recipe makes quite a large size cheesecake.  The flavor so are delicious.  I did find that the caramel ontop of the crust made it hard to cut through.  I substituted ground up pretzels for the graham crackers.  You never would have know it was pretzels.

I decided to make a cheesecake for the man that I am recently dating. I couldn't find my recipe for turtle cheesecake so I came here, since I have found a lot of amazing recipes in the past. Sadly, this was not one of them. The texture was strange and the taste was off.

My 20-something kids made this for Christmas dinner. Had a couple problems. For one, my son used a full 14oz can of evaporated milk rather than 5oz, so the caramel sauce was pretty thin and leaked a bit. I think the cream cheese was still pretty cold when they used it, and my daughter didn't beat the mixture until it was smooth. She did add the melted chocolate to the cheese mixture. So the cake came out a grainy-looking light brown with some caramel eruptions over the edges. It wasn't attractive and looked nothing at all like the picture. It was, however, delicious! All the flavors make their presence known and blend well.

If I had given in to my control neurosis, I would have read the comments before cooking, beat the cheese longer, sprinkled in the chocolate instead of blending, checked the amount of milk, and drizzled the top with stuff. But it was my kids' first attempt at cheesecake, so I let them do it. They had fun, and it was delicious.

Made this with a friend for her anniversary. They were kind and brought me over a piece. I pretty much licked my plate clean!! With all cheesecakes make sure you cover the bottom with 1 large piece of tin foil so it come up the sides. Bake it in a water bath (this will keep it from cracking). The tin foil will keep the water out. Let it cool in a cracked oven once it is finished cooking. Once cooled cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge until the next day.

I used half Oreo cookie crumbs, half (boxed)  graham cracker crumbs and used 4 tablespoons melted butter.  I baked the crust for approx 10 minutes and then let it cool.  For ease I used Mrs Richardsons caramel sauce and did layer it on the crust with the toasted pecans.  For the filling I made it like the recipes stated but added mini chocolate chips to the filling and swirled in 3 big dollops of the caramel sauce.  I baked in a water bath as that is how I always bake cheesecake.  I do let it initially cool down a bit in the oven with the door open when finished baking.  After chilling overnight I drizzled the caramel sauce and Mrs Richardsons fudge sauce on top and sprinkled with the toasted pecans.  Just sold it at a benefit auction for $45.00.  This is always a hit with family and friends.  Thank you! **To keep the caramel sauce from leaking out (like other have said) I just ran the crust up the sides about 1/2".  Easy fix, problem solved.

It was my first attempt at a cheesecake and it turned out awesome!  I think I should have let it cool before putting it in the fridge.  When I looked at it the next day, there was a big crack down the middle, but my family didn't care, they devoured it!  I would definitely make it again!

I made this recipe and got rave reviews. Everyone wanted the recipe. only complaint was they want me to make 3 next time instead of one. I didn't put the chocolate in the cream cheese mixture.,just on top with nuts and caramel. Will definitely keep as a favorite

I was not a big fan of this cheesecake.  The flavors did not blend together.  The caramel layer was too much and did not seem to go with the cheese cake.  Maybe a layer of chocolate or nuts on top of the caramel would have helped.

This cheesecake was amazing!  I did make a few changes to the original recipe: 
i) I substituted oreo crumbs for the crust, 
ii) I made a chocolate swirl cheesecake by adding the melted chocolate to only a portion of the prepared cheesecake filling, and I also added some mini chocolate chips to the batter
iii) I did not have caramels but I did have some butterscotch chipits, so I melted the chipits down, added some milk, corn syrup and a bit of oil and it worked out great!
iv) I saved some pecans, melted chocolate and melted butterscotch to garnish the top of the cheesecake.

I will definitely be making this impressive cheesecake again!

Its my first time make cheesecake from scratch. I used two tsp of vanilla ,I mix half a cup of unsweetened cocoa in the crust, three eggs, I maked salted caramel and pecan walnuts chocolate chip mixed with some nilla wafer crumbs and the caramel over it. I was so good. I thought I was doing something special with nilla wafers but look on here and there it is.

Made this recipe and was very disappointed. First of all if you follow the directions, the pecans and caramel are between the crust and the cheesecake, not at all like the picture suggests. When the cheesecake was done, it seperated from the crust which stuck to the pan, so was unservable to guests. We pieced it together and ate with the family. Was ok, but not great. I will not make this recipe again.

Flavor was great. It needs to bake longer, otherwise, it ends up being too mushy. I will bake longer next time.

Absolutely amazing! I took this to a church dinner and on a table with 20 other desserts this was the first to be gone. The basic recipe is exactly right for a turtle cheesecake in my opinion, but I did make a few changes. I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and didn't mix any chocolate into the "cheese" part of the cake.  I also used a water bath and cooked it for about 8 minutes longer than stated in the recipe.  Will definitely make again, and not change a thing.

My Fmily goes crazy over this cheesecake.  I have made some alterations.  I do not put the carmel in the bottom, makes the cheescake hard to cut.  I used heavy cream instead of evaporated milk for the carmels, make the carmels smoother once melted.

My first cheesecake, ever.  It turned out well, but I might try a simple cheesecake next time.  Found the hint to replace part of the cream cheese with silky tofu and I will also try that.

I read some but not all of the reviews and a few things came out weird. I used caramel sauce instead of melting caramels, but I probably shouldn't have used as much evaporated milk, because the caramel sauce never firmed up. It stayed liquid throughout the cooking process. I will admit I didn't let the crust cool enough before adding it, but I wound up with batter floating on top of the caramel "layer." Even after it came out of the oven, there was still liquid.

In the end, we froze it overnight instead of just refrigerating it, and it all firmed up pretty well, but not the caramel. So I wound up with crust that was stuck to the pan topped with sauce topped with the cheesecake, which was dense, but tasty. We kind of liked having the "sauce," but I wish I could have sliced it like cake. I think next time, I might just make the batter and make the sauce to use as a side condiment.

Delicious! I made it exactly how the recipe said, except I added a topping like the pictures: caramel drizzle, chocolate drizzle and chopped pecans. The only thing that would make it better is if it were taller. =)

Awesome recipe! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was a little too sweet. I think I may use unsweetened chocolate next to cut down on the sugar. Otherwise, it was superb and got rave reviews. The only modifications I made was microwaved the caramel and milk as someone suggested, as opposed to heating them on the burner. I did use grahm cracker crumbs because that is all I had, but next time I will def try the oreo crumb crust. I think it will taste a lot better. Last, I reserved some of the caramel mix and pecans so I can add them to the top of the cheesecake. I also melted more chocolate chips with 2 tbsp of butter to drizzle it on top. It looked as good as it tasted!

This was a wonderful recipe!  I made a couple of changes.  I used chocolate crumbs instead of vanilla wafers.  I reserved some of the cheesecake batter - to half I added the melted chocolate chips and the other half, I added some of the caramel sauce.  I swirled these 2 into the other batter before baking.  When the cake came out and was cool, I put some reserved pecans and caramel on top.  Then, because I had some semisweet ganache on hand, I melted the ganache and drizzled that on top too.  What raves I received!  Definitely a keeper.

I used an oreo crust, chocolate chips in the batter, and premade caramel sauce per other comments and loved it!  I took this to a super bowl party and got rave reviews!  Definitely take the extra time to toast the pecans.  I topped the cheesecake with crushed pecans and chocolate ships and caramel and chocolate sauce.

I also didnt mix the chocolate in with the cheesecake mix, instead i melted it and poured it on top with some carmel and crushed pecans. i will always use this recipe when making cheesecake from now on!

Very good.  Didn't change anything, except drizzled chocolate and caramel on top with chopped pecans.  Got lots of compliments.  It was a mess though getting it out of  the pan.  Maybe I didn't butter the pan enough.

I served this at a holiday party at my Condo and everyone loved it!  People even asked me for the recipe for the delicious tasting and looking dessert.  The only thing I did different was to save about a 1/4-1/2 cup of the caramel mix & a handful of the pecans to drizzle & sprinkle on the top after it had cooled for appearance.  I also only baked the pecans for 4 min because they were finely chopped!.  I RECOMMEND you make this!!!!  WE LOVED IT!

One of three recipes I used for a 3-layer wedding cake.  Not my personal favorite, but got the best reviews from guests.  I put 1/2 the caramel on the base, and mixed the other 1/2 with a portion of the batter.  I also mixed chocolate into another portion of the batter, and left a third portion plain, then marbled the three varieties in the pan.

Excellent recipe. Big hit with my family.  I did lower the baking temp to 300 for the cheesecake to prevent cracking.  I used the semi-sweet chocolate chips and marbled through the filling. However, the melted chocolate became solid when chilled and make big chunks of chocolate that I didn't care for.  Does any know of chocolate that will stay softer when chilled?

I was trying to replicate a recipe I made years ago and loved.  This one seemed close- but didn't come out quite right.  The crust was too hard and very tough to serve, It was a lot of work so I'll probably keep searching for another great Thanksgiving desert recipte instead of this one.

This cheesecake was heavenly!  I made it for Christmas day dessert and it was a huge hit!  I added additional chocolate chips and pecans on top for garnish, but otherwise did not make any changes.  It is definately going into my permanent recipe file for sure!

I also used an oreo crust and swirled the chocolate to make a marbled look. I used the rest of the carmel and pecans with some dark choclate chips to wrap around.  I also used a dark chocolate ganish to pour over the top. It turned out great.

This recipe got rave reviews!  I followed some of the other reviewer's advice and used an oreo crust and attempted to marble the chocolate, carmel and regular cheesecake layers. I used a water bath as advised and it turned out great.  Although the marbling didn't work out as I had hoped, it tasted wonderful and everyone asked for the recipe!

made with ingredients as listed but with mini chocolate chips and low fat cream cheese (did not read until after shopping that this was not recommended). I melted the carmel in  the microwave, stirring every 30 sec. I left the chips whole and just stirred into the batter. Everything was GREAT. My cake did crack a little on top while baking (perhaps too long? or the low-fat?) TASTES GREAT!

This was superb! I made it for Christmas along with some other desserts and everyone complimented me the most on this one! I little more time consuming to make than some of my other cheesecakes, but it was definately worth the effort! Thanks!

I made this for a local compatiton and took first place. Great cheesecake, everyone I know loves it. Instead of the semi sweet, I used a little more milk chocolate and once out of the oven, I drizzled with carmel icecream topping. This is a great recipe!

I liked this recipe quite a bit.  Only a couple of complaints. It was too sweet.  I served it to an office of 50 men under the age of 35 & most of them thought that the sweetness could've been subdued just a bit.  Also had some issues with it sticking to the side of the pan.  I will use wax paper next time on the sides to alleviate this problem.  Will make again, although probably only for a large lot of sweet-toothed ladies.  I also added melted chocolate to the top & decorated with a few pecans, all the men thought it was store bought... which was cool.  I used 2 semi-sweet Bakers chocolate squares, melted them in a double boiler, poured it into a sandwich bag & snipped off about 1/8" off the corner of the bag.  Drizzled in a crisscross pattern all around the cake.  It looked amazing.  So for esthetic I give the recipe 5 stars, for flavour (or rather overabundance), I give it a 4.

Great!  I used shortbread cookies for the crust and decorated the top with crushed pecans, chocolate and carmel drizzles and a chocolate turtle on each piece.  I donated it for a bake auction funraiser and it made over $30!

This was very very good! I used the recipe as it was, well kinda, I made individual cheesecakes for everyone in my office. I portioned it out by eye, and I added the extra chocolate chips in the cheesecake batter! I am now the resident pastry chef at work!!!

Excellent flavor but a little problem with the carmel layer and crust separating from the cheesecake when trying to serve it.  Maybe a little less condensed milk mixed in with the carmels would make the carmel a little firmer and not as "runny".  Also, I'd probably add a few more pecans on the next try.  Would recommend it if you like a very sweet cheesecake.  Very yummy.  Sinfully delicious.

This recipe was really good, even though I did make a few changes.  Instead of the individual caramels, I used caramel/toffee ice cream topping; and I also used a really nice Ghiardelli chocolate in place of the choc. chips.  The only other change  I made was making individual (not mini) cheesecakes instead of one big one.  Overall, a really good recipe.

This cake was wonderful. I served it at a luncheon I hosted and got rave reviews.  Its absolutely decadent and not really that hard to make, just take your time.  Of course I added a shot of bourbon whiskey to the cream cheese and chocolate mixture to give it my own kicked up twist!!

fantastic! this was my first ever cheesecake and it was great. really easy and delicious. i changed the following: i used digestive biscuits (i live in england where it is more common to make cheesecake base with digestives rather than graham crackers) for the base. i also used light margarine instead of butter. i made 1 1/2 times base cos i like a really this base. i used normal milk to make the caramel instead of evaporated and it worked fine, and i used light cream cheese. it was delicious and still very rich - next time i might even try extra light. i reserved some caramel to drizzle on top which looked really nice. my only complaint is that the caramel wasn't a distinct layer as i had expected. i think it was kind of absorbed into the crust and cheesecake, which was fine though, cos it was delicious. i'll definitely make this again!

Cheescake part of recipe was great, but the caramel layer went hard as a rock once refrigerated and everyone was unable to eat the bottom layer of the cake.  Next time I will just leave out the caramel layer and drizzle the caramel on top.

This turned out fantastic even thought I sort of goofed when making it.  I added too much evaporated milk to the caramels, since I realized I had done this and didn't want to waste the caramels I just drizzled a small amount over the crust, poured some of the caramel into the batter, and drizzled some on top as well.  The cheesecake turned out beautiful, no cracks at all!  Everyone raved about it and coworkers asked me to make another.  Great recipe!

I have made this terrific cheesecake twice now. It is simply divine and so many want the recipe from me. It is easy to prepare and an especially nice dessert at Christmas time. I went one step further and decorated the outside of the cheesecake with fancy wired ribbon and put a bow on it and gave it  as a gift. Talk about knocking someone's socks off!!!!!  [

MMMM!  Did this ever get rave reviews!  If you're someone who can't stop at one slice, though--beware!  This cake is not only lethal, it's addictive.  One of my family's new favorites!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

This is a wonderful dessert.  It wasn't even that hard to make.  It looked like it could be part of a fancy dessert tray in a nice restaurant.
