These are good, but more like muffin tops than cookies.  My husband said I should put blueberries in them instead of raisins. They got even better the next day after being stored in zipper bags.

I made these with chopped prunes instead of raisins, because I wanted a cookie I could name a sugarplum for our shop.  This wasn't it, but it was good.  Stayed moist for a long time.   Thanks, Sandy.

They were good -- very, VERY sweet.  I baked them for 30 minutes (based on other reviews) and the center is still QUITE moist.  I also subbed 1 c whole wheat flour to try to add a bit of nutrition, & next time I'll try reducing the sugar for the filling.

Boy, am I glad that I found this!  I havent' used raisins in cookies in so long, because I don't like the hard oatmeal cookies that always seem to turn out in the end.  These are so soft, with a mild flavor.  This is a keeper!

I had about 1/2 cup raisins still left in the bag, so went ahead & added them too. They were a little bland. The flavor reminded me of eating rice pudding. I would cut in half the amount of Cinnamon/Sugar to sprinkle on top. I had about twice as much as I needed, & ended up throwing rest away. They ended up having a cake like consistency, very moist.

I followed this recipe to the letter. These are so delicious!  They remind me of cookies my grandmother used to bake when I was growing up.  Thanks for the delicious walk down memory lane!

My husband loved these, and I took a huge batch to church and they were gone within minutes. The kids even loved them. I added a 1/2 cup of pecans and that was yum. Great recipe.

Very soft cookies and a little bland. I substituted blueberries and added a small amount of cinnamon to the dough and they remiinded me of snickerdoodles. Overall not bad, but not that great either

These aren't my fav cookies, but they're pretty tasty!  These cookies are very soft, almost cake-like.  My friends, family and I gobbled these down.  :)  I didn't need to bake them as long as suggested.  I took off about a min of time.

Excellent, tender cookie with good keeping qualities. I made as suggested, except I rolled them in the cinnamon sugar mixture. Oh. I guess I added an extra 1/4 c raisins, too. Wonderful, old-fashioned recipe.

These were awesome.  I made them and they were gone within the hour.  One of my kids hate raisins but ate the most.  Thank you for a great recipe!!!! Thank you also for helping my kids to eat something they hated.  It's a keeper.

These cookies are a little bland, but very  light.  It would make a nice tea cookie.  My 2nd time around I added the cinnamon sugar into the cookie mix, and they were better.  My husband enjoyed these a lot more than I did.

They came out beautifully.  First baked item to start off fall.      I did leave out the raisins and used stevia instead to lighten them up.

Followed the recipe with only one change.  Added chopped walnuts.  Baked 12-13 minutes.  Hmmm good!  Will definitely make these again.

Absolutely love these cookies.  Apart from adding some choc chips I followed the recipe as is.  I really don't think it could be improved at all.  I got 6 dozen cookies and would probably have got 7 dozen except for my kids who kept helping themselves to the mixture!!!!  This one is a keeper! I made them for a school fund raiser but I don't know how many will actually get there.

These were excellent.  Just like my ``babba``used to make when I was a
child.  As suggested, I cut the sugar
and cinnamon in half to sprinkle on top
but changed to brown sugar instead of white.

I just didn't roll the cookies in cinnamon and sugar because that isn't what I had as a child.  Other than that, the cookies are delicious.

My husband and I LOVED these.  I had to add a lot more flour than the recipe calls for, but that could be because of the humidity in my region.  They still turned out very well.

Easy and moist-what more can you ask from a cookie?  Without the raisins, they taste like pumpkin cookies.
