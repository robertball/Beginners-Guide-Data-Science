I was just a bit hesitant to try out this recipe but thought what the heck. I did make a few changes because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. Mostly I change the cheese to a combination of Swiss and pepper jack. I also did double the garlic. Yum Yum Yum. I will definitely try this one again. Oh yes, I also used regular milk instead of the almond milk.

It was good.    Even my 13 year old said it was ok.
