I used torteneli and omitted the onion because the marinara already has onion pieces in it. I also did not have celery so I used celery seed instead. All in all this was pretty good.

I wanted to like this better than I did but it was just a bit weird. I think I used ravioli that was too big. Maybe cheese tortellini would be better. Interesting idea, though.
