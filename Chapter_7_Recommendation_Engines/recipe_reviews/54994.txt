My fiance loved it! He said it tasted like regular meatloaf but was excited that it was a bit healthier with the turkey. I added some rosemary, thyme and parsley for extra flavor. Served with mashed potatoes and carrots.

***Update...I have made this two more times and it is a major hit every time! Try it!

Amanda:  I tried your recipe so as to compare it to mine and guess what?  We make a really good Turkey Loaf.  Thanks for helping me make sure I was making mine right (and delicious).  REVISED 8/27/09: STILL a great recipe.  Made this last night into "muffins"...used 2 lbs. Ground Turkey...omitted the egg and added a can of Cr. of Chicken...used poultry seasoning "to taste"...kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Popped into muffin pans and baked an hour at 350. Note:  Don't worry that the recipe is extremely moist before baking...that's the payoff...cripsy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside.

Ground Turkey comes prepacked in 1 lb packs, so I used 2 lbs to make this.  To make it even healthier I used oatmeal in place of the breadcrumbs.  It was very good and made enough for 6 servings.  Although I will continue to try new ground turkey recipes out of interest, I will most likely use this one again.

I saw a similar recipe on this site that had salsa included, so I added 1/4 cup to this recipe.  Overall, it was very tasty, but a little salty.  Next time I will use less salt and a 1/2 tbsp of poultry seasoning instead. Easy to prepare and good enough to make again!

I personally love this recipe, while my bf thinks it's "pretty good".  I think that he prefers the standard ground beef meatloaf, but we both like the health benefits of using Turkey.  On my first attempt, I followed the directions as is.  On my second try I rolled it with a layer of mashed sweet potatoes and a thin layer of cranberry sauce.
Great recipe, definitely a keeper!

I enjoyed, very easy.  Based on other suggestions I added rosemary, black pepper, minced onion, and a few other spices.  I chopped a green pepper and added to mix which was a nice change in a few bites.  I will probably use 3/4 the breadcrumbs next time - it was a little dry for my taste (but I wasn't sure if that had anything to do with spices and pepper added)  Very good recipe - thanks so much!

I've made this a few times now, and have cut down slightly on the bread crumbs.  Otherwise, it's very tasty just as it is.  Also, my one-year-old loves it!

I love this recipe, it takes less than 10 minutes to put everything together and then you just pop it in the oven. I have also added some extra spices and a little EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) to give it a little something extra.

This is a great  recipe.   We usually make a double batch and serve one as meatloaf muffins and the other I freeze in a loaf pan for later.  My picky 5 year old eats this everytime (without ketchup).  The muffins usually cook very quickly ~ 30 minutes, but I use a meat thermometer to make sure.  This is a regular at our house, and it makes great left over sandwiches.

this is an awesome meatloaf - right before it finishes baking (bout 10-15 minutes ) I mix a dry package of turkey gravy mix with 1 cup of milk amd pour it over the meatloaf and what a rich gravy you get - served it with mashed potaotes and some collard greans and cornbread for an awesome sunday dinner whole family loved it !!!

We loved this! My modifications: I had 1.33 lbs of turkey and used 3/4 cups of bread crumbs.  I also included one finely chopped celery stalk and 2 T of Campbell's Creamy Mushroom with Roasted Garlic Soup (no water added).  Then I spread a bit of the Campbell's over the top. The reduced bread crumbs + the soup really created a super-moist turkey loaf. Yum!

This turned out perfectly!  I cut back just slightly on the breadcrumbs, and it was just right.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli... delicious!

I liked it, different than my meat loaf- which is better- sorry. I thought it was going to be bland but it wasn't. Nice and healthy- thanks for sharing..Good to change up your meatloaf.

This recipe is ok ... I mixed the poultry seasoning into the loaf, cut back the bread crumbs to 1 cup and added 1/4 milk as it seemed dry. You really taste the poultry seasoning which isn't a bad thing but the sage in it was a little too much. I used a medium onion as size was not noted. It was ok with gravy and traditional "turkey" sides. I liked it best the next day cold on a sandwich with mayo and give it 4 stars cold.

I made this dish using a turkey I had already baked.  In addition, I put in broken up pieces of french bread instead of fine bread crumbs, and substituted Campbells Crean of Mushroom soup for the egg.  It was very good!

Just enjoyed this wonderful loaf.  My picky husband had 3 helpings!  Used 2 lbs of turkey, 2 eggs, fresh parsley and a chopped zucchini and carrot and oatmeal instead of breadbrumbs.  Super yummy and also the first meatloaf I actually liked.....and I hate meatloaf.  If you are looking for helathy try this!!

I used chicken flavored stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs, added some extra seasoning (herb chicken seasoning, garlic, and celery flakes).  I also added a couple of Tbsp. of milk for good measure.  I was surprised at how big of a hit it was with my family - even my 5 yr. old and 2 yr. old had seconds.  We topped it off with a bit of cranberry relish instead of gravy, as some suggested.  It added just the right kick!

Was looking for a quick meal with few ingredients.  This turned out well and had a nice flavor.  Here is what I used/did different because they were what I had on hand...and because I didn't read the baking time until I had everything mixed....  1 lb ground turkey 1 chopped onion 1 egg beaten 1 cup dry stuffing mix (stovetop w/ cranberries) salt & pepper to taste  Mixed together, placed in my pampered chef loaf pan.  After not having read to allow for 1 1/2 hours for baking, I decided to pop into microwave...about 8 minutes until thermometer read over 170.  Within 1/2 hour I had a complete microwaved meal as i served it with a pasta side dish.  Quick and easy, tasted good.  Will make again.

This was pretty good! This was the first time I've ever used ground turkey. I was looking for a recipe with simple ingredients, and easy to make. I had everything I needed on hand. I followed the recipe to the letter, and it was pretty yummy. A tad dry, next time I may add another egg, or cut back on the bread crumbs a little.

Very flavorful recipe!  My entire family and neighbor thought it was wonderful!  Instead of the bread crumbs, I used 3/4 cup oatmeal (healthier) and 1/2 cup milk (since some reviewers said it was slightly dry).  I will make this very often, and it was so EASY!  Excellent recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did cut down on the bread crumbs but other than that it was great!  My fiance and I rarely eat beef.  So I'm always looking for new recipes.  Also, he likes ketchup baked on his.  So I baked half with ketchup and half without.  I loved it!

Sorry, these were "spongy" and had way too many bread crumbs in them (that was the overwhelming taste) - I did not have poultry seasoning and used Italian seasoning & parmesan cheese. I don't think that would change the texture that much. Drowning in marinara sauce, they were edible...

Wow, I'm pretty picky when it comes to a turkey meatloaf but this was excellent for being such a simple recipe.  I made it with the stuffing, and rolled it as noted on the bottom of the recipe.  It was a little messy but it all goes into the loaf pan anyway so the rolled up meat didn't have to be perfect.  I used regular ground turkey (the 93/7, not fat free).  It was delicious.  I also served with steamed green beans, cranberry sauce and I made a light gravy out of chicken stock, poultry seasoning and a flour/water mixture.  It was very good and I will make this again.  It was so easy too!!!!

My family did not care for this turkey loaf.  The poultry seasoning was very over powering.  If I make it again I will only add 1 or 2 teaspoons of poultry seasoning.

Incredibly bland. Having read reviews I added a little BBQ sauce a touch of olive oil and a touch of allspice.I even stuffed the centre with sage and onion stuffing. The result was sad with hardly any flavour.I will now mix up whats left add LOADS of spices and fry up into burgers and see how that works. I do not suggest you bother with this recipe.

This is the first time my family had turkey loaf and they loved it! I have tried regular meatloaf and half and half loaf (half turkey, half beef). I did add a few things to make it more tasteful. I added 2 tablespoons of sweet baby rays original bbq sauce, 3 tablespoons of organic ketchup and 1 tablespoon of worsterschire sauce and everybody loved it! And that's including 5 SMALL children from 9 months all the way through age 10! Try this recipe it's a great starter recipe for a turkey loaf!!!!

I cut the salt to 1/2 tsp, as were trying to cut our sodium intake, also accidentally mixed in the poultry seasoning instead of sprinkling on top. Turned out pretty good, just a tiny bit bland. Will definitely be trying this again, with some minor adjustments.

This was so good and so healthy!  I cut back on breadcrumbs a bit and used Jennie-O 99% fat free ground turkey.  The kids gobbled it up!

I made this thinking my husband probably wasn't going to like it but he actually loved it and so did my 4 year old!  Another healthy recipe to add to my rotation.

I'll have to admit I made this with chicken, but it was still absolutely great. 
The chicken seasoning I used also included salt, so instead of 2 tsps of salt, I used 1 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of chicken seasoning, and it worked out perfectly.
I also used a little less breadcrumbs.
I served it with baked stuffed pumpkin, and it was totally consumed, with compliments. :)
