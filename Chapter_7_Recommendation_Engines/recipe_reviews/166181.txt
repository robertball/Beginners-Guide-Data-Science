Good combination of ingredients, but for our taste it needed a little more.  I added half a cup of canned mushrooms and 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes.  I only used a 16ounce can of red tomatoes and didn't add the red cherry pepper (didn't have any!)  The biggest improvement for me was that I blended the veggies in a blender after cooking.  (Just a bit!)  This made it much creamier and smoother.  (Plus my kids didn't pick out the chunks of veggies!) I also added a whole cup (rather than a 1/2) of heavy cream as another reviewer wrote. I also boiled the chicken in chicken broth to cook it (juicier) and then cut it up and added it to the sauce to simmer for 30 minutes.  Yummo! Thanks for the recipe!

Of all the Riggie recipes on Allecipes this one is the closest to the traditional NY recipe. My husband is from Mohawk, NY, near Utica, and this is one of his favorite all time meals. I did make a few changes so that it was more like his sisters recipe. For the peppers I used 3 jalapenos, 1 habanero pepper, and 3 teaspoons of Asian chili garlic sauce (for all of you who thought this needed a kick you should try adding the chili garlic sauce, it makes any dish pop!). I also added a small can of black olives, a small can of mushrooms (you could use fresh), and I increased the the cream to 1 cup (to save calories you could use milk). The key to this recipe is letting it simmer before adding the rigatoni and cream. Just let everything else simmer on low covered in the pan for about 1 - 1 1/2 hours. This makes everything soft and flavorful. Them after an hour or so add the cream, let simmer for 10 minuets. Then cook your rigatoni. Then add the sauce to the cooked rigatoni. Stir well and serve. It's even better the next day after the sauce has absorbed into the rigatoni. Delicious! My Upstate New York Husband loved it!

Excellent !   We are from Central NY and this is as good as any restaurant there!   Great for an informal dinner party and easy to modify if you like.  Used some beautiful white pasta bowls and served it with crusty bread.

EXCELLENT! The only thing I did differently was to use a jar of pasta sauce in place of the crushed tomatoes...PERFECT! This was very easy to make and the taste was amazing. I will be using this recipe often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Outstanding dish, so flavorful..a little spicy and spot on! I had a few turkey cutlets to use up, so I went with that instead of the chicken and I had half & half on hand so I used that. I served this with shaved parm cheese on top and a nice green salad. We loved this!

I took the other reviewers advice by doubling the cream and sticking the tomato/red pepper mixture in the food processor.  I didn't have any hot cherry or cubanelle peppers so that may account for the lack of flavor.  The recipe was OK, but nothing great...definitely needs more flavor.

This was very yummy.  I don't like hot peppers so I omitted them.  Instead I added orange bell peppers and mushrooms.  I found it needed more cream than it called for.  My family loved it and kept going back for more!  I found it a tad bland so I added a few drops of red hot sauce to my plate and it was really good!  I recommend this!

Super tasty! I couldn't find hot cherry peppers, so I added a bit of cayenne when cooking. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious!  I used about 2/3 of a 15 oz jar of roasted red peppers cut up, and since I did not have the cubanelle or hot cherry peppers, I cautiously dripped in hot habenero sauce until the heat was just right.  This was outstanding!

This was simple dinner to make for a card night at my house and everyone "liked" it.  I am from Centry NY and have had Chicken Riggies from just about every restaurant that serves them.  I would have like a little more flavor.  Next time I will play with the ingredients and see if I can get something closer to what I love in the riggies served in my favorite restaurants.

We didn't care for this.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using sweet cherry peppers instead of hot ones (I couldn't find the hot peppers) and bumped up the heat with some hot pepper flakes.  It tasted like unseasoned spaghetti sauce with chicken and peppers in it.  We ate it, but it certainly was nothing remarkable, nor would I make it again.  Sorry, but thanks for letting me try.

Oh my gosh!  Soooo delicious!  I would give this recipe 10 stars!  My husband had 3rds!  I had never heard of most of the peppers, so I omitted all except the roasted red peppers & added some Herbert's seasoning, which is basically a spicier cajun type of lawry's, when I cooked the chicken.  I will make this again & again!

I tried this recipe to use up a far of roasted red peppers... it was pretty good! I used sour cream for the cream, and zesty tomato sauce instead of the tomatoes and other peppers. It was yummers. :-) Idk what Riggies are supposed to taste like, but this was great. Thanks for the recipe!

Husband said it was ok, I thought it was good, and the teenager loved it, so 4 star it is.  Because this was something that popped up on an ingredient search when I had items to use, I did change it based on what I had on hand.  I already had a fire-roasted tomato/roasted red pepper puree on hand and had pickled, hot cherry peppers.  I chopped another couple of roasted red peppers and very finely minced the cherry peppers.  I added a cup of white wine, doubled the cream and also added a cup of freshly grated parmesan directly to the sauce when I added the cream.  It was actually much better after it sat for a while and the pasta absorbed more of the sauce.  I would make again with my revisions.

this recipe came out great. My wife Loves Uticas' own Teddy's riggies. And she said this one was really close. I have made others without that compliment. Didn't have cubanelle peppers used roasted red peppers. Will be making this soon. Serves more like 8-10. No complaint here! Made Italian Parmesan Bread for Bread Machine went perfectly with it!

This is the closest I’ve found to authentic Utica Riggies. Like others have said, mushrooms are a great addition as are hot chili peppers. Thank you for this recipe.

My first taste of Chicken Riggi was this past July, since then I have made it at least 6 times with different variations. Hard to find the Cubanelle peppers so I use green bell. Next time I make I will use the cherry peppers and always add chili flakes. Also, I use penne over the rigatoni. Always a huge hit, you won't be disappointed.

Spent 5 years living in CNY, and I love riggies. I added a 1/2 cup of mushrokms, used a jalapeno pepper since I could only find sweet cherry peppers, and loved the result.  Tastse just like what you find in Utica.

Since I didn't have the hot peppers on hand that were mentioned in the recipe, I added cayenne and red pepper flakes.  Fantastic!

I took mrsjohnsons’ advice to simmer for a few hours and increase cream. I have no luck with getting boneless chicken breasts to become tender so I went with my old stand-by, bone-in chicken breasts, and took them out after an hour, to remove the skin, debone and chop, then added back in with cooked rigatoni.  I used four pickled cherry peppers which was enough heat for me (and too much for my non-heat loving son).  Result was fantastic!  Thanks so much and I’ll definitely make this again.

This place is a good place to start but I made a few changes. Couldn't  find cubanelle peppers so I used Anaheim chilis instead, seasoned the chicken with Italian herbs while it cooked in addition to salt and pepper, blended all the veggies and added it with the chicken to the pot and about a cup of cream, and about a tsp of red pepper flakes. Came out fantastic. 4 stars as a base 5 with a few additions. Don't know how it compares to chicken riggies from New York but it's pretty friggin good.

I make this about twice a month, and given that I make several different things, that is saying something. If you are not using elephant garlic cloves, you might want to use five cloves instead of three. Also add one moremore pepper to

Be sure to cook your pasta AFTER cooking everything else. My pasta fell apart because I cooked it before everything else. The whole dish just seemed to lack something.

This was Delicious! I did double the cream. I only had jarred cherry peppers but they worked well. Used the called for amount. I seeded two and put one whole in. Perfect heat. I also added olives which I don't think changed the flavor but added color. Ha.  I added about two tbs of tomato paste as my sauce was pretty thin..it helped! Very good recipe.

Awesome- awesome-awesome!! The only thing I changed was to run the sauce through the blender so there were no "chunks" for the kiddos. They ate a bunch of veggies without even knowing it!

Reviewing based on the recipe as written. This took a lot of doctoring. Added more salt, a hefty pinch of sugar & white wine vinegar to make it taste like the classic version from Central NY. Recipe as written is bland.

Good recipe, but mom always made her riggies with hot cherry peppers from the jar - or better yet, fresh - instead of cubanelle peppers.  Much more zip! ;)

CNY'er/Riggie Lover here - this is a great recipe, closest to the original I've had. Like many, I increased the amount of cream up to 1c. (but used light cream) and couldn't find cherry peppers so used peppadews instead. My suggestion for those who say it needs more flavor is double the garlic, make sure you season the chicken extra well while cooking, and maybe even add a splash of wine to the sauce before adding the pasta. Glad everyone is getting to know the riggies I grew up enjoying :)

This was good, maybe a little spicy for me. But with noodles and garlic bread it wasn't too spicy...very good for the first time made. :)

Really great recipe!  I don't like it too spicy so I left out the hot cherry peppers and the cubanelle pepper gave it just enough spice.  canned mushrooms and olives make it more traditional.  And I added mozzarella cheese instead of the parm cheese
