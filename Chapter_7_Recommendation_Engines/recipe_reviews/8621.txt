Quick and delicious!  I made this for my husband and 3 kids and it was great.  Here's my review and changes I made...

I would echo the other reviews in reccommending the use of low sodium soup.  

I used milk in place of the wine and added more thant 1/4 cup to adjust the "sauciness" to my taste.  

I garlic powdered and peppered my chicken while cooking it for additional flavor.  

Next time, I'm going to saute some mushrooms with the chicken.  

Overall, very tasty!  Even better, it was quick, easy and family friendly.  A new staple in my monthly menu.  Thanks!

This recipe is fabulous!  Very tasty.  I somehow missed the part where it says to CUBE the chicken so I used full chicken breasts.  They were very moist and good.  Thumbs up.

Great recipe! So simple and easy...I used frozen chicken tenders and ham I bought that was already diced. I didn't have any white wine, so I substituted milk.  The whole family loved it and we will definitely make this again and again.

I think I have found the missing ingredient that could be key to this recipe! I added a few squirts of dijon mustard to the sauce. I think this makes a huge difference in flavor, transforming it from the normal "cream of chicken soup" taste to WOW(the wine also plays a part in that)! I also made a few other changes suggested such as breading the chicken pieces in Italian bread crumbs before browning (and seasoning it), adding milk to thin the sauce out and make it go farther, and I also added 3 different cheeses to use up some extras I had in the fridge (Swiss, mozzarella, and fresh parmesan). It was an excellent recipe and very filling!

I used EVOO to brown the chicken in and added in a sliced onion and a little minced garlic. I also used the Healthy Choice soup. Quick and simple for a sick mom that's just keeping it together until bedtime. I served it on top of homemade biscuits with a side of steamed veg. I didn't have any but the family ate it without complaint. Quiet during dinner is always nice.

Overall this was good. I changed it a little bit because I had 4 chicken breasts that were already cooked- so I skipped the first chicken step. I made the sauce as shown, adding a tad of butter and 1 tsp. of minced garlic (we love garlic). Then I added the chicken shredded and simmered for about 10 minutes. Served over egg noodles... the husband loved it!

Very tasty and easy. Just needs more sauce if you're serving over noodles or rice. Not enough to coat plateful of egg noodles. Otherwise - simple, filling, and delicious.

Really Good!! I doubled the sauce, added seasonings (heavily) to the chicken while sauteing since there was no other seasoning.  I meant to add Old Bay Seasoning but forgot, but I'm sure it would only enhance the flavor!  Served over basmati rice and with green peas. So easy, and YUMMMY!!

Very easy. I made this times 7 for our family dinner co-op. It was so simple to cook noodles, top with the divided chicken, sauce and finally with a sprinkle of bread crumbs. We used chicken broth instead of wine as one of our group mom's is a new mom but is still had good flavor.

I made this last night and everyone enjoyed it, picky eaters and all.  I added some dijon mustard and basil to add to the flavor.  So quick to make on a busy weeknight.

The base of this recipe is pretty good.  I used two chicken breasts, and sauteed them with the butter, some white onion, and minced garlic.  I then used a chardonnay to deglaze and added a bit of water with the condensed soup (I used mushroom soup, because I didn't have any chicken soup).  I used parmesan instead of swiss cheese, and added some fresh ground pepper.  It was pretty good, but I would also add some fresh mushrooms next time.  This is a good recipe to experiment with!  p.s.  I didn't use any ham, because I didn't have any... it might be more flavorful with ham, but probably too salty.  If you use ham, I would use low sodium soup.

OMG! This was fantastic! I was looking for something different to cook for dinner and this just jumped out at me. All melty and gooey with the cheese and sauce. I actually used about 1/3 C of Pinot Grigiot for the wine and I had Black Forest Ham slices in the fridge, so I cut that into chunks. The cheese I used was Baby Lace Swiss and just sliced it really thin so it melted quickly. Served the whole over Rotellini and it was fabulous. I will definately make this again!

I added garlic powder, salt, and pepper while browning the chicken. Also, I added a little cream and more cheese. Need a little more flavoring, otherwise pretty good. Wonderful over noodles.

Oh Man! The Whole Family Loved This Recipe! But like Kyle said, it's very rich. Sliced breasts in half lengthwise, rolled big slices of swiss in deli ham slices and inserted; closed breasts, salted and peppered on ea side, floured both sides and fried in butter in cast-iron pan. Browned both sides and overcooked them. Doesn't need 30 minutes frying time. Put on warm platter in warm oven while I made the sauce. Served with Red potatoes in butter and parley. Next time will serve with salad or something very light.

I really liked this, but didn't love it.  It definitely needed some seasoning, pepper/garlic/salt/etc., and some color - maybe peas, asparagus, or possibly even multi color noodles would help?

This recipe was easy to make, but it was definitely lacking in the flavor department. If you're going to make this recipe get creative and add some complementary spices. A bit of pepper made it more tasty in our household, but I don't think I will be making this again any time soon.

I just tried this recipe for dinner.  It was awesome!! My 6 & 7 year old have already asked when will I make it again.  My husband liked it too and he's a very picky eater.  I wouldn't change one thing in this recipe.  It's perfect!

This was fantastic because it's easy AND good.  All I added was garlic powder, Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning and some extra wine & a little bit of milk because I wanted more sauce. I like Swiss cheese and made this recipe as-is, but you could also probably substitute Romano, Parmesan or Asiago cheese if you don't have or don't like Swiss.

Delicious! Having read the other reviews, I made several adaptations. I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and black pepper and added sauteed baby bella mushrooms. I used low fat/low sodium cream of chicken soup and doubled the ham and cheese.  In addition to the 1/4 c of white wine, I added 1/2 a soup can of milk.  Next time, I would also add green peas and perhaps, chopped green onions when I serve it.  We'll definitely be adding this quick and easy recipe to our repeteroire.

I doubled this in order to freeze some.  I put ~3/4c. white cooking wine, and then stirred 1/2c. milk into the soup before adding it to the meat.  Also used sage, bouillon, parsley flakes and 2c. brown rice. Adding the rice makes it feel really complete.

This is a make again.  My kids loved it and there were no left overs.  I did make one substitution and that was to use smoked cheese only because I had an abundance of it after a graduation party.  It gave the recipe a slight smoked flavor and was absolutely delicious.

Really easy and tasted great - made a few modifications. Used chicken broth instead of the wine and added minced garlic and black pepper. Family ate it up and want again in the future.

Very good.  I can't believe how simple it is, and how fast I can whip it up!  We serve it over egg noodles with a ceasar salad.

We love the Chicken Cordon Bleu II from this site, but I wasn't in the mood to pound, fill, roll and dredge the chicken.  I went looking for another recipe that used similar ingredients.  

This was a HUGE hit.  My husband said we should have this all the time instead of the other, plus this was much quicker and easier to assemble.  I doubled the recipe for our family of 9, and nearly followed the recipe exactly.  I did sprinkle salt, pepper and garlic powder over the chicken while browning.  We think the white wine is critical as it adds a great flavor.  We use cooking wine, which is pretty inexpensive in the grocery store.

Just before serving I did add a little milk to thin the sauce since we served it over mashed potatoes.  I don't think this is necessary, it just made it a bit more gravy like which was what I needed.  Next time I think we'll try it over rice, and probably not thinned out.

I was nervous the canned soup would give it an artificial taste, but was pleasantly surprised by the great texture and flavor of this recipe.

Easy to prepare and very good.  My entire family enjoyed it.  I should mention that I used chicken broth in place of the wine because I did not have any. The only other change that I made was to make the dish using a slow cooker since I had to pick kids up from practice when I would normally be cooking supper.  I cubed the uncooked chicken and combined it with the remaining ingredients (sans butter) in the crockpot and cooked it on high for 4 hours.  The chicken was very tender, and we had plenty of sauce for our noodles.  I will make this again!

It was ok. I followed the recipe as is, then tasted it and added pepper and garlic powder. It still needed something after that. Maybe to be thinned out. I used low fat/sodium soup, but it was still really salty.

This recipe was ok.  I tasted the sauce before mixing everything together and thought it was kind of bland.  I added some TS Garlic! Garlic! and thyme.  That really perked up the flavor.  I mixed everything together and threw it in a casserole dish and topped with extra Swiss cheese and put it under the broiler to melt the cheese.  I wished I had doubled the sauce as others suggested.  We did enjoy it and will make it again, but with these same improvements.

Excellent, quick recipe. I also use sliced swiss cheese and white wine vinegar if I don't have white wine. As a ham "cubed" alternative, I use shaved ham. Great flavor!!

This is one of my favorite recipes, it is so good and easy to make.  I usually add cooked fettuccini noodles to it, and every now and then I will bread the chicken. Thanks for a great recipe! :)

This was so easy to throw together after soccer practice tonight!!!  Even my picky two year old loved it.  Judging from the way my bunch gobbled it down, it will be a repeater in our house.  Tip:  Use white grape juice if you don't have any wine on hand.

This was quite good.  I don't usually have wine on hand so I substituted cream of chicken soup, to make it creamier I used the low fat but it was still very good.

Like other reviewers I added more wine and a considerable amount of dijon mustard to add flavor. I normally make a slow cooker cordon bleu, but was looking for something where I didn't have to fry the chicken, as we're trying to eat without all the fat. Did use only about 3/4 of the can of soup because of the sodium. My fiancee LOVED it! And that tells you something!!! Will make again!

Good use of leftovers.  (Canned chicken and mushroom soup work for substitutes.) Layer over hot cooked noodles, and Top with corn flakes.  Bake @ 350 for about 15 minutes to toast the corn flakes.  Yummy!

This was what I was looking for. I wanted Chicken Cordon Bleu but hate pounding chicken! My only major change is that after mixing everything together I put panko bread crumbs on top and put in in the oven to brown.

A pretty good recipe, overall. I added some milk and a little extra wine to dilute the sauce and cut back on the saltiness described by other raters. Not a bad recipe.

A great standby for a weekday dinner. I added parsley, fresh garlic, onion, & red & blk pepper. Without adding your own seasonings it would definitely be bland. I didn't have the wine so substituted with milk. I added about 1.5 cups of milk throughout the process as this dish does not have much sauce to it when made as written.

Yum! I did double the amount of ham and cheese due to taste preference. I also added 1/2 cup milk to the sauce after reading the reviews- we like sauce! Served over some white rice. Kids liked it and so did picky hubby. Thanks!

I love cordon bleu and this was no cordon bleu.  It was edible but certainly wasn't something I'll be rushing to make again.  It was quick to make which was definitely a plus.  The flavor was passable, ie. not too strong which is good for my finicky brood.  Unfortunately, it was too much like a poor imitation of the original.

My family loved this!! Said definitely a keeper. I used 2 cans of soup and a 1/3 cup of milk since it was so thick. And added an extra handful of cheese. It was excellent. Had some steamed broccoli with it and it was a perfect side to complete the meal. Husband suggested pouring it over biscuits next time instead of the egg noodles. Going to try that.

Chicken Cordon Bleu is a favorite at our house but it is alot of work...I followed others advice and used milk instead of wine and I served it over noodles the whole family loved it the next time I think I will make it into a casserole by mixing it with the noodles and topping it with crushed ritz crackers and baking in the oven.

This was fabulous although I tweaked it some - I dredged the chicken in Italian bread crumbs before cooking and browned in 1/2 c. butter (draining off when chicken was browned.)  I added 1/2 c. white wine, and 2-3 tbs. of heavy cream which added richness to the sauce. I also added a can of sliced mushrooms.  I put the chicken in a casserole dish, poured the sauce over it and instead of adding the Swiss cheese to the sauce I sprinkled it on top and finished in a 325 oven for about 15 minutes.  My daughter and her friend raved about how good it was. It's definitely a keeper for me!

I hate to do this to ya, but I did not care for this at all.  I think it is cooking the chicken in the skillet pan. I have tried a couple of recipes that do this and gives the chicken an odd taste and texture. Also, it was a bit bland and did not smell very good either. I would reccommend trying to make it in the oven instead of the skillet.

I didn't change much, just added a little extra white wine and a little extra shredded swiss.  Very good.  Will be making again!

This was pretty good.  We thought it tasted like the real thing. It was however a little too cheesy for our tastes. Quick and Easy. I'd make it again.

This recipie was really good. I disagree with it lacking in flavor or not having enough sauce. In fact I had quite the opposite result. I used milk instead of wine, since we are a young family at the moment, and I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken. It was really good when served over the potato rounds recipe.

Really yummy!  I was looking for a quick meal i could throw on with what i had on hand.  then i realized i was out of cream of chicken.  
so i made my own!  just used butter, flour & chicken stock.  Added some garlic powder, onion powder, salt, Pepper, celery flakes & a pinch of dry mustard to my "soup".  of course the recipe wasn't as quick, but it only took a few minutes to whip that up and WOW.  the sauce was awesome.  the wine made the difference, and maybe i didn't have the problem with it being bland because of all the seasonings i added to my "soup"!!  will definately make again!

To make this recipe more flavorful I used Marsala cooking wine instead of white wine. Perfect!

At first this was bland, so I added some garlic powder and some black pepper. That made a huge difference. I cut my chicken in cubes and served it over rice.

This was a wonderfully easy dish to prepare! Like some of the other reviewers, I used the low sodium soup and it turned out great! To make it a bit more saucy, I added about double the wine called for...yum!  This reminded me a bit of the fondue that my mom used to make with white wine and swiss cheese!  I served this over the egg noodles, but I think rice would work out well, or serve it in a hollowed out round of sourdough...stew style!  Great recipe....definitely a new staple to our house!

This recipe was delicious! Quick and easy. All the flavor of the "real thing" without the hassle. My husband loved it and had seconds (he was even talking about it the next day). I used chicken broth instead of white wine and more of it. I also added more swiss. Served over noodles with peas on the side and a nice crusty bread to soak up the broth. A new favorite!

Used leftover ham - a little over a cup. Sauteed chicken pieces in garlic and herbs. Deglazed with wine and made sauce with herbs, leftover cheeses (muenster, swiss, mozz, parm) cream of mushroom soup and a splash of heavy cream. Delicious! Made elbow mac, drained and mixed right into skillet with meat and sauce.

Added mushrooms and spicy brown mustard just like some of the other reviewers suggested. Also used heavy cream instead of wine.  This is a fun and easy recipe. My fiance enjoyed his with noodles and I loved mine just eaten with a spoon. Great flavor. Thanks!

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe and it was very simple to make. The only change I made was to transfer everything to a casserole dish after it was done, topped it with buttered seasoned breadcrumbs and browned it under the broiler. I think this added a little extra flavor and texture.

I made this last night and my boyfriend and two of our friends raved over it.  It was so easy and really good.  I took another reviewers advice & coated the chicken pieces in Italian bread crumbs before browning the chicken.  Also added a little dried thyme & half and half to the sauce.  Served it over Jasmine rice.  Delicious!

My husband absolutely loved this recipe. It was very good but I definitely agree with other reviews, it needs a few extra spices and is to salty with the regular soup.  Will be making this again though for sure.  Thanks!

This was very easy to prepare and my family was impressed!  The amount of chicken is too much for my family of 3 so I browned 1/2 a chicken breast with fresh minced garlic and coarsely ground pepper. I added 1/2 a can of milk to make the sauce a little thinner and added a dash of tobasco sauce to give it a bit of zip. It took less than 1/2 hour to prepare Yum! I'll make this again!

Great recipe. I normally buy the frozen chicken cordon bleu but when I saw this I figured I would give it a shot. I changed my servings to 6 so I needed 1 1/2 cans of cream of chicken soup. I only had one so I added 1/2 can of cream of mushroom. Also, when I was cooking the chicken I added garlic. This was a great recipe. My entire family LOVED it!

Overall the recipe was really good but I'd use reduced fat soup next time and maybe a combo of Swiss and another cheese because this was really salty.  I'll definitely make again

This turned out really well!  I cooked one package of egg noodles to serve it over and doubled the recipe- it was the perfect amount for one package of noodles.  To double, I used one can of cream of chicken and one cup of chicken broth.  It's a fairly salty dish, so don't add any salt and I recommend using low sodium soup.

Delicious!  I wanted mine a little more "saucy" so I added about 1/4 c milk and another splash of wine until it looked like it would pour over noodles - a big hit with hubby and picky 12 year old.  Thanks so much for this one!

Again - my husband loved it!  It was super rich and creamy.  I didn't have any Swiss Cheese - so my husband went to the store...he comes back with REAL!!! Swiss Cheese from Switzerland ($8.99/lb. EEK!) - but have to admit it - it was awesome!  I am going to try this over rice next time.

My boyfriend has a real thing for chicken cordon bleu but it is usually real pain to make! This recipe is really fast and easy compared to traditional chicken cordon bleu.  My only complaint was it was really SALTY, I mean really really salty. I will make sure and get low sodium everything next time I make it!

This was delicious ! It was too thick just like I had read in other reviews, so I added milk a little at a time until it was the right consistently. 3 squeezes of dejon mustard and the sauce was out of this world.  I seasoned the chicken breast and cooked them with lemon infused olive oil. Instead of mixing them in I chose to lay them on top the noodles and sauce! It was a really pretty presentation.

Yum!  I did add a soup can of milk in order to thin out the sauce for pasta, and because of that I was glad I didn't buy the reduced sodium soup.  The wine is important for taste as well, and I really liked the swiss cheese flavor.  I took another reviewer's suggestion after tasting and added a squirt of dijon mustard as well as a lot of ground pepper for some extra flavor.  I like how easy this was to make and a great way to use up leftover ham.

Made recipe as instructed, added a little more chicken and Swiss cheese than recipe. Did not serve over noodles. Was very good, stick to your ribs meal and so easy to make.

Awesome and east recipe. Definitely use a whole cup of ham. 1/2 cup is just not enough. Could use salt and pepper to taste as well. But awesome and easy recipe

This was ok.  I didn't have any wine, so I used chicken broth instead.  When it was done, I thought it was pretty bland (my ham was not very salty), so I ended up putting a lot of onion powder, salt and pepper in it. It was also very dry and sticky in texture.  I ended up serving it as open face sandwiches with French bread.  There just wasn't enough liquid to serve it with rice or noodles.  Overall, it was edible, but didn't make me feel like I was eating chicken cordon bleu.
