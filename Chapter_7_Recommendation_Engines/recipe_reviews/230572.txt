Jenkin, you are right about the getting requested part!  Hubby will request this one again for sure!  I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I'll do a couple of other things.  First, I'll try very hard to get my chicken pounded out a little more---I have such a hard time with that without getting holes in it---but maybe I just need to pound it out and then roll it with a rolling pin after it gets looser.  Second, I would use Papa's Seasoning Salt on the chicken before putting on the filling.  It needed just a little more seasoning I thought.  I wrapped one piece of bacon lengthwise because I was afraid of the filling coming out, and so I needed one more piece of bacon to wrap crosswise (in my opinion).  Hubby thinks I'm too picky, but that's just what I'll do the next time I make it.  Oh, one more important thing.  I didn't think one hour at 400 was going to work for me, so I did the first half hour at 350 and then moved it up.  That was perfect!  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

I started drooling just reading this recipe!  The only thing I modified was to add some fresh chopped garlic to the cream cheese and green onion mixture.  I also wrapped a piece of bacon lengthwise just in case any of that delicious cheese mixture wanted to try and escape.  It worked and the chicken was wondeful. I plan on testing out how to make this with the chicken cut in smaller pieces so it can be served as an appetizer.  I'm thinking I'll fold the chicken instead of rolling it.  Yum-yum!  Thank you sharing this recipe.

Great recipe the wife and kids loved it.  I did change it slightly I used boneless Thighs instead of breasts.  I also used cream cheese with chives and onions already in it.  Will definetly make this again.

This was a good dish, I used raw chicken tenders instead of the boneless skinless breast and still by the time the chicken was done the bacon was very crispy. I also used a Ranch dip powder mix instead of the seasonings in the cream cheese. The family loved it.

This was delicious! I put the cream cheese mixture on both sides of the chicken and added some fresh diced jalapeno and it was sooo good! Mine were done 45 minutes at 400 degrees. I would also recommend turning the chicken halfway through so both sides of the bacon get cooked. I will definitely make this again.

This was so good and so easy! I changed a few things after reading the other reviews. I used cream cheese that already had chive and onion in it, I seasoned the chicken itself with season salt and black pepper, and I cooked at 350 degrees for 30 min and then 400 degrees for another 30 min. I also used toothpicks to make sure the bacon stayed on tight. It turned out PERFECT! SO GOOD. served with asparagus and baked potato :)

Delicious! I added thinly sliced garlic and smoked shallots to my cream cheese mixture, a tiny drizzle of blue agave syrup on the bacon, and topped it with a garnish of fresh basil from the garden. Boom. And at about 10 minutes prep time? Easy as lyin'!

I tried this recipe exactly as  is and it is good. Next time I will add some garlic and chili pepper to give the recipe some zing.I will also use 1/2 to 3/4 of the cream cheese, which seemed to overpower all the other flavours in some bites.

This was delicious. I changed to chicken breast tenderloins, since I didn't know what a half chicken breast was, and I used two bacon strips wrapped perpendicularly on the chicken. Some of my filling ran out during baking, defiantly will increase the bacon slices to 3 or 4 next time. Still a big hit. Filling was tasty, but you can substitute sour cream and onion dip  for this homemade filling.

Used Mrs Dash Lemon Pepper seasoning on my chicken instead of the salt and pepper.  Will have to pull it out about 5 minutes earlier next time as the chicken got slightly dried out but still tasted really good.

I didn't have a rack so I used an 8X8 glass dish. About half-way thru cooking I drained a lil bit of the juice, you will need to keep some so the bottom doesn't burn. I also covered the dish for the first half of baking and baked uncovered the rest of the way. Our stove is messed up so we have to use a toaster oven. The chicken came out looking just like the pics and was a HUGE hit with my family!  A new and tasty dish to break the cycle of the usual dinner dishes. :-)

I also added seasoning salt to chicken. The bacon I used was thick cut smoked bacon. I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs. I did the first 30 min at 350 then the last 30 at 400. Just a little to long but still awesome and will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly and the dish turned out to be dry and tasteless, surprisingly so given how much bacon is in it. It smelled good while cooking and looked picture perfect out of the oven, so it was super disappointing to eat. Won't make this again.

First time I made this I followed it to the letter and it was amazing. Next time I had a partially used jalapeño cream cheese tub in the fridge. THAT was great. Next time I grew tired of pounding the breast and just sliced in to the middle lengthwise and stuffed it with green onions and fresh jalapeño slices. Wrapped in THICK cut bacon. It is awesome. Jalapeños make it that much better. Tonight I took the seeds out of two jalapeños and sliced them thin but left the length then put them in the slit in the breast before the cream cheese.

Really Good - I have a short cut for this. If you don't want to mix the onions, cheese, etc. I substituted Boursin Cheese with Herbs for the filling. It's quick and easy. Just spread a generous amount inside and follow the rest of the recipe.

My dental hygienist gave me this recipe several years ago. It is so simple, but looks and tastes like a gourmet meal. I get rave reviews every time I make it. Once I made 30 breasts for a candlelight dinner at a marriage weekend at our church along with mashed potatoes and green beans and everyone thought I'd slaved all day! I highly recommend this recipe.

I did the preparation the night before, covered and left in fridge. I hammered down the chicken breasts, with a rolling pin, to make them a bit more flat. Easier to spread cream cheese mixture. I added some chopped red pepper to the mixture, for colour. Rolled each piece up like a jelly roll. Turned out perfect. A real special treat for our Thanksgiving dinner. A lovely change from turkey. Smash hit. Served with roasted yellow baby potatoes, steamed broccoli & cauliflower w/ cheese sauce. 5 stars without question.

Delicious! I did flip mine over near the end and turned it to broil so the bacon was crispy all the way around the chicken. We will make this one again.

Followed the recipe and I was disappointed. Most of the filling baked out and I turned the chicken half way through cooking. Some of the bacon was still soft and soggy. Don’t think I will waste my time and effort to make again.

I love this! I used 3 breasts pounded thin then cut in half, one package of bacon (partially fried), 8 oz cream cheese mixed with mozzarella. I sautéed some onion and minced garlic in the bacon  grease and added to cheese mix. Sprinkled  Italian seasoning and pepper on the breasts. Cooked in casserole dish ( no rack)....covered with foil on 380 for about an hour....uncovered and topped with cheese the last 10 minutes or so. Thanks for sharing. May add ham next time.

I used spinach with cream cheese instead of the the spring onions.  Also I think the chicken gets a little dry and over done in an hour. Need to reduce the time in the oven.....will try 40 minutes next time I make this.

This was a really simple but really tasty dish.  Everyone loved it.  I didn't have any green onions, so I just doctored the cream cheese with parsley and spices.  Next time, I think I'll use cream cheese and chives.  So excited to find something the whole family loved.  Thanks!

Hubby and DS loved this. I used turkey bacon. Added mozzerella to the cream cheese. Sprinkled cheddar on top of the bacon.  Next time will make it as s cordon bleu.

I made this cause if the fact that we've had simple diners for over a week. My dad and his girlfriend loved it. I can't say if I will be repeated any time soon but I will make it again some time.

It was sooooooo DRYY in my case! An hour just seemed way to long cook time and I knew it! All the cream cheese oozed out of the ends and just crusted onto my pan and there was none left inside. Never again for me.

I have made this about a million times and is ALWAYS fantastic.  Only difference is instead of green onions, I liberally sprinkle the chicken breast with Italian Seasoning before rolling with cream cheese.  Top 10 recipes requested in my household.

Amazing. I made it for my husband last week and he has already asked for it again.  He said he felt like he was eating at a restaurant.  I also added chopped garlic to the filling.

This recipe was fantastic, easy, and delicious! Will definitely make again. It helps to wrap a strip of bacon longways to keep the filling in.

I really like the taste of this dish.  My problem was a lot of the cheese filling came out......... :(  When (not if) I do this again, I would make sure to use lots of toothpicks to hold it together, or maybe even sew it shut.

The best for sure. I added potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and onions and spread a little cream cheese spread over the veggies. I would recommend using good quality bacon so it's not so greasy.
