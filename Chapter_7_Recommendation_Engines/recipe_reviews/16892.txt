The heavy cream gives it a nice flavor but I found the dumplings to be bland and the broth thinner than what I am accustomed to.  I will use to broth recipe again but will thicken it with instant mashed potatoes and make my usual drop dumplings with poultry seasoning. My family liked it.

This is the best chicken stew recipie I have ever eaten.  I adapted the recipie slightly by using 10 oz. egg noodles in place of the dumplings (which I didn't care for), and increasing the broth, and it was a hit.  Every bit worth the effort it takes to make it.

Good, but I just can't understand why anyone would discard all those veggies. I kept them in. Also added some herbs to the dumplings at other's suggestions. They were the best part of the dish I think. The chicken and gravy and veggies were good of course, just nothing special.

OH MY!!! This recipe was incredible. I had very hard to please chicken n dumpling experts and boy, did I impress my mother in law with this creamy and delicious recipe. I recommend homemade mashed potatoes with heavy cream as a side. YUM!

This is a hit at my house.  I make it dairy free by using coconut milk to make the dumplings and added some ginger and cumin to the stew.  Thickened it once with leftover sweet potato and added curry.  Delicious!

Good recipe. I only used chicken breast and made this in the slow cooker. It turned out tasty and the dumplings were good.

minus the carrots, which I think are better left out... this is the exact recipe I made over a year ago for the first time and I still get requests on at least a monthly basis to make it again.  It's become a staple, thank you :)

my younger kids loved this. i took some of the other reviewers' advice and added egg noodles along with only half the amount of dumplings. I was afraid they would be bland so i added a pinch of dried herbs into the batter. It was a hit and I'm making it again a week later!

Would make a great "cream of chicken" soup without the dumplings, which are a bit heavy.  Very tasty.
