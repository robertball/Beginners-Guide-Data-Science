Mine came out a little thin, so I thickened it with more peanut butter and some soy flour to get a dough-like consistency. (Great way to up the protein content even more!) I also upped the spices to compensate. It came out very good! (I used crunchy peanut butter because I like the texture). Note that this recipe makes approximately 40 individual balls, with four or five filling up one pita.

This recipe was very good.  The recipe should be more specific regarding the use of creamy peanut butter.  If you use a chunky peanut butter you get too much of a peanut concentration in your falafel.

I guess I should have read the reviews before making this.  On the positive side, this recipe was extremely easy and quick to make, it smelled and tasted wonderful and I will definitely make it again.  As others have mentioned, however, the mixture was not solid enough to form into balls so I had to take away a star for that.

This recipe is a great start for falafel.  I added additional spices of celery salt, much more garam marsala, (as I had no coriander on hand and it contains coriander AND cumin.)  Lots of black pepper, and some gluten free bread crumbs finished this off nicely.  I also let is sit in the fridge for awhile before frying, it helps firm it up.

great flavor, but I added 4 cups of bread crumbs to be able to make into patties and fry.

As with all recipes, there is always critcism....this recipe lacks flavor and body.  It was a good start, but required an awful lot of tweaking to get both a good flavor and consistency.  I added a bit more coriander and some curry powder (as the pantry was lacking garam masala), and some bread crumbs.

After reading the top few reviews, I made some adjustments (of course). The crumbliness of the falafel is easily solved by adding an extra egg. Simple and effective.  I did the following for spices: 1/4 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp cayenne, 1/4 tsp garam masala, and 3 heaping tsp's of bread crumbs. I actually forgot the onion altogether but it wasn't a big deal. I cooked the falafel and put it smashed in a wrap with romaine lettuce, diced roma tomatoes, plenty of yellow onion, and 1000 island dressing. Would make it this way again, for sure.  I only rated 3 stars because, well, I made so many changes, I didn't really eat the product of the original recipe.

The flavour of these falafel was different than any falafel I've had, but very, very good. I love the spiciness of them! Based on other people's comments of being too runny, I tried mashing the chickpeas like other recipes suggest, hoping they would be thicker and stick together better.  I still had no luck :o( A few of them kind of stayed together, and the rest just ended up as tiny scattered fried pieces.  They still worked in a pita, but were not balls by any means!!! The difficulty in preparation is the only reason I gave this recipe 3 stars; otherwise, it was very good. ( I did leave out the cilantro!)

Way too thin.  Could not have made a ball out of it if I wanted.  Excellent flavor.  Just poured it into the pan, and fried it. Looking for something more like a Burger.  Any ideas????

This was not like falafel at all. More like chickpea pancake. I added extra beans, more spices, and 1/2 c flour and finally got the dough to come together. i think the omission of peanut butter in the future might help, but I REALLY wish people would rate a recipe low if it doesn't work when one follows the instructions.

Didn't care for the texture or the peanut butter or soy sauce addition.  They don't belong here.  The person asking about the "burger" type of mediterranean food is probably looking to make Kefta - which uses ground beef, parsley, onion, cumin , salt and pepper formed into small oval patties, cooked and placed in the pita with tomatoes, cucumber and tahini dressing/sauce.  Falafel is made with chickpeas.

Wonderful texture but lacks flavor. I add lemon juice & bread crumbs. I also threw little of cumin then it tasted like 5 stars.

The flavor of these were not great - I think it was the peanut butter.  Whatever it was, it seemed like all the flavors were at war in my mouth. I will not make these again.

It was nasty, tasted nothing like falafel and soy sauce and peanut butter dont belong in there. I threw it out. Also this is an arabic middle eastern dish, not jewish.

I have other falafel recipes I like, but I thought I would try this one as I was wanting to make falafel without breadcrumbs to decrease the carbs.  I did not alter the recipe, and mine seemed to stick together fine.  I always bake falafel instead of frying it, so maybe they would have fallen apart during the frying process.  They did fine in the oven--I think I had them in at 400 degrees for 15 or so minutes.  I wasn't big on the taste, though.  The peanut butter was too strong.  Though I normally put a tahini sauce on falafel, I did not like the tahini-ish taste being IN the falafel.  It just seemed weird.  Maybe I would have liked them in a pita, but I crumbled the falafel into a salad and just wasn't real impressed with the taste.

Ugh. Perhaps it is my cooking skills, but I had a terrible time trying to keep the falafel balls together.  We had falfel mush.

I modified this recipe slightly, but I don't know why so many others had such a problem with the mixture staying together.  What helped me, was I placed in a food processor everything except the chickpeas and the egg.  The peanut butter mixture made a good paste.  I added 2 TBSP of oat flour, then the chickpeas and egg.  I pulsed the chickpeas until they were broken but not too pasty, like a lumpy oatmeal.  I then formed them into misshapen balls/patties and cooked as directed. They were superb!

This did taste a little different than most falafel I've had, but my husband and I liked it better. It was also more filling than other falafel, maybe because of the peanut butter? I omitted the cumin because he hates cumin.  I was afraid they wouldn't stay into balls because of the other reviews, so after I shaped them, I patted them with flour before frying, and they held their shape fine. I will definitely be making these again.

There's far too much water in the resulting batter.  Thickening it with peanut butter, flour and bread crumbs just gives us a peanut butter-flavored mush when it's cooked.

This is similar to an original Jewish recipe I have but you must add 1/2 cup breadcrumbs or barley to it or it will fall apart.

The flavor of this falafel is great! I didn't have any eggs so I decided to try this recipe. After I made the "dough" I tested one in the skillet and it started to fall apart before it was done. So, I stuck the rest of the balls in the freezer for 20 minutes and they fried up perfrectly. Thanks for this recipe.

I, like other reviewers, tried other things to get these things to stick together enough to form into "balls."  I tried adding quick oats to some - don't recommend that.   I didn't find adding extra peanut butter made the "dough" more managable.  Ultimately I doubled the garbonzo beans: that seemed to work best.  I upped the spices to compensate.  These taste delicious w/ tzatziki (cucumber) sauce.  I might try a less messy falafel recipe next time though.
