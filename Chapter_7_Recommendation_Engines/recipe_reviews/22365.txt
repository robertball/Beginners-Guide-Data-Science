My fifth and sixth grade students made this recipe as a fun activity.  They absolutely loved, as did all the teachers that drifted by my room for a taste.  Definitely the best fudge I've ever tried, and super easy to make!

This fudge was too soft, even after being in the fridge overnight to firm.

Thought this was an excellent recipe.
Very easy.  I cooked it in my teflon
electric skillet which made it easy to
control the heat.  Ready in no time,
and everyone thought it was delicious.

Great Fudge! My fourth grader made it last night for the Holiday Feast at school. The class ate it up! He embellished by putting Holiday Marshmallows on top of each piece when the fudge was still warm. Looked very festive. This will become our holiday fudge recipe!

This was my first attempt at making fudge in a very long time, and I was very pleased with the results.  This recipe is easy to make and turned out great (my husband loved it!).  For me, however, it was too sweet and I could taste the marshmallow creme above everything else.  Good recipe, and I will probably make it again.

My boyfriend made this fudge.  It was his first attemp at something like this -- ever.  It came out perfectly.  Everyone loved it.  He'll be making this again.
