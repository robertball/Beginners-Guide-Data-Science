This is just spectacular. I had real problems with batter (soggy, tasteless, too thin etc), but this was so crisp and light! I too, cut the baking powder down to 2 tbspns, but I used self-raising flour (all I had on hand) and it worked perfectly. I had no problem with it sticking to the thing I was battering (fresh pecorino cheese cubes - it was too wonderful to contemplate!). For such a simple recipe, you'll get fabulous results - guaranteed!

This recipe was awesome! The fish turned out so great. I used 3/4 c of milk and 3/4 c of water because the batter was too thick at first. I added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the mixture as well. I fried the fish in 1/2 an inch of vegetable oil. Everyone raved about it!

We used a total of 2 T baking powder which worked very well – w/o the bitter aftertaste previous reviewers have written about.  We also added ¼ tsp. Old Bay & an equal amount of LA Gold (hot sauce).  5 +++ stars from us.  We’ll be making this recipe again!!!

From Chef Pare.
On the face of it ,nice batter.  I do agree with other reviews, too much baking powder.  I recommend, cut the baking powder to 1 TLBS.  In place of the reduced baking powder add this.  I TSP of lemon juice (fresh is best) & 1 TSP of honey.  (honey)  not sugar. honey will sustain higher heat than sugar without burning.  If you decide the batter is too thick, cut it with water.  Milk will make it tougher/chewier.  I am out of the business now, but happy to help out others.   kpare55@telus.net

This turned out pretty good. I did only 2T of the baking soda as the other review suggested. I also dredged the fish in flour first to help the batter stick. Either fry it up in a non stick pan or make sure your grease is deep enough to float the fish in to prevent sticking to the pan.

This is great.  I used self rising flour (that I seasoned really well) instead and decreased the baking powder.  And like some of the other reviews, I also increased the liquid because the batter is really thick.

This is a perfect batter.  It's thick, and coats the fish nicely and yet, doesn't come out overly oily.  I do spice the flour with garlic powder, italian seasoning, salt, pepper and vegetable seasoning.  I followed suggestions and lowered the baking powder to 2 tbsp.  It's a good batter for pretty much anything going in the fryer.  Cheese, onion rings etc.  (Try the cheese, it's phenomenal!)

Nice thick batter. PLEASE NOTE that Baking Powder and Baking Soda are NOT the same thing. Incorrectly using Baking Soda (also known as Bi-carb Soda or Sodium bi-carbonate) in this recipe will give the "tangy" or bitter taste other reviewers have mentioned. Baking Soda is not a "one for one" substitute for Baking Powder - which usually contains about 25% baking soda (alkali) + 50% cream of tartar (acid) and a buffer ingredient. The acid/alkali combination aerates the mixture when liquid is added. Hope this helps

This recipe was good but did have a little bit of a bitter taste. Next time, I may cut way back on the baking powder. I was kinda messy to cook.

This was just terrific.  I always struggle with frying fish in the typical bread crumb coating, and this solved the dilemma forever!  I too reduced the baking powder to 2T, but did not change anything else.  The coating is a little messy to apply, but wasn't a problem.  It can be thicker or thinner to your taste.  Absolutely delcious!  It reminded my family of the old Arthur Treacher's fried fish (or Long John Silver's).  Thank you!!!

This recipe has the incorrect amount of baking powder.  It should be 1/4 tsp. not cup.  Not sure how to get a hold of the person who posted this recipe to have her change it.

This is a decent recipe.  The batter was nice and crispy, but the taste left something to be desired.  I added pepper and Old Bay Seasoning and took the advise of others to cut the baking powder to 2 Tbs.  It still needed something.  Maybe more salt?  Maybe garlic?  I've never made my own fish fry before so have nothing to compare it to except the frozen fish fillets from the store and these are much better than those things, of course!

I wish I had read reviews first, the 1/4 cup baking powder did sound a little off, I've never used that much baking powder in anything I've cooked before. It tasted horrible and I had to throw it out. Wasted 2 lbs of fish. Someone should revise this.

This is a good basic recipe. Nice crispiness! I used 3/4 cup of flour instead of half a cup, and only 2T of baking powder. I also added 1T onion powder, garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon of white pepper, and 1T crab seafood seasoning. Dredged in flour then dipped in batter. This was a perfect batter. I also used it to deep fry red and yellow bell peppers.

We made this tonight and unfortunately, it wasn't very good. Followed the recipe, except we cut the baking powder in half. The result was a light batter that did not have much flavor at all. 

If we were to make it again, we would adjust it to have even less baking powder and maybe some kind of seasoning in it.

I have tried this recipe several times and it was ok. Then I really read the reviews. I saw that you had to reduce the baking powder but I didn't read on how much. I reduced the baking powder to 2 Tbsp as suggested this time and it was terrific. My husband even asked this morning how I did it! Too bad 'All Recipes' doesn't edit it.

I thought this recipe was great!!  I have never made my own batter before, this was so easy.  I did reduce baking powder to 2 tbsp, added paprika, onion powder & black pepper.  I had approx 2 lbs of catfish and exactly enough batter for the batch.  Melts in your mouth, thanks for all the tips from the reviews (and the recipe poster as well).  I'm going to try shrimp with this next, and maybe some onion rings!!

First, something's wrong with the proportions: There's no way the batter can be the right consistency based on the 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup milk. Second: The taste was bitter and overpowering of flour. I think the amount of flour should be reduced. Third: The batter turned a beautiful golden brown. But the appearance was misleading. Worst batter recipe I've found so far.

So light and crispy.  The batter was a little thick so I thinned it with a bit of water.  I added just a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.  I patted dry the fish fillets and then dredged them with a seasoned flour mixture.  The batter didn't separate from the fish.  Will use this again. EXCELLENT!!

I have never had a fish batter as good as this one. I made it last night and my husband loved it. It was so simple to prepare and the fish was wonderful. I did however add 1tsp each of onion and garlic powder and a 1/4 tsp of chili powder.

People, this is a basic recipe for crispy batter when deep fried.  It's very versatile, can be made into Beer Batter, Curry Batter, fried cakes (add sugar or honey), all you need is an imagination and some seasoning.  I USED 2 TABLESPOONS OF BAKING POWDER RATHER THE 1/4 CUP AS THE RECIPE CALLS FOR.

Best batter ever!!! Made it as the recipe called for first. Awesome. Made it without as much baking powder, Awesome. Made it without any salt, Awesome. No matter what I did it always came out great! Cooked in oil at 375-400 for 4-5 minuets. Great for veggies too! Next time I'm going to use less water for a thicker batter. Can't wait I know it will be.... Awesome!!!

I don't see where all these good reviews are coming from...okay it tastes good HOWEVER when I went to lift the basket from my fryer all the breading had dissconnected from the fish.  I am so disapointed  :(  I too used the 2 T. baking powder as recommened by other reviews.

Makes the best, lightest and nicest batter for fish.  My husband even goes to the store to buy fish just so I'll make fish and chips for him using this batter!   I've used this recipe several times now - never fails - although half the recipe is usually plenty.

Hey everyone, it should be 1/4 TEASPOON baking powder, NOT 1/4 cup!!!!!! Otherwise, great, simple light batter for fish. Add other stuff for flavoring if you like. Sprinkle with lemon or lime juice just before serving. I'd give it 5* but for the typo. From the other reviews, it seems some people actually used 1/4 cup baking powder...

Oh my gosh soooo crunchy but still melts in your mouth! I added my own blend of herbs in the batter to make it taste ... Try adding dry parsley , sage, fine herbs, garlic powder, thyme, celery salt , and salt and pepper. Every  one loved it!

Made this tonight.  Really liked it.  Because of other reviews I reduced amount of baking powder I used to just over half called for.  The batter is easy, uses few ingredients, and cooks up fluffy and crisp.  I'd recommend to anyone wanting a quick easy batter recipe.

I followed others directions and cut the baking powder to 2 T..no bitter taste. Coats nicely. I used the leftovers for thick onion rings. Yummy!

BTW I am gluten free so I used my homemade GF flour and it was fine.

Wow! It can't be this easy! I also read the previous reviews and cut back to 2 Tbsp of baking powder, I used B/C Better for Bread flour and I left out the salt but added 1 tbsp of Everglades Seasoning and 1 tsp of McCormicks Italian Herb mix...on my taste buds, it's a keeper!

Wonderful recipe. I allowed the kids to handle this one. I did notice that there was some sticking as we cooked more and more in the same pan. The family loved it and thats what really counts for me! Thanks!

First time I made fried fish - this batter is excellent. I went with the other reviews and only used 2T of baking powder, which eliminated the after taste. 

Make sure to seasoning the batter to your menu or taste. I used garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Next time I think I'll add some beer in place of the water. Did also need to add more water, as the batter was too thick with the amounts they recommend. Overall it was light and perfect! Will make this again. My Southern husband is pretty impressed with his Yankee wife's fish frying abilities now!

Just tried it, was very good. After reading about the amount of baking power and the bitterness it causes in the recipe I only put 1 tblsp in and also added some garlic power and a pinch of italian herb seasoning. Turned out great, light and crispy! will use it again, ty for the recipe :D

I read and followed the recipe AND the tips and this fish came out AMAZING....the fish was supposed to be for fish tacos, but it was so good that I just ate the fish alone (with tartar sauce).  Definately my new go to recipe for fish!!  Crispy, Light, Quick and Easy.....Pretty and most importantly YUMMY!!!

Converted this to gluten free and I must say it turned out fabulous or in the words of my 7yo daughter "phenomenal, I could eat this all the time". I took the advise of others on increasing liquids and I added some spices, changes are as follows: 
1 c. gluten free flour,
3/4c. milk and water,
1 TBSP gluten free baking powder,
1 tsp. salt,
1 tsp. garlic powder,
1/2 tsp. pepper,
1/2 tsp. paprika, 
*used organic coconut oil to fry in. 

It's not often that typical recipes convert well to gluten free but this one is a winner, we are going to try this as a coating for chicken nuggets as well.

They made a mistake it is suppose to be 1Tbl spoon of baking powder. Also i added 4 table spoons of corn starch. Makes it extra crispy and tender inside. Along with onion ,garlic powder 1tbls of each and i used black pepper,salt 1Tspn. Patted the fish dry .rolled in some flour and dipped it in the batter. Shook off and extra and fried 5min on each side. Then put on wire rack not paper towels. They hold the grease in. Also use wesson oil. I find it works the best. Good eating everyone.

I tried within 10 minutes of reading it.  The recipe is simple, quick, inexpensive, tasty, is not too oily, and does not leave dirty used oil behind. Individual can always tweak it further.  Thanks for "old is gold" recipe.

Awesome!! I scaled back the baking powder to 2 T. I also sprinkled some dill in the batter. The consistency of the batter is similar to pancake batter. It coats the fish perfectly. It turned out light and crisp.

LOVE,,,,,LOVE......LOVED THE RESULTS!!!!..used self rising flour which had baking powder and salt and added an additional  (2) tsp baking powder for additional lift in the batter.....season the flour with spices of your choice....if using self rising flour OMIT THE SALT or add 1/2 tsp salt or less if you like it slightly salty...the batter fries and puffs up to a crispy texture that remains so over 1 hour plus after frying....deep fried in olive oil, make sure you have enough oil in pan, turn frequently until both sides golden brown ....YUMMY!....CRISPY!!!!!

If you decrease the baking powder this is a winning recipe. We make the first batch then tasted it and we felt it was a little bitter. Decreased the baking powder to about 1/16 and it was perfect for me but my husband liked the crispness of the first batch. In the end we decided we would try 1/8 c next time.

Fantastic! I followed the recipe as-is except used half and half because I was out of milk. So crispy and light! Like a previous reviewer,I had a problem with the fish sticking to the bottom of the pan, which I blame on the oil not being deep enough. So I know better for next time, and there WILL be a next time!

I followed the recipe and all the recommendations for alleviating that "bitter" taste with no fortune. I'm giving it 2 stars because it was too bland and bitter, but had a great crisp texture.

A great base for a batter without egg.  I don't keep milk in the house but I did have dried milk, so I just added beer instead of water for liquid, did not add salt just Old Bay by taste.  I fried shrimp and tasted one before fully seasoning.  Took the advise of others and only added 1T of baking powder.  So crispy and delicous!!!!

perfect batter...I added lemon pepper to it and my husband said it's the best ever. We are fish eaters...former fishing guides from Alaska and have tried many different batters, but this one is easy and very tasty.

I will never buy a pre-made box of batter ever again! So easy, So inexpensive, So fabulous! I can't stand thick batter on anything, it takes away from the taste of the main ingredient.  This coating is light, crispy and absolutely delish.  I reduced the amount of the baking powder to 2 TBL and coated the fish with flour before dipping per previous reviews.  I added just a smidge more milk to thin the batter, then seasoned with 1 tsp each of Old Bay and garlic powder.  The recipe is so simple, I really didn't have much faith in it.  I was completely wrong.  It's a must try, you'll impress everyone.

Tasteless - soggy even on high heat - allows alot of oil to saturate the meat - leaves much to be desired.  Would not use again.

A very good and fluffy batter.  Best if used the first day.  Not super great from the fridge to the microwave on the second day.

This batter was great on cod and I had enough left over for fried zucchini. I upped the salt and thinned out the batter just a bit. As per other reviewers, I decreased the baking powder to two tablespoons. My family was thrilled with this batter. My son actually said it looked like fish served at a popular place in the Seattle/Tacoma area.  I think I would leave the batter thicker with the zucchini. I dried my fish pieces really well, so had no problem with the batter coating the fish. Thanks Marge for an easy and delicious batter for deep frying. I don't fry often but when I do, this will be my go to recipe.

I think the 1/4 cup baking powder was a typo. I used self rising, and omitted the powder. To the recipe, I added an egg, and creole seasoning. We used it for perch, and it was excellent.

This is the BEST batter if you do 2 things! Add garlic powder and some smoked paprika for flavor AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS LET THIS BATTER SIT FOR 1/2 AN HOUR!!! DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!! You will have the lightest, crispiest batter you have ever had. Use it for fish, cheese curds, onion rings or really anything you want to fry.

Excellent batter. I amended with 2 tbsp of baking powder, as recommended in previous reviews, and turned the milk to buttermilk. Crispy, light and wonderful. Best yet.

I made this with gluten free plain flour and my husband loved it.  I also cut the baking powder to 2T, but next time I will reduce it to 1T -- it was a bit puffy, but maybe due to the gluten free flour.  Increased the milk and water to 3/4 cup each (batter was still a bit too thick), and added 1/8 t Old Bay Seasoning as someone suggested.  Will increase to 1/4 t next time.  Fried in 1" of canola oil on the highest setting in my fondue pan.  Awesome.  Fish only took a few minutes to cook.  I deep fried while my husband ate it fresh out of the fondue.  He thought he died and went to Heaven!  Thanks for this simple recipe.

My family LOVED this recipe! I added about 1/4 more water because I like my batter a little drippy. I also added old bay seasoning and garlic powder. It was so crispy and delicious!

Nice thick batter that really sticks to the fish.  I knew this batter didn't need 1/4 cup of baking powder, heck, not even cake batter calls for that much.  I added two tsp. and it was very good.  However, next time, I will only use 1 tsp.  This will be my go to recipe until/unless I ever find something even better.  :)

When I first read the recipe, The baking powder amount scared me, but I tried it anyway, and it was wonderful. I did not detect the bitterness others have mentioned, maybe a tiny bit salty for me, but all in all, GREAT! I intend to use it again and again.

I followed other suggestions and dropped the baking powder down to 2 tbsp.  I made this gluten free by using a gluten free all purpose flour.  I made it dairy free by using a dairy free milk (specifically oat milk).  I added some spices and it turned out great.  Come see how we did it.  http://www.kitchentimewithdad.com/2014/11/12/gluten-free-fish-fry/

I honestly don't know how to fry fish! I followed the recipe exactly and fried in in a pan on the stove. It came out mushy and just broke apart in the pan. So I switched it up half way through, omitted the liquids and managed to save a few edible fried pieces. I know its how I am cooking them and not the recipe but i have no clue... happens everytime I batter fish and fry it, clearly not meant to be for me.

What I love about this batter is that it actually stays on the fish! It's crispy with a great flavor.  I've made it several times using snapper, rock fish, and sole; and I cook it in coconut oil.  My family loves it.

WOW! Good batter, I used it with shrimp and cut up tilapia as well. Tasted like the restaurant. Should be eaten quickly however or better will soften up, but that's with any fried fish. Great recipe, will keep in my cookbook.

I liked the taste of this recipe with the reduction in baking powder (2 tablespoons).  It was used to coat catfish nuggets because I ran out of cornmeal.  The recipe worked with the catfish but the consistency reminded me of glue and seemed to like my fingers more then the fish.

I tried this batter, it is a good basic crispy batter! I used 3 TBS. baking powder and had to double the water because its was too thick. Also added garlic powder, old bay to the dry ingredients before adding liquid. Also floured fish before dipping in batter. Yum!

Simple but good. Better to make it a little thicker and flour the fish or whatever you are using first.

I ruined $20 of fish with this recipe. The baking powder is overpowering and bitter. I should have followed my instincts when my gut told me 1/4 cup was bizarre.

I used gluten free flour and the recommended 2t of baking powder. This was one of the best recipes for fish ever! My son was so happy at the light and crispy batter he wanted more! I did also add a bit of pepper and 1tsp tony's to it..gave it a nice kick

I tried this recipe last night, keeping in mind others' reviews and didn't put in as much baking powder. I was so impressed at the outcome! Not overly greasy, very crispy. My family now wants everything fried in this batter! LOL

way too much baking powder didn't adhere that well to fish. Will try again with less baking powder.

Great recipe - How about dipping the battered fish into crushed salt and vinegar chips before cooking it. I saw this idea on TV, could work with other kinds of potato chips.

This is such a simple recipe and WOW what a great crispy coating on my fish. I did drop back to 2 tablespoons of Baking Powder. It was a thick batter but it fried up golden brown and crispy.

This recipe was fantastic and my family raved about it.  I battered 100 shrimp and had plenty left over. After reading several other reviews I decided to used 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup water.  I also used Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and old bay seasoning.  I will definitely save this recipe for future use.

Good fish batter.  I liked the thickness and consistency and didn't taste the baking powder taste myself.   I do think I could have added more salt and maybe some other seasoning to make it more flavorful...?  Who knows!   I liked how easy it was and that all the ingredients were already in my cupboard.

This is without a doubt everything it claims to be. But I too recommend cutting back on the baking powder or it will indeed be bitter. I happen to be a fan of cornmeal in my batter so I substituted some in place of some and it was very tasty.

Excellent batter!  Slight change with recommended 2 Tblsp. of baking powder and added a 1/2 tsp. of Old Bay.  To get that great crispiness, fry in shortening (400 degree electric skillet).  Then, put on a baking rack on top of a shallow baking sheet.  Put it in a 200 degree oven for 10-15 minutes and they set up beautifully.

It was soggy.  I added 1 cup of milk to the batter.  Drag the fish through the batter then drag it through corn meal that has salt and pepper in it.  Fry til it floats.

I'm so grateful I tasted it before dipping the remainder. This recipe is so bland, had to add milk & water to thin it out and then had to add Old Bay and hot sauce. Ended up frying the fish flour-dredged and am very glad I did.

This batter was very good. It was light and flaky and was not greasy at all. I did what the others suggested and only used 2 tbsp of baking soda and I added garlic powder and  it turned out fabulous. My family loved it. Next I'm going to try it with chicken.

I cannot tell you how good this was. The only problem that I encountered was the first piece was sticking to the pan. I tried to loosen it and lost some of the batter. The next piece I let cook a bit and it came off and looked like something from a fine seafood restaurant. I also dipped some mushrooms  and they came out unbelievably good as well. This was amazing- try it!!!

We thought this was WAAAAY too thick, even when adding 1/4 cup water, as suggested above.  For some reason it was not "thinly-coated and crispy", but thick-coated with more batter than fish and somewhat greasy (even with the fat hot enough).

My family and I loved the pan fried schrod that I breaded using this recipe!  I did use close to 2 tablespoons of baking powder, salt and a lot of pepper (to taste) and garlic salt. (to taste) It was awesome! I'll definitely be using this recipe again! Thanks to the submitter!

I made this batter for basa fillets, and served with hand cut fries, Tartar Sauce II from this site, mushy peas and cole slaw.  Delicious. Hubby wants this for EVERY birthday dinner. I added a little Old Bay but I don't think it really needed it.  The batter seemed really thick, so I added maybe a 1/4 c more water.  As for the baking soda, I may have cut it back a little, but I didn't taste it at all. Great recipe - a keeper for sure.

I thought this batter was fantastic. It really will take on whatever flavor you want to add to it. I added a bunch of old bay and used the fish for fish tacos. I don't deep fry very often, but if I need a batter, this is the one I will go to! Thanks for posting!

This is a great light batter. I dont like a lot of batter around my fish so I added another 1/4 cup milk and water and only used 1.5 TBSP baking soda. I saved half the batter and dipped my fish in the batter and placed it in a glass dish..single layer and put it in the fridge for a few hours. I added 2 TBSP old bay seasoning and pepper to taste when I re-dipped before I deep fryed...everyone loved it! I thought it was better then the fish and chips I had at a local restaurant last week!!

I thought I could not possibly like this because it was too easy and had too few ingredients.  It was great!  The texture and mild flavor were great.  I added a teaspoon of chili paste for some spice and only added 2 tablespoons per some recommendations.  I may add a little less salt next time too.  This was an amazingly simple recipe.  Much better than the expensive batter mix I usually buy from the store.  The texture was the best, and the catfish had plenty of flavor with the nice, crunchy outer batter.

This recipe was great (with the 2 tbsp baking powder alteration). I chose the recipe on short notice when the first recipe I picked didn't turn out and it was awesome.

I should have went with some of the reviewer's suggestion and decreased the baking powder. It is a great, light and easy batter.

This is the best fish batter I've been able to find. I reduced the baking powder to 2 T as well. It's great seasoned, too. I addded Indian curry powder the first time I made it, and it was great.

I took the advice of others and used 2 Tbsp. of baking powder instead of 1/4 cup.  I also used garlic salt and added some seafood seasoning mix.  It was very good and the family really liked it.  Personally I tasted a hint of bitterness so I will try using a little less baking powder the next time.

The name is truly fitting of this batter. Best I have ever made. Cut back on the baking powder as well, and was pleased with being able to still taste the fish "I" caught last summer... Yum Yum

light, crispy batter that allows you to still taste the fish, not just the batter. For a change i added curry powder one day and it was new exciting batter, and just as good

This was an unbelievably simple recipe, but it was wonderful.  I had to add a little water later as the batter thickened as I fried the fish.  That was to be expected, though.

GUYS! I HOPE YOU READ THIS FIRST. The 1/4 cup baking powder is definitely a misprint. It is CRAZY bitter. We had to throw it out. The author needs to come back and change it because a LOT of people have wasted a LOT of food with this recipe. Use 1/4 tbsp baking soda and you should be fine.

The taste of the batter was very good! But one problem when I was frying the fish some of them the batter falling off or fell off after frying!
Did I do something wrong?
In one of the review said they used self rising flour could that been the problem ? If not then idk !
I put in 1ts of baking powder so besides me using self rising flour I followed the recipe!!
Oh also got bags of cod from Walmart, and thawed it out!

This turned out really good! I followed the advice of others and used 2 TBSP of baking powder as 1/4 c. seemed like a lot. Instead of salt I used cajun seasoning, although I think you could season with any preference you have. Super crispy and light! Would probably make a good batter for onion rings, too.

Just remember to cut the baking soda at least in HALF or it’ll be bitter.  It is a nice thin coat but if you don’t want thin add an egg.

I followed the recipe fully and wished I saw the comments before. There was definitely too much baking powder so definitely decrease that as it made it bitter and was a bit thick so need to add more milk. I added spices to make it taste better but still couldn’t hide the bitterness. It was nice and crispy though.

Very good batter. 
I only used 2 Tablespoons of Baking powder.  1/4 cup would leave and aftertaste that would not be pleasant.

Absolutely fantastic!! I did only use 2 T of baking powder with 3/4 cup of milk and water as suggest by others. I also added lemon pepper, garlic, and salt. The fish came looking picture perfect and the family, including kids, loved it!

This was sooo amazing, light, crispy, fluffy with a very nice flavor. I was so nervous after all the reviews, I started to scale back on the baking soda-I’m so glad I didn’t. For such a remarkable turnout- this will be my go to recipe. No need to alter this recipe at all. We made cod, I just wasn’t sure how long to cook it for after we had dipped out fish in the batter. A few trail and error pieces & we figured it out.

Pretty good batter. Made it with no changes. Baking powder was fine and made it really light and crispy.  Dredge in flour before battering as the batter is super thick. Worth it to leave as is and not diluting. However i can see this being really a blank canvass for adding more flavor by way of herbs and spices.  But i liked it very much and went perfect with my walleye.

Quick, easy restaurant-style fish batter. Used 2 tbsps instead of 1/4 cup of baking powder. Add 1/2tsp. garlic powder, and it adds a wonderful flavor to the batter.

Used this batter with Bluegill fillets, only change I made was I  put 1/2 tsp. baking powder in. I will use again but I will add more seasonings.

Made it last night. Easy and very good.
Only modification  would be to add some of your favorite seasoning.

Definately will make again.  Batter is super sticky!  It stays on in the deep fryer.  I might sprinkle my fish with old bay then batter for a littler more flavor.  Came out great so looking forward to playing with this recipe again soon.

substituted 2TBSP baking powder and used seasoned salt instead of plain.  Came out fantastic and crispy.  For fish I used Tilapia fillets.  I haven't tried any other fish yet, but I'm assuming the results will be similar.  If you want more batter increase the ingredients proportionally to your needs.  I used 3/4 cup milk and water and 1 1/2 cups flour  also added 1 extra TBSP of baking powder and another TSP of seasoned salt.  There are never leftovers LOL

This recipe is advertised as crispy.  Nonsense.  Any batter with milk will be doughy and soft, so unless you like soggy batter from the '50's when no one knew any better, ignore this recipe.  Also, the amount of baking powder makes it awful.  Just take a big-ol'-spoonful of baking powder and throw that down the hatch, and see how good it tastes.  Yuck.

I like the versatility to add a little less water for a thicker batter, and it still cooks and browns in plenty of time without over-cooking the fish. Thank you!

Based on other reviewers, I reduced the baking powder by half. Added just a little chili powder, but it turned out we couldn't taste it. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and deep fried bite-sized pieces of cod in coconut oil. YUM! Great recipe!

Horrible with the 1/4 c baking soda, but great with 1 tsp.  As another cook stated, if you aren't using a deep fryer, you need to have enough oil for the fish to float, otherwise it sticks to the pan and pulls the batter off.

This was amazing! everyone who had it gave best compliments.
SPECIAL NOTE to Lisa who had given it one star...try it again... next time use 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder instead of a 1/4 of a cup, it would definitely taste a whole lot better.. :)

This recipe is easy and does stick to the food.  It was nice and crunchy.  I had extra batter so had a fun time finding other items in the fridge to try it on.   Perfect for mushrooms, cheese chunks & asparagus, too.

I made this batter for the first time, but thought the amount of baking powder was high, so used 25% less.  

Still FAR too much!!  The taste of the baking powder overpowered the fish and left an unpleasant sensation in the mouth afterwards.

I took the advise and used only 1.5 tablespoons of baking powder.  I also had to use twice as much liquid (in used water as per recommendations) to make the batter thin enough to coat fish.  I also dredged the fish in seasoned flour first.
I had no issues the the batter staying in the fish and it was quite tasty, if a little limp.

I halved the baking powder as others suggested and it came out great. This was my first time frying fish in a batter. You can add additional seasonings to your taste. I added some cayenne, garlic, honey, and lime.

This fish batter has nothing on a fancy restaurant, so crispy, flaky and delicious. I added garlic powder, onion powder and pepper. Southern cooking at it's best.

It was a little too thick, which made the fish hard to coat.  The finished product was light and delicious, though.  I'll definitely make this again, but maybe will add more liquid.

I substituted the milk for heavy cream, added some seasoned salt to the mix, along with garlic powder,  added about 1/4 cup of water more to make it less clumpy. It was soooo good and flaky. I even fried the remaining batter as chips. Will be doing this again for sure!

Deliciously light and crunchy. I converted it to gluten free for my wife and she was amazed. I used a blend of rice flour and gluten free flour to replace the wheat flour and swapped the dairy milk to almond milk while adding some white pepper and roasted garlic powder for additional flavor. It was the best battered fish I’ve ever eaten and now my wife can enjoy it with me.

Did not give this five stars as the initial recipe calls for 1/4 cup of Baking Powder. Way too much. 1/4t is all you need. I read all the reviews and see some people even mis read this and used baking soda! Yikes! But added my own spices to my taste and this was an awesome base for a great all purpose batter. Light and crunchy and very good when you add flavor. I added salt, pepper, onion powder, a touch of sage, garlic powder and a dash of cyan pepper. Would be a great stick to it onion ring batter as well. Dredge in seasoned flour and it sticks great!

I followed the advice of others with the baking powder. I added my own seasoning of parsley and ancho chili with a little cayenne powder. I served it with a homemade spicy tartar sauce. Delicious. A go to recipe!

Great recipe, just make sure to add a bit of seasoning (I used some tempura crumbs and a generous amount of  mrs dash. The crust recipe is light crunchy and great the flavoring sent it over the top!

I've made this several times, and it's delicious!  However, the recipe is wrong regarding the measurement for baking powder.  It should be 1/4 tsp.  If you make this small change, the recipe will be perfect.  My husband and I aren't fish lovers, unless it's fried fish.  I make this with cod, and it's very good.

i used the recipe for 2 servings instead of 6. The batter came out way to chunky, like a dough. I had to add a bunch more liquid so i could dip the fish in it. Other than that its simple, low calorie and it works.

I adjusted the recipie for 2 people, and had to end up adding an additional 1/4 of liquid to offset the dry ingredients, because even though it was adjusted, there wasn’t enough liquid to make it a batter and not a solid...

First shot at making a fish batter. This seemed simple enough and I had the ingredients needed on hand. Read through the reviews first and cut the baking powder to a rough measurement of  2Tbsp. I also added my own seasoning, as I imagined a batter with just a tsp of salt, would be rather bland.  However, I didnt thin the batter out as some other reviewers had, and wish I had, as it was a little thick for my liking on the fish. I will adjust next time. Will use this again.

First of all I should let everyone know that I put this on a FRESH caught fish. My boyfriend caught it for us. WOW. Anyways, Excellent.  Was a little too thick so I aded more water. Could taste the baking powder in the mix slightly so would suggest going easy on that. I used 2tsp. In terms of cooking it tasted light and crispy, and stayed nicely coasted on the fish. Did not taste oily or soggy. Would be much better with spices added to it. Will make again

I liked the thickness of the batter. I used 2T of baking powder as the others suggested but I felt the batter still tuned out on the bitter side. In addition, I added 1t of the following: Old Bay, garlic powder, and onion powder. Next time I make this batter, I'll try just using 1T of baking powder as well as the spice additions mentioned above.

Great tasting batter. My family loved it! My only recommendation is that you will probably need to adjust/lower from whatever temperature that you normally fry in because it might burn fast. Once I adjusted the temperature it was perfect. For me it was 300-325 degrees.

For years I have tried to find a recipe for batter that actually stuck to whatever I was deep frying. This recipe is by far the best, and the only one I’ve found to work. It’s a simple, but effective recipe. I battered fish, added Lemon/Pepper seasoning. It was an absolute hit. My Fish and Chip night was a total success. Thank you!!

I have made it 4 times now.  It is ok.  Puffed up a lot.  The taste was ok.  I could definitely taste the baking powder which detracted from the overall experience.  The puffiness definitely adds to the texture.

Very good. I did like other people and only used 2tbs of the baking powder. I added pepper, onion powder and garlic powder to give it some flavor. The batter was very tasty, crispy and fluffy. I'm definetly going to save this recipe and I recommend other people should try it.

My husband and I love this batter recipe! We did adjust to self rising flour and added a little more water to it.

I would give this recipe more like 3 1/2 stars because I had to edit the recipe. Based on other reviews, I only used 2T of baking powder compared to 1/4 cup. I also added an extra 2T spoons of water, as the batter was waaay too thick. Next time I'll probably add an extra 1/4 cup of liquid, because I still feel like with the addition  of 2T,  it was a tad too thick. I also added extra salt, pepper, garlic and paprika. My husband and kids loved it, hubby said it was super yummy! I will use again with the edits! Thank for the base recipe!!!

I never,  EVER give low reviews,  but this,  was awful.  It stuck to my skillet,  so I took my batch out,  drained the oil and finished in my well-seasoned cast iron skillet.  Stuck there too.....nothing ever sticks to my skillet!   All the breading was falling off,  and since I chose shrimp and oysters, had to improvise quickly! I redredged my batch in the wet,  THEN redredged in some dry flour.  By the time I needed to fry again,  my oil was dirty.  It was edible.....the way I did it.  But,  this is not a good recipe.  Just like everyone else said,  even the ingredients are waaaayyy off.  I tell ya,  I was missing my ole store bought batter mix tonite.  Aggravated I trusted the rating. sucks,  don't waste your good food on this one.  Sorry. It's actually a negative one star. Should've known,  everyone who had success with this batter changed the ingredients.....

Take this batter one step further and use salmon instead of the traditional cod or haddock. Excellent!!  P. S. I added my seasonings to the batter, kosher salt, smoked lemon pepper, old bay, onion powder. P. S. S. I too reduced the baking powder.

I made this tonight for dinner and got raves. Did exactly as recipe suggested but only used 2 tbsp baking powder. It was an absolute hit.  Used canola oil.  Not the least bit greasy and the cod was as  moist as ever.  Just used a regular cooking pot with a thermometer on the side. Cooked at 350 until golden brown.

I used this batter on the bass, walleye and blue gill that we've accumulated.  I will definitely use it again.  I read a few of the reviews and followed Chef Pare's advise by adding lemon juice and honey.  I only used 1 tbsp of baking powder and I added garlic powder and seasoning salt.  My husband loved it and I thought it was similar to Long John Silvers.

This is a pretty thick batter.... its is like a thin layer of crispy bread on your fish...  I cut the baking powder to 1.5 tbsp and added salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and old bay seasoning. I didn't add enough flavor in the beginning but ended up adding more after I tried it on a piece of fish.  It was really good, but a little too thick for our liking.  My husband wanted to test out 2 methods so he used store bought batter called New Orleans Style fish fry batter (I don't know if its only sold in La) but with that you dip it in milk first and then used the dry batter... so we used about 1/4 can of beer to thin out my batter and then dipped it in the New Orleans style dry batter and that ended up being our favorite. =)

It wasn't good at all. I made it exactly like the recipe and it is way too much baking soda. Yikes. I then tried adding some paprika, onion and garlic powder and pepper .  It was only slightly better. I reccomend using a TBSP of soda and a TBSP of baking powder.

Very good and crispy fish was moist and flakey. Used self rising flour no baking powder because I used self rising flour that has baking powder already in it that is why it is called self rising. Delicious!

This recipe  is to bitter, the excess baking powder is the culprit. I followed the measurements exactly, i will try again and deduct at least half of the baking  powder. There was a nice crispness to the batter, however the bitterness was off putting.

This is THE best batter recipe! I've used it for a few years now and love it. My advice...don't try to get creative and add spices they just take away from what you are battering ??

Thankfully we tasted it prior to frying all of our fish. That baking soda taste was horrible! We threw out the batter and made a different recipe.  Still wasted a good pound of cod though.

Not sure about this one... I'm making it right now and just had to drop the fish in a gooish batter that reminded me of cake. Not even sure my fish could survive this mess. Let you know a bit latter and see if that star moves up or lower than could possibly go.  Why would you post a video that it's so far away from the recipe?

Love it, didn't use all the baking powder like many others.  I've used 1-2 tbsp and haven't noticed a difference.

Now my fish is loved at my house as much (if not more) than my husband super secret fish batter recipe.

This was a great recipe.  I took the advice of others and only used one tablespoon of baking powder and added some garlic salt/seasoning to the batter.  It was light and puffy.  I would make this again!

This batter is great.  It fries up light and crispy.  I added some tempura mix and old bay seasoning and made halibut fish and chips.  I will definitely make this every time I make fish and chips

This batter made delicious fish!  It very light and crispy.  Next time I think I will try self rising flour  and decrease the baking powder. I could taste a bit of the bitterness of the baking powder. I will absolutely make this batter again with these minor adjustments. I used coconut oil for frying.

It wouldn’t stick to the fish at all, and the two fillets we made came out a torn up, oily mess. The scraps we salvaged didn’t taste bad, but it wasn’t worth the headache. If you try this, don’t add so much baking soda (you don’t even need it, to be honest), and remember to dip the fish in something the batter will stick to, like flour or corn meal. Maybe it would have worked then. Please test your recipes before you say that they work.

This was an easy quick recipe with an excellent result. Yes it's a lot of baking powder but if you leave it to rest a while it becomes so light and airy creating a lovely crisp batter. The mixture looks thick but once it rises it's not stodgy at all. Make sure you fry in a decent amount of oil 1-2cms to ensure even cooking. Despite other reviews saying they had a bitter aftertaste we didn't find this an issue at all. Batter Perfection!!

Making this batter was simple and easy but I found the batter fell off to easily while cooking. I had to increase the serving size but 1 1/4 teaspoon of salt is nuts. So I used maybe 1/4 teaspoon if that.. Was okay probably need to add more flour to make it a bit more tacky and sticks to the fish

This was the worst recipe I ever got online .. It was a total mess and never turned crispy . It stuck to my first pan so I pulled out my cast iron skillet .. It stuck to it and I never have issues with it .. I thought wow that's a lot of baking powder but I was following the recipe .. I'd recommend finding a different recipe .. This one is horrible  .

Great starter recipe! Used this to coat chunks of cod...Made a few modifications. We are gluten free due to celiac disease so I started with a cup of gum free gluten free flour, next I used a cup of buttermilk,  then added water to get the right consistency. I also decreased baking powder to 2 Tb as others suggested. Next I added garlic and onion powders, Italian seasoning, dill, and a dash of cayenne. I coated the fish then fried in oil at 350 until brown. Fantastic! happy to have this in my recipe box!

VERY BITTER- no one could eat this. I had to throw out all the cooked calamari. It  left an awful bitter after taste.  I assume bitterness due to baking powder as recipe followed in exact quantity.  Very disappointed.

i love simple recipes where substitutions don't/minimally affect the outcome. i used more water since i was out of milk, whole wheat flour, and subbed the soda for baking powder as instructed by others. light and crisp as advertised, though perhaps a touch salty.

I loved it. I did add a wee bit of lemon juice in place of some of the liquid and as i added the amount of liquid to the receipe , it was added slowly...this way i kept an eye on the consistency of thickness. I also added garlic grinded sea salt instead of just salt, along with some italian seasoning a pinch...and it was tastefulawith tartar sauce and everyone enjoyed it thoroughly.  Thank you so very much.

I will definitely use this as my go to fry batter.  I added a tsp of Old Bay seasoning and then used less of the baking powder, 2T.  I added a tsp of honey and fresh lemon juice as recommended by another reviewer.  I even used it to coat some broccoli.  Very light tasting. We used peanut oil to fry with.  4 stars due to having to alter it.

I cut the recipe in half, using two tbsp of baking powder, and it foamed up like crazy. The fish fingers were light and crispy after deep-frying, but the taste was a bit bitter. I'd recommend halving the baking powder.

I also used less baking powder, and I added a touch more water and milk. It was a good thickness at that point but when I went to fry the fish, the batter fell off. I tried a few different pieces and temps but I couldn't get it to stay on.  Not a good frying batter.

T E R R I B L E recipe! I had to create an account to make sure NO ONE else would make this recipe. The baking soda was FAR TOO MUCH we had to throw the food away. VERY upsetting especially as we used good fish. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT USE ALL THAT BAKING SODA!!!!!

Made a few mistakes I think . Fish was cold not close to room temp, fillets needed to be drained more and I think the batter was a little too thick. I think if I prep better thin it out a touch it would be great as not doing so caused it to be cooked too long to brown. Better luck to me next time

This recipe was so helpful. Same as the rest I cut the baking powder. I've made several adjustments. Depends on the amount of fish. I add hot sauce , it works really well to get rid of the baking powder taste and you can't taste the sauce. Most certainly it's not hot. Seems I can never make enouph because guests always asking for more. Great starting point for batter. Fiddle around with the recipe until you have what you want.

Good.  Needed more salt though.  I'm not sure how much I added.  Like others have suggested, I cut back the Baking Powder to 2 TBSP.  I also added lemon juice and garlic powder.  Taste your batter better using it and add additional flour or water or salt to get to the desired flavor. :)

Glad I read reviews first!  2 Tbsp baking powder not 1/4 cup. I also had to add 1/4 cup water.  Next time I will leave it though, just to see. This turned out sweet and tasty. Added 1 Tbsp honey, 1 tsp lemon juice.  To taste: Garlic, Cayenne Pepper, Paprika, Celery Salt.  Enjoy :)

This batter is delish! I don't know if it's the baking powder, but it has a Perfect crunch. It's good for fish. We make fish tacos with fried fish using this recipe. It's also good for onion rings. You can't go wrong with this recipe. Thank you!!

I only made 2 pieces of fish and I tried to scale down the recipe. .. mixture  came out watery. 
fish tasted like a slight fried but more so pan seared.
still good.

This was spectacular!!! Would not adjust anything. Batter was thin at first but like a pancake batter it thickens as it sits and that's a step perhaps that is missed.i think the batter has to sit before dipping fish.i also bring out my fish from frig approx.10 -15 mins. Before cooking giving the hot oil just enough time to cook fish perfectly. Ca t wait to have a Friday nite fish fry with the whole family.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good batter. Fish came out crispy and delicious.  I would make 3/4 of a recipe next time as there was quite a bit left over and there was enough fish for 6 people (that's a note to myself).

Excellent!  Made it as written and it was great. Second time I experimented with less baking powder ( used 1 tbsp) liked it better.  For me it's 5 stars because you can play with what you add depending on what your battering. I added hot sauce and garlic powder to it for haddock. Made as written for cod etc. Awesome!

As the recipe stands, way too much baking soda.  Other than that, it would be a perfect recipe - we did not limit it to fish, but started pulling everything out of the fridge and freezer, to try battering it!  Our favorite so far?  quartered string cheese sticks!

Very, very good.  I just made this for the first time tonight, and I wish I could give it a 4 1/2 stars.  I did find the batter too runny and had to add a bit more flour.  It also stuck to the pan a lot, but that is probably me not having quite enough oil in the pan for the size of fillets I used, rather than the recipe. Overall, the flavor was very good.  It was very light and delicate, and made wonderful little crispy bits that reminded me of Captain D's (in a good way). I will make this again.

Awesome batter! I mixed all the dry in a zip-lock bag before adding the milk and water. I also added only 1/8 of baking powder, but supplemented in the missing 1/8 cup with corn meal.
I also added a tsp of All Seasoned salt and a tsp of Old Bay seasoning. Turned out wonderfully!

Note: Don't dilly dally with the mixed batter; it starts to rise! (or mine did at least) I also had trouble with it sticking to the bottom of my fryer basket and not the fish on some. :(

The batter mix seems a little thick at first, but once on the fish and in the deep fryer it turned out perfectly. Thin and crispy with just enough flavor to compliment the catfish. I'm not a fan of a lot of breading.
Couple it with jalapeno hush puppies and a veggie and you've got yourself a great meal!

Cooked up perfectly. Excellent batter for fish, made haddock fish & chips that looked & taste like it came from the best English or Irish pub. Don't hesitate to try this as-is, edit at your own risk.

I had not tried to make fried fish in the past since I don't have a deep fat frier. But I tried this recipe a while ago and decided it's a keeper! It turned out better than fish from a restaurant! I've made it 2-3 times now and am making it again tonight. I used Einkorn flour since regular flour bothers my stomach. I also used beef tallow for frying (left over from making bone broth) and it's absolutely delicious, I just fry it up in a skillet. A little homemade coleslaw on the side makes for a great meal!

I substituted 2/3 of the flour because I always make recipes healthier.  If it passes my wife's taste test I know it's good because she only cares about taste.  She raved!  So I used equal parts of coconut, garbanzo and almond flour along with a tbsp of flax meal.

this was certainly a 5* in our house.  I did alter the baking soda amount as suggested to 2 tbsp baking powder and wrote to All Recipes asking them to make the change on the recipe before others ruin their dinner using the 1/4 cup!

I did add 1 tsp of onion powder though which I feel is needed for flavour.  Otherwise this would be a pretty bland batter. I also had to thin with a little more water. I only had 2 Haddock Fillets so cut the recipe in half (1 tbsp baking powder) and I had enough for both pieces plus 4 large mushrooms.  Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe!

I made this recipe last night with fish and we loved it. It wasn't the least bit bitter.  I brought some to my sister in law that was at least an hour old, maybe older, and she couldn't believe how crispy it was still.  I am using it again tonight and this time we thought we would try to fry up some pickles like Texas Roadhouse.

This is a very solid recipe. Depending on the number of fish pieces and the stability of the fish, you may want to increase the  milk and /or water. I also add powdered garlic, onion and paprika. You can add just about any dry spice you'd like to add some zest to this already good batter! It's easy, quick, and a special favourite with children. Try and fry it in extra light olive oil for the health benefits (not extra virgin as it becomes toxic at a high temperature). Add a pat of butter to temper the oil.

Good recipe except adjustment needed:
1 cup all purpose flour
3/4 cup milk
3/4 cup water
2/3 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
**Note: The amount of salt is for folks that don't like too salty. For most Americans' preferences, use 1 teaspoon salt.
             Marinate fish with ground cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt & pepper for 1/2 - 1hr, this will give another layer of flavor, it's worth it! Hubby was amazed of the unique flavor of the fish meat!

I make this a lot. I've followed Chef Pare's suggestion to cut the baking powder to 1 Tbsp and added a little honey.  

This improves an already great recipe.

Perfect, considering I was out. I just tweaked a little by using self rising flour I had on hand with spices such as Old Bay, Season Salt and pepper....

Very good, used 2 Tbs baking powder instead, as recommended, and added some onion powder, pepper, and smoked paprika. I'll probably lose the paprika next time. Very good, easy, will use again!

I used this batter to make fish tacos, and the fish turned out perfect. I followed other comments and only used 2T of baking powder.

I didn't care for this recipe.  The batter wasn't near as thick as I expected it to be, and most of it fell off and remained in the skillet.  I added 1/2 cup of yellow corn meal, and still it was runny.

Used it tonight and have got to say I assumed the baking powder was a typo and used a 1/4 tsp instead of a cup and it was perfect! My fish looked and beautiful and tasted even better. Will definitely keep this recipe for any other battering I do.

I think it would have been better had I followed the recipe.  I used whole wheat flour to try to make it a bit healthier.  I did have to add more water and milk because the whole wheat really soaks up the liquid. The one thing I noticed is that the whole wheat coating soaked up a lot of oil, as well.  Probably better to stick to white flour when making a batter.  All, in all, it's a good recipe.  I did cut down on the baking powder (as others suggested).

Best fish batter out there!  Browns up nicely when fried, crispy to eat and is just like the professionals make.  We haven't ordered fish and chips for years because of this recipe!!
Only put 2 tablespoons of the baking powder in!

We used 1/4 teaspoon baking powder as other's suggested.  It was good.  It broke apart easily after deep frying several (not sure why but it did).  My husband added some pepper and some other seasonings for spice also.

It was good.  Not great and certainly not the best we've had, but good.

I followed some of the other reviews and increased the liquid a bit and only used 2 tbsp of Baking Powder. It was extremely tasty. I did have an issue with the fish sticking to my pan, but I think that was my fault. Not sure if I should have used only a skiff of oil or a deeper pan.

This was the best fish batter we've ever tried. We couldn't believe how well it turned out for such a simple recipe. We did cut the baking powder back to 2 T. and added some seasonings to the mix, but that was all to suit our taste. The basic recipe itself is still a keeper!

We all LOVED this.  I switched the milk for whole buttermilk.  And when I saw 1/4 cup of baking powder, I thought it was a typo.  After reading other comments, I used only 1T (but we are at high elevation).  It turned out great and will definitely use it again.  I put 4 stars because of the baking powder suggestion in the recipe, otherwise I would put 5.

Great recipe but I did worry it might have a bitter taste with all that baking powder but I didn't cut back.  Added lemon pepper seasoning, and a little more milk and water, and it was delicious.

The original recipe is WAY off from reality! I doubled the recipe and STILL only used 1/4 cup baking power. Even with the change I just said, unless you add more milk, the "batter" becomes a thick biscuit dough. The last thing beyond it's cook-ability, is it's taste. The taste is that of nothing but baking power, which is why everyone complained of it being bitter. I seasoned it with so Worcestershire sauce and a few other flavors.

The amount of baking powder doesn't sound right, and I didn't want to risk wasting ingredients, so I cut back to the suggested 2 Tbsp. (I don't think 1/4 tsp would be enough, as some have done.) I also added black pepper and cayenne pepper. It was light and crispy just like everyone says, and I thought it tasted great. The batter is a bit thick, but it stayed on well. I used this for fried green tomatoes, but I will use it for fish, zucchini, mushrooms, etc.

Really loved it! So thin and crispy.  Instead of just flour, i used 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 self raising flour and like the other reviews i used only 2T of baking powder.  Maybe next time i will use less salt... its really too much?

Wish I had read the reviews first.  Definitely too bitter.  That much baking powder simply makes the batter too alkaline and it also creates an unpleasant mouth feel after eating it.

Very tasty batter.  I followed suggestions on the baking powder and reduced it to 2 tablespoons, added a few spices, and it turned out wonderful.  Light and crisp!  My favorite has always been beer batter but this family doesn't have beer at all anymore.  This is a great substitute, just as good as beer batter.  Thanks!

I tried this last night I added Weber Bay Seasoning (or Old Bay)to the batter (still added the salt) and seasoned my Tilapia with it.  I also added more water a little at a time to get a thinner consistency but not too thin.  It was amazing!  My daughter who doesn't eat fish asked me to dip my chicken in the batter so next time I'll add Weber's Kickin Chicken and see how it goes.

We like spicy, so I improvised a bit on this receipe by adding 1/4 tsp each of ground garlic and Old Bay Seasoning. 1/8 tsp of ground Cayenne pepper. I also reduced the baking powder to 2 T.  When cooking less fish, I reduce the ingredients (except the seasonings). We use it on catfish, smelt, and shrimp!

I made this the other day and it was great! I followed other reviewers advice and reduced the baking powder. I assumed it was supposed to read 1/4 tsp so that's what I used. I also dipped my fish in flour before the batter which helped it stick better. It was a bit messy, but that was to be expected since this was my first time making battered fish. It was a big hit and this will definitely be my 'go-to' batter recipe. I look forward to trying it on chicken balls as well!

The consistency was great, light and fluffy batter. However the flavor did need some work. I would recommend seasoning your fish before battering as well as seasoning your batter since it comes out very overwhelmingly fishy tasting without any other flavor to compliment. Otherwise a good starting recipe. Also want to try this for onion rings :)

If you read the recipe it calls for 1/4 cup of baking powder. I would not recommend this one at all.

Ewww..I followed the recipe, incorporating all of the suggestions (ie, the baking powder issue). Both my kids and I detected an aftertaste.  Also, the batter cooked so much faster than the fish (thin cod), even though my oil was at 350 degrees.  Will NOT be making this again.

My son's on a gluten-free and dairy-free diet, so beer battered fish is out of the question.  I made this with coconut milk and it turned out fantastic!  Thanks for the "beerless" option!

I made this with fresh halibut and it was fantastic - it was up there with some of the best restaurant  battered fish I've had.  I followed the tips to reduce baking powder and added a little salt and pepper in the batter.  Can't wait to make this one again.

For a non-fryer that I am this recipe is GREAT with the change to 1/4 TSP baking powder.  I sprinkled low-quality pollock with a spicy salt and let it set for about an hour before coating and frying in coconut oil.  My children and I think this one is definately a keeper!

Wow, this was great!  I added garlic powder and onion powder, and just completely forgot about the baking powder (accidental) and this was still great, thumbs up!  So would the baking powder have made it "puffier", or crispier? What's it for? I may try it next time, or may have it just the way we did.

Excellent, close to a British fish batter. I agree with the other comments to reduce the baking powder to 2T rather than 1/4 C. Great batter for Fish Sandwiches!

This was super easy and looked absolutely amazing - Just like something from a restaurant. My only criticism is that it lacks flavor. I added one clove of freshly ground garlic and approximately 1/4 teaspoon of pepper, just to kick it up a notch. My boyfriend and I also made this with salmon fillets cut into strips rather than the standard whitefish normally used for frying. It was a super tasty alternative to the classic, and I highly recommend trying it. Along with this recipe, of course!

This was better than store bought, but I did make a lot of changes. I mixed 3/4 flour and 1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs, and added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp black pepper. I keep the salt, milk, and water the same, but decreased the baking powder to 3 tsp.

This is a great batter.  It also works great for deep fried banana  peppers.  I used self rising flour and did not add the baking powder, and used 1 cup of skim milk.  I also added some seasoning and it turned out great.  I will be using this recipe again.

We made this batter and it was delicious. I added 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder, since I quickly glanced at the recipe.  I never would imagine 1/4 cup of baking powder to be correct.  Batter worked perfect.

This is fantastic. I also took the advice of other reviewers and added more liquid and only 2 Tbsp of baking powder, otherwise it would have been 5 stars. We used this for both fish and on shrimp and the results were great! It makes a nice light and crispy batter that is delicious.

It looked WONDERFUL.  The fish inside cooked beautifully - perfectly moist.  BUT......  unfortunately the batter had a nasty bitter after-taste.

I made the batter with the common suggestion to reduce baking soda to 2T. I don't see what's so special about this batter.  It tasted bitter to me.  However, my husband gobbled down the fish and said it was delicious.  Maybe he was really hungry.

What a great recipe for a quick batter.  I used it on talapia fish - I halved the recipe for a smaller serving and used non-fat milk and it was a bit thick but added water to thin out and used low sodium salt and 2 tsp. baking powder.  There was no problem with the batter not sticking and it was a golden brown and crispy.  Just Perfect.  Thanks for the recipe and suggestions by others.

I did not care for this recipe. I considered other people's comments, and used only 2 Tbsp of baking soda. Very disappointing. I will never make this again.

This to be way too thick so I had to add more liquid. It was ok, next time I will use less baking powder like most suggest!! I also chopped up about a tablespoon of fresh Rosemary and mixed that in too!

Absolutely fabulous! My husband thought it was just like Authur Treacher's, which he loves. I used self-rising flour and 2T baking powder.

Prepared as indicated, save for halving the baking powder.    Excellent consistency, and I imagine this would work well on many other foods.

I wish I took time to read the reviews first.  I ruined some  really good fish w/ the ingredients listed.  DO NOT use the amount of baking powder listed...it is leaves a very bitter aftertaste.  I will try the suggestions of 2T to see if that makes a difference but was very disappointed making the recipe as is.

Crispy and golden! I used about 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white. Also cut back to 2 Tbs of baking soda as recommended on here. It's a keeper!
