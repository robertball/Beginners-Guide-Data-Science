This was a wonderful recipe.  It has been a hit at several parties, I modified it using some advice from other reviews...
*saute fresh chopped garlic into butter (5-6  cloves)
* use double the spinach and artichoke hearts
* cut the creamcheese to 1.5 packages
* cut the sourcream to only 1 container
* use a mix of parmesean, asiago and romano

I also made pita chips to go along with it...just brush olive oil mixed with pepper and garilic salt onto cut up pita pieces (triangles) and bake at 350 until crisp.  

Tastes better than what you get at resturaunts.

The missing ingredient: LEMON JUICE.

I agree with another reviewer that when you have to change the recipe a whole lot, it's not a five star recipe. But with the changes I made, I would give this SIX stars!

- I sauteed three garlic cloves and about two tablespoons of finely chopped onion with the butter

- I used twice the artichokes and chopped them pretty small (like 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch pieces)

- I used the full amount of cream cheese and sour cream-- half the amount looked disproportionate to all of those artichokes

- I used kosher salt. mmm.

- when I added the sour cream and cream cheese, I squeezed the juice of one small lemon into the mix.

I figured the blandness indicated the need for a bright flavor. I really think that lemon juice was just the thing. Ours was tangy, creamy, and delicious.

I've made this dip 5-6 times, my suggestions...crush 4 cloves of garlic and cook in the butter as it's melting, also, I use two cans of artichoke hearts, and I cut the cream cheese and sour cream in half, and finally, for a little more flavor, I add some ground pepper, a dash of cayenne pepper to taste, and a tablespoon of worcestershire....great tasting and easy...can even put a big batch in a crock pot on low....stays warm and delicous for hours.

Although I could feel myself getting fatter with every bite, this was soooooooo yummy.  I served it at a party and everyone loved it.  A couple girls even asked for the recipe.  A couple of notes:  it does get cold and set up rather quickly, so try to serve it in small quantities, reserving the rest on the stove to keep warm.  Also, the recipe makes a LARGE batch; if you're not entertaining, I suggest cutting it in half for munching at home.

This was truly wonderful!  I did make a few changes, however.  I used a 16 oz. bag of frozen spinach, only one container of sour cream, and 2 Tablespoons of minced garlic in place of the garlic salt.  It tasted just like the dip a caterer made for a party I went to.  Make sure you buy 'chopped' spinach - mine was frozen leaves and I had to put it in a blender for a few seconds to chop it up.

Ok, I made this dip and took it to a BBQ as an appetizer. It was gone in no time and everybody wanted the recipe! I had read a lot of the previous reviews and so decided to make some modifications to the recipe: I used almost 16 oz of frozen spinach and just a little more than half the cream cheese and sour cream. I also sauteed 2 heaping Teaspoons of crushed garlic in the butter before adding the spinach and artichokes to the saucepan. I added salt and lots of pepper. The dip turned out nice and chunky and had a lot of flavor - can anybody say 'garlic'???. I served it warm with some sliced french bread. This will be my new favorite!

This is a great recipe. I absolutely hate mayonnaise so I'm excited that this doesn't have it. However, when I made it the first time there was too much of the cream and not enough "filling". 
First, I replaced the garlic salt with fresh sauteed minced/chopped garlic (which I cooked with the spinach) and salt (which I added after the dip was done).  
Second, I cut the amount of cream cheese and sour cream in half (1 package of each) and replaced half of the Parmesan with Romano (totally your call, we just like the mix) and it turned out BEAUTIFUL! AND... if you want to put it in the oven you can!
 This is a great starter recipe. Everyone who has tried this has loved it.

This was so creamy and rich.  I didn't add all the sour cream called for, but it was perfect.  I also used olive oil instead of butter, and added chopped garlic to saute with spinach and artichokes.

Wow! What a great recipe! I also only used one container of sour cream and cream cheese. I also made the recipe earlier in the day, cooled it off, then placed the saucepan in the refrigerator. When our guests arrived, I just put the saucepan back onto the stove and warmed it up again. Rave reviews from everyone!

This SERIOUSLY lacks flavor, which appears to be the general consensus. Many rate the recipe with 4 or 5 stars but go on to tell you how they basically reinvented the entire recipe so that it's unrecognizable to the original. That, my friends, does not a four star recipe make. Don't be fooled by the high star rating! I even added six cloves of garlic, onion powder and loads of salt and pepper. This dip leaves you with that annoying "this needs something" phrase hanging on the end of every bite. I don't know what it needs. Maybe onion? I planned to make this for Christmas as I'm hosting 25 for dinner and wanted something to set out for guests while I'm cooking. I'm SO glad I tried this in advance rather than be embarrassed serving to guests for the first time. I won't be making it again. Three stars is probably generous -- early Christmas present I guess. I'll look for a better recipe with more flavor.

This was a great recipe to start with. I used a lot of suggestions from others and put my own twist on it. I did roast garlic, then saute it in the butter. I added the artichokes and lemon juice to that, then put that in the slow cooker with 16 oz. of cream cheese (fat free). I used 16 oz. of spinach instead of 10, and 1 container of sour cream, but later added a little mayo and Lactaid. After heating thoroughly I added a little more lemon juice, chili powder and paprika (just a sprinkle!), and 21-spice salute from Trader Joe's. 

It only took 6 people to kill the crock pot-full, and they couldn't stop talking about how great it was! (Four of the people are into Spin-Art dip in a big way, two are foodies - I couldn't stop patting myself on the back :))

This recipe is awesome!  I used fresh spinach and garlic cloves and cooked with the butter, I also cut the sour cream and cream cheese in half.  The second time I made we added some crabmeat, pretty good!

Great.  I only used one box of cream cheese, and some of a container of 16 oz sour cream, but I added monterey jack cheese, which made it more sticky and cheesy.

This was fabulous!!!! I did as others suggested and added some minced garlic as I was sauteeing the spinach. Omitted the artichokes by preference. Halved the cream cheese and sour cream (and still ended up with a ton of dip). Also added some shredded mozz/provolone I had. Sprinkled in some cayenne and black pepper. This was amazingly delicious and light cream cheese and light sour cream worked just as well! This is a must try!

Used the base ingredients, but varied amounts, and added about a cup of mozzerella cheese in addition to the parmesan, and it turned out fabulous. Absolutely delicious. Now I don't have to pay 8.99 at a restaurant for some dip!

This is an awesome recipe! I'm asked to make it for birthday/holiday parties when we get together with the family! I always mix it up by adding different ingredients to change the flavor just slightly. For example, I usually saute about a teaspoon of minced garlic in with the butter, spinach and artichokes and I always add about 1/2 cup of mozzerella and 1/4 to 1/2 cup mayo. I've left out the artichokes and added chopped red pepper and crushed red pepper flakes for a spicer version. I've reduced the amount of spinach and added diced jalepenos and shredded pepper jack cheese for an even spicer dip! This recipe is so versatile, perfect for any occasion! I usually serve this with tortilla chips and "Tuscan Bread" (which I make by taking either homemade or storebought hoagies or Italian bread, cutting them into 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick slices, very lightly buttering each side, and very lighly sprinkling them with fresh parmesan cheese and shredded mozzerella cheese, plus a sprinkle of garlic salt. Then I bake them at 350 degrees for 10 minutes or less, until the cheese is melted and the edges start to brown.)

It was good. I would double the artichokes. I would cook the garlic in the butter as recommended. I did decrease the sourcream and creamcheese. It depends on you as to how much you want to decrease these.

Like most others, I halved the cheeses. I took it to my family Christmas party, and it was a huge hit. I put it in the oven and browned parmasan cheese over the top, but i wouldn't do that again. It dried it out too much. 2Tbsp chopped garlic and some garlic salt was a good addition. I'm not a hot sauce fan, but a dash or two really makes it better.

Very yummy dip!  I've made this several times and had requests for the recipes every single time.  I love garlic, so I add several minced garlic cloves for an extra kick.  Agree with decreasing the amount of sour cream and cream cheese.  I usually make a full batch and freeze half for another time.

I accidentally forgot to add the Parmesean cheese, but everyone really liked it anyway.  This makes a lot, so be sure to scale down if you are having a smaller crowd.

Tastes absolutely fabulous. I've used this recipe many times. This recipe makes wayyyy too much though, even for a big party. I recommend halving all the ingredients and it should give you plenty enough to serve many guests and yourself. Also, I added some minced fresh garlic rather than using garlic salt.

Great recipe with some changes first of all only add 1 16 oz container of sourcream and 1 8oz block of cream cheese and whip those together before adding them to the spinach mixture. I found that the parmesean was a bit much for me and next time will use mozerella cheese and I also added a couple of garlic cloves to the saute mixture. And then when everything was combined I baked in the oven for about 20 minutes! Hope this helps!

The basic idea of this was good, but it was very unbalanced.  I added 1/4 the amount of cream cheese and sour cream, and it was still creamier than I would have prefered.  I also added a lot of spices.  Things that went well: white pepper, paprika, onion (1/2 of one, added at the beginning, along with fresh garlic), dry mustard, a dash of cayanne,  a dash of cumin.  Not too much of the last two.

My recommendation: start with your spinach and artichokes, then make up your own proportions, a little bit at a time.

A little bland, but husband loved it and is always asking me to make it again.  I thought it was just okay.  I'm making it again and I will try less sour cream.(to me, that's what it tastes like).

I've now made this recipe twice.  Once for a dinner party appetizer for a few close friends and a second time for a BBQ we were hosting.  It makes A LOT, so either halve the recipe for a smaller group, or have lots of leftover.  WHich is not necessarily a bad thing, because my husband and I have enjoyed reheating the leftovers and eating them!!  Anyway, I endorse adding the Parmesan cheese and to give it a little more pizzazz, I added about a half packet of dry ranch dressing mix the second time.  I got many rave reviews from the 25 friends and neighbors we had over for the BBQ we just had!

Excellent! It was thick and creamy (draining the spinach after thawing helps). I added fresh garlic and a tbl of worcestershire as suggested, and refrigerated it overnight before warming it in crockpot for a potluck the next day. Try it as a topping on grilled filet.

Great dip!  I followed the advice of some others, adding garlic, doubling the artichokes & cutting the cream cheese in half.  I also added some cayenne.

Huge success! I made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer I went ahead and used the full amount of sour cream and cream cheese, but I added more spinich and artichokes because I knew my guests would want leftovers! I also used fresh spinich (more work but worht it!) and sauteed the spinich and artichokes with fresh minced garlic along with the butter....I served it with an assortment of crackers and hard breads from Trader Joe's....fabulous!

This is a great dip recipe.  Its incredibly easy and people just love it.  I've made it four times in the last month- everyone keeps begging for it!  I put it in the oven for a bit after cooking to brown it and thicken it up slightly.  GREAT RECIPE!

I love spinach artichoke dip and this recipe is an excellent version of it.  It is EXTREMELY rich, so if you want to "tame" it a bit, you might try halfing the amount of cream cheese.  It is great either way!

Thank you for this recipe! I always loved the richness of spinach dips and wondered how it was made. Following the recommendations of other reviewers:

16 oz bag of chopped spinach
14 oz can artichoke hearts
4-6 cloves minced garlic
Some minced onion
8 oz cream cheese
16 oz sour cream
Dash of Worchestershire sauce
Dash of lemon juice
Dash of pepper flakes, salt, pepper
Parmesean cheese
Mozzarella cheese

It was creamy, full of spinach with a little tang (also helps the absorption of iron). At first, I thought it would be too much spinach and artichoke but it cooks down nicely. Makes a big pot so there will be some leftovers. I think it must be healthy!

One word, EXCELLENT.  Just as good if not better than the dips that the restaurants serve.  I followed the advice of the other reviewer, decreased the cream cheese, sour cream, but increased the artichokes and spinach, and sautéed the garlic.  It was a huge hit for out football playoff party!

The recipe was great but I thought it had to much of a cream cheese flavor once it was done, I mixed in some home made salsa and it cut down on that flavor and tasted great. Next time I will just cut down on the cream cheese some.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and only used 8 oz. of cream cheese and 16 oz. of sour cream. I also used Romano and Parmesan cheeses in equal parts, about 1/2 c. of each. Everyone ate the dip and complimented me on it, but I am giving it 4 stars because although it was good, I have had far better Spinach Artichoke dips.

Awesome tasting spinach-artichoke dip!  I took the advice of other reviewers added some garlic cloves and sauteed with the butter.  I only used 1 pkg of cream cheese and 1 pint of sour cream.  I like to taste the spinach and artichoke, and would like to try adding an extra can of artichoke next time.  Filled my 1.5 qt corningware perfectly, even with the reduced cream cheese and sour cream.

Very good! Unless you like a mostly cheesy dip with little veggies in it, I highly recommend either doubling the spinach/artichokes, or halving the sour cream/cream cheese. I halve the sour cream and cream cheese, and it always makes LOTS, with just enough spinach and artichokes on each bite. I like to scoop it into a baking dish and melt some cheese on the top in the oven as well. Always a hit where ever I bring it.

This is a great recipe. I modified only by using 1 pkg of cream cheese and 1 container of sour cream. I left everything else the same. I cooked over the stove which was a great idea and quick. I cooked garlic into it and also added some garlic salt and pepper. Was a hit.

This recipe was a big hit at our Christmas party at work.  The only modifications I made were adding a couple of minced cloves of garlic to the melted butter, cut the sour cream in half, and added another package of spinach.  Thanks CindyJ60!

I did not care for this recipe.  Plus, this recipe serves about 100, so if you're having a small dinner party, you'll have a ton left over, even if you only make a half recipe.    Some people were really drawn to this dip, though, and seemed to thoroughly enjoy it.  It may work for an "extended appetizer" situation, like a superbowl party better than a dinner party.

I. Love. This. Dip!  Super yummy!!  I especially love it with Town House crackers.  The first time I made it I only used half the Sour Cream and it still turned out great.

I made this recipe for a potluck that my husband had to go to and I had to work. When I asked how it turned out, he said that he didn't know, because it went SO fast that he didn't get to try it. I was stopped for weeks, by people I didn't even know and asked, "Did you make the spinach dip for the party?" Now I have to make it for EVERY party they have. Of course I have to TRIPLE the recipe because it goes so quickly.Plus people end up taking some home with them! I did make some changes as well. The fresh garlic is a MUST, plus extra spinach and FRESH shreeded MIXED italian cheese. And for some added color, I sprinkle chopped red pepper on top. Then serve with mini slices of garlic artisan bread! YUM!

I cannot count how many times I've made this recipe!  It is a hit everytime I make it... although I do make some changes. Fat free Sour Cream, Reduced Fat Parmesan, Neufchatel Cheese, 2 tbsp. butter & 1-2 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil.  I sautee 2 cloves garlic with the butter & olive oil and add the rest.  I half the cream cheese and sour cream as well.  I've chopped roma tomatoes on to as well and that's always nice for color.  The last time I brought this to a bridal shower, I made double this recipe and my bowl was LITERALLY scraped clean within 30 minutes!

I too added twice the spinach, and twice the artichoke hearts, and used my crockpot. We noticed it needed something after hours of cooking on low heat, my husband added more butter to it, and it got really creamy and the taste finally got there!!! We took the dip with tortilla chips to a friends house on New Years Eve and it was a hit!  Thanks!

This is the best spinach dip recipe ever.  I made it at Thanskgiving and this was the only dish aside from the turkey that there were no leftovers for me to snack on the next day!  I did add more spinach as others suggested, not so much to cut the creaminess (what's "too creamy"?) , but to add "veggibility."

This is a great recipe!  I did cut the cream cheese and sour cream in half and added minced garlic to the butter before adding the spinach and artichoke hearts.  I also cooked it in a mini crockpot to keep it warm for the party we held.  Definately something I'll make again.  Thanks!

This dip was amazing!  It was so easy and quick to make, and the response from my fiancee (who is a huge spinach lover) almost made me blush!  I did as the other reviewers suggested and used less of the cream cheese and sour cream and more of the spinach and artichokes, and it came out to be better than the dips that we've tried at restaurants.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow - my husband and I both really liked this recipe!  I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and used twice as much of the artichokes and spinach.  I'm glad I did, otherwise there would have been too much creamy stuff.  Note that this makes a TON of dip - even half the recipe lasted us for three nights plus I gave some to our neighbors.  We dipped both tortilla chips and cut up Italian bread in it.  Delicious!

This recipe is fantastic.  It does not use any mayonaise which is great for those who want their rich and creamy without the mayo flavor.  It was the rave of the party.

This is the most fantastic way to make a great tasting spinach artichoke dip!  Quick, easy and you can't go wrong if you add a little extra parmesan cheese!!!  I made it for a meeting and everyone demanded to have the recipie!  Great job Cindi!  Try it in a hollowed out sourdough bread-round, it's the best.

Great recipe with some adjustments for my preferences & tips from other reviewers. I did use half the cream cheese & sour cream with a 16 oz bag frozen spinach and olive oil instead of butter. I added 5 cloves of fresh minced garlic, 1 finely chopped jalapeno (seeds removed) and about 3/4 cup chopped red onion, all of which I sauteed in the olive oil with some thyme, parsley and paprika before adding 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice & artichokes then spinach. The result was outstanding. This dip goes well with pita chips, tortilla chips, crackers, vegetables and who knows what else. Mmm... Yummy!

We loved this! Used 2 pkg cream cheese, 1 16 oz ctn sour cream, 1 pkg frozen spinach, 2 cans of artichokes.  Sauteed some onion and garlic on stove first before adding spinach and artichokes, and did not use the garlic salt. Very yummy, even spread some leftovers on pizza crust later on and it was really good that way. Could probably bake it if you wanted to.

Followed advice of others and added garlic to butter and doubles the spinach/artichokes. Also added some pimento cheese. I poured it into a over-safe dish and reheated at 350 for 10 minutes at a friend's house.  It was a HIT!

Like the other reviews I only used one package of cream cheese and only one package of sour cream and it's perfect! It still comes out very creamy and cheesy but with more spinach and artichoke flavor (also a more manageable amount). Although be warned that the recipe still makes quite a bit. It was a great hit with the family on xmas.

I made this as written (except for draining a bit of the water off the spinach), and it was very good. Next time I'll double the spinach though.

I made this dip for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  In reading over the other reviews, I did the following:   2 tablespoons of butter and I sauteed one small onion and a clove of garlic; 1 package each of the cream cheese and sour cream.   I actually assembled it the night before.  The next day, I put it in a casserole dish and added more cheese on top.   It turned out really well.

this is 4 stars cos it needs a little tweaking but it is REALLY good. im glad i read other reviews first and ended up going with many others and cut down to just 1 container sour cream (i still did 2 cream cheeses though). i sauteed garlic in with the butter and added about a half cup of chopped onion as well. i added some pepper and next time i will add either more artichokes or another kind of cheese to the parmesan. i think it would be a little bland if you stick to the recipe. but it is a really good base recipe to change around to fit your preferences, thanks!

I make this recipe for every gathering I attend.  It is the best, don't change a thing.  It is different than the typical mayo artichoke dip that most make.  People rave about this and constantly ask me for the recipe!   THANKS CINDYJ60!

MMM MMM Good! We used asiago, parmesan, and crumbled blue cheese in addition to the cream cheese.  The asiago was quite salty, so if I make this in the future, I will definitely reduce the amount of asiago or pick another cheese altogether.  I made this with fresh artichoke hearts and spinach I picked up at my local co-op, threw everything in the Crockpot and served it at a party with vegetables and artisan garlic bread.  It was a big hit.  We froze the leftovers and rewarmed them in the oven a week later.  It was just as good the second time!

Great base recipe! I used 1 container of sour cream and 1.5 pkg, of cream cheese.  Plus sauteed garlic with the butter (Gives this the flavor that it desperately needs!) Got asked by at least 5 people for the recipe!!! Quick & easy app.

I'm a cook on a budget and this recipe was great! I cut the amount of sour cream and cream cheese in half but other than that, I made it the same (and with all generic brands!) :P I got a lot of compliments!

Gave it 4 stars because I do a bunch of tweaking.  But it is a great base recipe. I followed several suggestions by others(more garlic, more spinach, romano cheese as well as parmesean.)  I have made this several times.  I absolutely LOVE IT!

I gave this four stars only because I had to modify it so much.  I cut the recipe in half and then used 2Tbs butter, whole package of spinach, whole can of artichokes, 3 cloves garlic, 3/4 8oz package cream cheese, and about 10oz of sour cream.  I sauteed the garlic, spinach, and artichokes together then added the soft ingredients and cooked as directed.  I also melted the Parmesan on top.  Better than what you get in a restaurant.

I made it with fat-free cream cheese and sour cream and it still tasted great!  Also I shredded mozzerella on the top and broiled it in the oven for a nice crispy and cheesey top.

I used half the amount of cream cheese and sour cream, and it was still enough as an hors d'oeuvre for 10.  Also added juice from one small lemon, as suggested by another reviewer.  Used half the amount of parmesean and made the rest up with chevre.  Served in a large, hollowed out loaf of rye bread.

Awesome I saute the fresh garlic in the butter and I add a variety of white cheeses. Then when its all mixed well on the stove I pour it in a baking dish and cover the top with Parmesan Cheese and bake it till it bubbles right before it is time to serve. It makes it great.!!

Delicious! So flexible. I was looking for a recipe without mayo (ew), and this is the best one I could find. I omitted all of the sour cream, and added way more garlic than called for to counteract the cream cheese. I also added lemon juice and freshly ground black pepper.

Yummy!  This has a great taste!  Like some others, I started out with the basic recipe, then made some changes.  I added some lemon juice, and I love spinach and artichokes, so I only used one package of cream cheese and one container of sour cream.  I also added some minced garlic to the melted butter.  Delicious!  I put this inside of the "Bread Bowls I" recipe from this site, and it was really good.

This recipe is good but if you want to make it better, double the spinach, 1/2 the recipe, double the artichoke, add more cheese (feta is yummy), a little tabasco, a little lemon juice and some extra seasoning salt! I like that you don't have to bake it, the stovetop makes it easy!

I thought this was good after I played with the ingredients a little, but at first it was kind of bland. I cut the recipe in half to begin with, sautéed the butter with a teaspoon of garlic and used half the sour cream and cream cheese like others suggested. I had to add a ton of pepper, salt, spicy seasoning, garlic salt and some extra parmesan cheese before it tasted unique . The consistency seemed right in the pan, but then I put it all in a crock pot and took it to a party. After a few hours it become very thick and kinda stuck together. I think next time I’ll use the full serving of cream cheese and sour cream like the original recipes states, add some more garlic in the beginning, plus try some chopped onion and additional Italian cheeses. Overall I think this recipe is a good starting point for beginner cooks like me,  but be prepared to tweak it to please your taste buds.

This recipe turned out so good that I just like to eat it with a spoon!  The flavors meld together really well, and the texture is perfect.  It was so simple and easy to make, and took very little time at all, perfect for those of us with a busy schedule.

I liked this recipe, except I took everyone's suggestion and halved the cream cheese and sour cream, along with adding more spinach. I also love more flavor, so I added 1/2 an onion and 3 fresh minced garlic cloves. In addition, I added 1/2 a tomato. Instead of parmesan cheese, I put 1/4 cup mozz cheese. Salt and pepper to taste. Hope this helps everyone!

I've used many different recipes for this in the past and this is the only one I use now. Cooking it on the stove top makes it much quicker to prepare. I also double the spinach & artichokes as suggested and I add a bit of minced garlic too. Served with cut celery and sliced sourdough = YUMMY!

I followed the suggestions from previous reviewers and cut the cream cheese and sour cream in half. This was fantastic, however it was difficult to keep warm in the crockpot without burning.  This dip must be served warm for the best flavor. Great with pita chips.

I used twice the amount of spinach and 1/2 the amount of cream cheese.  I also used only 1 cup of sour cream, added some fresh garlic, and a small amount of red pepper flakes.  It was delicious & a huge hit!!  Everyone loved this recipe the first time I made it using the original recipe and also loved the more spinach-based version that I have made since.

I got a ton of compliments on this.  However, as I'd read the reviews, I had extra artichoke hearts and spinach on hand, and ended up using 2 cans of artichokes and 3 packages of spinach with the suggested amount of cream cheese, parmesean and sour cream.  Do note that this is currently set for 56 servings, so you'll want to cut that back unless you are having a huge party or not that many dishes.  
I was thrilled that this was SO easy to make and required very few ingredients.

This was excellent! Quick and easy, and I used it to top little puff pastry cases. Instead of adding garlic salt, I used garlic and herb cream cheese, and I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.

A+! I've worked in the food industry for years and this is easily comparable to the best spinach dips I've ever had! I did, however add twice the amount of spianach and artichokes than the recipe called for. I like mine to have lots. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I took the advice of others and halved the sour cream and cream cheese for this recipe.  I also used light versions of both those ingredients.  I also used 2 small fresh garlic cloves (chopped) instead of the garlic salt.  It turned out fabulous!  All my guests said it tasted just as good as the restaurant versions.  Definitely a keeper!

I should've heeded the warnings of the other reviewers and left out one pack of creme cheese and one tub of sour cream.  It was WAY too much!  All I could taste was the sour cream.  If I do decide to make this again, I'll definitely 1/2 the ingredients!

AWESOME...made it for a birthday party and drove the "dieters" crazy. Next time I will try and lighten this up and see how goes. OH, also, next time I think I will serve this in a crock pot because it tastes SOOOOO much better warm.

This was okay... It was a little bland, but the crowd seemed to like it.

My sister and mother loved the dip, I felt like something was missing. I may try this recipe once more, as well as continue looking. Not a bad recipe, just not what I was looking for.

LOVE this recipe!  I make it about once a week, we eat it for lunch!  It is so good.  I did make two changes to make it easier, I mix use minced garlic  and I just mix all the ingredients together and heat it in the oven!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I modified it somewhat and it turned out great!  I'll definitely make this a lot as spinach is the only veggie my 2 y.o. will eat.  

I made it without the sour cream, with ~3 oz extra spinach and ~ half the shredded cheese.  It was still a bit too rich.  Next time I will cut 1/3 of the cream cheese also.

Very good and very easy!!  Made this as an appetizer to a dinner I made for my parents and my mom couldn't stop eating it!  I halved the recipe and still have leftovers but it's still great reheated in the microwave.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  I added marinated artichoke hearts, and that really added a zip to the flavor.  It went over well with my family.  I will definately make this recipe again.

I used 24 oz frozen spinach and 2 cans of artichoke hearts. I also added 6 cloves of minced garlic to the butter and cooked a few minutes before adding the spinach and chopped artichoke hearts.Left out the garlic powder. I made this for a pot luck. Even though it made a large amount I can hardly bear to part with it. Wonderful!

I made so many changes I'm tempted to write a new recipe!! I made every change that I read by other reviewers. Half a lemon, black pepper, onions, cut the sour cream in half and doubled the artichokes.  What brought this to a new level was when I went across the street to Chipotle to grab some black pepper, I was inspired to grab some of their chipotle tobacco sauce. Unbelievably good.  Add the chipotle tabasco sauce and thank me later.

This recipe is very basic- I wouldn't call it bland, but it is certainly missing something.  Next time I will use less sour cream and more cream cheese, not to mention all the add-ins that others have mentioned- onion, fresh garlic, ect.

I hate to leave a review when I've changed ingredients/amts, but this was a fantastic recipe so I felt like I needed to!  I halved the cream cheese and sour cream, sauteed one garlic clove with the spinach, and left out the artichokes (didn't have any).  My whole family loved it - it tasted very similar (only better!) to a frozen TGIF version that we get at the grocery store.  The best part is that it was made with ingredients that I always have on hand so it can be made on the fly for unexpected company.

This dip is fantastic! And definitely the best spinach/artichoke dip that I have ever made. I cut the recipe in half, which worked out perfectly. I noticed that some reviewers said that it was a little too cream cheese-y, and for me it seemed like the cream cheese clumped up just a little bit and that's when it tasted too much like cream cheese. Maybe I should have let the cream cheese melt just a little bit more. It was still great though. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good. I like others sauted lots of garlic, approx. 5 cloves first and only added one container of sour cream. Salt, pepper, and some onion powder were good additions. It would be great with some romano cheese in the mix as well!

The hubs says this is the best spin dip ever! 4 stars due to the following mods:added half a yellow pepper and 2 cloves garlic with the butter, subbed half the sour cream for mayo, subbed half the parm for mozz, added a couple splashes of worcestshire. This one's a keeper!

Double Yum. I used 2 pkgs chopped frozen spinach, 2 cans of quartered artichokes, 3 pkgs of cream cheese, 1 sour cream, and added 1 cup parm cheese, 1 cup shredded mozz, and some lemon juice and cayenne pepper and lots of garlic.  Delicious hot or cold right from the fridge! I thought it was best with tortilla chips as a warm dip; when we ate it cold it was good with some of those new pretzel cracker things! Four stars only because I had to modify it.  Also makes a good pasta sauce if you add a little extra parm cheese to it.

No wonder everyone loves this dip! 1/4 cup of butter, 2 containers of sour cream and two of cream cheese. Although it was very good, considering how unhealthy it is, I wouldn't make it again. It's delicious, but its also fat and calories disguised as vegetables.

accidentally made way too much of this (servings were set for 56 people instead of the 12 that I needed). It tasted really good and was very light and creamy. I used the whipped cream cheese instead of the block. it was very good the next day as well. I think next time I just might add a little lemon zest at the end.

This is amazing.  I get so many compliments when I make it.  The only changes I make are using fresh minced garlic. I add it when I'm sauteing the artichokes.  Also, I double the amount of spinach and artichokes. I like it thicker.  Everyone raves about this recipe and requests that I bring it.

Very Good! However, it is very thick. I cut the recipe in half, but in the future I will use the entire can of artichoke (can). I can definitely taste the parmesan cheese [which is good],but perhaps I will add another type of shredded cheese in the future! That should change the texture a little bit. Haven't "served" it yet, but I'm sure it'll be a hit:)

Great!  Simple to make and easy to tweak to your own preferences.  I cut the recipe in half.  I used twice the amount of artichoke hearts, half the amount of sour cream, half the amount of cheese total (1/2 cheap Kraft parmesan and 1/2 higher quality romano shredded), added about a tablespoon of minced garlic and four green onions, and no salt.  I like it with saltines or garlic bagel chips.  Go for it!  You can mess around with it until it tastes the way you want it to.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this dip many times before but never for the women that I work with. I took this to work today for a potluck that we had and they all loved it. I cut the recipe in half which was a big mistake because it was gone within 10 mins. One of the birthday girls loved it so much that I making it for her again tonight so she can have it over the weekend.

I've made this recipie twice now and I've gotten rave reviews both times.  The second time it seems I misplaced my can of artichokes so I made it without it, turned out well, but not as special as the first time.  The only complaint I had with this recipie is it seems I needed to add more salt, for my liking.  Though no one else that enjoyed it had this issue at the potluck.    Will definately make this recipie again.

I make this every time I have a gathering. The recipe is always requested.  Serve it with Triscuits, veggies, or any snack cracker. I always use the Progresso Marinated Artichokes if I can get them.  They have a great flavor.

I think this recipe is an ok base, but it has a long way to go. I thought it was very bland, and the consistancy is too creamy, and not cheesy at all. Even after adding chopped garlic, double artichoke hearts, sea salt and lemon and cutting the sour cream and cream cheese by half, it it still bland. I'm glad that this is a stove top vresion, because that means it will be easy to play with tomorrow. I'm going to try adding more garlic, salt and shredded cheese then bake it so that it is melty and cheesy instead of just tasting like sour cream on top of spinach. I really think that these types of recipes need to bake to mix the flavors properly.

Very good. I didn't use garlic salt but did use about 3 cloves of garlic and probably a good teaspoonful of salt. I think I agree that the sour cream needs to be cut in have.  Lastly this does make a LOT so plan accordingly. Consider the amount of sour cream and cream cheese. If I had to guess, you end up with about 6 cups of dip at least.

Big hit at our superbowl party. We are watching our weight so we used fat free cream cheese and fat free sour cream. It was delicious and no one else new it was a light version. Love that you can make it on the stovetop, much more convenient!

I made this for a party and it was all devoured. I actually have to make it again this weekend. I decreased the amount of sour cream to only one container, but other than that it was perfect.

With a few alterations as suggested by other reviews, this is a great recipe.  As suggested, I sauted several cloves of garlic and a few tablespoons of onion in the butter.  I also added only half the sour cream; with the full amount, I think you would need more spinach and artichokes.  The suggestion to add lemon juice really made the difference in the taste too!  I love the fact that this is made on the stove top instead of baked; it's much more convenient and time-saving!

So delicious!  I've made this recipe a couple of times before, substituting shredded mozzerella for the parmesan, and that was good, but it's even better with the parm!  I shouldn't have changed that, haha!  I also halved the sour cream and cream cheese, added a couple of gloves of garlic to the butter, and used Barefooting's suggestion of lemon juice - that really does make the recipe.  Even though I changed it a bit, it'd still be a five-star recipe in my opinion.

I made this Christmas Eve and took it to my sisters. Everyone LOVED it!! I made a few changes - used 2 packages of spinach-I put them in the microwave for a few seconds then put the spinach in a strainer and drained alot of the water. used only 1 and a half cartons of sour cream and also used 2 cans of artichokes and lots of garlic. I'm making it again tonight. Happy New Year

What isn't great about this dip?  I used no-fat sour cream and lowfat cream cheese.  It was quick to make & there were many compliments about how great it tasted!

This is a great recipe.  I took the advice of some of the others, and did the following:  We added garlic to the butter before adding the veggies; we used half the cream cheese and half sour cream.  Unfortunately, we didn't have an entire cup of Parm (we only had about 1/4 to 1/3), but it still turned out great!  I can imagine how much better it would have been if we had the entire cup of Parm!!

I really like this recipe, it was very easy, but I did make some changes after reading some other reviews.  I only used one package of cream cheese and one package of sour cream.  I did use the garlic powder as mentioned in the recipe, but I think next time it will be better to mince garlic and cook it in the beginning.  Everyone at my party loved this dip!

This was great, though I too sauteed fresh minced garlic in butter before adding the spinach and artichoke, used light sour cream, and added cayenne pepper.  It's just so much more tasty with a little kick.  Everyone at my Bible study group loved it!

I took the recommendations from others and sauteed the garlic gloves in butter. I also doubled the spinach and artichokes. It was a little too creamy before I doubled the spinach. Even my kids loved this recipe. My son (he's 6 years old!) says it's better than at the restaurants!! A keeper!

I made it tonight and it was a big hit. I used the recipe as written, but with the 4 garlic cloves sauteed in butter rather than garlic salt. I also substituted mozzarella for parmesan, mostly because I was out of parmesan. It was really, really good. And I'm picky.

this recipe was great! The stovetop style makes it quick and easy with hardly any clean up! I also cut the sour cream and cream cheese in half. I also added a bit of chili powder for flavor and substituted parmesan for  mozzarella cheese. Absolutely wonderful! All my friends love it!

I made this last weekend and it was a big hit!  I made a few changes, as suggested by other reviewers.  I halved the recipe (except I used a whole can of artichokes).  I sauteed 2 cloves of minced garlic in the butter for an extra kick.  I also added some lemon juice at the end.  I was quite surprised how well it held up on the stovetop (on low)--I made it earlier than I should have--but it didn't get clumpy or burn to the pan. Great recipe, Cindy!

I made this for an open house party and kept it in a mini crock pot--it was a hit!  I served it w/ baked tostitos scoops and plain melba toast.  I also used everything I could to make it lighter in fat and calories--still tasted great!  
I made a half batch, but still used the same amount of artichokes and spinach w/ a tiny bit more garlic salt than what the recipe calls for.

Getting great reviews on this one. Was a big hit with my husband! Used the slow cooker idea to keep it warm during the football game (great suggestion). I used one jar marinated and one jar plain artichoke hearts. Makes way too much for a small party but is easily frozen into smaller portions and reheated in crock pot. Will be making again soon for our next party.

When ever I have people over.  They request this.  If I don't make it they get a little upset.  There is never any left over.  I heat it on the stove and then put it in my crock-pot.

Good.  Not excellent, but good.  I thought there was way too much sour cream, so I only used about half.  I also didn't think it was cheesy enough, so I added a little mozzarella (1/4 to 1/2 cup).

This recipe makes A LOT! Except for using half the sour cream and cream cheese, I followed the recipe as listed. I did not find this to be very satisfying. The flavor I was looking for wasn't shining through. It was very thick and tasted too much like cream cheese. I find it hard to believe that 150+ people are wrong so I'll chalk it up to my own error somewhere. Either way, I don't plan on trying this one again.

INCREDIBLE. Only gave the recipe four stars because I used reccomendations from other posting about using half the sour cream and cream cheese. Still made a ton but came out thicker and tastier. I served it with bagel chips, triscuits, and french bread. Nothing was left! This was very quick to make and I will definitely add it to my favorites.

This recipe was good, but I liked it much better after I substituted olive oil for the butter and used an herbed soft cheese instead of the cream cheese.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I use it for almost every cocktail party I have. I just add a 1/2 package more spinach, 1/2 can more artichokes, red pepper flakes to taste and 1/2 a onion.

I made this dip for New Year's Day Dinner and it was well recieved. After reading the reviews, I halved the cream cheese and sour cream and thought it was still very creamy. I made it on the stove top and then transferred it to a crcok pot. I think that next time I would include lots of garlic.

This was very, very good! I made it to go with our Christmas dinner instead of creamed spinach and everyone loved it. I took other's advice and only used 1 package of cream cheese and only 1 container of sour cream and it was still very cheesy and creamy. I will definitly make it again, halving the sour cream and cream cheese again, and probably adding another box of frozen spinach. It was great!

I liked the dip, but cut back on the sour cream and ended up using 3 packages of frozen spinach!  I also added some lemon juice and fresh pepper and sauteed some garlic in the butter instead of using the garlic salt.  It made enough for me to freeze two medium sized portions for future gatherings, so I did like that aspect.

This was so fast and easy to make. It was very good but best when served warm.  I took it to a Christmas party last night in a bread  bowl and by the we ate, it had cool off and wasn't as good as when I was cooking it.
I will make this again soon and next time after cooking on the stove I plan on taking it in a fondue to keep it warm.  Thanks for another great recipe.

This did, as many others have said, make a whole lot of dip. I eliminated one of the sour creams and added a lot of spices for flavor.  Spices included: salt, "spicy salt", fresh garlic, garlic salt, and the seasoning of a chicken boullion cube.  Perfect after the additions!

Tastes fine, but I made so many changes, I don't know if it even the same recipe.  Halved sour cream and cream cheese, added minced garlic, and shredded parmesan, mozarrella, asiago cheese.

Way too much dip! This will make 2 huge bowls of dip, definitely cut the recipe in half for just one bowl, and it will be enough. (or cut out 1 cream cheese and 1 sour cream)Too much sour cream and/or cream cheese, it made the flavor so bland you cant even taste the spinach or artichokes! I saved it by adding kosher salt and about 5 sauteed garlic cloves. DEFINITELY needed the fresh garlic! My guests loved it, I thought it was just OK. I will be trying another recipe for this instead of making this one again

I love this recipe. I used it and put the mixture in won ton wrappers and brought the ends together so they looked like a basket. Baked in oven for about 15 min at 375. It was delicious. I brought this to a party and all were gone very quickly! They all asked for the recipe. Thank you for this recipe.

Excellent recipe!!  I followed previous suggestions and only used 1/2 the cream cheese and sour cream; this makes a great consistancy.  Also, I used 1/2 cup grated parmesan and 1/2 cup grated romano for added flavor.  I served in a small crock pot since it gets cold quickly and the flavor is much better warm!  Thanks for this new family favorite!!

Very tasty - I will be making this again.  I was hoping it would taste like the artichoke dip at my fave restaurant and it absolutely did!  Only as others warned, you need only HALF the sour cream and HALF the cream cheese called for.  It is rich just like that and I think a good ratio of greens to cheese.

I agree, this is a GREAT dip. But, after reading other reviews I made the following changes: 1/8 cup of butter, sauteeded fresh garlic (3 cloves, minced)in the butter before adding spinich and artichokes; only used 1 (low fat) cream cheese and 1 (low fat) sour cream. Otherwise I think you need two packages of spinich. HUGE HIT at my football gathering. Served with Doritos "GOLD" chips. It gets very thick after cooling but I just reheat with a little splash of milk and it works great. My boyfriend eats it cold, right out of the 'frig. I liked making in on the stovetop instead of baking in the oven. This is now one of my regulars.

I would recommend some sassier cheeses... fontinella, gouda, romano, etc.  The recipe calls for too much background and not enough feature.  I agree with others; too heavy on the cream cheese and sour cream.  My guests ate it, though.  It wasn't a bad recipe... a great place to start.

This was an excellent recipe! It did make a lot of dip though, but it was really good. I will be making this again in the future!

This was excellent, very simple, and easier to make than most spinach dips because it's not baked.  Everyone at our card game loved it, both in a bread bowl and with tortilla chips.

Very, very good! I bought a couple of round loafs of bread, scooped out the middle and served it inside the bread bowls. It was the favorite snack at the party--everyone wanted the recipe!

Makes way too much and I only used half the recommended cream cheese & sour cream required. The flavor is little bland for my taste.  I added some sauted onion to give it a boost. I may make it again but with modifications.

made this as a pre-dinner appetizer.  served it with tortilla chips.  i added xtra parmesan cheese, and topped it with a jack/cheddar combo, and popped the whole thing in the oven to brown the top.  the kids scarfed it down, and didnt want to eat anything else!  a definite winner.  easy and delicious.

This recipe is very good! I am always asked to make it over and over again for my family and friends!  They absolutely LOVE this dip!  I am known as the best "artichoke spinach dip" maker thanks to this recipe! =)

This is so much creamier and easier than other recipes! I only had half the sour cream it called for, so I added 1/4 cup french onion dip, and lots of garlic powder. Can't wait to taste the leftovers.

The only problem with this recipe is I have to
make atleast a double batch every time! 
There hasn't been one person who hasn't LOVED
them. A sure winner everytime.

Pretty good and very easy. I only used half the sour cream and cream cheese and it still made a lot. I still used the amount of spinach and artichokes called for. I liked it with quite a bit of garlic and parmesean.

This was okay. I was a little disappointed in the taste. I wish it was not quite so bland. It is definitely very rich. I think I will keep searching.

I made this using the full amount of ingredients.  I did add 1-1/2 tsps coarse black bepper as well as this amazing https://www.manitoutrading.com/herbs-spices-3/truffle-parmesan-amp-black-garlic-seasoning?rq=truffle.  

I was NOT disappointed.  It's delicious hot AND cold.   A nice French baguette and a glass of wine. . . yummy dinner!!

Good dip except that I tasted sour cream.  To mask that, I added garlic. Yum.  Will make again cutting back on the sour cream as some viewers suggested.

I am a spinach and artichoke dip lover and I was on the hunt for a good recipe I can make at home. I have made this twice and I love it - it is very creamy which I was skeptical about but I love it. I use less sour cream (only about 8oz) because I don't really like sour cream. I also add more cheese - I didn't actually measure how much I used but I used a handful of parmesean, romano, and mozzarella cheese. Delicious!!

I used this recipe as the basis for the dip, and it turned out rather tasty and satisfying.  I know some people follow recipes to the letter, but I always modify recipes to my preferred taste. For example, I sauteed 1 cup fresh, chopped spinach with 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1/4 cup chopped yellow onions, 2 chopped scallions, and 1/2 cup chopped California style marinated artichoke hearts (comes in a jar) in butter for about 8-10 minutes on med/low heat. Then, I added 1 and 1/2 pkgs of softened Neufchâtel cheese, 2 tbsp low-fat Greek yogurt,  1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, and 1 tsp salt. I found it was rather lumpy and thick, so I slowly added 1/2 cup low-fat milk and stirred occasionally  for about 15 minutes. I served it warm alongside Milton's multi-grain baked crackers. It was a hit! I plan to use this recipe again and try it with other ingredients like extra cheddar and mozzarella cheeses, jalapenos, black olives, cayenne pepper, and chopped water chestnuts.

I dont know why anyone would not like this delicious recipe!  I cut the cream cheese by using a half a 8oz pack, and 1 whole one, and half the sour cream. I also threw some mozzerella cheese in there while it was cooking, and it was amazing without the sour cream! taste restaurant worthy to me served hot with melted mozzerella on top with some tortilla chips. Everything else I kept the same, and im glad I did because I think it would have been over seasoned any other way. Thank you for my first homemade version of the recipe.

I have made this twice now.  I used fresh garlic sauté in the butter.    I followed the recipes the first time and gave dip to any body who like it.  I froze two pints and had them a month later and they where great .  The second time I was making for 100 people and doubled it.   I made three different dips and this was the one that was gone.   I don't measure a lot so the amount of spinach and artichoke  was  like the whole bag and the whole jar.   I served with fresh French bread chucks. .

I was so supervised when I tasted this. I made this for someone who wanted this sort of dip, expecting that I wouldn't like this but I tried it and I loved this. I was so supervised because I dislike spinach, sour cream, and artichoke but all of them together(plus some extra seasonings) was terrific

We voted it a solid 4 stars as written.  Next time more artichokes and spinach,  less sour cream. Flavor was great,  after all it says garlic salt to taste! If it's too bland,  add a little more!

Took this to a church event and my husband and many others were singing it's praises. I only used 1 sour cream and 1 cream cheese after reading other reviews and the ratio was great!! Going to make it again this weekend for a Super Bowl party!

Great dip.  Agree with the reviewer who said to double up on the artichoke and spinach and reduce the creams.  I also added one other ingredient as a topper.  Cheddar cheese.  Perfecto!

I used the same substitutions as other reviewers and doubled the artichokes and added lemon juice. Other than that I followed the recipe given. I've made this many times and found that using real grated Parmesan makes all the difference in the world! The first time I made it I used the grated Parmesan in the can (like you would put on spaghetti) and it was OK. But the next time I used real grated cheese and it was a thousand times better! It's easy to transfer into a crockpot and take to functions too. It's always a hit and I have had several requests for the recipe. YUM!!

This was a big hit with even the kids! My only regret is not doubling the recipe. I used mozzarella instead of parmigiana and voila! A warm cheesey dip from heaven.

Good recipe! Very easy to follow. I only made half the recipe so it'll fit in the Little Dipper. It made a little more than the container still:) The cream cheese flavor is strong so I'll use it less next time.  And to suit my taste I'll add more artichoke. I did add lemon juice and it gave the tanginess I needed so thank you for the review! I'll make it again??

I will definitely be making this again! This was a huge hit with my husband, a cheese fiend. However I do think if sour cream and cream cheese is double there should be at least another half pack of spinach...

Loved this recipe; however there are a ton of people who don't like spinach and/or artichokes so you have to know your audience. They won't even try it.

I did modify this recipe, but what we ended up with was delicious!  My fiance said it tasted like something you would order in a restaurant.  I only had half a block of cream cheese, so I scaled down the recipe to reflect that.  I didn't have any artichokes on hand, so instead I increased the spinach amount and also added about 2.5 chopped green onions (the remaining part of the onion I sprinkled on top of the pizza we made).  As others suggested, I added some garlic in with the butter in the beginning, but I still added in some garlic salt because it's a stronger flavor.  Yummy!  It turned out cheesy and delicious, and the green onion complemented all the flavors!

I've barely taken this recipe off the stove for the first time, and I'm already reviewing it.  It's THAT good!  I halved the recipe from the get-go, but used an entire can of artichoke hearts to avoid waste.  I also sauteed two cloves worth of minced garlic in the butter before adding the spinach and artichoke mixture, and threw some Worcestershire sauce and a bit of salt in once all the other ingredients were in the saucepan.  Be sure to use a larger dish than you think will be necessary for this one; even halved, this recipe yields a fair amount.  I have a feeling that my dinner (Marie's Easy Slow Cooker Pot Roast - another good one from this site!) will be spoiled tonight thanks to this recipe.

This dip is so delicious! It's great for parties since it makes quite a bit. I melted the butter with fresh garlic (taken from another review) and I baked it in the oven. SUPERB taste & all of it went & I was asked for the recipe!

Perfect dip- although I did make adjustments. I cut the cream cheese and sour cream in half and also used a bit less spinach. Sauteed onions with the butter and also added a bit of lemon juice.  So delicious!

As written, I felt like this was off but with minor modifications, this dip is delicious. IMO it definitely needs double the amount of spinach called for if you plan to use all the cream cheese & sour cream, and fresh garlic, salt, and pepper versus garlic salt is the way to go. About 1C mozzarella cheese is also a nice addition. Add cayenne or hot sauce if you like it spicy. These variations receive rave reviews every time.

This is a fantastic recipe! Everyone always loves it at parties. I saute some minced garlic in the butter before the veggies because we love garlic, and I halve the cream cheese, sour cream and parmesan - we love the taste but frankly it makes too much and this way we have twice the veggies in the dip!

One word.... AWFUL. We started with going by the book.. When we wanted to spit it out immediately we added veggie soup mix, roasted red peppers, garlic, lemon juice and now we are desperately searching the cabinets for something else.  It's getting better but its not something I want to eat.  So disappointed.

I followed the recipe except I used 12 oz can artichoke hearts, 1 (8 oz) cream cheese softened, 1 (16 oz) sour cream. I would use less sour cream next time b/c it tasted too much like sour cream. It did LACK A LOT of flavor if you follow recipe as is. I sauteed 3 diced garlic cloves, added pepper & garlic salt, and it still was missing something! I decided to put a few drops of lemon juice like others have suggested and that really helped it. I think PESTO is what this recipe needed! I added a tablespoon. All these flavors came together nicely and everyone loved it at the party. Fed 20 people.

This recipe is wonderful. I made it for a party and it was a big hit.  I altered the recipe by using 2 ounces of butter (half the recommended amount) adding 1/4 tsp Mrs. Dash and a dash of black pepper.

I thought this recipe was good. I'm not a huge fan of dips with cream cheese and sour cream bc of the fat content, but I was in a pinch and needed something fast. I took some of the suggestions of the other reviewers cut the recipe in half.  Even half recipe makes a very large portion (enough for a group of 10 I'd say). I also sautéed garlic in the butter, added lemon juice, kosher salt. I added a couple splats of Tabasco, which didn't really add much to the flavor. It could have used more if you wanted a little more zing.  I recommend skipping the Worchestershire sauce that another reviewer suggested. The flavor didn't really mesh with the other flavors well.  Overall, it was easy to prepare, keeps well in the fridge and reheats easily.

WE LOVE IT!! It’s good, everyone love this one. We dipped it with tortilla chips or veggies. They are great for the party, the game or just the dinner. I have added a can of corn to it. It turned out pretty good too.

I took the advice of most and reduced the amount of sour cream and cream cheese and doubled the spinach and artichokes. I prepared it on the stove the day before and then on Thanksgiving I heated it up in the slow cooker. I just kept refilling a bowl set out for an appetizer. The hotter it got, the better it tasted. My whole family loved it!! I will be making it again for Christmas.
Update: I changed the amount of stars because I realized like many people were saying, that I technically changed the recipe. It is still a great recipe as a jumping off point. I love that it doesn't have mayonnaise, a lot that I find do.

I just finished making this and absolutely LOVE IT!!! I did follow some of the other user's suggestions and used less sour cream, about one and a half containers, and one 16oz bag of frozen chopped spinach.  I also sauteed 3 minced garlic cloves in with the butter.  I threw in a small handful of coarse kosher salt and a bit of ground black pepper. I can't wait to bring it to my boyfriend's thanksgiving tomorrow! :)

I made this for a friend's baby shower and it was a hit!  I added garlic, and halved the sour cream and cream cheese per other reviews, and it was perfect.  Even though only about 20 people showed up (40 were expected), I still came home with hardly any leftovers and lots of recipe requests!

I halfed the recipe as I didn't need enough for 56 people. I used fresh garlic, two cloves plus a dash of garlic powder. My family loves it! Next time I think I will use less cream cheese as I could still taste the cream cheese distinctively.

Made this as a movie snack and my whole family loved it! Great recipe, will keep this one.  I did follow a previous reviewers suggestion and sauteed 4 cloves of garlic and couple teaspoons of chopped onion in the butter and I only used 1 pkg cream cheese and one 16oz container of sour cream.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I found this recipe years ago ...i now know it by heart.It has become a tradition for the holidays for me to make the dip, and as much as the recipe makes it is gone very fast! It is the best dip we've had yet! Esp. great for those winter holidays because its a warm dip.

i took this to a bbq potluck and everyone loved it. i took the advice of the other reviewers and added some garlic (only one clove) to the butter while its melting. I didn't have that much sour cream on hand, so i used what i had which was about 5oz or less. I also used a parm/asiago blend which gave it some good flavor. I served it warm with french bread. its better warm for sure. yum!

I liked this recipe but I found the extra sour cream added gave it an overpowered taste.  I will make this again but reduce the sour cream by one.

Always a hit at parties. I get asked to make it often. Good with tortilla chips, pretzels, crackers, breadsticks, etc. This recipe makes A LOT, so cut it down if you don't need that much. Cutting it in half will still feed a party of 20-25. Delicious recipe.

This recipe is awesome!  I brought it to work for a covered dish lunch and it was gone quickly and everyone wants me to bring it in everytime we do a covered dish!  The only thing I changed is that I only use 1 pkg of cream cheese and 1 container of sour cream to fit into my little crock pot.

I halved the recipe. It came out so good!!! The best spinach artichoke dip I have had. Didn't have chips so I made some naan and cut it into small pieces to dip into it. This would be a great appetizer to serve for company.

This is the best artichoke spinach dip EVER!!! I have made this numerous times, and it is always asked for again. It is also great for parties because it makes a lot and you can make it ahead of time. I usually leave the remainder on the stove (low setting) so it is warm to serve as needed!

I made this dip for my New Year's Party using the suggested changes from the reviews and it was a huge hit. Gone quick! Everyone loved it so much that I just got asked to bring it to someone's super bowl party. I won't need to try another recipe for this anytime soon!

I make this pretty regularly... it's sooo good! I use a few garlic cloves instead of garlic salt and I always serve it in a pumpernickel round loaf with the torn bread bits for dipping. Yum!

Although this was really good and I took the advice of the previous reviewers, it was still a bit bland.  I did cut down the cream cheese and sour cream by half, added twice the amount spinach and atrichoke hearts, 1 tbsp. Worcestershire, 1 tsp black pepper and some Cayenne. Next time I might try adding water chestnuts and a finely minced jalapeno.  That should jazz it up a bit.

I've made this recipe multiple times and have followed the suggestions of cutting down on the sour cream.  I've also added garlic, mozzarella cheese and asiago cheese.  It's a great easy recipe that is delicious.

Got rave reviews and requests for recipe at a recent party. I added a little mozzarella cheese too. My new mantra, though, is when it says chop, it means throw it in the mini-prep!

Best spinach artichoke dip ever. I made this one because it did not include mayonnaise. To lighten the calorie load, I used fat free sour cream, low-fat cream cheese, and Promise heart healthy spread. I also doubled the spinach and artichoke. Tastes best warmed.

I loved this, but I did make some substitutions.   I only used one container each of (lowfat) Cream cheese and (lowfat) Sour cream and I used about 1/3 cup of Parmesan cheese and no butter.  It was absolutely delicious and a lot healthier than the original recipe- no one could tell it was a lower fat version.

I think this my new favorite spinach/artichoke dip recipe.  I made everything on the stove as directed, then transferred it to a crock pot so it would stay warm throughout the party (that's my biggest complaint w/ the oven baked dips... they cool off and harden).  Served w/ hawaiian bread, tortilla chips, carrots & celery. Everyone loved it!

This was so good. I added extra spinach and artichokes, sauteed garlic and onions in the butter, sprinkled some cayenne pepper for an extra kick and added a half bag of shredded Italian cheese blend to it. We've been eating it all week!

Delicious and easy - and makes a ton!  Even using half the cream cheese and sour cream called for, I had a good bit left over.  A few cloves of fresh garlic gave it some extra zip.

This is ALWAYS a crowd pleaser. As others have suggested, I also cut the sour cream and cream cheese in half and fresh minced garlic. This is always my party "go-to" recipe. Thank you so much for sharing.

I've made this receipe several times and the family loves it.  I add an extra 1/2 pkg of spinach and an extra can of artichoke hearts.  Other than that, it's easy, quick and perfect!  Thanks.

This dish was great. I loved it so much. it was creamy and perfect. I have had nothing but the best response from the people i have cooked it for.  and they are always requesting that i bring this dish to every party. i will be making it this weekend for my friends baby shower because she loves it so much. The only thing is i cut the amount of cream cheese and sour cream that i put in. if i were to put all of it in it would be too much. you just have to tweak it a bit to your liking. but it is a great one.

This was yummy.  My husband and I have been trying different dips for a while trying to find something like the restuarants.  This was very close.  I added garlic like lots had said and made a way smaller batch.  I know next time I'll make xtra to save.  MMmmm!!!

This is delicious! Such a hit at my party, and definitely serve warm - so much better. The only variation I might try is doubling the spinach (or halving the cream cheese/sour cream). Yum!

I love this recipe and have made it several times. I just recently realized that I'd never written a review for it, and thougth I probably should. 
I've made just a few minor changes. First, I use light cream cheese, and light sour cream. I substitute the parmesan cheese for really good quality motzza. I also add about 4 cloves of minced garlic. I love it with warm, home made french bread. Very yummy!

This was okay, the only thing was that despite my attempts to make it less creamy, I halved everything, I think it still was too creamy, and caution, it does make alot! However, the main idea was pretty good, I will proably try this again, just less ingridents.

WAY TOO MUCH DIP!!!! but it was very good! I accidentally bought creamed spinach but i used it anyway, so this dip was simply gooey goodness. I would recommend using hawaiian bread for dipping.

I prefer the spinach/artichoke dip with less cream cheese/sour cream.  However, I used the leftover dip on turkey/swiss/roma tomato/carmelized onion panini sandwiches, and it was a terrific addition.

The dip had a bland taste to it, I had to add more seasoning to bring it to a good savory taste.

This recipe was great and very tasty served warm in a crock pot. I only used half of the sour cream and cream cheese recommended and it turned about perfectly. I served it with tostitos "scoops" chips and everyone loved it.

This is a great dip!  I changed it slightly by only using 1 (16 oz) container of sour cream and increasing the parmesan cheese to 1 1/2 cups.  It's probably not as nutritious, but creamy and yummy!

Fantastic! I brought this to a Christmas Party and it was a hit! 
Instead of garlic salt, I added one clove of garlic to the butter in the skillet. I also grated parmesan cheese into the dip. I kept it warm in a crockpot and served it with tortilla chips. Makes a ton!

Fabulous hit! Makes a LARGE batch. I split it and took it to 2 parties. Tastes just as wonderful heated up. I thought it looked like it needed more spinach, but it tasted perfect as is. Easy and fast to prepare since it's all stove-top.

I accidentally bought marinated artichokes that smelled horrible, so I ended up not using them at all. However, with the spinach alone, this recipe was wonderful. I can't wait to try it again with fresh sauteed artichoke.

My friend found this recipe on Allrecipes and made it for us twice!  It is so easy and so yummy and so perfect for a crowd of people!  One of my grad school professors has us take turns bringing in snacks for the class; I made this dip and cut up some celery, carrots and broccoli and everything was GONE by the end of the class.  My boyfriend insisted that I leave some home for him. This recipe makes ALOT!

I made this for church, and it was a huge hit.  I also took it to a birthday party, and hardly any was left.  I added extra butter and it added just an extra taste to the finished product.  Also, I did some shots of hot sauce... and it was great!

I love this recipe. I did omit half of the cream cheese and sour cream. It would have been too creamy that way. Sauteed crushed garlic with the butter, also added some mozzerella. I will be making this again and again! Thanks for the recipe.

The dip is really good but I suggest doubling the artichoke hearts to make the ratio to the spinach a better balance. And cheese is good sprinkled on top too!

Can't rate this honestly as I did make some changes.    I sauteed 5 large cloves of garlic (minced) in the butter.  I also doubled the spinach and artichokes.  It was very good.  I imagine it would have been very sour cream-ey without doing that.  I think you at least need to double those 2 ingredients.  If you don't, at least cut the sour cream and cream cheese ingredients in half so it's got the right balance.

This was really good- I doubled the spinach this time, but next time I would triple the spinach- and add fresh garlic instead of garlic salt. It was just really creamy- and I like some substance in my dip. Everyone really loved it though.

Made for the Superbowl, everyone loved it.  It does make a lot, but it was also the first dip we ran out of.  To the reviewers who thought this was bland, did you add any garlic salt?  I can't imagine that...  This stole the show!!!

I personally did not like this dip.  It was too creamy for my taste.  I usually prefer more spinach anbd artichokes, and less creams.  

I made this dip for a party and someone else brought a spinach dip.  Everyone, inlcuding me, ate hers and didn't touch mine.  

But, I have to give it at least three stars because my husband, who enjoys cremy sauces, liked it.  So, it all depends on your tastes I suppose.

This is a great recipe and it's fairly easy to make.  I've taken it to a few family pot lucks now and everyone has liked it.  It really needs a lot of garlic salt to get the right flavor otherwise it tastes a little bland.  I usually serve this dip with slices of french bread, it seems to bring out the flavor better than when it's served with crackers.

This recipe is great. I left out the butter and the parmesan, and the dip was still wonderful.  The recipe makes a lot. I halved the cream cheese and sour cream to give a more spinachy taste. This dish is a big hit.
