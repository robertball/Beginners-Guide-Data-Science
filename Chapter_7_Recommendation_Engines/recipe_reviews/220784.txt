Wow, this was one tasty and impressive dish!  The cheese sauce is to die for!  I made the recipe as published with plenty of salt and white pepper to taste, and did add some crab meat to the filling.    I added about 10 minutes baking time on.  Make sure you use a large baking dish for this, my 9 x 13 only held 8 enchiladas, so I ended up using two and having to eye the sauce.  Oh, and make sure you butter or Pam the dish, mine stuck a bit.  Overall, it's a lot of prep and a time consuming recipe, but the result is soooooo worth it!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, bajathecat!

These were very good!  In spite of the Anaheim and the jalapeno, there was very little heat in this recipe, and I was thankful for that, because I didn't want to lose the delicate flavor of the seafood!  I used shrimp and crab meat, following the recipe exactly until the last garnish of tomato and green onion, because I was serving a salsa along with the enchiladas.  Beautiful cheese sauce, but very rich!  I used a 13 x 9 pan, and the recipe made 10 enchiladas for me.  I took Saveur's advice and sprayed the pan with cooking spray before baking.  This dish is company worthy!  Thanks!

I knew this recipe was a winner when I first saw it published. I used all shrimp, used the whole bell peppers, so I had lots more pepper mixture. I did use a 10X15 casserole dish. My cheese mixture seemed a bit soupy, and that may have been due to my extra peppers, but it thickened up just perfect in cooking. I forgot about the foil but it didn't burn and so I really didn't need it. Topped with the extra tomatoes, green onions and cilantro. Great dish for using up garden peppers, everyone loved it. Not even as rich as I thought it would be, but then again I had lots of veggies in this. Certainly will make this enchilada casserole again, you can use just about any seafood and not go wrong...and don't be shy on the vegetables, just use a large baking dish.

I don't think there is anything really wrong with the recipe but we didn't care for it too much. Even though I added more seasoning and garlic to the sauce it was pretty bland. It needed more cheese and a more flavorful cheese at that. I did add some parmesan but it needed much more. The tortillas got soggy which I was afraid of happening. Probably would do better not to cover them with foil while baking. The seafood and sauce would have been much better over pasta or even a seafood lasagna. I used shrimp and lump crab meat. We managed to eat this two nights in a row so it wouldn't go to waste but I will not be making this again.

WOW, this was DELICIOUS! I used a bit more of the red and green peppers than called for, and heavy cream in place of the 1/2&1/2 b/c I had some to use up, and I have better luck w/ it in cream sauces. Also, I didn't have an Anaheim pepper, so I had to omit that, but I did use the jalapeno (seeded), and the cayenne. Oh, I only had regular oregano, so I went w/ it, and a mix of shrimp, scallops and crab...great combo! I would make this again, for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

The sauce alone is to die for. Naturally, I can't just leave a recipe alone. Besides, I didn't have everything it called for. I skipped all the peppers (hubby has heartburn issues with them) and used fresh cilantro instead of oregano. I also used small, pre-cooked shrimp and 2 packages of lobster claw meat---scallops would've made it even better, but they're rather spendy. The only thing I did different to the sauce was add some Adobo, and I think it made it even better. There's a Mexican restaurant nearby that serves enchiladas almost identical to these and I always order them. Thanks to BAJATHECAT I can make my own now!

It was really good. I didn't use the sour cream and it was still good. My daughter who is very picky said she loved it. So thats all I need to rate it a 5

Made this recipe as directed, except I left out the minced Jalapeno .  It was delicious, but I will consider adding in the jalapeno or some type of pepper next time!

I'll make it again. Pretty much followed the recipe...though I usually spice (Cayenne) things up a bit more than called for. Used Half & Half which worked fine. Crab, Prawns and Bay Scallops...can't go wrong w/ that. The red and green pepper made for nice color and provided good flavor. I limited it to one Anaheim pepper for the heat.

We made changes because my hubby is sensitive to fishy food. We used shrimp, real crab & fake lobster (flake style). I thought this dish was amazing! The sauce was a bit runny, so I recommend simmering until it thickens up nicely. This makes it easier for you to roll into enchiladas. That "White Pepper" is HOT so use sparingly!! It was pretty spicy at first, but the reheated leftovers were not. (The level of spice diminished in the fridge.) If I made this dish again, I would cut up my shrimp into smaller pieces & I was thinking that I could even use this as a seafood dip & omit the flour tortillas! Mmmmm!

This is my favorite recipe for shrimp enchiladas.  I use canned crab meat in place of the scallops because I like it better.  So yummy!
