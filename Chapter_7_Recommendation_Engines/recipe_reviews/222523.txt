Hubby made this for himself...He liked it, but he said next round he's gonna reduce the lime juice by half. Someone gave us a little bit of passion fruit syrup b/c we can't find it anywhere around here and it's SUPER expensive online. I see the other reviewer made their own, so I'm gonna look into that. Also, he floated some 151 rum on top b/c that's just what he does, lol. Thanks for sharing. :)
