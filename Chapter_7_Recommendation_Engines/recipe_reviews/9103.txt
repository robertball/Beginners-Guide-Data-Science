The flavor of this dish is very complex, which I loved. Still, I think it was a bit too tomato-ey for the family. I will probably tone down the tomatoes and hike up the brown sugar next time. But the cloves and golden raisins are great in this.

Really spicey and good!  Reminds me of the chutney at our favorite Indian Restaurant.  I left out the tomatoes and the raisins, and it made a great crunchy alternative to regular old cranberry sauce.

I serve this as a sauce with a smoked pork butt and it is a perfect compliment. I like to use a tablespoon of powdered mustard with this chutney to round it out, but it is perfect without it.
