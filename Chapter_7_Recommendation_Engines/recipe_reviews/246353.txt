Wonderful substitute for store-bought health bars!  I cut the honey to 3/4 cup, and added the equivalent 1/4 cup of stevia. Also bumped up the vanilla to a tablespoon.  These freeze well.

These were so good. I wasn't sure what to expect, but these little mini muffins came out moist and flavorful. I made half a batch (which made exactly 24) but still used a whole egg. I made my own oat flour by putting quick outs in the blender. I didn't have white chips, so I used cinnamon chips, and they worked fine. Mine took exactly 15 minutes.  I think I've eaten 4 of these already, and my 3 year-old has had a couple. I will make them again. Thanks for a nice recipe.

Lots of texture.  I replaced the white chocolate with finely chopped dates.  My grandkids loved them.

These were tasty bites. They were moist, sweet, and had a nutty flavor. I followed what one of the other reviewers did and made 1/2 recipe, used the whole egg, and still got 24. I used mini paper liners and they worked great. I made oat flour in my Vitamix. I then added the rest of the dry ingredients and processed it all well. I did not want large pieces of nuts or the other items. My only subtitute was 5 grain blend for the quinoa amount. I baked them for 21 minutes and noticed they do remain the same size as they went in. So, it is okay to fill them well. Ty

I've been trying a few healthy alternatives to store bought granola / energy bars lately, and I really liked these! I made half a recipe, and the amount of batter was spot on - 24 mini muffins. I baked mine for exactly 15 minutes. I'm sure my son is going to gobble these up when he gets home from school.
