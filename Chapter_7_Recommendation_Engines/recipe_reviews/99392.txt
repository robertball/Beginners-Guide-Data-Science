Okonomiyaki reminds me of my childhood so I had to give this one a shot this past weekend.  I did modify the recipe though so I guess my review doesn’t count so much.  Used Dashi broth rather than water, dried shrimp rather than bacon, didn’t mix in the ginger but used it as a condiment (BTW- don’t use the type of pickled ginger you get with your sushi.  There is another kind that is a deep red that is cut into little sticks), chopped the cabbage rather than sliced it, added ¼c chopped green onion, and topped with Okonomiyaki sauce, Kewpie mayonnaise (Japanese) and Aonori (green dried seaweed powder). My first batch needed to be cooked a little longer, a little too sticky.  The second batch, which was topped also with an egg, came out just perfect.  Boy, brings back memories!  Thanks!

This is the same way I make it, except I leave out the pickled ginger.  The bacon can also be substitued for other meats, I have found ham and shrimp work (but bacon is my fav).  You can also add some finely chopped up leek, which really adds to the traditional flavor.  I serve it with Okonomiyaki sauce (brown sauce) and Japanese Mayo (it's like american mayo without sugar, so you can substitute regular mayo no problem)

This can be a very versatile recipe. Not to mention very delicious as well. As the name suggests, okonomi means your favorite in Japanese. So you can add any of your favorite ingredients in okonomi-yaki. We made ours with shrimp, crab meat and shiitaki mushroom. Instead of water, we used dashi stock which adds more flavor.

These were pretty good!  I'm Japanese so it's a compliment :).  I used Shrimp (cooked w/salt & pepper, little garlic butter and soy sauce) chopped it into the batter.  I topped mine with mayonaise, tonkatsu sauce, bonita flakes and seasoned nori (seaweed).  Reminds me of when I was a little girl in Japan.  No more instant mixes ... no way.

I like this recipe a lot; however, I prefer to use meats that aren't as salty as the cured meats, like beacon and ham... Fresh pork, beef or Chicken breast, sliced thinly and pan fried before combining with the pancake is very good. I really like this dish, though.

Also, I like to cut the ribs out of the cabbage to make sure every bite of cabbage is tender.

I used shrimp to make this as suggested by others and cut down on the pickled ginger b/c I don't like it much.  My hubby and I had a hard time making these b/c we weren't sure what to expect.  Is it supposed to have more batter or more cabbage?  After the first one we found a 'flipable' size and they turned out pretty good.  Great taste and wonderfully cooked cabbage.  Definately NOT traditional american greasy food.

I made this according to the recipe, with bacon and the ginger. My husband ate it just fine, but I didn't like it at all. I found the sauce and bacon were too salty.  Won't make again.

Five stars for taste even though I'm terrible at the flipping part and I end up eating a mish mash of broken parts.  I didn't have bacon so made a vegetarian style which was just as good.  I used fresh finely chopped ginger (didn't have pickled) and a splash of soy sauce in the water.  Finally, finished with spicy mayo (two parts mayo to one part sriracha hot sauce) and nori sprinkled on top.  EDIT: Delicious modified for one person - I used 1/4 c. water to 1/3 c. flour.  Also, was more successful in flipping by forming two to three little pancakes rather than one big one.

I would use dashi instead of water to add more favor to the base. water is a bit too bland. I wouldnt use BBQ sauce, use Okonomiyaki sauce instead. Other suggested filling: grated yam, chopped leeks, Meat(Chicken, Roast pork, or beef), Seafood (Squid, Octopus, shrimp or dried shrimp favored), Corn, Mushrooms, Onion, parsely, bell pepper

The flavor of this dish was a little too strange for our tastes.  My boyfriend said that the barbecue sauce paired with bacon was not so good.  I left out the pickled ginger, however, so that might have something to do with it.

This okonomiyaki is just like the kind you get in the restaurants! I customized it to be the way I usually order it. I cooked udon noodles and put them down to fry in oil before putting the batter down, then the bacon on top of it. Took a bit longer to cook but it was so good! served with katsu sauce and mayonnaise from this site. Oh, and I also skipped the pickled ginger since I have never had it that way. You can also put chunks of salmon instead of the bacon (or just veggie)

I just made this and I found it a little starchy... perhaps the amount of flour could be reduced. I also used dashi broth instead of water, and added a little shoyu (soy sauce) to it. I used ika(which was a little weird of okonomiyaki) instead of bacon, and added carrots, onion, and spring onion to give it a heavier balance of veggies. Overall, it was sooooo good to eat okonomiyaki again! Thanks!

made this as written with the exception of the ginger. (didn't have any)  i have not had the authentic dish, so i am not quite sure how to compare.  it was good; it was easy, and filling.
not quite sure i'd make it again though.  i had 1/2 head of cabbage to use up and this looked interesting.  thanks for letting me try a new and unusual dish (for me!)

This is one of my favourite Japanese diner meals. I left out the (untraditional) bacon and ginger and replaced the cabbage with my favourite okonomiyaki filling kimchi. I also served with Japanese mayo. I was surprised how easy it is to make!

This recipe yielded pancakes that were a bit too doughy, not the okonomiyaki I remember. Perhaps less flour or more water would fix that. Also, American cabbage is simply too "leathery" for this dish to turn out right.

I thought this was pretty good. My oldest son liked it a lot. I had never had this or ever heard of it before. But it was recommended that I try it. I'm glad I did. I think adding some extra veggies would be a good idea. I did add some shredded carrots since I only had half of a cabbage. I could not find pickled ginger so I left it out. I would leave the bacon out next time since I enjoyed the pieces without it more than with it. Thanks I will be making this again.

I made this dish using shrimp and cut up cooked ham and cooked chicken.  I also used okonomi sauce, which can be bought at any Asian food store.  Then mayo on top of the sauce, for a delicious dish. You can put anything you want in it, always delicious. Okonomi means "as you like it" in Japanese, and yaki means fried.

This is very good and fun to do. I used ground pork instead of bacon since that was the way I was taught by a Japanese friend. You can also use shrimp. Then I used an electric skillet on the dining table to make right in front of family and guests; kinda Hitachi style.

Not the kind I know of okonomiyaki.  Very, very doughy and heavy. I would decrease flour way down.

For my first attempt at okonomiyaki, this was pretty good.  I used less flour than called for, dashi broth, a bit of soy sauce, bbq pork instead of bacon, some beansprouts, green onions, shoga (red matchstick ginger),and I used a coleslaw mix instead of chopping cabbage.  I garnished with tonkatsu, kewpie mayo, and more shoga.  My husband, toddler and I all enjoyed this dinner.

I've had alot of okonomiyaki from Japan and I thought this recipe was okay.  The batter came out way too thick and didn't taste good.  I used bonito stock.  I made a second batter with less flour and more stock and it tasted much better.  I also added a seafood medley when I cooked it.  Not as good as the ones in japan but good enough.

My husband would have adored this recipe except for the dashi made it way too salty for him. I will use water next time. But instead of bacon i used Eel and put Japanese mayo, okonomiyaki sauce and Japanese rice topping(salmon flavor) on it. He loved it all except for the actual pancake since it was too salty. I know know if it was the dashi i used or what.

Followed the recipe but also added some of Paulitaz ideas from her review.  Overall they were very good and the family enjoyed them.  I think you can adapt this recipe and add almost any vegetable you like.  I added peas, carrot and corn with chopped bacon mixed into it.  Another tip is that after you place the sauce onto them, sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.  Delicious.

I'm not a huge fan of okonomiyaki, but my husband simply loves this recipe! We always use this one and have made it a meal we make on a regular basis, for my husband to eat, that is.

My variation is that I leave out the gari and the bacon and add assorted seafood to the batter. It comes in a bag frozen and consists of shrimp, squid, mussels and scallops. Thaw out the seafood then just mix it in. It cooks up perfectly and tastes great with the okonomi-sauce and QP Mayo.

I gave this two stars...However, I think I chopped my cabbage two thick.  I am going to try it again and make sure to shred my cabbage on the thin and small side.  I think that will improve the recipe greatly.  I will update my review accordingly.

This recipe is quite incredibly simple but oh so good.  I've made it twice so far, each time using the exact recipe for the batter but modifying the protein and toppings that I put in it slightly, and both times the okonomiyaki ends up tasting quite good. 

This one is definitely a keeper. Thank you for sharing this.

Yum!  I left out the pickled ginger and sauce because I didn't have any.  I tried it with oyster sauce, but didn't like it.  I thought it was just fine without sauce.  My batter was very thick, so I had to spread it with the spatula in the pan.  Will make this again!

Oh, yum! We really enjoyed this. I've never had okonomiyaki before so I wasn't quite sure of what to expect for the taste, but this was excellent. I didn't have any pickled ginger, so unfortunately I left it out. Instead I added green onions. We had it with okonomiyaki sauce. Unfortunately I had no Japanese mayo - and I didn't think American mayo would be the same :) I'll look for aonori next time I'm in an Asian market too. I'll definitely make it again, and I think I'll try shrimp or the mixed seafood suggestion as well!

Tasty, but came out really heavy. Maybe I should have used Miso base instead of water...?

Everyone loved it!  Instead of 4 big cakes it made 12 big cakes!  Changes I made: added carrots and green onions, used store brand "bacon bits" to save time. After the mayo and tonkatsu sauce I sprinkled on furikake - a rice topping that can be found with sushi ingredients in the asian section. My furikake had bonito, seaweed and sesame seeds.  Next time I will buy japanese mayo and dashi soup stock.  I will also shred my cabbage by hand instead of throwing it in the Cuisinart so that it comes out in strips, not bits, to hold the food together better.

I used a broth instead of water and thin slices of cooked pork instead of bacon for health reasons.  I like okonomiyaki, but I think this was too thick.  Perhaps it is supposed to be thick?  I may reduce the flour next time.  I will definitely make it again with a few changes.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but it brought back memories of when my mom used to make it. She added sliced squid, bean sprouts, and konnyaku (yam cake-cut into small cubes). Then just before eating them we would put bonito (dried fish flakes), the green dried seaweed and tonkatsu sauce on top. MMM!! I think I will make this soon!!!

The best place to get these is in Hiroshima, where it originated. Okonomiyaki is comprised of ingredients that the Japanese found left-over by the American soldiers that later came there during the war. This recipe could use some sprucing-up, but it is as good as it gets outside of Hiroshima.

I made it with left over Corned Beef from St. Pats.  I am on a Keto diet, so used almond flour instead of white flour.  The flip was a fail, but the taste was great.

Delicious!!  Highly versatile too. My daughter loves bacon, so I've made it as written aside from using dashi instead of water, but I prefer it using prosciutto or Parma ham.  The saltiness with the other ingredients is so incredibly good.  I've also made it semi-vegetarian (just the dashi being non-vegetarian) and it is very nice.  This is a great weeknight meal, easy and quick but nutritious and tasty.  I always make extra so my daughter can have it the next day in her school lunch.  Just pack up the sauces separately and definitely use kewpie mayonnaise.

I thought I had a medium-head cabbage but mine must have been very large, even though it was the only size at my grocery store. I could have easily halved the amount of cabbage, because the batter was soon 80% diced cabbage, and that made it a little difficult to form and flip. Eventually I drastically cut the size of the individual pancakes and was decent at flipping them, but some still fell apart. Even so, the cabbage wilted enough while cooking that it wasn't hard to eat at all, but I still wish I had used less.
I dissolved a beef bouillon into the water, but I don't know that it added much. Instead of using tonkatsu sauce, I used some sweet honey barbeque sauce which was very good. I topped the pancakes with mayonnaise, as some suggested, which I think is pretty necessary. The mayonnaise really has all of the fat and salt that the pancake itself lacks. I found that the bacon wasn't very crispy and I don't necessarily know that it needs that amount of crisp, but I would be interested to see what it would be like with dried shrimp like someone mentioned. When I reheated it, I ended up topping the mayonnaise with dried bacon bits then barbeque sauce, which was very good and I suggest that if you want the crunch, or maybe you don't have real bacon on you; it might be better for the texture anyway. I couldn't find pickled ginger so I diced some raw ginger up and threw that in the batter, which was subtle but I think pretty good.
Overall it was very tasty and it reheats well.

A good, simple recipe. Myself, I choose to put the bacon(I use bacon ends - more meat and better flavour) and some green onion in the pan just before the cabbage mix rather than pre cooking the bacon before making the mix. I also use about a half cup less flour as I find this recipe makes the mix too thick and results in the bacon burning on the bottom before it's ready to flip. Just to pretend it's healthy, I also add a few spoonfuls of hemp hearts to the mix.

This isn't how it was done in Hiroshima so I modified this quite a lot.  For the batter I used an okonomiyaki flour mix for the base. You can get it at any Asian grocery store. Instead of bacon they used thicker slabs of pork. They also offered shrimp. They also fried noodles and put those onto the dish.  Kewpie mayonnaise and bonito flakes made for an authentic taste.

Delicious!  I left out the bacon to keep it vegetarian and only used 1/4 head of cabbage.  It is so versatile and easy to make.  My whole family loved it.
