I didn't have a single problem with this recipe. I will say I DID worry about making the tortilla bowls but it turned out just fine without a hitch. Because I do NOT buy pre-packaged kits, I made my own taco salad bar with seasoned taco meat, shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, salsa, sour cream, cheese, olives, onions and a bag of corn chips. We all enjoyed making our own salads and it was a nice family dinner. I'd make this again--four stars on the recipe's direction on how to make taco salad bowls without deep frying.

These were really yummy and super easy. I wasn't able to find the salad kit so I just made my own taco ranch and made a mix of my own cheese. I liked the idea of using the dressing on the chicken was a nice change of pace to the normal taco seasoning and the bowls were super easy to make and looked so cute.

I made this recipe last night except I used chicken.  I had everything except the gr Chuck & didn't want to make a special trip to town.  
  Some folks would probably not have liked it but my hubby & I thought it was great!!

Quick summer meal. I used just bagged lettuce; addeded tomatoes and cheese. I substituted hamburger for chicken because thatâ€™s what I had on hand. Really good
