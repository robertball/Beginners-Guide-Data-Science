This recipe is super simple and tastes great. I use itlian bread crumbs so there really isn't any need for the italian seasoning. Served with rotini noodles and spaghetti sauce with bread and a salad (throw in "garlic croutons" from this site), its a perfect meal.

As written, kinda bland. I added some garlic powder, freshly-ground pepper, and a pinch of cayenne pepper to the flour mixture. This really needs a marinara sauce too. Not bad but needs a little tweaking.

What a wonderful weekday dinner option. Few ingredients - very little hassle. Moist, tender, and flavorful. A couple of simple sides and you're all set.

This recipe was quick, easy, and the chicken came out with a really good flavor.  I used thighs and legs so the cooking time differed...they were yummy!

I really liked this recipe.  It was really easy.  I ended up using jalapeno cheese on some of the chicken breasts and it was great.

This was an awesome oven-fried chicken dish.  I had more chicken than the recipe called for so I added about a 1/3 cup potato flakes to the bread crumb coating mix.  I also oiled the pan to keep it from sticking.  The chicken was very moist, and the coating was crispy and nicely browned.

Great quick dinner idea; I sliced up mozzarella cheese slices and melted it on top of a dollop of spaghetti sauce...MMM  I also double breaded some chicken and that turned out great.  Thanks for sharing!

Cooked this for a special valentines meal. Added pepper and garlic salt and it was perfect.
It was also easy to have the kids help make it.

This recipe is super easy and very tasty! I used italian bread crumbs and still added the italian seasoning. I also sprinkled a little extra garlic powder, rosemary and thyme on top of the chiicken and drizzled some melted butter over all before putting it in the oven. The chicken was tender, juicy and flavorful. I served it with risotto, mixed steamed veggies with basil, and a salad. My whole family asked for seconds of this delicious meal! Thanks for the great recipe!

Nice to find breaded chicken that does not require pan frying first and with such few ingredients, so quick to make at the end of a long day. I ended up changing the recipe only because of the ingredients I had available. I crushed up multi grain garlic croutons and added grated parmesan, to bring the volume up, as well as salt and pepper. It was fantastic; even my 2 1/2 year old that lives on air and crackers loved it.

This recipe was awesome, although I changed one big thing. Instead of using Italian seasoning (I didn't have any), I used garlic seasoning. It smelled like I used too much when I was cooking (and probably WAS too much), but it turned out great. Granted, my mom said she wished she had it without garlic, but I have a different style of taste than she does and I LOVED it. So thanks for the recipe! :)

Great base recipe - but definitely could have used a little more "oomph"...Perhaps some garlic, or a dash of paprika - could have helped liven it up a bit. Other than that - it's just ok "As Is" ;);)

This tasted great and was super easy! 

I substituted the plain dry bread crumbs and the Italian seasoning with Garlic and Herb flavored bread crumbs.

This was great.  My husband and kids ate all of it.  Instead of store-bought breadcrumbs, I ground 2 heels of whole wheat bread, then added 1/2 teaspoon of chicken bullion granules and at least 1 1/2 teaspoons of italian seasoning in my food processor.  The coating was crispy and the cheese nice and melted.  This would be great with some sort of tomato-based side dish.  I will certainly be making this again!

This was a wonderful recipe that one of my kids loved and my husband enjoyed!  I used kellogs cornflake crumbs because they don't have partially hydrogenated oils which are cancer causing and many of the other bread crumbs contained.

I cut my chicken beast in half (length wise). I dipped the chicken in egg wash. Then I dredged it in the bread crumbs I made from dried bread and seasonings (garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, basil, and thyme). I baked it in a lightly oiled (olive oil) pyrex pan on 350 for 45 minutes. I added the cheese on top of chicken the last 15 minutes in cooking time.  everyone loved it, would definitely make again.

I made this because it looked simple and easy and I had everything needed on hand.  It was simple and easy to make but it lacks something.  Maybe it would be better with a sauce?

Instead of baking the chicken, I fried the chicken in a few tablespoons of olive oil.  I also flattened the chicken so it would cook a little faster.  I did find the recipe a little bland (even though I used Italian style bread crumbs (next time I will add more seasonings).  This is a great dinner to cook after work and very easy.

Before putting the cheese on top, I spooned a little tomato sauce over the chicken.  I also flavored the bread crumbs a bit more.  All in all, a good basic recipe.

I followed the directions for this one and it DIDN'T turn out good at all. There was no taste, no flavor, or no juice to it. I wouldn't recommend this recipe @ all Sorry.

I thought this was just ok. I served with a side of pasta and tomato sauce, if I make again I will try with a different side.

I amended the recipe to use tenderlions instead of breasts to make it a little more kid friendly. Served it with buttered spaghetti and garden salad it went over great.

I loved this recipe; it was easy and delicious.  I used an Itallian blend of cheeses instead of only Mozzarella.  It was delicious.

My husband is very picky and rarely tries anything new.  But he absolutely loved this dish (made with cheddar cheese) and told me to add this to my list of regular chicken dishes.

This came out great! I did forget to add the cheese but the kids loved it! Will definitely make again. I definitely recommend for a quick dinner when you don’t know what else to make or if you are in a time crunch.

I did this recipe. But what I did was I made a shallow cut into the chicken breast and then stuff the cheese into the cut then dip it into the egg mixture then bread it and put it into the oven. It was delicious and my dad loved it too!
