I like this, but my husband thought it was bland.  I was afraid he would, so I boiled the veggies in diluted chicken stock for a little extra flavor, but I guess it wasn't enough.  I will make it again, though I'll have to find a way to spice it up for him I guess.  I thought it was a good variation of regular old mashed potatoes.

I made this for my husband who is of Scottish heritage, and he loved it!  It was delicious and a nice way to spruce up plain old mashed potatoes.  I did add crumbled bacon as suggested in another recipe, but it would be delicious without.  A definite keeper!

A very nice combo of turnip and potatoes. I'm not a turnip fan, but this was pretty good.  Even my father, who never eats turnip, had a small second helping!

Thanks for the recipe - next time I'll try adding the crumbled bacon

Being of Scottish descent I jumped on this recipe and loved it.  Took a large portion to lunch with my friends and they loved it too, although they were completely surprised by the combination.  Excellent!  I did delete the heavy cream to lighten up on the fat a bit.

I, and my siblings grew up on this dish. When I would tell my grade school friends, the reaction was " eew, turnip?" So I finally asked my mum what this dish was called she said " my invention". Well, we all loved it even if it didn't have a real name. WhenI was in college, I asked her again. This time the answer was " Nannie ( her grandmother from Ireland) taught me. So, OK. When I once more asked her in my fifties, she said "I like mashed potatoes, and I really love turnip but I don't like carrots at all. So Nannie made this combination so I would "eat those carrots!!" When I became a mother I did the same thing so that I could "eat my carrots", and never let the children know that I didn't like 'em."See what a mother will do for her children?"

This was really amazing!  I'm so glad to have found this recipe!  It was like having mashed potatoes with a little extra kick. :)  I didn't have to put anything in it to make most of my family like it, we enjoyed it with butter and salt and pepper.  Thanks for a great recipe...with heritage! :D

We call this root mousse. My family loves it and it's the only way I eat turnip! We've been making this since my son got the recipe while in culinary tech school!

Good recipe! I overcooked it a bit but that's on me; it would have been better if it were just a tad lumpier and less smooth.

I threw in a couple cloves of garlic to boil with everything and smashed those up too, which added a nice touch of flavor to the recipe. I'll definitely be trying these again next time I get turnips from my farm share!

With the leftovers I'm refrigerating them overnight so they'll set up and in the morning I'll make little balls from it and fry them in some oil. A tasty leftover treat for breakfast!

This is exactly like the dish my mother-in-law used to make and she was of French-Canadian descent - the family always asks for it when we get together and I have had company rave about it as a substitute for plain mashed potatoes - the turnip does not come through on its own as all the flavors blend well.  I usually use a little more potato to equal amounts of turnip and carrot and milk rather than cream, although I like the idea of cream.

I make this often although I never had a name for it nor a recipe. We call it "root vegetables mixture".  I also add cooked beets to the mixture when I mash it all together.  Delicious!

I cooked the white (peeled) potatoes with turnips or a large Rutabaga peeled, quartered  boiled with potatoes.
After cooking, they were mashed together. (add a little cream or sour cream)
In another pot, I added three peeled sweet potatoes also boiled separately with the carrots.
After the sweet potatoes & carrots are boiled till soft, I mashed them together.
Now I placed the mashed "whites" root vegetables in a dish around the sides (greased) and placed the "yellow/orange" roots mashed in the middle hole and took a butter knife and swirled them together a bit for a design.
Baked, 350 degrees.....butter on top afterwards....YUM
ROOT Medley.

This was good.  My personal preference, however, is to make this dish with rutabagas, rather than white turnips.  I'm not an expert on Scottish cooking, but I think it may be more authentic with rutabagas.  If you go this route, be aware that rutabagas take a lot longer to cook through than a similar sized chunk of potato or carrot.

I didn't care for the carrot. it's not authentic either. Then again the cream isn't authentic and I quite liked it.

This needed a healthy pinch of salt, but otherwise was pretty good - a nice change from regular mashed potatoes.

I was given turnips and I had no idea what to do with them so I tried this and I was very glad! It's wonderful!! As a matter of fact I made it for the children at my child care center and they ate them all up!! I just added salt and pepper, butter and milk instead of the cream.

Minor changes. I increased the proportion of turnips to potatoes to 1:1. I might increase it again to lower the carbohydrates. I browned the butter to increase flavor. I like the idea one of the other reviewers mentioned of using broth for a boiling liquid - excellent idea! People mention that it is bland, but it is a good bit less bland than mashed potatoes. Oh, I did add a tsp of dried parsley just for pretty!

Amazing!  My 4y daughter was reading a book this morning about bunnies eating carrots and turnips. She did not know what a turnip was so we hunted down this recipe. After looking at other reviews that it was a bit bland,  I took the recommendation of cooking in chicken broth and adding more salt. I also added the tiniest dash of garlic and onion powders (maybe 1/8-1/4 tsp). My daughter deemed it better than regular mashed potatoes and I could have eaten nothing but this for dinner. Super tasty!!!!
