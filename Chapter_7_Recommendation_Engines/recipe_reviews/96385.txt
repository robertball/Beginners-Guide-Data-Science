This is the best. We make it once a week of a quick meal.  Even if you don't have the spinach or feta.  All you need is the sauce

I only loosely followed this recipe, but we really enjoyed it.  I opted for a "real" tzaziki sauce, and seasoned my turkey with a a Greek seasoning recipe I found here on allrecipes.  I did use the suggested fillings listed here though (except I forgot the feta...darn it!), and absolutely love the concept --totally low-fat and flavorful!  We will be having it again because it was very tasty.

It was really good, but would have been better with real tzatziki rather than ranch dressing.

This was nice for a quick and healthy supper.  I added garlic and onion powder to the meat, along with a few dashes of McCormicks greek seasoning to punch up the flavour. I wasn't sure if the dressing would be good or not, and was pleasantly surprised by it. The only other thing I added when garnishing was some red onion. Even my children enjoyed these. Thanks!

I usually make a lot of substitutions (ground beef for turkey, lettuce for spinach, garlic powder for garlic salt, tortillas for pita bread) depending on what I have on-hand, and it's always delicious!  I think the keys are the oregano/garlic in the meat & (as another reviewer mentioned) the sauce.  My family loves this recipe!

Just okay for us.  I wanted more authentic mediterranean, so went for real Tzaziki sauce while my husband and kids did the ranch.  We found the turkey too dry and they said, "It's okay mom, but don't make it again please."

EVEN THE KIDS WILL LOVE THIS!!!!  I used ground chicken instead of ground turkey.  Really good in mini pitas too.

This was really good! I did change a few things. I used tofu (instead of turkey) fried it with oregano and garlic. I mixed the tofu with black olives and stewed tomatos. Mixed the rest of tomatos in some left over rice. Assembled in a tortilla wrap as listed. Added some avacodo. Amazing!!
Will make this again. Might try the turkey and pita next time.

This was too good! Followed the recipe and couldn't have been better. The only neg I have is the next day sauce tends to be a little runny. However if does not effect the taste. Yum, this is one of our favs now. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent!  The turkey is flavorful with the oregano and garlic salt, and the feta adds the right touch.  Loved it!

Nice & easy recipe.  The leftovers were great for lunch the next day even though I didn't have any turkey left.

This is a very refreshing dish. Even my very picky 8 year old enjoyed the cucumber sauce. I would recommend to anyone.

this was fabulous! I can never leave a recipe alone though- I added sweet red peppers, fresh garlic and onions, and omitted the spinach. My 7 year old ate 2 portions and my husband is still raving about it. Thanks for such a tasty and easy recipe!
