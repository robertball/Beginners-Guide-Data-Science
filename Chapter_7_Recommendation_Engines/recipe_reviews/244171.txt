Way too much seasoning for 1 batch of popcorn!  I put about 1/4 the amount of seasoning on the popped corn, and much of it remained after the bowlful was finished!  This might have been better written as a seasoning, with the suggestion that it be sprinkled over popped corn! The flavor is good, so I will save it for more popcorn!

Love the flavors in this! I haven't used it on popcorn, but it does make a HUGE amount, which I am now using to season meats and vegetables - it's great on zoodles. This one is a keeper for me and I may even try it on popcorn too!

It really does make the popcorn taste like Doritos!  Well, pretty close anyway :-)  For someone who can't eat Doritos anymore (corn chip allergy), this is a great alternative.  I agree with another reviewer saying the recipe should've specified this is a large batch mixture of the spices - not to all be poured over 8 cups of popped popcorn, yikes!  I just store the mixture in a spice jar and sprinkle to taste over hot buttered popcorn.  For those who said the seasoning wouldn't stick to the popcorn - you have to either pop your popcorn in oil, or put some butter on top first - it won't stick to dry popcorn.  Delicious recipe, it is a keeper!

Wow, really tasty!  I would do this next time: add a teaspoon more salt to the mixture.  Then, only use half for eight cups of popcorn. Save the other half for later.  I popped my in the traditional stove top manner.  Very close to the Doritos flavor.

I thought it was a bit overpowering for the popcorn, but absolutely loved it as a coating for cod while making fish tacos. I also added it to some plain greek yogurt to dollop on top. Thanks!!

The coating did not stick at all to the popcorn. The flavoring was not in the least bit reminiscent of a Dorito.

I prefer regular popcorn. I popped corn in an air popper and put 1 T. melted butter on popcorn and then tossed with spices without the cayenne. I just used 1 teaspoon salt and that was plenty. Thanks Shawn it's always fun to try new things.
