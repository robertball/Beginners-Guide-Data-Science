Very delicious way to make Cauliflower Rice. It's addictive...even my husband grabbed another serving. I was out of chili powder and used the author's suggestion of substituting the spices with taco seasoning (I used Taco Seasoning I from this site). I had a really large head of cauliflower, which yielded close to 48oz cauliflower rice, and quadrupled the amount of ingredients. My only problem was that there seemed to be way too much liquid and took a long time to reduce. Still wonderful flavor nonetheless and I just used a slotted spoon to serve the rice. However, my husband said he could eat it even with the excess liquid. Next time I'll try reducing the amount of tomato sauce and broth called for by half and update this review accordingly. This will definitely be a go to in our house as an alternative to Mexican Rice! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Its good! I had whole head of cauliflower ready and riced so I doubled the spices, but the pinch of oregano can get over powering I won't add it next time.  Ended up using double tomato sauce too, but less water and then just watched it and tasted often to adjust.

I didnâ€™t have tomato sauce so I substituted w/juice from the pico de gallo and a little extra chicken broth. Also avoided the salt and increased the other seasoning a pinch.
