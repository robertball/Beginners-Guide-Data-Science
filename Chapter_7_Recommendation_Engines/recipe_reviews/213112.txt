Talk about comfort foods!  This was my favorite when I was a kid.  The only change I would make is to use a "real" ham.  Also, I have never tried a slow cooker for this...but am going to give it a shot. Thanks!

Made this yesterday and I used a real ham but other than that didn't change a thing and it was perfect. Reminds me of my grandmothers cooking.

I couldn't actually find a 1-lb turkey ham, so I used the 2-lb one... and I'm glad I did. We ate it all and it was fantastic! The 'soup' and veggies that we didn't finish with the first meal, we added some corned beef to a couple of days later to make an improvised corned beef and cabbage.

To clear up some questions- I'm from Boston, MA (originally) and we ate this often.  layered flavors," comfort food, kind of dishes.  I use Turkey Ham because the pork ham leaves the dish a little greasy for me and the turkey ham seems to become a little more fall-apart tender to me.  I put the garlic cloves in whole.  They become sweet and tender without over-powering the dish.  I always serve with a pat of butter. Sorry that I forgot that.  I've begun adding caraway seeds from time to time which is a yummy addition and will top with some sour cream next time that I do.  Great idea!  Thanks!  I like my cabbage super soft, but for the people who find the flavor too strong or the person who found the cabbage flavor "off," adding it at the end is a great idea!  I also love the polish kielbasa idea.  We'll have to try it.  I'll bet it adds another wonderful layer of flavor!  The beauty of these Old-World dishes is that you get to alter them in very small ways to make them your own.  We even substitute parsnips, turnips and/or cauliflower for the potatoes sometimes and its super yummy!  I hope that cleared some things up for you all and I hope it's continued to be enjoyed!

The most important thing about this recipe is to remember using a  turkey ham is different then using a regular ham. I have tried boiled dinner in a slow cooker with a regular ham and it did not work out as well for me as the reviewer "Alilaw" who seems to of had great results. This is a recipe even I can't mess up (too much) we'll see next time. I will make it again.

This dish was bland but with added seasonings was ok.  We did not care for the cabbage, which tasted "off".  I put in 4 cups of broth (the recipe calls for 2c.) and it still wasn't enough to cover all like it tells you to.  So, ingredients/instructions are off there.  I will probably not make this again.

I used regular ham and I honestly thought the flavor was kind of cooked out of it.  I also added some polish kielbasa and it was great!  Next time I will skip the ham and only use kielbasa.  I also used pearl onions but I think regular would have been just as good if not better.

This was great! I cooked it on high for about 4.5 hours. I wouldn't make any changes except to say be sure to use LOW SODIUM chicken broth. The turkey ham is very salty.

Over-all good. I did find the ingredients and preparations was somewhat laking. For instance, the garlic cloves, are they crushed? Thrown in as is? Are they chopped or minced? It does make a difference in the taste and precise instructions would be greatly appreciated in future postings. -dsd

1st let me say how it makes me smile with announce when most reviewer comes across negative and critical. Allrecipes is my go to for every meal I prepare. I use each recipe as a guide mostly, my family has raved how much of a great cook I've become thanks to the wonderful ppl that help with thier submitted recipes..,this type of recipe give much room for added or decrease ingredients. I love this recipe, I did use left over ham w bone instead, with a reduce sodium chicken stock with some of  my homemade chicken stock, little bit of season.. (garlic, onion powder, pinch of pickled seasoning, cumin and parsley)let it simmer on low for 2 hrs, then added simi peeled red potatoes after 1 1/2 hrs added small head of sliced cabbage , (like mine a bit chewy) again Use your preference....Was wonderful for a rainy spring evening.. Enjoy and have fun playing!! Thank

I'm a DownEast Mainiac, raised just NW of Castine. Had this at least one or two weeks of the month! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!
Have had it as a soup, a set, or a plated meal. Here is a variation: using the ham bone, cook on Low in the slow cooker an hour in beef broth. Remove the bone, add a small cabbage (chopped), carrots, potatoes, corned beef pieces or ham, (optional)mushrooms and a small (sliced) onion. Cook for 6 hours on Low. Serve.

I grew up on this! My mother and grandmother made it quite often, especially during the colder months. The only differences were that they either used left-over baked ham or a good canned ham, like Hormel's Black Label. I actually like the texture of the canned ham better than the "real ham". It seems to boil well. Also they just used russet or Idaho potatoes, peeled and chopped. When I make it now I use a good chicken stock and sometimes substitute cauliflower or parsnips for the cabbage. To serve it, use a slotted spoon to spoon it onto the plate, and (this is a must in my opinion) slap a couple pads of butter on there, add salt and pepper. It's even great with sour cream! Thanks for posting this Shez. It brings back memories!

I actually prefer my recipe...I use Polish sausage instead of turkey ham, add 2 bay leaves and 8 peppercorns and only 2 cloves of garlic, bruised. The flavor is more smoky and rich. I also cook it in the traditional way on top of the stove...my family are from New England.  I also add parsnips and rutabega wedges and a large whole onion. The cooking time is vastly reduced to 2 1/2 hours. Add the cabage wedges during the last 15 mins of cooking so that it is tender but keeps its shape. But for a first timer this recipe is ok.

Used a a pork shoulder Boston butt about 2.5 pound. Put in carrots, onion and potatoes with about 20 oz chicken broth low sodium. Cooked for 2 hrs on high, with just the broth and pork, then added the veggies on low. I forgot to add the cabbage, but it was delicious on it’s own! I also added some spices and two bay leaves. No one missed the cabbage, even on St Patty’s Day

Yum! I made this last night and it turned out delicious. I couldn’t find a turkey ham at the store, so I bought a regular 3 lb ham. I was a little worried that it wouldn’t turn out good or be greasy, but using a regular ham was fine. I also ended up splitting up the ingredients into 2 slow cookers because it wouldn’t all fit into one. Instead of the pearl onions, I used 1 yellow onion per slow cooker, cut into quarters. I sprinkled some black pepper into the finished product and it was yummy. Now what took it to the next level was trying it with the caraway seeds and sour cream. Thank you to he author for those suggestions!

I've changed my screen name but I'm the same cook. Put the garlic in whole, in my opinion, but it's one of those things you change to your preference. I don't cover with brother. I just address enough to see rise up the side of the crock-pot. I serve with a slotted spoon and pat of butter.  Still a household favorite!
