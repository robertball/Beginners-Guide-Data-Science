I have used a similar recipe many times and it is absolutely fabulous. I know you might think the combo of ingredients is rather odd, but when they cook together, they taste wonderful! Here are some tips: You can use boneless skinless breasts and cook for about an hour. Thousand island dressing is what I have always used (as opposed to Russian dressing) and it is great. You can use jellied cranberry sauce or whole cranberry sauce and both work fine. Covering with tin foil for at least 1/2 the baking time is recommended as the sauce may burn a bit. Finally, make sure you make some rice with this to soak up the yummy sauce! Enjoy!

I LOVE this recipe!  It's soooooo quick and tastes great.  The sauce is fantastic over homemade mashed potatoes so they're a must side for this meal.  I use breasts so I only cook for 1 hour, and I put all the sauce in the pan.  Covering the dish makes a big difference too, so don't skip the foil!

WE LOVED IT!  If you use the slow cooker, you should skin the chicken and add two tbsp of cornstarch and extra pepper or poultry seasoning to the cold sauce and  so I threw in about 12 skinnless, boneless thighs while still frozen and cooked in the crock for 8 hours.  My husband is not the cranberry freak I am, but the cooked sauce tastes nothing like any of the ingredients.

This was a SUPERB recipe!!! It was sweet and tangy and tender AND very easy. I followed the directions but used whole berry cranberry sauce, and after dipping the chicken in the mixture I poured all the sauce on the dish and cooked as directed. I tried it with pork chops it was also great. I will be making it for company, and my family very often.

Good flavor!  I put frozen chicken thighs in the crock pot and spread the sauce over top.  I set it on high for 5 hours.  It turned out great!  My husband loved the sauce over white rice.

Easy, easy, easy!  I only had four chicken thighs, so I didn't use a whole bottle of dressing, and I used jellied cranberry sauce.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written, with great result!  The next time I would take the skin off of the chicken, and baste during baking to compensate for the loss of moisture.  That way, there wouldn't be so much chicken fat in the fabulous sauce, and the chicken would marinate more in the sauce.

I am not a huge fan of Onion Soup mix but this sauce has so many flavors that it isn't overwhelming.  My husband and kids really like this and it is so easy.  Rice as a side for the sauce is a must!  I use boneless, skinless chicken thighs and there is plenty of sauce for them.  This is really easy and would be great for a dinner party where you wanted time to mingle with your guests and didn't want to be tied to the kitchen.

I really like this recipe.  Tastes great!  A warning -- the sauce tends to burn and bake onto the pan, so you might want to think twice before making this in your best ovenware.

This is one of my absolute favorite dishes! The chicken is moist, the flavor is wonderful, and on top of that, it is really simple to make. I also used whole cranberries for the sauce - yum! This recipe is similar to Apricot Chicken that uses apricot preserves instead of cranberries. It is also very tasty!

Chicken breasts are really tender and juicy with this marinade as well. I use whole cranberry sauce, 1 cup (8 oz.)of Russian, French, Catalina, Western type dressing, one envelope of onion soup mix (use good brand names)mix all and pour over chicken in pan, cover and let marinade at least 8 hours, uncover and bake 1/2 hour to 45 min. at 350 degrees until juices run clear and they are done. The sauce should get rich thick and brown and be just right. Serve with rice and a salad.

Realizing that we all have different tastes, I'm rating this a 3 because we didn't care for this dish.  I followed recipe exactly as written....and found it to have an usual taste.  Not a bar-b-que sauce, not a sweet sauce....just kind of an usual taste that none of us liked.  I will say that the sauce was good on the rice...just not on the chicken.  Sorry for the low review but I am glad we at least tried it and I'm sure many of you will like the taste so don't let my low review scare you away from trying it.

AMAZING. We had this over rice and it was delicious. We cut the chicken into bite sized pieces before coating them and it cut down the cooking time and made for much easier eating. The sauce was so good on top of the rice. We'll definitely be making more :]

Absolutely delicious!!  Couldn't be easier.  I cooked 6 hours in my slow cooker and served over rice.  This is a great recipe I will be serving and sharing with friends!

This is by far our favorite way to make chicken now! I have converted this to a slow cooker recipe with RAVE reviews! I used Sweet and Spicy French dressing in place of Russian (couldn't find), and used chicken breasts. Threw it all in crockpot and cooked on low for 5+/- hours--DELISH!!!  Thanks Honda

Quick and excellent! We used it for a dinner party and doubled the recipe.  The whole house smelled so wonderful as our guests arived. At dinner we joined it with a white Solay wine, scalloped potatoes and green beans.  What a wonderful combination.  DELICIOUS! There was extra sauce left over for ham the next day!

Almost as good as the Apricot Chicken recipe, also on this site. I think it's best with the  Russian dressing, but you can play around with Catalina, French or Thousand Island and find out what suits your family's tastebuds the best. I usually blend the sauce or jam with the dressing and dried onion soup early in the day, so the flavors have a chance to "marry" and the dry onion soaks up the liquid. My husband loves this dish,so I'll be making it again. Thank you, Brenda!

My husband said "I have fallen in love with chicken again". I used boneless chicken breasts and the chicken came out moist and juicy. Very unique taste. I will add to our food rotation with the Harvest Rice on the side.

We use Catalina Dressing for this - (can't ever seem to find Russian) make it often for company, and never have leftovers. The only other change is that we use boneless breasts or strips.  My husband is PICKY and he likes this - served with rice and green beans or glazed carrots, it makes a wonderful Christmas or Valentine's Day dish.  Also does well on a buffet - suggest you give it a try; although I see where others did not like it, we have never had that response and it could not be easier!

Fantastic. The combination of ingredients didn't appeal at first, but I tried it and my husband and I loved it. ( I mean, he was raving with his mouth full and begging me to make it again!) I wouldn't change a single thing.

Great recipe but I added 2 tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit and I removed the skin from the chicken pieces covering the pan with foil for the whole cooking time.

Followed the recipe and it was DELICIOUS!  Sweet and tangy.  Very easy too! I bought some chicken thighs on sale and needed to find a good recipe for them. 

We served it with brown rice and put the extra sauce on this...sooo good! Would recommend steamed veggies to go with it too.

This makes a good meal.  I recommend lining your baking pan with tin foil to save some serious cleaning time.  Also, a few squirts of your favorite hot sauce goes a long way to cut some of the sweetness and round out the flavor a little.

Let me say, upon reading over the recipe I will admit I had my doubts. However, I put my faith in the rave reviews this recipe had received from others, took a deep breath, and took the plunge. Following one suggestion, I mixed the soup mix, cranberry sauce, and dressing together and let it sit in the refrigerator overnite to let the flavors blend, and poured it over the chops prior to baking the next evening. My boyfriend and picky teenage daughter LOVED IT!! A very quick, delicious recipe. Can't wait to try it over pork ribs..yum, yum, yum!!

Incredibly easy to make with ribs in the slow cooker.  I just browned the ribs on each side for 15 minutes at 400 degrees, then mixed all the ingredients and dipped the ribs in the mixture before throwing in the slow cooker with the remains of any extra marinade.  On low for 6.5 hours, voila.   More sweet with just enough salty than anything -- I also added about 1 tsp chili pepper flakes but next time I'll add more to give it an extra kick

This was pretty good for a change.  It had an Asian flair in my opinion.  Only change I made was I added some crushed pepper flakes to give it some zing.  Next time I think I'll add additional pepper flakes and maybe a dash of soy sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly except I cooked the thighs covered with foil for 1 hour 15 minutes and uncovered for 15 minutes. I also broiled them for a caramelized skin!  Delicious juicy and succulent chicken! Next time I'm going to add a pinch of red pepper flakes to add a touch of spice. Thanks Honda!

I give this five stars, because it is so easy! I used Light Done Right Catilina and whole berry cranberries. I was reluctant, but it lived up to the hype. My husband (who usually wrinkles his nose to chicken) loved it. I served with roasted sweet potatoes that I tossed in chicken broth, a touch of olive oil and another packet of onion soup mix. It was fabulous.

This is a great and simple recipe.   Have done it several times and my family loves it.  The only change I did was use full chicken legs and breasts (6 legs and 2 breast) and did not have to double the rest of ingredients.

I skinned the thighs first, and used 1000 island instead of Russian dressing. (I didn't have any).  It was still delicious! I cooked it 20 minutes with a foil tent and then 40 minutes without.  We had lots of juicy sauce to pour over our rice.  I made a salad and voila! Dinner!

I've now made this dish several times with minor variations.  Instead of cranberry sauce, I've used  strawberry preserves OR orange marmalade, both of which came out well.  It also works well for a crock pot dish!

This was very good! I put it all together after I sent DH into town so he would not see what went in it, otherwise he would not have eaten it ;) DH and Grandfather raved about how good it was and I very much enjoyed it. Love how ingredients that dont "go together" make such a very nice dish. I used chicken legs and served over white rice. Super yum will be making this again.

This was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! The ingriedients are certainly unique but the flavor is spectacular. What a great recipe for a party and soooo easy. I used boneless thighs and served over rice. This dish was a big hit from ages 2 to 82.

I was so happy with this dish! At first I was a little hesitant--it didn't seem like the ingredients would go well together. But instead the flavors blended wonderfully. I was pleasantly surprised! It was so quick and easy to prepare. This is definitely a new favorite!

Wonderful.  It keeps everybody guessing what's in the sauce.  One note - I don't ususally have Russian salad dressing, so I use mayo instead.

My fiance really liked this dinner.  I thought it was only OK.  We took the advice of another reviewer and made the chicken in the crock pot.  I used light Catalina dressing, the cranberry sauce and half the packet of soup mix.  I was really nervous while it was cooking because I didn't think it smelled that great, but it came out tasting like BBQ chicken.

I just realized that I never rated this recipe as I'm planning to make it again. We all really liked this - the "sauce" is very interesting and unique but definitely tasty. I followed the recipe, didn't change a thing. I love that it's so easy to prepare too! Obviously I'll make this regularly as like I said I'm planning to make it again :)

The sauce was surprisingly delicious. I used Russian dressing and boneless, skinless chicken breasts. The sauce was very thick but perfect for even if you dry out the chicken.

I was very impressed with this recipe.  The only change I made was to use Thousand Island Dressing.  I thought it was sooo yummy.  My husband didn't like it as much as I did, but he does not like chicken thighs.  Next time I will use chicken breasts.

This was good, got a thumbs up from my hubby, my 12 yr old son and an eh..ok from my 15 yr old son.  I thought it was good, but not what I was expecting.  I baked 6 b/s breasts in a 13x9 pan, poured the sauce over all(rather than coating the pcs) and covered it as directed.  Cooked for 1 hour, which was probably about 10 to 15 min's too long.  Next time I make these I will just coat the chicken and bake them on a cookie sheet with an edge or just not cover them.  The sauce came out on the thin side so I reduced it down in a pan on the stove.  My sauce wasn't as red and didn't coat the chicken like the picture, but it tasted really good with yellow rice!  Thanks for the easy recipe!

We really liked this for something different. I used b/l s/l chicken breasts instead of the thighs, but kept the rest of the recipe exactly the same. The chicken came out very moist and flavorful. I will be making this again! Thanks for posting :)

Pretty good. Kids liked it served over rice. Made a lot of sauce. Similar in taste to the bavarian meatballs recipe on this site, probably because of the cranberry sauce. Will make again though.

Very easy and tasty!  I too mixed the onion soup, cranberry sauce, and dressing (used spicey French) together ahead of time to let the onion bits soften and flavors blend.  I may cut down on the dressing the next time, because it did make a lot of the sauce.  I added some red pepper flakes just before cooking, and it tasted a lot like some of the Chinese chicken dishes I've had.  Thanks for sharing! PS...I used boneless, skinless thighs...delicious.

I prepared this recipe for the first time June 2005. It was appealing because the simple directions and just 3 ingredients. After a busy day this was just what I was looking for. My family all liked it and I will make it again but I will substitute the gel cranberry sauce with whole cranberry sauce next time, I also added a dash of red pepper flakes. Mashed potatoes was a terrific side to the dish. Thanks Brenda, for a nice easy tasty recipe.

This is a quick and easy dish. I chunked the chicken breasts and used what I had on hand, I didn't have enough Russian dressing so I sub'd the rest(about 1/4)with Catalina. I used whole berry cranberry sauce and onion/mushroom soup mix. I also added a some red pepper flakes to the sauce. I made plain rice and served the chicken/sauce over top. Baked some sweet potatoes as a side dish.

I was surprised how good this was!  I used 1/4 cup each mayo and ketchup instead of bottled dressing.  Cut the chicken breasts into strips and cooked for 40 minutes.  My 2 year old asked for seconds!  We'll use this recipe again.  Might try making homemade cranberry sauce and using that next time.

Loved this dish!  Very easy to make -- even for the pick husband who doesn't like chicken with things "dumped" on them.  Thank you!

This was absolutely fabulous!!!! It was loved by all in my family.  I made it with pasta noodles in a mushroom butter sauce and had a salad on the side.  I used boneless chicken thighs and the meat was soooooo tender.  A definate keeper!

I had leftover cranberry sauce and did not know what to do with it.  This recipe is easy and taste great.  I did not have Russian dressing so I  used great western.  I made the sauce hours ahead of time as someone suggested to let the onion soup become concentrated.  The chicken breast will be happy to have this sauce.  Thanks!

Easy and very good. I used boneless, skinless thighs, but this would be great with any skin-on pieces, especially if the skin is exposed during the uncovered final 15 minutes.

I was skeptical of this recipe with the odd combination of ingredients, but it was easy and delicious (and a great way to use the can of whole cranberries that have been sitting in my pantry since Thanksgiving)!  I did not have Russian dressing so I made it using 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1/4 cup ketchup, 2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar, and 2 Tbsp onion powder.  After coating the chicken, I poured the rest of the sauce in the dish to cook, and this made the chicken very tender.  Also, the sauce is delicious over rice.  I will definitely make this again!

I did this chicken in the crock pot and the chicken came out very tender.  The taste of the sauce was okay, nothing spectacular.  Will do the recipe again because it was quick and easy.

This was ok.  I followed the ingredients exactly but cooked it on the stove instead of the oven.  I felt that the onion soup mix took away from the flavors of the dressing and cranberry.  I will try it again and substitute 1/4 of cup of chopped/minced fresh onion for the soup mix and see if I like it better.

We liked this quite a bit, but still felt that it was missing "something." So the next time I added a pinch or about 1/8 t. red pepper flakes, and 3/4 t. chili powder (added by 1/4 tsp to taste). Now it's 5 stars! Also I never use canned cranberry sauce just because I think it's gross, and it's ridiculously easy to make your own with fresh or frozen cranberries. Plus then you also have complete control of how much total sugar is used! Solves that too-sweet problem if the dressing you choose is plenty sweet already.

I was given this recipe by my cousin years back and it is a family favorite! I make it exactly as this recipe states and I wouldn't change a thing.  It is so easy and super quick, perfect for a week night meal.  The chicken is so tender and tasty, high recommend trying this recipe.  I just make broccoli as a side with this meal for a healthy alternative to mash potatoes and the sauce over the broccoli gives it a delicious flavor!

I went the lazy route and used frozen chicken breasts.  I poured the sauce over the breasts and cooked at 375 degrees for an hour.  The chicken was delicious, and the sauce was good served over Israeli couscous.  Both my husband and I were very pleased.  As good as the chicken was, I believe the original recipe would be better, and I intend to try that next time.

I thought I'd try this recipe because there were several good reviews, and the odd ingerdients sparked my interest. It didnt seem they would go together, but I gave it a shot - they did NOT go together in any way shape or fashion. I followed this recipe to the T (though used whole cranberry sauce) and sampled the 'mixture' prior to adding chicken. I thought the funky taste might change with cooking. The pan came out of the oven with a very strange, offputting smell. This was the WORST recipe I have EVER tried - dont waste your time, money, or chicken on this FLOP!

Yes our family use this recipe often. We add dried onion soup with garlic to ours. I also boil down the cranberries, dressing and soup 
to thicken it before we add all together.

I am sorry that I could give this no stars. I am writing as I eat this dish. I only made 3 small chicken breasts so I cut down on everything else. Was very Leary about the onion soup mix, Should not have added it. I should have just thrown the can of cranberry sauce over the chicken. I have never had a bad recipe on this site. Guess there is a first time for everything. If I had anything else for dinner I would be eating it instead of this. Sorry :(

This was really good! I didn't expect to like this so much because when I was mixing the ingredients together it didn't smell too appetizing. I used breasts instead of thighs and cooked mine for an hour. I uncovered it the last 15 minutes and that helped thicken up the sauce. Definitely will make again.

LOVED this chicken.  As per other users, I mixed the sauce up early and stuck in the refrigerator.  I was running short on time when it came time to acutally bake -so cut up chicken in bite sized pieces (I used 5 boneless skinless chicken breasts since I'm not crazy about dark meat)....then I tossed the chicken in the sauce until well covered.  I poured the entire mixture in a 9 X 13 sprayed with Pam and baked uncovered for 45 minutes.  It was delicious!  We ate it over brown rice and served with green beans and a salad.  I've already bought more Russian dressing and cranberry sauce (with whole berries!) to keep on hand for the next time I'm ready to throw this quick and easy recipe together.

I have had this recipe for years and love it for an easy dinner.  I use light Catalina dressing, not Russian, whole canned cranberries when I want more texture, and have changed to using chicken breasts (the normal 3 pack) and then cut them up into smaller pieces so I can serve this over rice.

I made this for my mother a few years back.. it has since been added to our Thanksgiving Day cook out.  Sometimes I use the cranberry sauce with berries too.

It's an acquired taste.  The onion soup was a bit much and it wasn't as fruity as I was expecting.  Horrible, but I won't make it again.

This was a simple and very tasty meal. Threw frozen boneless skinless thighs in the crockpot with sauce on top and a few hours later dinner was served. Made some rice and the gravy made from the sauce is soooo good...Thanks for this recipe

We love this recipe (given to me at a bridal shower) and have been enjoying it for over 5 years now.  One tip: I bake it at 350F, uncovered for 45 minutes and the chicken comes out much more tender and completely baked through.  This version seems to make it dry.

Love this!  You can prepare it and not cook and store it in your freezer and pull it out whenever you need a quick meal and it turns out fabulous!!!  If I'm making it fresh I try to marinate it overnight first...it's so yummy!

This dish was so good!  I used boneless skinless chicken breast instead of thighs, as that's what I had on hand.  That's the only alteration I made.  The sauce made for such a great flavor in the chicken.  I will definitely be adding this dish to my regular rotation.

this sause is fantastic. i have tried many recipies off this site, and this is the first i have really loved. i did'nt change the sause a bit. i baked the chicken thighs a little different then specified, as i did'nt want all the fat from the thighs. i sprayed a 9x11 dish whith pam and added 8 bonein chicken thighs ,skin removed. covered with foil and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. drained access fat and juice. on the stove top i mixed sause ingrediants while baking, and simmered to hidrate the onions in the soup mix. poured sause over chicken and made sure the bottom was coated. put foil back on,and baked another 25 minutes. took foil off and chicken out of dish. made a thickener with 1/4 cup of water and 2 tabs of cornstarch  stired well. slowly adding to sause to thicken. i put the chicken back in, and spooned sause over, backed another 10 minutes. took chicken out, and spooned sause over. delicious. thank you

Tasted too much like bbq chicken. Was expecting to taste more of the cranberry. It did come off the bone, it was that juicy.

Very good and VERY easy. I did marinate overnight, baked with foil for 1 hour 15 minutes and 15 minutes without foil. Served with mashed potatoes. Entire family loved it.

this recipe is so easy and delicious.  i usually have everything on hand.  i pull the fat from the thighs because of the fat drippings are excessive otherwise.  i broil for a few minutes to caramelize the dressing on top of the chicken.

This is excellent. I served with wild rice topped with sauce--my husband said it was the best chicken dish he's ever had. I used fat free Catalina dressing and whole berry cranberry sauce and it was great.

The onion soup mix completely overpowered the taste of the cranberries.  I tried this with pork chops (pork and cranberries sounded more of a match than chicken) and it wasn't that great.  I'll try it again with MUCH MORE cranberry sauce.

My family thought it sounded strange and gingerly put knife and fork to the chicken and tasted it and...they loved it! I served it with white rice and a clean-out the fridge(assorted vegetables)w/zucchini stir fry. It's a keeper here!!!

Followed directions exactly but we did not care for the sauce at all.  Just a personal preference.  The chicken was nice and tender though.  Thanks for letting us try.

This  was good, not spectacular.  Very easy which I appreciated, but a little weird tasting.  My husband always takes leftovers to work but wanted nothing to do with this.  I suggest you try this when chicken is on sale, I only paid $1.99/pound for chicken breasts, so I wasn't too upset that this wasn't as fab as I hoped. Thanks anyway.

I used Thousand Island dressing instead of Russian, because that's what I had on hand. This is a great dish, served up with rice and peas cooked in chicken broth. The sauce is fantastic over rice. Thanks Brenda!

Absolutely delicious!  My 11-year old raced back to the kitchen for the last piece of chicken. Rice is a must for the sauce!! Used boneless, skinless chicken thighs..very tender & tasty.

This seemed like a strange combination of ingredients but I had everything in the house so I tried it. It turned out very good, it couldn't be any easier to make. It's fun to try new things and chicken can be fixed so many different ways. This is a keeper!

This was sooooo good (note: I used boneless skinless breasts instead of thighs)!!! I bet it has potential for being done in the slow cooker too... I didn't have russian dressing so I used a mix of bottled coleslaw dressing and bottled thousand island dressing.  Two words: YUM and EASY!!

My grandma has been making this dish for years! It’s a family favorite. There are only a few small differences: she marinates the chicken in the prepared sauce for at least 2 hours; she sprinkles a little garlic powder on; and she uses drumettes (mini drum sticks).                                                                                   I made it earlier this week, but I used chicken breasts. Yum!

We loved the flavor but did not trust the cooking time.  At 350 degrees it was at 163 degrees internal after 58 min.  It then raised to 165 by the time we served.  Perfect.

I have made this for many years using Catalina dressing and serving over rice.  It is so simple and easy, but the presentation with a side of steamed asparagus, is company worthy.  I like the dark meat, but my husband doesn't, so I make it with chicken breast and it is good that way too.  You won't be disappointed either way.

Really good! I served it over rice. I made street tacos the next day with the leftover chicken and added fresh cilantro, tomatoes and lime. So good!

OMG this is what I will make for Thanksgiving from now on!  I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs, Catalina dressing (because that is what I had in the pantry), onion-mushroom dry soup mix (again, what I had in the pantry) and leftover cranberry-fig compote. I eyeballed about 1 cup of the Catalina and spooned in about a 1 1/2 cups of the cranberry-fig compote, stirred in the soup mix. Put the thighs in a baking dish, covered with the cranberry mixture, and baked covering the dish with foil. After 30 minutes I turned the chicken over and returned to the oven. In another 15 minutes I inserted a meat thermometer and the chicken was done, but I hadn't started the sides, so I removed the foil and returned the baking dish to the oven, but turned off the heat. I served with rice and Brussels sprouts. So delicious!

I have been making this basic recipe for over 20 years.  I often make it when I am taking a dinner to someone who has a new baby/is sick to rave reviews.  I use whole berry cranberry sauce (but have used jellied in a pinch) and use homemade sauce during cranberry season.  I use russian/catalina dressing (seems to be the same thing to me).  I am watching salt intake, so only 1/2 package of onion soup mix for me.  If I have some, I will add a glug of red wine to the sauce mix as well.  I have made it with boneless breasts, bone-in breasts and a cut up chicken, you just varying your baking time.

I had to make the Russian style salad dressing from scratch. I could not find it in the store. I feel like maybe my sauce was too thick but it still tastes great. I would do this recipe again.

I make mine in the crock pot,  cut the chicken into smaller chunks and cook on high for an hour or low for 1-2 hours to make the sauce thicker and richer. I make it using 2 bottles of dressing, 2 packs of soup mix, and one full can of cranberry jelly as we all go NUTS for the sauce.  We freeze it to use later over left over rice or just garlic butter on toast.  If you have troubles finding Russian dressing like i do, you can use Catalina dressing as well. My favorite way to serve it is over mashed potatoes that are made with ranch mixed in. (sounds weird but is so delicious and creamy paired with the chicken)

We have made this recipe a few times and my young children loved it.  The only drawback is that while cooking, the window needs to be open in the kitchen with a large fan.  We discovered that baking with cranberry sauce is a very stinky process.  It is well worth it if you can get past the smell.  (next time, we are going to try our home made cranberry sauce)

Although I did not think this was a five star, gourmet recipe, we thought it was great and one that will be made over and over again in our home. I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs and coked it covered for one hour, turned the oven off and it sat in the oven for another half hour.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Chicken was so tender we only needed a fork to cut it. Served it with mashed potatoes.  Love recipes like this, easy and delish!   What a winning combo!

Looking at the ingredients list you would assume this would taste odd but it was exceptionally tasty! This is going to be a autumn/winter favorite. It's great with herb couscous or rice. This couldn't be easier!

This was absolutely fantastic.  My boys looked at it a little funny at first, but went back for seconds and said it was very good - nothing was left!  I used a can of cranberry sauce, Russian dressing, and a packet of savory herb and garlic soup mix, because I didn't have any onion soup in the house. I used about 8 boneless chicken thighs.  It went very well with mashed potatoes.

Made this for my mom, usually I hate cranberry anything but I gotta say, This was actually quite good, will make this again. It's good to have rice with this for soaking up all the juicy sauce.

I am a novice cook and, for me, this was a SUPER easy dinner to throw together and everyone liked it!! My dad kept saying how yummy it was and went back for seconds, and then thirds!! I did mine in the crock pot, like some other reviewers did, and it turned out wonderful!! Don't be fooled by the odd ingredients!!

Made this in the crock pot and cooked on low for 4 hours.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I felt it was missing something, just not sure what.  It reminded me a little of chinese sweet and sour, so maybe some pineapple and some veggies.

After reading all the reviews, I decided I had to try this. Not a big Russian dressing kinda girl so I tried one pan using catalina, and one pan using thousand island. I split the onion soup mix between the two pans because it can get overpowering sometimes. I used chicken breast tenderloins(what I had handy)425 45 minutes. First the thousand island review.. decent but probably wont make again, and I have  been using thousand island my whole life nothing else. Next the catalina, LOVED IT! Im only sad I didnt put more chicken in that pan for leftovers. Reguardless whichever dressing you decide to use, you will have plenty of sauce for rice! And very glad I do. It was fantastic with catalina.Will be making this again very soon! Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely loved this!  As Russian Style salad dressings are not available in South Africa, I made the Russian Style Creamy Salad Dressing from AR.  Excellent!  (Bonus now is that this salad dressing is also fantastic for prawn cocktails!).

Very easy to make and very tasty.  Used only 1/2 pack of the onion soup mix.  I can see how the whole pack would be overkill.  Made with white rice and butternut squash.  The rice is an absolute must to enjoy the extra sauce.  Almost tasted like Chinese duck sauce on the rice.   Sooooo good!!

Good things- healthy, cheap, pretty.  Bad things- not that tasty just moderately good. Not something I'd crave. Really I just didn't care for the taste. As my husband said- "It's better than some things you've made"

I used chicken breasts, but did NOT like the flavor of this dish at all.  I guess I assumed it would taste sweet with the cranberry sauce.  But, it was too sweet for me.

My family and I just didn't care for the flavor.  But maybe that is because we have always loved the recipe that uses apricot jam instead of cranberries.

Declicious and very moist. Loved the sauce and there was plenty. I used chix breasts and Thousand Isand dressing.  Also used homemade cranberry sauce l/o from Thanksgiving (recipe from this site) and I was short 4 oz so I used Cranberry Jam made from green tomatoes (also from this site). Family loved it.

After looking at the ingredents, I was somewhat skeptical, but I ecided to try it.  Wow I sure am glad I did.  I used leftover cranberry sauce and made my own russian dressing.  It was fabulous.  I love sweet and savory tigether and this hit it just right.   My husband loved it too.  Next time I made some garlic, just because I love garlic.  Thanks for such a strange and really tasty dish.

My son actually liked it and gave it 3 stars- My husband and I = 1 star only-- He ate only 1 bite- definitely an aquired taste- We thought it smelt bad, looked bad and tasted bad- sorry- others have liked it though and maybe you will too.

Very very good.  I would give it a 5 but my fiancee didn't care for it as much as I did.  I used Light Italian instead of Russian and I used chicken breasts.  YUM YUM.

A keeper this will be as my dh just could not stop raving all during dinner as to how tasty this dish was. He thought the complete menu of Cranberry Sauce Chicken II, mashed potatoes from scratch, fresh corn on the cob, fresh made cranberry sauce from All Recipes, cole slaw, iced tea was great. But the star was the Cranberry Sauce Chicken II. We all enjoyed the surprise of a new chicken dish.  I did not change a thing in this recipe. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs that were in the freezer from my supermarket when on sale.  This is my first attempt at boneless, skinless chicken thighs. They were moist, fork tender and of course the flavor of the sauce was so yummy.  The ingredients were strange, as others have commented, but the end results are well worth a recipe that I would recommend you try.  Not only easy to prepare, but not a lot of attending to while baking. (Only to remove the foil the last part of baking and I do recommend this step.) I did use a thermometer for testing the internal temp to make sure they were done, as the sauce did make it difficult to check the juices running clear. Oh yes, I did use the whole cranberry sauce. Thank you Honda for sharring this recipe.

Yummy!!  Very light, sweet and fruity.  I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts, and a can of whole berry cranberry sauce; otherwise, I followed the instructions as written, and it came out perfect!  There is plenty of sauce, so I suggest making rice as a side dish so you can pour some over it.

This was surprisingly good!  As the weather changed and we could not barbeque, I needed a recipe using 2 bone-in chicken breasts.  Because I didn't have Russian dressing I substituted with  1/4 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup mayo as I was using only half the recipe.  I put the cranberry mixture under the skin as well as on top.  I cooked them for 1 hour in a stoneware rectangular baker with the lid on.  They turned out to be the most juiciest, flavorful chicken breasts ever.

This recipe was a little too soupy for me. I used 3/4 c of russian dressing and 9-not 6 chicken thighs. There was a lot of liquid. I recommend using more chicken or less dressing for the recipe. It was a little too "onion soup mix-ish" so I may cut back on that next time as well and use 1/2 envelope. My point is this recipe can be changed easily to suit your taste and still be great. My husband loved it. I served it with a side of kasha pilaf. Yum!

I loved how easy this was to make. Everyone loved the flavor. It did make a lot of sauce, so we served the sauce over mashed potatoes. Yummy!

I wasn't crazy about this. Because of the easy prep and minimal ingredients, however, I wanted to give it a try. I work in Chicago, and am usually not home until sometime b/t 7:00 - 7:30 p.m. on most weekdays, so anything that can be ready to pop into the oven when I walk in the door is a keeper. I prepared this on Thursday night to give the sauce ingredients time to blend together (it allows the onions in the soup mix to soften). Dinner was ready in an instant on Friday evening! In lieu of chicken thighs I used chicken breasts. My bf liked this (which surprises me b/c he HATES fruit, especially cranberry sauce), but he wasn't wowed.  I think he'd eat it again, but I woulldn't, so (since I do the cooking), it probably won't make it to our table again. The chicken was dry and bland (except for the sauce). The sauce is yummy over long grain & wild rice and the dish pairs nicely with peas and dinner rolls on the side. Thanks for sharing!

I've had this recipe since Sept. of 2001, but I never reviewed it, it was well liked then and is still very well liked.  Thanks for taking the time for this wonderful recipe.

We made a large batch of this recipe and also of Cranberry Sauce Chicken 1 (on this site). This was chicken thighs with skin on. It was very good but it accumulated a lot of grease, which we drained off. The sauce was tasty and creamy, but I would prefer it more tangy.

I may try different soup mixes next time. The onion was a bit much for us. All in all, a good mid-week recipe. Quick and simple.

Wonderfully delicious.  Served on Thanksgiving Day to a group who didn/t want Turkey.
