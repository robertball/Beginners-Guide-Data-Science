The batter was too dry and it was a dense pastey mess when it came out. I even cooked it for an hour in the oven to dry it out, but the inside remained raw

I really was surprised that these turned out so good. They taste buttery and vanilla-y, without being too artificial tasting. I was a little concerned after adding the eggs to the creamed butter/stevia mixture, as it went from smooth and fluffy to odd and granular. I really thought I'd done something wrong; but continued on with the recipe, and the batter did look better after adding the milk and flour mixture. I got exactly 12 cupcakes, and they baked in exactly 20 minutes. I also did not grease the cupcake liners, and I had no issues with them sticking. The whipped frosting is ok, but I think I prefer the cupcakes without it.
