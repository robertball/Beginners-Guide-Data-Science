I've been searching for and cooking recipes on this site for a couple of years but have never written a review.  This one pot chili mac was so good I decided to finally get around to setting up account.  The only thing I changed was very minor.  Used petite diced tomatoes in place of rotel (all I had on hand), added about two tablespoons chopped peppers and served cheese on side just because hubby doesn't really like it cooked in.  Very quick and easy! Also delicious!  Will definitely make this again!

Good basic recipe. I wanted it to taste more like chili, so I altered the spices: 2 tsp oregano, 2 tsp paprika, 1 tsp crushed red pepper, 1 T cumin, and 1/4 cup chili powder. Reduced the broth to 1 1/2 cup and increased pasta to 3 cups uncooked.

I had some ground beef and didn't know what to do with it. This was fast and easy and from everything I already have in the pantry (except chili beans, I used black beans). Mild enough flavor for the kids.
And who doesn't appreciate having only 1 pot to clean? Love that

My family was wary, but pleasantly surprised by how much they liked this meal.  I chose it over other recipes for the one-pot preparation.  We liked that it wasn't super chili-flavored.  It had its own unique taste.  We did not want it to just be chili with macaroni added.  The only change I made was to skip the beans and add a can of corn.    And I probably added a lot more cheese than 3/4 cup - probably twice that in finely shredded taco-style cheese.  It melted nicely.  I also added some green onions I had on hand when I added the parsely.   I'll be making again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Perfect chilly night, comfort food!! I have made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe to a T. We really enjoyed it. The second time I subbed beef broth,  in place of chicken broth, cannolini beans in place of Chili beans and upped the macaroni to 2 cups, so it would be a little less soupy.  My family liked it the first time and LOVED it the second time.  This is a definite keeper!!

I used a package of Chili Seasoning Mix  as a short cut and to pump up the kick a bit. Excellent comfort food recipe if you are looking to indulge.

I am afraid I have become one of THOSE reviewers, who makes a bunch of changes and then gives the recipe a less than perfect score.  Just hear me out . . . 

Overall, a great weeknight meal option!  Extremely easy to make, especially because one can prep most of the ingredients (e.g. chop the onion and garlic, shred the cheese, etc.) in advance.  As for my changes:

a)  I used beef broth instead of chicken broth.  It seemed weird to me to use chicken broth in a beef-based recipe.

b)  Homemade marinara sauce.  The recommended Ragu option contains cheese, and in order to make this dish suitable for one particular family-member, it had to be dairy-free.

c)  Plain canned diced tomatoes, rather than the ones containing chilies.  For one, I didn't have canned diced tomatoes containing chilies on hand.  And for two, I made this recipe with a family member in mind who does not like any amount of spice in her food.

d)  Canned black beans, rather than chili beans, because this is what I had on hand.

I also added red and green pepper chunks prior to simmering.  

And as for the cheese, I served it on the side.

I did find the dish to be a *touch* bland, and in my experience, using diced tomatoes containing chilies and prepared pasta sauce wouldn't have changed this fact.  Next time, I will add more chili powder and perhaps a fresh diced jalapeno to suit my own taste.

Definitely recommended for when the cupboards are looking bare, this dish uses pantry staples and offers lots of roo

Good.  I used salsa instead of the tomatoes with green chilies, mostly because I didn't have any, but I like the addition of green peppers that the salsa gave.

My husband LOVED this! He asked me to please make it again. We're a gluten free family, so I used brown rice spiral pasta. I had to add a few extra splashes of chicken stock, probably an additional 1/2 cup. This was super easy and very tasty.

Used tomato paste and red pepper flakes instead of diced tomatoes since we don't like the texture of tomatoes. Also used half a regular white onion and pinto/kidney beans. So, I changed a lot, but it was really good. I think this recipe leaves a lot of room for creativity.

Good recipe! We ended up doubling the Chile powder and cumin and adding in a teaspoon of oregano. Even so it is a little on the bland side. It ended up being more of a soup than a pasta dish. Delish!

I made this for my boyfriend and I and it came out delicious. I am the type of person who doesn’t always stick to the recipe, but I did and I wasn’t disappointed. It was quick and easy to make, which was great because I don’t get home from work until 7 or 8. I will definitely make this again, and I may try different flavors besides Mexican. Maybe sloppy joe style? Or use my leftover baby back ribs from the slow cooker instead of Hamburg! I made the 6 serving recipe and it would be plenty for 4 adults. We had lots of leftover!

This recipe turned out great. 
  However, I made a few changes.
Additions and Substitutions - I  increased the cumin and chili powders by just a little bit more than a teaspoon and increased the macaroni to 2 cups.  Then I decreased the chicken broth to 1 3/4 cups.  (The other reviews were right, it makes too much juice if you add 2 cups of broth so I decreased it).  I also substituted black beans for the chili beans and drained both the beans and diced tomatoes.  Otherwise this is a perfect mac/cheese dish.  Enjoy!!!

This recipe is delicious and very easy to put together - especially great if you're having a busy day and really don't have too much time to cook.  I followed the directions closely. I did not have any macaroni so I used "mezzi rigatoni". I'm glad I did. I used about two cups. It turned out great.  Also, love the fact that the dinner was made using one pot.  Easy clean up!
Thanks for the terrific recipe!

This is an easy, tasty recipe. When I went to make it, I realized I didn't have chili powder, so I improvised with some ancho chili powder, chipotle chili powder and a little extra cumin. It gave it a little kick, but wasn't overpowering. It reminded me of Wendy's chili with macaroni.

This is Hamburger Helper before that existed. It is one pot to clean , using things in the  average pantry .  I substitute 1  15 oz can tomato sauce ,for the Ragu(R} sauce , put a  Tablespoon of chili powder and  1 teaspoon of hot chili powder because my family likes heat  Cumin was at  1 1/2  teaspoon. Tasted like thin chili As per other reviews went to 2 cups pasta ,might try a little more as it was still loose. Next day leftovers firmed up.

I like this recipe for dinner and leftovers. My preferences: I don’t add the entire onion, I’m not picky about the spaghetti sauce brand, I stir the cheese into individual servings, I don’t use the parsley. Very tasty and easy!

I added some bell peppers and jalapenos for more flavor. The original recipe does still sound pretty awesome sauce though. Oh and I doubled the cheese. The person who said it ended up being more like a soup was not following directions at all.

Added green pepper, just because I had some.  Used beef broth instead of chicken and upped the pasta to 3 cups.  Used pinto beans instead of chili beans. Added 1 tsp of Italian seasoning, 1 tsp onion powder, pinch of garlic powder.  Delicious!

Great hardy dish. Added diced green pepper with the garlic and onion. Did not have any green chilies used 3 jalapeño peppers, the entire jar of spaghetti/pasta sauce, added 3 fresh diced tomatoes and a can of drain sweet corn the last 5 minutes before being done

This was so yummy! The perfect comfort food for a rainy day. Our family likes a bit more spice so I doubled the chili powder and cumin as other reviews suggested and it was perfect.

came out great I did add a diced red and orange bell pepper to the mix and I mixed Bison with some grass fed ground beef. All in all many thanks, kids were hesitant, but once one showed satisfaction the rest of them followed!

This was not good..... it was fantastic. Two of us ate ALL of it in less than two days.  Two football games is all it took.
I made a few adjustments:
I used organic, grass fed beef
I used organic tri bean medley (kidney, chili, black)
I used organic chicken broth
I used 1 tablespoon of chili powder not 1 teaspoon
When the chili was done, I did add the remainder (like 2oz) of Ragu and another cup of chicken broth.  We like our chili a little thinner and wet.  
This is going to be a new staple in our house because it was unbelievable how good it was.

Had to substantially increase the spices.  Not what I was looking for but was still tasty.  Still looking for the correct recipe to mimic what I have had before at a cookout.

I used tomato sauce instead of Ragu, I also cooked my elbows before putting them in the sauce to get the starch out of them. I added about 1-1/2 Tsp. of Cayenne Pepper. It turned out great with just a touch of  heat. I will keep this in the front of my recipes.

Very good! It’s a quick and easy meal that tastes good too. I added some extra cheese and macaroni to make it a little less liquidy.

This turned out great!  I used dried chopped onions because I just don't keep fresh ones around, and I skipped the parsley because who wants that stuff in their teeth anyway?  Everything else was as stated in the recipe and my family loved it. Will definitely make it again!

This was a huge hit with my wife and son, and very easy to make. I added a generous amount of shredded Tex-Mex cheese to each serving and let it melt. I will also probably add more macaroni next time, but that's just a personal preference. Great recipe.

Good, hearty meal that was easy to make. I substituted plain tomato sauce for the sauce called for and did not add cheddar. Instead I garnished with grated Muenster that I had on hand and it was really good.

Super easy and requires minimal time while cooking. Altered this slightly to give it some heat. Used (i) Ro Tel Chili Fixin's Seasoned Diced Tomatos with Green Chillies, (ii) Bush's Chili Beans (Pinto Beans in Medium Chili Sauce), and (iii) substituted Chili Seasoning Mix II from this site for chili powder. This would be too spicy for some but perfect for us. This dish turned out better than expected, and placed in the rotation folder.

Did not have tomatoes with chilies so I just used 15 oz can diced tomatoes and added 1 tablespoon of hot sauce to it. Also increased chili powder to 1 tablespoon just because of my personal preference.

I used this recipe as a substitute for my "go to" because I A) misplaced it and didn't want to take the time to hunt it down and B) like to compare recipes every now and again. This was simple enough to make and tasted fine but there was nothing particularly exciting about it.

I forgot the chili beans called for, but we didn't miss them at all. This is super easy to make, and very flavorful. Just the right amount of heat for my somewhat sensitive family. We will definitely make this again!

I've made this before exactly as written and it was good. This time I added 3 cups elbow mac because I use the small Dreamfields brand (low carb) and extra chili powder. I was much better!

I read through the reviews, and followed KelC's suggestions (except for the chili powder - cut that down significantly, for my family's taste) - it was a hit with my four year old, my one year old ate a bunch, and my husband and I both enjoyed it a lot!
I also added some carrots and corn, as both my kids love them, and I knew it would make it more appealing to them.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is a very easy and delicious meal.  I used petite diced with celery and onions and wheat noodles.  I also increased the chili powder and cumin and added cheyenne pepper.  It's very hearty and thickens up after it sits for a few minutes. My kids tried to scoff because of the wheat noodles, but they couldn't taste a difference after I made them try it.

Whole family liked it, including my 6 yr old.  I used whole wheat pasta & increased to 2 cups, omitted the beans & used a whole 8 oz. pkg of shredded cheddar Jack cheese.  Even better with dollop of sour cream, will definitely make again, will be great during the colder months!!  Thank you for sharing! :)

This was really good for being so fast and easy. You don't really have high expectations for a dish like chili Mac, but I was impressed. Hubby loved it and so did the kiddo! I made a couple of changes because of ingredients I didn't have on hand. I used regular canned tomatoes and chopped up a fresh banana pepper from the garden. And I also used my own homemade pasta sauce that had a little ground sausage in it. This meal was excellent and I will definitely make it again!

Such an easy recipe and so good! Have made it twice this month and will definitely keep it in the fall/winter rotation. Everyone in the house loved it, including my picky eater who is not a big fan of tomato. He did ask if I would add more pasta next time I made it, which I did last night. I increased to 2 cups and we all enjoyed it! Having only one pot for easy clean up was also a plus!

It was pretty good as written. My kid liked it as well.  Next time I may use beef broth instead of chicken. It should make the camping rotation as well. Defiantly worth a try.

Made it today for dinner.  Loved it. But im not so sure about the consistency. It was more gooey than the given picture, giving the feeling that the pasta is overcooked and therefore all mushed up.

My picky family of 6 (ages 8 to adult) all loved this recipe. I followed it, just adding spices and Worcestershire.  I will definitely make it again. The kids asked for seconds.  Oh, and some of us added sour cream

Great recipe, super simple and straightforward. Awesome to make for a weeknight dinner.

Made some broccoli to go with it and we had a perfect dinner!
