I am rating this on the version that I made.  This dip was wonderful, and one friend at the party I brought it to said that I was not allowed to bring the leftovers home.  The only things I did differently was to put the sour cream on plain (no taco mix) and I made homemade guacomole that I put on top of the sour cream.  So the layers went beans, sour cream, guacomole, salsa, veggies and cheese.  I think the homemade guacomole really adds to this dip, and makes the use of the taco packet not really necessary, since you don't want too many competing flavors going on.  Thanks for the recipe...I will use it often!!

This is the best layered dip I've made.  Everyone loved it.  I did use only 2 cans of beans & would recommend that.  Also I added 4oz cream cheese to the sour cream mixture for extra flavor.  This is a LARGE recipe, so you might concider cutting it in half.

I made this recipe for my birthday fiesta and it turned out great.  I didn't use the lettuce.  I used Rosarita vegetarian beans, light sour cream, and taco shredded cheese mix.  I think this recipe works best with a chunky, not so saucy salsa.  I used Pace Chipotle Thick and Chunky.  It was a hit!  My husband and I loved it so much, we made it again the next day!

Whenever I make this dish the pan is always wiped clean. We use a can of Rotel tomatoes, one can of beans, and taco flavored cheese. This takes hardly any time to prepare.

I felt a can of chili without beans added more zest to the recipe than the refried beans.Good Recipe, Cindy. Thanks.

I make this all the time...and it is always received well.  I omit the olives and add tomatoes instead.  Also use a mexican blend of shredded cheese instead of just cheddar.  Thanks for the post.

The husband and kids inhaled this. I cut this recipe in half and made one extra layer with last night's taco meat (gets rid of leftovers and makes a yummy dip for the boys--win/win!) and I used green onions, reduced fat sour cream, homemade taco seasoning and homemade salsa. Huge hit. When I got back from coffee with the girls, it was gone. This was a snap to assemble in the morning and cover with foil before I left.

The submitter of this recipe has requested that we change the amount of salsa listed in the ingredients from 1 (20 ounce) jar to 1/2 cup. She writes: "spread a thin layer of salsa over the beans, and then add the other ingredients." This will take care of the sogginess that some reviewers have noted! - The Staff

Best taco dip I've ever had!! I also went with 2 cans of beans and yes you have to cut the lettuce very finely.  Also, changing the layers to: beans, lettuce, salsa, sour cream, olives, cheese helped hold things together if you're worried about ease of dipping.  Making it a little in advance will also allow the lettuce to absorb some liquid, which helps to make dipping easier.  I added some coriander and cumin in addition to the taco seasoning, skipped the tomatoes and used extra salsa, and opted for low fat sour cream and cheese, then topped it with a few canned jalapeno slices.  Yum.

I gave this 4 stars because I thought this had great potential.  I thought there were too many beans and I only used 2 cans.  Next time I make this I will use 1 can of refried beans and double the sourcream and use 3 pks of taco seasoning for added zest.  I didn't use salsa at all but put lots of fresh tomatoes lettuce. I will definitely make this again.

This is my recipe, I should have put in the directions that you don't use the whole jar of salsa, only a light layer over the ingredients that are assembled. This recipe gets rave reviews. I used to take it to work on the Oncology floor where I worked, the whole pan and 2 large bags of tostitos would be gone before 10am!

I've taken this dip to two parties recently and it was a big hit.  I modified the recipe and used only 2 cans of beans and left out the onion.

This dip was flavorful, but called for way too much refried beans! I used 1 and 1/2 to 2 cans...three made it much too thick!

This is a great recipe.  I have made for several different occasions and it is always a big hit.  I only used 2 cans of refried beans, omitted the lettuce and added a container of Guacamole.  It added some great flavor.  This is always at the top of my list when I bring a dish to a party.

This is a great recipe! I substituted spicy refried beans for extra flavor. I added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning to the sour cream and made the guacamole from scratch with lime juice and garlic salt. I used a can of Rotel in place of the tomato. This recipe is easy to make substitutions according to taste.

I used 2 cans and it was still too much beans for our tastes.  I would suggest adding cream cheese to the sour cream and at least a cup of salsa-you could barely taste it.

Good recipe. I brought this to an outdoor party. It was quite warm out and the dip became soupy. The flavor was good and people (especially the kids) liked this but it looked gross after only a couple of hours.

This recipe was quick, easy, and tasted great. I made it last night for a party, and everyone loved it. This would be great to serve for football games. I substituted 2 green onions for onion called for in the recipe to add a little more color. I think next time I will only use 2 cans of beans. 3 cans seemed to be too much in comparison with the amounts of the other ingredients.

I have tried this recipe and first tasted it in the early '80s... it was called Tex-Mex dip and I was happy to get the recipe. 
On one occasion I made this for a pot luck without looking at the recipe and thought it had browned hamburger meat in it so did that and mixed it in with the beans and taco seasoning (instead of putting seasoning in the sour cream)... It was still a hit but more like a main course instead of an appetizer!  So, I give this recipe 5 stars for its versatility and appeal.

I should have read the reviews first.  Although the taste was wonderful, it did become a soupy mess that looked quite unappetizing.  Will make again with a few changes.

This makes a lot of dip and I had a lot left over. Tasted great, though. Next time I'd only make a half recipe for my crowd.

I'm a racing fan, and so are my friends; NASCAR, CART, IRL, F-1, it doesn't matter. Sundays are really full for us. I tried this really easy Taco Dip, as an alternative from my usual chips and store bought dip, and I'm a real hero now..and the leftovers, when there are any, are even better on Monday.

This is a very easy and tasty dish to assemble!  I changed a few things... I only used 2 cans of refried beans, which was plenty.  I also substituted the sour cream for Greek yogurt for a healthier option.  I didn't have any salsa, but if I did, I would use something chunky instead of saucy.  I think green onions looked at tasted better.  Make sure that the chopped tomatoes are well drained because if the juices seep down to the yogurt, it may water down the consistency and make a mess.  The guests seemed to enjoy this dish.  I would definitely make this again!

A hit!  I used only 2 cans of beans, added a thin layer of salsa with lots of small diced avocado mixed in, then topped with sour cream, shredded iceberg lettuce, then cheese.  I forgot to mix in the taco seasoning to the sour cream but it was still awesome.  I think the lettuce gives it such a fresh taste.  Everyone loved it at our mountain weekend-it ended up being our lunch cause we couldn't stop eating it!

Everyone loved this recipe.  I modified it a bit.  I omitted the lettuce.  I used 2 pie plates and put one can of refried beans in each dish.  I then added guacamole.  Then layered it according to the recipe. Great loved it!!

This turned out very watery, even though I didn't use but 6 oz. of salsa.  The flavor was good, but it was hard to get past the watery appearance.  Maybe I did something wrong?

Huge hit. I chilled the beans, sour cream and salsa before topping with lettuce. I thought that worked well. I had actually never seen my teenage nieces eat ANYTHING before so I was pretty pleased.

Good. Too many beans to suit me, I think 2 cans would have worked better. Used reduced fat sour cream. My salsa was 16 oz and that worked fine. I used Rotel instead of fresh tomatoes (drained). As always, I buy the shredded bag lettuce. Thanks.

I made this for a group of 12 women, they started arriving before I was finished and I forgot to top with the cheese...They loved it!!  It was a big hit. I used 2 cans of beans and green onions.
I kept the rest the same, except the cheese. When my husband got home, he sprinkled cheese on the leftovers and loved it.
...Thanks for sharing.

I have made this dip for years.  I like putting 1 bell pepper and 1 tomato both chopped and pushed down into the beans, then add the other layers....it gives the dip a freshness and additional crunch. Do Not skip the step of mixing the taco seasoning with the sour cream....that is the main point/secret to this wonderful dip.

Okay in very small quantities.  Far too bland, and the ratio of beans and lettuce to other ingredients is too high.  The composition is nearly impossible to dip or scoop with anything but the largest tortilla chip, made so by the loose toppings.  The problem is made worse by not cutting the lettuce into the smallest bits.

Got RAVE reviews at my Halloween party.  2 cans of beans were plenty, and I used canned Mexican style tomatoes instead of chopped fresh ones.  Yum!

I use guacamole rather than lettuce.  I also chill the dip prior to adding the tomatoes, onions, and black olives.  (I rarely add the shredded cheese.)  I could eat it with a spoon (and have been known to do so!).

I tried this because of the high rating and was not disappointed!  I added 4 oz. extra cheese and one jalapeno and one banana pepper chopped;  I used green onions;  I used homemade refried beans;  and I left out the olives.  Everyone liked it!

Generally a good taste, but Way too many beans...cut back to at MOST 2 cans. Then avocado with pico mixed in, omitted the layer of tomatoes, then a layer of taco spiced sour cream, mexican blend shredded cheese, and olives. The more olives, the better!

WOW!!  Absolutely DELICIOUS!!  I made this with the Chicken Enchiladas II recipe from this site.  I didn't really change anything from this recipe.  For the salsa, I made D's Famous Salsa from this site & added a thin layer.  I ate so much of this dip, I could hardly move afterwards!

I found this recipe quite dull.  Used Rosarita vegetarian beans; they needed to be pepped up considerably, because just plain, they lie there on the plate like a big, unappealing blob-o-beans.  Another recipe online recommends using bean *dip* &  guacamole.  I will try that next time.

I made this for a party and all the guests loved it. For me it didn't have enough zip. I did only use 2 cans of refried beans..that was plenty, one can including chilis the other vegetarian. Next time I will use more chilis. Still yummy!

I love this dip!  The salsa made it kind of watery so the 2nd time I made it I did it without the salsa and chopped up roma tomatoes.  Also topped with green onions.  It still tasted great!

Another variation is to put the packet of taco seasoning into the beans rather than the sour cream.  I also mix into the beans a small can of diced green chiles, omit the lettuce, and add a layer of guacamole.

Delicious dip.  I used half a jar of spicy black bean dip and half a jar of medium spicy pinto bean dip and only half the taco seasoning mix.  I also omitted the lettuce, tomatoes, onion and olives because of personal preference.  I used quite a bit more cheese also.  Very delicious.

It was really good but just a little spicy for my tastebuds.  I will make it again but I will cut back on the taco seasoning.

I omitted the lettuce but followed the recipe for the rest. Everyone raved about it and I had to make another bowl after 10 minutes and was asked to provide the recipe and also bring it to a friends 4th of July party

I use the same ingredients (pretty much).  I use refried black beans and don't add onion (but want to try) for tostadas. I do add taco meat though and sometimes guacamole/avocado slices.
Delicious!!

A great starter recipe for your own interpretation.  I don't use lettuce ( it tends to get soggy) and I use green onions instead of white for less bite.

It was good...I used 2 cans of beans, mixed some cream cheese in with the sour cream and cut back a little on the lettuce.  I think for my personal taste I would have preferred less of the beans and maybe a thin layer of seasoned ground beef.

Turned out great! Taco Dip is actually one of the first recipes I learned from my roommate. I make it a little differently but save this as a grocery list reference tool. I agree with some other reviews that 2 cans is a good amount. I pair this with tostidos scoops and they can only tolerate so much dip. I mix the taco seasoning with the vegetarian beans and keep the sour cream plain. I like to keep the spice level mild so I don’t use the whole package, just measure to taste. You can also buy seasoned (original flavor) refried beans and skip the extra seasoning.  Read the labels at the store

I made this for a  carry in at work. It was a hit. 2 minor changes after Reading reviews I used only 2 cans of refried beans . I did drain the juice off the salsa to keep it from getting soupy. Otherwise I stuck with the original recipe. It goes great with taco seasoned hamburger and another girl brought taco seasoned crockpot chicken . Yum! Definitely going to be making it again and again.

Seemed to be a LOT of refried beans lol... But i also tried to add more salsa Bc it barelys covered a thin layer... Word of Advice... DONT haha... It made it quite mushy... But a little less refried beans would be beneficial... All in all, Great Start!

This was super simple, fast and a hit with everyone. I added a guacamole layer on the beans and didn't bother adding fresh tomatoes since i figured there was enough in the salsa. I had green onions, so I used that instead of red. I probably used a bit less taco seasoning than suggested. 
I made a second dip without salsa for someone who couldn't eat tomatoes, but the flavour of the dip got kind of bland omitting it, so I would take that into consideration if you don't like tomatoes.

I've made this recipe quite a few times and I keep losing the recipe! It's delicious - very fresh tasting and lighter than some of the other 7 layer type dips. We love this one and I'm so glad to have finally found and saved this recipe.

I used green onion instead of onion. I also only use 1 1/2 cans of re-fried beans. They are always asking me to bring this dip at work.  It is always a hit.

Made this taco dip many times, and it has been good every time. You may want to use less refried beans, maybe 2 cans instead of 3. You could also put the olives on top so people who dont want them can pick them off. Otherwise one of my favorite game day recipies!

Very yummy but I think the quantities may be a little off.  You can't do this with 1/2 cup of salsa.  I ended up using almost 2 cups.  And half a head of lettuce is a little excessive, especially since that's the ingredient that ends up on the floor most.  Other than that, it's a huge hit with my friends.

I have made this recipe many, many times for different functions and it is always a hit.  I only use one can of refried beans though because I don't like the beans to overpower the dish.

Made exactly as described and it was fabulous,  although a bit runny from the picante sauce.  This recipe made me realize I would prefer meat so I guess mine will have 8 layers :)

I am rating this recipe based on what I had for dinner, I just omited the beans, salsa and cheese. Instead i cooked a fish fillet with cushed redpepper and eggplant sauce and served over rice. Not really a dip, but tasted good.
