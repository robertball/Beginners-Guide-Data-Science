Great dish for vegan, if you are calorie conscious add more of mushrooms and vegetables instead of rice

I don't really know how to rate this one fairly but I will give it my best shot. The most important thing I am going to point out is that the same cook time for raw carrots and canned peas is no good. Canned peas are already mush and fresh carrots would be underdone. What I did was mix everything together except for the peas and carrots. You can buy frozen in a mix together and then just stir them in on the last 10 minutes of cook time. While the onion soup mix would be great for a college student or someone with limited spices,  I didn't care for it and will use my own seasonings next time. Overall it was okay but I highly recommend buying the frozen peas and carrots and added them in later. It makes it easier on you that way too.
