When Mr. LTH woke up sick, this became a last minute Sunday afternoon lunch.  I always keep pre grilled/shredded BLSL chicken in our freezer, so I used that in place of the raw chicken.  I also added a T of butter, just because I love the richness a bit of butter adds to soup.  I always use chicken stock, so I did here, as well.  We only had 1% milk, but I'd have used skim if we had it.  The only "white" beans we had were blackeyed peas, so that's what I used, though I'm sure that's not what I was supposed to use (they worked, though!).  I added well more than a 1/2 tsp salt, probably closer to 1-2 tsp, but I like "salty" soup.  This was an excellent soup that came together in a short amount of time, just as the title suggests.  I'd absolutely make this again.  The red pepper (and I used some I'd previously frozen w/no noticeable impact) and corn (white, frozen) added a nice bit of sweetness to the soup.  THANKS for the recipe!

This was very tasty.  My only area for improvement for it would be that it needs a bit more substance.  The flavor was there, it just needed more "stuff" in it for my family.  Next time I will definitely add the whole can of beans rather than just 1 cup.  I will also add about 1/2 again as much chicken.  Will definitely make this again.

I loved this easy to make chowder. The cheese is an excellent addition. I seasoned the chicken breast with the olive oil, S&P and garlic powder then baked it in a 350 degree oven for 35 minutes. I diced it and tossed it with all the other ingredients in the slow cooker on low until the onion and pepper were soft. Only had a yellow pepper which added a nice sweetness. Served with garlic bread this was a nice hearty meal.

I threw in a half cup more of cheddar and a can if cream corn plus an additional tablespoon of starch. I simmered it with the beans and it didn't take long to thicken up, plus there was so much good stuff in there. Next time I am going to use 1 cup of red peppers and a few pinches of cayenne.

Winner!  Changes to step 1: Fried up 6 chopped strips of bacon and set aside on a paper towel to cool. Browned chicken, onion, and frozen chopped pepper mix (red, yellow, green) in remaining bacon grease.  Followed the remainder of the directions as written, but used whole milk instead of skim.  Add the crisped bacon back in just before serving.  Yeah, not the healthiest, but ohhhh it tastes goooood!!

Super delicious and more flavorful than I expected! My picky partner even went back for seconds. I only rate 4 stars because I made some changes:

1) Omitted onion, red pepper, and cheddar cheese (though I did sprinkle some Parmesan in mine - partner won't eat cheese!!)

2) Reduced chicken broth to 3 cups. Used way more than 1 clove of minced garlic, plus 1-2 teaspoons of garlic powder. The white beans were slow-cooked leftovers. I added 1T of butter and 3 strips of crumbled bacon! I used 2% milk instead of skim, and chose to include the salt and pepper while the chicken was browning.

I will DEFINITELY be making this again, perhaps with peas and carrots. Anything the partner will eat is a keeper in my book.

I am going to stick this in my crock pot to cook on high for 3-4 hours so that it'll be ready by suppertime... I'm also going to replace the beans with red potatoes since I don't have any beans on hand... this looks delicious! can't wait to taste it!!!

Quick, easy and tasty. I added a can of cream corn to thicken and didn't have the beans…used a potato instead and thought it was a great substitute. A bit bland, so if you like a lot of flavor, you'll need to add something more. I ended up putting a small can of green chilis and a dash of jalepeno seasoning and then it was 5 stars!

I made it with fresh corn since it is corn season.  Just shaved it off the cob.  Also used leftover chicken. Left out the peppers due to my touchy stomach.  Husband and I both loved it and will definitely make it again.

Add potatoes (canned diced potatoes work nicely) and it will be 5 stars.

I made this tonight. Everyone loved it! I did add some canned diced potatoes and substituted about 5 tablespoons of flour in place of corn starch (didn’t realize my cabinet was raided for slime making ingredients). Nevertheless it came out great!

I used a baked potato, which I wouldn’t in the future. Cut the potato in smaller chunks and then allow to cook with the corn.

I took advice from other reviewers and added 1/2 can of diced green chillies and an extra T. corn starch. Instead of milk I used evaporated milk so I whisked the corn starch into some of the chicken broth and added the milk at the very end, just long enough for it to heat up. I also added 1t. ground sage and some extra pepper. If I wasn't cooking to also feed children I would've added some cayenne. It was very hearty and rich and I would definitely make it again.

This is a good, quick, hearty soup. I added a half a can of diced green chilies for a little spice. I would have added the whole can but I have young kids. They liked it. I also used white kidney beans and fresh cooked corn cut from the cob. Turned out great.
