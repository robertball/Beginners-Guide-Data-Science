This recipe is amazing. I always salt brine the goose 12-24 hrs in advance. I've done this marinade three times and it's always fantastic. And, I've always just done it in the oven.

Disappointed, marinated goose for more than 5 hours and it was tough. Cooked over charcoal with hickory chips, not sure what went wrong.

I cut it into bite size pieces and put it in the marinade.  
This was an amazing marinade for goose.  I used coconut oil instead of olive oil.   I grilled it in an iron skillet for about a minute and a half on each side.
