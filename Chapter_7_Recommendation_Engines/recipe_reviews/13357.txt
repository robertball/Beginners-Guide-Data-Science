Delicious and so easy to make! I throw everything in the crock pot in the morning and stir a couple of times throughout the day. We serve it with home made biscuits, yummy! When we went on vacation with 4 teenagers, 2 toddlers and grandparents they all loved it and it was a nice alternative to eating out every night.

I made this today. I thought is was super! My children (ages 5, 7, 9, 10), Hubby and me love pot pie. So this is a must keeper! I doubled the recipe, because I knew it probably would go over well. I did add a little diced celery and a cubed potato tho. We also added black pepper. I think it was salty enough tasting w/o adding more. We also floated round buttery crackers on top to give it that pot pie crust. Thanks for posting this recipe Tracy. It is a keeper here! I intend to pass this on to all my family and friends too. :o)

******* Excellent, excellent, excellent! And so easy! I cooked a mass amount for the soup kitchen at our church and they loved it! It is very filling.  I also added cubed potato which made it chunkier.  I upped the recipe by 10 but I didn't follow it exactly: I took the advice from others and didn't add nearly as much milk.  I added it abou 1/2 cup at a time until it was the consistency that I wanted-not too thick, not too runny. :) I added some garlic and served with cornbread.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

We really liked this.  It was super simple and yummy.  I added only about a cup of milk, put it in a casserole dish and baked it for about 25 minutes at 400 degrees, then topped it with fresh baked flaky biscuits (I tried baking the biscuits directly on the dish the first time, didn't work, bake them separately) - makes the easiest chicken pot pie ever.

This is a nice soup in the "What?  You want gourmet meals every night?  Then go live in a Hotel" category.  Satisfying food, very easy to make.  One might want to use slightly less milk for a thicker soup, and the basic idea of this recipe translates well into other combinations.  (For example, substitute broccoli and spinach for the vegetable medley; cream of mushroom or celery for the cream of chicken soup only, and prepackaged and precooked cubed ham for the chicken).  This is a very good idea for soup, thanks for sending it in!

The soup was really good...kids loved it!! I did alter the recipe a bit...In a stock pot, I boiled 1 whole fryer, fresh carrots, celery, onion, 2 boul.cubes, and added garlic powder, salt and pepper and cooked til the chicken was done. I cooked the stock down to about 4 cups, added the cleaned chicken and the remaining ingredients(i used 2 cans each of the cream soups and 2 cans of mixed veges instead of frozen)It was very creamy, hardy, and just plain good! Will definitely use again!!

PERFECTO! Just what I was looking for! This is a great meal for a cold or rainy day. I followed the directions except for the following:
*I used low sodium cream of chicken soup
*I used 1% milk - that's all we had!
*I only used 1.5 cups of milk to make it thicker

I sauteed the cubed chicken in a large skillet, thawed the veggies in the microwave, and then added everything right to the skillet. It was SO easy and SO quick! I also served it over big buttermilk bisquits. It was heavenly!

This was a truly awesome soup! I love chicken pot pie and this was a good healthy choice.  I didn't add as much milk as the recipe called for, and I used a herbed cream of chicken. I also added a cup of cubed potatoes.  It was great.

I know for some people this recipe will not be considered actual cooking since it uses mostly prepackaged ingredients, but I am definitely a semi-homemade cook and this is right up my alley!This was the second time I made this recipe and my family loved it! I made 1.5x the recipe using a little over 3 cups chicken, 2 cans cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of potato soup. I put in a 16 oz. pkg of mixed vegetables, but should have added a little more. I did only end up adding 1 1/2 cups of milk so it was fairly thick. I added some thyme, garlic and onion powder, poultry seasoning, and salt and pepper. At the end I cubed up some Velveeta cheese and threw it in. I baked some small buttermilk biscuits to go along. My family ate their biscuits on the side, but I broke mine up and ladled my soup/stew over top. It was delicious and comforting on a cold winter night! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was way too bland for us and by the time I got through tweaking it, it became a whole different recipe.  I added garlic, Greek seasoning, poultry seasoning, and a bit of cayenne.  I will use this as a base but will omit the cream of potato soup, double the cream of chicken, and cook some diced potatoes in chicken broth to add.

Great classic tasting Pot Pie Soup.  Very easy to make and very quick.  I top mine with five Pillsbury Frozen Buttermilk Grands Biscuits (not canned) instead of working with a cracker crust.  It bakes up beautifully every time and the biscuits always give that nice salty crunch on the top.

This is a great recipes as is.( I do use two cans of cream of chicken soup.)  I do love to make chicken pot pie filling from scratch but with three kids under the age of 4, it's not going to happen all the time. It's just nice to have a few cans of soup on hand, some frozen chicken breasts and veggies and be able to put a quick meal on the table. I have used this in chicken pot pies(to keep this simple for pot pies, I add a can of diced potatoes, rinsed.) served over egg noodles or over rice.  When served over the noodles or rice, I make the sauce a little thicker by decreasing the amount of milk 1/4 cup at a time to the thickness that I prefer.  Great simple recipe to have on hand! 4-28-09-I have been experimenting with this, I now add 1/2 teaspoon each of: Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Sage & Thyme. Gives it a little more flavor. Also, made this a chicken pot pie the other night and just topped it Pillsbury Biscuits instead of pie crust. I sliced each biscuit down the middle, so I doubled the amount of biscuits. I then placed them on top of Chicken Pot Pie soup mixture and baked for 30 minutes at 325, 325 so the biscuits did not burn. It was really good!

I hate to change a recipe and then rate it but instead of milk I added chicken broth and doubled it , it stil seemed too thick. I also sauteed onion , celery and garlic added a little poultry seasoning, thyme, sage salt and pepper to it. My husband Loved this soup he said it was his new favorite. even my kids all loved it. thanks for a great start on a wonderful recipe!

This was really great. Quick and easy comfort food. I added a couple of spoonfuls of fat free sour cream and a half packet of onion soup mix but that it just because of my personal aversion to the cream of chicken taste on its' own. The whole family loved it and there was plenty to freeze for later.

This was great!!! Everyone LOVED it including my little ones! I made a few modifications though to add flavor after reading other reviews. First I sauted half an onion in olive oil with minced garlic. I used only 1 1/4 cup milk so it turned out thicker. I used a rotissery chicken to save time and added a potato. I also added about a tsp of celery seed, pepper, poultry seasoning and a little salt. I served it with mini buscuits :) Will be making this often!! Took very little time to cook since it only had to be heated through and it tasted great. Thanks for this great easy recipe!!

WE double the recipe (it's so easy to take for lunch...everyone wants it), and instead of cream chicken 2 times, we do:
2 cans cream of potato
1 can cream of chicken
1 can cream of brocoli or celery
both add a yummy flavor that tastes like the veggies were in there stewing all day! very yummy...even picky eaters eat it!

So, I was searching the site for something quick and easy to make with the few things I had in the house. This was a great guideline for a tasty throw together meal. These are the ingredients I used...  1 lb of cubed chicken sauteed in about 1/2 tbsp of olive oil 26 oz can of Cream of Mushroom soup 1 cup of frozen corn 1 cup frozen green beans 5 medium cubed and boiled potatoes (boiled until slightly softened) 1 cup of heavy cream salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, basil to taste  1 can of cresent rolls brushed with olive oil and grated parmesan cheese then baked as directed. Pulled apart and mixed in after they were done.   Honestly, best meal I have made in a while.   I will play around with this recipe a bit more. Highly recommend getting created with it.

This is one of my family's favorite soups.  Instead of crackers, though,  I bake 2 pie crusts until golden brown.  I crumble  them and serve them over the top of each bowl of soup.  That gives the soup a real "pot pie" flavor!!!!

This tastes exactly like a chicken pot pie. I made a huge batch of this in a crock pot and toasted 4 pie crusts and broke them up to sprinkle over the top instead of crackers and got rave reviews and gave the recipe away to multiple people. My husband said I totally had to make it at home some time. I made this for a bible study dinner. The pie crust really made it come together. I also made buttery rolls on the side. I twas a rainy night and we were all sleepy after :)

This soup is AWESOME! A flavor I have been trying to find for a long time. My husband loved it and is already making plans for when I make it again. I followed the recipe pretty close but I did change a couple of things. Instead of frozen vegetables I used a can of VegAll and I also had a can of sliced potatoes which I drained, rinsed and diced. I also cut the milk down to 1 cup. I did use the suggestion of spooning over hot biscuits. This is definately a keeper! Thank you Tracy!

This turned out okay...we followed the instructions...I just felt like something was missing. maybe some salt? I'd make again, but I'd probably tweek it a bit...maybe add more salt and veggies.

This was very good with a few changes/additions: First I baked thicken seasoned with poultry seasoning, pepper, and seasoned salt. I didn't have mixed veggies so I used a bag of frozen peas & carrots, and I added a can of corn, and two cubed medium potatoes (two potatoes were a little too much, think I'll just use one next time), and about 2 Tbs finely chopped onion. I replaced the second cup of milk with half and half to make the soup more creamy. I also added (about) 1/2 tsp of thyme, 4 tsp garlic power, 1/8 tsp pepper, a little salt, and a sprinkle of poultry seasoning. This was great over those big, fluffy Pilsbury Country biscuits. Wonderful comfort food! Thanks for sharing.

This was great! I doubled the recipe, made in the crock pot, used 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and took a little help from the store and used the meat from a ready-made rotisserie chicken. I think the rotisserie chicken added a ton of flavor! Superb!

This was good!  I was leery due to the canned soups but it really was the taste and consistency that I was looking for.  I liked this with peas, carrots and onions, sauted in the sauce pan before adding the other ingredients.  Biscuits are a must with this soup.

Delicious!! I used fat free milk, and low fat soups, and two different kinds of frozen veggies, and it was loved by my whole family! Even those weary of "low-fat" food! Quick and easy to boot! Definately be making this again!

O.M.G. this was amazing!  I hate pot pie but this was killer!  I had one picky eater in the bunch who didn't like the veggies but I don't rate recipes based on the opinion of a 5 yr old lol.  The rest of us LOVED it and I can't wait to make it again!  Thank you for a fantastic recipe!

This is good as is, but really good with a few adjustments. You definitely need to salt/spice to taste. As is, it is just plain. I added salt, garlic powder, and some poultry seasoning. If I had onion powder, it would have been good too. The other thing that most didn't mention is you need to add a little cheese to each bowl. This is what gives it that pot pie flavor. Also add a potato for a bit more fullness!

This almost sounds too simple, but it really is a fantastic soup.  I made this for a Soup Cook-off and I won the competition hands down! (there were only 6 soups/chilis).  I made it according to directions for the most part.  I did make a few adjustments based on previous comments/reviews.  I baked my chicken breast with seasonings first.  I used whole milk instead of skim. I used 98% fat free cream of chicken soup. I added a couple bay leaves, pepper, garlic power, celery salt, poultry seasoning and a small amount of sage.  Probably about 1 tsp of each (doubled the recipe).  I also served with the choice of Biscuits or baked pie crust.  I already have requests to make this again.  Would be a great dinner to bring to shut ins.     Oops! Almost forgot.  I did saute and small onion and added a couple Tbsp of flour to that before adding it to the soup.  I wanted to make sure the soup was good and thick and creamy, and it was!

Made this a few times... both times, instead of the canned soup, I made my own sauce by melting butter, adding flour and chicken stock and let it get thick... added some rosemary, thyme and sage and then all of the other ingredients and it tasted like a Thanksgiving turkey. Only putting 4 stars because I changed the recipe... otherwise I'd give it a 5 with my changes. Delicious and a big hit with my daycare kids. Thanks!

I have been making this since 2004.    This is SOOOO GOOD!  I add celery salt, poultry seasoning, thyme and parsley.  I also add some fresh cooked diced potatoes, carrots and onion.  Serve with baked, crumbled pie crust over the top.  This is my favorite soup recipe!!

I love this recipe!  If you want to make it fancier you can use fresh vegies and crumble cooked pie crust on top.  It's also great for camping!  Used canned chicken, vegies, and evap milk.  Just heat it up in the pot.  It's great for the last day of your trip when you are running out of ice to keep things cold.

OMG--this soup is SO good and SO easy! Much better than out of a can, for sure. I added sliced mushrooms for fun...it needed some salt and pepper--but it was fabulous. Added to my favorites!!

This was really delicious!  Even my husband, who doesn't like soup, declared this a "keeper!"  It went together really fast - I even cheated a little by using a drained 12.5 oz can of chicken breast instead of the cups of cubed chicken.  I did use the recommended amount of milk, and it was fine with us.  One change I may try next time is using a CAN of mixed vegetables rather than the frozen - my vegetables were a bit too crisp for the pot pie context.  Other than that minor thing, a real winner!

Great with sandwiches on a cold day!

4.5 stars for this.  I know, it's a far cry from home-made stock -- but -- really, we all need one of these quick & easy recipes in our arsenol, don't we?  I made this for my guy, who was recouping from surgery, when I had to leave him for a few days.  He happily had it for dinner several nights in a row in my absence.  It's tasty, hearty, filling, and comforting.   Everything you want in a soup!  I will make it again, it tastes just like pot pie without the crust!

Thank you for posting this! Though I did make personal changes, the concept is very easy and very good. I used 3 half chicken breasts which I rubbed with pesto (tubed) before cooking on a mini Forman grill. Preheated oven to 300. In an oven safe pot, I cooked 1/4 of an onion in a tiny bit of oil until soft, then added 2 bags (24 oz total) of mixed veggies, about 1 teaspoon mixed dried herbs (It. seasoning plus thyme) and some garlic powder.  Added the condensed soups as written and 2 cups of 2% Lactaid (it's what I had). Cubed the chicken and added, and brought eveything to a bare simmer (it was thicker than I thought---which I liked), covered and pop it into the oven for about 1 hour. I did not add salt due to the soups and because of what I did next.
Since I like crust, I made a qty for a single pie shell, rolled it out between 2 sheets of parchment paper and used a pizza cutter to crisscross cut the dough. Slid the paper and dough to a baking pan and baked; I now had pie crust "chips". I could drop 2 or 3 (or more) in my serving. Overall I ended up with more than 4 servings-----I will make this many times. Thanks again for a recipe to springboard off from!

For something so quick and easy, my family really loved this.  Like others, I made it in my crock pot.  I used cubed b/s chicken breast, but will definitely use this recipe for left-over turkey and chicken in the future.  This would be great baked in the oven with a biscuit topping.

This was easy to make but it did lack a little "something."  Needs a little more flavor but I don't know what.  Would cut down on the liquid to make it thicker, too.

This is great!  It's so easy to make and really hits the spot on a cold day! Everyone in my family enjoyed it.  I might add a little dried thyme next time I make it - then it will taste just like my favorite pot pie recipe - only it takes a lot less time to make!  Great comfort food! Thanks!

What a delicious and easy recipe.  Instead of using frozen vegetables, I chopped some carrots, potatoes, and celery, cooked them in chicken broth until tender, and drained before adding to the soup mixture. I also added frozen green peas and corn and baked puff pastry to place on top of the soup.

Make this quite often. It's very good, fast and easy to put together. I always bake a refrigerated pie crust at the same time, then break it up and add to the soup just before serving. To me, that should be on the list of ingredients! I've also added fresh mushrooms, black pepper and sometimes thrown in a few bay leaves. Just a good delicious and satisfying soup.

Excellent!  I made this last night.  Doubled the recipe, added a can of sliced potatoes (because I wasn't sure how long fresh potatoes would take to cook) and added a can of bisquick buscuits at the end - just cut them into quarters and dropped them on the top and let them cook through for about 10 minutes.

Yum!

This soup was delicious and oh so simple to make. Some minor changes: I added sauteed white onion and garlic, a chicken bouillon cube, and several dashes of "Frank's Red Hot" sauce to the mix, just to give it a little extra kick. I also decreased the milk by about half a can. I served with buttermilk biscuits on the side. Next time, I think I'll add some pimento peppers and mushrooms. Great recipe! I am positive I'll be making this one again. Thank you submitter!

I love this soup, my husband says I cannot make this all the time for dinner, so now I will make for my lunch.  This is great soup.

I've made this like four times in a week, it heats up well for lunches.  I've used the cracker topper and like another reviewer suggested pie crust.  Both turned out awesome.  Now I'm going to try using my homemade soups.  Thanks for such a great post.  This is my favorite soup, that I don't have to buy canned any longer.

I made this with an entire can of cream of chicken soup - I didn't want two half-cans sitting around in the fridge - and fresh peas, carrots, potato and onion. It was rather thick so I added a splash of skim milk. This was very tasty and hearty. Thanks!

This was quick and easy to make.  I diced some potatoes and cooked in the microwave to add in and I used evaporated milk (1 14oz can) instead of milk.  Also put some garlic powder and cracked pepper.  Definately will use this again.

Almost like my mother's Cream Chicken and Biscuits! Mum would make a similar concoction (cream of chix soup and frozen peas/carrots) and serve the warmed mixture over Bisquick drop biscuits. Equally good on the stove or in the slow cooker. A nice, child-friendly meal for a cold evening! Thanks for sharing!

I just ate this and was very pleased with it. I made it a bit lower in calories by using 98% fat free Cream of Chicken soup. I used 1/2 cup less milk than it called for and used only half of my 1lb. bag of frozen vegetables in mine. Also, I didn't have any fresh chicken in the house, so I used a small can of chicken breast that I happened to have. This turned out great! All I added as seasoning was some black pepper to taste.

I changed the recipe a little.  I added one more can of cream of chicken soup, 1 tsp of chicken bouillon granules and 2 tsp of beau monde seasoning.  We served it in a bread bowl and it was fabulous - all 20 gallons of it for a church ladies night out dinner!!!

Excellent receipe.  I enjoyed this receipe immensely.  I took the advise of others and reduced the amount of milk, and made a slight change by using a cup of milk, and then 3/4 cup of evoparated milk.  Then, I placed the soup in a pie shell, so it was actually a pot pie.  It was delicious, and the filling had a nice texture, it was just right.  Very, very easy receipe.  It took about 10 minutes to prepare.

Tasted very much like pot pie. I used frozen pie crusts and baked them and then put pieces on top of soup. If soup were just a little thicker it would have been pot pie.

Great for a rainy cold day.  It is good to serve with biscuits.  Tasted just like chicken pot pie.  We made it in the crockpot and so used a lot less milk than called for, but it was perfect consistency.  We loved this and will make it again.  Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I think this recipe deserves a 5 star rating  although I thought I would like it a little thicker so O put potato flakes in it and also cut up three small red  potato's  and simmered it in with the veg. and soup mixture.  I will make this again for sure.

My family of picky eaters loved it! I couldn't find cream of potato soup. I blanched a potato after it was cut up and then added it to the soup and let it cook. I also added a full can of cream of chicken to bring the total to 3. It was spot on!!! Will be making this again soon!!!

This recipe is easy and can easily be made low fat/low sodium/ gluten free. I made it with cream of mushroom instead of potato and it was great. A very versatile recipe.

This is really good! I was concerned about it being bland, or tasting too much like canned soup, so I used 1/2 cup of the highly seasoned broth that the chicken was cooked in along with 1/2 cup of white wine and added milk until the soup was the texture I was looking for. We always add a cooked potato to regular pot pie so one went into the soup also. Some additional seasoned salt and pepper were all it needed to be a great bowl of soup on a cold day. Thanks so much for posting.

I had tried a much more complicated version of Chicken Pot Pie soup a few weeks ago (everything from scratch!) and this was so much better! My 6 and 8 year old both said they much prefer this recipe and ate a whole bowl each. I love that it was so simple and quick! I boiled chicken in water with chicken bouillon to cook it prior to cutting it up for the soup; when I made the soup I added a little bit of the chicken-cooking broth to it to make it a little less thick. (simply a texture preference- the recipe is great as-is!). Thanks for sharing!

Personally, with crushed Ritz on top, this was a 5 for me.  My husband doesn't eat chicken pot pie and my teenager ate around the veggies, but if you have a chicken pot pie eater, by all means, give this a try.  It's simple, quick and very tasty.

Super easy and good.  However, it would be a little boring if I hadn't added salt, pepper and topped each serving with a flaky baking powder biscuit.   Topping this soup with a baked biscuit, just as you serve it, will give you a 5-star presentation, eliminate the need for crackers and make it taste more like chicken pot pie.

This soup is very easy and super delicious.  I buy a package of ready to cook pie crust and bake it, then break it into crumbs and keep to the side just before serving.  Just like a chicken pot pie with the crust.

I thought the soup was a great starting place to modify and add more.
I added some potatoes, some extra milk, and some salt and pepper (because I like mine a little more spicy). I served it with a dinner roll, and it was delicious!

WOW! Quick and easy comfort food!!! I am a soup lover, my husby not so much. However he really loved this soup/meal. We are both trying to lower our fat and sodium so I made this with chicken stock instead of milk.  I also used frozen Chicken Fajita meat instead of plain chicken and didn't add the biscuits 'cause it raises his blood sugar to high. It was still really good and we didn't feel like we had missed out on anything. Will definately make again!!! Thanks for a quick midweek feast.

I once tried a similar soup at Specialty's Cafe and since chicken pot pies are my ultimate favorite comfort food, I had to find a chicken pot pie soup recipe.  This one is amazing and really easy.  I like to make mine on the creamier side (less milk) and enjoy with some warm, flaky biscuits.  Perfect for a cold, winter day!

Well, this was a tough one. I liked this recipe. It didn't have a lot of flavor but I love the taste of vegetables so I was a happy camper. The rest of my family wasn't though. I'll still hold onto this recipe for a day that my husband may be out of town but other than that, it's not allowed back on my menu board. Boooo :-(

This soup is phenomenal!!  The only change I made was using whole milk instead of skim(all I had in the house)  The soup was very creamy, so I think I'll make it the same way next time.  True, not 'low cal' but oh so good.  Hard to believe you can make such great soup so easily and with so little ingredients.   Bravo TRACYHIBB   Thanks

As written I give it a 2 for blandness. I did double the recipe. After I taste-tested it and thought after making "Chicken Pot Pie IX" from this website, there is NO way I'll serve this to my family....I added the following:  I sauteed one medium onion in about 1 tbsp butter.  Added about 1-2 tsp celery seed, and about the same amount of pepper, at which point I found it edible.  I also used 2% milk, and 2 packs of purdue ready cut and grilled chicken meat (last part to save on time).

Turned out great when made a variety of ways.  My personal favorite so far is using my crockpot.  I put in two frozen chicken breasts, frozen mixed veggies (most of the bag, holding some out to add later), the cans of cream of chicken and potato soup, fresh-pressed garlic, onion powder, and 1.5 cups of 2% milk.  This is cooked on low for approximately 4 hours, adding the rest of the veggies in the last hour (and maybe a splash more of milk if needed -- also I sometimes add chunks of cooked leftover potatoes at this stage).  Then maybe a few dashes of pepper and it's good to go!  Best served with homemade biscuits.  :)

Stayed true to the recipe except these changes. Sautéd 1/2 chopped onion and 1 clove of garlic in a small amount of olive oil in pot.   Then added skim milk, condensed low fat soup chicken, potato soup, cooked veggies and chilken to the onion/garlic.   The last addition to the recipe was 1 chopped, cooked potato.   Recommend.

This was pretty good.  I used a condensed can of cream of chicken with herbs and then added black pepper and sage.  This was pretty good but def needed seasoning.  It was better the next day.

Delicious and so easy to make! I throw everything in the crock pot in the morning and stir a couple of times throughout the day. We serve it with home made biscuits. I've made this soup a couple of times, one time I omitted the condensed potato soup and just made it with one can of soup, still a great recipe. I've also made this soup with leftover turkey, it's a great versitle soup. Yummy!

Made this tonight for my boyfriend and I and we loved it!    The only complaint is that it tasted a little bland while I was cooking it, so I added a little bit of garlic powder and lots of salt and pepper to taste. The mixture was also a little thinker than my liking so I added a tad bit more milk. Still, it was really really good and I'll be making this again. :D

This was delicious. I'm in college so I love quick and inexpensive.  I put all the ingredients in my crock pot before class and it's so good. The second time I made it I tweaked it just a little: I used cream of chicken soup then added frozen cubed potatoes, I also used cream instead of skim because its cold here and comfort food is much needed. A little garlic, onion and a bay leaf gave it that extra something.  Thanks so much for the recipe, it will become a staple in this house!

This is a delicious, quick, comfort soup.  Needs a little salt and pepper, otherwise we made as stated and added bisquick reduced fat dumplings on top.  Not necessary though.  Great on a crisp fall day like today in Michigan!  Thanks for this recipe, we'll definitely use it alot, even week nights because it's so easy. Oh - make sure you thaw the bag of vegetables.

Really great. We added some onion as well; the only downside we noticed was that the broth was a little thinner than we would've liked. Next time we might try it with a cup less of milk.

I doubled the recipe but only used 3 cups of milk. I also used pepper and salt to season. This was good but next time I will use canned or fresh veggies instead of frozen (personal preference).

Very, very good! I used turkey instead of chicken and I put less milk than the recipe calls for because I didn't want it too runny   I also put it in the oven for a bit after heating on the stove first. I served it with crescent rolls rather than crackers. It was a huge hit with everybody and I will make it again and again.

This was the best soup I've ever had!  My whole family loved it! I added 1/2 cup chopped celery and served with shredded cheddar cheese on top, but next time I think I'll add some mushrooms, and potato chunks. GREAT soup, very filling and tasty!  I will definatly make this again.

This was just okay.  My main complaint is that it was a bit runny.  Luckily I made biscuits based on other comments.  I think I'll stick to genuine pot pie in the future.

My boyfriend and I thought this recipe was so good. I made 8 servings worth so there is plenty of left overs. I also used meat from a rotisserie chicken instead of cubed chicken. Awesome for a cold day. I will definitely make this again.

This is awesome. I have had this in my recipe box for a few weeks waiting to try this. Too bad I waited. Very easy and comforting. Thanks.

YUMMY! Total comfort food!! Great for a rainy day or a good substitute for real chicken pot pie. I used canned chicken because I was in a hurry. Also, I served it with canned crescent rolls. Very fast prep!!

This soup was excellent!  It was a very hearty meal for my husband and I, we'll definitely make this recipe again.  I did use turkey instead of chicken just because that was what I had in my freezer, but I think it would be good with either one.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Not a meal you would think about making on a warm day but I was in the mood. Used leftover chicken, fresh vegies, cream of celery soup, chicken broth instead of the milk because I also threw in my leftover gravy. Made dumplings for this too. Great start Tracy and thanks!

This was very good and super easy to make.  Next time, I will cut back some on the veggies (maybe to 12 oz.) and add a little more chicken.  Instead of crackers, I baked up a ready-made pie crust, crumbled and served over top, so it would be more like a pot pie.  Next time, I may try bread bowls.

In stead of using a bag of frozen vegetables, I find its best to add pearl onions, carrots, celery, peas (frozen is fine), and mushrooms.  I also added some garlic salt and some fresh parsley

Quick, delicious and easy!  I baked the chicken breasts in chicken broth instead of microwaving or boiling, adding some of that broth after straining the grease to add more flavor - turned out great and the company that stopped in during dinner loved it too!
Thanks, Tracy!

Very bland, once dressed up with a bit more chicken boullion and sherry pepper sauce it was pretty good.  Doubt will make again, but good for a one time meal.  Super easy and quick to make though.

I cooked this using left-over turkey from our Thanksgiving meal.  In fact the turkey was smoked.  I cooked it in the crock pot.  Others noted that they reduced the milk, but I kept the full 2 cups.  In addition, I used one more can of cream of chicken (this maybe why my 2 cups of milk didn't seem like too much).  I placed the turkey and vegetables in the crock pot, still frozen.  I cooked on high for 3 hours, then placed on the Keep Wram setting.  I baked to pie shells for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees and had a real pot pie crumble on top.

I thought this was a delicious recipe and super easy which is even better! I do agree it was a bit too watery for me; however, the longer it sets the better. Next time I would probably add in 1 quart of water and add more at the end if needed. I also threw in chicken bouillon cubes in my water to add more flavor! I definitely will be making this again!!!

This turned out great! I ended up not using  potato soup since I didn’t have any, but just substituted 3 small potatoes, diced, and boiled them in 6C chicken stock. Used a steam pack of veggies and tossed in after I had the potatoes cooked. Added the cooked chicken once it was done and diced. Also, I used a corn starch slurry and some milk to thicken and cream the soup up. Normally I try the recipe as written first but I couldn’t since I didn’t have all the ingredients. But the proof is in the pudding- great base recipe that’s versatile to your taste! It’s in the rotation at our house!

Great recipe. I used 1 1/2 cups milk and only half a bag of mixed vegetables. I also added Italian Herb seasoning (grinder).
I cooked it on low for about 30 minutes. For dumplings, I used a 7.5 oz refrigerated biscuits, quartered. Drop biscuits on top of soup, cover & simmer for 15 minutes or until biscuits are done.

I really like this recipe,  Doubled this recipe and made a few minor changes that were suggested by other reviewers.  Sauteed chicken thighs with onion, garlic, and celery, Used half and half and milk and added a can of cream of mushroom soup on top of the 4 cans already used because I wanted a bit more liquid and didn't have any more cream of chicken or potato.  Served over Pullsbury biscuits and it was awesome. Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe! I made some modifications to match what i was after. I doubled up on the cream of chicken and potato to get more soup. I also added fewer veggies ( about 6oz) since 16 would have been too much for the amount of soup. I had. I cooked some small potato pieces for about 10 minutes before adding them in. They were the perfect consistency. Not undercooked but not mashed potatoes. I followed another review’s advice and added some pepper into the soup while it was heating up. It was a hit with the family!

I would give this five stars, however, I made some changes.  I placed uncooked chicken breast right into the slow cooker with the other ingredients. Once the chicken was fully cooked, I shredded it and allowed it to soak up the other flavor some more.  I also added cream of mushroom soup and used heavy cream instead of milk. I felt this gave it more flavor as well as made the soup creamier.  I will definitely be making this again!

No, went by the recipe.  Although I did make mine in a crock pot and I used a whole chicken.  I think this would be good with dumplings... next time will add Pilsbury biscuits to the top and let them cook for 1 hour... will be excellent.

This recipe turned out amazing! My husband loved it. I got the canned chicken and used 4 big cans of that. Then I used 24 oz of the mixed vegetables along with 2 cans each of the condensed soups and finally 3 cups of 1% milk. I added a garlic seasoning called Vik's garlic from the tea and spice exchange with black pepper. It came out so great. We topped it off with franks original hot sauce. Will make again instead of buying pot pies from now on!

Love this as one of my favorite recipes for comfort food or chilly weather. I like someone else's idea for adding diced potatoes & it's good with herbed cream of chix soup.  Our favorite topping is pie crust, cut & baked in circles.

This was a huge hit at home. I did add some diced potatoes though. And I served it with biscuits. I will definitely make this again. It worked great in the crock pot.

The first time I made it according to the recipe, and it was too thin and bland for my family's taste. The second time I made it I used 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder and placed them in the bottom of the crock pot. In a separate bowl I mixed  the cream of potato soup, cream of chicken soup, and one cup of skim milk then poured the mixture over the chicken. I cooked it on Low for about 5 hours. When the meat was tender I pulled it apart with two forks and added 16 oz of frozen mixed vegetables. I let that cook for another hour (or until heated through).  I made homemade biscuits to go along with it and it was delicious. Even my picky 3 year old approved! With the adjustments I would change the rating to 5 stars. I think it's a great base recipe to work with and will make it again and again with those changes.

Thank you submitter.  Obviously,  you made this with keeping calories on the low side.  I just needed  a recipe to use up leftover  chicken and use  what I had on hand.  Your recipe is a GREAT  template.   That is what I love about this site.  I never would have thought of  using the canned soup getting old in my cabinet.   Quick and easy.  I used  a can of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup (would have preferred the cream of potato - but this is what I had), 1 1/2 cups of half and half and about 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I wanted a thick, creamy soup.  Threw in a bag of frozen primavera veggies, 2 cups of chicken adding 2 tbls of sherry, 1/2 tsp each of black pepper, thyme and basil since many said it was bland.  This worked for us - we loved it and it was made in NO TIME!  The only change I would make to my version is to add more chicken and probably would then need to add some more broth.   Could also keep the same amount of chicken but use less veggies.   We just felt the veggies overpowered the chicken.  Thank you so much submitter.  This is a keeper!

This is so easy and so good! I have made it several times now and the only thing I changed was I used 2% milk instead of skim milk only because thats what I always have on hand. Definitely one of my favorites!

Great Recipe, I did make a few changes.

I used 2 cubed potatoes half way cooked, added to soup. Used two cans of the cream of potato, and 1 can of the chicken. Added 1 can of Swanson chicken broth and a half cup of milk, used rotisserie chicken, Veg-all, season salt, garlic powder, onion powder and ground black pepper. Placed tore up Grand Jr. biscuits put in bottom of bowl and ladled soup over. This is superb, my husband said can we add this to our weekly menu planner. Thank you for the recipe and reviews,  will definitely make again.

I put all in a crockpot for about 4 hours on high.  I used cooked seasoned chicken and a can of mixed vegetables instead of frozen.  Added biscuit dough cut in 1/8 and rolled into balls to make dumplings an hour before it was finished.  I will make this again.

This soup is great! Even my sister who hates soup loved it after I talked her into tasting it. I had to make a second batch after my nephews stopped by and smelled it, they ate it all! This soup is a hit just the way it is, wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for one heck of a recipe.

A friend told me to check allrecipes for this soup.  I used two cans of chunk chicken, a personalized mix of frozen veggies, regular milk, and added a can of drained diced potatoes.  It was so fast and really tasty, hubby especially loved it, and did not even use crackers on top. Next time though I will heat the frozen veggies until they are softer before adding them, the green beans stayed pretty crunchy!

So easy! I made a single pie crust that fell apart and didn't know what to do with it. I wanted something quick and easy! I used 2 cans of cream of chicken, 2 cans of almond milk, 1/2 onion, 3 red potatoes, 2 carrots, 3 chicken breasts, 1 can of peas, and 1 can of green beans. It was fabulous! I cooked the chicken breast right in the soup mixture and took it out to chop it up. I waited until the end to add the green beans and peas. Then served my crumbled pie crust on top. DELICIOUS!

Great flavor.  I placed all ingredients into a crockpot (browned chicken in a skillet) and let it cook for 5 hours.  Next time, I may add some onions and mushrooms.  I did lighten it by using 98% fat free cream of chicken soup.

Excellent!  I didn't have time to make anything and I  pulled this together very quickly with ingredients on hand.  I had to substitute turkey for chicken though but it was still great.  What a life saver.  My children loved it as well.  My husband was impressed I pulled it together rather than doing a fast food night.   It's an easy recipe to add things to as well.

Very yummy and a hit with the kids, I doubled the recipe, used some baked chicken (rest will work in a salad for lunch), added some cubed potatoes, peas, corn and baby onions, some salt and pepper. Put all the in the slow cooker and in a short time it was all done. Great for the days when I really dont feel like cooking, but still want to feed the kids something yummy.

Easy crock-pot meal, good comfort food.  I started with 4 small chicken breasts, and cut them up about halfway through the cook time.  Thicken with cornstarch at the end if necessary.

Made this for dinner tonight.  It was awesome!  I used chicken I had leftover from a crockpot chicken and a can of veg all and only 1 cup of milk in it.  Baked biscuits and poured the soup over them when it was time to eat it.  I think I'll try homestyle noodles in it next time.  So super quick and simple. Very good!

So easy, and so incredibly yummy. I used corn instead of the mixed vegetables and served it up with sourdough bread. Yummy!!

This was so good, quick and easy!  I didn't have cream of potato soup, so I substituted cheddar cheese soup.  I also microwaved 2 potatoes and diced them and 1/3 cup sauteed onion. Delicious!!

I just thought this was okay.  It was easy to make but it just didn't have the taste I was looking for.  I also had to thicken it up a bit.  Overall it was edible but not something I would make again.

This soup was sooooo easy and delicious!  I just felt it needed a little more spice so next time I'll try it with some Cavendar's, but that's just me.

it was exellent. I am gluten free, so I adapted the recipe a little. I used a sachet of chicken soup dry mix, and gluten free instant mashed potatos to substitute for the cans. I also added a little pepper, etc, to make up for the blandness of the sachets I used. Will def. make it again!

This was really great served over biscuits (cooked seperatly).  I did not have cream of potato soup so I took a shot and put in a can of crm of chicken and one of cream of mushroom and it turned out great!  The contents of this soup make it pretty healthy so it was a great alternative to the high calorie chicken pot pie.  To make it even healthier, I skipped the biscuits and ate it as a soup!

This was very good and so easy to make. We enjoyed it with some crushed crackers on top. And it was not bland at all. It just needed a little bit of pepper and it was good to go. I will make again. Thanks.

I loved this soup! I changed a few things to make it vegetarian. I used 2 cups Quorn (cubed style). I subbed cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken. I also added some ground black pepper. I wasn't really prepared to like it cause there was so much "cream of" soup in it, but it was delicous. I couldn't stop eatting it. Next time I'm going to serve it over big biscuits like one of the other reviewers suggested. Thanks for a great recipe!

Really easy and delicious.  I put it together in the crock pot at lunch and we came home to a great "comfort" meal that evening.  Add a salad and a few biscuits and you have the perfect Winter time dinner.

Yum! I tweeked this just a bit to bake instead of making a soup. I added a cubed potato and used one cup of milk and topped with Stove Top brand chicken stuffing. This made a very good, filling meal and plenty of leftovers.

This was so filling and delicious!  I added an extra can of potato soup, a can of cheddar cheese soup and 3 soup cans of milk and sprinkled salt, pepper, onion powder and ground thyme too.  Even delicious the next day when I dumped it in a pie pan and made a Bisquick crust on top.

This is a good recipe for a chowder-type soup, but it isn't reminiscent of pot pies at all. Hearty and filling for a cold winter's night, but doesn't taste like a pot pie.

This is good, but better if you modify it to be fresher -- use fresh potato/carrot/celery/onion, saute w/wine and garlic, then stir in ~3T flour.  Add stock, bring to boil then reduce heat and let simmer.  Add chicken, then add frozen (or fresh) peas in last few minutes.  Delicious!!

I think this is a good recipe. However my batch did not turn out to well. My pan was a little hot when I was adding my liquids and some burned to the bottom and pretty much gave the whole pot a burnt taste....such a silly mistake from someone who cooks a lot!! I also would advise against using the can of veg all and go for the frozen or fresh if you can. I used the can and the color of the peas and carrots were so unappitizing plus I like my veggies to have a little bite to them.

My family loved this. I used two cans of 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, added sauted onions and used a can of drained mixed vegetables. Poured it into bowls lined with,'No Roll Pie Crust II'. Very filling and very good. Update: I recently made this using Turkey. The recipe calls for potato soup which I did not have this time, so I used a can of diced potatoes which I purified through my food processor and added an extra can of evaporated milk. I also added about 3/4 tsp. of poultry seasoning and some cooked onions. I  made the "No roll pie crust" and crushed some on each serving. It was delicious!!

My family loved this quick and easy recipe.  I used a bag of california blend veggies (broc, cauli, carrots) and added 1 cup of grated sharp cheddar cheese.  It was to die for!

This soup is just cream of chicken vegetable. Pot Pie means bow tie noodles or some sort of dumplings. So add them and you will have a pot pie soup

I made this for a sick friend today and after sampling, decided to add a little pepper, salt (I used reduced sodium soups), onion and garlic powder.  Otherwise, this was made as stated.  It was delicious and so easy.  This will go well with biscuits.

WOW, so easy and yummy. I tried to cut down on sodium, so I used Healthy Request soup mixes and fresh veggies.  I added diced potatoes, corn, celery, and mushrooms.  I stuck everything in the crock pot for a few hours and the family devoured it!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was edible, but nothing to write home about.  It really lacked flavor. To give it some pizazz, I added a Tablespoon taco seasoning, 1 can of Rotel (tomatoes and chiles), 1 can of corn and I grated some colby jack cheese in it.  It ended up being a Mexican Chicken Pot Pie, and it was delicious!

I thougt it was okay but my husband really liked it. I didn't use cream of potatoe because my husband doesn't really like cream of anything. I put it in the slow cooker on low. I liked the taste but it was a little runny, I tried to thicken it up but didn't work. I also thought it was somewhat bland. but overall okay

This was really yummy especially with biscuts!  I put in the crockpot for about four hours on low.  I used cream of mushroom, and cream of celery and added some chicken broth concentrate. Next time I will add potatoes.

Very good soup.  Tastes just like a chicken pot pie.  Quick and easy too.  Made it last night to have for lunches. Skipped the crackers and bought biscuits instead.

Yummy, easy, comforting.  I added a little more chicken than called for just because that's what I had.  Used frozen peas and corn, and cooked fresh carrot slices.  Served this with bisquick biscuits and a salad - awesome!

Pretty okay - my husband liked it. I had a craving for tater tots, and decided to dump them in the soup after I pulled them out of the oven - which turned out great! Make sure veggies are completely thawed, because they won't cook in the soup.

Had this for a cold wet January night last night. Served in a bread bowl as someone suggested and I believe it would be better without the bread. I did add some red cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit,but other than that the same. It truly does taste like a chicken pot pie without the crust.

Yummy soup!  I made with the amount of milk called for and the consistency was perfect, especially after adding crumbled Ritz crackers at serving time.  Very quick and easy! I would imagine that baked, crumbled pie crust would be tasty too.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was okay...not as good as I thought it would be, but it was pretty good. Nobody from my family complained but they didn't rave either. It is kind of bland tasting. I served it with some buttermilk biscuits on the side, which was a nice compliment. I might make this again and try to make it less bland.
