I made this bulk. This is a great fall treat! I omitted the powdered sugar and milk icing. It was sweet enough.

The only change I made was to add cinnamon to the glaze.

I made this exactly as the recipe was given.  Absolutely DELICIOUS.  Not too much spice, not too much pumpkin.  I didn’t put the icing glaze on.  It didn’t need it.  This is a keeper
