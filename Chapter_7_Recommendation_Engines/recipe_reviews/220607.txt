Great tasting smooth soup!  I just put all the ingredients in my blender at the same time to process this!  I'll be making this again!

MMM..so good. I added a few sprigs of dill to the mix and it was even more refreshing. So nice to have a cucumber soup without the dairy:)

Turned hot today.  Found this recipe.  Used frozen squash instead of zucchini, because that's all I had.  Added the dill.  GREAT!!!  Just what we needed for something light and cool.  Will serve it again and again.

Wow, so simple but so good. Honestly, I just winged it and it was exceptional. I had no zucchini so I omitted that. I added a dash of cayenne, a handful of cilantro, then tasted it and added a bit more salt and lemon juice. Even my 11-year old liked it. Will wonders never cease?! :)

Excellent soup! I was a little skeptical since cucumbers are fairly flavorless, but this was a hit with me, my husband and my parents. It has a great subtle flavor and is very refreshing.

I saw a lot of complaints about it being bland. Are people too scared to add their own seasoning? I had to adjust the seasoning a bit but ended up with a tasty soup!

This was great. I didn't have avocado so I substituted green peas - it was tasty although avocado would have been better. I also reduced the oil to 2 teaspoons. I will make this again.

I wasn't expecting much. Healthy recipes can taste good... But almost never as good as the ones full of fat and sugar.
This one is an exception. I truly enjoyed this one, and so did my 11 year old son and my husband. Great flavor. As someone else said, I just threw it all in the blender at the same time.

I LOVE cucumbers, so was very excited to try this.  Although it was refreshing, it was also pretty bland.  I will prbly make it again, but might just tweek the recipe.

Great taste and filling.  I added extra garlic to suit our taste.  Just started raw vegan and we have had this two days this week!

I made this recipe over the summer and it was delicious!  We substituted vegetable stock for the water for a little added flavor and topped with fresh cilantro.  Also made a meal out of it and topped with blackened shrimp!  Thanks!

We are a gluten and dairy free house. The avocado in this recipe certainly gave the illusion of creamy. Great idea! Maybe my lemon was too big and juicy  because the lemon flavor overpowered all of the others. I would flavor with the lemon to taste after blending all of the ingredients. I see where soup lovers would like this fresh recipe, it just wasn't for us. My husband wanted more flavor and ended up dumping a myriad of spices into his. The kids wouldn't eat it and it wasn't my favorite either (although I still think the over lemony flavor had something to do with that). Thanks for the recipe!

Made a couple changes as suggested from previous reviews.  Used 1 tsp. salt, fresh ground pepper, and doubled the amount of garlic.  Also used juice of one whole large lemon.  Added fresh cilantro... small bunch.  Soup was really fresh and I was shocked when my husband said he "liked" it!  I will be making this one again.

Oh, my. If you are looking for a gazpacho, his is not it. If youâ€™re looking for gluten free, try borscht. This is just terrible. It is very healthy, but just awful to try to consume.

I made it raw vegan.  I put all ingredients into the blender.  I warmed the vegetables first in a glass of room temperature water.  I added coriander, salt, cyan pepper and black pepper. Its amazing!!!!

It was very good!  I will probably try to add a few more spices to give it a little more flavor, but it was very creamy and smooth.  I would make it again, as is.  Nice for summer.

I made it with 1.5 cups of water and only  2 tsp of oil like another reviewer, and added 2 cloves of garlic instead of one. I unfortunately only had limes, so I used the juice of one lime. I enjoyed this recipe immensely! It's super light and, if you reduce the oil like I did, it's only about 80 calories per serving! Though I usually eat about 1.5 servings since it's light. It's a fantastic way to essentially just eat 3 servings of vegetables.

Totally delicious!! I added onion powder and garlic powder, some salt and pepper. I used two huge cucumbers vs. three, and one and a half avocado, blended. In my Vitamix, this was incredibly smooth. Just yummy!

I did not believe this could be as bland as one of the reviewers said. Even though I used organic produce the lemon and garlic did not create the fresh flavor I expected. This does not feel like a cucumber soup, more like an avocado soup. I was not successful in rescuing this.
