Very tasty recipe and easy to prepare.  The sauce was a bit runny but my daughter made that part of the recipe so I'm not certain she got the portions exactly right.  A definite keeper!!

I changed things, because I didn't have everything -- most especially white corn syrup.  I used dark instead, because we love pecan pie -- and this tasted so heavenly.  Even future SIL, who overcooks pork to the point of burning, liked this.  I would have LOVED this with mashed potatoes, but was just too tired to peel them.  We had mac & cheese & broccoli casserole instead.  This was so good.  Wait, I said that already!

Sauce tasted good but was too runny, needs to be thickened with a bit of cornstarch.  Hubby loved the sauce but thought it was too sweet and would be better as a dessert topping over a slice of cake, but I enjoyed it with the pork chops.

I made this recipe, but was very disapointed.  The sauce was very runny, and I tried to thicken it up a bit with some corn starch, but it just ran off my pork chops and made a plate of soup.  The sauce was tasty, but I wish it was thicker.

I really enjoyed the sauce, but as others have said it needs to be thicker.  My brother even likes this, and he doesn't try ANYTHING
