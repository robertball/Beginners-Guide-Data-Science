I use fresh oysters, they are a pain to shuck but the fresh juice is unbeatable.  What better way for an oyster lover to enjoy an oyster.  So good.

Being from the Great Nation of Texas I made a few revisoins.  "Tito's" hand made Texas Vodka, Texas fresh Gulf Coast Oysters, 4 oz Louisiana Cocktail Sauce mixed with 1 Tbs. Horseradish and 4 oz. of "Calamato" Juice mixed.  Fill a 3 oz. Solo Drinking cup with 1 1/2 oz. "Tito's" Vodka and fill cup to 3/4 full with Cocktail/Calamato Mix.  Chill in the freezer.  Remove and squeeze the juice of a 'Valley Lemon" on top with fresh ground pepper and a few dahses of "Frank's Red Hot Original".  Shoot it down and enjoy.  I call it "The Borracho Trail Third Coast Oyster Shooter" and that is how you add the last half of the remaing star to make it a 5 Star recipe.

I made the mistake of using canned oysters with this...much too mushy. Next time, we'll use fresh shucked ones. My husband doesn't like Bloody Marys (not a tomato juice person), and HE even liked them!

Great recipe! You have to love Oysters, and I do. They can be very meaty and the taste is worth the try. Use only fresh Oysters from a Seafood Market, and have them shuck the oysters for you. This way you avoid the horror stories. Use a shot tube, they are nice and thin to place the oysters. Garnish with lemon and a thin slice of celery, makes a beautiful shot tube! Your guests will want to try them.

I have never had raw oysters before & now I know why...those suckers are nasty! I enjoyed the tomato mixture a lot but it would have been even better w/out the sliminess of the oyster. I'm giving four stars because I don't think it's fair to rate an oyster recipe low just because I have an aversion to raw oysters. I'll  stick to Bloody Mary's from now on....sorry.
