I made these as muffins and they were delish! I used 2 cups of quick oats and used 3/4 cup of coconut sugar. I also used coconut oil instead of butter. Cooked for 30 min. Super soft and moist.

I decreased the sugar to 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. brown.  Also subbed half white and half whole wheat for the flour.  And left out the walnuts.  Tasty, moist, delicious!

We loved this bread.  It has more ingredients, but comes together nicely and is much more filling/ better for you than the regular kind of banana bread.  Dough was nicely firm, not runny and there was a nice amount of chips and nuts scattered through bread.   Try 50 minutes and see if it needs more -- mine was very brown at 60 min and slightly dry - next time I'll go for the shorter time first. Might add cinnamon or cardamon next time though . . . 

Only made two changes - 

Didn't have Oat flour - subbed whole wheat flour
Used a 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown since we prefer a less sweet bread and my bananas were very ripe!  Ended up with a nice swish of banana flavor and a hint of sweetness, just like we like it.
