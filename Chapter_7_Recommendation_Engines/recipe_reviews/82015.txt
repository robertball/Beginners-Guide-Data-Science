Similar recipe to Snow Ice Cream II. Like so many others this brought back wonderful childhood memories. For better results mix the sugar and vanilla together first adding a splash of milk to help combine. THEN go out and retrieve the snow. It melts remarkably fast once it gets inside. Don't premeasure the milk and just dump it in. Instead add as necessary to make your desired consistency. Because this is the week before Christmas we have egg nog in the fridge and used it instead of milk and it made the treat creamy and oh so yummy! For those who don't like overly sweet treats you may want to reduce the sugar and/or vanilla if using egg nog instead of milk. We didn't but then we liked it super sweet. Enjoy!

This recipe falls into winter time fun perfectly! What better way to eat snow besides catching it on your tongue? Thank you.....I stirred the sugar and vanilla into the milk and put it into the freezer for 1/2 hour to make it kind of slushy before heading outside to make the snow pudding. It stirred in really well and it was a wonderful treat.

SO delightful! We loved this and froze the bowl in the freezer for about 10 min. before hand so that our snow pudding would stay thick like ice cream. We loved it so much that we made it several times in the winter.

We've just had a fresh snow and I decided to make this for an afternoon treat! Tastes just like how I remember as a child.

This is a very easy and quick recipe. The only thing is that it does not freze well if you want to keep it and the taste gets alittle boring after a while. Other than that its GREAT!

Perfect. i tried this for the first time the other day with my 2 small children and they loved it. now everytime they look out the window and see the snow they ask if the can go scoop some for dessert! try using different extracts besides vanilla... and chocolate chips are perfect in here. if u dont have super fine sugar just pour it in ur food processor and pulse it a few times.

My children and I have made this several times but instead of regular milk we use evaporated milk(can milk)...the kids won't even eat it unless it is made that way. We love it!

This recipe was great! My daycare children and I went out to gather freshly fallen snow then they helped me mix it together. What a delicious and easy activity!

I made this recipe for my little sister as a treat and we both loved it! There is nothing I would change about this recipe! I mixed together the milk sugar and vanilla and then put it in the freezer while I went out and got the snow. After we brought the snow in we mixed the ingredients together and immediately poured them into bowls and ate it. It was so good my little sister said "ten stars!" I will defiantly make this again!!

It tastes just like vanilla ice cream; so easy to make. I used brown sugar (Sugar in the Raw) instead and added a little extra vanilla. Perfect!
