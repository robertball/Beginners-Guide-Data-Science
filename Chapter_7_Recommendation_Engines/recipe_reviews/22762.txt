I have made this recipes four times now.  The first time I followed the recipe and used 1/2 cup butter, it came out very good, it just had a stronger buttely flavor.  The second time I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and added more pineapple, it was delicious! The third time I used peaches instead of pineapple and it was great also.  And the fourth time I used apples and added some spices, it tasted even better!

This was great! I was alittle worried at first when it was so thin and you just mixed everything together but it was so good. It was the first time I attempted something like this. It was so easy and really wonderful. I added mine over ice cream. YYUUMMMYY

This may be a good starter recipe for a pineapple cake/cobbler hybrid dessert as the texture and consistency was nice. Yet as is, I can't rate it any higher. The flavor is only intense butter and sweetness. I even followed other users' good suggestions and used half the amount of butter and extra pineapple. If I try it again, I would double or more the pineapple, add vanilla flavoring, cinnamon and maybe even a touch of cloves.    Substitution for self-rising flour: If you don't have it you can just use regular flour and add 1 & 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp salt to regular flour.

What a quick and easy dessert!  It tastes just like pineapple upside down cake.  I sprayed the bottom of the pan with butter flavored Pam and used a small amount of melted lite butter.  I added 1 tsp. each of vanilla and cinnamon to the batter.  I also opted for fresh cherries.  This goes great topped with Cool Whip.

I thought this was very tasty.  I did make a couple adjustments though.  I cut the butter amount in half, and I used thawed, frozen dark red cherries.  I thought this helped cut down on some of the sweetness.  I also used a 20 oz can of pineapple.  If you don't have self-rising flour, just use regular flour with 1 1/4 tsp baking powder and 1/8 tsp salt.  I will definitely make this again.

I've read all the reviews and have now made this recipe twice.  I was using fresh pineapple and the firsttime it was soooo sloppy, but tasted wonderful!!! The second time I added an extra cup of flour and it came out great.  I think it was sloppy the first time because when the sugars hit the pineapple it juiced up and made it too moist.  This is great! WE love it!

I have used this 1/1/1/1 recipe for peach cobbler since I was about 6 or 8 years old (42 now!), but never would have thought about using is for Pineapple Upside-down Cake. What a great idea!  I had some pineapple and cherries left from Christmas ham and needed to get them out of the fridge, so was looking for a recipe.  I followed this closley but made a couple of adjustments:  Used 1 cup of brown sugar and combined it with the melted butter in the pan.  Then I laid-out cherries and pineapple as for 'regular' upside-down cake.  Then I poured the batter on top and baked as directed.  Turned-out just right and tastes very good.  Thanks for the helpful recipe.  For those that had trouble:  This particluar recipe, while easy, is very sensitive to pan-size and oven temp.  Time and temp MUST be adjusted if the pan is different than 9x13.

Yum yum yum!!! So easy and so good. I used a 10oz jar of halved cherries- it was perfect. I also whisked the batter ingredients to get rid of any lumps. I wonder if it would be almost as good without the butter??? ( then it would be fat free) Thanks so much for sharing!

definately a keeper.  i've been trying out ar recipies on company.when they ou & ah & empty the dish i know its good.my company and i love this one.they all want the recipe , so i tell them , GO TO ALLRECIPIES.COM...that saves me from writing out the recipe.five stars are for taste and so easily made. after reading the reviews i had to edit this ..many said too much butter, batter runny,and had to hide it under ice cream..i didn't change a thing a thing.sure the butter was runney around the batter, but it baked into the cake and gave it the flavor. my batter was NOT runny , in fact it was pretty much like other cobbler dough.presentation was beautiful.i can't say enough words to describe how great this is.i'd give it more stars if i could.

I'll be honest - I didn't read the directions very well before I made this. It was early morning and I had to bring a dessert to a meeting. The result was that I mixed ALL of the ingredients together at once (save the cherries, which I didn't have) rather than melting the butter in the dish and tossing the pinapple with the brown suger. Still, it turned out tasty enough that someone asked me for the recipe. I was just looking for something that was made without eggs so I could serve leftovers to my allergenic son. Turns out, there were no leftovers to offer! A very easy and quick dessert that impresses more than it has a right to for how quickly it comes together.

I just took mine out of the oven and let my son be the guinea pig.  Passed with flying colors!  I did cut back the butter to 6 tbs instead of the 8 in a 1/2 cup and dropped the sugar down to 3/4 cup.  I also took the suggestions of adding the tsp of vanilla and cinnamon to the batter.  It does look runny before it's baked, but the cake bakes up around the fruit and it comes out all sticky and gooey like a cobbler should.  I'll bet you could use this batter with any sort of pie filling and make any type you wanted to.  Thanks for sharing this.  It'll be used a lot.  :)

I used crushed pineapple other than that I followed the recipe to a "T". I made 2 pans for a carry in today. There was a lot of desserts there. I didn't take any home. Rave reviews from all.

I enjoyed this recipe - very easy to half it, too! I omitted the cherries simply because I didn't have any on hand. However, I'm with some reviewers about the butter; less is highly recommended! I put in what would've been 1/4 cup (since I made a half recipe, used 1/8 cup), and it was perfect. Count this Southern cook as a fan of Pineapple Cobbler now!

Little to sweet for us, and I wished I would have done what the other commenter said, and used less butter. It was so easy, and the flavors were nice together, but for our taste, some needs cut back. I would try again, using less butter and sugar.

Have made this twice now, with rave reviews!  Didn't have self rising flour, added 1 1/2tsp baking soda & 1/4tsp salt to  add purpose flour. Added some cinnamon in with the brown sugar &  pineapple . Added vanilla to flour mixture as well.  Agree that this tastes just like grannies pineapple upside down cake, which is what I was looking for when I came across this recipe.  Can't wit to try this with some other fruits, fresh pears maybe. Highly recommend .  Was fantastic warmed up with some vanilla ice cream!!

I live in Costa Rica and fresh pineapples are everywhere. I used 2 cups of fresh pineapple and 1/2 the butter and it turned out wonderful. I took the advice from some of the other reviewers and created my own self rising flour although it still didn't rise that much. Which was fine we ended up eating it as an ice cream topper and everyone loved it. The flavors were sweet & tart at the same time. I will definitely make this again.

Only had crushed pineapple, so used that. Also didn't have any self rising flour, but found a sub on internet by adding baking powder & salt to flour, so that's what I used. Very good, but next time would probably 1/2 the butter, everything seemed to be swimming in it. Good easy recipe though.

I made this recipe looking for a way to use pineapple in a dessert. This cobbler is sooo good :-). I did like some other users and used only half the amount of butter. Also, to cut down on the sweetness, I don't use the recommended amount of brown sugar, nor do I use the cherries. I just sprinkle a little brown sugar before and after I drop the pineapples in. It still came out a little sweet so I will reduce the sugar next time. I also make this in a smaller dish (9x9) so that it's a little thicker/fluffier. This cobbler is perfect with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. The whole family loves it so it's a keeper :-)

I loved this recipe for a couple of reasons.  1.  It was quick & easy to make and 2.  It was absolutely DELICIOUS topped with a little whipped cream.  I did change a couple of things.  I cut back a little on the butter as I used an 11x7 baking dish rather than the 13x9.  I substituted Silk Pure Coconut milk for the milk (lowers it a few calories, omits the cholesterol & also lowers the sugars).  I also cut the white sugar in half as coconut milk tastes a bit sweet on its own, used fresh pineapple and omitted the cherries but only because I did not have any.  I've actually made this cobbler 2X in the last 7 days, at my husbands request =).  I would highly recommend this recipe.

Possibly I did something wrong because the mixture was too liquid (I used only 2 tablespoons of butter). Good flavor even though I had no cherries and the next time I'll use less sugar too.  I added cinnamon and vanilla.

This is pretty good.  A nice quick recipe.  I added some vanilla to the batter.  I think I would have liked it more if I had some nice vanilla icecream to put over the warm cake.

I was a bit concerned with the small amount of pineapple and large amount of butter. It seemed a bit runny at first however I kept the faith and followed directions. Very glad I did - the cobbler was fabulous! next time I will try using crushed pineapple instead of chunk so that it is spread more evenly throughout. This is a keeper!

This recipe was absolutely perfect! It was just like a pineapple upside down cake with a little less cake. Delicious!

This took forever to bake, a lot more than the 30 minutes it says.  WAY too much butter!! I used between half a stick and 3/4 of a stick and it was too much, and I love my butter.  The only thing I did different was add a light strudel topping and I used fresh pinapple cut into chunks. I wouldn't make this exact recipe again, but I would tweak it and make it again because the the flavor was delicious.

I have to tell you this was terrible.  I must not of used the right flour.  The recipe says to melt the butter in the pan then pour the batter into the prepared pan, well the butter just sat in the pan around the batter and the batter did not rise and it had a terrible taste.  Not even the kids liked this cake and we did not eat it.

Excellent recipe and very easy.  I made several changes - halved the butter (based on other reviewers' recommendations), halved the sugar (due to personal preference), and replaced the milk with half buttermilk and half lemon yoghurt (all I had in the house).  Oh and I used salted butter.  The edges were lovely and golden and crispy, while the centre was soft and chewy!  Would be good with other fruits, too.

This recipe is just the one I had been looking for!  A friend of mine made cherry, apple, peach, etc. cobble with this mixture minus the brown sugar.  It is easy and absolutley delicious.  I was looking for a cherry recipe so used 2 cans of cherry pie filling and left out the brown sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very good recipe.  I used Lactaid instead of regular milk and margarine for the butter (trying to go the lactose -free route for DD).Even though the substitutes I used were not the best choices flavorwise, the end result was still very tasty and my kids asked for seconds.Oh, and I didn't have  cherries so I subbed dried cranberries instead. I will definitely make this again. I can't wait for the chance to make this with all the original ingredients.

This was so easy to make and taste so good I couldn't believe it. When I poured everthing into the pan and saw the butter floating all around, I thought no way is this going to be good. I was wrong. I did add cinnamon and like what it added to it.

the best for the work and time invested, and versatility; i have now made this many times; even better with canned peaches; i also used strawberries that had macerated in sugar for two hours - 25 minutes in convection, gives you a crispy edge, sweeter with unsalted butter, sweet-swalty with salted butter. Yummy yummy in the tummy as my 3-year old said

Kristina,
This recipe rocks!  I just made it this afternoon and brought it to my quilt guild potluck.  There wasn't any left and everyone was asking for the recipe.  I told them I got it of allrecipes.com.  It couldn't be simpler or more delicious.  THANKS!

I made this recipe before exactly.  I keep getting requests for this dessert.  I dont have a problem with the quantity of butter (i use margarine) but it wouldnt hurt to cut the butter.  In addition to the batter, before I add the milk, I sprinkle a dash or two (or three)cinnamon.  It changes the taste.  Try it.

This was not good.  Gummy texture and hard to chew.  I thought because of all the reviews that it would be fine, but that was not the case.  I followed recipe to the exact.  Maybe I will find a different cobbler recipe next time.

Unlike some other reviewers, I did not find this awash in excess butter--it just had a nice buttery flavor.  It tastes very much like a pineapple upside down cake and we loved it.  I might try it with more pineapple next time, but it's perfectly good just as it is.

This recipe was good but way to heavy on
the butter. I used 1/4c butter and still thought it was to much can't imagine 1/2c. I also didn't use cherries because I didn't have any. Great recipe to use if your looking for a quick easy dessert.

This recipe was simple, easy and quick, yet everyone loved it!  Putting the butter in the pan before you put the other ingredients in is key for a crisp crust.  Will definitely make again!  I substituted fake butter for real butter and used crushed pineapple instead of chunks.

I loved this recipe, it was delicious! If you're a pineapple lover you'll love this. 

After reading reviews on the butter issue, I decided to only use around 5 tablespoons of butter, and because I didn't have the cherries around, instead I sprinkled coconut on top, and it came out great. 

I'll definitely be doing this again.

Very simple & quick, I agree with the others though about too much butter.  I used the amount that the recipe called for and it was a bit greasy, I would cut it to 4-6 tablespoons next time.  The variations are endless for this recipe!

I'm sure that this recipe is very good following these directions.
But the other day it was printed in  our newspaper stating that it came from allrecipes.com.  The ingredients were the same but the quantity of each was much less than what the recipe  appears here.
The servings it stated, was for two.
What a fiasco I had! The ingred.printed in our newspaper are as follows:  1 tbls. plus 1 3/4 tsp. butter, 3 tbls. plus 1/2 tsp. self rising flour, 3 tbls. plus 1/2 tsp. sugar, 3 tbls. plus 1/2 tsp. milk, 1/4 can pineapple chunks, 1 tbl. plus1 3/4 tsp. brown sugar and 1/4 jar (4 oz.) cherries.  I stated the same 400 oven for 30 min. And in an
 8X8X2 pan naturally it burned and never rose.

Overall this is a yummy desert but I made several modifications. The recipe called for way TOO much butter. I halfed the butter, didn't add the cherries and added more pineapples. In the end it was more like buttery pineapple bars. Tasty but I would subtract even more butter next time.

This recipe was perfect!  I am NOT a cook but had to make a quick dish to bring to a Labor Day barbecue and this recipe saved me.  I had no problems with it being runny, although I did cook it in a disposable baking pan so maybe that helped.  Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly and it turned out very nice.  Didn't even have to hide it under ice cream.  It was actually more cake like than other cobblers I've had  but it still was delicious.  I got many compliments.

I made this for my family and we loved it!!! I added some ground cloves to the batter. Made served them both. Everyone said the clubbed made a big difference in flavor profile.

I was upset that I used part of my "treat" budget on this.  I don't think it mattered, but I left out the cherries, as my family does not like them.  The product was extremely buttery.  The pineapple was sickly sweet and added too much moisture, which caused the middle to be uncooked.  (Because of the butter browning the edges, I had to take it out of the oven.)

Delicious! I used a lot less butter, which did not detract from the taste and which ended up having the additional benefit of a better appearance. No burnt crispy edges because of the extra butter. Thank you for this! It's a great success every time!

I made this earlier in the week and behold! a teenage boy devoured half the cobbler while attention was elsewhere. His behavior was not 
correct, but his appetite is never wrong. Great dish!, according to all in the household. I'm making it a second time now, and let me tell you a spot of black espresso coffee and vanilla ice cream makes this a favorite dessert for everybody.

Delicious and easy to make! I used less butter and less sugar, and the end product was still plenty sweet because of the pineapples, which I used more of. I have made this several times now and everyone just loves it!

A quick and easy dessert. Tasted like a mock pineapple upside down cake. I would bring this to church for coffee fellowship and I'm sure everyone would enjoy it. I am going to try to bake at 375 for a bit longer as I thought the edges were a tad too brown.

Very Yummy, Very Easy!  Absolutely one for the recipe box.  It took no time at all to put together.  I did take some advice from the previous ratings and opted to use 1/4 cup of butter, rather than 1/2.  It was plenty buttery!

This was a quick & easy dessert that I made for my husband and daughter {as they both love pineapple}. They liked it okay, but didn't rave about it, so I have to give 4 stars on this one.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was disappointing. I love pineapple upsidedown cake - this is a mediocre imitation.  I would not make this again.  The cake part was tough.

I made this recipe in my new cast iron skillet and it turned out perfect! The iron skillet made the crust slightly crispy which tasted great.  I only used half of the butter that's called for and probably could have used even less. I had a can of dark sweet cherries that I added and they were excellent in the recipe.

Just O.K. I also used half the butter, it would have been real greasy with the full amount.  Next time I think I would add more pinapple and maybe something else to jazz it up a little.

This was great! We loved it. We also reduced the butter by one quarter to one half, and it was fine. This is very much like pineapple upside down cake, and would have been even better with the cherries (which we didn't have). Definitely a keeper! Very light and refreshing.

I made this recipe for a get-together with friends. It turned out pretty soggy and watery in spite of draining pineapples well. I ended up baking it for a lot of additional time just to get rid of the water. I did not enjoy it much. However, a couple of my friends who HATE desserts loved it. Go figure it!
