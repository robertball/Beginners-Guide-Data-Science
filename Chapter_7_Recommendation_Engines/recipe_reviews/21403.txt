My husband and I loved this recipe with just a few changes.  After reading the reviews we cut the sugar in half, but it was still too sweet and too hot for us.  So the next day we made another batch and we reduced the sugar to 1 Tbsp. and cut the cayenne in half.  I also sauteed the chopped onion and chopped ham in 2 Tbsp of butter to bring out more flavor before adding it to the beans.  Both times I precooked the beans after soaking overnight, then put all the ingredients together (including the tip about baking soda, used 1/4 tsp) in a crock pot with just enough boiling water to not quite cover, on high for about 2 hours before dinner.  A definite keeper!

Awesome!  Just like grandma used to make.  I reduced the brown sugar slightly to 1/3 cup.  And a pinch (maybe 1/2 tsp) of baking soda makes the beans creamy and much less gassy.

I blindly followed the recipe, it being rated 4.5/5 with 200 reviews, which usually means you really can blindly follow the recipe and come out shiny. WAY too sweet, I should have read the reviews first. It's better than the 1 star I'm giving it, but I'm trying (fruitlessly) to make up for you other reviewers who give it 5 stars while changing it completely. STOP IT!

This was so delicious I have been craving it ever since I finished the last triple batch I made;-)  A must have in any recipe book.  You can also cut back on the brown sugar and it's just as good.  I used the canned great northern beans from Bush's to eliminate the need to soak beans overnight.

My husband is a ham & bean afficionado and he really liked this recipe.  I thought it was just a little too sweet for my taste and I might cut back just a little on the brown sugar next time to keep us both happy.  But, I do think that adding that hint of sweetness is what makes the recipe really stand out from all the others.

I gave this 5 stars because it is a great basic recipe that can be adapted to different tastes and desires. It makes a great soup that has a wonderfully subtle sweet flavor and is extremely filling. My husband was not excited when I told him that we were having beans for dinner, but he was pleasantly surprised and even the my son who declared that he did not like beans and ham ate his entire bowl!!! I made this dish into a version of bean and ham soup.  To get around the long soaking period, place the beans into a large pot and cover with water.  Bring the water to a boil.  Boil for 5 minutes, turn the heat off and then leave the beans to soak for an hour.  After the hour soak, proceed wiht your recipe as usual.  To make my version of this recipe, I used frozen ham from our Christmas ham and then filled the pot up to the top with water.  After bringing the pot to a boil, I simmered the pot with a lid on to reduce the water loss.  I used 1/3 cup brown sugar along with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika.  While the pot simmered, I chopped a small onion and one pound of carrots.  I sauted the carrots and onion in butter until soft and slightly browned.  After simmering the beans for approximately 2 hours, I removed about one cup of beans, smashed them, returned them to the pot and added the sauted veggies.  I then let the pot simmer for about another 10 minutes while I cut crusty bread into slices. WHAT A WONDERFUL MEAL!!!

I found this recipe to be very good, I have been looking for ideas on how to improve plain ham and beans and came across this recipe and tried it and loved it, I will continue to make it this way from now on. I did substitue a 40 ounce jar of northern beans for the pound of dry beans, and next time I make it I might reduce the amount of brown sugar just slightly.

This dish turned out really great.  My whole family liked it, especially my husband.  I made it in the crockpot, and it took about 5 minutes to throw everything together, then I just let it cook on low all day.  I served it over white rice with fresh bread from the bread machine.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

I used a little more cayenne, and some Italian Seasoning.  Put everything together in the crock pot this morning, and tonight it's great!  Thanks very much, Stephanie, for a great idea on a winter night!  :)

The brown sugar overpowered the dish, and was too sweet for our likings. Other than that, everything else was O.K.

If you don't have time to soak the beans overnight (or forget), you can bring the beans and water to a rapid boil then cover and let rest for about an hour. It helps to add a little bit of EVOO or bacon grease (:?) and a pinch of sugar.  Just as good as soaking overnight. I also use Hot Sauce (Texas Pete) in place of the cayenne. Oh, and you don't need the brown sugar...at least not all of it.

Our family loved this recipe. Our family enjoyed it very much.

  I detest all the reviews where people go on and on as to how they changed the recipe to make it 5 stars.  Ladies, if you don't like the sound of a recipe and change it to YOUR recipe, you have no business reviewing it!

These beans were fantastic!!  I used 1/4 cup brown sugar, added 3 cloves of garlic, 2 bay leaves, a 1/3 stick of kombu (sea vegetable, adds delicious flavor and softens beans take out with the bay leaves before eating) and used a pound of pit ham.  Also added the onion while cooking.  Served with spoon bread.  Magnifico for a cold winter night!!  Thanks for sharing.

Gave this recipe four stars on my husband's say-so.  I thought it was very good, but I'm not much on beans so I bowed to his greater bean-eating experience.  I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup and put a bit more ham than called for.  I also boiled the meat off ham shanks and used the broth, with fat skimmed, as part of the cooking liquid.  I simmered it all day like I remembered my mom doing.  I can't imagine eating it after just a couple hours.  This recipe is a keeper.  I may end up eating beans more than once in a blue moon with this one!

My husband thought this was the best ham and beans that he had ever tried (well, except for his dearly departed mom's). After reading all the reviews about the brown sugar, I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and added 1/2 tsp of baking soda (as someone else recommended).

LOVED IT!  I cut the sugar to 1/4cup because I am not a huge fan of sweet.  And with the amount of cayenne, I thought the heat was only slightly detectable.  I threw everything in my crockpot on low for 8 hours and it came out PERFECT.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent recipe!  I love the sweet flavor, but I like to balance the sweet with some tangy by adding catsup.  Otherwise, it's perfect the way it is!

Expected this to come out a bit on the boring side, but my husband and I were both pleasantly surprised with the end results!  I modified it using canned beans.  I cut the sugar in half as recommended in many other reviews and I think it was just right; the full amount of sugar would have been far too sweet.  Also used red onion and added celery and garlic.  After sauteing the veggies I simmered the entire dish in some corned beef stock I had frozen after St Patty's dinner until reduced to my liking.  This was a wonderful blend of sweet, salty and heat from the cayenne.   Thanks so much for this keeper!

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this!  Substituted canned white kidneys (rinsed and drained) for the dry and only used 1 TBSP of brown sugar...it was still plenty sweet.  Only needed to cook for about 45 minutes.

It ain't pretty - but it is good!  My chef friend would call it a humble dish. I did this in my crockpot and with a hamhock - on low for about 12 hours.  I added a bit of paprika and some cornstarch at the end.  I like the sweet spicy comination.  I am not a spicy person, but I think, if anything I would add a little more heat.  I will make this again!

Excellent...provided the brown sugar is cut in half or less !   As the majority of reviewers of this recipe have stated...1/2 cup brown sugar is just too much (unless major sweetness is what you seek) - I cut the brown sugar to a scant 1/4 cup...and honestly could have gone less.  Thank you fellow reviewers...for if I had not read your reviews, I would have ruined a perfectly good leftover Christmas ham !!

Really good. I did cut down on the brown sugar and added more ham. Very good - not the best beans & ham I ever had, but still very, very delicious. Gonna make again. ***UPDATE*** I have made this multiple times. The last time, with pinto beans, which I thought were even better. I make a smaller batch - 2 cups of dry beans, 2 Tbs brown sugar, about 1/4-1/2 Tbs red pepper flakes, dry onion flakes, PLENTY of salt and peppr, and dice up ham and add baking soda. I do brown my ham in the pan before adding the beans. This is a good recipe for those who prefer beans not made with grease as flavoring.

I've never made ham and beans, so I was very happy when this surpassed my grandmother's flavor!  I made it exactly as directed, except I doubled the recipe when I realized I had a 2-pound bag of beans.  I wouldn't change a thing about it!  The cayenne pepper balanced out the brown sugar, and I didn't think it was too sweet at all.  I served it with cornbread. I will make this again and again.  Perfect!

My family always enjoys this bean recipe. The only (minor) gripe I have about it is that with the prescribed brown sugar, I think it's a bit on the sweet side. I usually put slightly less. Overall, great recipe.

We love this recipe so much I don't measure anymore and just cook to taste! The only thing we do differently is to saute the onions and ham in butter, then add the brown sugar & spices. Next we add a bit of chicken broth & the beans with liquid. Oh, & we use canned beans when we need to hurry & it still tastes great!

Very good recipe. Mine were a little watery so I took out 2 cups of beans, blended them in a food processor to make a paste, and added them back in to thicken it up.

This was sooooo good!! I used leftover honeybaked ham from Christmas. Since the ham itself was so sweet, I only added 1 tbsp of brown sugar and since I don't like beans hot, I reduced the cayenne pepper by half. Will make again!

My family loved this recipe.  I didn't want to mess with soaking the beans over night, so I bought a large jar of northern beans instead.  I added 1/4 cup water to the beans when putting them in the crockpot with the rest of the ingredients.  It turned out fantastic.  Wonderful flavor!

this is VERY good and very easy to make...I did make a few modifications, however (like many)...I used only about 2 Tbsp of brown sugar which was plenty for our tastes, used chicken broth instead of water, and used canned beans which saved a lot of time.  Everyone in my family loved it.

I give this a FULL 5 stars and here's why:  I'm not much of a cook but made this last nite (EZ) and my girlfriend who once when younger had to live on ham and bean soup for a couple of months straight said it was the very best she ever had.
My modifications were: went a little higher on brown sugar and the ham was a Brand Name Honey Ham leftover that was approx twice the amount called for. Keep the cayenne pepper at the reccommended amounts!

I used way less brown sugar (about 1/4th cup) because we weren't looking for southern-style baked beans.  I did add a few carrots (julienned) for colour for an added nutritional boost. Also used Tony's Cajun and Creole Seasoning...it was awesome!!

wow! so glad I found this recipe for my Memorial Day cookout. I at first just started cooking the beans with a hammock but thought there had to be a better way to make them taste good. Never thought to put brown sugar when making beans before. They were so good and a huge hit!

First you must know my children are VERY picky on the food they eat. This recipe is totally awesome. One bite and both children wanted more. I followed the directions exactly and there were no left overs. I will double the recipe next time so there are left overs.

Update!  I still make this using all the ingredients, but I just wanted to say this meal has become as traditional as the ham holidays!  A few days after Easter or Christmas, everyone always comes back over for ham & beans because of this recipe!  Everyone loves it.  I pair it with jalapeno cornbread.  
I use all the ingredients but I use the leftover ham bone from the Christmas ham with meat still attached to it.  Then I just throw everything in a crockpot and cook it on low 8-10 hours.  It is amazing.  The sugar & cayenne pepper really make this recipe special.

This is a really good base recipe! I'm not sure what people were talking about with it being too sweet/too spicy, but then again we all have different tastes. This tastes like what my Mom always makes out of the jar (only about 20 times better), and was SUPER cheap to make, especially considering I'm a poor just graduated college student who really can't afford too much. Only problem I had and isn't the recipes fault is that the dry beans I had were a bit old so the 8 hour soak + cooking them for -3- hours still left them a bit stale, but again, not the recipes fault. I know I personally added a bit more cayenne and some beef boullion to enhance the flavor a little bit, but again, this recipe is good for alterations for your tastes!

Very Good! I like the change of pace with the added sweetness of the brown sugar. I did cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup but otherwise kept to the recipe. Excellent when served over rice and with cornbread as a side.

I didn't really care for this recipe. I soaked the beans exactly as it said, but they never really got large or soft (I cooked this in the crock pot all day). Plus it was too sweet for my taste.

I made this for my husband and myself.  My husband couldn't eat it at all.  I was able to eat it but didn't find it to be as good as I have had before.  I think it might have been the brown sugar and I only put in 1/4 cup.  Next time I won't put in any brown sugar.

Delicious, but with some adjustments.  Instead of the beans I used 2 cans navy beans undrained and 2 cans black eyed peas undrained. Instead of the cayenne pepper I used one whole cayenne with the seeds included.  I just chopped it up with the onion in the food processor. Used a ham bone from a spiral ham and added enough water to cover all. Let it simmer til the ham fell off the bone. We loved it!

I was looking for the ham HOCK & bean recipe that gramma used to make.  Tried this in the crockpot, except just threw the Hocks in and let them cook all day with the beans.  Cut the meat off the hocks at the end...........MMMMMM!!  This was a great improvement over just beans, onion & hocks!  THANKS!

Just made this tonight and it was delicious! My mom was supposed to make her ham and beans for dinner tonight but she was sick so we stayed home...but I was still craving it! I did the quick soak method for the beans (rinse, boil for 2 mins, cover and take off heat. Let sit for 1 hour, rinse and begin normal recipe). It turned out wonderfully. I did the 1T brown sugar and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne plus 1/2t of baking soda. My husband and I practically inhaled it!

I took the advice of several other reviewers and reduced the brown sugar by half. I also pan fried the ham with onions for a few minutes before adding it to the beans. My family loved it.

Added less brown sugar (1/4 cup) and it was plenty sweet.

I used pinto beans instead, added chili sauce, italian seasoning, and 2 bay leaves.  I halved the sugar.  It was very tasty over rice.

I forgot to read the reviews before I starting making this. Wished I had, because it is too sweet.  One tbsp. would be enough. Used only 1/8 tsp. cayenne and it was plenty spicy.  The flavor is similar to baked beans with all that brown sugar.  I will keep searching for a creamy white bean side dish.

This recipe was so EASY to make!! The only thing I did differently was I added more onion and made this in my crockpot. It came out awesome!! Tasty!!  My picky 3 yrs old even ate this. YES it is a little sweet but we didnt find it to be overly sweet and in fact liked that it was different. My Gramdma asked me for the recipe !! Thanks for a great recipe!! :) :) :)

This was good. I did not put in all the sugar, just about 1 Tbsp and that seemed about right. I didn't put in the full amount of cayenne, but it was still too spicy for me, though not my husband. Next time will just allow everyone to add their own spice to it.

Too sweet!!! I love ham and beans and I was disappointed how this turned out. I think it was great start of the recipe I would add only at the most 1/4 cup.

WAY TO MUCH SUGAR.  I forgot to reread the reviews before I made this and didn't cut the sugar down.  I'll make this again but just like one other person suggested I'll probably cut it down to a table spoon and add after it is done cooking if I think it needs more.  Kinda mad because I made double to have left overs and not only was I able to eat it for left overs I ruined the only ham hock I had from our pig this year.

Instead of using water I use chicken stock. I also soak the beans overnight in half water and half chicken stock. It gives the beans more flavor! I also use a couple bay leaves to had some more flavor.

The recipe caught my eye because it called for brown sugar.  I grew up in Southern MO and it all my years of making ham and beans I have never used that ingredient.  It was a fantastic addition and added just a undertone of sweetness to the dish.

Very good and easy soup.  Better the next day.  I only cut the brown sugar in half and used probably twice as much ham.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  Thanks for the post!

It was perfect!  I think adding the whole 1/4 cup of brown sugar is completely just the right amount.  Also used 1 tbsp of cayenne to give it more of a kick.  Used a crock pot on low for about 8 hours - will be used many times!  Thanks!

After 8 hours of soaking and 2 hours of simmering, the beans were still not quite done to my liking.  That said, my husband nearly ate the entire pot, agreeing the entire time that the beans were not quite done.  But great flavor, he kept saying.  And it was.  Thanks for the recipe - I'll make this again for sure!

I used canned northern beans and decreased the amount of brown sugar.  I added extra ham because this was a main dish.  I served it with corn muffins and my family enjoyed.

I thought this was a great version of Ham and Beans.  The last hour of cooking the beans I added the onion and ham with them.  I think it gave it great flavor.  The cream of Mushroom soup and Cheese made it sooooo good!  YUMMY!!

Used to eat this all the time when i was younger, its a really cheap meal to prepare and its great. I was shocked to find out my husband had never had beans prepared this way, so i fixed it for him and my whole family gobbled it up. even my picky kids. Great with cornbread. Thanks  for sharing the recipe.

Too sweet as written....    I made it a second time cutting the sugar in half and added a clove of garlic and some diced carrots & celery, 1/2 cup each and added a pinch of baking soda to make the texture more creamy and liked it better the second time. Thank you.

Way better the 2nd day.  I made this recipe as given using 1 tsp salt, and served it with cornbread.  I used hickory smoked, sweet glazed ham, and I do think the type of ham you use affects the outcome.  The 1st meal was OK, but seemed bland.  It was so much better the 2nd time that I thought my taste buds must have been off for the first meal.  My husband confirmed the leftovers were far tastier.  So, if you can, put the cooked meal in the fridge at least overnight so the flavors can meld to create a truly superb dish.

Have this cooking in my crock pot now.  I followed the other reviewer's advice.  I also didn't have great northern beans and substituted black eyed peas.  I reduced the brown sugar to 1/3 a cup, used two packets of ham boullion, a packet of "Emeril's Seasoning," a bit of italian seasoning, and kept everything else the same.  I did saute the ham and onion in about 2 tbsp of butter prior to adding to the pre-soaked beans in my crock pot.  (More flavor)  It smells good so far.  I keep tasting the liquid and adding a bit of salt as needed.  (The beans really absord bit.)  I also added 1/2 tsp of baking soda to aid as a "de-gasser."

wonderful followed as written! Don't try to substitute ham hocks for ham, though. A nice ham bone works great in place of just leftover ham.

I used less brown sugar than the recipe called for after reading some of the other reviews. Turned out very good. This was my first time making and eating Ham and Beans. My husband liked it but he was not used to eating Ham and Beans that have sugar in it so I think he would have preferred it without.

Husband loved this soup.  Only used half the brown sugar.  Did not add the cayenne since he does not like hot things.  I cooked all day in the crock pot on low (10 hours).

I have made this twice and it always turns out delicious. I use 2 cans great northern beans instead of the dried beans..it is a wonderful way to use up leftover spiral sliced ham!

Absolutely love this recipe, but like others cut down the brown sugar and increased the cayenne and added tomatoes.  It is really a great recipe and I highly recommend it.

My wife gave it a 4 as she likes ham and beans and she is the one who requested it.  I gave it a 2 because I don't.  To me, it was very bland and the texture was not pleasing.  However, my wife thought it tasted mostly like ham and beans is supposed to.

Good basic recipe. I personally did not like the level of sweetness, I cut the sugar in half and it was still a little sweet for me. Great for Christmas leftovers.

I started out with ham and beans on my own. I wanted to see how other people made it so here I am. I used all the same ingredients except no pepper at all and i used the baking soda and i just put in a handful of brown sugar and a dash of salt. I also added some seasoning blend frozen onions and parsley. It was my first time making them and I will be making them again soon.

My family really enjoyed this dish.  I used a leftover ham bone with plenty of meat on it, used only 1/4 cup or less of brown sugar, added 1/4 tsp of baking soda and did use about 1/2 tsp cayenne.  I also added 2 carrots, one onion and two celery ribs.  Came out very nice - great flavor and the carrots, celery and ham chunks gave it some color

This was the best ham and beans recipe I have ever made!  I took the lazy route and used 5 cans of Bush's Northern Beans instead of soaking beans overnight...  I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar as suggested by others and added a bit more ham than suggested, but followed recipe otherwise.  I let the ingredients simmer for an hour...  Yum!

I tweaked it a bit. Italian seasoning instead of Parsley, 1/4 cup brown sugar, celery & green peppers w/ the onion, a ham steak, season salt instead of regular salt, and the "ham" packet from bean package. I used the crock pot (I boiled the beans for about an hour on the stove to soften them) & let it cook all day long. My husband is actually eating the left-overs - a miracle! I'll definitely save this recipe & use it again.

I make this dish once or twice a month I love it so much.  It's a three day process for me...day one: soak the beans overnight, then cook the mixture all day no day two, day three: eat!  I like to make soups and stews a day before I am going to eat them for the fullest flavor.

The cayenne! That gives this bean pot a real life! I used a ham hock I had in the freezer. I swear I see tomatoes in the photo, so I chopped two romas and added them last, just heating them through.  This recipe is closer to my Mom's beans than I've ever been able to duplicate. Thanks! :)

I was looking for a Ham and Bean recipe like the one my Grandmother used to make. I saw all the great reviews and thought I'd try this one, even though it calls for sugar, which I don't remember ever being in ham and beans I had ever eaten. I tried it anyway. My husband and I thought it was just OK at best. It was WAY to sweet. I felt like I had made homemade Pork n Beans instead of ham and beans. I'm beginning to wonder now if purhaps that's what people call it. Even as a Pork n Bean dish, it wasn't very good at all. I wont be making this ever again. Instead I'll leave out the sugar and see if that is more to what Im looking for.

Nothing beats making ham and beans with your left over Christmas ham, and especially THIS recipe!! Way better than the traditional ham and beans I had growing up. This had much more flavor and as constantly requested at my house from my fiance. *Save your ham bones, stick them in your freezer, and use them in this recipe. You will need a little more ham cut up to make it more meaty. But the meat just fall right off! Serve it with corn bread, and depending on the person- honey, syrup, or ketchup! Yum, yum!!

This was delicious! I cut down on the sugar (by half) as recommended by other reviewers and thought it was perfect. The spice was nice - it was a little strong to eat plain but over rice my family really enjoyed it. Might want to back off the cayenne pepper a little bit if you have mild mouths in the house, but I don't like things TOO spicy and I thought it was great. The ham blended so nicely with the beans. I used pintos because it's all I had and they were great. Yum!

As a young child my mother would always force me to eat beans and ham.  I decided to try this recipe in the hopes that since I am now a grownup my tastes had changed and I would like them.  Wow was I right.  This recipe was incredible.  I ended up eating two full bowls and my guests said they were very good also. I did use a ham left ver from Thanksgiving dinner that had a galze on it.  this added a wonderful flavor to the recipe.

Wow.... This stuff is amazing. I brought it into work for a carry-in and EVERYONE was impressed! My bf is a butcher so he brought home some fresh cubed ham (yummy).. I used two jars of Randall's Great Northern Beans, sauteed the onions and ham together in butter, put all ingredients into crock pot and let cook all day long. I did cut back the brown sugar to just a couple of pinches. Best ham and beans I've ever had! Thanks for the post!

Used canned beans to shorten cooking time.  Delicious just the same.  Next time I will put the cooked ham in just a few minutes before serving so as not to make it tough.

I don't know if I did something wrong or not, but WAY too sweet for us.  I did not like the brown sugar and neither did my husband.  When he saw me add it in he looked at me, but becuase most 4-5 star recipes are good he went along with it.  Unfortunately we ended up throwing out our leftovers because we just couldn't take the sweetness.

This was my first time to make beans that weren't out of a can.  Due to health concerns and other reviews, I left out the brown sugar.  I don't know if it was because of that, but it was just tasteless.  After cooking the ham so long, it lost its flavor completely.  I think next time, I will try to add kielbasa or smoked sausage the last half hour of cook time.  This site also recommends that you add the salt and pepper after the beans are done cooking, otherwise the flavor will be boiled away.  They were right!

I used my crockpot for this recipe.  Soaked the beans overnight and proceeded per the recipe.  Tweaked the flavor by using a flavored hot sauce instead of tabasco.  This is a keeper!

We enjoyed this recipe.  It is simple to put together with everyday ingredients.  I used a whole pound of ham since I made this as the main dish.  Also cut back and used only 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Served with a side of chopped spinach.  Reheated the leftovers with the spinach mixed in and that was a nice combination of flavors and textures.

I made this for a birhtday Party which was near St Pattys day. With the cornbeef cabbage, cornbread.  I cooked 4 lbs of beans everyone loved them. There was none left at end of night!! I didnt have any cayenne pepper which I usually always have.  I cant wait to make them next time adding that.  I followed other suggestions and didnt put as much brown sugar as the recipe calls for.  Anyway Good Beans!!!

This is the best recipe I've tried for ham and beans.  There's just a hint of sweetness from the brown sugar.  My husband and 11 month old son loved them.  I'll definately make them again.  Very simple.

Anyone who does not read even 4-5 ??reviews is just naive! Or lazy. A great basic recipe which I followed but I always do my own thing with spices anyway. We like garlic - lots of it! I followed the basic how to but used chopped white onion, 3 cloves pressed garlic, 1 bay leaf, a 1/4 tsp white pepper, 1/2 tsp baking soda (a tip gleaned from the reviews - so thanks!) and generous tablespoon of dried parsley. This suited our tastes for savory rather than sweet.

Loved this recipe. The beans really absorb flavors unlike other beans. Used our own bone in ham which was only cured. I did take advice from others on here and reduced brown sugar to 1/4 cup, I figured if it wasn't sweet enough I would add the other 1/4 cup later. Didn't need it. Other than this I followed exactly. Didn't taste the cayenne but I will probably leave as is next time we fix this.

I used my crockpot and it turned out awesome! I didn't use the cayenne pepper due to allergies but now I'm making it again for tomorrow nights dinner and I will add the pinch of baking soda that was recommended. Love this recipe!!

I altered this recipe just a little. Made this with Kielbasa instead of ham and I used only 1/3 cup of brown sugar . This was absolutely delicious !!  Add a side salad and its a perfect meal !
We will make this again. 
Thank You for posting the recipe

Several people said it was too sweet so I reduced the 1/2 cup of brown sugar to 2 heaping tbsp. Couple people said it was too hot, but I kept the cayenne pepper it called for cause I like a lil spice, and I was glad I did! I also took the advice to add 1/4 tsp of baking soda for creaminess. At the end I dissolved 2 tbsp of corn starch, using the juices from the soup, added it and let it simmer for about another 20 mins. I added 1 cup of milk at this time to add to the creaminess. I sauteed the onions like someone suggested. And instead of just dicing ham I used the whole ham hock and I added about 2 cups of diced chunks as well. The cook time said 2 hrs on the beans, I'm not sure if it's my altitude or what (9,000 ft), but it took about 3 hrs total to cook. Hope this helps. It sure is yummy!

Amazing!  It's not your traditional ham & beans, which is what I love about it.  You can easily tweak it to your preference of sweetness or "heat," but I make it just as the recipe reads.  And we LOVE it!!!

Delicious! I lowered the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and since I Decided to try this at the last minute I used canned bush's beans. I also added one chicken bullion cube. Served with homemade buttermilk cornbread!

Made this tonight and it was exceptionally good! The only changes that i made were using onion powder instead of actual onion (only because i didn't have an onion). I doubled the recipe, and reduced the brown sugar. I cooked it in the crock pot and my husband, who hates ham and beans, devoured it and said i can make again! Keeper for sure!

This is my favorite ham and beans recipe. It's become a winter staple in our house. It almost makes the cold weather outside bearable. I kind of cheat a little and use canned beans. (Don't judge me.)

Turned out great BUT I only added half the brown sugar, as suggested by many of the comments. It would have been way way way too sweet had I followed the recipe as written.

YUM!! I grew up with ham & beans, but my dad's recipe was always so bland. I had no idea the secret ingredient was brown sugar, but that makes perfect sense! I'm going to pass this recipe on to him, now... I can't wait to eat these leftovers! My husband really liked this recipe, too, and he has never had ham & beans before. Thanks for an easy and fantastic soup!

Great recipe. However, I did make a few minor changes. I added 2 jalapeños in place of the cayenne pepper, one leek in place of the onion and I added a whole ham hock and laid it on top of the beans while cooking. Once cooking was complete, I diced the ham hock into bite sized pieces. Great recipe.

Loved, loved, loved this.  Perfect comfort food for winter. I followed the recipe exactly and served with crusty cornbread and a green salad.  I was a little concerned about the brown sugar, but it worked.  Delicious - I will definitely make this again.

I love, love, love this recipe!  I am actually making this right now for at least the fifth or sixth time.  I, like many others, use much less brown sugar, maybe 2 tablespoons.  I also add 2 cups of fordhook lima beans and 2 tablespoons of butter.  Delicious!!!

This was very, very good. My Hubby just loved it. After reading the reviews I made a few changes. I sauteed some onions, 2 stalks of celery and 3 cloves of garlic. And I cut the brown sugar in half. I think I will add even less than that next time. It was still on the border of being to sweet. Overall though it was really good.

It was perfect. I did add some rose mary  and a little extra cayenne pepper. Made corn bread and what a wonderful meal. Made 2 pounds of beans with left over ham. Gave me gas everytime I ate it but hey that was a plus! LOL I got the bed to myself!!!!

Of my favorite foods to eat. One time I forgot the brown sug completely but it still turned out ok. I definitely recommend the sugar though. I always just used canned beans and it turns out just fine. The only thing I would recommend (if you're going the canned bean route since you don't have to cook it as long) is to sautee the onions separately before you add them or they will be too firm/flavorless which throws off the texture of the dish and made it unpleasant.

Enjoyed this one. I used 6 cans of Great Northern beans rinsed. Used Chicken Broth instead of water and added a dash or two of liquid smoke. Also made the Waikiki Cornbread listed on this site as well. Tastes great together!

These are good but I agree with others they are just a little too sweet as written.  I will make them again but cut the brown sugar down to half.

I made a quick version of this recipe. I bought 4 cans of Northern beans. I only used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar(that made it sweet enough). I also added 1/2 a cup of chicken stock and turned this dish into a stew. Let it simmer for a bit and it's ready. I loved the sweet and spicy taste of this meal!

TOTALLY disappointed!! It was brown, mushy and tasteless. Really visually unapealling. I cooked it less than the suggested time and the beans were dissolved. Reduced the sugar to 1 TBS & it was still too sweet & cut the pepper to a dash which could account for the lack of taste but; not making chili.

I would give this 5 stars after the changes.  I made these today with leftover ham bone and ham from Christmas dinner that I had in the freezer.  I just used a regular cooking pot rather than a crockpot, so did not soak them overnight.  I just bring them to a full boil, then reduce heat to medium low and simmer till tender.  I have to agree with other reviewers that the sugar needs cut down by at least half for my taste, but some people like sweet beans.  I am not a big fan of ham, only have it once a year usually, so my suggestion is to cook the beans with meat from "country style" ribs.  Just make sure you remove all bones.  I love this meat in my beans!

We have been eating ham and beans since I was a kid but never made it like this. I love this recipe because it is simple. My husband likes it better than any other ham and beans he has tried. Something has to be pretty awesome to replace a family recipe and this one certainly did! The only change I made was reducing the amount of brown sugar used as stated in previous reviews.

This was the ham and beans that I have been missing so much.  My grandma and aunt both made it all the time when we came and visited, but now that they are gone, they took the recipe to their graves.  This recipe almost tasted just like theirs.  Awesome!!!

In my opinion, brown sugar ruins this recipe. My family couldn't eat it. I took it over to my mother, and she couldn't eat it either. We'll stick to more traditional recipe in the future that includes NO sugar of any kind. We like the flavor of the ham.

I thought this was great!  I must admit, I'm don't use precise measures, so I dashed in the chili powder for enough of a bite & just threw in the brown sugar until it looked/smelled right.

Absolutely awesome recipe!  I love how the Cayenne pepper brings out the sweetness in the beans!  I suggest making a double batch otherwise there probably wont be any leftovers!

I thought this recipe was really good.  My husband and I get a pig each year and with all the good cuts of meat come a bunch of pork hocks we never know what to do with.  I boiled some frozen hocks first and then cubed the meat and simmered that with canned Northern beans for 1.5 hrs.  I used slightly more cayenne than called for as we prefer things spicy and used 1/4-1/3 cup brown sugar as others suggested.  Very good, would definitely make again!

This was way too sweet for my family.  I think though, this recipe has potential as a great side dish for BBQ as a substitute for traditional baked beans.  I think cutting back the ham or substituting with bacon to make it more of a side dish would make it really good.  I will try it out and post it if it works out.  This time, I sauted the onions and ham in 2tbsp butter before adding the rest of the ingredients to the dutch oven .  I used 1/2 tsp garlic salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, and 1/2 tsp sea salt for the season to taste part.  And it still could not cut the sweetness.  I did cut the cayenne to 1/8tsp because my hubby doesn't like spicy at all.  The black pepper was too much for him.  I cooked it extra long to make them extra creamy.  Just read the baking soda trick.  Will try that next time to cut down on cooking time.

I didn't know how much 1/2 lb of ham would be, I had a large ham so I chopped up 3 cups worth.  Softened the onion in butter first.  Used 1/4 cup brown sugar since my ham had a glaze.  No salt added.  Used 1/2 tsp pepper. Added 1 tsp cornstarch the last 20 min while the corn bread was cooking.

Very Very yummy..... here's what I did.. just changed it up a little bit.  I used a 40 oz jar of beans, chopped three stalks of celery, a cup of chopped carrots, bay leaf and reduced the brown sugar to 1/3c.  I used a smoked ham and cooked on low for about 2hrs.  It was sooo good!!  Also kept the Cayanne pepper and didn't seem too spicy, my husband is kind of sensitive to spice and he said he loved it!

I might have messed this up.  I put the bean seasoning in with this in the slow cooker and it turned out way way too salty.  Next time I will leave the bean seasoning out and see how it turns out.

My dh wants me to make this every week now!  THese are wonderful!  I took the suggestion and cut down the brown sugar to 1/4cup.  I also use about 1/2t. of the cayenne, but we like a kick.  I have made this almost a dozen times and it has turned out fabulous each time!

I absolutely love the cayenne pepper add to this Ham and Bean recipe.  Blends well with the other ingredients to create that "I must have more of those beans" attitude;)  I now only make this recipe when in the mood for northern beans;)

Followed recipe except used 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup like reviews suggested and added 1/2 cup diced carrots I had on hand. First time making ham & bean soup and only ever had the canned version so I was semi nervous about the taste comparison. My beans weren't tender after soaking overnight and I've never used dry beans so I did simmer them for an hour In water before adding everything (I assume I didn't soak them In enough water possibly). Simmered everything for 1 1/2 hours till tender. Turned out amazing! Don't think I'll ever eat canned ham & bean soup again. 5 stars for taste and easy to follow directions!

My husband said these were better than his mammas beans!  Wow!  I made this in the crockpot left out the cayenne pepper and just threw the ham in uncooked also a little bit of chopped up bacon just because I had some I needed to use.  This was really really good and I am normally not a fan of beans.

The recipe definitely is too sweet for my taste so I'm giving it 4 stars. I made it using only 1/4 cup and it still tasted really sweet. Other than that, the recipe is absolutely delicious.

Excellent recipe! We love homemade cornbread crumbled up in beans and cabbage on the side...makes for an excellent easy meal. I didn't have ham, so I substituted bacon, based on previous reviews added a pinch of baking soda and a few stalks of celery. A definate keeper!

These are fantastic! I'm from Arkansas and never made ham and beans before. I love finding good simple recipes that don't need embellishment and this is one of them. I used 1/3 cup brown sugar after reading reviews. I'll try it with just 1/4 cup next time. And I took a suggestion and added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to get rid of the gassiness. Next time, I'll also cook them uncovered. I had too much water left when they were done, but I drained it off and they were still fantastic. I served this dish with mustard greens, cornbread and black-eyed peas. This is a wonderful southern staple!

This is so easy and savory, as well as healthy!  I followed tips like using less brown sugar, omitted the hot sauce since I don't like spicy, and added the baking soda.  BIG TIP: I did read some information that says adding baking soda to beans will remove the vitamin B.  So I won't do that again.  I wonder if the taste will be different the next time I make it without that.  Tasted perfect over brown rice.  Add this to your favorites!

made yesterday, had to add additional seasonings to get more flavor but was still a little bland, I think I will add more seasoning next time maybe more garlic & pepper, I did use crushed red pepper not cayenne, I didnt use enough though, and I added shredded carrots, and used red onion, only used 2 TBL. brown sugar might use 3 next time. I also used a can of chicken broth. This was good but not great, but could be with the right additions, thanks

This is the best recipe for ham and beans that I have found. It is slightly sweet and adding a few drops of your favorite hot sauce to each bowl makes it absolutely perfect. Serve with fresh, hot cornbread and you have a wonderful meal on a cold winter night!

Oh my goodness, this was Wonderful!!  I used 2 tsps of the brown sugar and it was just sweet enough.  it was absolutley perfect!!  Oh, and I used 2 cans of the beans instead of the dried beans, a pound of pre diced & cooked ham and I only simmered it for about 45 minutes.

As is, this is 3 stars, just because it is so sweet!  I will try it again without the sugar.

Can't say that this is a favorite. Made this for a church potluck and by the amount brought back home, I'm not the only person not impressed. Definitely didn't need the brown sugar. I also cooked up the ham and onion together for a little extra flavor, that much smelled and tasted amazing! The whole combination was not appetizing in the least. I would have been better off just to make my ham and bean soup.

I made this last night & it was a total hit. I took out the sugar & forgot to add the onions. I did add 3 Bay leaves & Lawry's season salt. I also put it in the crock pot & let it cook on low for about 8-9hrs. My fiance could not stop eating it.

My hubby and I really liked this one....but will make a few changes next go.  It was a bit sweet for our taste, although neither of us thought it was "too" sweet.  We prefer spicy however and plan to "heat it up" a bit next time, adding some crushed red pepper and lessoning the brown sugar just a tad.  Kido was home when we thawed and heated up the leftovers and agreed with his father and I.

This was absolutely delicious!  I basically made this recipe "as is" except I used canned instead of dry beans, and added some garlic.  I did not think it was too sweet, as others have mentioned.  I truly thought this recipe was spot on.  My 18 month and five year old loved it, my nine year old picky eater only ate the ham, but my husband, who gagged at the thought of having this meal, was VERY impressed.  We will work this into our regular rotation.  Thanks for the post!

I guess it's a matter of personal taste, but no one in my family enjoyed it.  I cut the sugar way down as suggested, but it still came out too sweet for us.

The main change I made to this was using canned beans as I despise messing with dried beans.  That created some guessing on water amounts etc., and I cooked it sort of "backwards."  i.e. I put all the other ingredients in first, covered with water, and let that cook for a while to blend the flavors & bring the ham flavor out.  Then added the (undrained) beans last so they wouldn't get mushy, and cooked a bit longer to heat them through.  It ended up rather soupy, so I then let it cook down some more.  I ended up liking it soupy better. LOL.  Not a bad little recipe. Interestingly, I'm not into sweet stuff much, didn't read the reviews first, used all the brown sugar, and did not find this too sweet at all.  It was a bit odd, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

I only gave this 3 stars because I made several modifications.  I reduced the brown sugar by half or more, doubled the cayenne pepper and added chicken broth to make it more of a soup.  Very tasty with changes.

My husband requested ham and beans when we ended up with lots of Christmas leftovers. I had never made it before, and I found this recipe. What a wonderful surprise! This dish is a delicious comfort food that I will be making again. I used only 1/3 cup of brown sugar because I didn't want it to be too sweet, and it turned out just right. Thank you for such a great dish!

Is this recipe supposed to be soupy? I filled the pot so I could just barely see water in it but it turned out very liquidy.  I used half the sugar and I think the flavour is nice for a side dish except it's too runny.  However, it's too sweet for a bowl of soup. I also tried mashing some beans to thicken it but it didn't work.

Followed recipe.  Extremely bland.  Zero flavour.  The consistency was nice in that the beans didn't break apart, otherwise I'd rate this recipe a one star.

This was really good, I didn't have any cayenne, so I used cajun seasoning.  And my beans weren't quite as "soft" as I like them to be.  Will make again, maybe let it sit in the crockpot all day next time.

The sweetness of the brown sugar and the hot bite of the cayenne is what made this dish really stand out! Was a little nervous about the brown sugar so only usd 1/4 c. It depends on personal taste but I felt the 1/4 c. was the perfect amount, anymore would have made it too much.  Used a ham bone from a spiral ham I had left over and threw in 2 chix. bouillon cubes, we did not find it too salty but some may. We really liked this!

My family loves this recipe.  The sweetness, coupled with a little fiery kick (I add a little extra cayenne pepper!) is delicious.  I usually buy an inexpensive ham hock and the flavor is great.  Thanks for sharing this easy slow-cook dish.

This is the WORST ham and bean soup, myself and my family have tried. It was very bland tasting, and the brown sugar gave it a very odd taste. Maybe if a ham bone had simmered with the beans it may of helped.Ehat a waste of ingredients. I wouldn't recommend anyone trying this!

It smelled wonderful while cooking, and my son who has aversions to a lot of foods ate a bowl without complaint and even said it was good.
I try to follow a recipe as close as possible the first time I make it, but I was using what I had on hand.  I had a ham bone left over from holiday and I boiled  it and then cut the ham off the bone, using the water I boiled it in to cook the beans in.  I used pinto beans, because that is what I had.  I only added 1 Tablespoon of brown sugar and did not add cayenne because my son won't eat anything spicy.  However, I did add garlic.

Soak those beans overnight!   I did reduce the brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  Set slow cooker on HIGH for 5 hrs and low for 2 hours! Perfect and great flavor.  Thanks.

I reduced the brown sugar to 4 tbsp. (1/4 of recipe amount) and it was still very sweet. Next time I think I will leave the brown sugar out entirely, as the ham itself is sweet enough IMHO.

My family was never fond of ham and beans cause it was always bland without any flavor. So I searched out a recipe and found this and it was a hit. If I talk about making Ham and Beans they say I better make them like last time. The only time all of them were finished including leftovers. This is a recipe to save!!!

Too sweet. I added liquid smoke and ham stock just to cut the sweetness of the brown sugar.  If I make this again, I may not add the sugar at all.

I made it first just the way you suggested and it was just great, but I never could leave well enough alone.
The second time I browned the onions plus some garlic in bacon grease (sorry ya'll)  before adding the beans  and ham to the pot. I also substituted 1/4 cup maple syrup for the brown sugar (I was out of brown sugar)  and doubled the cayenne (YEP!).  It was also great this way -  and it made my spice-loving husband sooooo  very  happy!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

I must preface by saying I do not like bean soup or beans and ham, and never will. My husband however has asked for it for years. His mother and grandmother always made it. He loves it. Now, this recipe is crazy easy and he went nuts. Tasted better than he remembered. The only thing I changed is how I made it. I just wanted one large serving, so I used a can of cannelini beans, I had a ham steak in the freezer, so cubed that up  I threw all the ingredients as written in the Instant Pot with a couple cups of water and pressure cooked for half hour. I was going to make cornbread, but he said he had to have a crusty bread, so he went to the store for a baguette. Seriously, that excited for ham and beans. He claimed it was the best most perfect ham and beans ever. His words. Then he complained about the lack of leftovers. Smh.

Great as is. We made a couple changes per our tastes like adding a can of petite diced tomatoes for acid to balance the flavor and chicken broth instead of water. Used leftover grilled ham steak since it was in the house. Love to serve it over cornbread. Sounds odd but it’s amazing that way.

I agree with a previous poster who said not to give 5 stars if you did not make the recipe as stated.  5 stars gives the impression that it is pretty perfect as is.  I did make some modifications, mainly cutting down on the brown sugar to about 1 tablespoon, added a little diced carrot, and substituted a 5 pepper combination from Sam's Club instead of cayenne.  With those modifications, it was PERFECT!

I made this but instead of doing the beans the way you suggested, I simply added 2 cans of white northern beans instead which greatly cut down my cooking time. I am making this for dinner again tonight with some small variations - I used 2 cans of Great Northern Beans, I cut the amount of Cayenne Pepper in half (I did not the first time and it was just too much for our taste) and I just threw all the ingredients into the crock pot and will cook on high for approximately 4 hours until it smells like time to eat! I absolutely love this recipe and it literally takes less than 5 minutes to prepare and the crock pot does all the work. I am making pudding style corn bread (adding a can of cream of corn and a bit of brown sugar) to serve with it. Thank you so much for this recipe!!

Cooked in slow cooker for 8 hours instead of letting beans soak overnight.  I forgot to add the sugar, but added 2 tsp onion powder and put the onions in about 1 hour prior to serving.  Turned out great!

I made it as the recipe said except for the Cayanne pepper (I NEVER use the hot peppers).  I did NOT like the sweetness of the dish made with the brown sugar.  I prefer the beans made with ham, onion, water, salt and pepper.  I will NOT use this recipe again.

Good recipe. I gave it four stars because like other reviewers, I cut the sugar in half. That was perfect. Just a hint of sweet and a hint of spice. I used leftover Christmas ham and a ham hock.

I used an eleven bean mix with split peas and grain.  I cut back on the brown sugar, but then added in molasses for color and flavor.  I added a quart of home canned tomato, so I didn't need additional liquid.

I always cut back on spices, so I'm still rating this recipe as excellent.  I followed the recommendation of others and added about a tablespoon of brown sugar and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper. You could certainly add more to taste. I also used a jar of great northern beans to be able to eat these on a weeknight.  Made cornbread and it was perfect on a snowy evening!

LIke many other reviewers we found it a bit too sweet.  Upon making it a second time I cut the brown sugar in half.  I also added 4-5 drop of liquid smoke to give it a bit of a smokey flavor.  Much better.  We will continue to make it this was from now on.  

I suspect that the amount of brown sugar in the original recipe is a hold over from the child era.  Kids tend to like sweets.

we had some leftover ham so I decided to try this recipe. I only used 1 T brown sugar per some of the reviews. I used 1/4 teaspoon cayenne but found it needed more cayenne. I added another 1/4 teaspoon and still thought it could use more. Next time (there likely will be a next time) I think I will do 3/4 teaspoon total and see how that it. It would be good with greens, too.

Excellent! Tastes great, easy to make, and it even freezes well. Like many others, I cut the amount of sugar in half and for my family it was perfect, sweet but not too sweet. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I got rave reviews for this recipe. I have to admit I found it really tasty made as listed in the recipe. The only thing I would change is just increase the cayenne a bit because I personally like the spicy!

Very good and extremely easy. I added the left over bone from a Honey Baked Easter Ham. I didn't add the brown sugar as I was making it for someone who is diabetic. I added diced red potatoes and I cooked in a crockpot on low for about 7 hours.

First off...I know this is listed under "ham soup", but this is not soup. It is Ham and Beans. This is a Southern thing for many. Serve it with cornbread and this is a classic Southern meal. I am originally from the North, but married a Southerner and have lived in the South for several years. I had to learn the "basics" of Southern cooking from his family and online. This is a basic comfort food. 
Now to the recipe, I read that some felt this was too sweet. The first time I made it I added just a shy short of 1/2 cup of Brown sugar. We had no leftovers. I made it again tonight with 1/3 cup of sugar to see if there was much difference. We  didn't notice much difference in sweetness. The cayenne balances the sweetness. I added a little garlic to it as well. I made it both times in my electric pressure cooker. I'm still trying to perfect the right amount of water  and timing for the recipe  with the pressure cooker, but this recipe is a keeper for us. (I don't use the amount  of water called for since cooking with the pressure cooker is different). The pressure cooker bypasses the need to soak the beans and makes this a fairly quick, easy, simple meal. And it's fairly cheap too. Thanks for the recipe.

I will not make it again. It had good flavor for the base groups. It was very savory. The problem was the sugar. It made it taste odd. I would suggest adding a larger onion, more cayenne, and omit all the sugar. I was disappointed .

I give it four stars because it was just a tad sweet for us. I also substituted onion powder for the chopped onion. I used canned Great Northern Beans, and bought Honey Maple Ham from the deli and just had them cut me off a 1/2 pound chunk, so I could cube it up myself. It turned out great.

Loved this recipe. Very simple but great. Used 2 cans of rinsed  great northern beans because that is what I had, cooked onion and leftover ham in a little butter before adding beans and other ingredients, added a little chicken broth and decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. Delicious, will definitely make again.

I made a double batch - doubled everything except ham and brown sugar. I used 1 1/2 pounds of ham and left the brown sugar at 1/2 cup.   Threw everything in the crockpot and went to bed.   Had an awesome lunch.   Thanks for the recipe.

Followed some changes suggested by other reviewers. Soaked beans over night, boiled them 90 minutes and put them in crock pot with ham and onion lighted browned in butter. Reduced sugar to 1 T, added 1/2 t of baking soda and decreased cayenne pepper to 1/8 t ( I would have liked it hotter but my hubby doesn't like hot foods) I added a ham hock. covered with enough filtered water to cover and cooked on high for 3 hours then on low for 3 hours. Very good!

As others have noted, preparing according to the recipe results in a dish that is way too sweet. Next time, I'll cut the brown sugar to about 2 tablespoons.

Excellent with the reduction of the brown sugar by half.  Any more would have tasted too much like baked beans.   Added a bit of garlic powder too but I add that to everything!  Thank you!  I will make again.  It sets itself apart from the run of the mill ham and beans.

I only had a half hour to dinner time.... I used 3 cans great northern beans,  fried up the onions and ham together in the pan to increase flavor, then added the spices.  The recipe given probably would taste more flavorful, but this quick adaption worked fine over brown rice!  We like greens, so would probably add it over steamed kale with the brown rice next time.

I cut the sugar in half and cut the pepper even more since my wife requested those changes. It was pretty tasteless until I added some chicken bouillon. I didn't add more water, just the bouillon. Much better.

This was surprisingly good! So much so that I'm doing my first review. :) I've not been a fan of beans and ham in the past but had extra ham we needed to use. I did a 1/4 cup of the brown sugar and it was just right. Great flavor! It reduced quickly and only took about an hour. Would definitely make it again!

Yummy and a great way to use up leftover ham! I cut way back on the sugar, as recommended by most reviewers, adding 1.5 Tbs.  I sauteed the onions and a sliced carrot in 1Tbs oil and butter, until the onions were soft, before adding the remaining ingredients. Used canned beans and added a cup of cubed butternut squash and 2 tablespoons red quinoa along with the ham and beans. Added a pinch of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp ground corriander, cooked 20 minutes, and during the last 2 minutes of cooking, added 1/4 tsp baking soda to reduce gassiness from the beans (per another reviewer's suggestion), 1Tbs cornstarch to thicken the remaining liquid, and about 4 oz bean sprouts, just to use those up.  A lot of changes , I know, but, other than the reduced sugar, I dont  think they were absolutely necessary to make this dish delicious. This recipe is very forgiving and allows one to swap out or add veges and grains that are on-hand, and spices to taste, which makes it a great recipe!  And substituting canned beans drastically reduces the cooking time and you can have the meal on the table in under 30 minutes, start to finish!

I made it like my Mom did and added a liberal amount of Worcestershire sauce, plus a big squirt of ketchup and mustard and several shakes of white pepper.  The extra seasoning balances the sweetening from the brown sugar.

Made it tonight with leftover ham steak. I used a lb of it, less brown sugar & cayenne pepper & added smoked paprika which IMO turned this dish up a notch. first i sauteed the onions in the spices in a tablespoon of oil. also used canned beans (1 white and 1 chili) using the sauce in the chili bean can and used a few oz of beef broth. ended up a lil thin, but that ain't nothin' a lil cornstartch can't fix! my kids tore it up :)

This was pretty good.  Personally, I don't care for the sugar in it.  next time, I'll omit that and see if I like it better.

This was one of the first recipes I made from allrecipies.com and I am still making it regularly. It's so easy and SO very delicious.  I love the way the hint of spiciness adds to this classic dish.

Based on other reviews, I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar, added celery & garlic, sauteed the onion, celery, garlic with ham.  I also precooked the beans.  I had some organic beef broth leftover so used that in addition to some water.  It was a good and different soup; I usually make split pea from leftover ham.

This was a great recipe! I used the beans I had on hand ( which were pinto, garbanzo, and white beans) from cans. Still turned out great!! The cayenne really does wonders. Defintintly will make again.

I have made this about four times now. It is fabulous. I was wanting to use up leftover ham, and so boiled the bone with the remaining meat, then used the broth for the base/water instead of just water. I took heed of the suggestions of reducing the brown sugar and used about half of what the recipe does.  A big hit. Thank you for sharing this family favorite.

We've made this several times, and it always turns out great.  But we do NOT add cayenne pepper, we just don’t find it necessary in a ham and beans recipe.  So I took 1 star off for that.

If you forget to soak the beans overnight, you can put them in 8 cups of water and boil, turn off heat and let sit for an hour.  Or easier still, just don't soak or preheat the beans, and throw them in dry after rinsing. This increases the cooking time.   You may have to watch the water level more and add water, if you use dry beans.  Start with about 10 cups of water.  You’ll need another hour or so with dry beans.

Cut the brown sugar in half, if you want it less sweet.  Add more or less ham as you like, as well.  We just use whatever ham is around, but the 1/2lb amount in the recipe is pretty much ideal.

I do sometimes add about 1/4 tsp of baking soda during the last hour or so.  It seems to make the ham and beans creamier, if you like that go for it.  If you don’t, don’t add it.  Someone said it helps with gas, but all I noticed is that it seems to cream/thicken up the mixture somehow.

This has a simple list of ingredients, but it’s so tasty!  Goes great with corn bread.  

Thank you for the recipe!

I had been looking for this and sounded just like what my mother used to make. I did add smoked ham hocks and a little ham broth to it and while cooking it smelled and looked just like what i wanted, but after tasting it I found it to be WAY to sweet ! Next time I cut out the sugar all together and it was great.Also cut back on pepper.

after reading several reviews commenting on the sweetness, I omitted the brown sugar completely and was very pleased with the results..  This was a real hit with my husband particularly.  Served it with skillet cornbread for a complete meal.

Disappointed! Way too much sugar. Even a little sugar would be too much for me. I would leave it out. Despite that, the beans soaked up all the flavor of the ham leaving both flavorless.

Read other reviews and also decided to cut down on brown sugar.  1/4 cup was still slightly sweet.  Added about 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt and 2 garlic cloves.  Also, added a big handful of kale from my garden.  I chopped it up so it looked like parsley, so no one knew they were eating kale! Served this with cornbread…all crumbled up in it.  Yum!

good base recipe, but I couldn't resist making some changes. as all reviews said, cut back on the brown sugar. but i used canned cannellini beans, rinsed and drained. added asparagus tips and half a poblano pepper chopped, about 15 minutes before it was done cooking, and spinach about 10 minutes later. came out good. i cooked uncovered until almost all of the water was absorbed/evaporated, then i began adding the veggies. came out nice. i basically used what i had on hand, and it was a nice meal out of leftovers.

I have made this recipe several times for family and friends. They seem to love it and ask me to make it again.  As I do all recipes I make my own little twist to them.  This one I do cook in the crock pot!  It tends to be a little creamier!  The recipe calls for just 1/2lb of cooked ham I use about 1lb. along with a bone or ham hock, I also use 1 1/2 lb. beans!  I am fixing this morning along with some sweet cornbread!

Husband loved these. Took advice of others & reduced sugar mainly b/c the ham/ham bone I threw in there were cooked as a honey ham. I put too much water in & tried to reduce, still ended up being a little more runny than I was hoping for, but that was my fault. Awesome recipe will make again!

I was looking for a recipe for Northern beans and found this.  As someone who didn't grow up eating ham and beans I was apprehensive but I've made this recipe three times now and it's very good!  We love the subtle sweet flavor with just a hint of heat from the cayenne.  I followed the recipe and served it with corn bread. Yummy!

This is pretty much the same recipe my mom, Grandma and myself have been usinh for years minus the brown sugar and cayenne .....we had a ham hok in while the beans are cooking and add the chunks off ham toward the end oc the cooking process so the flavor doesn't cook out of the ham

I suggest you add the brown sugar a tablespoon at a time to make sure it's not too sweet or overpowering for your taste. Two tablespoons were plenty for our taste. I like a few vegetables in mine so I did add some diced carrots and celery, Thanks for the great recipe!

The flavor was really good but I cooked the beans and ham on low in the slow cooker for 8 hours after soaking overnight and they're still hard and crunchy.   Not crazy about the texture. I may try again but follow the true directions.

This is the BEST!!!!! YUM! I never really liked ham and beans because it was so bland. This is not the case with this recipe. I only change two things. I use a 1/4 cup brown sugar and I throw in about 3-4 pieces of raw bacon during step two. just adds a little more flavor. I also let mine simmer anywhere from 2-5 hours.

I do not love ham, but I made this tonight for the family with Christmas leftovers.  It was really good.  My hubby who loves ham and beans gave it two thumbs up.  My 11 year old daughter, our pickiest eater, liked it and that is saying something!  I cut sugar in 1/2, did 1/8th cayenne and had about 3X the ham.

I just wasn't that impressed.  I cut the sugar by half like others suggested, but I just didn't care for the flavor (or lack thereof).  We ate it for supper but then ended up throwing most of the leftovers away since it was so bland.

We ate lots of ham and beans when I was a child and so I've avoided it for several decades.  My fiance mentioned he liked this dish, so I set out to find a recipe.  I must admit it tasted great.  The hint of sweetness makes a massive difference.  I'll be making (and eating) this again.  :)

I did the overnight soak and I cut back a bit on the brown sugar as my ham was leftover and had a glaze on it and I was afraid it would be too sweet. My hubs really enjoyed this and he isn't a ham & beans fan. I felt it was lacking something but couldn't quite figure out what it was missing. I will make again and probably add some celery and will double the ham! Thanks

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband raved over it. He said he would eat it for dinner once a week! I used 3 cans of Great Northern instead of the dry beans and only 1/4 c brown sugar. I simmered for an hour and served with cornbread. It's a keeper!

These beans are just delicious!!  I made them with leftover Easter ham.  I was very happy to have read the recommendations regarding the brown sugar-I only added 2 tablespoons and this was plenty!  I also added a big squirt of ketchup for acid to help soften the beans.  Didn't add the cayenne and parsley either.  These were so yummy!!

I give it 4 1/2 stars.  Hubby said it tasted like his grandma's.  I did make a couple of adjustments though.  I used 2 tablespoons brown sugar and instead of cayenne pepper I added about dried pepper flakes (1/2 tsp).  Overall very good and will make again!

I've grown up on ham and beans. The kind you make with the leftover baked ham. I was making a batch the other night and wondered if "all recipes" had a tasty alternative instead of what I was use too. I saw this one and thought the sugar was odd but was curious anyway. I was disappointed....the sugar was crazy weird tasting in the beans. Not my thing. Although, I did like the spice and think I'll keep doing that.

Good flavor. Everyone liked them. I used chili powder instead of cayenne since I was out and used half the brown sugar. It was nice. I will make with cayenne next time to make sure there is a little kick to it.

So yummy. I put it in the crock pot.I added a ham hock it so I increased the water. I put the water about an inch above the ham hock. I had too much liquid but drained some of it. Turned out great. It took about 10 hours to cook.

Slightly sweet, yummy!  This is how I modified the recipe for a pressure cooker: 1st do the initial soak on the beans.  2nd, Later in the day when the beans had been soaking for a couple of hours I cooked them in my pressure cooker following the pressure cooker cookbook, using the maximum time reccomended.  After the beans were cooked I drained them and added the rest of the ingredients, cutting back on the amount of water reccomended.  Then I heated it all up and simmered for 15 minutes or so.  Turned out great, the beans were very mushy like we like.  Next time I may try adding all the ingrediants in with the beans as they cook.

I'm only giving this three stars because I didn't like it.  It was so bland, I had to "doctor" it up a bit... and it still wasn't as good as everyone on this site claimed it to be.  My husband however liked it and ate most of it.

This was a good way to use up leftover ham. I'm not a bean fan, but I'm trying to learn. I made them in the crockpot with the ham bone from New Year's. I could eat them, lol, so I consider them a success.

Very good recipe.  I also cooked it in the slow cooker using some chicken broth as well as a good old ham hock.  I cut the brown sugar down a bit as well, but even at half the amount it added a great flavor.  I will for sure be using this one again!

My husband had been craving this and I had never made it before. I don't know what I was afraid of. It was very easy and tasty. Just what my husband wanted. I did let this simmer for like 3 hours. I used ham from the deli and tobasco sauce since I was out of cayenne pepper. Very good. I will make this again.

Good recipe, loved the taste and how easy it was.  The only problem I had was it wasn't quite thick enough for me.  I'll try adding a little flour next time to see if that helps.
