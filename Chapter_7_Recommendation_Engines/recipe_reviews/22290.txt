I have been looking for a good peppermint punch for years. My mother has a very good recipe, but it is very time consuming and calls for a lot of ingredients. This punch took very little time to make, with few ingredients and tastes just as good as mom's old recipe.

It was good...I added twice the amount of icecream like another poster mentioned and I think that was too much.  It was a little too thick, like a milkshake more than a punch.  Everyone at the party seemed to like it.

I increased the recipe and made enough for 144 servings for the children's Christmas program at Church.  There wasn't a drop left.  Everyone loved it.  And I loved how easy it was to make.  Great punch!

This was a different punch.  I couldn't find peppermint ice cream, so had to settle for peppermint bon-bon ice cream.  Wasn't as sweet as I had expected.  Needed something, but couldn't figure out what. I'll have to try it again, I think.

This punch was a wonderul surprise!  I was nervous about making it for my Christmas Party, but it turned out to be the biggest hit of the night.  You can't find peppermint ice cream just anywhere, but it's not that hard to find and worth it!!  I have made it twice since then and given out the recipe to a ton of people.

Made this punch for Christmas Eve party.  Had "flamingo-themed" decorations, so the color was perfect.  Tasted delicious, but didn't look nice -- sort of "cottage-cheesy" on the top -- I think it was the butterfat.  Frequent stirring didn't help much -- Used Edie's Grand brand ice-cream (only one I could find) but high fat content.  Has anyone seen a low-fat peppermint ice-cream?  Not usually a substitution I make for parties, but it might help the texture.  Any other suggestions?  HELP, I have another party on Monday ;-)

I liked the flavor of this recipe alot.  My punch seemed to get a little stiff on the top---perhaps I needed more/less milk?  Or maybe it just needed to be stirred more often.  That would be my only complaint--the punch itself, even with the stiff top, tasted delicious.

Not quite a five-star recipe, but this was pretty and festive. Not overly minty, nice and creamy. It is a nice change from usual fruit punches, however.

I made this at Christmas for work and family gatherings.  Everyone absolutely loved it!  Make sure to buy extra  of everything because you will have to fill up the punch bowl over and over again!

I loved this punch.  I served it at a holiday party and everyone raved about it.  I added more ice cream than the recipe called for so it would be a little more creamy.  I will definately use this recipe again!

Unique, great tasting and easy to make recipe!  Made this punch for X-mas eve brunch, and it was great.  I mixed the ice cream and milk together first and then added the ginger ale slowly.  I used Edy's "Slow Churned, Thick & Creamy" light Peppermint ice cream, so it probably has less fat than the ice cream that some of the other reviewers used.  It does create a frothy foam on top after you stir it, but if you stir it every so often it easily mixes in again.  For anyone who is serving this at a party and doesn't want to stand there and keep stirring the punch, I would recommend a glass beverage dispenser.  The foam then stays on the top, and your guests will get all of the non-foamy punch from the bottom.

My family has always had a punch like this, but with eggnog instead of the milk, I also prefer an unsweetened tonic water for the carbonation instead of ginger ale as it is a little too sweet.

When I read the reviews, I thought this was going to be looking like cottage cheese and I would have to stir it all night. But I didn't. I used Edy's 1/2 the fat peppermint ice cream, milk and ginger ale. It was tasty. Everyone liked it and I had no leftovers. It looked creamy and fluffy - just like snow. Perfect punch for our Christmas party. Yum! Thank you for the great recipe.

This was pretty good, but overly sweet for most of our party goers tastes.  It did turn out a pretty pink color though, and went well with the decorations and christmas cookies we had out.

Made this punch for Xmas Eve dinner.  My Mom loves peppermint ice cream and looks forward to it coming out every season.  Found this recipe and made it as a surprise for her.  It is BEAUTIFUL!  Everyone loved it.  What's nice about it is that it's not too sweet.  Has a little bite from the peppermint.  Some may want to add a little sugar for a sweeter punch.  Next year I'll use candy canes for garnish.

Overall I liked this recipe.  I  made it as is, however I did think the ginger ale left a bit of an afer taste.  I intend to make it again using a different soda, maybe sprite or seven up, however I'm not a big fan of ginger ale so that could be why I noticed the after taste.

Thisi punch was yummy but it needed something for me. The second time I made it I deleted the milk and added a small jar of strawberry jam. I melted it on the stovetop with a cup or so of the soda to thin it down a bit.  I refrigerated it till it cooled and then added it to the punch bowl with all of the soda and then added the ice cream. It made it sweeter and just a bit more flavor.

Awesome! This was a great recipe. I was afraid to try because my husband and kids do not like peppermint too much but it was so good even they liked it. We replace the eggnog tradition with this peppermint punch while putting up the christmas tree. I added crushed candy cane on top and the kids loved fishing it out of the punch. Thanks, we really enjoyed it.

This is so pretty for the holidays.  I tried it and we loved it.  Only difference is you need more ice cream otherwise I felt it was too watery and not much of a peppermint taste.  Very yummy - even poured alittle heavy whipping cream in it.  It's perfect for a party!

For people who love mint chocolate chip ice cream (I am one) this is the BEST! I couldn't find peppermint IC so I used the mint chip. It took me longer to wash the punch bowl than to make the punch! Yummy.

I got good reviews on this punch.  I made a lot for a big crowd in a large water cooler, which I wouldn't recommend. You don't get the creaminess with the initial servings because you're drawing just the giner ale off the bottom and out the spout. It would've been worth the extra work of mixing more batches to have it in a punch bowl.  Very tasty and different.

I made this for our housewarming and Christmas family get-together and both times this was a huge hit.

Delicious! I served this in a round fish bowl, upon which I painted a snowman’s head. It was a big hit!

SOMETHING DIFFERENT!! Served it at a party after a rehearsal. Nobody said they liked it!  I thought it was pretty, but the milkiness didn't go over well.  People seem to prefer nice red punches? Might try this with the family before I scrap the idea.

It's good but after you add the ice cream, it just sits in top and gets all foamy

I made this for a Christmas Eve party with my family and everyone loved it, my mother took an extra pitcher with her to work after the party and brought home an EMPTY pitcher.  I am so glad I came across this recipe!

Just made this for a holiday party, everyone enjoyed it! Was very good with a splash of peppermint schnapps added to your glass if you prefer having a little alcohol in your drink!

Sorry this wasn't a big hit at our christmas party. I used the best quality ingredients-- Homemade brand peppermint stick ice cream with Canada Dry and whole milk--this just tasted like the medicine. Love the ice cream--not the punch.

This punch was "ok". I made this for my daughters 2nd grade Christmas party. Some children (and adults) liked it, some didn't. It was about 50/50. I did add more ice cream and that seemed to help.
