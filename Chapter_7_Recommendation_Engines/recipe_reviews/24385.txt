This was super YUMMY!! My whole family loved it. The small market in our town didn't have blue cheese so I made it without the cheese and it was still wonderful. I am looking forward to adding the blue cheese next time.  Thanks Jim

I am a huge fan of French dressing. I won't eat salad unless I can find a good recipe for dressing. My husband even liked this.  Great because you only need a little dressing to get the flavor throughout the whole salad. Will definitely keep this stocked in my fridge!

WOW! Super flavor! I omitted the blue cheese because I didn't have any on hand, and used dried minced onions (followed conversion on side of jar) to save time. I added 1t Worcestershire sauce. EXCELLENT! I will try adding the blue cheese next time. 9 servings makes 3 cups, so plan to have a LARGE jar, or scale down. Great recipe! Thanks to your Grandmother! 5++++

A+++! I'm from the eastern MN/western WI area and LOVED a particular brand of French dressing that began with an "H" and was a French man's name (not sure if I can actually share it here), which is very hard-to-find and anything close to it is non-existent here in the Mesa, AZ area.  This tastes almost EXACTLY like it!  I love that I can tweak it so it's healthier - without all the added preservatives and sugar fillers.  As per previous suggestions, I substituted Splenda for sugar (I used 2/3 c. Splenda), used a 6 oz. can of tomato paste instead of the ketchup, and omitted the blue cheese to save on cal's and my glycemic index.  YUM!  If you love traditional French dressing somewhere in taste between Catalina, California, and Western, THIS IS A MUST-TRY.  Bonus: SO EASY TO PREPARE!  Thanks for sharing, JIMBOWERS.  It's definitely a permanent add-in to my recipe box, and I'm sharing with all my friends and family too =D

Absolutley Wonderful!  I was looking for an old classic from a Restaurant my husband and I used to visit and low and behold this was it!!  I didn't add the onions (bc I didn't have them in the house) and I added 1/2 a tsp of Worcestershire.  I searched for more recipes by this submitter but didn't find any - PLEASE POST MORE!!!!

I opted to omit the blue cheese, but this recipe was OUTSTANDING.  It was easy to make and absolutely delicious.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves French Dressing.  Put some more of your Grandmother's recipes on the site, Jim!  :)

Your grandmother rocks!!  I too omitted the Blue Cheese and used Splenda instead of sugar to try and cut some calories, but this is by far the best recipe for French dressing I have ever made (and I've tried quite a few).  Thanks so much for sharing.

I scaled it down for a smaller batch. Used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil and a little honey in place of the sugar. Saved the blue cheese for folks to add to their own salads and I have a blue cheese hater. Still tasted great after a week in the fridge. I'm sure it would last longer, especially without the blue cheese.

Tasty!  It's nice to be able to enjoy a creamy dressing that isn't high in fat.  I don't use sugar in order to lower the calories.  In its place I use a little bit of honey and the rest of the sweetness comes from stevia.  It's probably not as thick as the original recipe, but the taste is still great.

Outstanding! I made it just as the recipe was written. The only thing I did'nt add was the blue cheese, only because I did'nt have any. Its by far and a way the best french dressing I have ever had. And I love french dressing. Thank you!

i know in theory I'm not supposed to rate recipes a 5 if I made changes but I can't help it.  I'm a reviewer reader and I appreciate reading input from everyone else and I probably wouldn't give a recipe a second look if it was a 3 star versus a 4 1/2.  With that being said. ..... I love this recipe how I made it with other awesome cooks' help.  I did not have any blue cheese or you can bet your booty it would be in my salad dressing and it will be next time.  I added 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire and cut the sugar to 2/3 of a cup, next time I will bring the sugar down to 1/2 a cup.  I have never liked french dressing but this is amazingly good!  I'm lazy so i threw my onion and garlic in a blender and chopped it up then the rest of the ingredients, except the oil and mixed until it was all liquid.  Then i slowly poured in the oil.  Very good stuff.  Yielded just over 3 cups of dressing.

great starting point.  I omitted the bleu cheese because I did not have any.  I also used white wine vinegar.  I found this a bit too sweet...and needing heat. (heh.)  I combined all + 1 jalepeno pepper and blended to perfection.  Like most dressings, even better on day 2 when I enjoyed it as a sandwich spread.  Next time, I will replace the sugar with honey.

I didn't have blue cheese so I omitted it, and it was still delicious. I only added a little more than 1/3 cup sugar though. I took the advice of the other reviews and added it last so I could test how much I wanted. I also put it in my blender after added the onion and garlic.

DELICIOUS! This recipe makes a lot!  The only change I make is I use 1/2 cup of Splenda instead of the sugar.

Yummy!!  Dinner was just about done when I realized we didn't have any salad dressing...I found this recipe and tried it because I had all the ingredients.  The only thing I didn't have was time...time to  deal with the onion and garlic. I had some garlic powder and onion powder in the spice rack.  I had no idea how much to use to make it equivalent, so I just added one teaspoon of each, since thats the amount used for the salt and paprika. Don't know if it's right or not, but hey it worked, cause it tastes wonderful!! Thanks Jim, now I've got the best french dressing in an old salsa jar...lol

As others suggested, I used Splenda (TM) sugar substitute, with just a smidge less than the recipe calls for.  I also used Asian garlic infused rice vinegar.  Perfect!  I'll never buy French dressing again.  This was so simple to whip up in the food processor!  Thanks for the recipe!

Good stuff.  Scaled the recipe down to 1 serving's worth, as I only needed a little bit for another recipe, so used 1/8t onion and garlic powders.  Also used honey instead of sugar and apple cider vinegar instead of white.  Left out the blue cheese, since we didn't have any.

We love this recipe.  I have altered it a little for my husband who can't eat dairy or soy and he loves it!  I substituted the sugar for approximately 4 Tbsp. honey and leave out the blue cheese.  I cut back the onion a quite a bit too.  I put everything into the food processor which really mixes it up great.

Outstanding French Dressing.  My family loved this dressing on 'Taco Pasta Salad' from AR.  In fact, I've made this 3 times now.  It last in the fridge for quite a while.  My guys think they don't like bleu cheese, I just don't tell them what I put in the dressing.  I love making my own salad dressing, so that I know what goes it them and this recipe is definitely worth repeating.

Way too much vinegar. Kept adding sugar until I used about a cup full.  Had to keep adding ketchup, then added mayonnaise, then half a bottle of Western Dressing before I could use it.

This stuff is SO good! I needed it for a taco salad. It came together so quickly...almost so quickly that I felt like I was doing something wrong! I didn't use blue cheese. I also had to use onion powder and garlic powder. It still turned out great! I probably ate way too much of it. =) Delicious! And a plus, the finished dressing stores perfectly in a 32 ounce ketchup bottle (after being shaken together in a bigger glass jar), so it's easy to squirt out! Will definitely make this again when the need arises!

Best French dressing ever!  I throw all my ingredients in a blender and hit liquefy.   I do leave out the blue cheese though.  No more store bought french for us.

This recipe reminds me of homemade french dressing from Berry's Restaurant in Brevard, NC.  It is spicy and sweet and the texture is smooth and is so much better than any store bought french dressing.  I highly recommend this recipe.

If you don't like Blue Cheese, you won't like it. Otherwise, it was good.  I thought I'd give it a try because I love French Dressing but the Blue Cheese ruined it for me.

This is hands down the best french dressing I have tasted.  I love the blue cheese, I used to add crumbled blue cheese to my bottled french dressing, but this is so much better!  I will never use bottled again!

I cut the recipe in half and added 1 clove garlic i/4 cup lemon juice, salt and pepper and used olive oil for the oil. It came out one of the best dressings I've ever made. I will make it again.

French dressing is one of my favorites. I made this exactly except for a full cup of sugar I added half with stevia sweetener. It is a sweet dressing but overall very interesting. You can't skip the blue cheese in this dressing.

Loved this!  I cut the sugar in half because I am trying to cut down on our sugar.  Also just used a pinch of salt because I need to cut my salt intake...the ketchup has both of these.  Didn't use blue cheese because I didn't have any....but even with those modifications this dressing was yummy!!

It is good. 

I left out the blue cheese, because of allergies.  It was delicious without it, but don't give a recipe 5 stars, unless you made it as is.

I liked it as a start for a yummy red/french dressing... but I made changes.... We will probably use half an onion next time, less sugar, add honey, and we used no blue cheese as DH doesn't care for it and our little probably wouldn't like it either.  This recipe is a great jumping-off point to make to your own family's tastes.  Thank you!!

I cut this recipe in half and added a bit of soy sauce instead of salt. I didn't have any lemon juice, but I will definitely try that next time. Very good, although also very strong . Use with caution

I just made this and it is so good. The juice of 3 medium lemons equals 1/2 cup. I used a metal grater and grated the onion and garlic. I didn't add the blue cheese. It's a perfect French dressing.

Delicious! I have made this several times, always a hit! It will stay for a while in the fridge in a sealed container. I've never added the bleu cheese however. In my opinion it doesn't need it.

Fantastic French dressing!  This tastes amazing, and is super easy to make.  Add the sugar last, so you can adjust based on your tastes.  I used about 1/2 the called for amount.  As previous reviewers state, this recipe makes a large portion.  We scaled it down to 3 servings, and it was perfect for a dinner party of 6.  Also added a few dashes of Wostershire sauce, and left out blue cheese.  Delicious!

Love this dressing.  I did find the garlic a little strong but I am going to let the garlic sit in the lemon juice for a few hours before mixing in the rest of the ingredients next time. Hopefully that helps.

Oh man! I never even liked French Dressing before this version! I made this for my boyfriend who is in LOVE with the dressing I made. I used powdered garlic and onion, used simple syrup (you can search AllRecipes for how to make that), omitted the blue cheese and the lemon - and you would be surprised how fantastic it tastes. We are never purchasing French dressing from the store AGAIN!

I also used homemade ketchup in this recipe, and it made all the difference!

Followed the recipe except for the Blue Cheese and added a few dashes of Worcestershire Sauce instead.  It was awesome.  Thanks so much for sharing :)

Wonderfully rich and tasty.  Oh did I mention easy to make.  I omitted the Blue cheese this time and had it over a fresh vegi salad, it was delightful.

My hubby loved this dressing.  After a few days, it seemed that the sugar in it made the dressing a little too sweet.  Next time I will use a little less sugar.  Thank you for this recipe!

This is really an outstanding dressing. You can subsitute red for white vinegar and the taste still works.

YUM!  This dressing is awesome.  I didn't have any blue cheese so I didn't put any in and it still tasted great!

I LOVED the blue cheese in this, but found the dressing too sweet.  Will make it again and adjust the sugar accordingly

My family loves this salad dressing - with or without the blue cheese.  It is reminiscent of Kraft's Catalina Dressing - who ever would have thought you could make it at home.
