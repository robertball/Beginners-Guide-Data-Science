This recipe is wonderful.  My son has a hickory grilled steak house restaurant and when I tried this recipe (with his restaurant in mind) I was so impressed that I took the finished product to the restaurant for a taste test.  He and all the servers and cooks tried it and loved it.  They plan to put it on the menu.  The time consuming part is measuring all the ingredients for the sauce but it is worth it!!

Love this site and love, love, love the recipe conversion program on each recipe that allows me to change the number of servings.

Thanks so much!

I admit it makes no sense at all, but it was mostly nostalgia that drew me to this recipe. Coming from the Iron Range of Northern Minnesota myself, it somehow felt like "home." But it takes more than sentimentality to make a great recipe and this one missed the mark for us.  With all the ingredients involved I anticipated something indescribably fantastic, but in the end it was just predominantly sweet and all but masked the rich, beefy flavor you'd want and expect - edible, but not a repeat.

This makes a lot of beef barbeque. Mom never made it, but up North we used to have it every now and then for school lunch. I live in the South now, where pork barbeque is king and chicken barbeque comes in second and beef barbeque is rare. But I had a chuck roast I wanted to do something different with so I thought I’d cook some up. Southern hubby gobbled it up. It was great as sandwiches on hamburger rolls. I made this just as written (including open crock sauce thickening and dipping the bun tops) except left out the celery since I had none. I did add 1 tsp. celery seed for a touch of the celery flavor though. I used a good Sweet Baby Ray’s BBQ sauce. I only had a 3 ½ lb. roast, but even so, the recipe makes a lot of sauce even if it had been the 4 lb. one specified. Tasty and hearty beef barbeque, all around. Not too sweet, not too spicy. I thought, just about right for the beef. I might tweak it with a little liquid smoke next time. Not hard to make at all. Don’t let the long list of ingredients intimidate you.  All are pretty common things you probably have on hand. It really only took me a few minutes to measure out all the stuff in the sauce and you only have to chunk / chop up one onion. I served this with my favorite “Taste of Home’s Creamy Coleslaw” (from this site) that I whipped up in no time. This is a good meal for a day when the family is on the run. Leave the slow cooker on warm, set the package of hamburger buns out on the counter, and let everyone serve them

Exactly what I was looking for.  We loved this recipe.  I also used 1 cup of beef broth instead of beer.   I noticed about 2 hours before it was done that the sauce was thin so I took the lid off of the crock pot for the last 2 hours to thicken it up.   Just keep your eye on it.  I think if I didn't notice until the last 30 minutes that the sauce was too thin, I wouldn't have had enough time to thicken it up before I served it. This recipe is so flavorful, we are still loving the leftovers!  Thanks!

Although there are a lot of ingredients to this recipe and it takes a little extra time getting them all together, the flavor is amazing! You will not be disappointed.

Mmm -- we liked this a lot.  Never having had the original, we can't speak to whether it is or isn't, but as written (with one tiny addition) it was great Super Bowl food.  And made a ton of leftovers!  The one tiny addition: while the meat is out of the cooker for shredding, defat and run the immersion blender through the liquid.  I chose to do it this way because while I like the flavor of the celery, I don't like actually eating the celery.  I learned that trick a long time ago.  Hides the veggies so I don't notice that they're there!  It also hides the cooked onions from the kid who won't eat those.  Our BBQ sauce choice:  Sweet Baby Ray's.  We will definitely be having this one again.

Best barbeque ever, in my book! The only thing I changed was using steak sauce instead of Worchestershire, just because it's what I had. I let it cook all day on low in the crock, then put it on the stovetop for about 45 min on medium-low to thicken the sauce. "Dipping" the buns is a great tip, too. Would make a great 'stuffed' baked potato, IF there were any leftovers! Sending this recipe to my whole family, thanks so much for sharing!!

We have this every year for my son's birthday party.  Feeds lots of people, and everyone loves it!  One hint - the longer you can cook the meat, the easier it is to shred.  I start it the night before to make sure it is REALLY done.

I followed the recipe exactly until I tasted the sauce and it seemed a little sweet. So I added 1 extra tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, and it came out fantastic! I took some to work the next day and let a few people sample it, and they all wanted the recipe!

YUMMY!!! I seasoned and seared the meat in a hot pan with a few splashes of olive oil before placing it in the crockpot. I then followed the recipe pretty much exactly; the only change I made was to double up on the chili powder and add a little bit of tabasco sauce. Also, when the meat was done, I removed it to shred it and poured the sauce into a stove top pan. Brought it to a rolling boil and used a couple of Tbsp. of cornstarch to thicken it some. Then I put the shredded beef back in the crockpot and added the sauce to it. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! This would work equally as good with pork or chicken too!

Fantastic! I discovered too late that I was out of ketchup, so I just used the better part of a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce. Roast got amazingly tender in the crock pot, and made terrific sandwiches - plus plenty of leftover beef that we froze for another meal. We'll definitely be making this again - maybe with pork roast next time. Thanks!

I have made this as written and it is great however the second time I made it, I made a few changes which improved the flavor for our family. I doubled the chili powder, and doubled the cider vinegar and added several shakes of tabasco sauce. We prefer the tang and heat rather than a sweet bbq. I made it with a pork butt roast before and it was incredible too.   This recipe works well in a crock pot but today I didn't have the time needed so I slow cooked it in a french crock with a lid for approximately 4.5 hours at 250 degrees in the oven.

I really didn't care much for the sauce when I first tasted it. I added more chili powder, garlic, and brown sugar to the crock pot. It was better after that, but still didn't wow me. I used boneless beef chuck ribs and just let them slow cook on low with the sauce overnight. Won't make this sauce again, but the meat was really easy to shred.

Made this for my husband & 2 young kids.  They all LOVED it.  It was flavorful, but not spicy.  If you are looking for a lot of kick - - this is NOT it, but it's great for young kids & sensitive stomachs!

With the exception of adding in onion powder and more chili powder, I made this as written and it was a tremendous hit with the family. As others suggested, I removed the meat and thickened the sauce with corn starch. Delicious and thank you!!

Sauce was a bit weird, family didn't like so much...I'm only giving 3 stars since I think I cooked it too quickly due to lack of time and meat wasn't tender.

After reading all the reviews, I HAD to try this. With the suggestion of some, I doubled the chili powder, left out the celery (didn't have any). I didn't have time for the slow cooker, so I took another reviewer's advice and put it in the oven covered at 250 for 4 hours.  It fell apart easily, I'm cooking off the liquid now on the stove, and sneaked a taste -- WOW, it just melted in my mouth and the FLAVOR is DELISH!  Into my rotation this goes!

I grew up in this area of N. Mn., ate these sandwiches all of the time.  They're fabulous, bring back many fond memories.  They were made of either pork, beef or ham.  It's hard to say which was my favorite.  Thank you for sharing the recipe. sharon6464

Did a test run with friends. They loved it and  now to make a batch for the church luncheon of 150, yikes! Definitely need to boil sauce down and thicken with a teaspoon or so of cornstarch after removing meat. More spice? more chili powder.

Thank you for the delicious recipe!  I used 10 pounds of rump roast and because I was using it as the main Entre' at a camping potluck, I chose to do the following at home: cook the meat in the crock pot in beef broth, salt & pepper (due to amount of meat I did two rounds of meat preparation); chopped the onions and celery; mixed all spices & liquids and placed in a leak proof containter, excluding the ketchup & BBQ sauce.  At the campground about 4 1/2 hours prior to dinner time, I added the ketchup and BBQ sauce to the other ingredients and combined it with the meat.  Cooked on high to heat and then turned to low, stirring often to blend. As other Reviewers indicated, if too much liquid remains, remove cover 30 minutes before serving. I also used beef broth instead of beer.  The Ting-Town BBQ Sandwiches were enjoyed by 33 adults and 10 children.  There was only enough BBQ left for six sandwiches.

This was meh. I expected so much more from the sheer number of ingredients, but it tasted like most other recipes I've made using less ingredients. The addition of beer was a nice touch, but turned out too barbecuey for me, not sweet enough.

I have not tried this recipe yet, but logged on to find a beef barbeque recipe and lo and behold Ting Town popped up. I couldn't believe my eyes. I grew up in Hibbing Ting-Town was always the first stop on the way to Bimbos and McCarthy's Beach! I can't wait to try this recipe! Its gotta be the best!

Pretty good....not spicy or tangy enough though. I think it needed more of a bbq taste to it..?

This was flavorful and soft. I used a brisket and served it sliced. My only complaint was that the vinegar taste was rather pronounced. I think I'd leave out the vinegar next time.

I made this today for my extended family and they all loved it - even the kids although I didn't have beer so used beef broth instead.  I'll be emailing this recipe to my sister-in-law when I'm done.  Not as much kick as I'd expected, but easy and tasty.

This is great! I rubbed it with cajun seasoning and browned it to spice it up first. I also added a teaspoon of colemans dry mustard and few pepper flakes to the sauce. I also used KC masterpiece and did not need any extra on my sandwich. I never need to try another bbq beef recipe.

This recipe was excellent. If you follow it exactly it thickens up perfectly. The only changes I made was : I rubbed my roast with cajun seasoning and seared it in vegetable oil before putting it in the slow cooker, and I added 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce. I used Sweet Baby Ray's for my bbq sauce. These sandwiches had just the right kick and were the best I've had .I will be using this recipe again . Thanks!

The sauce was delicious!  I smoked a brisket first, then poured the sauce over it and finished it in the oven at 300 for a couple of hours.  It just melted in your mouth, the family LOVED it!  Thanks, it will be a favorite!

Sure the meat fell apart but the sauce was nothing. I had a crockpot fullof "boiled beef". I will keep looking for a more flavorful recipe.
