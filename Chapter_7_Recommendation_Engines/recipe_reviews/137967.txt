This was the most delicious oxtail stew ever. I changed the recipe a little by eliminating the cornstarch and adding some tiny pasta like pastina when I added the kidney beans. This thickened the stew and made for a complete 1 pan dish!!!
Thanks Gail!!!

My Gran used to make oxtail stew and it was a real comfort food! Nothing has changed here except this recipe is even better! I didn't change a thing - it was so easy! The servings were generous and it fed two huge teenage boys and my husband and myself - served with mashed potatoes and beans over which the gravy went. It is very filling and satisfying. I cooked it in the crockpot instead of the dutch oven and it took longer of course but the recipe was easy to adapt. Thank you for a really hearty, yummy winter warmer, this is so easy and definitely worth keeping!

I thought this was very good hearty meal. The modifications I made were:I did not use celery, used 6 cups of water, and added 1/4 cup of barley. I will use this recipe again, especially good on a cold winter day.

Excellent recipe. My husband and nephew both do not like oxtail but this recipe had them getting up for seconds. I skipped a can of Heinz baked baked beans instead of the kidney beans and did not need to use the cornstarch as the gravy was just perfect. I cooked it in the slow cooker for about 5.5 hours on high heat. Next time I think I will cook it for just 4 hours as some of the smaller pieces fell off the bone. The bigger pieces were fine though....Thanks for sharing....I served this with ugali/sadza/nishima (depending on which part of Africa you are familiar with) and braised cabbage for a truly authentic African meal.

The Oxtail Stew was wonderful. It had a very nice taste to it. This was my first time making this dish, which I will make again in the future.

I must admit that I adjusted the recipe quite a bit. Instead of bouillon, I used homemade broth. I made this a one pot wonder by sauteing the oxtails for about 8 minutes in a large stock pot. (mine seems to take the challenge well). Then I added carrots and celery (cause I love veggies) cooked them for a minute or two and then threw in 3 tsp garlic ( it mellows in cooking and I love the flavor). I left out the beans and cornstarch and extra water because with the added veggies, it didn't need thickening. I cooked the whole thing for 2.5 hrs and then served it over rice. My boyfriend, who had initially said "ew, tails" said this one is a keeper. I forgot how flavorful beef tails are. One would think 5 bucks a pound is a lot for  them, but they are packed with flavor.

Very good!  I only made a third of the recipe, used dried kidney beans that I had soaked, and added some carrots and a potato.  Omitted the cornstarch and added some okra to attempt to thicken it.  Made it in the slowcooker after browning the oxtail first.  Turned out really delicious

Amazing and so less complicated than other recipes I tried! The only thing I did differently was that I omitted the celery and I added some potatoes and plantains at the last 30 minutes. Delicious!!

My family and I loved this version of oxtails! The broth was so flavorful that I added some of it to my rice and beans which turned out great. The only changes I made was to add some  whole allspice,  dried thyme (couldn't find the bay leaves)  and  sliced carrots to the cooking liquid. I omitted the cornstarch and made rice and beans to serve with the meat  since my hubby doesn't really like stews/soups. Since we usually eat oxtals jaimaican style this was a nice switch. Thanks!

It's a keeper.  My husband doesn't like celery so I had to omit that but still it was very tasteful.  I love oxtail and I usually make soup out of it but since my husband isn't into soups, I made this stew.  I served it with my famous basmati rice and lentil with cumin seeds and he loved it.

I made this today, following recipe as is, but did not add celery and onions since kids don't like them cooked. Also, I thickened the gravy with minute tapioca since did not have corn starch on hand. It was soo good! Will be making it at least twice a month now, thanks for the recipe!

As I write this review I am sipping slowly on Gail's African Style Oxtail Stew. First let me say that oxtails are abundantly available in this part of NYC and lower Westchester Co. Excellent stew! Excellent! I have shared some with a friend of mine who happens to be African-American. I haven't heard from her yet but I cannot imagine that she would not give it 5 stars! (FYI: I have been using allrecipes since around 2003).

I love oxtails and try every recipe that I come across that sounds interesting. I made this recipe exactly as written and it was the best oxtail I have ever eaten. My wife and daughter won't eat oxtail so I added two boneless pork loin chops half way through cooking the oxtail. I served them over rice with some of the thickened stew and my wife and daughter ate them while I ate the oxtails and every thing was fantastic! Thank you for a great recipe I will definitely make this again.

I love oxtails and was looking for another way to cook them; this recipe was very easy with few ingredients. But because of the few ingredients, it was more like Oxtail Soup instead of Oxtail Stew. I was a bit apprehensive because I don't like tomato-based soups and sauces but this seemed an exception to the rule because it didn't have a "sweet" flavor like some pasta sauces, thank you.   My husband won't eat beans so I shelled 2 cups of raw peanuts & added them with the oxtails; he loved the stew.  While it was cooking, I kept going to taste it -- delicious but something seemed missing. What was missing?  Tonight we're having the leftover oxtails. I added:  2 diced turnips,  1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper,  another half beef bouillon cube, 1/3 cup barley, more raw, shelled peanuts, 1/4 c red wine.  I only rated this 4 stars because something is missing. The flavor is definitely there but some ingredients are absent. After dinner tonight I'll find out and start tweaking but I will definitely make this again. I printed out the recipe and will be giving it to my mom and sister. Thank you for sharing!

This recipe tasted good, and my family ate it.  I didn't use kidney beans or peppercorns.  I'm not a fan of oxtails, so I won't make this again.

I skipped the kidney beans because we didn't have any - but we loved this dish. Next time we make it we'll be sure to include them as I'm sure they add even more to this.

This was really delicious, and I followed the ingredients to the letter. However, the 4 stars is because my pot started burning at the bottom, even though I stirred it well every once in a while, and simmered on low heat (recipe says to simmer on medium low). This was 1 hour EARLIER than the cooking time listed. Either it requires much more liquid or the cooking time is way off.  After burning, there was barely any liquid left. While the bottom of the dish burnt, the oxtails didn't taste burnt at all (I was very happy that the star of the dish was OK!) but the sauce had a hint of burnt taste to it.. So, to prevent further burnt permeation, I transferred the oxtails to a separate serving dish. Ate with rice, and my hubby liked it - even though he isn't partial to oxtails. Will make again, this time I will cook it with less time.

I absolutely LOVED this stew! I replaced the kidney beans for the HEINZ baked beans, these thicken the gravy so there was no need for cornstarch! My husband and 2 year old loved it too. Will be making this again and I recommend this recipe!!
OH BTW... i used a crock pot. I wanted to go take a nap ;)

This is so very tasty. It is a bit time consuming, but so worth it I promise you. I've made it several times my family loves it. This is the only way I'll cook oxtail from now on.

I grew up eating oxtail with my mother's tomatoe soup.  Now I've found a new way to enjoy this comfort dish.  Thanks!

This is really great.  I cook this almost weekly as its a really delicious stew.  I use a slow cooker and as advised in the comments, on low for 4 hours and high for 2 plus I added barley at the final hour. 
Really delicious recipe. Thanks

Wow this was a big hit! This was my first time cooking oxtail, not to mention, I had never tried it before either.
Wow was so good! 
The only thing I did different was add some carrots and an extra can of kidney beans. Doubt it did much to change the flavor, but 1 can didn't seem like very much and carrots because why not? :)
Excellent recipe! Will be making this again!

Absolutely loved the flavor of this recipe, however, I believe I made this as directed even simmering it longer but the oxtail just wouldn't come off bone. I ended up wrapping and baking low and slow for two hours then deboning it by hand and adding it to soup. I also thought it would thicken up a lot more with the cornstarch. I would make this again though knowing what I need to do now because the flavor is just that good.

This is by far one of the best and easiest way I’ve made oxtail. The taste is definitely what catches my attention. Great on you Gail.

Have never eaten anything like this so we weren't sure what to expect. Followed the recipe exactly. The house smelled wonderful by the time hubby got home, he even commented on how good it smelled. This dish was so great!!! Although it was time-intensive it was fairly easy to prepare and it looked so fancy sitting in the serving dish. WIll definitely make this again.

It was a good recipe. The seasoning needs to be tweaked. I would substitute beef broth in place of water in the future. To improve the flavor profile I added more salt, Worcester sauce and Cajun seasoning. I also wanted more veggies so I added a can of corn. Not bad for a first time. I served over white rice and enjoyed the meal.

I made nearly as written.  I used 4 pounds of meat, because the store only had 2 pound packages.  I would recommend using 4 pounds of meat, because meat is good.  The only change I would make is using 2 cans on beans instead of 1.  One can didn't seem to be enough.  Thanks for sharing the recipe with us Americans!

I was nervous about making oxtail for the first time but this recipe was super easy and had most ingredients on hand.  I didn't have kidney beans so I substituted Baked Beans with Onions instead.  Came out good!  Overall, I thought this dish was pretty good and will make it again for sure!

This is a great recipe!! We added carrots and skipped the cornstarch and it was lovely. We also did this in the pressure cooker to save some time. Next time we plan to tweak the recipe a bit and add some heat and a few other spices just to play with it, but it was delicious as written.

This is such a wonderful stew recipe! I substituted pig tails (much more easily available in my part of the US than oxtails), doubled the amount of celery,  and cooked the stew in a crockpot instead of a Dutch oven. Just, WOW! Will definitely make this recipe again!

Love this recipe so very much. I only used 6 cups of water, added 2 cups dry red wine, carrots, mushrooms. My husband hasn't stopped asking for this, one of our favorites!
