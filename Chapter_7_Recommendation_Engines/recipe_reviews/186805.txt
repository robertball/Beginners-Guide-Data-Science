This works good with crecent rolls because you can just fold them into themselves with the tuna or chicken mixture in the center, we call them Tuna or chicken Triangles :-)

These are super fast to make and very filling.  They are great for those nights when you don't know what to make or for a fast supper.  Sometimes I add sliced black olives to the tuna. We always have leftovers and when we reheat them they are really good the second time too!

My grandmother used to make these, but we always used sour cream instead of mayonnaise, and I use Mrs. Dash instead of dill weed.  Excellent substitutions if you want to try them.

Really simple! I used sweet relish in my husband's and he loved them. You can also add boiled eggs. They didnt take hardly anytime to make and they are really great for bagged lunches!

These were quick and easy to make. I wish I could have got more filling inside, but I was weary of tuna explosions. A good basic recipe.

Sooo good and simple for a quick Good Friday meal!  Used lemon pepper instead of dill and turned out great!  Both boys ate multiple pockets.  Definitely a keeper!  Thank you for posting and sharing the recipe!

I made this tonight. If you like tuna melts and biscuits, this is a no brainer. We all liked it. I did add an extra 1T of Mayo and 1T cheese knowing that we like wetter saucier food in general. The cheese was half sharp and half Mozz. I did use the onion/celery in specified amounts and just for color, I put in 1 tsp of shivered/diced red bell. Couple of Tsp of garlic powder. Some ground black pepper. Used Grand bicuits. Served with a newly developed "whatsinthepantry" recipe of 3 cans of Progresso tomato soups - 1 basil, 1 Parmesan & 1 hearty tomato. Good for dipping. *** I will try this again and again. I want to try a flakier, more layered biscuit as well as using crescent roll to form triangle pouch. *** Also plan to use all types of fillings. Thank you for the springboard!

Quite good although it makes me guilty to eat 2 biscuits filled with stuff.  Definitely hearty and added a few shakes of lemon pepper and a squirt of dijon mustard.  Very quick to put together and a great way to use up leftover biscuits.

This was soooo yummy - - and easy! A big hit with me and my hubby.
I didn't make any changes to the recipe (I did add the optional onions but not the celery). It had to bake a little longer than 15 minutes.but that was OK. Enjoy!

These were a hit with our family, including teenage boys and a toddler.  They were easy to make and use ingredients I usually have on hand.

This recipe tasted great...however we froze them in the freezer and they get doughy when thawed out. Yes I know we had a brainless moment. But for real don't freeze them.

The filling was good. I made some tiny changes, sorry! I used a little more onion and celery, and a leftover cooked tuna steak, instead of canned. I didn't care for the biscuit dough. I would make a half-batch of pizza crust instead.

What?!?  A recipe all 4 of my kids enjoyed??  That makes this one a keeper!  I don't like using packaged ingredients so I subbed the biscuit dough for my own pizza dough recipe and it turned out fantastic.  This one is going in my recipe box.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!!

I'm not a fan of fish in general, but I wanted a recipe for tuna. Next time, I'll put in twice the celery and onion, half the dill, and maybe just a little more mayo. I didn't do a very good job of sealing the edges, so I'll do better at that next time. Overall, pretty good. 3.5 stars (It was OK. I almost liked it.)

Very dry and very bland. As well, I wish I had seen the comment about using crescent rolls instead, would've been much easier.

These are great! My hubby soesnt like mayo, so I cut that and added more sharp cheddar. I also used red onion and added garlic powder. I've made this a couple times now and found the wheat canned biscuits add a nice flavor and texture. Even tried these in my NuWave oven and it kept the biscuits soft (just have to flip them midway). Great recipe that has lots of wiggle room with adding ingredients to change it up. Thanks!

This is an excellent idea, but it needs a little something.  Tweak it to make it your own.

These were great, and I'm not a fan of tuna sandwiches.  I the tuna mixture exactly as listed above with the onion and celery, but I did make the biscuits from scratch.  And there were enough left over for my husband to take for lunch at work tomorrow.

These where very good, but think next time will make a little white sauce with thyme, tobacco and lemon to put on them. (just my personal preference)  Must admit they were a lot better the next day.  We made our own biscuits, which made it fun to make.  But is a quick and easy lunch or supper none the less.

Easy to make and baked in about 20min.  If I make them again I think I would add more mayonnaise or more cheese.
