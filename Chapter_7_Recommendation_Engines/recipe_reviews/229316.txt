First I'll say what I did differently..... I used Velveeta (8 oz) as the cheese. I was out of celery seed. Also, I have never liked recipes that say 2 potatoes or 4 carrots. I prefer defined measurements like a half cup or 6 oz or whatever. That being said, this recipe was very good. I went to the farmer's market and bought about 7 large carrots (just over 2 pounds - they were  LARGE carrots) and I think it could have used more. So my only recommendation for this recipe - don't skimp on the carrots, the recipe makes a lot of sauce.Next time I will try at least 3  or maybe 4 pounds of carrots.

I loved this. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, and used carrots and a sweet potato, but the method is great! Definitely a keeper...

This was soooo good and also tasted great as a leftover. It is the perfect fall dish and we might even make this to share for Thanksgiving this year.

I didn't have high hopes for this one but it surprised me and knocked my socks off. Not a huge carrot fan but this one was the bomb! If you like cooked carrots at all, you will love this one!

We really needed a new carrot recipe for Christmas dinner, and this was perfect. Easy to make, and delicious. A big hit.

You can make this ahead and then heat it up in the oven--just don't brown the breadcrumbs until it's time to serve!

Everyone loved it, but the sauce took time and it wasn’t worth the effort on a busy dinner night. I will keep it for different occasions. Also, my family loves carrots so there really isn’t a need to “cheese them up” and go to all the work. Again, though, I won’t throw the recipe out.

We loved this!!  Even my 4 year old happily ate this dish!!  I mostly followed the directions.  I substituted low sodium chicken stock for 1 of the cups of milk,  added a sweet potato in with the carrots, and I didn't make the topping because I didn't have bread crumb, but it turned out great.  Will definitely be making this again!!

My daughters loved this!  I used some frozen rainbow carrot sticks I had on hand and halved he recipe.  The other changes I made was I added mustard (didn't have the powder) and panko bread crumbs for the topping.  I also added a 1/4 of a Knorr homestyle stock gel pack to it.  Other than it turning a purple color due to the purple carrots I had this was wonderful! My 11 yr old tried to claim the whole pan and is taking leftovers to school today.  I can even see adding thyme and some other spices to give this a different twist.  I did end up adding too much flour and it became VERY thick.  Fixed this by adding more water and stirring till it got where I wanted it.  Only one person said it was just OK.  Wouldn't be asking for it again but wouldn't refuse to eat it either.

This was not a winner for my family.  Perhaps I am not skilled enough of a cook to pull it off.  The cheese sauce was gummy and rather tasteless.  I tried the recipe twice thinking I had done something wrong the first time, but came out with the same results.
