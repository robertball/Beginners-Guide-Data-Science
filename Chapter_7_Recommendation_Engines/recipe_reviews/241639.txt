7.6.16 This has nice dipping texture was creamy and cheesy with a little kick and has many layers of flavor. If I'd had any on hand I would have added some chopped fresh jalapeno or chili peppers (canned peppers always seem milder to me) for a bit more heat but that s just a personal preference. Aleisia thanks for sharing your recipe.
