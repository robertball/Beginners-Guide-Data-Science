Folled the recipe exactly with one exception. Reduced the sugar to 3 Tbs and it was still way to sweet for my taste. Not enough true chili taste to suit me.

Will be trying this recipe. Was wondering if 2 oz. of extra lean ground beef is right.

Very good twist to the standard chili recipes.  The strong coffee, the ancho pepper and porter beer are probably the key to this one going to the top! I did not tweak it a bit.  If I did, I would have to change my rating.  You really got to try this one!!!!!!! Gloria D

The flavor is good as well as the texture but I have to agree with the other reviewer in regards to the sweetness.  I have to add 4 tablespoons of white vinegar to reduce the amount of sweet.  I recommend a 1/4 cup of brown sugar to start and than add more to desired taste.  Love the idea of the anch chili and porter beer.

This chili had great texture and just the right amount of heat for my taste.  However, it was way too sweet. If I make it again I will eliminate the chili sauce and reduce the brown sugar to no more than a 1/4 cup.  I had to add quite a bit of white vinegar to offset the sweetness.

I needed a great bean less Chili due to allergys & bean dislikes in family  I didn't add the beer or the sugar.  But I did add 2 cups chopped celery along with the onion. Instead of adding cornmeal to tighten up the juices I put 1/4 cup pot/pearl barley into crockpot at beginning.  About 1-2 hrs before serving I added 2 cans of "nibblet" corn.   Gives it some color and texture.  Could cut back on jalape√±o peppers when serving younger kids
