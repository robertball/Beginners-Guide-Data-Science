Fantastic!  My partner and I loved this dish, and he usual hates pork chops!  I wouldn't go for this unless you definitely like lemon flavours as it is quite zippy but we thought the reduced sauce had a lovely flavour.  Served with wild rice and lemon sauteed zucchini.

I used pork tenderloin because I like that better and it just needed a shorter cooking time. Also, garlic doesn't sit well with my husband so I only used a touch of it and substituted half an onion for the rest of it. I also followed the advice of others and cut the cayenne down to 1/4 tsp because 1/2 seemed like too much for the size of the dish (I think I had less pork than most also). Also needed to add a bit of water to saute because there wasn't enough liquid. It came out perfect! Husband loved it and we will definitely be making this one again.

This is a great marinade. Lemon flavor is not that strong, and the spicy-ness is just right. If you like to taste the flavor of the lemon I would suggest adding more.

Tip: If you by you meat in bulk like I do. Place this recipe in a freezer with the meat (I used pork) and freeze. When ready to cook defrost all day in the fridge and it marinates while it defrosts. Throw it on the grill and you are good to go.

We really liked this. The only change I made was to cube the pork and saute it to cook - only because I have better luck with it that way. Lemony and spicy, just like the title! Thanks!

The pork turns out very tender and is not dry at all, however the recipe turns out a VERY spicy pork chop!

Nice kick! Pork chops were tasty and moist. I cut the paprika down to 3/4 tsp and that was plenty! I also added mushrooms and asparagus to the sauce at the end. Definitely a dish that I'll make again.

I just made these for dinner.  I made it exactly as the recipe suggest.  I thought they were good, but not a 5 star recipe.  In the future, I plan to change some things.  I agree that the lemon was too much ( and I eat lemons raw, so I love sour lemon taste ) It did not seem to blend with the other flavors but rather stand out on its own.  I love spicy, and these were that.  If you don't like hot reduce the cayenne pepper.   I am actually going to try and make these again tomorrow night.  I am afraid if I cut the lemon juice in half there will not be enough liquid to reduce and pour over the chops.   I am going to try and do half the amount of lemon juice and the other half chicken broth or boulion.  I am also going to lightly brown as the recipe calls for, and then I am going to finish them up in a slow cooker or dutch oven over the course of a few hours.   I like pork chops much better when they have been simmered for a long time, and then maybe the flavors will blend a little more.  I will keep you posted on the results.  Thanks Sabryson for the recipe, it gave me a good thought for tonights dinner.  Ok, made them again.  This time I used all of the dry ingredients mixed them together and rubbed it on the chops. Then I dredged the chops through some flour and fried them on either side for 5 minutes.  Then I slow coooked them in the lemon and garlic but this time I replaced half of the lemon with chicken broth !!  Hmmm....fall off the bone delicious !!  On to chicken !!!

Greek flair, very tasty, lemony & spicy. I too used pork loin. Make a double batch easily & freeze some for a quick meal served over noodles or rice.....

I thought this had a lot of zip.  The lemon was strong, but we liked it.  Definitely a great alternative to plain porkchops.  I think I'm going to try the same recipe with chicken next time.

my fiance and I both really liked it at first, but the lemon got too strong for us after a few bites.  I love lemon, and would still recommend using about half the amount in the recipe.

i  made this last night for me and my husband.  after reading reviews, i used a little less lemon juice, a little less cayenne and a little more olive oil.  i also did not use thyme as my husband doesn't like it.  i used pork loin chops.  there was enough sauce left to drizzle over the rice.  we both really enjoyed this and i will def. make again - so easy!

Very good!  I added a cup of chicken broth because of some of the comments about it being too lemony.  I was glad I did because I had to cook my pork a while to get it tender.  By the time my pork was tender the sauce was just about gone.  Nice flavor though!  Ate it with rice and garlicy broccoli.  I will make it again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Just made it last night and I loved it!  I will be making this again...All I did is add about 1/3 cup of water to the lemon juice to cut it a little.  All these recent reviwers said it was too lemony and dried out but mine were extremely juicy and tender and O man I may just make the 1 I have leftover for breakfast because its making my mouth water just writing this.   It was a bit on the spicy side but thats how I like it.

Okay its one week later and Im about to make these again only this time more pork chops!  Paring them with fresh lemon butter asparagus...Im also thinking of these as bite size appetizers for many other recipies or partys...the flavor packs a punch.  Seriously if your tired of the same old stuff give these a shot and just cut the lemon with a little water...the more jliquid the better, it just ensures that theyre tender....and that makes more reduced sauce to pour over them...its like a spicy lemon shot to your face  boo-yaw!

I love lemon, but this was soooo sour I couldn't eat mine. The pork was tough and I don't know if it was the meat or the way they were cooked. I will try them again using half the lemon and some chicken broth, and slow cook them.

I would just suggest to make sure that you are using thick pork cuts, my first time they were a little thin which made the spices and the lemon juice stand out more.

excellent recipe.I used tenderloin and it only needed 10 min.of shimmering.The tangy lemony meat it was a treat for mwe and my boyfriend and it was spicy as well.If you don't like that kind of spic don't put red pepper but some dijon mustard that goes great with lemon.one of the best ways to make pork easy and super fast.

OMG...they are a keeper. I don't do very spicy food so I used the cayenne pepper sparingly, but next time I will try a little more. I did use 3 large garlic cloves and 1/4 c. lemon juice for 2 chops. They were SO tender and moist I couldn't believe it, because I usually ruin pork chops when I fry them.  This recipe is a company one...would be proud to serve it to anyone. :-)

Simple and good. These pork chops had  a light taste with just the right amount of spice.  Most time pork can be heavy and overwhelming, but these were nice and light...and very very tender. A keeper for a busy mom. I served with brown rice and broccoli and cheese. YUM

Just perfect! I love lemon! I added half carrot and half zucchini, both cut in very thin slices. It gave a very nice color but also taste. Thanx for the recipe!

Unless you really like lemons, I would suggest that you use a less acidic juice like orange, instead of the lemon juice.  Otherwise this is a great recipe.

Hubby said it was a 5, my thought is a 4. I added just a touch of nutmeg and thickened with cornstarch. Made a nice rich hot and sour sauce.

This was pretty good.  Following a lot of the comments, I only used half the lemon juice (1/4 cup).  I didn't quite fill a teaspoon with the cayenne pepper, and it was too spicy for me, but my boyfriend loved it.  I did a few things a little different--I mixed all the spices and lemon juice together before hand and poured a bit over each chop.  After the twenty minutes was up, the liquid had pretty much cooked down itself (perhaps because I didn't have a lid big enough and just put tin foil over the pan).  It was still pretty delicious, though I will definitely go a little lighter on the cayenne next time.

I followed the recipe except for cutting the cayenne pepper in half. The lemon was just too overpowering; at the end, while reducing the sauce, I added about half a tablespoon of sugar and a sprinkle of salt; that cut the acidity, but it just wasn't to my taste. At least the chops were pretty moist and tender!

It was a decent and easy dish to make but noting crazy special.  The mix of spice with sour was good.

I love lemon things, but in this recipe it seemed to stand out and not blend.  Also, no salt so I put in some of a bouillon cube.  I had bought spare ribs (with more meat than bone) and was looking for a different  way to cook them and this recipe fitted in.  No where near enough sauce, so added some water.  Can't say I thought much of it.

Pretty tasty. Would have liked more sauce to accompany it afterward, but it was still delicious, served with rice.

I wanted to like this so badly, but even after adding chicken broth, a tsp of sugar, and sour cream to cut the tartness, I still didn't care for it.

This is a pretty good recipe.  Although, I think the amount of lemon juice should be decreased.  I think it made the sauce a bit too strong.  Of course, I had to modify the recipe a bit to suit my taste, so I added 1/2 onion and let it simmer in the sauce for a while.  It added more of a savory flavor and calmed the acid from the lemon juice.  Overall, it was a good recipe.  Try it out!

Let me just start this off by saying that I did like this recipe a lot. My family, however... 
The way of cooking the pork was perfect, it was tender and delicious. The sauce was a bit lemony. I drizzled some honey over them to cut the sour taste, and it did help a bit, but not quite enough for my parents and picky boyfriend. He didn't even try past the first bite. Everyone else ate it, they just weren't crazy about the lemon. Definitely cut the lemon juice, and serve with honey, and it's delicious. :)

Good effort in writing and posting, but much too sour. Meat, because of the lemon, was dry and tough. Will read recipe reviews from now on.

Is there a secret to making this without it being all dried out?  Very disappointed.  I used boneless pork chops and followed the recipe exactly.  Very tough and dry.

Would never make this again. Why it has 3 1/2 stars is beyond me. If you read the reviews most people changed it, and mostly what they did was use less lemon juice or substitute a sweet liquid. If you must try it know it is TART and not much else.

the concept was good, but I didn't care for the blend of flavors. I may experiment with a different blend of flavors, maybe mustard or italian flavors.

Sauce was great.  However, cooking a 1/2 inch chop for 30 minutes is way too long.   I used 1 inch chops and it was too long by at least 15 minutes.   Too dry.

We cut boneless chops into small bite size pieces, and served over rice, and later in tortillas.  It made the dinner stretch farther, and it also helped with the family members who don't like really spicy foods.

Wow. This recipe was interesting. I used fresh lemon juice. It was like sucking on a lemon, my face puckered with every bite. I would try it again, but WAY less lemon juice, or water it down or something. I had to eat it with ketchup to chill it out!

The pork came out very tender which is great but it was to spicy and the lemon was overpowering. I will try this recipe again but will cut way down on the spice and lemon.

Very good. I used only half the lemon juice and an eighth tsp of cayenne. That was enough spice heat for my family. Otherwise everyone liked it.

This dish isn't spicy, just hot, even after cutting the red ingredients by half.  I used a pork tenderloin and floured and browned the pieces before adding the sauce ingredients.  I used the juice of 1 lemon--still too much.  Can't figure out what this needs, but won't make it again.

I made this for dinner for my family tonight.  It was good.  I think I might have overcooked the pork as it turned out a little dry.  I also think I might have tried to thicken the sauce to make a 'gravy'.  Very spicy for children ... mine kept drinking her milk like crazy!! :)

Question:  Has anyone tried this with lime instead of lemon?  I prefer it.

I used pork chops and also pork tenderloin - both are good but I recommend the tenderloin (just a better cut of meat overall).  Very yummy and healthy!!!

This recipe says it has a lot of zip.  It has way too much zip for us.  Don't reduce the amount of lemon juice (you need the extra liquid) The cayenne was over powering.  Coun't taste the garlic.  We like spicy but this was way over the top. Won't make this again.  The "thai pork loin" from this site is awesome, try that instead

Delicious flavor!  Just be careful not to overcook, because the pork gets too dry.

Here are the changes I made:  I sprinkled Kosher salt and pepper on the pork before I browned them in lard (that I had rendered from organic pig.)  I reduced the lemon to 1/3 c. & added some water;  reduced the cayenne to a pinch; added 1/2 ts. of salt to the marinade.  The reduced sauce was a little strong, but very tasty.  The pork was very tender.

I just trid this, and followed the recepi to the "T". My 1st bite, I wasn't sure, but the more I ate of it, the tastier it got, and I ended up eating the whole 1st one fairly quickly. Something new for the taste for sure! The pork I used was called "Pork Rib-eye". A little over 1/2 " thick,inexpensive($1.97/lb) and very tender, and moist. I came to my cmptr to rate this at 3 1/2 stars, but my taste-buds have me convinced to upgrade to a 4.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and cut the lemon juice in half and added some chicken broth.  The chops were dry and bland.  The sauce wasn't bad but it just didn't get into the meat.  Doubt I'll make this one again.

I enjoyed the flavors a great deal.  I used just a smidgen of oil to cut the amount of fat.  It was delicious and easy.  I will make this again, with other cuts of pork as well.

Ehhh...I followed the recipe but I am not sure why this would be really good.  We love lemon and spice but this was weird.  The lemon was so sour and there was nothing to balance the acid.  Will not make again!

I followed the recipe to the letter other then adding a little chicken stock to mellow out the lemon a touch.  It was very good, and we didn't find it hot at all.

My family inhaled this dish.  I made the recipe with the ingredients as listed and added chopped carrots when I covered and simmered for 20 minutes. I served it over rice in shallow bowls. Yummolicious!

I made this according to the directions, very easy, very lemon, it did have a spicy flavor, the dish was  gritty because of the spices.  I won't add this to my recipe book.

Needed to use a hand-breaded pork loin but didn't want a sandwich - thought this was a delicious way to prepare the moist, fork-tender meat.

This was pretty spicy for me, dont know if I put the wrong amount of cayenne in it I thought I followed the directions.  Good taste~
2nd time making it I really like it more, spices balanced better this time around- very tastey!
