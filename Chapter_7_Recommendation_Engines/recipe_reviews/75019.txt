I've made this several times now... first exactly as called for in the recipe, then with personal tweaks.  Now it's one of our staple meals!  I always cook the chicken first with seasonings, garlic, sweet onion, and sometimes a red pepper.  Also we prefer spinach over lettuce, to which I add a handful of chopped, fresh cilantro and sometimes green onions.  The dressing is stellar.  Once I made the chicken extra spicy, and added 2 Tablespoons of plain yogurt and 1 Tablespoon of mango chutney to the dressing to balance the flavors, which was also really, really good.

Mango and avacado is a wonderful combo and the dressing is beautiful. I think I'd even make it again to use as a dressing for any type of salad or as a sauce for chicken.  I did use spinach instead of lettuce and found that to be very tasty.

Great flavor, nice colors, this dish was unusual, and everyone seemed to like it. Filling yet light, and used as a main dish. The lime juice gave it a nice tartness, but was balanced with the brown sugar.  I used chicken tenderloins cooked & lightly seasoned just before making the salad, and added 1/2 c of shredded carrots just because I wanted extra veggies in it. Really good, I'd make it again.

I made a few changes to this recipe.  I nixed the brown sugar because mango is sweet enough on its own and seasoned the chicken first with chili powder, cayenne pepper and garlic then added some hot sauce to it.  I diced some tomatoes, red onions and cilantro to add to the avocado and mango, added the lime juice and then topped with the chicken.  Instead of iceberg lettuce which I find disgusting, I used spinach.  Came out great.  The spicy savory taste of the chicken was nicely juxtaposed with the sweetness of the mango and the buttery avocado.

I really liked the dressing but I do not know what type of chili garlic sauce was used - I used the hot Asian type and used 3/4 of a tsp.  I also added 2 T. Mango Chutney.  Fabulous !  You can leaave out the chicken for a first course
salad and add some thin slices of red bell pepper and for extra fun top with a little toasted sunflower seeds.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks.

I usually like combinations of flavors like thi, but this just didn't work for me.  Best to eat immediately after making; it doesn't keep well at all, even a day.

Very bold flavors. I loved the sweet/spicy combo of the dressing. I used simple grilled chicken - sliced thin on top of the salad and it worked out nicely. One important note is not to pour the entire batch of sauce over the top. A couple of drizzles should do, or the flavors of the salad are overpowered â€“ more can be added as needed.

Really love this dish. I shred the chicken up and toss it into the chopped lettuce (my family like it with Iceberg Lettuce) and if you don't have any mangoes, tinned mandarines are also nice with it too. I am not keen on the dressing, but my family and I love this dish with ranch dressing. A lovely meal in the summer months.

This was pretty easy and yummy to make. The dressing was good if you used only a little bit, but it was easily overwhelming on the salad.

VERY good! Awesome variation from the typical chicken salads out there. I'd make sure to have very ripe mangos next time to offset the firmness of the diced avacados.  Delicious!

I think it's better without the chicken.  The salad stands alone with just the fruit.

This recipe does not call for iceberg lettuce, the spring mix has a wonderful combination of spinach, endive a nice variety of baby leave. I love a good salad and I will certainly give this one a try!

I was really surprised by how good this recipe turned out.  I was a little skeptical of the blend of ingredients, but the sweetness of the mango blended nicely with the taste of the avocado and the mild spiciness of the dressing.  Unfortunately my mango wasn't quite ripe and my avocado was a little TOO ripe, so I don't think my finished product lived up to this recipe's full potential, but it was so good that I have incentive to try again with better produce.  I'm not much of a "salad guy" (though I'm trying) so my seal of approval and plan to try this one again says a lot.  Next time I want to try it with spinach instead of lettuce.

I thought this was great!  I wanted it as a starter instead of a main so I left out the chicken and added banana instead - I was only making it for myself so converted it to 2 servings (one for tomorrow) for the sauce and eyed the fruit.  It was delicious and I will definitely make this again!

This was pretty good.  I served it in lettuce cups.  Next time I'd add more veggies for some crunch. IDK what kind of chili sauce the recipe author used.  I had some chili paste, and only added about a 1/4 tsp. which was just enough heat.  I garnished with some chopped peanuts.

This was an interesting mix of ingredients.  I didn't want the dressing too hot so I only added a little chile garlic sauce at a time and tasted it.  I ended up using a couple tablespoons I think.  In my opinion, the chicken needs a little more seasoning.  I cooked mine in a pan with salt and pepper, but something additional would be nice. Actually leftover rotisserie chicken might be nice.

I'm not a fan of fruit in salads or savory dishes but I liked the idea of mango with avocado. I cut back on the brown sugar - used a little less than 1/2 tbsp  for 4 servings - and I also threw in some arugula as I love it. This was quick, easy and very pretty. Thanks, GreenLime!

I thought this salad was excellent!  A great blend of the sweet mango and the slightly spicy dressing (but not too spicy, don't worry).  I think I would add some sliced red pepper next time for some extra flavor and color.

I was skeptical of the dressing but made according to directions. My kids LOVED this salad! Kept the avocado separate so left overs would keep better. Next time I'm doubling the dressing.

This salad was fabulous.  We could have made half the dressing as we only drizzled a couple tablespoons on each person's salad and that was perfect!  Loved the flavor combinations!  My daughter asked for it again yesterday and today. A keeper!

I love really spicy food but both my husband I thought this dressing (even in small amounts) was so spicy that most people would not/could not eat it.  I double checked all of my ingredients and the amounts.  Not sure if there are different types/strengths of chili garlic sacue.  I, however, loved the chicken, avocado and mango combination and will continue to play with the dressing.

I would be interested to know what kind of chili garlic sauce everybody has used. I used Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce and found the dressing just a tiny bit too sweet. I am tinkering with the dressing to get more heat and will add some sriracha or samba oelek, next. The combination of the avocado, mangoes and chicken works very well together. Two suggestions though: 1) Make only as much as you plan to eat. It does not keep well. 2) Don't use avocado or mango that are too ripe. The resulting mush isn't too attractive.

I've been looking for a mango chicken salad recipe and this one's a keeper! I changed it a little by adding one cup of toasted pecans and putting the salad on a bed of baby spinach drizzled with dressing in a spinach wrap. I will definitely make this again!

Thought this recipe was very nice. We used sriracha for the chili garlic sauce and romaine hearts instead of a spring lettuce mix. It was delicious with a lot of good heat to it. I poach my chicken so that it remains light, healthy and tender

I add chopped red onions and skip the lettuce mix.  I pile this on spinach-lined lavash bread.  I drool just thinking about how amazing this is.  Thank you for a wonderful, easy recipe.

I don't mind spicy, but I don't like heat, and this dressing was way too hot for my taste.   I'm glad I put the dressing on sparingly as other reviewers suggested.   It at least allowed me to finish my salad, but I can't say I enjoyed it.   If you shy away from hot sauce, this is not the dressing for you.   If I made this again, I would cut way back on the concentration of the chili garlic sauce.   But to be honest, I'm not that motivated to do a take 2.   I'm glad I discovered chili garlic sauce because I think it has uses in other applications more appropriate than a cold salad dressing.

Me and my husband love this salad! The taste is playful, a lil bit spicy, fresh and sweet. The mango I used was very sweet. So, I will not use sugar in the dressing next time.

I love this recipe! And it's on for tonight's dinner again. It's so easy to make and the flavours of sweet and spice work so well in this recipe. My tip is to use guacamole when you (like me) realize you forgot to buy avocado.. it's a little different, but it works too!

Very good but the dressing is VERY spicy.  I bought the chip garlic sauce in the asian section. The degree of spiciness over powers the other flavors. Will make again but less chili sauce.  Thank goodness I tasted the dressing ahead of time and didn't pour the entire amount on the salad, it would have been inedible.  As a gage, when at a Thai restaraunt  I order my food mild.

I found this to be a bit bland.  I would def spice up the chicken a lot and probably add more veggies for flavor.  You can build off this nicely.

Super easy and tasty.  We used store-bought roast chicken.  For the "garlic chili sauce," I wasn't really sure what that was, but I had a bottle of Thai Plum Garlic Sauce by Robert's Reserve in the fridge and I used that--it worked great, even though I had only half the amount called for.  I can't wait to make this dish again.  A perfect summer dish.

I really loved it. We had trouble nailing down the dressing but were able to come up with our own concoction that worked well. I imagine you could use several types of dressing for the salad like ginger sesame or something similar.

It was really spicy so didn't add as much chili garlic sauce.  My mango was really ripe so got super juices.  Overall good and refreshing but mango overpowered avocado and couldn't taste avocado.  I really liked adding croutons

Super spicy, wow! I hesitated to put all the recommended Chili Garlic sauce into the dressing, so used 1/4 cup instead of 1/2. Resulting dressing was still pretty spicy, so other comments suggesting that you just drizzle some on should be heeded! I do love the combination of chicken, mango and avocado over greens. A great way to use leftover chicken.

I normally like all the items listed in the ingredient list.  However, this combination just fell flat for me.  It was a grey way to use up items from the fridge but I wouldn't make it again.

Love this recipe. Of course, I tweek it. I use tubes of ginger, about a tbsp. along with chili paste in the dressing. I also use a red pepper for color effect and some fresh basil. Sometimes I use turkey instead of chicken. I pan blacken the turkey cutlet in chill powder, let cool and add it to the other ingredients and the result pleases all who eat it. But fundamentally, the recipe stands on its own without my two cents.

Didn't  have avocado on hand so omitted that. Used a tablespoon of mango chutney, regular chilli sauce and no sugar as dressing. We all loved this easy summer recipe. Thanks so much. It's a keeper!

We really enjoyed this! It was very satisfying, likely on account of the avocado. It was a great combination of sweet and spicey. I enjoy spicey food, however I still halved the chili sauce and added another 2tbsp of brown sugar + 1 cup of water for  a milder version. Next time I will also add more lime juice as well.

I don't know how they make chili garlic sauce where you live but in Safeway Sacramento its pretty dam hot.  I like habernero on just about everything, but this was too much.  My gal would not eat it.  So cut back on the hot stuff if you want some affection.
