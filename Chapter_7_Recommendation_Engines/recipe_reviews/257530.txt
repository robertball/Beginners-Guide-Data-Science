This a great, fast and easy way to make a single egg in the morning. I sprayed the mug with oil first, as I've made these before, and it sticks a bit if I don't add the oil. My microwave only takes 60 seconds for mine to be perfect. I added a little hot sauce on top.

I made this and cooked it for a minute and 45 seconds just to be safe. Besides what's in the recipe itself, after cooking I added salt and a half slice of thin cheddar jack (?) cheese. It tasted pretty good. Be sure to cook it all the way.

I make this all the time.  It definitely helps with clean up to spray the mug with cooking spray.  I also stir the egg half way through the cooking time.  It cooks more evenly and you can adjust the cooking time as needed as microwaves vary.  I add a few real bacon crumbles, and then sprinkle shredded cheese on top when done.  Yum!

Simple way to make scrambled eggs. 90 seconds in a 1000W microwave worked great.

This was really good. I used three eggs and added spinach and a few of my own spices. I microwaved it for 90 seconds, stirred it, then zapped it again for another 20 seconds or so. The eggs were nice and fluffy and they definitely don’t get cold quickly in the mug. The one complaint is that the mug doesn’t come clean in the dishwasher. Needed to scrub it by hand. Will most likely make again.

The secret to this  is  to cook on low power 30 seconds for each egg, stir well on leave a little bit runny and stir again!

I did it twice.  The first time it stuck to the sides of the mug.  The second time I sprayed the mug with non stick spray and that seemed to release the eggs from the side of the mug.  I could actually flip it out of the mug and onto a plate.   I'd like to try adding a little cheese and maybe some bacon bits and putting the result on those thin hamburger buns like a sandwich.

Worked out great! My control board went out in my stove so I'm currently waiting on a new board so I had to improvise on breakfast. I lightly sprayed pam on the inside of the mug I used 2 eggs 1 tbsp of milk added garlic salt and pepper whipped it up and did 90 seconds in the microwave and it was perfect had plenty of flavor I'm a spicy lover so I added tobasco. You can do just about anything with this tho add some cheese avacodo and crumbles of bacon on top. My kids liked it too cuts down on mess and much faster. Not saying I'll never make eggs on the stove again but in a pinch or looking for a quick breakfast this is it.

EWW!  I used two eggs and increased the milk,  beating as directed.  Cook for 90 sec. and the eggs were rubber and zero flavor.   If I were to make these again, they'd definitely only cook for a min. and cheese or something else besides pepper would be added.
