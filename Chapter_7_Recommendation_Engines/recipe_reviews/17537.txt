The taste was not too bad, but if you would like the bars to be soft and chewy, bake them at least 5 minutes less than the recommended time.

My mom used to make these for us as kids when she didn't have the time to spend making drop cookies.  She added an extra touch.  Before putting in the oven she sprinkled approx. 1 cup of choc chips over the top of the dough in the pan, put it in the heated oven for a minute or two, took it out, and then ran a knife through the melted chocolate on top, swirling it throughout the pan cookie.  Looks beautiful when baked and cooled!

Cut down butter to 3/4 cup, but still a little much. Baked in 9x13 pan for about 25-30 mins.

My mom made these for my sisters and I as kids and it was a favorite then as it is now with my own two daughters. 

The key is making sure the butter or margazine is room temp. I once melted to liquid and that worked terribly. Also, go easy on the pan when greasing or your will get greasy bars!

I followed the recipe exactly, but used a fat free butter substitute, Splenda granulated and brown sugar, and a fat free egg substitute. The cookie "cake" still came out great! It was moist, chewy, and light. Saved me a lot of money not buying this pre-made, and it was nice knowing it wasn't completely awful for me as far as the fat and sugar content. Thanks a lot!

I formed the dough into the shape of a heart to make a large cookie, without a heart-shaped pan. I made a border of foil to surround the heart so it didn't spread. Cookie turned out good and chewy.

Although there are thousands of variations on the chocolate chip cookie, nothing beats the original Nestle version.  Nothing ever will.

These are great!  I LOVE the Nestle Toll House chocolate chip cookies better than any other brand.  This is my first time making the bar version and it worked pretty well.  The only thing is I used a 9x13in pan for a thicker cookie which drastically increased the cooking time to at least 40 minutes.

Also JDLAMBERT is right...the secret is all in the butter.  While making the drop cookie version I once accidentally melted the butter too much (it was liquid) and the cookies turned out very spongy and cake-like.  Couldn't figure out why until it kept happening every time I made the cookies.  

If you soften the butter too much it doesn't cream well with the sugar.  You want to achieve a fluffy, airy texture like scrambled eggs when you beat the butter and sugar together.  So now what I do is get the butter out first thing and set it on the preheating oven to soften a bit (don't use the microwave).  Usually it is still cold by the time I'm ready to use it but using a solid stick of cold butter is better than using liquified butter because you can't achieve the same scrambled egg consistency with butter that is too soft or melted.

I don't usually take the time I should to rate recipes- but this is the best "cookie bar" recipe I've ever made.  I used a 13 x 9 pan, and they came out chewy, soft inside, not dry- absolutely delicious.  Best thing is that they are so easy to make!

I just made a few batches of these for my 12yr olds Enrichment class and they came out perfect. I only used 3/4 cup of butter and they are still nice and moist. My 9yr old has asked me to send some to his class party on Friday so we definately have a new favorite!

I have never had good luck making cookies on pan form. I tried these today, not expecting much...and they came out so good. This is my new favorite cookie recipe...much easier than baking individual cookies!!  I used a 13x9 pan and baked for 25 minutes.

Quick and wonderful! I followed the recipe as written, except I baked it in a 9x13 pan.  I had to bake for about 35 minutes, and the cookies came out perfectly gooey and soft! Will make again!

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars- it is perfect!! The recipe is also found on the back of the bag of chocolate chips. I just made them tonight for the third time and they are delicious!! I do cut back on the chocolate chips and add more vanilla ( personal preference).  Line your jelly roll pan with parchment paper and they come out and cut like a dream!!  I baked them for 20 minutes each time and they are perfectly soft and chewy- I think if you were to cut the time down further they would be to underdone. Thanks for a great recipe!!

The recipe says to use a 15x10-inch pan, I used a 9x13-inch pan and my cookies were BARELY an  inch thick !!!!, If I had baked them in the pan that was suggested, they would have been like crackers.

This recipe is a classic, always turns out great! I find it hilarious when reviewers say "I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted this, and this, and this..." That is NOT following it exactly, duh! Haha...anyway, this recipe is perfect as-is :)

Even better: Add a cup of peanut butter to the dough, and put half the morsels on top, not in the dough. five minutes before it's done, run a knife through the melted chocolate to "swirl" it.

Perfection! A great fix when you are short on time but have to bake something! Made one pan using an egg substitute powder and one with eggs... both baked up very nicely. I also doubled the vanilla & added a cup of chopped walnuts. Thanks!!!

I make this often and always get compliments. It is best when slightly undercooked....which makes the bars soft. I cook at 350 for the first 10 minutes, then cook at 325 and check every 8 minutes until very lightly browned on the edges.

This recipe was easy to make and super delicious. I substituted Spelt Flour, non-hydrogenated margarine and Sugar in the Raw (for both white and brown sugar) in the same measure and it worked out perfectly.  I can't keep these in the house for more than a day or two!

this was really really good!  only instead of a jelly pan i but it in a 9x13in pan and it turned out really well, especially if you use pam because the cookie practically jumps out at you!  also, to make these into a blondie, put a chocolate icing on top and its delicious!  almost like a chocolate cookie cake!  the recipe is really easy and i really liked it!

Baked exactly according to the recipe (using the metal 10 x 15 inch jelly pan). The time suggested is too long, they were golden brown by 16 minutes.

As others have suggested it is important to bring butter and eggs to room temperature. The key in baking this cookie bar (as with any other baking recipe) is to cream the butter and sugar until it is creamy (I used a kitchen-aid stand mixer on medium speed for about 5 minutes). Once creamy barely beat in the egg on the lowest mixer setting. Once the egg is incorporated add the dry mixture on the slowest setting until just incorporated. Then hand mix in the chocolate chips and nuts very gently. If the dough is buttery with butter coming out of the batter, refrigerate for about 10 minutes before spreading in the pan. Also, to grease the pan, just use the butter left on the wrappers. You shouldn't be able to see any butter, if you do wipe it clean with a paper towel, the residual butter should be enough to coat the pan. If you do not do this the excess butter will cause the bottom of the cookie to burn.

i love this traditional recipe for chocolate chip cookie bars!!  great for when i don't have the time or patience to make cookies but want something sweet.  we will usually make them in a 9x13" pan, which makes them a bit thicker, and so they require a few additional minutes to cook.  otherwise we stick to the recipe each time and they're no-fail!

These are great bar cookies.  The consistency is perfect-- dense, chewy, soft. I made a few adaptations: I added crumbled snickers bars and baked for 30-35 minutes in a 13x9" glass baking dish. Amazing.

Great taste but way too much butter.  It was very gooey and my family only ate the edges.  I will try using only 1/2 cup next time.

wonderful and easy to make. I started baking these one day and discovered I did not have chopped nuts. I had a package of  dried cherries on hand and used those instead. Worked great. Now, when I bake these I use either chopped nuts or the dried cherries. Both are big hits with my family.

Yum, I thought it was pretty good and REALLY chocolatey.  Pan cookies are a lot easier than drop cookies, so I recomend this recipe if you need quick, delicous cookies.

Delicious, of course! One thing I don't think I saw on here that would be helpful for some is that if you have a dark pan you should adjust the temperature to 25 degrees lower than what the recipe says so you do not burn your cookies.  Baked mine in a dark pan at 350 for 23-24 min and they turned out fine.  They are a cake like bar and next time I might try baking them a few minutes less so they are chewier.

These were very good.  I used about half mini and half white.  They are a nice finishing touch as a dessert or a snack w/o being too over the top.  The directions mentioned nuts although the ingredients do not list them, but I liked the suggestion so I added in some pecan meal.

A little too greasy at the bottom of the pan for my liking - but otherwise excellent. Next time I will add a cup of oats to see if that soaks up a little of the butter.

These were great! Everyone loved them!  I used dark brown sugar so they would be chewy.  I cooked at the 375 degrees as in recipe, but for only 15 mins. Any longer and  I would have burned them, might just be my oven  but next time I will bake at 325 or 350.

This is the best recipe for making pan cookies.  I don't think it's cakey at all.  My son loves this for his birthday every year as he doesn't like cake. I cut the salt back to 3/4 tsp.

Kinda like cake, these are even better the day after baking. I like this recipe as is, though I find that adding chopped pecans and/or walnuts and a little bit of peanut butter improves the flavor.

They turned out great! The key is the butter, just put two sticks from the frige to the microwave for 25 seconds! Bake for 35 mins in a 9x13 pan sprayed lightly with pam.

These are a nice change from your regular choc chip cookie. I like them a bit softer so I start checking them at around 15 minutes. Tastes like bein' a kid again. Gotta love Nestle TOLL HOUSE!

Made some changes and these were AMAZING! Cooked up nicely in 25ish minutes at about 350 degrees in a 9x13 lined with parchment paper. Changed some recipe bits to 1/2 cup of butter, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, half a bag of dark chocolate chip morsels, whole wheat flour instead of white, and 1/4th cup water added after dry ingredients added to wet to help the flour work in - it's a bit dry otherwise. Used room temperature butter put in the microwave for 5 seconds, not melted or cold. Middle came out great, edges came out soft, beautiful cookie bars the whole way through!

Just found the original recipe on another site. Use 1 cup hard Crisco (not Crisco oil) instead of the butter and your cookies will taste much better!

I cooked the bars in a 13 by 9 pan at 350 for 30 min. and were delicious, but very dry by next day.  I'll try cooking less next time.

I made these twice (reducing the time by 5 min the 2nd time with the same results), and maybe it's because I added whole wheat flour, but they came out a little dark and crunchy around the edge.  I would bake for 10 min or reduce the oven temp to 350.

I've been making these forever!  They are so easy to whip together at a moments notice!  I do 1/2 semi sweet and 1/2 milk chocolate chips. They never last long in my house.

Wanted to make a cookie cake, but I should have measured my jelly roll pan before I baked this...mine was 12x18. I had no idea they came in so many different sizes. It looked beautiful when it came out of the oven, but was dry as a bone because I baked it too long for the size pan I had. So the next time I will either use my 9x13 baking pan or my pizza pan and bake it less time.

put dough in a heart shaped cake pan that was greased and lined with wax papper and greased again.  Cooked about 20 min, ran knife around the edge and fliped in out on to cooling rake.  Carefully peeled the paper off.  After it cooled I was able to flip it over to the pretty side and decorate it.

Very tasty!!! I followed the recipe, except i only HAD 3/4c. of butter.  Otherwise i wouldn't have changed anything.  I don't like making batches of cookies (mess/lack of space/takes too much time) but this was super easy and no mess, and was in the oven in no time!

I LOVE these cookies. The only thing different I did was refrigerate the dough 45 min. Then after I spooned a pan in I would keep the rest of the dough in the refrigerator until needed again.

These are always a hit! Simple, classic goodness. I sometimes add chopped nuts to these too and I usually add more choc. chips because we like a lot! Easy to make and makes a TON, so they are great for when you want a cookie, but don't feel like scooping them out. These are also great for picnics and bake sales. :)

This is almost exactly like my choc chip cookie recipe.  It was fantastic!  I decided to set my oven at 350 and baked for 28 mins. It was perfect!  Remember all ovens are different so you need to gage accordingly.  This is a keeper!

We all loved the taste of this recipe, but it was way too greasy!!  I tried it twice with the same results.  Like a previous poster said, I was looking for something soft and chewy, these were kind of hard.

These cookies were really delicious - the only reason I'm not giving them five stars is because they were pretty greasy.  They seemed to have a little too much butter, so I'll probably try cutting back a little next time.  If they aren't as good with less butter, I guess I'll sacrifice(!) and make them with the full amount.  Also, I can't imagine making them in a jelly roll pan - a 9x13 pan was almost too big as it was.  If you like them thick, try a smaller pan.  Easy and delicious - great recipe!

These were good.  I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the nuts because my daughter doesn't like it and instead of greasing the pan, I lined it with parchment paper.  The cookies still came out a bit greasy so the problem is not over greasing the pan as thought by JDLambert.  I'll be making these again.

This was a really good recipe; the bars came out very moist, and they tasted great! I took them to a friend we were visiting out of town, and her family devoured them! The batter didn't fill up the entire pan - next time I'll try it in a 13 X 9 inch baking dish. Also the recipe says to stir in the nuts, but no nuts are called for in the ingredients. We just added a handful of pecans and would definitely do that again. This recipe is a keeper!

This was excellent, especially if you like melt in your mouth type cookies.  Much easier than dropping by spoonfuls on a cookie sheet and waiting for them to cook.

These great. The exception was that I only used half a bag of chips, because I actually like the dough more than the chocolate and with the whole package used, it skews heavily to the chocolate side when made as directed (this is my 3rd time making these. This time I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil. Someone said you should use room temp over melted, but I used melted and they came out fine. I recommend cutting these up into bars after cooling and storing them in an air-tight container with a piece of bread so they don't dry out.

I just made these today and they turned out good!  As other reviewers suggested, I cut back on the butter (I used 1/2 cup).  I cut back on the choc chips, but wish I had used the full 12 ounces... I used 8 ozs and it definitely needs more!  I baked in a dark 13x9 pan and at first I was worried how thin spread the batter was.  I baked at 350 degrees for exactly 27 minutes, then let it cool (bake more on its own) in the pan on the counter for 10-15 minutes before serving.  Next time, I'm going to try making pan cookies using the Awesome choc chip cookies recipe instead... I just didn't have any instant pudding on-hand today.

I think these were kind of salty and I could taste the baking soda? I'd probably try these again, halving the salt and maybe using baking powder instead.

Love this! I also have to use Splenda as my hubby is diabetic, but I also added a couple of heaping spoonfuls of peanut butter to keep it moist (i hate splenda in baking)...and what do you know? Great! hubby was happy and kids gobbled it up! Thank you!

Super easy to make & clean up.  The kids love them.  We've made them a number of times.  The batter can come out a little dry, just add a spash of cold coffee.

AWESOME!! I made these last week and will make again today- Christmas afternoon. I agree w/ reviewer Steph a few les chocolate chips are my preference.  So I will make it with 1 cup this time around which is perfect because it leaves enough chips to make another batch for new year's day. Yum!! and so easy.

For some reason, all of my chocolate chips sank to the bottom of the bars.  Also, I was anticipating a much more gooey cookies, but that was not the case.  I have read other recipes similar to this where the recommend splitting the recipe up into 2 small pans so maybe I will try that again.  Regardless, you can't go wrong with this recipe.  It's cookie and chocolate in bar form...I guarantee you will eat it all up!

Delicious! I did 3 different kinds of chips: semi-sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, and butterscotch. It adds a deliciously sweet taste to it. 

The center was VERY chewy, but that is how we like it. If you aren't a fan of the chewy, then you'll need to modify this somehow.

I put it in a 9x12 pan and they came out too undercooked at 25 minutes I added another 10 minutes and the edges were too over done... overall a nice bar will make again following the recipe to a t

The Betty Crocker recipe is precisely this, minus one egg, which is what I've made numerous times.

I've tried other "Blondies" recipes that resulted in dry, hard blondies. Not these! They're wonderful!

pretty usual cookie bar, nothing fantastic, or superb, but still tasty. Also, this just the nestle toll house cookie recipe, minus the walnuts, and put in a pan! (I know because that cookie recipe was the recipe I was raised on.) None the less, it is good for a quick, traditional snack :-).

After reading about greasy cookies, I reduced the butter to 3/4 cup and still found that to be plenty.  Had a hard time getting this to bake          properly...hard outside, raw inside, but the taste was so good that I may try again making individual cookies.

Unfortunately, this was the first thing I decided to bake after purchasing a new oven, I also did not have the correct size baking dish, so I used a 9x9 pan. Both of these issues lead to my under-baking this recipe, which is a tragedy! Even though the cookie bars were mostly unedible this way, the part I did try was delicious. I would suggest lessening the amount of chocolate chips to 3/4th bag because they did seem over-chocolaty to me. I will definitely try making these again.

Mine came out a bit dry and greasy - sounds funny those words do not usually go together. They were not the soft chewy bar cookie I was expecting. I will try again and not cook them as long.

Everytime I make these people ask for the recipe. I use a bar of milk chocolate broken into chunks. They are AMAZING, I'm quite famous for them!

A timeless classic!  I can't even begin to count how many times I have made this recipe in my lifetime!  I use a 9X13 greased glass baking pan and they never turn out too greasy.  Also, we prefer our cookies without nuts.

This was what I have been looking for, for years!  My bar cookies always turn out hard until I tried this recipe- they stayed soft as long as they lasted, which wasnt' long!  Oh- and the only thing I changed was using margarine instead of butter.  I'm off to make this again- this time with M & Ms!

This was exactly what I was looking for. Great flavor and very easy when you are wanting a cookie, but don't want to be in the kitchen for a couple of hours. Texture was perfect. Will make often with a variety of chips.

This is a delicious cookie recipe!! And I loved that I didn't have to spoon out cookie dough on several different cookie sheets. You just plop all the cookie dough into one large pan and put it in the oven! It was so easy and so yummy!!

This pan cookie came out great! It was so moist & a perfect shade of golden brown if that information helps anyone. I loved it.

These bars were just okay to me...nothing special.  Our guests liked them - I served them warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  Probably will try another bar cookie recipe next time.

I took this recipe to a meeting, and everyone loved them.  The bars add a nice spin to the regular, round chocolate chip cookie.  To make the bars even more appealing, I added mini M&M baking bits instead of chocolate chips.  If you have kids, these M&M's will do the trick.  Either way, these cookie bars come out moist and buttery and utterly delicious!

I cooked these too long and they still turned out. That's why I'm giving them a 5 star rating instead of 4, because they were a bit greasy. My students really liked them though. They gobbled them up.
