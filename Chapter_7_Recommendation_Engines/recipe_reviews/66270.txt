Tried it once as is and I kind of felt like there was something missing. I then made one with 2 jiggers pumpkin liqueur, 1 jigger rum and 1 jigger irish cream. With the irish cream it was just perfect. I shook it until my martini shaker was frosty. Very smooth and pumpkin-y. NOTE: This is quite strong. If you are a lightweight, you might want to cut it with a little club soda or more cream.

We made it with heavy cream instead of half-and-half. It was a little too sweet, but not horrible. Maybe better in small doses.

Everyone I made this for, thought it was horrible. I think it has alot to do with the brand of pumpkin liqueur that you use. Mine did not even taste like pumpkin in the first place.

My husband & I thought this was delicious!  It's a nice pumpkin flavor without a powerful alcohol taste.  We followed the recipe as is.  The only "flare" was we added a dash of pumpkin pie spice to the top before serving.  Great recipe!

Very smooth & just the right amount of sweetness.  Sprinkled nutmeg on the top.
