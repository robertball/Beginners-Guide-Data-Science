My turkey turned out so well. It had an awesome flavor to it. I was scared that the brine was going to make it salty, but it didn't. It was very moist and tender. This is going to be ther only way I make my turkeys for now on!

This was really good!  I had to double the recipe on the brine because I had a 27 pound turkey, but it was easy and it added a lot of flavor to the turkey.  Family said that it was the best turkey that they ever had!

The first picture of this recipe is the turkey I made for Thanksgiving today! This is absolutely the best turkey I've ever made! It was so tender that the breast meat actually slid off of the carcass in the oven and into the pan below! The meat is tender and unbelievably juicy. The flavor is wonderfully savory and fragrant. Definitely worth the work! Highly recommended! Me and my parents have been picking at the meat all morning and are making plans to buy another bird to use this recipe with!

Turkey was excellent! This  redcipe made it juicy and flavorful. DH said this was the best turkey he'd ever had. And he is not a big turkey fan.

This did produce a tender turkey but I was sooo thirsty after eating it! And I tried to get off as much as the brine as I could. Also, the turkey picked up none of the flavor of the marinade whatsoever. I think Turkey Mercedes from this site is a comparable, and far superior recipe.

I was searching for a brine recipe of the ingredients I had on hand on Wednesday before Thanksgiving and came across this recipe.  I didn't have enough time for the 2nd day of the process but used the brine recipe overnight then seasoned the outside of my turkey with salt, pepper, smoked paprika(had on hand) after rubbing with olive oil.  Stuffed with onion, orange and rosemary.  VERY moist and flavorful!  Will plan ahead and do the second day next time. Didn't have a pot big enough so I put the brine inside a trash bag which I had placed in my vegetable crisper drawer then the turkey and put it in the fridge overnight- worked great.  It's a keeper!!

Awesome brine and what I call a wet rub. I did not stray except that I used dried parsley and now I am asked to bring a turkey to the family Thanksgiving. The drippings make the best gravy as well, at first it tastes a little salty, but it's all good.

I've done it three years row doing it exactly as it says and also leaving it three days with all ingredients I honestly think leaving it for three days cool garage ( it's always snowing in Montana) and not changing the water just turning and alot of knifing it was very good ) either way it was AMAZING

I'm 26 years old, and I used this blueprint for my first time hosting my family's Thanksgiving. Rave reviews of being the best Thanksgiving turkey made to date in our family. Holding onto this for next year!!

I loved it! We got great feedback from our thanksgiving dinner. Flavorful and juicy.  For the brine I did half water and half chicken stock. I needed to double the recipe to cover a 20 pound turkey.
