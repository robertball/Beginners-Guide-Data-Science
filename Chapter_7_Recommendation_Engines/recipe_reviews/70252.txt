Very nice flavour from the veal and mushrooms and beautifully moist. But I think I'll try it with fresh onions next time. Just something about the dried soup mix that didn't seem quite right - maybe it's the brand I used. Will definitely make again, though - so many thanks for the recipe.

I only had one pound of veal so I cut it in half, and I didn't use onion soup mix. Instead I chopped up half an onion and threw in some garlic and some sea salt. I also misread the recipe and ended up using "flavored" (not Italian seasoned it has a milder more subtle flavor) breadcrumbs by a company called Jason.   My husband Mike is usually a big fan of mushrooms, but he felt they were unnecessary in this dish. Before he tried it he asked if he was going to want to put ketchup on it. He ended up eating his whole portion by itself, so I'm taking that as a good sign.  I really liked it, and I'll definitely be making this again.

Very sophisticated for meat loaf.  All the adults ate this up;  the children were less enthusiastic.  The grated carrots and shitake mushrooms kept the meat moist and flavorfull.  Highly recommend!

I like this one very much.  The shitake's make such a great addition.  I think next time I'll add fresh chopped onion, (more) fresh chopped garlic and some uncooked oats for texture.  Very easy preparation.

I followed the recipe exactly and would not change it except perhaps to add a bit of Worcestershire sauce to add a bit of zing to it.  Very good hot and in a sandwich for lunch.

This recipe definitely needs some ravamping. I am not a skilled cook and followed this recipe completely. It unfortunately did not have enough flavor going on. I'm guessing some exploring in more seasoning would make this a more pleasing dish.

This wasn't really for me.  The first bite was ok, but as I ate more, I disliked it more.   My husband said three stars.  My three year old liked it though.   I made two smaller loaves.  I added a handful of onions because I had some leftover from another meal.

I reduced the recipe by half. Hubby and I thought it was good, but a little bland.  I made it w/fresh chopped white onion and used a drained can of shitake mushrooms. Also used Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs. Since I didn't use the soup mix; I added slightly less warm water along with onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper. So we were quite surprised it was bland. I also threw in a tablespoon of Oats as suggested. Placed in a smaller loaf pan and baked as written. I served this with blanched asparagus and hollandaise sauce. Dribbling the sauce on the meat helped. We both had seconds. So I will make it again. Just got to get my seasoning right.  Thanks for the unique recipe!
