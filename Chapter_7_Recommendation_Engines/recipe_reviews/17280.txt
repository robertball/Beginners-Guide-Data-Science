This recipe is fantastic.  It smoothes out the taste of the cranberries making it a great and coloful complement to the Thanksgiving meal.

I served this at my Thanksgiving dinner and once my guest figured out that it was not dessert they loved it. It does look fancy.

This gelatin had great flavor....but I could not get the red layer to set up.  I put most of it in a glass baking dish and some in glasses.  The green set up just fine, but the red was still loose.  It didn't take away from the flavor, just the presentation.  I'm going to try it again to see what I did wrong.  I

OK, making this for a club Thanksgiving dinner party.  After preparing the jello, it sez to stir in the cranberries - that being the can of whole cranberry sauce.  Did anyone figure out how to blend it all together?  There were lumps of gel so I put my hand into the mixture and broke up the cranberry sauce otherwise there would be huge globs in the bottom layer.  It surely didn't melt down!  We'll see how that all works out tomorrow.  Wish me luck.
