This is the start to a good recipe. I would use fresh pineapple. Most importantly use Cream of Coconut, NOT coconut milk. Goya makes it. I used Myers Dark Rum. I also added a little condensed milk and omitted the sugar.

I love this recipe. I often don't have all the ingredients required for other pina colada recipes, but this recipe always comes in as a great substitute. To be honest, I just stick with this one now. It's simple and yields wonderful results. I've made this many times for company and always get raves. The only thing I do different is add more ice.  Thanks for a great recipe!

YUM! I added some vanilla yogurt to this to make it more of a smoothie and we all wanted seconds!  Good stuff!  Also, you can substitute "Pina Colada Mix" for the coconut milk and sugar.

I used a whole 14oz can of SWEETENED CREAM COCONUT, one 9.6 oz can of pineapple juice (GOYA in the ethnic isle), a tray of ice cubes and FROZEN pineapple pieces.  It was sheer heaven, enough for 5 of us.  No need for sugar because of the sweetened coconut!

Delicious.  The best pina colada I've ever had.  Because I like things very sweet, I added 1/2 C more pineapple juice, and 1 extra tbs. of sugar.  We also used 1 C coconut rum, and added a lot more ice.  I will definitely make this again and again.

Pretty good! Made this without the rum for my daughter. Scaled this down, added more ice in place of the rum, and also added about 1/2 tsp. of coconut extract for a more coconutty flavor since all I had was a lite coconut milk. She's loving her frosty drink sitting out on the deck as we speak. Thanks!

I've tried this before and it was decent, but just not the best w/ a "wow" factor.

To give it a wow factor I did the following (1 serving):
3oz Coco Lopez Cream of Coconut
3oz FRESH Pineapple juice -meaning, I bought a pineapple, and I extracted the juice 
3/4oz Good quality pineapple rum
3/4oz Good quality coconut rum
1 cup Ice
Pineapple & cherry Garnish

Blend together, garnish w/ pineapple & cherry

I used 1/2 cup cream of coconut, 1/2 cup half&half, 6 oz of pineapple juice, 1/2 rum, and about two trays of ice cubes. This tastes pretty good, though I'll probably do more coconut next time, and less half&half. It makes for a very mild drink. I find mine sweet enough without the sugar, but it tastes pretty darn good. The 8 ice cubes is misleading- I used a tray and a half and made enough for almost three big glasses. Thanks for sharing!

These were awesome.  I made these last night, instead of using the sugar I used splenda.  And we also used a little more rum.  personal preference.  Thanks for the recipe.

Liked this recipe better than some others I tested off the internet.  By other reviewer recommendations, I used cream of coco.  Didn't have pineapple juice onhand so ended up using diced pineapple from can. We really enjoyed this drink!

Bleh!!!  I made these for my Mother's Birthday and was expecting a lot better.  My mom LOVES pina colada's but she couldn't even finish half of her drink.  Not sure why but they didn't taste good.  If you are looking for a good drink check out the Margarita recipe that Katherine submitted.  They are 100% delicious!

Super easy and far better than a mix! Based on the reviews, I used cream of coconut (a 16 oz. can), rather than coconut  milk and a whole can (16 oz.) of pineapple slices with the juice; I also omitted the sugar - which was a very good thing as it was extremely sweet. Overall great recipe! It's very desertish... so I'd suggest adding more ice to compensate. I served it with coconut shrimp and it was very nice.

YUM! These are not like the premade bottled  version, they are much better!! Not very slushy unless you atleast double the ice. I add 1/2 cup more rum and prefer the coconut milk from Thailand....

Easy, easy!  I had left over coconut milk from another recipe, so I used that - I didn't measure but it had to be more then a cup.  Others suggested using pineapple tidbit, I didn't have that - but pineapple chunks, so I tossed the whole can in.  I also used splenda, a little less than called for.  We enjoyed it.  This could be a make ahead recipe.  Blend without the ice and store in the fridge.  When ready to serve blend desired amount with ice.

I used canned pineapple in the blender instead of juice and omitted the sugar and it was amazing! So far the best pina colada that I've made at home. I'll never buy a store mix again. Next time I'll add some strawberries too!

This is a great recipe when you don't have the fresh fruit.  I tripled the ice and added 1/4 C. For my diabetic friends, I used Splenda.

This was my first time making pina colada without the mix.  I used 1 can of coconut milk + 1 can of pineapple tidbits + extra ice to make slushy.  Since these were for the whole family I left out the rum.  I like the fact that it uses natural ingredients- no dairy or corn syrup solids.  Great Recipe!

This drink is amazing! I tried the recommendations to use cream of coconut, and it was perfect. Using the cream of coconut instead of the coconut milk made the drink smooth, rich, and very creamy. Also, I added a bit more rum and far more crushed ice, and it was perfect.

It was my second Piña Colada. The first I had in some bar and it was bland for me. But this colada is rich and delicious. Really good cocktail. I used cream of coconut instead of coconut milk. It is tasty without sugar too.

This was ok. A little runny, and tasted very bland. I added a little orange and cinnamon and it was better.

I just made this recipe with the coconut milk as described.  I think it would be more flavorful and sweeter if made with the cream of coconut instead.
It was pretty good, but I'm not a big pina colada fan.  I think I would have liked it more, blended as a smoothie with vanilla ice cream.

Good base recipe but a little too strong for my tastes. ( I don't drink liquor very much). Next time I will put only 1/4 cup of rum and add some coconut extract.

Nice. I scaled it to half, increased the rum, and used my magic bullet blender. This means I'll have to drink my dinner because the calories are so high, but sometimes it is worth it!

This is super-good! Not too sweet, like pre-made mixes. I also tried with flavored rum (passion fruit)...YUM!

This is a good basic recipe. I used a lot more ice and spiced rum instead of regular and added extra because it was weak.

This was okay, but nothing special.  The drink definitely didn't taste like a true pina colada.  It wasn't quite creamy enough for me.

My husband Love's Pina Coladas and he said this was one of the best. I did use the cream of coconut instead (all I had on hand) and I used coconut rum. It was very good although I will cut the sugar in half next time... may have been the type of rum plus the sugar that made it too sweet for me. I'll also try the dark rum as well.  Overall very tasty and simple to make. I made a double batch and it didn't last long at all.

Try using Goya Creme of Coconut instead of coconut milk and add pineapple chunks and a cherry as a garnish.  If you really want a Caribbean experience use Jamaican overproof rum.

I followed the recipe, but added two single sized vanilla yogurt and about 6 small pieces of frozen pineapple. It's a tiny bit watery and a little sweet, but otherwise, tastes REALLY good. I would say this is the second best PC I've ever had :) Make it! It's good!

So my GF's party was last night and ran well into this morning. I made this version of the Pina Colada and everyone that had one wanted another and another. I used coconut cream instead of coconut milk and I guess that's what sent the flavor through the roof. They were a huge hit!

Tasty!  Remember to ADJUST SUGAR to taste!  I omitted it altogether because I used cream of coconut (sweeter than coconut milk)! And pineapple juice already has a lot of sugar in it! It was still way too sweet, though i know some people who would have no problems with that! Still, it's forgiving. I just added regular, fat-free milk to my serving so that it wouldn't be too sweet.  Next time, I will simply use coconut milk.  Also, if you want a virgin colada, either add more water or just add a bit of rum extract.

It was alright. Very basic. Did add pineapple to mix, made it taste more tropical! The amount of rum was so minimal that it did not even make any difference and I am not a drinker! So if you're looking for a drink mix that has a little more kick, add more rum to your liking. I did originally use this recipe for virgin Pina Coladas and it was excellent for the kids, they loved it! I did not add water to replace the rum, I used the pineapple juice from the canned pineapple. I also added whole milk to cream it up a little bit more. I did use the cream of coconut instead of coconut milk, it had a very good flavor! The amount of ice required in the recipe was not enough to thicken, it was very runny. I guess it's a personal preference, but I liked it thicker and put more ice in it.

I did add more ice cubes and a bit more rum.  This seemed to thicken it.  Delicious! Had juice left from draining a can of pineapple.  This was an excellent recipe for that juice.

I'm sorry, I did not like these at all and i LOVE pina coladas.  If you make as directed, the flavor is okay but the consistency is completely watery and not at all slushy, let alone creamy.  Worst of all, within minutes the whole drink separates, so beware if you care about presentation.  I was able to doctor mine up a bit by blending in fresh pineapple and more ice, but still not great.

It tasted good. However, the coconut milk made it foamy, but I did omit the sugar and maybe that was the problem.

Not that great.  Then tried with Cream of Coconut instead of the milk, then added more and more ice to the blender.  I also tried with the dark Meyers Rum but that just turned it brown.  I guess I'm still looking for that perfect pina colada that I had in at a bar in Roatan, Honduras.  It was creamy and frozen at the same time.  I wish someone could come up with one like that.

I needed to cool off after this killer heat wave coming through! Pina Coladas really hit the spot. I had to add more pineapple juice. And more ice because I like mine blended and ice-e! The rum is a bit strong but think it would be great with a flavored rum, which I didn't use. After the changes, it was great. Not so hot before the changes.

I have tried other recipes for this drink and this one has just the right flavour. I added a little cream and some fresh pineapple and halfed the rum as I'm not that keen on it - probably could have done without any but thats just my opinion.

Yummy!!  I loved this recipe!!  I'm not huge on the taste of alcohol and you could barely taste it in this drink! 
:-) If you like rum though, I would definitely add more.  I also used coconut rum.

Very good- nice flavor, not too sweet.  I used Blue Mountain Country coconut milk- it is very good- nice thick layer of cream....I also used splenda instead of sugar.  Would make again.

Awesome recipe.  Good just the way it is, or if you're like me and like a berry-coloda try adding a TBSP or 2 of strawberry flavored ice-cream topping.  Blend well and enjoy.  I made this for a 'girls weekend' & everyone loved it and we had to go buy more ingredients the next day!  Thanks!

So easy, so good. Just be careful--they sneak up on you! I dipped the rims of the glasses in extra pineapple juice, and then toasted coconut; and it really was a nice touch!

Pretty good for the minimal ingredients listed. It was a little on the bland side for pina colada – prob using pineapple chunks would help a lot. But since I only had coconut milk and pineapple juice in my pantry this was pretty good in a pinch! I did  increase the rum and ice

Very good and exactly what I was looking for this evening. I only had a can of pineapple slices,  no coconut cream, just unsweetened chips -- ground it all up in the Vitamix with some rum, ice, coconut milk and a little vanilla almond milk, about 2 T. sugar and it was very enjoyable.  Not too sweet and very fresh tasting. Topped it with a little crushed coconut chips.

A good basic pina colada recipe.  I did use cream of coconut instead of coconut milk, but I do feel it made it sort of "greasy".  I ended up adding a bit of coconut extract to get the coconut flavor I wanted.

Yum!!  
Yes,  you can use the coconut cream,  but that stuff is full of additives.  We like them a little sweeter so we add little more sugar. Add in a couple tbsp of good quality vanilla ice cream and it's even better!

Excellent. My first time successfully making Pina Colada for my extremely picky grandmother.  Used Coco Lopez and omitted the sugar.  Rounded all the ingredients up...she said it was awesome.

Instead of pineapple juice I used fresh pineapple chunks blended up.  I also added some bananas and strawberries. This was a winner.

Probably not too fair to rate this but.....instead of pineapple juice I had a big bag of pineapple chunks to use so threw it in the blender with the coconut milk, some ice cubes and Cabana Bay coconut/pineapple rum.   it was good stuff!  Better than with pineapple juice - and I did not put sugar in it.

I like this a lot. I did want more of a slushy texture so I used about twice as much ice as called for (just adding more and blending bit by bit till it reached my desired consistency). To help that I added about 1/2 tsp guar gum and 1/4 tsp xanthan gum -- I add a bit of these to all my blended ice beverages to make them incredibly thick and creamy. I can see making this with lite coconut milk if one wanted a lower-calorie option. As is, one can hardly even taste the rum, so add more if you're looking for something stronger.
