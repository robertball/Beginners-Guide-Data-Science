This recipe is quick, easy, and tasty--when fresh.  My only problem is that it doesn't make good leftovers.  After being refrigerated, it is nearly impossible to spoon out of the pan since the cheese hardens when it cools, and it doesn't reheat well, all the cheese sinks to the bottom of the pan leaving oily pasta at the top.  My son loves mac and cheese and I like to make a lot for dinner and reheat it for his lunch the next day, a no-go with this recipe, he won't eat it.  I do continue to use this recipe, but I only make half so as to avoid waste.

This was really quick and good but i did need to add some milk before 2nd microwave and it came out really creamy. I don't buy american cheese so used just cheddar maybe thats why. But i liked it the way it came out

This tasted much better than the store bought brand.  However, it's only good right after you cook it.  After it's cooled down, it doesn't taste great, and it gets oily after reheating.

This tastes like buffet style homemade mac and cheese.  We have been looking for a simple, good recipe and we've tried a few that were not very good.  THIS IS WONDERFUL!

Okay. My husband and I thought it was lumpy and bland, but our 2 yr old absolutely loved it! It was unappetizing after about 20 minutes.

I made this into a single serving, with healthier ingredients, and it came out great!  I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat elbow mac, 1 oz of sliced reduced fat american cheese, 1 oz of reduced fat shredded cheddar cheese, 2 tsp i can't believe it's not butter.  The butter/cheese mixture hardened pretty quickly after microwaving so I kept the stove on low after draining the macaroni and mixed it all together nicely in the hot pan.  I also added a bit of fat free half and half which I didn't measure.  Didn't let stand 10 minutes.  Overall, a good replacement for the boxed stuff!

4 stars because my kids (ages 2 & almost 5) loved it and gobbled it up! And it was easy. I used the general proportions of the recipe but to make much less. Melted everything in a big pyrex measuring cup and just stirred whole grain 3-color macaroni right into the same dish. Husband and I ate the leftovers but just because it was there. I liked it but it was bland.

Sorry just didnt see the point in melting the butter and cheese together.  I would suggest melting the cheese in milk instead and buttering the noodles after they are cooked, before you put the cheese/milk mixture on top.

It definitely requires the right kind of microwave - I ended up with two giant clumps of hardened, congealed cheese.  And after I fixed it up with a package of shredded cheddar which melted quite nicely and made it edible, it did become oily for left overs just like the other reviews had noted.  This recipe was a disaster for me.  Definitely not a keeper.

This recipe would be very good, but only if you could eat it within the first 5 minutes after it is cooked. After that it hardens very quickly I found. My family did not like it at all. It all went wasted.

The cheese did not blend, even after ading milk.  Time and money better spent on either a box or restaurant.

What a mess.  Butter and cheese did not mix together well.  Just a lump of cheese floating in melted butter.

I substituted low carb macaroni because I'm doing Atkins and I found that this recipe worked well because it's so cheesy, it covers up the vague nastiness of the low carb macaroni :)  I used NY sharp cheddar though...and I agree that it congeals after it sits for only 20 minutes or so

Okay my 4 and 2 year olds loved this.  As an adult, it was mac & cheese (better than the box of course).  It would be perfect for an older child to make.  Very easy. Thanks

I wanted to make boxed mac n cheese for an easy lunch for the kids and to my dismay discovered I was all out!  So I quickly searched allrecipes for an quick easy recipe. I had all these ingredients on hand, which was great.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'd rate it a 3 as it but with a couple of simple alterations I'd easily give it a 4 or 4.5!  I added milk during 2nd microwaving, made it much creamer instead of so "gloppy."  Also, I added salt, pepper, & paprika to the cheese mixture, which added a nice flavor.  The kids loved it and I thought it was good too.  I only made half a recipe to be used up right away, since I don't think it would've reheated well.  Although, I don't think there are many mac n cheese recipes that reheat well anyway!  I'll be using this again.

the cheese didn't combine very well with the noodles and butter, and ended up in clumps rather than being creamy.  Perhaps it was my microwave, which is high power, but this just definately is not a keeper.

I was tired when  I got home from work and this was the perfect quick meal.  I didn't have american cheese so I used 2 packages of mild cheddar cheese and it was just right.  In addition, I didn't have to microwave it quite as long - I did 4 minutes and 4 minutes with a 900 watt microwave.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten!!  I've tried many different recipes and this by far is the easiest and the most delicious.  Try it with the Classic 4 shredded cheeses found at your local grocery store. Bon Apetit!!
