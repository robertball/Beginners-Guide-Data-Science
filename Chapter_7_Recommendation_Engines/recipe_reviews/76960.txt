Excellent soup, used chicken broth from a can and added a little more zucchini (had extra in the fridge). Didn't have the fresh parsely so omitted that step. Everyone loved it and even ate all the leftovers. Eager to try the fast chicken soup base next.

Nice hearty, healthy soup. I had the time, so I cooked the Soup Base for 4 hours. I also threw in some extra carrots and celery. Husband liked it, too. Will use this one again.

Fantastic!  This is a great change from the normal broth based tortellini soup I usually make.  The tomatoes are a nice touch.

If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  This soup is so versatile...you can interchange the veggies / leave this or that out / use the Fast Chick Base or just 3 cans low sod broth.  I've even added 1/2 a can of chick peas, a small squash, sauteed onions/celery/garlic, shredded carrot.  I mean, it is really, really good.

Nice little recipe for a cold night. Added a little bit extra in the way of seasonings, red wine, two cans of tomatoes instead of one and dried oregano.

I made this yesterday for a party at my house and it was a hit. I made the "fast chicken soup base" the day before, then the next day I added the other ingredients. I did end up adding extra chicken broth, but it fed at least 8 people with good sized portions. This is an impressive soup; hearty and full of color and flavor.

Loved it! The tortellini is something different from everyday soups. I think I might have added a few more veggies and fresh spices, but it made it even better!

Made this for a little family soup cook-off and it was the hit. The adults and kids loved it! I accidentally bought some chicken tortellini and it was still very good, that was the only change I made. Also, it wasnt as quick as it seemed by reading the recipe, shredding the chicken just takes a long time if you're going for small pieces!

Made this for Valentine Dinner last year and by massive demand it is wanted again. It is not a "fast" recipe, but worth the work.  I used two cans of zucchini for double the recipe,since they are not in season this time of the year. That's about all I changed because it was deeelicious!

Really really delicious. The tomatoes and zuchinni make it taste so summery (well, as summery as chicken soup can taste) and using the fast chicken soup base allows that great flavor without using the stove for hours and hours. I used the dried tortellini and it might have soaked up too much broth, but we like less broth/more stuff in our soups so it was perfect. I might add spinach in the future but the combo of zuchinni and tomatoes is very satisfying, no changes needed for a remarkable soup, thanks for sharing!

This soup was excellent. Honestly, I modified it, but only because I had to use what I had on hand. I used 5 sliced carrots instead of zucchini, 1 onion, 3 celery ribs, and 1 can of petite diced tomatoes. I used 4 cans of low sodium chicken broth and chicken tenders that I baked first with olive oil and oregano. Threw it all in the pot and added a dash of hot pepper sauce, dried parsley, and spinach/cheese tortellinis. Divine. I caught my bf eating it straight out of the pot after he already had seconds. :-)

Very good soup; excellent use of spice. I added some minced garlic to the sautee for the chicken broth and also used two chicken breasts instead of a rotisserie chicken. It's an extremely filling soup!

Sounded semi-bland so added fresh mushroom pieces and half of a small chopped onion from the start. Used a rotisserie chicken precooked, 3 cans of chicken broth and 3/4 can of water for the base. Added black pepper, garlic powder, and Lawry's low sodium seasoning salt instead of table salt. Seasoned with those items to my own preference. Try the recipe as is first and add more seasoning if you enjoy more of a "wow" than "it's okay."

My family really loved this soup.  I followed the Fast Chicken Soup Base recipe to make the broth.  The only change I would make next time is to double the amount of tortellini because they were really popular with my children.

This is my kids favorite variety of chicken soup.  It is so easy and so good.  Warms over great.  I bring the left overs for lunch at work and I always get comments about how good it smells when I warm it up.  The only change I made is that I use cilantro instead of parsley as I prefer the taste.

Soup was fantastic!  Thought about sauteing some garlic and onion to add with the tomatoes and talked myself out of it.  I still wish I had.  Was great with Parmesan cheese and garlic bread.

Delicious. I didn't add chicken and used veggie broth with a veggie cube.

I really like this, however I started with just a huge can of chicken broth as I didn't have time to make the soup base. I had to add more seasonings, but that was to be expected. Next time, I will try the recipe exactly as was intended, but I really like this!

Family loved this! Wanted this soup on a whim so I'm sure if it'd had more time to let the flavors meld it'd just get better and better.  Not a fan of tortellini so omitted them.  Ate them with homemade seasoned crackers and the red pepper flakes on the crackers gave the soup some kick.  While I did adhere to the recipe, I would like to note for others who may be like me and know you can be kind of iffy about basil in recipes, I'd say that next time I'll reduce the basil a bit.  Certainly try the fresh parsley your first time making this, it does brighten and freshen it up.  However I probably wouldn't make special trip to store for it next time I prepare this.

It was excellent. The family enjoyed it immensely. I did add some pepper flakes to give it some kick. I also altered it by adding meat stuffed tortellini.

This was great! I was in a hurry so used low sodium chicken broth. I also added onion, garlic, squash and celery and left the chicken out...the tortellini was filling enough! Added parmesan to the bowl...yummy! Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely awesome! I got rave reviews for this one. I had to add a 16 oz can of chicken broth because there didn't seem to be enough liquid when the soup was all done, and I added a liberal amount of poultry seasoning, as I've found that it makes pretty much any soup with a chicken broth base taste richer and more flavorful. It came out perfectly! Thanks for the great recipe!

ADD ROSEMARY!  I am not sure exactly how much I added - a couple of pinches - but it made all the difference.  I also added a couple of bay leaves.  I used 2 cans of (undrained) diced tomatoes instead of 1 and way more tortellini than the recipe called for.  (I had a 32 oz bag and used nearly all of them)

This was great!!  I agree with another reviewer in that I do not think it was "quick" to prepare.  For anyone else who might have been confused, you need to make the entire chicken base recipe for the tortellini soup and the entire recipes makes A LOT.  Don't get me wrong - the final product is incredible and tastes very good.  There's just a lot of it.  I ended up freezing half of it.  The next time I make this, I think I might make the chicken soup base, divide it into 1/3 packages and freeze 2/3 of the soup.  That way I can adjust the tortellini soup recipe to 1/3 of the chicken soup base and stil have more chicken soup bases to try with other variations.  Someone mentioned a Black Bean Chicken Soup that I would love to try.  All in all - a very good recipe especially on a cold day.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I cooked this for my husbands entire family, due to some bad planning on their part it simmered for over an hour over what was suggested. It still turned out great! My sister-in-law has been begging for the recipe ever since!

I used homemade chicken stock, added carrots, green pepper, crushed tomato, and about 2 1/2 cups cooked chicken and 1 bag of frozen tortellini.  Very good hearty soup.  Next time I might add different veggies or some beans.

I used part of this recipe and it was great. The only thing I did was take a can of low-sodium diced tomatoes, 2 chopped zucchini, a little chicken broth (low-sodium of course) and the classic Italian spices. I brought all of this to a boil then pureed it w/ my hand blender and added a little Romano. Great soup. Thanks for giving me the idea!

This was surprisingly flavorful. I made as directed with 3 changes: I sautéed one onion and minced garlic in the bottom of the pot before the broth. I did not add parsley. I will definitely be making this soup again!

This was a good soup but a bit bland for my taste. My husband and I both added parmesan cheese and chili pepper to our bowls, and then it was delicious! I will make it again, but will spice it up a bit more (and add cheese to my bowl before eating).

I altered the recipe slightly to our liking and added carrots, onions and celery along with the tomatoes instead of the zucchini but I'm sure that would have been wonderful too. I was hesitant about the tomatoes but they a nice comforting, yet refreshing taste to the soup. For the stock I got a lemon/pepper/garlic rotisserie chicken and it complemented the flavors splendidly. I also used dried spinach/cheese tortellini instead of using fresh ones since they didn't have the smaller size and it was great! This is definitely a recipe I will keep on hand for those cold days.

I had some tortellini in the freezer that I wanted to use when I found this recipe, but didn't get the urge to make it until my husband got sick.  It was time consuming but still relatively easy to make and delicious!!  I followed the recipe exactly but left out the celery because I forgot to pick some up at the market.  I've added it to my recipe box and look forward to making it regularly :o)

The only change I made was using cheese ravioli vs tortalini. Wife didn't want me to make again, but my uncle liked it. I thought it was pretty good. It probably would have been better with tortalini, but I doubt I'll make it again. I think using sausage instead of chicken would have been an improvement.

Great recipe - Nice change of pace.  I added carrots and a few fresh tomatoes in addition to the zucchini.  

The reason I am giving it a four is the "soup base".  Homemade soup base is much better and 10 fold healthier.
