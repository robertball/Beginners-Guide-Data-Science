This is a great recipe! To change things up I use tomato, cucumber, red onion, feta cheese and a little italian dressing.

I love this and make it with a can of black beans added to it - drain and rinse the black beans first...

This is a very tasty salad. The first time I made it I thought it was missing something. The second time I added feta cheese and that made the salad for me!

Cucumber Tomato Red Onion Salad Haiku: "Lovely as written! Cool, colorful, and easy. Lots can be added." Great recipe for a summertime BBQ side dish. Definitely letting it chill in the fridge for several hrs. b4 serving makes it all the better. I've made this many times now, occasionally adding a little EVOO, balsamic vinegar, roasted corn, cumin, black beans -- really, as a base, it's fantastic, but it's equally fun and delicious to make by jazzing it up w/ other goodies.

Very, very good. I added just a dollop of my No-Guilt Zesty Ranch Dip for a little creaminess. I don't want to share it's so good!

Very simple and refreshing recipe. I made it as a side for homemade falafel & pork souvlaki. We like our food spicy so this was perfect! Made exactly as written except used sea salt. Will definitely make again.

I suppose it was ok, if all you want is some cut up cucumbers, tomatoes with some lime juice on your plate.  I ended up adding mayo, lemon pepper an parmesan cheese to it to make it more like an actual salad, rathan than just a pile of cut up veggies.  I would give it more stars with my additions, but as the recipe is written, only 2 stars.  Its really not much of a recipe.

I make this simple quick salad all the time. Fresh lime is a the key and let it sit refrigerated for at least thirty minutes for the lime to bring out the fresh flavor of all the vegetables. So healthy with no salad dressing.

This turned out good especially for hot summer days. I fill like it needed a little something extra. It tasted like exactly the ingredients so I don't know why I expected more. I liked the recipe because it wasn't soaked in a dressing mixture but now I feel like it need some sort of lite dressing or maybe more seasonings.

DELICIOUS!  I added black beans as others suggested and also some goat cheese and it was SUPERB. I would definitely put in the beans if you have them- it made the salad!

Made it exactly as directed, but cut up the pieces into "salsa-sized" so I could eat it as a dip rather than salad. Very good that day, much better the next day. Next time I will add a fair amount of crushed garlic. I think that will make it 5 stars.

Very light and refreshing. It would be wonderful as an accompaniment to a spicy dish. I ate it on it's own and thought it could use a little spice.

We make a salad like this using tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, black olives and creamy caesar dressing.  It is a delicious side dish with chicken.  Or try it on a grilled cheeseburger instead of mayo, lettuce and tomato.  It's great!

Tomatoes and cucumbers are in abundance here in Japane and have come to love making this salad several times a week.  If I serve it to guests they always compliment on how fresh it tastes.  Wonderful recipe.

It's about 100 degrees here today, and this is exactly what I want to eat on a day like today.  So cool and refreshing!  I did add the feta as I served it in the bowl as our son doesn't care for it.  Added a few tblspns. of EVOO and just a splash of vinegar but did not have lime.  Might add a bit more vinegar.  It gets better as it sits in the fridge!

Word to the wise: if you don't like red onions, DON'T use them! I thought I might like this recipe since I love cucumbers and tomatoes but the onions were overpowering. I didn't have cilantro and it might have made a difference. Add extra lime juice!

This was okay.  I am used to using a vinegar base with cucumbers so the lime was just okay.  I did not have any red onion so I used regular white onion.

This is a nice, light & refreshing salad. I followed the recipe as written, and I didn't seem to taste any of the lime. Next time I will use the juice of 2 or maybe 3 limes. This salad would compliment grilled meats, chicken or fish very well, along with the other sides in a meal. This adds a nice touch to the plate, and it's fat free too! A splash of balsamic or red wine vinegar would be great also. Thanks (:

So simple and crazy good as-is! Great way to use summer farm stand fresh vegetables. Fun to customize too.

Absolutely delicious and refreshing! I am not a fan of raw tomatoes but had all of these ingredients on hand. I used juice of 2 limes, added a couple TB of Italian vinaigrette and feta.

I've been making this salad for I long as I remember, although I've used lemon instead of lime. Another dressing variation is to add a splash of olive oil mixed with some garlic powder (to taste).

My husband made this for us with our veggies from the garden. He added a splash of balsamic vinegar & toasted sesame seeds! I'm addicted to it, by itself it is wonderful. On top of a plate of greens to make a fresh green salad is great, too (i use baby spinach). The juices combined with the vinegar make a delicious light dressing and it is so quick to put together! Thanks!

This was awesome! I was out of red onion, so I used white. Tasted fine, but would have been prettier with the red. I also diced all my veggies into uniform pieces, just because it's easier to eat that way. This was a great salad to have on a warm day - but definitely tastes tons better after it has sat over night or even two nights. Yum!

This was great use of our summer CSA veggies! I made it exactly according to the recipe to start with. It did seem just a bit tame, so I added some red pepper flake… Shook a little like on pizza, toss, do it again, toss… Perfect!

I made it and liked it. I never make a recipe exactly as it is written. I added feta, basil (because that was the fresh herb that I had)instead of cilantro, lemon instead of lime to go with the basil, and a bit of Italian Dressing. I sat it in the fridge for 30 minutes.

2.19.18  So very simple, you really don't need a recipe for this.  I did add a couple good cranks of freshly-ground pepper.  You'll never go wrong with ingredients like this, and that lime juice just totally brightens the flavor and puts this quick and easy  salad over the top!

My favorite east Indian restaurant makes this and I finally found the recipe on-line. I made this for dinner last night to accompany Butter Chicken and it was delicious! I didn't have red onion on hand so I used green onions and we still enjoyed it.

Light and delicious on a hot summer day!  I love pretty, colorful dishes, so I used Cherubs and Sunbursts (small yellow tomatoes). After peeling the cucumber, I scored lengthwise with a fork then cut lengthwise 4 times to slice quarters. Be sure to rip, not chop, the cilantro to preserve the beautiful leaves. And, I am a Spice Girl, so I added a variety of spices to my taste.  Served in a glass bowl to show it off and it was a hit! I look forward to making it again as I want to experiment with variations.  Thanks!
