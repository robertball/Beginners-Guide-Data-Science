Pork and orange flavors are lovely together.  I used orange juice because I had no tangerines and I replaced the orange zest with Simple and Crisp orange slices.  This went together so quickly  and looks lovely and tastes even better.  This would impress even the fussiest guest.  Thank you, Cheereeo!

Walmart grocery delivery replaced the Marsala wine with sherry, so I was stuck using that.  Iâ€™m sure it would have been much better with Marsala.  But it was still very good.

This is definitely a keeper. We used sliced pork tenderloin and red wine in place of the marsala. Came out quite good.

These were absolutely delicious and elegant! I was a little shy of required OJ so added a lite extra marshal. Will do again often.

This is a great way to prepare pork chops.  Don't be afraid to substitute orange juice for tangerine.  The Marsala wine is a must though and you can use it in other dishes.
