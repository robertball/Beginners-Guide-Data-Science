I used this recipe and it came out just as I  wanted it.  I love it and it is just like the Christmas cake my mother bakes in Jamaica. I live in the U.K. now and I have search the internet looking for a good recipe and Sharon's is the best of them all.  Although I had the fruit blended instead of having them in as they were just soaked and I have also added 1/2 bottle of red label wine, 1/2 bottle of Grace Browning and even 1/2 cup more of white rum to my cake. While baking I placed a baking tray with water below to ensure my cake remain soft.

I'm really disappointed at this recipe.  After I spent time and money, it turned out to be something completely different from what I was expecting.  I ended up with so much batter, I filled up the two 9-inch round cake pans the recipe asks for, plus one 9x13 rectangular pan!!  When I put the cake pans in the oven, the batter started to rise nicely, but it suddently flattened, and I didn't open the oven door or did something to make it flatten.  The taste is not bad, but I couldn't taste the wine or rum at all.  I don't know if I did something wrong, but I read the instructions very carefully to make sure I was doing everything right.  This fruitcake turned out to be a pain in the neck.

Ok, this got 2 stars but only because the flavor is really good.  This was a really difficult recipe, partly because the directions don't seem very clear.  Specifically, the wine.  If you soak the fruit in wine as suggested in the tips in small print on the bottom, are you supposed to use the 2 cups that is listed in the recipe ingredients?  Or is that 2 cups in addition to whatever the soaking takes?  Same with the rum.  I assumed, maybe incorrectly, that it was in addition to what was used in soaking.  It did seem a little wet.  But maybe it was supposed to...  And as far as cooking time goes, I inserted a knife in and it came out clean.  Unfortunately after trying to get it out of the pan I discovered that it was cooked on the top, actually starting to get a little darker than I like, and still gooey toward the bottom and very dark on the very bottom.  The cooked part must have been scraping off the gooey part as I was removing the knife.  So, I have a very good tasting but gooey mess that will be eaten by my immediate family (who are used to being guinea pigs) instead of something special I had wanted to take to a family dinner tonight.  Fortunately there's still time to go to the store for something else.  Some additional direction clarification by those who have been successful with this recipe would be helpful.  I'd try it again if such help were available since as I said, the taste even of the goo was very good.

this came out great! my mother always told me about how she used to make her jamaican rum cakes with her mother. and after so many years we finally made one. the batter was a little bit to watery so we added more flower. but other than that this recipe was the best!! and we werent sure if we were supposed to add more red wine or if it was the wine used to soak tje fruits so we didnt add more and it turned out fine.

definately will make again.

I tried this last year, but I made sure I read all of the reviews first.  My cakes came out beautifully, but I had to make some changes.  First of all you must add more flour to this recipe, use your own judgment based on the consistency of the batter. Next, if you like it dark, then use more browning sauce.  With regard to the rum/wine/brandy, like another reviewer said, I only put what I drink, so I soaked my fruits for a week, then boiled them on the stove for about an hour over medium low heat.  I soaked them in Jamaican Appleton Brown Rum. That was fun! The most important thing I had to change for this recipe was the baking temperature.  This has to bake slowly, I turned my oven down to 250-275 for almost 1.5 hours. It is not going to rise much, if at all, but thats how a real rum fruitcake is.  Once you take the cakes out, pour more rum, wine, etc over them for that great moist taste.  I am getting ready to make my batch for this year, my husband keeps reminding me, he loves this cake and can't wait!

Like some of the other reviewers, I thought this recipe was a little vague.  I soaked the fruit for several weeks in the wine and didn't add anymore wine to the batter.  The cakes baked beautifully and smelled divine.  Unfortunately, I gave both of them away as presents!  I didn't even get a taste.  I got great comments from the receivers, so I will definitely try it again.  I used a mix of a lot of dried fruits.

This was a great-tasting Jamaican black fruit cake recipe! I have made this twice and both times it was well received. I would like to add some clarifying notes for those who found the instructions vague.

1. The 2 cups of wine that the recipe calls for is what is used to soak the fruit in advance; Do not add another 2 cups of wine when baking or you will have way too much liquid.

2. I soaked my dried fruit (currants, raisins, cranberries, cherries and glazed rinds) in favourite concord wine, white rum, and red label wine for 3 weeks on the kitchen counter. When I was ready to bake, I threw in some canned cherries that I had nothing else to do with and pureed it all in the food processor so that my finished cake would have a homogeneous texture (I don't like chewing fruit pieces in my fruit cake).

3. I added 1-2 tbsp of gravy browning to the batter to make the cake darker.

3. This cake is VERY dense in both calories and texture, kind of like bread pudding. It is not meant to be a fluffy light cake.

4. I baked mine in muffin tins and ramekins to have individual-sized portions. The cake does not puff up like muffins do; mine remained flat and shaped like hockey pucks (see my picture). 

5. I used the low-and-slow baking technique and put them in at 250F for 90-120 minutes. I also put in a small pan of boiling water on the bottom rack to keep it moist. 

I added a picture to show what mine looked like; sorry for the lack of presentation; was in a rush :)

THIS IS THE BEST! Well atleast that is the reviews I have gotten since Christmas. I had never attempted a fruitcake before and this year did it to surprise my husband who is also a Chef. He LOVES it as did my Dad who normally only eats my Grandmother's. Unlike most fruit cakes...this one is rich and moist, using the real dried fruit (which I soaked for a week in the fridge with 2 cups red wine) sets it  above all others! If you want to make an award winning (well atleast in our family) fruitcake, then this is the one!

I have used this recipe several times now with success. Tips to add are ensuring butter & sugar are creamed properly & I add an extra egg. I use dark sugar rather than white & use molasses and gravy browning to get a darker colour. An extra half cup of flour ensures my spoon stands up in the mixture and I alternate adding blended fruit and flour, a 1/3rd at a time. Mix well but don't over mix. A large pan of water in the bottom of the oven helps moisture & getting an even oven temperature which stops the cake from splitting on top. Oven shouldn't be too hot, I reduce the temperature by 50 degrees & bake for extra 20mins. Don't be tempted to open the oven door before it's at least half cooked. Doesn't rise much so can fill the pan to 3/4. I make in advance & baste the cake with a mix of rum & Red Label wine. Excellent recipe!

Baking is my hobby but I have never baked a fruit cake simply because it is so tedious! However, I decided to give it a go last Christmas. This is a very simple receipe yet came out tasting full-bodied. I too had a few questions along the way so I modify it. So for those of you who like to try, I hope my notes are helpful. 1) I only soak the fruits for 2 days. I used half store bought fruit mix and half of whatever dried fruits I have. They are cranberry, prunes and dates. The fruits totally absorbed the wine so I had no more liquid when I add to the cake. I read somewhere to go easy on the prunes, so note to self for next round. Use some extra flour, not too much, to coat the fruit before adding. This is to prevent it from sinking to the bottom of the pan. Don't be obsessed with it though, the fruits will still be quite sticky. 2) When adding the eggs, add in one at the time. Beat till combine then add the next one. 3) I add more rum than stated and some wine, it really gives the cake a nice kick. 3) I lined the pan with foil. Again I read somewhere that it helps to keep the edge soft and not hard. 4) Someone told me to bake it "bain marie" meaning to set the pan on a bigger pan filled with water to keep it moist. However, this make the cake more like pudding so it was more sticky. Overall, the cake got pretty good reviews and my husband love it. I will defintely try again and this time I will just baked it as usual. Thanks Sharon for such a simple yet wonderful receipe.

This is a keeper. Not so dark as one might think. Maybe because I used golden raisins. I also used C'raisins by Ocean Spray.
Also, because I believe that you should only cook with what you drink, I used cognac, blackberry liqueur, port wine and white rum - no cheap stuff :). Hence I'll only make it once a year.
My husband declared it the best fruit cake he's ever had - and we have some professional bakers in the family (of which I'm not one).
It didn't come out as perfectly as I'd hoped, but I think that comes with my inexperience.
Definitely give it a try!

I've used this recipe a couple times now and changed some things to have the perfect mixture for me.  First off there is a technique to mixing this cake.  Like the directions, mix butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time - adding each yoke to the butter and sugar mixture until rubbed in and keeping the white in a separate bowl.  Add 2-3 tablespoons rum and a teaspoon of rosé water to the egg whites.  Use a beater or mixer to beat the white until it creates a good amount of thick fluff.  Add enough of the egg white fluff to the batter until it starts breaking up.  When ths happens add enough flour fold the flour in - make the figure 8 with your mixing spoon)  to bring it back together,  keep doing this until all the egg white and flour are gone.  Now add the molasses or browning to mixture and mixed spice (nutmeg & cinnamon) and mix well.  To this I now add my fruits (I only use raisins) which are puréed in wine.  Grease your baking pans and dust with flour, bake at 250 degrees for 1hr- 1hr:10 minutes.  Please note I use a hand mixer to mix everything before the flour.  After this I use a wooden spoon to fold the flour in and for the remainder of the mixture.

Definitely one of the best, if not the best Christmas cake recipes. I'm actually eating a large slice of the cake now and it's delicious. They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach; I'd recommend this to single women looking for a husband. :-)

This is such a WOW cake! My fiancé's from Westmoreland, Jamaica...and this recipe is the closest (95% to the real Jamaican thing) and the BEST he's ever tasted ever since he's been in Canada. I'm so glad I found it! Plus everyone who had a taste of this cake couldn't get enough of it. I had to make it 2 more times by request the 1st time I tried it. Also, it is very simple to make...just follow the directions with the right ingredients, nothing more and nothing less...et voilà!!! Bon appétit!! And thank you Sharon!

I used this recipe yesterday, and I must say that it didn't disappoint. I have made several attempts in the past with poor results. It didn't help the situation when my wife who is Jamaican had to taste my failed attempts. Haha!!! she tasted this recipe and all I can say is that when I saw that smile on her face and her keep going back for more, her actions spoke in volume. I will agree with a few past submits that you should place a pan with water underneath the cake pans to keep it them moist. Next time I will bake the cakes with grease paper lined pans to keep the edges moist. I will also add a bit more alcohol to the recipe maybe pouring a 1 cup of wine on each cake immediately after removing them from the oven. I have seen my Grandmother- in-law do that in the past when she made the cakes for my wedding. This is a winner enjoy!!!!

I've made this 3 times now and I can clear up some of the questions everyone is having so that it will turn out well and be delicious! Don't add any more wine than the 2 cups -she only means the wine that is left over in the fruit. I've never added the rum so if you do you may need a little more flour.  My Jamaican boyfriend's mom told me that the batter should be thick -stick a wooden spoon into it and it should stay standing (otherwise add more flour).
The second time I made it (of course the time I served it to my boyfriend's mom), I totally didn't bake it long enough but the toothpick had come out clean.  Here's a better test: touch the top of the cake and it should bounce back when it's done.
Good luck and enjoy.

I've used these recipe several times. I was honored to be able to prepare it for my grandmothers funeral as this was one of her signature desserts. I felt so proud to be able to prepare it with her soaked fruits and getting props from all the elder Jamaican family members and loved ones that been baking from childhood. This is a great recipe with a little altering here and there to suit your desire I am well pleased. I also roll out a thin sheet of almond paste after soaking the cake and cover it with it then apply royal icing just like in the islands. 

-I prepare this cake with joy in my heart and a smile in my face :-)

I tried this recipe for the first time this xmas. I began soaking the fruits about a month prior to xmas. Be sure to seal it with plastic seal if you are soaking the fruits to keep the flavour in the fruit. (I had sealed one set of fruits with foil paper and they lost some flavour, the one sealed by plastic wrap didnt.) I followed some of the reviews and added 1/2 cup of flour to the recipe and 1/2 cup of rum, also 1/4 bottle of Grace browning. I loved the cake! When I first tried it, it seemed on the bland side. I poured Red Label Wine on the cake, and a little everyday after that and the flavour of the cake came right out. Next time, I will try brushing some wine on while its baking as one of the other reviewers had said. The consistency was perfect, the colour was perfect (a nice dark brown colour), and relatives LOVED the cake (I had drizzled wine on it before serving). I used Red Label wine as some Jamaicans swear by it. I didnt add the 2 cups of wine to the recipe other than what the fruits were soaking in as they were soaking in a lot of wine and I had recently added more to the soaking fruits (two days before). Im not sure if that is the reason why it was a little bland at first but as I said, drizzling wine on the cake after baking, made a big difference. Also, I cooked the cake in another pan that had a little water in it to keep the cake moist. In future, I will add 3/4 cups rum instead of 1/2 cup rum to the original recipe as I could only taste a trace of rum.

I have just made this "cake" after much anticipation. I was really looking forward to a good-tasting fruit cake; however, what came out of the oven was a tasteless, greasy imitation of a cake. The molasses flavour overpowers everything else and it does not have the consistency of "cake" at all. I am soooo disappointed its not even funny. I have a recipe for christmas pudding that I normally follow but I am tired of it and thought I would try this one. Never again...a total waste of time and energy to bake!!

Love this recipe! I've used this recipe 3 times. I used a lot more fruit peels than dried fruit. Added a bit more molasses and rum. And I've blessed the finished cake by brushing extra rum.

I tried this recipe Dec' 2010 and shared w/ friends of mine who are Jamaican (I am not, but my stepparent is). I thought it came out well. My friend's father from Jamaican agreed it was pretty good, but he said not to add orange peel (Jamaican fruit cake doesn't use orange peel, but I buy the mixed candied fruit to save money). He also said to use Jamaican rum. I am not a rum drinker so I am can't really appreciating the differences in taste between, Jamaican, Virgin Island or Puerto Rican rum.  I thought it was pretty good though I am not a big fruit cake lover. I do it in memory of my mother (she mad a fantastic fruitcake). I am trying it again this year in about a week. My stepfather who is Jamaican, also said I should have started soaking the fruit no later than the summer. I'll try to remember that next summer but really, who is thinking about fruit cake in July:)

I made this cake for the first time over the weekend.  I have had to always buy my fruit cake so I decided to try it out.  It delicious and moist I used the idea from a member to put a pan of water at the bottom of the oven.  I was really  moist.  I did not add any more rum to the mixture.  A note is put it in the pan as the receipe says the abtter won't rise much so you won't end up with four flat cake (:) cakes as i did.  I will do it again today as all mine was eaten by the family.  These one as christmas presents.

This is a fruit cake that will never be re-gifted or passed on from year-to-year.  It will be devoured and leave your family begging for more!  It is dense with real fruit, not that candied, artifically colored yuck that is in more traditional fruit cakes.  You must take the time to really soak the fruit.  My girlfriend from the Caribbean soaks hers for two months before baking the cake, and uses any liquor and combination of dried fruit she has on hand, so be creative!  This is now a holiday MUST in our family.

I've made this recipe two years in a row now, and I am pretty happy with it.  Note that I macerate the dried fruit in the wine, and do not add any additional wine when I make the batter.  Also, I bake at a much lower temperature (~275).  I suggest a drier wine or more acidic fruit.  I made mine with dates, raisins, prunes, and a few cranberries, and it really would have benefited from less prunes and more cranberries.

This recipe was very easy to follow and the final result was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS my family and friends keep asking for more. I just added some browning as I like my cake to very dark and I used raisins that had been soaking in wine and rum for months.

Don't believe the other reviews. They must all be adjusting the recipe to make it work. So if you're good at improvising, try it. Otherwise forget it! I just made it. It's burned -- 350 F for 1.5 hours is too long. Its flavor isn't all that great -- I've had real caribbean fruit cake made by a  woman from Guyana that tasted much better.  And it's not even dark -- mine is a golden blonde color. It looks like a sponge cake with dried fruit.

The best "wine cake" I've ever eaten using this recipe- and I bake this every year.  I made it for Christmas and everyone loved it.  I even saved one pan of cake for New Year's (just soaked with wine and cover it) in the refrigerator and it was wonderful.  Many thanks, Sharon

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving Dinner 2014 and it was awesome. I am a traditional Jamaican and found the recipe quite close to the tasty island treat we know. A couple of deviations; use a fourth less butter and a same portion change for the sugar.  It could also take a few more drops of rum as the cake tasted "egg like" a day after it was done.  It was a bit oily when baked, and the "cake tester" was quite greasy after testing the cake for readiness.  Overall, the recipe is good but remember to put less butter, less sugar, more rum.  Also, I used brown sugar instead of the white granulated sugar.

Good Luck as you try this recipe.  Kaye.

I made it and it came out perfectly. The only thing I will change when I make it again is to blend the fruits a little. The prep time was more than 20mins for me but overall it is a thumbs up.

Best best Recipe ever...
i make this using a serving for 15....i also blended the fruit mix as i dont really like  whole fruit pieces in cake
i then  soaked fruit over night in mulled red wine, i then boiled and simmered it in in the morning for a couple of hours.

i couldn't find molasses so i used dark treacle instead...
the cake isnt dark/black as such, but it did go very very dark brown...

i sprinkled wine rum about 60 minutes onto the cake whilst it was baking..

the cake was moist, fruity, you cud taste the fruit in the wine, the rum....

perfect! this is a keeper for me and i feel great that i can make this cake with such success!

I presented my family with this delicious rum cake on Christmas Day. Suffice it to say that my family "tore it up!!"  This is my 2nd time time making a rum cake.  The only problem I experienced, was that the 2 - 9 inch pan called for the recipe was not big enough.  I had to use a 13x9" and a 10" pan to hold all the batter.

I make my cake from this recipe for the first time at christmas 2008 and we enjoyed it very  much. But, I had my fruit soaking in wine for a few months. I crushed the fruit instead of using it whole. I used brandy instead of white rum (I did not have any). I put more colouring in to get a darker effect I also put more brandy than recommemded.   It was very very nice. I am going to make it again and I have recommended to all my family and friends

This is a great recipe. But...it needs 5 cups of flour, not 2 1/2. I use 3 white and 2 whole wheat. I use l pound of delux glace fruit mix and 1 1/2 lbs. of raisins. I soak the fruit in 3 cups of dry red wine. Now...all fruit cake needs nuts!I use 8 0z. each of almonds and pecans...chopped.

This is without a doubt the best fruit cake I have ever eaten - even better than my Mom's. I used Merlot to soak the fruit and added a bit more wine at cooking time( the batter seemed a bit dry )It turned out real moist and nice crunchy fruit - give it a try - you will love it!!!!

I have been baking this cake for years. Most time i used 1 cup of butter instead of 2. I still added the 2 cups of wine to the batter. For the soak/boiled fruits i blend half of the amount then combine it with the unblend portions. I also tried it without sugar by just creaming 1 1/2 cup butter (the yellow pk stick margerine) and added the eggs 1 by 1 and it was still a hit. I make a variation of batches followed the same instructions given. I also didn't put any pan with water in the oven for it to boil...and the cake still came out moist. 1 batch i baked the recipe as is, another with the reduce butter, and 1 with no sugar. I am from a large family so I normally make up to 5 batches. Again this cake is loved by everyone(family, friends and co-workers). A big THANK YOU Sharon for this amazing  recipe!!!! :-)

Suprisingly Good!!! So after looking at many different jamaican fruit cake recipe I finally decided to go with this one as it had the most positive review and i must say I am VERY impressed!
As other reviews suggested I added about an extra 3/4 cup of Flour and the cake come out perfectly, moist with a good crumb. Baked it in a 23cm/9inch tin and still had some mixture to spare. Baked in the oven for 1hr 20mins on 160c then turned down to 140 half way through. I didnt coat the cake with rum after as i love the crisp crust of the cake together with the moist inside..ahh its just delighful! Give it a try! thanks Sharon!!!

I made this over the Thanksgiving Holiday just to try.  The cake was alright, nothing to jump over the moon for.  I'll stick to purchasing this cake from friends in another city.  And I'll just bake what I bake best.....Red Velvet & Coconut Cakes!

This was my first fruit cake and turned out great.  I did soak the fruit in the red wine for 1 week and added 1/4 cup "spiced rum".  Only problem was that I needed to use 3 pans not 2 and reduced cooking time to 1 hour.  Delicious!

I've been using this recipe for about 6 years! And it brings back memories of home. I'm a Jamaican and I used to help my aunts bake so I do know what it's supposed to taste like. This recipe is definitely on point!  My family is always so impressed with my baking skills, but it's really not me, it's Sharon's!! Love love love the finished product! Year after year!

* I blend my fruits in the red label wine, then bring to a boil and have it sit overnight. No need to soak the fruits for months! * I used browning instead of molasses. I had a pan of water under the batter while baking so that the cake comes out moist. After taking the cake out of the oven, I poured a cup of wine over it to keep it moist.

This recipe was a good place to start but i made some changes. I added another half cup of wine and one cup of over proof rum (also brushed the tops with rum after cooling). for the fruits i used cherries, raisins, currants, prunes, and mixed citrus peel soaked in the wine and rum for 3 weeks and finely pureed. I also added 3 tbsp browning  for color. I would highly recommend baking in a water bath to keep your cake very moist.

I had to sign up to rate/discuss this cake.  I'm Jamaican and this cake is 'close' to what I remember. I've been making this cake for 2 years now...I agree the directions aren't clear but it's a good start.  Here's  what I do:
Butter must be at room temp, leave on counter night before or morning when you plan to bake. Eggs must also be at room temp.
I soak the fruits & 1 bottle of (any) red wine for 1 year--yep, 1 year--no joke! this is the traditional method.  I always make sure that my fruits are covered in liquid, so I will add wine/rum throughout the year.  I store it in my dark cupboard, not the fridge.  It is a X-mas cake. I blend or use a food processor to puree the fruit to smooth consistency. I used 3 sticks of butter (I will try 2 sticks for 2016).
I don't use the zest of lime, or lime juice. I start soaking the fruits & wine the same day/night for the next year once I start baking.  The longer this cake sits the better.  I bake it & plan to serve it week(s) later. Each day, for a week or so I add tablespoon(s) of white rum to cake-depending on size. This cake rises while baking but falls as it cools, so I overfill pans on purpose.  You want a dark, dense and super moist cake. As the cake cools, they become denser or not as fragile.  It is a ton of batter, so have pans ready! From this batter I got 2 regular size loaf pans, 1-10in spring form pan and 1 mini loaf---it's all never enough since I mail cakes to my sisters.  If you can be patient try soaking fruits etc f

I agree with the other reviewer that it needs more flour. Could it be a typo? I think it should use 5 cups of flour for the recipe to work. I was disappointed with the result as mine came out too wet. Itrose up & ended up flat. I feel I have wasted time and  money trying this out.....    The batter was way too much for 2, 9" pans.

A most righteous fruit cake!!....coming from a staunch fruit cake hater. ... and kitchen challenged individual. Some minor details.  Prep time is about an hour, cook time , using  4  or 5 ( depending on how much you put in) nonstick aluminum pans is about  35 minutes. Just follow your nose and check when you start smelling those delicious aromas!  LIOVE LOVE LIVE THUS CAKE!!

This is by far one of the best recipes I’ve ever tried on this website! This Jamaican black rum cake taste exactly like my moms and Grandmother’s! I am so glad that I found this, this is probably going on the 60th Cake I’ve made. I now make them for my friends and family every Thanksgiving and Christmas I make between 15 to 20 Cakes each year using this recipe. I don’t tweak it, I don’t substitute anything, I make it exactly how Sharon says and it comes out remarkably amazing. I do soak my fruits one year at a time, so the fruits I use this year, I will go back and purchase more dried fruits, raisins, prunes, currents and port wine. And have them soaking to get ready for next year‘s batch of Jamaican rum cakes.

Excellent flavor!  For those who want a more pudding-like texture, just put a foil tin of water at the bottom of the oven.  I'm no professional, but this cake always gets raving reviews when I make it!

This is such a great cake. I tend to make  1 fir work colleagues and one for my family. The first time I made it was Christmas 2014. I soaked the fruits in A mixture of Appletons dark rum , white rum and any red wine usually a Malbec or Shiraz. .  Last year I soaked the fruit for a good 2 months. And I'm not joking when I say you could get drunk on the smell. :) I also blended half the fruit last year. I don't use white sugar but soft brown or soft dark sugar. The cake went down extremely well with my work colleagues. Brought them a little Caribbean sunshine. The cake disappeared within hours as others not in my team  came sniffing. I actually think the reason they enjoyed it so much was the alcohol content. 
This year, I totally forgot to put my fruit aside to soak. So my cakes only had 3 day soaked fruit. 
My method has a few differences to the original. 
Still use the 2 X 9" tins. They are 3 inches deep and good solid tins. I found cheap cake tins produce inferior cakes 
My oven is set at 165 degrees centigrade. 175 burns the outsides of my cake and not cook the centre. 
At 165 my cakes cook perfectly in an hour and 20 minutes. 
Results this  year , for me not as tasty (strong) as last years, however some of my work colleagues preferred it. Saying they didn't have to worry about the police pulling them over. Cheek!
I've since made 2 more cakes which I'll be giving away to friends. 
Great cake and easy recipe to follow.

I think it's a good recipe, but something is missing. I thought it needed more spices and more rum.  Came out with a cake-like texture, not too heavy. Next time I will add more allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon, more rum, less wine and maybe one less egg. Will brush more with rum after baking is done. Will update review if results are better next time. Soaking dried fruit is a must, as least one month - or more- so plan ahead

I have been using this recipe for years.  I add some extra flavorings and always get great reviews from everyone that is fortunate enough to get a sample.

The best fruitcake recipe bar none. I soaked the dried fruits in wine for three days and puréed it before adding the dry ingredients.

Completely burnt around the edges and gooey in the middle. It didn't rise at all, and in fact looks like it fell.

I have made this cake twice for a friend that is from Jamaica. He provided the soaked fruits for the cake.   Although I have never actually tried it myself, he assures me that it is amazing.

This is a great cake. No added wine but i did soak for two days in rum/wine mixture. SInce the red wine this cake usually uses is a pretty sweet wine, it stand more sugar is your using a dry wine. I wish i added a half cup more sugar though. Still a good cake.

This recipe is definitely the one! This will be my go to recipe from now on. It is the best fruit cake I have tasted and my husband who is quick to remind anyone that my mother-in-law's fruit cake is the best was more than impressed and asked if I planned on making another one soon-which says a lot on his part. It was moist, with great texture and extremely tasty. I took the suggestion of another reviewer who separated the yolks from the whites and then folded in the whites later on and I also just used raisins instead of mixed fruits.  I chopped the raisins in a food processor and soaked them in wine at least 48 hours before baking.  I used this wine in which the raisins were soaking for the 2 cups required in the recipe.  I highly recommend this recipe because it is the best fruit or black cake as we Caribbean folks refer to it as that I have tasted.  Thanks Sharon!!!

I am jamaican, and I must say that this is a very hard cake to make. the recipe is simple,but you have to get the right color consistancy and bake very slowly for it to come out perfect. for years I have been hesitant to make it. this will be my 1st year. I will write back and tell you how my attempt turned out.

This was my first attempt at making a Jamaican Fruit Cake, and while it didn't rise as much as i had hoped, it tasted absolutely great.  I shall continue to use this recipe with a little tweak here and there.  Thanks Sharon.
