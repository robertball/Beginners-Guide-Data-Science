Made two variations of this, and the one without the Bacardi 151 was considerably better (I used Don Q Cristal in place of it). 151 has a strange, wet towel flavor that dominated the whole drink. 

I looked this up after having a Rum Punch at a Jamaican restaurant. They used Wray & Nephew overproof rum, which I didn't have but most likely would have worked better.

I made a double batch, and it was a huge hit at my party. I used pretty good rums, which I'm sure helped: Vizcaya Cristal, 7 year Flor de Ca√±a, and Blue Chair Bay coconut rum. I also used fresh lime juice and added a splash of orange bitters.

Additionally, I made a smaller batch using club soda in place of the rum for the non-drinkers. It was obviously less exciting, but still a pretty decent fruit punch.

Just whipped up a batch and it was oh so yummy. Only difference is I added 1/2 cup of coconut rum not 1/4 cup. I also used cheaper rum to cut costs but it still tastes great. Husband and I are satisfied with this recipe!

Yumo! Made exactly except subbed regular Bacardi for 151. Real hit for a day on the lake.

So good! Made me feel like I was right back on the beach in Negril. I took the advice of other reviewers and used regular white rum in place of the 151....but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I even made a rum free batch for the kids and they loved it! Perfect paired with jerk marinated chicken and Caribbean rice & beans. Will definitely be making again!

This recipe is a great foundation! Made it for a party, tweaked it a bit by adding a can of fruit punch. It was a party favorite! Will definitely be making it again!
