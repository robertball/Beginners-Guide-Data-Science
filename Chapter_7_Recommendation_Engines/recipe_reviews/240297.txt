Was taught this recipe by the poster and can attest to how quick, easy and delicious it is. Instant favorite of the kids and there are never leftovers. I was skeptical of adding the preserves but is a perfect complement to the sausage!!!

I haven't made this exact recipe but a friend made peach spaghetti and this is no accident, it's an act of God! I can't explain it but the tomato and peach are like they were soul mates, an arranged marriage. The flavor is unreal and as soon as I beat the recipe it of her I'll post it. JK Try it, you'll like it!
