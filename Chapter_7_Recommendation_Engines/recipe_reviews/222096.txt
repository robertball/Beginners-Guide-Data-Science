I used one can diced tomatoes instead of whole peeled and I used more chicken broth in place of the water. Very quick to prepare. We topped this soup with a little shredded cheddar cheese, reduced fat sour cream and I served homemade fry bread with it to sop up the broth. I'd make this again but I'd add more spices.

Wonderful recipe!  I was skeptic that the flavor would be ideal in a "healthier" version of this recipe, but it turned out wonderful!  I used about 25% more chicken, half a can of diced jalapenos instead of banana peppers, a can of Bush's seasoned black beans and kept everything else the same.  The chicken was added at the beginning raw, and turned out amazingly tender after cooking 7 hours.

I am so excited to be the first reviewer and to have such wonderful things to say about this recipe! First of all it was so easy to make and it was so filling as well. I have two small boys and they both ate all of it! I did adjust a few things due to the fact that the kids are not big on spice incase it would be I only used one pepper. I also ended up cooking it on top of the stove top since I found out my crock pot was broken. Great it is a definite keeper:)

I was excited to try this recipe  because I wanted more crock pot meals since I work nights.  This would have been a 4-5 stars but as written it was way to bland.  It tasted like water. Almost had me thinking I added to much liquid but I checked three times. You have to add more seasoning a tsp won't cut it.  I added about 3 tablespoons of chili powder, onion, garlic powder, cumin, salt and pepper(I like mine spicy). I also used a jalapeno instead of banana peppers.  Also put in two bay leaves and an extra can of fire roasted tomatoes and 2 tablespoons of tomato paste.  Now that's tasty!

Really delicious... I always make it exactly like the recipe the first time and make notes of what changes to make.. this one will  pretty much remain the same! i especially like baking the tortillas, my previous recipe called for fried tortilla strips.. this is healthier... thanks!

GREAT soup and super easy!  I used homemade broth (I make broth from leftover baked  chicken bones, just toss them in the crock pot  with a little onion celery and carrots , lots of water, and cook all day then freeze - very healthy bone broth  -
 plus it's free, tasty and zero salt.  I added no additional salt and it was still plenty salty for us.  Used 1/2 the chicken and water it suggested, and added a can of black beans (rinsed).  The baked tortillas strips were an excellent addition, and the recipe made 4 big bowls (dinner size).  Didn't plan ahead so started with frozen chicken and broth and it took less than an hour on the stove.  I've made it in the crock pot also and it turns out  wonderful either way. Definitely a repeat!

This soup is amazing. Couple notes: I added black beans, and used white corn instead of yellow (just am not a fan of yellow corn, personally); you can probably replace the enchilada sauce with salsa to cut down on the sodium; and I didn't use the two cups of water because I like my soups heartier. But all-in-all, a very EASY, VERY DELICIOUS soup. Well done!

Easy to make.  Forgot to buy the peppers so added a can of diced mild chilis.  Started with frozen chicken breasts so I put them in without cutting into strips and without defrosting, and fork split them at the end.  Garnished with fresh cilantro, diced green onions, sharp cheddar cheese and a dab of plain nonfat Greek yogurt.  I will definitely make this often.

really good!  I added just a tiny bit of light sour cream, low fat cheese, and green onions and omitted the banana peppers.  Really good.  I will definitely make this again :)

Made this last night, stove top instead of slow cooker.  It was AWESOME!  I did make some changes tho.  Used left-over cooked chicken that I shredded, used a can of diced tomato with green chili's instead of whole tomatoes, used all chicken broth instead of broth and water, and used a Serrano pepper sliced thin, with ribs and seeds, instead of banana peppers.  Spicy!  I used Ancho chili powder instead of generic chili powder.  I also upped the measurements of the chili powder and cumin to 1 tablespoon each, and added a tablespoon of ground corriander because I didn't have fresh cilantro.  I also just bought the tortilla strips that are sold in the salad dressing isle, instead of buying a whole pack of corn tortillas that I would only use 7 of.  Got the chili/lime flavored ones, and they were great!  Also, when I served the soup, I served it with lime wedges to squeeze over the soup.  Very nice touch.  My husband loved it, and I see this becoming a regular soup in our house!

I loved the soup with the few twists:  Used crushed tomatos as a substitute, added roasted green chiles (about 3/4 cup), a lot more spice--Mrs Dash's Southwest Chipotle, chili powder, a lot more garlic, omited salt, Chipotle seasoning plain, crushed red pepper (a lot)--basically had fun with the spices.  I only used broth and added what I wanted to get the right consistency for us.  Great recipe!!!  Thank you!!!  Sunny

Very good. I did make a few small changes: stewed tomatoes instead of whole, seeded jalapeno peppers instead of banana, all chicken broth instead of half water plus I added a can of rinsed black beans and the juice of half a lemon. The baked tortilla strips were a bit of a letdown however. Next time I may use a little corn meal to thicken it as well.

I tried the recipe exactly as it said with two exceptions.  Instead of using water, I used all low-sodium chicken broth and instead of banana peppers I used chopped chiles from a can. Im glad I did these 2 substitutions because the flavor was still pretty mild.  My husband loved it (better than the thick stew style I've tried in the past with beans). I want to see it be a bit spicier and will be using hot enchilada sauce, hotter jalapeño chiles and potentially sautéing my onions prior to throwing in the crockpot.   Overall wonderfully refreshing and easy dish and I cant wait to try again with some spicier tweaks.

This has a decent calorie count, for those who are watching, and excellent flavor.  It has just the right amount of heat to add interest, but not pain!  I let it go on high in the slow cooker for 3 hours, and the chicken was done, and the veggies were still crunchy, just the way I like them!  It has a light, fresh taste, and it is a recipe worth repeating.

What a hit!  I've made this soup twice in the last week.  My family can't get enough of it and asks me to make more.  I added a can of rinsed black beans and a can of hominy and cut back on the amount of banana pepper because we aren't big fans of overly spicy food.  I highly recommend this soup.

Loved this! I would also recommend using diced tomatoes, just so it's not so clumpy. It comes out thin, so if you are planning on using it the same day, I would add some a can of chilli beans or some tomato past to make it a little more hearty. If you're going to eat it the next day, it will thicken up. Definitely double the spices--it's not so spicy, even if you do

I loved this! The flavors were spot on for me. The wife? Not so much! She thought it was to spicy. I think next time I'll cut the chili powder in half and definitely remove the seeds from the peppers. I can always add the heat for me.

I added some tomitillos and used pasilla peppers for a spicier soup as well as a some fresh oregano and kafir lime leaves. I strongly suggest you roast a chicken stuffed with a lime and use what's not meat to make broth. Remove the fat from the broth and use in place of water. A very nice soup that goes great with corn bread, fresh cilantro, avacado, & fresh limes.

Will definitely make this soup again -  very filling and delicious.  The next time I try this I probably will up the spices  - not spicy / hot if made to specs detailed here, but still very good!

I think this soup was amazing. I did tweak it a little bit, and I usually hate it when I see people tweak so much it isn't even the same recipe, but here are the little changes I made. I doubled the chili powder and cumin, added way more than a tablespoon of cilantro, (sheesh I probably used a handful) I used 1 1/2 jalapenos instead of banana peppers, and I added zucchini. I also added a dash of garlic salt. My kid is devouring it. It turned out great.

I am a vegetarian and made this for my meat eating children.  I'm giving it 5 stars because it disappeared so quickly and was very simple to make!  I followed the instructions as written.

This was a keeper.  So simple to just throw everything in the crockpot, but did change it a little bit.  Added a can each of black bean and pinto beans and added more chicken broth versus water and a couple tablespoons of tomato paste to thicken.

I did not make any changes, it was just okay. It did have a nice heat to it but I feel it was lacking in flavor. Probably won't make again.

I make this for my family several times a year and we love it.  I do make a couple of changes.  I double the amount of chicken.  I use cubanelle or anaheim peppers instead of banana when I can find them.  And most importantly, I add one cubed zucchini and one cubed yellow summer squash.  The extra veggies make it even better tasting and gives us a few more veggies in our diet.  Sometimes I also use store bought chips instead of making my own, but I do prefer the ones I make as described in the recipe.  I highly recommend.

I added about a cup of red beans & also used diced tomatoes. Healthier substitute: whole wheat tortillas vs corn tortillas.

Very good soup.  Made with all Chicken Broth instead of water, used jalapenos instead of banana peppers and stewed tomatoes instead of whole canned tomatoes.  Next time I make this I will use chicken thighs instead of breast, just personal preference.  Also no review of the tortilla strips since I didn't make those (I know it’s chicken tortilla soup with no tortillas, lol).

I thought this recipe had great flavor and was very easy to prepare.  My his and who is skeptic of healthy recipes thought it was delicious and the baked tortilla strips were a big hit for my 5 year old!  I did out the chicken breasts in whole and then when they were cooked took them out and chopped them.   Seemed easier to cut and less mess.  This recipe has been made several times and also freezes well!!

This is a family favorite recipe. I make this soup all the time. It's quick and easy yet tastes like I slaved all day in the kitchen. I do substitute chicken broth for the water. In fact I just dump in a 32 oz box of chicken broth. I also omit the banana peppers (I don't like banana peppers) and so instead I add a pinch of dried pepper flakes for the kick. Otherwise I make the recipe exactly as written and I always make a double batch each time. Everyone who tries this recipe loves it and wants the recipe. Thanks so much for a healthy recipe.

Delicious soup! I used 4 cups of homemade turkey stock and omitted the water.  The banana peppers added just the right amount of heat.  We will be making this again!

Winner winner chicken tortilla soup dinner!  I made the full recipe for 2 of us...leftovers.   I changed a couple of things:  small can of Ortega chilis (drained) instead of banana peppers, added a 14 oz can of drained black beans, and we just crushed our favorite tortilla chips into it before eating instead of making tortilla strips.  The usual garnishes-avocado, lime, jack cheese, cilantro and sour cream.  1 bowl is super filling.  I’m sure the leftovers will be even better.

This was a great and very simple recipe to make. Like others that commented, I used a little more chicken as well as more chicken broth vs. water. Another small change I made was fire roasted diced tomatoes. That change gave it a nice little extra kick of flavor. I highly recommend this recipe now that the weather is starting to change. About ten minutes of preparation for a weekend’s worth of belly warming goodness.

The only things different I did was omit the water and use 2 cans of chicken broth and substituted the banana peppers with jalapenos.  I didn't make the tortilla strips but instead a pan of jalapeno cheese cornbread.  This recipe is awesome, thank you!

Definitely make it again. I made my own chicken broth in pressure cooker and used homemade stewed tomatoes. Just warmed it all up in a pot and added toppings to it.

Subbed the banana peppers for jalepenos. The enchilada sauce makes it a little greasy. The tortilla chips were hit and miss on the crunchieness but they are healthier than fried chips. Next time I am going to use more veggies like zucchini and Mexican potatoes and cut out the sauce.

I loved it, I made it for a pot luck at work (Soup-er-bowl) everyone liked it. I used canned corn and tomato sauce instead of the smashed tomatoes (had to use what I had in the house) I cooked the chicken breast in the broth and left out the salt (I’m a low salt person). Also used fresh parsley instead of cilantro because not everyone likes cilantro.  I’ll definitely make this again.

I've been craving soup for so long, at the last minute I decided to make this one. I'll make it again with "skinless chicken breasts" as the recipe called for. Perhaps then it will be an additional star added.

Excellent base recipe!  Doubled everything,  but just 1 1/2 tsp chili powder, and added one can small white beans, skipped enchilada sauce. Chopped up two poblano because I couldn't find banana peppers. Sauteed all aromatics first with spices and then put into slow cooker.  Chopped avocado, scallions for topping. Added cilantro when serving because I don't like the texture after it cooks.

Easy recipe to put together. I spiced it up a bit more than what was called for and it turned out delicious. Don't be afraid to turn up the flavor. I know how I like my soups. :) I will make it again.

For those who say this soup is bland, spice it up !  This soup is meant to be adjusted per your personal tastes.  Some people cannot handle even mild banana peppers...."Some Like it Hot" like me.  I used all chicken broth - no water.  I added a can of diced tomatoes and chilis.  I also added a leftover chopped up jalapeno I had roasted on the grill yesterday when we making fajitas.  ( A teaspoon of Better than Bouillon, extra garlic and garlic powder, saute the onion in olive oil and extra onion powder......mmmm)

I make a healthier (and tastier) version by omitting the enchilada sauce and canned tomatoes and using V8 juice and fresh tomatoes instead.  I like to add black and cannelli beans as well as a can of Hot Rotel.

I used canned diced green chilis in place of the banana peppers. I also pureed a can of diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes.  It is definitely a keeper.

It was good, not great. I will probably shop around a little for a different recipe or make some substitutions, like a Serrano for the banana pepper, more cilantro and maybe more tomatoes.

I used diced tomatoes instead of the peeled ones, replaced the water with more chicken broth, added a tablespoon of each of the spices instead (along with some garlic powder as well), and used habanero peppers instead of banana peppers. It came out HOT, just the way I like it!

Delicious soup!  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles instead of the chicken breast and the banana peppers. The can of Rotel gave it an extra kick that my family likes. Definitely will do it again!

I made a few changes based on the reviews.  First I seasoned the chicken with some onion powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt and pepper before putting it in the crock pot (this is addition to the soup spices).  I used 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of peeled tomatoes.  I used 12 oz taco sauce instead of enchilada sauce.  I added 1 can of black beans and 1 tablespoon of tomatoes paste to thicken it up.  I also increased to 3 cloves of garlic (garlic lover).  For garnish I left some cilantro, cheese and green onions aling with the corn strips.  Yum.  Cut back on the chili powder and it's not too spicy for the kids (my grandkids love it).

This soup is awesome! I made it exactly how it said but I omitted the banana peppers and added more chicken broth than water. My one complaint is the soup seemed a bit watery. Next time I would probably keep everything the same but add some black beans to it to make it a bit chunkier.

I made this as close as possible to the recipe (used my own chicken broth and didn't bother toasting any corn tortillas.) I thought it was delicious. My husband liked it as well, but  thought it was good for lunch--not hearty enough for dinner. Will make again.

Used base recipe pretty much.  Less salt and more spices were added because that is how we like it.  Solid recipe!  Will use again.

I didn't have banana peppers so used red pepper instead. I also bought a bag of crunchy tortilla strips that are usually for salads! This soup was delicious. Next time I think I'll add black beans!

This was super easy and tasty!  I took the advice from some of the other reviewers and doubled the spices.  In a oops moment, we used hot green enchilada sauce instead of red and it worked!  We also substituted poblano peppers instead of banana with surprising results.

I made this and it was a hit with my family.  They love food that is a bit spicy.  I loved it even though it was a bit too spicy for me.  It doesn't take much to be too much for me, so don't let that scare anyone away from trying this at least once.  Easy, fast, enjoy!

It tastes good, just the. Right amount of spiciness for me.  But it's a bit watery.

Finally, a great recipe for chicken chili. It came out delicious. I didn't add water, upped the broth instead. I also doubled the cumin and chili powder, added just a hint of cayenne as well. Spicy but delicious.

Awesome soup.  I used jalapeños instead of banana peppers and it gave it a nice kick.  Definitely in the rotation.

This was a good alternative healthy meal.  Just made a few changes.  Instead of canned enchilada sauce used a jar of the Hatch 505 sauce.  Instead of tomatoes and banana peppers used a can of Rotel.  Increased broth and didn't use water.  All other ingredients remained the same.  Very tasty.

Made it per the recipe, turned out very good...  But next time i would do as a few users suggested. 1 being to use chicken broth in place of water. I will also add more corn and some black beans and a couple of diced jalapenos. But that is for MY taste.

I added a can of drained black beans. Agree with other cooks that it starts mild & can add more spices to taste. Also easy to adjust consistency with liquids of choice.  Didn't know tortilla strips were that easy to make...they were gone before the soup was!  I will make it again.

Loved this recipe!  Made it exactly but instead of chopping up my chicken before cooking, I just put the breasts in whole and once it was finished cooking I just pulled the chicken out and shredded it with two forks and put it back in (like pulled pork).  I used only chicken broth too; no water.  I also seasoned the tortilla strips with chilli powder, kosher salt, and garlic powder -- YUM!!  Will make again!!

I had some leftover green chilli stew that I used for the enchilada sauce and green chillies.  It was a nice taste. 
I can see many variations that I might try next time.

made this at work - everyone brought to the pot, so the recipe wasn't exactly as listed, but pretty close! It had quite a bit of heat to it but we used cream cheese, & avocado to bring down the bite! We would make this again!

Very tasty soup.  I added some heat with chili peppers.  I also think black beans would be a good addition and a canned cheese to add a creamy texture.  Love recipes from this website.

Very easy.  I love the flavor.  I keep eating it and eating it.  I got lazy and didn't make the tortilla strips so I used some tortilla chips.  Still great.  This will be great for the winter.

I added hominy and used onion powder instead (don't like onions but like the flavor. ...odd I know)  but the hominy was a great add. Also used jalapeño for a little more spice than banana pepper. We put it over rice too but it wasn't necessary.

I thought this recipe was simple to make and very good.  I added quite a bit more cilantro than called for and 1/2 the amount of cumin as it is not my favorite spice.  I used a medium-hot enchilada sauce.  The soup was spicy but did not leave the afterburn.  The results were delicious.  My husband complimented me on it.

I followed the recipe, except for the banana pepper.  I used a can of chopped jalapeno peppers.  When I served the soup, I topped it with a dollop of sour cream, chopped fresh cilantro and thin slices of fresh avocado.  It was very good, and I will make this recipe again.

I liked this recipe. It was simple, easy to put together and the results were tasty with a side benefit of plenty of leftovers for the work week. I will defiantly make it again.

I wanted it to be a 30 minute meal.  I sautéed my onion and garlic in 1T. oil. I used the breast meat from a rotisserie chicken. And I used New York Texas Toast tortilla strips to top it off along with shredded cheddar cheese. I will make again!

Loved it! 
Took chicken out 1 hr early, shredded and placed back in crock pot for the last hour.

Adjusted ingredients and measurements:
--1 1/2 lbs chicken, shredded instead of 1lb 
--1 can of diced tomatoes instead of whole
--1/2 an onion
--2 bay leaves
--1 cup of water instead of 2
--no salt
--no cilantro

This is easy and delicious.  I don't use enchilada sauce - I use one can of Rotel instead.  Sometimes I add a can of black beans too.  Serve with chips and shredded cheese.  Kids and adults always love it!

Loved it! Added carrots and celery and used diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes.  Topped it with Pepper Jack cheese, chips and avocado.  Delicious!

I was really looking forward to trying this soup. I used 2 cans of tomatoes diced with chili peppers included. I drained them to get some of the sodium out. This added more spice and it went well with the lowfat sour cream. I didn't use the banana peppers but at the end I cut a lime and added the juice from half the lime. The second time I made this I added black beans. This recipe is great to add new things to. I will use this soup a lot everybody loves it.

Fantastic recipe.  I took the recommendations of others and put the chicken breasts (frozen) into the slow cooker.  I then cooked it all on high for 6 hours.  When it was done, I shredded the chicken while it was still in the cooker. I also replaced the banana peppers with a 4 oz. can of diced green chilies and added a 15 oz can of drained/rinsed black beans to the mix.  As others have mentioned, this makes a great meal when served over 1/2 cup of brown rice.  I will be making this again!

I made this soup tonight and its a HUGE hit in my house.  Especially for my 11 year old grandson who is a very picky eater.

I did change some things.  Instead of the canned tomatoes and the banana peppers, I added 2 cans of Rotel diced tomatoes with mild jalapenos.  I used vegetable broth because it had very little sodium in it. I also made homemade enchilada sauce for the same reason, to reduce the sodium.

This will be a regular on our menu!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe, and so does my husband and my very young toddler. I use almost twice the chicken, canned green chilis since my grocery store doesn't carry banana peppers, and I add a can of black beans. Keep a close eye on those tortilla strips though, because in just ten minutes, mine were way too brown to enjoy.

Great recipe!  I actually used frozen chicken breasts and pull them apart when it is done cooking.  Easier for my busy schedule!  You would never know this recipe is the "healthy" version because it is so good!

This soup is amazing!!!  You can reduce the sodium used by mashing 4 medium tomatoes yourself instead of using canned tomatoes.  The same goes with the corn and I also added a half cup of cooked black beans (which was in the can) and then, instead of using enchilada sauce I used 1/4 a cup of chili sauce to spice it up (use only if you like it spicy though and reduce the amount as necessary)...I also added two tables spoons of tomato paste to thicken it up, it’s absolutely delicious!!!! Garnish with ff cheese and sour crème then sprinkle little chips...hmmm good!!!

A family favorite. One of the tastiest healthier slow cooker recipes I've tried yet. Very simple and delicious. Makes great leftovers, even better the next day.
