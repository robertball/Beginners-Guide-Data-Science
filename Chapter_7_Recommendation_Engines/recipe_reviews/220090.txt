I am the submitter of this recipe and have an extra tip that may be helpful ~ These dog biscuits require the use of Wheat flour which some dogs are sensitive to, if so its so easy to modify this recipe, simply substitute one cup of wheat flour for 1-1/4 cup of rye or oat flour or Â¾ cup, rice, barley or potato flour.. ALSO if you are interested in baking your own dog biscuits I have some excellent tips in an AR blog that I have written.

I have never baked any kind of dog treats before, so i thought i would make them for my 8 year old Bordie collie.
It was the easiest recipe to make, I made them exactly as written. They rolled out so nice and smooth, i wish some other recipes were so easy to make as these were. As for the taste, they must have been yummy as my dog quickly downed it. Instead of squares i made little round ones, they make a good size batch, i will freeze the rest to keep them fresh and thaw a few out when needed!!

This recipe was very easy. I mixed it up in the kitchen aid and rolled it out onto the counter. I used a pizza cutter to zip off the individual pieces before baking them. Our boxer pup loves them!

I modified a bit (no offense to poster, I never follow a recipe down to the T, lol). Had some bananas that were going to go bad soon, so I mashed one of those into the applesauce/egg mixture and added a 1/2 tsp mint extract. Used crunchy PB, cause that's what I had on hand. Instructions very clear, easy to follow - THANK YOU!! Cut mine with a pizza cutter, super quick. I love that these are made with ingredients found in my kitchen and this recipe is forgiving, so you can add items without totally messing up the outcome. IF there are any left at the 2 week mark, I can always throw the leftovers out to the chickens and make a new batch. But my little girl loves them, so I doubt there will be leftovers. Looking forward to trying some of Bries other recipes!!

I wanted to make treats for my two shih tzus and I was looking around the web for recipes and came across this one and decided to try it. It was a HIT!  My boys love them and they don't bother my little ones' sensitive stomach which is great! They have gone so fast I will have to make more soon.

Sadie and Sosa love these biscuits!  The next time though I will roll them out a little thicker, the thinner ones got a little well done, but they still loved them.  And maybe not bake them quite as long. Used a shot glass to cut them out, so they are the perfect bite sized treat.  Gave some goodie bags out to family for their dogs and was told they were a huge hit!

My four legged niece loves these.  I score them to make them easier to break into smaller treats using a pizza wheel pressed lightly.

The only change I made to this is that I did not roll out the dough but instead placed pong ball size pieces of dough onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.  They were a hit with my ten year old Labrador!

i made this recipe without corn meal because i didn't have any. the dough was much sticker then i expected. i decided it wouldn't work to make cookies with it so maybe i can make some pupcakes with it so i put the dough in a muffin tin. when it came out of the oven it was more like bread rolls. they were to big to feed to my dog all at once so i  cut them to make them bite sized. on the bright side when i gave some to my dog she absolutely loved them she devoured them faster then i can say woof. so i guess this was a sort of weird success.

My Puppy and my Grand-puppy love these treats. They were easy to make and to roll out. Fun for the pups to eat and for me to make!

These smelled delicious as they cooked! Dogs liked them, especially after I added some of their food as "sprinkles." In all, the recipe made 40, and then 10 balls about the size of a penny.  Did need a mixer to try and cut through some of the dough to mix it evenly, and I also added 1/4 a cup of milk to thicken it. Overall, good job!
