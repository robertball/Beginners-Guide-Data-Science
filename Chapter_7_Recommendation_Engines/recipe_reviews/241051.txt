This was really easy and really quick to make AND it was delicious!  I used blackberries instead of raspberries because that is what I had in the freezer.  Also, I did two layers of chocolate glaze. I microwaved the cream and chocolate chips for 25 seconds and then stirred until it was smooth rather than using the stove top method. The first layer of glaze went on as a crumb coating and then I made a second batch of the glaze which I spread on after the first layer cooled (about 30 minutes). Spread the glaze on when it it is between 90-95 degrees for a perfect finish.  The only thing I might do different next time is add more ReaLemon as I like a very lemony flavor.

Absolutely amazing, so easy and loved by everyone.  I have been asked for this recipe every time I make it and people literally rave about it.  It seems like it would be a process to make but actually it could not be easier!

I made this recipe as a birthday cake for a friend who loves chocolate and raspberries.  What a hit!  Most cheesecakes are just too large for a small gathering, but this one was just right.  I was a little short on the raspberries to make the sauce in the recipe,  so I substituted two ounces of raspberry liqueur for half of the berries.  Tasted just delicious!
