Made this last night and rubbed it all over some T-bone steaks before grilling (added the rub about 1 hour before grilling). The finished results was excellent.

This is an excellent rub which I have been using for chicken, pork, beef and turkey for a few years.

I only made one substution because I did not have coriander seed. I used a half teaspoon of ground coriander. I rubbed this on chicken. Really, really good. Probably one of the best spice mixtures I've ever made. Sure the title says "beef" but it's excellent on chicken, too.

Oh my! This one is a keeper. I had to make it twice because I couldn't believe it. The meat is soooo moist and tender - make extra because it is even better the day after and makes great sandwich meat.

I wasn't as excited about this recipe as others were. I tried it on a London Broil. Maybe I needed a different cut of meat.

This is amazing!  I even left out some of the ingredients the first time, and it's still spectacular.  I used this rub on a leg of lamb that I was roasting, and it enhanced the meat very nicely.  The rub is flavorful enough to leave a presence, but does not over-power the natural taste of the meat.  Great job with this one!

mmmmm wow!  it's like bbq for dummies, you cannot screw up! i used it on beef ribs and pork ribs and even tofu. i wrap it with the rub, throw in grill on high, then turn down low for about an hour. then baste with bbq sauce at the end.  i can't believe i made such tender ribs, like magic.  i'd add some cayenne to this for some kick. i made in oven too, just cover with foil.  all these herbs and spices together are a perfect combination.

I doubled this recipe for 2 racks of baby back ribs.I give my ribs alot of TLC and it is worth it in the end and this rub made my ribs just so so good! Wednesday evening I rubbed the ribs. Double wrapped them with foil and they sat in the frige for 24 hours. Thursday evening I baked them for 4 hours at 250 degrees in the foil on a cookie sheet. Back in the frige. Friday afternoon we took the ribs for a 200 mile ride to the PA mountains. Saturday they sat on the edge of our camp fire for 3 more hours while we did spring clean up. Dinner was so good and thise ribs fell right off the bone after all that TLC! Looking forward to cooking ribs again the same way!

Looking for a rub recipe to compliment our ribeyes I turned to this. I followed all the ingredients with the exception of the white pepper, which I didn't have. We're not heavy pepper fans so it worked for us. I mixed the rub ingredients and put them on our ribeyes and let them set while the charcoal grill was heating up. I really wish I had made this earlier and let them sit for a bit. The rub was good and not overpowering and complimented the meat well. Next time I will prepare ahead and let them hang out for awhile before tossing on the grill to get the extra flavor boost.

This is sooo good.  I used it on baby back ribs and it was delicious.  I put the rub on the ribs and put them in the refrig over night.  The next day I wrapped them in foil and baked them for 4 hours at 225 degrees.  Then I took them out and put BBQ sauce all over them and cook them on a medium quill for about 10 minutes, to give them that saucy appearance like in the restaurant.  My husband does not like baby back ribs but he loved these.  My whole family loved them.  I will definately make these again.

This rub is fantastic. Used it on a brisket prior to a mango-infused marinade (for tenderizing). It's so delicious I just can't stop eating! My doctor is going to be mad at my cholesterol level... Awesome.

I used this on some steaks for our barbecue yesterday. Put it on the night before and left them in the fridge until we were ready to cook. Very good. Thanks.

this came out pretty good.. tasted how i expect bbq to taste.. used this on pork chops that we grilled.. left out the brown sugar (per usual).. crushed my own bay leaves and used about 1/2 tsp more since the recipe calls for ground.. used about 1/4 tsp more savory since all i had was crushed.. doubled the black pepper since i don't carry white and doubled the cumin as well.. threw in some cherry wood chips for some smoke and really enjoyed dinner.. ty for the recipe
