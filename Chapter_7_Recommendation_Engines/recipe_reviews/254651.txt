This is good and refreshing and not too sweet. Although, I don't know that I'm a big fan of drinking watermelon. I may like it better strained a bit to get out some pulp and berry seeds. Thank you for the recipe.

We probably used less watermelon, more raspberry, and more water - but it was surprisingly well received! Not sure if we will make this one again, though.
