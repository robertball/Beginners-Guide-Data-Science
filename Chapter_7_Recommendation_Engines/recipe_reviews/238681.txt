This is my recipe. It is not typical curry fare but it makes your mouth water for more. I like to serve it over rice. A couple of things they altered is that I like to take my cuts of chicken (thighs my favorite for this) and dredge them in a flour/salt/curry powder mix and brown them in a saute pan with butter prior to placing in the baking dish. Also, once you have cooked up the bacon, onion and apple, thoroughly stir in your flour and let it cook for a minute prior to adding the liquids as it helps alleviate any issue with chunks of flour.

I make no claim to know anything about curry. I only know that this recipe is delicious and I need to make this again! It has a lovely combination of flavors--sweet savory salty--that are just downright good. Though there is more preparation than I usually do for a weeknight this dish is worth the trouble. Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

Well I made several changes because I used what I had on hand. 1)called for pineapple used peaches instead 2)called for chicken broth used vegetable broth instead 3)called for tomato purée used tomato sauce instead 4)called for a tart apple used a sweet one instead. It tasted delicious. I wish I would ve had the correct ingredients on hand next time I will!

This was so easy and the flavors of curry and pineapple were perfect!! The only thing I altered was the tomato purée I didn t have any but used Mexican salsa instead (something I always have in the fridge). I will definitely be making this again!!!

I’m giving the recipe five stars for flavor. But the recipe is quite a bit of trouble if you brown the chicken first as I did. (Clean-up is messy.) I used chicken thighs browned in olive oil and garlic, added green pepper for color, saw no need for pineapple slice garnish, but did add a sprinkling of cayenne pepper, which was absolutely essential for us.
