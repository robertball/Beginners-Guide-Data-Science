We have been doing this for years its great! It's one of my families favorites! Except we dont use the butter, just cut the squash in half, put cut side facing down, when you can stab easily with a fork then its done (like a potato). Then use an oven mitt to hold the squash with one hand and scrape out the insides with a fork, then add brown sugar to everyones individual preference! It looks like spaghetti! (i.e. spaghetti squash)

This recipe is excellent, and a great way to get the kids to enjoy a healthy vegetable.

I cut the sugar to 1/8 cup and added a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Kids loved it.

Rating the recipe as is. It is wonderful.  It is a little sweet for me but I have my own recipe which is a bit more involved:  
Cut squash in half, lengthwise.  Bake skin-side up, cut-side down, until it is done.  Turn over and use fork to pull up strands.  Mix butter, brown sugar, a small can of mandarin oranges and a 1/2 cup of sliced almonds. Toss.  Put it back into the shell and place it back in the oven for 10 minutes to heat through.  Family loves this recipe.

So good!  I do something like this for acorn squash but have only made savory spaghetti squash.  I added a tiny bit of chipotle powder and some sage.  It's sitting on the stove waiting for my hubby to get home and I can't stop snacking on it!!

VERY tasty. I took it easier on the sugar than the recipe calls for and it's still delish. Great side dish.

One of my family's favorite meals by far (we eat a ton of pasta so this is a great alternative). I also printed and gave this recipe to my toddler's school teacher and they're making it this fall. I try to back off the brown sugar and add a lot of cinnamon.

I made this with dinner last night and it was pretty good. I added some cinnamon to the brown sugar which was a nice extra little kick (and I love how cinnamon smells!), but I think I might have used a squash that was a little too large - the brown sugar/butter/cinnamon didn't really flavor the whole thing. I'm excited to try it again though with a smaller squash!

I agree with the previous post. This was good, "for a squash." I sprinkled a bit more brown sugar on once it was scooped on to plates. Two out of three picky kids and both picky adults thought it was pretty good. :)

A very tasty and simple way to prepare spaghetti squash! Mine needed a little more time in the oven than was suggested but I would expect cooking time to vary based on the size of the squash.

This is my husbands rating of this, as I don't eat squash. He says for a squash it gets a 5, if it was just rating for overall food, then it would get a 4.

My new favorite!!! Had a huge spaghetti squash so I doubled the recipe and had to cook it longer and we loved it!!! I could have eaten the whole thing by myself if I didn't have to share it with everyone else. I liked mine with a bit of added salt but the kids loved as is!

P.S. I started making this once and was then invited to the in-laws for dinner at the last minute so I put it in my slow cooker on low till we got home. It was still just as awesome!!!

It was too sweet and bland at the same time.  The squash is bland, the sugar is sweet, and the flavors don't blend or complement at all.   I was suprised, since a similar treatment works so well for nearly every other winter squash I have ever tried.  Oh well.

Butter and brown sugar...what's not to like! First, I microwave the squash so it's easier to cut through.  Mine was huge, so I had to cook it longer. We added the butter and suger to taste...not specific measurements. I couldn't get enough of this.  Will definately make again...thanks!

I have made this on my own for years, but forgot what I did. This recipe was very easy, but I was out of brown sugar, so I used cane sugar syrup (NOT KARO), and cinnamon. 

I am thinking of bringing it to my brother's for Christmas.

In general, I try to like vegetables.  And this was my first attempt at making spaghetti squash and I thought this recipe looked good.  After I made it, though, I and my family didn't like it much.  I no longer think that sweetening the spaghetti squash is the way to go, so I'll try a very different recipe to cook my next ripe spaghetti squash.

I made this tonight for dinner, but for a little healthier version I used organic maple syrup for a sweetener...then after I took  it out of the oven and shredded the squash with a fork, I added a coat of Parmesan cheese, sliding it back in the oven until the cheese melted...really delicious.

I love this way of eating spaghetti squash. I do feel the cooking time isn’t quite long enough. Maybe my squash are too big!  I usually end up cooking it for an hour.

The cooking time on this was perfect for me. I cut the brown sugar to one table spoon per half of the squash & think I’ll even try cutting a bit of the butter, but it was very good!

This is so easy and such an easy way to make spaghetti squash.  It is something different the entire family loves.  I put some shredded gruyere cheese on top right before serving for a special flavor. YUM!

I made this very easy recipe! I don't eat sugar so I used Truvia sweetener, Country Crock and a little cinnamon. I had a lot of trouble cutting it in half. Maybe I didn't use the correct knife. It was delish! My daughter and granddaughter didn't like it. I was surprised because my grandbaby eats a lot of foods and textures. But she's one and it was odd to her. Maybe when she's older. But I loved it! And I will make it again.

I felt there wasn't much flavor in this dish. My kids even said, "it doesn't taste like anything ".  Perhaps I did something wrong, but I won't be making this again.

Halved the recipe since I wanted to try it on just one half of the squash, but still made it as written. The night of, it tasted more like spaghetti squash with plain old butter and a hint of sweet. Not bad, but on the bland side. Had a little for lunch today and could definitely taste the sweetness from the brown sugar. It was too sweet for us, but perhaps we prefer a more savory spaghetti squash than sweet. Ok to make again, but as a side to another main dish perhaps.

Loved it!!! Made it more than once, but the second time melted the butter to brush on it, and didn't mix any butter the with brown sugar. We just don't eat that much butter in our house. But LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! I never ate squash before this. YUMMY!!!!!
The time varies depending on the size of your squash (of course) just gently stab it with a fork... it should easily go into the squash ... used this for ButterNut Squash and Acorn Squash.. all were AWESOME!!

Lovely!  I made this tonight for a side dish with Chipotle chicken breast and it paired perfectly,  I ended up mixing them together to eat.  I could've eaten the entire thing myself it was so good!  I was hoping my kids would love it too as another way to get them to eat veggies but they unfortunately didn't like it, yes,  they may be crazy.  They love broccoli and cauliflower,  but a pasta impersonating veggie with butter and brown sugar they say no to?!?
Can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow and at least I get the whole thing to myself.  :)

This was good, but it comes out as pretty crunchy and almost not done with the cook time listed. It softened up the next day for leftovers and was much better.

I do the sweet thing with acorn and butternut as well. I also choose the microwave over baking this type of squash. Saves a ton of time. I also add a dash of salt and cinnamon or pumpkin spice. This time around I halved the recipe to do sweet tonight and savory tomorrow night.

I only used about 2 T of brown sugar because I had dark brown sugar and I didn't want it too sweet.  It was ok.  I guess I just like my spaghetti squash with a more savory flavor rather than sweet.

I made a savory version. I did everything except add the brown sugar. I then put spaghetti sauce with some Parmesan cheese. Very tasty side with chicken and green beans.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS !!! I made this along with "Aunt Mary's Eggplant Balls" and served it with a small amount of tomato sauce....my family (who normally do not like squash) LOVED it !!!

YUM!  I think I could've used even more brown sugar.  :)  Sweet tooth!

okay, but too sweet for my taste…actually even my 9-yr old thought it was too sweet!  Maybe we'll try it again someday with less butter and less brown sugar, but we'll likely stick with different recipes.
