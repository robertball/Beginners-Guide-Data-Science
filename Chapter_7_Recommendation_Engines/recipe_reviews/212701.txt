This is a very moist bread. The pumpkin flavour is quite subtle. But I have pumpkin bread recipes which are easier to prepare and I do not need to use the more expensive pumkin butter in it.

I had some pumpkin butter to use up (Pumpkin Butter I from this site) and this recipe was perfect for it. I am used to baking with whole wheat so I used 50/50 WW and AP which required the use of canola oil rather than butter as it works better with WW flour. This loaf was moist and bursting with spicy pumpkin flavor! I LOVED the ribbon of pumpkin butter running through the middle. I'm going to have to make some more pumpkin butter just to be able to make this recipe again. Thanks so much for sharing it!

Good mild flavor - I think I would actually like this bread better without the ripple of pumpkin butter as it makes it pretty sweet. Plus the batter near the layer of pumpkin butter was almost undercooked. I love the flavor of this bread though! The batter was pretty thick but it still came out pretty moist. Only change was to use half white half white whole wheat flour and I chose to omit the raisins and nuts.

I used two pans - it overflowed all over my oven in one pan.

I really like this recipe! I used 50/50 Whole wheat and AP flour. Also I substituted Allspice for the nutmeg and clove 'cause I'm out of clove (and now allspice). Also I used a 9x5 pan and had no problem of it spilling over... Over all I'm very satisfied with how it turned out.

Pan size was too small for recipe. I used a regular sized loaf pan (like you would bake a loaf of bread in) and it was perfect. Smells wonderful and I can hardly wait to cut into it. I used homemade pumpkin butter in it (pumpkins raised in our garden last year).

Pretty good recipe. I made a couple of changes though: I used whole wheat flour instead of AP flour. The pumpkin butter I bought was pretty sweet and had a lot of spices in it so I ended up only using 1 tsp of pumpkin spice (instead of the other spices) and used maybe half the sugar. I added more apple juice to mine as well since the batter wasn't as wet as it needed to be. Came out pretty good overall. I liked the little ribbon of pumpkin butter in the middle.
