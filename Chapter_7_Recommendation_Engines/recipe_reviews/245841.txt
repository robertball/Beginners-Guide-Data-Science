I followed the recipe exactly. My family loved it. Everyone ate three bowls! Personally, I thought it was a little bland so I added salt and garlic powder to my bowl. I will be making this again.

I made it on the stove. Tastes amazing. Easy to make, everyone that tries it loves it, and doesn't take long to make. 
Definitely a favorite of mine!
