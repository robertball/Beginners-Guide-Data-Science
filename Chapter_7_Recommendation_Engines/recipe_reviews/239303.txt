This was so incredibly delicious!  I used F/F !/2 and 1/2 but otherwise followed the recipe.  It made a lot of luscious sauce.  So next time I would either add one or two more pears or for two pears just cut the ingredients in half....except the amaretto, of course!  Thanks Sherry Lynn.  We loved your recipe!

This is a very easy and luscious dessert.  Next time I would add a little additional sugar and increase the baking time.
