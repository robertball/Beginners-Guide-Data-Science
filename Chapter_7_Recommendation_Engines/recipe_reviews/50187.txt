I have made these tomatoes for years.  Make sure you slice the tomatoes thick and try just broiling them for a few minutes till brown and bubbly rather than baking them.  The tomatoes stay firmer and not so mushy as the baked ones.  I also always add oregano and omit the mustards.  Sometimes I even add a little garlic.

You know, this isn't a complex dish and the preparation is simple and basic. But that doesn't mean it isn't worthy of five stars and in my opinion, this is.  What a dressy alternative to just sliced tomatoes! I prepared this with the two mustards just as written and it proved to be a winning combination.  The tang of the mustard and Parmesan was the perfect complement for the mellow mozzarella.  I used fresh rather than dried oregano as I'm lucky enough to have it in my garden.  A quick finish under the broiler browned these up nicely.  This is easy, uses quality ingredients, is pretty on the plate and, most important, is full of delicious flavor too.

This was really yummy!! The kitchen smelled so good while it was cooking!! The changes I made were as follows: omitted brown mustard, used fresh basil instead of parsely,sprinkled the s&p directly on the tomatoes & I used garlic mayo.I also broiled them for a minute to brown the top.Will deffinately make again!!

Wow! These are so tasty! They can be a meal in and of themselves. This is nice because it can work as an appetizer or a side. Quick and easy, but tastes like you spent a long time. I cut back on the mustards - basically using half of each which gave it just the right amount of pizzaz. After they came out of the oven I sprinkled the tops with fresh basil vs. fresh parsley. Great blend of flavors! This is a definite keeper especially with fresh garden tomatoes over the summer months.

I adjusted this recipe a bit towards my tastes but it is a good recipe all by itslef. I added mushrooms, red onion and ricotta cheese because I had them on hand. Instead of putting the tomatoes singly on a baking sheet, I put them in a glass pie plate (sprayed with PAM) and spread the mayo mixture over it to bake.  Magnificent!! The ricotta cheese was the best addition, by far!

definately add some garlic, and don't slice the tomatoes to thin or they will fall apart -- We like about 1/4th to 1/2 inch thick.

5 Stars Plus!  What a fantastic recipe for summertime, when tomatoes are plentiful.  I made this for a casual BBQ yesterday and everyone loved them.  I did switch from Bake to Broil at the end to get the mozzarella cheese brown and bubbly.   Everyone went back for seconds! Ii will absolutely make this recipe again and again and again.

I was surprised how yummy this simple recipe was when I used it on some overly ripe tomatoes. I added some olive oil & left out the brown mustard (I only had dijon on hand). Next time I would halve the amount of mayo used - was just a little too strong. Thick slices worked well - it didn't end up too watery for me.

Wonderful! I omitted the mustard. Used lots of Italian seasongs; basil, oregeno, etc. Got the biggest tomatoes I could find for this recipe (now that is all I buy, they are so good!) Hubby said this is like eating at a gormet restaurant! Thanks Natalie

Easy and fabulous.  Must rate this 5 stars as it is easy, with ingredients normally on hand and wonderful.  We've made this regularly with the abundant tomatoes from our garden...and even in the winter as it spruces up not so great tomatoes.

I made this recipe for a party. Most of the people thought it was good but we all agreed that it had too much mustard in it. I think I will make it again and put 1/2 the mustard and add some fresh chopped garlic.

These are FABULOUS!  I love the mix of baked tomatoes and the mustards and cheese. Exactly what I was looking for to go with the "Tasty Chicken Bake"!

This is one of my all time favorite things to eat. I've made this so many times! I triple the recipe because we like a lot of topping. The only change I have made is to half the mustard. Rather than baking, I just put them under the broiler for a couple of minutes until they brown. This keeps them from getting soggy. Cut your tomatoes at least a quarter inch thick and dry them well after slicing as it helps the topping spread on better. I also wanted to mention how fabulous this topping is on portabello mushroom burgers (or any burger!) with homemade roasted red peppers. Unbelievable!

This dish is wonderful!  I used roma tomatos, because they are meaty, chopped them and mixed all the ingredients together.  I used fresh mozzarella cheese.  After everything was thoroughly mixed, I spread it in a shallow casserole and baked per the directions.  Even my tomato hating son liked this!  It works well as a topping on a bagel or pita bread.

Really good accompanyment for many different entres.  I have done this for years with halved romas.  An added touch which helps stablize the product on a sheet pan is to cut 1/2 inch slices of yellow squash, remove pulp, and rest tomato inside.  Using the halved product also reduces the loss of juices.  The presentation is artfull while simple.

These were a big hit at my family's annual Lake Tahoe trip.  Everyone loved them.  I followed all the directions, but broiled them for about 10 minutes instead of baking.  I didn’t want them to get too soggy.  I also used shredded Parmesan.  I will be making these regularly.  Great recipe.... Thanks!

I originally served these with "kicken london broil with blue cheese butter", (also from this site), and they really complimented each other.  My husband loved the tomatoes so much that he ate the leftovers for two days straight.  We used the leftover london broil to make sandwiches and the tomatoes were great, because they already had the mustard, mayo, and cheese on them.  He even topped his cheese omelets with them.  A great way to use your garden tomatoes!

I should have sliced my tomatoes much thicker. They got a little soggy during the cooking. I also didn't have brown mustard, but they turned out just lovely with extra Dijon! I used grated parmesan cheese, as it didn't really specify. Yummy snack/appetizer! :)

I just halved the tomatoes and pulled out the pulp. Used light mayo, used all dried herbs and added basil. Also, I just put them under the broiler instead of baking. The next time I might add some bread crumbs to the top along with the mozz

Surprisingly delicious! I made these as written, though it took about 25 minutes at 350 to brown them. I used a coarse-ground brown mustard, loved the flavor with the tomatoes. I would probably broil these instead of baking next time, as other reviewers suggest. Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good. But they are not so good after you put them in the refrigerator and if you eat them cold. This is a nice vegetable choice and is fun to make because a single vegetable has the spotlight. The finished appearance is thus simple. The mellowness of the yellow mustard dressing surprised and satisfied me. It was not spicy. The Parmesan takes an equal stance with the mustard taste-wise. The Parmesan also gives the yellow sauce a nice thickness. I used solely brown mustard, no Dijon, and the flavors worked. I think the oregano spice is very important, it definitely altered the sauce's taste. It was more rounded.  My boyfriend wanted more cheese on top. The tomatoes were not watery and flimsy after baking. I did not use parsley. And used reduced fat mayo.

Excellent taste!  My family a crew of professed tomatoe hater loved this recipe.  I gave it 4 stars because it gets soggy quickly.  Don't use this recipe if you want leftovers.

Thanks Natalie. This recipe is terrific.  My husband and I fought over the leftovers.  I did change one thing.  I substituted garlic salt for the regular salt.  I passed the recipe on to my neighbor who has been sharing his wonderful home grown tomatoes with us.

Very good and tasty- a great way to use tomatoes.  I only used about one TBS. of mayo and a little bit of olive oil.

These were an interesting new side dish. A lot of different flavors in one bite. I didn't have dijon or brown mustard, so I used a deli honey mustard. I also used fresh basil instead of parsley because - c'mon: tomatoes and basil. Broiled on a greased baking sheet for ten minutes until the cheese was browning and bubbly. Yum!

eh, ok.  Coudn't taste all those other flavors like the mustard and so on, and much of the cheese kind of slid off.  I was dissapointed.

This recipe was very good - it was sloppy but it's worth it! It was nice to use up the extra tomatoes that my neighbor gave me. Thanks, I will make this again.

I had 2 tomatoes that were ready to go bad. Said I am not wasting as I saw your recipe.  Tomatoes and mayo, yes, tomatoes with mayo and mustard that is stretching it in my book but I had everything in house and I half the recipe.  I am one person now I had 2 tomatoes baked, tasted and was in heaven..  I eat half of them.  Saved the other and put back in oven the following night to reheat.  My friend is bringing fresh tomatoes (not that store sawdust kind) for July 4th..  we are going to make again..  Thank you Natalie..  have forwarded this recipe to all my friends.

I'm giving this 3 stars as the 1st time I made it, my husband thought it was too heavy because of the mayonnaise (& I'd used light mayo). The 2nd time I made it, I substituted some olive oil for the mayo and eliminated the oregano, due to family preference.  We thought it was better with the olive oil.  You may want to experiment with how much olive oil to add, if you want to try this substitution.  With half the recipe, I'd say 1 tablespoon or possibly a litle more would be OK so the mustard is spreadable.  I may try it another time just with brown mustard as my husband likes that better.  As I usually have the ingredients in the house, I thought it was worth a little effort to tinker with this recipe.

very easy and very yummy! my family was impressed (my daughter said "are you making baked tomatoes for dinner??? why? we could have a salad!!" but then she gobbled them up!).
I went easy with the mustard, because I didn't trust them to like it much, but even halving the quantity it was enough to give it a nice edge and personality. I also had no mozzarella and substituted it with soft provolone cheese.

I loved these tasty little tomatoes, hubs did not, not at all.    I used small Campari tomatoes and baked them in the toaster oven.  Baking did make the tomato softer than I would have liked, so next time, I'm going to pop them under the broiler.  The topping had wonderful flavor and they presented nicely on a plate.  I will be making this again, but apparently just for myself.

My tomatoes were pretty small, (a little smaller than a tennis ball) so I cut them in half and seeded them.  I used the amount of mayo and parm called for and then added dijon to taste.  We liked it!

We were really divided on these. The mustard seems to overpower everything else. Next time I will try cutting both of the mustards in half and see if that helps.

Not bad!  I think I could crave these every now and then.  I just don't think I am a fan of warm tomatoes on their own (as in not in pasta, etc.).  Once I have the dijon mustard I'll try again.  Here are the things I did differently . . . 1. Cut the recipe in half and only used 2 tomatoes.  2. Didn't have dijon mustard so I used regular mustard with about 1/4 tsp horseradish.  3. Added 1/8 tsp garlic powder.  4. Used dried parsley (didn't measure, just used what I thought  looked good).  5. Baked at 350 for 8 minutes and then broiled for about 1 minute (check to see if cheese is browned).  *EDIT*  So I just ate one this morning (cold) and really enjoyed it.  Although some people may not like the texture of the cold cheese, I really liked these when the tomato wasn't warm.

The mayo imparted a strong flavor that to me was kind of odd. I would suggest serving this only as a side dish and not as an appetizer because it is awkward to eat.

These were very good. The topping is a little on the tart side. I did not have brown mustard, so had to leave that out, but otherwise, these were made as written.  Next time I make these, I may cut down on the mayo, as that might be what I am finding takes this a bit over the top.

The first time I tried this recipe the tomatoes came out soggy. The 2nd time I used halves of tomatoes and sprinkled with salt and set on paper towels for 30 minutes to get out a lot of the juice. They weren't  soggy at all, and I like the thickness of the tomato better. Great recipe. Thanks

This is really good!!!  I took the advice of some of the earlier post and salt and peppered the tomatoes before I topped the tomatoes with the mixture. I didn't measure the ingredients, just eyeballed it and then just put the tomatoes under the broiler until the cheese just started to melt - not totally melted.  I didn't bake them so that they wouldn't be all mushy.  I will do this again!!  REALLY tasty!!!

I've made something similar to this for years.  They are always finished the first night I make them!  I've recently started using Dijonnaise as it's easier.  I also add 2 tbsps each of very finely chopped red onion and celery and 1 large can of tuna mixed in as well.  I top each slice with a mixture of shredded cheeses (whatever's in the fridge!), a splash of balsamic vinegar and a slice of Havarti cheese, and I bake them for 15-20 minutes and then broil for 1 minute to brown the cheese.  YUM YUM YUM!!!  A great light summer dinner served with fresh corn on the cob!

I had some large round tomatoes from the produce co-op and was making a simple oven meal, so I decided to give this a try. It was very easy, but it isn't a dish that I'll  prepare again. . .  It reminded me of a recipe I've used for baked tilapia.

These are very good and a delightfully simple side dish. I used a bit less mayo and left out the brown mustard. Instead of slices, I cut the tomatoes in half in a zig-zag fashion and pulled apart to make a pretty tomato cup.

Wow, so simple and quick. These tasted so much better than I was expecting.  I left out the mustard, cause that's just my taste preference.  Made this as a side dish with grilled sea bass.  Even my husband who isn't a fan of anything veggie went back for more of these.  I might try some slightly under ripe tomatoes next time and see if they stay a little firmer after baking.  Thank you, thank you for sharing this recipe!

We really liked this. I didn't have dijon, added bread cubes.
I think cooked bacon would be a good addition.

I changed it up a bit. Omitted the mustards and added Pepperidge Farm bread crumbs. Also added 1/2 tsp garlic. I don't even like tomatoes, but this was GOOD!

Quite tasty! I halved the recipe, but was still a little short on mayo, so I used some olive oil. Worked just fine. I also added a clove of garlic to it because my husband and I are big garlic eaters.  In addition, I added a fresh basil leaf and mushroom on top of the mixture before putting the cheese on and it was great. I ended up eating my son's share because he's 4 and thought they were too "spicy," but I would have eaten more!

A little too mushy for my taste. May try to do the broil method rather than baking for 10 minutes and broiling a few minutes at the end to brown the cheese.

This time of year I am always looking for ways to use wonderful summer tomatoes, which is what led me to this recipe.  I did make some changes based on personal preference.  I omitted the mustards and used an Italian seasoning blend instead of the oregano.  I also put the mozzarella and parsley in the mayonnaise mixture before spreading on the tomatoes.  In addition I halved my tomatoes, rather than slicing them and broiled them, instead of baking them.  After a few minutes under the broiler, my tomatoes were slightly warm throughout , but still firm, and not mushy at all.  We enjoyed this!

God, my husband LOVES these!  He said it was "the best new recipe I've tried all year!" (and, thanks to allrecipes.com, I've tried QUITE A FEW!) I make these quite often in the Summer. It's an EASY sidedish, which most people haven't seen/made before, (and they end up loving them!)  OK, for my husband & me, I only make 2-3 tomatoes at a time. So, I use 2 T. Honey Dijon mustard (& NO brown mustard) and extra shredded mozzarella (or even shredded Cheddar, if that's all you have!).  Only need to bake 10-12 minutes (watch carefully so they don't burn!)   Sprinkle with parsley AFTER they've baked.   So simple, but the baking really enhances the flavor of the tomato (& I don't even like tomatoes!)  They're good.

With tomatoes sliced thick, they did nto fall apart at all. I didn't use brown mustard, I didn't have any. I broiled them at the end for 2 minutes to get the mozzarela brown and bubbly, and they were fantastic!

This is SO much better than I expected!  It tasted like something from a restaurant.  The only thing I did differently was to use lite sour cream instead of mayo and pepper jack cheese instead of mozzarella.  Broil for a couple minutes for an amazing veggie appetizer!

These tomatoes were yummy! I omitted the Dijon mustard because I didn't have any. I also added some garlic powder to the mix. I cooked these on the grill. The cheese didn't brown before the tomatoes were soft. I will try them in the oven next time. Thanks!

These are delicious, and you can substitute whatever cheese you have on hand for mozzerella.  These are also excellent the next day paired with some salami and crusty, sturdy bread in sandwiches.

I love this recipe,a little oregano is great, and for an extra twist I added thinly sliced black olives over the top before the final layer of cheese. everybody is right, the thicker  slices work better.

This recipe was very easy. Tasted like a tomato pizza! I have made this recipe a couple of times. This time I added 1/4 cup of feta cheese and 1/4 cup of sliced mushrooms. It's very good as an appetizer or a side dish.

Very good recipe.  I omitted the brown mustard and the Dijon was just right.

This is so tasty and really easy. I wasn't careful enough with slice uniformity so two irregular slices had the topping slide off a little in the oven.

We absolutely loved these baked tomatoes! It calls for late summer ripe tomatoes but because it is baked I believe even during the  other seasons they will still be really good all year long!

YUM! Made exactly as written.  Perhaps the mustard is too strong  for some but I liked. Maybe try less next time.  Yes - broil on high last couple minutes!  I appreciate there is not bread crumbs or bulk added in.

My grandmother taught me to make these.  Thick sliced bright red Jersey beefsteak tomatoes.  She used extra virgin olive oil and just a splash of red wine vinegar instead of mayo and mustards.  She added finely chopped sweet onion on top. Topped with oregano, parsley and dusted with bread crumbs and a good Pecorino Romano cheese.  She served them cold as a salad or broiled (just to melt cheese) with a good steak dinner.

Really liked this, I modified it just a tad by using basil instead of the parsley and put a slice of crusty bread under each slice of tomato.
Delicious!

Not excellent, but pretty darn good. I did try to bake them at 375 so they would be done before getting mushy, cut them "fat" and didn't have brown mustard, but the rest was by the recipe. I'll do it again for something different.

really like these but I made a small change by using Romano cheese rather than Parmesan.  Great use of all my tomatoes that are coming on strong.

These really fell short.  The mayo and mustard were just not right - the mustard flavor was overpowering and didn't really seem to go with tomatoes.  These needed just breadcrumbs , some dry herbs and parmesan cheese.  I realize that is totally changing the recipe - but the recipe as written  did nothing for my palate.  Sorry because I love most everything  : )

I really don’t have much love for tomatoes, but these were delicious!  I had some juicy tomatoes, so before I bake them I dried them off with a paper towel. I only had the Dijon mustard on hand and they were delicious.

My husband and I absolutely loved these! After taking the first bite, he gave me a huge hug and said, "I love you so much. You learned how to make me healthy Pizza Bites." Haha! I'm not the biggest mustard or tomato fan so I was hoping, at best, to maybe tolerate them, but I didn't really taste too much mustard and we were both eating them like popcorn! I even microwaved the leftovers and ate them for breakfast the next day!

This was a great idea, however the tomato turned to mush.  Next time I will just put it under the broiler for a few minutes to melt and lightly brown the cheese.

Delicious!  I had an abundance of tomatoes from my garden and was looking for something to make for lunch. This was very good!  Only thing I will change next time is to slice the tomatoes thicker. I sliced like you would for a Sandwich and they got very soft.

We both enjoyed this dish.  I did sub fresh mozzarella as I didn't have any shredded.  (would have been even better with the shredded mozz). And I left out the mustards because I  didn't want that vinegary taste to clash with the lamb we were having.   I  will make it again and follow all the ingredients and it will probably be even better.

Very yummy way of using up some of our many garden tomatoes.  It says slices but the picture shows the tomatoes just cut in half which is what I did and would do again.  I actually used herbed goat cheese in the filling instead of the parmesan and mixed in the pulp (minus seeds) from inside the tomato.  I put parmesan cheese on top.  I might be tempted to put some crumbs on top too.  Don't overcook or the tomato may collapse and you could use your filling onto the cooking pan.

SO GOOD SO EASY. We enjoyed these. Surprised I liked the mayonnaise so much. But I did. The combination of the mustards and mayonnaise went well.. I used Dijon and whole grain because I had that. I liked this so much I am going to buy brown just to get proper effect. I did  in oven not broil because I had potatoes in , worked well.  Will bar b q also. ILoveIt

The family loved this new side made with very small, 6" tomatoes, which were all I had.  I will definitely make it again.  I had to cut the recipe down so much that I guessed at the mustard amounts, but I turned out fine.

These are amazing. I didn't use the mustards (not a mustard fun). Definitely keeping this recipe!

These were the Best, my daughter and I both loved them. Since it was only the two of us I halved the recipe.  I sliced each tomato into 3 slices, nice and thick.  I did not have brown mustard so I doubled the Dijon, I think this was perfect(seeing that some said there was too much mustard taste with the brown).  I covered top of tomato with mozzarella(more than called for) and used dried parsley on top.  This was a nice addition to the T-bones that we grilled.  Oh, one more thing, I did preheat the oven to 350 but then as I put them in I turned it to broil for about 4 mins. Some said the baking made them to soggy, no soggy here. The tomatoes stayed firm and nicely browned.  I have two more nice tomatoes, I may just have to make this again tomorrow.  :)  *****made again and this time I used Mama Prancesca's Parmesan & Garlic grated cheese for the reg parm. Yummy

This was so delicious and hearty! The flavor had such zip and paired really well with bland quinoa for a super dinner. Like the other reviewers I turned on the broiler for the last few minutes.

I absolutely love this recipe! I only make a few changes, and that is only when I have to improvise the ingredients. I do broil them instead of baking. I also add a bit of dried bread crumbs to the mix. Being from the St. Louis area, I have the luxury of being able to buy Provel cheese. It is a creamier, version of provolone or mozzarella. There are just so many things you can do with this! They are just wonderful! Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful idea!!

I really do not like tomatoes, so I took a risk making this. Turns out, I will never eat another whole tomato unless it is made this way! I did not add the brown mustard, and it turned out great. My husband did not like these though-he thought they were a bit too tart.

These were really good and a really easy way to use up some garden tomatos. I did omit the brown mustard because I forgot to add it. I did add some minched garlic and next time I will add even more. We will be making these all summer.

It was very soft and the tomatoes fell apart as soon as a fork hit them. But will try again just not baking maybe with some olive oil in the skillet to firm them up first.

I tried this recipe last night,  I cut the recipe in half because there is only the two of us, it was delicious, even my husband enjoyed the dish, there was only one thing wrong - I did not make enough, I will do the full recipe next time. I know this will be a big hit with my friends. I will probably make it again tonight

I really enjoyed these tomatoes (even though they were a bit on the soggy side) I will definately be making these again. Heck, my husband even ate one and he normally wont eat veggies unless its a salad.

The flavor was good but too much of the seasoning on top and the tomatoes needed to be thicker to be cooked at that time level.

These were very good the only changes I made was to add ricotta cheese ( I wanted to clean it out of the fridge ) and to use roma tomato's that I already had in the fridge, I cut them in half and cleaned out the seeds to make almost like a bowl for the filling.  They were great and gone in no time at all.

Pretty good.  I like the topping and the fresher the tomatoes, the better.  Good recipe - thanks!
