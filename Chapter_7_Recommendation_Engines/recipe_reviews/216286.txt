Now that I make this as a lighter version, I make a hot cocoa with half nonfat milk and fat free evaporated milk, homemade sugar-free chocolate syrup, homemade irish cream with peppermint flavoring and peppermint schnapps. It's very minty and quite rich tasting with half the fat. This is one of my most favorite winter "indulgences" with half the guilt.
