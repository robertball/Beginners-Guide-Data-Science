I had a little more than a cup of cranberry sauce so i matched that in sweet potatoes. I also used flax eggs instead of eggs. Mixed those first 3 together and let sit for 5 minutes. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I also cut back on the sugars and added the flour by 1/2c. increments. I think i used about 2 1/2c. of flour, which was whole wheat. I made this recipes as muffins. I filled my muffin pan and almost forgot the raisins so i added them on top and pushed them in lol! Baked at 375 for 24 minutes, they were fantastic!!
