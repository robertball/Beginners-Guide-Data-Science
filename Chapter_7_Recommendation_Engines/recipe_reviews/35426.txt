My favorite Cantonese recipe! Also is great with just scallions, ginger, and garlic.

This recipe is great!!  I didn't have ground pork so I left it out and it still turned out flavorful.  I did add some chopped cilantro leaves at the end of cooking just because we loved cilantro.  Definitely a recipe to keep, thanks Alison!

I've now made this about 10 times. I've drifted from the recipe a few times, but the best taste comes from this recipe as is. Those who question sausage + lobster really have to just give this a try - it's worth the risk.   Wanna spice it up - add some cajun seasoning or cayenne pepper...and a splash of hot sauce. Delicious with or without!

Just made it over the weekend and it was superb.  A few tips to add to this recipe: Add more cooking time, say 6-7 minutes as my lobster came up just a little on the raw side - or cook it with pan covered.  The skin of the lobster should turn bright red thoughout.  I used vermouth instead of sherry, vegetable oil instead of peanut oil.  Came out just fine.  =)

I have been killing/cooking lobsters for 40 years. Next time try to put it in the freezer then turn it over and put a very sharp knife into the soft area where the tail meets the body. When you do that it cuts the spinal cord and the lobster dies. You will also find a "sack" behind the eyes. DO NOT EAT THAT. That is the stomach. Pull it out and discard. I hope this helps.

I was very confused since I had live lobsters so I put it in the freezer to make it sleepy, turns out though they are sleepy they still flop around when that happens. I was too spooked after it almost gave me a heart attack by coming "back to life".

I had a Chinese grandma, too.  This is definitely in the realm of authentic.  In our family, the base flavor comes from Black Bean sauce instead of just soy.  I think the flavors are more intense.  I also use more garlic, more ginger, more pork and more egg.  It stretches the lobster.

I had some leftover cooked lobsters in the fridge and was looking for a recipe that wasn't loaded with butter or heavy cream!  So the only change I made to this recipe was to use pre-cooked lobsters instead of cooking the meat with the ginger.  My boyfriend and I LOVED this and can't wait to make it again!  Not only was it easy but it had AMAZING flavor!  Definitely a must try!  Thanks for sharing!

Cook this recipe 7 it 8 times already over the last few years! Love this recipe and have cravings for it every now and then. Since the sauce is good, I usually cook some Asian noodles ( boil in water then blanch in cold water) and mix with the sauce to soak up all the wonderful juices so that's lobster noodle dish or Chinese call it "yee mien" Imade this dish several times using singleness crab as well, also very delicious!

This recipe is superb. I used oyster sauce instead of the soy sauce and it tasted great. This is the 1st time I cooked lobster, the problem I encountered was the meat became chewy(?) I dont know if I over or undercoooked it.

It was really good. I made it for our wedding anniversary dinner. My husband loved it. Thank you. I added two more garlics and ginger and a bit more soya sauce at the end.

I made this for Easter Sunday for my husband and me.  I followed the recipe exactly and we both just loved it.  It reminded me of one of my favorite meals at a wonderful NY restaurant, Hankow's, that mom and I would go to at least once a month when I was growing up.  Thanks for the memories and for this recipe, Alison.

Delish! Worked with two thawed lobster tails cut up. Just decrease lobster cook time to 3-4 mins initially since it will cook more when you add it to the sauce. If you like a saltier lobster cantonese, cut the brown sugar in half or take it out all together.

I made this for my son and I for Chinese New Year dinner and I  followed the recipe almost exactly but the only changes that I made was that I used four lobster tails split in halves and used sesame oil to stir fry .
This recipe is delish we loved it !!!! 
Next time I make it I will use the exact recipe with Lobster tails though :)
