This was easy, different, and really tasty.  I live in Italy and so it is difficult to come across a new pasta dish that we haven't already tried.  I think I will try this one out on some Italians just to see what they say.

This was quick, easy, and tasty.  You can't go wrong with the simplicity of this recipe.  We are very busy with the kids' activities so I am always looking for something to "whip up".

Certainly easy and edible, but not much flavor.  I was disappointed in the lack of spice in the sauce (used Classico's brand) and should have added some crushed red pepper as it simmered.  Could also have benefitted from some Italian seasonings with the browning chicken.  Without the fresh basil it would have been a dud for me, but it was definitely a well-balanced, easy and inexpensive dinner.

Was very simple to make, it only took me 30 minutes to prepare.  My daughter, a picky eater, gobbled it right down and my husband told me it tasted excellent, like something you would eat in a restaurant!!

Made this without the onions for family's preference, added diced tomatoes instead. Couldn't find cavatapi noodles at my store, so I used hidden veggie twisted noodles, and the dish was great. My whole family loved it.

Wow! For such an easy, simple dinner; this certainly tasted equisite. It took me 35 minutes total! Ground chicken was certainly interesting; that was a first for me.

My family thought this was great.  I don't usually buy ground chicken but I think I will add it to the regular grocery list.  Easy, healthy & delicious.  I did add some cayenne pepper and italian herb blend to season the chicken.  And I added zucchini and spinach in with the sauce.
