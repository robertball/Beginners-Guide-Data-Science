I doubled the recipe & made alterations to the recipe - using 1/2 olive oil & 1/2 coconut oil & added 1 Teaspoon cinnamon, 1 cup pecans to topping and  1 cup dark choc chips with the 85% dark choc blocks chopped up and drizzled fudge sauce over top before baking in a 9.5"x15" pan.  I also used 1 1/2 C fresh boysenberries placed on 1/2 batter & spooned remaining batter over the layer.  Baked for 34" & it was too die for!

Made over a campfire! Took a longer time to prepare (about an hour at the fire's edge, turning it every now and again), but it made a perfect surprise camping birthday cake for a friend!

Added walnuts :-)

I did not use the pumpkin seeds. This recipe was so easy. If I made this again I would let it bake a tad longer and fold the chocolate chips into the batter instead of just having them on top. I would like to try substituting apple sauce for the oil. Overall this was a good recipe.

I left out the pumpkin seeds. I had some crushed pineapple in whipped cream icing that I used up for the cake, just loved the taste... and so healthy!!
