Yum!  Sinful and awesome.  One tip:  only use the recommended pan size.  I used a smaller pan the first time I made them, hoping to make fatter brownies, and it did NOT work out.  But with the right pan size the second time they were perfect.

Oh my gosh, these brownies were terrible.  I thought as a surprise I would make my kids dessert.  After dinner I gave them these brownies.  My daughters tried to be polite, but gave them the thumbs down and spit them out! I'm a foody and love to cook and anybody can tell you dump bars are awful. They are wayyyyyyyyy..... toooo.... Dry and crumble in your hands. It's like eating styrofoam, only this is worse.  Save your time, and your cocoa powder! Two thumbs down.

WOW! These are amazing! I needed something fast last night to bake for my dh lunch today. As soon as I took them out of the oven, the kids were eating them! I did add 1/2 the chips to the batter and right after I took them out of the oven I used a strainer and dusted powdered sugar on top. Here is a hint to cut hot brownies, *use a plastic knife and they will cut nice without sticking!  I will be making these often and highly recommend! Thanks for the great recipe!

6, 7, 8 stars? I wish I could give it more!
Delicious brownie, easy and so quick to make. I couldn't stand the idea of putting a full cup of oil so I did half canola oil and half apple sauce and it is just FANTASTIC!!
(Edited to add that I did make it with the full cup of oil one time and it was very nice that way too! Still a BIG lunchbox hit!)

THE BEST BROWNIES FROM SCRATCH EVER!!! I love how these only needed a few ingredients that you are likely to always have on hand!  I threw some crumbled chocolate bars and peanut butter cups left over from OCT 31 and some caramel apple dip on top and VOILA!  These were to die for...no need for mixes anymore!

Very impressive!! I used 2 Jumbo eggs and 1 Large egg-they came out very fudgy and yummy!! I also put some flour on the chocolate chips so they wouldn't sink to the bottom. Definitely a keeper for quick brownies!!

I have an almost identical recipe in a cookbook, and I use it all the time!  I use slightly more flour (which yields a fatter cakeier brownie) and more chocolate chips than the recipe calls for.  I also have tried mixing in 1/2 a bag of chips, then sprinkling the other half on top.  It's hard to go wrong with these bars!

These turned out fantastically! Very moist, and did not have the problem as some others of chocolate chips sinking. If you follow the directions EXACTLY they should turn out fine. Many of the poor reviews are from people who admittedly did not follow directions, which is disappointing. This recipe does not deserve bad reviews at all! Yes, they are more cakelike, but they are called Dump Bars, not brownies. I realize the submitter said they were the best brownies, but they're not really intended to be. I happen to enjoy fluffier, cakelike textures so this was a perfect in-between. To the person who said they weren't sweet enough, it's because of all the extra cocoa powder you used. Cocoa powder is BITTER (try eating it by itself!) Next time, everyone, follow the recipe and they will be great! You should all try again if you didn't like it. Also, I did try another time as well with half the chocolate chips mixed into the batter and the other half on top as others suggested and it was fantastic!

Whoah.  I added the 1/2 cup choco chips to the batter and I always try to make things a bit healthier.  I replaced 1/2 cup of the oil with applesauce and used whole wheat flour instead of white.  Now if I could replace some of the sugar we'd be good to go!  But a GREAT and super super simple recipe.  VERY impressed.  I might gain 5 lbs tonight from binging on these things!!!

WOW.  These aren't fudgy, chewy brownies, but the cook who posted it never said they would be! So if you rated the recipe low because it wasn't what you expected, you need to go read the description again.  It is indeed an awesome brownie--rich, moist, and delicious.  Only change I made was to use half butter, half oil, and to add some chopped pecans to the batter.  They were absolutely delicious.  I especially like the slightly crunchy top crust.  Instant hit at my house!

These brownies are soooooooooo good!!!
They only take a few minutes to mix up and bake.  I added 1/2 c. of chopped pecans since I like nuts.

Big on the Easy, Little on the taste... I followed the recipe exactly, used quality ingredients (Hershey's cocoa & Ghirardelli chocolate chips) and the taste was just bland and the texture "rough" - not a fudgey browny or a cakey one, or anything inbetween... Next time I'll use one of my more time consuming recipes for a great tasting 
brownie.

This recipe is fantastic!  It's so easy to put together, and it tastes great!  I didn't have any chocolate chips on hand and even without the chips it was still great!!  You might want to make 2 when you make these because they will be gobbled up fast!

very very good recipe.  I served these to 185 people at work for a fundraiser and got rave reviews?  I'm not quite sure why there are a few nay sayers on here about how bad these are?  They managed to make 185 people smile at work?? Great recipe!!

Easy, appetizing bar to make, made with oil instead of butter, chewy bar. I made it for Tim Cowan's benefit. Would make again.

So gooey and delicious!  I added a chocolate bar with nuts on the top of the brownies before I put them in the oven.  I had to cut up the bar first.  I live in Europe and I don't know where to find chocolate chips or toffee chips.  :)

These were easy and very good! I didn't measure my chocolate chips - I just put in about "that much." Perfect! I used someone else's suggestion of flouring my chocolate chips to keep them from sinking, and it worked great! I'd never heard that before. I will definitely be using this recipe again and again!

very easy to make..
i didn't want to use 5 eggs (and we didn't need that many brownies), so i cut the recipe in half and only used 2 eggs. they're good, but not the best ever.

Excellent brownie recipe, easy and comes out perfect every time!  I usually put in a few extra chips because we are choco-holics.  I like to double this recipe and when the brownies are cooled, I cut them up and put in the freezer.  They are actually quite good straight from the freezer, or microwaved if you like them warm.  Makes a good lunchbox treat too.

the only thing i didn't like about these was that they used up half my eggs! haha. they were very moist, and  contrary to what other reviewers have said, quite chewy. if i could afford the eggs, i'd make these all the time ;)

These brownies are a huge hit everytime I make them.  Sometimes I add white chocolate chipc or carmel Hershey kisses.

I've used this recipe a couple times and it always a hit! Everyone loves the texture, right in between chewy and cakey. AND it's a fast & easy recipe. PERFECT!

I have made these for years and my family loves them. Only thing I do different is what I was taught with this recipe years ago: they are called dump bars...no need to mix things seperately! Just "dump" it all in one bowl and mix with a spoon not a mixer. I also make mine with mini choc chips instead of the standard sized ones, to me they turn out much better with that one change.

I didn't have any butter, so I was looking for a brownie recipe that didn't call for butter - this was it!  I was a little leary of using 5 eggs, but it was great.  I added maybe  close to a quarter cup more of the cocoa powder and this turned out great!

Chewy, rich, easy recipe.  I prefer a little icing on my brownies though, which I could easily add.  Makes large quantity (9x13 pan).  Attractive bars with chocolate chip topping.  Addition of caramel chips or other flavour might be nice too.

I tried this brownie recipe because it uses vegetable oil instead of butter ( I was out of butter).  Very good.  Nice rich chocolate flavor and very moist.  I don't know for sure, but I think I kind of miss the butter over the oil.  My husband loved them and was craving another batch tonight!

Not bad brownies at all, but more cake-like than fudgey, and I'm a fudgey fan.  If you're looking for a fudgey recipe, try Deep Dish Brownies, my favorites so far. I mixed in half the chips and sprinkled the rest of top, and they turned out alright; I would still add more chips for flavor, however.

This is a very good brownie recipe!!  I would especially recommend it to those taking a dessert dish to picnic or other outdoor gathering because it is easy to distribute.  It is very chewy and does not have all that sugary frosting.  I did add a 1/2 cup of nuts, but wished later that I had put in a cup, there wasn't quite enough.  I received several compliments (men especially like this brownie--maybe because it has more substance and less frosting).  Thank you for sharing!!

These dump bars were like a dull chocolate cake without frosting. They werent fudge-like at all. I put a whole bag of peanut butter chips on top instead of chocolate chips but that didnt serve to make them moist. The chips didnt even melt. Very dry.

Made this last night for movie night. Delicious! I was short about 3 tbsp of enough vegetable oil but went with what I had and they turned out so good. We will definitely make these again. YUMMO to the TUMMO.

I have made these brownies several times, and they are wonderful every time! I love that I always have the ingredients on hand and I like that the brownies are more "cake like" and not as chewy. They are also good with peanut butter chips sprinkled on top. This is definitely a family favorite!!

I printed this recipe several years ago, and it has become a mainstay at our house. My son has even requested this as his birthday "cake". It is super-simple to make, and I like the fact that it uses oil instead of butter. You can also sprinkle chopped nuts on top if you like nutty brownies.

I've been trying to find a really great homemade brownie.. sadly, this was not it for us! The texture was more like a cake, not chewy & gooey like brownies should be. And they were not nearly sweet enough, even though I added a little over 2 cups sugar and closer to 3/4 cup cocoa. Also, the chips settled to the bottom while baking and the majority of them just melted to the bottom of the pan instead of really remaining in the brownie. They were not terrible but definately not what I was hoping for! Boxed brownies actually would have been better.

The search is over!! I have been trying to find the perfect brownie recipe for years now and I have finally found it! I followed the recipe exactly HOWEVER to add some decorative flare instead of using just semi-sweet chocolate chips I used some white chocolate chips and mixed chocolate chips and once the brownies had cooled down I sprinkled some icing sugar on top. LOVED the final product. I was decorating a tray and I had a piece left over. I decided that I'd eat half and give the other half to my mother to try. I ended up eating her half aswell! Irresistible; good for all ages! Thanks for posting! :D

Love the Recipe, easy...Few changes I made: I added 1/2 cup butter + 1/2 oil instead of just oil, added some grated chocolate as I did not have choc chips. I made some mini cupcakes and they were delicious!

these are delicious. they taste a little cakey because of how many eggs are in them but this doesn't take away from how chocolatey they are.  i made them with about 1/4 cup brown sugar and doubled the amount of chocolate chips and ate them hot with mint chocolate chip ice cream.. the texture of the dump bar is perfect for ice cream. you have to try it

SO GOOD!!! This will be my third time making them and the whole pan has been disapearing within 3 days. Try using butterscotch chips... delicious! The last time I made these I was rushing and mixed the chips into the batter. DO NOT DO THIS! LOL. It formed a butterscotch brick like thing at the bottom of the pan and were not that great. If you follow the recipe EXACTLY the way it is written you will have mouthwatering brownies. This is definatly the new standard brownie recpie in our house, and its as easy as a box mix!

I just finished eating some of these brownies along with a big glass of milk and I have to say they almost taste like the store bought mixes. I didn't have any chocolate chips though so if they had them I would of probably given this recipe five stars. I used a frosting recipe (from this site) to replace the chocolate chips,and overall it was pretty good. I don't think I will make these again unless I have chocolate chips though because it definitly need them.

The recipe is indeed easy to make. The bars come out soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  They are easy to cut and serve.  The only thing lacking, I think, is the buttery taste that is missing in those scrumptious brownies that use real butter in the recipe.

These were extremely good! I was looking for a recipe which wouldn't end up being too dry in the end and these were very moist and chewy even days later. My new favorite brownie recipe.

This recipe has a permanent place in my recipe holder. Even when my family was in the process of moving, I could fix up a pan of these for a craving, because the ingredients are so simple. I've also decorated a pan as a cemetary for hallowe'en, with short bread tombstones. Versatile easy recipe!

These are the best brownies I've ever had.  I also made these using peanut butter chips, and they were very good that way too.  Next time, I'm going to try using both chocolate chips and peanut butter chips.

These definately went fast. I thought they could use a little more cocoa because a few bites tasted a little like flour. Everyone else loved them though.

I've made this recipe for awhile now and always get rave reviews. I like to add more than just choc chips on the top. I often use chopped almonds, butter brickle chips and choc chips. I like this recipe because I can use it anyway I want.

While making this recipe, I noticed it seemed very familiar to me. Come to find out, this recipe is VERY similar to a brownie recipe printed in Taste of Home's Quick Cooking magazine "1999 Collector's Edition". The only difference in the two recipes is the amount of flour used. The Quick Cooking recipe calls for 1 3/4 cups of flour. In any case, both recipes worked well for me and enjoyed by my family.

This is a good brownie, but not a great brownie.  If I could rate it on ease alone, I would have given it five stars.  The taste was nice and chocolatey.  I have made it twice and found better sucess by mixing the chips into the batter.  Both times left me a little diasppointed with the consistency as it was a little dense and cakey.  Not very chewy as you might expect a great brownie to be.  I would make again if I needed browines in a hurry, but not if I am trying to impress.

I made these bars for 40 high school cross country runners spaghetti dinner at my home. They were gone within 10 minutes of setting them out! I think you must add the chocolate chips or they would just be OK. Thanks for a great recipe!

These brownies are the best- really moist and chocolaty. There really easy to make too. I also put little bits of caramels on top-really good. I'll definitely be making these again.

These brownies are good.  When I baked them, I sprinkled 1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips on a third, 1/3 cup white chocolate chips on another third, and milk chocolate chips on the last third. They were all good - although my girlfriend's kids really liked the white chocolate ones best. I liked the MMM MMM Better Brownies better than these though. But these were a close second.

Really good with ingredients you usually have on hand, mixed up quick, cut nicely.  Its really a brownie, name bit 
Offputting.  I added twice amount of chips to use up butterscotch and chocolate, finely shredded coconut on top.

I used a tad more flour (1.5 cups) per another reviewer's suggestion, used an 8x12 pan because I like slightly thicker brownies, and baked them for the full 35 minutes. We had friends over that night. The wife, who looks like she's about 95 pounds, usually skips desserts or eats just a little to be polite. She ate three of these brownies.  I absolutely love the flavor, texture, and everything else.  I agree with the reviewer who wrote, "I'm never making package brownies again."

Very good!  My whole family loved them!  However, next time I will bake them at 325, rather than 350.  They outsides were a little dry and burnt, and the insides were fudge-like.

These are yummy and easy. They are a cake brownie, not a fudgy brownie. I love the cake brownie so I was very happy with this recipe. I only put in 1 1/2 cups sugar and it was plenty sweet.

Amazing! So good I had to give a review for the first time ever!I wanted a simple recipe that didn't call for butter and used cocoa powder. No need to alter the recipe at all! My family adores it and I can't wait to share it with all my friends and family too!

Wow! These brownies are to die for! I made them yesterday and the whole pan is almost gone! I followed the recipie exactly and used the advise on the plastic knife-what a great idea! There is no need to buy they box brownies anymore, with this recipie I already had everything on hand, and they are way better!

These were great, we thought, as is.  I'm not a big fan of chocolate chips all over everything, I tend to like brownies without frosting or sugar on top.  I cut down substanially on the choc. chips the first time and you can do this, but be aware we felt the brownies needed the extra sweetness.  If I do that again, I will add a bit of brown sugar to these.  I'm not a big fan of overly sweet either, but I felt w/o the chips they were lacking something.  I made them as is the second time and they were wonderful!  Quick and easy after school baking.  I've made them once a week for the last several weeks at the request of my teenager.  This is my first recipe on allrecipes.com that I haven't wanted to tweak in some way, good stuff.

Definitely agree these are super brownies. Practically as easy as a box mix and perfect texture. So far I've sprinkled grated 72% cocoa dark chocolate on top, mixed it into the batter and sprinkle Heath Bar toffee bits on top in the three times I've made them (since I found the recipe the beginning of July). Lots of compliments!

This is my go-to recipe when I need a desert and want to use items that I always have on hand. I have made this recipe many, many times and every time it has been a hit.  I bring this to potlucks or barbecues quite often and am always asked for the recipe.  I like to use half milk and half white chocolate chips on the top, or once in awhile I'll make some chocolate frosting and omit the chips in the recipe.  These always come out moist and perfectly done, and I live at a high altitude so its hard to find brownies that cook correctly here.

Wonderful. I have made them 2 times this week so far. I made them following the recipe the 1st time. The second time I poured half of the batter, then added the chocolate chips in the middle and poured on the rest of the batter. It tasted MUCH better that way even though they already taste great! I even see "dieting" family members sneeking 2 pieces.

Yum! I added an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and an extra tsp of vanilla and 1 cup of walnuts. Because I used a dark glass pan I baked mine @ 325 for about 45 mins.

These were pretty good. A little dense, we thought. They seemed more like a cake than a brownie. They were still pretty good though.

these brownies are very easy to make and bake up nice and chewy, a breeze to prepare. however, they are not the best brownies, as the use of oil takes away from the flavor of these bars. they would be really scrumptious if you used butter. oil just doesn't do it. 
    I always ice my brownies with a chocolate icing. 
    good, but not the best.

We loved these brownies! We sprinkled chocolate chips and walnuts on the top before baking. They were very easy to make and tasted delicious. It makes a good amount too...more than a box of brownie mix.

These were very good and easy.  Needed something to make for a bake sale at the last minute and found these on the site.  Thought they sounded good so gave it a try and made 2 pans.  They were the first thing to sell. Ended up forgetting a plate at home and my husband and I got to sample one also.  I have another pan in the oven right now.  Yum!

These were just okay for us.  They were moist but I only baked for 20 minutes.  I really did not like the chocolate chips on the top and my husband thought they were just too chocolatey.  Thanks for letting us try.

Well, I kind of flopped on this recipe and it was totally due to my lack of ingredients. All I had was whole wheat flour, which I knew would not produce that yummy brownie taste I was looking for, but I went ahead and used it anyway. Instead of chocolate chips, I used peanut butter kisses that I pushed down all over the top before baking. This did not turn out as moist as I would have liked, but again, that was my mistake.  My 4 year old just loved this, so it was worth making just for her. Thanks for sharing.

My husband loved these!!

I added the chips to the batter with a few walnuts.  I also substituted about a 1/4 cup of the oil with walnut oil.  Had to use liquid eggs, too.  Came out a little chewy and VERY moist... My husband closed his eyes while he ate one!!

Good texture, moist with a chewy crust. But not really very chocolatey, light brown color. I used Hershey's and didn't add the chips because my kids don't like them too sweet. I would try it again, but might use more cocoa or a better grade.

I can't make these very often because I have a hard time eating them in moderation.  I always use either x-large, or jumbo size eggs, and this recipe always bakes up very moist and fudgy.  In addition to the chocolate chips on top, I'll occassionally sprinkle a bag of Heath Bar Bits on top the last 2 minutes of the baking time.  Great recipe, Barb.  Thank you!

This is pretty close to the ultimate brownie! If you leave the chocolate chips out, it's too dry but with the chocolate chips, it's great. Still looking for something more fudgy but that's just my preference. I think most people like them cakey. Haven't had any complaints though so I'll give it five stars!

Well, I thought these weren't bad but hubby thought they were dry and wouldn't take them to work.  He might have just taken out an end piece, though.  Really, they aren't bad and they are pretty easy.  I needed to use up eggs and this was a good way to do it, seeing as though the recipe calls for FIVE!  :)

These are so easy to make and awesome!  I made them quickly to take to a Graduation party.  Then I found out I didn't have any chocolate chips.  I used 2 blocks each of almond bark and chocolate flavoring and shaved them on the top.  It looked really pretty and everyone loved them! You have to try these! *****

This brownie was not as rich and fudgy as I had hoped. Swirling Hershey syrup on top gave it a little more sweetness and flavor.

Quick, easy and delicious!  Like many baked items, although they kept for a couple of days, I found they were really at their best the day I baked them.  Also, I used a little less oil than called for and they were still very moist.  My only complaint--that name has got to go!!!  How about "Totally Awesome Brownies". . .
