This recipe is fluffy and rich.  Next time, however, I'll try melting the chocolate and marshmallow together.  When I added the hot marshmallow to the melted chocolate it seized up.  I stirred and stirred but still had chocolate chunks.  It didn't hurt the flavor, but I would have preferred the mousse without the chocolate chunks.  Don't let this stop you from trying it however.  It's really delicious!

I had some leftover mini marshmallows and 2 bars of bittersweet chocolate that I wanted to use up. After doing an ingredient search I found this recipe. I really was surprised how well it turned out. Very simple to make and it was pretty tasty. I melted the marshmallows and chocolate together to prevent lumps. Then based a another review, I used the mousse to fill cream puffs for Valentine's Day. Boy was my husband happy,he loves chocolate and mint. While it was not the best mousse I have ever had, but it was the easiest and was good tasting.

This recipe is very easy to follow - great for cooking novices like me!  I have a sweet tooth so I used ghirardelli milk chocolate baking chips instead of bittersweet, and traded the peppermint extract for a dash of vanilla extract and a cap-full of irish cream.  So delish!!  Definitely not a calorie-saver, but worth every delicious spoonful!

While the taste of this was ok, it did not have the consistency of traditional mousse.  When the marshmallows were added to the chocolate, lumps formed, which ended up as chunks and bits in the final product.  I might try using marshmallow cream next time.  Worth another try with some modifications.

This recipe was amazing!  I used a mixture of dark & white chocolate instead of the bittersweet, but this dessert was still quite delicious.

I used 1C dark chocolate chips, one whole egg Beaton, 1/2 C sugar, 2t vanilla bourbon, 3T brandy in blender. On stove over low heat, 1C heavy whipping cream, 1pkg of Knox unflavored gelatin sprinkled over cream to soften. Heat cream but DO NOT BOIL! When hot, whisk until gelatin is dissolved. Pour hot cream into blender to melt chocolate and cook egg. Add about 1/2 C ice cubes into blender. Blend well. Pour into small cups or dessert glasses and refrigerate at least 15 minutes. Use whipped cream on top. Enjoy!

I made this for a friend's birthday party - fabulous! I made two batches - the second without the mint and both were delicious. I took advice from here and melted the marshmallows with the chocolate but over hot water not in the microwave. A great, very easy recipe. I'll definitely be doing this again.
