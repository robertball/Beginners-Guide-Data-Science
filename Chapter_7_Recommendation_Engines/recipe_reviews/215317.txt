This was so simple!!! I just put it in the crockpot. Set my crockpot for 8 hours and left it to cook. This is my first trial at pumpkin butter. I canned it in little jars. The recipe yielded 8 of the small jars (

It was a very easy pumpkin butter (after the pumpkin was cut up) recipe, but the spices were too much.  It's almost bitter and I think that it's because of the clove.  When I try this again, I will cut down on the spices.  Also, it would be nice to know WHAT exactly is a serving.

Wonderful flavor!  I had already baked and scraped my pumpkin before reading this recipe, so the pumpkin I put in the crock pot wasn't raw and in chunks.  That's why I only left it to slow cook for 4 hours.  It came out thick and just sweet enough!  Great recipe.

Delicious! I used 1-2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, instead of cloves and allspice seasonings. My first time making pumpkin butter and using a fresh pumpkin! This was so yummy! I had baked my pumpkin before coming across this recipe.  So, I slow cooked for abour 4 hours on low, then used the immersion blender to make it smooth. Extremely easy and made the house smell good!  I did use brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon. I just eyeballed the spices and tasted if it needed more.  Remember to use a little bit of spices at a time, you can always add more if it needs it. We used it on homemade biscuits, in oatmeal, on french toast too. So good!

This recipe needed help.  For one, it needs to use brown sugar, not white.  It has way too much cloves.  It's also missing ginger and nutmeg.  I added some fresh ginger puree and also ground.  I added freshly ground nutmeg as well. I had to boost the cinnamon also.

Just use pumpkin pie spice and if you have none, use one of the two recipes here on the site.  One uses all spice and one does not.

Make sure you're using a "pie" or "sugar" pumpkin.  A better way to cook the pumpkin, in my opinion, is to roast it.  Wash it, slice off the stem, place it flat-side down (where you just cut off the stem), and slice in half.  Gut it (save the seeds for roasted seeds!), and place it face down on a baking sheet lined with foil or parchment paper.  Roast at 425 for about an hour, until the peel is wrinkly and loose.  Cool slightly, and the peel just come right off. Then puree it in a food processer, blender, or push through a ricer.

Then take that puree and make the butter.

I also added butter to my recipe, which made it richer.  A bit of vanilla extract brightens it, too.

Great way to make pumpkin butter.  I will adjust the seasonings next time to our taste, but otherwise it turned out perfect.  After sone research I found that you can can this in a hot water bath.  Process quarts 40 minutes.

I used 2 tsp of cloves instead of the 1 Tbsp it called for, and it was still way too much.
It needs a pinch of salt, another cup of sugar, preferably brown, and a little less cinnamon. This coming from someone who always adds more spices to things, and this was too much. 
However, the texture was fantastic. The recipe just needs some tweaking.

So wonderful! I made quite a few batches. When it came to make the pies I did have to add just a bit more sugar but a wonderful way to preserve your pumpkin! Thanks!

Super easy and delicious.  Just a few minor changes based on the other reviews, used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar.  5lbs of pumpkin was a pretty large pumpkin.  I used less spices at first and then added more later.  I also canned using hot water bath for 20 min.

Made my house smell AMAZING. The next time I make this, I'll add more sugar, as it wasn't quite sweet enough for our tastes. Although, that could be solved by using a smaller, sweeter pumpkin next time too. As it is, "next time" will be a long way off, since this makes a VAT-FULL.

This was great. I cooked in crock pot for 9 hours just because I didn't get to it right at 8 hours. I used pumpkin pie spice in place of all the other spices. I used mostly brown sugar with 1/4 cup white sugar. I also only used about 1/2 the sugar mixture to start then added some at end just to taste. Since I don't have an immersion blender, I blended in a bullet style blender just about a cup at a time so that it didn't explode from the heat when I removed the lid. It came out so creamy & I didn't have to blend it long to get it to the right texture.

read all the reviews before I made it, 1tbs of cloves is excessive! That is one spice where a little goes a long way. I started with 1/2 tsp and added a little more. I smelled it about an hour into cooking and decided it was still too much cloves, I ended up adding about a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to even it out. 
I had a hard time getting a 5lb pumpkin, ended up with a little more than a 4lb and a little more than a 1lb. In the end it only yielded 6 8oz jars to can. 

I think you could go as far as 6lb worth of pumpkin with the amount of spice this recipe calls for.

I thought the spices where a bit much.  My tongue goes numb when I taste it.  But, my husband and his coworkers really like it.  No numbness.  This is not a sweet recipe.,which I like.  My husband would prefer really sweet pumpkin butter.

I think this is very good.  I put my crock-pot on low so it took 28 hours-next time I make it I will put it higher or start it the night before.  I did not use the Allspice because it has cinnamon in it, so I used a tsp of ginger and a tsp of nutmeg instead.  I didn't level off my cinnamon, which I will next time.  I will use this recipe again.

My first time ever making any kind of butter. My rating is based on the recipe as stated.  I think that the spices would have been way too much. So here is what I did:  cut the cloves back to 2 teaspoons instead of the 2 tablespoons it called for.  Used equal amounts of brown and white sugar.  Hardest part was preparing the pumpkin.   Can't wait to share it with my friends.

There was way too much clove. It overpowered the pumpkin. I'd use half the amount next time.

I have to say I wasn't "wowed" by this recipe.  I did roast my pumpkin in the oven ahead of time and used the crockpot for only 4 hours because the pumpkin was already cooked.  The flavor of this butter is ok...but the texture is way off.  It's so thick, not spreadable at all.  I made biscuits this weekend and planned to have this butter on them...but, it was not right.  Now, I have to find a way to thin the butter out to spreading consistency?  I don't want to just add water because it will dilute the flavors, adding butter would cause the calorie/fat content to go through the roof.  I'm thinking that I'm going to repurpose this into a no-bake pumpkin pie.  The consistency is actually thicker than pie right now!  I won't be making this again.  From now on, I will use my home made pumpkin puree in much better ways.

Made this with my son's preschool class. It was a huge hit with all the kids. My only suggestion would be to hold back on some of the cinnamon.
