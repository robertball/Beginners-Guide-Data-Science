I made this after Thanksgiving and am making it again tonight. I just used the stock I made from the turkey carcass and the leftover turkey off the bird. My very picky 8 yr old gobbled it right up. It's easy enough to make on a regular basis using chicken or just picking up turkey wings & drumsticks at the store.

This is a great way to use up turkey in a way that doesn't remind you of Thanksgiving. My husband doesn't like leftover turkey, says it has a taste, but he loved this dish.
I just had one turkey leg and made half the recipe. I did have to add a lot more broth than expected, but I am pretty sure it's because my pot let out a lot of steam so the broth evaporated. I added more broth, used 1/2 cup rice, and it still worked out great. If you don't want to use the suggested topping, I sprinkled Parmesan cheese on my rice and it was a nice addition.

good use for turkey, would have preferred a weight for meat amount as legs and thighs vary
