Simple and delicious! Plus, it's good for you too! I toasted my walnuts added some thin sliced red onion and Granny Smith apple slices. I subbed feta for the Romano and used "Easy Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing" from this site. Perfect for a light lunch!

I used almonds and crasins instead of walnuts and cranberries. I really enjoyed it. I did not feel like I was starving myself.

Thanks for a quick & easy winner! I used a 50/50 baby spinach/mixed greens salad blend and Paul Newman's Lite Rasp-Walnut Vinaigrette dressing. The colors were festive & the flavors were great. I always toast my nuts & would suggest doing so for improved flavor. This was big hit at Thanksgiving & a nice change from all the usual heavy hot veggies. I got a lot of compliments on it & will definately be making this again. Thanks for sharing it!

Easy, flavorful, and nutritious.  What more could you ask for?  I love adding nuts and dried fruit to spinach salads, it really perks them up.  I've also used sunflower seeds instead and it is also delicous.

Super awesome salad! My fiance and I were a little skeptical going into it, but after the first bite we were hooked and ended up finishing off the whole bowl of salad before starting on the rest of dinner. I was unable to find just dried cranberries so instead used a mix of dried cranberries, blueberries, and cherries, and this just added to the wonderful flavorful taste of the salad.

Great recipe.  Simple, yet flavorful.  I use a similar version where I add dates (pitted) and croutons.  It was a hit at Christmas!

What a great, simple recipe.  I was looking for a spinach recipe to use up the "pillow" of spinach I bought at Costco!  I already had the dried cranberries and raspberry walnut dressing on hand. I was hesitant to use the cheese; however, itwas very good with it  The only change I made was to sprinkle some additional strawberry balsamic vinegar over it.

GREAT salad!   Hubby says this is one of the best.  It is so basic and easy to change up.  I grated extra sharp white cheddar for the cheese.  Next time I plan on adding mandarin oranges, pineapple or another fruit.  It is so good!  Thank you Bethanie for sharing your recipe.

Used Ken's Low Fat Raspberry Pecan dressing, walnuts, dried cranberries and grated Romano/Parmesan. It was simple and delicious. Even my non-spinach eating son liked it!

Simple but superb.
Used the simple raspberry vinaigrette recipe on the site. 
Substituted feta chunks and instead of cranberries, I took the simple route and used craisins, which worked out great.

Perfect healthy salad. I added a little more of all the topping ingredients so every serving would have a lot of goodies on top!
