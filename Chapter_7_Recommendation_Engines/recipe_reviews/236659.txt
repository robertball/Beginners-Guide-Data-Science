This was awesome!  I left out the carrots and celery and did not top with cheese.  It was delicious.  The next day I smashed some into patties added some spices and fried them - and the day after that I just stir fried the leftovers with a little cumin and made meat free tacos. Thank you for this recipe!!

This was very good, but made so much I had to give it away.  I had to use a 3 qt dish since it would not fit in the 2 qt as stated.  If I make it again I will only use 1/4 of the recipe. Probably enough in this recipe to feed at least 12 people as a side dish.

This is a great basic recipe. It is very flexible. I used tomatoes with green chiles because I did not have green pepper on hand.  Then I decided to go with a southwestern flare and added 1 tsp cumin and omitted the mushrooms.

This sounded yummy with all the veggies, but be forewarned, lentils cooked the way recipe suggests, may lead  to an excessive amount of flatulence. Dried lentils should be soaked in water for 8 hours beforehand and then rinsed thoroughly before cooking to cut down on the human hydrogen bombs.

I did not expect to like this at all but wanted to make something with green lentils. So glad I tried it! As well as original ingredients, I tweaked recipe with 2 tsp each: cumin, turmeric, then a dash of salt and pepper. Included chopped zucchini. Used a medium roaster because I was worried it would spill over. About 2/3 way through the cooking time, I added some spicy Clamato juice because I felt it might be getting a bit dry (1 1/2 cups). This could be the missing ingredient for anyone who felt the recipe was lacking in taste. Anyway, a must try for anyone looking to add fiber into their diet!

My updates:          * I got my big Dutch oven pot out and stirred all the ingredients together in it. Then I dumped it all into a lasagna dish to cook.          * For the carrots I used 1 cup of shredded carrots (I was lazy)         * I used 4 cloves of garlic           * Added a bit extra water (1/2 c) to it after 1 hr (the lentils were still hard).  I cooked it for 1.5 hrs.   It's pretty tasty!  I would make it again.

This recipe was easy and tasty! As some people suggested I added turmeric and cumin, and I added some fresh coriander on the top which was great.

This recipe was awesome!  I used red lentils and added both fresh parsley and basil leaves.  The next morning my husband and I incorporated some of our leftovers in our scrambled eggs for a nice twist to breakfast. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Very good, especially for attempt #2, for which I filled in a layer of garlic mashed potatoes on top, more cheese, and baked another 30 minutes.

My wife scoffed, said I'd gone vegan. She loved it so today I made more. Added a little maple syrup and cinnamon and used a little jalape√±o as I was out of onions. A house fav!

I loves this recipe.  It was absolutely delicious and one of the healthiest things I could possibly make.  IT was kind of like lentil soup without the water and in a pan but it was so good!

This was an easy, quick and healthy dish that I will definitely make again! I used some of the suggestions made by others, adding cumin and turmeric. It definitely will not work in a  2 quart casserole dish; a 9x13 glass dish worked perfectly. I also added spicy V-8 juice after an hour and a half, and baked it 15 more minutes before adding the cheese. Salt and pepper are a must too. Very tasty after these revisions!

It was incredibly bland. It has good potential, though. I might try it again with more spices. I would also recommend using a bigger baking dish. It makes alot.  The recipe calls for 2 QT, but it was too small. I ended up using a 3 QT dish and it was perfect.

It was awful, their was no flavor and the lentils were not cooked. So I dumped it in a pot on the stove and added tomato sauce, water, salt and pepper, cumin, and hot sauce. I let it cook for another hour and they taste much better, but I probably will not be making this recipe again.

Thought it was excellent.  We did add some cumin to the mix.  And we thought the quantity was just right.  Since there are only two of us, we almost always make recipes like this as a two meal dish.  That way if we do like the dish, we have a second meal in the freezer.  If we don't, we think of ways to improve the dish when we use the frozen portion.  Next time we may add curry to the recipe and see how we like that.

It was marginal.  I made a nice soup with the leftovers and some veggies.  Next time?  Skip the casserole and make the soup.

Used 3 cups of veggie broth, 2 T. cumin, omitted the mushrooms, used 1 red pepper (not green), some red pepper flakes.  Also, mixed in some cheese with the veggies.  Topped with bread crumbs to give it more substance, and used quite a bit of cheese on top.  Pretty yummy.  Probably not too low calorie though, with the amount of cheese.  Didn't have a problem at all with pan - used a pyrex lasagna glass pan that's fairly big.  Will make this again.

My family loved this recipe.
I did sub out the water for veggie broth to add a bit more flavor. I also left off the cheese so my grandma who has a dairy allergy could eat it. I'm not a big lentils eater but I liked the flavor a lot.

It was delicious and very versatile; you can put any veggie you have on hand or like.  Just one thing: I would use less lentils in the future. 16 oz is way too much.

I made this recipe last night and it was a huge hit even with my husband. My daughter is vegan so we omitted the cheese and added Italian seasoning. We also put it over white rice. The recipe stated 1 1/2-2 hours cooking time but check close to the 1 1/2 as the liquid evaporates and the dish was almost burned. Will definitely make this again!!!

We made it without bell pepper,  used canned mushrooms,  added basil,  garlic salt and used feta cheese. Cooked at 400 to save some cooking time and that may have caused It to dry a bit so we added chicken broth for moisture.  It was pretty good with the changes,  but if you're not vegetarian,  we think I could use some ground Italian chicken sausage as well.

This was a good recipe, easy to follow and execute. It seemed to be missing some seasoning or salt. So next time I will try adding cumin, sea salt, and chili powder.

This is a great dish for a lazy weekend meal. Chop veggies and put everything else in a dish and leave to bake and dinner will be a success. I made a wild rice blend on the stove to go with the lentils. Very nice. Next time I will add a variety of frozen veggies and try different spices.

My daughter had lentils on hand.  Tried this recipe.  It was very good.My granddaughter is on her way to becoming a vegetarian, so she enjoyed this, too.  Needed to add more water after an hour, because the beans had soaked up the original chicken broth.

I found it a little bland. And I kept wishing it was half lentil and half ground turkey. I may try that in the future because it has some very good for you ingredients!

This recipe is really good but I recommend using broth instead of water and marinara sauce instead of crushed tomatoes. It needed more flavor for me. My 2 and 4 year old loved it!

I really liked this recipe! I baked the casserole for only 1.5 hours after reading some reviews that said it came out a little dry. I also added a few spices as suggested by others: Turmeric, cayenne pepper, salt, and white pepper. It came out great! Especially with the melted cheese on top. Yumm!

I made it as written, but added a teaspoon of cumin like others suggested.  It still tasted bland.  Although the taste is ok, there were just an abundance of lentils.  I think it would have been better with jus half the lentils, and something else to kick it up a bit.  I won't make this again, will just stick with lentil soup.

This was a hit!  Made it just like the recipe says.  We will make it again.  The lentils come out perfect and delicious.  Although it was great, this is a dish that you can endlessly experiment with.  I think it needs the cheese to be incorporated into the dish as well as on top, so next time I'll mix some cheese into the mixture.  It could use some more spices too, so I will try adding some as the other reviewers have.

This is a family favorite...... I sometimes use flavored tomatoes or spicy tomatoes depending what's in my cupboard.

I like it and will make it again! I didn't use the cheese since my husband and I are looking for tasty Vegan recipes. We didn't miss the cheese at all because of all the veggies.

Excellent! Quick and easy to make and this is a delicious and healthy meal. I omitted the cheese and added nutritional yeast to the top instead. I will definitely be making this again!

Great recipe! I made some changes because i really like spices, add cumin and turmeric. My daugther and husband  approved it. Also instead cheddar cheese I used Monterrey!

It was very yummy. Like chunky spaghetti with lintels instead of noodles.
