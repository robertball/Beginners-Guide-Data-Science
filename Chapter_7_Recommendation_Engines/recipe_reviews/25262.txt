I haven't actually made this recipe, but I love how the eggs turn out using the recipe's boiling method. I never knew how long to boil eggs before, and this method SAVES ENERGY too!!  Thanks

I'm amazed to see this recipe online!  My mother made this for family breakfasts my entire life....and I love it!  We serve the eggs over wheat toast and it's just delicious.  Also, you might want to try omitting the cheese and flavoring the sauce with onion powder.  It's killer!

Great for a light meal. I often buy several dozen eggs and hard boil one dozen while I put up groceries. I added garlic salt, pepper, dry mustard and parsley to the recipe. My husband said his mother made a similar dish when he was a child, but this was much superior and more flavorful. He suggests that I chop the eggs as she did to make it easier to eat over toast points.

I agree.....your method for boiling the eggs is wonderful. I always fuddled around looking for the best way to boil them but this definately works wonderfully!

With the exception of the Parmesan cheese, this is one of the early recipes we high school girls learned in our sophomore HomeEc class. First we learned to make bircuits, then we learned to hard-boil an egg, and then we learned to make the white sauce (that's what it used to be called). Finally, we learned to put it all together; and I don't know if it was because I'd made it myself, but I thought it was one of the bests meals I'd ever tasted. So much so, that I made it for Mom and Dad that night. I was so happy to see this recipe on 'allrecipes'. Thank you for bringing back a happy 57-year-old memory!

This recipe was amazing! I added a little more butter and parmesan cheese, then garlic and onion powder and parsley. Such good flavor! I will definitely put it on toast and make a sandwich next time. Much better than just hard-boiled eggs!

This was a recipe that my mother always served when the family was in for a Sunday breakfast or brunch.  I agree with adding some worchestershire sauce and cayenne pepper.  I cut the eggs into bite sized pieces. We also use chunks of ham.  We serve it over toast points or toasted english muffins.

What an evening meal and if you substitute bacon fat for the butter it adds a wonderful flavor.  Perfect meal when you are in a hurry and do not wish to heat up the kitchen.   Highly recommended

I made this one evening pretty late at night when I was super hungry and had really nothing in my fridge but some eggs. I cooked it up according to the recipe and IT WAS GREAT!!! It was super easy to make and tasted fabulous. I did make some back and crumbled it on top of the dish and it added a great flavor! Thanks for the awesome recipe...I know I'll use it again!

I wish I read the reviews before making this. Taking the advice and adding some onion would have made it fantastic. Otherwise, this was quick and easy to make. Great flavor!

This is a good recipe for a dish we make on special occasions. We usually serve it over split angel biscuits. I find that flavoring with white pepper and chicken base works well and if the yolks are a little soft they thicken the white sauce as they are folded in. An interesting addition is asparagus tips and a little curry powder.

This was delicious Jill! I've never had any luck with this type of egg cooking method. My eggs always come out under cooked, so I just did my usual fifteen minutes of boiling . I added garlic and onion powders to the sauce, along with dry mustard, black pepper and parsley flakes. Great Friday night meal and thanks!

We've been making this for quite a while, but I just realized I never wrote a review.  Oops!   After reading the comments, we add an extra 1/4 - 1/2 cup of milk and season with garlic salt, dry mustard, and/or onion powder.  Simple, but tasty, comfort food.

Made according to recipe.  Turned out as described, but my family did not like it at all - even my non-picky eaters didn't like it.  Must be an acquired taste or nostalgic thing.

This recipe turned out really nicely but just one tip - when you make the sauce, it does take awhile, and when it says stir constantly, stir CONSTANTLY! This was a great recipe though, and even though my mom really doesnt like eggs, she tried this and thought it was great! Great for brunch on Saturday mornings!

We ate this quite frequently while we were kids, but without the cheese. Sometimes my mother would add some peas and cocktail shrimp, but either way it was always served over buttered toast. So delicious.

This brings back memories and is great comfort food!  I thickly sliced an onion and sauteed until soft (not carmelized, added it to the sauce at the end.  Also added about 1/4 tsp of veggie bouillon powder to the melted butter when making the sauce.  Loved the end result!

Tastey!  Followed the advice of others and added spices (onion powder, white pepper, and salt).  Will most def make again! The boiling of the eggs didn't fully work out for me though.  Yolk needed more time I suppose.

I really like this recipe! I have made it twice. The first time I only cooked 3 eggs and tried to half the recipe and it was good, but didn't come out right. The second time I made the whole thing and it was great. I added garlic and onion powder and it was delicious.

This was really good.  I followed others advice and added onion and garlic powder, but next time I'll try some additional seasonings.  I made this for 1 serving and it was done in minutes, so simple.  I didn't find it too rich either and next time I'll probably crumble bacon over the top.  I mixed the chopped eggs into the sauce and served over toast.  Delicious and easy!  Nice change.

We ran out of a lot of food supplies and I'm on a low-carb diet, so I was delighted to see this low-carb, yet very simple recipe! This is very easy to make. The sauce is delicious, and I think can even be used to dip biscuits or toast in. But I made some slight adjustments. I used margarine instead of normal butter, put 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in a bowl before adding to the sauce, added garlic, onion powder and other seasonings to it. Then I put it in the sauce and it was great. thanks for the recipe!

I added a little to this recipe...added fresh thyme to infuse flavor into the cream sauce and sprinkled paprika on top.  My mother taught me to hard boil eggs by continuously boiling for 15 minutes and then plunging into an ice bath to cool.  Perfect every time - no dark rings around the yolk!

I really liked this recipe. Very versitile. And handy when you have about 18 eggs ready expire! :-D
I like adding various spices to this. It's a nice recipe to experiment with.

I like this method of boiling eggs -- it came out perfect. The sauce was excellent; although for my personal taste, i'll probably lessen the cheese. :)

This dish is FANTASTIC!  I used Danish Cream Havarti cheese in place of the parm and it turned out perfect.  This is going to become a family recipe.  Thanks

This recipe was really good, but a added cayenne pepper to give it more of a kick. I also added some more milk at the end to make it more creamy.

My mom used to prepare a very similar egg dish.  I thought the parmesan cheese added a nice flavor.  What a great way to cook the eggs!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Quick and easy. Without cheese it's a nice foundation to add whatever you want to flavor it up. I just went with the cheese and it was very good.

We called this our "country meal", it had that flavor.  I added minced onion, cooked crumbled bacon, and peas.  We also subbed yogurt cheese for the parm. It was pretty good, but I probably won't make it again.

Husband didn't care for this at all, and I liked only a little but more. I made it as stated, and thought it was WAY too rich - we had it on buttered toast, and had enough after a couple of bites. Thanks anyway.

Good recipe but the eggies were soft in the middle.  Even left them in hot water for 12 min.  I'll boil them for 5 comlete minutes next time then let them sit for twelve.

An OK dish, but could use more butter for the sauce and perhaps some seasonings to add some interest.
