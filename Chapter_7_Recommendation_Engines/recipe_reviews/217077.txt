Love this salad! It has great Greek flavors that my whole family loves. The few changes I made was to add some sliced cucumbers and halved grape tomatoes. It gave it the crunch and the freshness that I associate with salads. The feta and olives are perfect.  Unlike a lot of salads, this one actually got better after sitting for a day or two. If your pasta absorbs too much of the dressing, which really is a very minimal, add more. I also did give it a good shake of red wine vinegar to wake up the flavors. As written, it's a 3. With my tweaks it's a 5. Therefore, I'm settling on an overall rating of 4.

This was really easy and delicious.  I added more red pepper because we love to eat fire.  I served this cold.  My husband loved it.  I will make this for company.

Delicious!  I added green onions, feta, tomatoes, and calamata olives.  Was divine.
