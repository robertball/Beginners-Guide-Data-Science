This is soooo easy and so incredible. I have made pudding before and it's been good, but this was great! People look at vegan and get turned off, but I have found especially w/ deserts that vegan usually tasts the same as w/ dairy. The only difference between this recipe and a standard good chocolate pudding recipe is the soy creamer. Good dark chocolate does not have dairy as a rule. I used Wholefoood's dark chocolate chips in their bulk section because they are sooo good. One more thing, don't put the cornstarch in the pot of boiling liquid, but rather put it in before boiling and stir till dissolved. This will prevent it from clumping from the heat.

Egg replacer is just another starch-usually potato. You could just use 5 T. cornstarch total, instead. You wouldn't put a starch in hot liquid, thats why it's coming out lumpy-wisk the starch in cold milk or creamer. I used chocolate soy milk, and 3 T. cocoa, and agave syrup instead of sugar.

I used silken tofu instead of the soy creamer in a panic when I could not find it a day I had promised to bring in a vegan dessert to a party! It worked just as well and had a lot less fat content than the soy creamer.  My only advice would be to put the tofu in a blender or food processor to grind up any remaining chunks.  Excellent recipe!!

I to try to consume as little dairy as possible  not because I'm lactose intollerant, but because dairy is not healthy for human consumption so this reciepe is perfect and one would never know that it's non-dairy! It's great and soooo chocolatly and rich. It's more chocolatey than pudding packed w/ dairy. I have made it a few times now and usually make a large bowl that lasts two days or so. My husband & friends have tried it more than once and they all agree, it's fantastic!!!!

I had to make this recipe twice before I got it right, like other reviewers I ended up with rice size lumps in the finished product the first time. The problem came with mixing the egg powder too quickly with the hot mixture, basically causing scrambled eggs. They were impossible to get rid of, but the second time I was more carefull, and the finished product was chocolatey and smooth.  Easy, tasty and dairy free..........give it a try

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but my pudding came out with lumps about the size of rice grains. I thought the flavor was okay, but after serving it to a picnic full of friends, my boyfriend tried it and reviewed it as "awful." Perhaps more a testament to my lack of culinary skill or his poor taste than to the quality of the recipe...?

I have made this twice with soy milk instead of the creamer, and it turned out just fine.  I also slightly reduced the cornstarch and egg substitute for a slightly more liquidy pudding.

If you'd like to try a butterscotch pudding, replace the chocolate with about one or two teaspoons of butterscotch extract.  This turned out very nice when I tried it, just check the extract before you buy it because many times butterscotch is not vegan.

I totally agree with the last reviewer. This is great, i'm eating it right now. It's sooo chocolatey and rich, yet not overwhelmingly. It's perfect chocolate pudding. Dairy is so bad for people contrary to popular belief, so this is perfect, a dairyless pudding and one would never know if they weren't told.

This is the best cornstarch, vegan pudding recipe I have ever tried - and it is so easy and nearly foolproof.

I must be doing something wrong.  I followed the directions but the pudding has the consistency of rubber or "flubber" more accurately.  I think it would have been a better texture without the egg replacer.  Next time I will leave it out.
