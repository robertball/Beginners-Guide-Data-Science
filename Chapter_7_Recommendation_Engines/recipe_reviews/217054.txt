Sinfully rich, over the top delicious, oh so chocolately, delightfully peanut buttery and absolutely fabulous! I mean to try to describe this using just one word may be virtually impossible, just as impossible as it is to eat just one slice- yes, it's that good. If you're a self proclaimed chocoholic, have ever been accused of being one or if you're addicted to peanut butter like me then this is the dessert for you! What an awesome combination of flavors and textures! And, what's great about this is for as gorgeous as this turns out it's surprisingly easy to make! I used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer which really helped. I followed the recipe exactly and kept thinking, "No way can something this easy to make be this good?". It's really hard not to "sample" at each step from the crust to the filling to the toppings. I did try to lighten it up a bit by using reduced fat Oreos, reduced fat cream cheese, reduced fat peanut butter, and light Cool Whip so I didn't feel too "guilty" about enjoying this dessert. I highly recommend rinsing/wiping down your knife between each slice when cutting into this pie. I think you could even make this into some really awesome parfaits and refrigerate instead of freezing. This most certainly is one heck of a "Sweet Creation" and makes you look like a hero in front of friends and family! Thanks MySweetCreations for a great recipe - one I'll be making often!

This recipe is often requested and always a favorite! People will ask you for this recipe, so be prepared. Keep this in the freezer until you are ready to serve. I top mine with whipped cream, caramel and chocolate sauce and Reese's Cups. Sometimes I add an extra sprinkle of cinnamon on top of mine. I sometimes like to serve with an extra dollop of whipped cream on the side. You can add the toppings before freezing. This recipe is easily adjustable, you can use low-fat cream cheese or even make homemade whipped cream to sub for store bought which is something I often do myself. Be sure to check out my "What's Cooking?" episode on AllRecipes as I make this recipe in the episode. You can find it by clicking on the "Video" tab towards the top of this page and searching for MySweetCreations" San Diego in under the "What's Cooking?" episodes. I hope that helps!

Fantastic! This is amazingly delicious. I have been craving peanut butter and chocolate lately and nothing was doing it for me. This fixed my craving :) I followed the recipe exactly. Its perfect as is. Very easy to put together, and it looks beautiful. I'll be making this often in the summer time. Thanks for the recipe.

As soon as I saw this recipe I knew I HAD to make it, and did NOT disappoint~FANTASTIC! I LOVE the combination of chocolate and peanut butter and this was just perfect in every way. Super simple to put together, yet so professional looking. I took this to my sister's house for dessert tonight and everyone raved over it! I made this exactly as written and would not change a thing. Thanks, Kelly, for a new dessert favorite that will be made VERY often! :)

I found this recipe just in time to make it for my daughter's birthday.  She and the rest of my kids are Reese's Peanut Butter Cup fanatics.  OMG!!!  This was very rich and delicious!  All of my children absolutely loved it.  The oldest said it beats anything he has ever tasted before hands down!  The cheesecake part of the dessert was very smooth, creamy and tasty.  The two sauces add a nice touch, but next time for our preference a little more chocolate and less caramel!  I chose to freeze the cheescake first then decorated the cheesecake by drizzling some of the sauces on top and then arranging the the chopped peanut butter cups over that.  Served the whipping cream on the side in case some did not want whipping cream.  Very pretty presentation and is definitely a new favorite dessert for this family.  Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe!!!

This was delicious! My daughter tried to hide a peice in the fridge but I found it and promptly ate it.  When she realized what happened - she refused to speak to me for two days!

This was my first time to eat a "Peanut Butter Pie" so I have nothing to compare it with! I loved the cookie base. I used fresh whipped cream instead of frozen whipped topping (due to the fact that I can not get frozen whipped topping here) The texture of the filling was a little dense for my taste  but still tasted yummy, the next time I make this I will add a little more whipped cream.

Sensational! I made this for a dinner party and the comments I got from around the table were, "mmmmmm" and "ohhhhhhh." I was a little worried the mixture wasn't going to smooth out after adding the cool whip, but I just kept stirring and it eventually turned silky smooth. I made half a batch of my grandma's hot fudge sauce (you can find the recipe in my box), let it cool slightly and spread it in the center of the frozen pie. I then piped the cool whip on, sprinkled the PB cups on the fudge and then sprinkled cinnamon on the cool whip. I bought the 16 oz. container of cool whip, and I'm glad I did, because I used up almost the whole thing. Another tip is that you will have to let the pie thaw a little before removing the spring-form pan. I really think it's the cinnamon that makes this recipe stand out from other peanut butter pies. Well done Kelly!  :)

I could not WAIT to make this for Father's Day! Neither could the kids!!! It is pretty quick and easy and presents with a professional bakery look. I followed the recipe exactly but made subtle adaptations due to DH having a lactose issue. I used a store brand "Oreo" cookie I know has no dairy as well as soy cream cheese and a store brand non dairy whipped "cream" topping. As for the Reese's cups well - there were plenty of volunteers to gobble up DH's portion! Even with these adaptations the cake was fantastic and I was already asked to make it again. No photo to share as my camera was left behind at a graduation party earlier today :( Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummy says it all!  The only change I had to make was to use peanut butter sandwich cookies for the crust because that's what I had (hence the 4 stars).  Can't wait to try it with Oreo's!

This is another recipe that the husband and father-in-law absolutely loved, but I thought it was just okay. Made exactly according to recipe. Here are my thoughts:
1. The little bit of cinnamon in the crust was delicious, but a bit strong maybe for some tastes, and I actually didn't think it was a good flavor combination with PB. Next time I would omit the cinnamon.
2. The crust was delicious, but should have been thicker. Next time I will increase by 1.5-2x.
3. It is definitely best served DIRECTLY FROM THE FREEZER. Even sitting in the fridge it softened a bit too much and the texture was too loose. In the freezer it becomes more firm, but not hard.
4. Because it should be served right out of the freezer, it's probably not good for potlucks or buffet style meals.

What an amazing dessert!  I followed the recipe exactly and there is not a thing to change about it that could make it better, because it is perfect.  Chocolate and peanut butter is my favorite combination and now I think I may have found my new favorite dessert.  I made it for our picnic and one of the girls is famous for her peanut butter pie, BUT she even said this was better than hers (and I do have to agree).  Thanks Kelly for sharing this delicious treat!

I worked in a restaurant during my college years ( 30 plus years ago) that served this...except they used 8 oz heavy cream, whipped, instead of the cool whip. This is the the bomb and everyone has always loved it. Try it.....you will dazzle your guests! Thanks for sharing!

DELICIOUS. I made this as my birthday "cake" and I'm very glad that I did!!
The filling tastes a lot like a creamy version of Reese's peanut butter to me. And that bit of cinnamon in the crust (I upped mine to 1 tsp., BTW) hits you at the end of your bite.
Definitely going to make this again. Wouldn't change a thing.

This pie is soooo easy to make :) & I am giving it 5 stars for taste and how easy it was to make !! You might want to add a bit more butter into the crust, as other reviewers suggested. Be CAREFUL uuu will definitely keep going back for more! This creation is addicting :D

YUM. This was sooo good! I made this for Father's Day, but forgot to review, so here it is! I followed the recipe exactly, using homemade whipped cream, except that I didn't end up putting chocolate and caramel sauce on top, because it already had so many peanut butter cups (and crushed oreos!) on top. I also used a store bought box of oreo pie crust, which worked fine. Everyone loved this, even me, and I don't even like peanut butter (I know, kill me..) I will make this again! Thanks!

The only change I made was using 2 cups whipping cream and 2 packets of Whipit stabilizer for the Cool Whip.
My husband's uncle said it was the best pie he had every had.
My husband would like it "peanuttier" next time I would try chunky peanut butter and omit the cinnamon from the crust.

I should not have used double stuff Oreos. The crust cooked to the bottom of the springform pan. Might try normal pie pan and scrape the icing off the Oreos first. My 3. Yr old only eats that part of the Oreo anyway. The filling is wonderful. One of the best pnut butter pies I've tasted. I topped with crumbled mini Reese's cups for more SWEEEEET making it even richer. Great with some strong dark coffee.

This was delicious and went SUPER fast at our holiday party. I used low fat cream cheese and cool whip with no problems setting. Next time I am going to make a 9x13 pan of it instead of a pie!!

This pie has a VERY dominant peanut butter taste.  So if you are looking for something subtle, either scale it down or keep looking.  I like how creamy it is.  Everything goes together well.  Unfortunately, as I suspected, there isn't enough butter used to hold the crust together.  I would say to use 1/2 a stick of butter instead.  Other than that, I think its a keeper.

Really great recipe.  I've made this twice, and both times it turned out excellent.  The first time I made it with the oreo crust.  The recipe doesn't call for quite enough butter, so my pie turned out as a bit of a cobbler, but no complaints!  The second time I used a store bought flour crust, which worked out well.  I added an additional thin layer of chocolate and caramel on top of the baked crust before adding the filling, which turned out fantastic.  Yum!

followed exactly. Freezes perfectly. The ideal mix between cheesecake, ice cream cake, and a peanut butter pie. 10 stars.

A very rich cake that looks and tastes like decadent junk food. I only used 2 cups of cool-whip in the filling so as not to dilute the peanut butter flavor. I stuck the finished cake in the freezer for about 3 hours before serving. The crust came apart a bit when cut, but it was tasty never the less. Husband loved it, rating it at five stars. I liked it a lot, but find that it's not my favorite, meriting around for stars. Overall, something I would do again.

I (and my family) never eat sugar, so I had to change this slightly. First- I used a healthy oreo- sweetened with evaporated cane juice (New-Mans-Own) for the crust. Then I powdered evaporated cane juice with some cornstarch in my blender and that worked fine- to substitute for the confectionery sugar. I made my own whipped cream out of heavy whipping cream, honey and vanilla. I made my own chocolate sauce- easy easy! And my own caramel sauce from honey, butter and milk. For the peanut butter cups I purchased some healthy ones, (also New-Mans-Own) And also made some chocolate covered peanuts to go on top. It tasted soooooo good! Thanks a million! (I forgot one more thing) I don't have a spring form pan. So, I took my pan and cut a piece parchment paper the same size, and placed it in the bottom. Then I baked it and froze it. Then I put parchment paper around the edges of the pan and did the filling and froze it. Carefully i mean CAREFULLY did i then removed the crust and filling by tipping it onto my hand. then I removed the parchment paper and placed it on a plate. Then I did the topping part. I was a little more tricky than a spring-form pan- but I am amazed at how well it worked!! Must try- EVERYONE MAKE THIS PIE!!

Very good!  I cut the powdered sugar to 1/2 cup because my husband doesn't like real sweet desserts.  I cheated a little bit on the topping- instead of piping the whipped cream on top I used a can of extra creamy reddi-whip to do my piping.  Worked beautifully!  I also didn't add the sauces- just whipped cream and crumbled Reese's.

I took this to a party and received many compliments, everyone thought it tasted great.  I didn't have caramel or chocolate syrup so I melted some chocolate chips and drizzled that over the top.

Exceptional and easy to make. Made it for a birthday dinner and everyone went nuts. Not overly sweet like some chocolate peanut butter recipes. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I found this recipe a few weeks ago and watched the video and decided it looked so great, I would enter our Church picnic pie contest.  I printed out the recipe and made the pie only last night and froze it overnight.  I presented the pie this morning at 10:30 for a pie contest at our Church picnic.  And I won 1st Prize!!! I was so shocked when they called my name for 1st Place because I didn't even taste the pie beforehand and didn't know how good it was LOL! I was a little worried about the appearance because I knew it would be hot at the picnic and I was afraid the whipped cream decorations would melt before the judges could judge the appearance.  I brought a cooler and placed the springform pan in it and iced it down until they asked me to place it on the table with the other pies.  They judged it just in time, because it did slightly melt.  I read most of the reviews for this pie and took some of the advice.  Some reviews said to serve immediately from the freezer and they were correct. After the contest was over, I was able to sample the pie and it was indeed EXCELLENT!  The pie shell was perfect, the texture of the filling - perfect. I didn't really change anything except I didn't put the whipped cream in a piping bag. I used canned whipped cream which already has the right fitting on it. This pie is very rich.  I only had one bite and it was enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.  THANK YOU, KELLY FOR AN AWARD WINNING PIE!

This recipe was a huge hit for Bosses Day. Maybe I'll get a raise??? ?? I cheated and used a food processor to crush the cookies and then added butter.  This one is definitely a keeper!!! Can't wait to make it again for the holidays! Thanks for sharing!!

Soooo good! I didn’t use any caramel sauce because I didn’t have any but I don’t think it was necessary for a delicious dessert. I’m making it again tonight for a New Years Party.

I loved making this! I just made it and it's setting in the freezer as some prior comments suggested, but i'll admit I nibbled as I made it and it's great! It was VERY peanut-buttery but tastes great! 5 stars for sure :) I found 9 oreos in my pantry instead of 18, and they were chocolate stuffed, but I mashed an organic valley peanut-butter crunchy bar and had enough stuff, barely.I also had 2 tb of butter instead of 1 1/2 and didn't add any cinnamon, as older comments suggested ;) anyway, I LOVED IT!

Did exactly as written. It was very easy to make and looked gorgeous! The flavor was great too. I had to wait 15-20 minutes after I removed it from the freezer to be able to cut it. A crowd pleaser for sure!
