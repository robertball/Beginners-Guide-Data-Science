**Please note my review is based on changes made, not as the recipe is written** Usually, Chef John's recipes are perfect, but I have to agree that in this recipe there was too much tomato sauce and spices for the amount of Farro. It's an easy fix, though, just double the amount of Farro and broth, and leave everything else the same. It's delicious once the ratio is corrected.

FYI, Farro is always chewy no matter how much you cook it. I didn't like the chewiness. If I make this again, it'll be with rice instead of Farro.

I would double the recipe and tone down the spices, which without the Ancho chili were already potent.

it was delicious on it's own but I did take liberties and used items I had to make a salad using this as a base. I added 1/2 cup red onion ,1/2 cup red bell pepper and 4 ears of "corn on the grill" recipe on site. (Amazing)

I did not care for this recipe. The spices overwhelmed all else so that all I could taste was the various chili powders.  It's not that it was too spicy - it wasn't - but that the amount of spices called for and the amount of tomato paste was way too much for the amount of farro.  I would not make this again.

Used a can of Rotel instead of tomatoes paste, and green chili powder instead of ancho. (Out of those 2 for some reason).
Turned out great!  Loved the texture and taste of the farro. Ready too make it again

I cut the heat in half as I found things just a bit too spicy but otherwise love this recipe, the farro's texture is wonderful and I love the flavors
