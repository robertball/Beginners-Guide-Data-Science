I made a version of this recipe for New Year's morning and it was such a hit. Instead of orange brandy and orange zest, I used Grand Marnier and clementines with day-old challah bread.  In addition, I created a sauce using freshly squeezed juice from the clementines, Grand Marnier, powdered sugar, and maple syrup.  This was an extrememly rich, complex-tasting french toast with minimal preparation involved.  This paired perfectly with mimosas!

I thought this recipe was great. I didn't have any oranges on hand for the orange zest, but used a little orange extract instead and that worked just fine. Only the next time I make this I will probably decrease the amount of sugar to 1/4c. I like my french toast with syrup & it made it just a little to sweet with the 1/2c sugar as indicated in the recipe. I made an orange flavored syrup to serve on top of the toast. It was YUMMY!!!

This was a very flavorful alternative to regular french toast.  I only used 6 pieces of white bread so I halved the other ingredients as well, but found that the bread was really dry.  I ended up mixing up the remaining amounts and adding them to the shallow pan.  After about 5 minutes I flipped the bread pieces and let them sit for another 5 minutes before putting them on the grill.  Just awesome!  I also did not have any oranges to make the zest, but the flavor was still exceptional!

I made this the other night when I was inebriated. Instead of 12 slices of white bread, I instead used 4 ribeye steaks. In place of all that sugar, I used salt and pepper. Then, I deep-sixed the orange liqueur and orange zest and put some iced cold tequila in a glass whose rim had been generously salted. I knocked that back and shot gunned a couple of Michelobs. Then, I threw the French steaks on a skillet, turned up the heat, fell asleep and burned down my kitchen.

So remember, donâ€™t change the recipe.

Try using vanilla, cinnamon, and sugar in the egg/milk mixture. To die for!

Wow!  I can't imagine eating french toast any other way now.  So tasty even though I used triple sec for the orange liquer (not very authentic) I will try Grand Marnier next time like someone else suggested.

I made this & it was a hit! I followed the recipe and it was wonderful.  I'm not sure why people bother rating a recipe when they've change almost everything in it! A few things I can see..but omitting the orange & using cinnamon and vanilla? That's just an entirely different recipe.

This was fantastic, I'm making for dinner tonight!  When I first made it, my family requested it 3 days in a row!  I ran out of orange liquor so once used orange extract (fantastic) instead.  Once used 1/2 orange and 1/2 almond extracts.  I like to serve it w/fresh blueberries and powdered sugar sprinkled on top.  So good!

I didn't have orange liqueur, so we used orange juice and I added a bit more orange peel (I used the dried kind). It was very tasty, good flavor, but makes more egg mixture than I needed personally. But then again, we don't let our bread sit in the mix, just dunk it and then put it directly in the pan. Next time I may try it as someone else suggested--with vanilla & cinnamon added, as I think we missed those flavors (but did like the contribution of orange flavor!). Thanks for the recipe! Oops, sorry, we ate it up before we thought about taking a picture :(

Tasty french toast, but next time I think I'll add half the liquor.  The liquor taste was too strong for me, especially for breakfast!

Made this pretty much as directed except only used 1/4 cup sugar and used Trader Joe's Challah bread. There was enough liquid for 4 big diagonal bread slices.  It was custard-y deliciousness! Will consider this my new go to version of French Toast.

Loved it!!  Will most definitely cook this recipe again.  The orange liquer was the perfect extra ingredient.

This was so incredibly delicious! We used the Artesano white bread and Grand Marnier. Only soaked for about 10 seconds each side or it came out too soggy. Amazing flavor. Weâ€™ll definitely make this again! Preferably on a day when we have nowhere to be so we can enjoy it with some mimosas!

Made the recipe as written using french bread and it was excellent.  TIP:  cut thin slices of the french bread because it will bulk as it soaks in the egg mixture.  I cut thick slices and my first batch did not have the egg mixture soaked through the entire piece of bread.  I had to soak each thick slice for longer than 5 minutes to ensure that the egg mixture fully penetrated the bread.

This was delicious. I took Cinnamon Crunch Cereal and put it in my food processor. I then dredged the French toast in it before placing on griddle. Wowsa!!
