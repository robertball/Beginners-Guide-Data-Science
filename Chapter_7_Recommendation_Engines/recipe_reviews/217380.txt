Finally the spaghetti recipe I've been looking for! I've been searching for a simple recipe that tastes great and isn't from a jar. My family loved it! This will be a regular dish at my house!

Way too much meat, this recipe equals 1/2 lb of meat per person! I cooked as instructed but added 8oz tomato sauce. One box of noodles wasn't enough for the sauce so I saved half of the sauce for later, and it was still too much meat. Next time I'd use 1/2 lb meat. Actually, I don't plan on making this again.

This was so fast and easy. I also enjoyed the flavor. 2 cups of water evaporates quickly so I had to add more water (1/2 cup at a time) twice. Maybe I should have kept a lid on it, but it didn't say to do that. I will try that next time. My advise is to watch it closly, and make sure it's on a low simmer or you'll be using a brillo pad on the bottom of your pot. I really liked this dish, thanks

I've never had Bolognese before, so I'm not sure how the flavor of this compares to other recipes; however, we really enjoyed it.  The carrots add a nice touch of sweetness while not being over powering.  The only problem I had with this was the dryness.  I ended up adding approximately 2 cups more water by the time the sauce was done (I simmered it in my slow cooker for approximately 4 hours on low).  I think this would benefit from a can of diced tomatoes with their juices, so next time I'll try that addition.
