The crust topping is delicious, but the fresh blackberries from the store were incredibly tart.  Is there any way to sweeten them by adjusting the recipe?  This recipe is quick and easy, but not delicious like the cobbler I grew up eating.

There is far too much liquid for the amount of dry ingredients and should be halved. Also, if you don't add some sugar to the berries, the result will be very tart unless you have some extremely sweet berries. I suggest adding at least a couple tablespoons of sugar to the berries. I could only give this one 3 stars taking these things into consideration.

Thought it was a particularly good recipe. The batter /crust excellent HOWEVER rare is the recipe that does not need a tweak or two...1) the fruit needed more sugar. Used blackberries and blueberries combined. Recommend sugaring any fruit to taste 2)Added a bit of balsamic to taste to fruit instead of lemon to "brighten" flavor. I do this for blackberries, blueberries(depending)and strawberries. Learned trick from chef 3)Recipe halves nicely 4)Added a 1/8 -1/4 cup additional sugar to batter 5) Looking forward to making with fresh rhubarb, strawberries, cherries, peaches from yard

This was great! I did adjust the recipe to include topping the fruit with 1/2 cup of sugar and fresh squeezed orange juice (1 orange) before putting the batter on. I will definitely make this again!

I heated the 6 cups of blackberries with 1/2 c of half and half. I also used evaporated milk instead of regular whole milk. I used a full pint of heavy cream and the flour was almond flour.

To sweeten the berries better I added agave. Just drizzled it over the berries before putting batter on berries wonderful

I tried this last night with fresh Himalaya berries. Our berries were tart so I added some sugar. The crust was good, but the berries juice absorbed I to it which made me wonder if I cooked it too long. I split the recipe Into two smaller cobblers and gave one away.  I will try this one again, but with small adjustments.

It was very good, it does need about 1/4 cup of sugar over the berries. I also added a little bit of extra sugar to the batter.
