The filling is good but this recipe made me realize that I do not care for the floppy noodle consistency of the boiled method. I much prefer a crispier wonton. No fault of the recipe just personal preference is all. I would definitely make these again but would either pan or deep fry.

No complaints about this recipe. The flavours we great and other than I didn t have any cornstarch I did the ingredients as is and wouldn t change it. I too am not fond of the rubbery texture unless in soup (these seemed too big for soup) so I pan fried them in coconut oil and they were crispy and delicious. I serve with a rice vinegar chili dipping sauce and those who didn t dip added salt. I will make this recipe often. Oh prep took longer than suggested; maybe just me. Thanks hrosdail!
