This recipe has potential, but also has some problems. First, the 10 cups of liquid for 1 lb of rice turned my rice into gelatinous sludge, and way too much of it. Next time I would use a 1/2 lb of rice and cook it to package directions, with the addition of toasting the grains first for about 2 minutes in a Tbsp of oil on med high heat. This will reduce the starchiness. Be sure to use a combination of light and dark meat chicken (or all dark meat) for the best flavor. I added in some whole cardamom pods, whole black peppercorns, 1 Tbsp ground cumin, and an extra tsp of ground coriander to the chicken while it cooked, giving the sauce a more complex flavor. I would also recommend tripling the amount of fresh herbs. Also, I sprung for some saffron which imparts a great flavor. But for those of you for whom saffron is unavailable or cost prohibitive, you can steep a few whole cardamom pods and a pinch of paprika in the butter/milk mixture for a few minutes to get a similar effect.

This recipe calls for far too much rice. 2 cups is called for in other recipes for chicken biryani online, which was still a bit too much. Typo?

I added coriander, cinnamon and cloves, improving it greatly.
