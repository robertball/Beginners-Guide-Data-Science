End result was really good, but I did have to make a few changes because it was messy otherwise. I used a 12 oz bag of semisweet mini chocolate chips. After melting, I mixed the full amount of Crispix into the mix and added one cup of powdered sugar while it was still in the pot, before putting it in a ziploc bag.I tried putting the straight chocolate covered cereal into the bag, and it got super messy, so I had to pour it back out, add the powdered sugar, and then put it in a new bag. It was a hit at the party I brought it to, but so messy to make!

As written, this recipe doesn't make sense. I put the Chex in a large mixing bowl, nuked the chocolate and the Nutella, then mixed it all together. I shook it in two zippies with powdered sugar as suggested, and then poured it out onto some wax paper. Worked great this way!

Delish with a few tweaksâ€” added 1/4 cup peanut butter and 2 TBLS butter melted with Nutella.  Less messy than original plus PB was a subtle but tasty addition.
