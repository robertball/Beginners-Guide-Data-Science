You cannot beat this peanut butter fudge recipe. It is smooth, creamy, and melts in your mouth. I substituted creamy peanut butter for the chunky and it turned out perfectly. I've received so many compliments and my picky family loves it! Ignore the other reviews that it is too soft. It sets up perfectly if you bring the milk and sugar to a soft ball stage (slighly golden in color) before adding the remaining ingredients.

This was very good peanut butter fudge. The fudge was soooo smooth.  The only issue I had is that it didn't set up as firm as I would have liked. It tasted delicious but was to soft and sticky.

THe taste was good, but it never set up.  I made this one night and 24 hours later it was just as soft and runny as when I poured it in the bowl the set. I think it would be good if there was more peanutbutter or something.

Make sure there is little oil in the pb, also make sure to fully boil the milk and sugar 230 degrees. I added 1/2 cup of melted choc chips after I added fudge to pan and swirlled it for chocolate peanut butter fudge. I also used a long pan with sides lined with parchment and used small cookie cutters to make fall shapes. Enjoy.

I've tried many, many fudge recipes and this is by far the best peanut butter fudge recipe so far.  I'm not sure what the reviewer meant when they said this did not "set up".  I have the same problem if it is humid in my house OR if I don't cook it long enough.  I cook my mixture in a thick walled, heavy saucepan and once it comes to a boil, I boil it exactly 5 minutes.  No more, no less.  It turns out perfectly every time. I made about 10 batches of this for Christmas gifts so far and everyone who has tried it so far at my work love this fudge.    I'll be making it for my son and his family when I visit them this month.

I thought this would be an easy and delicious recipe, but it wasn't. I followed the directions but the fudge tasted horrible and it never set up. I even tried putting it in the fridge for about an hour. Not a good recipe.

This came out perfect and was so easy!  (You really do need a candy thermometer, though).  My kids went crazy for it - I'll be making it again at Christmas. A keeper!

It was so good but it was so creamy that i couldn't cut it  without it sticking to everything that touched it. so i rolled it up into little balls it was still to creamy. Just freeze it thats my opinion
