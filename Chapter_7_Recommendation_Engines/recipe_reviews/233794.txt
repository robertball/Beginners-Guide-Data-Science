This was the BEST green bean recipe I have ever tried!  Have to admit I was somewhat skeptical of cooking time also. Not anymore!  I made it for a B-B-Que we attended yesterday( doubled recipe) and used fresh green beans , tomatoes, and onions from my garden. People raved about this dish.  Even people who normally don't like green beans went back for seconds!! I was asked several times for recipe . This is such a keeper!! Would give it more stars if I could! By the way, chef John is probably my favorite contributor!  I love all his recipes, always right on for amount, taste, and quality.

Just like my Nana used to make! I made it exactly as written except for one thing: right at the end, I added a splash of red wine vinegar to brighten it up (I do this with my slow-cooked greens as well). You can't taste the vinegar, but it makes all of the rest of the flavors pop!

I think there is a step left out in the printed recipe, as compared to the video.  Video shows everything done in the saucepan, whereas the printed recipe starts and cooks the beans separately, in a skillet.  I followed the video, did everything in the pan, and it worked out fine.  Very tasty and good.
As per another suggestion, I quartered a few small red potatoes and added them.  (Would need to wait until the last 30 or 40 minutes to do this.)

I'm not from the South, but my late husband was, and this is THE BEST recipe I have found so far for green beans.  Add potatoes half way through and fry some chicken in an iron skillet and there's your meal!!  My 9 year old son and I thought they were AWESOME!!  (And I'm from Chicago by the way!)

This was yummy! When hubby saw it cooking he said "That looks like the beans my mom used to make"
The only thing I did different was I used fresh tomatoes peeled and seeded and run through the immersion blender.  If I can use fresh I do.

These beans were wonderful!  I made them for my family for Christmas.  They were good the day I made them, but the day after they were truly amazing.  I recommend making them the day before and heating them up to serve the day of.  Sooooo good! Also, the calories are off on this. Only 71 per serving ;-)

Ahhhh maz ZING!  I've been in search of a green bean recipe a next door neighbor used to always make and this is oh so close.   I needed about 5 cups of chicken stock to cover my beans but other than that, made it exactly as directed and they turned out fantastic.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was absolutely incredible. We followed the directions to the T. I will make this at least once a week moving forward. I have never had better green beans. Don't be hesitant about using tomato ... the taste is excellent.

To heck with the green beans. The sauce is excellent!!  I used my home canned V6 juice instead of tomato juice  and, instead of cayenne, used smoked paprika.

This recipe made the most amazing green beans!!!  Do not hesitate to make this recipe.  I made this for my holiday party and I had people coming back for seconds and thirds.  It was the hit of the party and had guests begging me for the recipe for their parties or dinners.  I was cooking for 30 so I made the bacon mixture seperately than the green beans as the written receipe didnt state when to add them together.  I did see later that he mentioned in the video.  I cooked the green beans over two burners in a roasting pan and the chicken broth.  After 1.5 hours I mixed them both together in the pan and let simmer for another 1/2 hour.  These beans overshadowed the perfectly made prime rib and I was upset I didnt keep more of the left overs for myself the next day.

Wanted to make green beans as I remember my Greek granny did; after watching Chef John's entertaining and educational video, and taking this wonderful chef's suggestion to use fresh tomatoes, I wasn't afraid to prepare this slow-cooked green bean recipe for the full two hours, but tried tasting beans at half hour intervals because I was skeptical. Granny didn't use bacon so I left that out this time. My family loves what jalapeño peppers do for flavor so I did slice a fresh one up and added it with the broth. I love Cremini mushrooms so I added 1/2 cup of fresh sliced, too. When two hours was up and there was the perfect amount of flavorful broth, I sprinkled 1/4 cup of crumbled feta on top. We had crusty multigrain bread so we sopped up the juices with that. I plan to prepare this dish with bacon and make cornbread, and leave out the mushrooms & feta for that one. (jalapeño will be delicious with Chef John's original version I feel), and will ALWAYS wait for the full two hours.

So very, very good.  I followed the recipe exactly and got rave reviews.  It is time consuming but so worth it.  I served it with herb roasted chicken and rice pilaf.

Amazing! Not sure how a little bit of tomato makes this big of a difference in a pot of beans but man it sure does. A word of caution, however.  If you are viewing this recipe in an app, you are missing some of the directions and are possibly unable to watch the video. I suggest you exit the app and go to the actual website to view the video. This seems to happen often with the allrecipes app. I've had several recipes that didn't turn out right. I discovered that the apps leave off many of the footnotes you see on the website. Also, it seems whoever edits info for the app gets a little editing happy. Now, as far as the beans! Wow, wow, wow! Fabulous. I made this huge pot, the whole time worrying it would make way too much. For normal sized servings, this would serve a small army.  However, nobody who eats these will want normal servings. My family of four (who are all physically fit and moderate eaters) went through the whole pot in one meal! My thirteen year old passed up her favorite dessert (judys strawberry pretzel salad from this site) to have room for more beans.

Made this for a Thanksgiving side dish and everyone loved it. I added a clove of garlic (Just because I tend to do that with everything) Also, after making the sauce, poured it over fresh trimmed green beans in the crockpot on cooked on low 6 hours. Perfect!

WARNING: Chef John's slow cooked green beans may cause you to die from joy.    Think of every superlative word for "tasty food," and that's this recipe.    My only suggestion is to consider using more of every ingredient except the green beans.   Chef John's recipes proportions are wonderful, but those ingredients make a fabulously delicious sauce that most of my friends enjoy sopping up with bread, spoons, fingers, etc.

I cook green beans like this 2-3 times a year (raised in Alabama), but I've never seen tomato in them before.  Adds an interesting flavor and we may add it again next time!  We also like to add a handful of diced new potato about halfway through.  Spritz with a vinegar hot sauce to serve (we like Texas Pete's) and, as you mentioned, cornbread, and - well, it's wonderful.

I didn't like this recipe at all. The taste was okay but I would not make it again. To spend over 2 hours cooking this was not worth it.

Tastes just like the green beans at BBQ restaurants. Worth the wait. I used frozen green beans. Fresh is too much work.

I made these beans for the first time for my Thanksgiving meal as a way of getting a bean dish on the stove and cooking long before the mad rush of mealtime.  (And what better time to experiment with a recipe than a holiday meal? ) Wow, what a hit!    Everyone loved them and I had scant leftovers.  

I made the recipe exactly as directed, but used a tomato paste/water mix instead of tomato sauce as I had a partially used can of tomato already opened.  

This is a definite keeper that will be made again.  Thanks, Chef John!!!!!!

Amazing flavor!  This is a winner at my house and will definitely make it again.  I varied the ingredients slightly with substitutions and put it all in the slow cooker for 3 hours on high.  I used frozen green beans and 3 oz. bag of real bacon bits.

The cooking time was worth it.  I made everything in one deep, 12 inch skillet.  I used chicken stock I made from a couple of smoked chickens and frozen and pureed tomatoes from my garden that I had canned last year. I also added a bit of sugar. Family loves it for holiday dinners. Once everything is mixed together and heated, you can transfer to a preheated crockpot and leave it for about 4 hours while you cook the rest of your holiday dinner.

Made this for Christmas dinner exactly as written and it was delicious . A nice change from all of the creamy green bean casserole recipes out there. Like another reviewer, I made it a day ahead and agree that the flavor was ever better the second day. No tomato flavor which is what I was a little worried about. There were no leftovers of this dish! Enjoy!

I have made this recipe TWICE !!  The first time I used young, skinny beans and I over-cooked the onions and bacon before adding the beans to the 3-quart saucepan.  I also added too much cayanne pepper.   So buy the more mature larger beans and don't look for a lot of browning of the onions and err on the side of too little cayenne instead of too much.  But the end result is FANTASTIC !!!

Really flavorful beans.  Made this with some garden string beans.   I added a handful of halved cherry tomatoes from our garden in lieu of tomato sauce.  I'm a weirdo about having measurements for spices, so I added 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper,  a little more than 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and just a quick pinch of salt, but I don't care for a lot of salt.  They turned out delicious.  My husband raved about them. We also added 3-4 small red potatoes because we had them around.

At last, a recipe that actually cooks the green beans. People who say they don't like green beans have been trying to eat them practically raw. Granted, they may look prettier that way, but in my opinion, they taste awful. Chef John's method is called "cooking them down." They absorb the flavors of all the added ingredients. My personal preference is the old family recipe that uses only the bacon, salt and pepper and the beans. Even canned beans will work  (drain and rinse them, though). Then top the finished dish with chopped, fresh, sweet onion. Succulent is just the right word.

Chef John, I think I love you! (*smiles*) I've been looking for a simple way to cook spectacular green beans for a long time. But this is It! Thanks so much for hitting it out of the park once again. (And about the I love you thing...not getting fresh, just creatively expressing my excitement and appreciation for another one of your exceptional culinary creations.)

Now, my favorite green beans!!! I used frozen so didn't saute green beans in skillet, after browning onions, garlic and deglazing the  skillet put everything on low in slow cooker for 6 hours. So good I ate a bowl for breakfast. Some may want an extra pinch of cayenne, depending on taste, I did and they were FANTASTIC!

So very good! Made these for Thanksgiving. They have a little Kick to them so the spicy flavor was very welcome with all the other seemingly sweet things that were served. Very easy to make. Didn't change anything in the recipe. They just simmered on the back burner while I made everything else. A keeper for sure!

I usually love Chef John's recipes, but this one didn't do anything for me.  It wasn't bad, rather just seemed like it was missing something.  The sauce was tasty, however the beans didn't really seem to take on that flavor very much.  Definitely not worthy of the rave reviews, but that's just my opinion.  Maybe I did something wrong?  I probably will not make these again.

I have NEVER had any green beans this good! I made it 4 times over the summer. The only thing I added was the liquid from a smoked brisket and it took it to another level entirely. The last time I added around 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar at the very end before serving. I highly recommend this recipe just as written but the extra smoked liquid from the brisket was awesome.

Wow, wow, wow.  Not sure I can eat plain green beans anymore. I followed the directions exactly, but it did take me 4c of broth to barely cover my beans. And I was pretty generous with the salt and pepper and added some Sazon Goya (mexican seasoning packet) bc it makes everything taste better. I was cooking for 6, and it was gone quick, with little left for second helpings. Wish I would have made a bigger pot.

Finally, a green bean recipe that I actually enjoy!  I'm not a huge fan of green beans, and I've tried many of the high rated recipes here, included the ones way more popular than this one, but I've got to say that this one is by far the superior option.  I even ate the leftovers the next day!  I've been using this site for years and this is my very first review, which should say something.  This deserves all the attention it could get.  

Best thing is I changed nothing to get it to where I liked it.  Since my wife likes the flavor of onions, yet hates the texture, I minced them, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. 

Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe as written. It was absolutely delicious melt in your mouth southern green beans. If you are looking for crisp green beans then this recipe is not for you. I will be making these again for Thanksgiving. Yum.

The first bite was with a fork, and I thought 'meh'. Then... I got a spoon. OMG, it was love at first bite. I think of it as a green bean soup. Comfort food at it's best, ya'll. You gotta love it.

OH YES YES YES!! Thank you. I have always strayed from fresh veggies some odd reason. I love green beans but I can't stand the crunch and texture of most fresh greens so this flip the bill  totally made an impact on my  table.  Standard green bean casserole needs to take a back seat, we got a big time keeper. 
As you say OPTIONAL to skim the grease or no. I kept it but I'm skimming next time in case my guests don't like it. Either way All the words describing these beans are SPOT ON. And the aroma that fills the house...OMYGOODGRAVY!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!! I wanted an idea on what to do with the leftover scraps & bones with meat of the fried turkey my husband prepared for New Years Day.  I decided to boil it down, pluck out the bones, & use it for the base of this recipe instead. Other than that, I followed the precise directions. It was so very tasty & yummy. The addition of the tomatoes took this recipe over the top! s it was cooking, my family kept asking what are you cooking; the house smells great, what’s in that pot. At dinnertime my family of four didn’t leave much green beans in the pot. It was a hit! Thank you!!!

I'm not a fan of Southern cooking, per se--too many things are cooked to death--but these were perfect! My Southern husband, his Southern uncle and our kids loved them! (So did I)

Plus, had enough liquid left over at the end of the night, I'm going to use it as the base for vegetable soup. Can't beat a dish like that!

Simple but Chef John hits it out of the park again. Made the stock from a roast chicken carcass the day before (earmarked for this purpose). Doubled (maybe tripled) the garlic and used kaiserfleisch lardons and tomato paste. 

Had it over rice with a bit of leftover sliced chicken breast from the roast as a beans-and-rice variant. Absolute corker!

I made a double batch of these beans for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews! I cooked them the day before and reheated them before serving.

Interesting to try. A little cayenne goes a long way in this one. Don't think I'll make it again.

Was a little nervous using tomato sauce in green beans but will probably always use this recipe for my beans from here on out!

Exactly what I was looking for.  How ever you want to season this, the key is the long cook time.  I’m a fan of adding the cayenne- even my picky kids like it.

I made this dish according to the recipe aside from subbing 6 peeled San Marzano tomatoes for the tomato sauce as other reviewers suggested. It was a good dish but not  2.5 hrs good. I see this as a ham and green beans in the crockpot kind of meal..just toss in some tomatoes near the end.

A different twist on the ordinary, and worth it. I love tomatoes so this was obvious choice for me. I didn't have bacon thawed so I used 2 teaspoons of lard. Taste was awesome, can't wait to make again.

These were amazing!! Like just about everyone, I modified the recipe slightly to use what I had on hand. I cut the recipe in half because I only had one pound of beans. The main things I did differently was doubled the bacon (because why not?), added a splash of red wine vinegar, a little Frank's Red Hot sauce, a pinch of sugar, and one can of sliced new potatoes.  I'm sure we would have loved it as written though. This is a keeper.

very savory and simple to make. yes, it does take 2 full hours to simmer but its a great way to try something new, for me any way, never had green beans like this. Per another reviewer, I followed the video and did it all in one pot. Tasty!

5 Stars and More!!!!!  I was raised on these kind of green beans so it was great to take a walk down memory lane with this recipe.  I did use seasoned salt and at the end a splash of lemon (one wedge).  Also dumped the whole mixture in the crock pot and cooked on high for about 2 1/2-3 hours.  From now on this is going to be my "Go-To" recipe for green beams especially for big gatherings and holidays.  Thanks so much Chef John for a wonderful recipe!

A friend introduced me to what she called “East Tennessee Green Beans”. It was pretty much this same recipe except she added sugar so there was a salty/sweet thing going on. Oh and there was no tomato sauce. The addition intrigued me so next time I made it, I included the sauce. It made a nice addition.  But what do I call them now?

This reminded me of the stewed green beans at Old Country Buffet. I liked the bacon flavor,  but make sure your bacon is as crisp as possible,  otherwise the pieces will be sort and limp by the end of cooking.

Chef John nails it - again! Potluck at work requested green beans. While two other green bean dishes were also available, Chef John's recipe had the empty pot. Great taste and texture, super easy to prepare. My new go to green bean recipe!

Absolutely the BEST part of Thanksgiving dinner. The juice is delicious to drizzle on your plate instead of gravy. I like mine a bit spicy so I add more cayenne pepper on my personal plate.

I made this for the first time for my  family's Thanksgiving  dinner and it was a hit.  I will be making it in the future this for sure.  Easy and the aroma will make your mouth water until it's done.  Thank you Chef John!!

I made this recipe last week and it was excellent! I did what another reviewer said and sprinkled a little of brown sugar in it while it was simmering.....very good! It gave a little hint of sweetness to each bite.

Followed recipe using fresh tomatoes. It was good. Not exactly my style of cooking but it was a nice change of pace. Of course my husband liked it - anything with bacon.  I have lots of beans fresh from my garden right now so it was a good way to use up a bunch.

This was the best green bean recipe ever! I did make a substitution. Instead of the pepper, I added probably lol a 1/4 cup raw brown sugar and it turned out amazing. I’ll follow the recipe exactly next time though being I haven’t made it yet

We followed the recipe precisely -- and between the two of us, we have 90 years in the kitchen, so feel confident that we didn't make an error.   These beans were bland, and not worth the ingredients or effort.

This recipe was great. It reminded me of the green beans that my grandma used to make when I was growing up. It was just a touch on the sweet side, so I would use white onion instead of sweet yellow onions next time. Otherwise, cool beans!

The only change I made is that I had some pickled pork on hand so I cut it into small pieces and put a little vegetable oil to replace the bacon.  The cornbread is in the oven now.  Yummy good!

Forgiving recipe — I made a mistake by forgetting the garlic until I had already added the tomatoes and string beans.  Still, the first word out of my wife's mouth was "Wow!"  So I'll be making it again, and will try not to goof up this time.  I can easily see this becoming a staple.

Absolutely delicious! It's amazing that with just a few ingredients the green beans were full of flavor. I actually sliced and sautéed the onions and added sherry to deglaze before putting the other ingredients in. This will definitely be one of my go to recipes!

I grew up eating canned beans. As an adult, I have enjoyed green bean fresh and a bit crunchy so I was a little unsure of this recipe. However, how could I not take Chef John's dare and give them a try? I was happy I did. I followed the recipe but needed 5 cups of broth to cover the 2 lbs of beans. I baked corned bread in a cast iron skillet (isn't that the Southern way to do it?) and man oh man, did it soak the juice up well! The downside? Mine were not as visual appealing as Chef's and I feel like I cannot skip the gym this evening. Much love to the Chef!

My hat is off to you!  Made as written and these beans are best that I have ever made.  As an ex-pat living in Hungary and married to a Hungarian picky-eatin' woman, even she loved them.  Only change 'sauce pan' to at least a 5 qt dutch-oven, as 2 lbs of whole green beans take up a lot of pan!

I vegetarian-ized it...so used vegetable broth and omitted bacon. To compensate for that saltiness, I added a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. It was so delicious. My whole family loved it.

I followed the directions on the video and not the written direction.  I used a whole package of bacon and doubled the seasonings.  My boyfriend said it was lacking and next time I should put some potatoes in with it.  Per the suggestion of another reviewer I made cornbread to go with it.  This was a Fantastic suggestion!  I used the buttermilk cornbread recipe from the app.  The cornbread was the best part of the meal, haha. I would make this again but add potatoes

Amazing!  I will be making this again - it is the best way to cook the mounds of beans I'm harvesting from my garden!

This is the best recipe I have found for fresh green beans and I have made it twice and a couple of minor changes. I used the entire small can of tomato sauce and added a can ( 6 oz I believe) of mild diced tomatoes with green chillies). I also used chicken broth but I used the whole container which was 4 to 5 cups. I will probably use this recipe anytime I get to craving fresh green beans. Thanks again for a Fantastic Recipe.

WOW!  Amazing green beans!  So full of flavor and super easy.  I made these in my presto pot, so I could saute and slow cook in the same pan, since I didn't want to heat up the house with the stove on.  It didn't mention in the instructions to cover with a lid or not while simmering, but I did cover mine to keep it juicy.  I halved the recipe and reduced the chicken broth to only 1 cup per half the recipe, and also doubled the tomato sauce.  Even though I reduced the chicken broth, it still had plenty of liquid.  The end result was so flavorful and super delicious!  Thank you for the recipe!  This recipe will be going in with our regular meal rotation.

I did not make this recipe, but wanted to leave msg. I make one similar to these, but do not use any tomatoes, and if you cut your beans or break them each one in about 3 pcs. makes them easier to eat....and yes they are delicious my way without the tomato, but I may try them  Chef John's way ...but don't know why people cook the bean whole.....best to cut them or as southern says break them in two -three pcs. depending on size of your bean....

I followed the recipe as written and found it very good.   This makes a lot.   I think it serves closer to 8 or 10.   I think you could get by with less bacon than the written directions state.

While looking for a side dish to accompany a dinner I was preparing for company I came upon this recipe.   I prepared it as directed.  Everyone loved it.  The recipe was easy to fix and  the green beans were so tender and juicy.   Added it to my Favorites file!  It is definitely a keeper.

I did not give this an "I made it" because I've made it about a zillion times in my life.  Thanks, CJ, for making ALL of us Southerners feel good by telling the world that we actually DO do some things right, green beans being one of them!  Everything has its variations and mine to this are few.   I pour off my excess bacon fat (into the can that I keep in the fridge) being sure to leave a good coating in the pan.  I don't trim the pointy end of the bean.  And if I happen to have them, I add a few cut up red potatoes (as I saw a lot of other reviewers do) toward the end of the cooking time.  Yes, I can eat a fancy 5 minute green bean, but this is the way they were meant to be cooked!

I was looking for a bean dish with our Christmas ham and came across this one. It is simple to make and so very yummy. It's going into my recipe book for the following years.
I have to admit I did make a change though. I used vegetable broth instead of the chicken broth and everyone just totally loved it. It's an amazing bean dish.....

Absolutely delicious!  I felt bad because my sister in law made a typical green bean casserole that no one touched and my dish was completely gone!  Can't wait to make it again on Saturday for Christmas!

I made it exactly as directed and was not overly enthused.  They were pretty  good, but I have definitely had better green beans cooked with bacon.  Seemed like a lot of work for a so-so recipe.

Sensational. In spite of the time it takes to make these, this is an incredibly easy dish to make, and perfect if you're multitasking since you don't need to keep a close eye on them. The beans are tender, the sauce has a great rich flavor, and would pair well with many different main dishes. Make as is and you won't be disappointed.

I made it just like the recipe.  The flavor was delish, but I thought the beans were best after an hour of simmering.  A little too mushy for our tastes after 1.5 hours.

Ended up adding potatoes and some more broth (two cans, about four cups) and cooking green bean mixture in a saucepan. Basically ended up as a stew in 45 minutes of simmering (potatoes almost completely broke up and the beans were very soft). Added the onion and bacon mixture at the end. The bacon/onion mixture can be made second and towards the end of the cooking of the vegetables to save time, though I'm not sure if the author intended them to be cooked together?

OMG...these are hands down the most delicious beans you will ever eat.  Do yourself a favor and follow directions exactly!  Do not be afraid of the cooking time.  Simmering the beans for the two hours allows them to soak up the delicious onion and bacon and tomato flavor.   I used my own home made tomato sauce and used low sodium chicken broth.  I plan on making  these weekly !

I thought the taste was alright but my husband didn't like it at all.  While we both like our vegetables soft (not crisp as often recommended), these beans were mushy.  I think you could cook them for half the time and accomplish the desired outcome.  I won't be finding out for sure though because I'll not be making these again.

Totally different than crisp green beans, folks! Delicious-  I made them for a dinner party of great cooks- everyone loved them! Reminds me of the delicious green beans of Cracker Barrel restaurant.

I just made this recipe  recently it is awesome.  My grandson said they are the best green beans he has eaten.  I did not have any  cayenne pepper so I substituted hot  sauce to taste not a lot just  for a little kick.  I will  use this as my go to recipe for green beans.

Made this recipe for Christmas dinner and it turned out awesome! Best green beans I have ever made. Only thing I did different is I transferred the bacon and onion mixture after sautéed to a crockpot with the green beans and cooked them for a few hours. Everyone loved them.

I did not have time to spend over the stove so I popped it all into a crock pot.  I do not recommend this method.  I will try it next time as directions indicate over the stove.  The sauce was delicious but the bacon was soggy and there was too much liquid.   I rated it a 3 because I failed, not the recipe.  the sauce was great.

Made these last night in advance to take to cousins for Thanksgiving dinner. Hubby tried some once done and raved about them!  I Left all of the bacon grease in while cooking the beans and will remove once beans are cooled in the refrigerator.

Crazy good! I followed the recipe exactly except I cut it in half because there are only two of us and my husband does not like mushy vegetables. I was worried I'd be eating this myself. About half way through I tasted a bean and thought, " what's the big deal, tastes like a bean to me." I finished cooking the whole time and WOW. I couldn't stop eating this stuff and my husband and I were fighting over the last few beans. He loved it! I asked him if he minded that they were soft (not mushy)and he said, " there's so much flavor".  My only regret is that I had cut the recipe in half. Next time I'll double it! And I'm going to buy some nice fresh Italian bread, slice it thick, a little butter and dip it in that amazing broth.

Made it, loved it - so good.   It will be a regular recipe for weekend meals.   I also volunteer for an organization that makes home made nutritious meals for low income families, seniors and the homeless.  During the summer we get donations of green beans from local farmers.  Will multiply the serving size and add to our cookbook.

This recipe is just about perfect! I made it last time with fresh green beans, but am making it today, trying it with frozen. I was asked to make green beans for 35 people for a church dinner and this recipe immediately came to mind. However, I just didn't have time to process fresh green beans so am going with frozen. Hope that works.

Leftovers are fantastic, too.

Every season since we met this recipe, we look forward to a big crop of beans from the garden.(and grow as many as possible because of this recipe) My special needs son today saw me in the garden with a big bowl for the first time this year, and immediately started saying loudly, "Bacon! Bacon!"He knows this is our most favorite way to eat beans, besides directly from the patch :) We use onions garlic, and tomatoes from the garden. The one time I used tomato paste along with the tomatoes, changed the game! I suggest to give it a try, you won't be sorry!!! (oh, and the beans don't have to be green, we grow many varieties!) Bryson's Garden:There are no Disabilities Here is on facebook. We are avid Chef John fans :)

Oh my gosh, this is delicious! I am from the south, and have cooked green beans all my life, sometimes ya just get tired of the same ol' way. Found this and just made them, They are fantastic, didn't change a thing, except  I  used my canned tomatoes and pureed them, I also used my canned green beans and cut the cooking time down quite a lot, just slow simmered them and only used 2 cups of broth (since I was using canned beans that were already cooked).  And to KitchenMom, I agree about the sauce ! I could just dip my cornbread in the sauce and make a meal!  lol. Will definitely make these again, and  for our family get togethers for sure!  :)

I make these green beans 2-3 times a month for myself! I love them! I add a bit more low sodium tomato sauce and because I love spicy, I add red pepper flakes. The smell is A-MAZ-ING! And the taste, so yummy!

Everyone loved the kick with the cayenne pepper. I love beans and now I have another great way to cook them.

Scrumptious! My kids don't like green beans and they devoured them! Best way to get them to eat veggies.

OMG this was amazing!  so worth the 2 hours it took.. i cut this in half and used Knorr's homestyle chicken stock.. i had to add an extra half cup because the liquid level was looking a bit low.. it came out perfect.. ty so much for the recipe!

Wow! This dish really took my breath away.  Even got veggies hater hooked to eating this!!! I made two changes. I didn't have any chicken stock, so I used water and chicken cubes. After simmering for an hour and 30 minutes, I mixed about two tablespoons of cornstarch with a little water and added to the pot to help thicken the sauce, because I like my sauces a little thicker. Thank you for Chef John. This is a must keep recipe. You will not regret!!!

I was in a hurry so I steamed the green beans as. I sautéed the bacon, then added the onions and garlic. I mixed in a small amount of marinara sauce. Then added the cooked beans. I didn't need the broth and forgot the cayenne or paprika. It was still awesome. Next time I'll try it the right way.

I DIDN'T HAVE 2 LBS OF GREEN BEANS, SO I CUT THE RECIPE IN 1/2. USED 1/2 ONION THE SAME AMOUNT OF GARLIC AND CAYENNE. A FRESH TOMATO HALF OF THE BROTH,ETC. IT WAS WONDERFUL! WORTH THE WAIT! I USED ONLY 3 STRIPS OF BACON BUT THE SMOKINESS AND FLAVOR OF THE BACON REALLY SHINES THROUGH!
THANKS

What a wonderful way to cook my garden beans!  The only change I made was to use a handful of bacon bits in some olive oil, as I didn't have fresh bacon on hand.  Otherwise followed Chef John's video exactly.  Hubby says this is the only green bean recipe we need from now on.

Good recipe-- I did without tomatoes cause I didn't have it and not sure if I wanted to add tomatoes with it.  I would leave out the salt or add less next time... hubbie said it was a bit salty.  I don't tend to salt my food when cooking so it may be we are not use to it be salty.  I used crush flake peppers instead of cayenne.  Served it with some meatloaf and it was a hit with the husband!
