Apple Stack Cakes basically fall into two categories - those whose layers are made from a sweetened dough which tastes more like cake and those whose layers are made from a biscuit like dough which, of course, tastes like biscuits.  This particular recipe falls into the latter category.  With this in mind - it is an excellent example of "Old Fashioned Apple Stack Cake".  The sweet/spicy apple mixture off sets the sour of the buttermilk in the layers.  If you're looking for an authentic Appalachian Mountain Stack Cake - this is it.
