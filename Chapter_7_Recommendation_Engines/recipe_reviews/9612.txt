These were sooo good!  I had to sub 3/4 cup of butter for the shortening and pecans for walnuts but these cookies were awesome. I will definately make these again.

As I'm getting ready to make a triple batch of this for Christmas, I figured I ought to rate it! I downloaded this a couple years ago, and have been using it ever since. My mom doesn't want any other kind of cookie! She doesn't like chocolate so it makes it hard to find something she likes. The recipe is very easy to make, the cookies freeze well.  And they are very, very tasty! The dates make it a nicer cookie than raisins, which can be a little tart or bitter sometimes. Great just out of the oven or a couple days later, these are a permanent addition to my recipe box.

This is a delicious cookie recipe. I've made these cookies twice in the last two weeks because they disappear so quickly. The only change I made was to add an additional half cup of dates. We're date lovers and the extra helping made them extra soft and delicious.

I doubled the recipe before printing it out. According to the recipe it should have made 48 cookies, 4 dozen. I got 11 dozen using a small cookie scoop per it calling for dropping by the teaspoon. Very good cookie and because I had so many, I sold them by the dozen to friends who also loved them. Would be great to make for bake sales or gifts. Can't imagine how big the cookies would be were there only 48. I baked 12 to a cookie sheet. They also took 10 - 12 minutes in my oven but that could very according to each over and perhaps between electric and gas, I have gas. I will make again.

Loved this recipe!  I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon and increased nuts to 1 cup to suit our tastes.
Just wish these cookies were low-cal because I
can't stop eating them.

These cookies are good - but a little "cakey" for my taste. I substituted apple sauce for the shortening, and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon as other reviewers suggested. 

If I were to make again, I'd use one less egg to make it less cake like, and would add more dates as well.

This recipe is a nice 'traditional' oatmeal cookie; but it does need to bake longer than 8 minutes. In my oven, they needed a minimum of 10 minutes.  Also, I did not use the dates; instead, I used dried cherries.  Next time I will try the dates.  I think the recipe also needs some cinnamon or some other spice to jazz it up some.  All in all though a good recipe. Mine have maintained softness days later in a plastic container.

Very good, and very moist.  Stays moist for days.  Freezes well.  Will definitely make again!  Also, will use as a base to make cookies with different fruits/nuts in them.

These cookies are absolutely delicious! Yummy! My husband asks me to make these often.  I always use fresher dates that are not sugar coated.  Next time I intend to use Fiber One in place of one cup of flour to make them a bit healthier.

These were good but too sweet for my family. Next time I will add more dates and cut down on the white sugar. I also made these vegan by using flax for the eggs which gave it a great texture and a nutty flavor without adding the walnuts.

I was very disappointed in this cookie. I love a dense, chewy oatmeal cookie, but these were cake-like. Not likely to make these again.

These are fantastic cookies and got rave reviews. I bought some cinnamon chips and was looking for a recipe to use them in. I used 1c. of the cinnamon chips instead of the walnuts, and replaced the dates with Craisins. They turned out so delicious everyone begged me to make a second batch! They do need longer than 8 minutes, but I used Air Bake pans, so maybe that's why. Highly recommended!

These cookies are easy to make.  I found them very tricky to get baked right.  They tend to get too done on the bottom while remaining doughy in the middle.  I tried lowering the oven temp and baking longer, and also making smaller cookies -- with no better results.  I "rescued" the cookies by using a grater to remove the overdone bottoms.  The cookies are a bit bland, fair for oatmeal cookies.  The dates are a nice variation and add a pleasant flavor, but I have to give these cookies only a 2.

I always find cookies too sweet so I cut the brown sugar to 3/4 C and the white down a couple of tablespoons.  Used regular oats.  Cooked 8 minutes on center rack.  Just right.  I felt there was jus a bit too much shortening.  Next time I would cut it down just a bit or add another tablespoon of flour.

I have made this three times- turns out amazing every time.  I add more dates and use Pecans because i have a lot on hand.  Also I use one cup of Large flake oatmeal and one cup of quick oats as well as cinnamon and cloves but this recipe is definitely a keeper!! (I also get 5 dozen using my small cookie scoop.)

These cookies are awesome.  I used butter instead of crisco, and pecans instead of walnuts and this turned out really good.  Very unique and easy to make.

This is an excellent recipe, in my opinion. I made it exactly as written, except I used pecans instead of walnuts. I was looking for a recipe to use up some extra dates I had in the freezer, and these cookies were just perfect. Thanks for sharing!

I cut the recipe in half and used 1 extra large egg, so my cookies came out crispy which is fine because I like crispy cookies.  A few of them had a slightly soft center but for the most part they were crispy.  I may try to make the recipe just the way it says because I do like a soft date cookie as well.  These were sweet enough for me. Would make them again.

I made these this afternoon.  They are definitely soft, in fact, in texture more like cake.  I attribute this to the three eggs.  If I make this recipe again (and I might, the taste is excellent!) I'd make it with two eggs only.  (I also used all brown sugar, but that was by accident!)  Be very careful with the time--I cut it down to 7 minutes so the cookies wouldn't be golden brown, but lightly browned and done all the way through (this was at 375).

I followed the recipe exactly, except I lowered the oven temperature by 5 degrees F. to compensate for our new faster cooking oven. They "almost" burned on the bottom and did not really brown as well on top as I would like. Stick to the 8 minutes! They were so soft, sweet and yummy that I will make them again and add to my favorite recipes.

I made it with 3/4 cup of butter instead of the shortening as another person suggested. I did double the amount of chopped dates and added toasted chopped pecans instead of walnuts.  Delicious.  Sooo much better than oatmeal raisin.  Everyone loved them. I will definitely be making these again.

what a cookie! i cut down the fliur*1 1/3cup* and added wheat germ and flax seed to make 2 cups. Also added hemp hearts in place of nuts and cut back on the white sugar to 3/4 cup. I didn't have butter so i used a good margarine to cut on fat and calories.

I was out of baking soda, so I doubled the baking powder. I used a food processor and used butter instead of shortening. No walnuts so I used pecans and everything came out great. Delicious cookies.

Very easy to make and they tasted great. I think the next time I will add 1 cup of chopped walnuts because I do like walnuts. Thanks for the recipe!  I gave my neighbor a dozen and he liked them too.

Very good soft cookie.  I used butter instead of shortening.  After tasting the first batch out of the oven, I thought it could use a little more flavor, so I added some all-spice to the remaining dough.

Yummy! I think I will add more dates next time as one reviewer suggested. I did half the batch exactly as per the recipe and to the second half I added some wheat germ (about 1/4 cup) and 1/4 cup toffee bits just for variety  (and my sweet tooth)  Both are very good.

I love these cookies. I had a very large bag of fresh dates, and searched for a new recipe to try. These are very soft and taste great. Easy to prepare, and well worth trying.
I put half the batch in the freezer, and they even taste great straight out of the freezer. I will make these again!

These cookies have a very soft texture.  I used 1 1/2 cups of dates instead of 1 cup.  The cookies are a bit bland, but I'm not quite sure what they need.  My friends thought they were great, however.  The next time I make date cookies I'll try another recipe.

These cookies give chocolate chip cookies a run for they money. I substituted butter for shortening and I used pecans since that's what i had but did everything else the same. A wonderful plus is that they keep well. The next day they will be just as soft as when they first came out the oven, making them easy gifts. I overcooked my first batch a bit and you couldn't tell at all. Im going on and on but i loved these so much i had cookies before bed and for breakfast the next day.

I will make it again. Used half whole wheat flour and half Robin Hood. Cut the white surgar by 1/3 and added 2 tablespoons of maple syrup. Very good recipe. Took longer than 8 minutes in my oven 10 minutes with fan on.

Made these for the granddaughter. Needed a soft cookie and these are perfect. Read the reviews and some said they were 'cakey' and that's what I was looking for. I skipped the white sugar and  added 1/3 cup applesauce to ensure softness. Perfect soft cookies. 8min was fine and ensured the cookies were not too browned. I used a 1" cookie scoop.

A little sweet, but that's what cookies are supposed to be, right?  Will cut down on the sugar a tad next time.  Use small scoop.  These cookies really spread out.  Baking time for me turned out to be 12-13 minutes.  Otherwise this would definitely be a 5 star recipe.  4.5 as is.  Awesome flavor!  These didn't last long.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks.

My son made this recipe as  a project for Home Ec 1. 
The only difference that was in our recipe was that we put the dates, walnuts, and sugars into the Food Processor. Pulsed them several times until they were smallish chunks. Then we stirred in as in Step 6 . 
Also... if you want crispy, yummy goodness.... make sure that you use the Butter flavored shorting! It never lets us down!
