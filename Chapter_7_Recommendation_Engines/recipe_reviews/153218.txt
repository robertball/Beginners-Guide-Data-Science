I have to say that this pie came out amazing. It was very simple to make, and tastes fantastic. This was the first pie I have ever baked from scratch (I used the No Fail Pie Crust recipe) and it came out better than anything my parents have ever made. My dad said it rivaled my grandmothers, so I know it has something going for it. The vanilla and maple syrup add interesting notes of flavor.  In summary, great tasting and easy to make. I loved it.

Prepared this pie for Thanksgiving and I hit it outta the park..!!  I did bake the crust a bit before adding the apples though.  The crust was perfect in every way.  The pie was the belle of the ball..!!  I was very proud of it too, as it's my 1st pie and I'm 57.  I'm gonna bake the Christmas edition in my new Emile Henri deep dish pie pan - a thank you gift.  Thanx for sharing, Laura.

Just what I was waiting for!! So much flavor. I have been looking for a recipe for apple pie for years that encompasses the cinnamon and nutmeg flavors and I could never find the right one. Now I have found it! Thank you!! Now, this is the only apple pie recipe I use for my family. I made this recipe twice. Once with pie crust on top and once with a crumb topping. Both ways are excellent! This is not your grandmother's "traditional" apple pie. I absolutely LOVE IT!

I didn't find this to be sweet enough, would probably add a bit more maple syrup next time.

I have made this 3 times now and it is my husbands favorite apple pie recipe. The cook time is way too SHORT though. I have increased it up to 1 hour 15 minutes to try to get the crust done and some of the soup cooked. Next time I make it I will add the 2 TBL flour to the cinn / sugar mixture someone else suggested. I also did brush a beaten egg on the top crust and sprinkled it with some sugar and cinnamon.

I made this pie in a gluten and dairy free pie crust.  This was a really great spin on the traditional apple pie and had really good flavor, I just prefer the traditional apple pie more.

I loved this recipe, I thought it was amazing and not too maple flavored.  It was just perfect.  I did add 3 tablespoons of flour so it wasnt runny, it was amazing!

I have just tried this recipe.  I do think the amount of sugar and the baking times are off a bit.  The 1/2 cup sugar was WAY too little(the pie was too tart.  And the 30 minute cooking time was WAY too short,Unless you like raw apples and under cooked crust. I tried to repair it but to no avail.  I made this just the way the recipe called forand it fell way to short.

I really like the flavor of the pie. But the baking time for me at 350 degrees took 1 hour, and I brushed the top crust with whole milk and sprinkled it with sugar. And next time I will be adding a couple tablespoons flour so the pie isn't runny.

Great flavor.  I ended up cooking it longer, more like an hour. Take it out when the juices bubble.

I found the pie had a lot of liquid when I cut it... It may have something to do with the type of apples I used.. It tasted good , but soggy!

Excellent Pie for a first time pie-maker (me). I used 5 large Golden Delicious apples... ended up with enough filling for 2 pies instead of one. But hey, the more the merrier! Also that means 2 pies for the price of 1 (plus a little for more crust). But it's excellent.

I made this for Thanksgiving while I was visiting my sister. I was looking for a recipe that used maple syrup. It was a real crowd pleaser for both young and old. I added raisins and walnuts to make the pie a bit more festive.  It was a combo that really worked.  I think next time I would add one extra tbsp of maple syrup, to bring out that flavor more.

Very good recipe that is low in sugar and brings out the taste of the apples. I forgot to include the spices and the pie still came out quite well. Only change that I did to the recipe was sprinkle some granulated sugar on the top pie crust.

I made this for a bake sale and it disappeared. I will definitely make it again.

This was recipe was easy to follow & my family LOVED it!!  I did add some flour to it before I put the top pie crust on & bathed the top pie crust with an egg wash...YUMMY!!  I highly recommend this recipe!!
