As I was making a single serving, I toasted the bread in the toaster. As written, it's good but I think some fresh basil and a sprinkle of cheese would make it outstanding. Anyway, thanks, Brenda!

This definitely was "E-Z" and gives toast and tomatoes a nice Italian twist! This is very easy to adjust to suite your personal tastes.  I opted out of the butter and drizzled a little olive oil on the bread.  I also added fresh basil and Parmesan cheese.  Next time I might use fresh mozzarella and a splash of balsamic vinegar - delish!

Really good recipe as is, but I personalize it a bit. Before I toast the slices, I spread a couple of teaspoons of good quality jarred pesto on the slices. Family loves it!
