DELICIOUS!!!!  I had to make a few changes but it still came out wonderful.
I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of stuffing, light/reduced fat sour cream, garlic powder instead of salt.  I ommitted the butter and sprayed tops of chicken, once breaded,  with butter flavored Pam cooking spray.   I broiled the dish the last few minutes of baking to give it a golden brown color.  The changes definately cut down on the fat and makes for a healthier dish.  WOW, it was so so good.  The kids asked for seconds!!  They asked for me to make this every night!!
Thanks for the great recipe.

OMG This is delish! I've been making this for about 3 months now so I could check out some variations. I will only use Stove Top Chicken Flavor cause that turns out the best every time (dumped the package in a large ziploc and roll over with a rolling pin a few times, gives it just enough crush to cover chicken but still crunch!). There's something about the lemon juice, soy sauce & sour cream combo that seems perfect. I mix it up in a bowl and let the chicken sit in it for about 5 min. Is it possible that this tenderizes the meat some? Dunno, but its moist and tasty every time! I use garlic powder & celery salt, which seems to work for us without being too salty. The melted butter on top is essential as I found out. Hubby LOVES this & so does everyone I make it for. Serve with something green &    cranberry sauce and it feels like a holiday! Too good for words. Thanks so much!

Wow, too much salt!!!   57% of the daily allowance is entirely too much for just one dish.  The salty taste drowns out other more desireable flavors.  Use celery seed, instead of celery salt, garlic powder instead of garlic salt and eliminate the soy sauce.  There is plenty to salt in the stuffing mix and sour cream to accomadate the dish.

I was surprised how good these chicken breats were.  I didn't have any celery salt, but I think that is okay as they were already a little salty.  If I make again I will try crushing the stuffing mix first as it was difficult for some of the larger pieces to stick to the chicken.  I also only cooked my chicken breast for 30 minutes and they were done perfectly.  Fifty minutes seems like a very long time to cook boneless chicken breasts.

Holy Cow --- the amount of salt in this recipe is astounding!   NO ONE needs this much salt at any one seating!   There are many ways to substitute the amount of salt in this recipe without losing any of the flavor.  We always use fresh garlic instead of garlic SALT, using low-sodium soy sauce is also a good idea.  Celery SALT isn't needed, either.  Using celery seed actually gives the chicken a fresher taste.

Forget the Lemon juice... use FRESH LIME JUICE! The flavor is just remarkable! I doubled the sauce and marinated the breasts for 6 hours. (I agree with other that cut the cooking time, depending on the size of the breasts.) I heated the extra sauce (With a tad bit of cornstarch to thicken it) and laced it over the breasts, as a light "gravy". Served with Brown Rice and fresh-steamed brocolli...AWESOME!

This one is a keeper! I cut the recipe in half and it easily fed my family of four. Other than that, I made it as written with no changes or substitutions. Super easy to throw together. It was very good tasting, and a big hit with even my picky eater kids! To those that are slamming the recipe on sodium content alone, there are ways to cut back. You can use low-sodium soy sauce and unsalted butter and cut the garlic & celery salts back (obviously). It isn't helpful to slam a recipe on salt content alone without knowing if you tried to make the recipe.

This was OK. Of course, like everyone else, I recommend using garlic powder and celery seed. Also, make sure you use a good quality stuffing, because that makes a huge difference. If I make this again, I think I would try crushed croutons because I wasn't crazy about the stuffing. Also, do let the chicken marinate in sour cream mix in the fridge for about a half hour.

I couldn't rate this recipe 5 stars because I didn't have the stuffing mix.  Instead I used Kashi 7 grain corn flakes smashed up.  My kids rated it a 5  and asked me to make it again soon.

This recipes has been in my file since 2002.  We call it Crunchy Chicken.   People need to know that you are allowed to make lower-sodium substitutions to recipes that are posted,if you are worried about your sodium intake.  I use worcestershire sauce in place of the soy sauce, garlic powder in place of garlic salt, and celery seed instead of celery salt.  I've also used fresh minced garlic and diced celery too to replace the herbs.  I also add a pinch of paprika for color.  This is a very simple recipe for a busy week night.  Thanks for posting your recipe, EmilyFrank.

THE BEST!!  I used boneless, skinless breast only.  I did not use butter at all.  I replaced the garlic salt with garlic powder.  I used 1/4t black pepper.   I let my chicken marinade in the liquid and spice mixture for a couple hours while I went to church.  Then when I came home,  I used Stouffers Chicken stuffing with 1 cup of plain bread crumbs and mixed them real well for the coating in a large ziploc bag.  This was the first dish that my husband cleaned off his entire meat before the side dish.  He and I both had seconds and can't wait to eat it again!.  This was so fantastic, I will make this regularly.  I cooked it for 30 min at 375, then shut off the oven and let my chicken sit in the oven for 10 more minutes while I finished the rice.  This is a must have and must make.

My husband and I both enjoyed the juicy-ness of the chicken as well as the unique taste of the sour cream coating blended with the stuffing.

I am giving this 4 stars b/c I had to try it a couple times to get it just how I liked it.  I modified as follows:  Used a seasoned cruton mix (like what you would stuff a turkey with) instead of the "stove top" stuffing, and I quick fried the chicken in oil so that the outside was a nice golden brown and then transfered all the chicken pieces to a wire rack upon a cookie sheet.  That way the oil could drip down and be caught on the pan.  I baked them at the suggested time for only about 15-20 minutes.  PERFECT!  I love the taste of the "marinade" with the sour cream and soy sauce.  I did not have any celery salt or celery seed so i just used a little bit of garlic salt.  But not too much cause the soy sauce was salty enough.  Husband really liked it the second time around once I had made those modifications.  This will be another one added to our menu rotation! :o)

YUM!  This is TASTY!  Enough already with the "Salt Police."  If you don't want that much salt, don't add it, or move on to a different recipe.  Simple.

Made as directed, except used planko bread crumbs (gluten free) instead of stuffing mix. The sour cream mixture kept the chicken very moist.

While this is a great recipe, it has way to much sodium. Have to reduce the sodium while preserving the taste.

Excellent - I've used stuffing mix, cornflakes, cheerios, bread crumbs, and croutons (all crushed of course) the mix of seasonings and sour cream is what makes the dish though! I also think the seasonings in the sour cream are entirely to taste and have used more less and slightly different combinations (onion powder! :)) A great recipe thanks EmilyKFrank :)

Based on salty reviews of others, I changed garlic salt to garlic powder.  Reduced celery salt to 1 t. and put about 1 t. Paul Prudhomme's poultry magic in.  Needed a little more stuffing than the recipe indicates, also, but had a big bag of it so that wasn't a problem.

Served this first time for husband and friends who said it was fabulous (it was!).  I did let the chicken soak up some of the mixture for about 30-40 minutes before coating it with the stuffing.  It had a GREAT taste and the chicken was very tender.  This will definitely be on the make-it-again list.

I actually didnt add any, subed the garlic salt for just powdered garlic, no celery salt (didnt have any) added thyme,  and pepper. Pounded my chicken breast and put at 375 for only 20 min! Came out moist and yummy. :) Thnks!

I liked it very much and to me this is not too salty; after all you just dip the chicken in the salty mixture. It could be that those who have rated this negatively have used a stuffing containing too much salt...

Although I altered the recipe....this was AMAZING!!! My kids went crazy!! Even my little one who hates chicken...completely devoured it!! I substituted teriyaki for soy (all i had), subbed seasoning salt for celery salt, subbed garlic powder for garlic salt for garlic powder and subbed stuffing for panko. I will be making this again and again!!

This is my first review I've ever written on here.  Loved this recipe!  I used celery seed and garlic powder.  I didn't have any lemon juice, so I used the same amount of lemon/lime soda.  I also didn't have any stuffing mix or bread crumbs, so I crunched up croutons, then when I ran out of that, I crunched up Doritos.  Both ways tasted fantastic!  Both my husband and 6 yr old loved it.  Even though I changed the recipe a little, I thought it was a great starting point and wouldn't have put the ingredients together if I hadn't run across this recipe - therefore I give it 5 stars.

This was really good. My only issue with this was with the mixture that you dip it in before the 'breading' topping. Once  baked, you couldn't taste anything other than the stuffing topping (which was great!) but I almost felt like what was underneath was a waste of time & ingredients. I may just do a simple egg wash next time. I also cut down the sodium intake. Thanks for a great new way to cook chicken- it was all in all yummy!!

I really like this recipe.  The only thing I changed was the garlic powder instead of salt and low sodium soy.  I didn't think it was too salty at all.

Kids and hubby liked the chicken and it was easy to prepare.  I used the bag Pepperidge Farms stuffing not the Stove Top, low-sodium soy sauce and unsalted butter and it was not salty.  I did cut back on the unsalted butter (to 2 tablespoons) and only put a small drizzle on top.  I pounded out the chicken before coating with the sour cream mixture and stuffing and baked them on 350 for 25 minutes and they were way over 165degrees.  Modifications for next time would be: check chicken internal temperature after 20 min, use Greek Yogurt instead of sour cream, omit butter and use Pam spray as another reviewer did to keep the topping more crunchy.  Picture posted.

I agree with a previous reviewer.  There is enough sodium in this recipe to stroke out an elephant!  When will we start to realize that salt is as dangerous as sugar, perhaps more so!

Looks delish, but I am on a sodium restricted diet so will skip the salt and use garlic powder and skip the processed stuffing mix and make a salt free breading using cornmeal flour and spices. Think it still deserves 5 stars though.

Great recipe.  Instead of bread crumbs I use crushed corn flakes, Post Toasties, General Mills, generic, whatever, corn flakes is corn flakes.  Season crushed flakes as desired.

The taste was really good! I will try less butter on top next time, it made the bottoms mushy.

I have to say that if you are going to take a break from all diets, counting sodium content, and just be naughty for a night this is hands down one of the, if not the best recipe for baked chicken. Come on who does not like things smoothered in sour cream and YES topped with butter. 

I have made it a few times and have found even some of my pickiest eaters will not just eat it but ask for seconds. I would say if you don't like to much salt then switch out the garlic salt to powder, but PLEASE do not remove the soy sauce or celery salt. It adds something in every bite. 

The only thing I did add was the Zest of the Lemon to mixture. To be honest I am not sure if it made any difference but it sure is fun saying "And the ZEST of one lemon" I guess somehow makes it sound smart!!! When in all reality its still the Butter, Sour Cream, and Salt that makes it the best:)
Live a little and give it a try!

This is an absolute favorite in my house.  Even my picky 3 year old asks for seconds.  Like many others I made changes.  I do not use celery salt.  I go with garlic powder over the salt.  I use reduced fat sour cream, and I always use the Cornbread seasoned Stove Top stuffing mix.  I put it in my grinder until it's fine before breading the chicken.

When I pulled this out of the oven I was worried.  I told my bf "if we can't eat it, Cracker Barrell has fried chicken tonight"!  We did not have to eat out!  It was very good.  The flavor was amazing and the chicken was moist and tender.  The problem was how it looked.  The coating looked wet in spots and dry in spots.  It really looked bad.  I'm glad it was just the two of us.  I would not have served this to a guest.  The changes I made were, 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder instead of the salt, and 1 tsp celery seed instead of the salt, and low sodium soy sauce.  I don't think it was salty at all.  I think next time I will cook it at 425 for a shorter time of course.  Maybe that'll help the crust crisp.

This chicken is wonderful!  I used garlic powder in place of garlic salt.  I also omitted the celery salt (we just don't like it).  You can use buttermilk instead of sour cream but the coating won't stick as well.  My family and I loved this!!

The ingredients are rather unusual, but very worth trying. The original recipe does have too much salt. I used lite soy sauce and sour cream. Replaced the garlic and celery salts with crushed garlic and celery seed. Increased the lemon a bit for more tang, and used the low sodium stuffing mix. Have the chicken breasts marinate for at least 4 hours. This gets rave reviews by family and friends.

Really loved this one as did hubby. I always read the ratings & comments on recipes I use. So I was aware of the "too salty" comments and was wary as I do not like anything too salty. I did use garlic powder but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I did take the advice and let the chicken for marinate for 30 minutes. I also think the discussion on cooking times must depend on size of the breasts. Mine were fairy large and it did take 35 minutes.

REALLY great! The different blend of seasonings makes it something like I haven't tasted before. Only difference is I used real whole chicken pieces, i.e. legs, thighs, etc., not just white meat filets, (this would be more accurate if it said "Best Baked Chicken Breast Filets", because it only states boneless chicken breasts) because they have more flavor, are juicier, and everything is better with the bone it. Otherwise, it's great. Love the texture of the coating mix. Fantastic idea and doesn't take long to whip up!

Used low fat sour cream, low sodium soy sauce, garlic powder instead of salt and eliminated celery salt.  Don't forget there is salt in stuffing mix.  Also eliminated butter and drizzled with olive oil instead.  Turned out good and everyone enjoyed.

As written, I'll give this 3 stars because of the high salt level!  But if you omit the 2 tsp celery salt (replace with 1/2 tsp celery seed) and the 2 tsp garlic salt (replace with 2 tsp garlic powder) plus add some parsley for color and finally cut the butter in half (which also cuts some more salt and fat) then it becomes a 4 star dish.  I used Pepperidge Farm stuffing which has quite a bit of salt, but nice seasonings.  I'd recommend this recipe with the salt cutbacks when you need to make something quick, but I wouldn't make it for company.

What a hit!  My little kids loved it as did the adults!  I changed it only because I didn't have stove top stuffing.  I used Ceasar flavored croutons instead.  I put a bunch into a large ziploc and had my 7 year old pound them into crumbs with a rolling pin.  She loved it!  And I also used garlic powder instead of salt.  Prep time was quick which is nice when you have 3 little ones and was very flavorful!  I like the suggestion of putting the chicken on a wire rack on a cookie sheet so the bottom doesn't get soggy and will try that next time but all in all, what a great dish that I will make over and over again!

I really liked this recipe.  I marinated the chicken in the sour cream mixture (although I substituted yogurt)  like previous reviewers.  The chicken turned out really tender and juicy.  I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and left out the celery salt.  Great, easy chicken.  Only four stars because it wasn't very spicy, but it's not really meant to be.

I made this recipe with no changes. It was very good. It was a tad bit salty for me. I might try 1 tsp garlic salt instead of 2, and maybe 1/2 tsp garlic powder. But I won't change anything else. Yum.

After reading other reviews I used low sodium soy sauce, celery seed and garlic powder but still found it a little salty.  Husband didn't think so though.  Chicken was very nice and juicy as well as flavorful.  Might try using a little less of the stuffing mix.  I suspect that's where the salt was.

Made exactly as stated. Although this was good, it didn't leave me wanting more. My breadcrumb stuffing never did crunch up. I will say the chicken was extremely tender. Very easy to prepare.

This is a good recipe. I would probably rated this 4 stars, but given that everyone else in the family loved it, especially the picky ten year old, it has to get 5 stars. I made the recipe exactly as written, except I subbed 1/2 cup of Ranch dip, only because I was low on Sour Cream, but I don't think it made any difference in taste. Making this again tonight!

Very good and easy to make. Everyone loved it. I used skinless boneless chicken breasts cut into smaller pieces. Used garlic powder and Old Bay instead of garlic salt and celery salt and glad i did, otherwise it would have been too salty. Also forgot to add butter but it was still yummy. Making it again tonight!

Made a lot of variations. No soy sauce and used garlic and onion powder vs salt and lime juice vs lemon.  Also I used crushed tortilla chips since that was all I had- amazing! I agree that this recipe as written would be too salty for me, but it is easy to modify for your own tastes.  This was a messy and somewhat time consuming recipe for me, as I am a lazy cook, but I will probably make again since it was so good. I made it with drumsticks since that was what I had; looking forward to trying it with chicken breasts.

This was definitely different than most of the baked chicken recipes we've tried.  We mean that in a good way! It was tender, crunchy, and full of flavor! It's definitely a keeper! Only thing we did differently was to substitute the lemon for lime.  I also made half with chicken crouton stuffing mix and half with French bread crumbs.  Both versions tasted equally good!

Very good, very easy.  I was a little concerned that I might find it too salty so I replace garlic salt with garlic powder and I was great.  This will go in my regular rotation.

We all really liked this. I took the suggestion of using chicken stuffing and rolled it out with a rolling pin.  It was delicious!  Cut the soy sauce in half as it was salty enough.

Excellent! The best thing about this recipe is that it easily adapts to whatever's in the pantry. I had some leftover chicken breasts, a 1/2 c. of sour cream, and the remains of a bag of salad croutons. To that, I added soy, lemon juice, and the seasonings that I like, including a big pinch of cayenne. Turned out great.

This was not only incredibly easy, but incredibly delicious.  The chicken turned out moist and flavorful.  I took the advice of others and cut the salt to soy sauce only, substituting celery seed and garlic powder for the salts. It was perfect.   Really enjoyed this dish.

This was very easy and tasty. The celery salt was a bit too strong for us. Will just lower that next time. I did leave the chicken in the sour cream mixture for 20 minutes before rolling in bread crumbs.

I have to agree...I found this a little too salty.  Recommend garlic powder instead of garlic salt and half the celery salt.  Aside from that, the chicken was very moist and tender!

Loved this! Was looking for a different way to bake chicken and this was it! Used the same seasonings, but without the salt. Even the 20 month old loved it!!!

Agree with some.  Way too much salt.  Tasty though. Instead of celery salt, celery seed, and garlic crystals or the real crushed garlic instead of garlic salt.  You can get low sodium stuffing mix as well.  WTG, pib, you were right on the money on this one.

This chicken was not good.......it was delicious!!!  It is so moist and juicy.  I used Stove Top stuffing and it turned out absolutely fantastic.  A lot better for you than fried chicken, but just as tasty!

Delish. The best chicken I've ever made. I didn't use celery salt and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Also, used fresh lemon juice.

Best baked chicken I ever made - maybe the best I have ever eaten. Didn't follow recipe exactly - never do :) but it got 5 stars for the idea. Used fresh garlic, lime juice, a splash of hot sauce along with the soy - and celery salt. You need some salt so why not flavored?. Marinaded chicken in the resulting goo for an hour or so. Used Pepperidge Farm corn bread stuffing crumbs since that was what I had on hand. Baked it on a rack over a cookie sheet for about an hour. Chicken was so crispy, tangy and juicy. Served it with mashed potatoes, stove top stuffing, green beans, cranberry sauce, gravy and biscuits. Rave reviews from the very hungry men I fed. A little bit of Thanksgiving in September! Really want to try something similar with pork tenderloin......
A definite keeper - so glad to find it! Thank you, thank you!

I have been making this recipe for a couple years now, and I have tried many different variations.  As other reviewers have stated, as is, the recipe has WAY too much salt for my taste, but can be easily modified with a couple of slight tweaks.  The one thing I found helpful for the texture/flavor is waiting til' the the last few minutes to add the butter.  Also, I find adding some diced onions to the stuffing mixture, and sprinkling/spraying a tiny bit of water on the coated breasts helps keep the inner part of the coating more chewy, and the chicken seems to stay more moist this way.  Cornbread stuffing mix is a great way to mix it up a bit!  I usually serve this with collard greens and mashed potatoes, and OF COURSE some cranberry sauce!! Overall, wonderful and very tasty recipe.  Always a crowd pleaser...we call this "Fake Thanksgiving." Thanks for posting!

Pretty darn good and easy to make b/c all the ingredients are staples in my household. The chicken is very moist and my husband is a very picky eater. He hates regular Stove Top Stuffing by itself, but he said it was wonderful in this dish. I followed the recipe to a T and it was great. If you are out of sour cream, you can also use plain yogurt for coating the chicken, I have made it both ways and it turns out excellent each time.

Amazing! You MUST use Stove-Top Herb Stuffing Mix, the others don't taste the same. The flavor from the Stove-Top Stuffing Mix is what makes the chicken so good!

I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and opted for a low-sodium soy sauce.  Chicken was moist and tangy.  I will make this again--but next time I won't make extra for leftovers because the flavor doesn't hold up the next day.

I love the taste of this chicken.  It's always moist and delicious.  I normally leave out the celery salt though just because I'm not a big fan and replace it was a cajun seasoning blend.

This was extremely good! I was pleasantly surprised. When I saw the mixture of soy sauce and lemon juice I was apprehensive, but I had all the ingredients, saw all of the good reviews and figured I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did! The only things I changed was I used celery seed instead of celery salt as I didn't have celery salt, and I used 1 tsp of garlic POWDER instead of 2 tsps of garlic SALT just because I had seen other reviews stating it was too salty and I'm not a huge garlic fan when it comes to it being really garlic'y. Oh, and I used bottled lemon juice. But This was awesome and I will definitely be adding it to the regular meals I make throughout the week. One last thing is that the 6 oz bag of Stove Top stuffing only got me through 6 chicken breasts, where the recipe calls for 8 and I therefore had a bit of the sour cream mixture left over.

very good! i followed recipe almost exactly, used garlic powder and jane's seasoned salt instead. but didn't change anything else, to me using anything besides the stuffing (cornflakes or potato chips) and sour cream (mayo) would change the whole recipe- will make again!

A nice alternative to the usual breaded chicken.  Very salty though...perhaps use NON-seasoned stuffing mix instead.  I will also cut the celery salt to 1/2 tsp next time.

Honestly, I could not believe how good this was~barring modifications made by a doubting southerner! I've never had baked breaded chicken so good before~
I used croutons instead of "stuffing", and when I ran out of those, I used potato chips-yum! It was all so good! But I also brined my chicken breast before hand(look it up if you don't know-I never serve poultry without a brine first) and then baked it on a foiled cookie sheet at 375 for 30 minutes, but it would have been good at 350 for 30. I also left out the celery salt, and used granulated garlic instead of salt. So good-thanks a lot!

We just finished eating this, I cut the celery salt in half and used 1 tsp garlic powder instead of the garlic salt. It was plenty salty. I used 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 butter and that was enough. I liked it my husband REALLY liked it. I will cut the sour cream mixture in half next time to save more calories.
FYI with using 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 butter the calorie count was 293 per serving of one chicken breast half.

It was a different and tasty recipe. I really don't have too much to rave about for except for the fact that it was good.

My husband absolutely LOVED this recipe.  I made this last week and I followed others suggestions and omitted the butter and sprayed with cooking spray and used light sour cream to bring the calories down a bit but even with those changes the flavor was amazing. I'm making it again tonight at his request. Thanks for sharing!

Made this recently and it was good. I'm not the best cook so I was happy it turned out well. The herb stuffing made a nice crispy crust and tasted nice too. I will make this again.

Tried this recipe last night. Let breasts sit in sour cream for a few mins as one reviewer suggested. I am still not sure exactly what I think. The breasts Were very moist and the sour cream definately gave it a distinct flavor. One reviewer suggested switching to lime juice next time. Think we'll try that...

I prepared this recipe as written with the exception of the sour cream.   When I opened my sour cream, it was bad even though the expiration date was 3 weeks away.   With no backup, I subbed in Apricot yogurt and that worked good with the lemon.  We really liked this except it had too much salt.   Next time I will sub in garlic powder for garlic salt.   If that is still too much, I will take out the celery salt and replace with celery seed.

This is really good! I didn't change anything.  I just used low sodium soy and garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I have a picky family of SEVEN and they ALL loved it and asked me to make it at least once a week.  Thank you for sharing!

this was a GREAT recipe... but HAD to be modified (i agree with other reviews about the salt issue). i completely omitted the celery salt. used bragg's liquid aminos instead of soy sauce (MUCH healthier) and used a a few dashes of the garlic salt. fat free sour cream is better, i think. and i used italian seasoned bread crumbs (easier). the butter isn't completely necessary- spraying with a mist of cooking spray will make it come out perfectly browned & just crispy enough. i loved the recipe and it was easy to modify for a diet that needs less salt and fat. thank you for sharing!

Thought it was a great dish... I halfed it all ( except for the butter by mistake) and yes it was toooooo much butter.... but I also used garlic powder and celery seeds to cut salt ... I had stove top turkey dressing on hand and cut a tiny hole in the top of the bag and hammered the heck out if it to make the chunks smaller.... ( no mess either) and snacking on chips while I made supper... this can also be used as a great chip dip.... ( or vegetable dip )

A very nice way to do chicken! very moist.  I didn't add celery salt or garlic salt, but added minced garlic and few extra herbs.  got great reviews from the family, and everyone thought it was a nice change.

Used 4 large breasts and kept the sour cream mixture  whole anyway.  Used nonfat Greek yogurt in place of sour cream, lime in place of lemon juice, garlic powder in place of garlic salt, and no celery salt.  Also used panko crumbs in place of stuffing mix.  Cooked these a little longer, as they were large breast halves, but one hour would have been great, as they were somewhat dry (my fault for over cooking, I think).  DH liked them and they had a great aroma when cooking and a great flavor.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good. I pretty well followed the recepie as written. I made this twice. The last time i cooked it in my convection oven with the chicken slightly raised on a wire rack to keep the bottom from being soggy and this was a big improvement - the crunch was much better.

The 15 minutes Prep Time is misleading.  It took that much time to crush the cubed stuffing into crumbs.
I also agree that it was way too salty.

instead of stuffing, I crumbed some fresh italian white bread and as the oven was warming i put some herbs and a little butter on the crumbs and browned as oven came to temp. I also dropped the word salt and used garlic granuales and celery seeds.  I also pounded the fresh chicken.  I usually brine my frozen chicken breasts in water and garlic and sea salt to thaw. In that case I would drop the garlic in the recipe.  All else was the same. It was tender and flavorful. This recipe Is promoted to my regular rotation.  The herbs on the bread crumbs were garlic granuales, dried parsley, salt, pepper and a couple of other things that don't remember.

I agree with other reviewers about the salt.  Way too much.  I cut the Celery and Garlic Salts down to 1 tsp each and it still tasted pretty salty.  Next time will try with Celery seed and Garlic powder.  The stuffing mix should have plenty of salt to season the meat.  It was very good otherwise.

i wasn't expecting this to taste as good as it did.  It is a keeper!!!! i opt out of using the stuffing and used the italian bread crums instead as another had suggested and wow it was AWESOME!!!  i didnt use as much butter as they said either, it really doesn't need but a little butter.

Awesome recipe!  I used celery seed instead of celery salt- next time I will cut that in half as it was a little overpowering with the celery seed already in the herb stuffing mix.  I did marinate the chicken for 30 minutes in the sauce prior to rolling in the stuffing crumbs; it made the chicken very tender and juicy.  50 minutes was just right for the thick chicken breasts I used.  Thanks for sharing!

Way too much salt. I don't use salt at all in my cooking, regardless. I'd use the same seasonings without salt. If people need salt, I serve it at the table. My family are so used to my style of cooking they do not miss it at all, but comment on store bought prepared foods as being too salty.

This is a fantastic recipe! Instead of using stuffing mix, I've been using breadcrumbs seasoned with parsley, sage, and thyme.  The last time I used boneless skinless thighs, and actually made real stuffing out of bread cubes, not for breading but to stuff the chicken with.  It's a little extra work but I think it's worth it! My boyfriend did comment on how salty the dish is, I think next time I will just use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  But at any rate, this is a keeper, thanks for a great recipe!

This is a nice twist on classic breaded/baked chicken. My husband & 2 year old loved it. Maybe it's just my oven, but 40 minutes would be too long for this to bake uncovered, so I covered it for 30 minutes, then removed the cover for the last 10 minutes of baking. This left it crunchy/chewy but not burned.The flavor is really good and it's easy (but messy!) to make. it's a good comfort-food staple and will go into my weeknight rotation.

This was really good! Instead of using the stuffing mix, I made it gluten-free by using G-F cornbread I made a couple days before and sliced and dried in my oven, then crumbled. I didn't have celery salt, but used 1/2 tsp celery seed. And I used chicken leg/thigh combos because that's what I had. The result was so tender, and the tangy sourcream under the slightly sweet cornbread was super! I will definitely make this again...soon!

I had chicken last night and wanted to bake it ,but wanted a different take on it.  I searched "baked chicken" and came up with this recipe.  I'd never thought of using sour cream as coating, but it worked well.  I only had celery seed and garlic powder, but it still tasted good.  So easy to make that I'd use this recipe again.   I might add a little more soy sauce next time, and try adding different spices to the sour cream for different taste.  Also, when you say to "split breasts" I wasn't thinking butterfly and just cut the chicken down the middle LOL, cooked it 40 minutes and it was very moist.  Had leftover piece for lunch today!

It was great with a few alterations.  Way too much salt, so I used granulated garlic and left out the celery salt.  I crushed the stuffing mix into bread crumb size pieces, this allowed it to stay on the chicken very well.  Will make it again.

I wanted something for dinner that was healthy and not completely bland. This was an excellent dish. I didn't drizzle butter over it. I just coated my dish (similar to baking) and it fan-freaking-tastic. Definitely use fresh lemons and any other fresh ingredients you can get ahold of. As we say in Puerto Rico...."Buen Provecho."

Delicious!  Used fresh lime juice and plain breadcrumbs because I didn't have stuffing mix and it was still very tasty.  I also used cooking spray instead of melted butter.  I was looking for a recipe to bake boneless skinless chicken breasts that would keep them tender and this is definately it!!
Can't wait to make again and share with family!

Wow, this is BY FAR the best breaded chicken recipe I have found yet!  I did, although, use regular garlic powder instead of garlic salt, personal preference.  I soaked the chicken for about an hour before breading and used Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing, definitely the way to go, just crushed it tad so it had a great crispy crust.  Will make this again and again!  It's a keeper!

This chicken was great! The only thing I changed was the garlic salt, I used garlic powder.  I was afraid that the chicken would be too salty if I used the garlic salt.  Great Recipe, Thanks!

I have made this recipe twice now and it is very good - I do not make any changes to it as it is delicious on its on.We love sour cream in our house and it gives the chicken a very moist coating of flavor on the outside.

I have never posted on here before but after eating this dish tonight, I just had to!  My boyfriend and I LOVED it!!!  I axed the celery salt and only put in 1 teaspoon of garlic salt...although next time I might ax that too.  I used Stove Top Homestyle Herb for the stuffing.  And baked for 40 min.  I highly recommend this one!

This was good.  I used garlic powder as was suggested by others.  I think the time is for bone-in breasts-this is what Iused & 50 min. was just right.  This will be a fun recipe to experiment with different types of coating.

In an effort to reduce sodium and make this a bit healthier here is what I did.  I used low fat sour cream, lime juice only because I didn't have a lemon, low sodium soy sauce, no celery salt (just more sodium), garlic powder not salt and about 1 tbls. unsalted butter mixed with some olive oil for drizzling and it was still yummmy.  I love recipes that stand up to healthier ingredients and hold their own - you know the original recipe must be killer.

Wonderful!!!  I did follow the suggestions of many about cutting back on the salt and I'm glad I did.  It would definitely have been too salty if I had not.  I cut both the celery salt and the garlic salt back to 1 teaspoon each.  Also, I'm not a fan of the flavor of stuffing mixes, so I used crushed cornflakes.  I cut the chicken breasts more like nuggets so we could enjoy more crust around each bite.  My entire family loved it!

Easy ways to cut down the salt:  -Use cornflake/mrs. dash combo instead of stuffing mix  -Low sodium soy sauce  -Bottled garlic (instead of celery salt & garlic salt)  Still tastes awesome!

My family loved this, I followed previous suggestions and  used celery seed and garlic powder to cut down on salt . I  also cut the soy sauce by 1/2 and used low salt soy sauce. I let it sit in sauce for a couple hours before breading and cooking .   Very tasty

This was just okay, which surprised me because it calls for a lot of my favorite ingredients.  It does make for very juicy, tender chicken!  I didn't think it was too salty, but the flavor wasn't anything special.  Thanks for sharing the recipe though!

I made this last night for dinner and I was surprised at how good it was because the ingredients are kind of different.  First off I cut the recipe in half because it is just my husband and me.  I had my chicken marinating for about 4 hours because I originally planned to make something different then changed my mind, but I think this helped keep it moist.  I used lower sodium chicken flavored stuffing and low sodium soy, garlic POWDER and clery seed.  We didn't think it was too salty this way.  Will make again.

Super! This was so easy to make and turned out great. I wanted to try something different while still using some of what I already had in the house and found this. I thought the sour cream with chicken would be cool to try. The coating was very good. I used italian bread crumbs instead of the stuffing and it was very good. I baked it about 45 minutes and it was perfect. It was really juicy and tender. My boyfriend said it was some of the best chicken he ever had. I didn't have celery salt but added sea salt in its place and it was fine. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this last night for dinner and it was a hit.  I realized later that I forgot to pour butter on them, but they still turned out delicious.  I used celery seed and garlic powder instead of the salt after reading other reviews.  I will definitely make this again.

Great flavor and texture. Chicken stayed very moist.  The lemon and sour cream give it a nice tang. My hubby thought the ingredients sounded strange, but he ate two pieces!!  Kids also liked it, which is a bonus!  Thanks for the good "staple" recipe. Made this again using pheasant that hubby had hunted. It kept the bird really moist-pheasant is very lean-and tasted good. He took the rest to work and shared, it got rave reviews there too!

My boyfriend LOVED this!!!! However, I did change some of the ingredients based on what I read from others. I changed the celery amount to a dash, 1 tsp of garlic salt, tsp of pepper, and added 1 cup of ricotta cheese.*NOTE*You will have left over sauce.  The other ingredients I kept the same.  Also, if meat is thawed, 30 minutes is enough time to cook.

This was a great alternative to boring chicken breast. The flavors were great and left a nice aftertaste as well. My husband loved it immensely. Thanks.

Very Flavorful!! I also cut back on the salts - cut my chicken in 1 1/2 - 2 inch strips - marinated for a few hours. I can't say it was crunchy - hhmmmm - wonder what I didn't do?? It was still very good and plan to try Ritz next time. Thanks!!

If you minimize the salt a ton then this would be a yummy recipe. I only put a tsp of the salts and it was still pretty salty. Maybe just put in garlic powder rather than garlic salt.

Very good.  I took others advise, used celery seed, fresh garlic and Stove Top Chicken crushed. Let chicken set in sour cream mixture for about 3 hours.  Served with Brussel sprouts and a Romaine Red pear & pecan salad.  Yum!

This was probably the best baked chicken I've had in years!! I just made this and "The Mad Hatter Salad" for a cookout yesterday. EVERYONE wanted both recipes and there were no leftovers!! I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and switched up the garlic salt for garlic powder. I also substituted the butter for Smart Balance and used low sodium soy sauce. I will be making this again and again and again!!

This is really great, moist chicken- after 30 minutes.  40-50 mins cooking time seems much too long to me.  You can also make it healthier by using reduced fat or fat free sour cream, and I used "Smart Balance" in place of butter and only drizzled about 1 T over each breast.  I also agree with many other reviewers about the amount of sodium... use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and celery seed instead of celery salt, as the crushed stuffing mix is quite salty in itself.  With the changes, it was really fantastic.  Thanks for the submission

Even when adding less salt than recommended, it was still too salty for us.  The sour cream did make the chicken moist.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

My husband requests this at least once every couple of weeks.  He is not normally a sour cream lover, but he can't get enough of it in this recipe! I always modify for sodium, I like using celery powder and garlic powder instead of the "salts."  This recipe goes great with a classic spinach salad.

this was a big hit at our house. my husband doesn't care for chicken and he said it would be great if i made this recipe once a week. i didn't really measure things it was just a guestamate and i added garlic juice and minced garlic. soaked the chicken in the sour cream mix. rolled the chicken in the crumbs and poured the rest on top for added crunchies. baked it only 40 minutes and it was so juicy and full of flavor. takes no time at all to put together.

This chicken was so yummy!  I made a couple changes after reading some reviews..  I used 2T lemon juice, 2tsp soy sauce, 1tsp garlic powder, and I left out the celery salt...This way was perfect, not too salty and just enough seasoning.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was amazing. I did not use the garlic salt or celery salt but stuck with the unsalted seasonings as mentioned by other reviewers.  I also had no lemon juice but it turned out great without it.  The chicken was so moist and crispy and both my kids gobbled it up. Served it with boullion rice and corn on the cob.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I did make a few changes that lowered the sodium content.  I did not use either celery salt or garlic salt - I substituted a non-salt poultry season.  Also, I let the chicken sit in the sour cream mixture for several hours.  Finally, instead of stuffing mix I crushed garlic flavored croutons.  I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe!  Tasty and simple to prepare...good in a pinch since the ingredients are usually on hand.  I made four servings instead of eight and did substitute 1/2 tsp garlic powder for the garlic salt.  My husband and toddler son also enjoyed this dish.  It's a keeper!

This really is the best! I always keep some frozen chicken breast on hand for an easy weekday meal. And my boyfriend's eyes always light up when I tell him I'm making this. It's simple and delicious. Dipping it in the stuffing is superb. So much better than most baked chicken recipes that simply have you use bread crumbs. I follow the recipe exactly (except I don't have celery salt, so I just use onion powder). I always make extra so I have leftovers for lunch throughout the week. It reheats very well without getting soggy. I highly reccomend this. Goes great with rice, carrots, corn, or any vegetable sides.

Even my picky 3 and 5-year-old love this chicken. Quick, flavorful, and juicy. I have made it several times and I always use seasoned bread crumbs because that is what I have in the pantry. I also use granulated garlic instead of garlic salt because I find celery salt to be enough for this.

I almost made this - I made a few changes in my dish. I used reduced fat sour cream, a couple splashes of low sodium soy sauce, and a few shakes of the celery and onion salts. I didn't have any lemon juice, so omitted that. I think this one might have been the biggest change, because in reading other reviews it seems as though this should have been more liquid - mine was the consistency of the sour cream.
 I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs to coat the chicken after the sour cream mix, then sprinkled the rest of the crumbs left in the bowl over the whole dish in the pan. I forgot about the butter, so omitted that as well, lol. I had 4 half chicken breasts in the pan, which were a comfortably snug fit, and it took the full cooking time. If the breasts were thinner, it might have taken less.  This chicken was moist on the inside and had a nice crunch on the outside - delicious! I will be using this recipe again! (One caveat - my daughter and I loved it, my husband thought it was ok. I will be cooking again when he isn't the only one I want to impress!)

This was pretty good. I used chicken breast instead and followed other reviews and cut the butter in half, doubled the curry, added minced garlic, and used tinfoil the first 30 min of baking. Made with rice and broccoli and used the leftover sauce to cover the rice. Will make again.

I was looking for something to do with the chicken breast I had thawed that wouldn't require a trip to the store. Ran across this and after reading A LOT of the reviews, gave it a try. Really didn't have to make any drastic changes and it was fantastic! I do try to watch my salt intake so subbed garlic powder for the garlic salt, used low-sodium soy sauce,  and then just added a fat pinch of seasoned salt  in place of the celery salt (didn't have any). Other than that I followed the recipe to a "T". Several reviewers suggested marinating it in the sauce for a bit, which I did - just threw the chicken in a big Ziploc bag with the sauce mixture & left it in the fridge for about 30 minutes before breading it. It does sound like a weird combo in the sauce but  really, just go with it! Baked it on a rack over a sheet pan and it came out delightfully crunchy and the chicken stayed moist. I did really crush the stuffing mix well - big cubes of stuffing would probably not be too appetizing. Already been asked when I'm going to make it again, and it won't be long, that's for sure!

This was the best chicken dish ever! I made it as directed and it did not taste too salty at all. The seasonings were perfect.  I used chicken stove top, and crushed it up before rolling on the chicken.

Very good!  Wonderful taste and everyone liked it - which is rare.  I pounded my chicken breasts so they were all the same consistency and would cook evenly.  I cooked them for 40 minutes but could have taken them out 5 min sooner.

Only cooked 30 minutes and they were overdone. I guess it depends on the size chicken breast you use. They didn't have much flavor. I won't be making this again.

Nice flavor mixture, the sour cream really makes it.  Easy prep..10 min at most.  I didn't have the stuffing mixture so I used Panko bread crumbs and added poultry seasoning to them.

Simple, easy recipe. A new favorite in our house! I sub the celery salt and garlic salt with garlic powder and fresh minced celery. Also, I've crushed croutons when I didn't have bread crumbs. I serve with slower cooker mashed potatoes and veggies...Delicious every time!

Super yummy!! I made this tonight for the first time and it was great, the only thing I change was cutting the garlic salt and feel d y salt in half.  I made the mixture by the recipe exactly first and it was way too salty.  But I will definitely be making this again!

I give it 3 stars, because we had to replace celery salt with pickle salt, which was a great idea, and we used crushed snack crackers instead of stuffing  mix, which was another great idea, my only regret  is that we only made enough for one serving.

This has become our family's favourite meal.  If there is one way I can ensure my adult kids come home for dinner, it's to serve this dish.  I serve it with a white BBQ sauce.  Perfect & so easy!  The only thing I do different is to use ground corn flakes for the coating.

The flavor was okay, and the recipe's cooking instructions are way off making the chicken tough and chewy and way over cooked. This is keeping in mind that I had huge pieces of chicken and a normal sized piece would have probably become so tough that a knife wouldn't have gone through it.

Delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as is (except for using light sour cream.  I did put the stuffing in the food processor because the chunks were pretty big and I figured they wouldn't stick.  The chicken was juicy and tender and the crust had just enough crisp to it.  It was kind of like Thanksgiving turkey and stuffing in one bite, but way better!!

I wish I had read the reviews prior to making this.  It was definitely too salty.  I would absolutely cut the salt in half next time.  Flavorful but way too much salt.

This recipe is a keeper! It was very tasty and moist inside. I didn't have stuffing mix so I just mixed some Italian bread crumbs and panko together. I will definitely be making this again. The only thing I think I'll do different next time is maybe use less garlic salt or maybe use garlic powder instead because it was a little bit on the salty side. Other then that it was delish!

I've made this twice now (because what doesn't deserve a second chance, right?) and it still came out just ok.  Not super moist and just... kinda blah.  No modifications.  Think I'll stick with my chick parmesan recipe.

This has become my favorite chicken recipe.  As others have suggested, I substituted garlic powder for garlic salt.  Quick and easy prep.

For those of you that found it too salty, use garlic powder and celery seed instead of the garlic and celery salt.  I however did not find this good enough to make again.  There are ever so many versions of breading chicken in stuffing mix I was hoping the sour cream would make it a bit wetter but it didn't.

This is a family favorite and a dish that I rarely have leftovers from. I don't have celery salt so I changed the recipe a bit. I also leave out the butter in attempts to be a bit healthier. Cut down the 2 tsp garlic salt to 1 tsp and add 1 tsp of onion powder. I also leave out the lemon when I am serving it and give each piece an additional squirt when I plate it. Oh and the one thing that adds a lot of flavor is using cornbread stuffing instead of regular.

Delish with a few changes! Used 6 chicken breasts- 3/4 cup light s.c., garlic powder instead of salt, and 3 tbsp butter drizzled at the end, cooked for 30 minutes, broiled last 5

This was so good!  Although I did a couple of things different;  I did not have lemon juice so I just left that out and I didn't have celery salt so I used 1 tsp of celery seed.

Didn't change a thing. Served as part of Christmas dinner buffet and 4 Grandsons told their Mom she HAD to get the recipe.  It is just as delicious cold.

This recipe is a huge hit in our family. I have now made it many times and everyone always asks me for the recipe. The flavor and consistancy is awesome. It has a great flavor and I always make sure I have some leftover for lunch the next day. I wish it would stay crunchy once you reheat it :(

I followed the recipe exactly except for the celery salt (because I did not have any on hand) but it still came out GREAT!!!  My husband loved it and my kids liked it too.  The combination in the batter makes the chicken moist and tangy and I love stuffing!!  I will be making this meal again soon.

Wonderful flavor, very moist, whole family loved it.   Even better it was easy and clean to make, no fuss, no mess and used all practical ingredients which I had on hand.  This is going to become a new recipe for when company comes.

It was tasty, but definitely did not need a half cup of butter, plus it was too salty - i will use celery seed and garlic clove or garlic powder next time.

I fixed this for some really picky eaters, They LOVED it. Said it was the best chicken they have ever ate. It takes such a small amount of time to fix. It is very reasonably priced to cook. Fills you up. Taste is out of this world.

This recipe is amazing! The only modification is a little more lemon juice and instead of Garlic salt, we do Garlic powder. My husband loves this. This was even his birthday dinner request which speaks very highly of what he thinks of this recipe. Thanks for sharing! I love looking like a rockstar in the kitchen because of other's recipes. The chicken is so good. we side with cranberry sauce, asparagus with Parmesan, and sweet potatoes.

Delicious! Very flavorful and juicy. Sodium wasn't an issue. I substituted the garlic salt with garlic powder. I didn't have any herb seasoned crumbs so i used Goya Bread crumbs (latin flavor) It was delicious!!

I used whatever I had and tweeked the recipe. I used seasoned croutons, processed to crumbs, chicken tenders, Mexican sour cream, and 1 cup of Panko bread crumbs. I didn't have celery or garlic salt so I used garlic powder. I usually don't like to rate on a tweek but there was one thing I would change is the butter. It was too much and made it too soggy. If I make this next time, less butter or none at all. Other than the butter and the tweeking, it was pretty good.

Per hubby and sons, recipe turned out great Emily. Followed recipe as stated exept I added 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the sour cream mixture, didn't have bread crumbs, so used about 2 cups of crushed corn flakes. Baked in my ceramic dish per temp and time in convection oven. My family likes recipes on the spicy side so will try adding cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes next time to give it a little zing.  Thanks!

Delicious! I will definitely be using this recipe again!! After reading some other reviews, I also used celery seed instead of celery salt and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I think it came out just perfect that way. I also cooked it a little less than the recipe says, about 35 minutes I believe, and it was the perfect combination of crunchy on the outside and sooo juicy on the inside. I think it's the sour cream that gives it a subtle but really awesome tangy-ness. Thanks so much for sharing this!

I loved this dish, but I also incorporated a lot of the changes suggested in other reviews.  I cut the butter a third, and it was still plenty, used celery seed instead of celery salt, low sodium soy sauce, and garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Even with these changes there was more than enough salt, so next time I likely will use unsalted butter.  I also lime instead of lemon, but lemon would be great as well  The chicken was exceptionally tender and the meal well-received.  Another plus is that it is easy to modify.

I loved this chicken.  It had so much flavor, and the texture was perfect.  I think next time, however, I will flatten the chicken breasts a little.  Mine were too thick.  I didn't have soy sauce, but the flavor was still excellent.

Fabulous. the chicken was crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. I made the full recipe of sour cream mixture but only used 4 chicken breasts and used nearly all the mixture. I think I would double the mixture if I used 8 breasts. Used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I used boneless chicken breasts and they baked perfectly in 40 minutes.

Well my tongue is all shriveled up from the massive amount of SALT in this recipe.  I should have known better and changed the amount.  But I like to give the recipe maker the benefit of the doubt make the recipes as listed and also because I find it soooo annoying that people rate/review with a novel of the changes they made!!!!  But even reducing the salt wouldn't make this a keeper because of the high fat content w/ the sour cream and butter. ...just not good enough to justify.

Not enough flavor! Why all the salt and soy?
Would not make it again.

it is true, it is delicious, but WAY too much salt. next time, will use garlic powder, low sodium soy sauce, and maybe no celery salt.

Everyone loved this! Like most here, I did make a few minor adjustments. I'm wondering if all of the salt was a typo. I skipped the celery and garlic salt and used 1 tsp of garlic powder instead and added 1 tsp of lime juice.  I cut the breasts up into tenders (so they would cook quicker) and omitted the butter, aside from coating the pan. It's a keeper and going into our supper rotation!  I think I will try this sometime without the crunchy coating too.--- I just realized that I doubled the amount of chicken and sour cream but not the rest of the ingredients!!  It was still wonderful (and now I know why I had enough to freeze for next time but ran out of crumbs!)  :-)  I'll try to pay more attention next time!

Changed a few ingredients - used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, celery seed, garlic powder and crushed rosemary crackers. That being said I loved it. My family was ok but said next time mom do the butter (I used Pam spray). Great recipe, thanks!!

Amazingly moist and delicious! I did not have sour cream so I substituted smooth ranch dip. Every bite was so tender. We will definately make this again. Thanks!

I would definitely make this again, though I changed the breadcrumbs for pork rind crumbs-diabetic. I would bake it on a rack so the bottom gets crispy.

Very yummy. I definitely felt like I was stretching the bread crumbs, there were definitely some bald spots . I think next time I will go into a second box of stuffing . Lots of people here say that using the stove top brand is a must, but I used Aldi brand and it was very good (and I actually do use Stove top brand when I am actually preparing stuffing). I too subbed the garlic and celery salts for garlic powder and celery seed , and I used lite sour cream and low sodium soy sauce - still tasted great, and I think the extra salt would have detracted from the dish. I also did not put butter on the breasts, instead I sprayed the chicken with butter flavored Pam. I'm sure the butter would have been delicious, I just wanted to cut some calories where I could . Next time I think I will go a little heavier with the seasonings though, esp the garlic and soy sauce, other than that- it was great! Thanks for a great new recipe to put in the dinner rotation!

the chicken was very savory, but i had to alternate the temperature as the stuffing was cooking way too quickly and the chicken was still pink. i lowered the heat to cook it slower. i also added diced onions and lea and perrins to the sour cream mix,along with some garlic seasoning. at the end i added a drop of cream and some water to moisten the dish. overall very savory but not the greatest discovery.

This is a week night dinner keeper. Everyone asked for seconds. It was very tender.  Made the following changes:  Used 3 tsp crushed garlic instead of garlic salt, celery flakes in place of celery salt, low fat sour cream and Stove Top cornbread stuffing mix.  Nice flavor blends :-)

This recipe went over very well with my family of 8 and it gets 5 stars for ease of preparation. I used Pepperidge Farms stuffing mix rather than StoveTop-don't know if that makes much of a difference but it was awesome!  Thanks for a keeper recipe!

Very good and very easy.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt because I just don't buy garlic salt.  I did everything else as written and it was not too salty in my opinion.  I did use leftover bagged stuffing from Thanksgiving.  The 'boxed' stuffing can be salty so if I ever use that I might cut back on the salt.    The hubby said this was a keeper and I agree.

I made this exactly as the recipe was listed, and it was good, but will definitely tweak it next time to make it better.  The sour cream mixture that you dip the chicken into gives it a really nice tangy flavor, and I was surprised how well it all combined together.  BUT it was WAY TOO SALTY!  Next time I will use garlic powder instead of garlic salt, maybe a low sodium soy sauce, and possibly a low-salt stuffing mix if such a thing exists.  This isn't even because I want to lower my sodium intake, just because it was really much too salty to taste.  But a good recipe nonetheless.  It really surprised me.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. Based on the reviews, I did cut back a little on the salt. I used Garlic powder instead of Garlic salt, and used a little less Celery salt than what it suggested. After realizing I had all the ingredients on hand, I figured I would try it. I was pleasantly surprised. I don't feel like I could really taste the mixture of the sour cream and seasonings, but the chicken with the stuffing was great! Thanks!

I thought this was a pretty good recipe, and its the best luck I've ever had with breading meat.  I thought the chicken cooked up very tender and juicy. However, my finacee said he prefered shake and bake, and since that requires less ingredients, I'll prob. stick with that in the future. But then again, he's not doing the cooking, I am! Might be something I would make for company, as it's a bit fancier than his shake and bake.

This was good, but I made some changes.  First, I used yogurt instead of sour cream.  Second, I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of crushed stuffing mix.  I think the coating would turn out better with the crushed stuffing because it would be courser.

This certainly is the best baked chicken recipe!  Ignore other comments that complain that this recipe is too salty- if you are salt-sensitive use a lower-sodium soy sauce and be discriminatory about what seasoning you include in the sause.   I like to use a touch of red-wine vinager in the sause, it adds an interesting flavor.

This turned out great. I did use celery seed & garlic powder, as well as fat free sour cream. Actually, the celery seed adds a very nice flavor.

I left out the celery salt completely and didn't miss it. The chicken was good, although I had to cook it almost an hour for it to be done. After reading some other reviews, I'm concerned about the salt content and will definitely try substitutes in the future.

Really good! I didn't have any celery salt, so I left it out. I used garlic powder and just a little bit of garlic salt. I used the coating on about a pound of boneless breast cut into tenders. There wasn't enough chicken to use all of the coating, so I dumped the leftover crumbs on top. I used much less butter than called for. We'll def. have this again, but only for an occasional dinner treat. Too unhealthy (and addictive!) to make regularly.

Not a fan at all..... the original recipes has too much salt and it is almost impossible to cut out the salt and make it taste good.  Just finished eating this chicken and i think for dessert I will have a nice yummy salad. Thanks for an intresting recipe.

I followed other reviewers' advice and cut out the celery salt and garlic salt. I made only one chicken breast and "guestimated" the proportions of the seasonings but it came out really good!  Instead of the salts I used a sprinkle of Mrs. Dash's garlic and herb seasoning. Strange sounding combination but it really is delicious!! Very simple, easy to modify, and great for a college student's budget!

I WAS LOOKING FOR A QUICK RECIPE AND FOUND THAT I HAD MOST OF THE INGREDIENTS FOR THIS ONE.  I THREW THIS TOGETHER IN 5 MINUTES.  I HAD TO OMIT THE LEMON JUICE AND CELERY SALT (DIDN'T HAVE), AND ADDED ABOUT 1/3 CAN OF CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP (IT WAS GOING IN THE TRASH OTHERWISE).  I USED A COMBO OF ITALIAN BREAD CRUMBS AND THE STUFFING CRUMBS. THIS TURNED OUT REALLY GOOD.  THE CHICKEN WAS MOIST, THE BREAD CRUMBS WERE CRUNCHY, AND EVEN MY 2 YEAR (WHO NEVER EATS MEAT) ATE SOME!  WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN, ADDS A DIFFERENT TOUCH TO "OVEN BAKED CHICKEN".

This was an quick, easy recipe that tasted pretty good. Since other reviewers said it was too salty, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and omitted the celery salt. I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts, which reduced the baking time to about 30 min. The garlic taste was too strong for my liking, but my husband liked it. I served it with whole wheat couscous cooked in chicken broth.

This was so good, my picky husband loved it. I cut my breasts in half and pounded them flat to even out and lessen the cooking time. Then I soaked the chicken in the mixture for about an hour. For the mix, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and celery salt. I didn't have stuffing, so I mixed a packet of shake and bake, Italian bread crumbs, and Parmesan cheese. I drizzled the butter on top, but I think I used too much butter because it wasn't crunchy when it was done. So, then I broiled it for a few minutes, and that seemed to help.  Next time I'll use less. None the less, this chicken was awesome!  I served it with white rice and veggies. Next time I'll serve it with buttered pasta.

This was too sour. Next time I will omit the lemon juice. Also, it wasn't crunchy at all, the outer layer was mushy.

I give this recipe a 5 star because of its potential.  I think next time I'll eliminate the celery salt and garlic salt (and use minced garlic as others have recommended) as the salt content was overpowering.  My kids and husband devoured it.

I made this for Christmas dinner for those that don't eat ham. THEY ALL LOVED IT!!! Even went back to the fridge to pull out the leftovers and ate them cold. I had a bunch of people to cook for so I just doubled the sourcream and then marinated the chicken in the sourcream mixture for 4 hours before baking. That helped cut back the saltiness. I will make this one again for sure.

i thought this was quite easy & as others said i used minced garlic instead of garlic salt. Unfortunately i did not have the "mix" so instead i used bread crumbs, onion flakes,chives, parsley flakes, basil& celery seed.  my picky son loved the chicken & my daughter gobbled it up (have yet to hear what my hubby thinks since he is not home). personally, i thought it as a bit rich so next time i think i will try half sour cream & half yogurt.

We really liked this recipe but it was really salty. I think I will take the advice of others and use garlic powder instead of garlic salt next time. Or maybe halve the amount of celery salt or something. Very good, though, and I will make again.

This was so good!  I didn't have soy sauce so I used Worcestershire sauce instead, and used Italian bread crumbs instead of stuffing.  Like others suggested, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and we didn't find that it was overly salty. I used a whole cut-up chicken and removed all of the skin and fat before cooking and it came out great! My husband is extremely picky so when I said I was going to bake chicken he was very skeptical, but he loved it.  Our only complaint was that the breading was not as crispy as we would have liked.  I put the oven on broil for the last 10 minutes and that helped a little but the chicken was almost done so I hated to dry it out.  Next time I will switch to broil a little earlier and hopefully get a crispier finish.  Great recipe!

I can't find sour cream where I live so I use plain sour cream instead.  As others have noted it can be a bit salty so I also omit the garlic salt and use crushed garlic. Delicious and tender!

This was a very good dish. I used less celery and garlic salt than called for though. Two teaspoons of each seemed like too much. I used about one of each. The chicken turned out very moist and tender.

Definitely a keeper!  Everyone said it was delicious.  Nice crunchy coating and moist chicken.   As other reviews suggested I cut back on the salt and used garlic powder instead of salt.  I also used "garlic butter" to drizzle on top... as Rachael Ray would say... Yum-O!

This was really tasty!  I loved the crunchy coating.  I didn't have lemon, so I used lime.  I used freshly crushed garlic instead of garlic salt.  Other than that, I think I kept the recipe exactly how it was.  My husband loved it.  I will definitely make it again!  Thanks!

Delicious!  Crunchy yet moist breading with plenty of flavor! Just don't forget to drizzle melted butter over the chicken before baking; makes such a difference! My boyfriend's favorite.

Very good.  My entire family, including 3 very picky children enjoyed this.  It was a touch to salty for me so I may cut back a little next time or just use Ritz crackers instead of the stuffing mix.  A nice different twist on a regular baked chicken.

Great recipe. Missing ingredients caused some changes. No soy sauce? Try worchester sauce instead. Also subbed Jane's crazy salt for celery salt and garlic powder for the garlic salt. Chicken was moist and delicious. Used the remainder of large package of dressing mix and added chicken broth, celery and sweet onions as a side dish. Definately a keeper for my recipe collection. Thanks for sharing.

Ok so I review this before (and loved it, by the way), but I just thought I'd add in what I did to make a healthier version. I threw chopped almonds into the food processor and then mixed them with whole wheat flour to use instead of the bread crumbs. Used low fat sour cream vs. the regular. The rest is all the same with the exception of drizzling olive oil over the chicken instead of butter. Still turns out great and still a staple in our house!

This was fantastic! I left out the celery salt and used bone-in skinless breasts. Baked at 400 for 50 minutes, the chicken was crispy and flavorful, very juicy. Most baked chicken recipes turn out bland and chewy. Will definitely put this into the dinner rotation. Thanks!

This is very good... If you are scared by the salt comments as I was, just use less salt....garlic powder instead of garlic salt, low sodium stuffing or soy sauce. Mine wasn't too salty with these alterations.

This is the best, Fantastic! I read all reviews and decided I had to try it. I didn't have any celery salt either! The ingredients sounded somewhat strange but WOW, THIS IS A KEEPER! I'm not the greatest cook and I messed up at first and it still turned out FANTASTIC!

This was a very tastey chicken dish. The fact that it was so easy to make will keep it in the loop in my household. For those who don't have a lot of kitchen skills this is a recipe right down your alley, it will boost your confidence.

This was delicious.  I added fresh basil and parsley to the sour cream mix and used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  Wow, tender and crunchy at the same time!  Awesome flavor.

Good heavens, this is good! I had to make some adjustments being that I didn't have any stuffing mix, celery salt or soy sauce - so I did what I do most of the time, and I improvised. I used the rest of my container of Old English breadcrumbs with 1/2 cup grape nuts thrown in there for crunch, and used seasoning salt too. The chicken is amazingly tender and moist, and the sour cream gives it an excellent flavor. Very impressed, I'll be making this again. Thanks for sharing, Emily!

I served this to some friends for dinner and they raved about it.  It's very juicy on the inside and has an interesting crunchy (not fried tasting) palate on the outside.  My chicken breasts were very large, however, and I only had enough sour cream coating for 7 of the breasts - but like I said, they were huge!  I got the chicken breasts at Sam's.  Very impressed with how moist the chicken was.

After reading reviews I changed the celery salt to celery seed, and the garlic salt to garlic powder. Turned out great. I let the chicken sit awhile in the sour cream mixture, and used as much of it as possible. Sprinkle and coat as much extra stuffing as possible. My hubby loved it.

This was good but I made modifications.  My husband and I agree that as listed it would be WAY to salty.  I used crushed garlic rather than garlic salt and left out the celery salt.  Other than that I left it as is and it was very good.

I made some substitutions in this recipe because I didn't have all the ingredients available but I wasn't impressed. It didn't cook in the stated time and it was bland and not at all crispy.

I can't believe how easy and delicious this is! The chicken came out tender on the inside, crispy on the outside. I omitted the soy sauce and replaced the garlic salt with garlic powder -- seemed to work out well, although next time I will keep the garlic salt because the chicken could've used a bit more savoriness.
