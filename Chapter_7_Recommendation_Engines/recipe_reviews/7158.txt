I made these as muffins, omitting the orange zest and nutmeg, as I wanted a pure, strawberry-banana flavor. I also left 1/2 cup of the strawberries chunky, which added some texture and color. Yum! my husband's staff  loved them too...all gone by 10:00!

It's taken a long time to find a really good muffin mix.  This one made 26 medium muffins with good size caps.  I just chopped the bananas and strawberries to give some great texture.  I left out nutmeg, orange zest and nuts as a personal preference, and added a splash of vanilla extract.  It took about 32 minutes at 350!  YUM YUM YUM

This is a great recipe! To get more of the strawberry flavor that other reviewers said they couldn't taste, I put the strawberries in sliced instead of mashed. I did let the beaters whip them around a bit but the berries were still chuncky. My family thinks that it is great. I am making this a permanent resident in my recipie box.

Great bread. As another reviewer suggested I added a 1 1/2 cups banana I had frozen. Also, I didn't have any oranges so I  added 1/2 tsp lemon extract and 1 tsp vanilla extract. I also used 3/4 c. unsweetened strawberry apple sauce and 1/4 c. veg oil instead of 1 c. veg oil and used a little less salt. Also, I used fesh strawberries and half chopped half mashed them so there were chunks of strawberry in it. Highly recommended, came out great!

This one is a keeper. I ommited the nutmeg (wanted more of a strawberry flavor)and used lemon instead of orange zest. Total I used 1 pound strawberries and 2 bananas. I mashed one cup of the strawberries and then chopped up the rest (rolled them in flour ... and they didnt sink!). This is really really good. Moist, kinda like a poundcake. Will make again. I'm using this in a fruit trifle.

We loved this recipe!  Left out the orange zest, but added 1 tsp vanilla & thought the flavor was terrific.  Made 1 loaf & 12 regular sized muffins - muffin cook time was 30 min.

WOW!!!  I was surprised with this one.  I had some bananas and strawberries I had frozen (for a long time).  I thawed them out to use and wondered if it would taste ok.  Well... we loved them.  I made muffins and cooked for 30 mins.  This recipe goes in my make again.

I LOVED THIS BREAD.  BUT I PUT A TWIST TO IT.  I DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH STRAWBERRIES SO I ADDED A FEW PEACHES TO THE BREAD, AND I DID NOT ADD ANY NUTS IN IT.  IT TURNED OUT GREAT, EVERYONE LOVED IT!

I was a little skeptical about making this bread/ for me, a bundt cake. As I was mixing all the ingredients, I was really nervous. It didnt look....well....good. But I wanted to stay positive and just roll with it. I had a lot of strawberries and bananas and boy was I bored. So I decided, lets go ahead and make something we have never made before. 

And I am glad I did. The only things I did differently was I didnt use nutmeg, no nuts, and and instead of 2 cups of sugar I used a little less. I also added a little pure vanilla extract.

The only thing I would do differently is I would NOT mash the strawberries. You can still kind of see them and taste them, but it would of been nicer if the pieces were a little bit bigger. 

Would I ever make this again? OH yeah! I had it for breakfast this morning and had a slice last night....fresh out of the oven. 

It was refreshing, light and not over powering. Im a fan. I wonder what it would be like with blueberries and strawberries? I guess I will find out the next time I am in bake mode lol.

Happy eating! XOXO

Oh my goodness these things are so yummy. I made one loaf, a bunch of "normal" sized muffins and a bunch of mini muffins. My 18 month old daughter just ate three of those! I used yogurt AND oil (half and half) and only used half the eggs it called for. (Plain Lowfat Yogurt is a great substitute for eggs and oil!) I used my food chopper on the strawberries so there were little chunks and I mashed the banana with a fork so there were big chunks of that as well. DELISH!!! And like others, I just needed to use up my strawberries and bananas! Great recipe!

I was going to make banana bread but I also had strawberries that needed using up, so did an ingredient search and came up with this. I put 3 bananas and the strawberries with the orange zest in the blender. I used half white amd half brown sugar, didn't have any walnuts but I did have a quarter of a bag of flaked almonds so put them in as well. The loaves looked beautiful. Took one into work today and when I went for my lunch break there was only one piece left. Many thanks.

I don't understand what happened!  The inside of this bread turned out to be a sponge like consistency and the outside is crispy! I don't even know if my hubby that will eat ANYTHING, will even take more than one bite! I am very disappointed that I wasted my time and the money to try this recipe!  I will go back to my standard of the banana bread with sour cream recipe!  That one is a winner

This bread was good but I am not sure if it was great. I am still trying to decide if I like it! The flavors are really complex---strawberries, bananas, spice, orange zest. I used my sugar coated pecans instead of walnuts (I still have alot of those left, LOL). I guess the flavor that stands out most to me is the strawberries. And I am still undecided if I like warm strawberries...thanks for letting me try something different and helping me get rid of my over-ripe bananas, strawberries and those darned sugar coated pecan pieces!!! I am taking to school tomorrow and leaving in the workroom and I am sure it will get eaten! (: (: (:

Perfect as written, moist flavorful with pleasant strawberry surprise inside every bite.  I only have one loaf pan (gasp!), so I baked it in a bundt for the same amout of time.  Turned out beautifully!

I thought this bread was really good.  I used a teaspoon of strawberry extract left out the orange zest and nutmeg.  I only used the nuts in one of the loafs, and found that in the one without, you could really taste the strawberry flavor more.  The one with the nuts just tasted like banana nut bread.  I also sprinkled a cinnamon sugar mix on the top of the loafs.

This was very moist, as opposed to the other strawberry bread recipe on site. Used the suggestions to omit orange zest and added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Divided the white sugar with brown. Definitely glad I added another 1/2 cup of strawberries, not too mashed. Delicious!

I have made this recipe several times and just love it.  It's a great use for those bananas my husband and I just don't get around to eating on cereal, and the strawberries really give it a nice texture.  My only recommendation is to reserve some diced strawberries and banana from the mix and fold them in before baking.  The little chunks are visually appealing and add a better texture.  Bon apetit!

This bread came out of the oven a little to dark but I think that is my oven's fault.  Regardless the bread was moist and the crust not too hard.  My husband thinks the orange peel is too strong, but I disagree.  I think it is the best banana bread I have ever made.

So good! A hit with the whole family. I used 1 c applesauce in place of eggs because hubby is allergic. I omitted the orange zest because I didn't have any and left out walnuts on personal preference. For those of you that are unsure about the cinnamon and nutmeg in this: Just do it! It's fabulous!

This bread was very moist. It was almost like a cake. I loved it and the kids loved it too. I don't know if the strawberries were necassary or not because I couldn't really taste them in the bread. The bananas overpowered the strawberries so the recipe might work without them.

I made a loaf and 12 muffins with this recipe. I happened to only have 1/2 cup vegetable oil left, so I used 1/2 cup coconut milk that I happened to need to use up anyhow. I also omitted the walnuts (and by that I mean I forgot to add them and didn't really care), and I used half whole wheat flour. It turned out really well, especially the muffins. I really like the "strawberriness" of the bread, my strawberries were pretty ripe, I think that helped.

I cut the sugar down to a cup, used half FF plain yogurt in place of some of the oil called for in this recipe. I did mash the of the strawberries with the bananas, I also added about 3/4 cup of sliced strawberries for added texture. I also added a little vanilla flavoring. My kids really liked this. I think the chunks of strawberries were a good call.

Gotta say I am a little disappointed in this recipe. The strawberry flavor is nearly undetectable. Perhaps banana is just too overpowering for the berries.

Great recipe. We went strawberry picking and I needed some way to get rid of all of them. This was perfect. Very moist flavorful bread that I made into little heart shaped muffins, and  shared with some of my friends. I added about 3/4C more strawberries that I just cut into pieces instead of mashing. I also forgot the walnuts, and by the time I remembered them I had already eaten a muffin, and didn't want to change it because it was so good. :)

This made great muffins.  One-half recipe made 12 muffins baked at 325 convect for 22 minutes.  I used pureed fresh strawberries (no chunks).  Sprinkled tops with Turbinado sugar.  Excellent strawberry banana flavor!  UPDATE:  After making several times I've decided that these don't rise nearly enough...they're pretty flat.  I now make the joyofbaking.com version which has baking soda and baking powder and they rise beautifully.  You may want to consider adjusting leavening in AR's recipe.

I divided the recipe in half, and pureed the strawberries and banana in a blender. I also used vanilla instead of the orange zest. The bread turned out great. Wrapped it in foil and let it sit in the fridge overnite, and it was even better. Moist and the flavor, yummmm. Three people at work asked me for the recipe.

Tasty but not a strong strawberry or banana flavour due to the zest I think. Regardless, deliciously moist and flavourful. Changes I made: did half whole wheat half unbleached white flour, half brown sugar half white, half oil half plain non-fat yogurt, lemon zest instead of orange, frozen strawberries rather than fresh (all I had onhand) and pecans because that's all I had. Lovely but next time will up the strawberry alot and omit the zest alltogether.

Wow!  These are yummy.  I doubled the batch, because I had a lot of strawberries to use up.  It made two loaves and 24 muffins.  I substituted applesauce for half the oil, and used half white, half brown sugar.  I omitted the nuts (personal preference) and substituted lemon zest for the orange.  I used a bit more strawberries than called for and didn't mash them, the mixer did the work.  I also added about a half a cup of homemade strawberry jam after reading the reviews that there wasn't enough strawberry flavor.  There is now!  My kids are plowing through the muffins as I type this.  I keep hearing:  "OH MY GOSH, MOM!!!  These are delicious!!"

This was my first attempt at making bread of any sort. It was easy and it turned out great. I did read the reviews and I left the bananas and strawberries chopped, I didn't mash them. Really glad I didn't.

Delicious! I used this recipe to make muffins and bread and both were great, flavorful and moist. I did substitute lemon zest as I didn't have an orange, and slivered almonts for the walnuts. Brought to work and everyone loved and my husband finished off so quickly as well!

The bread was very moist.  I left out the orange zest and nuts.  The taste of the strawberries and bananas blended well, and stood out, making the bread so full of flavor and not  at all bland.

I made this following the recipe as written but cut up the strawberries and bananas into small pieces and made muffins instead of the bread. I baked them at 350 for 32 minutes. Made 19 muffins. They were outstanding! I highly recommend!

I made the following minor changes: used only 3/4 of the sugar, used white whole wheat flour instead of the all-purpose flour, omitted walnuts, and made muffins instead of bread. The muffins came out great! Next time I probably reduce the sugar to only half the amount.

This one seemed to have too many dominant flavors.  Maybe with some brown sugar and butter and omitting the zest would be better.

Very good.  I did omit the orange zest and added a bit of vanilla.  I also coursly chopped fresh strawberries and bananas rather than mashing them for better texture.  Made 22 muffins at 32 minutes.

This is an average tasting banana bread, nothing special.  You cannot taste the strawberries at all.  If I make it again I'll add some vanilla and use brown sugar instead of white.

I love anything that has layers of different flavors, each coming through on their own while complimenting the others.  This is a great recipe that does just that!  I threw 3 bananas, strawberries, and a peel of 1 small orange into the food processor and blended it all together.  Added the eggs, and 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup oil in as well and blended it all all.  The only addition was 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  When I got the bread together, I thought it didn't taste very sweet....well that is because I didn't add the sugar so had to add it at the end and it still came out beautifully!  Because I had about 1 1/2 cup of bananas it made more batter.  Had 1 8 in and 1 9 inch loaf, as well as a small mini loaf (so I could taste and rate)  Gave the other 2 away and got compliments.  I found the zest and spices added wonderful layers of flavor.  Didn't have nuts so omitted.  Great recipe!

I used my food processor to chop the strawberries, rather than mashing. Same for the bananas. Quite the timesaver! After reading the comments about the walnuts and orange zest overwhelming the strawberries, I tried it both with and without. Took it to a get together and everyone really enjoyed, but voted in favor of the nuts and orange zest!

Wow!! I just made this bread and it is awesome. The flavor was soooo good with the strawberries that I don't think I will ever make plain banana bread again. I substituted 1/2 of the flour for whole wheat flour. YUM YUM Delicious!! My kids love it too!!

Wonderful!! I usually make muffins out of this recipe and do a few things differently: I omit orange zest, use 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup of brown, up the cinnamon to 2 tsp.'s (just because I love it), and chop up the strawberries because my daughter doesn't like the chunks.  The muffins freeze really well also. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this recipe for several brunches.  And when I bring it into the office everyone goes wild!  It has been a great hit everytime I have made it. Its just a little something diffrent than regular banna nut bread.

I thought this was very good. I made 1 small loaf and 12 muffins.  I sliced the berries thick and let the beaters mash them in the batter.  I topped the loaf and each muffin with sliced strawberries to make them look pretty.  Delish!

Very, very moist and delicious!  I agree that the strawberries get overshadowed by the bananas even though I put them in chunky.  They may add a bit of moisture to it as I can tell there are pockets of strawberries that are moist but without the strawberry taste.  A big hit with everybody in my household!

I didn't have enough white sugar so I used Raw sugar I popped it into the food processor for a smoother texture, I also didn't have cinnamon so instead of using 3 cups of flour I again used the food processor and used two cinnamon and spice oatmeal packets (equal to 1/2 cup) and cut back to 2.5 cups of flour.  I didn't use zest either, It turned out AMAZING!!! try it, you'll never do it any other way!!

This was a fantastic bread. I LOVED it. I also have to say that it is very forgiving as well. I accidentally used the wrong measuring cup 2/3 rather then 1/2 6 times over and when I realized it was already to late. I threw in some extra banana's and strawberries and it turned out amazing. I did mash some strawberries as well as cut them into pieces and thought it was much better then if I had mashed them all.

We subbed honey for the sugar and used chopped frozen strawberries.  Which, along with being a little generous with the bananas and strawberries, could be why it took longer to cook.  It really filled our loaf pan up almost to the top; considered splitting it into two pans, but left it in one.  Ended up being a little overdone on the corners and quite moist in the middle, but really good flavor. We like it just fine. Maybe next time we'll try muffins with this recipe.

Delicious! They were moist and tasted very fruity but not oversweet which was surprising with the amount of sugar. I did leave out the orange zest and walnuts and added 1tsp vanilla extract. I also only used a dash of nutmeg and 2 dashes of cinnamon since I did not want to mask the fruit flavors at all. I made one loaf and the rest muffins....amazing!

Not too bad. I ended up diceing the strawberries. If I had put them in the blender it probably would have had a stronger strawberry taste.  I only had one loaf pan so I used a bundt pan instead. Baked up just fine.

Pretty good!  A couple of changes:  Only used bananas as I had plenty of overripe ones.  Used less sugar - just 1 1/2 cups and it was sweet enough for me.  Instead of 1 cup vegetable oil, used  just 1/2 cup oil plus 8 oz. unsweetened applesauce.  I had sliced almonds, not walnuts on hand, so I sprinkled those on top.  Good stuff!

This was very easy to make. I used less sugar than the recipe called for. I used a bit less than  3/4 cup white sugar and about the same amount brown sugar. I also only used 1/2 cup oil and used 1/2 cup 100% apple juice. I didn't use the orange zest or the nutmeg. This is very tasty; I've already had three pieces :-) It's not overly sweet since I cut out some of the sugar, but I thought it was really good. I'd definitely make again! thanks!!

This recipe was a pleasant surprise. I was looking for a way to use up strawberries and bananas and came upon this recipe. I made 6 giant muffins and baked them for 30 min. I left out the orange zest, nutmeg and walnuts. I used 2 bananas and about a pint of strawberries and only 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. The strawberry banana flavor is subtle and they are a beautiful shade of pink.

I made this today and we just had some after dinner. I have my cousin's 4 year old today along with my two girls and all 3 of them at a muffin and asked for another. I made a loaf and a few muffins out of the recipe because I didn't read the entire thing before I realized it was for 2 loafs. The only thing I did different was I used extra bananas and strawberry's and didn't use any orange zest or walnuts. I cooked it for the amount of time called for and put a tooth pick in and came out clean but when I cut the loaf open the bottom looks uncooked, but I think it's because most of the strawberry's sunk to the bottom.

I halved the recipe to make one loaf. It made a nice, dense bread in about 45-50 minutes. The strawberry flavor wasn't as strong as expected but still a nice flavor overall.

My son made this as bread and muffins. Everything was great! He subbed wheat flour for the white, which made for a more dense bread. He omitted the nuts and the nutmeg, using more fruit instead for flavor. This is going to be a family favorite!

This turned out really great and it was quick to prepare! I added toasted slivered almonds to the top of the batter prior to popping it into the oven and it tasted wonderful. Very moist. A great way to use up strawberries (now that they're in season here in Southern California) and bananas (on their way out). I made 1/2 the recipe and added 1 teaspoon of real vanilla extract. A real winner. Maybe next time I'll add chocolate chips.

Maybe it was me but I don't really think so. Adding strawberries could have been too much, this recipe lacked flavor and the standard "banana bread" texture.***UPDATE**The last time I used too much fruit.  I tried it again following the recipe to the letter and it was much better. I added a star.

I'm giving this a 5 based on smell and ease of preparation. I just took it out of the oven and it's too hot to taste. I think next time I will use applesauce in the place of the oil because that's alot of oil. Also I suggest watching the baking process closely because it was cooked after 45 mins.

Cut the recipe in half and used it to make muffins. Made 12 muffins. To prepare muffins, mixed ingredients by hand so not to over mix, left the strawberry and banana mixture a little chunky when mashing, filled muffin liners 3/4 full, and baked for 25 minutes. Made a wonderful muffin with a nice crispy top and great flavor with small chunks of strawberry and banana throughout. Also left out the orange zest, since I didn't have any in the house and many other reviewers commented on the orange flavor being overpowering. Thought it was the perfect mixture of strawberry and banana flavor without it.

Really yummy!!!! Very easy to make. I didn't measure my strawberries bc I know I didn't have enough.. so mine isnt overly strawberry tasting, but still good. I added a little bit of squeezed orange juice from the orange and added about a half teaspoon of orange extract. I also did half whole wheat flour and added 1 motts strawberry applesauce cup (lessened the oil by that much).  Added a few white choc chips to some of them and yumm-o !!   Bake them 25 mins or so to make them muffins!

Yummy recipe!  These are the changes that I made: I didn't have orange zest, so added a tsp. of vanilla instead and I also did 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  I agree with some other reviews that neither the strawberry or banana flavors are very strong, but it still made a super moist and delicious bread.  Thanks!

yummy!  This was delish although I have to say that I did change it up a bit based on my own thoughts as well as other reviews.  I replaced the oil with one stick of butter. I also omitted the orange zest, added a couple splashes of vanilla, and did one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown.  I had read a couple reviews that said the bread was a bit dry so I decided to add a 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Once the batter was in the pans I also sprinkled it with cinnamon and sugar so it would have a sweet crunchy top.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this twice now, loved it each time! I did leave the fruit a little chunky so the flavors were more obvious. Delicious bread!

Good solid recipe.  Bread was nice and moist.  I probably should have left the strawberries chuncky to get more strawberry flavor.  I left out the orange zest and added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.  Also, the recipe yields a lot of batter.

This was GREAT!  I did NOT mash the strawberries and I left out the orange zest and nuts.  It's a great twist on regular banana bread.

Made this last night and had some for breakfast this morning.  It was very tasty and moist.  

I had only one banana so I halved the recipe to use 1/2 C mashed banana.  The only other change was to reduce the sugar to 3/4 C for the one loaf.  The banana flavor dominated the strawberry flavor, so I will only use this as a variation on banana bread, but we still liked the bread very much and I will make it again.

I was very disappointed in this bread.  The flavors were not very strong & it was too sweet.  I mostly tasted the orange peel rather than bananas or strawberries.  It was very moist, though.

This was awesome!   It made a lot: I made 2 loaves and 6 muffins from this recipe.  I made a few changes to make it healthy though.  1. sub two cups of flour for whole wheat 2. replaced the white sugar with 1 1/4 cups of packed brown sugar and 1/4 cup of honey 3. added a tsbp of wheat germ and flax seed 4. used applesauce instead of oil.  These came out great.  I absolutely love the combination of orange zest and fruit in this recipe.  Thanks a lot, and I'll make these ones regularly from now on.

Great!  I did modify a bit, omitted nutmeg and zest, cut down on the cinn and half white/half brown sugar.
Very moist, my guests ate it up!
I will make this again soon.

I'm giving my own muffin version five stars in addition to giving the basic bread recipe the same.  What a yummy recipe!  Here are my changes: Flax seed and appropriate amounts of water substituted for the eggs (my son is allergic), half brown sugar and half white, half whole wheat flour and half white, vanilla instead of orange zest.  These were really, really good.  I couldn't believe how well they turned out--so moist.

I really liked this bread. I think the strawberries made it sweeter than the average banana bread which was great.  We ate it alone and with coffee and both ways were great.

I was torn between giving this a 3 or 4 star rating.  This bread is very moist and baked up beautifully in the time stated, the spices are just right, and it stores well.  Good way to use up the two fruits I typically have on hand and may have small amounts left over from other cooking endeavors.  The disappointment was I found this bread had neither the distinct flavor of banana or stawberry; they were more like background notes, but what I could  easily discern was the orange. Ultimately I decided if a similar situation presented itself again I would probably bake this again but to serve to family only.

This bread was OK at best.  I did as most other people did, using applesauce in place of oil, or adding less sugar than called for, etc etc.....But you can do that with many recipes and it bakes/cooks as though you followed the recipe exactly.  Well, not with this one....It came out kind of rubbery and very dense.  And after a while of cooling on a rack, it began to get wet on top which made it chewy and soggy.  OH- And you cant taste the strawberries at all.  My advice, follow recipe exactly and instead of mashing berries, cut them into small chunks so you have something to taste.

I made these this a.m. and my husband, children and grandchildren LOVED them.  I omitted the zest and nuts as I felt they would overpower the taste of the strawberries, and used suggestion of 1/2 regular sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I made muffins (half standard size and half mini)as the kids love the bite size muffins.  I also mashed 3/4 of the strawberries and cut up remainder for chunkiness. Thanks for a new way to use ripe bananas.

I liked this bread. It was not as sweet regular banana bread and the subtle strawberry flavor enhanced the bread. I will definitely try it again. I made it in "mini" loaves as I was going to be giving it for Easter gifts.

My 15 year old brother can't get enough of this bread.  Every time my husband and I stay with him I have to make him at least 4 loaves so that he can freeze some and have enough to last a few weeks.  He won't share with the rest of the family either!  This is the first recipe I've ever made with such an effect on him.

I cut the recipe in half, and perhaps used too many bananas, but this just didn't turn out great for me. It's really dense spongey, not quite the texture of a bread like I would expect.

Based on other's reviews, I used scant cups of white and brown sugar and vanilla and baked in a bundt pan.  This was a very moist and flavorful bread, and was a big hit at work.  Will definitely make again.

My family loves banana bread but I don't care for regular banana bread, so I decided to give this recipe a try. Absolutely Scrumptious! A definite keeper. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  Next time, though, I’ll reduce the eggs and add more banana.  Thanks for sharing!

Awesome recipe and great suggestions!  Don't change a thing unless you like to add the chunks of strawberries and banana, but I would add additional.  The strawberries and bananas mix up very well for the base flavor and the hint of cinnamon and nutmeg is perfect.  I made  these for a local friends farm stand and they were a hit - I was so sick of making chocolate chip banana bread!  Thanks for sharing!

Followed the recipe with the suggestions from other reviewers.  I used metal pans and the cook time was around 50 minutes.  This bread has a nice light consistency for having 4 eggs.  I was almost expecting something a little more cake-like.  I used the King Arthur Flour brand Bread Flour.  I am finding it works best for all my baking needs.  Also, i made the strawberry butter one of the other reviewers mentions.  Yummy!

This is delicious! As several others have mentioned, I left out the nutmeg, nuts, and orange zest, but added vanilla. I also subbed unsweetened applesauce for about 1/3 if the oil. I was afraid mashed strawberries might make for an unattractive gray-pink shade to the bread (past experience), so I chopped the strawberries and mixed that in. I baked the batter in a bundt pan for the time listed and it came out perfect! After the bread/cake cooled, I drizzled on a simple glaze (powdered sugar/water/vanilla) just for presentation. This is definitely a keeper!

Pretty good. Could use more strawberry flavor - is there an extract? I ended up toasting 1/2" slices about half-way through the finished bread, a la biscotti.  Was better toasted.  Will probably make again.

My family and I loved this bread. My only note is that if you are going to leave out the orange zest and nutmeg, bring out the fruity flavors instead! There is nothing wrong with an extra slice of strawberry or another chunk of banana Only lightly mash the bananas and slice the strawberries,though because if you do not, your bread will be blander than if you put chunks of the fruit everywhere.

It's ok. Good concept. Probably would have more moisture & better crumb if made w butter. It was dry. Next time I'll use my usually recipe and add strawberries. Made a loaf + 15 muffins

Made 12 servings (1 loaf in 9x5 glass pan). Substituted 1/2c applesauce instead of 1/2c oil. No nutmeg or orange zest, added 1/2tsp vanilla extract instead. Increased bananas to 3/4c, strawberries to 3/4c. Strawberries were half mashed, half sliced chunks. Baked 350° for 55 minutes. Turned out delicious and soft, like bread pudding. Big fan.

Very good & easy. I diced the berries instead of mashing the 2nd time I made it to add a little more texture. Also instead of a 2nd loaf I pored the batter in muffin tins to appease 2 teenagers who are too lazy to slice the bread. That gave them a quick, not unhealthy breakfast on the way out the door for school. I'll make this again anytime I find myself with some overripe bananas.

My girlfriend and I tried this recipe on a Saturday night. We followed the directions as best we could. It's kind of difficult to figure out how many strawberries it takes to get to 1.5 cups. LOL! We divided it into 3 loaves. The bread had my apartment smelling "yummy." The bread itself was moist and flavorful. Can't wait to eat some more for Sunday breakfast!

Yes, I followed the suggestion of cupcakes, almost. Using only 1/2 C oil, I mixed in the chunky fruit last- to keep it visible. Also, I added chopped pecans. This generous recipe made 12 cupcakes & 7 mini loaves. They rose to the occasion beautifully. This made me a HAPPY MamaPat.
PS-The mini loaves did take about 10 min. longer: very pretty.

Aside from using batter for muffins, I made no changes.  They froze well and were a tasty treat at our yearly camping trip.

Delicious, forgiving bread!  I ran low on white sugar and flour, and subbed powdered sugar - and it still turned out fine.  I added some (appx 1/3 c) greek yoghurt, a tsp of vanilla, and sliced the strawberries instead of mashing. Baked for just around an hour.  It turned out moist and tasty.  Almost more like cake.  Make again!  Maybe add crumbly topping.  Would make great muffins!

Strawberries made the bread a little soggy after the first day or so.  This is a bread that needs to be eaten quickly!

This recipe was a hit at my husband's office!  I took a pound of strawberries, mashed half of it and diced the other half.  I then folded the diced strawberries into the batter before pouring into the pans.  The only other change I made was leaving out the orange zest.  I did use the nutmeg and I'm glad I did because it smelled wonderful!

Thanks for all of the tips, I added more mashed strawberries and bananas, omitted the orange zest, cut the veg oil in half, used 1 c whole wheat flour, 2c all-purpose flour, and used chocolate chips instead of chopped walnuts.  Makes great breakfast muffins!!

Moist and fruity. I did sub applesauce for oil, as I do in most baked goods. Recipe was enough to make 12 mini muffins, 9 large muffins and 1 smaller loaf.

I made a few changes to this recipe when I made it. First, I did not have an orange so I used lemon zest instead. Also, I didn't think cinnamon and nutmeg would go well with strawberries so I left those out as well. Everything else I kept the same and I really couldn't taste the strawberries at all. It really just tasted like banana bread to me. If I make it again, maybe I'll use less banana and a little more strawberry instead.

This bread was very good. I didnt have very much strawberries so I used more banana. I didnt use nutmeg or orange zest because I dont care for the taste. I used a little bit of orange juice concentrate instead. My kids like it too!

It was really good.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, replaced the oil with applesauce, and put 2 tbs ground flaxseed in it and left out one of the egg yolks and it was really good, really moist.

I had a bunch of strawberries and bananas left over from making a fruit salad the other day and wanted to find a new recipe to try and found this one. I'm pretty new to making breads so I wasn't sure how it would turn out. It was very easy and it turned out great!

I made some adjustments to this based on what I had and liked.  I didn't mash the strawberries, just sliced them.  Left out the orange zest and nutmeg.  Substitued pecans for walnuts.  Made one loaf and 16 muffins which as more than enough.  Tasty and scrumptious when eaten right out of the oven.

Awesome! These were a big hit with the whole family! The only thing I omitted was the walnuts. I will definitely be making these again. Next time I will try substituting half the oil with applesauce.

This is pretty good.... My bf just bought a juicer attachment for my KitchenAid. He made fresh squeezed orange juice with it this morning. I thought strawberry-banana bread would be the perfect complement (think  strawberry-banana orange juice, but in a "homey," warm and spicy bread... yummy!). I was a bit disappointed (with the bread, that is...). To compensate for the dry texture some reviewer's experienced, I subbed low-fat strawberry-banana yogurt for the oil called for (also to add flavor - or so I thought...). I baked one loaf (halved the recipe) and found that it took much longer than an hour to fully bake, more like 1 hour PLUS 15-20 minutes. After 45 minutes, I covered my loaf with aluminum foil to keep it from browning further (it was just right at that point, so I'm glad I checked). I think my Pampered Chef stoneware loaf pan caused the bottom of my bread to brown more than I'd like.... Overall OK, but the flavors were not dominant enough for me to make again. I even thought the orange zest would give this a nice flavor (apparently too strong as per many reviews - not IMHO), but I barely noticed it. I REALLY noticed the spices and would have noticed the vanilla had I thought to add some. I'll have to see if the flavors improve in a day or two (I REALLY hope they do). Thanks anyways!

I'm a little disappointed. I cut the spices and orange peel and added vanilla, as some suggested. The flavors are nice, but overall a little bland. An hour was definitely too much time for the loaf (I'm trying 20 min. for the muffins right now) but the crust is still really really chewy. Maybe I should have stuck to the original recipe.

Oh, this bread is absolutely heavenly! I promise you'll never switch back to the ordinary banana bread after trying this! I love how I can use cooking oil (instead of butter) since I hate melting butter and also canola oil is a healthier substitute. The consistency is perfect -- very fruity, not buttery, not overly sweet. I used all whole wheat flour and substitute white sugar with brown and it still turns out perfectly. (However, I had made this with white flour and sugar before, and the bonus is, the bread will be in a very cute shade of pink from the strawberries!) Next time I'll experiment with other fruit combinations... maybe banana+mango and strawberry+kiwi!

This bread was more dry than I would have preferred.  Also, the strawberry taste was very, very subtle, even though I followed advice and left larger chunks.  I don't plan to make it again.

I'm going to give this recipe four stars, although right after it came out of the oven i would have voted higher. I made the recipe exactly as written besides adding a splash of vanilla extract out of habit. As the flavors mellowed together over night I found that the orange zest became too pronounced. I would suggest either cutting by half or omitting it all together. It is a bit overpowering. When I first tasted it I actually got hints of the strawberry, bananas and orange zest and it was fantastic but not so true the next day. Love the difference in the bread but will not add the orange zest next time. I baked mine in a 9 by 13 inch cake pan and it came out perfect. Will definitely keep though, so that tells you something!! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great alternative to the standard bananna bread. The strawberries add just enough of a different flavor to make it soo yummy.

This recipe is a favorite! My husband asks me to make it all the time! The only thing I don't add is the orange zest. I also like it better with chopped strawberries! It keeps the strong flavor and texture of the berries. Thanks so much for this recipe.

This receipe is awesome!  We made many loaves - small, large, star.  They turned out great - the only thing we changed was not using the nuts.  I froze some and have given some to family.  Thanks for a great receipe!

The bread was just ok.  It was moist and had good texture but I wasn't a big fan of the flavor combination.  I felt like both the strawberry and banana were lost to each other and the rest of the ingredients.

Good recipe and a nice change from plain banana bread.  With that said, I prefer a plain banana bread to this.  I didn't mash the berries to mush, I left some texture to them by not using a mixer but mixing it by hand.

Pretty good! I halved the recipe and I made 6 muffins and a 9"9" loaf. I used fresh strawberries (about 1 cup) and chopped them up, also used sliced almonds instead of walnuts as well as a dash of vanilla extract. Should be good tomorrow for breakfast!

Turned out great!  I followed the recipe exactly except for cutting back on the sugar and my family really enjoyed it.  I make banana break frequently but happened to have some strawberries to use up this week.  The flavor of the strawberries is very subtle but a nice change of pace from what we normally have.

I used several people's suggestions and chopped the strawberries into small chunks, but I didnt think there was much flavor in this. I would rather not waste the money on strawberries and just make regular banana bread.

Many complained that you can't taste the strawberries.  If you are looking for that zippy berry flavor, you can do what I did.  I only had 3/4 cup of the strawberries (half of what you need), so I mashed them and then scrambled around looking for a substitute.  I ended up using 3/4 cup of mashed rasberry/marionberry mix. (It was a frozen berry mix that I had in my freezer.  I defrosted them.)  WOWWEE!!!!  It was delicious!  You could definitely taste the berries' presence, but it was still sweet. MMMMMM!

moist bread, but mine was a bit tough and rubbery.  Maybe it is my baking....but everyone really liked it and the house smelled so good!  Thank you for giving me a way to use the extra strawberries I had on hand.

This was wonderful bread!  A Huge Hit.  I was invited to a friend's house today and I whipped this up in just a few minutes and everyone loved it.  Very moist.  My son said it was the best banana bread he had ever eaten.  A definite repeat!

This was a good banana bread, but you couldn't really taste the strawberries.  If I made this again, I would put the berries in the food processor and then add more coarsely chopped berries.

this was a great variation to my normal banana bread recipe. with 3 sisters, 1 brother, and both my parents always asking me to make something sweet-and healthy-i put in a few of my own ingredients for a healthier option: instead of using 3 cups of all-purpose flour, i used 3 cups of whole wheat flour (which has more iron and fiber). i read some of the other reviews before hand and decided to omit the walnuts so as not to cover up the strawberries flavor. i actually had a hard time smashing them, so i diced the strawberries and bananas instead. i didn't have to worry about chunks so much because the mixer took care of that! i couldn't wait to taste - it smelled sooo good - so, i cooled only 1 loaf for 10 min., and my family loves it!

This bread is perfect for anyone wanting some banana bread with an added touch and one that is not too overly sweet.  I usually like mine sweeter but all my neighbours loved it and wanted the recipe so I will give it a four star rating.  I would make it again, if not for me then for a neighbour.  Personally for myself I would serve it sliced on a dessert dish with some strawberry preserves trickled over the top to add a bit of sweetness.

I didn't taste the strawberries at all, even though I sliced them like someone suggested. I put in half cup less sugar and it still came out too sweet.
