My mom introduced me to this salad last summer and I loved it! She adds one extra ingredient that I think makes it even better, so I thought I'd share! She takes 3 or 4 peeled cloves of garlic and cuts them in half. Then sticks a half to each end of 3 or 4 toothpicks and sets them in the dish with the salad. Let it set in the fridge overnight and you will have an extra flavor splash. Just pick out the toothpicks with the garlic on them and discard before serving.

When I noticed the 3:1 ratio of olive oil to vinegar I knew already that I would like this, if only for the dressing.  I used olive oil rather than vegetable oil, and while the dressing was simple and delicious I usually like my salads more lightly dressed, and there was just too much of it for my tastes - easy enough, however, to fix.  Rather than layering then tossing the ingredients, I just simply mixed them up from the get-go and it was fine.  Simply delicious as is, but I added boccancini (llittle, fresh mozzarella balls) to mine for a more Caprese-style salad. Add what you like, chopped bell peppers, garlic, olives, cucumber, but this is excellent just as is in its simplicity.

This was very good. I added cucumber and feta cheese and used extra basil. You can never have too much fresh basil.

Simply delicious!  I tripled this recipe for company and it was a crowd pleaser!  I used olive oil instead of the vegetable oil and also added 2 minced cloves of garlic.  The freshness of the basil along with the garlic reminded me of bruschetta.  How can you go wrong with that?

What a wonderful dinner I just made with this salad as the main dish.  This is so easy and perfect for summer.  I bought some really tasty home-grown tomatoes and cucumbers at a local market.  The only changes I made to the recipe was I used olive oil, two tomatoes and one cucumber.  I served this with cheese toast.

Really a wonderful salad. I cheated a bit and used store bought Italian dressing. I also roasted some slivered almonds and added them along with some raisins (which I stole out of my roommate's raisin bran cereal :D) into the salad. I think that gave a very nice touch. Served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it!

Very easy salad to toss together and something different on the table.  Basil wasn't ready in the garden yet, so I used fresh parsley.  Loved it.

Excellent salad! I used light olive oil instead of vegetable oil, added 1/2 cup feta cheese and used cilantro instead of basil.

Definitely a 5!  Used EVOO for health sake and made as submitted.  Next time will try a clove of garlic minced in the liquid.  Finally...a great non-typical garbanzo recipe!!!

Very good and fresh tasting. I thought the dressing was good but needed a bit more 'kick'. I added a minced clove of garlic and that added the flavor that I thought was missing. I'll use this recipe frequently over the summer. I might do as others did and add a bit of feta, or even some Kalamata olives next time.

I made it exactly as written except I didn't have any fresh basil so I used dried.  It was very good.  Can't wait to try it with fresh.  Both my mom and boyfriend loved it.  It's a keeper!

I found this a refreshing salad.  Good as is, but with the leftovers I did add some celery, shredded carrot and made more of the dressing.  With the chickpeas this could be a nice main dish salad.

This is awesome and really easy! I only put two Tbsp of oil in and used dried basil since I didn't have any fresh and it was still amazing. My husband, who is not usually fond of bean salads, said, "you should definitely save this one." Yep, saved and will be a go to from now on.

I chose this recipe because I was looking for something filling and low cal. The only change I made was add a cuke (to add volume). My husband, who doesn't normally eat this kind of food, loved it. The garbanzo beans really add a lot to the salad. Next time, I will cut the oil in half and add 1 more tablespoon of vinegar and keep the cuke too. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Great recipe.  We have also made it with balsamic vinegar and extra fresh basil that is torn not minced.  Either way it is YUMMY!

Thought this was a wonderful change from the ordinary salad!  I added feta cheese and used cherry tomatoes cut in halves and olive oil instead of the tomatoes slices and vegetable oil.  Very healthy and flavorful!
