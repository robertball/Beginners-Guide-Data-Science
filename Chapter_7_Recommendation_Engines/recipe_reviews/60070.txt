Good recipe. However, it is great with a few change. Try marinating the chicken for an hour in the mixture beforehand. I also cooked it slower (at 325) to ensure it remained moist. Turned out beautifully.

This is a wonderful recipe.  IO'm definately going to make it again. The only change I would add would be to lightly grease the pan or use Pam.  Because of the honey in the recipe it really stickes to the pan.

What a great change for baked chicken.  The nuts make it special and would definitely be great to serve to guests.  At first I thought it might be too sweet with the honey.  It turned out buttery with only the slightest bit of sweetness.  I will also try this with pork chops.

This recipe was EXCELLENT!!  My son and I usually eat legs, thighs, and wings as breast meat tends to be dry, but this was not the case in this recipe.  I used boneless, skinless breasts, and watched the baking time closely.  It still took approximately 30 minutes, but they were done to perfection--crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside, with just the slightest hint of honey flavor.  I served them on a bed of spring greens and drizzled them with ranch dressing and served garlic crescent rolls on the side.  DELICIOUS!!  Next time I'm going to try this coating with catfish fillets on the stove top.  Thank you laurag, this is now in my permanent file.

This was delicious!  We loved the mildly sweet taste and the pecans made a surprisingly yummy coating.  Used crushed corn flakes instead of bread crumbs (they tend to be less dry and more flavorful than traditional bread crumbs).  The combination of pecans and cornflakes was yummy!  We are making it this weekend for a group of friends.

Very good! I used walnuts, and subbed Olive Oil for the butter.  It was very juicy and flavorful.

This is a very good recipe, but if you are looking for a "crispy" coating this is not the recipe for it. I used thin cut boneless chicken breasts, but forgot to cut down on the cooking time and the chicken was a little dry.  Next time I will use regular breasts, so the chicken will remain juicy.  The combination of honey and pecans imparts a slightly sweet flavor, but it's not overly so.  I served this with baked sweet potatoes and a spinach souffle found on this site and the combination of color and flavors went beautifully together. Good family, weeknight meal.

This was excellent! It was very easy to prepare and very economical. I had all the ingredients in my pantry. My boyfriend loved it and insisted that I save it so we can have it again for company and for whenever. Because we like a little zing, the only change I made was to add about 3 T mustard to the honey and egg mixture. It was awesome! I served it with garlic mashed potatoes. This is part of my recipe collection now.

I thought this recipe was great, I made it last night for dinner.  I used Pecans and Macadamia nuts and it came out awesome.  However, as a side note, this does come out sweet, so don't make this for someone who does not like sweet things.  I personally enjoyed it.

Incredble!!!! I just made this the other day for the first time and it is amazing. Even better leftover and cold. I just got on here to review it and realized I completely forgot about the melted butter on top. Giving how good it was without it I will more than likely leave it off next time I make it...and there will be a next time!  I guess the only other changes I made was to leave the chicken in the honey/egg mixture overnight and then I double coated it. Coated it once then redipped in the honey/egg mixture and then recoated. Seriously, the best chicken I've ever made. Even my husband absolutely loved it.

I decided to try this recipe after reading all the good reviews it received.  I was very disappointed with the results.  Quite tasteless and bland.  I will stick to homemade shake & bake.  If you are looking for an excellent recipe try 'Chicken Breasts Pierre' which is also on this web site.

I made this recipe last week and it was so delicious!  I made a few changes.  I soaked the chicken in the egg & honey mixture like others had suggested. Instead of nuts and bread crumbs I used almond meal and substituted the butter with olive oil.  This is definitely a keeper! I just love this website!

I used boneless, skinless chicken breast, so that cut down on the cooking time. I also used fat-free butter spray to coat the chicken before baking, rather than real butter. Served it with butternut squash risotto and zucchini. Yummy!

Almost too easy to make and the chicken stayed very moist!  Baked on a silicon liner and it done after 32 minutes.  A little on the sweet side, too.  I think next time, I may try omitting the honey and adding a touch of sugar to the nut/crumb mixture.

Although I use allrecipes all the time and have found several favorite recipes on this site, I've never before been inspired to leave a review.  However, I just had to congratulate the creator of this recipe and say that as a life-long nut hater, I found this chicken to be phenomenal!  I can tolerate nuts if I have to, and the rest of my family likes them, so I made this dish thinking they would enjoy it and I would scrape most of the nuts off mine.  What a surprise when I found myself going back to scrape the extra nuts from the bottom of the baking dish onto my chicken, then eyeing my daughter's leftovers once she had finished!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for marinating the chicken in the egg/honey mixture while the oven was preheating (about 20 minutes), and I wouldn't change a thing.  Definitely company-worthy, and 5 stars!

Yum! This was so good and I can't wait to share it with others. I also marinated the chicken for about an hour and used olive oil instead of butter to cut down the calories and it turned out juicy and flavorful!

I'm rating this four stars only because my boyfriend didn't care for this as much as I did. I would rate it 4 1/2 if I could. I didn't want to spend the money on the nuts, so I bought a small bag of salad topping candied nuts instead, thinking they would add extra flavor, but they ended up over caremalizing and tasting almost burnt. I also had a little trouble getting the nuts to stick because I didn't crush/chop them enough. Next time I'll use my new food processor and it should turn out better. The chicken has a nice sweet taste and the crunch of the nuts was very pleasant. Maybe my boyfriend didn't like it as much because of the different nuts I used...
Also some suggestions: I used panko bread crumbs which were very good, but I also wondered if any body has tried cornmeal? I think I will do that next time and update if it's any good!
A little personal seasoning, like garlic powder/italian herbs might be good too, although I made it as is and it was good. =)

WHA'TS ALL THE HYPE ABOUT?? Most reviews rave about this recipe. I found the combination of nuts, breadcrumbs & honey very odd. Omitted the butter-wanted a less greasy,healthier dinner. I did not care for it. Will not make again!

I halved the recipe and it easily fed 2 small children and two adults, I sliced the chicken breasts in half to speed up the cooking time a bit, I also marinated the chicken in the egg and honey mixture over night. As far as the recipe goes it is wonderful, best chicken ever! (hubby says its a keeper) and it is very simple.

This recipe was spectular. My husband and my kids really enjoyed the recipe and it was so fast and easy. I used boneless chicken breast, I seasoned my chicken with a hint of salt and pepper prior to dipping it in the egg wash. I cooked my chicken on 350degrees for 40min so that it would not taste dry.  I served this with tossed salad and cresent rolls. My husband has asked me to cook it again before we finished eating dinner.

This deserves at least 12 stars! 6 for taste, 6 for easy prep work. I'm not a big fan of sweet meat dishes but this is one I love, and is now a favorite go-to recipe. I've made this on chicken and pork, and we prefer it on chicken (only tried pecans--don't like walnuts). The key to this is to MARINATE THE MEAT IN THE EGG/HONEY MIXTURE. The longer it marinates the better. I also very finely chop the pecans in my processor, and do so in large batches so I have the nuts ready to go for quick-fix meals. Panko crumbs help with crispiness, and I don't think this needs any salt. I spray a foil lined pan with olive oil, and each side of meat before baking. Comes out crispy every time. The only downside to this dish is that leftovers lose their crispiness (still taste great though!).

I made this for our Mother's Day dinner, and it was fantastic!  Everyone absolutely loved it, including myself, and I don't like nuts very much!  I used pecans and Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs, and I really packed the breading on each piece of chicken...I think that's what made them become really crispy in the oven.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I cook for two so we halved the recipe and used only two boneless chicken breasts.  Baked for 40 minutes.  This was delicious.  We have been looking for a recipe for a nut coated Salmon since having it at a local restaurant.  We will try that next.  Thank You to Laura G

Yum! Even better the second day. Make sure you have plain breadcrumbs (not Italian style) and serve it with zesty honey mustard on the side as a dipping sauce.

I've been using allrecipes.com and this is the first time I felt compelled to write one for this recipe.  This chicken was a delight to eat. I was a little wary of a recipe without any garlic in it, but I have been completely won over. This is going to be my go-to comfort food from now on!  The only change I would make is that you really only need about half the butter. I didn't completely melt it - I sliced it into a few chunks and placed it on top of the chicken before putting it in the oven. This allowed it to melt during cooking and saturate the bread crumb mixture.

I made the following changes to make this dish healthier/more flavorful: I marinated the chicken overnight in a honey mustard sauce--this way I only had to dredge the breasts through egg, not egg + honey because they were already sweet and soaked with the honey mustard.  Instead of bread crumbs I used wheat germ, which I feel gave the chicken an extra nutty flavor. I did not use butter at all. This was one of my favorite chicken dishes I have ever made!

This was really good.  Nice sweet flavor, but not overbearing.  I used walnuts, but want to try with pecans next time.  A nice change to regular chicken breasts.

My husband said, "I'd pay to eat this in a restaurant, you have to make this again!" I used boneless chicken breasts and followed the recipe exactly. I drizzled some honey over the top before serving. Gave the coating a little extra sweetness and moisture. YUMMY!

Wow!!  Everyone at dinner tonight thought I was a fancy-dancy cook!!  This looks so pretty and is really easy to make.  I used Panko bread crumbs for a little extra crispiness.  The taste is much milder as one would think.--which is good because I'm not a big fan of honey.  Everyone really raved on and on about this.  It is sure to impress!! ( I served with steamed green beans and roasted potatoes with tomatoes basil and garlic from this site)

Loved it!  I didn't really measure everything out, just used a lot of pecans and a lot of honey.  It was moist and yummy.  I didn't need to bake it for the full 40 minutes, though, 30 was enough.

Delicious! I made this for the first time tonight and was pleasantly surprised.  I was worried it would be bland, but it had a really nice taste.  I used thin-sliced chicken breast fillets so I slightly reduced the cooking time and they turned out wonderful.  I will definitely be making these again.

Simply wonderful!!!  I substituted corn flake crumbs for the bread crumbs and drizzled some extra honey on each piece of chicken before adding the butter.  Delicious!!!  My husband raved about this dish for days, and he wants me to make it for his mother when she visits!

This was pretty good.  Both my husband and I liked it.  If you think it's bland, mix 1/2 plain bread crumbs and 1/2 italian style bread crumbs or use all italian style.  We mixed both and it made it very flavorful.  I was concerned it might be too sweet, but it wasn't.  

I think it could use a sauce over it though but can't figure out what.  

I plan on making this for a dinner party.

I served this to my new boyfriend and he LOVED it as we all do.  I substituted Ritz cracker crumbs for the bread crumbs (they are more flavorful) and also drizzled extra honey over the top before baking.  Yummy!

This was terrible.  I'm sorry but this was thick and heavy with the nuts and breadcrumbs, I even tried to make a sauce for it and that didn't work either.

made this recipe tonight. used three large chicken breasts and sliced them in half. i did cut the recipe in half and it was plenty. just the right number of sweetness. cooked them for 30 minutes and sprayed the glass dish with non-stick spray, as other suggested. I also made some sauteed asparagus and rice; perfect sides! will definitely be adding this to the dinner rotation!!

I have made this before with pecans and bread crumbs, but I had an epiphany and decided to use honey roasted peanuts and crushed honey-nut Cheerios instead of breadcrumbs. Just put it in the oven, and I can't wait to see how it turns out!!

This was very tasty! A great way to add some variety to the way we have chicken for dinner! I made a few adjustments based on what I happened to have on hand. This means that I used almonds, buckwheat honey, and crushed Kix cereal!

Awesome flavor, but before the chicken was even done cooking, the honey/egg mixture started burning on the bottom of the pan. I only used one egg and 1/4 cup honey and it was more than enough. In order to get the honey mixed into the egg, I heated them both in the microwave for 15 seconds or so, just to make them warm enough to mix well. Otherwise I would have had beaten egg with clumps of honey in it. I used crushed Ritz crackers instead of the bread crumbs, and walnuts. I will probably make this again if I can think of a way to prevent the honey burning problem.

This was interesting.  I used panko bread crumbs and added horseradish dijon mustard to the honey.  I think the mustard made the dish.  It off-set the sweet.  My kids loved it!

Not sure what the fuss is about this chicken.  The honey was a nice touch and made you go hmmm, but this was nothing spectacular.  Just a basic baked chicken dish.  I may make it again but I won't be serving this for company as others have suggested because I don't think it's all that special.

I made this recipe using walnuts, panko bread crumbs and boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Since some reviews said it was quite sweet, i decreased the honey to 1/3 cup and it was delicious with just a hint of sweetness.  As others have mentioned, it did not get crispy but then again, i skipped the butter drizzle.  Altogether a great recipe. Just as delicious on sliced eggplant, roasted in the oven about 15minutes per side.

I'd give this 2.5 stars...it was ok, but not great.  I don't like meat to be super sweet so I cut back a bit on the honey and added some strong dijon mustard to the egg mixture to cut the sweetness and give it some bite.  The taste was ok but the texture was off...the bread crumbs stayed dry and untoasted even though I cooked it for the full time.  I did really love the pecans though, they toasted perfectly.  I will probably try this again, but thinking of trying crushed corn flakes instead of the bread crumbs.  Whatever you do, definately grease your baking dish or it will stick!!!

This recipe was great. The chicken had a nice crunch on top and was very moist in the middle. I cut the chicken into bit size strips and put it on top of a salad. Very yummy! Will make again for sure!

The flavor was delicious. However, the coating came out a little soggy. I think next time I will fry the chicken just long enough to get a crispy coat and then finish it off in the oven. This chicken was also very moist.

This was good but not outstanding. It wasn't overly sweet. I marinated the chicken breasts in honey for a couple hours. This made the honey get runny from the chicken juices. My husband was reminded of peanut brittle. It was something different but I probably won't make again.

I think I was expecting a little more sweetness...will try it next time drizzling with the honey and butter rather than adding the honey to the egg...also, the bottom of the chicken was a tad soggy...but, overall very yummy!  Served with mashed sweet potatoes and steamed broccoli!

My picky children loved this! My kids would have eaten twice as much!I used chicken tenders and peanuts for the nut because of allergies and filled a 9X13 pan. I forgot to butter the tops of the chicken, but it was still wonderful! There are few food dishes that all my five children like, but this is one! Great!

I drizzled with honey just before serving and it moistened it.  I think cooking time is too long so I would adjust down next time.  Otherwise, it was pretty good.

Loved this new recipe and so did my friends.  It's a new fav and really easy to make.  I cut chicken breast into fingers to cut cook time and allow for more breading.

Easy to make and everyone in the family liked. I used planko bread crumbs and served with honey.

This was by no means a bad recipe, but it was nothing special.  With all the recipes out there that I haven't tried yet, I don't think I'll make this again.  Still searching for the perfect baked chicken....

I just made this for dinner and it was wonderful. I added some orange juice to the egg/honey mixture, which gave it a nice added citrusy taste, and drizzled more honey and orange juice halfway through.  I used thigh cutlets instead since it was what I had (and juicier) and they took less than 30 minutes in the oven.  Sweet and nutty with an extra zing--they were great.  I served them with brown sugar sweet potatoes... :)

Excellent way to make chicken!  Prep was so easy.  We loved the flavor; honey and pecans go great together.  The nuts we had on hand were already salted, so didn't add any additional salt to the recipe and it was just right.

This is a fantastic recipe - pretty quick and easy to make.  I prefer the pecans over the walnuts - same as the family - but both are great.  I use loaf pans for the two dippins - it's about the right size.

This is my husbands favorite chicken recipe. He's the only meat-eater in the house (I'm a vegetarian), so I use half of all the ingredients to make smaller portions. The chicken comes out tender and delicious every time, according to anyone eating it, and it's super easy to make. Thanks for the recipe! :)

I loved the chicken!  The only change I made was that I used Panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  I did not sprinkle with butter before baking and I baked for 20 minutes, flipped chicken breasts and baked another 20 minutes. I have made this twice in one week!!!!

My husband loved it, but it was a little too sweet for my liking.  I cut the recipe in half and it was perfect for coating 4 chicken breasts.  I tried half with peanuts and half with pecans.  My husband liked the pecan version better.  Note to others, you'll need a big jar of honey if you are making the full amount.

This was so good and really easy!  To cut some of the fat I omitted the drizzled butter but was still very pleased with the results.  Will try to marinate the chicken in the egg/honey mixture next time!

This was delicious. I used chicken tenders instead, and it ended up tasting like a very healthy version of chicken fingers (I omitted the butter). Towards the last 5 minutes of baking, I added some brie cheese for a creamy texture on the side. So good!

An excellent recipe. I've made it twice - once with walnuts instead of pecans and with butter drizzled on top and once with a combination of walnuts and pecans and with olive oil replacing the butter. The latter was definitely better (5 stars instead of 4.5) but both were a huge success. Easy, quick and delicious.

This was amazing!  I too cooked it a little more slowly to make sure the chicken didn't get dry and it didn't.  It was perfect.  I did have to use half almonds and half pecans as I didn't have enough of either on hand but it was great.  Also, I cut it up and put in on a salad with dried cranberries...I don't remember the last time I ate salad without dressing!!

Wonderful but next time try this to lower the calories. Use Fiber One cereal ground into crumbs. Substitute 1/2 of the honey with fat free sweet and condensed milk. Spray baking pan with PAM or similar spray to prevent sticking. Still yummy!

What a nice change from the usual chicken.  I made this for a dinner party and used walnuts and saltines instead of bread crumbs.  I also used a tenderorizor and split the breasts which was a great serving size.  Drizzled with a little honey before serving for some extra sweet for honey lovers!  These were a big success!

I didn't have to marinate, but since the recipe didn't say you needed to (even though reviewers did) I thought I'd be okay.  It did not turn out well.  You couldn't taste much of the honey so the light pecan flavor was out of place.  Won't make it again.

This was sooooo good!  The only changes that I made were to add onion powder & garlic powder to both the egg/honey mixture & the pecan/breadcrumb mixture.  Oh, and I used boneless chicken thighs, because it was what I had on hand.  Hubby says nothing needs to be changed...it was perfect as is.  It's a definite do-over in our house.  I can't wait for our daughters to come home from college so I can make it for them too!  Thanks, Laura, for a delicious recipe!

I didn't like this, but I can't penalize the recipe for it. I don't like honey or walnuts...that would be like going to a store and buying a red dress, then wanting to return it because it's red. I mostly made this for my boyfriend, as I'm trying new recipes. I used 2 thick boneless chicken breasts and marinated them in the honey/egg mixture for a few hours while I ran errands. I cooked them in the oven for 50 minutes at 350. I forgot to add salt and pepper to the walnut/Italian breadcrumb mixture so I did so before serving. They were really juicy and my boyfriend said they were 'amazing' and that I had some 'serious culinary skills'. A great change from the usual chicken for about the same effort. :)

Me and my husband just finished eating it and we LOVED IT!!! Something about the honey and peacan mixture was just great! I'm sure it would be good with walnuts also but peacans are my favorite. Hubby said to make again so I will! Thank you!! Thank you!! ps- I think this would be company worthy!

This was a nice update on plain old baked chicken.  Make sure you take it out when it reaches 165 or it will dry out.  I only left mine in 5 minutes too long and it dried out a bit.  I'm sure next time it will be perfect.

I used boneless chicken breasts and crushed almonds for this recipe. Only took 35 minutes to cook in a 375 degree oven. I will continue to try variations on this recipe. Might be good with a dipping sauce as the coating is a bit dry.

Very good flavor.  I marinated the chicken in the egg and honey for about an hour as another reviewer suggested and the chicken was very moist. I also used Italian bread crumbs and added dried basil and dried thyme.  Will make again- thanks for the recipe!

My family liked this quite a lot. Since dh doesn't like pecans that much, he said that the pecan  taste was too strong, so I'll cut back on that next time.

I added 1/2 teaspoon of soy sauce to the egg mixture as I could tell that much honey was just too sweet for me & needed to tone it down.  That worked for me.  Didn't have bread crumbs so I made my own by putting bread slices in the microwave for a minute to speed up the drying process.
It turned out well.  The nuts make it seem fancy but it's simple.

I used Itallian flavored bread crumbs and almonds and it came out wonderful, "Adding it to the rotation!"

My husband & I absolutely loved this recipe. I did add some oregano, pepper and garlic powder to the egg mixture for a bit more flavor. Goes great with mashed potatoes too. This is now one of our favorite ways to fix chicken!

Family consensus on this was "interesting."  If you don't like sweet main dishes, don't try it.  It was not bad, but I don't think I will make it again.

This was very good. I used cashew nuts as I don't like pecans or walnuts. It's very similar to CASHEW CRUSTED CHICKEN from this site but this recipe didn't have as good flavour as Cashew Crusted Chicken. However the addition of breadcrumbs to the nut coating was wonderful. The breadcrumbs soaked up the excess juices and made the coating really crunchy. I will now use a combination of this recipe and the other one to create the perfect dish.

Very easy.  My husband really liked this.  I didn't care for the nutty taste, but that's because I'm not a fan in general.  If you are, I'm sure you'll love this, because the chicken comes out VERY tender and the honey flavor adds a perfect amount of sweetness.

Good, but not great. Chicken had an interesting flavor.. we liked the pecan taste, however this one just didn't "wow" me like I was hoping for.

This was a great recipe.  It reminded me of a pecan encrusted chicken that I had in a fancy restaurant on vacation.  We'll have this when we have guests.  My husband thinks I'm a gourmet cook when I make things like this.  I baked the chicken about 60 minutes (large pieces) and the outside was crispy while the inside was moist.

This was ok - the bread crumbs made it taste like stuffing. Maybe that's what it was supposed to taste like ; ) Anyway, probably won't make it again but it was worth a try.

I followed the directions to the letter. The end result was okay, but according to my family it wasn't anything to write home about. They said it was a bit bland. Great concept, but I will have to play with the recipe a bit if I make it again.

My family loved this!! I have 3 small, picky eaters and they all ate it. I even got a "mom this is AMAZING". I did use a couple of previous reviewers suggestions; I marinated it for about an hour before cooking and I also added some ground mustard into the marinade. I also mixed a little Panko into the breadcrumb mixture. Thank you for a great and easy recipe!!! I will definitely be making this again!

The cooking time/temp is off in my experience. Make sure the chicken has lots of room in the 9x13 and lower temp to 350 so the nut crust does not burn. Only 40 minutes for bone-in breasts was still pinkish and nuts burned.Tasted OK to me, but after cooking it and having it take way longer than planned I was not in mood to enjoy it much.

This is something that you just must try!  So easy!  I did not use pecans or walnuts, but instead opted for almonds.  I may not be able to compare the other options, but it's something that has made it's way into the family cookbook!  The only comment I have for the directions is that I found myself throwing out quite a bit of leftover ingredients.  The last time I cut the honey and eggs in half, and still had plenty.  I feel rather confident I could do the same with the dry mix ingredients as well.  Absolutely divine dish!

This was incredibly simple to make w/ gourmet results!  I tweaked it only a little bit by adding in some oregano and garlic powder to the pecan mixture, and used a combination of panko bread crumbs w/ regular bread crumbs.  To get the nuts finely chopped, I pulsed them in my vitamix.  

Thanks for sharing a recipe worthy of company!

My whole family loved this :)  I made this recipe exactly as printed using boneless chicken breats.  It was delicious!  I baked it with the Honey Roasted Red Potatoes - a recipe that I also found on this website.  It went together perfectly.
Thanks Laura for the wonderful recipe!!

I made this for my girlfriend's family and it was quite tasty. We used seasoned bread crumbs so we did not put any salt or pepper in but I would recommend doing so. I also used walnuts instead of pecans since I felt it would be better that way.

If you're in the mood for something sweet and crunchy (yet warm and tender), give this a try.  The leftovers make fantastic chicken caesar salad.

We used crushed walnuts for this recipe and they turned out well. Good, solid family dinner.

This is a great crusted chicken recipe! I used boneless skinless breasts, pounded them out, and baked them for 20 minutes. I also used less bread crumbs and more pecans.

This was delicious and so easy to make. Since we are not big into walnuts or pecans, I just omitted the nuts altogether and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Came out delicous. I think I will try marinating it like others suggested next time. Delicious. Thank you for the recipe.

While this recipe had a nice result, it definately did not meet my usual standards.  It had more of a resturaunt quality to it than home cooked.  The cook time is about 10 minutes too long.

I have made this a few times for my friends and they all agreed it was great.  I only used 1/2 a cup of pecans since they  don't like nuts too much and I used more honey because I have a sweet tooth. It is so good!

Loved this! Very nice flavor. Leftovers were great as a salad. Only downside was I wish they had been a little more crispy. Also added a little salt and pepper.

I used chicken legs for this recipe, the finished result was good.  The chicken was really moist and the honey gave it a subtle sweet flavour.

This was pretty good, but maybe could've used some sort of sauce.  A creamy honey mustard sauce, or something.  I did use boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts, so maybe that made a difference.  Good flavor, though, and my picky eight year old had a second helping.

I tried this recipe on out-of-town guests with rave reviews.  The flavor is light but complex, and all of the ingredients were in my cupboard already.  I followed Laura's instructions exactly except for using boneless chicken breasts.  It turned out beautifully!

Easy to prepare, and most everyone has these ingredients in their pantry!  I used chopped cashews because that was what was in my pantry last night.  I also added a touch more honey and a few dried herbs for a dash of taste. Simple preparation, good taste.

I thought this was DELICIOUS. Other than using boneless, skinless chicken breasts, I followed the recipe as is, and wouldn't change a thing. I used plain breadcrumbs and the honey added just the perfect amount of sweetness. Another reviewer commented on how they thought this was thick and heavy - but I found that not to be the case. I will definitely be making this again.

A four star only because I made changes. I took the others advice and spiced up the breading mix. I used paprika, cayenne, and some greek seasoning but I am sure you can you whatever you have on hand. I also drizzled honey and extra butter over the chicken. Another great tip is to spray the pan with oil. Very good and will make again!

This was okay.  I expected this to be sweeter and more flavorful.  I subsituted corn flakes as another suggested, but there was still something missing.  I'll probably try this again, with more honey and more salt/pepper.

Used chicken thighs, walnuts, and ground up wheat crackers instead of bread crumbs.  This is a winner, especially for weeknights when you need an easy, tasty recipe.

I made this recipe (using boneless chicken breasts cut into pieces instead of on the bone) for a recent party and we loved it.  I read loads of reviews (thank you all) and used some of your ideas.  It was great advice to use loaf pans for  marinating the chicken (which I did for 24 hours in the egg and honey mixture) and for dredging in the pecan/bread crumb mixture.  The loaf pans  made for easy work and cleanup. Be sure to thoroughly dredge to get a good coating.   I would have liked a crunchier breast so I think I will bake it at 375 as suggested in the recipe.  I lowered it as it was boneless .  Also, the cooking time was more like 15 minutes before I flipped it and about 12 minutes more.  I did use a thermometer to make sure it was 160 which caused the longer cooking time.

Not a fan. Flavor was a little sweet and mostly bland. Definitely needs some more seasoning/marinating. Had high hopes because of the good reviews.

I loved it. Never thought to add honey and eggs to chicken. I have it at three stars though because I was the only one in the family to eat it. The wife and kids took a few bites and didn't care for it. I used large drumsticks and had to cook for 25 minutes longer though.

5 star. Delicious. I crushed walnuts and corn flakes instead of bread crumbs. A bit less calories..

This recipe was easy to follow and didn't disappoint.  Substituted almonds since that's what I had in the pantry.  Served with rustic mashed potatoes and corn relish.  Would have taken picture but was all gone before I could get camera!

I loved this recipe and I just didn't add the nuts. Still tasted very delicious.

This was very good! We used pecans and peanuts for a more nutty flavor and I think next time I would add a tablespoon or two of brown sugar to up the sweetness but overall it was very tasty.

OMG! I loved this recipe enough to use the phrase OMG! I was short on honey though and instead put 1/4C of maple syrup in with the egg in addition to honey. Wow, this was awesome served with some mashed potatos and garlic veggies! My 4yo son and my husband both raved about it, so much so that I had to take the baking dish away so they wouldn't make themselves sick! The honey and butter seal in the moistness and the nutty taste makes you come back for more. So incredibly good!

Amazing! I don't love chicken, nor sweet meats.  But, the rest of my family does.  Struggling for dinner ideas without going to the store, I thought I'd give this a try. Instead of breasts, I had 5 boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  After reading the reviews, I made a few adjustments. First adjustment: I seasoned the thighs with The Fresh Market's Poultry Spice Rub (sea salt, coriander, garlic, basil, sage, cumin, red chili flakes, black pepper, mustard seed).  Second adjustment:  I marinated the seasoned thighs in the honey/egg mixture for slightly more than 1 hour.  Third Adjustment:  In addition to the salt and pepper, I added a dash (maybe 1 1/2 dashes)of curry to the pecan/bread crumb mixture.  Because my meat was not very thick, I started out at 325 degrees for 30 minutes, but I couldn't get a reading on my meat thermometer.  So, I panicked and increased the temperature to 350 degrees for another 20 minutes.  As it turned out, I never got the thermometer to work, but the chicken was done (slightly overdone probably) and delicious!  Not only did my husband and son love it, but I even loved it!  Extremely flavorful!  When I make it again, assuming I use thighs (more flavorful than breasts, usually), I will either bake as directed or at 350 degrees.  The chicken itself would've been great continuing at 325, but to get the nutty coating crunchy, the higher temp was best.  I tossed some left over honey-glazed carrots and fresh broccoli into some flavored wild rice--perfect!

Ok, I hate rating a changed recipe but the basics are very good. I have to eat gluten free so I substituted rice Chex for the bread crumbs. I just pulsed the cereal, about 2 cups, with about 1 1/2 cups whole pecans in my food processor until it looked the right size. I also pounded my chicken to tenderize it then put it in the egg/honey mix for a couple hours because I had the time. I will make this again! I gave it 4 stars because I changed it and think that the cereal was better than bread crumbs would have been for me.

This was easy and tasted great.  There was a little sweetness from the honey and crunch from the nuts.  I used pecans.  Next time I would use a food processor to chop the nuts, it would be faster than using a knife like I did this time.
