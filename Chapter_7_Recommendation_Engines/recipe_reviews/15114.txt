My mother made this recipe when I was younger. Its wonderful! The only thing I would like to comment is that you need to wait 10 minutes before you swirl the choc chips. Then cook for another 10-15 minutes for the marble effect to look right. 3 minutes is not long enough.. that's why some people commented that it didn't swirl correctly.

I don't know WHAT happened with this recipe - I followed it exactly and just wound up with a mushy bubbly mess. I let it bake for as long as I could without burning it but it was like there was way to much butter (I actually used 1 cup of margarine). Perhaps if I had cut it back to 1/2 cup or even added an extra cup of flour it would have turned out. Very disappointing

I thought this recipe turned out pretty good. The bars were a hit with my friends.:) On suggestion from the other reviewers I used less (only 1/2 cup) of butter. This resulted in a less "bubbly" or "squishy" bar. Unlike other reviewers I thought 3 minutes was plenty of time for the chocolate chips to melt. My advice is to check on them at 3 minutes. Poke a chip with a butter knife. If it's soft it should marbleize just fine. If not give it a little more time - not too much or the bars will set. Also I decided to sprinkle a 1/2 cup pecans over the bars after 10 minutes of baking because I like pecans in chocolate chip cookies. Finally I lightly covered the pan with foil during the last three minutes of cook time because I noticed that the surface of the bars was cooking faster than the center. The bars turned out great. As you can see in the picture I posted they look pretty too.:)

Quick and a snap to make. I got rave reviews for these at a birthday party and by everyone who comes over after I've made them. Add more chocolate chips and they disappear even faster!

Although this recipe didn't turn out the way I expected, it was delicious. After 3 minutes, the chips were not melted enough to swirl so the cookies didn't look marbelized. But it was just enough to make the cookies taste very rich. I'd call them 'blondies' and I plan to make them often.

My mom discovered this recipe when I was in my pre-teens. I loved baking it and we all loved eating it! Kids really like to "swirl" the chocolate chips. It's fast and easy too.

I feel there may be an error in this recipe in the amount of butter that it calls for. I too followed the recipe perfectly and my result was also very squishy and mushy. I had to double the baking time to get it to firm up a bit. As someone suggested I baked it 10 minutes and then swirled the chocolate chips. Took me a minute or two to master the "swirling technique" but I got okay in the end. Very tasty recipe but I may suggest reducing the butter some. I also added about half a cup more chips than it called for. Made it extra chocolatey:)

This turned out great. The marbled effect is very pretty and you'd never know it came from a swirl of choclate chips.

Simple and Delicious! My 9 yo daughter and I made these for a bake sale at school. I'm not sure why people are saying you need to wait 10 minutes before swirling....maybe it's the type of chips you use? Mine swirled just fine at 3 minutes. These are a keeper in my house:) psst...a few didn't make it to the sale;)

I read the reviews before I made this and tweaked it as I thought was necessary. I only used 3/4 of a cup of butter and I added a pinch of salt with the dry ingredients. I was using mini morsels so I just used enough to cover the top it didn t need a whole cup. I waited five minutes before swirling and it was perfect. When I first put the batter in it didn t quite reach the edges but the swirling helped and then once it baked all the way it was fine. Ended up baking a total 25 minutes after the original five minutes. Came out perfect and they taste great. Nice and moist without being overdone. I will definitely try these again!

I had to bake these for about 30 minutes to get the middle to not be a gooey mess and by then the edges were overdone. It was fine right out of the oven but when these cooled down they were dry. I did use the specified sized pan and followed the recipe exactly.

These were delicious. I was a little concerned when I pulled them out of the oven because the center was really jiggly but once they cooled down they were the texture I expected. They were very easy to make (I did wait 10 minutes before swirling the chips in like the other reviewer advised) and my kids loved them (okay I did too!). Just make sure you have plenty of milk in the house...they're really rich!

Ehh...these were good but not great. I found them much too thick in the 9x13 pan. They marbelized just fine at 3 minutes. Wish I had made regular chocolate chip cookies instead. Also I think this recipe should have some salt in it. Maybe then the bars would match my original expectations.

These are fantastic! I've had it saved to my recipe box forever and just realized that I never comment on it. I've made them at least 5 or 6 times and they are always perfect. They don't last long around here!

I altered this recipe a bit for health purposes. I used Bob's Red Mill Whole Wheat Pastry Flour lessened the white sugar to 2/3 cup and added 1 tsp of baking powder. I also waited 6 minutes to swirl the chips. They were a hit at our Superbowl 2009 dinner party.

I made this twice in the last week. So easy to make and had all the ingredients in the house already. Delicious addition to our XMas parties this year!! I only was using white sugar and played with reducing the sugar a bit as I added more chocolate chips the 2nd time around. Will definitely be saving this one for the future! Seems like an easy recipe to adapt with adding nuts or cranberries:).

I added a teaspoon of salt to the flour mixture. Used Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Gluten Free flour (daughter has celiac). Baked an extra 10 minutes. AMAZING! Can't even tell they are gluten free either.

I have rediscovered this recipe SOOO yummy. I used to make these when I was a kid so this is a delicious memory of cooking for my brothers now my family loves them too. I use more chocolate chips- probably 1 3/4 cups- for a fudgy cookie. Also bake for 10 min. before attempting to marble them. I underbake them slightly for a soft fudgy cookie.

I needed a quick delicious dessert/snack for a party and stumbled upon this recipe and oh my goodness it is amazing. It was a huge hit at the party and since then everytime I need to make something I always make this and it is always a smash. They are so good and people are constanly complimenting me or asking how to make them. I give out this recipe all the time and best of all its very easy. Hope everyone enjoys this recipe as much as everyone I make it for does. Well off to my husbands softball game where I made two batches to give to the players and fans. Enjoy I always do.

These were good but not great. I thought they were WAY too brown-sugary - the dough was almost caramelized. I also had a lot of trouble getting the chocolate chips to melt.

I was not impressed with these. Ten minutes was too long for me to wait to swirl the chips because it was already setting. I found these rather dry. I'm giving them three stars though because maybe I did something wrong along the way. The taste itself wasn't bad--they were just a little too dry for my liking.
