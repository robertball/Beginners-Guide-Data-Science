I love sans rivals and this recipe is a keeper. for those who doesn't have cream of tartar you can use (for 4 egg whites)1/2 tbsp vinegar, and 2 tbsp of cornstarch, add it in one tbsp at a time after egg white are already incorporated with sugar and is already stiff and glossy. this procedure helps stablelize the meringue.  For the butter cream i just whipped up one brick (around 250g) 100% butter at room temp.(make sure you're not using margarine, cuz it would taste funny) until light and fluffy, added 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp vanilla and 1/4 cup ground cashews then fold in 1/4 cup WHIPPED Cream. i find this twist gives a lighter nuttier butter cream. for those having some trouble with the meringue sticking, try cooking it a bit longer to make sure the bottom of the meringue is dry so you can easily peel away the parchment or aluminum foil (wax paper doesn't work for me).

This recipe taste great!  It can be very hard to make on the first try.  There's one thing very important that was left out about the buttercream, and that is, after you mix the egg yolk and sugar mixture on high speed you need to chill it after that.  Then when it's chilled you may mix in the butter spoonfulls at a time.  If you don't do that the buttercream will come out liquidy.  Also another mistake I made on my first try was trying to use wax paper.  DO NOT USE WAX PAPER!  Parchment paper is great!  Thanks for the recipe I will definitely make many more times.

The buttercream filling is way too sweet and 'heavy'.  I've tasted Sans Rival where the
filling is truly light.  There's got to be a trick to get the filling light aside from beating the butter until light and fluffy. I used a heavy duty stand mixer and still ended up with a 'heavy' filling.

This is my second time baking this using the same recipe but this time I used real buttercream icing suggested by one of the reviewer from the Philippines. I whipped 1c.unsalted butter until light and fluffy add 1/4 c. of powdered sugar a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of clear vanilla. The icing is not too sweet just right for the very sweet meringue. I added 1/2c. almond  (chopped)in the icing and freeze it before eating. It reminds me of Goldilocks  sansrival . Just a tip , I greased and flour the foil and baked the meringue for 10-13 more minutes,adjust oven rack in the middle and rotate the pan halfway. Remove the meringue while its hot and place them on a wire rack to cool.Thanks for the recipe. I think the yolk and butter mixture for the icing is way too sweet and heavy.

This recipe is great but i tried adding 1/2 cup all purpose flour in the meringue mixture. After beating the egg whites, fold in the flour and the nuts, this made it easier to handle, plus after the meringue is cooked, try putting a very damp cloth a the back of the meringue for about a minute and i was able to tear the parchment paper easily.  I love this recipe will will surely make it again.

a wonderful recipe!! i added an extra five to ten minutes to the meringue baking time, and found that a crisper shell made it easier to handle.  it also makes for an interesting play of textures-- a crunchy top with a firm and chewy center. magnificent!

Excellent, rich dessert. The preparation is involved and not for the novice, but well worth all the work. The buttercreme filling is exquisite.

I cooked the meringue an extra 5 minutes.     I couldn't get filling right for this and gave up & just used a regular butter cream recipe w/ some rum flavoring added.  Turned out pretty well.

Sans rival truly stands up to its name!  Really delicious and extremely decadent. Just look at the ingredients!  I had to reduce the sugar from 4 cups to 3 1/2 cups coz it was so sweet!  My husband, a dessert connoisseur, said this is his absolute favorite dessert.  I've made it 4 or 5 times now eventhough it's not easy to make.  But I can assure you it's well worth the effort. People just rave about it!  In the past, I used parchment paper but I had trouble  removing the meringue cleanly.  So I bought silicone baking mats and they did the trick!  I waited a minute after removing the meringue from the oven and then I carefully peeled off the meringue from the silicone baking mat and the whole thing came right off!  There's also nonstick aluminum foil available in the market but I haven't tried that yet.  But if the meringue does break up, I find it doesn't matter a whole lot.  It gets covered by the buttercream filling anyway and then frozen.  Thanks a million for posting this fantastic recipe!

This is my favorite dessert and I was so happy to find this recipe on this site.  Hubby made it for my birthday and it was great. Everyone who tried it, loved it and had seconds.  He made one for a potluck at work and it was wiped out.

Awesome recipe. We did however, cut down on the sugar for both the meringue and the butter icing. This is my first time making this. I dusted the pan with flour and poured the meringue right in. After coming out of the oven, I waited until it was just warm, and removed it from the pan. Perfect! The next time though, I'll opt to chop the cashews a little teenier. Thanks for sharing.

This turned out amazing. My titas and titos were raving about it. This is a very special filipino recipe, indeed, as it takes a lot of effort, and it's not one of the staple desserts you find at most filipino parties. This dessert can also get kinda pricey to buy too, so it's wonderful to know that we can all enjoy it homemade. Definitely stands out on the dessert table and a rare treat well worth all the time and effort. FIVE STARS!!! Maraming salamat po sa recipe :)

I've made this several times and it always gets two thumbs up from my Filipino friends. Instead of the rum, I add a teaspoon of vanilla to the egg yolk mixture. It is important to chill the buttercream before adding it to the meringue; otherwise it is too thin. One of my favorite desserts ever!

Thank you for sharing your recipe.  I read several reviews prior to making it. I followed the use of 1 1/2 C of sugar  for the buttercream and the same amount for the egg whites. It is delicious.
I used greased parchment paper to line the pans . I did not have any problem removing the egg white wafers.
For the buttercream, I added the egg yolk and sugar syrup mixture slowly into the whipped butter.  It came out well, not runny at all.
I will do this recipe again.

Since this is a very rich dessert, I used 10 egg whites and 6 egg yokes. For the filling, I used only 1cup water with ¼ c water. It turned out real good. My husband who does not really eat desserts much, love it!

Great recipe! My only advise is to use less sugar. If you cut down by half or one a cup still same result but much nicer

4 cups of sugar altogether. Followed the recipe to a T but I should have followed my instincts to cut back on sugar. I would also cut back on the 12 egg yolks.  For those who prefer their desserts extremely sweet and rich, this recipe would be a hit though.

It came out well.  Very good, very rich.  
It's a lot of work though, so I will only make it on very special occasions.

The recipe is delicious but I found it too sweet. I reduced the  sugar to 1 1/2 cups for the meringue, and 1 cup for the buttercream. Do not bother to take out the butter in the refrigerator ahead of time to soften it. Do not beat the butter separately. After you add the simple syrup to the egg yolks, beat in the butter one cube at a time. Then chill. Before layering the buttercream to the meringue, beat it until light and fluffy. I also added some chopped cashews to the buttercream.

Tried it for the first time... Difficult but worth it.  I didn't use parchment paper.. I just greased and floured the underside of the non Teflon baking pan.  Baked it, then used the spatula to remove the merengue from the pan (very slowly slice underneath), then let it cool on a rack until dry and hard.  The butter frosting is tricky.  I didn't cool down the syrup/egg yolk mixture so it became runny when mixed with the butter (I should have read the reviews first). I also cut down the sugar in the frosting and the merengue. Used 1 1/2 cups for the merengue and the frosting (instead of 2 cups)
