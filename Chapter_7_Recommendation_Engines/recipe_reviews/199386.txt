I fixed this exactly as directed. I did cut the receipe in half since I was feeding only my husband and me. We both  thought it was very good.  I wouldn't change a thing.  The steaks held together well, and beef base and worchestershire sauce flavored the steaks just right. I would suggest spraying the pan before browning the meat. I cooked in an electric skillet which was large enough to cook all of the patties at once.  Thanks for a good and easy recipe.

This is Wonderful. I did add some beefy Lipton onion because I didn't have the beef base on hand. I only used 1/2 packet thinking it might be to salty. 5 stars on smell & taste! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent dish.  One of my wifes favorites.  I do not use the bread, and do not completely cook the hamburger before smothering in gravy.  Has turned into a weekly dish.

The patties were great!  The "gravy" was terrible!  I should've known better than to make mushroom soup for gravy.  Homemade brown gravy would've been MUCH better.  I salvaged my gravy by adding Kitchen Bouquet browning & seasoning sauce.  I'll make these patties again, but not with canned soup.

Made minor changes.  I did have beef base or worchesterchire sauce so I omitted them and the fresh onion--I used a few tablespoons of onion soup mix instead.  I only had 20 oz of hamburger--though I did not scale it.  I added a few tbsp of the soup mix to the mushroom gravy as well (served over buttered noodles).  Everyone loved it, kids and adults!

10 Stars for Quick & Easy! The gravy is a wonderful taste. I too used 1/2 packet of Beefy onion. As the recipe states this can be easily tweaked to your liking. It is fast & Easy & thats what i look for. Taste is well & you can put your own spin or creation on it!

On the whim I searched for smothered HS and found this recipe!!  I was tired of the humdrum of spaghetti and hamburger helper (dont hold it against me I havent made that in MONTHS).   I made this this past Wed and the kids loved it, I JUST made it again tonight.  I left a few out of the gravy and the kids made their own hamburgers with them...lol.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

So good! Hubby was in heaven.  The gravy is great.  We had it over mashed potatoes.  I sauted about a cup of thinly sliced onion, and added those to the gravy.  Will make again!

This was a total winner in our house. I had to simplify things just a little. I used a packet of onion soup mix and beef broth in the meat mixture along with the bread and eggs. I did the rest as directed and it was delicious! Thank you for posting the recipe! I will make this a staple.

Great little salisbury steak. I used a cube of beef boullion for the beef base and cut this in half except for the soup/water part. Very easy and very tasty too. Thanks JustJen33.

My husband and my 9yr old LOVED this!  I improvised only b/c I did not have the exact ingredients you called for on hand.  Instead of beef base, I just used a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Used fresh red onion instead of minced, and a few hawaiian rolls instead of white bread.  These turned out perfect, and were a huge hit.  I will definetely make these again.

My boyfriend isn't big on any gravy except white/milk gravy so I made these without the gravy. Used Worchestershire sauce instead of the beef base and these were awesome. He ate until he couldn't eat anymore. Said it was the best hamburger steak he had since his mom, who is now in her 80's and doesn't cook anymore, had made them for him years and years ago. :)

Definitely has become a weekly favorite. Took some leftover to work and several coworkers now make it weekly too. Only deviation from recipe I made was to add beef onion dry soup packet to meat (all I had on hand). My very picky 10 year old loved it. I usually have leftover so next day I add another can of cream of mushroom, break patties up and throw over cooked egg noodles.

this did not work too well for us.  Maybe we had our expectations too high though.  The meat was very balnd and had no real flavor. I even added some extra garlic and onion powder when mixing it up.  The gravy was ok at best and very disappointing since we usually love gravy and cream sauces.  I think  I will be looking for a different recipe next time.

I couldn't give 5 stars because I used 1 pkg Beefy Onion Lipton soup mix instead of beef base and reduced fat soup.  I think I will add a few extra ingredients to the gravy next time so it won't have as much of a "cream soup" taste.  This is nit-picking a bit, I still consider this a good recipe as is.  Fast, easy, and pretty tasty.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong with this, but it turned out pretty mediocre for us.  The sauce was good, but the beef itself was totally bland and dry.  I might try it again with a few changes, though since we really liked the sauce.

This recipe probably won't blow anyone's mind, but it's still pretty good for how simple and quick it was to make. The only different thing I did was to add half of a beef bouillon cube to the sauce mixture. The gravy is great over mashed potatoes with green beans on the side. I'm sure we'll be having this quickie dinner again, thanks!

Didn’t have cream of mushroom so used cream of chicken. Still really good. Like others, I used the dry onion soup as the beef base.

O made this for my kids and I for dinner. Turned out good, smelled amazing. Kids did say that it seemed a little dry, but I may have cooked the burgers too long before putting into sauce. I made a couple changes to it. Instead of beef cube, I used beef broth. I put 2 tablespoons into beef mixture. Instead of 1 can of water I used 1 can of beef broth. I really enjoyed it and would make it again. Might use bread crumbs though as I didn't prefer the larger chunks of bread that remained in the finished product.

This is a keeper...I used a half pack of onion soup mix in the meat mixture  and added the rest to the gravy I was out of minced onions..it was great..I doubled the gravy to have extra for mashed potatoes..Great comfort food!!!

It was ok but I used Corn Starch and didn't get the same look as the picture, at all.  I'd make it again, probably but not sure it'll be a family fav.  Sorry!

We are not mushroom lovers so I made with onion gravy instead. Finished in oven instead of stove top. Oh, and I moistened with V8 because hamburg was dry. Hubby went back for seconds...For us, it was a cross between salisbury steak and mini meatloaves.

This was a pretty good meal and it was easy to make. When you are tasting the gravy by itself the mushroom may seem over whelming but once you taste it with burger that has the beef broth in it, the meal comes together and taste great!

Tasty recipe, I thawed 3lbs instead of 2lbs so I had to add a lil more seasonings, I didn't have beef base so I used the same amount Onion Soup Mix, I used whole wheat bread, and instead of water with the soup I filled the can 1/2 with Heavy Whipping Cream and 1/2 with Beef Broth, after I took out the patties (used a big electric skillet) I threw in 1 large chopped onion and 1 can mushrooms and sauteed, then put my soup mixter in with that, then added the patties back in, Great recipe!  THANKS!

Simple, tasty, everyone loved it!  This is highly recommended for those times you don’t know what to make or you want something a bit different. I sautéed 2/3 of a onion in butter and topped the meat with onions and Swiss cheese. ENJOY!

It may be due to my substitutions, but to me this recipe was bland. I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I used onion powder instead of minced onion and concentrated beef broth (made from a bouillon cube) instead of beef base.  I don't typically have minced onion or beef base on hand, so I may continue experimenting to adjust this recipe to my existing pantry items and taste. I was also confused about whether to mix the bread chunks in with the beef when making the patties, but I mixed in the bread anyway because the recipe didn't say to remove the bread. This resulted in some pretty large, soggy bread pieces in the steaks even after cooking. Next time I will rip the bread into smaller pieces. With a few tweaks to fit my preferences and what I usually have on hand, I think this recipe has potential to be a staple dinner in our house because of 
its ease!

I used venison instead of beef.  We are big deer hunters.  We like it and I've made it several times.  The last time I made it I didn't have beef base so I used 1 beef bouillon cube.

My first time making them and it was a hit!! instead of the bread pieces I used plain bread crumbs. I also added a dash of Worcestershire sauce to the egg mix. Instead of minced onions I used a package of Lipton onion soup mix. I also used to package of brown gravy mix for my gravy and smothered them the same way. I will be making these again

It was soooo yummy! I had to use cracker crumbs instead of bread bc we were actually out (weird right?). I tried going without but the patties were falling apart in my hands so the crumbs definitely helped thicken it up.  I tasted the "gravy" and it was a little bland so I added salt, pepper and garlic powder.  After cooking for 20min. it was still pretty thin so I added 2 teaspoons of flour to thicken up the gravy.  Next time I will probably just try half a can of water and see if that helps but Hubby approved and this is going in our keep box! :)

When I've made this in the past I followed the directions, but tonight when I made it I added some garlic and onion to the cream of mushroom and Worcestershire mixture and it was wonderful!

This was really easy to make and had a great taste after reading some of the reviews and making my own tweaks. I used 1/2 envelope of lipton onion soup mix in place of beef base and minced onion. I only made 3 nice size steaks with about a pound of meat, since there is only 3 of us. I also used 1 egg, 2 slices of bread and milk in place of water. I will definately make again.

I can't give this any stars...I used the serving caculator for 2 servings and it showed 9 cups of beef base...I KNEW this wasn't right...so I jmade up 4 cups...here in the MidWest beef base is liquid..anyway, I made it according to what the calculator said minus 5 cups of the beef liquid...the patties didn't hold together, everything fell apart when trying to turn the patties and the flavor was bad...not horrible but bad..

This was pretty good stuff. I followed the recipe to a T. We enjoyed it with mashed taters and green beans =))
