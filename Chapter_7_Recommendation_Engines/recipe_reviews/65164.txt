This is a great recipe! I prefer to roast the asparagus with a little olive oil and lemon pepper. Very tasty!

This was really amazing - I was a bit leary about the artichokes in the dish even though we love them but it was really great my family loved it, I thought the sauce was perfect! I think next time I will probably add some grilled red peppers for some more color.   - oh this recipe makes a lot! so I scaled it down to 1/3 and still had a big bowl.

Good enough as is, but I couldn't resist throwing in some capers and chopped fresh parsley.  I did, however, lose the cayenne which in my mind would have been an unnecessary distraction.  I drizzled the dressing on to taste.   Very much appreciated a "potato salad" that was a little more gourmet-ish than most.   I served this along with broiled lobster tails and The Best Seafood Stuffed Mushrooms, also from this site.

I liked the combination of asparagus and red potatoes, but I thought the dressing did not suit well. The lemon was quite strong, but the oil flavor somehow came off strong as well - and I didn't even add all of the dressing! I added some honey to try to tone it down but it didn't work so well. I gave it a three because I think, with some tweaking, it could be a good salad.

Loved it!  Would be wonderful at a summer B.B.Q. with a juicy burger or steak! Definetly let it chill!

Great concept and flavor, but next time I'll tweak the cooking methods and times.  I had mushy potatoes.  And I reduced the olive oil to 1/2 c, and it's still more dressing than I'd like for that amount of food.

I was "using up" leftover asparagus and had artichoke hearts on hand. This was a great combination that I found using the "search ingredients" function. I didn't have red potatoes on hand so I parboiled and refrigerated some frozen "southern style" (chunky) hash browns. Half the recipe made three generous servings.  I was glad to be the one to eat the leftovers on day two.

Made this as a side dish for slow cooked corned beef. The mustard flavor complimented the corned beef quite well. I added honey to the mustard recipe for a twist and even drizzled some of the dressing over the meat. It was delicious! Also found it easier to pull potatos out after they were done and add the asparagus to the water to cook for 5 minutes. I cooled both the potatos and asapargus off in an ice bath before combining all ingredients. This salad is best served cold especially in the summer.

Great fresh alternative to mayonnaise based potato salad. Recipe makes quite a lot but can easily be scaled down. Will definitely be a go to recipe.

It was okay. It was a lot of work and my wife, daughter and I weren't crazy about it. I could possibly see a serve-hot version of this being much more appealing. Also, now I know I don't like asparagus boiled or served cold.

Lovely recipe. I added about a cup of fresh grated Parmesan cheese and sautéed mushrooms. Also used Meyer lemon infused olive oil. Will make again!

4.5  Loved the different tasting dressing although I used slightly less oil.  No chives so used green onions.

I really liked this. It was a nice change from a mayonnaise based potato salad, but equally as filling. The potato cook time was very precise, but I did have to double the asparagus cooking time. I suppose I also made 1/2 recipe. I used 1 lb 12 oz of mixed colored potatoes, about 1/2 lb of asparagus, 1 can drained artichokes, and I made 1/2 recipe of dressing. I subbed green onion for the chives and added a little more black pepper than I normally do, due to leaving out the cayenne which I just don't care for. I used safflower oil, as that is just what I had. My only addition was a few sprinkles of garlic salt to the dressing in addition to about 1/4 tsp of regular salt which I didn't precisely measure. The only downside is this made 4 meal sized servings only with a re-calculated calorie count to 426 per servings. This is so filling, anyway, not much else can really be eaten with it. Thanks, I may consider making this again as a lunch type recipe.

My husband really doesn't like potato salads, especially ones that are creamy. I tried this one because it was not mayo- based and it was a huge hit -- even with him (which is saying alot)!
