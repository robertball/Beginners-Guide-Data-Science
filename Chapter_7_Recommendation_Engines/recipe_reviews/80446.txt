Loved these cookies.  Were easy to make and roll out.  I added one egg to the recipe, but followed the rest of it.  The cookies were very moist and the icing was great.  Plan to use this icing on cakes as well.  Very, very yummy and my kids were able to help with the whole thing.

very good recipe i had to add a little bit of water to make more of a dough. I also added one egg.For flavor I added some pumpkin spice inside and pumpkin spice/sugar for the top. plain ones with mint chocolate chips on top were awsome.my 9 year old loved them. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe- ity definitely rivals regular cout out cookies!  I added an egg to the recipe and the result was extra moist cookies that remained soft even days later.   They seemed better rolled out on the thick side.

I made this recipe for a "girls day" my 7 year old had.  I made a batch and a half and there was plenty of dough for the 6 kids to roll out.   I added 2 medium eggs to the batter, as noted by other reviewers.  The dough was tasty and easy to work with and the cookies have stayed nice and soft.  I skipped the frosting (too many hands in the kitchen this time around) so no comment on that.  I made the dough a day in advance, rolled it out on 5 sheets and left it in the freezer till we were ready to use it - worked great!

Instead of milk I added 1 cup sour cream.  I also increased the vanilla to 1 Tbls. instead of 1 tsp.  I added cinnamon to the roll out flour.  I did not have to chill at all.  these rolled out great.

These cookies were great. Unlike most cookies these were still soft and moist the next week. I even warmed 1/2 of the  milk just enough to disolve a teaspoon of instant coffee and added it to 1/2 the dough to give a coffee taste, since I am a coffee junkie lol and they were great too.

It's simple, it's GREAT and it's yummy. I myself like them as tea biscuits. They're excellent, not strong or overbearing. Thank You for Sharing this one.

I followed the recipe and found I had to add more milk in order for it to become doughy because of the excess amount of flour included.  I don't think I'll use this one again.

My nine year old son is a budding chef who never likes to follow recipes.  He made these cookies AWESOME!  Best cookies I've ever had in my mouth!  He added an egg, more milk, some peanut butter, marshmallow creme, and dark chocolate chunks until the dough was soft.  He didn't make the frosting and didn't chill them first.  They are unbelievable!!!  We made 36 cookies.

I also added an egg to the batter as other reviewers did, and had to add more milk. The dough was almost as crumbly as a graham cracker pie crust w/o them! I didn't cut them out w/ cutters, I just sliced them after refrigeration to make it easier and faster than cut-outs. I wanted them rounded for egg shapes for easter.The cookies tasted good, not very sweet, but a good flavor. Goes well with any frosting...adds more sweetness. I saved some plain to have with coffe. yum

Very easy to make! I baked these with a 7 year old today, nothing so complicated that she lost interest. While the dough was chilling we made the icing in numerous colors. Both turned out wonderful. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to teach a child to bake cookies, very child friendly.

Definitely needed to DOUBLE the milk amount to have good consistency.  I agree that the labor required is not worth the results--biscuit-like.

These were very easy to make and roll out.  Perfect recipe for Christmas decorating cookies for my family as my son is allergic to eggs and this recipe does not call for them.  They are not overly sweet which is nice as well.  The dough does need a little more milk to properly mix together but other than that it was great.  Thanks for the recipe.  We were finally able to decorate Christmas cookies and had so much fun.

I was very pleased with this recipe. I took some other peoples advice and added an egg and used 2 tsp vanilla. I tinted the icing different colors and the kids had a lot of fun decoracting their cookies.

There is way too much flour in this recipe. You can't even form a dough from it.  I had to add in more wet ingredients to do anything with it and it was very bland.

This is a good cookie option for those who can't have eggs.  After cooking, the cookie will not have the firm "bite" that a cookie with eggs would have, but it still tastes good.  I made the following changes:  added a little extra milk to get the dough to bind together, increased the cooking time to 9 minutes.  When I took the cookies out at 6 minutes, they weren't fully cooked and even after cooling fell apart because they were so doughy.

I made these for a going away party and everyone loved them! Icing was great and made it easy to decorate. I also added 1 egg and additional milk for the dough, but they had more of a biscuit texture than I would have liked.

I received loads of compliments on these cookies (do not overbake--they do not appear golden brown but if you bake too long they will be hard).  One great thing about this recipe is that the frosting amount is perfect for the cookies.  Normally I end up with a half a bowl of frosting left over!!

I loved this recipe and the cookies tasted great! With so little liquid initially and so much flour, the dough looked like finely crushed graham cracker.  Then adding milk, a little at a time, got the dough to a consistancy I liked.  Sort of clay-like, somewhat stiff.  It was super easy to roll, GREAT for cutouts. I loved the idea to use wax paper under and on top.  The cookies cooked up perfectly.  The kids and I like soft cookies, while hubby likes more crunch.  We timed baking accordingly and was great both ways.  Yes, it's not that sweet - but that's what makes this an awesome icing cookie.  You don't get bowled over by the sweetness.  AND it's not as hi fat as other cookies.  A keeper?  You bet!!

I have made these cookies numerous times. I love that they are a little crispy around the edges, but stay soft due to the brown sugar. They keep their shape, which has been my problem in the past. I do not add any egg as other reviews mentioned, but I have had to add more milk and I substitute almond extract for the vanilla.  Everybody compliments these cookies!

I heavily rely on the reviews on this website.  Usually they are pretty accurate.  These are not!  the only alteration I made were adding the egg and uping the vanilla to 1 T.  These cookies were horrible.  They rolled out nicely, but the bake time was completely off, and they stuck to my pan. I will not be trying them again.  It was a lot of work and ingredients for poor results!

This was one of the worst recipes I have ever used! I had to throw all of the cookies away and I wasted a lot of time. They were extremely dry and the only time they were decent is when they came right out of the oven. If your recipe needs more stuff in it make sure you put it in. They also had no taste. It was like trying to eat cardboard.

My family loves this recipe! I make these cookies for every holiday. I did have to add more milk and an egg for the dough to form but it was well worth it. The icing is wonderful and enhances the taste of the cookie even more. These cookies always come out very soft and scrumptious.

This was the worst cookie recipe I've ever tried. It quickly became obvious that it needed a lot more wet ingredients and a lot less flour. I followed the recipe precisely and it never formed into workable dough. I added more milk and an egg and it still did not ever look like dough. I chilled it thinking maybe it would help but it didn't. I could not make cut out cookies because the dough was not right. I tried to make drop cookies and ended up feeding the results to the dogs. When I scraped dried on cookies off my pan, the center was literally dry powder. I have no idea how the others successfully used this recipe.

This recipe was GREAT..  I just had to add extra milk, but it's the best.  I used this recipe for our family christmas cut out cookies this year, and everyone loved them.  It's nice that this recipe doesn't call for eggs.   I will be using this recipe all the time.

These cookies are really good.  I did add almost a cup of milk in order for the dough to form properly.

I always have a problem with sugar cookies: When I cut them and place them in the oven: They spread!!! It seems like if they're melting and loose the form! 
 What am I doing wrong?
 I love them, love their taste and love to make them. But I dont know why do they spread like that. 
 Please Help Me!!!!

I've been using this recipe for several years now, I'll never try another sugar cookie recipe! As others suggest I do add one egg and since I live at a higher altitude and dry climate, in addition to reducing the flour by 1/2 cup, I increase the milk to 1/2 cup. One other thing I think helps maintain the softness is I replace the butter with butter-flavored crisco. I do the same thing with my chocolate chip cookies and I think helps keep them soft. Thank you for sharing!

WOW, I have to say that I am really disappointed in this recipe :(  I added an egg and a little bit of milk just like the other review said because it was way to much flour to blend properly.  I then spent time rolling and cutting out the cookies and baking them.  After baking 3 trays, I tried one..., very bland, no flavor.

Had to add extra milk, but they turned out great. A big hit. :) I didn't have cookie cutters or a rolling pin, but I improvised with cleverly used cups and they turned out great. :) The icing seems to have different consistency each time I make it, though....

This is an okay recipe.  Definately needed more milk, but with a lot of handling, and some flour these cookies actually rolled out pretty easily.  I wish I had added an egg.  They look a little funny and have a strange texture when done, but are ok tasting.  I think I will be finding a different receipe for next year.

Great taste & easy, but I too had to add an egg and I found these cookies too soft for cut out cookies. When I would pick up my cookie it would break. maybe it would work better for small cookies.
