I have been making a very similar adaptation of this for the past couple of years (since I first discovered the Sweetie Pie's recipe). It is always a hit, wherever it is devoured. It is very rich and cheesy. Just about any variety / combination of the Cheddar, Colby-Jack and other similar cheeses will yield favorable results. I also broil the last few minutes on low (but watch it CAREFULLY) for that golden brown finish. t is definitely worth the effort to indulge in this cheese-lover's delight!

I made half the recipe and I still had a ton of mac n' cheese.  My daughter and I thought it was excellent, my husband not so much.  Just proves the point, you can't please everyone.  I stirred in the cheese for a dish with cheesy deliciousness.

I made a double batch for a men's event a church, they loved it. The only problem is I have to make for every event.

My family loved this! It was the first time I ever made mac-n-cheese, and it was very easy. It's going to be a favorite :) I left out the sugar, and poured only 2/3 the mixture on top of the cheese, rearranged the cheese pieces so it covered all the noodles then slowly poured the rest of the liquid over the cheese. I will definitely make this again!
