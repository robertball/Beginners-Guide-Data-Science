I didn’t have the Carmel it wanted, so my sauce wasn’t right (I used vanilla instead) and I thought it tasted better without it.  With that said, I started off trying to do what she said and put it in my air fryer, maybe I’m just not talented enough or my air fryer isn’t large enough, so I gave up and cooked in my oven.  Tastes great, very filling, I’ll make it again, but definitely skipping the air fryer!

Neither my husband nor I cared for this at all.  I just got my air fryer so maybe I'm just not used to it yet.  The taste was off--maybe too much flour and not enough apple, but I followed the recipe as written.  Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

I added a little more milk because the dough was too stiff and used less sugar. I will make it again.

Liquid to dry ratio wAs way off even for an airfrier. I added more milk but it just wasn't the right consistency for fritters. Will not make again.
