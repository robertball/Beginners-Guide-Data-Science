4.6.19  I had a half bag of fresh cranberries in the fridge, so this was a great way to use them up.  I use sugar substitutes such as Splenda® and Truvia®, and this tasted just as good as the sugar-laden versions of most cranberry sauces (most of them are waaaaay too sweet for me).  Didn’t measure, just eyeballed ingredients, and adjusted to my taste.  I liked it!
