Recipe is tasty, but quite tart.  The trick is to fill your cup completely with ice, then add the cheery limeade. As the ice melts it becomes less and less tart.

This reminds me of the cherry limeade's I just have to have from Sonic only better because I don't add as much ice and I can add two cherries.  I mixed this together and let it sit for about 30 minutes prior to serving...served it with tacos...yummy!

Very tart and refreshing.  Was too sweet / tart for multiple glasses on hot summer day.  Next time, I'll add the suggested 2nd bottle of lemon lime soda to make it more drinkable when you want more than one glass.  
Everyone at the picnic loved this.

Everyone RAVED about this beverage at a recent family gathering. The original recipe is very tart. I didn't have an extra bottle of lime-soda so I used a 12oz can of Welch's Grape-Apple-Cherry Cocktail to the mixture.

When we were on vacation we had these at Sonic.  They were great! We don't have sonic here up North so this was a real treat.  I used Sierra Mist for the lemon-lime soda but will try Sprite next time.  The Sierra Mist changed the flavor I think.  This was a real hit with the family!

I loved the color as well as the taste of this. Thought my kids would go nuts over it but they didn't care for it. Said it was way too sweet. Another said way too tart. That's what I liked about it. Plan to serve this at a party.

I made this recipe for a summer BBQ and my guests loved it!  It has been a request ever since.  It is as good, if not better, than Sonic's Limeaid.  Big Hit!!

Excellent and refreshing! This was just the right combination of sweet and tart. I believe I may cut down on the sweet part next time by using 1/2 Club Soda and 1/2 Lemon-Lime.Pretty presentation, too. This non-alcoholic drink is going into our favorites file. Thanks Cindy M!

This was fantastic.  Very easy, to.  I did not find it too tart at all, I actually aded more lime to increase the tartness.  Was a smash hit at a friends party.  Many people suggested it wouldbe great spiked with vodka or white wine.  Thank you.

This was wonderful!  I had to make 3- 2 liter pitchers one weekend for all my friends and family.  The color is pink so I added a little red food coloring to a batch and my family preferred it over crushed ice.  Remember, this is a tart recipe but does dilute as the ice melts.

Great recipe! However, for those of us who cant fit a whole 2 liter into a pitcher, I used 1 can of frozen limeade concentrate with almost all of the 2 liter with a little over half of the cherry juice and it came out amazing! Not too sweet and not to tart at all!

It's much easier and tastes better to serve sprite with fresh lime wedges squeezed in, and grenadine mixed in. Grenadine is the red syrup that is used to make cherry cokes or shirley temples.  You can find it in grocery or liquor stores.  If you want to you can garnish with cherries and add a little cherry juice as well.

This was a big hit the first time I made it and I am making it again now three weeks later for an open house. I am not going to use so many cherries this time. I found that more people do not maraschino cherries so you really only need them for color and maybe a little flavor.  Using them in the ice cubes is very colorful. It's true that you run out quickly with this.

This is a great starter recipe. I mixed 1 can frozen limeade and 1 bottle of lemon lime soda and it was perfect to me. I think if I would have added the other can of limeade it would have been unbearably tart.

kid loved it...better/more lime than the Sonic version. I used Key Lime juice. Only problem with as written is that it makes enought for a crowd. I only want 1 serving at a time...so I mixed up everything except the soda in a jar. I use 1/4c of mix to a 12 oz can of sprite 1 at a time to make "single serve" size.

I have sour/tart tastebuds so I loved the recipe and actually used a little less than 2 liters of Sprite. My husband mixed it with vodka for an awesome cocktail and almost drank the whole pitcher! I also added a little grenadine to the pitcher.

This is a great summer time drink.  We have friends over and we make a pitcher or two of this every time (one for the kids and one for the adults).  Also good with Rum or Vodka added.

I love this recipe! However, I am not in love with high fructose corn syrup, which is the number one ingredient in all the limeade concentrate. Wish there was a way to make this with lower sugar.

This is a wonderful recipe.  If you would like to add alcohol, Cherry Vodka is fabulous with this concoction.  You can actually save your cherry juice if you want.

Four stars as written. Five stars with the extra bottle of lemon-lime soda. Pretty tart otherwise. Just be prepared with an extra bottle of soda, or you might be disappointed. To our family, it was perfect with two. Will definitely make again...yummy!

For some reason it tasted better the next day. It was really good, but pretty tart. Maybe it was because I used a cheap store-brand limeade.

I halfed the recipe, and I used the minute maid limeade and it was awesome! Great way to use up all the opened pop bottles after new years, I had some half flat sprite and it worked great. I added half the jar of cherry juice but I threw the cherries in too!

This was very good cherry limeade. Tasted just like my favorite drink from Sonic. I read some of the reviews that said it was too tart, so I bought three 6oz cans of limeade to make it 18oz instead of 24oz. I thought this was the perfect combination of sweet and tart. I also tried it with a little vodka to make it a fruity cocktail, and it was delicious, but dangerous. I will definitely make this again.

~~~ This is incredible Cindy!  .. I had to laugh at a couple of the comments that knocked it down a star citing "it was "tart"..   They need to go back and read the first two words you used to describe it...LOL!!      I found it tart, sweet, refreshing, delicious... PERFECT!   :o)

I found this recipe looking for something fruity to mix with vodka... THIS NAILED IT! Definately a keeper, and I like the flexability of the tartness.

Okay, for starters:  This is WAY better than Sonic's watered down junk!  But, you do have to play with it to perfect it to your own tastes.  I used 2 - 12 oz Limeade concentrates, 2 - 10 oz maraschino cherry jars (juice only), 1 1/2 - 2 Ltrs of Sprite.  I cut up two whole limes into slices and floated them, squeezed all four "butts" into the bowl for extra limey goodness.  So good! (Actually had to make a second batch of it, during the party!)  **This is also amazing with some vodka in it!**

As is I think this recipe would be way too tart, I used only one can of frozen limeade mix and 2 liter of sprite and it was still plenty tart. If I make again I will use 4 liters of sprite per can. Having worked at Sonic I know how they make their limeade and this similar but way off at the same time.  I made this as a fun drink for my daughter's "Dora" themed birthday party, like a fake margarita. I got comments that it was good but very tart.

Usually I make these kinds of drinks for my kids, but this one was all mine today.  I made my own limeade and used that instead of the concentrate.  I just added in some diet lemon-lims soda, some maraschino cherry juice, and topped it with some cherries and a slice of lime.  I loved this and plan on making it again with the limeade.

This was alright, but it was very tart.  When I tried to compensate with the extra soda it felt very sweet.  It would be difficult to drink a lot of this.  Not bad if you like tart drinks.

Very refreshing drink.  Didn't change a single thing perfect as is.  ONly problem I had was I didn't have a pitcher large enough to hold the entire batch.  Had to store some in tupperware:)  This is going to be a regular summer drink at our house.

Way too tart.  Try adding one frozen limeade concentrate and adding 1/4 cup of grenadine to the mixture.  It will be more like a cherry limeade because as is, this recipe is more of a limeade with a hint of cherry.  Thanks for sharing!

My cheapo version is like yours execpt to cut it but add less cherries (theyre expensive) I started out with cherry type jello with the sugar, about 1 cup boiling water, added the limeade frozen 1 can of cold water, then ice cubes about 1 cup and lemon lime soda, to fill pitcher. Made in gallon pitcher...Also for the bad girl in me I added 1 1/2 shots of citrus vodka at the glass... stir.  great either way, and the jello reduces the tartness...and cost.

Just made this--it's really, really good. To cut the tartness, I used just 1 can of concentrate but kept the rest the same. It's good as written too, but mostly as a base for alcoholic beverages :-)

This was a big hit with the kids and adults alike!  Very tasty and refreshing.  I did add a little extra soda to soothe the limeade concentrate, like maybe a cup more.  The second time I also added some extra cherry flavor (just for my personal taste preference).  Used the flavor syrup I had in the cupboard for snow cones.  Worked great and only needed a splash of it.  Thanks!

Love this.  I halve the recipe, and that makes about one full pitcher.  Also, you can add more soda to temper the tartness.

She's not kidding. This is tart! I liked it. I'm trying to recreate Sonic's version, and this isn't it but it's good. I'd do it again. Pretty pink color. Good for a girl baby shower.

This was perfect! I made this for a friend's last minute birthday party and everyone loved it. 
I have been craving Sonic for a long time and this was just like a cherry limeade you would buy there. 
This is definately a keeper.

This was so easy, and really, really refreshing on a hot day.  I did not think it was at all too tangy and everyone who tried it enjoyed it.

This was so good. It's great mixed with Malibu Rum.I put the sliced lime and cherries in it instead of garnishing the glasses.

I love this! I read the reviews and saw that everyone thought it was a little too tart, so I used 10oz cans instead of 12oz. Also, I mixed in about a tsp of vanilla flavoring syrup to one glass.. Delicious! I will most definitely be making this lots over the summer!

I only gave this 4 stars because I changed the method of making.  I spoon in 2-3 TB of thawed limeade concentrate into a glass, add in 7-Up soda and 2 TB of the maraschino cherry juice, stir well, then add ice, a cherry or two, and a slice of lime. This way you can make it more or less tart to suit your taste. Very refreshing!

I really liked this, but I can't say I followed it exactly.  My roommate bought a HUGE jar of maraschino cherries and hates them so I told her I would find a way to get rid of them.  I secretly had this in mind but hadn't had a chance to make it and had a girls get together tonight...perfect!  I didn't know exactly how much of the cherry juice to add so just went until it tasted right!  Even the cherry-hating roomie had a second glass :).  Next time I will measure the juice as I add and make a note of it.  I will make this again with the rest of the HUGE jar of cherries!

The whole family really enjoyed this drink.  I have added both rum and vodka to it to make an adult drink.  This will make a great summer sipper.

Very close to Sonic - just missing a little carbonation.  I thought the tartness was just right!  If your ice maker crushes ice, use that as it makes it seem more like the real thing!

Very, very nice! I usually make it by the glass, as opposed to by the pitcher. I don't even measure the ingredients really. Just basically a heaping tablespoon full of the frozen limeade concentrate, half to three quarters of a glass of lemon-lime carbonated beverage (I use Seven Up) and maybe a few tablespoons of the maraschino cherry juice. If I have fresh limes and maraschino cherries, I'll add that to the drink as an accent, but if not, it's still great. Thanks for posting this!

The way to make this PERFECT is to add cherry grenadine to the drink instead of the marachino cherry juice.  Add to each individual glass if you like.  Just a drop goes a long way.  Makes this sweet and perfect!!!

This was pretty darn good and close to the Sonic Limeade.  There is an disagreement going on in the house right now though on too tart or too sweet.  Not quite sure, but certainly something we will make again.

Cherry Limeade is one of my mom's favorites whenever we visited family in Tennessee (we don't have a Sonic here) I made this recipe for her when I had her over for dinner on Sunday. She loved it as did everyone else! Thank you so much for sharing, it is a bit tart but as another review noted it does get less tart as the ice melts in your glass.

I modified it a little added to cans of water to the limeade and added sprite when needed, it did this so I won't have to worry about the drink being flat the next day.

Made this for a cookout and everyone loved it. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was b/c we found it a bit strong/sweet so added some water. Must drink this after making; it won't keep long b/c of the carbonation.

I did not know what this was supposed to taste like but it was pretty good! I only wanted enough for 2 ppl so here's what I did: in my blender I added 2 cans Sprite, 1 mini container of frozen limeade, and about 1/4 jar of cherry juice, along w/ 2 cups of ice and blended. It was very good. I'm going to go by Sonic and see what there's is like and then maybe tweak the recipe a little. It would make a good punch for a party.

This was way too tart so I added in another bottle of lemon lime soda and used 2 jars of maraschino cherries instead of 1. ( I actually used diet 7-up)  OMGosh!!  It is so good!!  I made it at a baby shower and then at my mother's 76th birthday party.  I actually ran out of it!!  I'll definitely be making it at all of my gatherings!  Thank you Cindy77 for sharing your recipe!!

This was good but much more tart than what I would consider cherry limeade. I personally liked it this way but the kids preferred it to be sweeter. The second time I made it, I used two jars of cherries including the cherries. The kids loved it and came back for more.

I've made this a couple times after a coworker made it for a staff party. It is SO good! I use the original recipe for the kids and work. I tried it with coconut rum as an "adult bev" and it was amazing! I'd consider adding some plain soda water to cut the sweetness.

Loved this recipe, so easy, easy to make in big batches for pool parties, etc.  The kids loved it served as is.... the adults loved it with a little vodka added in...if you are a lime martini lover you will love it.  Enjoy.

I loved this, it was great for a hot summer day.  My kids thought it was to tart though.  Next time I will add a bit more of the soda.

Super easy.  I tried this using one can of frozen limeade instead of two.  The result is a mild taste-- I bet kids would like it best this way, since it's almost like zippy cherry sprite more than full-on limeade.  Might be a good solution for people who don't care for the tartness.  I like it, but I also like strong cherry limeade, so I'll edit my review when I try it with two cans.

I made this recipe, but was thrown off my the tart taste. If you are making this, add alittle bite of water to settle down the tart taste.

This was delicious. I used one can of limeade and I added half the jar of cherries to the mixture. I did not have a lime. It was delicious. I followed someone else's advice and let it sit for a half an hour before serving. Remember to stir when serving, all the sweet goodness falls to the bottom

Everyone raves about this every time I make it!  I have found that diet soda can be easily substituted and no one notices.

GREAT!!  We served this punch/limeade at a gathering of 12 people on a warm day changing from summer to fall and almost everyone went back for THIRDS!!!  We followed the recipe almost exactly except that we doubled it.  If you are going to double the amount of the beverage to cut the tart like some readers suggested, don't forget to double the amount of maraschino cherries so that the cherry flavor will balance out in the end with the lime.  We will definitely serve this again and received many compliments on it.  Thank you for sharing!
