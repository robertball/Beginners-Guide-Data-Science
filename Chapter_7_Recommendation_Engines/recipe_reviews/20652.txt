I made this recipe for a "Zuccini Fest" our church put together.  It went overall incredibly well and was so quick and easy to make.  You literally just throw all the ingredients together and bake! My husband who hates zucchini even found himself going back for seconds!  Yummy!

Well done Northernlights! I will make this again and again!  The next time I am going to bake it in a mini- muffin pan for easy munching. Ps.  I was out of Bisquick so I went back to the basics and used this biscuit recipe instead of the Bisquick.   "Bisquick" Substitute  Yield: 1 cup  1 cup flour 1-1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon shortening  Combine all ingredients and use as a substitution for Bisquick

I have made this receipe several times with rave reviews and many requests for the recipe.  For those who have commented on the sogginess - zucchini can vary greatly as to its moisture content; therefore you have to adjust your baking time accordingly. It is best if it is let to set at least 15 minutes before serving.  It is also very good cold or reheated in the microwave.  The garlic can very easily be adjusted more or less as to your taste.  I love it just the way it is written.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This went over really well as an appetizer at my son's 2nd birthday party. As suggested by several other reviewers, I used a bit less garlic than the original recipe calls for (3 cloves instead of 4), and I used 2 full cups of Bisquik as opposed to 1 3/4. I might even used 2 1/2 next time, as it was definitely still more quiche-y than biscuit-y, as others have mentioned. Other slight variations I made were: I cooked at 425 for about 40 minutes, adding some sprinkled cheese to the top for the last 5 minutes of cooking, used dried chives in place of the parsley (I didn't have any on hand and thought the chives would spice it up a bit), used 3 eggs instead of 4, and I also added 2 tsps of paprika. It browned up spectacularly, smelled amazing, and disappeared completely once it was cut. I used my food processor to chop all the onion and zucchini which made this dish even easier to prep. :) Thanks, I'll definitely make this one again.

I served this as a side dish for dinner.  Full of flavor, nice texture.  I used a cup extra zucchini and cooked it 10 minutes longer.  Make sure the top is browned, and let set 5-10 minutes to firm up. The flavor is even better the next day reheated in the microwave.  The recipe makes it easy use up the zucchini harvest.

Very tasty way to prepare one of my favorite vegetables!  The combination of garlic and sharp cheddar cheese made for great flavor.  My husband did not like it, which is unusual, because he loves zucchini, as well.  However, this is my review, not his, and I LOVED this recipe!

I love this it's really good.  Like a previous reviewer said its not like a biscuit more like a quiche.  Reminds me of Red Lobster cheddar bay biscuits.  Have fixed several times and will fix again.

Great side dish, very easy.  It reminded me of a mixture between quiche and stuffing (not a biscuit like the description says) but this was fine.  I cooked it for a little over 30 minutes and thought it was still underdone when I cut into it, but you need to let it cool considerably to set up.  Once it had cooled more, it was fine, and ended up very moist.  Might try adding more cheese to the top a few minutes before it's finished cooking since the husband and I love cheese so much, but other than that it was great as-is!

I have made these little bites twice now as an appetizer for different crowds and they are now a certified hit! Many people have asked for the recipe and I am happy to share it!  I followed the recipe exactly and used fresh zucchini both times. They are just as good at room temp as they are still warm.

Excellent!  I served it as a main dish topped with pasta sauce for my family.  Nice change from pasta, and a great place to sneak in veggies for the kids.  I used half zucchini and half carrot.

Great recipe! It's very good as its, but coming from the south, I think everything is better with bacon added! Crumble fry about six strips of bacon and add to this recipe and...yumm-yumm! :D

This is an awesome recipe, very tasty. I would like to know how I could make it a little less moist and more bread like. Everyone called it a quiche. I did not have Parmesan so used Romano . I love this site!!

This was delicious!  I made it as-written.  It is casserole-y enough to eat as a meal.  I would like to try it next time with some chopped tomatoes or roasted red peppers.

Very good appetizer and it went over very well at the beach party today! I had doubled this recipe and made 2 at once so I would have one for another party tomorrow! Gotta love long holiday weekends! The only change I made to this recipe was to up the biscuit mix to 2c and I'm glad I did. I think it would have been a little too loose to use as finger food. Aloha!

This is very tasty, and easy to make.  I agree with another reviewer who thought it was bland.  It would benefit from some crushed red pepper flakes, I think.  I baked it in a cookie sheet, which made it exactly the right thickness for my hors d'oevres.

Very good recipe.  I cooked the dish in a jelly roll pan which worked well.  The insides were still a little mushy, so the next day, I browned the cut squares on a vented pizza pan and that worked well to crisp them a bit and make them more appetizer-ish.  Next time I would use less eggs and more garlic.  FYI - 2 zucchinis made the right amount (4 cups grated).

Made a double order of this the other day for my sisters birthday party. Everyone loved it! Will definately make this again. Next time I may let the zucchini drain a bit first to make this a bit more "finger foodish" than "Quiche".

I really wanted to try this but i ran out of zucchini and made it with brocoli. It was delicious. I think squash would go good with it too. Still gotta try it with zucchini.

I wasn't a huge fan of this recipe. I followed the instructions closely but the consistency of the final product was very unappealing, as it had the texture of soupy quiche.  the taste was somewhat non-offensive but the other flavors weren't helping the zucchini's flavor seem cohesive. Although I like all the ingredients separately, I felt there were too many strong flavors competing for the crown in this particular recipe. Perhaps the amounts of garlic, onion and parsley should be lessened? I think if I were to attempt making it again I would instead choose to use grated potato in place of the zucchini; as the potato would be a more subtle flavor and would mingle more suitably with the others.

I agree with other reviews that is the texture of a breakfast casserole.  But it is a great appetizer when you serve it with a spaghetti sauce to dip. I cut back on the garlic, only used 3 cloves and I used 2 cups of bisquit mix, laid my shredded zucchini on paper towel to help control the moisture. I used Kraft Italian 5 cheese and added basil too. 
You could add so many different things to this recipe and it would be delicious.

I didn’t have enough zucchini so I used a mixture of yellow squash and zucchini and it was older so I didn’t have to worry about excess moisture. I used 2 cups of baking mix and the parmesan cheese was grated not the kind in a shaker. I didn’t have sharp cheddar so I used mild cheddar. Another person mentioned that you can only use vegetable oil or it will be too greasy but I used canola and it worked well; no issues. I only had 2 T. of dried parsley and I added 2 tsp. paprika. At 25 minutes, it was gooey so I cooked it an additional ten minutes, a total of 35 minutes and it was more bread-like but not firm enough to pick up as an appetizer. I used PAM to grease the metal baking dish; I think butter would make it greasy. I served it alone or with spaghetti sauce.  Perhaps it would make a better appetizer if it was cooked in a mini tart pan? Overall, it was a very good recipe.

This is yummy! I just made a half sized batch so I could bake it in my toaster oven (8X8 pan) so as not to heat up the house. I grated the zucchini and half the onion, mincing the rest, sprinkled the mixture lightly with salt, let it rest for a half an hour, then squeezed it as dry as I could  in cheesecloth (you'd be surprised hour much liquid come out-I know I was). I upped the baking mix to 1 cup, decreased the salt to a pinch (because the veg had already been salted), and it came out great! I cut it into small (about 1-1/2")  squares, and stuck them with toothpicks to make little bites (about 36). It should be perfect for the potluck function I'm about to attend, because certainly most people won't want to eat huge portions in this heat. I think the key to making them solid enough to stick on a pick is draining the veg. I just tried another one (oh, darn, I just had to do it) to be sure they'd lift from the pan easily without falling apart, and they're 
perfect.

I really loved this recipe. It was simple and tasty. I grate donly about 3 cups of zucchini because I am not a huge zucchini fan. It came out amazing. Evenmy picky brother who eats very little liked it.

Used egg beaters and only 1/3 c. oil and it turned out great.  I did bake for 40 minutes - probably due to water content of zucchini.  Used 1/4 sharp cheese and the rest colby jack since it was what i had + the parm.  Very tasty.

okay but a little dry & bland. I'll have to try it again, and change it up a bit. This dish did get great reviews when I served it though (I'm my toughest critic!)

I didn't have enough zucchini so I only used 2 cups. I chopped them in a chopper and drained the excess liquid. I only used 2 eggs hoping to make it less "quiche" like. Make sure you don't substitute a different kind of oil, I had to use canola oil and it came out way too greasy. But I thought it tasted great! So easy!

It was delicious!  The smell was so pungent when I was mixing it, I was afraid it would be too garlicky, but it was delicious!  I didn't add parsley because I didn't have any, but otherwise, I followed it to the "t".  It is very, very savory, and I used it as a side dish.  I should have halved the recipe because It was just for my small family.  There's a lot left over.

I was humored that the reviews were so inconsistent.  Some said it was bland, others said it had too many competing flavors...  So I had to give it a shot.  I made it pretty much according to recipe, but I only made a half-batch.  The only changes I made were using gluten free biscuit mix and accidentally adding a little too much parmesan (about an extra tablespoon or so).

Even though it was only half, I still needed to cook it about 25 minutes, so I suspect a full recipe would have taken longer than stated in my oven.  Also, I let it set up for a couple hours before cutting it since I wanted to take it to a potluck anyway.  It held its shape well, and I was pleased with both the look and the taste.

I wasn't blown away though, and I don't know if I'd make it again, but there's nothing wrong with it.

I added some fresh basil to the food processor that had 1 onion and a few cloves of garlic. I also used an Italian blend of cheeses instead of cheddar. My husband and I loved this, kids didn't. Great side dish.

I made this exactly as written and found it to be delicious.  As I was making it I was wondering if I was to use the powder in a can parmesan, or the shredded from a bag parmesan.  I decided that grated meant the powdery,(grated), cheese.  I sprinkled about 1/2 c. of shredded sharp cheddar on top, just for visual appeal.  This was one of the first dishes to be empty at the potluck I took it to, and I didn't notice any of it going in the garbage!  I will make this again.

Absolutely amazing.  Make sure you press all the water out of the zuchinni before you cook it- even shredding it and letting it sit overnight before you cook will work.  We used a couple extra cloves of garlic (personal preference) and a little extra cheddar cheese and we make it again and again as an appetizer for parties!!

I took this to a Christmas party, and everyone loved it, including me! I cut down the amount of onion a little, and sprinkled cheddar cheese on top of it after it came out of the oven. Mmmm yes, I agree with the others, it's like a zucchini quiche.

I thought I had all the ingredients but turns out I  had monterey jack cheese (instead of sharp cheddar) and Pancake/waffle mix (instead of biscuit mix). I took a chance and made it anyway. They turned out fine. Possibley more cake-like then they were supposed to be. I also used my food processor to shred the zucchini instead of grating it. I think it would have been a more wet finished product had I grated it. They turned out great though. In fact, my 18 year old son had about 5 bars with dinner (served them with spaghetti). Next time I will make sure I have the right cheese and biscuit mix to see how they might differ. All in all, great new recipe to add to my repituar.

Amazing and easy! Halved recipe for 9x9. Browned up well.  Omitted oregano as I wanted the garlic and cheese tastes to be dominant.  So good! I did sautée the garlic a bit before adding per one reviewers suggestion. Wanted to soften onion. These are great and taste good at room temp or warm. Highly recommend, although my garlic breathe is dreadful I'm sure. Ha ha. Thanks to the recipe author. Will definitely make again! And soon!

I used summer squash instead of zucchini and it came out tasting like a moist cornbread, so yummy! Ate half the tray myself (I am 5 months pregnant). The best use of summer squash I have found yet. Most important to brown the top before done cooking, even if you have to leave in oven a bit longer. Easy to reheat or eat cold.

I loved this recipe! Mine had almost a souffle texture. Very flavorful and delicious. I only used 3 garlic cloves and that was enough but for those extreme garlic lovers, 4 cloves is no problem. Definitely a keeper! :D

Outstanding!  Well seasoned and and a nice, quick, easy side dish.  Re-heat in oven ( 350 deg for about 5-10 min.) microwave does not do it justice.  Believe it or not, tastes great with applesauce.

Wow this was delicious. My boyfriend hates zucchini, but he will try one bite of anything I make. He actually said it was very good and had two servings. It is very simple but flavorful. I would give it a five star rating but I think a little more seasoning would be good, possibly chunks of cooked bell pepper or jalepeno would be nice or couple dashes of hot sauce or peper. Overall very good!

This was a good appetizer ... must remember to cut into "small" pieces as it can be quite filling.  It also makes a good side dish instead of serving bread!

A very easy recipe and everyone loved it!  I'll make it again and again.  I did use shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated, low fat bisquick and egg beaters to help with the caloric intake.

I love this recipe and you will too! Makes the house smell wonderful, uses lots of zucchini and just as good cold. I did add jalapenos because we like hot n spicy in our family.

I was looking forward to this recipe based on the reviews, but after trying it I wasn't impressed.  It definitely needed to cook longer than the instructions, and I found the cheese/onion/garlic flavors to be overpowering.  Between my husband and myself we have eaten approximately 1/6 of the pan, and will likely not eat the rest :(

Good1  My only complaint is (and I can't believe I love garlic but this was overpowering.  Will probably make again with just one clove of garlic.

This turned out much better than I thought it would. I scaled it to 9 servings, and thought it was a little too wet and sloppy, so I added a bit more Bisquick. I  agree with the reviewers who suggested servings this with a tomato or spagetti sauce - I think the flavors would go together really well. Thanks, Northernlights!

Very good and very rich flavor.  I used egg beaters instead real eggs and you couldn't even tell.  Next time I may add a little less zucchini (or more bisquick) just to make it a tad firmer.

Liked this one!  I agree, don't panic that it is undercooked.  It needs to set for a bit before you cut into it.  At the party several guests asked for the recipe.

Great hit! Everybody wanted the recipe . I did cook it longer to get it more crispy at the bottom , the bottom was mushy after 30 min . I also used 2 dishes , one 9x13 and one 8x8 for that amount so they wouldn't be so thick.It came out perfect.

Definitely take plenty of time to pat the zucchini dry! I increased the cheese by 1/4 - 1/2 cup and added some parmesan on the top.  I increased the salt and added a lilttle black pepper. I chose to make in mini muffin size  to take to a potluck-appetizer event.  Much easier to serve!

it was a hit at our gathering. I used dried basil instead of parsley. Followed a suggestion of another reviewer and only used 3 cloves of garlic. Also followed another suggestion and put more cheese on top 10 minutes before it was due to come out of the oven. Yumm.

I used a small onion, and that was just right. I also put about half a tablespoon into mini muffin tins (sprayed with pam), and cook for 15-20 minutes instead. You get about 7 dozen (84) little appetizers that way. They were great!  The kids like them as a snack.  Making them again today.  I froze them, and then warmed them up in the microwave as a snack for the kids, they were really good then too.

I made this tonight for a potluck for my hiking group.  As the reviews I read were mostly very favorable, I  was confident to bring something I had never made before.  It turned out great!  I didn't change any of the ingredients or amounts.  I did, however, saute the onions, garlic and spices and then let them cool.  I put the grated zucchini between a couple of layers of paper towel and blotted out some of the moisture.  When it was done and cooled the texture was great.  It was moist but firm enough to be a finger food.

Very tasty! I have an abundance of zuchinni in my garden this year, and was looking for a way to use it. This is definitely a keeper. I substituted red bell peppers from the garden for the onion, and also added some sweet basil. Everyone thought it was good.

These were okay. A bit plain. I agree they are sort of like quiche squares. I am going to take the leftovers and top with spaghetti sauce as suggested by another. I wont make this again however.

SO GOOD IT'S DANGEROUS! I had to alter a bit because I live in India and cheeses called for are imported (VERY COSTLY), so I subbed a local hard cheese, added a little red chili powder for zip.  WONDERFUL!  WILL MAKE AGAIN

I took the advice from previuos reviews and added more biscuit mix. I also added extra sharp cheddar because I love cheese! The texture was pretty good. It was more like a quiche.

Good taste, softer texture than I was expecting.  Not crispy.

Very good.  I had a couple comments that there was too much garlic so I will cut back when I make it again.  Otherwise, very good.  Agree with previous comment regarding serving with spaghetti sauce.  I used sauce for dipping.

This appetizer was easy and tasty but you really need to let it cool for at least one hour so it sets.  I followed the recipe exactly and let it cool for 1/2 hour and had to eat it with a fork but it was still good.  I will make it again.

This recipe was horrible.  I made it for a dinner party and was very dissapointed.  It was soggy and has too much garlic (if there is such a thing!)  I love all vegetable but the zucchini just didn't cook enough no matter how long I cooked it.

These are excellent - so flavorful and easy.  I make them a little bigger and serve them along with soup in the winter.  Good way to get a green veggie in your kids.
