I used a mild basil variety and orange mint mixture.  BTW, a "BUNCH" is equal to a cup and a half.  I looked it up once when using cilantro, and was glad I did!

Not bad.  I'm wanting a bit more taste--either from the lemon or tea.  It tastes a bit like flavored water, so I think I'd add a tea bag or two next time.  It also isn't that minty, but 2 bunches of mint is a vague measurement.  Not sure what the recipe submitter really meant, so I looked it up.  A small bunch is about .5 oz (which is what I used), a larger bunch is 1 oz.  Perhaps what was meant was a large bunch?  At any rate, I made the Mint Ice Cubes on here (recipe by Skuba) and added it to my glass of tea. Although it took them a while to melt, once they did, it is a mint explosion!  thanks for the recipe.

This was easy and a nice way to use my mint plant. I found it very refreshing over some ice. Another person thought it maybe didn't have a strong enough flavor, but I thought it worked well as a light, refreshing drink.

This is an old Amish recipe for iced tea.  They call it Meadow tea.  I rustic camp near several Amish families in Ontario, Canada.  The mint they are referring to in the recipe is what they use as a tea base.  A little common sense used and you might know that.  After all, tea leaves are from plants!
Anyway, this is a very easy, refreshing tea and great on a hot summer's day.  Enjoy!

I am wondering if they forgot to mention the tea bags!  I put in the usual 10 bags into my sun tea container and then added the ingredients.  Very yummy!

I would have preferred a stronger flavour; possibly it was faint because it wasn't sunny, and possibly I didn't use enough mint. I'll make it again soon and see.

I put two lipton tea bags in it as well. It still had a light flavor, but delicious. I tried a couple of limes instead of lemon (because that is what I had on hand) and I'm now calling it a Sun-brewed Mint Limeade. haha

Great with any type of edible mint.  I like to use lemon balm, which is related to mint.  Great as sun tea or brewed.
