As written this recipe only deserves a weak three stars because if one was to include the 1/4 cup milk called for it would be much too thin. Thanks to previous reviewers, I didn't include any milk at all. However, there is another problem - the two teaspoons of vanilla turns this an unpleasant dingy shade of off brownish-white.  Fine if you're tinting your frosting, undesirable if you're not. In hindsight I'd say use no vanilla at all or at most 1 tsp., use imitation clear vanilla, or almond extract, which is clear. Finally, while the flavor was nice, I wasn't totally pleased with the texture, probably because of the flour. I wasn't nearly as pleased with this recipe as I've been with others from this site.

This frosting was VERY good! Less sweet than most frostings and light. To fix the problem of the frosting being too runny, like other reviewers mentioned, I just left out the milk. There really is no need for it. Perfect spreading consistancy and I was also able to decorate w/ it for borders and piping scroll work. This is a lightly crusting recipe also. Be sure to refrigerate your cake with this as it has raw egg whites in it. Highly recommended. :)

I used this on an angel food cake and it was perfect!  It was a little bit runny and I didn't have time to cool it so I just added another tablespoon of flour.  I made it a second time and added a couple tablespoons of coco and no extra four and it was perfect thickness and taste after an hour in the fridge,  I'll definitely be using this recipe lots!

What wonderful frosting! I love the little bit of salt in it, it gives it that salty/sweet thing in the same bite. Is not too heavy or overly sweet. Was the perfect consistency for spreading. I made it twice and the second time left out the egg whites (worried about salmonella for my little one) and was just as good. Yum,Yum!

Sweet, fast & easy! The vanilla does give the frosting a bit of a dingy color but the flavor is fine & the original recipe is meant to be colored. I left out the milk and cut the recipe in half, that made the perfect amount for one batch of cupcakes. :)

I omitted the milk, kept the egg whites, and instead of shortening, I used 1/2 package of cream cheese plus 1 stick butter.  I didn't know the yield of the recipe before I made it, but it made enough frosting for 2 dozen+ cupcakes heavily frosted.  I might try keeping the milk and omitting the egg whites next time.

Easy, delicious and not too sweet. Goes perfectly with a wedding style/almond flavor cake. I used butter flavor shortening because that's all I had, and it was very good.

Pretty Good! I am not much of a frosting fan and usually can only take certain buttercream frostings. But I tried this one as an experiment and I can eat it without feeling that frosting-sick feel. I love the lightness. I also used just a little bit of milk as almost everyone else has said to do, and I am glad I took the advice. 1/4 cup would have been way to much.

I'll give it 2 stars. One star for ease and another for flavor. Unfortunately, this frosting, as directed, is as runny as a cake batter. I added 4T of extra flour, and it was still runny. I added another cup of powdered sugar, and it came a bit closer to the right consistency. It was dingy from the colored vanilla (I'll use clear next time or omit), as well. 

Overall, I would not use this particular recipe again. However, there are some reviewers' versions that have possibility.

I have been baking for years and have tried several frosting recipes.  I can honestly say this one is the best overall for taste (not to sweet) and is so easy to work with.

Great recipe. I used two capfuls of milk (not sure how much that would be), thats the ONLY reason this got four stars.  I have four kids, one of them hates too sweet icing; this is perfect.

the shortening was a little overwhelming. If there was anything that i could change about this recipe it would definitely be to find a substitute for the shortening. Other than that, i thought it was the perfect texture for frosting.

No milk and I used butter flavored Crisco for the shortening.  This was the best frosting ever.  I can't handle the sweetness of store bought kind and my husband was tired of me cutting it with whipped cream to lighten it. Now I will just make this.....sweet but not too sweet.

Worked great for a clean, white frosting that was fluffy and yummy! I made sure to use clear vanilla extract and beat it for 10 minutes.

Tastes delicious, but it was way too runny. I had to add much more flour and sugar in addition to overnight refrigeration to get the fluffy consistency.

I had a lot of problems with this recipe.  It was okay on my cupcakes when spread thin though.  Mine was the opposite problem of everyone else.  Mine was too thick and after mixing it for more than double the time it deemed necessary, I still couldnt get it to thin out.  Also, the texture was not a very nice one, but that was probably because of the flour.  I added a little more milk and it was ok, but it took a while.  In the end, it was pretty good on the cupcakes.

Loved it! I did use the ingredients suggested by other readers, such as omitting the milk and using clear vanilla instead of regular. With these changes the frosting turned out perfect! Definately one of the best frosting recipes on AR.

I tried this recipe for the first time yesterday afternoon. It tastes delicious! It's just a bit too thin for my liking. It was a bit runny to frost my cake so I didn't quite get the coverage I was looking for. I think I should have added more powdered sugar?

This is a great recipe. I actually made two batches. But I had to add 1 1/2-2 cups more confectioner's sugar. This was to stiffen it and to make it more sweet. It was good, but had a mildly weird texture. Nothing CRAZY weird, or even really noticeable. This was a great recipe, its just not the most amazing frosting I have ever had, which would be 5 stars... But overall a hit, and by the way, you are gonna need a lot more than 2 drops of coloring!

OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! Been looking for a frosting recipe that tastes as good as Betty Crocker's, but can have the thickness of buttercream, so that it will hold up for decorating.  This one has it ALL!!!  Thanks so much for this amazingly sweet and yummy frosting, Claudia!!!

I did not make any.changes. It is perfect the way it is. I like it because it isn't to sweet . I had to make 100 cupcakes for an event and was looking for a good  recipe for the frosting.  I found this one and it was perfect

I made it without the egg and drizzled milk in, it was good to me but my only thing is I taste the shortening for the after taste in my mouth. Not sure how to get around that but I will try again and experiment with it.

I made exactly as it said and to me it was too sweet. Also, if you don't want to color it, you need to use the clear vanilla extract. Otherwise it turns a weird looking dirty white. It's good for people who like overly sweet things, but personally, I won't use it again.

I love this recipe i only made 3 changes 1. I only used a 1/2 cup butter ( I also only has 3 cups sugar) 2. I did about a table spoon of milk (milk makes it look shiny other wise i would not use any) 3. I added a table spoon or 2 of lemon so it did not taste sickly sweet. I also suggest using a stand mixer on high so it really gets whipped up.

I love the recipe, but instead of omitting the milk, I left it in and took out the egg.  This was on a very small scale (1 serving to see how it was), but I think it would work out just as well.

This frosting is awesome! I used it on ice cream cone cupcakes and on a cake and still had extra! Everone who ate it loved it. The frosting will get too watery if you add all the milk, so I halved it. It was delicious!

This is the perfect frosting! Not too sweet and sooooo much tastier than store-bought frosting!!! I did use a bit more than 2 drops of blue food coloring so that it didn't look gray. I highly recommend this frosting!
