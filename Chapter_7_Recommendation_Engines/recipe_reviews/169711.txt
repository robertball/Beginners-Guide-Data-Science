A new favorite! I used butter and olive oil, sauteed 3 green onions and garlic for a few mins. added about 3/4c. of half n half, some seasoned salt, like nature's seasoning, and then mashed up 3 whole avacados into this mixture and reduced it a bit.  What resulted was a thick, creamy, (but with good texture) sauce that I poured over toasted sourdough bread with shrimp on top,(they were already cooked)grilled asparagus and a salad of mixed greens with pears, dried cranberries and poppy seed dressing. A big hit. Take a recipe and make it your own. Use it as a guideline and suit it to you and your family's taste. This idea was exceptional and I will be making this again and again for my family.

This was very simple and very tasty. I served the shrimp over herbed rice & drizzeled the sauce over the top. I then garnished with lime juice and green onions and accompanied it with fresh green beans. My family loved it.

Turned out decent, but I had higher hopes. Actually a 3.5 star rating. Used extra garlic and avocado. Then right before I pulled it off the stove, I added cilantro, green onion, and lime juice.

Delicious - I added sauteed onions & zucchini to make it a little more than just sauce.

excellent!  i blended cream, avocado and creole seasoning in the blender to make it as smooth as possible.
always, when i use shrimp, i marinate it in creole seasoning for at least a half hour.  very tasty, indeed.

Yumm-o!!  I used Light Cream instead of Heavy, added more shrimp (cuz there was a ton of sauce) and Old Bay seasoning, (and some crushed red peppers for myself).  It was fabulous.  My kids loved it too, even tho it was green!  Definitely a keeper!

Pretty good recipe I will say. I tried this recipe last night and it was pretty good (my roommate even liked it).  I brought leftovers to work today and with all you put in it the avacado didn't brown overnight (this I liked)  It did start a little bland and could definately be spiced up or down to suit your personal taste.  I did add a packet of dry Hidden Valley Ranch to it (attempting to get a avacado ranch taste)... it was OK.

It was rather bland, as others have said. Also, watch your garlic carefully when sauteeing. Mine burnt a little and the result wasn't very good.

Very good "base" recipe. I personally thought it needed to be seasoned more,as others have said, but it's a great, simple beginning!

I sauteed onions & garlic in the butter before adding avacado, and added some spices (salt, garlic powder) and cheese (pecorino romano) at the very end.  Otherwise, this dish would have been very bland.  I served it over rice, and it was very filling.

The sauce is very mild, almost bland, but it doesn’t mask the taste of the shrimp.  I would add a little lime juice next time – but I still loved it. It would be easy to add some jazz to this dish to suit your tastes.

this was okay. i wish i knew what to serve with it. I tried pasta, and that just made it bland. maybe would be a good dip for shrimp or crackers, It has potential. I just cant see it as a main course.

A little unusual tasting.  My 2 year old loved it.  But I did not know what else to make with it.

Delicious and easy. I don't usually have heavy cream so I normally use skim milk.

I just made this tonight. I sauteed a little bit of vidalia onion and a lot of garlic in a stick of butter. added about 2 cups milk and 2 avacodos. Added salt and pepper. I cooked the shrimp separate in olive oil and added redfish seasoning.  Served over spaghetti noodles. Smells great and taste great! Thanks for the base recipe!!

My only critique: less butter, more seasoning. I added 2 tsp of lemon pepper to decrease the overwhelming butter flavor.

Not bad. Full marks for speed of preparation, but a little bit bland. I added a healthy pinch of salt, which helped, but it needed something else. I'll toy with this as a base recipe though, it's got potential.

I added tender sauteed steak, crawdads, and crabmeat along with shrimp. Also used lime juice, tajin chili lime seasoning, cayenne pepper,  and Old Bay. I made a big pot and my teenaged son ate most of it. Wow!

I typed in the words "avocado shrimp cream," this recipe came up. I fried shrimp and added frozen vegetables. Added 1/2 cup white cheese to the sauce when it was finished cooking. It needed a tiny bit more pizazz, so I added a TBL of lemon juice! Perfect! I put the shrimp and veggies over prepared brown rice and covered with the avocado sauce! Husband loved it! Thanks!

HOLY GUACAMOLE WAS THIS GOOD! I made few changes: almond milk instead of cream, extra garlic, LOTS of grated parmesan on top, and served it over ditalini. Wow. I was worried it wouldn't turn out very good because my avocado was a bit on the chunky side, but it was way better than I expected. Thank you for the recipe!

I thought it was very delicious.  Tonight I will try to use the idea with salmon.  I think it will work
