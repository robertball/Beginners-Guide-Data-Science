This was very good.  I could've drained
off a little juice as it was very juicy but the flavor was great! I had 3 29 oz.
cans of tart cherries so I added a little bit more sugar and a tablespoon more tapioca.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  The almond flavoring I almost left out but I was glad I didn't because it is a subtle but very nice flavor with the cherries.

I had a pound of fresh sour cherries so I decided to use thoes.  Because I only had a pound I halved the rest of the recipe.  I thought it was really good but the tapioca was soft but it did leave a texture that I didn't particularly care for.  My favorite is to use about a tablespoon of liquid pectin for a thickener.  I also used one crust and made cut outs so you could see the berries.  The brown sugar really gave it a subtle richness.  I'll be making again with frozen cherries most likely.

Very good.  I could only find one brand of cherries in water and it was 2.60 a can so using 5 cans, this recipe can get pricey.

This is a good cobbler and not too sweet.  I added a little less than 1 TBSP cornstarch because one reviewer commented how juicy it was and I didn't want it too come out too soupy.  For us it was perfect.  I also rolled out the 2 pie crusts separately and sprinkled a little cinnamon-sugar in between. Great!

Sooo delicious and very easy to make! I cut the pie crust into strips/lattice and used a cookie cutter to decorate...

I made this tonight and it was great. I usually follow the recipes exactly but in this case I couldn't find the cherries in water so I opted for the canned cherries for pies. 3 cans was plenty. I only added the brown sugar and omitted the white since I didn't think it needed all that sugar along with the sugary cherries. It was perfect! Made a 9 in pie with plenty of pie crust left over for Turkey cookie cutter crust on top.

This cobbler is currently baking, so I can't speak to the taste; however, I wanted to mention that I couldn't find cherries in water or cans of the right ounces.  Instead, I bought the "More Fruit" brand and rinsed them in a strainer.  Afterwards, I only added one of the sugars.  The consistency and flavor seemed accurate upon a pre-baked taste test.

I made this recipe using a bag of frozen tart cherries and put the filling in a deep dish pie pan.  I used cutouts of a pre-made pie crust for the top.  This was absolutely delicious, but very runny.  I will definitely make this again, but will adjust to thicken the cherry juice and use a little less sugar.
