These are so good!  The first time I made these brownies I forgot to add the flour for some reason but they turned out moist, rich and very yummy.  The second time I made them I remembered to add the flour and they still turned out rich and yummy but slightly dense.  I'm going to have to say I liked it better flourless but either way it is so good.  Instead of melting the chocolate and butter over the stove I just put it in the microwave for 30 seconds, stirred it and then put it in for 20 more seconds and it was the perfect consistency-much faster and easier.

These are absolutely wonderful! I made them as is except I cut the sugar for the brownie part to 1/4 cup per another reviewers suggestion.  I also made them in a 12 cup muffin pan lined with baking cups (makes clean up, etc. super easy).  I spread a rounded teaspoon of the brownie mix on the bottom, then spread out the cheesecake mix evenly amongst the cups, then topped with remaining brownie mix and swirled the tops a bit with a knife.  This baked up just like cupcakes!  I bet they would taste awesome with a cream cheese frosting or something.  Another good thing is that this recipe is really easy, versatile, inexpensive and doesn't require a lot of ingredients - I had everything but the cream cheese and chocolate chips already.  Also, can be made to your own liking - the possibilities for flavor combinations is endless.  Maybe next time I'll try white chocolate chips, or butterscotch.  Or flavor the cheesecake.  The only thing that I didn't like was the chocolate somewhat over powered the cheesecake.  I'll cut back on the amount of chips in the cheesecake next time.  Baked for 25 mins, although I think they could of used a few more minutes. Thanks for the recipe - will make these again and again!

I made it with half of the sugar and did not add any chips to a cream cheese mixture. Turned out tasty and still quite sweet. I also used whole wheat flour instead of white. I gave it 4 stars as the original recipe is way too sweet for my taste.

Phenom brownies! I used dark chocolate chips rather than semi-sweet. I melted the chips and butter in the microwave for 1 min, stirred it, then another 10 seconds - much easier. I baked it for about 40 min. I did not change any measurements. I thought these were the best brownies I'd ever made. They were very rich, so 16 pcs from the square pan was ideal.

Wow.  Very, very good.  My husband told me he would order these in a restaurant.  I always double the recipe and use a 9x13.  It takes about 40 min to bake when doubled.  The first time,  I made as is.  Now when I make it I put about half the amount of choc chips into the cream cheese mix and usually use a little extra cream cheese.  Delicious.

I made these at 10 pm one night and had them all mixed up and baked in under an hour. Not too much trouble for great brownies, I'd say. Just loved these. I took them to a superbowl get together and everyone was really glad I had made two pans! I followed the recipe to the "t" on these, except for melting the chocolate chips and butter in the microwave. One thing I might do is decrease the amount of choc. chips in the cheesecake part, as that was a little overpowered, but no complaints from anyone.

This is an excellent recipe!  They were excellent warm, and they were just as good the next day.  They have the perfect mixture of the sharp cheesecake taste and the sweet brownie taste in a soft, smooth texture.  Overall, excellent!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made these last night, and I'm afraid that we didn't really enjoy this recipe.  I used a 9x9 silicone pan, I followed the directions exactly--including the makeshift double boiler, and they baked beautifully.  The texture was a perfect brownie texture.  To avoid the gooey mess that doesn't bake in the center, never bake brownies in ceramic or glass...just my experience with them. The recipe works very well as written.  The reasons we were disappointed with this recipe:  (1)This recipe managed to dirty up an entire sink full of dishes, and it was a complete pain to put together. (2)The chocolate flavor overtook the recipe, and the cheesecake flavor disappeared into the background. I really wanted to taste and feel that cheescake layer.  It just wasn't there. I should've realized it would be like that since the recipe calls for 2 cups (practically an entire bag) of chocolate chips. I probably won't make these again.  I think it would be much better without chocolate chips in the cream cheese layer, but I can't recommend this recipe to anyone who loves cheesecake and is trying to get a dessert with that flavor in it.  It's just not what we thought it would be...and it's just not worth the amount of mess you have to create to make these.

Oh my gosh - these are so, so good!! Dreamily delicious. I cut the sugar in the cake to 1/4 cup and underbaked a tad so it would be super moist. WOW!!!

These were incredible!! I halfed the chocolate chips in the cream cheese batter and baked it in a 9x13 glass pan. They were moist and chocolatey. Delicious right out of the oven but out of this world when chilled. I made them to be ready for dessert after dinner. They didnt even last until midnight. I have been told that I have to make them again. And I am going to try the brownie part on its own too because i think they would be delicious!

So, I'm not changing my rating, but I am changing my review. Next time that I make these, I'm doubling the cheesecake filling, adding more chocolate chips to the batter part, and again, I'd be leaving out the chocolate chips in the cheesecake layer (which I forgot to do this time, but liked it that way anyways.) Oh, and one more thing, I added a small amount of vanilla to the cheesecake -I'd say about 1/4 of a tsp, at most. I don't really know, I just splashed a small amount in. Either way, my friend and I both liked them (i'll be getting some vanilla ice cream to eat with the rest of them)

I changed this up in order to suit my personal tastes. Firstly, I put no chocolate chips in the cheesecake batter. I didn't want an overwhelming chocolate flavour- it was still pretty strong even without the chips. Secondly, I cut the sugar in the brownie batter to 1/3 cup, but I think 1/4 cup will be sufficient next time. I also used 1/3 cup whole wheat flour + 1/3 cup all purpose flour for the brownie part, but I think using all whole wheat will be fine next time. It's pretty unnoticeable. The brownie part was just a smidge dense for my liking, so maybe I'll increase baking powder to 3/4 tsp next time. With these changes, the result was not too sweet nor overwhelmingly chocolatey.

I followed the recipe exactly.  They were VERY good. They were chunky, they were very sweet and chocolaty. However you could barely taste the cheesecake.  I love sweets but I must admit these were a bit much for me. Cut them very small. I would definitely make them again but increase the cream cheese part and decrease the sugar.

i had to cook these at least ten minutes longer than stated, and still they weren't very firm. i will definitely leave out the extra cup of chocolate chips if i make them again.

This was delicious!! I cut the bownie sugar to 1/4 cup, and used 1/2 cup white chocolate in the cheesecake part. Next time I think I'll try a touch of vanilla in the cheesecake, but otherwise it was perfect!! Thanks!

Great for a cheesecake, brownie craving pregnant mother in the house! She requested that I go make her either of these desserts & found this awesome combo. YUMMY! So good that my aunt that's getting married soon wants me to add these brownies to her dessert table.

AWESOME!!!!  I made these one evening for dessert.  The next day my husband (who hadn't had any dessert but got up for a midnight snack) told me how much he appreciated "that brownie stuff" I made...obviously because half the pan was gone!!!  My 3 yr old also loved them...naturally!  I did use another person's tip for melting the chocolate chips in the microwave & everything worked fine that way...I did use the flour mixture and they turned out just like I imagined...thanks for the relatively easy "from scratch" recipe!

I thought these were great! I made them as written, but baked them in a glass dish which may have caused the baking time to be longer than 30 minutes. I baked them for about 40. Also, I used mini chocolate chips for the cream cheese layer because I don't like large chunks of chocolate. My friends RAVED about them and would love for me to make them again for our next get together.

Amazing! These are so delicious!! I did cut back the chocolate chips in the cream cheese mixture to 1/4 cup, cut the sugar in the brownie mixture to 1/4 cup & added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract to the brownie mixture.  I will definately be making these again.. and again!

I bake a lot, including many different types of brownies.  I didn't find these to be anything noteworthy.  They were fine

I made these for the second time tonight, and with some changes they were FANTASTIC! 1: I left the chips out of the creamcheese part. 2: I used 1/3 cup of sugar in each part. 3: I used a 9x9 pan. 4: I baked them at 300* for 50 minutes for a much gentler and more even baking (no crispy corners and gooey center). 5: I didn't marble the layers, so it was like brownies with cheesecake "frosting". AWESOME!

I used less sugar as some suggested, but 1/4 cup less was too much to leave out. I would add it back in... all of it. I used 1/4 cup mini chips in the cheesecake batter. That seems reasonable.

These are incredible! I even tried making them with white chocolate chips, then added some strawberry puree to the cream cheese mixture. I would recommend trying it if it sounds appealing to you at all, they're very moist and delicious. Thank you for the recipe, it is really amazing!

THESE ARE AWSOME!!!!! I doubled the batch (had cream cheese to use up) and baked in a 9x13" pan. I kept a very close eye on them towards the end of cooking to ensure I didn't dry them out. Every other direction I followed exactly. I took some of them to work, and from how fast they dissapeared, these are the best 'goodie' I've brought in yet. I loved the marble look, it made them look so professional. Thank you for this keeper recipe, and for the extra pounds I'll be adding enjoying it. :)

Loved these. Halved the recipe. Followed properly, and came out great. Used microwave instead of double boiler. And added 1 spoon dark cocoa. After a night in the fridge they taste a lot fudgier-if you're into that.

Good...really good! :) I decreased the flour to 1/2 cup and used a little less (like 1/2 cup) chips in the cheesecake mixture.  Delish.   Made in Demarle muffin tins and baked for about 25 min.  No stick...and YUM!

I don't know where to begin, I had so many problems with this recipe.  First, I didn't have an 8x8 pan, so I made them in a 9x9 pan.  I didn't have enough chocolate batter to put the top layer over the cheesecake. I didn't think this would matter and turned out it didn't.  Then the chocolate chips never melted in the batter, so you are biting into chip-sized chunks of chocolate in almost every bite.  In addition, the brownie batter is so dry, tasteless, and crumbly, that even my kids didn't eat them and you know that is a big problem if they won't eat something chocolate.  I recommend refrigerating them for the cheesecake, but I had to throw most of them away.

This recipe is amazing, both right out the oven and completely cool. It stays nice and moist and very sweet! My third layer of on the brownie didn't cover the cream cheese layer all the way but that was completely fine and gave it a great look.

The best cream cheese brownie ever! Made no changes to the recipe and they looked exactly like the photo indicates. After 4 days they're still moist. Will definitely make again.

These were delicious! I followed other reviewers and microwaved the chocolate chips and butter. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chips and followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great! I could've eaten them all myself.

These are def staying in my recipe box! I am not a baker at all in part due to everything I try and bake becoming rock hard after cooled, these... tasty for days. I tried both ways, with and without the chocolate chips in the cheesecake part and I've decided winner either way. I do however like them a little better with 1/2 cup flour vs the 2/3 cup that's why I gave the 4 stars.

DEFINITELY don't bake these too long.  Take them out while they are still soft in the middle.  My batter was delicious, I will say, but the brownies sucked because I left them in like 5 minutes too long.

DELICIOUS!!!  I made these for a party and let's just say that as soon as I brought them out, they were all gone.  Everyone raved about them!  And the best part is, they are SO EASY!  I used an 11x7 glass pan and baked them at the recommended temperature, but cut off about 5 minutes.  They were gooey, chocolately and delicious.  I will definitely be making these again!

These brownies had a good dense chocolately taste, however they were much too dense for me and everyone else who ate them.  The cream cheese flavor was almost nonexistant, and the extra chocolate chips in the cream cheese was overkill.  I will probably not make these again.

I LOVED this recipe.  My hubby, the usual brownie/dessert of any kind enthusiast, didn't rave about them.  But he did fight with me over the last one.  I would probably also use a larger dish to cook it in next time too.  They were still VERY gooey in the middle.  Next time I will also cook them far enough in advance to be able to chill it down as they tasted amazing once cold.

Wonderful recipe - had all ingredients on hand except cream cheese. I cut them into bite-sizers and got a full plate (maybe 42).  They were soft (without being gooey) and delicious.

Definitely a good recipe for big events. I made two batches and both turned out well. The only change I made was in the pan size. I used 9x13 inch. They were thinner and there was a larger amount of cream cheese than actual brownie. Overall, they were wonderful and were a big hit with my friends.

It is such an easy brownie recipe.  So yummy and moist!

I made it for Father's Day and my husband thought I brought it from the bakery!

I followed the recipe pretty much as it is except I used mini chocolate chip in the cream cheese batter vs. 1 cup of semi-sweet.

I used 1/2 cup of bittersweet and 1/2 cup of semi-sweet and no complains from the family.

I served it with vanilla ice cream and homemade whipped cream with chocolate syrup and raspberry.  

No more brownie mix from the box anymore!!

These are Amazing and I would highly recommend them to Anyone! These are so creamy and delectable and they really melt in your mouth (at least they did when I made them). I made them as is, except I tried it as another reviewer suggested. The corrections are as followed: I cut the sugar for the brownie part to 1/4 cup per another reviewers suggestion. I also made them in a 12 cup muffin pan lined with baking cups (makes clean up, etc. super easy). I spread a rounded teaspoon of the brownie mix on the bottom, then spread out the cheesecake mix evenly amongst the cups, then topped with remaining brownie mix and swirled the tops a bit with a knife… This alteration was so much better than the original and made it very creamy! Even though I didn’t make the original recipe, I made a similar one and still turned out better than I expected. 5 Stars!

I made this after supper for guests. I used an 8x8 pan instead of a 9x13.  The recipe is soooo easy and the results were amazing. So decadent!  They tasted even better the next day which was surprising to me. I would make them again!

This is a great recipe for those of you who love cheesecake but do not like to make them.  I took some other reviewers suggestion and cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup in the brownie batter and also microwaved the chocolate chips to melt them.  Easy and delicious!

These were good, however I made these within days of making Knock you Naked Brownies from the Pioneer Woman (Food Network) and Oh my! So, these might have gotten a higher rating, had I not had the others to compare these to!

The only thing I did different was omit the flour after reading one of the reviews.  I wasn't sure I had enough white flour, and I was too lazy to dig out my sifter.  Other than that, I used the same amount of sugar, chocolate chips, etc, and they turned out delicious.  Chocolate and cream cheese are 2 of my favourite things, so I knew I'd like these.  I tried them when they were still warm, yummy.  I tried one after being in the fridge for a couple hours, yummy.  I tried 2 today after being in the fridge overnight, still yummy :)
If you love brownies and cheesecake, you should definitely try these.

I used this recipe to make Chocolate Cherry Cheesecake Brownies instead of the chocolate chips one.  It worked just fine and came out very tasty.  I substituted chopped maraschino cherries and 1 teaspoon of juice for flavoring.  I would use an 8x8 pan because I like my brownies high and square.  Other than that it is a fab recipe.  I topped these with a cherry drizzle and powdered sugar.

i totally screwed up this recipe and it still turned out fabulous!  doubled the cream cheese part but forgot to double the brownie part.  then 3 minutes after i put it in the oven, i realized i hadn't mixed the flour mixture into the chocolate mixture (don't ask where my brain was...long day!).  so i ended up mixing the flour into the whole pan, what else was i going to do?  turned out like chocolate cream cheese bars instead of cheesecake and brownie, but it still tasted pretty darn good.  and if you can soooo mess up a recipe like i did and have edible results, then it's 5 star worthy.  i will make again properly in the near future (with a better nights sleep, too!!)

These turned out moist and very sweet.  I melted the chocolate chips and butter in the microwave but followed all other instructions as written.  I found that I had to bake the brownies for about 35 min and even still, the center was very gooey.  Next time, I would reduce or even leave out the chips in the cream cheese mixture so that it doesn't get lost in all of the chocolate.  Overall though, better than a box!

These were great! Very rich....my mom bit into one and her eyes rolled back in her head...lol  I knew they were a success at that point!  I followed the recipe exact, except for microwaving the chips and butter and not adding as many chips to the cream cheese mixture as suggested by previous reviewers.  I didnt hold out much.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 glass pan.

After tasting these an hour out of the oven (while they were a bit warm) i decided i didn't like them much. Wasn't chocolatey enough for me, and it was in between a cake and brownie. Husband said they were OK, and brother-in-law said they were very nice...matter of taste i think. However, after storing in the fridge overnight and having one for breakfast i have definately changed my mind. The cheese layer made the brownie taste amazing and it was much better cold, more dessert-like :) will make again, I did use milk chocolate melted. Will add a tbsp of cocoa next time.

Fun recipe to make with the kids (especially when you swirl the brownie mixture and cheescake mixtures together).  Used a double boiler to melt the chocolate and butter (a good, easy cooking lesson for kids) and it worked out great.  Next time I will cut the chocolate chips used in the cheescake mixture in 1/2 as suggested by others - a bit too rich.  Great recipe - thanks!

These are pretty good, a fudgy and chewy cheesecake bite. However I found the batter at the bottom didn't quite bake through, and once refrigerated the whole thing got the consistency of an actual cheesecake. I'm not sure if this is good or bad, but I think I would try using a shallower pan next time.

Very tasty.  More of an adult brownie than a kids brownie.  My little ones didn't like it.  I do think the bake time is very wrong.  I followed the bake time and the center was terribly raw.  If I make again I would add an additional 15-20 minutes onto the bake time.

I followed everything but the brownie recipe, (which I will try next time), because I did not have enough chocolate chips and it turned out great! Doubled the recipe also, but I may try the vanilla extract idea, adding it to the cheesecake mixture next time. But, my husband and I loved how it turned out!

Amazing and so easy! I didn't change a thing and they were perfect! Only suggestion I have would be to cool in the fridge before eating. We found them much better cold then warm, different from most brownies.

wow! I was a little nervous as 1) I had tried a similar recipe last week and it was awful 2) I was converting to grams... I added 5-10 mins to the cooking time as it was really wet (I think this is actually ok-next time I shall be brave :) )Also- I chopped up choc rather than use choc chips and used 70% dark, and then the rest split with white and milk choc chunks which I just folded in. These were amazing. thank you thank you (my waist line does not thank you)

These are absolutely spectacular.

I subbed 1/2 cup shredded coconut for the chocolate chips in the cheesecake mixture, and used dark chocolate chips plus 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans in the brownie batter. Everything else was as listed.

If you are upset I rated it after my changes ... sue me.

So easy to make and so yummy!
I microwaved the butter and chocolate together at 20 second intervals to speed things up. 
My father-in-law loves brownies and this was a hit for him and the rest of the family.

the taste is out of this world! especially if you use dark chocolate chips. Although the brownie part of the recipe was WAY more like a cake (soft, breadlike), and the cheesecake part is BARELY tasteable, and it's nothing like i was expecting, it's STILL good. really, really, REALLY good. EVEN though 1/2 of the brownie batter was NOT enough to cover the bottom of the pan, and i ended up using about 3/4 instead. EVEN though the cheesecake layer BARELY covered the brownie layer. EVEN though the last brownie layer ended up just covering the middle, and I had to spread it out EXTREMELY thin. EVEN though the marble part DIDNT really work out. THEYRE STILL GOOD. ACTUALLY, THEY'RE AMAZING. so yeah, I had some problems with the amount, but the taste makes up for it. totally.

Just tried this and it's great as promised!  Next time, I will probably try the suggestion made to reduce the chips in the cheesecake layer, and possibly less sugar in the brownie.  Thanks for sharing!  I will be making this often, and with such a simple recipie, there are lots of variations to try :)

Rich and delicious! I used dark chocolate chips in the main brownie batter part and used semi sweet in the cream cheese filling. I had to cook about ten minutes longer due to elevation. Awesome recipe!

Great taste. I baked them for 45 minutes and even though they didn't look done (despite the crusty top and pulling away from the edges of the pan) I took them out because I did not want to overbake. Let cool completely and when I cut into them it was almost all raw dough. Delicious raw dough, but they were nowhere near done enough.

These were good.  Next time I may undertake them a little, because they were just a tad dry.  The only changes I made were: 1) I melted the chocolate/butter in the microwave.  2) I didn't add chocolate chips to the cream cheese mixture.

Maybe I didn't really do it right, but I felt that I did not have enough of the brownie mix to really make two layers and it ended up too soft to really hold up well. The two different layers just had too must inconsistency in softness. The flavor was pretty good. I might try this again with some tweaks.

Never did firm up.  I did taste the edges that were semi-baked, and was not impressed.  I will just stick with my favorite one-bowl brownie recipe.

I read the reviews and was skeptical about making these.  A lot of people said they did not taste the cheesecake in the brownie.  Not true.. These are sooooo good!! If you are a cheesecake fan like me- they are wonderful

Although my husband swears these are good, I have to say I was thoroughly disappointed.  The texture was far too thick and sticky with all the extra chocolate chips!  Don't get me wrong, I like a nice moist brownie... but these are like biting into a wet sponge.  "Melt-in-your-mouth?"  Not so much.

I added a capful of vanilla to the cheesecake mixture, and I sprinkled some dark chocolate chunks to the bottom layer of the brownie. These were  very fudgy and good. I just think next time I need to let them bake about 10 mintues longer.

Gave 4 stars so I wouldn't mess up the ratings.  However: Accidentally used "chocolate-flavored" chips.  Not sure if this is the reason, but these were a disaster.  Really oily, undercooked, and way too sweet.  Even my husband, who never turns away from sweets, didn't like them.

Really great recipe. I would recommend when putting the mixing bowl over the once boiling water- keep the water heating until the chocolate chips and butter are melted otherwise it's really hard to mix.  I also had to double the recipes to make thick substantial brownies for both layers.

I have made this recipe twice now. The first time, I followed it EXACTLY as written, using Ghirardelli semisweet chocolate chips and Philadelphia Cream Cheese with 1/3 less fat, and they were HEAVENLY. I preferred microwaving them so they were gooey and warm before eating, but they are also delicious room temperature or chilled. I'm absolutely in love with the recipe! 

The second time, I thought I'd try it with Ghirardelli 60% cacao dark chocolate chips (to get a less sweet brownie) and they didn't really come out right at all. The bottom brownie layer is dry, and the top didn't crack in the way it did when I made it with semisweet chocolate chips. I'm not sure if it's the chocolate, or if I made some other mistake, but I did everything else the same and to my knowledge did not make any mistakes. 

Follow this recipe exactly as written and I'm sure you'll love it!

I made these for a company treat and they loved it and so did I!!!! Super easy too for brownies not from a box anyway. We doubled it  and used the BIG brownie pan! Had to soften the cream cheese in the microwave because we made them at 11pm and this worked out fine. Also used a handheld electric mixer to blend the cream cheese mixture more. Took about 1 hour to cool enough to add to fridge.

These brownies where delicious.  I would have given them 5 stars but I did make some changes which I felt upped the yumminess!
1) I did not add the chocolate chips to the cheese cake.  I felt that was over kill, but to each their own.
2) I added about a teaspoon of vanilla and a couple dashes of lemon juice to the cheese cake filling to make it taste closer to real cheese cake.
3) For the brownies I added a tbs of cocoa powder, another shot of vanilla and increased the sugar by 1/4 cup.
We had company over for dinner and the pan was gone!!  Wonderful.  I will defiantly be making these again. (my husband said so ;-)

I made it, great combination of the Brownies and cream cheese. I run of chocolate chips, and only 1/2 cup left. So, i added a white chocolate chips to the cheese mix. The tase was undesribable.. This is on of the great recipe ever.. 
Note: i think 20-22 minutes is more than enough. The cake bottom almost burned, and turned to be black and smell burned..

I made two alterations (okay- screw ups I couldn't avoid because I was in a major rush) to this recipe: Neufatschel (sp?) cheese instead of regular cream cheese, and my eggs were downright cold. However, I've done both of these before and had things turn out alright. So I was surprised that the brownie part was dry and tasteless, there wasn't enough brownie batter to go around to begin with, and the cheesecake part never set and tasted just okay (when you could get past the raw mushy texture). I did, however, like that there were choc. chips in the cheesecake part. If you try this, learn from my mistakes.

This was absolutely delicious! I recommend that you test the doneness of the brownies by using a toothpick, inserting towards the middle. When the toothpick comes out pretty clean, it's done. Make sure to cool off then put in fridge. Tastes so good chilled! Definitely a GREAT brownie recipe! People couldn't believe that the recipe was from scratch and yet so moist.

All I can say is yum-yum and so easy to make. I lined my pan with parchment paper to easily take them out of the pan for nice squares.

As is, delicious but OMG sweet.  I can't make it this way all the time. I give this 5 full stars with the following modifications:  reduce sugar in cream cheese mixture to 3 Tbsp, and sugar in chocolate mixture to only 1/3 cup.  I have made this 3 times now; no chips in the cream cheese, choc chips in the cream cheese, white choc chips in the cream cheese, pecans in the cream cheese... it's all good.

Good recipe, but very sweet! I cut back choc chips in cheesecake mixture to 1/4 c. and used less sugar in brownie mixture, but it still turned out sweet. I think these will taste better after they are cooled and kept in fridge. Next time I make cheesecake brownies I'll be sure to use a cocoa-based recipe rather than use chocolate chips--I think it tastes better. Definitely cut into 16 squares because of the sweetness!

These are very fudgy brownies and very rich.  They were a hit at my Easter party but I suggest cutting them in small squares due to richness.  My guests were craving naps after dessert.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out really good! I did change it a little though... I used a package of brownie mix and made it as directed and I doubled the cheesecake ingredients and added vanilla (I love cheesecake more then brownies).  I also got the kind of brownie mix that included chocolate sauce topping which ended up tasting really good. :) Hope this is helpful! I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent! I melted the chocolate and butter together in the microwave on a reduced power, and it worked out well. I also added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to the cream cheese mixture. The only other change I would make would be to use mini semisweet chocolate chips in the cream cheese filling. I served my husband a piece, and he served himself another piece later. For my husband to actually get up from his Lazyboy and cut himself a piece proves he really must have loved them....LOL. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I wish I would have read the reviews before I made  these. As my husband and I both enjoyed these, there was too much overpowering chocolate. I am going to either leave out the chocolate chips in the cream cheese or lessen the amount. Over all very good though.

VERY YUMMY!!! it was really chocolaty but really good...just don't try making it in muffin tins IT DOESN'T WORK. It will stick, even if you grease the muffin tins. Other than that it was an amazing recipe. I definately reccomend it, it's quick, easy and your guests will love it!!! :D :D

I used a box brownie mix and left out the chocolate chips because I forgot to buy some.
I baked in an 8x8 glass pan and they took about 35 or 40 minutes. 

I tried to eat one warm because I couldn't wait for them to cool, bad idea. It was a weird texture and it didn't stay together.
I ate another one after they cooled and it was amazing! The cheesecake wasn't very strong, but i could definitely taste it. 
I took the advice of another review and stored it in the fridge.  Then next day they went from amazing to heavenly!! They had a better flavor, I could taste the cheesecake more and they had the perfect brownie consistency. This would be there perfect dessert to make the day before and put in the fridge till you need them the next day. 
These are one of the best brownies I've ever had, you won't be disappointed. And the box mix worked great if you are feeling lazy like I was.

This is a great recipe! Instead of using chocolate chips with the cream cheese mixture, I used white (vanilla)chips and added a splash of vanilla flavoring to enhance the cheesecakey flavor along with 2 tablespoons of heavy cream. I also lessened the amount of sugar in brownie mix. I will have to send an update of the taste once my neighbors taste them since I don't eat sweets! UPDATE: Very moist and rich according to my neighbors! I'll be adding these to my holiday gift giving!

This is a fudgy delicious brownie recipe.  I converted it to gluten free by substituting Mama's Gluten Free Almond Blend Flour.  I also used dark chocolate chips, becuase that's what I had on hand.  These are so rich and chocolatey!  I will definetly make these again. I may try to add some chopped cherry to the cheesecake layer next time.

Really tasty.  Unfortunately I slightly burned mine because I kept thinking they weren't quite done yet so keep a close eye on them.  I halved the flour and got a nice fudgy brownie.  I also halved the sugar in the brownie portion and it was plenty sweet.  I'd definitely make again.  Used 1/3 fat cream cheese and it was delicious!

i made these in comparison with a David L. recipe I found on another blog-- these were the winners. They are delicious. I halved the cream cheese mixture and it was still plenty. I will make again. FYI- bake time was closer to 45+ min.

Outstanding! Didn't change a thing. Very moist and velvety! Can't compare with box mix, sorry Betty Crocker, you lost this one! Made a batch the first time and it was gone in no time. For a dinner party doubled up the portion, was gone just as fast! Big or small, they couldn't get enough of them! Thank you for the amazing brownie recipe, will never make them out of box again.

Was hoping for a little more of a cheesecake flavor/texture in the middle (I layered instead of swirled). It was GOOD though.. just expected a little more. Thank you!

These brownies are amazing! I thought they were too soft when they cooled but I stored them in the fridge and it really brings out the cheesecake flavor. They didn't last long.

I followed the ingredient measurements exactly, melted the chocolate & butter in the microwave and baked for 25 minutes.  These were too sugary for me and at 25 minutes of baking time they were still way too gooey.  After being in the freezer for a while, the brownies set.  If I were to make these again, I would definitely use less sugar.

I followed the recipe exactly as listed. Flavor was good and the cheesecake and chocolate chips where a nice combo. Not to sweet and my husband loved them. After cooking them I immediately put them in the fridge and let them cool and then cut them. No issues with texture and they cut well.

I really enjoyed these brownies. Followed the recipe exactly and baked mine for 25 minutes - they were perfectly fudgey and moist.  Kept in the fridge and they were great overnight!

I made this with plain Gluten-Free flour, because we have two Celiacs in my family, and it was still amazing!  I couldn't tell a difference in taste or texture at all.  Aside from that, I followed the directions almost exactly, and I also cut down on the chocolate chips in the cream cheese mix, as other reviewers recommended, and it turned out perfectly.  I was very impressed, as it was so easy and quick to make!  Thank you for the recipe, I will be making this again very soon!

so incredible & easy to make.  The brownies by themselves are so rich and moist & I don't know how the cream cheese tastes like cheese cake with so little work!!!

 The third time I made it, I really swirled the cream cheese mixture and the chocolate mixture way too much.  it turned out ok, but wasn't anything fantastic.  So the key for me is to make sure I barely swirl them & keep a distinction.

This recipe was on its way to a 2-star rating until we tasted the brownies; they are great, although very rich, and the taste is worth 5 stars. However, I ran into problems when baking them. I followed the instructions exactly (except for melting the chocolate and butter in the microwave) and baked for the full 30 minutes, until the top crinkled and edges pulled away, just as the recipe said (I  know my oven was the right temperature because I have an oven thermometer). I let them cool completely but when I cut them into squares and tried to remove them from the pan, it was impossible--still way too gooey and they just fell apart. I tried putting them in the freezer for a while in case they needed to be colder, but it didn't really help, so the whole pan went back in the oven (minus the mutilated one I had tried to take out) for another 25 minutes or so until they seemed to be done. After that, I was able to cut them into squares and separate them, but they were still very moist and soft. Definitely something to make only occasionally and eat in very small quantities, otherwise way too rich.

These brownies were awesome! The only thing I did differently was to melt the butter and chocolate chips for the batter in the microwave. These brownies were even better after being chilled in the fridge for a few hours.

These brownies are really good if you have a giant sweet tooth.  I sprinkled walnuts on the top before I baked them add a little extra something.  I think it added to the recipe nicely.

I made these brownies for a family reunion that we had last week. I followed the recipe exactly. However I left it in the oven for a lot longer than the suggested time and just checked it periodically until the middle wasn't all gooey but before the top burned. I personally didn't have any becuase I hate cheesecake, but everyone else loved them. They can't wait until the next time I bake them!

This recipes got thumbs up from my family. I baked in a 9 inch round pan.  The first time I made this we ate it slightly warm and thought it was good.  Then I refigerated the leftovers and had a piece and thought it was even better.

These were really good!  A word of caution though--they are really rich.  I usually love really rich foods but these were over the top rich!  A little piece goes a long way.  I thought that the chocolate chips that you add to the cream cheese mixture was a bit much but my husband insists that I leave them in when I make them again.

do not put the chocolate chips in the cheesecake portion. You would not be able to taste the cheesecake layer if you do. Also, bake 10 minutes longer than stated. I also cut down on the dirty dishes by melting butter and chocolate chips in microwave.

This is my go-to recipe for cheesecake brownies, but I gave it four stars because I made some changes. I cut down on the sugar and they are still plenty sweet, and I followed others' advice to omit the chocolate chips in the cheesecake mixture, otherwise the chocolate is too overpowering. They are so delicious, they disappeared immediately at the party I brought them to!

Wow!  Delicious brownies with cheesecake in every bite.  I added a dash of vanilla to both mixtures.  I baked an additional 10 minutes and should have baked longer but they were still wonderful.  I will definitely make these again!

I like the chocolate part of the brownie, but the cheese bit is just not for me. I would recommend you to add another 15 minutes of baking time. Sorry, but I didn't like the brownies. I would give it 2 stars. Thanks for the recipe though!

Delicious and so easy. I just microwaved the choc chips and butter for 30 secs instead of steaming them and it worked perfectly with less clean up :-). Great dish to impress with for social gatherings.

VERY DELICIOUS. They are so good!! After you bake them and they cool down you might wanna keep them in the fridge for a bit so the cheesecake wont be to creamy but like actual cheesecake.

The brownies are very good extremely dense and moist. The sugar level was perfect probably because I tweaked the chocolate chips. I  lessened the chocolate chips in the cheesecake mixture. I used 1/4 cup of chocolate chips instead 1cup and i still felt like it over powered the cheesecake flavour. So next time I'm leaving out the chocolate chips in the cheesecake mixture. And I found I had a good bit of cheesecake mixture left over. Other than that this recipe is a hit!!!!! Never making box brownies again! I gave this recipe a 3 only because it said Cheesecake Brownies but there was really no cheesecake taste a written.

I thought these were very good. My chocolate chips melted though...so my brownies didn't quite look like the picture.  I had to use an 8 by 8" pan so it added about 10 extra minutes to the bake time since the brownies were a bit thicker.

This turned out wonderfully for me! I used about half the remaining batter in the top layer, and that was more than enough for me. I also left out the chocolate chips in the cheesecake. I think the only thing I would change would be to add either frozen blueberries or frozen raspberries to the cheesecake mixture for a fruity touch!

Great recipe!

Wow this turned out even better than I expected! I did slightly reduce the sugar and put about half of the recommended amount of the chocolate chips into the cream cheese. It tasted AMAZING - not too sweet but quite chocolaty, soft and moist! Thank you so much for this recipe!

Took these to a bbq and were a big hit.  Kids and grandkids have given it their stamp of approval.  I didn't change a thing although I may experiment with a bit of carmel (butterscotch) chipits when I make again - just to see how it turns out.

Made these and thought the flavor of the brownie was great...very chocolate. I did as recommended in other reviews and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup in the brownie-plenty sweet. I cooked for over 30 minutes and still runny in the middle and the cream cheese swirls were brown and the top cracked. Still great flavor and will make again but work on temp/timing.

Excellent! Made it for a bake off and won! Best brownies there are. The cheesecake is a nice touch. These don't need frosting, they're great enough not to need it. The only thing, put about 3/4 cups of chocolate chips, it'll still be the bomb!

I gave this 4 stars because the cream cheese filling sounded bland. Normally I try a recipe before tweaking it, instead I added half a cup of peanut butter to the cream cheese mixture.  I also added chopped peanuts to the brownie mixture. So good! The other change I would make would be to bake the base layer of brownie for about 10 minutes, I found the bottom was a little soft for eating like a brownie, we had to eat them with a fork. Next time I make them I will be doubling the recipe, the 9" pan isn't enough!

I really don't like to give reviews that aren't phenomenal, but I'm doing this in the hopes of getting some advice to make it better. 

Followed the recipe to a T and I just know that it should have turned out great, but mine just refused to firm up. After 50 minutes in the oven the ends finally started to pull away a bit and the cheese on the ends were looking just about ready to crack (a bad thing for cheesecake) so I took it out, cooled it and refrigerated in the hopes that it would firm up there. 

Unfortunately, it's been in there for hours, the centre is still soggy and I will likely regretfully have to go out to get some store bought dessert for a party we're hosting tonight. 

I'd love to know what possibly went wrong and try these again as the idea of a cheesecake brownie still has me liking my lips.

Made them today for Thanksgiving! Wanted something different than the traditional desserts. What a great hit! Reduced batter sugar to 1/2 cup. Added the baking powder to the wet ingredients, and beat until creamy. Lastly, folded in King Arthur's flour (did not sift) along with 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips that I left out of the cream cheese filling, meaning that I only used 1/2 cup of mini chips with the filling, also I added about 1/2 cup of pecan pieces to the cheese filling...and a little vanilla to the batter.  I greased a 9x9 pan and baked for 25 minutes.  Turned out Perfect !  Will be making these again, & using whole wheat flour.  Thank you so much for the recipe !

The flavor on these is great... however, the middle was so gooey after the max amount of time that it tasted almost completely uncooked.  After refrigerating it it tasted much more like fudge than brownies.

Used splenda, light cream cheese and only 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  These were really easy and great.  Careful not to overcook- I checked mine at 25 min and thought they needed an extra 4 min or so- should have taken them out at 25 min.  The middle was the best part.  Definitely serve cold.  I loved the choc chips in the cream cheese layer- not sure why some reviewers suggest to leave them out.  The batter was hard to spread in the pan- there just wasn't a lot there but they turned out fine.  I frosted mine with rich choc frosting from this site.  Delicious.

I really liked these, but I would substitute the white sugar for powdered sugar instead. Use the same measurement but the volume will be less and not too sweet. Just a thought.

These are sooooooooooooo good.  Followed recipe exactly as written for first batch.  Second batch I used semi sweet chocolate chips in batter and used milk chocolate chips in cream cheese, we liked it both ways.  Thank You for sharing.

These are a bit too fudgy for my taste. Extremely dense and rich. They tasted good but could have used a little less intensity.

The first time I made these I felt like I was cheating at baking, these are that good, and that easy to make. If I could I'd made them every day, they're that good. Based on other reviewers comments I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup for the brownie part, and I only used 1/3 cup chocolate chips for the cream cheese part; both changes were perfect. The cream cheese mixture can be a little bit tough to spread if it isn't warm enough, so I let mine sit on the preheating oven beforehand, which worked well. Only other thing I did differently was I added a tsp of vanilla to the chocolate butter mixture. Amazing recipe, thank you so much!!

I can't decide how I feel about these. They were tasty, but not super chocolate-y. Mine ended up being more cake-like out of the oven and we ate them forks. Then after they were refrigerated they were almost fudge-like. It kind of confused me and I can't figure out which version I like better. If you're okay with that, it makes for a different sort of dessert (which was what I was looking for). 

I melted the chocolate chips in the microwave and used only 1/2 cup chocolate chips in the cheesecake part. I was worried about how they would look since the chocolate didn't spread very well over the cream cheese, but with the marbling it turned out surprisingly attractive. It was tasty and easy to make-other people enjoyed it more than I did, so I may end up making it again ;)

These turned out nothing like the picture. There doesn't seem to be enough brownie batter and there is too much cream cheese batter. I also had to bake for almost an hour. Maybe double up the brownie batter mix?

super moist and very chocolatey! couldn't taste the creamcheese layer, so will double next time and use less chocolate chips with the cream cheese.  I used dark chocolate chips in the cream cheese mixture only, and the contrast in flavors was amazing! just a few too many chips. been looking for homemade brownie recipes for a while (no more box mixes!), and this is a keeper.

My guests thought these were good, but I was disappointed.  With a title Cheesecake Brownies, I would expect the cream cheese flavor to stand out more, but it just blended right in.  Also, the cream cheese didn't stay in the middle; It seemed the brownie batter was too heavy and it sunk so the cream cheese layer became the top layer.

Super easy and foolproof! Tastes so much better than the box, but not much more effort. Melt butter and choc chips in the microwave. This will forever be my go-to brownie recipe!

I made these last night for a luncheon we are attending and they are absolutely awesome. They are super fudgy and  decadent. The only thing I did different was that I used powdered sugar instead of regular sugar because it was all I had in the house. They still came out perfect. If you follow the directions to the letter they will yield some of the best brownies you ever had. This one is a definate keeper.

Really delicious - made as is and they turned out beautifully.  I thought 16 servings for a 9" pan seemed like a lot, but you wouldn't want to cut them any bigger - they're very rich!  Will make again, won't change a thing.

HOLY BROWNIE BATMAN!  Easy and delicious.  I agree, do not use the chocolate chips in the cheesecake mixture.  No chunky cheesecake for me.  BUT,  I do recommend using that 1 cup of chocolate chips to make (1/2 recipe) of the Sour Cream Ganache from this site.  One half of this ganache recipe drapes the baked brownies to perfection.  I used a square springform pan lined with parchment--baked the brownies--frosted with ganache.  After a cooling in the refrigerator, I was able to easily remove and cut the brownies into bite-size morsels of heaven.  Using dark chocolate chips in the ganache makes for a fabulous Truffle Cheesecake Brownie.  Thanks for the inspiration.

SOOOOO very good!!! And so very easy. I melted the chocolate and butter in the microwave. And I accidently baked it in a 8x8 pan, so I had to cook mine about 10-15 minutes longer. I was worried it wouldn't be baked all the way since it was hard to tell when it was done, but it came out PERFECT. They didn't even last a day at our house. So I'll be making them again this weekend :) Thank you for sharing!!!

Fantastic. Cut the sugar in brownies to 1/4 c and added vanilla as it seemed to be missing something when I tasted the batter. That did it! I also put slightly fewer choc chips in the cream cheese filling than called for (maybe 3/4 c?) but it was still plenty. These were just as delicious when made with splenda and reduced fat cream cheese!

I thought these were ok.  There were pretty easy to make which was good. They were good but a boxed set of brownies tastes better to me.  I think I'll try to make them one more time without adding the chocolate chips to the cream cheese mixture... and maybe make a little more of the cream cheese mixture.  That's what I love about cream cheese brownies and you could hardly taste it because of the chocolate chips.

I think that the recipe is great however the amounts are off.  I doubled the brownie batter because I really could not spread half of the batter and cover the bottom of an 8x8 pan.  I did cut the sugar down in the brownie batter as for other reviewers suggestions.  Next time I will double everything and still use an 8x8 pan.

Delicious! I followed the recipe and it turned out great. A friend of mine will make if using splenda instead of sugar and I really look forward to tasting her as well. For those having diabetis, it could turn out great as well.

WOW! I have made these so many times since I stumbled upon this recipe.. delish! I, too, half the sugar in the chocolate portion. I make cupcakes and I find that I barely have enough batter to put one layer of the chocolate and one layer of the cream cheese mixture.. but they turn out fabulous.. thanks, DEE!

Wonderful recipe. Easy and easy to adjust. I used white chocolate chips in the cream cheese mixture.  I also served squares warmed up in microwave with a dallop of cherry pie filling for a special dessert with a small scoop of ice cream!

I was a bit worried that these might be too sweet so I cut the chocolate morsels in the cream cheese by 1/2. I kept the other ingredients the same. In order to get a strong cream cheese presence I spread a very thin layer of the chocolate batter on the bottom and then added the cream cheese in the middle. I then put the majority of the batter on top. This covered the top without me having to "swirl"the cream cheese in. When I bite into the brownie there is a distinct middle cream cheese layer. Yum!

A keeper! I taught a Holiday Cooking class for middle school kids, they all wanted the recipe. The one thing I changed was to melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave.  Some reviewers said it was too sweet, and I agree that you could cut back the sugar a bit with no harm to the flavor. But it was still good as presented.

These are the best brownies I've ever had! I can't believe that I made them, I didn't think that I could bake. My batter was SUPER thick, it was hard to get it to spread ontop of the cheesecake mixture. I did end up cookng them a little longer than 30 mintues, I got busy and forgot about them but they were perfect. I can't believe how easy it was to make homemade brownies not out of the box.  I did as other reviewers did and melted the butter and chocolate chips in the microwave. WOW will make these again Thanks.

Wow these were rich. Upon reading reviews I cut sugar to 1/4 C and reduced the chocolate chips in the cream cheese part to 1/2 C.

Delicious!  Good job Dee!  Easy to make and really good from the fridge; didn't expect to enjoy them cold but they are really scrumptious!  I did cut back on the sugar to 1/4 cup like others and they are perfect.  I thought they might be more chewy but turned out more like cake brownies but still really good.  Not too sweet.  I baked mine for 25 mins and they turned out great.

These tasted very good. My only complaint is that they were very hard to cut into neat looking Squares, they just fell apart. Great for eating at home but would be tough taking to a party ect. Overall great though!

This is an awesome recipe! I melted the chocolate in the microwave with the butter...its so much simpler to do. I did cut down the flour to 1/4 cup as I like my brownies to be fudgey without the added density.   NOTE: make sure u refrigerate these before eating! They're merely a 3.5/5 while warm...but a definite 5+/5 when refrigerated!   Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely decadent! I just made initially for a family get together but, my sweets loving family devoured the first pan so now I'm making more. I made absolutely no changes to this recipe and I have to say these are even better than my mother's coveted brownie cheesecake (but, we'll keep that our little secret 8) Thank you from the bottom of my stomach, this recipe is a definite keeper!

I made these in a 9x13 pan so I doubled the brownie part but not the cream cheese part, next time I'll double that too. The first time I made these I put the chocolate chips in the cream cheese, but that made it a little too rich, I'll omit those next time. The second time I made them, I didn't use the flour as one person suggested (so that I could make them gluten free for my cousin). She was in heaven!- Though they were a little gooey. They definately taste better once they've cooled down, especially the next day! Fantastic dessert!

Perhaps the best dessert I have ever made, and I have made a LOT of desserts!

I only had 4 oz. of cream cheese on hand, so I halved the sugar and chocolate chips that go with the cream cheese mixture, and it is still amazing.

I want to try next time with either peanut butter in the cream cheese, or using some peanut butter chips.

this is ABSOLUTELY YUM YUM YUM!! I am a boxed borwnie buyer b/c I can never make them from scratch the way I like them to taste. I thought I would give this a try since it had cream cheese, something different in it, and I am sooo glad I did!! the texture and flavor was phenomenal, and it was kind of cakey and cooked enough around the edges, and still a lil gooey and chocolately in the middle. A favorite for my recipe book!!! Thank you:)

OMG, this is so wonderful. It is a perfect balance of bittersweet brownie and sweet creamy cheesecake. If you have taste for brownie only, do not make this rec because it probably won't satisfy you. But if you want to experiment with brownies this is a great rec to try. I did reduce chips in cheesecake layer to 1/2 cup. Can't stop eating this.

These brownies are amazing.  My mother-in-law, an avid baker, said they were the best brownies she had ever had!  I follow the directions exactly and they always turn out perfectly.  I have made them with chocolate cream cheese as well-very good if you are a chocolate-lover!

This was a great recipe! My family loved them. They are super good served well chilled. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I think there are too many chocolate chips in the cheesecake batter...They kind of took over. Will make again, and cut the choc chips in half.

These are really good. I didn't give it a full 5 stars because as others have mentioned, the cheesecake taste gets muddled by all of the chocolate. I didn't mix the chocolate chips in the cheesecake layer, but I added some on top.

Turned out yummy, but I really was wanting to taste more cheesecake than I did; could barely get the flavor at all. I think I'll make it again and add more. Good, solid base recipe, though.

Delicious!  I wouldn’t change a thing about this recipe.  Completely chilling in the refrigerator is a must for the best flavor.  Great as is and we’ve also topped with a scoop of ice cream.

inner side never gets spongy creamy when you follow the steps in the recipe. I  had to add some flour( a remarkable amount) to ticken it, otherwise the white part was fluid.

I did not add the chocolate chips for the cream chees and I used dark cooking chocolate as a substitute for chocolate chips. But it turned out very good and sweetness is moderate. Definitely making this again. Thank you for the recipe.

Changes: used (mostly) baker's chocolate instead of chocolate chips (didn't have *quite* enough baker's chocolate so made up the difference with chocolate chips); used vegetable shortening because I'm out of butter and I need to use up the shortening anyway; melted the chocolate and shortening in the microwave instead of on the stove; after reading other reviews, chose to leave out the chocolate chips in the cheesecake batter. Pretty easy recipe when you melt the chocolate in the microwave instead of on the stove. I found the brownie batter quite stiff so it was very difficult to achieve a "swirl" after adding the top layer of brownie. They turned out delicious, though I was surprised to find after letting them cool for a couple hours that the brownie swirled into the cheesecake and some of the bottom layer of brownie was still raw - which I'd actually be fine with if this was something I was just eating myself, but I did plan on giving some of them away. I put them back in for another 20 minutes, until the cheesecake looked like it was almost overdone, but the brownie just didn't want to cook (and normally with my stove I have to take things out a few minutes before the minimum recommended time). So I guess I won't be giving them away unless they magically firm up in the fridge overnight. Maybe I'll try them as cupcakes next time. update: after being in the fridge overnight, they did firm up enough to cut into nice squares, but the flavour of the brownie isn't as good cold.

too sweet! althogh I used dark chochlate chips and half of the required amonut by the recipe and also a littel bit  less suger than the recipe. Next time I cut the sugur added to chees to one third and would not add chochlate chips to the cheese as well. Also would cut the suger amount of the batter to half. The texture was OK.

its incredible. really fudgy and chocolaty. but.. make sure you half the chocolate chips in the cheesecake batter. its great warm or cold but i prefer it cold so you can really feel the crunch of the chocolate chips. cut into small squares as it is quite decadent and rich. everyone that tried it absolutely loved it and asked for the recipe. its a keeper.

Very sweet. Cut down on the sugar. No need to melt the chocolate and butter over the stove, just warm up in the microwave. Very messy, turned around and my kitchen was dirty. Other than that, pretty good, will make again with a few tweaks.

I liked the recipe but found that the cheesecake part was very "cheesecakey" and there wasn't nearly enough brownie to do a thick bottom or even a start on a top layer.

The brownies tasted good, but similar to other reviews, the cheesecake gets lost in the chocolate and just tastes like a really rich brownie.  If make again, will just increase the amount of cheesecake and avoid the chocolate chips in the cheesecake mixture.

Very good and rich!  I chose to refrigerate the remaining bars due to the cream cheese layer.  Due to the reviewers comments, I reduced the sugar in the brownie layer and reduced the chocolate chips in the cheesecake layer.  The flavor was good overall.

Made it exactly the way recipe said, except melting choc and marg in microwave.  It was very moist, could easily taste the cream cheese.  Was easy to make.  If a person wants less choc. you could leave it out of the cream cheese, and less sugar if you want less sweetness. Loved it.

Omg these are the best! I added some pretty sweet chocolate chips, so it was a bit too sweet. I would really appreciate it if you would add how long we need to put it in the microwave to melt. Other than that, this recipe was amazing!

The flavor isn’t bad in these but I think next time I will use a different brownie recipe. The brownies from this recipe are almost cake-like. I prefer mine more fudgy and chewy.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I couldn't taste the cream cheese as much as I expected to be able to and I thought they were too chocolaty.  I did put chopped pecans and walnuts in the recipe because a brownie isn't a brownie in my book without nuts in it.

Loved it! This was a great recipe, but I do recommend you eat a little at a time. My kids we’re bouncing off the wall...they enjoyed it that much. LOL

This tasted like excellent, chewy brownies with a hint of cheesecake. This was very good, but I like more of a cheesecake taste. Next time I will try doubling the amount of cream cheese.

I followed others’ suggestions and cut both the chocolate chips in the cheesecake and sugar in the brownie portion in half. They came out kind of cake-like but once they were chilled, they were absolutely delicious!  I will definitely make these again!

I've made it twice now, and it's very good! The changes I make is, no chocolate chips in the cream cheese mixture, reduce chips in the brownie mixture to 3/4 cup, and reduce sugar in brownie mixture to 1/3 cup. Then it's perfect for my family. Will make again and again with my changes.

Had this recipe printed since 2014 but never made. Made for a retirement party & was a success. Not that difficult to make, but will make one change next time out of preference. I'm going to cut back 1/4c choc chips in the cream cheese mixture. Hubs & I thought it had to much choc, which is something since we love chocolate. May go back if we don't like it with less choc chips though. Remarks from a few co-workers were"don't want to know the calorie count"  & "can't go wrong with cream cheese". Will make again, just not often. Also had to bake longer & don't know why cause usually my stuff is done earlier or on time of recommended baking times.

Hm, I'm not sure why, but this was just ok for me. It seemed a little dry, so perhaps I overbaked it? Not a lot of flavor, which seems pretty contrary to what other reviewers have found. I will keep trying different cheesecake brownie recipes.

These had a wonderful soft, chewy texture and rich chocolate flavor.  I melted my butter and chocolate in the microwave to save time. The next time I will add a little vanilla to the cream cheese mixture.  Great recipe.

I'm like a recent cook that made it.  I followed recipe exactly and it was gooey and way too rich.  I preheated my oven, which is precisely on temperature, baked it 25 min., it looked brown and crinkly and pulled away from the sides, so I figured it was done.  I cut it in squares and took it to a party.  The outside edges were fine, not done in the middle.  Ended up throwing 1/2  to 3/4 of it away.

I can't believe I'm saying this, but my family found this recipe to be too rich - and yes, we are chocolate and brownie people!  They wouldn't even finish it.  Also, the cream cheese mixture is just a little too sour.  Maybe adding a little more sugar to it would help it blend better with the rest of the dessert.  I thought I would love this recipe but it's only so-so.  I'm not sure I'll make it again (sorry!).

This was awesome.  This time I used white chocolate for the center layer.  It was a little sweet.  The texture was gooey and very tasty.  My girlfriend loves this.  She is addicted.

I made this recipe only one time. I liked a lot but I did faced one problem and my brownies didn't came up perfect.  I think butter separated from chocolate after i added other ingredients. I heated chocolate and butter on double boiler, i mixed well till smooth and added the rest of ingredients and i noticed that consistency of batter was clumpy. It happened to me before with other recipes when i was making ganache. It was easy to fix with ganache when butter separated but with this recipe i couldn't do anything about it since i already mixed the rest of ingredients. Next time i will try to do it perfect but i am not sure where is my defect. Here are changes i did to the recipe:
I used bittersweet chocolate chips, had to add an extra egg to the batter.  I used only 1/4 of cup of sugar for both batter and cream cheese filling.  I loved chocolate chips in creme cheese filling, used like 1/4 of the cup not 1 cup. I also used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour.

Very delicious and even better the next day.  A little gooey to eat before they were chilled; much better after a few hours in the refrigerator.

WOW!  I didn't expect these to be creamy in the center, but the cream cheese & chocolate chips are the perfect addition to brownies!  Used Ghirardelli chips, and an 8x8 pan instead of 9".  These are amazing!

Made recipe as is first time. My 5 star rating is for original recipe and for my changes/additions.
My change due to not having quantity needed of semi-sweet chocolate chips at 11 pm:
Used 4oz bar of bittersweet baking chocolate with the butter
Used 1/4 cup of additional sugar (brown)
My additions: 1 cup mini marshmallows, 1 cup chopped walnuts(added to cream cheese mixture)
vanilla paste and cinnamon to taste(to chocolate mixture)
My coworkers loved them.

I've made these twice now, first time followed the recipe to a T and thought they were just OK.   Second time I didn't add the chocolate chips to the cream cheese mixture but did add 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice.  It made the "cheesecake" taste pop a lot more.   One other tip:  line the baking pan with tin foil and grease that.  Much easier clean up!

I was really pleased with these brownies.  After reading prior reviews I decided to omit the chocolate chips in the cream
cheese.  What I liked is that they were creamy but not overly sweet.

I just made my second batch of these for my crochet group tonight!  They are gonna love them!  These are soooo rich and full of goodness!  The only changes I made were to add pecans to the top and use half a bar of Lindt 90%cacoa in place of some of the chips.  I left the chips out of the cream cheese mixture this time, because I thought it was overkill in the first batch.  I've always wanted to make brownies from scratch and this recipe is the the One!

This recipe was so easy and turned out great! I used dark chocolate chips instead of semi sweet just based on my chocolate preference. Next time I would make more of the cheesecake mix to get closer to a 50 50 ratio (again just based on my preference), but these were a big hit! Thanks for posting.

Very nice tasting brownie, only issue is the batter wasnt enough in qty.  I used a bit more creamcheese 280g to be precise. Meltes choc with butter, flour, baking powder and salt i would double. Either way spectacular tasting. Kudos

These brownies were really, really yummy! My sister pretty much ate the entire batch in one sitting - they were that good! My only complaint is just the result I got when making them. This is probably just my own fault and I probably just didn't balance out the layers properly, but instead of brownies with cheesecake, I ended up with something more like chocolate cheesecake squares. The marbling process just didn't work for me and I mixed the brownie batter and the cheesecake mix together. Probably just my fault, but that didn't take away from the taste! Moist, yummy, and definitely will be attempting again in the future!

They tasted alright, but there was not enough brownie dough and it was veeeeeery sticky. I needed to put all my dough on the bottom and the cheesecake part on top.

(Ps. If you want to do what I did, make sure you bake the brownies for at least 45 minutes)

These brownies were very good, moist and chocolatey.  You really can't taste the cheesecake, but they were still delicious. I think if I make the cheesecake center again, I'll double it. My son thinks I should try these brownies next time by putting graham crackers crumbs and marshmallow fluff in the middle???

These were waaay to rich to eat while warm for my family, but we enjoyed them more the next day when completely cooled. Things I will do differently next time:
•Use 1/2C mini Choco chips (instead of the full cup of regular) or Omit the Choco chips in the cram cheese mixture all together. 
•Add a tsp of lemon juice and maybe some zest to the cream cheese to enhance the cheese cake taste. 
•Add another TBS of butter to the melted chocolate chips for batter.  When I added the flour my batter was really dry and stiff even for brownies. 
Hope this helps! And if you like super sweet and rich then just use the original recipe. But If you really want to tast the flavors mix I think you will enjoy these adjustments.

I can't eat these because I can't have dairy, but I made them for mother's day and everyone was saying how delicious they were ?? I did cut the sugar down since other reviews said they were kind of sweet and they said they were perfect not to sweet at all!!

This recipe makes way too much cheesecake topping.   I recommend doubling the brownie batter and preparing in a 13x9 pan and making the recipe amount for the cheesecake topping.  I also recommend using dark chocolate chips for color and flavor and adding a tsp of vanilla to both the brownie batter and the cheesecake topping.

This recipe is the BEST!  These brownies are delicious and the plate is empty shortly after putting them on the table.  This will be my only brownie recipe from now on.  So much better than a boxed mix.

Hands down the BEST brownies made, with everyone begging for the recipe. Used white chocolate chips and added vanilla in the cream cheese mixture, and used dark chocolate chips for the brownie batter. Possibilities and variations are endless. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I made these today.  I followed the recipes as submitted and they turned out great.  Since I don't have an 8x8 pan, I did as another reviewer suggested and made them in a cupcake pan and used the paper liners.  The recipe made 12 generous sized brownie cupcakes.  I baked them for 20 minutes which was just right in my oven.  I will be making these often.

Love these brownies! They're always a hit. 
I melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave. And use mini chipits for the cheesecake mixture to keep them more uniform.
I have also made this recipe using gluten free flour and it works very well.

I've made this recipe 3 times now and it's a keeper. Do yourself a favor and get organized before you start to help rein in the mess. There are lots of dishes potentially involved. Other than that no changes need to be made unless it's personal preference. I substituted walnuts for the second cup of chocolate chips and that was a major win. If organized, this is a very simple recipe to impress with.

I made this recipe 3x now. So yummy. I made a couple of small changes to make it easier. I melted the choc chip with the butter in microwave, I blended the softened cream cheese, in with all the other ingredients.I just mix everything in one bowl. They are so moist and yummy. By making them this way I didn't have the marble effect as in the picture, however the taste is delicious. Thank you for sharing.

They were not exactly my cup of tea, they were a little bitter for my personal taste but others who tried them liked them a lot, I'll be making them again! Also, the recipe was really easy to follow, I appreciate that.

I've made these a few times, and they always turn out well. They're always a big hit! Highly Recommended - just make sure to split the brownie batter up evenly to make sure that the cream cheese filling is mostly covered.

Made these Gluten Free with Bob's Red Mill AP GF Flour. Used 1/4c sugar in the brownie mix instead of 1/2 and added a little vanilla to the cheesecake batter. They are AWESOME!!!!! These are the best scratch brownies I've ever made... even better than all the ones with regular wheat flour!

I saw this recipe and decided to try it instead of my usual brownie recipe for an event where I was providing the dessert.  They were a hit!   I was concerned whether I would have enough, but they were so rich, and rose to be taller than I expected, that cutting them into 16 pieces instead of 12 worked perfectly.  They sliced and came out of the pan with very little crumbling.

It is very good.  I used Guittard chocolate chips so I melt them in a microwave for 2 minutes with 50% power.  It worked well and easier that way.  Brownie stays moist and rich.  Much better than a box mix.

I've made these many times and with excellent results. I swap out one cup of chocolate chips for 2/3 cup mini chips when I want to ease back a bit on richness. I never use box brownie mix anymore. These are easy to make and bakery quality!

Loved this recipe.  To me, it was a great fudgey brownie. I reduced the sugar by half and found it sweet enough.  I also really reduced the chocolate chips after reading other reviews but next time will add more chocolate chips.  These brownies really do need to be refrigerated, though.

So delicious!  I decided to throw some extra milk chocolate chips in to melt with the semi sweet, and it was so good! The family loved them! Also ran out of semi sweet for the cream cheese mixture so just added milk chocolate but not too many as this recipe is all ready so rich.

For my first batch, I followed this recipe to a tee. It was very good, and I took it to a girls game night where they were a huge hit. I used a bigger pan so I was only able to create the two layer effect(brownies on bottom, cheesecake on top). Next time I make them I may alter the flour/sugar a bit but otherwise I definitely recommend this recipe! Thanks for the good eats :)

It's OK. Far too sweet for my tastes, but surprisingly light as a brownie. I thought it would be thick and heavy -- but not so. Texture is perfect. Taste is overwhelming if you're not a chocolate addict. That being said, I think my husband would rate it a 5 star.

Amazing!  The only thing I will change is to double (or triple) the brownie part and make in a 9 x13 pan.  Very very good recipe.

SO yummy and rich.  I baked this in a 9" round springform pan, it turned out great!  A little on the sweet side though, I forgot to cut the sugar a bit.  The batter consistency freaked me out a bit (thick and somewhat slimy) but it cooked up just fine.

I added only a 1/4 cup of sugar to the batter mixture, and thought it was okay if a little bland on the sweetness. However the biggest problem for me was the lack of liquid in the brownie portion! I did the recipe exactly (except I used the microwave to melt the chocolate/butter mixture) and it was quite gooey and hard to work with. It baked all right, but an extra egg or some veggie oil would do wonders for the recipe. I also used muffin cups which worked well.

I made these last night.  After they came out of the oven, I let them cool for about a half hour, tried them and they were "ok", it woulda been a 3-4 star recipe.  I put them in the fridge over night and just ate another one moments ago... and WHOA... so much BETTER!!!    I would recommend cooling them in the fridge before serving!  It's like they were cakey last night, and more chewy today.

First time make homemade brownies, I did decrease the the chocolate chips to 1/2 c and I used dark choco chips to decrease sweetness.  These were amazing and requests for the following week once tasted.  I am officially done with box mixes these were so easy and tastier.

Easy recipe, tastey, very chocolatey. Bottom didn't solidify as well as it should have even baking at maximum baking time. Kinda stayed molten cakey for me. Still good stuff though.

I've definately had better brownies. I had trouble swirling the layers and getting the nice marbled look, I don't know what I did wrong. This is the first recipe I've had trouble with. Weird, brownies seems like a no-brainer.

Turned out perfect.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I did use a smaller sq pan to have really thick brownies and had to bake for almost 50 minutes but ever so good!!!  I did refrigerate to cool down but enjoyed them better at room temperature - Thanks for a great, easy recipe.

This is the best! It's so easy to make! I followed another member's suggestion and used only 1/4 cup of sugar. I also cut down on the flour and used only 1/3 of a cup. Make sure to leave it inside the refrigerator for a few hours before eating. It taste better cold than warm.

I really wasn't too impressed with these, sorry. I was expecting "fudgy" from the description and these were definitely cake-like and kind of bland somehow. They aren't bad at at all, just not good to me. Thanks for sharing with us! :)

Excellent recipe.  I followed exactly but like a previous reviewer, made the brownies in a muffin tin so that I could leave the cream cheese mixture out of a few of them for my hubby.  This will be my new go to recipe for brownies.  So easy and delish.  No more box mix for us.

I found the semisweetness of the chocolate to be a bit overpowering and think these could be greatly improved by substituting milk chocolate instead. It also took me about 45 minutes before these were baked through. They do look pretty.

I used a 1/2 cup chocolate chips in the cheesecake filling instead of a full cup.  These were the best brownies I've ever made.  I made them for a bake sale and had to make a second batch because we ate the first!  I also doubled the recipe and it worked fine, but took close to an hour to bake. Fantastic!

Best brownies ever! I have made this over and over and people always say the same - even friends that don't like cheesecake like these brownies...only change I made was the sugar, I start with about half of what the recipe calls for and then add it to taste...thank you so much for posting this recipe!

Pretty darn good! I had to get used to the taste but found myself coming back for more. I did find it a little sour, so I might try more sugar next time (but I'm probably being picky).

I've made these with both milk and semi-sweet chocolate chips, and either way is fantastic!  I omitted the chocolate chips from the cream cheese mixture, but aside from that I didn't change a thing.  The first time I made these I baked the bottom brownie layer for five minutes before adding the cheesecake and top brownie layers, and I found that to be an unnecessary step.

Family all liked this.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was I used the microwave to melt the butter and chocolate chips.  Much easier way to do it.  Thanks, will make these again.

Delicious.  These tasted like an ooey gooey chocolate cheesecake. Yumm.  I am a big fan of peanutbutter and chocolate, so next time I am forgoing the creamcheese mixture and adding my own peanutbutter concoction...1/2 cup peanutbutter, 1 cup powdered sugar and 1/2 cup reeses peanutbutter chips-can't wait to try this.

These brownies were pretty good, but I had difficulty distinguishing the cream cheese flavor. It was overwhelmed by the chocolate, which in itself isn't a bad thing! These freeze well.

Wow chocolate overload! Very good and extremely chocolatey.  The cream cheese flavor is a bit over powered by the chocolate, but it is moist and gooey and delicious.

These are the best! Not too cakelike and just the right amount of chewy goodness to satisfy the brownie craving. 

I baked these for 40 minutes in an 8x8 pan at just a little under 350 (my oven's calibration is off) and they came out juuuuuust right.

Meh. Kind of a pain to assemble (top layer).  Took forever to bake, and the end result was too cakey, not brownie enough.  Had to top 'em with some frosting to make them edible for the guys who were here for Wii night, but even with frosting, there still was over half a pan left. If you want a killer recipe in the same vein, hit up the one on here simply called:  Cheesecake Brownies.

I have been on a search for a brownie recipe that called for choco chips.  So often I want to make homemade brownies and only have choco chips on hand.  I agree with another reviewer, these need longer than 30 minutes to bake.

Very good! This is such a rich brownie, next time I will use only 1 cup of choc chips. turned out fudgy just the way I like them. However, took 45 min to bake, after 30 min it was still gooey in the middle. Easy to make, a keper!

The brownies themselves are decent.  I like my brownies fudgy and these are somewhere in the middle, not all that fudgy, but not cakey either, which I think is thanks to the cheesecake batter swirled in.  The cheesecake batter is very good, I would give that part of the brownie 5 stars if rating seperately.  These won't get tossed out, but I'll either try another brownie batter recipe next time or I'll play around with this one.  The brownies are by no means overdone so that's not a problem.  After being refrigerated they are a little fudgy, so I recommend them cold.  

Still searching for my perfect fudgy brownie recipe!

I made this for the first time this week and they were great. My husband can't have any sugar so I used Splenda instead of sugar and Dove sugarfree chocolate's instead of choc. chips. It turned out great.

These taste terrific! I accidentally made them in a 9x13 pan instead of 9x9, which made it harder to spread the layers, and also made the brownies kind of thin, but they taste great. I bet they're even better when you bake them in the right size pan!

These brownies are not your stale variety!  Very moist and gooey.  I will make them again.  This is a dressed up brownie recipe sure to impress.  Be sure to cook to completion by testing with a toothpick, mine needed a bit more time.

this recipe was really good! very different. it came out really moist and delicious. the only thing i didn't like was that most of my cheesecake mixed with the chocolate, so it didn't taste as cheesecakey as i would like. any suggestions?
