I took the suggestion to cut way back on the chili powder - Im thinking 3 tablespoons is a typo.

I found it easy to make and a taste unlike the things I usually make.  It makes a good amount of sauce, so I think you could add more chicken.   I also think it would work nice as a buffet dish if you shred the chicken after cooking.   I used boneless skinless breast - I was surprpzed that it cooked in an open pan.

I also added some cinnamon and a few choc chips - I dont know wether that made a differnce or not - I think its the peanut butter that gives it the taste and texture.

I really liked this recipe. I used chicken breasts without the skin. Next time I will roll  them in between two sheets of wax paper to make them thinner so it will cook faster in the middle and not dry out.

The sauce was great. I subsituted ordinary chili powder with diced authentic pasilla negro chili pods. Yum!

We all found this to be delicious. I reduced the chili powder by a third and increased the peanut butter by a third and used a mild salsa.  The flavor was superb, it had some heat but not so much as to turn my wife off.

This was a very good recipe, but I would have preferred a little more spice.  I also added ground cloves (about a 1/2 tsp), because I like clove in my mole.

I really liked this recipe, and my fiance did too even though he won't eat chicken mole in a restaurant! This is different from any that I've had dining out, because it made alot more sauce (which was great with rice). I used skinless chicken breasts and thighs to reduce the fat. This was great and the sauce has just the right "bite" to it, not too spicy or sweet. We had it last night but it was even better today after marinating in the sauce overnight. Does not even taste like there is salsa in it...I will definitely make it again.

The rating I gave this recipe was after I "doctored" it up. I have never had mole before so I don't know how it is supposed to taste, but when I first tried this recipe it was awful! It was bitter and just tasted bad. Since I hate to throw food out I played around with the recipe a litte. I added some sugar to get rid of the bitter taste. I also added some more salsa and peanut butter,then I added some chopped walnuts, nutmeg, cinnamon, ground cloves, and a little more chicken broth to thin it up some. It actually turned out to be pretty good afterwards. I will probably make this again but with these modifications to the recipe.

This was amazingly good!!!!!!! I've had really good mole before (Mexican gourmet restaurant), and this comes in a close and respectable second! I will be making this again on a regular basis :-) My one suggestion is that the spiciness level of the salsa will REALLY manifest itself in the mole, so use mild at first until you are sure you want something spicier.

One of my new favorite recipes, I make it at least once a month. The chocolate, peanut butter, and salsa give this recipe a full, robust flavor.

I was in the mood for Mole but never had made it. Instead of calling family I tried this recipe and well...it was not ANYTHING near the real stuff.  I have family from all over Texas and Mexico and they all make Mole the same way...this recipe was not Mole.  It was good but if you are looking for The Real Mole dish, you are better off asking friends and family.

I have had real chicken mole and it doesn't taste anything like this. My family hated it. I thought it was edible however, it was way too spicy even for me and I like spicy food. I would consider making it again but I would reduce the chili powder. But still, it's nothing like the authentic chicken mole that I have had before.

Maybe my husband and I don't have sophisticated enough taste buds for this one, but we honestly threw the entire batch out and made something else for dinner.

I substituted 4 pieces of Mexican chocolate for the regular chocolate and used a heartier chili powder I picked up at a local Mexican grocery. Easy and quite tasty. It made a hit with visitors who were starved for Mexican food.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was!  Looking at the ingredients, you would never believe it!  We had company over and they loved it too!

I must admit that I had reservations on combining peanut butter, chocolate, and salsa, but somehow or another, it all came together in a delicious blend of flavor.  A nice twist from the same old, same old mexican food.
