Love the idea of the recipe, but there are a couple of suggestions I would make.    First, the cheddar is overwhelming, and this is coming from a gal who LOVES cheddar!  I will mix up the cheeses next time.  Some Monterey Jack to mix in maybe, to give a bit of heat.    Second, I will be cooking the quiche much longer next time.  I left it in 45 minutes, and it was a beautiful golden brown on top and the toothpick came out clean, but then... it was SO runny.  Not like a quiche at all.  Next time, I will add some flour to the mix, I think, and cook it at a lower temp for an hour+.    Still-- a great idea for a fish dinner that isn't boring, and remarkably easy and frugal to put together!  I never thought I would say that salmon quiche would be a go-to meal for busy nights, but once I tweak this a tad I am betting it will.

I made this without the crust because we have a family member who can't eat wheat. It turned out great!

Husband coming home, kids threatening to wake from their naps, and I having no idea what to cook for dinner.  This recipe to the rescue!  No changes made.  It is very easy and quick to make.  My husband called it phenomenal and said, "it brings energy to a very tired body at the end of the day." I matched it with "Never Fail Pie Crust II" half recipe.  This is a keeper.  Thank you!

I thought this quiche was excellent. The flavor and texture of the salmon goes well with the creamy egg/milk mixture.  I used some leftover baked salmon instead of canned and chopped green onions.  Also, because I didn't  have cheddar cheese, I used a combination of cream cheese, colby/jack, mozzarella and parmeson. So definitely try other cheeses if that is all you have. I'd bet this is more mixture than a standard frozen 9" crust will hold.  I used Pillsbury rolled pie crust in my 9" pie pan and it was a perfect fit.  Baked for at least 40 minutes.

5 stars for a great basic recipe. I adapted it to what I had on hand and what flavors I prefer: One 8-oz block of reduced fat cheddar was plenty, 1/3 shredded over the crust, 1/3 blended with the eggs, 1/3 sprinkled on top. I also used 1T dried onion instead of fresh, a pinch of dill with the s&p and omitted the parsley and sage. I also cooked it at least 50 minutes until it began to puff a little. I love that this recipe is written with a pinch of this, a pinch of that, because that's how I cook anyway!

Excellent recipe. To add some color and flavor, I added about a 1/3 cup of chopped peppers and mushrooms and decreased the milk to about 1 cup.

I used soy milk instead of the evaporated milk, and added a pinch of dill weed, then put the filling in a whole wheat pie crust.  Delicious!  We will be making this again!

This recipe is really good!  I had some leftover Salmon I wanted to use, found this recipe and it worked out perfectly!  I grated the cheese rather than cubed in the egg mixture and it turned out fine.  That and using fresh grilled salmon instead of canned were the only changes I made.  I will definately be making this one again.

Followed the recipe exactly.  First there was too much egg/cheese mixture to fit in the pie crust (used a deep dish 9 in. pie crust at that).  Baked for over an hour and it never did firm up to what a normal quiche should be.  Didn’t taste too bad, but  was runny.

I wasn't sure if I was going to like this, but I had leftover sockeye to use up. It was SO yummy! Used a ready-to-roll-out refrigerated crust. Didn't use the blender, just whisked the milk, eggs, spices(added some cayenne because I love it in quiches), and cheese.  I used shredded cheese: half mozzarella and half medium cheddar, and threw in a bit of feta. Layered the onions and fish in the bottom of the pie crust, then poured the egg and cheese mixture over it, sprinkling some reserved cheese on top. Also baked it about 10 mins longer until it started to puff a bit.

excellent recipe.  I used bought pie shells, and found it made enough for 2 pies.  I was out of salmon, so used a can of tuna (that was the only change I made) and it was delicious.

Great basic! Followed suggestion for only one cup milk, definitely needed seasonings to taste. I never do a pinch of anything and I added a can of crabmeat which added more seafood taste. Simple and yes to variations of cheeses. I used Monterrey and cheddar and grated parmesan on top with sprinkled black pepper. Half hour at 375 and half hour at 350 in glass pie plate, I never use a crust. very good!

OMG ... a wonderful recipe!!!  I love salmon but rarely have canned salmon.  Some canned salmon was on sale so I bought some.  This recipe caught my eye.  I basically followed the recipe ... but used a homemade pie crust.  Put the flaked salmon and cheddar cheese on unbaked pie shell.  Added the blended liquids w/ spices.  Baked for 20 minutes, then topped with grated Parmesan cheese and baked for another 20 minutes.  Lovely, lovely combination!  Boo hoo to the reviewer that sad cheddar cheese and salmon is not a good combination.  BTW, my grandfather was a commercial salmon fisherman in Astoria, OR.  Salmon is near and dear to my heart.  My mother lived into her early 90's because she probably had salmon every day of her life growing up.

I didn't follow the recipe but used it to determine how to season my salmon quiche.  I used all the seasonings mentioned.  Flavor is great!  I used less cheese than stated.  I baked a salmon fillet, lightly seasoned, to medium rare, instead of using the canned salmon.  I did not blend ingredients, just layered cheese on bottom, after coating crust with egg white.  Then baked salmon, then egg mixture(bit of milk and seasonings).  I used "Easy Pie Crust" by B1BMOM.  I wanted a high protein meal easy to take to work, this is perfect, and delicious!

I give this 4 stars because, while it was very yummy, I don't think cheddar is the best cheese to use with salmon. I made it a second time with smoked gouda, swiss, and feta and it came out amazing.

Great recipe to adapt from. My husband is British but I have never had a fish quiche or pie. We loved this. I had leftover baked salmon to use. I made the crust, shredded a 7oz bar of Asiago cheese. I used half & half, sprinkled w Dill weed & onions. Started w 35 minute bake time but needed 45.
A new staple recipe for sure. Thank you.

My family loved it. I used cream cheese and cheddar and an extra egg because some people said it was runny.I bought 2 deep dish pie shells and somehow the mixture of one pie fit in 2 so I just added an extra can of salmon and added a bunch of cheese until it was full.It was delicious.

Great recipe! I have made this several times with what I had on hand. I have used canned salmon in the past but last night I was rummaging through the freezer and found some old salmon patties. I thawed 3 of them, chopped them up and used that. I also used half n half instead of evaporated milk. I used dill instead of sage. I use all of the cheese. I don't put anything in the blender, I just chop everything up and pour into the pie crust. Came out fabulous! My husband had 3 pieces!

This is really delicious and very easy. I make two crusts, use one, and freeze the other, which I can use to make a spinach quiche later. I used low fat cheddar to cut down on the calories a bit, and the second time I made it used Eggbeaters. Both substitutions were quite good.

Tried it, loved it.  Couple minor modification due to lack of ingredients.  Used whole milk, layered 3 slices of American cheese over salmon before pouring other ingredients.  Baked 1/2 hour 1@ 375 and additional 1/2 hr @325.   Delicious, I also used no fail pie crust II, an all recipes favorite of mine.   Thanks for sharing!

I didn’t have cheddar cheese, so I used whatever cheese I had (was a mix of sliced cheeses). Why is it green? Because I blended spinach into it.)  my kids and I laughed at the sight and were afraid to try it. But looks are deceiving! It tastes great! (We nicknamed it “Shrek pie” because it has onions and layers in it!)

This is very tasty, but I had some problems with the recipe. The first time I tried it, the recipe produced FAR too much liquid. This time I tried it with about 6oz of block cheddar and 8oz evap milk, and it turned out just about perfect. I also had trouble with the temp and cooking time. I cooked it for an hour at 350 deg F and it came out very nice. I think I'll try it with pepperjack in the future to try to make it a little spicy.

I only had 8 ounces of evaporated milk so I added a half cup of 10% cream as well as adding about 1/3 cup gruyère and less cheddar since I had some on hand.  It was delicious and everyone loved it.  I will definitely make this one again.

This is a great recipe. I’ve made it a number of times. I use refrigerator pie crust. I use canned salmon (I like the Wild Planet planet brand because it is boneless and skinless.) I find I like it better if I don’t flake the salmon into small pieces. Leaving larger chunks allows the salmon taste to come through. I’ve added spinach and zucchini at times, but if you don’t cut back on the milk, the crust is soggy. I like to use fresh parsley. This recipe is such a great way to add salmon to your diet.

Tasted great!   But was way too much for an 11' piepan!   What  a mess!   And cooking time was 40 min.   not 30.  Will be making it again with changes.....

I make this pretty much as written.  I do add a bit of dried dill and dried cayenne when I have it.  As others have said, this is great with any mixture of cheeses, with fresh or canned salmon, and with or without a crust.  This is a favorite in our house, especially when served with homemade hot sauce.

I used fresh cooked and seasoned salmon. I kicked it up a notch with some chili powder and smoked paprika. Also added asparagus, mushrooms, spinach and onions. I took some advice from other reviews and did a cheddar and Monterey cheese combo as well. It did need 45 minutes. It was amazing.

I made this tonight for dinner using the recipe from Allrecipes magazine.  As another reviewer noted this took much longer to bake than the 35 minutes.  I added 20 more minutes to bake the center and get a clean knife.  The magazine recipe was crustless which was fine with me.  The husband liked it but I wasn't crazy about.  Probably won't make again.

I used leftover salmon, subbed gouda for the cheddar, and added the mayo/dill sauce I make for the salmon to the condensed milk (reduced accordingly).  It turned out really good.  My husband liked it -- hot or cold!!

The recipe was okay, maybe a bit bland.  It took 50 minutes to cook and 20 minutes set time to harden up.  The recipe makes slightly too much for a 9" pie.  I wouldn't use this recipe again.

Great recipe and it turned out well. I swapped out feta for cheddar and added some cooked spinach. Next time I will either up the egg or use less milk as it wasn't quite as firm as I like. Thanks for the idea Stef!

This is similar to the salmon quiche recipe in Nov., 2016 Allrecipes magazine.  That recipe does not use a crust and uses shredded cheddar cheese.  Made it with red salmon rather than pink salmon to make the dish significantly more nutritious.  Family raved about it.  Know that I can vary the type of cheese next time if I choose.

Sounds weird, looks weird but enjoyed every bite! I made this with the exception of using frozen salmon fillets and shredded cheddar. It's not the most attractive quiche but it's so good! I made this thinking I would hate it but I had salmon and eggs that needed a purpose. I'm making it for brunch this Thanksgiving.

I found this recipe in the AllRecipes Magazine that I received.    The magazine has the recipe printed to be made without the crust.    Since one serving is under 300 calories and I am dieting, I decided to give it  a try.  I'm glad I did.  Even my husband enjoyed it.  I will be keeping this recipe in my file to be made again and again.    Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!

Make sure you cook longer its about 40 to 45 minutes. Drain salmon well. Cover edges so crust doesnt burn. Very delicious make with asparagus. Must let sit for 30 minutes to firm up.

Made the recipe from the magazine last week, which does not include a crust. Loved it! This recipe is slightly different, with crust, higher temp, cubed not shredded cheese. Will definitely make again, so good I shared the recipe just now with others. I had no sage (?!?), so used an Italian seasoning instead for parsley and sage - definitely ok to improvise! Love the ideas of substituting smoked gouda, gruyere or Tuna next time, thanks for that tip!

Needs really deep dish crust, not the so called ones from grocery store.  Also would cook crust a bit first.

Used one cup evaporated milk as suggested by others and with shredded cheese.  No need to use blender, just mixed everything and baked for 45 min.  I also used tomato instead of onion.  Result is a great tasting healthy quiche.  Will definitely make again.

Used mozzarella, cheddar and parmesano on top of the crust. Then added mix of salmon and diced onion. Mixed eggs with a mixture of 1 cup of half and half and mil and added some cheese to it. Finally toped with a bit of extra cheese. Baked for 55 min. Loved it !!!!! You can season it with whatever you like most.

I modified it just a touch. Added about 1T Dijon mustard, used half and half instead of evap milk, used 2tsp dill and about 1/2 tsp pampered chef citrus basil rub!      It needed to bake almost an hour so the cooking time submitted with the recipe was wrong.    Also I did not use the seasonings listed in the main recipe other than salt and pepper.

I'm only giving this a 4 but just because I did it a bit differently and can't say for sure how it would be if I'd followed it exactly. But the version I ended up with was a 5-star, and that's coming from my husband, who is very critical. The quiche texture was light and it had excellent flavor. My version: For the "crust", I used 3 canned refrigerator biscuits, rolled very thin, and pressed into a crock. Instead of cubed Cheddar, I used one cup of shredded Colby Jack, and did NOT add more cheese on top at the end--one cup was plenty. I used dried/minced onions instead of real ones since my husband won't eat real ones. I did put it into a blender but I don't really see any need to do so next time. I think that whisking it together well would produce the same result. Instead of parsley and sage, I used just a little dill weed, because I think think the flavor blends best with salmon, and it still adds the color. I used SMOKED salmon instead of regular salmon, which adds an inordinately different (and better) flavor in my opinion. I cooked it for only 25 minutes but my crock continues to cook for a bit after something comes out of the oven. What a tasty meal!

I'm not sure what went wrong with this recipe, I made it exactly as it says, except I chopped up a bit more onions. I'm not sure if that made a difference, but eventhough I used a 9in frozen crust like it says, the whole thing overflowed, did not cook all the way and when we did try it it was SO bad. No flavor at all. I'm really confused as to what went wrong because obviously most people enjoy this.
