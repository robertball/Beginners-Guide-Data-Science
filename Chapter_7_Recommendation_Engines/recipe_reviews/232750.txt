This was pure comfort food for me.  I used Blackened Seafood seasoning to season the bottom of the pan, the fish and added some to the sauce and the potatoes too.   I made the spinach and set aside, not everyone in the family likes spinach (silly peeps) so I layered the seasoned fish and the sauce, topped with the potatoes.... reserved some of sauce to mix with the spinach.   Cooked the fish at 400 for 25 minutes and then turned on the broiler to brown the top.  I had already sprinkled the seafood seasoning on top of the potatoes so it did not take long to brown up.  I reheated the spinach with the reserved sauce and spread a layer of that in a shallow plate, topped with the fish and potato casserole.  It made a lovely presentation and tasted WONDERFUL.   A couple of tips - make sure your fish is fully defrosted and blotted very dry with paper towels prior to seasoning.  This can be made with leftover mashed potatoes but re-heat the potatoes prior to layering and baking.  There were no leftovers - the pan was licked clean.  Good thing I got a picture before dinner!

Can't believe no one else has rated this yet.  This was a little time intensive, but so worth it. It tasted restaurant quality - a really good restaurant quality.  I have never tried a Chef John recipe that was not absolutely fabulous.  I am making this for a gathering this weekend, it is fantastic.  I used haddock, by the way.  Any white fish would work.

This is a fantastic recipe. I've made it once as written (except for using tilapia instead) and it was quite good just like that.

Since then I've changed a few things for my own personal taste. The things I do different are to continue using tilapia and to include a can of corn with the spinach. It adds a nice sweetness and little crunch to the dish. The other thing I change is adding garlic powder to the potato topping. Being the garlic lover I am I also put at least 4 cloves of garlic (pressed) into the roux (depending on their size). Besides that the only other changes is that I omit lemon as I don't always have lemons on hand.

When I told my hubby what was going into this dish he was very skeptical, especially since he's not a huge fish fan.  He changed his tune after the first bite.  I think it tasted even better reheated.  I made everything all at once and it took some time but it was worth it.

It reads like it's going to take forever to prepare, but this actually comes together pretty quickly.  I started the pot of water for the potatoes first, and by the time they were cooked and ready to mash, I had the rest all done and assembled. You can't beat the flavor, either. We loved this dish.

This is an amazing recipe. Very easy to prepare and so flavorful.  When done, it smells so good. 

I decreased the portions to 2 servings and substituted the cod for sole. Followed everything else as directed. I didn't have any problems with it becoming liquidy as I dried my fish very well and squeezed all moisture out of the spinach.

Will definitely make this again!

Made this for supper last night.  Super easy and delicious.  Used frozen chopped spinach and it worked out fine.  DH said "You can make this again."

This is not a difficult recipe and is just delicious. I threw some shrimp in on top of the fish because I happened to have an open bag in the freezer. I think it adds to the dish but is definitely not necessary. Highly recommend.

The flavor was OK, if unexciting. What did not appeal to us most notably was the lack of texture in this dish. The combo of soft fish, white sauce, wilted spinach and mashed potatoes was just a little too much soft stuff for us. Also needed some color contrasts, as everything was a lot of white, punctuated by the olive colored spinach, which loses its bright green as it cooks. Maybe include some sautéed, julienned carrots or finish with a few bits of fresh tomato. As is, it failed to excite either the eyes or the palate, both of which are important elements of a satisfying meal.

We loved it! I read all the reviews and waited to make it until I had leftover mashed potatoes.  I made the sauce in the pan I used for the spinach ( so much for too many pans used in the preparation)  I left the sauce very thick since many reported it thinning too much.  I was challenged with amount of fish and pan size so I covered the fish like frosting a cake...all the way down the sides to the bottom of the pan...sealing everything inside. Perfect!  I won't change a thing next time.

This was a very good recipe.  If you add some parmesan cheese to the top and broil, it will add an added dimension of a buttery flavor.  Definitely would recommend making this!

A friend recommended this recipe and I was very hesitant to try it as it's outside of my usual repertoire. I'm so glad I did. We really enjoyed it! I'm not a big spinach fan but it was good in this recipe. Will try other fish casseroles too since this one worked so well.

I have never made anything like this before but it looked really good and it was! I enjoyed all the flavors together. I didn't use as much cayenne pepper because I was making it for kids too but just putting the cayenne in the potatoes added just a hint of heat without being over-powering.

OK, tried this tonight and WOW! So much healthier than the fish recipe I have been using. Taste is amazing. I used a tad more lemon juice and 5 small potatoes which was all I had. I'll be sure to make enough potatoes next time. Again, there will soooo be a next time!

We tried this recipe last night and really liked it. It did take some prep time, but my husband and I both really enjoyed it and our two little boys even ate some. Was a good "comfort food", would be really good on a cold night! If your cod fillet is on the thick side, I would suggest splitting it in half to make it a little thinner.

I really liked this recipe.  However, I need some pointers:  I followed the recipe to the word.  I don't know if I should have somehow tried to blot the cod, as the dish was really soupy after cooking.  Tasted great, and I'll make it again (although I will add some cheese to the white sauce).

Great recipe.  Made it as is, though I added some shrimp because I didn't have a lot of white fish (we used sea bass).  I did cook my fish beforehand.  Dubious of the spinach, but it works really well!!  Will be making again!

Great recipe! Every lent I try new fish recipes and this one is hands down one of the best ever. I had to pare down the portions as there are only me and the husband  but it still worked great. I did add a bit of shrimp and also a splash of vermouth to the white sauce.  Soooo good!

my sister in law made this last night and nobody cared for it.  she is an excellent cook and followed this rather lengthy recipe to the "T" but it was bland except for the cayenne pepper. You could not tell the cod from the mashed potatoes. we all agree that this would not be made again even with changes to the recipe.  she has made other chef john recipes that were to die for but this one was a bust.

This was so good! Mine didn't look like the main picture but the flavour was so satisfying I ended up eating 1/3 of the whole pan.  For presentation purposes, I think I'll try a smaller pan for thicker layers. I think in the main picture she/he prepared the spinach with the white sauce before adding it as the first layer (instead of the fish being the first layer).

Excellent recipe. Put a few peas in with the spinach for interest. That worked. Added a little corn under the potatoes but don't think that mattered. Definitely worth making again.

This was a very good recipe, however, I would add more spinach because it just shrinks to nothing.  The nutmeg was an interesting taste.  This may be user error and my pinch was too big.  Given the amount of pots and bowls it took and the lengthly list of ingredients, I don't think I'll be making this again.

This was awesome! I used haddock because I prefer it to cod. Next time a little more garlic and lemon. Loved it!

5 stars for me! This is great. My husband commented twice, once for the main, then once as a leftover!  I had only  1.5 lbs of fish and followed the recipe
The sauce and potato was lots, can see why  2lbs fish recommended. Seems one could increase this recipe nicely and still have really moist fish. Most everything is made first, so it is just the fish cooking time.   The sauce goes a long way. Really good. A great family meal on its own, also fantastic as a company meal, just add a nice light salad with color.

We really enjoyed this.  We did use some extra garlic and potato.  I did make 1 1/2 x the recipe, and it turned out great.  Although the next time, will use a larger dish ( 11 x 18 didn't quite hold it all. LOL )  or use 2.  It will be made again, as it was a big hit around here.  Also will maybe add a little red pepper flakes, or Cajun seasoning, for a switch up.  Thanks for the recipe!

I served this for my Christmas Eve dinner last year, along with a salad.  I love nutmeg and had never thought of adding it to fish--delicious!  Comfort food, but light enough to still enjoy those Christmas cookies, too.

My hubby loved this, and my son liked it too!  I couldn't find fresh fish so I used frozen, next time I will defrost the fish first so the dish will be less soupy.

Never thought to put mashed potatoes and fish together like this.    My family loved it!!!   Think I added a bit more lemon juice as I could only find two small lemons and juiced them both, but other than that followed the instructions.    I made this ahead of time and cooked it for 50 minutes.   Wonderful!!!

This was fabulous. I didn't think I could make fish pie, and I would never have thought to add spinach. It was so easy. The spinach gave it a stronger flavour, which was nicer that what we usually buy in the shop. I accidentally used Hungarian smoked pepper, but it still turned out nice. I will definitely add it to my recipe book.

Wonderful! I've been eyeing this for months and finally made it last night. I used half milk and half heavy cream and 3 TBSP butter for sauce (browned!) and extra Lemon Pepper, Old Bay on fish and Hungarian Paprika on top of potatoes for color (didn't use broiler). Fabulous and makes great left overs.

Very nice dish.  Kept right with the recipe but used some AmberJack that we caught deepsea fishing.  The fish steaks were very thick so I did cook an extra 15 mins..  I thought the flavors were nice, but I may have used more than a pinch of cayenne.  I like the heat a little less but the other two liked the heat.  Two of us gave it 4's and 1 gave it a 5.  My daughter and I have to have it over the top for a 5, but know that it is a dish worth making and we'll make again!  Next time I might even add some mushrooms to the spinach and maybe a little less lemon, just my taste.

It's my first time to try a fish pie and this was sooooo delicious! I didn't have spinach so I used peas, carrots and corn vegetables mix and it was really good. Thanks for sharing, definitely will make again :)

I made this on a chilly day and my family loved it.  I followed the recipe although I used tilapia fillets instead of cod and added extra potatoes (albeit Yukon gold ones).  I also added a pinch or two of lemon fish rub.   The end result  tasted great but there was too much water.   Maybe next time, I'll cook the spinach well in advance and let them drain for a couple of hours before adding.

This was delicious.  Other than adding old bay to the top and bottom fish seasoning, I didn't change a thing.  Even better reheated the next day.  I also reduced the recipe for two servings and found the toppings didn't quite cove rthe fish, but it didn't matter.  We loved it.

This recipe was delicious.  My only advice would possibly add more lemon juice and add garlic pepper to the white sauce. But, that is my personal preference. 

I also modified this recipe to accommodate  gluten free and dairy free diet. i used gf all purpose flour and almond milk  for the butter I used a mixture of coconut oil/olive oil and salt.

I made this for the first time yesterday for  a group of 5. Everyone liked it very much! BUT there was NO way I coulrd have made this in 15 min of prep time. The kitchen was a mess of pots. bowls, measuring cups etc. I just put everything in the sink & tried to pretend it wasn't there. Having said that, I thought the sauce was very watery.  I used the cod which was dry as a bone & the spinach was really not watery at all. Did anyone else have this problem? I will definitely make it again but I would like to know what to do about the sauce. It was nice & thick when I made it.

I have made this recipe 3 times now. Twice I have presented it to guests. They loved it, and thought it a wonderful way to enjoy white fish. I pretty much follow the recipe as instructed. Attempt 4 though I deviated and made it with broccoli as that is what I had on hand. Not my favorite veggie, but it did not ruin the dish. Still prefer it with spinach though.

Made this last night for first time and it was awesome.  I had leftover mashed potatoes that I added the spices to and used frozen spinach thawed & drained instead of fresh since I didn't have any.  My husband loved it so I will be making again for sure!!

We mashed some cooked carrots in with the potatos and added some dill.  For the sauce, we added some diced onion, celery and garlic, seasoning with lemon pepper.  We seasoned the fish with more lemon pepper before assembling the casserole.  Very tasty!

It's pretty tasty. I didn't have enough spinach so added some green beans. The sauce is waterier than I expected, and I don't think it needed any cayenne at all. Otherwise, it was flavorful and we liked it.

Both my husband and I really liked this recipe.  I might go a little lighter on the cayenne next time.  I used baby bok choy instead of spinach since I had it on hand.  Otherwise followed the recipe.

This had an excellent combination of flavors. Next time I make it, I will add less milk to the white sauce because it was too runny.  I think I ended up using every pot and pan in my kitchen, but the results were world class.

That was lovely, and I certainly WILL make it again!  Mine was a little soupier than some, but the flavours were delicious - extra garlic (because garlic) and lemon (because lemon) - so many fish pies are bland.  This was NOT.  Thank you!

Great new idea for a fish meal!  I make Shepherd's Pie with ground beef occasionally, so why not fish?  The sauce and spinach were very nicely flavored.  I added a layer of shrimp over the fish fillets to please my husband and the pink shrimp added some needed color to the servings on the plate.   This was not a 30-Minute Meal but it wasn't hard to put together.

I had some leftover mashed red potatoes and frozen spinach. When a friend gave me a whole salmon, I knew just what I wanted to make! I made half the recipe in an 8X8 glass baking dish and prepared 2/3 of the white sauce. If you let the casserole sit for 5 minutes before cutting, it firms up and cuts beautifully. Thanks Chef John! Another great recipe!

This turned out great! I used tater tots instead of mashed potatloes. I did not make a roux for the sauce (am gluten free), I sautéed garlic in butter, added lemon juice, evaporated milk & 2 tbsps sour cream, salt & pepper, brought to a boil for a minute or 2. I sautéed the spinach with shallots & garlic, pressed out as much liquid into the center of pan to boil out, and I put Parmesan cheese between the layers, and on top after I’d put the last of the sauce over top of the tater tots. I sprinkled the top with smoked paprika. I accidentally baked for 60 minutes instead of 40 but that was perfect as the excess liquid cooked off & the top was crispy without broiling. I used the juice of about 2 lemons total. Will make again!

Wanted something different for fish & gave this a try. Glad I did; it turned out great! We two enjoyed it and there is enough for leftovers. Made as stated except I had to use a 9x13 casserole dish and had to use powdered milk; no problem with either. I used the cayenne pepper sparingly as it is noticeable and we don’t like highly spiced dishes. Thanks, Chef John!

Ok, I know it’s not what Chef John intended, but I used what I had available and it still turned out great! I used salmon (I’m from Alaska - I have a freezer full to get rid of) and chard and leeks from the garden, instead of spinach. I used dill, garlic, tarragon, thyme, salt, pepper and lots of lemon juice both in the white sauce and to season the fish. It turned out great!

A subtle dish with great flavor! The lemon zest really comes through in the final product. Don’t skimp on the fish though! Use at least 2lbs and thicker cuts of cod if possible.

Really great recipe.   It took a long time to prep, but was worth the creation process.  One thing I notice was the final dish came out a bit soggy, rather more structured in thr picture.  I'm sure ir has something to do with oven temperature, as I reduced the serving size for two.  Regardless, a really flavorful meal!

We are big seafood lovers and love to find new recipes.  This was absolutely delicious.  Didn't change a thing.  Other than using lots of pots and pans, I will definitely be making this again; it would be a wonderful company meal.

I made this last night and it was delicious.  The directions are straightforward and easy to follow.  I was a little heavy handed with the cayenne but it tasted great in the end.  I could have gotten away with using two potatoes instead of three.

Seafarer's simple version of shepherd's pie. Made as written, except for adding grated sharp cheddar cheese after browning the potato top. Used a 9" x 13" baking dish, and had no oven spills (should still place on a baking sheet as suggested in Chef John's video). A very satisfying meal, and will make again.

This is a good basic recipe, adaptable to the fish you have available. We used snapper and thin sliced zucchini, because that is what we had on hand. I'll come back to this one!

AMAZING. This was my first fish dish that I have ever cooked. Unless you know how to make the sauces, it is the only hard part of this dish. I will be most definitely remaking this dish. Great flavor, great tastes.

I have made this recipe a handful of times. the first few times, the only thing I substitute was salmon because it's my favorite fish and it was delicious.  the last time I made it I added 32 ounces of frozen spinach because the store did not have the fresh and added mozzerella cheese below and above the potatoes.  it was great

I was wholly unimpressed with this recipe and rather disappointed.  It's the first of three recipes that I've tried from Chef John that I didn't enjoy.
