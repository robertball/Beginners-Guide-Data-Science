I appreciated this healthier, low-carb option for a basting sauce but even with Splenda I knew using this much sugar would be way too sweet for us.  I used 1/3 cup and the result was a just-right balance of sweet and tangy. The less acidic rice vinegar over other options helped to keep this from being overly tangy. We used this on grilled boneless chicken breasts during the last minute or so of cooking time.

I thought I had Splenda but I didn't so I ended up using about 1/3 cup of regular sugar.  The sauce is awesome on grilled shrimp!
