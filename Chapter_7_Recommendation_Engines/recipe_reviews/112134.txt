Clean, refreshing and delicious! Make sure to let your salad chill to blend the flavors of the dressing with the mint and fruit. A dash of salt brings out the honeydew like mad. I followed this recipe as written except for the salt and I cut my jicama into stars because I'm the nerd of the herd. Thanks for  the recipe!

This is awesome! I did make a few changes though. I made this as a vegetarian meal and substituted cantelope for the honeydew, added a little extra honey, and added 1/2 cup of strawberries. It was excellent. Highly recommended.

I made this for a cookout and everyone raved about it.  Simple, whole ingredients and great taste.  Wonderful.

Did not care for the mint-fruit combination, would rate it higher without the mint.

Disappointed.  I like all of the ingredients by themselves and was excited to prepare jicama, but somehow the assembled dish did not appeal to me.  Mint was kind of overpowering, jicama tasted too much like raw potato.  The melon was the best part and I think that was due to the salt sprinkle.  Won't make again.

The flavors are good, but this takes a lot of work to eat. I will try shredding the jicama next time and cutting the melon into very slim strips.

I recommend using less lime juice and little or no mint.

I did not have honeydew, so I used cantelope. I also added strawberries. I diced everything small, added juice of half a lemon and half a lime. I totally forgot about the honey. I let it marinade overnight. It is so good! Ate it for breakfast with sausage biscuits. Jicama has so many wonderful health benefits. I am going to try to incorporate it in more recipes.

Delicious. I made mine with mango and did not have mint so I used a few drops of mint extract.

I followed the recipe exactly and I really like all the ingredients that make up this salad, but did not like them mixed together.  I felt that there were too many competing flavors.  Won't be making this again.
