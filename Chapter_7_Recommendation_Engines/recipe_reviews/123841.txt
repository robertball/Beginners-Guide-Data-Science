The perfect ratio of oil to vinegar in vinaigrettes, in my opinion, is three parts oil, to one part vinegar--and that's what I did in this dressing.  I also reduced the Dijon by half and swapped a bit of honey for the sugar. I rate this 2 stars had I prepared this as written (too much vinegar, too much mustard) and 4 stars with some modifications.

Very good salad dressing.  I made it using olive oil vs. veg. oil, used a 1 & 1/2 tbsp. of dijon mustard and added a bit of minced garlic and onion powder.  If you want a bit less tang, use a honey mustard instead of the dijon.

Delicious. A good balsamic vinegar is tasty on a salad all by itself, so to the reviewer who thought it was "too much vinegar": perhaps your vinegar was a bad variety. This dressing is a good base as well for adding fresh herbs and your own seasonings. I plan on adding minced garlic next. Anyone not used to balsamic-style dressings should also note that this is a dressing to toss lightly with a salad, not to glug all over it. It really enhances the greens. A new staple at my house!

Quick easy & tasty.  Use good quality olive oil.  Next time I would use a little less oil.

I also changed the oil vinegar ratio to 3/4 cup oil & 1/2 cup red wine vinegar.  I also added 2 tbsp of honey to cut the sour taste.  Finally, I added a pinch of thyme looks.  It turned out pretty good in the end.

The flavor was rather dull so I added Greek Mediterranean Seasoning from CostPlus World Market, which really brightened it up.  This recipe is also a bit heavy on the vinegar.  Less vinegar and a little seasonings and you've got a 4 or 5* dressing!  Made for Western Region Allstars Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

Simple to make and and tasty. Just what I wanted.
I mixed the ingredients in an almost empty mustard jar. It was the perfect size.

This was good but it has a strong flavor so it's not for everyone.

Followed the recipe exactly. Added to mixed greens, sweet grape tomatoes, red onions and peppercorn goats cheese. It was a hit with our guests.

Delicious! I halved the recipe and used champagne vinegar, since I had some on hand. I also used a tad less vinegar. Thanks for sharing!

i put the servings down to 2 for a big salad for myself, omit the sugar and added a heaping tbs of chopped up red onion.  PERFECT!  Its my go to vinegarette now!  Goes really fantastic with salmon cakes over greens.

Didn't care for this recipe much at all. Too oily (I used Olive oil and only 2 tbsp), which in turn made the vinegar too much. I do think 2tbsp of mustard are perfect though. The recipe is missing something, will post more when I figure it out.

Try substituting White Balsamic vinegar, cracked pepper and omit the sugar.  Whisk until blended.  Delicious too!

Delicious (I'm even enjoying it as I type this)! Balsamic vinegar swapped for the red wine vinegar makes it even better.

WAY too much vinegar. I would use maybe even less than 1/2 the recommended amount. It was too tangy. I tried to add more sugar and even tried to add some honey but I couldn't tame it down. I probably would not try this one again.

The proportion of vinegar to oil is way too great.  We finished it by mixing it about half with olive oil.
