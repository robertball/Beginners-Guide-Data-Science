My mother gave me this recipe years ago and I love it!  I just have to make sure my pork chops cook all the way, best to do most of the cooking of the chops while in the browning process.

I have made this twice now, the first time I did exactly as instructed and we all liked it, yet it was missing something.  Just made it tonite and WOW!!  I didn't have any cream of celery soup, but I did have Campbell's Condensed Cheddar Cheese Soup and for those of you who said more cheese this is the ticket!!  I also had picked up the wrong bag of hash brown, I got the Bob Evans Seasoned which I think added that extra flavor we were looking for the first time.  Now for the pork chops....I had a center cut pork roast that I was breaking down into chops this morning and thought why not just cut it into bite size pieces and cook them now so I can just throw everything together tonite(I have a 5yr old, 1yr old, & a husband who keep me busy during the day).  Glad I did, no cutting needed and super tender.  I also used a 6oz can of French Fried onions and used 1/2 in the hash brown mix & 1/2 on the top.  This rating is for the original recipe, with my adjustments this is a 10!!

I thought the potatoes were bland.  Maybe if you add chopped onions instead of the french fried onions.

I used cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of celery, a little more cheese in the potato mixture, and this was delicious!  My kids ask to have it all of the time!

This was a raving success, thanks to taking suggestions from reviewers.  Thanks everyone.    I added diced onion, chopped celery & 1/2 bag frozen carrots (thawed) to the potato mixture along with MUCH MORE seasoning and more cheese.  Leave the french fried onion out of the potato mixture (you can't taste it once cooked), instead, use much more generous amounts french fried onion on top at end of cook time.  Crispy & Yummy!

I have been making this casserole for years.  Actually got the recipe about 20 years ago from a neighbor.  I use about 2 cups of cheese, because if some cheese is good according to my family... more cheese is better!

This was very simple and tasted really good.  I might have left the chops in the skillet too long, because once it was eating time, the chops were a little dry.   My husband made the comment that the hashbrowns were Cracker Barrell quality.  So that was a BIG compliment.  My daughter liked the hashbrowns so well, she wants some of the leftovers for breakfast.  Everything tasted really good.  I did add onion and celery like another review mentioned.  Oh, and yes I did add probably a total of 2 C of cheese instead of one.

Really liked this recipe. I used an onion and different type of hashbrowns. I used garlic salt on the pork chops while browning them. The pork chops were really moist!

The potatoes were a smidgeon too salty for my taste, but that may have been because I just sprinkled the seasoned salt onto my pork chops without measuring out a teaspoon. Or it might have been because of the french fried onions (I used slightly more than it called for, due to using half of a large can rather than the smaller can), or both. Keeping that in mind, I suspect next time I wouldn't add the additional salt to the potato mixture, as it seemed unnecessary. I might also try the garlic powder another review mentioned next time instead of the seasoned salt. Otherwise, it was quite good, and the potatoes would be good even without the pork chops. I did use more cheese than it calls for, but my family is big into cheese as well. This was enjoyed by my family, and will definitely be repeated again (just with less salt).

I love this recipe!  I use golden mushroom soup to make it a little richer.  Also, I sprinkle the top with smokey paprika.  The red color makes it look delicious and adds another layer to the flavor.  Yum!

We frequently have pot lucks at work and there is always plenty to serve the whole gang.It is so popular that I am told NEVER to make anything else!  Everyone loves it! 
Modification:
I added chopped green onions inside the potatoe mix and then sprinkled some of the remaining on top after it is done baking to add color and flavor! HUGE HIT!!

I have made this several times.  My family loves it.  The only changes I made were that I use velvetta cheese, country hashbrowns, and omit the french fried onions(family does not like them).  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Very good weeknight recipe.  We had this with some glazed carrots and we were stuffed!  It is a pretty heavy meal, so be prepared.  We think we might try it with cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery just to see what it would be like, but the cream of celery is also very good.  We'll make again.

Made this recipe in very little time.  A great one to prepare when you've worked all day, need to grocery shop and still feed the family by 6:00.  Followed the recipe exactly, however, I couldn't find shredded hash browns, had to use the diced.  Regardless, the pork was unbelievably moist (I did press the pork into the potatoes as one reviewer suggested , the pork and potatoes were excellent.  Great recipe the whole family loved!  Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe, my family loved it. I made a few changes as per the reviews I read. I switched to the soup to Campbells Condensed Cheddar Cheese soup. I used garlic salt instead of seasoning salt to season the pork chops. I choose to used all the French Fried Onions on the top with lots of cheese, browned perfectly and tasted awesome. I also used probably about 2 cups of cheese in total rather than the 1 cup it called for. I couldn't find frozen shredded hash browns, so I used deli fresh shredded potatoes, worked just fine, although I will probably double the amount of shredded potato next time. Found it a bit saucy. Loved it the taste!!

I have been making this for years and the whole family loves it. The only thing I do different is add cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery. I also add most of the french friend onions at the end as they are much better on top than in the mixture (crunchy and brown).

My family loved this recipe!  I tweaked it by substituting 3 pkg. of cooked, Ramen noodles for the potatoes.  I also used cream of mushroom soup(low sodium) for the celery soup.  For the sour cream, I used fat free sour cream. I omitted the 1/2 tsp. of salt and I also added 1cup of sauteed onions (we like lots of onions).  Will make this again!

This recipe is fabulous! I especially liked all the suggestions to add more cheese and use the onions mostly at the end. It was easy to make and my picky children loved it. No more boring pork chops.

I was tired of the same old breaded and fried pork chops and wanted something easy and different.  Well I found it!!!!This was delish. Even my husband who "hates casseroles" loved it, and even brought leftovers for lunch and a coworker.  Also my very pickey 3 boys enjoyed it.  I made a few adjustments though.  I browned chops longer on stove, as one review suggested. I didn't have cheddar cheese, so I substituted it with cubed Velveeta, and I also added one envelop of onion soup mix to give it more flavor, I pushed chops into cream mixture instead of on top and baked for 1 hour. The chops came out fork tender and moist.  Like I said before....DELISH.  Will make again.  Thanks

This recipe was terrible. I even tried following other reviewers suggestions and adding some onions and some seasoning to the potatoes and they were still bland. The cook time is not right, after following the recommended directions the pork chops were not cooked through and the potatoes were still hard. I dont think I can do anything to make it better.

This was a great recipe.  I did take other reviewers suggestions and used cream of mushroom soup and garlic powder instead of seasoning salt.  It came out great.  This will definitely be added to the rotation!!!  Thanks!

Potatoes turned out great.  The pork chops were... okay.  I enjoyed it, but I would enjoy it more if my whole family loved it.  My husband just doesn't care for pork too much.

I don't know that the pork chops are necessary - this is a fantastic potato casserole.  The pork chops definitely weren't destroyed in this process, though, and it was all very fantastic.  I will definitely make the potatoes and pork chops again.
