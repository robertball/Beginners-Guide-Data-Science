This recipe was FABULOUS!!!  So quick and easy and soooo yummy! My neighborhood grocer did not have instant espress powder...so I used a spoon more of instant coffee and "cooking" maple syrup plus the rest of the ingredients and it was a HUGE hit with the family and I can't wait to impress guests :o)

Great sauce for New York Strip steaks.  I usually never make a sauce, as I let the flavor of the steaks stand out.  I doubled it, and it still was not enough!

We did not like this.  It was way too strong with coffee flavor, and ended up being very similar to an overly-thick terriyaki sauce.

Yummy though I did not use espresso.  Reduced 1/2 cup dark coffee (~half), then added 1/4 cup light soya sauce, 1/4 cup pure maple syrup, 1/4 cup brandy.  Reduced liquids again in half and added a sprig of rosemary at end for additional flavour and let sit for 10 minutes.  Great on grilled beef tenderloin
