I added a handful of fresh spinach, replaced the  Italian sausage with sliced smoked turkey sausage and then topped it off with the Parmesan mixed into an egg, adding this to the pot of soup. Delicious!

I omitted the ground turkey so halved the liquid (tomatoes and chicken stock) and added wheat gnocchi which absorbed some of the liquid to give it more of a stew like consistency, which I was aiming for.  I substituted fennel seed for the tarragon.  It is amazing, will definitely make again!  Next time I might use real garlic, if you have it, why not use it!

Flavorful, hearty soup.  I used about 1/2 the amount crushed tomato and chicken broth to keep the soup thick.
