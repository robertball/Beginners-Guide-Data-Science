A friend made this the other day for an afternoon tea break and we gobbled it up.  It was delicious!   So I went and bought puff pastry and nutella (actually, the store brand) and just made two trees this afternoon.  So quick and easy that I didn't even need to refer to the recipe.  If I had, I might have remembered the egg wash--but even without it came out beautifully.  Hint--zap the nutella jar for 10 seconds so it spreads easily.  Go ahead and just slather one entire sheet of puff pastrywith nutella on a piece of parchment on a cookie sheet.  Ease the top pastry on.  Then cut the center triangle.  Use the two half side triangles to make a second tree.  Seal the two sides together on top with fingers dipped in water.  This is a new family favorite!

This is so easy and is always such a hit! Tip: Warm the Nutella in the microwave for 15-20 seconds before spreading -- otherwise, it's difficult to spread evenly.

Added a dried cherry to the end of each branch to hold it down.  This added a festive and flavorful touch.

this was a christmas dessert hit this year. i'd never made it before, but it's SO easy! i decorated it with some red and green m&m's, just sprinkled here and there. my family loved it. a little light and a little sweet, it didn't make anyone feel "stuffed."

Made this with peanut butter and chocolate chips. Sprinkled powder sugar on once done. Good but needed a little bit more sweetness. Going to do a hame and cheese version next.

This was so easy! However I cooked down fresh strawberries with a tbs of sugar and used it for filling. I also spread cream cheese on the dough before adding the strawberries. Yum!
Next time I may drizzle melted dark chocolate over it!

This is deceptively easy! Read up about how to handle puff pastry if you are unfamiliar before starting, as it would be a shame to crack your pastry sheet. I used the two excess triangles from the sides to create two smaller herbed cream cheese trees made in a similar fashion and those were so delicious! This is best served right out the oven. I brought it to  a party and it fared okay but ideally right out of the oven would be best. Now i am thinking of all the combos, pesto/ricotta, ham/cheese, chorizo/cilantro. So so simple  and delicious.

I added freshly roasted crushed hazelnuts and Skor bits to the Nutella before laying on the top pastry.  It made for a richer filling.  It was very popular.  I will be making it again for Christmas. With the extra dough I rolled it into a rectangle, added the filling, joined the ends to form a ring than scored the top to make a wreath.

Although I cook quite a bit, I don't bake much at all.  When I planned to make this recipe, my wife could not believe saying she had not seen bake in the nearly 48 years of our marriage.  I made the recipe.  It is much easier than the finished products looks and is really tasty.  In fact, when I made it for a party last evening, my wife did not get any.  She waited just a while but it was gone.

It is just as easy and lovely as everyone claims! Brought it to a party and people were afraid to eat it, saying it was too pretty! But once they finally did, folks agreed it was very tasty and gave me WAY too much credit for something that took even LESS time than the recipe claims. Will definitely make again!

Impossible to transfer without using something underneath the puff pastry but paper tore easily. Instead of parchment paper I use the non-stick foil instead on my large cookie sheet.  Knife cut the paper so use  a pastry cutter with a crimped Edge -worked great !

I used one sheet of puff pastry. After cutting the sides of the triangle off, spread Nutella then use the cut off pieces to cover. Lay extra smalll 
pieces down the  middle to cover seem. Baked at 400 per pastry directions.  Lovely breakfast treat.

First attempt and it came out pretty well! Next time I’m going microwave the Nutella longer so it spreads easier and use a bit of water to seal the edges of the star but otherwise great!

A brand new family tradition is born!

This was great! I made the recipe but substituted a green (food coloring) tinted sweetened cream cheese and egg filling for the Nutella. After forming the branches and brushing with egg wash I sprinkled the entire tree and star with sparkly silver sugar crystals and mini M&M's.

As someone else noted, after cutting out the tree shape, you have the equivalent of another entire tree, if you simply put the two tree scrap halves together (lightly wet the dough and press together at the seam a bit to make the two halves stick together as much as possible.) So I made two trees. Good thing I did, because they were both devoured!

The recipe is super easy, unfortunately, the Pepperidge Puff Pastry I purchased had one of them all separated so I had a bit of a hassle having to roll it with a rolling pin, but I prevailed and although a bit crooked, not bad for my first try. It was a hit for Christmas dessert and next time I will take the tips of zapping Nutella in the microwave to make spreading it easier. However, everybody raved about it.

Super easy and makes a good presentation. Make sure the branches are not too thick. I don't recommend it for transporting, even pulling it right out of the oven. Though I transported it uncovered on a wooden cutting board, it wasn't as crispy as I would have liked, even the top softened.
