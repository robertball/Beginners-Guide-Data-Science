This is a fantastic recipe that never fails to impress! 

To address the layer of oil tat gathers on the top:

Use a high quality block of cheese (cheddar honestly works best) and shred it yourself before mixing. The problem with using pre-packaged shredded cheeses is that they are coated in flour, so the pieces won't stick together. Flour in this recipe draws the oil to the top, coating the dip in a runny red film. Easily solved by shredding yourself! (I have tried off-brand block cheese, and they too have put flour in their cheese. Make sure that the one you buy has NO flour!)

This recipe is great! Did you know buffalo chicken dip has its own site and facebook page? www.buffalochickendip.com.  Anyway, I always recommend using canned chicken.  I work for Swanson so I know their chicken is made with only white meat.  When we made the recipe with rotisserie and regular chicken it was often clumpy, but the Swanson Chicken really improvest the consistency! It also makes this recipe really easy. Cooking and shredding your own chicken takes a while!

I make this all of the time and it is great! Only thing I change is I use rotissary chicken from Sams or Superwalmart, shred it and dump all of the ingredients into a crock pot. I usually let it cook on low for about 30 minutes, then eat with Frito scoops. Husband loves it, so do I!!!

Superb! Just perfect! Made it as described with blue cheese, for the shredded cheese option I used a cheddar blend and threw in some grated parmesan on top. I also used the 1/3rd less fat cream cheese to cut down on the fat. I also didn't like the idea of using canned chicken so I grilled some up fresh, then cut it into small pieces.   My boyfriend and I were crazy about this after having a version at a local restaurant. We both agreed it was better then the restaurant version. We will make many more times!

Always a classic for a party!  I am not fond of blue cheese dressing so I sub with ranch.  The Buffalo Wing sauce seems to be a little milder so I use that.

I have made a variation of this for a few years.  The differences are:  I put celery in--about 3/4C chopped I use about 20oz frozen Tyson diced chicken--thawed Full bottle of Frank's Buffalo Full bottle of Marzetti's Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing.

Delicious! I used half blue cheese, half mozzerella and used boiled shredded chicken instead of canned! Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make this for parties in the future.

I didn't care for this. The only reason it resembled buffalo wings is because of the sauce.

This is an awesome and easy appetizer recipe!  A must for any party or SuperBowl gathering!  I always save a little bit for the next day and use it as an omelette filling.  Beat four eggs with salt and pepper.  Pour into a pan over medium heat.  Keep lifting edges to let liquid egg slide to the pan.  Once the egg is just about solidified, put heated buffalo chicken dip on one half of omelette and fold over.  It's my man's dream omelette!

I've been making this recipe for parties for about a year now and people always request that I bring it and even though I've made it a dozen times or so now I've never felt anything needs to be changed. I prefer to use canned chicken because it's always very moist and breaks up easily into shreds. Cooking the chicken and shredding it yourself takes forever, although it probably is cheaper. And I definitely use blue cheese dressing (some recipes say you can use ranch instead) and I've used a variety of shredded cheeses, but sharp cheddar and mozzarella are my favorite. I usually coat the top of the mix in shredded cheese before baking it in the oven and it turns out great.

Excellent!  We have had this recipe for a while and it always gets fantastic reviews!  You can alter the intensity of the heat by adding or lessening the amount of hot sauce.  My husband likes it hot, so I add the full half cup.  You have never seen a dip disappear so quickly.  Great for the Super Bowl!

This was great!  One of my guests didn't even like blue cheese and loved it!  Next time I would use more hot sauce and less dressing.  And probably more blue cheese crumbles.  Loved it!

This stuff is amazing! I took it to a housewarming party last night and had so many people come up and ask for the recipe. Every last bite was eaten. I subbed ranch for the blue cheese dressing and used mozzarella. I do think it would be delicious with blue cheese but since I was taking it to a large gathering thought it would be safer to use the ranch and mozzarella to suit everyone's taste. I served it with Fritos's Scoops. If you are looking for an appetizer to serve while watching football - this is it!  Look no further.

Made this for a get together...it was a hit~ Definitely will make it in the future~

Felt that I should add a bit since I have made this SO many times since I first reviewed it. Always requested by everyone. I shred a rotisserie chicken (white meat only), double the recipe, use mozz for the cheese (about a package)~ so easy and so popular, one of the first things to go at a party.

My husband and I love this recipe!  We use whatever ingredients we have on hand (whether it's leftover bbq chicken instead of the can chicken, or ranch dressing and feta cheese instead of blue cheese dressing and mozzarella), and it always turns out delicious.

Served this during a football game and I just kept hearing 'mmm' over and over again. It really is awesome. Be prepared- it is salty, but it is delicious. I served this with tortilla chips, but celery sticks would have been a nice addition. Thanks for sharing!

My family LOVES this dip! My husband asks for it all the time as a somewhat healthier version of eating wings (no fried stuff, anyway).  It is great for parties, but sometimes we make it just to keep around for snacking with either crackers, tortillas, or celery!  Oh, I often throw all of the ingredients in the crock pot and let them melt down all gooey.  So easy!

Love this recipe!  It was the first to go at our superbowl party.  Everyone wanted more...  I have made this before with rotisserie chicken and I don't like it as much because it doesn't get in tiny enough shreds as the canned and it's a little dry.  I normally HATE canned chicken but in this case I feel it works best.

Made for picky eaters on Christmas. Everyone loved! Served with crackers, fritos, celery. Good warmed up or cold. Used Franks Buffalo Wing sauce (instead of hot) and shredded 5 cheese Mexican (instead of mozz). Canned meat does have a distinct taste-would be better with fresh chicken, but who has the time?? Everyone liked with canned, so why not??? Leftovers still great for Giants football tailgate!

Excellent, and a bit addictive.  I only used canned chicken the first time, and never will again ... this is SOOO much better with fresh chicken vs canned.  Also, instead of the bleu or mozzarella cheese, I use sharp cheddar and serve with tortilla chips.  Yum!

I love the flavor of this dip, but I usually make it and then serve it in my crock pot, and it gets pretty greasy just sitting there. Try using low-fat dressing and reduced fat cream cheese to cut down on the oil layer. Oh, and don't forget to add big chunks of blue cheese. That really makes this taste just like hot wings!

I made the recipe exactly as written.  I would recommend using fresh, chopped chicken breast as opposed to the canned...it had a canned taste that I didn't like.

I used to be asked to bring Spinach Dip to all get togethers - it got so old - this is my new dip.   I have made it probably 10 times since finding it and have baked it, microwaved it, and used a crock pot.  The dip is always gone.  Everyone loves it.  I personally like the crock pot for get togethers as it can stay warm.  I have used canned chicken, boiled chicken and baked chicken.  Finally decided the chicken needs to be soft and shredded.  Canned seemed better every time, it blended better. But canned was more exspensive.  So I cook the chicken breast in the crock pot all day the day before and it usually shredds and is softer, not mushy.  It works better and gives the same texture as canned chicken. You can use can, but it costs alot more for all that chicken (especially when you are making a big batch for parties).  You can not go wrong, this is so good.

This recipe is oh so tasty! My only recommendation would be to use fresh chicken instead of canned. It makes a huge difference. Love it with veggies, chips, you name it :)

This recipe is wonderful. Perfect for anytime. From a party to game day this is just great... We use Tortilla chips for this. Seems to taste better then crackers or veggies. Either way it's great and will never use any other recipe...I get raves every time..Oh and use Frank's Red Hot sauce if you can find it. It does make a difference.

Served this for a party and they licked the bowl clean.  Only change was to use my own cooked chicken breast. Great recipe!

I love this dip, but I definitely use the Buffalo sauce.  I also just use Mexican blend shredded cheese or regular shredded cheddar.  This is always a BIG hit at parties.

This is a HIT every time I bring to a party. I do make a few changes...I use 2 par boiled boneless chicken breasts that I cook in some chicken stock--which I then shred after cooling. I also use 3/4 cup of buffalo wing sauce & only use blue cheese crumbles--no mozzarella. Once assembled I top the casserole with some diced celery & a little cheddar cheese. I also serve with multigrain tostitos chips...I have NEVER gone home with leftovers and It's become a family favorite!! ENJOY!

This was amazing.  The flavors are incredible and are for true Buffalo Chicken lovers.  I used Blue Cheese dressing and shredded Mozz cheese and it was soooooo good.  It is a keeper!!!

This recipe was a huge hit at our football bash! The only thing I did differently was used ranch dressing instead of blue cheese, and I added shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. This dip is awesome served with Frito's scoops. I opted for the wing sauce, and it gave the dip a wonderful flavor. I will be sure to make again soon!! Thank you!!

Absolutely delicious! I was a little at first because I am not a bleu cheese fan, however, I made this for a get-together and it did not matter if I liked blue cheese! I am glad I did! Although, I used the mozzarella, I did use the bleu cheese dressing and it added a nice zing to it. It is important to use a quality bleu cheese dressing not one like Kraft or a generic one. This was scarfed up by 7 people and gone in a blink of an eye. I followed the recipe to a "T"!

I brought this to a company potluck so instead of baking, I put the ingredients in a crockpot.  It turned out great.  This recipe is quick and easy and tastes just like buffalo wings.

I made this dip in preperation for some good eats during the superbowl game.  I followed this recipie to a T. Although, I thought that this recipie was good, it was not great.  I was a little disapointed since I was tuned up for a nice treat after reading through the reviews.  I thought that the dip was overly spicey and I LOVE spice!!  My husband who also love's spice thought the same.   Also, I thought that the dip tasted better with celery.  Using crackers or tortilla chips was too salty for my taste.  In addition, I thought that the blue cheese dressing and additional blue cheese crumbles, may have been a little too much for my tastebuds and made the dish, a little saltier than I would have liked.   I am going to try the other buffalo dip recipie on this site with rave reviews from over 1200 folks.  Seems like that recipie is tried and true. It calls for more cream cheese, comparatively less cayenne pepper sauce, cheddar cheese etc.   Just wanted to share my experience, the dip was not horrible, but not great.  Don't think I will try to make this recipie again.  Hope that this review is of help.

Great taste but I like the texture of layering the ingredients.  1 8 oz. cream cheese spread in bottom of 8 1/2 x 13 pan, top with chicken mixed with hot sauce, top with mozzarella or cheddar cheese, drizzle chunky blue cheese salad dressing over top.  You can heat this in the oven or microwave. and Frank's Red Hot sauce is the BEST!

This is great!!! If you want a lower calorie version use mix a 1/2 cup fat free Greek yogurt with 1.5 teaspoons of ranch dip mix and use Neufchatel cheese and reduced fat blue cheese. You can't even tell the difference

I have made a similar version below and it's always devoured.  I actually prefer serving it cold.  I still heat it up in the microwave to blend all the flavors and then chill and serve.

1/2 cup Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing 
1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese (or more to taste)
3 tablespoons Buffalo Wing Sauce 
2 cans (10 oz each) Chunk Chicken, drained, chopped (add extra wing sauce to it and to set in flavor)
2 packages (8 oz each) Cream Cheese, softened
2-3 medium Stalks Celery, finely chopped (1 cup) add celery after melting

THIS IS AMAZING! What is even more amazing that I just learned that you can make this in a crock pot! It takes about an hour or so, but it's a great way to keep it warm for awhile and if you need time to prepare other things. When this is made for a cook out, I love to put it on my burger!

A hit.  I have followed a different recipe before but it mad way too much.  Also this recipe calls for blu cheese, I think that made the difference.  Everyone has always liked buffalo chicken dip, but they LOVED this recipe.  I used Franks Buffalo Wing Sauce, and mozzarella cheese.  Served with Club crackers.

I used the Hot Buffalo sauce since others said it wasn't spicy. Well it was spicy and great. I also used a roasted chicken I put in the food processes.  The guys all loved it. I served it with celery, crackers and tostidos. The tostidos were the guys favorite while I liked the celery.

Made a double batch of this for the office.  It was such a hit, we're having it again for our Christmas party!  I cooked chicken breasts in a small slow cooker instead of using canned chicken.

Because we don't like blue cheese, I used a half cup of sour cream, a batch of homemade ranch seasoning mix and I did use mozzerella. Totally inhaled in less than a half hour. I swear to you. Hungry boys after trick-or-treating.....darn near licked the bowl clean! Substituting a reduced fat cream cheese or sour cream/dressing isn't an issue....noone notices. Or my boys didn't.

This dip was ok. I think my expectations may have been a little high. Both the man at home and myself are HUGE blue cheese fans, and we love hot wings, for some reason this dip just didn't excite too much. It was a little on the greasy side as well. I probably won't make it again.

My daughter made this as a snack for her friends and served it over french fries.  They LOVED it!  She did adapt the canned chicken to 2 small breasts she cooked in the crock pot.  She drained the liquid off (saved by mom for soup and froze it!) she shredded the meat and added the Frank's Hot Sauce.  The chicken absorbed quite a bit as it was drier than canned chicken so she added about 1/2 cup more than called for.  She subbed ranch for the blue cheese dressing and mozzarella for the chunky blue cheese.  She put the rest of the ingredients into the little crock pot and let it melt and while she prepared the fries.  She spread the dip over the fries then topped with a little mozzarella and put it in the oven just to melt the cheese a bit. Oh! And darn if the girl didn't throw on a pinch of dried parsley over top for garnish! She also served it with a side of celery sticks.  She looked like a rock star to her friends! I am sure this will be made often...

This is a favorite for Football season! I use shredded moz. cheese instead of bleu and serve with sliced cucumbers and/or tortilla scoop chips. Big hit every time I make it. Never any leftover!

Also I boil my chicken fresh, not that it makes a big difference. I'm just not a fan of canned meat.

This dip was pretty good. The only change I made was that I used chicken breast rather than canned chicken. I placed two chicken breasts in a crock pot and added enough broth to cover them. I cooked them on low for about 5 hours and they came out very nice. Much better than canned chicken, in my opinion!

I followed this almost to a T. I used light cream cheese cuz it's what I had, I chose to use Franks's wing sauce and I used blue cheese. I also added a bit of extra sauce. I thought it was very delicious and I will make it again. The only thing I will do differently next time is use rotisserie chicken or maybe cook it in the crockpot. The canned chicken does have an odd stringy consistency, but still a good back up if you are in a hurry since the flavors make up for that. Yum!

i make this allllll the time for gatherings, everyone loves it! i use ranch instead of bleu cheese (because bleu cheese grosses me out) and use a mix of cheddar and jack cheese since it gives it a little more flavor than mozz. i've done it with canned chicken before, but i usually use leftover chicken breasts since it gives it a better taste. great with celery, crackers and tostitos for dipping!

Next time I will use HOT wing sauce instead of the Cayenne Pepper sauce cause we think it could have been hotter.  It was tasty, sprinkled Parmesan on the top when it was done then broiled it a few minutes.

I got this recipe from a coworker. It is always a hit at work potlucks with a few changes, we subsitute crakers for scoops tortilla ships and also chicken breast for canned chicken. I bake the chicken breast after it was brushed with the Franks buffalo sauce. 
I made quesedillas instead of making it a dip for a superbowl party once, where there were already plenty of dips...it was a great success and so easy to eat...just grab and go :D

A-mazing!  personally loath canned chicken.  so, cooked chicken for about 6 hrs. in slow-cooker, shredded it, & then threw everything else in.  added some celery.  didn't measure out anything & was still great.  (I mean, judging from the ingredient list, how could this NOT taste good.)

Very good recipe. I did 1/2 blue cheese and 1/2 ranch, mozzarella cheese and canned chicken. Next time I will definatly use chicken breast in this. Combined it all and put it in the slow cooker for 2hrs on high then turned it to low until my guests arrived. Definatly will be making this again!

We love this dip!  I make it for my yearbook staff and I have to make sure I get mine first, or I won't get any at all!  I change the recipe a little: no cayenne pepper, use ranch dressing in combination with the crumbled bleu cheese, and I increase the chicken, mozzarella and cream cheese.  That makes it a it less runny & greasy.  We eat it with tortilla chips--much better than with crackers!  It's by far the most popular snack I've ever taken to a party...people keep coming back to the table again and again, saying how addictive it is. (We don't like celery, so we don't add that, either.)

This is a phenominal dip. We never have any left over. I prefer to make as directed, but my brother is not a big bleu cheese fan so somtimes I replace with ranch dressing and it is almost just as good.

I made this dip twice in one weekend due to popular demand.  I mixed all the ingredients with a spoon, but I think blending the cream cheese, dressing and hot sauce with an electric mixer would make a better consistency.

Made this last night for the Football game and everyone loved it!  I used light cream cheese and a mexican cheese blend. I also used two 12oz cans of chicken and probably a little extra cheese.  I've had and made several versions of this in the past but I think this one is my favorite so far.  I'm sure I'll be making this again soon!

Always a hit!  Made exactly as written using crumbled blue cheese.  Served with crackers, celery and tortilla chips.  It is delicious!  My hubby thought it was a little too spicy for him, but he is wimpy when it comes to spice, so I will tone it down in the future for him, but not for me. :)

This was really good. I did use Neufachatel and light ranch dressing (the folks i made it for don't like bleu cheese) to make it a little healthier. There wasn't any left and I got asked for the recipe, so i guess it was a hit :)

This is so tasty and easy.  I make it with a blue cheese recipe from this site and it is always delicious and eaten up right away.  I add more hot sauce, cause we like spicy stuff and I don't use canned chicken (it smells like fish!).  Rotisserie chicken is good.

This is always a hit....I found a great way to have it not separate, as it can look unappealing, it's also quicker! Just warm shredded chicken and sauce on stove, medium heat, then mix in softened cream cheese, dressing and shredded cheese. Heat until completely mixed and serve. No need to bake!

This dip is sooo yummy!  doesn't last long at a party.  I did make a modification, because I did not have blue cheese dressing I used ranch dressing and crumbled blue cheese.  Will keep this recipe close and make it often!

Great dip, easy to make.  I was hesitant about using canned chicken but it turned out fine. Bleu cheese crumbles were great but may be too pungent for others.  Depending on who I'm making the dip for, I may use the mozzarella cheese.

It is GREAT - but you must like blue cheese (which i do) - - i used fat fee cream cheese.  I served with crackers and celery.  It is a great South Beach Diet option when using the celery.

Delicious, I gave it a four only because i changed up the recipe to make it better (for me at least).  I used cooked shredded chicken in place of the canned.  I also opted for the mozzeralla cheese instead of the blue cheese.  I think adding blue cheese would overpower the dish itself. Also, the servings are a little off, this recipe makes enough for about 6 people

The taste was ok. I might use chopped chicken breast next time - the canned chicken is stringy. I have to say the smell turned me off. It smelled like tuna, which I hate. Once I got past that, it was ok, but just not great.

I love making this stuff. Its always a hit at get togethers. My husband doesn't like blue cheese, so I use ranch instead. I also use chicken breast instead of canned. Yummy!

Made as directed, but with ranch subbed for the bleu cheese.  I used Swanson's canned chicken and it was delicious.  I was nervous about some of the remarks about canned chicken, but I like to make recipes as directed on the first attempt.  I will make this again and again and not change a thing !!

YUM! Delicious treat. I make a somewhat "less bad for you" version with light dressing, 1/3 fat cream cheese, and low fat cheese. Served with celery it's a comparatively less bad and tastes almost exactly the same.

This is a staple for us at family gatherings and with friends.  I am always asked to bring this as an appetizer.  I cooked this recipe as is but I use only the crumbled blue cheese and no shredded cheese as the recipe states one or the other. I usually use the hot version of buffalo wing sauce which gives it a nice little kick.

I made this for a Halloween party last weekend; it was really good. I used Frank's wing sauce, sauteed the canned chicken in butter, used Ranch instead of blue cheese dressing and mozzarella instead of crumbled blue cheese. Next time I will add in cheddar cheese and some minced onion and maybe a dollop of sour cream. Overall, it was lighter and creamier than most other buffalo chicken dips I've tried.

We loved this dip! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it calls for canned chicken breasts and blue cheese OR mozzarella (quite different flavors) and blue cheese dressing (probably too much if you also use blue cheese in it). As I modify it, it's 5 stars.

I make it with grilled chicken or poached chicken breasts, because I didn't like the canned taste of the Swanson's. I use homestyle ranch dressing (from a restaurant - not the stuff from the store that tastes like mayo) and crumbled blue cheese, and it's wonderful! If you like Buffalo chicken wings dipped in blue cheese dressing, you'll love this!

I love this recipe.  I spread the uncooked dip on pizza dough and then I cook it in the oven with shredded mozzarella on top.  Voila!, my own buffalo chicken pizza! My family constantly asks for it.  I do cut the cream cheese down to 4-6 oz., I've found it had too much.  And I've used both swanson chicken and rotisserie chicken, both work, but the rotisserie can come out dry.

Searched for this recipe after having a similar appetizer at our local favorite hangout.  This is very close to what they serve and it was very good and easy to make.

I did opt for a fresh boneless, skinless chicken breast, rather than the canned chicken.  I used the mozzarella cheese and only 1/4 cup of the blue cheese dressing.

I made this recipe as written and thought it was delicious. I absolutely love blue cheese, but my husband sometimes doesn't like such a strong flavor, so I used half ranch dressing and half blue cheese, and used blue cheese crumbles. I cooked this in a small crockpot. After tasting it, I actually added a little more Franks and a few more blue cheese crumbles. Totally delish, and I used all low-fat ingredients (low fat dressings and reduced fat cream cheese). This is a keeper.

This is always a go to for party food! We use a Crock-Pot instead of using the oven. First, we put the cream cheese in the Crock-Pot to help it soften and then whisk it with a fork. While that is softening, we drain the chicken and combine it with the Frank's hot sauce in a separate bowl and let it sit. After, the cream cheese is ready, we combine all of the ingredients (we use Bleu Cheese dressing & Kraft Philadelphia shredded mozzarella cheese) and let it sit on low for an hour at the very least, but it can sit on low/warm for hours if needed to make ahead of time. The longer it sits, the more delicious this dish gets!

Wow! served w/a nice wedge salad, this hot buffalo dip changes from a Superbowl &/or potluck offering, to a great make-ahead date nite meal, w/flexibility for low carb &/or low fat as needed (spritz lettuce wedge with touch of oil then use a fat free vinaigrette, topped w/just a touch of blue cheese, diced tomatoes and onion).  It's so encouraging to have another diet-friendly date nite meal to add to our rotation (let alone an optionally diet-friendly potluck/football/etc. dish in the family cookbook).  While Frito scoops are perhaps the yummiest option for dippers, celery is surprisingly satisfying, helping me to avoid the desire for more scoops after I tried them initially, just to note the difference for others.  Hubs love this so much more when we pulled out the Frank's and he could add a good deal of extra sauce; but the kids, who ate theirs while watching a movie together in another room, could handle the heat in the original recipe, without being ready to tolerate more Frank's mixed in.  When using FF cream cheese & possibly low fat cheddar just for garnish, the dip becomes a little grainy, but w/added Frank's sauce (diluted with tomato sauce and water for those who can't take extra heat), the feel of graininess diminishes significantly (though not altogether).  We hope to try subbing at least some low-fat, large curd cottage cheese soon, as well as ground turkey, to see how that might impact the texture when using FF cream cheese.

My husband and I love this.  I enjoy making it for get-togethers as it is super easy and quick.  Instead of Blue Cheese I substitute Ranch since we like that better.  Other than that small change, everything is left the same.  Once everything is together I transfer it to a crock pot to stay warm.

This is a traditional superbowl recipe. I use fresh boneless chicken-3 pieces. I like my chicken moist so I marinade it in lime juice, garlic, and touch of EVOO and use the george forman grill to keep it super juicy. This is a hot dish but super addicting. Instead of dipping the whole grain tortilla scoops we arrange the scoops on the plate and spoon the dip into the chips. Less messy I suppose.

We love hot but this was just too much heat.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of fresh chicken versus the canned stuff (we had some left over in the refrigerator). I will half the amount of hot sauce next time and then add slowly until we reach our desired heat level.

first time making a buffalo chicken dip....came out great!  i used my own roasted chicken; lower fat cream cheese and home made smoked blue cheese dressing.  i also added shredded cheddar instead of the mozzarella/blue cheese.  my DH didn't want me to make it but i had everything on hand and forged on.  he loved it!  :-)

UPDATE: ALTHOUGH YOU CAN REHEAT YOUR DIP (I HAD PLENTY OF LEFTOVERS!), KEEP IN MIND THAT IT WON'T BE *QUITE* THE SAME. OUR DIP WAS OK, BUT THE TEXTURE WIERDED US OUT A LITTLE LOL. :) FANTASTIC!!! What can I say???? Buffalo chicken ANYTHING is yummy, let alone a gooey-cheesy dip form of it. :) Needless to say, this did not disappoint in the least! Since the weather turned for the worse, my hubs and I decided to stay in to watch the XLVII Superbowl. Instead of our usual dinner, I decided to make a few munchies to nosh on during the game. This was one of two appetizers I prepared. I pretty much stayed true to the recipe, but did make a couple of changes in order to use up a few ingredients in my fridge / pantry. I used half mozzarella, half blue cheese and instead of blue cheese dressing, I subbed Ranch (to compensate for adding the blue cheese crumbles). I also upped the wing sauce by ~ 1/4 c. Perfecto! Chicken flavored crackers (Nabisco Chicken in a Biskit) and carrot / celery sticks were perfect "dunkers" for our dip. If anyone knows buffalo wings, it's got to be Frank's. :-) Enuf said!

Love this recipe. The key is the blue cheese since it balances the hot sauce-don't skimp on it. We just throw everything in a bowl together and keep adding until it tastes right, but usually at least a full bottle of Franks, but being from Buffalo we like it hot! As for the excess oil... drain it halfway then at the end using some paper towels, you won't lose the flavor.

We hosted a Memorial Day weekend kick-off party on Friday, where I made up a bunch of chicken thighs and drumsticks, and we had leftovers.  When we were headed to a party that Sunday, I figured I'd throw something together at the last minute, and this was it.  Only substitutions were shredded Italian six-cheese blend for the cheese and 1 lb. of shredded chicken I roasted myself. I also pulsed in the food processor for a smoother consistency and cooked five minutes in the microwave once I got there. All I took home was  Rave reviews and an empty casserole.  =)

I am now required to bring this to every potluck and there are always new people wanting this recipe. I have modified it by adding some sharp cheddar to the top and baking it for 40-45 minutes. This cooks the flavors together more and browns the cheese on top a little. Yummy!

high 5s allround! I swapped the canned chicken for a boneless skinless breast that I poached and cut into chunks. I also Added diced celery into it and sprinkled on top for some crunch. Deee-LISH!

I had this at a Super Bowl party and had to make it myself. It was great, I used ranch instead of blue cheese and a little more RedHot for some extra spice but other than that I followed it to a tee.

Absolutely delicious--a quick and tasty alternative to messy chicken wings!  Served it with celery and flatbread...at the end of my parent's 50th anniversary party the bowl was scraped completely clean!  Thanks for a great appetizer!!

I couldn't wait to make this, but it was just ok, not great.  Ok for a small taste when there is lots of other stuff to pick from.  I used Perdue short-cuts instead of canned.  The consistency is better warm vs. hot, it is less runny.

I made this for superbowl & everyone loved it, the only thing is the orange color does not look presentable after it cooled down. The flavor is there, I think I will use chik. breast & boil it then shred it instead of using canned. Very good recipe.

By far, a must-have at any gathering!  When I make this dip, I don't add the 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese or mozz cheese.  It's really not needed - and - instead of baking it in the oven, I just leave it in a small crock on warm, that way it's always hot and ready to go.  And we use tostito's to dip with - YUMMY!!

I make this for parties all the time and it is always a hit. This Halloween I doubled it and put it in a crock pot to keep warm and took it to a party and it was literally gone in less than 10 minutes. Even my friends who say they hate blue cheese gobble this up.

I LOVE Buffalo chicken dip and so does anyone else who tries it!!! 

I can't stand the smell and taste of canned chicken so I always cook my own; and I cook the chicken in additional hot sauce to give it a little bit extra of a kick!! I also sometimes mix it up between blue cheese and ranch dressing, and melting just a little bit of shredded cheddar on top..mmm!! Can't wait to have it again soon!!!

I took this to a football party and kept it warm in a fondue pot and it was a hit!  I served it with Frito Scoops and Chicken In A Biscuit crackers.  I also used mozzarella instead of the add'l blue cheese.  Will definitely make this again!

Made a double batch of this for a weekend at the cabin.  It was by far the most loved recipe of the weekend.  There was not one drop left to take home!  Several people told me that this was the best chicken wing dip they ever had.  The ONLY thing I changed was I was grilled chicken breast and cut it up into chunks instead of using canned chicken -- I also used crumbled blue cheese vs. the mozz...thanks for such a GREAT recipe!

Awesome dip!  Its been a big hit every time I bring it to a party.  I use the moz cheese, substitute ranch for blue cheese, and grill 1 lb of chicken breast instead of using the canned chicken breast.  Serve with Scoops and it goes fast!

Delious and easy, a huge hit at the party I took it too.  The blue cheese dressing makes the dip extra tangy!!

Huge favorite!!!  Have made this twice and it gets gobbled up in a matter of minutes.  First time I served with Frito Scoops which was excellent.  But this last time I took it to a party and served it with celery sticks, baby carrots, and pita chips.  It was as big or more of a hit.  Everyone especially loved it with the celery.  This recipe is a real keeper!

My only change to this recipe was to replace the canned chicken with 1 whole fresh chicken breast, simmered for 15 minutes in 1 C. chicken broth flavored with 1 tsp.salt, 1 tsp. onion flakes, 1/2 tsp. coarsely-ground black pepper, and 1 Tbsp. parsley flakes.  I then cut the cooled chicken into 1/2" cubes.

Really delicious! I, like others, was skeptical about using canned chicken. It doesn't taste bad, but it didn't smell good. I will just use shredded cooked chicken breast next time. I used Frank's buffalo wing sauce and crumbled bleu cheese, and it was awesome. It really satisfied my craving for wings. Will make again!

I have had this dip before and decided to make it for a Superbowl Party. Super easy to make and just perfect without changing anything! Never realized canned chicken was so expensive. Will definately do my own chicken next time.

I've made this dip at least ten times and it's always a huge hit!! I used Texas Pete's hot sauce (bc it's what I had on hand) and shredded mozzarella. This dip is a keeper for all buffalo wing lovers!!

This is the best basic buffalo wing dip on all rec. Do go with the crumbled Blue and not the mozzarella. I sub cooked chicken breast for the canned, and add black pepper, some crushed red chilis, a little garlic powder, and just a very small amount of grated cheddar.

So, so good! We did use a hidden valley ranch packet & sour cream in lieu of the blue cheese, but kept all proportions the same. It was devoured & will be a party regular, thanks!!

So delicious! I prepared this just as the recipe directed using shredded mozzarella cheese as opposed to blue cheese crumbles and I also melted some mozzarella on top too. The canned chunk chicken tasted just fine with this and so easy to add. This will be a MUST at every party we throw! Absolutely loved it!! If you are a true traditional buffalo wing lover then you will love this too.

This was a crowd pleaser last night.  I used rotisserie chicken, 1/2 cup of ranch, 1/2 cup of Franks hot sauce, 1 package of light cream cheese, ½ cup of sharp cheddar, ½ cup of part-skim mozzarella and ½ cup of celery.  You could easily use light ranch dressing and not tell a difference.

made this for a pot luck at the office.   it was everyone's favorite.  I made it in the crock pot.  It was great and very easy.  I did not add the blue cheese crumbles because it was very strong on the blue cheese flavor.  next time I might add less blue cheese dressing or sour cream and add the crumbles

My family of 5 just wiped out a double batch and I sent a triple batch with my som on a ski trip!!  I chopped up sliced deli chicken this morning and it was an awesome substitute. Plan to use turkey leftovers to make this next time.  We prefer the Frank's Wing Sauce to the original "hot sauce".  What a hit!!!  Thanks Jenny E for sending me this recipe.

I make this allt the time! However, I change a couple things.  First I always use Franks Red Hot Buffalo Sauce. Instead of blue cheese dressing I use ranch dressing. I use the crumbled blue cheese. I always cook a chicken breast and cube it in small pieces. We use celery and tostitos to eat it! YUMMY!! It always goes at the party!!

I love love love this recipe. and so do all of my friends... I like to use a little less of the cream cheese, and I go all out. I use both mozzarella cheese and crumbled blue cheese... I also like to use fresh boneless chicken breast. Boiled, dried and minced in the food processor.  Yum Yum

Amazingly good, in my opinion. I make it as is, except that I either use a rotisserie chicken or I roast my own chicken breasts and shred them. I usually only use blue cheese, but sometimes I use both cheeses. My favorite dipper is celery, but others  prefer tortilla chips. And Frank's Hot Sauce is WONDERFUL...

I "catered" my son's Super Bowl party.  Of all the items I made, THIS one got the RAVE reviews.  Someone even asked him if I was "single"!!!  Very tangy, and with the Swanson's canned breast meat, SO VERY EASY!  With reviews like this I'll DEFINITELY make again! Thanks!

Excellent. Tastes just like buffalo chicken. Used ranch in place of the blue cheese dressing. I still used blue cheese crumbles and added mozzarella cheese. Also used fresh chicken and added garlic. Everyone loved this dip

This was amazing! Instead of canned chicken...I boiled my chicken breasts and then shredded them....I also recomend the wing sauce.

im giving this recipe only 4 stars because i think the canned chicken really ruined it i think.  If you make this PLEASE use fresh cooked chicken breast cooked however you like.  The chicken taseted like tuna because of how all canned meats are packaged in that same water solution.  I even had 2 people ask me if i added tuna... how embarrasing... save yourself and add fresh chicken!

I used reduced fat cream cheese and everyone still raved about this dip!  Great served with celery that has been soaked in the refrigerator overnight to make it crispy.

Love this recipe.  I make it all the time.  I substitute ranch dressing for the blue cheese and use shredded cheddar cheese.  It's cheaper.  Tortilla chips for dipping.  THE BEST!

This was good.....we usually make it a different way but this recipe had a quicker cooking time so we tried it. About ten minutes before it was done I added four big slices of velvetta cheese on top and some salsa. I think that made it even better.....if you are looking for quick and easy this is a good recipe.

Really yummy! Addicting for me! I mixed blue cheese and mozzarella in the mix.  I am a non blue cheese fan but this was good. If you are a lover of blue cheese I think you could use your favorite dressing which may have a stronger blue cheese flavor like Marie's salad dressing.  I used Frank's Red Hot Sauce but may use a different kind next time. I think it needed a little more zing.

I thought the recipe was great. My husband loved it. I did use the deep dish plate to mix in all in. But I used microwave to do the heating. It seemed easier and quicker to get the cheese and chicken to good dip consistency. Will make again. Great for get togethers

Everyone LOVED this chicken dip. I kept it hot in the crock pot all evening on Christmas Eve. We live in Florida where I shop at Publix. Publix deli makes the best fresh fried chicken daily so I used fresh chicken tenders, diced into small chunks, keeping the recipe exactly as written. SO Delicious!!

Awesome dip been making it for many years only things I do differently is despite what people say about canned chicken having better consistency I just find that using a fully cooked rotisserie chicken better quality. I removed the skin, and only use the white meat shredding it finely with a fork. One more change is I dont use mozzarella in it instead I use about half a brick of cracker barrel cheddar cheese. I also use different measurements for the ingredients . Oh and I find Tostitos work best for dipping. If you want to get rid of the liquidy red grease on top use a teaspoon to get most out then very gently dab it with a paper towel.

My go-to easy to throw together recipe.  I made adjustments to my preference, but it's a crowd pleaser. I use a cup of shredded cheddar, I substitute ranch dressing instead of blue cheese, and I boil chicken and shred it instead of canned. Basically a good guidance recipe.

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe. It is so easy to make and the first item to run out at my football parties. I've made it several times now with rave reviews. Works great with crackers, celery, or (my personal favorite) sliced red bell pepper. If you like buffalo, you gotta try this.

This dip is great. I like to experiment and try it with different things. I recently put the dip in egg roll wrappers and they were a hit at work.

I get requests to make this all the time. Some of my friends and family do not like blue cheese, so I use ranch dressing and shredded mozzarella. And instead of the canned chicken, I usually buy a rotisserie chicken and shred it myself.  We find it makes for a chunkier dip.

Although you don't need to add the blue cheese, it does give it a little extra something.  I've never put mozzarella.

This recipe is good! The only changes that I made was that I used Ranch dressing instead of Blue Cheese and I cooked the chicken myself. I just boiled a pound of boneless thighs and shredded it. I also used the blue cheese and not mozzarella. It didn't last long on the table!

12/13: did not add the extra blue cheese and it was still very good.  Sean and Matthew loved it, great with celery stix and grain type tortilla chips (must be firm otherwise they break).  Also, i did n't use canned ckn, sauteed up a chicken breast and cubed it small.  next time could use a little more chicken.  although matthew said there was enough chicken it just sunk to the bottom.  heat in oven and then transfer to tiny chocolate crock pot to stay warm.

I make this dip for every NFL game party I host at my house. Sometimes my husband and I just make it for dinner. The only thing I change which makes a SIGNIFICANT  difference is that I buy a rotisserie chicken the day I am making it and use that instead of canned chicken. It will completely change the recipe making it amazingly good! I use approximately half the chicken and shred it very finely. Trust me. If you are going to take the time to make this buy a rotisserie chicken. Good luck and enjoy!!!

Always a hit with our home, and when taken to events. Do not use generic hot sauce though. It is not the same for sure! We use scoops chips to serve with, but have also used this as a topping to hot dogs, and for nachos.

I've had this many times at parties but never made it myself.  I enjoyed this recipe and used mozzarella cheese in the dip and on top.  I didn't have problems with oil pooling on top of the dip.  Thanks for a delicious recipe.

This was bad.  I really like blue cheese, but this was too much.  I agree with other reviews that you need to use other cheese.  It changes the recipe so I am rating this because I made it exactly as written.

Made this for Christmas and was a huge hit!  I make a few variations.  I use 2 (8oz) pkgs cream cheese, 1/2 C ranch dressing, 1/2 C Franks redhot buffalo wing sauce, 1/2 C crumbled blue cheese, 2 cans swanson chicken. I heat all the ingredients together in a pan on the stove and mix it together.  Then place in 9x13 dish and sprinkle on top a little bit of cheddar cheese and bake as stated on the recipe.  We use scoops chips for dipping.  Amazing!!

People always ask me for this recipe when I make it.  Using the bleu cheese gives it a flavor depth that sets this recipe apart from other recipes, but it is not overpowering.  Like others have mentioned, I do NOT use canned chicken.  Buy some boneless/skinless chicken breasts, bring a pot of water to a boil, throw them in for about 20 minutes or so, then shred easily with two forks.  We also sprinkle a little cheddar cheese on top prior to baking.

I've made this tons of times and it's always a hit. Instead of blue cheese dressing I use Ranch  and instead of blue cheese or mozzarella cheese I use shredded cheddar. Small changes but I personally think it makes it taste better.

I was a little worried about using canned chicken (canned meat and veggies have a funny after taste) but I was really pleased with how this turned out.  I only used 1 can of chicken (next time I'll use 2) and I had to sub shredded monterey jack and ranch dressing because thats what I had on hand.  I will make sure I pick up the blue cheese dressing for next time.  This tastes exactly like the dip my friends make up at their cottage.  They have named theirs "chicken crack" because it's so addictive.  Thanks for recipe

I make this dip often for friends & family.  Everyone LOVES it.  However, if you do not like hot stuff, beware! My family love heat so we just find it pleasant, but best to warn the feint of heart before they dive in!

Made this for a bbq I went to and it was a big hit! everyone loved it. Had just enough kick of spice to it. I used ranch dressing instead of blue cheese and mozzarella cheese instead of crumbled blue cheese. VERY DELICIOUS!!!!

Love this dip, it's become my fave go-to dish!! My family asks for it by name! However, I used ranch dressing instead of blue cheese and sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella. I plan to follow the exact recipe one day, and will post another review if it differs from this one.

Delicious! We used both the shredded mozzarella and the blue cheeses crumbles. I don't even like blue cheese, but it tasted great in this recipe. We used a milder buffalo sauce, so it wasn't too hot either.

This is my go-to appetizer when I want to please a crowd. It's easy and addictive. I use neufchatel cheese instead of the full fat version and light blue cheese from the refrigerated section (Marie's or Lighthouse), preferably the Yogurt kind. I sometimes layer the neufchatel cheese on the bottom and the rest of the ingredients on top, but both ways are good. It's best served with pita chips and celery.

Very creamy and excellent.  The dip was easy to make and gone in less than 30 minutes, please asked me to make more for the next time.  I used a little bit more of the bleu cheese dressing.

Used Red Hot bbq wing sauce instead- didn't want it to be too spicy, but I think it came out too mild. Other than that... devine

AMAZING!!!!! My husband is not a fan of spicy food so I used part Frank's hot sauce, and part Texas Pete wing sauce to make it slightly more mild.  It still had quite a kick and he loved it!  In the future I will use REAL chicken breast though. The canned is too tough and stringy, plus I personally would prefer about 3-5 ounces more than the recipe calls for.  Otherwise, this is a perfect recipe that I will DEFINITELY use in the future. :)
Update: I made this again and DOUBLED the bleu cheese. It gave it that great tangy taste but wasn't overwhelming.  I do have family members who don't like bleu cheese at all so I would suggest using feta cheese instead if you're looking for a substitution. Plus, this time I did use 1 1/2 sauteed chicken breasts, chopped finely, and it is SO MUCH better than the canned version! I will never make it any other way! This is a wonderful indulgence for anyone on a low-carb diet if eaten with celery, other veggies, or even topped over a salad.

It was a little too spicy for my tastes but it is still really really good. Although, I decided on ranch instead of blue cheese just because of personal taste.

I gave this four stars on the condition that I used Ranch dressing instead of blue cheese dressing and mozarella because I don't like blue cheese.  It is still very hot and tasty.

I have never given any recipe a poor rating. This would have been a great recipe if the blue cheese dressing was cut in half or omitted - the blue cheese was overpowering!

Made dip for a small get together this past Friday night.  Dip was OK, but nothing to rave over. Made as directed, except I used ranch dressing instead of blue cheese dressing. Probably will not make again as I have other time tested dips to fall back on.

If you are looking for a great buffalo chicken dip, this is the recipe! It is so quick and easy to make and tastes delicious! I love bleu cheese so it is not too over powering for me. I haven't tried making this with canned chicken, I either use leftover chicken from a rotisserie or I shred one boneless chicken breast. Use a quality bleu cheese dressing like Marie's, it will make the dip perfect! I suggest getting blue corn chips to eat this with and celery on the side!

Love this.  The extended family thought there was too much hot sauce, but it was perfect.  Any less and it would be Buffalo.

Yummy!!! I made this exactly to the recipe and felt it came out more like a chicken salad than dip.  Still delicious. The next time, I used half the recommended chicken and a handful more cheese.  It came out more creamy and dip like. Either way, fantastic!!  I used light cream cheese and dressing so the ladies felt better about devouring it.

I made a double batch of this dip for a party and people literally scraped the bottom of the croc pot within an hour:-) I used Frank's Buffalo sauce and a low fat blue cheese dressing, low fat mozarella and low fat cream cheese and it was STILL awesome. Try serving with Blue Corn chips..its a nice color and flavor combo.

This was super easy and a hit with everyone.  I love blue cheese so I loaded it up with chunky dressy.  If you aren't as much of a blue cheese fanatic I recommend mixing in Ranch dressing.

I absolutely love this stuff!!! Everytime we have people over, my boyfriend demands that I make it!! I like to actually boil a couple chicken breasts, and shred it myself, because it gives it a better texture. I can't tell you how many times guests have asked for this recipe!! It's my little secret!! :)

Im not a fan of blue cheese anything. So ranch and mozzarella it is. Excellent recipe. Nothing beats chicken fresh out of the yard though. Canned is never the way to go. The fresher the better.

VERY TASTY! I used mozzarella and crumbled blue cheese both. I used chicken breast instead of canned. I used a local company's (Cookies Brand) Wings and Things Sauce. It wasn't as spicy as I expected, but extremely good! I imagine using Frank's would make it have a little more kick, but just assuming. I will definately make this agin!

I usually make a recipe exactly as is, but for this one I used fresh chicken breast instead of the canned chicken.  I used canned chicken before and thought it was just like tuna fish!  I cooked the chicken in a crockpot on low until tender & easy to shred.  I follwed the recipe after that and used Frank's Hot Buffalo Sauce and used the moz. cheese instead of crumbled blue cheese since I used the blue cheese dressing.  I love hot stuff and boy was this Frank's hot!!!!  Next time I may use regular Frank's.  Good recipe though, thanks!

This was a HUGE hit at my 10 year old daughters birthday party.   Served with tortilla chips and wrote a little note next to the dish that said "try it - you'll like it".   They did and they wiped it out fast!

Really tasty dip! I cooked my own chicken breast then shredded and chopped it. I then mixed in the wing sauce, cream cheese, ranch dressing over low heat.  I removed from the heat and stirred in the blue cheese crumbles. Served with crackers, carrots and celery. YUM

I followed it exactly (with 1/2 cup blue cheese crumbles) and served it at a football party with rave reviews!  The second time I used the 1/2 cup of blue cheese crumbles and added 1/4 cup shredded mozz. cheese.  I thought it was even better and everyone loved it!  I gave the recipe to 5 different people :).  I love this and will be making it often!!!

This was very popular at our company potluck today! Everyone had some and went back for seconds. As for the person that swears by Swanson canned chicken, gross. I've had this recipe before by a person that used canned chicken and the globs of fat and what could only be described as unchewable rubber were intolerable. Have fun with that. Anyway, I used baked chicken breasts and cut them into little shredded cubes and then followed the recipe accordingly. The dip was served warm and was gone after only a half-hour!!! I think I will be forced into making this dip again.

This is an amazing dip!  I made it for New Year's Eve and it was gobbled up in no time.  My husband has even requested that I make him his own batch next time!  The only change to the recipe that I made was that I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of the mozzarella or blue cheese crumbles.  This was just personal preference.  I served it with tortilla chips and stalks of celery.  It was definitely a hit and I will absolutely be making it again.

I love this recipe!  To cut the strong bleu cheese flavor, I use ranch dressing rather than bleu cheese, and use the bleu cheese crumbles, per the recipe.  DELICIOUS!

Loved it.  Wil make again.  Only change... because I am a wuss with the hot stuff... I will cut the Franks Hot Sauce to 1/3 cup to see if that cuts the heat a little.  I served it with Stacy Pita Chips - Delish!

I used both blue cheese crumbles and mozz, as I'm a cheese freak. Took this to a party and everyone loved it. I went a head and used Tyson canned chicken (in water) for convenience. My family didn't realize it was canned chicken and were surpirsed to find out it was. I will definitely make this again.

Great dip!! I made this for the first time a couple months ago to bring to a house warming party and everyone loved it. Since then I've been making it for the Sunday Night football games. I use mozzarella cheese instead of the blu cheese and I serve it with Tostitos Scoops. It's a party favorite. Thank you so much for this recipe!

This was the best. My hubbie and I really enjoyed it while watching the game! I boiled the chicken also and used mozzarella cheese instead of the blue cheese. Blue cheese would have been too much. Also used light cream cheese and light blue cheese dressing and you cant even tell....it was so tasty! Thanks!

This is by far the best dip ever. It has the kick that is just right. Truelly tastes like buffalo wings. I've made this so many times for friends/family. Instead of biue cheese dressing and blue cheese I use ranch dressing and mozzarella cheese. Mmmmmmmm!

Great dip for parties- can't wait to use it during football season! I used low fat cream cheese and light dressing. Also, I didn't have blue cheese on hand so I used feta instead. I prefer blue, but for those who think it's too pungent, the feta is much more mild and still tastes great in the dish.

Everyone loved this recipe. I used ranch dressing and mixed cheese instead. Delish! I think it was best dipped with tortilla chips.

My family loves this recipe. Instead of blue cheese crumbles I used 1/2cup grated Mozzarella and 1/2 cup Ranch dressing instead of blue cheese dressing. I also boiled my own chicken(2breasts) and shredded that since I had some in the freezer. Now I make this for every party and not just my own:)

I make this all the time.  The only difference is I don't add the bleu/mozzerella cheese as it sometimes over powers the taste.  Also I usually put in 3 TB garlic salt.  A deifnite favorite with my teenage daughter and her friends!!

Great Recipe! My husband had this dip at New Year's Eve Party and raved over it.  I love that this recipe, unlike some similar recipes, doesn't call for butter.  If you are not fond of blue cheese substitute 1/2 of the blue cheese dressing with ranch dressing. I've had this with or without the cheese and it is really good both ways!

This was absolutely delicious. Instead of 1/2 cup of hot sauce, I added 1 cup. I also added 2 cups of mozzarella cheese. I love it really cheesy! Great recipe!

A great tasting dip.  I happened to have Texas Pete's wing sauce, so I used that instead. There was a definate kick, but it was awesome!  So easy and a hit!

This stuff is amazing!  As others have said, everyone love it.  We had tons of different kinds of food at our Super Bowl party, but this was definitely the favorite.  We used real chicken (boiled and shredded) instead of the canned chicken (which I'm sure is just supposed to make this a time saver or something).  I would certainly suggest boiling a couple chicken breasts and shredding them instead of canned.  This will become a regular for our parties!

Tried this for Super Bowl Sunday, it was really good.  I had left over chicken breast in the frig so I used that (never used canned chicken and don't want to even try it).  I only used 1/4 cup of the hot sauce because of some people not liking really hot/spicy food (I am one o of those people), and it was perfect, hubby added more hot sauce to his.  We had it with tortilla chips, really, really good.

Excellent and everyone loved it.  I left out the chicken for the vegetarians in the bunch. Also used crumbly blue cheese instead of mozzarella and classic Franks..  I thought the proportions were exactly right.

This was so easy and ridiculously good!  I didn't use canned chicken, but boiled breasts instead.  I wanted mine a bit more crusty so I upped the mozzarella to a full cup.   Great recipe!!

Outstanding!  This is not what I wold consider "too hot"  I think the cheeses ofset the hot sauce in a perfect fashion. I prepared as above, and made it with only once can of Chicken.  This is going in my list of favorites for sure!

This is the best dip ever!!  I have made this several times now and it is always a hit.  I like to serve it with grilled bread too.
