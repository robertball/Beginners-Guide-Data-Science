Fabulous dressing! It's great to find a buttermilk ranch dressing that doesn't contain mayo! Even though I like mayo this was a really refreshing change especially if you're looking to cut fat and calories. I used low-fat buttermilk and a light sour cream. I upped the dill a bit and used fresh chives instead of dried. I added a bit of sugar to taste and it as perfect for salads and as a veggie dip!

Yummy! We do like Mayo, but I wanted to do a healthier alternative.  I actually use 1 cup fat free plain yogurt, and 1/3 cup Light Sour Cream, and  1/3 cup Veganaise grapeseed oil Mayo. (sometimes a splash of buttermilk too) I'm sure it would be great as written though, and the spices are just perfect!  My husband likes a thick dressing and LOTS of it. He is also so picky about his Ranch (he was attached to the bottled stuff) But he absolutely LOVES this.  He eats it every day at lunch on his Salads. I did NOT want to be feeding him MSG and tons of fat and preservatives everyday, so this recipe is a Lifesaver!

Great substitute!  I personally do not like mayo and I do not like the taste of the store bought ranch.  When preparing this, I did not use salt and I used tarragon instead of chives (I didn't have any).  I will make this again.

I love this!  It works well as a salad dressing or dip for veggies.  I used it as a dressing for potato salad and it was delicious.  When I first tasted it I thought something was missing something.  I added 1/2 tsp. of sugar and thought it was perfect.  Thanks!

This was a miss for Hubs and me - as in, we missed the slight tang of the mayonnaise! Adding a squeeze of lemon juice was a real improvement, but without it this was flat tasting - essentially lightly seasoned and thinned out sour cream.  If not mayo, add a dribble of vinegar or a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.

this is delicious. It is good with veggies and on salads. It is even good on your fingers. I am going to use it the next time I make hot wings,too. Thank you so much for a recipe for ranch dressing that I don't feel guilty about eating and doesn't pack on the pounds.

This is a great little mayo-free dressing!  In an attempt to eat healthier I was looking for low-fat/fat free dressing recipes and found this one.  I made it but didn’t use it for a day, so it set in the refrigerator overnight and that allowed the flavors to combine.  I’m really glad to have this recipe; it’s hands down a better option than the low-fat/fat free dressings in the store.

Love it! Love it! And we like mayo, too. It's a great all around dressing to doctor up or not. Do try it! Leftovers a long time in the fridge, too.

Awesome! I actually whipped it up to use as a dipping sauce for Poppers and thought it was much better than I had anticipated. Delicous.

This was a easy recipe to make. My hubby loved it. He hates mayo and he said that he likes this better than store bought ranch. I thought it was ok and my guest agreed with me. It tastes to much like sour cream. After it sat for 24 hours it tasted much better. Will use again only cause the hubby likes it.

I think this is very good.  Just as good as the famous Ranch on the grocery store shelves.  The best part is no MSG.  Did you know every creamy grocery item on the shelves has MSG.  Do you have headaches?  It very well may be MSG.  I avoid all msg products like the plague.

Alright... good substitute when in a pinch.  However it is vital to let sit in fridge for an hour or so.  Any less and certain ingredients stand out... longer you chill, the better the flavors blend into one taste.  very yummy after that:)

This is a very good recipe; however might I suggest using fresh chopped onion and crushed garlic.  It gives more depth to the dressing.

my daughter made this for the first time. very good dressing, even though she used too much buttermilk, was able to save with adding more sour cream.

I needed some ranch dressing for a pasta salad and had sour cream and buttermilk to use up.  I like it without the mayo but if you are looking for something like the bottled stuff then keep looking.  This is refreshing and has a better taste.  I did double everything except the sour cream, buttermilk, salt and pepper.  I am pretty sure I will be using this recipe again.  Thanks!

This was pretty lackluster, to us.  I made it in a pinch when i had no store bought ranch for Mr. LTH for grilled chicken salads and it was NOT a hit. I thought I'd like it because I'm not a mayo fan, but not so much....

I had high hopes for this recipe after reading the reviews , but ended up being rather underwhelmed.  The texture was far too runny for me, so I'd cut back the buttermilk to 1/4 cup next time.  Also, the flavor wasn't quite right (perhaps a little bland) so I increased the dill, onion powder and salt all to 1/2 teaspoon.  Tasted much better the 2nd day!

I followed the recipe as stated except for the dried chives (couldn't find them in the grocery store).  We used this on top of Taco Salad II cause my family loves "ranch" type dressing on everything.  I liked the fact it didn't have the mayo.  The family really liked it.

Very, very close to what I was looking for. For us, it needed triple the spices, except the salt and pepper. Very simple and quick to make in a matter of seconds for a woman who's not only cleaning out her fridge and feeling VERY guilty about her food choices for the day. ;)

I am only giving this 4 stars because i lacked 2 of the ingrediants and had to compromise. I didn't have garlic powder used granulated garlic and did not have buttermilk so did the substitution with 2% milk and vinegar. everyone still liked it and i was told to not buy ranch ever again :)

I'm on a special diet that limits sugar and carbs for a short period of time. I'll be eating a lot of salad and COULD NOT find a rand dressing without sugar, sucralose, dextrose, maltodextrin, etc... The buttermilk did have some sugar in it but wasn't as bad as store brands. So I only used 1/4th of a cup and ended up with a creamier dressing. I love chives so I doubled up on those and added a bit more onion powder. I love bold flavors.  I tried it when first made on some cucumber slices. My sister, who loathes ranch tried it and literally licked the bowl (she's 20 years old) so that says something amazing about this dressing. I also made some great buffalo wings and this was amazing! Even better after sitting in the fridge for awhile. Thanks for the recipe. I'll be making it weekly, even after this diet is over!

This recipe tasted very strongly of sour cream.  It was very thick, so I might try more buttermilk/less sour cream next time.  It also seemed a little bland to me.  Next time I'll add fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, because I like my ranch with a strong garlic flavor!

This turned out pretty darn good, considering it's low fat. I'm still undecided about the addition of dried parsley, though. Definitely tastes better after it sits for a day but next time I'll try it without the parsley:o)

I was disappointed that this did not turn out for me. I made this last night and let it sit overnight to marinate. this morning, it tasted bland so I added a little lemon juice, later on, still bland and missing something ( suspected  it was the missing mayonnaise) so I added a pinch or so of white sugar and let it sit some more. It still did not really have that tang, zing or overall taste of ranch. however, I could taste all the fresh herbs and buttermilk was noticeable. This type of dressing may work for some people, as for myself, it just didn't do it for me this time. :(

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for!  Even with full-fat sour cream the calorie count is very low for a salad dressing.  I did not have the dried chives, I will get some and try it again.  Also IMO is needs more salt.  I thought 1/8 t seemed a bit low, but I left it since I like to make things the way it is written the first time I make it to have a reference point to go by in the future.  Other than the salt issue (easily fixed) the flavor is very good!  Thank you!

Yum! I actually used fat-free plain yogurt in place of the sour cream and also added a bit of dried basil. My only complaint is that the garlic and onion powders were a bit strong for me, so I would cut those down next time. Thanks!

My husband hates mayo so he automatically likes this better than a lot of dressings. I used thick Greek style yogurt instead of sour cream. I think I'll try adding a bit of sugar next time to off-set the sourness. Either that or use regular milk instead of buttermilk. I any case, you can't buy ranch dressing in Cyprus, so I'm happy to have a recipe to start with.

Not being huge fans of ranch dressing, my husband and I both enjoyed this dressing.  We used it on 'Hot n' Spicy Buffalo Chicken Salad' from AR and it complimented the salad really well. I liked the low-fat sour cream as opposed to the mayonnaise in the dressing.  Do make it up early so the flavors can meld.  Taste before using and add additional seasoning to your liking. I made up half a batch and wouldn't hesitate to use this recipe again.

I love this recipe! I didn't have dried chives, but I did have some in the freezer, so I used them instead. So fresh, yummy, and easy-peasy to make!

With some modifications, was great.  We can't have buttermilk, so I just used sour cream.  I did add some Apple Cider Vinegar and Lemon Juice to give it the zip it was missing from us not using buttermilk.  Also, found that I had to double the seasonings.  My husband and 8 year old daughter also think this dressing is great.

Wonderful light dressing. I am okay with mayo dressings but admit they can be heavy and take over the flavor of a salad. But this was a light ranch dressing that let the true flavor of our vegetable salad come through. The only change I did was use fresh chives from the garden, I didn't have dried. I did make it two hours before serving so it had time to marinate. Don't expect this to taste like the famous Ranch dressing in the grocery stores...it is a light ranch dressing.

Great tasting ranch dressing!  So easy to make!  Only tweaks made was adding extra of the seasonings, to suit our personal preference.   I always feel better about serving homemade dressings rather than store bought varieties that contain HFC, preservatives, artificial color & flavors, and ingredients I can't pronounce.  We have used this on salad, as a dip and along side wings.  Thank you for posting a great recipe!

This was really good, simple, and so much healthier than store bought.  I made it yesterday, and today hubby was putting it not only on his salad, but on his green beans too.  He doesn't know it's low fat and I'll never tell :)

I didn't care for this. Neither did my daughter who loves ranch. It was bland and was missing something BIG. It tasted a lot like watered down sour cream with a bit of spice. I followed others advice afterwards to try to doctor it up. Still wasn't good.

This dressing is excellent, I just added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and 1 packet of stevia.  It is essential to let this sit in the fridge for several hours.  Thanks so much for sharing a healthy / preservative free dressing!

Excellent!  
The only changes I made are that I used regular sour cream (not low fat) and added some extra salt at the end for flavor.
Love that I can have ranch again, being gluten, grain, and soy free!

The best low fat, low calorie ranch dressing recipie that I have ever tried.  It is low cal enough that you can use a lot of it on your salad without the guilt.  I have started using it as a dip with veggie trays.  Folks seem to like it because I don't tell them it is a low fat recipe (you know how that goes).  Preparing it ahead of time and then letting it sit in the refrigerator over night gives the flavors time to mix together.

For those of us who do not like mayo based dressings this is a nice alternative. Initially I found it to be a bit bland for my taste but I added a little Tony Cachere's seasoning salt and let it set overnight. It was great on my baked potato.

My kids like ranch with their veggies, and this is a great alternative to a big bottle of soybean oil. It's thick enough to use as a dip or a dressing.

While creamy and free of corn, gluten, and soy (hello new allergies), this had zero flavor. I ended up needing 4 teaspoons dill weed, 3 teaspoons parsley and chives, 2 teaspoons garlic and onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a little over 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. I also added a pinch of smoked paprika. Now it tastes like my previous homemade mayo based ranch dressing.

Love it.  The egg in the mayo is too strong for me in the other recipe.

I just made this recipe and had to taste it before putting it in the fridge. It is wonderful.I did substitute 1 cup whole plain yogurt for the buttermilk and 1/3 cup greek whole yogurt  (I think it tastes like sour cream). I have been looking for a ranch dressing recipe using yogurt and this is the best!!! Thank you

Since I don't care for Mayonnasie I was glad to try this one
I found that it was not as thick as I would have liked and I also it didn't have enough seasoning in the recipe it was very plain. I would need to double the seasoning to make it better.
I did enjoy the lack of Mayo.

I made a dairy free version of this recipe due to food allergies. I used canned coconut milk and a few drops of lemon juice. It was just great.

So good! I didn't have chives so used a 1/2 teas of marjoram instead and used 1/2 teaspoon of all other spices in recipe. Excellent!

I absolutely love this!  I sometimes trade out some of the dried herbs for fresh, but this is so nice, light, and cool; it's perfect!

I am a mom of 4 and always trying to push more veggies....and am always short on time.  I had just set carrots on the dinner table and realized I was out of ranch (and mayo!), which means my girls won't touch their carrots.  I hopped on here to find a recipe and was able to whip this up in under a minute.  I don't have onion powder or dill, or chives, and still they loved it! I did use a powdered buttermilk I had recently purchased since I always find I buy buttermilk for a certain recioe and throw the rest away.  The powdered stuff is there when you need it....but I did NOT add the water portion that the powdered buttermilk calls for....so that it would be a nice consistency.  Thumbs up!

I don't like mayo so this recipe was just what I needed.  I absolutely LOVE ranch but always felt guilty with the MSG and/or preservatives.  This is an awesome and easy recipe!  You can cut in half or double so easily too.  I didn't have chives or parsley and it's still great!

This does not taste like ranch.  It's very much a seasoned sour cream.  If you add 1-2 t. of vinegar it gets better, but it's still just not ranch.  Sorry!

This is the best ranch dressing I have ever tasted. I am a huge fan of ranch but often wonder how much extra salt, sugar, and preservatives I'm consuming with the bottled stuff. This is so fresh and delicious and I will never buy bottled ranch again.

Thanks for posting this recipe. Mayo doesn't like me so I'm always looking for mayo free dressings. This recipe is easy and very good. I find it is better the next day. This will be a staple.

Excellent! I agree with others that it's better after "resting" in the fridge a while. I prefer to use the fresh herbs, garlic and onions so readily available all year round but it's a terrific dressing either way. Krys

im pregnant and prefer not to risk using mayo in my recipes since it is made with raw eggs.  this recipe was such a wonderful substitute, just the right spices and creaminess.
