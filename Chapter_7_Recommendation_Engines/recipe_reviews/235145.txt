I made this recipe but added a can of NACHO CHEESE and whipped the nacho cheese together with my cream cheese. A real winner at my party. I browned the ground beef and added the salsa in with the beef mixture. I topped it off with shredded cheddar jack and baked as directed!!! A real winning dip for any occasion.

I make a complete meal from this recipe just add lettuce uncooked tomatoes,raw onion(green or reg.)one ww tortilla(heated in the microwave).I don't make dips because they ruin our appetite for dinner but this makes a complete meal easily.I also use weight watchers cream cheese because it comes in little individual containers and I can use less.Don't forget the sliced avocado for the top.

I made this for appetizers on Christmas day. It was DEVOURED! I made just like it said, using the recipe for "Taco Seasoning I" here on the site. I also did as one other reviewer suggested and added a can of nacho cheese soup to the cream cheese mixture. I blended that together with a hand mixer. After it came out of the oven I sprinkled shredded lettuce and black olives over the top. Next time I think I will add some black beans or find a way to layer in some refried beans. Yum!

I got rave reviews on this when I made it for a Margarita Night party at my condo. I adjusted the recipe like others had suggested by adding cheddar cheese soup to the cream cheese. I also used a full jar of black bean and corn salsa and two cups of cheddar/jack cheese mix on the top.

This was just OK for us.   Nothing terrible but nothing to write home about either.  It is a quick and easy recipe but I didn't like the distinct layers - the cheese on the top was hard to 'dip'.  All mixed up was much easier to eat although it didn't look great.

This is the same recipe my husband's grandmother makes for Christmas Eve every year! I made this for the first time myself last Saturday for a Football party and it was a hit! I even have it in the oven again as I type this review :) 

The only thing I do different is add my seasonings of Goya, garlic and onion powder,  and a little black pepper while I brown the ground beef with a chopped onion and a tsp. of minced garlic. Absolutely delicious!

I had leftovers from taco night which was the night before. I didn't feel like cooking so this night turned into leftover night. I had a little less meat than the recipe called for so I only used 2/3 of cream cheese. I reheated the taco meat, mixed in the cream cheese and a bit of spicy taco sauce (until smooth), layered with nacho cheese, Mexican corn and shredded Colby jack. Then heated in the oven as directed. Finally I topped it off with salsa, dice avocado and shredded lettuce. I served it as meal with fresh chips (nothin more than fried corn tortillas cut into triangles). My 6 yr is a picky eater when it comes to new things and he devoured it.

Delicious!  The only thing I did differently was add  extra cheese on top.  I won't do it again.  Too much cheese causes  the chips break when trying to scoop. 
This was an excellent recipe!  I never thought to add cream cheese on the bottom of the pan.  It brought an excellent depth of flavor.

This was really good. We turned it into a meal. Made the dip and then served it as burrito filling. Everyone enjoyed it. Will make again. So easy to throw together. I did not use the 1 cup of water. I just tossed the cooked meat with the seasoning and salsa.
