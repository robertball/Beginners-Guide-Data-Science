I am the creator of this recipe. 2 tablespoons dried does not make 2 tablespoons ground.   Here is a change that was not posted....I ground the rosemary to make 2 tablespoons ground.  Try doubling or tripling the rosemary to get 2 tablespoons.  Enjoy!

I was out of my regular Herbs de Provence so looked this up. I didn't have the lavender and started to skip the bay but decided to grind some up and see. The smell once ground was great so I went ahead and added it. I used this on "Slow-Roasted Beef for Sandwiches" and it was fantastic.

Almost perfect but there is no Lavender in Herbs de Provence, in any recipe, in France!  I lived there for 20 years.  Americans have confused and ruined the recipe by assuming that the Lavender that is produced in Provence for soap, is used in the mix.  It is certainly not.  Imagine putting lavender into your ratatouille and you get the picture.

Smells amazing! Can't wait to put it on EVERYTHING! I don't have a spice grinder so I used my good ole mortar and pestle, and I ground up my savory as well since it was pretty big pieces of leaves. I also had no bay powder, so I ground up a whole leaf (easier said than done but smelled yummy!).

I cut the recipe to 1/4 and used every ingredient as called for (even the lavender!).  Very nice blend of spices!  I will use this rather than try to buy some!  Thank you so much, Mariposa!

Bay leaves are not poisonous. Bay leaves are difficult to eat due to bitterness and being pointy. They can also cause esophageal discomfort and injury if swallowed.

This was great! used on a roasted chicken, worked like a charm. However, I think it should noted that bay leaves are slightly poisonous and should not be ingested.

Never heard of this spice blend before we got a spice carousel with it in it.  My son LOVES it, so I had to figure out how to make it.  Was able to find all the ingredients including the lavender at the health food store. A+

Very nice to make your own but the cost vs convenience of buying the bottle from the spice rack at the grocery store is huge!

I was in a jam, thought I had HDP on hand that my neighbor brought me back from France, but alas I couldn't find it! I had everything on hand but the savory and my dish was excellent. I will however add it later and I'll bet it will be even tastier. Thank you!

Easy to make. Adds great flavor to meats - esp. roast chicken.  I mix it with butter, & then put the mixture under the skin of the chicken. Then roast as usual.

I couldn't find Herbs de Provence seasoning so I made my own.

Very nice mix, I go without the bay powder though. To those confused-in North America, these blends are always sold with lavender. Nobody is quite sure why the change happened but I recommend trying it out!

I used the marked herbs to replicate the real thing—picked up for me in Provence. It tastes great in lots of different dishes. Just the rosemary, thyme and basil. 

The rest on this page is possibly nice for certain dishes, but I wouldn't just make up a batch of everything listed. You can always add one or two of the others on the list for a particular dish you're cooking.

The recipe was good, but it was in conjunction with a slow roasted prime rib.  Heat the oven to 500 then add the roast smothered in the herbs and leave at 500 for 30 minutes.  Blackened Herbs de Provence is not the flavor I want on my prime rib.

The only things I didn't have,  savory & lavender....otherwise I made it by the recipe...it is fabulous.  I mixed it with 2 soft cubes of butter, slathered an entire prime rib and it was perfecto!  Thanks Chef John.

I needed Herbs de Provence to make the Herb Crusted potato wedges recipe on this site and found this one. I didn't have lavender or savory or bay powder so I skipped them. It still tasted fantastic but I will be buying those items to make my own. Thanks for sharing.

Was right in the middle of making a dish when I realized I didn't have any more store bought. This recipe saved the day!

I love this mix, I added ground white pepper and sea salt. It smells delicious, with this batch I was able to fill up 2 small jars and gave one to my mother in law, she loved it too!!

What a good guide for a dummy like me!  Worked perfectly with Don's Savoury Saute potatoes!
