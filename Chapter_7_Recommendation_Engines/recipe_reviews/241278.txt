At 59 seconds there was an eggy explosion, sending egg all over microwave.  One egg of the two survived but the yolk was solid, some of the white was rubbery and the rest of the white was still liquid.  The kids didn't get poached eggs for breakfast but they did get an egg-cellent tutorial on how to clean a microwave.  Sorry - I really wish this had worked for us.

The key to preventing an egg explosion is to use a small enough dish so the water completely covers the eggs.  I've done it this way numerous times without an explosion and without poking the yolk. I've never used vinegar either- not sure why this is necessary. One minute twenty seconds is also the time I use for two eggs and they are just slightly runny.

You need to poke the yoke and cover with cling rap

I think 1 minute 20 seconds is way too long. There was an egg explosion in my microwave. Fortunately, I covered my bowl with a lid so I didn’t have to clean the entire microwave. 1 minute is sufficient time. If you want a runny yolk, I would recommend 45 seconds. Also, add more water for a “poached” egg. Mine turned out more like a hard-boiled egg but without the perfect egg shape. A little flavoring would be nice too. In my opinion, vinegar doesn’t go well with eggs. Maybe some salt and pepper would be better

I have been doing this for two years but I don't use vinegar and I only cook for 50 seconds. The time probably depends upon how powerful your microwave is.

Well, Bob, I agree with baking Nana.  And a recipe that leaves out the need to polk the yolk?  And protect the microwave?  Other than that, and 55 seconds rather than 120, with a little butter, salt, and pepper, the result is good.

Didn’t explode, but I didn’t like the taste of the vinegar. I may have put too much in but I wasn’t expecting the vinegar taste to stick around

I like this method, but you need to consider the strength of your microwave and reduce/increase either the power setting or the time.  I like it and I will do it again.   My microwave is 1000 watts - 1 min. 20 seconds was too long.  One egg popped at about 1:03.  I will try again and update this review.

I made it as written and showed my kids how to make it.  It was simple and easy for them to follow.  They each made their own eggs.  I still need to be present to ensure they don’t burn themselves with the  hot bowl and to help them take the eggs out of the bowl and place the eggs on a plate.  Thank you!

I was very pleased with the recipe, the only change I would make: if you like your yolks soft microwave for 1 minute or less. The water/vinegar mix is so hot it continues to cook the eggs and keep them warm a long time after cooking.
