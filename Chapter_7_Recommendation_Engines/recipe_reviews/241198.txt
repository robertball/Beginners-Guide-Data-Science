I didn't use the tomatoes and I steamed just the one lobster tail.  I had to adjust the time as the lobster tail that I cooked was on the smaller size. The lobster was wonderful. I thought that I could use the cooking liquid for a dipping sauce but it would be better served with clarified butter. Thanks for sharing.
