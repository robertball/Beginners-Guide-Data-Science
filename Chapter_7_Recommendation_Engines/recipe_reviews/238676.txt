My first time trying this recipe. I altered it a bit. I roasted 4 green chillies & 2 Jalapeños (instead of using cans) then I put them in a plastic bag so that the steam would soften them up. Once they cooled, I peeled each one, cut the ends off, opened them up, rinsed them so that there would be no seeds, then chopped into small pieces. Did everything else to the "T" & it was AMAZING!!!!

I used a rotisserie chicken, white meat only and added a can of tomatoes with chili's as well as a can of green chili's and a can of mild green enchilada sauce to chicken  mixture.  More sour cream and cheese. Perfect!

This is a delicious recipe. The only thing I changed was adding jalapenos along with the chiles and using the sour cream generously.

This recipe is good just as it is written.  Only changes made: used fresh jalapenos (2), used about a cup of sour cream and much more shredded cheese. Great recipe.

My Mexican husband asked me to make enchiladas for dinner, so I knew this dish already had a tough audience. My husband AND children loved this dish, beans an all! I was one proud mom and wife.

I love to make chicken and green chili enchiladas. I added taco seasoning to the sour cream, which is something I always do when making Mexican food.  It adds a little extra flavor that my family enjoys. I made this with canned whole green chili's and Mexican white cheese. I loved the corn, bell pepper and beans with the chicken, to add more texture. I used a green chili enchilada sauce with mango salsa mixed into it, as that is what I had on hand. Sometimes we need to tweak recipes to use what we have at home, rather than run off to the grocery store. This time it happened to turn out absolutely marvelous.

I had a few problems with this recipe.  The taste is good but there is no where near enough chicken mixture for 2 layers in the baking dish.  I added a whole can of corn and black beans too so I even had more than I should have.  

Ultimately there's no reason to bother with layering them tho because the tortillas are all just mush by the time it's all heated through.  The large can of enchilada sauce is way to much too.  I threw about half of it out.  

I will try another version of this tho because like I said, the taste is good.  The chicken mixture is delicious and would be really good as a normal enchilada filling.  I think I might also try it with just some tortillas on top and none at the bottom or in the middle because there's just no point in them.  Oh and less sauce, it was way to saucy.

I added a lot more cheese because I favor the cheesier cassarole.  This is a great tasting and easy recipe.  My friends over for dinner loved it.

I made this recipe as written with the exception of leaving out the bell pepper being we are not fond of them. It was an easy recipe to make and had a lot of flavor.

I love chicken enchiladas with salsa verde so this recipe was perfect. I followed the recipe mostly, my only changes were, I added fresh chopped jalapeño peppers and I seasoned it with salt, onion powder and garlic powder for a little more flavor. My family loved it too.

This was so good! I boiled some chicken breasts and used fresh veggies from the garden instead of frozen. I had the mild versions of the green chilies and green taco sauce, since that is what I already had in the pantry. I also made the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce on the Allrecipes website, since I didn't have it on hand.

I agree with Marisol Figueroa who added whole chiles, as well as Taco seasoning. I think more corn and more beans would be good, and next time I'll cook the bell pepper a little less, since I think the crunch would add something. The seasoning level was great though. I also substituted ground turkey for the chicken and that came out great also.

I followed the recipe rather closely with exception of making my own enchilada sauce & was disappointed by how bland it was despite the many different ingredients. The recipe did make a lot, so as long as I am putting extra salsa on it, it should be okay, but was hoping that wouldn't be necessary. I'm uncertain if I'll make this recipe in the future, but if I do I'll certainly include much more spice.
