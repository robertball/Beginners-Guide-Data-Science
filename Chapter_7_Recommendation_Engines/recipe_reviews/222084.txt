Simply delicious! And to think this is a healthier version of an all time favorite makes it even better.  This is very easy to throw together and perfect for a hearty weeknight meal. So if your're in the mood for Italian but think you don't have the time - think again. I added some fresh minced garlic to the ground turkey and onion. And, to the sauce I added a little red wine and some Italian seasoning to give a bit of a flavor boost. The sour cream was a nice change from the usual ricotta cheese as well as the carrot. I just eyeballed everything when layering. I covered it and baked it a little longer than 30 minutes leaving it uncovered for the last 10 minutes. Great with a fresh garden salad and warm bread!

This was a good spring board recipe.  I made a few changes that I believe made it not only healthier than this recipe, but tastier!  Rather than use plain turkey, use turkey Italian sausage.  If you can find it use smoked fresh mozzarella and chunk it up and add as a layer on top of the pasta as you do your layering.  Lastly, add more veggies, I added a whole broccoli stem and all chopped up along with adding a giant handful of spinach to the pasta right after it drained.  I also used about 1/2 of the amount of sour cream called for since I tossed the pasta and spinach with it before I started layering.  The result was a must make again baked ziti!  Yum.

A great re-make of one of my favorites.  I didn't think that the 50 Calorie per serving difference between the original and this recipe was that significant.  I used Whole Wheat Pasta, only 1 cup (8 oz) of sour cream, which I stirred into the pasta before layering.  I used only 3 slices of Provolone cheese.  These changes knock a few more calories off and the family didn't even notice.  Good stuff!

This is a great recipe that is customizable. I used vegetarian crumbles to make it meat-free, and added a thawed/drained box of frozen spinach. The provolone I thought I had turned out to be Havarti, didnt have mozzarella or sour cream, and in the interest of time and the spirit of creativity I substituted cheeses and just hoped for the best. Used the Havarti for the layer of provolone, considered yogurt but went with cottage cheese instead of cream, and used Colby instead of mozzarella. I started with sautéing onion and garlic to make the jarred sauce better, and left out the carrot. SO obviously I made a very different dish! But I layered and topped and baked as instructed and we had to stop ourselves from eating the entire pan. I plan to make this again using the same crazy cheese choices - maybe more cottage cheese this time, as it resembled ricotta. DELICIOUS!

I really enjoyed the flavor of this dish.  I would avoid adding the carrot unless you don't mind the crunchy texture in the sauce- I did add the carrot and even sauteed  it with the onion, but it still were pretty firm.  I would definitely make this again, but avoid the carrot.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I love the fact that ground turkey was used.  The cheeses and the sour cream worked well together.  I will say that I didn't use fat-free sour cream though, used the real stuff.  I also got a little confused when layering the items so I ended up just mixing them all together except for the last two.  At the end I did add 8oz of shredding mozzarella and then sprinkled the parm on top. I listened to some others and shredded the carrots instead of slicing.   I had some mushrooms that I needed to use up so I chopped up about 3-4oz of mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions and I also added 2 cloves of garlic(got to add garlic when using onions).  It really was a great dish and I will make again.

Loved this - I don't miss the beef at all, and I love that it's healthier and has carrots snuck in. I followed the recipe to the T with the addition of 1 more carrot since the one I had was small.  Threw it in into my food processor to get grated carrots (since someone said their carrots weren't cooked through).  I though this would be sweeter but it wasn't. I kept eyeballing the '2 jars of sauce' and wondering if it was all needed, but it was. I undercooked the ziti by 2 minutes and I'm glad that I did.  This totally filled my 9x13 which made me happy.  The only thing I would do differently next time is since I used provolone slices (that's what i had on hand and it kept the sauce from hitting the ziti), I would switch up the order and put the pasta, sauce, then provolone.  Used Barilla Mushroom which tasted great and added another veggie in there. UPDATE: Made this with 16 oz cottage cheese instead of the sour cream (which I did love also - it cooks into a ricotta-like texture) to make it even healthier and it just added to the cheesiness. Love it both ways, but the hubby went crazy over this and said he would bring this to any potluck.  20 month old ate it up too.

A good recipe. I cut it in half (except for the meat) and put it in an 8x8 pan.

I made this for supper last night, but I added some red pepper and fresh mushrooms along with the turkey and onions and carrot. It was great, but it lacked something. Next time I will use some fresh garlic as well. I made 1/2 the recipie and had leftover ground turkey, so I seasoned it and made little meat balls, fried them and then added it to the meat mixture, that was a nice bonus to bite into these. Good recipie.

My 4 year old and 6 year old loved this (and my husband too) and asked for seconds!  Some reviewers said that the carrots were a little too crunchy so I shredded mine instead of chopping them.  Turned out great that way.  Also I prepared this earlier in the day when the kids were at school and refrigerated it until it was time to bake.  It turned out perfect.

I really loved it - was cheesy, but tasty and easy to make a little ahead of time and then just pop into the oven.

I was a little leery of the sour cream layer, but it was GOOD!  I grated the carrot in the mini food processor and never knew it was there in the finished product.  I halved the recipe and misjudged the casserole dish size so I didn't get the layers just right, but it had everything in it.  DH hates casseroles but he actually said, "Is this new?  I think I like it."  Good recipe, you must try it.

Excellent results! I substituted non fat cottage cheese for the sour cream and used 1-1/2 jars of sauce. I will add sliced mushrooms next time.

This is delicious and is indeed "healthier" than standard baked ziti.  I have gone a step further and use whole grain pasta and my own homemade sauce where I can control the sugar, salt, and seasonings.

I increased the carrot amount to two large carrots and I also threw in some fresh minced garlic, one chopped fresh zucchini and a very large chopped red bell pepper to add in more color/vegetables. My whole family LOVED this dish--my littlest ate TWO helpings! This recipe is a keeper. NOTE: This rewarms well the next day.

My family really liked this recipe. I omitted the onion due to dietary restrictions and thought it tasted fine without it. If I put the carrots in it next time I will precook them some...they turned out not cooked at all.  I did layer as the the recipe recommended with the exception of putting the meat sauce layer 2nd. next time I think I will just mix a lot of it together. It does make too much for my family of 3 even after 3 days of leftovers there is still a lot left. The next time I make this I think I will halve the recipe. All and all not a bad dish.

This is a good recipe (if you like ground turkey) but I have one cynical complaint. I would consider fresh red meat, i.e. ground beef, healthier than processed foods like spaghetti sauce in a jar. I guess every bit helps to make food healthier and money and time are a factor. It's expensive to buy/make non-processed sauce and ground turkey is usually the cheapest ground meat. I prefer Italian sausage and I use jarred sauce. Just being cynical and complaining about what would be healthier. Sorry.

My family truly loved this (I didn't even think it was that great but was very pleased everyone else did)...my picky 5-yo even said "mom...you know how to make just what I like" I think I may have shed a happy tear.  I used all Colby cheese shredded and mixed all the layers together.

Great recipe!  I used rigatoni past instead of ziti.  Also, I forgot to buy the provolone cheese so I just used the cheeses I had on hand, which were mozzarella and Parmesan (I used a whole 8-oz bag of mozzarella and about half of an 8-oz bag of Parmesan) and it was fabulous!  I also omitted the carrots.  I loved how the sour cream tasted after it was baked.  I will definitely make this dish again.

Excellent.  I added some bell pepper and garlic to the turkey and onion mixture. The next time I make this, I will shred the carrot.  In addition, I think I'll like it better if I mix the pasta and sauce mixture together, then layer  with the sour cream and cheeses.  When I make again, I'll use a deeper or bigger baking dish than called for, to hopefully avoid it bubbling over into the oven.  I also plan to experiment with some herbs, depending on the type of pasta sauce I use.  A Keeper!

Easy and tasty meal. I followed another's advice and grated the carrot.  I thought I had sour cream and sadly I didn't.  It was good without the sour cream and it will be creamier with it!  As others had done, I added mozzarella cheese on the top with the parmesan.   Next time I might add some mild Italian sausage with the turkey. Very versatile meal that was enjoyed by my family.

I took another reviewers advise and used Italian turkey sausage. I also used various herbs and spices like oregano, basil etc. I will make it again.

I made the casserole just as described. It turned out great. The only change I will make is to add more sauce. The sauce get absorbed quite a bit. My family likes a lot of sauce with their pasta. or just have extra sauce on the side when it is served. Will definitely make again.

I tried this recipe based on reviews. I was so excited to try it but I have to say that no one in my family  liked it. Sadly I won’t be making this again.

My family *loved* this recipe! I cobbled together a few recommendations for my version - omitted the carrot, 1.5 jars of sauce (probably could have gotten away with just 1 jar), substituted non-fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and mixed the Greek yogurt with the pasta before layering. It was creamy and delicious and, with the yogurt substitute, veggie pasta, and a big sprinkle of ground flaxseed in the sauce, it felt downright healthy! This one be going into the rotation for sure.

I absolutely love this recipe!  It will be my go to for ziti for sure.  I did not make any changes other than to mix the sour cream with the ziti, as suggested by another reviewer.  This ziti is so creamy and does not dry out - leftovers are great!  One added bonus - My son-in-law is lactose intolerant and cannot usually eat these types of meals without paying the price but this version did not bother him at all!!!

we liked it, but I added lots of spices and still felt I should have added more.  I will make it again and follow everything except with a lot more ZING!

I made this with spare ingredients I had left toward the end of the week, day before shopping day. It turned out great! Boyfriend loved it and took leftovers over my brother's house the next day - his fiancee and him loved it, as well as their sister-in-law. Even left-overs are winners. I used whole wheat penne pasta and the cheese I had left in the house - Munster instead of provolone and taco mix instead of mozzarella and it turned out fantastic, would have never guessed it wasn't originally in the recipe.
