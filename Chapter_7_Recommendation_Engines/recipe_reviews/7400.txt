This is excellent.  I have made some adjustments to the recipe to make this low fat.  I replaced the cup of cake flour with a cup of whole wheat flour.  So, that makes 2 cups of whole wheat flour total.  Instead of the vegetable oil, I used one cup of non-sweetened apple sauce.  I have also reduced the 1/2 cup of white sugar to only 3 tbsp because the apple sauce is sweet naturally. I replaced 3 eggs with only the egg white, buttermilk with low fat milk.  I used 2 cups of carrots and added 1/2 tsp of cloves and nutmeg.

After reading some reviews that it was bland, I decided to add an additional 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.
After I finished baking it, it was still pretty bland.. I don't know what it's missing. But the texture is perfect; it's just the taste that is lacking a bit. I would have given it 3.5 stars, but I give it 4 stars since it was healthier.

BTW:
http://cake.allrecipes.com/az/69402.asp
is much better. It's also low fat, but the taste is phenomenal.

Wow!  I've never tried any baked goods with carrots in it, but this was great!  I had a bag of baby carrots that were starting to get dried up, and wanted to use them up.  I cut the sugar and made muffins instead of a cake.  I only had whole wheat flour on hand, but it was still soft and fluffy.  I also replaced all the fat with a couple heaping spoonfuls of applesauce.  I think whipping the egg whites really made a difference!  I used skim milk because I didn't have any buttermilk.  I sprinkled some shredded coconut, sugar, oats, and cinnamon on top of the muffins.  They're gorgeous, delicious, and super healthy!  I can't wait to try this recipe as written!

Yumm.. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly... It turned out great and was gone in no time. The second time, I substituted the oil with applesauce and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.. I wouldn't recommend that. The cake sank after I took it out from the oven, and did not have much of a taste. I still liked it, though.

If this is "light" then surely I will never make a "regular" carrot cake! I added a cream cheese frosting, and it was great! My husband, who usually gobbles everything down really fast, actually paused to appreciate and compliment the cake(then he gobbled it down). Next time I am going to make cupcakes.

This recipe is terrific, and you can reduce the oil a bit too--maybe by 1/6 c. I added an extra 1/2 t. of cinnamon (for 2 total). I also added 1/2 t. of each of these: allspice, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger. I made this into cupcakes, and they were a huge success. Excellent recipe!

Very moist for a "lite" cake...it does have significant decreases in fat/calories, though you could never tell by the taste.  I did add a bit more carrots because the 1 1/2 cups looked a little scant to me when I folded them in.  My DH liked it and my little assistant chef told me it was the BEST carrot cake ever (maybe because she helped!).  It was definitely done in 35 minutes.  Thanks for making one of our favorite desserts a little less fattening!  Thanks for sharing, Marva.

HOW TO MAKE THIS INTO A GOOD CAKE: Add 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp salt, and some walnuts and raisins. Make sure that you use as many cups of grated carrots as flour. No kidding, this is what the cake is lacking. Add these in and you'll have no problems with blandness. I made these into muffins and got 18.

lite and light!  very good recipe, it wasn't dense and wasn't overly sweet.  I cut back on brown sugar because i used splenda bs, I also used 2 packets of vanilla stevia instead of the 1/2 cup sugar and used regular milk and 2 cups carrots like others suggested.  I also added crushed walnuts and golden raisins (both soaked while making the recipe).    I didn't coat the pan before making this because I've always been told anytime you use stiff egg whites and add grease to the pan it flops.  I litterally just took it out of the oven 5 minutes ago and tried to let it sit for a few, but couldnt help taking a piece.. very delish and airy. A++

OH MY GOD. This was amazing. OK, let me share with you all what I did. I followed the ingredients exactly except: #1 I didn't have buttermilk, so I used skim milk, and #2, I added based on other reviews, 1/2 tsp of allspice, ground cloves, and nutmeg, and increased cinnamon to 2 tsps. All I can say is wow. I also made an alternative form of frosting because I didn't have cream cheese or powdered sugar:
1 c milk, 1/4 c flour stirring constantly over medium high heat as it thickens and boils, then add to creamed 1 c butter 1 c granulated sugar and 2 tsp vanilla. This was delicious!

I made this a little lighter by using 1/3 cup each of brown and white sugar and using half homemade apple butter in place of half the oil. Still came out plenty sweet and SUPER moist. This was a great way to make a weekend "treat" with my oldest boy and indulge without overindulging. When I make this again, I might use four egg whites and one full egg to make it even lighter and add a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract.

Very good, but I've lightened it even more.... no oil, no buttermilk. I use 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead. For the frosting, I use a light or fat free cream cheese. My family knows that I do these little tweeks and my aunts are always impressed that they can't taste the difference.

Very good with the following changes: used 2 cups carrots, plain non fat yogurt instead of buttermilk, added 1/2 tsp each nutmeg, ginger, and allspice. It tasted just like the fat loaded traditional carrot cake to me.

This was not bad. I followed the recipe to the letter save for baking as cupcakes, therefore reducing baking time. Definitely 'lite' in texture, not dense and moist like carrot cake typically is. I actually think I would try using apple sauce instead of the oil, not to reduce the fat more, but to give this a bit more moistness. Other than finding it a bit on the dry side, I enjoyed this for a 'lighter' version of carrot cake. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I made this cake last night for my son's 2nd bday. I used all-purpose flour instead of cake flour. I choose to add an xtra 1/2C of carrots as suggested.  I also added some more spices: 1/2t of nutmeg, allspice, ginger.  I also added 1 small pkg of raisins (I think it's 3oz) and 1C of chopped walnuts.  You would have never guessed that this cake was "lite".  I topped it off with the "allspice cream cheese frosting" but I used the neufatel cream cheese.  Try this one.  It's a keeper.

All I did to change this recipe was up the spices: 2 tsps cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ginger. Everything else I did exactly like the recipe stated (except that I used real cream cheese frosting). THIS CAKE IS DELICIOUS and I can't imagine why anyone would blow the fat and calories on a "real" carrot cake when this one is so wonderful. Thanks for such a great recipe, this is definitely a keeper!

I substituted the oil with applesauce and added just a dash of nutmeg.  Instead of icing I just topped with pecan pieces and baked them into a top crust and have got nothing but tremedous praise.  This cake ( I made them as muffins) is hands down outstanding and I will continue to make this for a long long time!

This carrot cake was very good. To the cook I am sorry but due to strict diet I had to tweek a little. I used 1 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 white flour. I also added a pinch of kosher salt and used 1 cup of splenda instead of sugar; everything else stayed the same. I give you 5 stars for this cake. Thanks for posting Marva!

I used apple sauce instead of oil, decreased white sugar, used yogurt instead of buttermilk, all purpose flour, only egg whites, added nutmeg and added a half cup of carrots. While I definitely feel this cake is not as good as a gourmet carrot cake, I still think it is a good little snack, especially with cream cheese icing. It turned out very dense and didn't rise much at all. Overall, I have come to the conclusion that for a low fat and low sugar cake, this was just fine.

I made half a recipe, using whole wheat pastry flour and adding 1 Tablespoon of honey, to avoid dryness.  These turned out sooo satisfying!  I used 3/4 cup cane sugar instead of white and brown sugars.  I made them muffin style, and it was just what I was looking for.  They're awesome.

It looks like I may be in the minority here, but I did not care for this cake at all. I made it per recipe instructions & it just did not have enough flavor. I gave it 3 stars, instead of 2 because it IS a much healthier version of carrot cake. However, I don't think I will attempt it again. Texture is dense, which I like... but it was too dry and bland as some other reviewers have noted.

This recipe made into great cupcakes.  I am not a fan of chunks of carrot so I chopped them almost into a puree.  It (they) were delicious.  I formed the carrot out of a candy chew and the stem is a candy coated sunflower seed.  FUN!

Excellent recipe, even with changes. The whipped egg white/sugar mixture is the KEY component so we did not change that, except to add the egg white LAST for maximum volume. We used date sugar instead of brown and lowered the amount to 3/4 cup. We made it GLUTEN FREE with gluten-free flour and 1 tsp xanthan gum. I also used one cup of drained canned pineapple and 1/2 cup pineapple juice. Oh, and 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla and some coconut too! I know it's not exactly the original recipe, but the general idea and the egg white method deserve all five stars! Thanks, Marva!

This was a great recipe!  Following other people's suggestions, I used 2 full teaspoons of cinnamon.  I also used 2 c whole wheat flour, instead of using cake flour, and I used skim lactose free milk instead of buttermilk - and it still turned out great!  It's not sweet and cake-y, but I don't like when carrot cake is really sweet.  I ate it without even frosting it.  Thanks for posting!

Delicious! I did follow some of the  substitutions, and used only eggwhites, swapped the oil for sugarfree applesauce and I used whole grain flour. I made cupcakes and before even frosting them, my husband and toddler were gobbling them down! They are really delicious and will definitely be made again!

Great recipe! The cake came out absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, though i didn't have enough wheat flour left so i just used 2 cups of regular flour, and it was fine.

I am fourteen years old and this was my first time ever making a cake from scratch. I made it when I made dinner for my family. They absolutely loved it! At first, I was a bit apprehensive, because some low-fat products aren't very good. But this was wonderful! I must admit my favorite part was when I told them that it was a low-fat cake after they had finished eating it. They were shocked! It tasted even better the second day. It was still wonderfully moist. My sister also put it in the freezer. It was sinful! I frosted it with Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting (found on this website) using Neufchatel Cream Cheese. It was so delicious and everyone loved it!!! P.S. I also added a SMALL amount of finely chopped pecans, approximately 1/2 cup or so. It would of been fine without them, though.

This is a delicious, moist recipe! To make it even better, I added a little bit each of cloves, nutmeg, ginger, raisins, vanilla, walnuts, and flax. I also swapped the buttermilk for skim milk and the oil for applesauce. This is a great healthy dessert.

I found the cake to be pretty bland. Perhaps adding some nutmeg or clove might have made the flavor better. I also thought it was a little dense - not quite as fluffy as it should have been. I did use all-purpose flour instead of cake flour howver and I'm sure this had something to do with it.

It wasn't bad, I will just probably find a recipe that has a little more OOMPH in the flavor department next time!

It came out perfectly moist and light in 30 mins. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 2% instead. I tried white whole wheat flour which I have read is milder than whole wheat and just as nutritious. I still have to experiment and see the difference. I also added 1/2 tsp each of nutmeg, ginger and cloves after reading the reviews. And of course, some raisins (my husband loves them in anything). Served it with tea and my girlfriends loved it.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious this recipe was! Very moist and satisfies the sweet tooth, while being just a little bit healthy. :] Tip: using whole wheat pastry flour in baked goods eliminates the heavier texture of whole wheat and keeps all the benefits. Also, for those wanting to use all whole wheat flour in this recipe, just know that whole wheat does have more calories and fat than refined flour, but it also has more nutrients.

this was delicious! I also made a few adjustments to make it even healthier... I used 2c of whole wheat flour and omitted the cake flour, 1c of unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, 2c of carrot, and 2tsp of cinnamon and added a 1/2tsp of nutmeg. It came not moist and delicious! Next time I will cut down on both sugars as it is quite sweet with the applesauce. Great with or without cream cheese icing!

AMAZING! A great alternative to the recipe i used to do which require over a cup of oil. This is just light and fluffy and the taste is just as good! I used skimmed buttermilk and it took 45 mins to bake well.  A definte keeper!!

Good flavor for far less calories. I then did use real cream cheese frosting. The only thing I missed was that it is very light and fluffy and I like a dense carrot cake.

soooo good! I was looking for a satisfying breakfast bread/cake to have with my coffee and this will be perfect! I cut down on the sugar, only using 1/2 cup brown sugar and it still came out plenty sweet.  I also added 1/2 tsp each of nutmeg, cloves, ginger, salt, and 1 tsp vanilla which helped with the blandness. Definitely will bake this cake again! :)))

I halved the recipe and baked it in a 8*8 pan, for 25 minutes. Yummy recipe and feels good to know that it's not as fattening as original carrot cake recipes. I added 1/8 tsp salt and about 1/2 cup of chopped nuts because I read in other reviews, that it was a little bland. I think the additions may have added what others may have been missing. Yummy!!

I really don't like when people give recipes 5 stars & then change everything about that recipe in their review!  I'm giving this a 3 star rating based on making with no changes...I thought the consistency was a little weird, bu the the taste was okay.  I'll give it the kid test, but I didn't think it was all that great.

WONDERFUL!  I opted to make these into muffins instead of cake and they turned out fabulous - moist and full of flavour!  Like some others, I made a few changes: used 2 cups carrots, cut down brown sugar to 3/4 c, white sugar to 1/4 cup, 2tsp cin, 1/2 tsp each nutmeg and allspice, used only 1 yolk with 3 whites and used a full cup of unsweetened applesauce wtih 1 tbsp of oil.  Fantastic with these changes, although I'm sure this recipe is great as written, I just like to reduce some fat and calories where possible.  I found these plenty sweet despite my reductions in both sugars, likely due to the applesauce!  Will make again for sure, my 3 and 5 year old devoured one each not long after they came out of the muffin pans (which, to note, I only got 17 muffins, not too big, nicely sized).

Great recipe!  For high altitude bakers, I reduced the baking soda and baking powder both to 3/4 teaspoons.  Using a zester grater to shred the carrots makes the cake nice and smooth.  I added raisins and actually used a bunch of carrots and the result was a wonderfully moist cake.  Yum!

Nice and light.  This recipe has become my standard carrot cake recipe. It's not as oily as most carrot cakes so it can handle a good amount of cream cheese frosting without being too rich!

I thought this was a great carrot cake! I made a few adjustments to the original, I used all purpose flour and whole wheat flour, and I added 1/2 teaspoon each of  ginger, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves. Also I upped the carrots to 2 cups and used applesauce instead of oil. Next time I think that I will add just a little bit more applesauce to increase the moisture, maybe a 1/2 cup instead of 1/3. All in all pretty good. Tasted great with fat free whipped topping!

Absolutely FANTASTIC!!!  I can't say enough about this cake!.  Moist and flavorful without that heavy oily texture.  I used the 1 cup of wheat flour and 1 cup of all purpose flour.  As another reader suggested, I added a bit more shredded carrots (used 2 cups).  Also, I probably added about an 1/8 cup more of the buttermilk because I wanted to make sure the cake would be moist.  Next time I make this, I might add even a bit more carrot.  Oh, I also added about 3/4 cup finely chopped walnuts which rounded out the flavor!  I cheated and frosted it with a canned cream cheese frosting due to timing.  I have thrown out my old Carrot cake recipe and replaced it with this one.  I'll NEVER make another carrot cake... this one is it, for life!!

After the amount of work going into this cake (lets face it, most carrot cakes don't require stiff peaked egg whites), I wasn't sure I was going to keep it.  And then I took a bite.  It is not as good as full fat carrot cake.  It is so much better.  I have since tweaked the recipe for my own tastes, but I feel that is imperative with any recipe.  For a great, non greasy, basic carrot cake recipe, this is the one I will go to every time from now on.

This is the first carrot cake recipe I've tried and I love it!  I eat mostly healthy foods but my weakness is cake.  So, needless to say, I'm a very experienced cake taster!  I can tell this one is lower fat than what you would get at a bakery or restaurant, however, it has wonderful flavor and is very moist.  My family couldn't even tell it was healthier.  It satisfies my cake craving and I will definitely make again!

I thought this was really bland. Luckily I used the cake for cake balls and was able to remedy the problem with the addition of some nutmeg and ground cloves into the frosting cake crumble mix. I appreciate that this healthier than the original, but it is lacking in flavor.

Delicious for a light cake. It wasn't as rich as carrot cake normally is. Much lighter, but still had the right taste.

The taste was excellent (I added 1/2 tsp extra cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg), however the batter was awkward to mix. Also, I baked the cake for 30 minutes but it turned out slightly drier than I would have liked.

I was looking for a carrot cake that didn't have so much oil, and I didn't have any pineapple in the cupboard, so this recipe was perfect.  It turned out light and delicious!  One of my best carrot cakes ever.

I was challenged to bring a "sweet" for Mother's day brunch and came upon this recipe. I used all purpose flour and added about a half teaspoon of lemon peel to compliment the lemon juice I planned on using in the frosting and it turned out great! Super moist and flavorful!

A nice light cake! My co workers enjoyed a piece and some had seconds! One commented that it was nice--and not too sweet. The egg white portion almost created a marbled effect when folded in to the batter.

Not as 'lite' as I would have preferred, so I altered the recipe.  Firstly, I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 3 egg whites (as specified) and only one egg yolk.  I also only used 3 tbsp white sugar and one cup of apple sauce.  I also used skim milk instead of buttermilk, and 2 cups of grated carrots.  And I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg. mmm!

This recipe is tasty for being lite. I didn't have any cake flour so I just used 2 cups AP flour instead. Also traded the oil for 1 cup unsweetened applesauce. Used more carrots. Maybe too many, because it's very "carroty" tasting. I'm going to add some cream cheese frosting to see if it helps. But over all very tasty. Oh, and I did add some rasins and I was a great touch!!

The reason this cake is called "bland" in so many reviews is that it is lacking salt, which is very important to the development of flavor in baked goods. Check your favorite cake recipes with this same amount of flour and you'll find that most of them require anywhere from 1/2 tsp to 1 1/2 tsp of salt. I used 1 tsp when I made the cake, but would increase it to 1 1/2 next time.

Not bad for a lighter carrot cake! It's really fluffy and moist, I just regret it's a bit bland. Use a good frosting to make up for it! (I followed someone else's advice and used orange cream cheese frosting from this site: excellent idea).

This was very good, and moist.  I went with other reviewers and used 2 cups of carrots instead of 1-1/2, applesauce in place of the oil, and adding 1/2 tsp. ginger, cloves, nutmeg and allspice.  I used the cake flour and whole wheat flour as in the recipe and it came a great.  I baked it in two - 8" square pans.  Came out nice and thick and very moist.  I didn't have frosting, but it tasted great without!  I shipped a few squares to my father for Thanksgiving, so I'm hoping they'll make it there in one piece!  Thanks for a great, healthy recipe!!

Mmmm!  This was delicious.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon of ginger, cloves, nutmeg and allspice and used 2 cups of carrots.  I also added 1/2 cup of walmuts.  I used the allspice cream cheese frosting on this site and it was MOUTHWATERING good.  One suggestion- using a 9x13 pan was too thin.  I would use a smaller pan, but other than that this recipe was great.  5 stars!

This is great!  I did not miss the added fat at all. The texture is perfectly moist, with just enough sweetness. I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I subbed with skim milk, otherwise I followed the recipe exact. This one is a keeper.

great cake! I added a pinch of ground cloves, a pinch of nutmeg and a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter. I used 1 cup unbleached. Flour instead of cake flour. Iced with low fat cream cheese recipe from  skinnytaste blog.

I will NEVER make the traditional recipe carrot cake again - not when this version is so yummy.

Great recipe. This was the first time that I made carrot cake, and it turned out fabulously! I did change a few things- I used only brown sugar, and whole wheat flour, and I replaced buttermilk with almond milk. I also added cranberries and pumpkin seeds. I will definitly make this recipe again, though I will probably add a bit more grated carrot next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a fabulous cake and even better that it is lite! I followed the recipe exactly.  I would add more spice next time. Otherwise, perfect texture. I added the fat back by using Cream Cheese Frosting II which was great with it.

Moist, delicious, perfect. I used fresh ground whole wheat flour so I had to add an extra 1/4 cup of butter milk to make the batter and little more cakie. It turned out so wonderful I would for sure use this recipe for anytime I want to make carrot cake.

Incredible! I used regular white flour instead of cake flour. This cake is really moist even though there is so little oil in it. My husband loves it without any icing. Thanks for this wonderful, more healthy version of a classic dessert/

Yum!  It was slightly undercooked at 30 minutes, but still yum.  Used regular flour since I couldn't find the fancy stuff.  Also added more cinnamon (1/2 tsp), nutmeg (tsp), and ginger (tsp).  Oh, and I used 3 large carrots -- way more than 1.5 cups.  It went really fast at work!

This was as good as I expected a healthier version of Carrot Cake to be.  My husband and I enjoyed it with some homemade almond agave nectar low fat cream cheese.  My only negative comment is that it was really dry, and spreading the cream cheese on it caused it to fall apart easily. However, the flavor was good and we appreciated that it was a healthy alternative.  It lasted quite a long time in the refrigerator, over a week.

This cake turned out amazing!!!!! very moist and delicious indeed. i cut the recipe in half, used two and a half tablespoons oil with one cup carrots, i added vanilla to two egg whites and i used one yolk, a dash of nutmeg and doubled on the cinnamon plus i only used whole wheat flour but next time ill even reduce the brown sugar coz i can handle less sugary desserts but overall ITS A KEEPER.

This was good but a little dense and heavy, but definitely a good alternative to super fattening carrot cake.  I did as others suggested used 1 cup of applesauce, 2 tbl of oil and 2 cups of carrots.  I also added about a cup of walnuts and a can of drained crushed pineapple.  Will be making this again whan I'm in the mood for carrot cake.

The best - very moist and so light in texture, not to mention so tasty!! I added extra shredded carrots, substituted Splenda in place of all sugar, used whole wheat flour, and added apple sauce in place of the oil. Incredible. This will be a staple!!

I replaced the oil with applesauce and added a tbsp of oil (Enova) as another reviewer suggested.  I also subbed plain yogurt for the buttermilk, added more carrot and raisins I had soaked in hot water, and added a tbsp of vanilla.  The result was moist, delicious, and sweet enough that we skipped the frosting.

Delicious!  I made a couple of substitutions: (1) all-purpose flour for whole wheat because, honestly, I don't like whole wheat anything; and (2) 1/3 cup applesauce + 1 Tbsp oil for the fat in order to reduce the fat even more.  I also added a little more cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg.  The cake was so fluffy, tender, and flavorful.  I will definitely make this again!

It's good. Very light. I reduced brown sugar to 1/2 cup because I don't like things that are too sweet. And I modified the recipe according to other reviewers. I'll definitely make it again.

I was pleasantly surprised and yet a tad disappointed in this recipe... I made exactly as written and this tasted really good (batter was awesome!), but it did have a slightly spongier consistency than regular cake (but that's to be expected) and the flavor was not as full as I would have liked after baking.  And I think that next time I will definitely add more shredded carrot or a little yogurt for extra moisture and some more spices to intensify the flavors a little bit.  That said, I made this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loved it and didn't offer up any criticism at all!  It also may have had something to do with the awesome cream cheese frosting on top (Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site with 1 tsp. or so of allspice mixed in and dash more vanilla).  All in all, this is a quality recipe!  I recommend making as is and then tweaking to your own personal liking!

Excellent recipe!  Totally delicious with great flavor and sweetness, and is straightforward to make.  It is very moist and dense.  I added 3/4 cup raisins and made it in 2- 9 inch cake pans.  I used one of the cream cheese icing recipes with 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice mixed in and it was HEAVENLY!  Just make sure you like a more dense cake if you are making this.

This turned out so good, my brother-in-law and step-dad both loved it. They are the pickiest meat n' potatoes kind of eaters. To make it more "whole grain," I did 1 1/2 cups ww flour and 1/2 cup cake flour. I only used 2 eggs because that's all I had. I did use all sugar called for subbing evaporated cane juice for the 1/2 cup sugar (got it at Whole Foods in the bulk bins). I spiced it up like the other reviewers with 2 tsp. cinn, 1 tsp. nutmeg, and 1 tsp crystalized ginger. Also, I ran out of buttermilk, so I added plain yogurt to regular milk to make up the difference. Then I noticed the batter looked a little thick (probably due to having more ww flour) so I added an additional 1/4 cup milk.

It was my first time making carrot cake and it was great! It was very moist.  I did add more carrots (2 cups, most reviewers suggested it).  I would also add less sugar, it's on the sweet side (probably eliminate the sugar in the eggwhites).  Since I was only making it for two people, I made a 5 inch round cake pan and four mini loaves to give away.  It took about 30 - 35 minutes.  Also used the Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting on this site, but it's great without frosting too!

This recipe was absolutely de'lite'ful!  I went by the recipe exactly, except I don't have an electric mixer, so I beat the egg whites by hand with a whisk, and they never got "stiff", but they did get a lot thicker, so I used that and the cake came out just fine I think.  I couldn't imagine it any better.  This was my first cake made from scratch and everyone loved it.  Thanks!!

Delicious, light and fluffy. Rises to about an inch in 9x13 so I'll make 1.5 batch next time with a little more carrot.

this is the first cake in my life that i ever made from scratch. i was so pround of myself when i was done! the cake was so yummy!!! well, i shoud say cupcakes. the recipe makes 24 cupcaeks. i give the recipe four stars instead of five becuase (1) i like denser carrot cakes (2) i like sweeter carrot cakes. so when i make this again (and i will definitely make it again), i'll one less egg white and add more brown sugar? i don't know how much that will change the recipe. if you happen to know or have suggestions, pls let me know, oh! and don't forget how INCREDIBLY MOIST this cake was!!! delicious!! yummy.

This was fabulous. I did use 2 cups of shredded carrot because I had a 1/2 cup extra and didn't have the heart to chuck it out.  Next time I am definitely going to add walnuts and raisins because I love those but it's def not needed!  Definitely a keeper!

FYI, 131 cals is for just the cake. Add cals for the frosting. I used 2 c all-purpose flour. I'd like to try this again with whole eggs no beat-eggs-fold-in elaboration. Perfect for me!

I stuck to the recipe completely but I never even have vegetable oil in my house, I bake with coconut oil and added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice the second time and it made the flavor more intense and fragrant! Will be making again with that small change!

Excellent carrot cake.  I used greek yogurt instead of buttermilk  and all purpose flour and it work perfectly.  It is light and moist and doesn't have that oily texture that you get with most carrot cakes.  You can spice it up to your own taste. This is the one I will make from now on. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

It was what I expected from a lite cake, not moist like I like carrot cake. I added more cinnamon, nutmeg, and all spice b/c it seemed like a bland recipe.

I had some carrots I needed to use, so I decided to try this recipe.  I halved the recipe and made muffins (got 9, probably could've stretched it and gotten 10).  I did not have buttermilk so I added a splash of vinegar to regular milk.  Also, I didn't have cake flour, so I just used all purpose flour (sifted).  Even though I halved the recipe, I used a generous 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  I think the muffins would've been too bland using the amount called for.  These turned out well, but I would like to try this again with cake flour to see if the texture is improved.

Thanks for healthy  recipe. I am looking for less butter/oil/sugar recipe. This is great.  I reduced sugar at about 25%, added 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence and 150g almond into it.  No frosting as I like lite cake.

i would have given this 3 stars but for 2 reasons; 1, i made many suggested changes to make it healthier (all whole wheat flour, applesauce for oil, less sugar) since it was my son's first birthday cake. 2, although i did not care for it, he loved it, and over the next week ate the whole thing. it was not remotely fluffy but was very moist and held up well in the fridge. i'd make it again but only for his sake.

Very good! I slimmed them down as much as possible and my 5 year old still wanted the whole batch! Nice way to sneak in veggies... ;)

I used a 6 unit muffin pan for these instead of the cake pan and substituted buttermilk for 2% milk, used whole wheat flour instead of regular flour. Used egg whites instead of eggs and splenda instead of sugar, and they came out very well. Moist and flavorful.

We liked the fact that we could do muffins, and had them with breakfast as an alternative to toast a couple mornings with fruit and yogurt. We were going to ice them, then decided to leave them more healthy. Yummy~!

We really liked this cake - I did frost it with cream cheese frosting but it would have been great without - or made into muffins.  I used apple sauce instead of oil and cut the receipe in half but should have used 2 eggs instead of just 1.  Will make again for sure.

These were very yummy. I used whole wheat flour and applesauce instead of oil. More like muffins than cake with the whole wheat, but perfect for easter breakfast:)

Yummy!  Added a few spices and a bit less sugar.  Even my VERY picky fiance ate it up and asked me to make it again soon.  He usually won't touch the healthier treats that I make.

Delicious.  Next time, I'd add slightly more cinnamon, but otherwise a big hit!  I baked with a bit less sugar and they still turned out perfectly!

I just made this cake for the second time last night and it's as good as I remember it!  I am by no means a carrot cake fan but this one I love!  My children just recently had an opportunity to eat store bought carrot cake (covered in loads of frosting) and they took one bite of that and ran away screaming!  I had to convince them to try this cake and when they did they loved loved loved it!

I couldn't believe it was a light and moist cake.  I put it in a 8 x 11 pan It didn't raise like I thought it would, but tasted great.  I think I may add more 1/2 tsp more baking soda next time. I used the allspice cream cheese frosting. This is a keeper

Okay... this is only getting 3 stars from me, but I'm pretty sure it's my fault. I really altered this recipe, and I pretty much botched it. I used all white flour. I used 2 cups of carrots and I used apple sauce instead of the oil, and then ended up adding 2 tbsp. oil. Also added a dash of nutmeg. The result? Gummy muffins that takes you an hour to get through. So, I'm sure this is probably a terrific recipe if you don't mess with it. Guess it just proves that you really shouldn't mess with a good thing.

Very good.  I made this as cupcakes for my son's first birthday.  To make it a little healthier, I used all applesauce in place of the oil.  I wish I had added a few more spices, but it really was tasty and my son loved them!  Oh, I used 2 cups of carrots....gotta sneak those veggies in there!  I used the allspice cream cheese frosting from this site....yummy!

Great recipe.  I won 2nd place in a dessert contest with this, so thank you!
I subsituted the white sugar with Splenda, simply because I had it around and figured I why not use it on an already 'lite' recipe.  Put in a bit more baking powder and a teaspoon of vanilla.  I kept with the 1 1/2 cups of carrots, and thought it was great, but I could still see adding more.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I might add nutmeg to see what happens.

Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

the cake was not bad, but it was lacking the much needed taste of carrots! try 2 full cups of carrots, and more spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger etc.also, try apple sauce instead of the oil for more moisture.

My guests all pronounced this cake "delicious" and my family gobbled up the leftovers.  This is definitely not as heavy as other recipes but it was still moist and had a nice flavor.  My only changes were to use all cake flour as I did not have whole wheat on hand.  I also added a little vanilla.  Next time I may try applesauce instead of oil to bring the fat content down a little more.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good carrot cake. I have never made a carrot cake before and this recipe was simple and very tasty. I substituted all purpose flour for the cake flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Iced with store bought cream cheese icing. The cake was very moist but not heavy. My family proclaimed this recipe a a keeper.

I found I had to leave it in the oven for longer than 35 minutes.  I don't know why it took so long.  Anyway, I substituted all that with applesauce and 1 T. of oil  to make it even 'liter', although I wish I used brown sugar for the whole recipe instead of half with white.  I guess I wanted a more bread texture.  Even though I added 2 C. of carrots, it still didn't really have a carrot taste to me, but my sister enjoyed it.  Overall, satisfactory cake.

Excellent recipe.  My only complaint was that it wasn't quite a moist as most carrot cake but I guess that's the price you pay for a healthier version.  I made cupcakes for my son's first birthday using this recipe and topped them with cream cheese icing.  Bigger kids (including grandparents!) got to top them with jellybeans and mini-M&Ms and they were a big hit.

Delicious, turned out very moist.  I cut back on both the white and brown sugar and used all purpose flour and it turned out excellent.
I made 3 small mini loaves and baked for about 45 minutes.  Will definately make again and add raisins next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe!! I took this to a dinner party, and it got gobbled up. Everyone thought that it was going to be really heavy and fattening, but when I told them how few calories are in it, lots took a second helping. I made it again just a couple days later for my boyfriend's office! I used the all purpose flour hint and added some pecans. Perfect!

Excellent recipe! I made it last night and brought it in today for a coworker's birthday, and everyone loves it.  Hard to believe it's low-fat. I added about 1/2 cup of pecans to the recipe, as well as a dash of nutmeg and cloves. I frosted it with the allspice (used cinnamon instead of allspice) cream cheese frosting recipe found on this site (using 2-8 ounce blocks of Neufchatel cream cheese). Great flavor!

I did not make this with exactly the same ingredients.  I skipped the coconut and only used 1/4 cup of oil.  And I substituted milk for buttermilk.   It is good.   I think would be better made as intended.  But either way it’s a low cal dessert my version 324 calories for 1/12th cake.

It isn't as sweet as some of the others.  I made mini bites to help control my appetite.  Tastes great and very moist.

It turned out very well!! I used 1 cup all purpose flour minus 2 table spoons w/ 2 table spoons of corn starch to sort of put together cake flour. Also just bought some shredded carrots from kroger instead of grating some (I was lazy.) The consistency was very good, the only really unhealthy part for my cake was the cream cheese frosting that I coated it with.

Subbed coconut sugar for brown sugar and added allspice, nutmeg, cardamom and cloves (about a 1/4 teaspoon each). Upped carrots to 2 cups.  Was a huge hit with my whole family.

This is a really nice, light carrot cake.  I used homemade applesauce instead of the oil, bumped up the carrots some, and added orange zest.  I also chopped some dried cranberries which I soaked for a bit in the orange juice.  Drained the chopped, soaked cranberries and used the juice to sour some milk, in place of the buttermilk.   Good idea to whip the egg whites and fold into the batter.  I'll make this one again.

Love this! Nice and moist. I don't like overly sweet things so I topped it with a cream cheese frosting with less sugar. Just what I was looking for.

Tasty and moist. Baked as muffins and a small loaf.  Made with 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup buttermilk (vs. 1/3 and 2/3) to further reduce the fat. Added 1/4 tsp salt. It was a bit too sweet for our tastes with the white and brown sugar amounts as written, so next time I will try it with brown sugar reduced to 3/4 cup (instead of 1 cup).  Carrot cake tip: instead of grating peeled carrots, put peeled carrots in the blender or food processor and chop into small pieces.

This carrot cake was delicious.  I love the nice crust this cake forms when it comes out of the oven.  I baked it in a 10 inch spring form pan and increased the baking time.  Next time, I think I will bake it in a 9 inch pan so I would get a nice high cake.  I added some grated zucchini along with the carrots to make 2 cups.  Also, throw in some chopped wulnuts and raisins.

I was pleasantly surprised with this cake.  I wasn't sure how it would turn out. I was worried it would be dry or lacking in flavor.  The only change I made was to increase the carrots to 2 cups.  I didn't frost it, but that was my mistake.  It does need some frosting to make it complete.

I made this to fufill my boyfriend's request for carrot cake for his birthday.  I used 2 cups of grated carrots as well as a jar of carrot baby food.  I also incorporated the spices other reviewers had suggested.  It was a great cake, but a little dry.  I let the to 9 inch rounds sit on the counter for a day before I iced them, and it may have contributed to the dryness.  A great alternative to high fat carrot cake.

Taste too good to be low cal/fat.  Doesn't really need any frosting.  Fluffy and moist at the same time.  This was my first carrot cake and I'm very pleased with the recipe.  I will definitely make it again.  Thank you Marva.

I made this for my husband's birthday because carrot cake is his favorite.  He said it was great, even better than his sister's, who is the queen of baking! I used the allspice cream cheese frosting from this site.. Will definitely be making again.

A delicious light recipe. The cake was very moist and not nearly as "heavy" as regular carrot cake. I will definitely make again. Thank you!

Excellent! This was my first ever carrot cake and everyone at work loved it! I also made a few alterations such as 2 cups of grated carrots and the extra spices. Will make this again many times! Thanks.

This cake was excellent.  My step-father loves high fat carrot cakes - He couldn't believe this was lite.  He keeps asking me to make it again.  The only change I made was useing 2 cups of carrots.
