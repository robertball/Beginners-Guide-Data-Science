This was great!  Makes 6 servings??? Maybe if you're eating them as a snack, but it goes a LONG ways as salad croutons.  I found it easier to make 1/2 batch at a time, and to first put the bread cubes in a large bowl and pour the oil (I substituted 1/4 cup olive oil & 1/4 cup melted margarine) over the cubes and then add the seasoning and mix well, before placing them on the baking pan.  Will definately add this to my list of favorites!

These are great. I used Olive Oil and parmesan cheese and my husband and I ate them like there was no tomorrow. I have also added a tablespoon of butter to the olive oil, added the basil and chopped garlic and simmered on low heat for about 10 minutes to really get the flavors infused. We loved it! We will never buy store croutons again unless we absolutely have to.

Yummy is definitely the word to describe these! I'll NEVER ever go back to store bought again!  I had a loaf of Italian bread that was going stale and this recipe was perfect for it.  I used EVOO instead of veg. oil and tossed them instead of just drizzling the mixture over top.  I baked them at 375 instead of 400 and watched them carefully so they didn't burn. I turned them during cooking. So good, I made a second batch and experimented with using a packet of Good Seasons Italian Salad dressing mix plus some minced garlic along with the olive oil.  I think you can mix up just about any combination of herbs, spices, and add in some grated cheese and it'll turn out great! A perfect add-in to salads, soups, casseroles - whatever you can think of...

Yummy croutons for snacking, for salads and for recipes that call for bread crumb toppings. Just pulse in the food processor and you have instant seasoned bread crumb. I put all the ingredients in a plastic bag and shake. Substitute half garlic-flavored olive oil and half melted butter for the vegetable oil.Thanks Laura.

I used olive oil and regular white bread.  I also baked at a lower temperature, as I've heard these can burn easily.  Quite tasty and I plan to make again.

I used melted butter instead of vegetable oil and used thinly sliced baguettes instead to make little toasts for a spinach and artichoke dip.  I didn't measure the garlic powder and basil but rather just sprinkled a little bit over each piece.  I also sprinkled a bit of paprika on the center of each piece, which looked BEAUTIFUL!!  These MADE the dip, as it was a bit plain with regular bread.  I will definitley make these again

WOW! While waiting on my husband and son to come home, my daughter and I made these and they are GREAT! We are eating them like candy....next time I am going to try a little parmesan cheese! I will never buy croutons in the store again...they are way too expensive and this is a wonderful way to use leftover bread....no waste! THANKS!

Really good. I sprinkle with parmesan cheese also. They never make it to the salad because everyone snacks on them.

Yummy!!! I used garlic salt instead of powder and mixed the bread cubes in a bowl with the oil and spices. Cooked at 350 degrees for 15 mins shaking halfway through. Made these for a Caesar Salad to go with Pasta De Sardine (also from this site).

These croutons where Great! Nice change from store bought. And nice way to use up day old french bread you forgot about. I've made these several times. My two young sons love to eat as a snack. Follow the directions and watch your timing. If you forget they will burn and not taste so good.  Thanks for the recipe Laura!

Yummy!  I used olive oil, and regular sliced white bread.  I also added cracked pepper and oregeno.  I won't be buying store bought croutons again.  I had to make more because I had eaten all of them by the time it time to eat the salad!

Very good flavor!  I'm not a huge fan of basil so I used only 1 TB instead of 2.  This recipe's a keeper!

Easy to make and tastes great!  I also sprayed with butter flavored cooking spray to give a buttery taste.  Also great as a snack.

LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. this recipe. Like others I personalized it by also adding cracked pepper, dried onion, and parmesan cheese. I used a loaf of French bread that I bought on the day old cart. The first attempt I screwed up by adding the seasonings to the oil. Big mistake. Then I mixed all my seasonings and put them in an empty spice bottle (with the holes in top) - then just sprinkled it over the oiled croutons! I baked at 400º. Watch the oven though because they cook fast.

I cut this recipe in half and used half of a italian baguette I bought the day before off the discount bread rack at my local store. This was very easy to make and added a little something to our dinner's salad. This is a nice base recipe to take and run with by adding whichever spices you'd like to your oil before brushing it onto the bread. This would also make a good base for homemade breadcrumbs.

Not knowing what to expect from this recipe, I was very pleased.  Though the croutons had an excellent flavor, as other reviewers have suggested--a little salt would probably be beneficial.  Next time I make these, I will add a little salt.  We used these to top our mixed salad with homemade blue cheese dressing.  Good with or without salad!

Very good Laura! I used olive oil with the addition of parm cheese. Much healthier than the croutons I normally fry!! Went beautifully with our Cobb Salad. Thanks so much.

I didn't have any croutons for a chefs salad & found this recipe.  Well I wasn't too sure about how they would taste, but they came out great. My granddaughters come over & eat them as a snack, so I have to keep making more.  I would rather take the time to make these than buy the ones in the grocery store.

I really liked these croutons. I just wanted to say that after making many different versions of croutons in the past, one day I grabbed a pizza cutter and it worked so great to cut the bread in a more uniform fashion.

These are definitely easy and good, but not great.  Anyhow, served these over a caesar salad and it made a nice meal with the chicken and rice combo.

These croutons were phenominal.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they were good but needed something.  The second time I had the same amount of garlic, half the basil and I added 1 Tbsp of dried parsely, 1/4 tsp ground black pepper, and 1/2 tsp paprika.  I also used melted butter, which another viewer suggested, and it turned out great.  These changes made it even better.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great basic recipe. I've made all kinds of croutons by mixing things up slightly - all turning out great. I've added a bit of Mrs. Dash's Garlic and Herb seasoning which was wonderful. Have also sliced my bread really thinly to make almost a chip type of crouton.  To really make them good and fattening, I've added tiny pieces of bacon to my oil/herb/bread mixture. Tastes great on a salad!  Thanks for the recipe! I've actually got some bread to use for croutons tonight!

I didn't have french bread, but I did have a couple thick slices of leftover bread, so I used those instead.  I mixed the oil by hand in the bowl, then added the seasonings and mixed again.  Worked perfectly, and the baking times were perfect too.  Thanks for the recipe--very easy and a good way to use up bread I otherwise probably would've wasted.  Thanks.

I sprinkled a bit of garlic salt and black pepper over the top of the croutons.  I left them in for twelve minutes because at 10, they weren't brown enough for my tastes.  They came out nice and crispy and very flavorful!

Great!! These were so easy! I used olive oil and sweet basil. Because I drizzled, I probably ended up using a cup instead of a 1/2. Next time I'll mix it all in a large bowl first, then put on baking sheet.

Decent basic recipe.  I used two-day-old homemade french bread.  Instead of drizzling and sprinkling, I put the oil and herbs in a gallon-size zip-top bag and shook the bread crumbs until they were decently coated.  I will add salt next time and use less oil.

These were very yummy, but I was uncomfortable using that much olive oil. I did it, but I would use less next time, just to cut the calories. Toasted seasoned bread cubes don't really require a ton of oil or butter on them to make them delicious!

Very good. I mixed the garlic powder and basil in with the vegetable oil. I also added a little bit of butter to the mixture. I drizzled the whole thing over the top of the bread cubes.

I've been making these for 20 yrs.  I don't bake mine, I fry them after tossing them with EVOO, garlic pepper and parmesan cheese.  I use them on salads, soups and to top mac n cheese casserole.  Most of, they are a delicious snack.  Made with brioche they are to die for.

Very good crouton recipe.  I used italian rolls which I first froze to make it easier to cut.  With the addition of onion powder and a little salt this is a 5 star recipe.

I think this recipe has potential, but the basil was too strong for me.  I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil and baked it much longer than 5-10 minutes.  I have another crouton recipe that bakes at 300 degrees for 45 minutes, which I think works better.  Next time I would leave out the basil and try a different type of seasoning.

Fabulous! I love this recipe with an all-consuming passion. :) I've made it several times in the past few weeks (but not this week, my oven's dead!), and I've only used French bread once. I've used white bread, whole wheat bread, some tasty whole-multi-grain bread.. It always turns out well. I usually use ½ margarine to ½ oil (I tend to cut the recipe down to half) and sometimes I use all butter and no oil. I cut the basil amount in half because I'm not THAT keen on basil, and I add a little salt. I bake it at 375 because I've had burnt croutons at 400. Periodically, I flip them around and rub them around on the cookie sheet while baking so they brown evenly and get all coated with the mixture. Very good to snack on! Thanks, Laura!

Nice to have your own homemade croutons, much better than store bought and it gives you something to do with left over bread.  I'll never go back to store bought.

This one is perfect for the caesar salad supreme... The taste of the croutons added more flavor the salad. some changes that I made are: half/half extra virgin olive oil/butter...added Italian seasoning instead of basil...and extended cooking hours to 25 mins but with constant checking.

I made this using a rosemary olive oil bread and it was great with the basil and garlic.  I would also reccommend using 1/2 recipe unless, even for snacking these go a long way!

Am eating these right now and they are delicious!  Mixed them in a bowl, added some parmesan, and baked at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, shaking pan at 5 minutes. I doubt these will make it to a salad. So simple and so very, very good!

This is q great idea on what to do with leftover bread. If I make bread pudding with it again, I will gain ten lbs. Salad with croutons is much better!

Cut this recipe down to make about 1/4 of a loaf of bread.  I was using up some ciabatta bread.  It turned out delicious - only trouble was my daughter wouldn't stop eating them right out of the oven!

Flavor probably would have been great, but 400 degrees for 10 minutes burnt the heck out of my little croutons. Will try again at a much lower temp.

I never knew how easy these are to make. To heck with store-bought croutons! I'm hanging on to this recipe. I used sauerkraut rye bread from a recipe on this site, sprayed the cubes with olive oil, then sprinkled with garlic powder and garlic salt. I baked for 15 minutes and they came out perfectly golden and crunchy. I did leave out the basil since I didn't think it would go with my bread.

Soo good and easy! I almost tried another crouton recipe but this one had one less step and is delicious.  I added jalepeno powder that gave it an extra kick. Can't believe all these years I bought croutons, sounds silly to think how easy it is now.

Wow!  I just made this and it was yummy!  Can't wait to have it in my salad!  I did use EVOO instead of vegetable oil and added 1/2 tspn of garlic salt.  Nice flavor and nice crunchy texture (but not too crunchy because I only baked for 6 minutes). A definite keeper!

The best croutons EVER!  I used 1/4 cup of olive oil for 1 lb of garlic french bread and used less garlic powder.  These turned out more delicious than I expected and everyone loved them.

I used olive oil and tossed everything together in a bowl with a dash of salt before transferring to the cookie sheet.  Next time I'll experiment with the herbs.  Quick little recipe with great results!  I'll never buy store croutons again.  Thanks.

My DH made these croutons tonight for caesar salad and they were ok.  The only change he made was to add a little bit of salt....they were much better when they were warm, so I would serve them in a soup or something, but not cold.

This was an interesting new technique for me - I'd never cubed a loaf of French bread before, and it took a little while to do. My loaf was indeed a day old, but weighed an ounce or two more than the specified pound. But after it was all done, there were lots of crumbs on the cutting board and I probably had a pound of bread cubes after all.
Even still, I was surprised how the cubes took up the whole cookie sheet, and were all piled up 2- or 3-deep.
I ran out of garlic powder while making this, so I probably had 1.5-1.75 Tbsp. in my batch.
Otherwise, I made these exactly as specified. I probably should have cooked them for another minute or two, like another reviewer did, since I like my croutons very cruncy - these were a bit soft. I thought these were pretty good; The Woman I Love had some on a salad and thought they were great. The basil was a nice thing to have here, but if I make these again I may use even more garlic powder - I love garlic.

Great, simple recipe.  I needed croutons for the Christmas Eve Caesar Salad and I found a loaf of Ciabatta bread in the freezer.  I diced up the bread, added the oil and seasonings and in the oven it went.  The croutons had wonderful flavor and added a lot to the salad.  No need to buy croutons if you have an extra loaf of bread around.  This is a very good recipe with lots of flavor.

I will definitely make these again!  They are super delicious!  I substituted olive oil for veggie oil and added butter and grated garlic to the oil and heated it up slowly until the butter melted and then cooled to infuse the flavors.  Then drizzled the bread with the oil mixture and sprinkled bread cubes with fresh chopped parsley and grated parmesan cheese and baked at 350 degrees.  You may want to make a double batch because the first batch I made disappeared in 10 minutes.  Yummy is right on this recipe!!!

Don't throw out that old bread, make this !!!!!  I made these exactly as stated in recipe. Store-bought doesn't come close to the terrific flavor and crispness of these.  These are great to eat as a snack. I make these all the time.  My sister-in-law even asked me how to make these, and believe me it must have killed her to ask.

The croutons were delicious! But only while they were fresh and hot. For some reason mine didn't get crunchy - some were crunchy, but most of them ended up being chewy which I didn't like. I thought if I cooked them longer they would burn. I would make these again, but probably have to do it a little differently.

I love these things! They are so much better than store bought. I'll eat these instead of chips. I have to make extra cuz my girlfriend always takes a bag home with her. I just go to the bread store and buy bread. White and wheat are both good. I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also use a little cracked black pepper.

I bake whole wheat sourdough bread frequently. I had half a loaf going stale -- perfect for this recipe. I used only 2 tsp each of garlic powder and Italian seasoning. I served the croutons with my homemade vegetable stew. Delicious!

These were so good. My kids and husband loved them. I don't think I will buy store bought croutons anymore.

I thought these were okay. To be honest though, although I use these powdered seasonings, I liked the ones I made from the site with real garlic better. I threw in some parmesan cheese and some salt and pepper. I sliced some bread I made the other day from the site into 1/4" pieces like I normally due with croutons and cut back the oil and seasonings to the amount of bread I was using. I plan to use these with soup and hopefully they will be good.

These were very good! I did add some salt, that I felt they needed, and just eyeballed the garlic powder and dried basil. I baked mine @ 350 degrees, and that was a good temp to cook these on. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)
