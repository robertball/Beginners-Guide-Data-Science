The cookies were served at my church.  They were excellent.  Everyone liked the texture, taste and the apricot and prune fillings.

Made these for my daughter. Good recipe for kids to help with.   A nice little cookie.  Rating is only for cookie as we used chocolate chips for filling.

This recipe was perfect and gave me all the instructions I needed for the first time I made these Hamentashen.  Thanks for making our Purim celebrations complete.

Easy and delicious cookie. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. My cookies didn't look quite as lovely as the ones in the picture, but they were delicious - crispy with a yummy fruit and nut filling.
