Delicious! I made this in a Bundt pan for a 4th of July picnic, using fresh blueberries, and it went over really well. I used 2 c. of berries... also I drained the juice from the can of pineapple and added water to it to make one cup of liquid. I figured that would compensate for the liquid that would have been in the canned blueberries. Oh, also, I didn't put the cream cheese, sour cream mixture on the jello... I just served it in a dish beside the jello as a topping. That way people could use as much or as little as they wanted. I will definitely make this recipe again... really great flavor!

This was fabulous.  In reading the other reviews -I would add the following: I made this in a 2 quart jello mold as the recipe called and it umolded perfectly and looked gorgeous.  If I made this again, I probably would not add the cream cheese topping.  Although it worked out fine and tasted great, it just wasn't necessary and would sure save a lot of calories without it.  Lastly, canned blueberries are a fortune.  I would find away around those next time.  This recipe is a true keeper.  Thank you.

Everyone liked it very much. I used frozen since canned blueberries are quite expensive. It turned out fine but next time I'll add a little more water to compensate for the lack of blueberry juice in the can. When blueberries are in season I'll just pick our own and use them.

I have used this recipe for years and everybody loves it.  I use grape jello instead of raspberry.  I think it tastes much better.  This is one of my favorites!!

I have to say that this was my very first Jello mold. I thaught it was going to be diffacult to make. Boy was I wrong. This had to have been the most tastey mold I have ever eaten. Plus not to mention all the compliments I got after everyone tried it. I am going to be bringing this recipie to all my get togethers and Holidays. Thank you.

I served this for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was the first thing that was gone!  My husband and kids are extremely picky about any type of food, but it looks like I've finally found a winner!

THE OTHER REVIEWS LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS UNQUESTIONALBLY,A 5-STAR RECIPE.   I LEFT THE SALAD IN A GLASS 9X13 PAN, AS THERE WAS NO CONCIEVABLE WAY THAT IT WOULD UNMOLD FROM A PAN THAT SIZE.   IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.   I DIDN'T CARE FOR THE RECIPE AND THE REST OF MY FAMILY WOULD NOT EAT IT.   THE CREAM CHEESE LAYER WAS DISGUSTING.   I DOCTORED IT UP A BIT WITH SOME POWDERED SUGAR, BUT THE WHOLE LAYERED APPROACH TO THIS RECIPE WAS A BAD IDEA.   I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED PLAIN-OLD WHIPPED TOPPING.   I USED RASPBERRY JELLO, AS SUGGESTED, BUT WISHED I HAD TRIED "BERRY BLUE" OR "BLACKBERRY."   I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE, UNLESS YOU HAVE TRIED IT BEFORE & LOVED IT.

The only problems I had were that the sour cream and cream cheese did not mix very well, so the topping became pretty chunky. Also, the Jell-o didn not solidify as well as I hoped. Next time I will probably add less water. However, it tasted delicious, so I will definately make this again!

I didn't care for this much, but I'm still giving it 4 stars because I did not follow the recipe as stated - I used frozen blueberries instead of canned - big mistake.  I would HIGHLY recommend using the canned blueberries; my store was out so I substitued frozen and frankly, yuck. I might try this again, but I will follow the recipe exactly.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone thought it was good.  I couldn't find canned blueberries so used blueberry pie filling instead, and the flavour was great.

This is a family recipe and we LOVE it.  Also, walnuts can be used for the top if you don't have pecans on hand.  Perfect for special meals -- like Easter!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I used frozen blueberries instead of canned so I added some extra water.  I also cut the topping in half and that was the perfect amount.  I will make this agian!

This has been a family tradition for as long as I can remember. We just call it "jello-stuff" and it's one of the first dishes to get assigned for holiday gatherings. We make it with cherry pie filling instead of blueberry. No one has ever complained about too much of the topping :)

Very yummy.  I didn't turn out real nice the first time I made it, but tried it again and it looked much better this time.  Instead of topping the jello with the cream cheese mixture, I filled the 'hole' of the jello mold and then people just scooped some out with their jello.  But I'd only make half as much cream cheese mixture next time if I do that, as I had a lot left over.

Very similar to my grandmother's recipe from Louisiana. Difference is without the pineapples.  Thanks for posting.  Have been searching for this childhood recipe for a while.

Pretty good stuff - not at all like the gelatin molds of yesterday.  My husband, that doesn't care for Jello, was "ok" with it at he did eat it.  The kids loved it, as did I, so I'll give four stars.  Mine did hold together alright - I used more of the Jello mixture and less of the cream cheese mixture.  My mold is smaller than the recipe calls for, I guess because I had leftovers of both mixtures.  I only had about 1 1/2 inches of the cream cheese mixture on the bottom.  Maybe that's why it held up so well...

My Mother-In-Law made this but she layered it!  The jello first, refrigerate  until set.  Next layer cream cheese, sour cream, pecans, etc....then  refrigerate.  Last layer was another jello with the blueberries in it!  Refrigerate.  When set, oh my, oh my, this is ALSOLUTELY deeeelicious and looks beautiful too.  She made it in a nice cake type can, cut it in squares!

This is a tradition in our home every Thanksgiving and Christmas in place of cranberry since a majority of my family doesn't like cranberry. A great recipe for any time of year. LOVE it!
