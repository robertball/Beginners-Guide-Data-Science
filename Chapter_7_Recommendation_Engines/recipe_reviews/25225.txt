We tend to like our oatmeal chunky rather than watery or creamy. I used old fashioned steel cut oats, added a few more raisins, more cinnamon, more syrup and 1 t butter to each serving. Perfect! Thanks for the great breakfast idea Jenn.

This recipe was horrible! It was not creamy at all. Probably because it was made with water. It was very bland and nasty. Would never make this recipe again.

Great for breakfast - I did mine in the microwave and used real maple syrup.  I added a bit more raisins and it was delicious.

Just add another tablespoon of brown sugar & maple syrup, a dollop of butter, and 1/4 tsp. of salt - served with a bit of milk on top. You've got a very hearty, tasty, and creamy serving of oatmeal!

Very delicious! I made this for my 15 month old son, and he gobbled it up. I made a few changes, however. I didn't have any apples on hand, so I used 4oz of apple sauce. I also omitted both the raisins and maple syrup, and USED MILK instead of water. I never cook oatmeal with water because it has no flavor...I always use milk. It was nice and creamy and sweet and delicious. I may sprinkle in a few dashes of raw wheat germ before serving the next time for a little added nutrtion. Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!

I made changes as well after reading other reviews.  I added one more teaspoon of brown sugar, one more tablespoon of maple syrup, was very generous when I shook in the cinnamon and a tiny bit of salt.  I threw in about 1/2 teaspoon of butter and substituted 1/2 cup water for milk.
I toasted some walnuts while the water was boiling because I don't like raisins and topped it with cream as well as blueberries (you can never add too much fruit).
The base recipe was very good and the other suggestions were helpful.  I feel that adding toasted walnuts made this a 4 star breakfast for myself and my husband.

I made this using half milk and half water. It was good, but it was still lacking in some creaminess and flavour so I'll just use all milk next time. I added the apples (unpeeled to save time and nutrition) with the oatmeal because I like them somewhat softer. Next time I think I will add some walnuts for a little crunch.

I loved the cinnamon flavor, but it was way too sweet. I only put in half the brown sugar in the first place, and a little less maple syrup than called for. I had to cook it on low-medium for a long time to get rid of the extra water. The oatmeal box says 1.75 c. water per cup of oats; that's the way to go.

I read through the reviews and noticed that a lot of people were disappointed that the oatmeal was not creamy. I decided to fix that by using half fat free evaporated milk instead of all water. I like a lot of raisins in my oatmeal so I upped the raisins to a heaping quarter cup. I also cooked the raisins and apples in with the oatmeal because I wanted a plump raisin and the apples to be cooked just slightly. This was quite good, though a little sweet for me! Next time, I'll either use just brown sugar or just maple syrup and I might use all milk or half milk, half apple juice.

I'm always on the look out for oatmeal recipes, mainly because I like my little ones to eat it.  This was good after I tweaked it a little.  I used milk rather than water, added lots more brown sugar and cinnamon and left out the maple syrup and raisins.  My 2 year old loved the apples in this and I thought it was a terrific idea to added them to oatmeal.  I don't think you could get the "creaminess" by using water in my opinion.  Thanks for sharing Jenn.

What a nice change from plain old oatmeal! I did add about a 1/4 of a cup more oatmeal (I like mine thick) and I shredded the apple instead of chopping. I still served it with brown sugar and milk and it was delicious. My two year loved it and that says something.

This is pretty tasty once you make a lot of adjustments.  Water just doesn't make it creamy, milk is much better.  Two tablespoons of brown sugar makes this perfectly sweet.  A light pinch of salt rounds things out nicely.  As written, this is a three star recipe -- a good idea, but needs some work.  Thanks for the recipe, I did really enjoy it once I made the adjustments.

Loved it! Next time I'll add a little less sugar. I also like saving the syrup until the end and pouring a bit of it over top. So yummy!

I had never made oatmeal before, but this was a very easy recipe and it turned out pretty creamy. I left out the maple syrup cause I didn't have any and added some mroe brown sugar instead. I also substituted the  apples for peaches. Yummy!

This is a tasty, hearty breakfast. In order to make it creamy, I subbed half the water with milk. I also added the apple and raisins in with the oats so they'd get slightly softened. Next time, I'd add them even earlier.

I really liked this. My husband is a diabetic so I'm used to a low sugar diet. I used less brown sugar & Sugar Free Braums Pancake Syrup for the maple syrup. Put the unpeeled apples & big juicy raisins in with the water. Topped with blueberries. A healthy, filling way to start the morning.

I made only slight changes to the original recipe: left out raisins, added the apple with the water so that it really got cooked, and cooked the oatmeal longer (about 10-12 minutes) so that it was done more to my liking.  This could have been a bit sweeter.  Next time I would add more brown sugar.  I agree that it wasn't exactly creamy.  I think the name is a misnomer and the recipe might get better reviews if people weren't expecting it to be creamy!  But it was still pretty good.

I followed the recipe but added at least a tablespoon of half & half (for thicker/creamier consistency) & at least a couple tablespoons of walnuts (for protein & to make it a complete meal). It was sooo delicious & filling! Thank-you for this recipe!

This was a perfect oatmeal recipe. 

I did almost triple this and I also parboiled my raisins and apples (with skins on) in this mixture.  I added a bit more pure maple syrup for flavor.

It is thick oatmeal, however, that is how I eat my oatmeal.  If you prefer the creamier as my husband does, add milk which he did and loved it!

I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!  Thanks Jenn!

I really didn't like this. I was debating 2 or 3 stars. I needed to add more oats because after waiting about 7 minutes for the oats to absorb the water mixture nothing was happening. I left out the apples.. maybe that was my problem?

This sounded wonderful, but did not come out as well as I had expected.  It is a decent starter recipe, but by just adding things to oatmeal as to your own taste turns out much better, for instance, you couldn't even taste the maple syrup in this recipe, it need sooo much more brown sugar, and a tad bit of salt.  More cinnamon too.  Just make oatmeal and add these things to your own taste.  Thanks anyway.

A nice basic recipe, which you can "tinker" with and have a tasty, hot breakfast for your kids. I added a little salt, a teaspoon of butter, and I increased the cinnamon and syrup by a teaspoon.  I also cooked the raisins with the syrup mixture, so that they would be nice and plump. My kids gobbled it down. Thank you for your recipe.

I used half the oats and water called for but kept the measurements on the spices, and it turned out great. I also added a tablespoon of ground flax seed. Very good, but almost too filling, I might have to make even less next time.

To get it creamy, blend the oats before or after cooking. I didn't have milk and it doesn't agree with me anyway, so I did this. Also, I didn't follow this recipe closely. The blending part is what did it for me.

Hmmmm I replaced the water with milk, as I knew cooking oats with water would be bland. I added the cinnamon and some vanilla after the oats finished cooking, since I know the heat might destroy the fragrance. An okay recipe, I'll try again, maybe adding a tsp of margarine to the oatmeal next time?

Not creamy at all, more like "soupy"... and not in a good way. Don't let the photo deceive you, it is not what this recipe makes.

This was OK as written (which is how I made it).  With a few changes already suggested it could be great.  I agree with others that you need to add more brown sugar.  I'd probably use 2 Tbsp next time instead of teaspoons. Could also use more cinnamon and maybe double the maple syrup, which you couldn't taste at all.  I put my apples and raisins in while cooking to make them soft and warm.  I topped with a bit of butter too.  I'll try it again with some tweaks and see if we like it better.

We doubled this recipe so that we would have some leftovers to take to work the next day and that worked out pretty well.  The end result was marginally better than just plain oatmeal, but I wouldn't say the recipe is spectacular...but it is a good way to get a few more nutrients into your kids first thing in the morning.

Very easy and tasty.  It was a bit too sweet for me so next time I'll use a little less sugar.  I'll definately make this again.

I just added a little more brown sugar because it was bland. Overall, though it was pretty tasty and healthy.

This is delicious as written.  I have made a couple of modifications for our taste.  I put the apples and raisins in when the oats are added and I use half milk and half water.  This is a favorite with the family.

I don't understand how something can be creamy without using milk or cream or something similar.  I found that 2 cups of water was too much, and wasn't absorbed by the oats, even with extra cooking time added.  I tried this because of the description in the title, but it was definitely not creamy at all.

Tasty. I halved the recipe using steel cut oats. Swapped out brown sugar for coconut sugar. Also omitted the raisins and used some. Walnuts instead. The flavors were satisfying.

This was wonderful!!  I changed very little.  I did not put in the syrup, and i added the apples and the raisins to the water right away, I wanted them to have all the cooking too.  I will be making this all the time as I love oatmeal.  One more thing, In reference to some of the reviews...don't use the quick oats.

Good basic recipe. I like to add my raisins with the oats so they soften & plump a little (instead of at the end) and I tend to double the amount of raisins, so I add a bit more water and also a pinch of salt. I sometimes also add a few nuts OR a pat of butter. Yum! Thanks so much for sharing!

Pretty good. However, it wasn't quite as sweet as I like so I added a few small scoops of brown sugar before I ate it as well as a splash of milk.  After the few additions it was on spot!

"This is pretty good," is what my hubby said of this oatmeal, and I agree.  I followed the recipe, adding an extra tsp. of brown sugar.  It wasn't exactly creamy (I think you need milk to make it creamy), but it was very tasty and healthy.  Be sure to watch the water-sugar mixture so it doesn't boil over (like mine did - oh, what a mess!).  I would make this again, but adding a little salt and some more sugar.

I gave it 4 stars because I used milk in place of the water, added about 1/2 T butter, doubled the raisins, and added apples at the begining (kids prefer soft). My kids gobbled it up , and I must say not hard at all to make.
