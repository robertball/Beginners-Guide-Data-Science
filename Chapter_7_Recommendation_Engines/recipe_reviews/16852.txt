After a few modifications to this recipe it was excellent. I am giving it a four only because I changed some things. I left out the water chestnuts and the almonds. I used shredded cheddar cheese and cream of chicken soup. Great alternative if you hate mushrooms. In place of the almonds on top I took 18 round crackers, crumbled them and add them too hot melted butter in a fry pan to soften them up. Add those to the top of your casserole and it adds a nice buttery flavor and they crisp back up in the oven. (Great way to get rid of that half stale package of crackers thats sitting in your pantry!)This recipe defaults at 8 servings. I only made a 4 serving dish so be sure to double the crackers if you try this method.

I tried this last night for my boyfriend and I and we loved it.  I did use 1 cream of mushroom and 1 cream of chicken soup and it came out just fine.  I think next time I might add more broccoli because I love it.  I also didn't add the water chestnuts because I didn't have any on hand, but it was just great the way it was.  Thanks!  I'll be making this again.

This has always been a big hit when I cook it. I try many different kinds of cheese and I always use fresh brocoli. I also have topped with ground walnuts, makes a great change to it as well. Mozzarella cheese works very well and cheddar is another one I mix in sometimes for a sharp taste. I once added sweet corn, it was good, but I think simplicity is better. Does not make a good leftover the next day in my opinion.

Absolutely delicious! I made it pretty much as written, though I chose 1 can cream of brocolli and 1 can cream of asparagus just because I dislike mushrooms. The processed cheese sauce I chose was Tostitos salsa con queso which gave the whole thing a spicy kick. It is so tasty I cant wait for the leftovers.

This was awesome! I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly except that I omitted the water chestnuts and replaced the almonds with crushed cashews. Those cashews were awesome. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Really good and VERY EASY. I left out the water chestnuts and almonds, however, as I do not care for the "crunch".

This was very good. I did not give this five stars because it needed a touch more seasoning. I served it for Thanksgiving as an meatless entree.
I would definitely make againg,but with some more seasoning.

I made it for a party at a friend's house
and people came back the next day for 
leftovers.  Next time I make it I plan to 
only use 1 1/2 cans of soup though, it 
makes it a little salty otherwise.

Great recipe, I omitted the chestnuts and used crushed Ritz crackers instead of almonds to top it off. It was a hit that I will definitely be making again and again.

Made this for an Easter dinner--requested by our daughter.  I used only one can mushroom soup and 3 cups cooked rice.  Left out water chestnuts.  It was delicious.  Topped with the buttery cracker-butter mixture, as suggested by a reviewed, which was a great contrast to the texture of the rice-broccoli-soup combination.  Just used a rolling pin to crush the crackers right in the sleeve.  Worked great.  Will definitely make this again.  Could even add a little more broccoli, as it wasn't very dominant in the flavor of the casserole.  But overall, this was scrumptious.   (How do you spell that anyway?  Hope that's right.)

I'm rating this lowly because I found it to be a mushy mess without any flavor. There was crunch here and there with the water chestnuts and almonds but overall it felt very uninspired. It's definitely a simple recipe and I can see where picky kids would like it. I would maybe make it again on a night I don't feel like cooking but have to eat something.

Very disappointed in this recipe.  I was hoping it would be a scrumptous as the Broccoli Cheese casserole served at Cheddars with the added crunch from the water chestnuts.  It turned out dry and tasteless so now Im trying to rescue it by adding more rice and more cheese and some milk.

Awesome! I switched the processed cheese sauce for my own homemade cheese sauce and it was amazing. My boyfriend (who is not vegetarian) loved it.

Fabulous!  I cut the ingredients in half,
added 2 large chicken breasts, cubed, and 
omitted the chesnuts and almonds to suite
my own individual taste and it turned out 
to be a tremendous success.  I can't wait
to see how the leftovers will taste tomorrow
at lunch.

As is, 4 stars. With one reviewer`s suggestion to fry up some cheese cracker crumbs as topping, + another's suggestion to add milk (it's kinda dry unless you cream it up a bit), it's 5 stars, the kids loved it. Of course I also added some seasoning: garlic powder, worcester sauce and a drop of white wine to the cheese-soup mix, and parsley and paprika to the crumb topping. Will make again and again, I'm sure, cause it's easy! Thanks Paula for sharing.

This recipe is so simple and easy. Total prep/cook time including uncooked rice is exactly an hour for me. I omit the water chestnuts and almonds and used medium grain rice (stickier than long grain). It cost me $9 in ingredients ($4 of it is Cheez Whiz) for 8 servings... not high in value, but wonderful comfort food.

My fiance and I loved this dish.  I originally had plans to cut the recipe in half, but I'm glad I decided against it.  We quickly ate up the leftovers that I had stored away in the freezer.  The only thing I changed was to omit the almonds and water chestnuts.

Just made this for a Christmas gathering. It is great, but I made some changes to the original recipe so I only rated 4 stars as written. I did add some cheese cracker crumbs to top, as suggested by others, which was great. I didn't add chestnuts or almonds. I don't understand why the instructions are so complex on how to cook broccoli. Just steam for 10 minutes and drain. What I didn't understand was reviews that said "dry". I can imagine the one review that said "mushy mess" though. I only used 1 can soup (instead of 2) and a jar of con queso cheese sauce (the kind for dipping nacho chips). It was great this way. Very tasty and creamy enough to keep moist even as left overs. I will definitely make again.

Great dish!  I did the ritz cracker topping as someone else had suggested and loved it.  Another reviewer said this wasn't good leftover and I have to disagree, hubby loved it just as much leftover (and he's a pretty picky eater). :)

I swapped broccoli with fresh zucchini from my garden, added garlic powder, and topped lightly with Italian bread crumbs. It was delish!

I made this the day before Thanksgiving and it's absolutely delicious.  I didn't have Cheese Sauce, so I used the Velveeta cheese (looks like a brick), cut it in cubes and melted in soup.  It's super easy to make and really good.  The Water Chestnuts add a nice crunch, but their not bitter like celery.  Also, I topped the casserole off with crushed Cheeze-Its.  So good.
