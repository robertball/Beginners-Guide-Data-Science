This was actually tastier than I'd anticipated. I did replace the mayo with ranch dressing, however. I chose to bake this the same way I bake cornbread. I preheated my cast-iron skillet in the oven, then when I had the batter ready, I removed the skillet, added a little shortening, swirled it around and up the sides, then spooned in my batter. That method gives a nice crust, and roasted the Cheddar cheese a bit which was extra nice. I did use part whole-wheat flour and skim milk, also. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make this again!

Ugghh, another recipe claiming to be something in the title that it is not.  When I read the ingredients I said to myself this is not bread it is A BISCUIT.  And, I found out it was a GIANT BISCUIT shaped into the shape of a loaf of bread. I did not add the onions but that would have no affect on the texture of the recipe.  If I would have brushed this thing with garlic butter it would have been a giant cheddar bay biscuit.  Although, I like biscuits, when I am trying to make bread, I expect bread! Also, a lot more cheese than I would put in my cheese drop biscuits, which this loaf tasted exactly like. I wish I would have not wasted a whole block of cheese. Only two slices got eaten.

WOW!  This turned out great!!  I was skeptical thinking the amount of cheese was excessive, but it wasn’t.  This looked absolutely gorgeous coming out of the oven.  I made it in a loaf pan, instead of a cake pan, and it rose beautifully into a nice high, well-rounded loaf.  The only thing I’d change next time would be to increase the salt just a bit.

It took about 35 minutes for this to bake.  I had to cover with foil during the 5 minutes so that it wouldn't get too brown. I loved the green onions in this!  It was even better reheated the next day.

I was a little worried that 2 cups of Cheddar cheese was a lot for this one size bread, but it wasn’t. I always use fresh buttermilk when milk is called for in a recipe. I wasn’t worried about the addition of mayonnaise because I know it adds moistness to the bread. I added minced green onions. The batter was wet, slightly sticky and very thick, but came together well. I used a 9x13 pan instead of a round pan because I really wanted a loaf shape. The bread baked up beautifully in 35 minutes producing a light golden color and releasing a cheese-y aroma! The smell of the bread was amazing but tasted even better! It was moist, flavorful and fresh tasting. The cheese turned out to be the perfect amount and I loved all the fresh green onions throughout the bread! This bread kind of reminds me of a cheddar bay biscuit. It has a nice golden cheesy crust with specks of green onions which made for a pretty bread especially when sliced (See my picture in the photo gallery). The crust is slightly crisp with cheddar cheese baked right on top. The inside is soft and flavored. This bread was easy to make, cheesy and wonderful. I wouldn’t change a thing about this recipe except maybe increase the salt just a tad bit to a total of ½ tsp. I served this bread with, “Cheesy Chicken Broccoli Casserole,” from my personal recipe. These two matched up perfectly for tonight's  meal. Thou I am sure this cheesy bread would pair well with any casserole, soup, chowder, stew or chili.

I saw a picture of this in the morning and thought it would go good with some chili. And it did. I used seasoned taco cheese and threw a small can of chiles in it. It's a very dense bread. I might use some chili powder in it next time.

This was okay. It was pretty bland. I'll make it again, but add some garlic salt to it. I also agree with other reviewers that it was more like a biscuit than bread.

Forgive me Marillyn, I like to make thing as written so I can make a proper review. However, i saw the reviews with some saying it was dry.
I ended up adding a little over 1/4 cup of oil to the wet ingredients (true biscuit fashion would have butter/margarine cut into the flour mix) and added some garlic salt. It was FANTASTIC and moist!  Thanks for sharing this!

This was pretty good. It was a little dry, but that may have been due to the long cooking time needed to get the middle done. I think it would be really good baked in a muffin tin.

I made this according to the recipe with no changes.  The bread is very dense and really not much flavor.  We were disappointed because it smelled wonderful while baking, but lacked in taste.

This was o.k.  If you're looking for bread, heads up...this is definitely more like a biscuit, which I was expecting and wanting.  It was just missing something for us flavor wise..couldn't pinpoint what.

I was expecting a bread-like feel to this, but to me it was more like a biscuit.  I would have liked it as a bread, but I actually like it better, since I love biscuits!  Maybe that's because I baked it in a loaf pan?  Don't know, and don't care, will make again.  Would be great with soup!

Sorry to say this was not very good.  It def needs some seasoning. It had no flavor other than cheese. I used sharp cheddar and I normally do not salt my food. Even my 12 year old human garbage disposal would not eat it! I will not make again.

Flavor was good.. I followed recipe exactly.. but after rec. cook time mine was not done on bottom. after 10 more minutes center was still kind of wet and dense..  used clear glass pie plate, middle rack- don't know.. the flavor was good.. this dough was just like biscuit dough and could be rolled or dropped.. like I said though, the flavor was great, hence the 4 stars...

This bread was very easy to make.  It had more of a biscuit consistency than I was expecting but overall it was very good. I think that green onions add something special. My husband and I loved it and will definitely make it again.

The dough was really thick for a casserole bread. As a result, even though I baked it much longer thanthe suggested time, the centre was doughy, while the outside was done. The parts that were cooked were delicious, so I may try this again and add more liquid.
