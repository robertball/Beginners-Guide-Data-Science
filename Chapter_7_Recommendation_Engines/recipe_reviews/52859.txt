This is wonderful and so easy to make. The last time I made it, we added blackberry pie filling between the cream cheese filling and the top crescent roll layer. It was to die for. I think next time we will try other flavors of pie filling

VERY good!  I brought this to a social gathering and not one person there didn't want the recipe!  There was about 15 people there.  I am very impressed with how easy this is and how AWESOME it tastes!  One of the people exclaiming about the recipe, said it tasted much like a cinnamon roll but not as sweet because of the cream cheese!  I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again!

Next time I would add a layer of pie filling over the cream cheese layer.  Then gently roll out the top layer of crescent dough with a rolling pin until smooth...lay over top of the pie filling and trim to fit.  I brushed on less than half the melted butter called for and next time would sprinkle a generous layer of granulated sugar with a dusting of cinnamon...otherwise the top is very brown and it's difficult to judge the colour of the pastry at the end of the cooking time.  A big party hit...I would serve it warm, at room temp or chilled.

I've already reviewed this, but I came back to print it out and wanted to add that I used Splenda instead of sugar and Smart Balance instead of butter and I still got the best results possible.

I was pretty skeptical of this recipe, but decided I had to try it based on all the positive reviews.  Yes, like everyone else says, it is much more like a cheese danish than a true cheesecake.  No matter what you call it though, it was really delicious and super easy!  I definitely would use reduced fat crescent rolls and reduced fat cream cheese for this next time- I don't think you'd ever notice a difference in flavor with all the butter, sugar and cinnamon in this.  I also would use less butter on the top.  I only used about 1/3 cup and I thought that was a even more than necessary.  For presentation, I topped mine with chopped pecans for the last 10 minutes of baking time.  It looked nice, but would have tasted great without them too.  Thanks for a recipe that's definitely a keeper!

I don't know, maybe after reading all of the rave-reviews, I was expecting something more... No one disliked it, but no one was "raving" either, and I thought it tasted more like a sweet, breakfast danish than a dessert cheesecake.  Also, it didn't end up with much visual appeal either, which might not matter to some, but I like my food pretty.  I followed the directions exactly, served after chilling in the fridge.  It tastes good, but a little blah... I do like the idea of adding a pie filling.  If I try again, I'll add a layer of pie filling, reduce the sugar, cut the butter in half, and serve with coffee for breakfast.

Great recipe- easy!! It was the only food item that was gone at the end of my friend's party. I think that if I use a glass baking dish the next time, I will lower the temperature- the top was a little too brown, but it was still delicious!

I baked this tonight and planned to serve it tomorrow evening.  My husband returned home from a meeting and insisted on having a piece shortly after it came out of the oven.  Even warm, this has a really rich creamy flavor.  I am sure that it will be even better when cooled and chilled properly.  Easy, but yummy.
***UPDATE***Yummy when chilled, also.  Keeps well when covered in the fridge...not that there are many leftovers!

Easy yet Really Good!!  Can serve hot or cold.  I used apple pie filling aswell.  I would suggest simply laying out the strips of crescent dough and place next to one another rather than trying to make it all once piece of dough.

I used the basic recipes without cinnamon though.  I precooked the bottom crust for about 10 minutes to get it partially baked as some reveiwers found the bottom not cooked through.   I then whipped together 2 bricks of cream cheese and one can of lemon pie filling and 1 cup of sugar.  I spread it over the bottom crust ( it was still pretty hot), and topped it off with the top layer of cresent dough.  I then melted about 1'4 cup butter and 2 tblsp. sugar in the microwave for about 1 minutes and drizzles this on top of the pie.  I baked it uncovered for about 35 minutes.   I took it to a dinner party and boy did it go fast!

This cheesecake was delicious and so easy. I only had 1 tube of crescent dough so I divided it in 1/2 and pressed 1/2 of it into a 9" springform pan. I traced the pan on parchment paper and pressed the other 1/2 of the dough out into a circle shape. After making the filling and pouring it onto the bottom dough, I just flipped the parchment paper over to add the top crust. It worked perfectly. It was a big hit at my Halloween party. I will be making this recipe again.

This isn't the prettiest thing to look at, but it was so easy and definitely a hit.  I used low fat cresent rolls and low fat cream cheese and put in alittle bit less sugar than it called for and it was still quite sweet.  Served with fresh strawberries on top.  Definite keeper!

I didn't use any butter to top it and it looks great (not burnt like some of the pics). Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar and it's perfect. One of our favs!!

This is so amazing! I love to complain about how picky my boyfriend is, but really, he never likes the crust on any of my desserts. The first thing he said about this one? "I like the crust!" I about had a heart attack :) I love how it's rich but not too rich, and cinnamon is a nice different touch. Definitely a keeper, thanks!

Definitely worth it to put the pie filling in! This is only my first time making it. It is more like a danish. Next time I'd make it for a brunch vs a dessert. Mine turned out much more brown on top than the picture above shows b/c of the cinnamon sugar mixture, but it was still very tasty!

This is a great recipe if you're looking for a different kind of cheesecake.  The top gets almost crunchy from the butter/sugar/cinnamon combo.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing!

This  "cheese danish" is very easy to make. Warm, the bottom crust is very doughy and seems under cooked after chilling this is not a problem. I used vanilla and almond extact which gave the cream cheese a very nice flavor. I also added a layer of  cherries on top of the cheese and used sliced almonds on the top crust. I would not serve this as a dessert but use as a breakfast or brunch dish.

I have made this recipe for years, it is ALWAYS a hit. I would suggest mixing the sugar and butter, bring to a boil, then pour over the crescents.  Sprinkle w/ cinnamon.  Forget serving cold, serve hot out of oven.  People will beg for more!

My pastor came over for lunch and I'd made a small (1/2) size for dessert. During lunch, he mentioned reading an article that pointed to "cinnamon" as the latest discovery in combating cholesterol, heart disease and several types of cancer. I pulled out this cheesecake and we proclaimed it "health food!!" It is one of the best I've ever had; we call it Danish, though, not cheesecake!

The idea sounds really good but wasn't "mind blowing".  I tried to change it up...I used the ready to eat cheesecake filling and added chocolate chips to the filling.  It was okay, highly doubt I'll be making this again.

This was very good. I halved the recipe. Husband loved it. There are cheesecakes I've made which I've enjoyed more, howEVER, this one is absolutely effortless and can be thrown together in just a few minutes. So for that reason, I will be making this again. Thanks!

Very easy and very tasty.  It is indeed more of a "danish" than a cheesecake, but very good.  My husband and son loved it.  My only addition to the recipe : I sprinkled some chocolate chips over the cream cheese filling.  I did prebake my bottom crust for 5 minutes, no soggy bottom!  Will make this again.  Thanks.  :)

The reason I made this was that my son is allergic to eggs and nuts, and I needed a make-ahead dessert because I was having guests coming right when I got home from working a full day...I loved how easy this recipe was, and how inexpensive the ingredients were.  I got rave reviews - people were talking about it and asking for the recipe for days afterward.  I did make 2 small changes - the amount of butter on the top seemed to be way too much, so I decreased it by half - and did the same to the cinnamon/sugar top - decreased it by about 1/4.  I also think that a great adaptation would be to use 1/2 of the cream cheese filling and 1/2 of the butter/sugar topping and it would be a great brunch item - it tastes very similar to a cheese danish.

So easy, so delicious.  My boss made this for a work function a couple of years ago and I couldnt get it out of my head.  IT IS SO GOOD.  Great for dessert or breakfast ;)

This should be called the most amazing No Fuss cinnamon cheesecake!! I am in cheesecake heaven right now :) I was in the mood to bake something today but i wanted it to be simple. I found the perfect thing when i found this recipe. The only thing i did different was use less butter, and less cinnamon sugar mix. Also it didnt take the whole 30 mins to bake in my oven. It was about 20- 25 mins.My kids liked it as well. I will be making this more often.

I'll give this recipe 5 stars because everyone who tried it (8ppl) loved it. I could not get over pouring 1 stick of melted butter over top ~ I'll try less next time. I thought that it was cheesy enough to pass for a thin cheesecake and would still refer to it as a cheesecake~type dessert. I'd also try a bit less sugar topping as well though everyone said it was great as it was.

VERY simple and VERY good. Several compliments received from this recipe. I did make a few changes. I added 1 Tbsp. Almond Extract in addition to the Vanilla. I also added almond slivers during the last 10 minutes of baking. Next time, I will reduce the butter to 1/4 cup. My Mom, who doesn't like sweets, loved this!!! I will defenitely make this again.

I've made this twice and it's been a  big hit. I agree with others that one should add just a few minutes to the baking time. 

An additional note. Don't be afraid to use alll of the cinnamon sugar mixture! The thick sugary top is part of the charm, and it doesn't come out too sweet at all.

I had big hopes, but they didn't come through.  Definitely not an attractive dessert, and definitely more of a danish of some sort than a cheesecake.  Cold crescent bread doesn't appeal to me.  The filling is very tasty, but I would not make again.

If you can wait until this cools, this is the easiest and best of desserts. Rich and complex. No one can figure it out unless you tell them. One pan makes a lot. I doubled the recipe and had leftovers though everyone flipped over it. Very rich too. I've made it several times. A no-fail recipe for sure.

I only had 1 package of crescents, so I used an 8x8 pan and halved all of the ingredients.  It turned out great!  I agree with some other reviewers that it might be more of a breakfast item than a dessert, but either way it is delicious and I'll definitely make it again.

Oh. Heck. Yes. I halved the recipe and didn't measure anything, I just did it until it felt good, which is how I do most of my cooking. Added probably a couple of tablespoons each of honey and lemon juice to the cream cheese, and then spread probably about 1/3 of a cup (remember, I halved the recipe!) of cherry preserves on top of that before putting the top layer of dough on. I also probably only used about half of the amount of sugar called for, in the cheese and on top. Absolutely delicious. Thanks for a great 'starting off point'!!

Wow, this recipe is SO good!  I too had my doubts about using crescent rolls, but I can't even tell!  I made this for 4th of July and I wasn't so sure about it on Saturday but the next day I tried it again and it was SO good.  I think waiting a day for the filling to really harden is what made the difference.  I will make this again and again!

I just made this today, but did it a little different because I didn't have the crescent dough.  I followed the recipe and then poured it into a graham cracker crust, baked it and put it in the fridge.  I then made the One Minute Chocolate Icing from this site and poured it on top of the cooled cheesecake and then put it in the freezer for 10 minutes to firm up the icing.  It was to die for!  I thought it was anyways.  I make the icing more chocolaty than sweet which goes better with the already sweet cheesecake. Thanks for a super easy cheesecake recipe!

The only reason why I am giving this four stars instead of five, is that it really isn't a cheesecake.  Like others have said, this is more like a danish.  The flavor is excellent and the preparation is soooooo easy!

This was ok.  I overbaked it a little - hard to tell when it's browned when the entire top is covered in brown cinnamon.  My family said it tasted more like a coffee cake, said it was good, but also left me with a lot of leftovers - very unlike them.  Probably won't make this again.

It was a nice idea, but all over way too sweet.  It really needs something to cut down on all that sweetness, and pouring butter and sugar on the top is just overkill.  Give it a try though, you might like it.  It just wasn't recieved well at the dinner party I took it to.

This was very easy to make and delicious. I was a little disappointed that the only thing cinnamon was sprinkled cinnamon on top, so I sprinkled cinnamon on the dough before I put cheesecake in and added a generous amount of cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling. I then sprinkled cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar on top as suggested by someone else's review. It was ok chilled but I thought it was a little smushy, so I heated it and put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it. It was fantastic!!!

My son fell in love with it at our church picnic last month and asked me to make it for his cross country team's spaghetti dinner. The boys loved it! I would have liked more filling so I think I'll add another brick of cream cheese next time. I only used 1/4 cup margarine and all of the connamon sugar. My daughter suggested adding chocolate (go figure) so I may try that next time too. I can see several variations.

Ok, wow!  This was a hit.  I was just at a cabin for the holiday with 20 of my relatives.  I decided to make this since I had a big crowd to help me determine if this one is worth keeping.  Well, it was.  Since the cabin was not well stocked with cooking tools, I had to guess on the sugar.  I would say that I used maybe 1 cup for the entire recipe.  about 2/3 with the cream cheese and then the rest mixed with the cinnamon to go on top.  I let it cool just a bit, but we basically ate this on the warm side.  I walked away from it for a moment and 3/4 of it was gone and people were coming back for seconds.  This will be made again for sure...a perfect brunch or breakfast sweet!!! Next time I make this I am going to sprinkle in some mini chocolate chips!

Oh my!  So easy (not usually what I go for).   Followed the recipe.  Would also be good with fruit in it.  But really, it is perfect on its own.  I froze individual pieces of this.  If not, it would have been gone in an afternoon (and there are only 2 of us)....  Dangerous:-)

This recipe is wonderful!  I made a couple changes by adding raspberry pie filling on top of the cream cheese mixture, eliminating the cinnamon, and during the last ten minutes of baking adding slivered almonds to the top to make it look nicer.  I made this for a jewelry party and everyone raved.  Most people thought I got it at a bakery.  This is definitely not cheesecake though.  It is a great danish!

great idea! I was skeptical at first but needed a fast, easy dessert. After one bite, my friends were hooked! They finished an entire 9x13 pan. I'm still trying to find a way to make the dish more "attractive".. but it tastes great! Maybe will try sliced almonds or confectioner's sugar  on top.

This is one of the best cheesecakes I have ever had or made. The crazy thing is that it takes exactly no time to do. I ate this cheesecake for almost a week and never got tired of it. Five stars.

This is easy and delicious.  I wouldn't necessarily call it cheesecake - more like a cheese danish - but it's still very good.  I added pecans on top and took it to a brunch.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

This was so quick and easy!!!  I took it to a wine/ cheese/ dessert party and it was gone within minutes!  By far the fastest and easiest dessert I think I've ever made.  If you're running low on ingredients you can cut out some of the filling and put it in a pie pan, & I didn't use even 1/2 of the butter and only 1/2 of the cinnamon topping as well!

This is a "no-frills" recipe that is a SURE thing!  I have made it at parties, and there are NEVER any leftovers (and pretty much everyone wants the recipe).  In fact, that is how I first discovered it!  If you are looking for something a bit lighter in calories, or fat, try substituting light or no-fat cream cheese for regular.

This recipe it GREAT. So EASY and absolutly delicious.  I think that it would be perfect for a brunch, but is awesome anytime. I didn't end up using as much butter as the recipe listed though.

Well, (like other reviewers mentioned) this is not like cheesecake in tastes or appearance, but, hey, who cares? It tastes great, is cheap to make and easy to prepare. I used low fat ingredients also and it still was good. I would definitely make this again. If you skip the butter topping and just sprinkle with powdered sugar, voila - you have a cheese danish to serve for breakfast!

This was delicious!  My daughter liked the thought of putting cinnamon on a cheesecake instead of cherries or strawberries, and loved the flavor.  My only problem was using crescent rolls.  Next time I'll just buy the pie dough. (Yes, there will DEFINITELY be a next time!)

I love these little bites of heaven.  There is room for additives like fruit filling and chocolate chips.  A friend of mine brought these to a gathering and they were gone in no time.  She is not allowed to show up without a batch of them.

If the rave reviews I received on Christmas Day weren't so good, I would have probably given this one four stars. I thought it was pretty awesome, but of course, it doesn't measure up to "real" cheesecake. On the other hand, it is as advertised since it truly is "no-fuss." On that basis, I gave it five stars. My brother and son both raved extensively about it. Because I had not prepared this recipe before, I wanted to try it before serving to my family on Christmas Day, so I cut it up into bars. This was a good way to serve it. The entire cake was served in "bar" form, which made it more attractive than it was as a "cake."

Tasty recipe! Easy to assemble and so well liked, it was half gone before dinner was even served. I used almond extract in the cream cheese mixture and sprinkled sliced almonds on the top crust before baking. An easy, adaptable recipe!

I love this.  So easy and people request it a lot.  Be careful to use only the amount of butter you're supposed to, the bread has butter in it and can easy be over sliming if you over do it .  So good.  Try squeezing a few lines in the cream cheese filling.  Yum!!!

I use this recipe so much! It's very simple and always tastes incredible. The filling can easily be used as a filling for practically  any other desert, as it doesn't necessarily have to be baked.

I cut the amount of butter/sugar/cinnamon used for the topping in half and it was still AMAZING.  So easy to make too!  I also prebaked my bottom layer for 5 minutes.  Would probably taste great with pie filling, fruit or chocolate chips added to the cheesecake.  Definitely a keeper!  Some have complained that it's not much to look at, but as far as presentation, I think mine looks beautiful!  Photo submitted.

Made it as directed...tasty! A bit too creamy texture-wise, so, the next time I made it, I added 2 egg yolks and a splash of fresh lemon juice. Bingo-a more firm, cheesecakey taste and texture! Wouldn't have known where to start without you!

Awesome dessert.  My original recipe calls for making this in a sheet pan approx. 10x15.

WHAT A HIT!!!!  You can get away with dividing the recipe between two 9 inch pie plates if you roll he dough carefully and want a thinner crust!  I added apple pie filling on top of the cheese layer and used less of the sugar mixture than called for.

This recipe was AWESOME!!!!  I have a tremendous sweet tooth and this will be made over and over!  I did take the advice of another review and added a blueberry pie filling...TO DIE FOR!!!  The only thing I wasn't happy about was that the bottom layer of "crust" was not totally cooked and was doughy.  I may try next time just baking the bottom for a bit just to ensure that it's cooked at the end.  Otherwise a definite keeper!  Thanks for the great & easy recipe!

This is a great cheese danish,  not a cheesecake.  I am a "from scratch baker" and this s a very good danish.  I sprinkled 1 cup honey roasted sliced almonds to top before baking and it is fabulous!  Great recipe!

I made this for a baby shower this past weekend and everyone LOVED it! It was so simple, the only thing I did different was to add almond extract to the cream cheese filling.I definatley recommend doing that!

I didn't think that this recipe was all that special. Possibly it was something I did, but I followed the recipe exactly. It tasted good, but I don't think this is something that I would make again.

This was a big hit at thanksgiving desert time, I had requests for seconds!  it's very rich and delicious, the cinnamon topping was a perfect addition.  I thought the crust was going to be weird but was pleasantly surprised.  I even made with reduced fat cream cheese and came out great!

As everyone says, presentation not great, but I got some good compliments from it.  Including from someone that does excellent baking.  She requested the recipe and used it at a baby shower for a friend's daughter.  She said she got rave reviews from it as well.  Thanks!

Delicious! I added a can of blackberry pie filling and it was great. The only problem I had was that the bottom layer of dough didn't get quite done enough. Next time I will add a few minutes to the baking time.

This delicious dessert recipe is the best I've enjoyed in a long time!  My husband is not really into desserts, but said this one was a "keeper".  I used one regular cream cheese and one 1/3less fat cream cheese. Also, I used one regular crescent roll package and the other one with lower fat and it was still delicious.  Couldn't find 10 ounce size crescent rolls, so I used 8 ounces. This is a fantastic dessert for company!!!

This recipe is simple and everyone absolutely loved it.  It was much better than I expected.  I wasn't able to find 10 ounce cans so I had to buy three 8 ounce cans and had left over dough.  I also used a little bit smaller pan so the cream cheese would be a thicker.

How can you not be skeptical about this recipe? It just sounds too good to be true... ya better believe it because this cheesecake is amazing. I made it for Christmas as well as some pumpkin pies for a "back up". Well they pies didn't even get touched... I was SO impressed. This one's a keeper!

I made this for dessert last night and it was incredibly easy and very good---everyone loved it.  Next time I make it, which will be soon, I will probably put a fruit topping on instead of cinn and sugar.

I would rate this a 5 * for simplicity. It has great flavor but as one mentioned before it isn't one of  the prettiest desserts you could make. I will add ch. nuts on top next time.  It is much better chilled.  I agree, it is more like a cheese danish. You have to try it!

This was more like a coffeecake than a cheesecake...but nonetheless very delicious and easy!  I added pecans to the top with cinnamon and sugar...YUM!  Even my finicky son said it was good...and he rarely says that!  Try it!

This was really good.  I too had a "backup" dessert because I really didn't know what to expect.  Not really a cheesecake, I don't know what you would call it except delicious.

This recipe is fantastic.  I maybe would decrease the butter-but just a bit, if at all.  From now on, I have these ingredients on hand just in case I need something sweet in a hurry.  We have had it at brunch and as dessert, and everyone that has tried it could not believe it was so easy to make.

This is an easy-to-make yet wonderful dessert. Even my friends who can't cook have made it. It's become one of my 'signature' desserts! Very, very good.

Well this certainly isn't cheese cake, but it is certainly delicious! This is a very easy to make and very tasty pastry that will be made time and time again in my house. As others have stated this is really more like a cream cheese danish. Thanks for the recipe Mellisa!

I took these to a potluck and everyone loved them! I even got a few requests for the recipe.  My husband took the leftovers to work the next day and they were a huge hit! These will definately be a staple dessert in my house from now on.

This was good, I would use this for a brunch rather than a substitute for a dessert.  It was more like a cheese danish.
