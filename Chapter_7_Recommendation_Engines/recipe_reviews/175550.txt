I was having a bad day. A real bad day. This sandwich saved my day. Very simple and very good. I don't like miracle whip, so I used mayo. I kept everything else the same. This is a new favorite. Thank you for sharing.

I thought this was an interesting concept for a sandwich, but I don't eat pork so I substituted chicken. I also added white grapes to the mix. Superb!

This is tasty, but why close the sandwich while grilling, then open to put in the apple-nut mixture? It's easier to leave it open face, then add the apple-nut mix and close the sandwich. much neater.

I loved this!  It was so good!  I didn't have any thick cut ham, but thin works well too.  Its easy to make and very tasty!

This was good but I was hoping the granny smith would give it a little more pop. The fruity taste was rather subtle.  I may add some craisons next time.  Otherwise, a very good sandwich.

Flavor was great, the texture was all wrong. I used a golden delicious apple, sharp cheddar cheese, and light mayo since I didn't have any Miracle Whip. Instead of cooking the sandwich and taking it apart to put the filling in, I cooked each side open faced and then put the apple filling and then put top and bottom together. I just didn't think prying apart a melted cheese sandwich was a good idea. The flavors were all great together but I couldn't finish more than a couple of bites due to the mushy wet texture of the apple/mayo filling. I really wanted to like this sandwich but it wasn't my thing. Sorry. But as always I love cooking and got to try out a new recipe! Thanks Wife218.

I wish I had known years ago how to make grilled cheese sandwiches this way, when I had 5 children to raise. These are so crispy on the outside and so yummy cheese on the inside. It doesnt get any better.

This is awesome. All I had was walnuts, and red apple. Doesn't matter. I love the texture, the crunch of the nuts was my favorite! I will be using the filling in lots of sandwiches! Thanks so much!

I was really looking forward to making this tonight. I bought the cheese, bread, ham and apple and brought them home. I found that the sour cream had expired and someone had eaten the pecans. I used Helman's Mayo and substituted Hidden Valley Lite Ranch for the sour cream. I used some almonds and cashews instead of the pecans and did the rest as per recipe. They turned out GREAT. My wife and I loved them. I can't wait to make them again...I just wonder if I will use the recipe as suggested or make it with the substitutions I used tonight. Thanks!

The apple-nut mixture is what really sets this sandwich apart from others...good combo of flavors.  You get a little pop of sweetness and a nice crunch from the apples.  The pecan flavor is there, but it's subtle.  Colby is a mild cheese, and I'll use sharp cheddar the next time, but that's just a taste preference.  Nice change for a grilled cheese sandwich and quick to put together.

I wanted a quick and easy dinner so decided to try this on a whim. It was great! I omitted the pecans and used wheat bread instead of sour dough. Simple and quick to make, this one is a keeper!

The sandwich turned out alright, but between the cheese, the sour cream, and the mayonnaise, it needs something to cut the creaminess of the dairy. I suggest freshly-squeezed lemon juice or a splash of red wine or apple cider vinegar. Some better quality deli meat might also improve the taste, such as Boar’s Head.

So good and simple. I used thin slices or French bread because that is what I had. I also added dried cranberries. Yum!
