This is quite possibly my favorite recipe I've ever found on this site! The only alterations I made, is I use the bag of already chopped toffee chips and some chocolate chips!

This is one of the best coffee cakes that I have baked.  I have made the recipe 3 times in the past week.  Once for my husband and myself, and twice to take to an outing of women golfers.  Everyone loved it.  Very easy, except for "smashing" the toffee bars...that required a little more effort.

I made this for my boyfriend who loves coffee cake, i did increase the flour and decrease the milk each by only about 1/4 cup, this cake was delicious and stayed moist and fresh for several days!! I will make this again!

Very good. I made it the day prior, based on other reviewers stating that it was very moist even a day or two after prep. So moist, that it did crumble a bit when handled (oven temp/ingredients/baking time were right on). I may increase the flour / decrease the milk a little next time to firm it up just a bit more. I also substituted pre-crushed toffee bits (usually in the baking aisle by the chocolate chips) instead of crushing the bars, and substituted chopped pecans for the peanuts. Personal preference. Pecans just seem to have a sweeter flavor to them, and I think lend themselves well to a baked dessert recipe. I can't imagine this being bad with any kind of nut, however. Except pine nuts ;-). Mmmmm.......mmmmmmmm........toffee.

Excellent recipe! This is so good the first day, but is sooooo much better the next day and stays moist for several days. I used packaged toffee bits to avoid breaking up the candy bars. We prefer the bits w/o chocolate for this recipe. We love this recipe and people with whom we've shared the cake beg us to make it again and again.

I made this coffee cake this past weekend.  I wasn't overwhelmed with the taste and felt that it was lacking something.  I think if I was ever to make it again, I would be sure to serve it alongside some caramel sauce to give it some extra flavour.

I expected to LOVE this cake...and was underwhelmed. The flavor was okay, but something about using peanuts kind of ruined it for me. There are so many great coffee cakes out there. This isn't one of them!

This recipe is pretty good but could be better. I really feel as though there is too much milk which ultimately makes the coffee cake fall apart. I liked the use of toffee and peanuts on the top, but I wouldn't include as much flour in that top crumb mixture. The flour kind of made the topping underwhelming and slightly bland.  I would expect a little more sweetness from a coffee cake crumb topping.

I served this at a ladies luncheon and everyone finished their serving and commented they liked it.  I didn't have toffee bars but had toffee chips and chocolate chips.  I used 6 oz of toffee chips and about 1/4 cup or less of chocolate chips.  My husband said it was okay but I keep catching him snitching the leftovers.

Really good. A little crumbly. Definitely use the toffee chips and its thin, so next time I will double or use a smaller pan.

It is SUPER sweet but very good. I used pecans instead of peanuts because of personal preference, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The crumb topping is delicious but doesn't fully stick to the cake. Nonetheless, I will be making this again because the cake is moist and flavorful. Next time, I might use less sugar in the cake and a little less toffee in the topping.

The cake deserves 5 stars, as does the topping- the only reason I'm only giving this cake 4 stars is that the cake and the topping don't really go together as well as I'd like.  While both are delicious in their own right, I wouldn't necessarily pair them.  The cake is amazingly moist and flavorful and would lend itself well to any number of coffee cake toppings.  The toffee/peanut topping is delicious but would probably be better mixed into a cookie or used as an ice cream topping.  Either way, the flavors are great!

I made this recipe and my fiance Loooved them! He finished the whole tray within 24 hours. Not a good thing but it gives you an idea as to how tasty they are. I left out the chocolate and peanuts. 
Also, it is great with a bit of whipped cream on the side.

I thought it was okay.  I added peanut butter chips in the topping because I didn't have enough toffee.  I also used walnuts instead of peanuts...it's all I had available.

Thanks for this great recipe - definitely a favorite with me and my family!  I love heath bars, so I tried simply substituting the toffee bars for heath bars and it turned out just as great. I know replacing the toffee bars totally defeats the purpose of the title of the recipe, but I just love heath bars. And you can also add both, making it that much more sweeter.

Here's how much this is a no-screw-up recipe: Done late at night while tired, I mis-read the instructions.  Instead of reserving a 1/2 cup each of crumble and chocolate bar for the top, I reserved 1/2 the entire amount. Plus I forgot the peanuts on top. So despite it missing half the ingredients, it turned out great and I got requests for the recipe!

I made this the day before an event that I was in charge of baking for, and it was seriously perfect.  I don't know how it was the same day I baked it, but it was definitely incredible the second day.  Great recipe!  Instead of the chocolate covered toffee bars, I just used the toffee pieces.  I forwent the nuts due to concerns about nut allergies and chopped some semi-sweet baker's chocolate and used that for the topping.  It went over well.

This is an excellent recipe. Everyone at work just loved this. 
Next time I make this I will substitute peanuts for macadamia nuts. I bet you could use almonds or pecans. This is very good.

Thank you V, for sharing this recipe; one of the faves. I used buttermilk (tender) and pecans instead, and increased butter to 8 tbs (1 stick = 125g); made my own toffee choc bar. Added more vanilla flavour. I've even made this with less nuts and toffee which went into the mix instead of as streusel topping, yum yum. Oh and only 1 cup scant brown sugar, with the toffee it is just enough sweetness. This is for those who likes lots of buttery nutty tasty cake.
