This was the BEST sauerbraten we have ever eaten. You could cut the meat with a fork! I used a sirloin tip roast, so it shrunk a lot, but I expected that. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I'm already looking forward to having this again!

Nobody at my dinner table ate this....they INHALED it!! LOL This was awesome! I might rate this twice just so I can give it 10 Stars! Like another reviewer, I was concerned about adding the hot liquid to the meat when beginning to marinate, so the only thing different I did was I didn't heat the brine. Mixed everything in the big ziploc bag then placed the meat in and mixed to cover the meat; placed the bag in my roasting pan and put in my fridge (have an extra fridge in my basement) I turned the bag once or twice a day for 3 days then cooked as directed. Came out fantastic! Thanks Cathy! This one's a keeper for sure!

This was really, really good.  My German hubby wasn't totally won over by the sweet gravy (although it wasn't bad at all, just sweeter than what you get in Germany...) and when I make it again I will let it marinate for more than 2 days, probably at least 3 would be a good start.  All around though, this was a GREAT recipe, I used eye of the round and it was so tender and yummy. I will definitely be making it again.

Danke!!  This is a great-tasting "authentic" recipe; I knew as soon as I saw the "crushed gingersnaps" that this was going to be great! Served this to dinner guests and they positively raved - Thank you Cathy!

When my mother passed away 3 years ago, she took her secret recipe with her.  I've searched for 3 years for a recipe like hers & this was the first that included pickling spice & gingersnaps.  I made my first sauerbraten using this recipe & it was every bit as good as Mom's...maybe better.  She'd been proud of me & my boyfriend was completely impressed!  Looking forward to making this again, along with the Red Cabbage & Apples.

Cathy refers to a "roast" and mentions it smells good in the oven, yet she cooks the meat on the stovetop?

I adjusted recipe for 1.5# top round with a cooktime of 1.5 hours.  After adding 1 cup marinade to cooking pot, there was only 3/4 cup remaining for the sauce.  (Maybe b/c meat was marinated in a vacuum sealed container; soaked a lot of liquid into the meat?)  Simmered for 1.5 hours, then it was on 'warm' for 2 hours (delayed dinner).  I thought meat would've become tough, but it was very tender and flaked apart.  Has a very nice/smooth tartness which's complimented by the gingersnap sauce.  Delicious.

This recipe was just perfect. I first tried Sauerbraten at a traditional German restaurant, and this recipe was as good if not better than the fine dining version.

One of the BEST recipes I have used. Great directions, and I used a better cut of meat (because of preference), then served it for New Year's Eve dinner. This is already one of my favorites.

Amazing!  I made a couple changes that people might find helpful. 1) I marinated for 24 hours, not two days, and it was still delicious and tender! 2) I baked it in the oven, covered, for 2 1/2 hours at 250, turned off the stove for the last 1/2 hour, then let it rest about 1/2 hour (covered on the counter). 3)I sliced it up and let it soak up the gravy a little before serving it. My family couldn't stop raving about. Total Success!!

I'm not sure if anyone will read this who is able to make a change in the instructions, but it REALLY messed me up that there was no mention at the top, under "prep time", that the darn thing has to brine for TWO DAYS!!! I'd planned an authentic German meal for my brother who was here for the weekend, and it was soooo disappointing not to be able to make sauerbraten....I ended up using the roast with a different recipe. I can't believe that I'm the only one this has happened to. I made the dish later on and it was fantastic, but I want to make sure others don't go thru the experience that I had the first time.

I have never had this before and I wasn't at all fond of the taste which I guess depends on what you are accustomed to, but I will also say I cooked as directed and this turned out to be the dryest piece of meat I had ever cooked.

This is fantastic. I am not a talented cook but I think this is going to be a popular recipe in my home. I used a little less sugar 1/4 cup. The last thing I need is more sugar on my keister. I found some pickling spices and think this is what gives this recipe a kick.  I also was able to cook this in less time by using my convection feature which may have added to the juicy taste. Thanks.

My family loved this recipe - even better than our local & popular German restaurant.  I used some elk that my husband brought home from a hunt - it was tender and delicious!  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This was fantastic.  I made it today and served it with MARBALET's recipe for German Spaetzle and ChristyJ's recipe for Red Cabbage and Apples.  Made with a larger roast cause I was serving a lot of people.  Roast was fork tender and perfect.  Gravy was great also.  Had to make more with leftover marinade and a beef boullion cube and gingersnaps cause we had lots of gravy eaters.  Fantastic german meal.

This sauerbraten melts in your mouth! Its every bit as good as the sauerbraten I ate when I was in Germany. However, the gravy is WAY too sweet. I recommend using corn starch instead of crushed gingersnaps to thicken the gravy.

Great Tasting.  My husband and I were having a discussion about the taste of certain foods and we decided to explore our German heritage in food.  This was my 1st attempt at Sauerbraten and I am delighted!  I used a rump roast and it was fork tender, not too strong on the vinegar flavor & made great sandwiches.  I did not make the gravy as yet.  But I am sure it will be just as delicious.

This recipe is perfect as is; was just like my mom used to make.  The adding of gingersnaps seemed odd (I don't know what my mom used to add to sweeten the gravy) but they both sweetened up and thickened the gravy perfectly!  I served it with red cabbage and potato dumplings. Will definitely make again!

HAAALLELUJAH! BYE-BYE ($6 per bottle) Mrs. Mimmicks!  
This recipe is hands down, the best! Thank you for this wonderful, EASY recipe.  It will be treasured by our family forever.  My dear Aunt Ree would be very proud.  BTW, I forgot to rub meat with the ginger and salt but it didn't need it.  (I will try it someday, however. :)

Thank you Cathy Eland!

I made 150 servings of this for an event and it was fantastic!  I never liked Sauerbraten before I tasted this. The gravy is the key. The gingersnaps make it. I highly recommend this. The one thing that concerned me about this was that they do not chill the brine before pouring it on the roast.  I don't know if that I agree with putting the meat in a hot brine and then chilling it down.

Our family absolutely loved this. I used to cook for a living, and I could tell by the recipe this would be awesome. What I didn't expect was our 2 year old stealing everyone's meat! This didn't last five minutes on the table. Especially good for a very large family.

This recipe is fantastic!!! I have been looking for a recipe that is like my Grandmothers as I remember it. This is as close as it gets. The only things I did differently was I marinaded the meat for three days and I cooked it in a crock pot. It turned out GREAT!!!!!!! I would definitely recommend this to anyone Thanks.

Everything about this recipe came out perfectly except the middle- for some reason it was really tough. Every other part of the roast was flavorful and tender. I followed the recipe exactly but if anyone could give me tips of what I probably did wrong, I'd appreciate it! Other than that, it was amazing. My boyfriend didn't want to say it outright but I'm pretty sure he liked it as much as his mom's!

This is a pain to prepare, but it's so worth it. I make this about 2-3 times a year for about 3 years now. I've lived in Germany and this is just as good, if not better than Sauerbraten I've had there. Everyone ice served it to agrees and practically locks the plate every time without fail. Definitely a keeper

WOW! made if for Dad's 83rd BDay per request.   Did change a few things... used Chuck Roast, cut it up like stew pieces first and browned it.  Didn't use cloves (Dad doesn't like them) and went with 20 ginger snaps.  Used only one cup of vinegar (too lazy to marinade the meat).  The Gravy was  SO DELICIOUS.  I hated Sauer Beef until we made it using this recipe.. .I think it was the Pickling Spices that won me over.... after pressing him, Dad did admit that his Mother used to put a spice bundle in there .  Dad thought we'd mess it up but HE LOVED IT.  VERY VERY GOOD !!!!! Thanks Cathy.
