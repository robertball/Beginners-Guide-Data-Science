Yum. I had regular hash browns in freezer so I used those, baked them up on their own first to get a little crunchy. Has regular plain egg beaters so I added onions, cilantro and red pepper flakes to compensate. I enjoyed this and look forward to the leftovers.. oh I think I used a bit more egg and added fresh cracked pepper

I really loved this recipe!  I actually used the southwest egg beaters and after the cheese, I topped it with green onions chopped and cilantro like the other review suggested.  My friends LOVED this recipe! The entire dish was devoured in under and hour.  Great recipe!

I've made this recipe with some minor variation a few times now due to limited options at the grocery store, and each time comes out magnificent. I've used fresh green and red bell peppers, tomatoes, and jalapeno peppers when I could only find eggs, but was able to get the southwest Egg Beaters on one visit. Each time I made this, I've used more egg or Egg Beaters than recipe calls for, as much as a dozen large whole eggs or a large carton of Egg Beaters. I've tried with mexican mix, cheddar, and lowfat (2%) cheeses as well. I've also used more hashbrowns than called, because we didn't have hashbrown patties at the store that visit. Two of the times I made this, I used the whole bag of Ore Ida Crowns which are like mini tots. Although I find myself having to cook longer due to my variations, all attempts have turned out delicious and a real hit.

This was a nice easy breakfast casserole; I liked the ease of using frozen hash brown patties.  I used real eggs, so I added bell peppers, onions, green chilis, and tomatoes to my eggs (8).  This took a bit longer to bake for me.  Our guests all enjoyed it and I liked that it was easy to throw together (in a camper, even!). THANKS for the recipe!

Everyone loved this casserole, and we aren't really casserole people!  Made it for after Christmas morning and had to make it again this snowy morning. I used one roll of crumbled Jimmy Dean Sage sausage instead of Canadian bacon.  Also used less cheese (cheddar only) - just enough to create a layer, which was probably about 2.5 cups. One Egg Beater package was a bit short of 1 3/4 cups so I added one egg as well. Served with green onion, cilantro, and sour cream on the side.  Delicious!  Cooking time was right on target.

I'm rating 3, but that's me. My husband and daughter liked it and my grandma loved it. For me- only fair. I think it was the egg beaters maybe, as I enjoyed the potato part and the cheese. I followed recipe exactly except my pan only held 7 patties and I used ham instead of Canadian bacon.   I did use the southwestern egg beaters. I see how I could adapt this so I might like it better.

This was great!  I added crumbled bacon to the top the last 15 mins.  However, I will cut out the salt next time.

The hubby declared this a home run. I liked it though was surprised the southwestern egg beaters didn't impart more flavor. Also thought it was really greasy, which is a shame given how healthy the rest of it is. I will try regular shredded potatoes next time instead of the frozen patties. Left out the salt and didn't miss it - the canadian bacon, egg beaters and patties had plenty of sodium already! Used only 1 bag of shredded cheese (2 cups) - thought it was plenty. This could use a little bit of spice, might try pepperjack next time or a few shakes of crushed red pepper, and LOVE the idea of scallions on top! Definitely hearty though!

Thanks so much for this Steve!!  I totally appreciate the healthy version you offer up here.  I followed the recipe mostly, only substituting cooked turkey sausage patties from Sam's Club dotcom crumbled up and scattered across the casserole.  It is cooling on the counter and awaiting cutting and wrapping for freezer storage.  It smells AMAZING!!  I have high hopes it reheats beautifully!

I used 2 cups of eggs instead of substitute eggs and sauteed some peppers and onion to add to it.  I also halved the cheese b/c there was plenty.

Easy and tastes good. I added sauted red peppers, mushrooms and green onions. I also used half the cheese and Canadian bacon and still received lots of compliments on the dish.

I made several changes to this recipe. I added spinach, tomatoes, green peppers (we preferred hot habanero peppers you may not) to the egg mixture. I used sausage instead of canadian bacon. It required 15 minutes longer to cook covered before uncovering. We added salsa, sour cream, and jalapenos as toppings when it had cooled enough to serve. Love it and get tons of compliments on it.

This recipe, in my opinion, is just a basic one to show how to create a basic weekend casserole.  I made it as stated, found it to be plain.  The reason for 4 stars is because I know what the texture should be, I know I can add whatever I want to make it more flavorful.  
I do wish, however, that this website would stop putting pictures of the foods with components obviously not in the recipe...the recipe has nothing in it that should be black

Sorry, we did not like this so much. My husband and I thought there was too much of a potato base to it, maybe if I had crisped the hash browns before assembling it would have been better.  Thank you for the recipe, I love to experiment!

I cannot  give it 5 stars because I altered the receipe.It is a basic recipe to start with or just make as is. I like to have more flavor and I always add more veggies if I can and it works and it does here.
I  do not consider this a  healthy version with 4  cups of cheese. You may as well call this a Cheese Ham Egg  Casserole with that  much cheese..
I  used  an 8x8 metal pan which gives a crispness to the potatoes.
I used 4 c of  hashbrowns and put them in the oven in the oiled  pan for 13 min while i was assembling everything else. This helps them to get a crispy bottom and not be so soggy. I sauted half of an onion, 1 cup of zucchini( because i had it),and a 5 oz clam shell of PCO spinach until just wilted. I beat 6 eggs with a 1/4 c of m ilk added  some seasonings .
I didn't have Canadian bacon but i had some black forest ham which i cut up in pcs.
A layer of hash browns on the bottom,sprinkle some onion and garlic powder lightly over them ,then a layer of ham pcs with a tbsp of dijon mustard spread over,  the  1/4 cup of monterey jack cheese, then the layers of spinach,onion,zucchini . Poured over the beaten eggs  mixture ,sprinkled some hot paprika  ,covered in foil, baked 25 min ,then removed the foil and sprinkled a 1/4 c of cheddar on top for another 15 min. Let rest 15 min on stove top.
It was delicious and as  healthy as that type of dish can be  and only 1/2 c of cheese total.

Made w/ frozen shredded potatoes in 6x8” pan, microwaved to thaw. Put on a layer of Canadian bacon and a layer of cheese blend (3/4 c?). Used 3 large eggs in measuring cup adding enough milk for 1c total adding about ½ tsp each: salt, pepper, onion powder, dried thyme, dried basil. Grated a hard cheese (1/4c?) and added a bit of fresh ground pepper that I put on when removing foil. All liked, but hubby would prefer crispier hash browns so I'll use patties, pre-cook, or cook longer next time.

Not only is this delish but the suggestion of dividing into serving sizes to freeze is very good. To spice up a bit the 2nd time I made it I added 1/2# chorizo that I brown first with onions (rather than bacon. ) I also added a small can of mild green chiles but no bell peppers.  A more classic southwest version.

I agree with the reviewer who said  Pictures (original), should match Recipe (original). There are no ingredients in the list that should make the picture look like it does. Odd that one person who made it had the identical picture when none of the others look like it.  Yes I understand people alter the recipe,  ovens/cameras vary, etc. But this image clearly looks as if there is cilantro, spinach or black (her view). I can understand the frustration in trying to match the recipe exactly&find that it does not look much like the picture. It isn't the plating. One would want it to look as the picture does to be sure they'd finished, mixed, prepared, etc.,  correctly. This could be especially true for "beginners", i.e. "y doesn't mine look like that?  What did I do wrong?" Anyway,  I swapped out egg beater with real eggs, fresh veggies, real potatoes, etc. I eat clean, whole and organic.  Took me quite awhile but well worth the many breakfasts I will have. I too had to add spices to dress up the eggs.  I can believe those reviewers who found the egg beater to be bland. Eggs are excellent protein and new health data can explain that healthier doesn't mean you cannot consume eggs and that cholesterol isn't as big a deal as it once was and that having some egg and or cheese is not a death sentence! Even if you've had heart issues.

Really good, will make again. Too salty, will omit the added salt. Also need to better prepare the dish; cleanup was a little difficult. Thanks for a keeper. (Have made several times; love the taste. Family likes it. BUT. I cannot clean the glass dish; have tried spray as well as shortening to grease it. Next time: metal pan lined with foil!) Also will put some cheese between the meat and the hashbrowns next time.

I used regular hash browns, maybe that's why it took me so many eggs, I ended up using 16. Plus 2 cups of half and half. I added tomato and onion.  It turned out great.

I do love this recipe, but I only give it 3 stars. In my opinion, the cubed ham is so much easier to work with when trying to cut through since Canadian Bacon can be tough.  So as a recipe, yes, it's good but I'd stick with the cubed ham for ease of making and easier to cut into servings.

This was tasty and easy.  I substituted breakfast sausage instead of the Canadian bacon and used real eggs as my family prefers real eggs (if I was making for myself I would have used the substitute).  This was good for my daughter-in-law who is trying to go gluten-free and the hash browns were a good substitute for bread that is in my usual breakfast casserole dish.

I used regular eggs (about 8-9) instead of egg beaters. I would definitely make it again- was delicious!

My family loved this but I made major changes to the recipe. First, instead of hashbrown patties, I just used hashbrowns instead and layered a baking dish with those. So much easier! I did not use an egg substitute because we love real eggs! However, it took about 8 eggs mixed with water to get it good. Everything else I kept the same.

I wanted to try it because the spinach was appealing in the picture.  There is no spinach in the recipe, although I will add my own.

You can’t go wrong with this recipe, even with little changes and substitutions. I used a bag of hash browns (fresh in the fridge section). I heated olive oil in the pant and baked them for about 10 min before adding the remaining ingredients. We like protein in my house so I used 10 eggs and just a half-cup of milk. Added cheese after 50 min. And it browned and was finished in an hour and 5 min. for me. Excellent—we will do this again!

Wonderful recipe!  I substituted Canadian bacon for a pound of sausage. Added mushrooms, shredded zucchini, red/green pepper. 8 eggs and 1 cup milk and 2 1/2 cups cheddar cheese. Everyone loved it. I planned to serve same day but ended up serving it the next day. Let sit out maybe 10 minutes before cooking 1.15 hours at 350-360 degrees. I covered first 35 minutes, then uncovered. I will make this again!  A lot!

Very good and easy recipe.  I did make some changes.  I didn't use hash brown patties, but used frozen shredded hash browns instead.  I also increased the number of eggs I used to one dozen (I used real eggs, not Egg Beaters).  I reduced the cheese by half to 2 cups, and used 2% sharp cheddar.  I sauteed some onions, mushrooms, and a red bell pepper and added those.  I put everything in one big bowl, mixed it together, and poured it in the pan.  The baking time was spot on.   Tasty and filling--one piece is enough to fill you up.

A delicious breakfast (or even an evening meal) for all.
I actually used veggie "sausage" patties and no one knew the difference.  Easy to put together.

This is very delicious casserole.   I took the advice of some other reviewers:  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, black pepper, and cilantro (I just like cilantro).    I also added about a 1/2 tablespoon dried onions.   I only had one package of Canadian bacon so I added some deli ham that I had on hand.  Lastly, I made it the night before.  In the morning, I took it out of the refrigerator for an hour before baking as instructed.     Note:  it may seem like there isn't enough liquid ingredients, but there is.

This goes together quickly but keep in mind it takes 1hr and 15min to bake!  Takes 8 large eggs to equal the 1 1/2 cup of egg whites.  I use diced ham.  It's also good with a combo of half cheddar/half mozzarella. I tried freezing individual portions.  The hash browns tasted more like mashed potatoes but the flavor was fine.

Awesome! I read some reviews for additions - I love to incorporate veggies into my eggs, so I also added ... chopped scallions & mushrooms, and cilantro, as well as bacon bits into the egg mixture. I went with 2 1/2 cups of cheese and 1/8 tsp of salt (dietary limits), and I combined the remaining carton of egg with the milk (so less milk).

I haven't made it yet but I know I will because it looks delicious! I had to write a review in response to rosehill. Her comment about microwaving is a myth. Contrary to leaching out all nutrients, microwaving is the best way to cook or reheat food without losing the nutrients!
