Delicious - perfect for a quick and easy lunch! I used a combination of baby spinach leaves and romaine lettuce. I also used a combination of Granny Smith and Red Delicious apples for added color and flavor. I toasted my walnuts before tossing them into the salad and used "Maple-Balsamic Vinaigrette" from this site. Overall, very good.

This was very good a nice change of pace.  Since I'm low carb, I made raspberry vinaigrette to use instead of the maple syrup.  The apples and spinach worked very well together.  The walnuts added a nice crunch also.  I think I'll use a different cheese than cheddar next time.  I like goat cheese or Feta in salads.

I am not a salad person, but I LOVE this salad!  You might try serving the cheese, nuts, and apples on the side, because they all fall to the bottom of the serving bowl.

Thought this salad was rather bland and didn't much care for the dressing.  I liked the idea of blending spinach with apples...next time I might try pears instead, add red onion and use a raspberry vinaigrette in place of the maple/cider vinegar/olive oil concoction.

An interesting flavor combination.. very tasty and tangy! I used Red Delicious apples and shredded cheese because it's what I had on hand. I think I may omit the cheese next time because I don't think it's necessary and just adds fat and calories. A great way to get spinach in your diet.. along with Jerry Lynne's Spinach and Strawberry Salad from this site.

When I do not have spinach I will use romaine which works just as well.  I have added thinly sliced red onion and some crumbled bacon for a touch of saltly flavor.  The dressing is so easy!

Very nice combination of flavors.  I contributed this salad to Christmas Eve dinner, and the adults seemed to really like it.  I will make this again.  However, despite the almost "caramel apple-y" flavor, the kids seemed a little put off by the spinach.

This was really good- quick (gotta love that) and tasty. The dressing is a nice balance of flavors yet simple. I used less oil (a little over 1/8c) and it was great. Also used shredded cheese because I had some on hand and chopped rather than sliced my Cameo apple(not GS- a good fresh Cameo is the BEST) and completely forgot the walnuts. It was all good anyhow :) Could play w/ salad ingredients and still have it be tasty. A fast, nice change to encourge our spinach usage. We will be enjoying this again and again as is and w/ variations. Thanks for sharing your recipe Caramommy.

This salad is delicious!  I made it for a potluck dinner, and it was a big hit, especially with me.  I went home and made another batch of the dressing, and I have been eating this salad (without the cheese-I just lost 12 pounds, and would like to keep it off)at least three days a week since.  The dressing is just great-different-not too tangy, not too sweet.  I just love it!

This was quite a nice salad - not awesome, but very good. I don't think I'd ever even heard of maple syrup being used in a salad dressing, but it worked nicely here. I made the recipe exactly as written. The only change I might make, if/when I make this again, would be to go ahead and chop the apples instead of using slices in the salad. This lasted me for 3 fairly big salad lunches (a little soggy at the end, but that's no surprise). Thanks for a simple yet very tasty salad idea.

I liked this salad.  I don't care for maple syrup in dressing, so I used honey instead.  I also added some dijon mustard (about 1 Tbsp.) and fresh ground pepper to the dressing.  The cheese, apples and walnuts go naturally together and my updates to the dressing pulled it all together!

I loved the combo of cheddar cheese and apple with the spinach.  I used an extra sharp cheese for extra flavor. The dressing sounded a bit bland to me, so I used a bottle Sweet Vidalia dressing instead. DH loved it.

The dressing was delish!  Everything was great in this salad, except we used shredded  cheese and it wasn't noticeable.  No need to add fat when there's no flavor!  Will try with dried cranberries instead.

I really enjoy this salad--healthy and tasty.  However, I think there is way too much dressing for the amount of salad, and the maple syrup doesn't mix well.  So, I cut each dressing ingredient to 1/8 cup and microwaved the syrup for 10-15 seconds before whipping it together.  Much better!  You can use any type of apple and most hard cheeses, too, and it's equally yummy.

The only reason I gave this four starts as that the dressing was a  bit bland. I added a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of dijon mustard and this took it up to a personal five stars for me. Everyone loved it! Who would think of using maple syrup but trust me it works! I also toasted the walnuts in a skillet and diced the apples. Great combination of flavors. Made a nice fall salad!

Nice side dish, healthy, quick and easy.  Would decrease the cider vinegar next time, a bit "potent" as it is now.

This was easy and nutritious -- I used pecans and a good quality blue cheese because they were what I had on hand. The dressing was so easy and good.  Passing this on to my daughters!

What a wonderful salad!!  I served it to company and there wasn't a spinach leaf left!  Although excellent as is, the addition of dried cranberries and the substitution of feta for the cheddar would be great, too.  Aside from the taste, this salad is SO easy to make!  I put the dressing together a couple of hours before we ate (and could have mixed it even a day ahead).  Rather than whisking it, I put the ingredients in a small container with a tight lid and just shook before pouring over the salad.  This is a pretty and delicious salad that is well-suited for winter, although I wouldn't hesitate to make it all year round.

This is awesome!  So simple, delicious, healthy and not expensive to make.  I did as others suggested and added a tablespoon of Dijon mustard and a little salt to the dressing and diced the apple.  Otherwise, made as written. Great!

This was amazing. I added a little extra maple syrup by mistake (1/3 instead of 1/4 cup), and that may be why I didn't have any problems with the dressing like some other commenters had. It was such an amazing dressing! And it went very well with the salad. Altogether, easy and quick. Yummy :)

I didn't make the salad but I made the dressing when I was in a pinch. Quick, easy, and mildly flavored.

Awesome!  I love the unique flavors in this salad.  I've been making the spinach strawberry salad for a few years and this was a lovely change.  I diced the apples into bite sized pieces so the eater doesn't have to cut them up.  It doesn't look as pretty, but it's much easier to eat.  I agree with the other reviewer that the apples and walnuts fall to the bottom so maybe toss the dressing with the spinach and cheese (if you are using shredded), then distribute the apples and walnuts evenly through the salad.

This is wonderful!  I made it with both toasted cashews and unsalted roasted peanuts and it was great both ways!  The dressing is great, and I may make it again with a little ginger added.

Thanks for a great way to use baby spinach!
