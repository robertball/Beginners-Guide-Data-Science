I love this recipe, and I had been searching for a good French toast recipe for a while.  This one is the winner of all those I've tried.  We used Texas Toast type bread and it came out delicious.  A few notes: You must mix/whisk the egg mixture before dipping new bread in the mixture, because the cinnamon rises to the top and will disappear with your first few slices made if you don't kep mixing as you go.  Also, I find that Butter Flavor Crisco works well for frying these; it produces an even golden appearance and when new butter is added to the hot pan as you make successive pieces, it does not burn/get dark like butter or margarine can.  (I also use Butter Crisco to make grilled cheese.  Sounds weird, maybe, but tastes and looks great.)  I also added a little nutmeg to the mixture the second time I made this.  The leftover French toast can be stored in the fridge or freezer and reheats well (nice and crispy on the outside) in the toaster.

This recipe is wonderful.  I made French Toast with this recipe and froze it with wax paper between each slice and it made really quick and easy breakfast for my teenagers, they just tossed them in the microwave and they were as good as freshly made.

The milk mixture does need to be stirred up frequently because the flour does tend to settle on the bottom of the bowl.

This is the only way I'll make my french toast.  It tastes like a restaurant's.  The flour is the secret.  Instead of adding cinnamon to the batter, I dip the bread, flip, sprinkle with cinnamon, put on the griddle (cinnamon side down), and sprinkle on the other side.  I love it with cinnamon.

Wow, LOVED this recipe!  In reading a LOT of reviews last night, the common theme seemed to be to double the vanilla and the cinnamon so I did, and I also took another reviewer's suggestion and added a Tablespoon of brown sugar, along with the Tablespoon of white sugar.  The results were PERFECT!!  Just got done eating some for breakfast this morning and had to post a review right away, so good!!!  UPDATE (5/30/12):  This recipe is now a FAMILY FAVORITE!  I use Texas Toast and found that if you triple this recipe, it will make 2 loaves (30 slices) total.  I make it this way and then freeze all the slices that don't get eaten at breakfast... would you believe that these taste even BETTER after they've been frozen??  I just pop them in the toaster until they are heated through and they are PERFECT!  A great tasty homemade quick breakfast... these are now a staple in our freezer!  My kids love to eat these as french toast sticks.  After I reheat them, I cut them into 4 or 5 strips and then they dip them in maple syrup.  UPDATE (12/19/13):  Just when I didn't think this recipe could get any better, I used Kirkland (Costco) brand Cinnamon bread... AMAZING!!!

Delicious!  Every french toast recipe I've ever used turned out soggy, but not this one.  I added more cinnamon (1 1/2 tsp total) and an extra tsp. of vanilla.  I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  This will be a staple in out house!

This recipe got rave reviews from everyone (including my best friend's little 2 year old :-P). The flavor and texture were perfect. I had day old Challah on hand which I was thrilled about, because that's the secret to making perfect French toast. Next time you make these, definitely use Challah and not just any old bread. That's how the restaurants get it so perfect, and that's the secret to making it like they do. Also, let it soak up all the liquid... the more liquid it soaks up, the better it tastes. I'll certainly be making these again!

Great recipe for french toast!  I never thought flour would make a difference - but it thickens up the egg mixture nicely.  I doubled the vanilla and added some nutmeg.  It turned out nice and crispy.  I served it topped with powdered sugar, butter and a healthy dose of maple syrup.  Just what my husband needed after shoveling a ton of snow!

OMG! I love french toast and thought that my recipe was great until I tried this one. The addition of flour made me curious to try it and I'm glad that I did. It really made a difference. In my opinion this recipe is way better than the restaurants. I pretty much followed the instructions although I eye balled the measurement of the ingredients and omitted the salt. The toast turned out golden brown on the outside, moist and fluffy on the inside...As others mentioned you have to let your bread soak briefly in the mixture to absorb some of the liquid flavor. DON'T just dunk and take out immediately. To avoid soggy toast do not cook too fast on high heat. Cook on medium heat until golden brown on each side...After the toast are done I usually sift powered sugar on top and serve with warm syrup. The presentation just looks pretty.

The taste was pretty average... I still prefer my usual method/recipe over this. However, I was impressed with the fact that this does come out very fluffy!

This was very very good. The toast was not too soggy, just right. I also tried adding some mashed banana to the second half of what I made and it was perfect as well. :) Enjoy this one.

This was good, but not the greatest french toast I've ever had. It appealed to me because many reviewers said it was not soggy, but I found it a little too dry. Perhaps because I used a denser bread (challah bread) with pretty thick slices? Overall good taste, it just didn't wow me.

I have been making French Toast like this for 30 years. The only thing I do different is to add a pinch of baking powder to really fluff it up. I also use more nutmeg then cinnamon, but that is just our preference.

Perfect French toast and so easy to customize to one's own family preferences.  For a little more "oomph", I occasionally add Grand Marnier and use a thick raisin bread...  As other reviewers have noted, you need to stir the egg mixture from time to time as the cinnamon and flour settle to the bottom and let the toast soak up the egg so the full flavor comes through.  HELPFUL HINTS:  Try serving this with a scoop of warmed apple pie filling spooned on top or add a caramel glaze (1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup cream, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla on a slow boil for 4 minutes) or Isybel's "Blueberry Sauce" from this site.  All are equally as good and wonderful with this French toast recipe.  Enjoy!

I love this recipe - easy and tasty.  My family loved it too.  I was craving banana french toast so I made this recipe and then fried the bananas/warmed them up a bit in the butter I was using to cook the french toast.  I placed 1 slice of french toast on plate, then added bananas on top, then put a second slice on top, cut sandwich in 1/2 and then served with syrup and powdered sugar.  Delicious!  Thanks for this recipe!

This turned out great for our crowd.  I did have 3 extra egg yolks from the cake I baked the night before, so I added those and some half and half to use up the ingredients.  Thanks! We did a whole loaf french bread.

The flour didn't make it fluffy, it just made it tough on the outside.  My usual recipe and method makes truly fluffy and crispy french toast (1 cup milk, 6 eggs, 1 tblsp orange juice - fry the toast in 1/4 inch hot oil until golden brown).  A tip for getting the cinnamon mixed in: whisk it and the sugar into the flour before adding the milk.

I've been making this french toast for years, and this recipe is the best, I think because of the flour. What I do is buy a pkg of Rhodes dough for rolls, thaw out 12 of them, cut them into quarters, roll in cinnamon sugar and drop them into a greased loaf pan. I let that rise until it comes to the top of the loaf pan and then bake it according to pkg directions. I do this the day before so it has time to harden up a bit. I slice it thick and it usually gives me about 8 slices. One note...if you do your bread a couple slices at a time, you do need to whisk each time before you soak new bread, because the flour falls to the bottom. Also, I like to soak the bread slices that I'll be cooking next, and then let them rest on a plate. It comes out better.

Another reviewer noted that the search for the perfect recipe never ends but I'm pretty sure that flour will be an integral part of our base recipe from now on. We used a ciabatta loaf cut 1/2" thick and it was just fine. Thanks for the great tip.

First, this recipe needs to be doubled in order to make more than 8+ slices of thick French toast. Also, it is a bit bland for my taste-I prefer a sweeter custard. So, here are my changes: 2-1/2 c 2% milk, 5 eggs & 3 egg whites, 1/3 c fine granulated sugar, 1/2 c complete pancake mix, 2 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon (+ more to sprinkle on as needed) and 1 tsp. nutmeg. I whisked everything together then put in the refrigerator over night. I used a very crusty, thick Greek white bread: dipped each side in custard for 30 seconds, let sit on a wire rack for 2 minutes then cooked on a griddle until light brown. Finally, I finished them off by baking in a 375 degree preheated oven for 5-6 minutes. So, overall this was an easy basic recipe to start with and modify to taste.

I am still in the process of eating and oh my god this is sooooo good!!!!  first time in my life that i've made french toast and my boyfriend (whose mom is an amazing cook) said that this is the best he has ever had!  used 1 inch thick texas toast and let it soak... i think what prevented the sogginess was that i really did cook it on medium heat (as per the recipe) so there was time for the toast to cook through before getting too crisp.  it came out fluffier than an omlet and absolutely delish!!!  if you want the best sunday breakfast - this is it!  thank you bonnie!! :O) (by the way.. i used up every drip of batter on 5 pieces of toast, soaking and using thick bread will use up a lot more :O)

This did make for fluffier french toast, but I like mine sweeter, so next time I will be doubling the sugar.  Here is my handy tip for making the absolutely fluffiest french toast.  Cook your french toast in a skillet with a lid.  After dropping the french toast in the skillet, cover with the lid for a couple of minutes until the first side is brown. Uncover to flip.  Then recover to cook the remaining side.  This turns your frying pan into a mini "oven", so the french toast essentially "bakes" in the pan.  If you don't have a skillet with a cover, make it on your griddle, and cover it with a metal bowl.  This will have a similar effect.

It was okay. I prefer a simple egg/milk mixture and throw it on the griddle.

My mother made a similar recipe that has now been handed down to my grandchildren. We use equal parts of flour and milk...  then it fries up with a great crust all over it.  Everyone loves it.

Very, very good French toast. I followed the recipe exactly (well maybe I added a tiny tad extra vanilla and cinnamon) except I used regular white bread rather than any especially thick stuff. The flavor is not mind-blowingly different than the taste of my usual recipe, however this is much less soggy and you don't get those weird streaks of thick egg on certain pieces. This toast is more consistently attractive and less mushy than other recipes due to the flour.

Like many other reviewers I added extra cinnamon. My French toast ended up being a bit soggy after cooking in a pan, so I placed them on a cookie sheet and threw them in the oven on low heat for a few minutes. It turned out wonderfully!

Fantastic!  It is imperative that you whisk together the dry ingredients first, then add the wet ingredients and blend with the whisk.  No flour separation or lumps that way.

This made yummy french toast. I usually never use a recipe for making this breakfast dish, but I read the reviews and decided to try it since I wanted "restaurant-style" FT. I followed the recipe as written, though I did use a little less sugar than called for, and I did add some orange extract (can also use zest) for some extra oomph. Overall, it came out very tasty, though I would make it again with some minor modifications to indulge my personal FT preferences. 

I took a reviewer's recommendation and fried the FT in butter-flavored Crisco, which, as she mentioned did not burn when I added more to the griddle (huge plus!!) and made the slices fry up picture-perfect. However,  I did miss the real butter flavor (and smell) that comes from frying in deliciously decadent butter. :-) 

Next time I make it, I will 1) use real butter; 2) sprinkle extra cinnamon on each slice just before frying (as noted by another reviewer, cinnamon in batter tends to sink toward bottom); and 3) use an extra egg and reduce milk to 3/4 cup. I prefer my FT batter more egg-y than this recipe turned out to be. 

Note: this recipe, as written, yielded enough batter for six, well-soaked pieces of Arnold Whole Grain White bread.

This was tasty, but no tastier than the regular recipe that I use (I guess which is basically the same, with the exemption of the flour & sugar).  Texas toast is the way to go as it is nice & thick.  Don't forget the sprinkled powdered sugar on top!  Thanks Bonnie ;)

This is a fantastic recipe.  My friends and I eat this Sunday mornings when we get together.  It is best with Texas Toast Bread.  We've tried with regular bread, fresh baked bakery bread and Texas Toast tastes the best.  My husband prefers it w/o the vanilla so we alternate it.  Sometimes with vanilla sometimes w/o.  I also add scant 1/8 C sugar scant 1/8 C brown sugar

My father-in-law, who insists he makes the best french toast with his "secret" ingredients, gave up his fight when I made this version of french toast.  My family enjoyed it both with powdered sugar on top and fried apples.  Get creative!

This was good, but it doesn't make twelve slices. I doubled the recipe and that did it. I also sprinkled powdered sugar and freshly ground cinnamon on top while they were cooking. I will keep this recipe.

I wanted to try this recipe to see if the flour made the French Toast more crisp.  Truthfully, since I was making a smaller amount, I just estimated the amount of ingredients.  In any event, both my husband, who is our usual French Toast maker, and I thought this was a good recipe.  The toast was definitely more crisp than when my husband makes it, but it may be because I had more patience and fried it longer.  It was a good Sunday morning treat.

Not too bad.  My husband loved it... thought it was very tasty & fluffy.  I found it be quite dense even though I used regular (thick) sliced bread.  Personally, I found the cinnamon overpowered the rest of the ingredients.  Next time I think I would cut out the cinnamon completely.

I used 1/2 c. flour, two eggs instead of 3 (I like mine less eggy) and left out the salt. Pretty good.  I do like the sweeter flavor and the cinnamon and vanilla in this recipe.  I don't think I soaked my bread quite long enough (it was fairly thick), but it was still tasty.

It was good, but not much different from the way I normally make it.  I did have a problem getting the cinnamon to mix; the first few pieces had all the cinnamon.  I used regular white/wheat bread and that might have been the reason it didn't seem any fluffier than normal french toast.  I agree with an earlier review that it's not worth the extra fat and calories you get by adding the flour and sugar.

I have always made fench toast this way (minus the flour).  Tried it with flour and no one could tell the difference between my "regular" french toast and the new recipe...I didn't find it any fluffier.  However, I love the taste of cinnamon and vanilla in french toast...it's still a good recipe.

This French toast is fantastic!  I double the batch, then when everyone in the family has eaten their fill, I put what's left on cooling racks and freeze.  After about an hour, I transfer these to a Ziploc freezer bag.  They defrost really well in the microwave.

Sometimes things may only be "good" without you knowing how to improve it.  Think of a $5 lunch you enjoy at a restaurant.  It was good - not great - but you certainly don't mind paying $5 for it.....but then the price is raised to $10, then $15 and you don't want to pay for it anymore.  This recipe was delicious and I enjoyed it.  It's a 4.

This is probably the best recipe I've used for French toast on this site. The flour is a must. I butter the bread before dipping it in the mixture. I use a nonstick skillet and cover it for 3 minutes on each side and it's golden.

Thanks for sharing this recipe. I didn't like the taste of these, but after adding more cinnamon and sugar to the mixture, my friend praised me upon taking a big mouthful of this french toast. I guess it all just depends on your taste.

This is my favorite recipe for French toast, because it doesn't produce a lot of waste, and because personally I think it tastes better than the recipes that have more eggs and no flour. It's less soggy because a lot of the liquid sticks to the flour, and so it stays on the outside and cooks up, rather than soaking in and becoming a wet mess. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Just made this french toast this morning. I could not believe the difference flour makes! They were the best ever. I added the cinnamon to the bread when in the pan and didnt use any sugar. Topped with maple syrup. Was sweet enough.So glad I found this recipe, Thanks

Perfect every time! Highly recommend. To avoid any clumps in your batter, add all the flour and a quarter cup of milk, mix to create a paste, then add the rest of the milk, makes it perfect!!!!!

For everyone who does not like this recipe here are a few hints to make it better. First no matter what kind of bread you use it will work better if it is stale or left out over night, if you dont have stale bread put it in the oven on the lowest heat for a couple minutes before it turns brown. Second  MAKE SURE YOU ADD THE MILK AFTER THE FLOUR AND POUR SLOW THEN WISK, POUR SLOW THEN WISK, UNTIL YOU HAVE NO MORE MILK LEFT this will keep it from looking like cottage cheese. Third to avoid it getting super soggy it is best to cook on a low/medium heat (stove) or 300 on a griddle and do not rush, only flip it one time. Hope this helps.

I guess it is the flour but these are awesome - everyone loves them and it is the only way I make french toast now.  I don't change a thing and it is great every time.

This was a very simple and yummy recipe!! The only two changes I made were to substitute the white sugar for brown and add some extra. Most of my siblings really enjoyed this. Thanks for sharing!!

We had "bfast for dinner" tonight, and kids and hubby loved it! Never thought about the flour before, but it adds a "lightness" to the batter. This only made 8 "Texas Toast" size pieces, so I'll double it next time and freeze the leftovers for a quick breakfast.

I love this French toast recipe! I use my homemade vanilla extract and vanilla sugar and it turns out great. I generally halve this recipe...sort of. I use 1/2 ish cup milk, 2 eggs, 1/8 cup flour and the full amounts of the other ingredients. It makes about 8 slices of french toast.

Pretty good.  I like my french toast soaked though, not just coated.  So if you like them like that also, this recipe will work for about 6-7 regular slices of bread.

Good recipe w/addition of flour.  I add an egg or two, double the vanilla and cut back on milk to keep it rich in custard-like flavor.  Instead of adding spices to the batter,  I sprinkle the cinnamon & nutmeg over slices as they cook on griddle.  More even distribution this way.  I generally use sour dough bread "extra" sour if available.  Thanks!!!

I experimented with this recipe using plain white bread and it turned out well even though my boyfriend wasn't impressed- he felt it tasted no diferent from his which is just plain egg.    BUT since the batter was so much (we only ate 3 slices), I added more milk+brown sugar+cinnamon, cut up a thick herbed Arabian bread-bun and soaked in the batter...it smells wonderful!Soft and spongy with slightly crispy burnt edges. I plan to reheat/grill this later for a snack with some cheddar cheese,oregano and fresh tomatoes.And maybe scrambled eggs and baked beans if I'd like a heavier meal.    Lately my fridge has become too full and I don't know if the batter will keep well.To my delight, I found the recipe for French crepes in this site..virtually the same recipe, just had to tweak it a little- added more flour...and the result was some nice crepes! So just using this base, I've had sweet cinnamon French toast (with peanut butter + strawberry jelly..but better plain) and 1 large crepe (savoury cos I like mine with Bovril)

I had a craving for French toast this morning, and this hit the spot. I increased the egg batter somewhat because I used thick-sliced French bread. I like French toast recipes that use flour in the batter because I think it makes the crust a little crispier. Thank you, Bonnie!

I usually can't stand French toast because it tastes too eggy, but this is lovely. Really nice and adaptable to your own tastes (add your own spices, brown sugar instead of white, etc.).

This recipe is a keeper! We like our French Toast on the "eggy" side so I added one egg. Also, I used thin, whole wheat bread and low-fat cinnamon-raisin rolls cut in half. My husband said it was the best French Toast he ever had. I sprinkled a mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar on the slices as they fried in the pan. What a treat! I think the flour helps avoid the sogginess that often threatens to wreck this dish. Will make again...maybe tomorrow! (;

This was great, but tasted the same as regular french toast, and I didn't notice it to be any fluffier than normal.  Not worth the extra time.  I'll stick to the egg & milk.

I really enjoyed this french toast. I've never added sugar or flour to french toast before and because of the sweetness from the sugar I didn't even need syrup and it tasted great on it's own. Something else I noticed was that the mixture was more evenly mixed then my usual recipe. Normally by the time I get to the last couple of pieces it's just the thick egg whites left behind and the french toast comes out very "eggy" but I didn't get that with this recipe. Everything was so smooth and well blended. I think the flour may have contributed to that. This will be my french toast recipe from now on.

The french toast did not look "fluffy" to me.  It was very tasty and easy to make and my family loved it.  I think the recipe needs to be adjusted.  It made enough to coat 8 slices of bread.  I do not see how one could actually get twelve slices of bread coated unless very small slices of bread are used.  I used Sara Lee sweet buttermilk french bread.

The added flour in this recipe makes for firmer, less soggy french toast.  I will definitely make this again.  Served it with peaches and maple syrup, and yum!

I have made this several times now.  I have made it according to the recipe in the past and do like the addition of flour.  Last night I used almond milk as a new twist and will for sure do it again, it was yummy.

This is the best French toast recipe I've made and my go to recipe. Much better than just eggs and milk. The flour makes the mixture thicker. Thin bread (low calorie) soaks up the liquid really quickly.

I agree with previous reviewers on adding extra cinnamon and stirring frequently.  This is a great breakfast to stretch a buck with teenagers in the house :)

yum! be sure not to soak the bread too long or else your toast will fall apart when you're trying to move it to the pan!
also, medium heat works well. medium-high kinda burns the outside of the toast before cooking the inside.
i made a batch to freeze and eat for the week week! wahoo!

Mushy yuck!  I made this recipe w/ both wheat and white bread and tried just dipping rather than saturating like the recipe called for and still ended up with mushy bread that didn't really taste like french toast just vanilla and cinnamon.
If I could have given this no stars I would have.

Holy cows this was good! I was skeptical about adding flour to the egg/milk mix, but it was amazing how rich it made the french toast. I usually like to use texas toast when making french toast, but this time I only had ordinary sandwich bread in the house and it was great. It fluffed right up and didn't get soggy or gooey in the middle. Yum!

To keep the cinnamon from rising to the surface of the milk, wisk it into the eggs before adding other ingredients.  I used honey in place of white sugar which we don't use, and a bit of nutmeg. Nice fluffy french toast.

Really good recipe :) My little brothers and sisters liked it a lot, I'll definitely make this one again.
The only thing is that you really have to get all of the lumps out or it makes little(or big ;) lumps of flour all over the toast.
just a helpful hint:)

This recipe has the right ratio of eggs to milk but I don't understand the need for flour. I thought the flour created a kind of pasty taste. If the flour has a purpose I think it could be reduced to a Tbs or two since most of it sunk to the bottom of the bowl. I would try this again but use more sugar and a lot less flour.

I followed the recipe exactly but used regular old white bread.  It was crispy on the outside and a soggy mush on the inside.  This definitely needs a thicker, denser bread.  I'm not so sure I will try it again with a better bread because I prefer a much 'eggier" flavor to my french toast.

Very tasty recipe!  I used two types of bread and dipped it into this batter.  One was French baguettes, sliced at ½ inch, and the other was store-bought cinnamon bread.  Word of caution:  Do not let the bread slices saturate too long in the batter.  Otherwise, after frying them, the center of the bread would still be a bit soggy in texture.  The French baguettes were my personal favorite because of the thickness and less dense texture.  I like my French toast to taste more “eggy” so I might want to add an extra egg in the future.

Perfect. I made this with my homemade bread. My kids could not get enough. Even my husband, who thinks french toast is too eggy, ate more than his share.

Only saturate your bread if you like gooey, raw tasting middles. Also, it will only make 7 slices of Texas Toast size bread.  Next time I will do as I always do, dip quick and put in the pan. Hopefully that will be better. I gave it a 4 since my kids really liked it. Taste is good, texture is gross.

Like a lot of other reviewers, I had been searching for a good french toast recipe for a long time. I always found ones that left the french toast soggy or lacking the rich flavor like in the restaurants. I finally found it! Flour is the key. I didnt change a thing! My picky preschoolers LOVED it and thats the best taste test there is in this house! Make sure you wisk the mixture with each bread slice so you get the cinammon coat and also, I added a bit more cinnamon to each side when drying. EXCELLENT!

This was the BEST French toast I've ever made! My only comment is that I saturated the bread (ordinary white bread) just like the recipe said and only got six slices of toast. That was fine since we have a small family but I don't know how this could've made 12 slices of thick bread. I also added 1/4 t nutmeg just because I love it.

I chose to give this recipe a try as many have said the added flour helps to keep the toast light instead of wet and soggy. The texture turned out very light and even a little crispy around the edges. The cinnamon was the perfect amount and the tip to make sure to give the mix a stir every time a new piece is dipped is an important one to keep in mind. I had made some challah bread the day before and found it to work beautifully in this dish. Thanks so much for posting.

This is yummy. I make this with potato bread and let it soak good. It makes a 'poof' sound when I place a piece on the heat. I make it in an electric skillet at 360 degrees with Crisco brushed on the pan. And yes, stir in between. I also sprinkle extra cinnamon on the top side once I put them in the pan.

I've always had a problem with french toast turning out too eggy and mushy for my taste; I guess the flour must be the trick, because this turned out just the way I like it.  I scaled it down to make two pieces for just myself, used wheat bread as that's all I had, and just eyeballed the cinnamon, vanilla and such.  I also added a little nutmeg.  I have no syrup, so I drizzled both pieces with honey, added brown sugar to one and powdered sugar to the other, and ate both with some sliced banana.  Mmmm. Thanks! I'll use this recipe for french toast from now on.

I love this recipe. I made it for two children who are the most picky eaters and they wouldnt put it down and were begging for more. Itr fills you up after one slice and keeps you full for a great amont of time. I added to it because at the end I melted some butter and used a paper towl to dab in on to the french toast than mixed cinniomon and sugur. After that I sprincled the mixture on to the dish and it was perfect. I will use this recipe for years to come!!!!;)

This is a very good and easy french toast recipe!  I used buttermilk because that was all I had and i didn't have any problems with the flour sinking to the bottom.  Next time i will put less vanilla extract and more cinnamon.
UPDATE: I made stuffed french toast with this recipe and it was GREAT--I sandwiched sliced bananas and strawberries between two slices of bread (trim crusts, press edges together) and then dipped into the batter as usual.  My family is still talking about it.

I have a suggestion for those who had trouble getting the cinnamon to mix and with the flour settling, I put the ingredients in the blender and mixed for a few seconds.  Its makes the mixture turn out very smooth, however you do have to add a more cinnamon and sugar to get a flavor with the same intensity.  All the slices will have the same amount of flavor instead of the first few picking up all the cinnamon.

Served this for Sunday breakfast. Real treat. But you have to keep stirring, otherwise flour sinks to the bottom.Thanks, Bonnie. I made this with thick sliced raisin bread.

A Sunday must in my house!  Don't leave the bread in the batter too long otherwise it will come out soggy.  I also put a lid over the pan while it is cooking to help it cook all the way through.  My son and husband can't get enough.  Very Very Yummy!

I had been looking for a good, basic french toast recipe.  This one is it!  I never liked french toast that was dipped only in eggs.  This is a great, delicious, and easy alternative.  A definite keeper!

This was good!  I thought there was a TINY bit too much vanilla, but my husband liked it.  We'll definitely make it again, just with a little less vanilla.  They were definitely fluffy - I've never thought to use flour before!

This was just OK. I split the recipe in half because I was only cooking for myself and my hubby. I think it's a good basic recipe for french toast but there just wasn't enough flavor. Next time I think I'll use this but add more cinnamon, sugar, and maybe some nutmeg or other spices.

I would never have thought to add flour to my French Toast batter but I will from now on. It gives it the most wonderful texture and I think I even converted my 80+ yr. old mother who has been making FT all her life.

So so tasty!  I followed the recipe verbatim and the end result was delicious!  It's just my fiance and me, so I was going to scale back the recipe but i'm glad I didn't...the batter was out after 5 slices (granted, I cut very thick brioche bread slices..).  Even if I'd cut the bread less thick, i can't see it being enough for 12 slices of bread.  Delicious though, thanks so much Bonnie!!  i'll make this again and again!

Now that we've concurred how to make the best waffles, we've been attempting to make the best french toast and I think this is the winner for our base. I doubled the cinnamon because we LOVE it so much and add a splash more vanilla. Fabulous recipe!

Made french toast for my boyfriend's birthday using thick slices of leftover challah bread and he raved over it. Flour is a great addition to french toast I had not thought of. Very simple and delicious recipe.

I adjusted the serving size to four and followed the direction exactly other than I used regular white bread. Even with the whisk, it was lumpy, and once I soaked two pieces of bread (one serving), I was about out of mixture to dip into, so the entire 12 serving recipe would make 3 servings. Once on the non-stick griddle, it stuck and took way longer than usual to cook. After more than 10 minutes on the griddle, it was completely soggy in the middle. The second batch I cooked (with cooking spray) for more than 15 minutes. Completely soggy in the middle. Also VERY BLAND. The cinnamon and sugar need to be doubled, at least.

Awesome. I used cinnamon-raisin bread and topped with syrup and fresh fruit. Egg-mixture was enough to soak 9 slices of bread, with was plenty for us.

I've made this several times now and it has been a success every time.  I also have reduced it for just two of us.  I use a "super bread" which I get at our farmer's market - has raisins, cranberries, walnuts, seeds - and this works great with this.  For three slices, which I cut in half after cooking, i use 1T flour, 1/4 c. milk, scant pinch salt, 1 egg, 1/16 t. cinnamon, 1/4 t. vanilla, 1/4 t. sugar.  Excellent.

Very good! I made 1/3 recipe for just my husband & me - thanks allrecipes.com for the handy calculator. I made the batter in a plastic sandwich type box with a lid, so after all the ingredients are in you can just put the lid on & shake it, then dip the bread right in the same container.

Very nice french toast- not too sweet and nicely spiced. The toast fries up very light and fluffy and the flour in the batter seems to remove any possibility for sogginess. In the end, perfect french toast with a great texture and flavour. I will certainly make this again.

Kids loved it!  This recipe is similar to the one in my Betty Crocker cookbook.  I cook mine on a skillet that is sprayed with cooking spray.  No burnt french toast that way.

This is by far the best recipe I have ever used for french toast. Using flour in the mixture kept it from being soggy, which is something I don't like about french toast. This is my new go-to recipe when Im wanting french toast in the morning!!

This is the best French Toast I've EVER made!  They were absolutely delish!  I tweaked the recipe a bit by adding a little more cinnamon as well as adding nutmeg and ginger.  We also used sugar-free syrup.   
My fiance' loved them and said they were VERY good!  I gave him a sample taste as I was preparing them and he said they didn't even need syrup.  I asked him to describe them and he said they were light, tasty, good texture and perfectly browned.  I asked if he would say they were fluffy and he said they were for sure.  I told him that was great because that was what the recipe was called.  lol  This recipe is a new household favorite.  :D

Really good, much better than the basic milk, eggs, and cinnamon that I used to make!  I did add an extra tsp of cinnamon, an extra tsp of vanilla, an an extra tbs of brown sugar and they turned out amazing!

Batter seemed to be enough for 7 pieces of bread, not 12. Good flavor, would double the vanilla.

It was Good.  Not sure if I like so much flour in it.  Next time I will try only 2 Tablespoons of flour.  Also, Found it easier to add all ingredients to food Processor/Blender to take out all the little lumps of flour. It made it all smooth and perfect for dipping the bread in. Thanks for sharing.

UPDATE:  Cut flour to 2 Tablespoons, Alot better.

Very good! The flour makes a difference, to keep the "soggies" away! (I did use one extra egg, because we like a higher egg to milk ratio)

Fluffy and delicious.  The first time we followed the recipe exactly, it was outstanding.  The second time, we used day Challah bread- unbelievable.  The third time, we used left-over banana bread- my mouth is STILL watering.  Thank you Bonnie for sharing with us.

This was a very good recipe--not too sweet, not to eggy, and quite easy.  I did add extra spices to boost the flavor.  I'm not quite sure if the flour is necessary, but it didn't hurt anything (I was a little worried about "raw flour taste").  I used sourdough bread that was too fresh for french toast (didn't soak up enough batter), but I will try again with white bread.

I used whole wheat bread with this recipe and it made about 10 slices of bread. I love that I can use what we want the first day and then freeze it easily. It is just as good later in the week and we can have a Saturday breakfast on a Tuesday morning! Just microwave the pieces until they are thawed and then put them in the toaster oven until they are a little crispy!
The one change I made was to add more cinnamon because my husband loves cinnamon! You must try this recipe! It's better than my Mom's, which is high praise indeed!

Loved this recipe, i used cinnamon raisin bread instead, skip the ground cinnamon and use 1\2 teaspoon of sugar since the bread is already sweet. They taste delicious, give it a try. Enjoy!!!!!!!

This recipe is a keeper. One thing I recommend is adding the cinnamon to the toast directly otherwise it just sits on the bottom of the bowl.

A well earned 5 stars. It was a good combination of ingredients with the Flour being a key ingredient, as mentioned by a previous reviewer.

I used 3/4 of the recipe (8 servings), according to the calculator on the page, but not everything was divided down to 3/4 of the original quantities/amounts as it actually yielded less mixture for the number of servings.

I followed what the calculator suggested, but I ended up increasing the Flour, Cinnamon, Salt & Vanilla Extract. It should have yielded 8 servings (8 slices), but I only got 5 servings, which was actually just right for me and the wife (we went 50/50). I cooked the toast with Butter. I topped them with Powdered Sugar and 100% Maple Syrup. Thanks to Bonnie for listing her recipe! :^)

Ingredients:
   3 tbsp Flour
2/3 cup Milk
1/4 tsp Salt
   2 Eggs
   1 tbsp ground Cinnamon
   1 tbsp Vanilla Extract
   2 tbsp granulated Sugar
   5 slices of Bread

Optional:
Powdered Sugar
Maple Syrup

I made this this morning and it was the best french toast i have ever had! i found that although it takes a while to cook on med. heat,it is well worth a even golden brown look,and tastes better. also,if you add maple syrup in the batter it tastes great! this recipe I will definitely keep!

Best french toast recipe I have found yet! I tried it with french bread I had left from the night before and also with plain old wheat bread that we always have on hand and they were both delightful.

This french toast was excellent. soft (not mushy) and flavorful. I only changed two things. I added two tablespoons of sugar to the batter (instead of one), and I used day old Texas Toast. By the way, if your toast isn't day old, pop it in the oven on 350 until it is crunchy, but not toasted. All you need is to take the moisture out of the bread. Leaving it out for a day will take out the moisture slowly, but if you forgot or don't have time, just pop it in the oven. 

Thanks Bonnie!

Love the way the flour makes the bread firm. This is the best textured French toast. I like to add a couple more eggs, just to add a little more protein.

This was alright.  It tasted like bread dipped in pancake batter, which, if you want bread-shaped pancakes that is fine.  I think I'll stick with my eggier version.

I have never actually followed a recipe for french toast. I usually just do it from my head. My recipe is the same pretty much, but this one added flour. I changed the servings to 4 and it worked fine. The taste was good as it seemed to keep a little more liquid in the bread, with the flour, so it gave it flavor throughout. And, it gave it a slight crispiness I don't normally get by not adding the flour. The one thing that has to be changed is to generously butter the griddle, because my french toast stuck badly. The flour acted like a glue to the pan until the side was fully cooked. And, I had lightly oiled only as suggested. However, I think I will follow this recipe again because of the extra flavor I noticed.

I won't make french toast any other way ever again. I don't put banana or anything like that on it. I like french toast without all the jazz. Very good.

After trying my hand at French Toast for years, I never could get it just right. It was always too soggy and tasted too much like egg. Who knew the secret would be the flour?! This recipe is as good as any restaurant. Thank you so much. My family thinks it's perfect. :)

This recipe is excellent.  The small addition of flour and sugar really helps the browning, giving it a crisp exterior while the interior nice and light without any sogginess.  The recipe writer has really earned accolades.  Now, to solve the problems noted by some reviewers:  1. The problem of cinnamon settling to the bottom -- yes, the ground cinnamon does clump together, making it sink.  To prevent this, blend the ingredients in a blender, food processor, or with a stick blender.  The cinnamon will distribute more evenly than with a whisk or eggbeater.  If you leave the mixture sitting for any length of time, re-blend before dipping the bread. 2.  Not enough cinnamon flavor -- Mix the batter the night before and refrigerate, the flavors should intensify. Re-blend before using. (see above). Always use fresh cinnamon (not stuff that has been in your kitchen for a year.)  Also double the cinnamon or sprinkle each slice separately. 3.  Sogginess -- If you are getting soggy French Toast with this recipe, it is not the fault of the reipe. Here are a few thing you might do better: a.  Use thick slices of slightly stale or dried bread --  Texas toast style is best.  If the bread is fresh, dry it a bit in a warm oven.  b.  Saturated the bread, do not soak it in the egg mixture. Each side of bread should sit in the egg mixture for a few seconds only.  c.  Use a hot skillet or griddle with about 1/4" hot oil (Crisco is best, but canola is ok).  Replenish oil as needed between slices.

This wasn't bad, but I found it to be absolutely nothing special. My regular recipe (one without flour) is much better and the toast doesn't take so long to get done. For me, these were tricky to get at just the right heat so they get done all the way through but don't burn on the outside.

I really enjoyed this! This was my first time making french toast and I thought this was super-easy and the results were delicious.  I think next time I'll use thicker bread slices, as my bread was close to falling apart after putting it in the mixture.  Thanks for the recipe :)

It really does taste like the restaurants! The only flour I had on hand was white whole wheat and it worked out great. I used a sourdough loaf and cut my slices about an inch thick or so. I did let them soak the batter on each side for a while plus I poked my slices with a fork for better absorption. The only change I made was to double the cinnamon and add in 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. This was so easy to put together, the longest part of it was the cooking. If I was in a hurry I would've cut my slices a bit more thin, it took about 4-5 min on each side with a lid on my pan at med-low heat. You can freeze the leftovers like one cook suggested and use a toaster to reheat but with my thickness I had to choose the Frozen Bagel setting and turn it to #5 on the dial. Something to keep in mind if you're in a hurry in the mornings.   I'm keeping this recipe, definitely doing it again and recommending it to anyone who likes/loves French Toast!!

Slowly mix the flour into the milk making sure it dissoves completely.  And occassionally mix the mixture as the floor sometimes settles.

Good flavor and very easy!  I whisked all of the dry ingredients before adding the wet ones and I did not have any problem with separation.  This is a keeper.

Delicious recipe.  You can also after soaking your bread, spread cornflake crumbs on another plate and coat both sides of your french toast before frying.  Makes a nice crunch.

this did not come out very fluffy but I did use plain old sandwich bread, next time I will try thicker bread and see if it helps. I did think it sounded kinda crazy at first adding flour, but it turns out well.  My family absolutley LOVED it anyway though.  I have had to make it two days in a row now.  Even my 3 year old ate it and he has never like french toast, I think it was because this recipe was not soggy like some others I have tried.  Definately give it a try.

I was in the mood for French Toast this morning and found this recipe.  It was wonderful and has made a permanent home in my recipe box.  I did read the reviews of before I started, and noted that there were some who had issues with the flour.  I substitued "Wondra" flour (made by Gold Medal) for regular flour.  It's very fine texture made it easy to blend with the milk.  I also tripled the use of vanilla and added a tablespoon of Cinnamon.  I used "Texas Toast" for my bread.  It came out super fluffy and to spite some of the other reviews, did NOT come out tasting of flour.  The great thing about this recipe is that you can add a little of this and a little of that and make it your own.  Big Kudos on adding the flour.  It was just enough to make the consistance more batter like, rather than soup like.  Very tasty!

L-o-o-o-v-e this recipe! I like the fact that it uses less eggs than traditional french toast recipes. I add a little more cinnamon to the mixture about halfway through in order to keep the rest of the pieces cinnamon-y, but other than that, don't change a thing!

A wonderful recipe - simple, inexpensive, ingredients that most have on hand, and delicious. I love crispy food and the flour seemed to add a crisp coating to the bread. Thanks so much!

I always struggle with French toast...this recipe was delicious! It got two thumbs up from my 2 year old and 5 year old (who had seconds!). I used wheat bread, and while it still tasted great I would probably use a thicker bread next time.

My family and I were very happy with this recipe.  I also recommend stirring the mixture before adding the bread each time.

My family really loved this.   I make french toast a lot--I didnt tell them it was a new recipe.  They said it was the best I ever made!  I never use bread to make my french toast.  I always use a day old loaf of french bread and slice it up.  It makes a HUGE differece.  You will love it!

This is the best french toast I've ever made!!! Everyone loved it! It had just the right amount of everything, I got so many compliments on it...the only thing is that I only had enough for 6 slices of bread so I had to make more... Next time I would double the recipe to have enough for everyone! thanks!

Great basic FT recipe. I don't think the flour made much difference compared to traditional FT but this recipe was very yummy.  I used half a loaf of challah which worked nicely with this recipe. We kept the leftovers in a zip lock baggie and reheated them in the toaster oven and they were great a few days later. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Unbelieavbly fluffy.Also the french toast did not break up as they usually do with my regular recipe.Also followed a reviwers advice of frying the french toast in crisco and it was definitely wonderful since it prevented the burning,that occurs when i fry with oil or butter.

I loved this recipe, and so did my super-picky fiance.  I used thick slices of white Great Harvest bread, didn't do the vanilla (didn't have it), and soaked each side for approximately 10 seconds.  I also used cooking spray instead of butter, and it was totally fine-couldn't tell a difference.  Be sure and stir the egg mixture well right before soaking or all the flour will settle to the bottom.

It's been a long time since I've had french toast...one of the reasons I don't have it often is because a lot of the recipes make the toast taste too 'eggy' for me.   I like this one because I didn't have to use a lot of eggs plus the flour thickened the batter without having to add extra eggs.   I just mixed all of the dry ingredients together and then whisked in the eggs, vanilla, and milk-the batter still turned out great.   One variation you might want to try is to use sour milk in place of the regular milk..it thickens up the batter a bit and adds a little 'oomph' in my opinion.   Thanks for getting me back to eating french toast again :-)

This French Toast is delicious!!! The Vanilla extract gave it a whole new taste. I used to make mine without the vanilla and flour, and this recipe has forced mine into early retirement.  I made a slight change though, I used butter instead of oil. I just think the butter gives it a different flavor. But overall, butter or oil, its a great recipe that is delicious and so easy to make!

I used texas toast bread to make this and it was delicious. Follow the recipe like it says to add the milk to the flour first. I just dumped everything into the bowl and read the instructions afterwards and ended up with little flour lumps....still tasty though.

I always rate the recipes by how my kids like it. They complained about not getting pancakes and when they ate this French Toast their eyes lit up like a Christmas tree! The only problem I have is with the directions; don't "saturate" the bread or there won't be enough!

I made this recipe and added a little bit of my own touch and it was PERFECT! Try adding 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and 1 Tbls of honey. You won't regret it! Also the best bread I use and I've found in almost every grocery store is Sara Lees new Artesano bread! It's the perfect thickness!

This is my go to recipe for french toast.  I get raves every time I make it.  My kid requested pumpkin pie french toast one morning so I used this recipe as a base and added 1/8 t. nutmeg, 1/8 t. cloves, and 1/4 t. ginger, substituted the sugar with 2 T. brown sugar and used 3/4 c. milk and 1/4 cup pumpkin puree and it worked out magically.  Just make sure to cook the bread on medium heat, if you cook it too fast, the outside will brown quickly without cooking the inside.  They are little pillows of perfection.

A little hint to incorporate the cinnamon. Put vanilla extract in the bowl first, then add the cinnamon and stir together. Now incorporate eggs,suger,milk,salt,and flour until smooth

I tried this recipe, but it did not say how long to cook it. I cooked it on medium and it was brown on both sides, but still raw in the middle, even on the corners. If I make it again, I will add more salt and cook it on low until well done.

"Marvelous! Sedap.. Sedap... (delicious)" my 4 yo pancake lover would say with his thumbs up. I followed the recipe to the T and it turned out fluffy, crispy on the outside & not soggy at all. After reading others reviews, i've double up the cinnamon, vanilla & add a teaspoon of brown sugar. Yummy... with more intense flavour this time. I just gobbled it up as it is

Finally, something my 2 year old will eat!  This recipe is great.  I omitted the sugar, as I saw it as unnecessary since we were eating this with maple syrup.  I mixed the cinnamon with the flour so that the cinnamon won't float on the surface of the milk mixture.  Loved the final result!

Normally I make my french toast with just egg and milk nothing else.  Usually my toast came out kinda flat and flavorless.  LOL.  Tried this recipe and loved it!  I also added some nutmeg to it.  Yum!  Never thought adding a bit of flour would help make them fluffy.  I learned to make french toast from my mom who really didn't experiment a whole lot mostly because of my dad and he's picky.  Since I got married 10 years ago I have gotten more "experimental" and tried my own things and have had success.  Don't be afraid to add your own thing.  I know some reviewers hate on people who change the recipes.  There is usually a reason.  Most people are looking for a base recipe and then go from there especially after reading reviews on what works for others.  I've posted recipes on here myself and I WELCOME people changing my recipes to suit their own tastes.  Why be boring?  LOL.  Anyways great recipe.  Thank you Bonnie!

I have no idea why or how flour makes french toast so much better, but it does!  This was the best french toast I've ever made.  Possibly ever had.  I've always used the same ingredients, only sans flour, but I thought I'd give this a try since the reviews were so stellar.  I'm glad I did!!  Thank you for this recipe!

We had this for dinner tonite and everyone enjoyed it.  I had to use regular sandwich bread as that is all I had on hand although I agree that Texas toast or a good French or Italian loaf would've been better.  Next time I will double the recipe, as I didn't even really let the bread soak and I only had enough mixture for 11 pieces of bread.  I also used a tablespoon of brown sugar in addition to the white sugar as another reviewer had suggested. I also cooked the bread slices in butter flavor crisco as well, which was also recommended by another reviewer. Next time I will be sure to soak each piece of bread for a longer time as the one piece that I did soak longer was the best one and did fluff up nicely.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe....I know my family will use it a lot!

This is a really good recipe! I followed another commenter's advice and sprinkled cinnamon on each side once putting it in the pan, because as is I didn't feel it was cinnamon-y enough, hence the 4 stars. But that is just my preference. With the adjustment it was delicious! I also added xylitol in place of sugar as well as nutmeg to the wet mix, and instead of using butter or Crisco to fry with, I used ghee, which is clarified butter and has a higher smoke point. Then you don't have to worry about burnt butter smell, and reap all the health benefits of delicious ghee! Next day leftovers are even better, as someone said before, u can just pop them in the toaster and they are good to go! My new favorite go-to breakfast!

Really, really bland and flavorless. I even added extra cinnamon and vanilla.The texture was alright - the inside was custardy enough, the outside could have been crispier. Probably won't make again.

The reason I am giving this recipe five stars is that's tasty and healthy at the same time. I've been making a french toast recipe for years that is awesome, but it is loaded in fat and calories. I recently had my galbladder out, and that has made me re-evaluate what I eat. This recipe has less than 200 calories and has 2.7 grams of fat. This means that I can have one piece of bacon, piece of fruit, and this recipe and I am still under 400 calories and feel full. This recipe is a definite keeper!

The taste of the recipe itself was "fine", though I didn't use the flour. My issue was, and I'd love to hear how the rave reviewers got past this, but using texas toast made it difficult to cook the batter all the way through the bread, so we took a bite into it with raw batter in the center. 30 seconds in the microwave per slice took care of cooking the center, but obviously affected the rest of the texture.

Only rating it a four star due to my own doing. I used whole wheat pastry flour because that's all I had and I didn't see a difference. Will def try with reg flour next time, french toast IS my fav no doubt.

The flour made the egg mixture not soak through and just sit on the surface which was unappealing.

This is a great recipe.  I changed 2 things that made it even better...Instead of milk, I used heavy whipping cream, with only about a tablespoon of milk to thin it out a little.  Second, I used about 2 tablespoons of warm honey, instead of the sugar.  It was delicious!

This recipe is THE best for french toast.  It makes french toast the way it should be, fluffy, moist (not soggy) and flavorful!  I have made this recipe several times and it's my family's favorite.  I always use french loaf and can double the recipe to 24 slices.  They freeze very well and reheat great.  My only change to the recipe is to add a dash of nutmeg.  Just a personal taste preference.  If you've never used nutmeg just know it is strong so a little goes a long way!  You must try this recipe. You will not be disappointed!

Recipe made about 3/4 of the servings listed.  Mixed dry ingredients first and then added wet ingredients ~ made a difference on how well they blended.  Letting slices soak while others cooked was a bad idea for "average" bread ~ it starting falling apart.  Besides that, my kids loved that this non-cooking Mom cooked french toast for the 1st time and even sprinkled it with powdered sugar!  :-)

This was seriously the best french toast I have made. In addition to the vanilla extract I also added a tsp. of almond extract. Also whisked everything together before adding the eggs. I had a baking sheet in a 200* oven ready for the cooked french toast. It helped keep it's shape and not get all flat soggy

This was wonderful.  You must be sure to use thick bread slices (I used Texas toast).  I added a little butter with the oil to the skillet to make it just a bit richer.

I had tremendous hope for this recipe...but it turned out soggy. I used thick bread but it just did not turn out well. I may try this recipe again, maybe I did something wrong?

Came out soggy, it stuck to the griddle, and flavor was no better than my own recipe. Won't use this again.

Needed a quick dinner for my daughter and me tonight, and since I was craving french toast, this fit the bill. I mixed my dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, and cinnamon) into the wet ones (milk, eggs, and vanilla) and whisked away. I added a tad more vanilla, a splash of almond extract, as I like the taste, and used 2 T sugar. All I had on hand was wheat bread, which worked great, but I'd love to try it with Texas toast next!

We use this recipe all the time now!  I add extra cinnamon just because we love cinnamon but the recipe is awesome just the way it is.  Strawberries are great to top it.

By far this is the absolute best recipe ever for french toast. My go to recipe hands down! French toast is so easy to adjust as far as taste goes I sometimes add pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and serve with homemade pumpkin butter. Awesome recipe!

Used 2/3's of the recipe and it made 7 slices. When you only cook one piece at a time remember to stir the egg mixture or all the flour sinks to the bottom! I sprinkle the cinnamon on each slice so they all get the same amount.

Absolutely the best french toast ever. My husband could not get enough. We had this today with bacon and hashbrowns. Made us all very happy. Like another reviewer mentioned it is restaurant quality. Definitely will make this again and again.

It was great- at least from what I can tell. (I have a week to loose 7-10 lbs and am avoiding carbs.) My 4 year-old had two slices and her 2 year-old brother scarfed up 3.  I mixed all the dry ingredients well first, then added the milk/vanilla mixture slowly until well-blended, adding the eggs last. The cinnamon  was well mixed and did not rise to the top-the last slice had just as much cinnamon as the first. I used butter on a griddle over low heat and allowed each side to cook about 4 minutes or until nicely browned.

Perfect! I used cream instead of milk (because it was all I had on hand) and it turned out absolutely PERFECT! I also kept the cooked ones in the toaster oven set at 250 degrees while I was finishing the rest of them. My husband loved it and I can't wait to make it again.

Not the best I've ever had. I adjusted the recipe to make 6 and there was only enough for 4 slices of regular cut bread. I do like the flour as it keeps it from getting soggy, but the taste is pretty plain.

These are tasty and worth the effort.  I used day old buns sliced thick and I allowed the slices to soak up the mixture.  Cook on med-low - don't rush them or they don't cook through the middle.  Notably flavourful and they smell wonderful.  Two 13 year old boys ate all and looked for more.  I do wonder how this recipe calls for 12 slices of bread - my mixture would only have done about 6 slices (2 and half buns was all I could do from one batch of mix.)

This is FANTASTIC!  I have been looking for a nice French Toast recipe and this is perfect.  It does fluff up nicely, which makes it so much lighter and yummy.  I used Kings Hawaiian bread and added a touch of orange zest and orange extract.  French Toast Perfection!

The flour is definately what makes this french toast better than some others (who knew?). I am surprised at the difference that ingredient makes. It doesn't  make enough to coat 12 slices for me though, but I soak mine quite a bit.

Kids loved it...and it was really simple to make with just regular old sandwich bread.  Nice that I didn't have to go out and specifically buy bread for french toast.  This is a regular in our house when we get to the end of the loaf...great recipe!

I've followed this recipe twice, with the same result both times.  I'm not sure what the addition of flour is supposed to do, all we could tell was that it made the toast lumpy and taste... well, like flour. I will most likely not try this again.

This recipe takes the ordinary french toast to extraordinary. I did as the fellow reviewer did and added a pinch of baking powder and a couple shacks of nutmeg. Totally delicious!! The nutmeg adds a kick to it. Also the first two slices of toast I did were not as fluffy as I liked, but then I realized it was because I was not letting them soak enough. All I needed to do was let them soak for a couple more second and that did the trick, came out more fluffy and thick, which made it amazing!

This is pretty good, but I can't tell the difference between this and French Toast I (though I tweaked both, more on this one in a minute). Most importantly: it is NOT fluffy. Not sure where that comes from. Flour doesn't fluff. The truth is, most French Toast recipes are similar and it's all just a matter of taste. I've made it this way several times, I've made it without flour, I've made it with more egg and I've made it with less milk and so forth. For this though, I doubled the cinnamon and vanilla and put in about 3/4 tsp of nutmeg (which could go up to 1 tsp). You DO NOT need thick bread to make this either. It's great for your stale/old regular sandwich bread. I do however recommend that if you're using regular bread, and it isn't stale, to let it sit out for about an hour or so to stiffen up (maybe in the oven overnight too) - to prevent sogginess - and don't soak regular bread either. Just dip it in and shake it off. In my opinion, making it with regular bread has more flavor than with thick bread. I have a little jar that I've covered with NEW (right out of the container) cleaned screen (yep, regular window screening), and in it is my powdered sugar. If you're guests are pouring their own syrup, then add it before giving it to them. If you're pouring it on there then add it after you've added the syrup. It melts into the syrup so you want them to see the sugar.

Very good recipe!!!!  I made this for my 4 year old son and he devoured it!!!!!!!!  I never would have thought to put flour in a french toast recipe...but this is a keeper.  This is my new recipe for french toast.  The only thing I did differently was added a little bit more of vanilla extract and cinnamon.  Plus, I used brown sugar instead of white.

I will preface this by saying that my boys demand the German Pancake on Sundays so getting them to try this was work!  I made this using a Panettone that I had bought for Christmas and it was delish!  We aren't huge french toast fans but this will be my go-to recipe when I do make it.  Try it with Panettone!

Perfect, doubled it and added a splash of milk and 1 extra egg (so I could do 2 full loaves of Texas Toast). It was deeeelicious! Thank you for sharing your recipe, it's a keeper!

I loved this recipe! My bread soaked up the mixture and I only got 7 slices of bread out of it before I ran out. My husband suggested we add nutmeg next time. As another reviewer mentioned, it reminded me of restaurant style french toast and was a beautiful golden brown. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Pretty decent French Toast.  I wouldn't call it the best ever, but it's good enough to save for later.

Like the ease of this recipe and I like the way the french toast looked when they came off the griddle.  I want to tweak it next time, but thanks for the recipe.

Made exactly as listed. I thought these were pretty good. It was not soggy but rather nice and fluffy.  Next time I may add a bit more sugar & cinnamon.  Top off with a light dusting of power sugar helps bring out the flavor in my opinion. Would make again as they were quick and simple.

I am currently an exchange student in Italy and I made this French toast for my Italian host family (who had never tried anything like it). Anyways they loved it! This is a really good recipe and I used it because I didn't bring my mom's recipe with me when I came here. It turned out very similar. :) Overall, really yummy!

This was a very good recipe but I have one suggestion. I don’t think the amount of the ingredients for the egg wash is adequate for the “servings”.  So, for whatever number of “servings” you calculate, I recommend you double the ingredients. While you may have some egg wash left over, I feel its better not to run out in the middle of cooking for your guests. Since the bread should be totally saturated, you won’t have to worry about running out if you double it.

Hands down best french toast ever! The flour really does make all the difference. I also use agave or sometimes brown sugar. Using homemade bread always turns out fabulous french toast. I am also a believer in using the butter flavored crisco instead of cooking spray on the griddle...surprising difference for me.

This turned out suprisingly well and good tasting. I thought with the flour, sugar and not so many eggs it wouldn't taste like the french toast.  My daughter undercooked them because she managed to somewhat burn them, but I plan on making the next batch. THANK YOU!

I have been looking for a simple but delicious french toast recipe for the longest time on here!! This one did not disappoint! Flour...what a great idea..I found followed the recipe exaclty.  I found that as it sat it combined better and the later one had better taste.  Next time I will let the mixture sit a little bit before rewhisking and then dipping.  I also rewhisked frequently during the process. Lots of room for variation...great idea on the addition of flour.  My best french toast ever.  Thanks for the recipe.

This really is amazing and fluffy French toast! I downgraded the servings because I was making it for just two people and there was barely enough batter for the amount of toast I was making. I'm a novice still but I would recommend making 1 extra serving to cover yourself.

This recipe was awesome! I did take the over rec and stirred after every dip. It made the difference! I will make this again and again. Also, I used healthy bread and still turned out great!

This recipe is great. The only thing I did was I added an equal part of brown sugar as white sugar. For example, the original recipe calls for 1 tbsp of white sugar, so I added to that 1 tbsp of brown sugar. It was perfect! I also added some pumpkin pie spice and that was delicious too!

the texture was perfect.  Kids loved it; I prefer more flavor as we don't use butter or syrup.  I think next time I will try it with some substitutions maybe brown sugar as I already added double cinnamon, sugar and vanilla.  Also added a tsp of rum.

I thought my French Toast were the best but these are by far, better.  My toddler who is very picky and doesn't like to eat much, dogged these french toast as if I've never fed her.  I guess this will be my new "secret" recipe.  Just hope no one I know uses Allrecipes.com.

This turned out great!  I used 15 slices of texas toast so when I got close to finishing 12 slices I just added 1 more egg and maybe 1/2 - 3/4 C. of milk.  After dipping the first 3-4 slices of bread, the mixture was short on cinnamon (I even whisked the mixture after each slice based on the reviews from others).  I would dip the remainder of the bread in the mixture, sprinkle cinnamon on one side and lay that side face down on the griddle and then sprinkle cinnamon on the other side (I also got this idea from a previous review).  After the french toast was cooked and placed on a serving platter I sifted powdered sugar over the top.  It tasted great & had a beautfiul presentation!  I froze the leftovers so we could have a quick & easy breakfast during the week.  My husband already tried some this morning before work and he said it was great.  We will be using this recipe again, thank you!

Yum recipe, and a good basic french toast recipe!  The only complaint I have is that it lacks flavor.  I would make this again, using more salt and cinnamon next time.  Also, I used thicker slices of bread, so my mixture only made 3/4 of the servings stated here.

Best french toast I ever made!!!  Read the reviews that said adding baking powder makes them truly fluffy; then decided to do it my way.  In place of the flour I used 1/3 cup extra fluffy pancake mix.  I increased to 1/3 cup to get more of the baking powder action, and to compensate for the egss/milk/etc in the mix.  They were awesome.  Used texas toast, put it on a rack in a 200F oven and turned it off and let sit several hours to dry the bread.  Only had enough batter to do 8 slices, but it was awesome!!

Turned out great! I took another reviewers suggestion, and used shorting to grease the pan. This does the trick much better than butter! Get's the french toast nice and golden without burning. I had just made a loaf of beer bread from the recipe beer bread I and used that for the bread. It was delicious. Melted down some strawberry jam with some water and boiled it until it made a delicious syrup :)

LOVED this recipe!  I can't believe it never occurred to me to add flour!  Such a simple addition changes your french toast from limp and soggy, to fluffy and magnificent!  I only wish I had great bread to make this with (I just used regular wheat and it was still fabulous).  This is truly a restaurant quality recipe, impress your family by dusting some confectionery sugar and garnishing with strawberrys and orange curls :)

This French Toast is FABULOUS!!  Be sure to make enough... you will want two pieces.  I used Italian loaf bread... but any bread would do nicely.  I wondered about the flour, but will never again use a different French Toast recipe.  Recipe is spot on... but if you soak the bread like I did you might not be able to soak 12 slices.  I can't say enough good about it.  Thanks so much Bonnie for sharing this recipe.

This is a pretty good french toast recipe. The addition of flour works nicely. I think how french toast turns out depends upon the bread you use.

Have tried and failed time and time again to successfully make French Toast. It has always come out soggy for me. I think the key is definitely the Texas style toast. Made this for my family yesterday morning and every piece was gone. Didn't have any vanilla, so I used almond extract instead... great flavor. The recipe only yielded 8 pieces of french toast for me though.

my son who refuses to eat any kind of bread ate this up like it was candy! i halved the recipe and used 2 eggs, whole wheat bread, and cane sugar. i don't think i soaked the bread in the mixture long enough because the inside was still dry. i froze the leftover slices as well, hopefully they will still be as good when i toast them up.

This makes wonderful french toast, the family loved it!  We really liked the way it cookes up nice and fluffy with a slightly crisp exterior and it's not eggy tasting.  i used 2/3's of the recipe and it was enough to well soak 5 slices of store bought, wide, sliced sweet french bread.  Will definately use this recipe for french toast from now on.   Thanks for sharing this one!

This was  good.  I think it needed a little more flavor.  I will add nutmeg next time.  It is best to cook with a lid or you will get soggy toast.

I agree with previous reviews that this recipe does stop the bread from going soggy, which is great, but think it needs a little bit more flavour.  Will happily try again, as the husband gobbled this up fast, but may play around with the flavourings to find a favourite.  Thanks for the grat base recipe though!

Awesome recipe / taste, followed the ingredients exactly, I will make again!  My bread was a LITTLE wet in the middle and I just did a quick dip, so that probably has more to do with my personal cooking technique.  Another reviewer suggested to cover the pan while cooking so I will attempt that.  I see that other people have had trouble with making the mix stretch...I made 8 slices from a regular sliced loaf and still had mix left to dip the bread in.  Update:  Covering the pan definitely works better.  I never have old bread on hand and found that this recipe works very well with store brand Texas toast bread.  Worth trying with the Blueberry Breakfast Sauce from this site.  Yum!

This has become our new french toast recipe.  Not the least bit soggy and taste is very good.  I recommend whisking between every couple slices as I had problems with the cinnamon settling on the bottom.

To be completely honest I didn't think this tasted much different. I couldn't get the batter completely clumpless from the flour either. I also took the suggestion of another reviewer and cooked it in Crisco. It worked ok, but the crisco heated faster and so I had to be really careful about it burning.

This was great. I made it this morning for breakfast. I usually have a problem with french toast instantly getting soggy. This recipe did not get completely soggy; although, I did notice that it does get a bit soft but it is way more tolerable. I made it exactly as the recipe said and did whisk the batter before each time I used it. I did notice in the end that when I poured out the excess the flour had settled to the bottom so I think it is really important to whisk it each time.

This recipe is great, however, French toast needs a bread with density to it. Home made bread works the best....makes a big difference.

Made this yesterday for hubby and a couple friends who came over for brunch and it was just ok. Honestly, I think the bread we used just wasn't that tasty to begin with (we used a baguette from the local grocery store). Also, the batter wasn't mixed well enough. I think next time, I will use a hand blender to make sure it's thoroughly whipped. Since everyone here raves about it, I'm not giving up on this recipe but my first try wasn't a success :(

This is my very first time making french toast. (I know, I just started cooking and enjoying it lol). So I can't really compare it to other recipes, but it came out perfect. Tastes like great french toast. I would note though, that I did change the servings to 4 and with that, the mixture only soaked 2 slices of the bread that I had prepared. Next time I will double the recipe to make it for 4.

My search for the perfect French toast is over! I misread the recipe and put in only two eggs and two tbsp. sugar. Turned out perfectly and I didn't notice my mistakes until tonight. All I can say is wow! I liked that it didn't taste like egg-fried bread and the extra tbsp. of sugar gave it a nice sweetness that wasn't overpowering. Delicious.

I actually use my own recipe for french toast but decided to add flour as suggested in this recipe...WOW, the flour is the key!  The french toast is so pretty to look at and it's nice and fluffy instead of sort of sunken in the middle like it used to be.  Thanks so much for the flour tip Bonnie!!  GREAT!

Awesome batter; the flour really makes this recipe.  I have used other breads when I don't have challah, and the batter works with everything.  This is so easy, it's my go-to recipe whenever I want to make french toast (or just use up old bread).

This recipe was just ok. Nothing really spectacular about it. Probably won't make it again.

I haven't made French Toast before, but I have eaten a lot of restaurant versions and this was up there with the best of them. I will definitely make this again! It was much easier than I ever imagined. I always made pancakes because I thought French Toast was too hard. But this was fast! I used very large slices of artisan bread and only had enough egg mix for 7 slices, but that was more than enough for two people!

This was great! It turned out perfect. Not to soggy and just the right amount of flavor! I did add some extra brown sugar but the whole family loved it! I did find if using thick bread which it suggest make some extra batter b/c I ran out with 2 pieces left to make so I improvised!

This was good.  One recommendation though....after you make the egg coating mixture, keep stirring it up. Otherwise, all the cinnamon sinks to the bottom of the bowl.

I did not get as many pieces of French toast as the recipe said it yielded (even adding extra milk), but the toast did turn out well. This was not as good as in restaurant, that is why I gave it 3 stars.

Great recipe, I will always use this recipe for my Bed & Breakfast Inn instead of just plain eggs but I add 1 more egg so that it gets a more golden brown color. Really watch the heat, because the bread can burn easier because of the amount of milk, but really it is worth the extra steps!

If you cook this long enough it really is a good recipe. I put more cinnamon than asked for and also put in the seasonings before the milk. I'd make it again. Thanks for the great recipe. P.S. it did come out fluffy.

Works so well with a variety of breads!  Our fave way is to cut cheap day old bread slices into thirds before dipping and grilling - makes tasty little french toast sticks which are so much easier for little fingers to eat. Thanks for the recipe - definitely a keeper! :)

We've always added Bisquick, instead of flour, in making our French Toast and have gotten great results.

Similar to mine so they've got to be good.  I've been using 1/4 c all in one pancake flour for quite some time.  A light grind of nutmeg & a dusting of powdered sugar and it's fit for a king!!!

I make French Toast all the time but stumbled across this recipe.  It's so simple but the flour makes all the difference.  I used regular sliced bread because that was all I had on hand and it worked out great.  From now on I will always add flour to my French toast recipes.  I can't wait to try it with thick sliced bread.  Yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written, may sure I had the texas toast bread and it came out great...Dont know why some stated that it was dry because mines was perfect..I think if you over cook it then it may come out dry but if you cook it properly you will have great french toast...Definitely using this again

The first few weren't that great, the middle few awesome, the last few were kind of weird.  I attribute this to the flour settling in the bowl.  Be sure to agitate the mixture every time before dipping your bread to make sure it doesn't separate.  Otherwise a spectacular tasting recipe.

Quick, Easy and delicious - all the qualities of a perfect recipe! Made recipe exactly as listed.  Results were perfect. I have never been able to make french toast and this came out better than restaurants. I used homemade Irish soda bread cut thick.  I started off cooking them in a pan with non-stick spray but was not satisfied with results. Switched to oil and was impressed. Will be making this again but experimenting with toppings.

This recipe is very delicious. Just a few notes: make sure you SOAK the bread because we sort of dipped for about ten seconds and the French Toast was kind of dry because we didn't soak the bread long enough.  Also we put in one pureed banana.  Make sure to stir the batter after soaking every couple of slices because flour goes to the bottom and cinnamon goes to the top.  We used our super market bakery home-style white bread.  The French Toast was very delicious.  Love them so much.

This did not turn out well. I followed the recipe exactly, and found that it did not produce enough mixture for the slices. The taste was bland. Had to liberally use the syrup...

Fantastic!  I've always struggled with french toast being flat.  These pieces held their shape - the presentation was GREATLY improved.  The taste was great, too!  The only change I made was that I added the flour to the liquid ingredients to help prevent clumping vs. the other way around.

This was the best French Toast I've ever had!  My family all agreed, and suggested that I never make any other recipe.  I made a couple of unintentional changes...I used 4 eggs, because I thought that's what the recipe said, until I looked at it again...and I was out of milk, so I used heavy cream.  Will definitely be making this again, and again!!!  Thanks a million for sharing!  :)

*** first rating of 3 stars***I found this quite bland, but i didn't follow the recipe exactly as written (added an extra egg and didn't add vanilla because i was out). I imagine i was to blame for the way the recipe turned out, and not the recipe it's self. I will try this recipe again very soon using the exact directions and hopefully be able to change my rating!
**UPDATED RATING OF 4 STARS** Followed the recipe exactly (except i used soy milk) - it is MUCH better (but still not *exceptional* - what i consider a 5 star recipe) and definitely a recipe that i will be using again.

I'd like to start off by saying I hate french toast.  With that said, this was delicious!   I halved the recipe (kept the cinnamon the same and used 1 whole egg and 1 egg white).   I used pretty dense bread and let it soak up the egg mixture and was only able to cover 3 pieces which is perfect because that's how many I was trying to make. I was only making it as a favor for my husband who loves french toast.   Maybe I'll make two pieces next time for me.  Thanks!

This recipe was ok, but nothing special.  The flour caused it to cook like a pancake on the outside of the toast and the inside of the toast stayed soggy.  I even tried cooking the bread pieces longer, but all that did was make the outside brown more than I wanted.  It was good, but next time I'll probably just stick to my own recipe.

This is good, but I wouldn't call them fluffy.  My mom sent me this recipe to try, so I did.  But I have to say my regular recipe for french toast is identical to this without the flour.  I actually like a more eggy taste so I probably will go back to my old way without flour and with much less milk.

Very yummy!  After reading the reviews, I did add more cinnamon (1 tsp more) and used regular "Frontier" whole wheat bread. Tried it out 'cause my son will be visiting next week- it's a keeper!! BTW- this receipe covered 7 slices exactly- and that was to the last drop!  So if you need more, plan on making another batch :)

AWESOME recipe.  I followed the recipe pretty true to form, although I didn't measure the cinnamon or vanilla.  It was a huge hit and I'll def be making it again.  Also, I tried someone else's suggestion about cooking the bread in a little melted shortening instead of butter.  That turned out great...perfectly golden brown.  I'll be using that tip again.

I doubled the cinnamon like other reviewers suggested.  I like each slice to be equally saturated with the egg mixture so I arranged my bread in a jelly roll pan and poured the mixture over all the pieces at once.  I let it sit a few minutes and flipped the bread so the tops could soak up the remaining liquid.  I fried the bread on a non-stick griddle with no extra oil or butter and the results came out great.  Definitely a keeper.

I just made this for breakfast this morning. It was delish. I made 4 servings and it turned out wonderful. Only thing I had an issue with was by the time I coated the 4 piece of bread there was barely anything left. I may have overcoated the other pieces. I just gave that piece to my 14month old so it wasn't a big deal. Next time I'll just make a big serving and use the 4 pieces of bread. My hubby said it was just like his mom's *SCORE*

This French Toast recipe is wonderful.  I use my home made bread for it and it turns out perfect.  I usually have to double the recipe for my family but I do not double the eggs and it is still wonderful.

Scaled to 4 servings was only enough for 3 slices of bread. Make sure you make more than I did :). It was delicious though.

This recipe turned out great!  It was fluffy, but very filling.  The vanilla gave it a great flavor.  I quadrupled the recipe and made a bunch of extra to freeze.  It reheated well and kept it's fluffiness even after freezing.  I did find that it did not make as many slices as the recipe indicated it should, but I like to soak my bread quite a bit.  Overall, it was delicious!  This is the recipe I will stick with from now on!

The best french toast I've ever had! Partially because I used the "Absolute Best Pancake Syrup" recipe from this site.  I used less bread than it suggested would be used though I did soak it for a long time.

This french toast was tasty, however, I can't give it 5 stars because there just wasn't enough batter for 12 pieces, and I didn't even use thick bread, or saturate the bread.  I used regular sandwich bread.  Next time I will definitely make more batter.  The french toast was very good, but not a huge difference from regular french toast.

Delicious! Best french toast I've ever had. I used an Italian bread I bought from my grocery store bakery. I also used an electric griddle instead of a fry pan to make it faster. This will be the way I make my french toast from now on. Tasted just like restaurants french toast made with homemade bread. YUMMY!!! My 3yr old gobbled it up fast too.

This recipe is AWESOME.  I ended up using wonder bread (only stuff left in the house)-- which normally disintegrates under french toast treatment.  This recipe had the bread holding up strong and actually tasting really good.  Can't wait to make it again, I think I'm going to try making enough that I can freeze it and have my husband reheat as he needs for breakfast.

This is a fantastic recipe! I have never had much luck making French toast before.  All the ones I made turned out just okay, but the ones I made using this recipe were fluffy and tasty.  They smelled lovely too.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I did reduce the vanilla because I know that I often find the extract too strong for my personal preference.  I used the bread from Chinese style bakery, which is slightly more moist and moist.  It's a bit like egg bread.  I do have one little tip to share - Cinnamon floats, so the first two slices tend to suck up all the cinnamon.  After the first few slices, add an extra pinch of cinnamon and stir up the mixture to ensure that the remaining slices are just as cinnamony.

Delicious and very quick and easy. The best two tips I read from others were
1. whisk the mixture before dipping the next piece of bread, and 2. use butter flavored Crisco (butter burns and turns brown too quickly!) Make sure to cook it 2-3 mins on each side so you don't get stuck with soggy french toast. If it's burning by then your skillet is up too high! :) Enjoy!

excellent recipe! i had to double the recipe bc i was using thick slices of brioche bread and it is really absorpant. added a touch of nutmeg and used brown sugar instead of white. heated up the electric griddle with butter and this came out perfect. i also heated syrup with sliced up bananas on low heat for a beautiful caramelized banana syrup. yum!

I'm a novice cook and I made this before and it was only ok.  It was a bit on the soggy side.  But, I tried it again and this time it was awesome.  The key for me was that I needed to make sure the bread was crispy before removing it from the pan.  It would look golden brown as the recipe states, but it would be too soggy for me.  Once I left it on the pan longer and tested the crispiness by touching it with a spatula, it was perfect!  Perhaps that's what most people already do, but again, being a novice cook, I had to learn through trial and error.

I gave this recipe a 5 because I have made French toast a bizillion times and eaten it even more and this so far is the best I have had and all I had on hand for bread was something thin and cheap.  Can't wait to make it again with the good stuff.  Thanks for the recipe.  Even my picky lil 3 yr old gobbled it up:)

I found out too late that I was out of vanilla, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It was excellent, the best french toast I've had. I served it buttered and sprinkled with powdered sugar, then topped with strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, and syrup. Yum! I will never have it any other way. (I can't wait to try it with vanilla.)

This was an awesome french toast.  The vanilla really added a great flavor.  I wish the cinnamon flavor was more intense so I will follow another reviewer's advice next time and spinkle each piece with cinnamon.  I made it with homemade honey wheat bread and real maple syrup and it was amazing!

I haven't had french toast in years, so I didn't have much to compare this recipe to - only memories. That said, this recipe was easy to make and the results were satisfying. Not as good as mom used to do it, but still a good recipe.

A delicious french toast recipe. Did not get very "fluffy", but quite tasty.  Used Amish White Bread Recipe from this site as bread base.

A decent French Toast recipe.  If you can, sift the flour, as mine clumped together, leaving flour balls on the toast.  I also added a lot more cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, which helped the flavor.  Had some fun with the leftover batter by making a French Pancake by adding flour to the batter.

I love this recipe. I use cinnamon raisin bread and it tastes delicious. Surprisingly, I've found that you can freeze these leftovers if you've made too much; just wrap slices indiviually in plastic wrap and tin foil, then unwrap and pop in the toaster for a quick breakfast. It tastes just as good this way.

this is one of the best french toast I have made in a long time...try it with the sauteed apples (off this site) and it is  wonderful!! It was almost a brunch dessert instead of a main meal...but oh so good//and the french toast came out slightly crunchy from cooking it in butter/oil mix!! Oh thank you

Love the mixture - the flour clumps easily so be sure to slowly mix in the milk with the flour. It's hard to find some good slices of thick bread so I always buy french bread and let it sit for awhile (perfect recipe for those stale pieces!)

excellent french toast! Simply delicious! I do have a suggestion though. next time I would sprinkle the cinnamon onto the bread after it has been soaked in the liquid mixture. This way there is more of a detectable cinnamon taste and each piece of bread gets evenly spiced rather then the first couple pieces soaking up all the cinnamon. And this is my personal preference, but I love sprinkling brown sugar onto the   bread as it's frying. It gives a sweet hint so that I don't necessarily have to use too much syrup later.

Yum!  I used Country Crock cinnamon butter and syrup with this French toast and it was almost like having a Cinnabon!  :)  Both my kids ate it up which is rare for them.  It's a keeper!

This french toast was very delicious!! The only thing I would do different would be if your using regular white bread, make sure you don't soak the bread in the batter to long because it gets a little soggy and I would also add a little more cinnamon! Very good though and I got great comments from my husband..he loved it! Thanks for sharing!

Pretty tasty. I used some old French bread that I cut and let sit out to get stale for a few hours before I soaked it, and I got some really nice thick and chewy french toast out of it. I added a bit of fresh nutmeg and used vanilla soymilk for the milk--yum.

The addition of flour really works!  According to my husband, this is better than any other french toast I've made.  We did use "day old" egg/cinnamon bread which always helps too!  Don't forget to add 1/2t of nutmeg.  It makes all the difference!

This french toast is really good!  I tried one other recipe before this (French Toast I), and I liked this one much better.  I have already made this twice.  I reduced the recipe to make only 4 slices since it was just for me & used regular white bread, and it was great!  Thanks so much!

EASY...EASY....EASY.....Nothing fancy with the recipe....a good basic recipe that can easily adapt to add-on's if you choose. I used a basic bread and it turned out perfect. My kids don't like a lot of straight from the bottle cinnamon so they take the premade Cin. Sugar and sprinkle it on after I cook it.

I am appalled that so many people didn't enjoy this recipe.  My family and myself found it to be the most delicous french toast that we had ever consumed.  I would give this recipe 1000 stars.  Go Fluffy French Toast, you rock my world!

Delicious, especially when served with homemade maple syrup!!  Much better than regular french toast, and very easy!  Do make sure to keep the batter mixed up; the flour tends to settle on the bottom.  This is the recipe we will use from now on!

Excellent and tasty.  I scaled recipe to 4 servings and used regular sliced bread (not thick); it covered 5 slices.  I also added a pinch of nutmeg, although it is not necessary.  Used spray on oil on a hot pan with picture perfect results.

This was very good!  I took the suggestion of a past reviewer and mixed everything in the blender - much easier to get the flour mixed in!  Also I used powdered buttermilk in place of regular milk and doubled the cinnamon.  It has a thicker texture and isn't so soggy like regular french toast.  Be prepared to cook a bit longer on lower heat so it gets cooked through.

This recipe was very tasty, but not very fluffy.  I made it again this morning and added 1 T of baking powder.  That helped with the fluffiness a little.  I think I'm going to experiment a little further with this one.

The best I have ever made!  I used really fresh potato bread and it was so good.  My husband loved it too.  I was afraid it wouldn't be enough so I added an extra egg but you could still taste the vanilla and sugar.  I also substituted pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon and that was great.

I made this for breakfast for my boyfriend and I. I whisked this very well and had no trouble w/the flour settling. This was wonderful..a wonderful combination of cinnamon and vanilla. I know I'll be making this for weekend breakfasts from now on.

This recipe makes great french toast!  Fluffy and cinnamonny!  My family loves it.

You can make it heart healthy by using a smart bread and egg whites.

Funny story - my husband was going to make plain old french toast, but I left this recipe on the counter for him as a "hint-hint".  He made it and it turned out wonderful!  It had a great flavor!  Will make again...maybe next time I will add some pecans on top :-)  If he can make it, anyone can!

This is the BEST french toast...it tastes just like Cracker Barrel's. Now I can enjoy this at home, and it is super easy. I used Holsum's texas toast with this recipe...sooooo good! Thanks for sharing!

I have to admit that I didn't see how french toast could be different from any others, but this definitely is!  I used cinnamon swirl bread, because I couldn't find any other kind I liked.  This was awesome!  I made it for my fiance's birthday breakfast and he thought it was the best he had ever had. Yummmm!

This was great French Toast!  I also needed a couple less slices of bread.  But,I used orange flavored wheat bread which was a little denser than most bread so that could be why I ran out.  I will make this again for sure.

My family agrees this is the best French toast I've ever made!  I took some suggestions from other reviewers and used butter Crisco on the griddle, added brown sugar (kept the white sugar too), and doubled the vanilla.  I also added butter extract to make it even richer tasting, and sprinkled a little powdered sugar on before serving to make it look pretty.   I used 2 loaves of Texas toast bread and quadrupled the recipe; I had leftover egg mixture so I may have been able to just triple it, but I wanted to be sure I had enough.  Kept leftovers in the fridge overnight and reheated them in the toaster oven on 350 til warm.  Yummy the second day too.

I’ve been using this recipe for a couple years now and everyone likes it! I have learned to add the cinnamon in with the flour FIRST, and then slowly add milk and the remaining ingredients. This will eliminate the cinnamon from floating on top!

I added the vanilla extract, plus the same amount of almond extract, and I loved it! I woke up at 5:45 and the first batch was done by 6:00. I did not prep the batter before. The prep was about 10 minutes and I cooked the french toast for about 2.5 minutes on each side and it was a hit with my family.

I was a little dubious about adding flour to the batter for French toast, but, boy, I'm glad I did. This recipe did, in fact, produce one of the fluffiest FTs I've ever made in my life. I adhered to the recipe almost entirely, but I did add some extra vanilla extract because I like it. Other that than, I kept to the original. With that in mind, however, I do recommend that you use a good quality bread. It makes a world of difference. Sandwich bread just wouldn't cut it. You really need to have a thick bread that can absorb the liquid without falling apart. In my case, I had some soft french bread on hand that I got at my local grocery store. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE ENOUGH. IT'S MY NEW GO-TO FRENCH TOAST.

Amazing!!! I finally found a good french toast recipe. To really perfect it I used only the egg yolks instead of the entire egg and I baked the toast after cooking in the skillet. Set it at 350 deg for at most 10 minutes to make the outside crunchy but not burnt and retain a soft inside. The bread you pick will definitely make it, so stop by the bakery section of your local grocery store and grab a loaf you can slice yourself to the desired thickness. Cut your bread the day (or night) before and leave it out, it'll get stale enough to soak up your french toast mixture.

I've tasted other recipes even at quality restaurants but this is by far the best ever! I used regular bread and still came out amazing!  Easy to make, full of flavor for your buds, doesn't taste eggy or bland. Top with a little powdered sugar fruit and whip topping and you've got your "everybody's fav" I will be making this for the rest of my life!

Great Recipe! I made the mixture the night before and placed bread slices in a baking dish, poured mixture over bread and covered with wrap. Let it stand overnight. Made the next morning.  Fantastic!

Kids loved it! I did double the sweeteners though. Now I'll always make French toast with whole wheat flour! Really quick too.  Turned over the slices in 1 minute and kids had Nutella with it. Yum! Also great in using up old/hard sliced bread!

This is the only recipe for French toast I use my husband and son won't eat anyone's or anywhere else's ! I omit the salt and add extra vanilla and cinnamon! I serve with homemade cinnamon syrup and other times I throw some raspberries, blackberries , or strawberries which ever I have that day in a sauce pan with some water , sugar, and flour and make a nice fruit topping jam  !! These freeze well to and reheat in the toaster still as delicious as freshly made !!

I have been using the modified version of this recipe in my Cafe now.  I did add nutmeg at the ratio of 3:1 of cinnamon..so 3 tsp. cinnamon to 1 tsp nutmeg.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar along with doubling the vanilla.  I also lowered the flower content by 1/3rd.  It is a very well balanced french toast recipe as written but with these changes it was super awesome and a customer favorite.

I use it all the time. It is my go to recipe for French toast. Biggest thing is choosing the right bread. We tend to like Texas toast. Regular sandwich bread just doesn't work well, but we've had success with other thick slice breads.

The first attempt yielded lumps of flour throughout the batter. This was an error on my part as I mixed the flour into the milk and eggs. My second attempt was much more successful! Slowly whisking in the milk to the flour made for a much more smooth consistency.  The flavor of the french toast is awesome! I really enjoyed the cinnamon!

This recipe was great. Along with the listed ingredients I also added about a teaspoon of molasses to the mix. The only advice I would give is that the mix didn't quite go as far as the servings suggested.

My family really did love this recipe.  I couldn't find a thick sliced bread at the grocery I go to so I ended up using some potato bread slices.  Only thing I changed was added some nutmeg (personal choice and really the seasonings can be adjusted to any preferences). Some reviewers have commented that while fluffy the middle turned out dry.  Most of mine turned out that way as well, but I personally like a dryer middle vs a soggy or mushy one.  I loved how fluffy it turned  out vs the dense traditional of the method I previously used.  As others have stated Make Sure You Stir the Batter Before Each Use!  It does settle and quite quickly.  Very glad I came across this recipe. Thank you for sharing it!

It states that the recipe is good for 12 slices  of Texas toast, however I didn't get past four slices,  before running out. .  Cooked according to directions but was very gooey in the middle since I allowed each slice to "saturate ".  Did not like and would never make again.

I'm trying this recipe right now and it's awesome! FRENCH TOAST HEAVEN! Not soggy at all. Even the burned one tastes good :D I used the thick bread so I'm trying to get the hand of the cooking time. I'm also covering it while it cooks to help speed up cooking idk if this helps at all lol. Also for all those who think 1/4 cup of flour is not enough, trust me it enough it works like magic* I also added more cinnamon because...why not? Right ;) Anyway give this a try people, I think you'll be very pleased with your results.

Delicious!  I doubled the egg/milk mixture using 3 packets of Splenda instead of the sugar.  We enjoyed this on Texas toast and it made plenty for the 2 of us to have lots of leftovers.  Can't wait to have them later this week from the toaster.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

Best French toast ever! I used "day old" french bread cut on the diagonal (WAY better than regular bread or Texas toast). Also, I grated cinnamon sticks for the cinnamon. Not necessary, but it smelled, looked, and tasted better. At the end I sprinkled finely ground sea salt and powdered sugar on top, with syrup. The sweet and salty combo made it pop. I used unsalted butter to cook them in, so maybe you skip that if using salted butter. This came out better than ANY restaurant I have been to.

Made this with day old crusty French bread and substituted 3/4c buttermilk and 1/4c water instead of 1c of milk. Came out delicious. I'll be making this again for sure!

Hands down the best French toast recipe I've ever tried.  I added my own little flair to it, but I've made the original recipe, too, and loved it. My alterations are as follows: I use French bread. I buy the $1 loaf at Walmart and cut it up into thick slices. It comes out to about 16 pieces. Next, I use vanilla sugar. Don't do this unless you're a fan of vanilla. You could cut back on the vanilla extract if necessary. I do not. I also use real maple syrup. It's so much better than the imitation stuff. It's expensive but worth it.

Overall, this is an A++ recipe. It's easy to make; delicious; and a crowd pleaser. Try it.

This is the best french toast I have ever made!!!  I made the recipe as is with no alterations.  Definately a keeper.  I am planning on putting this on my freezer meal rotation.  This recipe made 13 french toasts from regular sliced loaf bread.

Loved this recipe! I increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp but left everything else the same. Turns out great every time I make it. Make sure to whisk in between batches or your first few slices will be full of cinnamon and the rest will have none because the cinnamon floats the the top as it sits.

Turned out great!!  Since I’m gluten/dairy free, I had to substitute some ingredients. I used an all-purpose gluten free flour and replaced the milk with sweetened almond milk. I also exchanged the white sugar for coconut sugar. I love that this French Toast mixture uses flour which helps to bind the egg mixture to bread a lot better. The thing I thought was abit iffy was the amount of salt used. I decreased the salt amount, but it still tasted alittle salty.

Favorite French toast recipe so far. I made one minor revision - doubled the flour. I also recommend using thick slices of Hawaiian sweet bread. The type and thickness of the bread seems to make all the difference in the world. My kids like this combination best.

The Mrs. will only eat the French toast sticks because they are firm and not soggy, much like the French toast that I ate when growing up. However, she loves this recipe more than her beloved French toast sticks. That is of course after I slightly modify the recipe to our preferred taste. As suggested by other reviewers: add 1 tbsp. brown sugar, double the vanilla extract to 2 tsp., double the cinnamon to 1 tsp., add a bit of nutmeg (1/2 tsp.). I also prefer to use 1 to 2 day old/stale texas toast bread and reduce the milk to 3/4 cup. Then, I top them off with butter, confectioners sugar, fresh fruit, and whipped cream. Whole family agrees that this is best French toast recipe to date, even when unaltered.

Perfect for simple French today with a bit more room thanks to the flour.  It even tastes good with Sara Lee 45 calorie bread.  Recommend using a griddle.

My niece and I thought it was amazing.  We didn't have vanilla in the house so we used more cinnamon.  It was tasty and easy and we had it with bananas, grapes, and apple sauce.  We will make again.

This is the way I make my own French Toast, so I wanted to give the recipe kudos! I love this version and the flour really makes all the difference. I add nutmeg in place of cinnamon, but it's good no matter what!

Great recipe. I use Texas toast for my bread, which is super thick, so I had to triple the recipe to have enough batter for the entire loaf.

I just made this recipe for my family's Valentine's Day breakfast.  It is definitely the fluffiest French Toast I've ever made, but the first test batch was lacking flavor for our taste.  For the second batch, I added more cinnamon, vanilla and sugar and the flavor was much better.  I also used Challah bread, cut into 1" thick slices, which soaks up a lot of the mixture so I had to more than double the recipe to have enough.  Thank you for sharing the idea of putting flour into the mix...it definitely makes a big difference.  Topped mine with additional cinnamon sugar and/or confectioners sugar.    Delicious!

Loved it. Didn't change a thing except dust with a little powdered sugar for presentation. Next time I'll add cinnamon to the dusting. Hubby loves cinnamon.

Amazing! I only added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the batter and followed the rest of the recipe to the tee. My hubby, 7 and 1 yr olds loved it! Goes great w sausage patties. Next time will try "stuffing" w fruit as others have suggested. Thanks Bonnie!

Made this recipe today (minus the cinnamon) and everyone loved it. I used 'texas toast' bread, and with using this recipe I was only able to make 8 pieces of French toast. That was dipping the bread quickly, and not letting them soak in the mixture for any amount of time.

Stop looking and try this recipe- it is the best basic French toast by far. Use a tiny bit of nutmeg. Keep the temp down because of the sugar.

Awesome! Best French Toast ever.  I used some rolls we had and cut the top and bottom off so the toast was a nice thick French Toast.

they were really good! i changed the serving size so that i could just make them for my sister and me, and there wasn't enough of the egg batter so i would advise that you ask for one or two more serving sizes more for your pieces of toast.

First time I have made French Toast. My family loved it. Make sure to whisk in the flour with the milk 1/4 cup at a time for it to be smooth.

My mother is very picky on french toast and gets it every single time we go out for lunch, and I wanted to surprise her and make her favorite breakfast for her, and she loved it so much. To this day, she says she has never had french toast that good.

Awesome french toast!! I never wanted to make french toast that much because is was too soggy and tasteless. I was worried about the flour because it sounded weird. But it was great. It kept the bread from being soggy and the cinnamon spread all over the bread. Now I don't have to go to a restaurant to get good french toast. I can make my own great french toast

This is a great recipe.  I was looking for a way to make my French Toast less soggy and came across this recipe. It was very similar to the one I used with the exception of flour.  Boy did that flour make a difference. Very fluffy indeed, not soggy and very delicious.  Will definitely use again!

I've never been successful with French toast but this came out perfectly. Light and fluffy just like a restaurant. I agree with other viewers about the cinnamon. I would sprinkle each piece instead of mixing it. And I like to eat it with cream cheese. Yum!

We just had these for breakfast this morning, and both, my husband and I loved this french toast. It was so much better than the usual recipe that I usually use! I'm keeping this recipe. I guess the flour makes a difference! And it's just a little bit. I also added more cinnamon 2 tsp. as it is so good for us. 
After reading some of these other reviews, I'm going to try it with some Kalhua next time!!
Nothing left to take a picture of!!

I made this recipe as is.  I used Pannani bread which is similar to Italian bread but dryer and little thicker than normal sliced Italian bread.  I liked  this recipe and will make again.

This was sooooo good! I woke up New Year's Day wanting something sweet and had a extra loaf of French bread and then found this recipe.  Oh My! I did as some reviewers suggested  and used brown sugar in lieu of the white sugar.  Then I added some extra cinnamon at the end. The mixture made just enough for the 11 slices of French breads I cut which were about 1 inch thick. More than enough for my husband and myself so I will freeze the remainder.  Will use this again and again.  Extra good with a sprinkling of powdered sugar!

Served this for my family on Christmas morning.  It was very good.  Personally I bought a loaf of Italian bread and sliced the bread thicker to make more hearty slices.  I also doubled the cinnamon.  Very good.

Perfect, simple and delicious! I added a mashed banana (just to use em up) and it was great!   I've made them with and without bananas and both ways were great! Ive also fried with butter, Pam and crisco and I have to say, crisco was my fave! Perfectly golden and fluffy! Soo easy, I whip these up weekly for Sunday breakfast :)

This is the best french toast recipe ever! It doesn't have that eggy taste like some places. I added a little bit more of the cinnamon and vanilla extract just to make the flavor stronger, but it's just as good if you follow the recipe.

Wonderful French toast recipe! If your feeling that sweet tooth one thing we have done is mixed some brown sugar with melted butter, Added it on top of each slice then broiled the slices on a baking sheet till bubbling and let cool. Glazes the French toast and it's amazing!!

It was delicious. We followed advice of others and doubled the spices & added a dash of nutmeg, 2tsp honey,  2tsp brown sugar, orange zest. We were out of milk so use heavy whipping cream reduction.

Loved this. I used two day old French bread baked at the local market that I sliced thick (about an inch). I sprinkled a little extra cinnamon on one side of the slices when I put them on the non-stick griddle and they were perfect. I used an electric mixer to mix the ingredients. This tasted like the French Toast my mom used to make. My 3yo loved it too! Of course pure Vermont maple syrup heated and drizzled on top sealed the deal. :-)

Decent recipe but had some issues with the ingredients kind of floating to the top. So the first dipped toast would have everything on there, but the others would have no cinnamon or eggs or anything. So next time definitely wisk between each dipping.

Only had regular (not thick) sliced bread so we used that. Thick would've been nice, but it worked out fine.

Made 6 for me and my hubby, but had to make more of the dip stuff because the recipe cut in half wasn't enough. So just make whole thing and use how many slices you want, unless only making one or two pieces.

I make this French toast for my husband almost every weekend with brioche or challah bread. It is flawless! In the fall, I also add some pumpkin spice to the mix ;)

This is the same as my old recipe with the exception of the flour. I loved this recipe as it was easy and smelled wonderful. My kids said my house smelled like Disney Main Street Bakery. I used a thick egg bread similar to Texas Toast. I used a hand mixer to make the batter and I still had flour gathering at the bottom. I wonder if you mixed it and let it sit overnight or for a while in the morning so that the flour has time to absorb the liquids if it would be more of a suspension and a batter. Either way it was terrific and fast and freezes beautifully with waxed paper between the slices and then in an air-tight bag. Then in the morning you put it in the toaster and it is perfect.

I was looking for a French toast recipe rather than my usual eggs, milk, cinnamon and vanilla. I stumbled upon this one and I figured I'd try it with so many great reviews! I was hesitant at first because it said to add flour! But let me tell you, this recipe is super DELICIOUS! I loved it as we'll as my husband! I will always use this recipe from now on! I used the Texas Toast from Safeway, which I love for French toast since its thick. Also read a review that thy used butter flavor crisco and I just so happen to have had a huge canister still left from a cupcake frosting recipe I tried awhile back, so I tried the butter flavored crisco in the pan and it worked perfectly! Thank you for sharing Bonnie!

Turned out great. I used day old Jimmy Johns bread. Served with bacon, fruit and a fried egg. Power breakfast for busy Saturday complete!

I added a touch of clove, nutmeg and more cinnamon and vanilla. I used a really good sourdough bread and soaked it in between batches as it cooked to soften the bread. I was out of maple syrup, so a friend suggested honey. Yes and Yes. possibly the best french toast ever.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated but felt it needed a bit more sugar and salt as well as cinnamon for flavor. I upped these on my second batch and it was perfect! Doubled them all.

Great texture and flavor.  I was a little nervous with the flour in there, but it actually helped to spread out the cinnamon evenly so each bite had some.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This was my first time making French toast and this recipe was a big hit!  I doubled the cinnamon and vanilla, and I used heavy cream instead of whole milk.  My family loved it!  My husband almost never eats carbs, but it was so good he even got seconds!  I also used the thick Texas toast and let it really soak up the egg mixture before cooking it on medium heat with coconut oil.  Then I cooked up some sliced bananas in cinnamon, coconut oil, and vanilla, and put it on the French toast.  I will definitely be making this again!

I didn't have any cinnamon (it was MIA) but found the pumpkin pie spice, so I substituted it and it tasted great!! I also used a loaf of French bread from the bakery and cut my own slices. It turned out great!!

I've tried several French toasts and none has impressed me that much.  Of them, this one impresses me the most.  It's still not perfect, and I wish it had more of a kick, but again, of the French toasts out there, it wins.  Perhaps it's the flour and the resultant crisp?

Very tasty and easy! I mixed all the dry ingredients and then whisked in the wet ingredients. Just a tip - the alcohol in the vanilla breaks down the cinnamon, therefore, stir the vanilla and cinnamon together (I used a shot glass) thoroughly and add it to the mixture. Hope this is helpful.

I've been making French toast for a long time, but this was doubtlessly the best French toast I've ever had. The only changes I made were minor: I used very thick-sliced homemade whole wheat bread and also substituted whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour and used brown sugar instead of white. Otherwise, I followed the recipe precisely and couldn't be more pleased. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This is my go to french toast recipe,perfect every single time! I usually make it for 2 people and cut back the recipe for 3 servings, makes 4 french toast. I leave out the sugar and with maple syrup/fresh fruit/confectioners sugar it more than makes up for the missing sugar.

This is a wonderful recipe. The flour makes a batter that gives the french toast a custardy texture that I absolutely love. It is so worth trying and I plan to make this my go to recipe for french toast.

This was just okay.  The flour made the outside tough and kept the bread from absorbing much of the egg mixture.

I found this recipe tonight, and made it in 20 min for my kids for breakfast in the morning. They make fun of my cooking (two teenage girls and a pre-teen son) but I foresee a thumbs up in the morning when they are off to school. Even just a smile would make me happy. Thanks for the recipe. It is delish!!

I only had a little bit of milk and one egg left and searched for a breakfast recipe that would fit within those constraints. I discovered this and cut it down to four servings for myself and my two toddlers. Needless to say, this was a big hit! We added a sprinkle of nutmeg, whisked the mixture before dipping each new piece of bread, didn't let the bread soak too long, and enjoyed a yummy breakfast of fluffy French toast! This one is a keeper.

This was a nice change from the traditional egg, milk, cinnamon combo I usually default to. There wasn't a drastic difference but it just tasted better overall. Against my better judgement I "saturated" the Texas Toast and to my surprise it cooked through just fine on my griddle and was not soggy or mushy at all in the middle - perfectly done! My little kids ate them up, too. I didn't change any ingredients and followed the recipe step by step. I think I cooked these on my griddle at about 350 degrees.

Great, simple and tasty recipe! Recommendations by reviewer "MARIAHAN" were very helpful - used texas toast and froze leftovers for another day, which reheated really well.

After reading some reviews that claimed the cinnamon tends to disappear and that the flour sinks to the bottom needing the batter to be constantly whisked, I made a few procedural changes and the results were excellent. First, I sifted the flour, salt, and cinnamon into the bowl and whisked that while I slowly added the milk. I then proceeded to add each egg, whisking constantly, and after the second egg added the vanilla and finally brown sugar (which gives the batter a wonderful caramel taste) after the last egg. I used Villagio bread ( a thick white bread) and was able to stretch the batter to 9 slices. Served with organic maple syrup and fresh blueberries and sliced bananas, this was a real weekend breakfast treat.

Saturating regular bread in a mix with this much milk led to soggy French toast. Either you need to have thick, firm, dry bread, or just do a quick dip for regular stale bread. Towards the end of my cooking, I added more egg to the mix to see if that helped, and it was much better. Also added a dash of nutmeg for the last few slices which was a good recommendation from another reviewer. Temp on a griddle should be 300-325.

I just did one serving of this with an eyeball measuring method. I ended up with a creamy mixture, like melted ice cream. I heated up a pad of butter in the skillet until it was bubbling and then cooked the toast in it, it was crispy, golden and delicious! Used thick sliced white bakery bread... the best french toast ive ever had! Doing this over and over again!

This is a fantastic recipe! My children have started giving me a hard time about whole grain breads. Even when I make french toast with them. Well I tried this recipe with a Quinoa and flax seed bread, and was waiting to hear the usual complaints. Not a peep out of them other then asking for more!!

I think this recipe tasted OK, however it took a while to cook and STILL came out a little soggy. I think that the key isn't necessarily to use a THICK bread, but rather a dense one ( challah was recommended, will try that next time). overall, though, this recipe beat my previous one, and even my son, who is the pickiest eater EVER, thought it was good.

I've made it about a dozen times, and it's been great every time. I recommend honey wheat bread. If you need more servings, add an extra egg. Also, putting the cinnamon on the toast while it's on the griddle works best for making all the slices even. Otherwise, the first slice will have a lot of cinnamon, and the last will have very little.

Perfect french toast! I followed the recipe almost exactly, only left out cinnamon (not a fan) & used turbinado sugar & these turned out great. I made the whole french loaf & popped 1 or 2 at a time in the toaster oven & they were delicious & perfect, slightly crispy on the outside (due to the flour maybe?) & nice & custard-y on the inside. My bf, who is waaay picky said he loved them & still talks about them. I also tried making this recipe with italian bread since the local store was sold out of french & they were not the same & the bf was not impressed. I really think the real french bread is the perfect texture for french toast, thus the name, french toast!

We used day old French bread and mixed it in the blender, so the cinnamon floating at the top was not an issue as it was with some reviewers. We loved it and will use this recipe every time we make French Toast. Delicious!

Very tasty, very easy. Key is definitely to use thick-cut bread (which I didn't do the first time and ended up with soggy French toast). Next time I'll up the cinnamon and add a bit of nutmeg.

I love this recipe. I've searched for a good French toast recipe for a long time and this is the best one. If you use Texas toast, it works really well. Simple to prep and simple to fix, but just as good, if not better than what you'd get from a lot of restaurants. I think the flour is really the key to it all.

The secret is the flour! I use Italian bread. Sometimes I make the night before and let it soak overnight.
I use an electric griddle to cook them all at the same time. I double the amount of vanilla. P-E-R-F-E-C-T

Egg / Milk Free Variation - Awesome!  My son has milk and egg allergies.  I followed the recipe but substituted rice milk for milk (Almond or Soy could be used also but Rice is sweeter) and I used a ground flax seed and water mixture as an egg substitute (1 tbl spoon ground flax to 3 tbl spoons water, whisk and let stand for a few minutes until thick, whisk again and use as egg).  I also used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose white.  It turned out great but I will use more cinnamon and vanilla in the future as the flax and ww flour neutralize the taste a little.  (I didn't use maple syrup with mine so would have liked more of the other flavors however my brother did use maple syrup and said is was fine as is).  WILL make this again!

Just the right fluffiness and balance of cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla. Since I'm a cinnamon lover I doubled the cinnamon.

I adjusted recipe down to 4 slices and worked out great



I have been making french toast everyday and sometimes at night for the past couple months as I've been on a big kick, and only being able to eat soft foods.. french toast is near the top of the list of things to eat :P   

This turned out better than the traditional milk+ eggs recipe and left me with a full and happy stomach.

just made this recipe and it was a huge hit. I hate pancakes and was looking for a way to jazz up things like French toast or waffles and came across this recipe. Even my husband loved the French toast and he is an extremely picky eater. I would add a photo but its all gone!

Wow. This was wonderful! I made a portion for me and my niece and we both gobbled it up right away. The only thing I did wrong (IMO) is that I used salted butter. I forgot to buy non-salted butter so didn't have that in the fridge. But it still turned out so moist and delicious; ate it with powdered sugar and honey. Definitely a Yum Yum. :D

I just finshed this recipe and the only thing I did different was add a little nutmeg and added a tad bit more sugar. I must say it is not my favorite but thanks for sharing.

It's actually really good when you mix this recipe with the deep fried french toast recipe. I increased the milk to 1 1/2 cups, 1 tsp of ground cinnamon, 2 tsp of vanilla extract and used brown sugar instead of white. It was absolutely amazing because of the flour mixture and deep frying put it over the top. The southerner in me felt completely satisfied. Also I used the butter pecan syrup from ihop instead of regular maple syrup...talk about mouth explosion WOW! I will use this recipe everytime!

Better than any I've made on my own before. As advised in another review, I also used Crisco to fry these and it worked better than butter! I'm not a huge cinnamon fan, so next time I think I would omit it and double the vanilla and maybe add another egg for more egg flavor.

I've only made French toast one other time before finding this recipe and it was disastrous. This recipe was perfect! Turned out perfect and was super easy. I love the cinnamon and sweetness of this recipe. Its tasty, easy, and great for beginner cooks like myself! This recipe is a winner!

I have never used a recipe for french toast before, but I have also never seen a recipe that uses flour! I tried this recipe as is, no changes and it was sooo good! This is how I am making french toast from now on! Both my kiddos gobbled it up and asked for seconds!

I have made this recipe probably 50 times already. This is by far the best flavored French toast. My five year old is the pickiest eater and she will eat until she is sick (if I would let her)when I make this and she ask for it all the time.  Thank you for the recipe. I wont make French toast any other way now.

I made this this morning for breakfast...and it was a total HIT! But I like some of the others did make some measurement adjustments; I doubled the vanilla and cinnamon. And we wanted ours sweeter, so therefore I stepped up the sugar to 6 T instead of a just tablespoon. ...And it was really good, and therefore it didn't require as much syrup or powdered sugar. I will be making this my Go To French Toast recipe from now on! Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This is a good recipe for french toast. It wasn't soggy at all. I had to reduce the recipe to make only 4 servings, and didn't have a 1/8 tsp for the cinnamon, so I had to estimate it in a 1/4 tsp. I may have added a little bit more than what it called for, but it was good!  My 7 yr old son loved it :)

Yum. This recipe is delish!   I used challah bread and cut the pieces into french toast sticks instead of slices.  I feel the sticks cook through better and are crispier than whole slices.

This recipe is awesome. My picky 5 yr old who swears he does not eat bread kept calling it pancakes just so he can eat it. I took another reviewers suggestion and added 1/2 ripe banana. Delish! Keeper

This morning I had a crew of 6 young men, hungry as bears and one of them said to my son... "Would your Mom make us French Toast?" My son said .. "yes, but its not very good".  Well that was the challenge of a lifetime.... I told no-one what I was doing and I ran for Allrecipes and searched French Toast... thankfully this one had a video (because truthfully.. I did make 'bad' french toast).  I used it and loved it and have since been crowned "Queen of the French Toasters".   Very high praise indeed!! My only regret was that I didnt capture those smiles on camera! Bonnie, thank you very much for this amazing recipe.

This was really good, the flour was unexpected, but kept the bread from getting soggy.  I'd probably add more vanilla and cinnamon next time due to personal taste, but we still really enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing!

Hmmm....I'm not convinced that the flour really added anything.  It was difficult to get it to mix in.  Probably wouldn't make it this way again.

This was wonderful! I used cinnamon toast instead of regular bread. Better than a restaurant!

Good recipe overall.  Especially if you don't have the cream on hand for the French Toast Stars recipe, which I believe to be the best.  I will use this recipe again though, because it was good, I usually have ingredients on hand, and it was lower cal than the other.  Thank you for a very good recipe!

I make mine exactly the same way except I use potato bread and use cake mix instead of plain flour. Try it using cake mix, it's delicious!

This is an awesome recipe for french toast.  Usually I think french toast can be too eggy, but this was perfect!  I did not change a thing with the recipe either.

I love French Toast, it was one of the first things I learned to cook for myself when I was a kid. I stopped using a recipe years ago. Hubby surprised me with this French Toast for breakfast this morning, and it is fabulous! I've never added flour to the batter, and it definitely made it more fluffy. This will be my standard method for making French toast from now on.

This recipe was so good. I ate it with some strawberries and its so amazing. The only thing that needs improvement is the cinnamon. It needs a little bit more. But still very good.

Wow, this is very very good. I did add 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tbsp brown sugar. This does not make 12 slices of thick french toast. Only made 8 for me.

This is the absolute best french toast I've ever had, at home or elsewhere. For years I wouldn't make french toast as it would never turn out correctly, always too wet (like an omelette with a piece of bread in the middle, would be a fair exaggeration). I've made this recipe several times now and it has consistently been perfect, the flour really makes the batter become nice once it's cooked. I cook it in butter and top it with maple syrup and a little more butter and it's always perfect, thanks so much for the amazing recipe!

We liked this a lot. Made twice already once with regular bread and the second time with thick bread as suggested. Both were really good. I would like to try adding more flour for an even thicker coating :). 

Very good, thanks for sharing.

Just finished eating this - it's great! I made the Portugese sweet bread (this site) last week, just to use for this french toast, and it was worth it! I cut the slices about an inch thick, soaked them & fried slowly so they'd be done in the middle. To serve, I slathered on oleo, poking slits so the butter could soak in better. Drizzled with butter-flavored syrup and WOW! I'd be cleaning up the kitchen now, but am too full (couldn't stop eating!) Thanks for a great recipe! (I left out cinnamon & upped sugar to 1.5Tbsp)

I used this recipe for a family breakfast and it turned out fantastic. It was my first time attempting to make french toast and I was told it was the best they'd ever had! I topped these bad boys with some powdered sugar and defrosted mixed berries. Thanks!

I made this for my two teens and my son's teenage friend for the first day of school breakfast.  We all agreed it was delicious!  I used french bread and a few were a little soggy but the flavor was outstanding!  Next time I will buy the texas toast type bread.  Looking forward to making this again!

My whole family of picky eaters loved this!  This was my first successful batch of french toast as usually it comes out soggy.  I used a loaf of wheat french bread that I sliced into thick slices.  I doubled the cinnamon and the vanilla and added a TBS of brown sugar as other reviewers suggested.  I served with syrup, powdered sugar, and sliced strawberries.  It was so good!

I was really excited to try this, as while I am happy with my current French toast recipe, I loved the idea of doing a fluffier version.  Alas, while I followed the recipe exactly, it didn't do a thing for us.  The flour actually seemed to dry it out a little, rather than make it fluffier.  Perhaps I made a mistake somewhere in the cooking process?  Whatever the case, I will be sticking with my old recipe.  Thank you for the chance to experiment, though!

I absolutely loved this French toast because you can tweak the ingredience to your liking. The first time I made it I used the recipe to the t and came out great. 2nd time I added a bit more sugar and cinnamon and it was even better!

Very good....I used regular old white sandwich bread...I did add nutmeg because I love nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of butter flavoring.  I did not have AP flour so used self rising flour which made it more crispy over fluffy which is what we prefer. I got 13 servings instead of 12 maybe because my bread was thinner??? I will never make French Toast any other way. We are going to a remote cabin this weekend with friends and I am going to pre-make the batter to take with us.

Great french toast recipe. The secret ingredient is definitely the flour. It really helps keep the bread fluffy. My husband loves French Toast, and this has become one of his favorites!

I love this recipe!!! This is the perfect recipe for French Toast!! I get compliments from everyone who tries it! I always make 3 or 4 batches and then freeze the leftovers so that we have ready-to-eat french toast before school/work :)

It's the flour. It makes this toast fluffy and delish! I sprinkle more cinnamon as I go, because it seems to all go on the first dipped slice if I don't. Made twice already and the family loves it!

This was great-a nice way to keep french toast flavorful but not soggy! I did have a bit of an issue with clumps of flour-I think I just need a new whisk :P Luckily, flour clumps don't taste that bad ;) I added double the cinnamon to the mixture, then while the bread was soaking I sprinkled more on top and put that side down in the pan and sprinkled the other side before I flipped it. It made the appearance less even, but hopefully enhanced the flavor. I topped with powdered sugar and syrup. Delicious!

Great tasting french toast! It has just the right amount of cinnamon. It tastes great with syrup or powdered sugar. I would recommend cooking the slices until they're all brown to make sure they're cooked all the way. A keeper!

So yummy!  We made this for my daughters 8th birthday breakfast and everyone LOVED it. We have six children and have tried many french toast recipes.  This one will be added to our recipe favorites for sure!  The only alternations made were- 1.5 tsp vanilla, 2 tsp cinnamon and sliced french bread.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe

I tried this out this past weekend for my housewarming brunch and the recipe turned out to be amazing quick & easy to make. I wasn't fully confident of the taste but all of my guests loved it. I really liked the soft fluffy texture of this toast. I would highly recommend this! Also, I used regular white bread, which was fine. I might try with brioche, raisin, or egg bread next time.

YUM!  I used my favorite bread from the recipe "Simply White Bread II" to make this and it turned out AMAZING! The only thing that I would change about this recipe is to DOUBLE it because everyone wanted more.

I love this recipe. It is delicious. The only thing I recommend is to add more vanilla extract. I added about an extra tsp. my whole family loved it and it freezes real well and is still delish in the toaster the next day. Thank you!

I used Cinnabon bread.  I added a little extra vanilla and less cinnamon (because of the bread).  I thought it turned out fabulous.  My 15 month old ate three pieces!

Delicious french toast! I make homemade brioche a few days ahead when I know I will be making this. I also use a tad bit more vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. Sometimes I use pumpkin pie spice and it tastes oh so good!

Absolutely amazing recipe! I have my husband grade the foods I cook for us on a 1-10 scale.  He gave this one a "9" & believe me he's honest about what he thinks, which I prefer he be or he'd end up eating his not so favorite foods again! Haha! One comment though I do have is that I scaled the recipe to 8 servings but used only 6 pieces of bread & had to skimp on the egg mixture for the 6th piece so I either soaked up too much egg or the recipe is a bit stingy with the amount allotted per piece of bread.  Otherwise, I thought the recipe was a definite keeper!!!

This is definitely in my favorites. It is warm and very good to enjoy with a side of eggs. I usually do not like it when my french toast is soggy inside, but the way this is, it is very good. I don't want to call it soggy, but moist. This is a dish I would recommend.

I definitely liked this recipe.  The bread I used was probably not sliced thick enough, so I will make sure to use thicker cut bread next time.  I also don't think I let the bread soak in the egg mixture long enough, either.  It smells and tasted great, though!

It tasted good, and was VERY filling (2 slices was enough) however it turned out kind of soggy and not as crispy as I would have liked. It was a little bit floppy too. I had to cook it in LOTS of oil for it to become crispy. Wouldn't try again but good for my first try at french toast.

This was very good - the flour really helps the bread stay firm instead of getting mushy.

This recipe is very good. I made it with challah bread.  another post made mention that when they used challah it was a bit dry. I semi-squeezed the bread like a sponge to purge the air out and saturate the bread. It came out perfect! I want to try this with egg nog instead of milk net xt time.
Thank you Bonnie!

WOW!! This was fantastic. I used egg bread and thick sliced, as noted also brown sugar instead of white. It was better than I ever have had..my 
Husband was amazed by it and said a "keeper.". It was so rich did not need butter just syrup.

Thumbs up from the whole family. I used a round sourdough loaf and sliced it pretty thick. It was just the right amount of moisture. Not soggy or dry. I think that you need to let each slice sit in the mixture a little bit to get it saturated on the inside too. This will now be my go to recipe for french toast.

Just made this for breakfast - my husband said it was really good. I doubled the Cinnamon just because we love Cinnamon. Good recipe  and I love that it's not got any "wild" ingredients you have to go to the store and get. Thank you for sharing.

This french toast is soooooo good! The cinnamon is so delicious. I made a few variations to this recipe. I used a little more cinnamon, and since the recipe did not specify which bread to use, I used whole wheat. I also added a little more sugar in the better to compensate for the savoriness of the bread. Still this toast turned out so fluffy. definitely  a keeper. The only thing i am warning you about is to whisk in the ingredients in the order listed ( flour does not dissolve into eggs LOL)

This was delish! I was worried using so much milk... but it was fluffy. I ened up using more sugar b/c after I added the sugar realized  I didn't have any cinnamon exect some cinnamon and sugar mixed up so I added that.

This was my first attempt at French Toast, and I made it for guests this morning.  I used homemade bread (no-knead white bread) that was fresh from the oven, and it was excellent.  It was tender inside and the chewy crust was a perfect texture complement.  I added a pinch more cinnamon, but otherwise followed the recipe.

Very yummy...my 6 year old loved it!  Good advice from others to stir the mix every time you dip more bread as the cinnamon and flour settles on bottom.  Will use this recipe from now on.

This was the best French toast recipe  I've ever used, probably because of the flour, they were super fluffy and not too "eggy"---when making this recipe don't worry if the flour appears a little lumpy after you beat the mixture because it turns out great in the end!!

This was good.  The only problem I had is that the flour sunk to the bottom. I'm not sure if it was because I didn't mix it well enough or not.  But the taste was good.  I added a little maple extract to it and used the french bread recipe from this site.

My family LOVED this recipe! I found mixing the dry ingredients together first kept the cinnamon from floating to the top. Also mixing the wet ingredients until its frothy kept the flour from sinking to the bottom. Other than that it tasted great, it was fluffy like the recipe said and I will be using this recipe again and again.

Very good!  I added about 2 tablespoons of warmed honey to the liquid mix, and used french bread...  VERY VERY YUMMY!  This was the first recipe i've used that involves flour, and i really liked it!  Its not too sweet, just sweet enough... and its so good you don't really even need syrup.  I'm making it again tonight for dinner.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I usually don't use a recipe for French Toast, but I wanted something special. This recipe was great! Very sweet, but isn't that why you have French Toast?! Will make again for sure.

My entire family loves this recipe.  I think the key is the flour.  I mix it each time in between dipping the bread or the flour settles on the bottom of the bowl.  I do make a batch and a half which works well with 1 loaf of Texas Toast bread (16-18 slices).  This recipe is similar to my old recipe except for the flour.  This is a keeper!

Fantastic recipe! I've been making basic French toast since I was 8 years old and I never heard of putting flour into the mixture... It truly makes a difference though! I find it helps distribute the cinnamon evenly.

I had my doubts about this recipe - flour in french toast?? Well, added a pinch of nutmeg and mace, used brown sugar and it was outstanding! Helpful hint - whisk lightly between coating bread slices, the flour does drift to the bottom of the mixture.

Great recipe.  Very easy and tasty.  One tip though, if your scaling it down by pieces of toast you are making, add one just so you have enough of the custard for your last piece of bread.

One thing to say OMG!! Great recipe, I combined all the dry ingredients together, then the wet with a wisk, then slowly added the wet to the dry. Keep whisking the mixture as some reviews say, flour tends to settle on the bottom. Great taste and scales very easy to just 1 person, I will never make another French Toast, I made this exactly as it says ( ingredient wise) as I feel that is the only way to truly rate a recipe. Next time I will add some nutmeg or more cinnamon, just my preference.

One of the best french toast recipes I've ever had at home!  Like others have stated, along with adding the cinnamon to the mix, I also put a little on one side of the uncooked toast side for a little more cinnamon flavor.

Great recipe! I adjusted the recipe to only serving 2 adults and eye balled ingredients instead of measuring. I also substituted pumpkin spice liquid coffee cream for part of the milk to add seasonal flavor. This french toast turned out wonderful and very fluffy! I'll definitely be keeping this recipe.

Great recipe! I used sourdough bread instead of French and it was just as good. Maybe even a bit better.

This recipe turned out really good. The end result is not very sweet, so I added syrup to mine. My 2year old loved it plain. If she is happy, then I am happy.

This French toast really did turn out light and fluffy, and was really delicious. After looking at a whole bunch of recipes, I decided to add some orange juice to the mixture which tasted really nice too. I've never added flour to French toast before but it seemed to turn out really well.

This is a great French Toast recipe. I used cinnamon swirl bread, so I left the cinnamon out of the batter. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great, especially with maple syrup. This will be our new French Toast recipe - next time, I will try it with Challah bread.

This had become a staple in my husband's "cookbook". I fell in love with this French toast the very first time he made it! It's has a nice flavor (doesn't taste like egg bread). I look forward to this french toast for many years it decades to come.

I made this according to the recipe with the only changes being that I eyeballed the amount of cinnamon I put in it. I also added a little nutmeg. Best french toast recipe I've made so far.

I had to rate this low because I followed the directions exactly and thought that this was actually quite bland. And although pretty fluffy, there was no inital crunch on the top. I did however take another reviews advice and sprinkle the cinnamon on both sides when I cooked them. I also added a extra teaspoon of sugar to the second batch I made due to there being no flavor. Tasted much better but I don't think I'll ever make this again.

Love this recipe!  I use pioneer woman's cinnamon bread recipe and am in heaven every time I eat it.  I always double both recipes and freeze the leftovers for fast breakfasts during the week.  Because I do the recipe with cinnamon bread, I do omit the cinnamon in the french toast recipe.

Delicious. I used an extra egg and had no vanilla: still great. Served with a smearing of butter and some drizzled cajeta (sort of caramel) sauce. YUM. Great use for otherwise useless white bread loaf left at our house.

Oh my goodness, is this yummy!  I used 1" thick french bread, left out the cinnamon, and cooked it in butter.  Everything's better in butter, right?  I will definitely be making this for years to come.

Thanks for helping me knock Sunday morning breakfast out of the park!

I used this Fluffy French Toast recipe along with another AllRecipes contributor Palsar7's Most Amazing Challah.

Wow, seriously.  Something about the two recipes together helped me channel Grand Ma, I know some of you know what I'm talking about.

Cooking food like this for your family and understanding the totality of what it means is some of what I enjoy most about my time in the kitchen.  Recipes like this help elevate my offerings.

Thanks you for posting and thank you to the others who reviewed this and shared their experiences with it, I found them to be quite valuable.

Great recipe, it is not soggy in the middle.  I have made it twice, once with regular sliced bread, the second time with Texas Toast.  Both times it came out great.  I also sprinkled the bread with Rolled Oates after I soaked it.  That is how they make it at Junior's in Brooklyn.  Its never come out right with other recipes, this time it was great!

This is terrific!  I made it exactly as the recipe called... cooked on electric griddle (with lid on) at 325 for 5-6 min. a side (at least).  
For a topping I mixed whipping cream, 1 c powdered sugar, 1/2 c cream cheese, and vanilla... and a bowl of choc chips.  
Kids said it was the best dinner ever... :D  
THANKS BONNIE!

Made this exactly as stated and this is the best french toast I have ever made which I never did a good job making french toast but this was even better than any restaurant french toast I have eaten.  I used homemade bread from bread machine.  I wouldn't call them fluffy because homemade bread in a machine is dense...but I loved the texture.  Thank you for such a fab recipe!

Followed it as is and makes perfect French toast!  Stir up the batter after each bread.  I used Iron Kids and was able to make 9 toasts.  I also saved the batter in the fridge and made it thr next day.  Saved the recipe for more Saturdays!

I should start by saying that I normally don't care for French toast- it's usually too mushy for me. But this recipe I loved. I followed the recipe except for one thing... I didn't realize I was out of milk until I had already started making this so I used Creme Brulee flavored coffe creamer instead. It tasted great. The next time I made this I used the creamer again but I  didn't add sugar and I didn't even miss it. My husband and 3 kids love this French toast.

This turned out better than I thought. It was fluffy and tasted good. I added more cinnamon and added brown sugar instead of white sugar.

Delicious!  Made exactly as specified.  Best to cook on low heat for the golden touch, otherwise it burnt quickly.

I used almond extract instead of vanilla. It was a nice twist to an old favorite. My family loved it.

I wasn't a fan of this at all.  I'm not sure if I cut the bread too think, but it was raw inside after on the grill for a LONG time.  The flour didn't seem to mix real well either.  Won't be makign this recipe again.

This recipe was the best french toast I have had in a long time. I used fresh oatmeal bread and doubled the amount of cinnamon.  I also used butter, nut and rum flavoring instead of vanilla extract.  Yummy!

I didn't use thick slice bread... that's perhaps why it isn't fluffy. But taste wise, I didn't think it tasted any different from other french toast recipes here...

It had a good flavor, much like my own, without the nutmeg, but even with cooking longer, the center was still runny. I had to microwave the pieces to get the centers fluffy, and especially for my babies!!!

Really good flavor and they were nice and fluffy!  I didn't find that I had enough of the milk mixture, only enough for 6 slices of regular white bread.  Had to mix up more mid-way, now I know to double it :)

I also have had trouble with soggy French toast in the past, but this recipe was wonderful! I doubled the cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, but other than that, I followed it exactly. I used Texas toast, and it yielded 8 pieces. This will be my new go-to French toast recipe from now on.

Everyone in my family loved this french toast recipe. We topped it with strawberries and whipped cream. Delicious! I'm thinking I can always make extras and freeze them. Then you thaw it a little and pop them in the toaster. This will definitely be added to our weekly menu.  Thank you!

This recipe was very good, although I didn't see much of a contrast from a regular French toast recipe. I used thick slices of challah bread, therefore more of the egg mixture was needed than the recipe stated.  The hints of the vanilla and cinnamon were not overpowering, so if you prefer a more highly-flavored French toast,  I would add additional flavorings.  This is a good basic French toast recipe.

This was good, but not great. I added a little nutmeg and extra vanilla, and I subbed brown sugar for white. The flavor was good, but it turned out dense and kind of soggy in the middle. I was only able to get 8 pieces of regular toast. If I try this recipe again, I will use thicker bread and just dip it in the batter instead of soaking it.

BEST French Toast receipe ever! Made this for the first time at our Mother's Day Sunday brunch and it was a hit! I tweaked the original receipe a bit by adding bananas (suggested by another user) and a capsule of Godiva chocolate liquor!

This recipe turned out an excellent batch of French toast.  I even made a separate batch using Silk Very Vanilla soy milk for my son who is allergic to milk with perfect results. This ones definitely going in the Diaz family cookbook.

This recipe was delicious!  I added some brown sugar in addition to the regular sugar.  I think it goes well with the cinnamon and just makes it a little bit sweeter.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.  This recipe really solves the soggy in the middle problem I've always had with french toast.  Some other reviews said it was a little bland, so I replaced 1/4 cup of the milk with 1/4 cup of orange juice (accoring to another recipe I've used), and it came out great.  The OJ just adds a little extra without overpowering the flavor.

Great French toast recipe! I used slightly stale buns that I cut then ends off of, and they worked perfectly (trying to use up food in the fridge). Of note, I used a bit of canola oil AND butter in the pan, and it worked really well: crispy outside, nice inside. A keeper!

I used wheat flour and allrecipes Peasant Bread.  This tasted amazing.  I did double the cinnamon.  I made the 8 serving version to make 3 slices each for my husband and I.  This took about 5-10 mins each side on medium.  YUM!

This was a very good french toast recipe and I will definitely make it again. However, soaking the bread in the mixture made it too soggy--once I started just making sure each side was covered, it was much better. Served this with buttermilk syrup and strawberries. Delicious!

I doubled the cinnamon as others suggested.  This was some of the best tasting home made French toast I've ever tasted.  I made it with Texas Toast and was not really happy with the bread.  Next time I will try Challah bread as others have suggested.  But overall it was very good!

Great recipe....I used buttermilk and the toast came out with a great flavor.  I'll try to freeze some of the leftovers like suggested by a previous post so my son can just pop them in the toaster for a quick breakfast before school.  Thanks.

This was the yummiest french toast we've ever tried.  Very close to a restuarant dish.  I added double amount of cinnamon and didn't have any vanilla and it turned out great.  Love having sliced bananas on top; would try a sprinkle of raisins next time. Thanks!

The flour definitely makes this recipe!!! It adds a texture to the french toast that gives it that crunch without it being soggy like regular french toast. I also made this with a homemade bread recipe from this site (Challah I) and let me just say I will NEVER eat regular french toast again!!

Made as-is, this was the best french toast we have ever eaten! We used thick sliced french bread, and topped with toasted slivered almonds & coconut. Served with fruit (kiwi, strawberry, blackberries), and a spoon of whipped cream.

The flour makes a difference. it makes the outside brown like kids like to see since it looks like the restaurants. Not any more effort than how I used to do it. I will be adding flour from now on. Next time I may add one more egg for the protein.

Made this for breakfast this morning.  My husband loved it! Adjusted the recipe for 6 instead of 12 and added some nutmeg.  Next time will use either thicker or day old bread.

Although the French Toast tasted delicious, I didn't find that it was any fluffier than the French Toast I usually make which doesn't contain flour or sugar. I don't think it tasted any better either.  I wouldn't  bother with this recipe again.

I was very impressed with how this came out.  I have never used a "recipe" to make french toast, but I will now always use this one.  The only change I made was adding 2 extra eggs after I tasted the first piece.  Try this one, I think you will be pleasantly pleased.

This was very good but not ground breaking. I do think that the batter needs more cinnamon... and if some of you are having trouble with soggy FT, then leave a lid on for one minute at a time (then check it) so the toast cooks from the top along with the bottom/pan. I guess I'm still on the hunt for THE BEST French toast recipe.

Perfect recipe, totally restaurant quality. Cutting the recipe is easy and the proportions stay usable, not too much not too little. They only thing I substituted was brown sugar for white. Other than that I made the recipe for 4 and loved it. My son, who doesn't like bread, ate half a piece. That's sayin somethin!

Very yummy recipe! I did add a little more vanilla and cinnamon than what it called for b/c my husband and I love that stuff. :) It did turn out a little fluffier than the french toast we normally make. Thanks for sharing!

This is delicious...I am eating it now.  Very simple and quick, first time I have made french toast...now I will make it more often for my family.  I used regular wheat sandwich bread and it still came out great.  I was able to get 10 slices with the batter.

Fabulous recipe!  I made this Christmas morning for my family and they loved it!  I made just as directed and used Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Swirl bread.  I served it with sliced bananas and pure maple syrup.  Sooooo good!  Will be making again and again.

Tastes just like restaurant!!! Be forewarned though, I cut the recipe in 1/2 since there are only 3 of us, and I only got three - 4 pieces of bread, so next time will make the whole thing!!!

Not very impressed.  I only had regular whole wheat bread instead of thick bread.  I let the slices soak in it as instructed and it only made 6 slices (which was fine, we're a family of 3).  And It was soggy on the inside, but if I had let them cook longer the bread would have been burned instead of brown.  Haha But it was a good taste, all in all

I love this french toast recipe. It is a lot less soggy than most french toasts. It reminds me of the french toast sticks I used to have as a kid. I found that when using homemade bread this recipe only makes about 5 pieces, not 12, so be sure to double it.

This french toast was good except that the flour settled at the bottom of the bowl and it didnt  seem to be enough mixture for 12 big slices, mine was a tad bit dry.

These did not turn out well at all.  They were way too soggy and I couldn't get them to cook all the way through so the bread was fluffy.  Taste was fine, but they definitely weren't fluffy.

This recipe is good, but I think is deserves not more than 3 stars. After reading some reviews I expected it to be awesome and better than the other recipes, but it isn't. It tastes like a bunch of other French Toast recipes. But I have to admit that I did half a batch, because I didn't want to make 12. During the next few days I am going to try it again with a whole batch.

edit: after doing a whole batch, it turned out better, but still didn't blow me away.

This French Toast is one of the best I have tasted but you can't let them sit in the batter too long or they get soggy.

Great French Toast recipe!  Instead of milk, I use half and half, and I add about 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg to the batter.  Hubby agrees that these were 5 stars :~)

This French Toast was the BEST I've ever made or had! We couldn't stop eating it! The flour makes all the difference! You should definitely wish between dipping pieces as the cinnamon falls to the bottom.

Delicious. This will be my go to recipe. I didn't add salt-never do-and I used brown sugar instead of white. I also just sprinkled cinnamon on each piece instead of whisking it in the mixture. My last addition was an extra teaspoon on vanilla:)

This french toast is great! Very easy to make.. it was my first attempt and it came out GREAT! I have some extra stored to reheat later. I will be making this again. The cinnamon does tend to sink to the bottom, but just whisk it and it will bring it right up to the top!

Perfect!  Like a few of the reviews stated...whisk the mixture each time just before you add another slice of bread to it- all the good stuff falls to the bottom and will stay in your bowl if you don't!...and soak the bread (I used Texas Toast) longer than you normally would; SUPERB!!

I made this for me and my boyfriend and we both LOVE it.  Definitely using this now on for our french toast recipe.  It really does make the bread kind of fluffy and the centers don't get saturated and mushy.  Very yummy!

I used Italian bread that I sliced about 1/2 inch thick or so. My son likes cinnamon so we added 1/2 tablespoon.The vanilla I increased to 1 1/2 teaspoons. I added about 1/2 tablespoon of oil to  my electric skillet, spreading it with a folded paper towel, wiping the skillet after each batch was done. I also stirred the batter every once in a while. My kids said the same as a lot of people reviewed, they were fluffy! They  gave the recipe 5 stars. This will be the only way I make French toast from now on!

I made this using homemade whole wheat bread and it turned out wonderful!  I did not use the cinnamon in the mixture, I sprinkled it on while it was on the griddle.  Other than that I used the recipe exactly as written.  I take a slice to work with me for breakfast in the mornings, it doesn't need syrup or anything.

I think this recipe really depends on the quality of the bread used.  I have used it with whole wheat and it was not as good as the big slices of texas toast, or leftover challah.  One tip: you need to do the ingredients in order - I didn't have enough, and added the egg too soon on the second batch my first time and it was very clumpy.  Never got all the flour incorporated.  I'd also recommend more cinnamon, if you want to actually taste it.  We couldn't.  A good french toast recipe overall, though.

I made it with homemade white bread and followed the instructions almost exactly (whisked after each piece of bread and added more cinnamon as the batter was used up).  My husband is a good cook and hard to please - he said it was the best french toast he ever had.  Even called it "picture worthy" - next time I will take a picture!  :)  Delicious!

YUMMY!  Made as written, with the exception of sprinkling on cinn. while on griddle.  VERY GOOD!  Really liked the fluffiness on bread verses the regular egg + bit of milk that I normally put bread in.

This was as good as any restaurant french toast. I did change the flour to gluten free pancake mix, and it was perfect.  So if you have a gluten problem this is for you.

Good but nothing special. I like my old recipe better and easier. Not enough liquid to soak 12 slices of thick bread. Might try it again with modifications.

As the mother of 6 boys, I am always on the look out for crowd pleasing recipes.  I made this for supper using Texas toast.  It made 20 slices (doubled recipe).  My boys inhaled it in about 3 minutes!

This was pretty good.   I don't think I "saturated" the slices enough though.  It tasted pretty much like my regular french toast so I will try again and let them soak up a bit more this time.  I can see needing more mixture though in order to do that and get 12.  Thanks for sharing new ideas.

This was sooo good!  The vanilla made such a great flavor.  I used Texas toast which makes a big difference over regular bread.

very good recipe!  thanks for sharing.  my only gripe is that i had little clumps of flour that wouldn't whisk out for the life of me!  next time i will probably sift the flour (but who sifts flour anymore, really?).  the flavor was very good, but for the sake of nostalgia i still prefer my mom's recipe :)

This is the BEST french toast recipe. I am a breakfast food fanatic and have been using this recipe for years.  The only change I make is to add just a tad more flour so that the french toast is coated evenly.  Definately a keeper :-)

one word, AWESOME!  Make sure you use a fast beater to get the flour to mix.  I tried hand mixing it and the flour was still clumpy.  If you have a kitchen aid with the whipping attachment that will work perfect!

This is the best French toast recipe ever! My entire family loved it and said it was better than in restaurants! Most recipes I've tried just taste like bread dipped in eggs. This is not the case at all! -- I've used both Texas toast and just regular bread. Either way is fantastic! Excellent!!!

Very tasty, but the flour all seemed to sit at the bottom of the mix.  Maybe that's why mine wasn't that fluffy.  Otherwise, good recipe.

I used the wrong kind of bread (Arnold's whole wheat) but that's all I had one morning.  Everyone woke up to the awesome smell and they said it tasted fantastic.  I can't taste much these days since I'm going through chemo but they tell me the taste was definitely there and to use Challah bread or potato bread next time.

I don't have one negative thing to say about this recipe! My 2 kids, hubby and I all loved it.  I need to double it for my family of 4, which allows for a few leftovers, but one recipe isn't enough for 4 people. The flour did not mix thoroughly, so the batter is lumpy, but that doesn't affect the outcome :) Thanks for the recipe!

Did you know you can save cooled french toast in ziploc bags, freeze, and later pull out what you need and put them in the toaster? One of my favorite fast meals!

This tasted pretty good. I made these for Mother's Day and my mom said that she really enjoyed them. I threw on some pecans, also. For me it took me a while to get them to not be soggy (I had to fry them twice). Overall, quite good!

It was yummy, but it tasted just like my regular french toast recipe, so I probably won't use it again.   I doubled the recipe and it was just enough for 20 slices.

Both my son and my husband said this is the best french toast they've ever eaten.  My only recommendation is not to soak the bread too long or it will be soggy.  I even covered the pan and it still didn't cook through.  But when just soaked for a few seconds it turned out great!

I make this all the time, and it really does come out fluffier than any other French Toast recipe I've tried.  I usually use stale French bread, and it always comes out great.  You definitely do need to stir the batter often though because I've had problems with the dry ingredients sinking to the bottom.

Son now 13 and this still one of his favorites.  Just made with bakery raisin bread.  Yummy.



So yummy. My 11 year old son took some off my plate he liked so much. I actually used fresh buns from night before and they worked out awesome.  Just wanted to use them up.

While this certainly is not the most "gourmet" French toast recipe, it is very good bang-for-the-buck (as well as effort).  Keep mixing the egg mixture regularly between slices to keep the dry ingredients from settling to the bottom.  French toast is on of my boyfriend's favorite foods, and he loved this one!  We made it by the book, halving the recipe for the two of us and it turned out just fine.

This French toast was good, but I didn't think the addition of flour made much difference from other recipes I've tried.  I did find that putting the batter in a pie plate made dipping much easier.

GREAT French Toast!!!  I adjusted the recpe for 4 servings and allowed Allrecipes to adjust the amounts.  Then I followed the recipe exactly.  This was the BEST French Toast I have ever made.  It was very fluffy adding volume and texture to ordinary bread.  This is a keeper!

I use this as the base for any french toast dish that I make regardless of how I decide to customize it.  The flour really makes the dish.  One note for any novice (like myself) - mix the flour and milk before adding the eggs.  Significantly less lumpy that way  :)

FABULOUS!!!! I made this with whole wheat challah bread instead of white and used evaporated milk (same amount as recipe calls for). I also added a dash of nutmeg and allspice. I thought it might be over- sweet, but these were so fluffy and moist. We didn't even need any syrup. PERFECT! I definitely recommend trying this with different breads. When using a thicker bread like challah, I found that 2 servings of the batter was needed for each thick slice. I.e. 6 servings made 3 slices.

I used Albertson's French Bread and sliced it thickly.  With all the rave reviews I guess I expected more.  It tastes like most other French Toast recipes so it wasn't anything special to me.  Still looking for that restaurant quality French Toast.

I loveeeeeee this recipe! I tried a different recipe without reading the reviews and it was a total soggy disaster. This recipe however was PERFECT and easy. I tried one bite and I got so distracted with how good it was that I burnt the second toast on the frying pan! I only used egg white since I had some leftover from something else I was baking. I sprinkled cinnamon on the side of the toast I would fry, and sprinkled more on the other side when flipping. That way, the cinnamon taste wouldn't be all soaked up in the first few slices of bread. Will definitely try it again.

I love french toast! I did not expect this recipe to be as amazing as it was. A total surprise. Husband told me it is the best French toast he has ever had. I even made extra and froze them for other breakfasts to come.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I too have struggled with soggy bread that has slimy texture.  This recipe really prevents that from happening.  I added a dash of nutmeg at the end & stirred in between dipping the slices.  This really helps the cinnamon distribute evenly on the bread & prevents the flour from settling at the bottom. Try it you will never go back to the old way!

Tasty, I added more cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla. I am not sure if the flour actually made a difference because I used Arnold's country white bread. The bread it's self is fluffy.

OMG...this recipe is so good!!!  I have never been able to successfully make good french toast.  This recipe was both easy and delicious.  I don't like french toast that is too eggy...This was perfect.  My kids loved it.  They wanted 2nds and 3rds.  I used thick sliced french bread from a local bakery.  I also used more cinnamon on each side of the french toast and it came out perfect.  I also did not cook it in butter or shortening.  I sprayed the pan down with pam each time I turned the toast over and with each new piece...It was still great but with a little less fat.

SOOO GOOOOOD!! I followed the recipe but all all mixture ingredients in the blender to get it mixed up good. Used wheat bread and found that soaking it really good works better in an oiled pan (set between the 4-5 setting on my electric stove...6 was too hot and i burned a batch.) served with sliced bananas, dusted with powdered sugar and drenched in Vermont maple syrup. YUM! I'm saving this one, as I'm not a fan of soggy bread, this came out super fluffy!

I've been looking for a recipe that would make french toast that was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. And THIS was is!... It was sooo good. I added nutmeg and a little bit of almond extract to the recipe. I also used brown sugar instead of white. This is my new French Toast recipe!

My wife is Pregnant and has been craving french toast, I decided to mix things up a little and try an online recipe, aside from my typical throw things ina bowl mentality. She/we absolutely loved this, the toast was perfect. We used regular breat and cooked it on a electirc skillet at 325 for a few minutes a side, it was perfect. This is by far the best french toast we have ever had. Thanks!

French toast came out ok, but I felt I was missing the fluffy part, maybe because I used brown bread instead of white bread.  I wanted to like it but felt it came out dry or too doughy if I soaked the bread in longer.  Will continue to look for a french toast recipe that'll give me that fluffy taste.

I have been using allrecipes.com for quite some time but this is my first review of a recipe.  This is by far the best French Toast recipe I have ever tried.  Finally, flavorful French Toast without being soggy at all.  I even over soaked one, just to see how it would turn out and it turned out perfect!  Thanks

Delicious french toast! Very good flavor, everyone loved it (even the people who had to eat it with gluten free bread). I doubled the cinnamon, added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, used Texas Toast and topped it with sifted powdered sugar. It doesn't make 12 servings, though! :)

These are great!  To lighten them up, I used light wheat bread, wheat flour with nonfat milk, splenda.  We make half the recipe, and I put some deli ham in the pan to sear, then stick in between the bread slices before the syrup.  Family loves it.  I usually bake apples to go with it.  A great family breakfast.

My husband loved this french toast! He said it's the best I've made. The only changes I made were that I used 2 whole eggs plus 2 egg whites instead of 3 whole eggs to cut the cholesterol. I also used light vanilla soy milk rather than cow's milk. No complaints with this one!

I am not a cook and am very intimidated by the kitchen, but this recipe was super easy and the French toast was delicious!  I will definitely make it again!

This is most excellent french toast!  It's identical to my "go to" recipe, except for the flour.  However, I will be using this one in the future!  It turned out fluffy, golden and delicious, and my kids devoured it (even the picky six year old!)  I used a loaf of French bread that was bought a couple of days ago specifically for french toast.  I only got 8 1" thick slices dipped before the batter was used up.  That's the only complaint I can come up with -- there wasn't enough for seconds!

I halved the recipe, but let the bread soak too much I guess, cause I only ended up with 4 slices. Flavor was still the same as my regular, just toss milk and eggs together recipe straight out my head, so can't say I was impressed, I thought actually following a recipe for French toast( as well as adding flour) would make a difference.

I thought this was good, but nothing spectacular.  I used half & half instead of milk.  But I didn't think the flour made it that much better than the French toast that I usually make.

Let's put it this way, when I asked my 15 year old daughter and friend what they would rate this recipe they both said 18!  I did let the milk and eggs come to room temp, like I do when I make pancakes.  Thanks for sharing the recipe

I soaked each bread slice before frying and it does take a longer time to cook all the way through but they puff up well. I also served with blueberry compote and whipped cream. Delicious!

Quite delicious! There were only two of us so I resized the proportions to make 4 slices, but then had to double the egg mixture to have enough moisture for all of the bread.  We also subbed rice milk for the normal milk and doubled the cinnamon and vanilla. I spread a bit of raspberry-blueberry jam on and it was lovely. My tip: use a large non-stick frying pan to avoid mushy slices.

Delicious recipe! I also sprinkle the cinnamon directly onto the pieces of bread- not mixed into the batter. Cook over medium/low heat to make sure inside is cooked and not soggy while outside doesn't burn.

I know that today of all days I shouldn't have been cooking but you know a mothers job is never done. I am not one to make french toast, couldn't even tell you when I have. I used the Texas toast and sprinkled the finished product with cinnamon and confectioners sugar...we loved it.  My husband was excited (he loved french toast) the kids as well, they didn't even use syrup. Thanks...Jennifer

Great recipe and easy to make! I made some substitutions: pancake mix for flour since we had run out, brown sugar instead of the white sugar and it still came out great! I intend to use regular flour next time but for now it was great.

A winner! My stepson ate it all up and declared they were as good as my pancakes (which he asks for EVERY weekend). I think I'll make some more of this french toast today! So good, syrup isn't even necessary.

I gave this recipe 4 stars only because I have not tried any other french toast recipes to compare to.  It is very good, very easy, very fast, and very filling!  I add a couple tablespoons of caramal/vanilla coffee creamer which adds lots of flavor (and you can choose from many other creamer flavors at the store)

Yummy! I made with Texas Toast. I didn't have any milk, so I just used 1/2 and 1/2. You should note that with Texas Toast I only got 8 slices cooked with the batter.

I didn't notice a difference in taste using the flour. This was pretty bland for us and didn't get the nice crispness on the edges that I usually get with my old standard french toast recipe.  I'll just stick with it in the future.

This was awesome french toast.  I followed the recipe exactly, but used 1/2 and 1/2 because we had some and used texas toast for the bread...it was perfect.  For me there is nothing worse than soggy french toast, and this had a nice crunch to the outside and great flavor.  Also, if you're like me and try mixing french toast batter with a fork...its worth the extra effort to get out the beaters for this so you don't end up with eggy spots.  I actually used an immersion blender and it worked great.

I was very skeptical about using flour to make french toast, but it's amazing!  I did add a little more cinnamon just cause I love it.  My daughter absolutely loved it and didn't even ask for syrup with it.  It wasn't soggy but it wasn't too dry either.

I have never EVER liked french toast. You couldn't get me to eat it if I was starving on a deserted island. Soggy Bread? Who would want to eat that??  But one day, my son woke up asking for French Toast, and I thought, "eh, why not. I don't have to eat it" and I found this recipe.  It had me at hello. Seriously, this recipe has made me sing the praises of French Toast to anyone who will listen and has become a weekend staple. French Toast Saturday!!!  Shh...the secret is in the flour.

Very good- you can really taste the vanilla!  The middle was a bit soggy. Very filling.

This recipe turned out GREAT! I made it today (valentine's day)for my husband and he and I loved it!!! I used Challah bread and PAM butter flavor instead of the oil. I got 6 pieces instead of 12. Maybe because the challah bread is bigger than regular sandwich bread. I will be making this recipe again and again!!! Thanks for posting it :o)

Pretty good. I followed it exactly, but next time I'll use bread that's a little stale. That's a great tip I saw just now from another reviewer.

I used leftover challah bread, and it was perfect.  If you don't like french toast that tastes "eggy", this is the recipe for you.  However, we had the same problem other reviewers did: we only got four thick pieces of toast out of this recipe.  Which was fine since there were just two of us, but larger families might want to double the recipe.

Didn't feel the flour added anything except for difficulty in getting the lumps out.  A decent french toast recipe, but there are better ones on the site.

Hubby rated a 4.5.  I let him rate it since he's the one who asked for french toast.  I cooked the first 5 on my griddle at 350' using nonstick spray, but they weren't as crispy as he would like, So on the the next 5 pieces, I used butter instead of spray, stayed at 350' on the griddle, then I put them in the toaster, and he said that made them a 5 star for him.  I had plenty of batter for them; I did not let them soak.  We will freeze the leftovers and throw them in the toaster when we have a hunger for them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Adding the flour to the custard makes it more "batter-like".  You may need to whisk up the custard a few times as you work through the batch -- I found the flour tried to settle a bit.  These were a big hit and kept well to eat the next day.

We really liked this recipe and didn't change a thing.  We are used to adding syrup on ourselves that way we control how sweet it is.  Will make again.

My little ladies liked this recipe a lot, though I say the best way is not to saturate the bread but qui8ckly dip, flip, and fry.

This was pretty good tasting. I didn't have vanilla extract which I didn't realize until I got to that step. I liked the way the outsides browned and seemed to be a little crisper, the flour added a nice touch. As far as fluffy, it wasn't any different than any other I've had, but I used regular sandwich sliced bread, not texas toast. My family didn't seem to notice this was different than my usual recipe. We enjoyed this, thanks for posting the recipe.

Served this to my 4 grandkids on Saturday, all of them picky eaters. Sunday morning they requested it again. Had a few pieces left over the first day, left them on a plate. Hubby gobbled them up cold several hours later.
Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing

These were perfect even with sandwich bread! I made these yesterday with the Creamy Hot Cocoa recipe from this site and my kids were in heaven! I always ask them to rate the recipe and my youngest daughter who is VERY picky said FANTASTIC! I'm sure these would be even better with the bread called for in the recipe, but I couldn't wait to make these. Thank you SO much for a great french toast recipe!

I have made this twice now.  LOVE IT.  I add 1 vanilla bean to the batter and i also add 1/4 cup half&half OR 1/4 cup heavy whip to 3/4 cup 2% milk - just a personal preference.  Perfect as is!  My husband, and two (picky) sons loved it.  thanks!

The flavor was great. First time making french toast; I didn't know how hot or how long to cook them, so they will probably turn out better next time. Also didn't know how much oil to put in pan until half way through cooking them. Husband ate five pieces and was looking at the stove for more.

I have several favourite French Toast recipes, and this one will now join the ranks. I halved the recipe to make it for three people, and used sliced 'Bread Machine Challah I' (from this site) which has an awesome texture, instead of white bread. After reading some of the reviews, I made some adjustments (based on another recipe I have) - I substituted dark brown sugar for the white, freshly grated nutmeg for the cinnamon and almond extract for the vanilla. I served the French Toast with a raspberry sauce, left over from the 'Brie Pecan Rollups with Raspberry Sauce' (again from this site) that I made for dinner last night. It was a real hit!

I measured out the dry ingredients so I could fix it while camping.  I like the addition of flour, and everyone else seemed to, too. It seems like it fluffs it up a bit more and lends itself more to crisping on the outside.  We used the thick bread specifically made for French Toast so I didn't get quite 24 pieces after doubling, but no one went hungry.  I will definitely hold onto this recipe!

This recipe was ok - my 3 girls loved it! I used 1 day old thick pieces of Challah. The French Toast did not fall apart at all. I added cinnamon to the batter, but next time i will sprinkle it on at the end. I like to see a lighter finished product and then sprinkle it with cinnamon and sugar or dip it into maple syrup. Update: - I made this recipe again and I used frozen pieces of bread and dipped that into the egg mixture and then fried it with a little bit of oil. That really helped to keep the bread from getting soggy and staying in one piece!

Really good...  all the kids loved it.

I used thick slices of sourdough and some raisin bread that I had.  Worked great!

I'm giving it four stars for now. Until
I can try it again, and fry it in oil/Crisco instead of butter.

This was just okay. I liked that the 
flour thickened up the egg mixture and
made the toast crispy. It just wasn't
crisp enough for me, like I thought
it would be. 

I added a tablespoon of undiluted orange
juice concentrate and a tsp. of pumpkin
pie spice. Great taste. I like the idea,
I just need to try it again to give me
the results I'd expected.

YUMMY!!!
Although this recipe is very close to the one I always use, this was better!!! I made “breakfast for dinner” last night and this recipe was a HIT!!! I think it was the vanilla extract and the flour. I added a dash of nutmeg along with more cinnamon than called for, (as other reviewers have done) and it was perfect. I scaled down the recipe to 6 servings (but it got all funny and called for 1 ½ eggs… how do you measure 1 ½ eggs) So this is what I did, I used only 2 tablespoons of flour, ½ cup of half & half, 1 pinch of salt, 2 eggs, ½ teaspoon of cinnamon and ¼ teaspoon nutmeg, ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract and 2 teaspoons of brown sugar. I then whisked it all together, but it was really really thick, so I added about 3 tablespoons of milk or so and continued to whisk it all together until it was thinner. I dipped the bread slices into the mixture and placed on a butter greased electric griddle. I cooked all 6 slices at the same time; they were crispy and golden brown when done. I had a little extra batter so I let a heel of the bread soak it all up and then cooked that up… It was so good. This is my new French Toast Recipe!!! ! Thank you Bonnie!!!!

Really really good and easy french toast.  The only down side for me was that I half-ed the recipe thinking that would give me 6 pieces, but my bread was very absorpant and it got all sucked up in 4 pieces of bread.....next time I won't half all the wet ingrediants, just the bread.  Also, sprikling the cinnimon on after the bread soaked instead of adding it to the ingrediants is much easier and the best way to have equal cinnimon on each piece.

I've never liked french toast but I make it once in awhile for my fiance. I tried this recipe and it was great! I actually at all mine and loved it. I didn't have special bread so I just used regular white so I didn't have the problem with sogginess others mentioned, it was perfect!

pretty good! the flour definately made a difference with the texture of the french toast. like a previous reviewer suggested, mix between dipping each piece so you get cinnamon on every slice.

This was great, the addition of the flour makes a great difference, the tasty mixture coats the bread perfectly and doesn't drip every where.  I thought the measurements were perfect, wouldn't change a thing.  Served with homemade syrup.  My kids were in awe, thank you..

The best french toast I have EVER eaten anywhere!  The only tip that I would share is to stir/whisk the egg&milk mixture prior to add each piece of bread because the cinnamon stays at the bottom.  Paired with real maple syrup and it doesn't get any better.  My husband eats 6 slices every time I make it.

It was good, I didnt use a thick type of bread so the first few were falling apart in the mix.  Overall It could have been better if I used the right kind of bread, will try again.

The flour does make all the difference...this recipe was quick and easy too.  I made mine with a loaf of uncut bread from the local bakery.  It was nice to be able to cut them to whatever size we preferred.  I think this recipe would also be good with some bananas and caramel sauce...

This will be replacing my regular French Toast recipe. I wouldn't say fluffy either, but it does have the perfect texture, just like a restaurants, wouldn't change a thing.  Definitely whisk batter between dipping bread slices, like the other reviewers recommend.  Thanks for the recipe!  Update:  Here's a tip:  add the cinnamon in with the flour in the first step rather than adding later...I did this and the cinammon mixed WAY better into the liquid mixture.

Simple and easy to make with only a few ingredients.  It did not taste powdery or dough-y like I imagined it could be like from the flour.  Will make again on a nice sunny weekend and add strawberries or some fruit.

Good recipe. Only problem was the fact that I bought a Belgian Loaf that may not have been very good for soaking up the batter. On top of that, I made the mistake of not letting the thick slices sit long enough to do any real soaking. As a result, the batter was really only on the surface of the slices. It may be noted that had I done it right, there wouldn't have been enough batter for all of the slices. Suggest doubling the batter for this recipe.

Great french toast recipe!  I've always wondered how restaurants get their french toast so perfect - and flour must be the key!  I doubled the recipe and it turned out great.  Thank you for finally giving us the secret!

I've made this twice now - I wouldn't call it "fluffy" but besides that, the texture is fantastic and it has wonderful flavor.  Great recipe!

This is the first time I made French Toast for the family, they are not big fans as they usually don't have much flavor, or are too heavy. I thought I would give these a try, they LOVED them, I couldn't make them fast enough for my oldest son (14 year old), and my 12 year old son who barely eats anything, had 2. I was very impressed. I didn't change a thing, but one recommendation would be to keep the whisk nearby, as between bread soaks, you will want to whist the mixture again, just becasue the cinnamin seams to rise to the top. This is definately a keeper!

Absolutely the best French Toast recipe you could ask for. Too often French Toast is soggy, thick, and mushy. Not this one! I served it with the sauteed apples found here on allrecipes, and it was the hit of the brunch!

Not a lot of work... but yeilds fantastic results!  I too sprinkled with Cinnamon after dipping, and I a touch of nutmeg in the mixture.  I also bought a nice loaf of french bread from the grocery store so that I could control the thickness of the slices.  GREAT RECIPE!

Great.  Delicious.  The best ever.  I used this recipe for a french toast fanatic (my husband) and received  very nice compliments from him.  Thanks to you.  The only thing I changed was the bread.  I used Portuguese sweet bread instead.

Great recipe! I used cinnamon swirl bread and there was no need for the cinnamon!  Best french toast I ever made!  Add almond extract when you need a change of flavor.

i thought i'll be able to replace my french toast recipe with this one, but without syrup this french toast is nada.  by the way, the only "fluffy" french toast i made from this recipe were the last two breads (because the flour sank down even though i continuously whisk the mix).

I cut the milk back to 2/3 cup and increased sugar to 1/3 cup, plus added 2 tablespoons of honey and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg...PERFECT!  Even my picky 4 year old asked for more. We used nice thick slices of Texas Toast.  I will definitely make this again.

Just gone done making this for my husband who requested french toast for breakfest.  I thought it turned out pretty good, to be honest, I dont have french toast that often enough to know what 'normal' french toast would taste like.  I added a bit more white sugar and some nutmeg instead of cinnamon and almond extract instead of vanilla.  Flavor wise, I thought it was terrific.  Reminded me of holiday time, definetly a different flavor than the traditional cinnamon/vanilla, which I tend to use a lot in everyday baking.  The texture, meanwhile, was spongy.  Not in a bad way.  I used some fresh wheat bread for him, and some day-old slices of french bread for me, which I thought worked better since it sopped up more of the bread.  Not bad at all.  THanks.

Best french toast ever. Although it makes a ton for my family. I made it for myself and my 4 year old... so there was alot of leftover. I saved it in the fridge, and it was as good the next day! Thanks

I found this recipe two years ago and now I make it for my husband's birthday every year. It's easy to make and tastes delicious! I use egg challah for the bread and it tastes even better than regular bread.

Excellent flavor.  I put the egg mixture into the food processor first, just a few pulses.
I didn't get fluffy though.  I tried the oiled pan as per directions, the first few pieces weren't brown like I like, so I used butter after that.  Definitely not low fat, but delicious.

Not soggy at all.  Good consistency - good idea with the flour.  I agree with other reviews that it's not very sweet at all.  Even after I added more sugar.  So next time, I will double the vanilla and white sugar, triple the cinnamon, and add 1 tbsp. of brown sugar.  Also, only had enough liquid for 8 pieces of Texas Toast (soaked 20 sec. each side).  Will definitely try this again.

This recipe is the best french toast recipe ever! It is not coated in eggs like other recipes I've tried.  It makes the bread fluffy.  Just a few things: I use frozen bread to avoid soaking in the liquid too much, that way it is not soggy. I also use more cinammon (about 1.5 tsp).  Make sure you use good thick bread, D'Italiano bread is really good.  Also you can substitute the milk for some eggnog for some Christmas French Toast or use thick raisin bread for a twist.  Overall this is an incredible recipe - better than restaurants.

I'm sorry to say this was a waste of time. Adding flour didn't make this recipe any better than regular old French toast. It wasn't fluffy at all.

The first time I made this I thought it was very good, but I like more cinnamon and sugar, so I used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 2 teaspoons of vanilla, and 2 tablespoons of sugar.  I have always made French toast very similar to this without the addition of the flour.  I LOVE the addition of the flour because it keeps most all of the cinnamon from floating to the top causing you to have to stir again and again before each 'dipping'.  Be sure to whisk the flour with some milk before adding all together. Thanks Bonnie, ya did good lady!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! Another winner/keeper!!! The flour has always been the missing ingredient to the perfect French Toast Ty Ty!!! I scaled recipe down to "8" & used reg sandwich bread and it just did 6 pieces not 8, but I used half and half w/ a lil water(no milk in) & a lil less than recipe called for cause I like an eggier coating. I also went heavy on Cinnamon and added a lil Nutmeg to taste.  Fabulous! I really must insist you try!!

Wow. This tasted great. I like the idea of adding flour to the eggs and milk and making a batter. I added less milk and a bit of flavored coffee creamer,and it was so good and rich it really didn't need syrup. I may not follow this recipe exact, but I will always add flour to my french toast from now on.

this recipe was really good, i didn't find it all that fluffy though.  But it did have a different taste which was good.  I also used the caramel sauce from the recipe carmelized french toast( also from this web site) turned out good.  The only thing was that i found that it didn't make enough egg mixture, i don't know if i just soaked the bread too much or what so i needed another egg and such.  Would definitely make this again but i will try adding some baking soda like some others have said.

This is the best french toast I've ever eaten!  I made it exactly as written, and had outstanding results.  I think the word "fluffy" may be misleading in this recipe.  I couldn't see any extra fluffiness, but the texture was thicker, making it "fluffy" i guess.  The flour really did help in this, and I didn't add baking powder.  I will be making all my french toast with flour from now on!!!  I've always just made basic french toast, but after trying this, it's just too well....basic!!!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe Bonnie!!!!

This is a very good french toast recipe although I didn't really notice what the flour did for it.  I like to cut out the middle of the bread with a round cookie cutter or a small cup and drop an egg in the middle.  This is how I've eaten french toast ever since I was little.

I wish I knew what bread the submitter is referring to that will make this recipe unique and more "fluffY" than your normal french toast. I couldn't tell the difference but this is still a good recipe...even though I've made it this way since I was 12 (w/out the flour). Served this with "Mouth Watering Medley" (also from this site) and sliced fresh fruit and my out-of-town guests just raved about breakfast throughout the remaining portion of their stay!!

I made this for a brunch with friends & family and everyone raved about it!  My husband isn't a french toast fan and he loved it.  He wants me to make it more often.  We added a bit more cinnamon to give it a bit more flavor.

This is an excellent French Toast recipe.  My kids even loved it!  I would recommend to double it though.  I used sliced French Bread and it made about 7 pieces without doubling.

Smells and tastes great.  It is better to coat the bread slices quickly.  I let a few soak and they were very soggy.

Just ok, definetly not fluffy -  cook a lot longer than regular French toast or it will be really soggy.  Not worth the extra calories the flour and sugar add.

This had really great flavor, but beware! You must stir the mixture after dipping every couple slices as the cinnamon etc. tends to settle at the bottom of the bowl.

I was so happy to find this.  When I was little, my grandmother use to make French Toast like this, but it was always a "little of this and a little of that", so my recipe was never consistent.  Thanks!

This recipe was very good, but not all that much better than others.  I think what may make a big difference is what type of bread you use and how it is cooked (i.e. veggie oil vs. butter).  Also, I would strain the batter so you don't get all the egg 'goop' that doesn't mix well with the rest of the batter ingredients.  
Thanks for the recipe - I'll continue to use it!

Loved this, but I had problems with the cinnamon all sticking to the first piece of bread, don't put the cinnamon shaker away.  Best french toast I ever eaten, and oh so easy!

Very tasty french toast. The flour helps to keep the bread from getting too soggy. We made it with texas toast and it turned out very good.

After reading the other reviews, I thought this french toast was going to knock my socks off.  My family did like it better than my normal recipe and I will make it again, but it was a little bit of a let down.

Easy, Tasty and Delicious!  I add nutmeg and ground cloves (just a hint) to mine, seems to add a little more zing!  If that's what you like.

Reducing the recipe to 4 servings made it taste less exciting, because the spices and vanilla was too insignificant.

Absolutely amazing and delicious!! 
I used regular sliced wheat bread. I've made this twice. Best french toast recipe I've ever had or made. I have adjusted the serving amounts to 8 the first time and 20 today. The first time I got four slices, and today, I got 11. Now, I'll just double the servings I actually need to get the need servings.

instead of vanilla extract I used Port wine and brought out more of the cinnamon flavour.

This recipe is a winner! The French toast had crispy edges and it’s probably because of the addition of flour. This is now my “go-to” recipe, so delicious.

Delicious!!! I substituted the Vanilla extract with Maple syrup and added a little extra syrup and cinnamon. I omitted the sugar because of the sweetness already in the syrup. I needed to make two batches of this recipe in order to cover both sides of the 12 slices of thinner sandwich bread (its what I had at home) and it was enough for it to soak up all the mixture. Next time I will be trying it with Texas toast for it to really soak up nicely.

I added 1/2 tsp apple pie spice along with 1 tsp of cinnamon. I think I will try adding some brown sugar next time and might try self rising flour. I will definitely make this again. This makes the Best French Toast!!

I ensured to whisk the mixture before coating the bread each time, otherwise portions of the mixture settles to the bottom. Which is still fine and tastes great, but I like the even batch. Not thick and thin portions.

Best french toast I've ever made, I think.  I played and added 1/4 cup eggnog to the milk.  I put sliced bananas and blueberries on top and used real maple syrup.  Came out great.  Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper!

Really enjoyed this! We had a loaf of Texas Toast bread (which we don’t usually have). I let the slices sit out all day to get stale (they soak up more egg this way). I did double the cinnamon and stirred several times. It was fluffy and very yummy! 
I recently made a second batch and froze 1/2 of it so we can reheat and serve during the week.

My family liked this recipe a lot. I used pumpkin spice bread and chocolate chip brioche bread (both bought at Aldi) and it was very tasty! It did have less of an egg taste than my normal recipe, which is good sometimes, especially when using bread like pumpkin or chocolate chip...

Followed the recipe exactly! I love the fluffiness! It's perfect and it's similar to the ones I've had at hotels and fancy restaurants. It tastes perfect with fruits, jam, or other toppings. But if you'd like to eat it by yourself, it's going to need a little more flavor. Next time I make it, I'm going to put more of the cinnamon and vanilla.

I used pure vanilla extract that was a mistake I will do this again, it was so rich and creamy feeling.

I made the French toast with a little change; I used one extra tablespoon of sugar.  Otherwise, this is my favorite French Toast recipe.

Up until I found this recipe my french toast was always decent, but it always felt like there was something wrong with it. This recipe was a lifesaver - my french toast now tastes delicious! Never making french toast how I used to make it again.

I only had brown sugar so I used that rather than the white sugar in the recipe, that was the only change I made. Everyone loved it, my 2 grandsons, and my son who had already eaten dinner with a friend had some too! It’s just delicious!,,

Child, LOVES this recipe. Along with everyone else. I don’t measure the vanilla or cinnamon I just pour until I think it’s enough, but I know it more than the recipe calls for. Like other reviewers I also whisk after each dip. I doubled the recipe with homemade brioche bread. I save extras in the freezer and reheat in the toaster and they are still just as delicious!

**"Teenage stamp of approval!"**  Great recipe!  I have made it twice! My picky teen LOVED it!  There's not too much or too little of anything in it.  Because it's a basic recipe , it's easy to dress up or down. I will definitely make this again.

The kids and I all loved this recipe! Simple, on hand ingredients. I don’t like when the egg separates and is along the edge of the French toast. I feel like the flour in this recipe kept it really well mixed. No egg flavor on the crust!! Definitely my new go to French toast recipe. We topped them with strawberries, syrup and whip cream. 5 stars

This was amazing french toast.  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand.  Used half and half instead of milk and added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  My family loved it so much I had to make it again.

This was a great French toast recipe. Used Texas toast bread, followed directions exactly except doubled the cinnamon and vanilla which helped. A double recipe made  one loaf of bread, with a bit of sauce leftover. lovely crust, easy to make, a keeper.

This is a fabulous recipe! It serves 12 and I only needed to serve 5 so I did cut it down but it still came out wonderful! The only thing I did different is used Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon swirl bread. This a tougher, heartier bread. It came out fantastic!! Will be doing this again!

Delicious! Used brioche bread which made it extra yummy. Followed others recommendations and doubled cinnamon, vanilla and added a tablespoon of brown sugar too.  Was barely enough for 8 small slices of bread, not 12.

I made it with white and whole wheat bread. The white bread did not end up fluffy. The wheat bread was much better but I think the Texas Toast may be the secret to success which I did not have on hand to try. I loved the flavor. It just wasn't fluffy and I wasn't sure about the cooking timeline. Do you let the egg mixture soak through the bread for a minute? I did... again, good flavor not great directions and the whole wheat bread is much better than white. I will try again with Texas Toast.

16 yo son made it for Sunday brunch. Was a hit although he said it didn’t have enough cinnamon, sugar and he soaked the bread to long. We all disagreed it was perfect, nothing was to overpowering, good balance. He used leftover French bread sliced thick and thick sandwich bread. I would suggest using your day old bread (like my son did) so that it won’t get to soggy and fall apart when you try to transfer it to the griddle. There were no leftovers, recipe is a keeper.

I made this but instead of using a pan to make each slice I put it in a baking dish with non-stick foil and baked iit turned out delicious and will definitely make this again.  Doing it this way allows for easy freezing of leftovers.

This was the best french toast ever.  The only thing I did was to bake them at 400F for about 15 minutes on uncreased cookie sheet.  Let stand on sheet about 1 minute before removing.  This was from the end of Chef John's french toast.  Froze any leftovers with wax paper in between and popped them into the toaster another day.

This is the best French toast I've ever had! I use spelt flour, extra cinnamon, Truvia, and cinnamon chip bread. I make a blueberry compote or syrup that pairs very nicely and of course there's always real maple syrup too. Delicious!

We think this recipe is awesome!  I doubled the entire recipe and it just was enough to use with an entire loaf of Texas toast.  I do add an extra 2 T of brown sugar (when doubling the recipe) and increase the cinnamon to 2 tsp (because we like the cinnamon taste), mix all the dry ingredients together first, then whisk in the milk, vanilla and eggs in slowly -  for me, it keeps the flour from settling at the bottom of the bowl as much after mixed.   I make with an entire loaf of Texas toast so we can have leftovers & freeze them - makes a perfect quick breakfast for the kid during the school week!  Thank you for the recipe - it's great!!

Wasn’t bad. Did like the little extra fluff and looked more like the ones at the restaurant. I would sweeten it. But that’s me. To each their own. But wasn’t bad. Also used wheat bread. So is different.

I put in brown sugar instead of white sugar and that turned out pretty good. I also used some leftover batter to make pancakes which wasn't a bad idea either.

I made this recipe this morning I doubled the cinnamon & vanilla used the other ingredients as directed also use Sara Lee Artesano bread. I thought it was JUST OK! It lacked a lot of flavor, the middle was still a little moist, I did let the bread soak some flipping it in the batter twice. Cooked on medium heat w/ light butter in the pan. I will try making it again with cinnamon bread (my daughters suggestion) to see how it turns out. I will make an addendum to this review since it's worth a second shot.

Such an easy recipe and so delicious!  I was thinking it would be a little too sweet, but it was perfect.  I made this exactly as the recipe is written and it came out perfect.  The reviews from my family were all highly positive - they want me to make it again tomorrow.

This is a great French toast recipe!  My son who is a picky eater loves it!  Def make sure you wisk between batches as yes the cinnamon does float to the top.

I made this for my family for a Christmas brunch we had,and they loved it. My 12 year nephew told his mom it was the best French toast he ever had. Went pretty much bythe recipe but doubled it  for a crowd and I always use pure vanilla not the extract and I’m always a little heavy on the vanilla, added a little brown sugar also. Perfect recipe

This recipe has been our favorite for years now!!  This morning my husband and son used powdered sugar instead of the flour!  ;)  They added the flour last after they realized.  Honestly, it was the best french toast we'd ever had!!  :)

Yes, it's great. I added a T of brown sugar as another reviewer suggested. Worked well for us, as my hubby likes sweet and caramel flavor. I would probably like it either way. Sprinkling cinnamon on after dipping was another good suggestion.

my family loved this recipe.  I took the advice of some reviews and doubled the cinnamon and vanilla.  my husband said the vanilla was too strong, so next time I wont double it.  also, I used 1 tbsp of brown sugar and 1 tbsp of white sugar as suggested by a reviewer, which I would do again.  i suggest mixing all dry ingredients in a separate bowl and mixing, then sift into the wet ingredients, whisking each time before you sludge toast in the mixture.  I made the mixture first without sifting the dry ingredients and it was clumpy and wouldnt whisk together.  using white texas toast is a must!  this will be my go to recipe for French toast.

Good base. I tweaked just a bit. Doubled the recipe, b/c base was insufficient to coat 10 thick slices of bread. I did equal parts vanilla, sugar and cinnamon (used teaspoon). I melted butter on a cookie sheet and baked toast  in the oven on 375 for 17 - 20 mins, flipping the last 5 mins. The toast was golden brown, nice crunchy coating on the outside, soft and buttery on the inside. Yummmmmmmm.

My grandfather said that out of the 93 years that he has lived he has never enjoyed eating French toast until this batch. “polý kalá (he said “very good” in Greek). I made my French toast with Dave’s Killer bread and it made this dense bread into a beautiful, fluffy piece of French toast.

I love this recipe!  I doubled the cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg just because I like the taste. I’m absolutely sure it would be fine without the addition. Next time I won’t soak the bread as much as mine came out very dense.  Delicious but heavy. It will be my French toast recipe from now on.

The best French toast hands down! Normal french toast is way too eggy for my liking. This does not come out eggy. I've made it with French brioche bread, and just tried it with cheap country potato bread and both types were good!

This recipe holds up in a warming pan on a buffet line better than any other that I have tried.

Tastes great!  Only problem is it wasn't enough for 12 toasts.  It made 5 because it the buttermilk sliced bread soaked up the batter very easily.  I may need to use a different type of sliced bread but it came out delicious!

This was very good. All I had was regular white sandwich bread and this still turned out good. Will definitely make again using Texas toast or some thick sliced French bread. Great flavor.

Not everyone in my house appreciates the "eggy-ness" of french toast. I, however, love a good french toast when cooked all the way through. It requires good bread and a light hand when soaking. This recipe is perfect! French toast is always better with thicker bread, but even if you have a hard time with timing the soaking, your french toast will come out great!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  My usual recipe is the same except the flour but it made a difference as it cuts down on the fried eggy exterior when it cooks.

Made as directed except skipped the cinnamon. Grandkids don’t like it and even without that it was a really good recipe. Will make this again.

The batrer was awesome, had to change up some of the proportions of course because I only needed a few slices for myself. The outcome unfortunately (and this was my own mistake) left me wanting. Ligthly oiled for me didn't work and I burned the first two slices. So I went for plenty oil to fry with, and this time it came out pretty good. Less the soggy way you think of french toast bread and more the crispy way you think of french toast sticks though. Taste was great overall though

This was a great recipe! My whole family really enjoyed it. I did make  a few changes to the original recipe: added one tablespoon of brown sugar, doubled the vanilla, doubled the cinnamon. I then doubled the entire recipe to serve 6. It made one full loaf of regular white, day old bread. It was flavourful but not overly powerful. All the flavours blended well and I topped with a bit of butter, syrup and powdered sugar and ate it with bacon. Soooo good!

This was a huge hit.  I made too much, and froze the rest, and it can go straight into the toaster.  So delicious.  Don't forget the good maple syrup!

This is delicious.  I did double the vanilla as suggested, and I used brown sugar instead of granulated.  I had frozen some overripe fruit a couple weeks ago - peaches, plums and nectarines - which I thawed and made a warm fruit sauce.  I poured that over the French toast.  What a wonderful late breakfast.

I'm usually in charge of French toast in my household but, my daughter (16) wanted to try this recipe for Father's Day...added fresh peaches and strawberries to top it off.... it was fantastic!!  We used a rustic store brand white bread and the texture was great! 
Thanks! I've printed this one to replace my old flourless recipe for future special occasions!

That was really good!  Was what my husband said and I usually don't get any positive feedback on my cooking, only negative.  So this must be really good!  The batter is a perfect consistency so the flour must be the trick.  I put the bread on a sheet pan and poured the batter on top to let them soak in for a few minutes.  I cooked in two pans on the stove top and no pieces were too soggy.  Looking forward to see if I can repeat this wonderful recipe.

I doubled the cinnamon (1 tsp) and used brown sugar instead of white sugar - Really like this recipe, I've made it a few times now and it's a real hit! I used Natures Own thick-sliced bread, that seems to work best for French Toast.

This is a good, basic French toast recipe.  I usually find that a scale using 1 egg is enough for 3 slices of bread, not 4.  Sometimes I cut the bread into 3 strips each to make French toast sticks.  In that case, it's more like 2.5 slices of bread per egg.

Delicious. I added the brown (and white) sugar suggested by others, and doubled the vanilla and cinnamon. I think that it tasted very vanilla and would benefit from the suggestion which adds banana puree. 
P.S.- I also substituted milk for unsweetened vanilla almond milk so the recipe is dairy-free. 
 Overall a great recipe. Thanks for sharing.  :)

I have tried so many French toast recipes and this is by far the best! I  will never use another recipe again. Flour is the key ingredient & it makes a huge difference! I usually use a little more cinnamon but of course that's just my personal preference.  Love Love Love this recipe!

The quality is similar to what I would expect at a local restaurant. This recipe is complemented immensely with thick bread slices.  Batter is very nice consistency and applies well.

I’ve always struggled with the proportions of ingredients. This turned out perfect - light, fluffy, not runny in the center at all. I use English muffin bread which absorbs the batter without getting doughy. Thank you!

I followed the recipe except for using wheat bread I had on hand.  The flavor was devine and next time I'll use a sturdier bread as the recipe author suggested (probably sour dough).

So I tried this recipe for my family today and I thought I’d share our opinion since so many others are providing such negative reviews.
So, we made the recipe exactly as it is written, and, therefore, I can honestly offer an opinion.
First, I sent the older girls out to milk our Tibetan yak, Tianxia.  We’ve had her several years, and we get all of our dairy from her.  She is totally free-range and her diet consists of what she can forage from around our 1600-acre farm in northern North Dakota.  It gives her milk a nutty, earthy flavor.  If there is anything we desire, it’s nutty AND earthy.
After the milking was done, and while we waited for the milk to settle and the cream to rise, the rest of us went to gather eggs from our flock of Arancana hens. The Arancana originates from Chile and lays beautiful blue eggs that have a dainty flavor that blends well with most foods.  They’re a bit small, so it usually takes two to equal one typical, inferior, supermarket egg, so we had to double up on that part of the ingredient list.  Just like Tianxia, our little flock is also free-range which enhances their flavor with a certain terroir that can only be described to those of this place.
As a hobby, I have a small mail-order business that s

These were okay and not so much better than how I normally make French toast to justify the extra added ingredient (flour) and the additional time of getting it out, measiuring it and whisking it.  I believe I’ll stick to my usual.

Delicious recipe.  I have an electric stove/ cooktop, and a heat setting of 4 once the non-stick pan heated up seemed to work well.  I added a little more cinnamon than the recipe required  because I wanted the more pronounced flavor.  I added powdered sugar to finish.  I used Publix’s chicago bread instead of sourdough.  It soaked up the mixture & was delicious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was a great recipe to try. Only I didn’t mix it all in between slices so most of the flavor sat on the bottom of the dish till the last few slices. Which were great even without syrup there was a lot of flavor.

AWESOME FRENCH TOAST!!!!!
So a trick my family has always used was to set the bread you’re going to use out the night before so it gets nice and stale.  I used that new Artesano bread they sell now and whoa!  We are French Toast lovers, but have to say - this was the best french toast we’ve ever had!

It made it so fluffy adding the flour was a great idea and  I tweaked the recipe a little by sprinkling the cinnamon on each side after dipping it and adding a touch more vanilla  also made my own whip cream ! To die for !!

This French toast was perfect! I substituted half of the milk for half yogurt and it came out amazing! I'm terrible at making French Toast so this is great for beginners too. :) just before the second side was done I sprinkled sugar on top and flipped it and did the same to the other side, it caramelized beautifully.

Right up there with the best French toast we ever had!  I poured the liquid mixture into a 9x13 inch cake pan, laid  4 thick slices of Italian bread in the pan, turned them over a couple of times, then let them soak overnight. The 4 slices  absorbed all of the liquid but there was some gooey flour left behind in the pan. There was no problem with even distribution of the cinnamon when doing it this way.

Made it as is for the first half and then added 1/4 cup ricotta and 1 tablespoon orange juice to give it a savory twang.

This lives up to the hype. We made this recipe with day old sourdough (it's what I had on hand), and it was delicious topped with some homemade fruit compote. I followed the advice of many of the other commenters, doubling the cinnamon and vanilla. I also did 50/50 sugar and brown sugar. Will make again!! This is a keeper!

I was a bit skeptical at first , the only difference I see is the flour, and I was thinking what difference can that make? It does make it fluffier and more like restaurant quality !

Yum, this is a keeper.

The wife had to go to work and the kids wanted french toast.  This was my first time and the kids loved it.  Was pretty easy to make and my boy says it tasted better without the syrup!  Will make it again.

This was crazy good! It does taste like something from a high-end restaurant. I grew up just dunking bread in eggs and calling it french toast, but never again! This is my only French toast from now on. It also freezes well as I froze my leftovers and they were delicious.

Simply awesome French Toast.  Of course, using the right bread is essential.  I’d recommend stopping at a local bakery and using their recommendation.

FINE. This was good, nothing wrong with it. French Toast is a treat no matter what. I felt though that the flour mixture makes it a more solid cakky feel and I think I like  the eggier feel better.

This French toast is delicious. 
After dipping each bread slice in the egg mixture, I then dip it in crushed corn flakes. 
Super crispy and delicious!!
I always get positive feedback from my breakfast guests.

I was a bit leary of this with it having flour in the recipe. I tried it anyway. I used my homemade sourdough bread for this and and grated a little fresh nutmeg in the batter. With warm real Maple syrup, It was probably the best French toast I have ever made. Very easy and oh so good. A real keeper!

I was in charge of feeding a crowd of almost 200 people for breakfast, and the main course was French Toast.  Well most of us have the basic recipe we have learned from our folks; eggs, milk, cinnamon and vanilla.  I wanted something better that would really jazz up the meal, so I picked this one.  Very glad I did; it was a major hit!  I did follow the advice of a few readers and doubled the cinnamon and vanilla.  Was worried it would be too sweet but nope, came out just fine.   By doubling the recipe I was able to handle about 3 loaves of Texas bread per batch.  I agree with most... you have to wisk the batter each time you pick it up to add more bread to the mix.  And a medium heat is mandatory.. 300' tops.  It will help you cook the bread evenly and not soggy.  Thanks for the recipe, a keeper for sure!

The only change I made was that I added nutmeg and I mixed all the dry ingredients before combining with the wet. This recipe is perfect as is, best French toast I have ever made. Perfect and brown on the outside, nice and soft/moist/fluffy on the inside. Not dry at all and not at all soggy like some others have stated. My family was raving, even my picky son couldn't stop telling me how much he loved it. This recipe is a keeper for us!

I've used this recipe twice now when making French toast. and I think I'll be using it from now on.  Really delicious and great texture!  The flour really does make a difference!  However,  there was no way I could get 12 thick slices out of that amount of batter.  Both times I was able to get just 8 and the slices were not that thick.  Just a comment though and certainly not a deal breaker.

I read the comments first and added brown sugar along with the white sugar and ground nutmeg. They were nice and fluff only thing is I would have liked a little bit more flavor to them. Other than that they were great!

We followed the recipe as written and found the taste to be average.  In reading the five star reviews, I noticed that most mention to tweak amounts/timing  of vanilla and cinnamon.

I am no cook but this made me look good on Mother's Day.

I did a couple things: I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg based on suggestions and I used brioche bread for sweetness.

I whisked everything together and put it in a wide baking pan and put in each bread to soak for 10 minutes on one side and 10 on the other.  Do not over soak these or they will get soggy in the middle.  Ensure that the the bread is only half submerged.  Further, I used half butter and half vegetable oil for cooking - I found this to give the best golden colour and be very forgiving for first time cooks - ie. less prone to burning.

Wife and Mom loved it - making it for my nieces next!

Easy and amazing.  My 10 year old son is extremely finicky and he said that this was the best French Toast ever!!  I agree with him.

I was a little nervous about adding flour since I'd never seen that in a French toast recipe but wow! So delicious! I sprinkled the cinnamon on each piece after dipping in the mixture as another person suggested and it was perfect!

7.18.17  This was good but, honestly, I don’t see what the flour brings to this french toast.  We could not taste any difference in flavor or texture, so I have to ask myself why  add it?  Was expecting something a bit outside-the-box, didn’t find it, so I’ll just continue to omit flour in the future.  Other than the flour addition, this is pretty much a standard french toast recipe, and that’s not to say it’s bad because it isn’t, just not for us.

I didn't measure the flour, but added two heaping tablespoons and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I ended up with a slightly soggy glutenous toast that didn't rise like regular french toast. I will definitely stick to the old way of doing things...

It was my first time cooking a meal of my own for my family and they all really enjoyed it, one thing I did do was cook it on high to make it a faster cook. I still had the same results but I had to watch them more closely.

Perfect French toast recipe - exactly what I was looking for when I did a search for French Toast  (seems elementary but was surprised at the extreme variations!) Will definitely make again and the only thing I did differently was double the vanilla cos we love vanilla

The toast turned out as I imagined. I did not have thick-cut toast on hand as I had freshly baked whole wheat bread from my local grocery store (and I used whole wheat flour in the recipe - the nutty flavor is deluxe). I was able to get eight slices soaked before running out of batter. Naturally, I whisked the batter after each session of bread soaking. I'm not that basic to not do otherwise. Also, I put my eggs through a sieve before whisking and adding them to my batter. This provided for a full-of-air batter that was delightful! This recipe is top notch!

Hi. I literally just made this recipe. Tickle me in pink! I finally, found the perfect French Toast recipe. It's easy. Tastes wonderful. My daughter loved it. A few things I did different from the reciepe: I used lactose free milk becasue I'm  lactose intolerance. I added more cinnamon and a pinch or two of nutmeg along with a few splashes of lemon juice. I used all other ingredients outlined in the reciepe. The magic of the reciepe was the fact that I used brioche - non GMO bread  from Fresh-Time farmers market. Mmmmm.... Goodness. Thanks, Allrecipe for a heavenly reciepe #ilovefrenchtoast ??????????

Woke up and the sun was shinning.  Went ahead and did my morning chores... My stomach started to rumble so I knew it was time to feed my belly.  The only thing was... I didn't know what I wanted to eat.  Nothing in the refrigerator was catching my  eyes or making my stomach rumble in excitement.  I headed straight to my lap top and popped up this site.  I knew I would find something delicious!!  That I did, I tried this recipe and it was delicious.  It was fluffy, the flavors were just right!!  I had side order of ham along with these delicious french toast and my stomach was quiet and content!! 2 thumbs up!! Thank you for sharing your recipe!!  :)

Don't put on medium heat or else it'll burn in 2 seconds. I would put it in between med and low heat, but besides that it came out good.

Flour! Finally, a recipe that produces the right textured French Toast. I don't add the sugar just personal preference but this recipe is the best that I've come by!

This made good French toast, however my flour was floating around in lumps and I even use a electric mixer to change it, and it helped a little. When I got to the end where most of the flour was then it was fluffy for me. Just a little bit better than any other French toast recipe.

Wanted to add some pictures to my earlier review. These were a hit with my family. The only addition I made was some nutmeg to the dry ingredients. I also found that mixing/sifting the dry ingredients together before slowly adding the milk and eggs made the resulting batter more cohesive. The flour did not settle as much between each dip nor did the cinnamon separate. Will definitely keep this in my repertoire!

I did not deviate from this recipe and it was amazing!! My wife and I loved every morsel. The recipe makes quite a bit of French Toast, so I cut the recipe in half. It made six. As I recall, it was perfect to warm up in a toaster the next day. Great recipe!

Good and simple recipe. Flour gives it a little more body. Used staled bread to help with absorption.  Definitely a keeper.

This is a fantastic recipe! The only changes I made were half white sugar, and half brown. I also use coconut oil to grease my griddle, and I lightly buttered a baking sheet and placed the slices on it in a 375° oven for about 7-10 minutes to cook the inside and make it fluffier.

I made this for breakfast this morning and we loved it. We sprinkled a little confectioner's sugar on top. I'd double the recipe next time as it didn't make as much as I would've liked (barely enough for 6 slices of regular bread). However, I would make it again. Thumbs up!

I have been making this recipe for at least two years now, exactly as is. My husband loves it and requests it every Sunday for breakfast. This week he can’t even wait until Sunday and has asked for it this Saturday morning. I am cooking it now. It is perfect exactly as is. Fluffy and delicious.

Made this for our stay-cation breakfast and my husband said "(swear word) that's good!" He had a migraine and was only going to have 2 pieces, but went back for a third because he loved it. Made the house smell great for hours and used real maple syrup the hubby's family sugar shack. I also fried up the leftover batter and cooked it like pancake/crepe...turned out pretty good too!

My kids love it!!  Very fluffy.  I used honey as opposed to sugar and a bit of salted caramel syrup.  Best recipe for french toast I have found so far.

We really like this recipe, we've tried it a few times. Think blueberry/strawberry is my our fruit combo and I prefer to use a French sour dough loaf. This is a fairly simple recipe and is quick to prep too! If you haven't eaten, give it a try  #deliciousness #yum #fluffyfrenchtoast #homemade #itswahtsforbreakfast #sundaybrunch

This turned great.  I did not change anything, but did serve it with fresh, sweetened, whipped cream. That probably made up for extra sugar that people added.  Served it with ground cinnamon and ground cloves at the table for each person to sprinkle as they liked.  For bread, I used two day old French loaves cut into two inch thick slices.  It turned out nice and not even a little bit soggy. The combination of thick sliced French bread, sweet whipped cream, cinnamon, cloves, and pancake syrup almost had a cinnamon roll flavor.  Thumbs up! Thank you for the recipe!

I don't typically like French toast (or pancakes or waffles), but my husband had been asking me to make some, so I set out to find the best recipe I could. This one is awesome! After reading some reviews, I decided to double the cinnamon, but planned to leave the vanilla the same. One minor hiccup though, I must have been too tired to correctly follow the recipe, because instead of a tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla, I added a tbsp of each.... And it was wonderful!! Both my husband and I gobbled it up. We will absolutely be making this recipe again... And soon!

Great recipe! The french toast was fluffy, as promised, and the whole family loved it! I used Italian-style bread from my local bakery. I doubled the vanilla and cinnamon, but other than that, the recipe was perfect!

The boyfriend said it was the best he's had in a long time. Used brown sugar instead of white. Dried out sliced sourdough bread in the oven for about 5 min at 200 degrees. Was very tasty.

THE BEST! I doubled the cinnamon and used 1tbsp of brown and 1tbsp of white sugar and portuguese sweet bread.  While in Newport  RI, I had breakfast at The Corner Cafe and they had Portuguese French Toast on the menu and the owner said they use portuguese sweet bread.  Bought a loaf at a local bakery and it had been in the freezer for six months waiting.  This morning saw this recipe and knew today was the day to try it..yum!  The only problem now is to find the sweet bread near me in a loaf :)

Super delicious! I added the cinnamon after I put it in the pan as others suggested. Always a hit when I need something fast for my husband

This is a brilliant recipe and it turned out lovely and very yummy. Made a slight adjustment, because we didn't have vanilla extract, and used Madagascar Vanilla but only half a teaspoon. This will be a recipe for the future.

Best French Toast recipe ever!  I love french toast and this is by far the best straightforward recipe I've ever found.  One tip follow the directions for how to incorporate the flour into this recipe otherwise it will be lumpy.

Very nice, one of the few that include flour which does make a difference. Slightly crispier than most. Use a fair bit of oil.

I'm by myself so didn't want the whole recipe so I just used the ingredients as a guide and put some of each in a bowl. I used pancake mix instead of flour because I was out of flour. It turned out great!

this came out so yummy! it didnt have that "eggy" taste that some recipes have. i added a little nutmeg like some of the reviews suggested and also sprinkled some cinnamon on the toast when it was on the pan.

I think the type of bread you use is important so I selected French Brioche which was perfect.  I blended white and brown sugar as well.  Also, like others, I added more vanilla than the recipe called for.  My mistake was for effect I sprinkled some powder sugar on  just before serving and that made it a little bit too sweet for our tastes - portions without it were very good,

Delicious! Changes made as follows: Doubled the cinnamon and vanilla (honestly, could have even gone further, but I tend to like bold flavors.), added brown sugar in equal parts to the white sugar and I used a thick (Cinnabon brand) cinnamon swirl bread. Fluffy and flavorful!

Amazing French Toast!  And the best part, you will look like a great chef in the process for something that is very easy to cook.  Suggestion though it to double the recipe, if you have a hungry family or don't mind a couple left overs. Oh and add more cinnamon along the way to egg wash as it get's used up.

Cut it down to 4 servings.  Only got two pieces of bread out of it.  It was kind of soggy.  Taste wise...ok.   Husband did not care for it.  He prefers more of a crunch.

Recipe is easy to follow and make. Used butter to grease skillet and french toasts came out well toasted on the outside and soft & moist in the inside. Not very sweet which is a plus. When adding maple syrup, the toasts keep its toasted outside and the flavor is enhanced.  Boyfriend was very happy and enjoyed it very much. I will be using this recipe again!

Maybe it was the bread that I used, but this French Toast turned out a bit too dry for me... I think I'll just stick to the standard recipe in the future.

Very good French toast.  And it freezes great.  I do a whole life and freeze whatever we don't eat initially.  Warm up in the toaster oven for easy, great tasting French toast any day of the week!!

This was so yummy! Didn't change a thing, except (and I have no CLUE has this happened) but when I made it, it wasn't near enough egg mix for 12 slices of bread. Not sure if the OP was using smaller pieces or what, but I used Aunt Millie's 15 Grain bread (which made me feel super healthy haha) and they are admittedly bigger pieces but still....I could only get about seven really fluffy ones and one wimpy eighth piece that my toddler happily ate and was none the wiser. I will say that I did soak my bread in the egg mix longer as I like it very saturated; maybe that was the issue...either way I LOVED it and my family did as well! I will definitely be making this again. And next time, I will double recipe so I can have leftovers to freeze for later (as another poster mentioned) because leftovers of this stuff would make me very happy :)

Best french toast I've ever had.  We ran out of regular white sugar so I substituted with vanilla sugar and skipped the vanilla extract.  I also used a raisin egg-bread which added tiny bursts of sweetness to each bite.  I experimented with cooking times and you definitely want to cook the bread until you see dark patches so that it is cooked through, just don't let it burn.

I made the recipe exactly even though I knew the 2 of us would never eat 12 pieces of french toast between us lol.....and pretty good!!!   Never heard of adding flour before, so I was skeptical, but it really did a nice job in making them fluffier and more like a restaurant would serve.  Also, using thick Texas Toast bread slices does wonders too.

This was FANTASTIC!!! My husband loved it and said this was the best French toast ever, I used Texas toast bread which made it better because it soak up a good amount of the liquid, I added a little more cinnamon.  If you are using Texas toast you will need more of the liquid since it soak up so much of it.  This is going to be my French toast recipe going forward, love this can't wait to make it again. ??

Pretty good!  The batter does seem to have more body to it, and it was quick to make.  I think I will use a bit more cinnamon next time but on the whole it's a good basic recipe.

This was nice, though I do recommend you mix the egg mix in a blender so it's not lumpy. I used a walnut bread loaf which tasted great and served it with syrup and bananas. Would make again.

Easy and better than the standard recipe. Look out for the serving size. I started making it before I realized it was set to 12 servings!

Added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar as suggested by other reviewers, and sprinkled cinnamon on top of each slice before cooking.

Just made this, I followed what another  reviewer recommended and doubled the vanilla and added brown sugar.   My husband says it's better than any French Toast he's ever had.  Will definitely make again.

I could definitely taste the flour in this. Also, I have NEVER put sugar in my French toast. It's just unnecessary. But, my partner liked it so, maybe it's a preference thing.

It was ok, but rather bland. The eggy flavour of French toast was lacking, it needed more cinnamon and a sprinkling of powdered sugar.

This is by far the best French toast recipe I've ever made!!  I had been searching for something that tastes more like restaurant style French toast and this is it!!  I doubled the vanilla because I love vanilla and always do, added some extra cinnamon and used multigrain bread.  My sons said it was the best French toast they had ever eaten.  So happy to have found this recipe because I have become addicted to French toast lately and it's so easy to make for breakfast!!  Looking forward to trying to freeze it and toast it as others have suggested.

I did not see much difference in the French toast. The other ingredients are what I normally use for my French toast so there was no difference in flavor. I would not add the flour again.

Just like I was hoping when it would be when the thought of french toast popped in my head. Normally I just throw together some egg milk vanilla and cinnamon but figured I would use an actual recipe. This is a little more involved but the result is definitely like a restaurant and that is better than my way. My only concern is I will likely get requests for french toast a lot in the future :)

This French toast recipe is amazing!!! I found this recipe, and it's now the only one I use. Super quick and easy, makes delicious French toast. With almost every French toast recipe, I find that the outsides cook perfectly but often the centre is undercooked. I cook up each side, and then finish them off in the oven. Have them with some whipped cream and syrup and you're good to go!! This is an awesome recipe and I definitely recommend you try!!!

Great. I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk and a mix of olive oil and smart balance since I'm insanely lactose intolerant and it was very good

These were definitely a hit and I'll make again. By far the best French toast I've ever made and possibly the best I've ever eaten.

The texture was perfect. It holds flavors very well.
I added cardamom. I can't wait to try it out with orange peel, rose water and macha.

I made the recipe as called for except for I used maple syrup instead of the sugar. We had some sort of really crusty, maybe a day stale, holey french type bread. I topped it with some mascarpone cheese mixed with maple syrup, lemon zest, and lemon juice for a little citrus zing. Very tasty and it came together quickly.

Oh. My. Goodness. This is so yummy. The only bit of whatever I have to say is to use Challah bread. That's it. This is so tasty and perfect for a weekend.

This recipe def calls for thicker, denser bread. I converted the recipe to make only 4 servings (made 3 slices of regular sliced bread). I used wheat honey bread which was pretty soft. The first slice i let soak in the mixture and it turned out way too soggy in the middle, so i just dipped the 2nd and 3rd slices. overall the recipe is good and reliable but next time ill add more cinnamon and vanilla. i got most of the flavor from the syrup, bananas and powdered sugar i added. i will use this recipe again

Best French toast I've ever made. I follow the recipe exactly except for the type of bread. I've used thin-sliced white, regular white, Texas toast, whole wheat, French bread, cinnamon raisin bread...whatever I have on hand, and it's always great. This is a definite keeper, the only recipe I use now for "regular" French toast (not baked in the oven, etc.).

I made this with Cinnamon raisin bread and it turned out perfect. My 3 yo nephew who really doesn't eat much ate 2 slices. It's crazy how something as simple as flour could make a world of difference!

I thought the addition of flour sounded intriguing, but I didn't care for it too much. I found it heavier than I like and a bit gummy.

Except for the flour, sugar and salt it's what I've been doing. I think the flour adds a much better texture. Thanks for recipe, it was great.

Yummy! I mixed all my dry ingredients together first, then whisked the milk, eggs, and vanilla in and didn't notice a problem with cinnamon settling to the bottom. I did double the cinnamon. I use organic vanilla which has a strong presence...so I left it alone. I stored some in my freezer with wax paper in between slices and hope it all comes out well. I do advise on being careful on finding that balance on dipping or soaking the bread. You want enough to coat the bread, but not so much that you soak it and you rip it to shreds getting it from the bowl to the pan. Also ad a reviewer pointed out, be sure not to blaze it up and be in a hurry. If your bread had a good coating to it then it'll need to cook on med for a while so that you dont have nice crispy edges and a completely uncooked soggy middle...unless that's what ya like.  I'm a natural butter lover and used organic salted butter to cook my toast in...and I can say it looked burnt...but it tasted aaahhhhmazing. So if you want better presentation you could do as another reviewer suggested and use butter flavored crisco. 
Anyways...great recipe. I'll be holding onto this one.

Topped it off with berries, whipped cream and powdered sugar-- Mm! Better than any dessert-style french toast I've ever gotten in a restaurant, that's for sure. Family adored it and thought so as well. I did take the advice of other reviewers and doubled the vanilla, sugar and cinnamon, however. I feel like phrase "soak bread slices in mixture until saturated" might be taken the wrong way-- I took it to mean 'soak it for a few seconds' and the already pretty squishy and somewhat thinly pre-sliced bread totally fell apart, ahaha. (Still tasted great though!).  If you have the same kinda bread, just quickly dip them as fully in the mix and get them out and onto the pan ASAP, or else they'll fall apart or be too soggy. I also recommend that you whisk the mixture before you soak a new piece of bread every time, as the cinnamon tends to float to the top when left alone for awhile, and might all go on a single piece of bread upon touching the surface.

I love this recipe! The concept of this recipe is great it is fast and simple.  y only concern is that when being placed on the sauce pan it can burn very quickly so you must be careful when cooking. But this recipe gives you a light fluffy french toast. It is a easy, simple way to make a delicious french toast!

Best French toast I've made in a long while. I took some recommendations from other reviewers and doubled the cinnamon and vanilla. As well as adding 1 TB brown sugar. I had a fresh lemon left from dinner so I added a few drops of the juice to brighten it. I made this with leftover public French bread from night before as well. And almost lost a finger as I reached for the last one.

This was so good! Mmmmm!  Made this for Mother's Day with day old homemade brioche bread.  If you are using anything other than store bought sandwich bread, be sure to soak the bread a very long time.

Never used flour in a french toast recipe but this turned out fantastic.  I added a little more cinnamon and vanilla extract but kept everything else the same.  Glad I did because I think the cinnamon would have been too faint and we really love cinnamon.  Will be putting this in my keep files.

This is a great recipe!   I followed it exactly, using stale Sunbeam TexToast bread.  The toast turns out exactly how we like it: fluffy and crispy, but soft and just slightly gooey in the middle.  Sprinkled with powdered sugar and a tiny bit of cinnamon sugar, this tastes like the best French toast ever! Weird to think that the addition of a smidgeon of flour can take regular French toast from good to great, but it does.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

The only change i made was substitute heavy cream for the milk and that was because i had some in the fridge that needed to be used before it expired. I made this for a breakfast fundraiser and it got rave reviews!! Everyone wanted the french toast. Definitely a staple in our departmental kitchen recipe book. LOVE it!!!

I had this from another site. It was called Denny's French toast. Very good and easy. A pleaser with Paula  Dean's bacon with brown sugar and chili powder.

This has been our go-to french toast recipe for several years. I typically add nutmeg (either to the mix or sprinkle it on while frying). We've used this recipe with many types/flavors of bread and it never fails.

Awesome french toast! I did change a few things though. I substituted French bread and sliced it 1" thick the night before and left it on a cookie rack overnight to dry out. It soaks up the egg mixture much better this way. I also added 4 tablespoons of sugar instead of one. My husband said it was the best french toast he has ever had! From now on it will be this recipe!

This was a huge hit.  Used French bread about 1 inch thick, was truly one of the best french toast recipes, fluffy, light and delicious.  I did use 1/2 tsp white sugar 1/2 tsp brown sugar and doubled the cinnamon. Fail proof.

Family loved it- agree with previous reviewers - doubled cinnamon & vanilla, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1 tbsp brown sugar in addition to the recipes 1 tbsp white sugar, used heavy cream instead of milk and let 1" bread soak for a few minutes each before toasting in skillet

I've tried many recipes for French Toast and this one is the best.  I don't like an "egg-y" flavor and this recipe is not overpowering with eggs.  My family loves it.  We have this in our regular rotation of homemade breakfasts.  :)

I used 3/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup French Vanilla Coffee creamer then omitted the sugar. After cooking the french toast,  I topped it with a little powdered sugar,  fresh strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, bananas, toasted coconut, slivered almonds and whipped cream with a touch of cinnamon.  I  will definitely want to make this again!

I really liked the French toast but one thing that I didn't like very much was the flavor, it was a bit bland and could use some more cinnamon. But other than that it was very good

Nice and fluffy, delicious without being dense. I did add a bit of brown sugar and tsp extra vanilla. The last time I made these I also put just a bit of orange juice in brown sugar and glazed the edges with a brush  while they were cooking then topped with fresh raspberries... My husband and children loved it. This french toast is also great as a leftover right  from  the refrigerator into the toaster. We haven't tried it after glazing yet because we didn't  have any leftover!! Thank you for this recipe!

Great recipe to work to with! I used this as a base and played around until I found what works best for the amount of people I am making French Toast for. Vanilla is key! I would suggest that the flour is unnecessary to the overall taste and it lessens the calories a bit!

Awesome recipe! Husband says it's the best french toast he's had. Although I cheated a bit... I used sliced Hawaiian sweet bread loaf. It soaks up the egg mix so well!  Mind you, it does come out pretty sweet, so either hold back on the sugar in the recipe or on the maple syrup after cooking. ;) Goes great with fresh raspberries/bananas/strawberries.

First time making French toast and I have to say I liked this recipe. I did cut back on the sugar just because I knew I was going to use powered sugar on top and coconut nectar.  Also I only had gluten free flour but it works so well in baking/cooking. I opted for the coconut nectar because it is sweeter and it's the healthiest form of sugar that won't spike the sugar levels. It's low glycemic.  I recommended this recipe :)

Wonderful recipe! The flavors are awesome and I followed the recipe exactly. My husband and kids loved this French Toast and it freezes/reheats really well.  I did use butter flavored Crisco in the pan as a review suggested and loved that idea as well,  no burnt butter! 
Thank you do much for this great recipe! This is the only way I'll make French Toast from now on.
UPDATE: This has really turned into a family favorite. My nephew had breakfast with us and the next day his mom was asking me for the recipe because now he loves it as well. Thank you so much for this recipe!!

It is a good recipe however too heavy & rich for me.  I left out the sugars & flour.  I used eggs, added the milk slowly whisked in & added the extract & last, the cinnamon.  I also added 1 tsp. Butter into egg mixture.  I coated the griddle w/spray & cooked slow on lower heat,  they turned out light & fluffy & tummy!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This has been my go  to French toast recipe since I found this recipe here. I use Crisco in the fry pan to OK, I've tried butter flavored Crisco as well. My family prefers the plain. If you double the recipe you can use the whole loaf of Texas  size bread. Also it is delicious to pop in the toaster (from the fridge) for breakfast the next couple days.  No waste of bread or ingredients. This recipe is one of my all time favorites off this site.

We loved this recipe.  I was only able to get 8 slices of bread instead of the 12 saturated.  I did refrigerate and froze - very good.  Definitely will make again.

I was expecting the flour to do something wonderful to French toast. However, it didn't. I doubled the cinnamon and vanilla, which was a good move. The directions should not say to soak the bread "until saturated." I didn't saturate, and it still took longer than usual for me to cook each piece, and I didn't really have enough batter left to cover the last piece. The French toast tasted and felt "heavier" with the added flour.

Came out great. Made with 6 yr old for Mother's Day. Used brioche and holla breads. Both rock for French toast.

This is a good recipe. It does fluff them up a bit. I only made three toast so I had lots of batter left over. So I cooked it. It was exactly like a crepe. Thinking about the recipe here it's essentially crepe batter with some added flavor. Very creative! I could see making some Monte Cristo's with this batter.

I made the recipe exactly as specified. Based in the other reviews maybe my expectations were too high which is why we were so disappointed. It was ok but nothing special. After the first slice I added more vanilla to the mix. Eventually though I made a sugar/cinammon mix and took to sprinkling that on the slices as they came out of the pan. Also, not sure if the bread where I live is large or super absorbent but I only got 6 (and a bit) slices out of it.

Very good. I was only able to coat 8-9 slices of bread because I like my french toast to soak for 10-15 minutes before cooking. I don't like chewy centers of bread, I like custard all the way through. I will double the recipe in the future.

The flavor was excellent and added brown sugar as another rating suggested. 
I have to give it 4 stars for the reason if you use Texas toast (as the recipe calls for or a thick sliced bread) it will barely do 6 slices. You would have to double to do 12. 
 I did not over soak since the bread will only absord so much and it was well drained off each slice before placing on griddle. Took only 12-15 min to cook at 300 degrees. 20 min would have been overdone.

I can't say enough about how amazing these are! I had given up on french toast....too many soggy recipes. But after reading this one, along with the reciews, I had to make it! Per other very good suggestions,  I doubled vanilla and cinnamon,  and used 1 Tbsp white and brown sugar. These are simply the best ever! Crisp on the outside with just the right amount of softness on the inside.   I found that 1 batch of mix only coated 8 slices of bread.  Thanks so much! ????

Very good! - Made a double batch so I could have left over (only 2 of us) Great in the toaster. Made a small addition and that was to add nutmeg. Made a double batch is just about right for a full lull loaf of French bread. It will be my go to French toast recipe

I never have my pan smoking hot as shown here. If you dome the toast while cooking on medium heat, the outside will be golden brown and the inside cooked not runny.

Very nice recipe as is; however, I do modify it a bit.  One thing I do is to substitute regular vanilla extract for McCormick Vanilla Nut flavoring; just gives a kick of flavor.  The second thing I do is add ground nutmeg (equal to the amount of cinnamon), and then keep sprinkling more cinnamon and nutmeg into the batter as I dip more bread, as it tends to pull those two items out pretty quickly.  Other than that, I butter my finished toasts, dust with powdered sugar, and just enough syrup to cover the toast.

I am 66 and my Mom always made French Toast with flour. Only difference is that my Mom used evaporated  milk and I use heavy cream.  We used some of the batter as crepes, soooo good too. An old french recipe that I love.

Like others I doubled the vanilla and cinnamon. I used a French baguette but I could've used two. The mixture soaks a lot of bread. I'll definitely make it again.

Good recipe for my signature French toast. 

3-4 oz. lemon curd creamed together with a softened package cream cheese. 2 lbs. strawberries macerated over night. Whipped cream (about 1/2+  pint heavy cream, sugar, vanilla etc. optional). (The kids like banana extract)

Pile up the toast with a smear of cream cheese mixture between each slice(it will melt), cover in strawberry goodness with whipped cream on top. 

It's really filling!

I thought it made the bread or coating on it, was a bit dry, and there was not enough cinnamon or vanilla in this either.

I saw this French Toast recipe in my email and I am a huge sucker for French Toast.  My original recipe is just eggs and a little bit of milk whisked together.  I have been using this recipe for more than 20 years .  After seeing this other recipe, I wanted to make it instantly.

Now for starters it was very easy to make and took me about 5 minutes or less to make this fabulous French Toast batter.  I just watch the video and followed the written recipe.  

I used regular whole grain bread instead of thick bread, because that is what I had.  The batter smelled terrific and after dipping and placing the bread on griddle, the nice cinnamon and vanilla aroma that came into the kitchen was just awesome.  Now,  I am one not for cinnamon in or on my french toast, but  with the vanilla in the batter, the cinnamon was not strong for me.

So after cooking the french toast and placing it on the plate, the smell was so good i couldn't wait to dig in.  I did lightly butter the  french toast  and drizzle lightly with maple syrup.  The first taste I got was the vanilla taste and later the cinnamon.  The french toast was so good, I would definitely make this again .

This was my first time making french toast at home and I accidentally dropped way more cinnamon in the mix than this called for but it was absolutely delicious!

I have made this French Toast for years. It always comes out fluffy  and tasty. A few key things are essential to this; use thick slice French bread or Texas Toast bread, more cinnamon as needed, and fry until fully golden brown on both sides. The flavor of the egg does come through and the combination of all the ingredients creates a special breakfast taste treat. It doesn't have to be limited to breakfast though.

I love french toast but hate soggy middles.  The flour makes it so much better.  I even put it in the oven for about 10 minutes at 325 degrees to make sure the middle is cooked.  This is now my go-to for french toast.

Swapped out the milk with almond milk, which gave it a nice subtle flavour.  It was hit with both hubby and I.

We like to add nutmeg to this. So yummy! We alternate between this and the recipe for fluffy pancakes on Saturdays. Serve with sausage (usually Morningstar soy sausage patties as we have a vegetarian in our family) and orange and banana slices for a truly delightful meal!

I have three teenage boys and they said "Dad dropped the bomb on French toast". I made it with Texas toast, topped it with cream cheese frosting, boysenberry syrup and Strawberry's. It's really good.

Very tasty! Nice crispy outer layer. Wish I had Texas toast to use, but worked fine with the regular bread I had. One serving should really be two pieces of bread. Great recipe and added to my favorites.

This was delicious!  My fiancé wanted to make his own French toast with only eggs.  He could t believe I was putting flour in my recipe.  He absolutely loved it!  Says he'll never question my recipe cooking again!  Best French toast I've ever had.

I love this recipe!  I don't usually enjoy homemade French toast because of the streaky sweet egg taste and texture.  This is totally different-- delicious, toasted on the outside and soft on the inside.  I followed the advice to up the vanilla and cinnamon and then served the toast with fresh blackberries, melted white chocolate, and maple syrup.  Heaven!!!

I love French toast but I'm terrible at making it. I just made this recipe and it was amazing!! I used English muffins because it was all I had and it still made them fluffy and perfect!

Great recipe! I didn't have any flour but I did have a flour-based strudel made from flour, sugar, cinnamon, butter and vanilla. So I substituted the flour with that and added a touch of nutmeg and a few chopped pecans to the recipe. Of course a side of venison breakfast sausage completes the recipe. Turned out fantastic!

Never have added flour to the mixture but it was great!! Made it more creamy and not so watery mixture! Definitely put this recipe in my recipe book and will be making often. Kids(3 & 5yrs) and husband highly approved!!!

I've made this many times, and it is always great.  I usually add more milk to make it stretch further, but the taste and results are always spectacular.

Another decent French Toast recipe.  This recipe only lacks the freshly grated nutmeg to send it over the top.  Also consider reducing the vanilla by half.

Yum yum yum. I used a fresh sour dough loaf which gave this a little bite. The recipe was perfect though. Officially how I will make French toast every time now.

This has been my go-to french toast recipe for a couple of years, and it's great. When I use cinnamon bread to make it no added syrup is needed.

Very good.  Easy to make.  It's great for cheap breads Wonder Bread and Schwebel's.  The flour adds mass while staying light and fluffy.

I used a half tablespoon of butter to oil the pan.  With the flour in the egg wash, it gave the toast a nice crispy corner.  I also add a sprinkle of powdered sugar and whatever fresh fruit I have on hand (bananas, blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, etc.).

Excellent!! Made exactly how written using Texas Toast although I was able to get about 8 slices saturated, not 12.  Really good and will be using this as my go-to french toast recipe here on out.

Very good. Used thick pepperidge farm French toast but will try with regular bread. Served with bananas. Made for maybe the 3rd time?.... This will be the go to recipe for french toast. Heated bananas this time; really good and really simple.

this dish was really good and easy to make. I tried to make it with coconut oil, I liked it  but I liked the flavor of the butter Crisco better. If you are wanting less calories then the coconut oil is a good way to go.

This is a great recipe.  It is simple to make and the kids and grand kids love it.  I didn't see any reason to change a thing.   You don't mess with perfection.  This is one of the most requested food items by any of the family when they are at home.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it turned out great! I used day-old French bread sliced pproximately one inch thick.  Great with maple syrup and maple bacon.

Love this recipe! Very easy to add or change flavors. I've made several variations using either, almond extract, puréed/mashed banana, shredded coconut, mashed strawberries or a little cocoa powder with an extra tsp of light brown sugar.

These were average... In general, it was lacking a bit of flavor and I felt like I could've added a bit more cinnamon and vanilla (like the other reviews said).

S'cuse me for being rude and chewing mid-type.   Mmmmm...  This is an AWESOME recipe and you sort of get the idea it will be when you are mixing the ingredients, a thick and silky concoction of classic French toast perfection.   Made ours with hippy dippy bread (Alpine Valley), on the griddle to whip it all up at one time.   Perfect custard-like inside and it is oh-so-good.

This turned out really good! It was light and airy. I used cinnamon bread thickly sliced and substitutes pumpkin spice for the cinnamon as a slight variation. My daughter gobbled it all up.

I make this at least once a week - I would give it 5 stars as is, but I add a little more vanilla and a little brown sugar now and based on that it would be a 6.  But that's just personal preference. Great recipe!

I made this and it came out great! I used regular sw bread and they come out super thick, and crispy (that's how I like them). The non crispy ones I made were not soggy in the middle and came out perfect. my family loved it. I was not able to get 12 slices with these portions, but that could be that I soaked  the first 4 too much. I got 9 slices/ servings only, but they were so thick that everyone only needed 2 slices so it was enough for 4 of us. I would recommend to anyone

This was the best french toast yet.  I used half and half instead of milk.  I also cut thick slices of french toast.  I browned both sides and then stuck them in the oven at 300 degrees for about 10 minutes so the inside of the toast was baked and not soggy

This was good, but definitely plan to double the egg mixture if you want 12 slices. This just barely made 6 for me and I had to use a rubber spatula to scrape out every last drop for the last piece. I would also add more cinnamon, but that's just a personal preference.

The French toast was very fluffy indeed! We followed the other reviewers' suggestions and doubled the cinnamon, vanilla and sugar; felt it was still a bit under seasoned.  The kiddos gobbled it up. Will definitely make again!

We are on a dairy free diet, so we made them using coconut milk. They turned out excellent! I will be keeping this recipe for the future.

This was a really good recipe, My family said it was the best French toast I have ever made in my life ( and I have made a lot of French toasts). The only exception is that I used self rising flour instead of all purpose ( I didn't have any all purpose flour on hand) but it still turned out good. I only gave it 4 stars because it still had that weird taste like the flour - egg mixture was peeling off the bread, but other than that, it was the best french toast I have ever tasted!!!

This recipe was great. The fact that the sugar and cinnamon was right in the batter made the toast sweet already, add a bit of maple syrup and it was perfect. I'll definitely be making this again.

My go-to french toast recipe.  I increase the vanilla, cinnamon, and sugar.  (I like my french toast to have a lot of flavor and sweetness before adding syrup.  The flour really adds the fluffiness to this fluffy french toast.  Don't skip it!

This turned out great! I used coconut oil for frying.  I poured half of the egg mixture into a 9x13 dish, soaked 6 of the bread slices, flipped them and soaked again, then fried them.  I let the remaining 6 slices soak while I cooked the first 6.  I was able to make 12 slices with Texas toast with no problem.

A delicious variation on basic french toast.  Be sure to use a hearty, thick bread, like Pep Farm Farmhouse Hearty White.  Don't use standard white bread, you'll be disappointed.

I followed the recipe and added a little bit of pureed banana. I saturated bread in batter just like it says  in the recipe (I used Texas toast), but instead of 12 slices it was only enough for 6. Maybe I overdid it with soaking, but after frying them in the pan, they turned out to be a bit too soggy. Next time I'll try to only dip them in the batter, not "saturate".

My kids loved it. The only problem I had is that I didn't get 12 servings out of one batch! It made 9 regular sliced breads. Otherwise, it was wonderful!

The best French toast I have ever had or made by far!  I use challah bread when I can but it is delicious no matter what you use.  I wrap pieces individually in Saran and freeze.  Just pop them into the toaster to  warm and they taste as good as they do directly out of the skillet!  Thanks for this easy but special recipe!

This was delicious. I'm a college student, so I don't have too much time too cool, but this was simple and easy. I bought a French bread baguette from the grocery and it tasted so delicious and fluffy. Also, I didn't see the recipe called for flour when I was in the store, so I didn't use any of that. But my friend and I loved. It. I'll be making it again for sure!!!!

I'm sure original recipe would've been fine,  but I added a little more vanilla.   Also it wasn't a big deal but I could only get 9 pieces of Texas toast out of it.  Family loved it .  Leftovers for breakfast reheated easily in the toaster.

Yummy!! My 4 year old son and I loved it! Nice and fluffy not soggy! I doubled on the cinnamon and vanilla, it was delicious! I've always tried to make french toast and it wouldn't come out right or to the taste I liked and this one was perfect, wow!

I was looking at French Toast recipes, just to see if there was something different from my basic recipe out there. The fact that this one had flour in it immediately interested me. Thicker batter! Why didn't I think of this!?! I didn't change anything & the toast was perfectly golden, delicious, & you do not need to double the sugar if you are serving it with syrup, powdered sugar, jelly or jam. This is going straight into my recipe box.

It did not make nearly enough batter I made enough for four and barely had enough to halfway saturate the bread. I would also suggest adding more sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla extract would make it better. Overall a good recipe.

Very good!  Easy to adapt to your taste in spices. 
- Let the bread dry out over night before 
- Doubled the Cinnamon
- Added 1/4th tsp Nutmeg
- Doubled the Vanilla
- Added 1 tbsp Light Brown Sugar
- Used Light Vanilla Soy Milk

I've been using this recipe for a while now, and so far my family and I have yet to be disappointed by it. The recipe as is, is pretty good. I prefer to tweak it by adding extra cinnamon, a healthy dash of both ground ginger and nutmeg. I also double the sugar. After cooking the toast in butter I sprinkle both sides with cinnamon sugar and serve with warm syrup....YUM!

This recipe is fantastic! I used four large slices of rye bread, cut in half to make eight slices, and it used up every bit of the batter. Great recipe, easy to make, and delicious results. Will definitely make again! (I also used almond milk instead of regular milk and it was still good!)

I added some nutmeg with the cinnamon and topped with banana and whipped cream. I used Kings Hawaiian sliced bread which absorbed more batter than expected. Total yield was only 6 slices. If using this bread do not dip in batter too long. It quickly falls apart.

I've made this quite a few times and love the extra crunch from the flour ! I add some extra cinnamon and used half milk have vanilla coffee creamer along with the vanilla it calls for to add some extra flavor but it's good the way it is.

This was good. Made it with day old loaf of white bread from a bakery.  I just cut the slices thick.  Will make this again, but maybe cut the slices a little thinner because I don't like when it's soggy.

I've had some epic fails in my French Toast quest but that is no more.  This recipe is super simple and perfect. I used cheap white bread and the results were  impressive everyone loved it. Whisking the milk in with the flour slowly is an important step to keep the batter smooth.  Thanks for sharing. Love love love...

best french toast, i see the one star complaints about the center being soggy, if you dont like it that way, just lay the bread in the batter, immediately flip it and pull it out.  Don't soak it and the center wont be soggy. thanks for sharing this recipe :)

EXCELLENT!!  The best french toast I ever made!  I do sprinkle the cinnamon on at the end because if it's added to the ingredients, your first piece of french toast steals all of the cinnamon.

This recipe is delicious and the flour just made it that much better.  I did make a batch of 6 using the original recipe and that worked but when I used half of all the ingredients I ran out of the mix. Overall, I think that I am going to use this recipe a lot!

Tops.  I don't see a reason to ever order soggy French toast at a restaurant again.  The flour makes a difference and using a Nutty bread was my favorite rendition.   French bread was too boring.  The cranberry white chocolate loaf I initially used had large lumps of brown sugar in it, so I used the sugar in the custard,  which was yummy.

Excellent! I used an Italian rustic loaf that I thickly sliced and made a third of the recipe (one egg). The liquid didn't look like enough, so I added a little more milk, and it was all used up to soak into the thick slices. I loved that the outside turned out crunchy in parts, something you don't get with regular French toast (maybe the flour did it?). Will definitely make this again and add fresh fruit or use another bread like Challah. Thanks for the simple and great recipe, Bonnie!

Found this recipe just this morning. Took my first bites a few minutes ago. Quite yummy and easy!  I added hazelnut flavoring instead of vanilla and more cinnamon. I also used a light coating of peanut oil on the griddle. Whisk the batter frequently or you will end up with gunk at the bottom that is too sweet. I was glad the batter was exactly the right amount.

Perfect, absolutely perfect. Used raisin bread similar to a challah bread, a great density to hold its shape and soak up the mixture. The flour allows all the ingredients to stick together, creating perfect coverage for the bread.

One time I tried making it with gluten free flour, egg beaters, and almond milk. Still tastes fabulous!!

This recipe produced perfect, restaurant-style french toast for us. I doubled it, and used a full loaf of Texas toast (17 slices). I made it the night before, cooled on wire racks, then stored in fridge for a quick Easter morning reheat in the toaster and it was still beautiful and crispy. My only alteration was to double the amount of cinnamon and add brown sugar in equal proportion to the white sugar. I whisked the dry ingredients together before adding the milk and fried in a combination of half butter, half butter flavored crisco.  This is our new keeper!  Thank you!

I had bought some bread and it was left too close to a heat vent and it turned hard. So I used it to make french Toast  - my family gave this recipe the thumbs up and they gobbled up the toast. It's a keeper. Thanks for sharing

Delicious according to our 8 year old. Flour does seem to be the difference from previous versions of French toast I have made.

Wonderful recipe! The only change I make is I don't add the cinnamon to the mixture. Instead, I put the cinnamon in a little sifter and dust it over the bread while it's in the pan cooking. You'll need to quickly wipe the pan clean with a paper towel between slices of bread, but I think this is the best way to get an even distribution of cinnamon on all slices of bread. This way I don't need to be worried about the cinnamon rising to the top of the bowl.

Can I just say Yummy!  I made these with Kings Hawaiian rolls and they came out delicious!  Everyone asked for more and they were very simple to make so I prepared another batch for seconds.  I plan on making them again this weekend.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

It just tasted like French toast, nothing extraordinary.  I would probably add some more spices, like clove and nutmeg, next time to up the flavor a bit.

Still prefer baked french toast with French bread but this is probably a really good base for creativity. Used Texas toast.  Made with banana caramel sauce (using heavy whipping cream instead of half and half) from banana crepes and made it a 5.

This recipe makes, hands down, the absolute BEST french toast I have ever had!  I added an additional 2 teaspoons strawberry extract (along with the vanilla extract the recipe calls for) and I put warm strawberry syrup on top, and it was just mouth watering.  I'll be sticking to this recipe for my french toast from here on out, that's for certain.

I love this recipe! I make it with lactose free milk and it really does taste like the French toast I get at my favorite breakfast restaurant just without the terrible stomach ache after.  If you're going to make this recipe Make sure you remember to stir the batter before every new dip of bread and make sure your griddle is greased constantly. I just spray some Pam after every slice and that prevents those ugly black burns and the egg mixture sticking.

Nice. Changes:  used brown sugar instead of white sugar, used a buttermilk, used Apple pie spice instead of cinnamon, double the amount.  Used coconut oil for frying, used brioche thick- sliced bread.  came out very nice.  Made plenty to pop in toaster for breakfast tomorrow. Will def be using recipe again.

Used the reviews of others and the end product was delicious. 1) used ciabatta bread one time and then Italian bread another - both work well 2) added nutmeg, 3) used Crisco, and 4) sprinkled cinnamon on each side when flipping. Wonderful!

I LOVE this recipe.  I cook it in bacon grease for more flavor and top with granulated sugar, our family traditions.  I do find this recipe makes 10 slices instead of 12.

Used Amish White Bread to make these. Simple recipe and the kidlets love it. Next time I would like to top with blueberries, strawberry slices, and powdered sugar. Probably make again for the first day of school.

A big hit! I usually make it as written-adding a tad more sugar, vanilla & cinnamon-then sprinkling with powdered sugar.

I made it while my brother and sister in law were in town-my BIL is lactose intolerant so I used unsweetened vanilla soy milk in place of the regular milk-all other ingredients were the same.  Couldn't tell a difference at all.

I tried this recipe this morning. It was pretty good. I would prefer less vanilla taste and more cinnamon. Next time I'll increase the cinnamon and decrease the vanilla extract.

This recipe has stellar flavor. I was concerned when I saw clumps of cinnamon in the batter, but I stirred it once more and it was amazing. I used ordinary wheat bread, but next time I will try to make homemade bread and cut it thickly. When you dip the bread in the mixture, make sure you saturate it until it is dripping. Since my bread was cut thin, I could used 18 pieces. Enjoy!

I too have tried many different recipes and many different breads and it never came out right.  I bought Broche Rolls at Trader Joe's at the suggestion of the cashier to try it for this very reason, French Toast and then I looked for a recipe.  THIS ONE ROCKS!!!  I just made it this morning and added everything according to the recipe and a pinch of nutmeg and it was AWESOME.  I am definitely sending this to all my girlfriends to be added to their recipe books.

don't soak the bread too long because it doesn't cook well, i learned that the hard way. mix some ground cinnamon and white sugar, for perfect cinnamon sugar to go on top with some syrup... also I added some strawberries that were soaking in white sugar, it was delicious (:

I was craving french toast this morning so I came to Allrecipes and found this one at the top of the search results list. I had all the ingredients and the only change I made was adjusting the serving size from 12 to 8. My Fluffy French Toast came out perfect! I only had basic sandwich wheat bread on-hand yet it still turned out wonderful. Next time I will buy really good bread to make it extra special. YUM!

Just like mom used to make! I had a craving for French Toast and this hit the spot. It was a nice fluffy toast which is what I'm used to. The only thing I had wished for was more cinnamon flavor. After reading  reviews I realized others said the same and added more cinnamon. Should have read reviews first! Also, the picture shows the toast topped with powdered sugar but the recipe doesn't call for it. Don't make this without powdered sugar!

This is my go to recipe for french toast. The added flour really does make it fluffy! My kids love it! Make sure you follow the directions about slowing whisking the milk into the flour, otherwise you will end up with lumps of flour at the top. The same goes with the rest of the ingredients.

I haven't made French Toast in 15+ years but have been cooking for our family construction crew on house project last several months and was tired of egg dishes.  This was easy to make ahead and keep warm 'til they were ready to eat -- then it disappeared.  I think the flour is a great "secret" to keeping toast firm.

Thank you!!!  My family was coming over for breakfast on Father's Day, and after asking what they would like I received several requests for French toast. Yikes! I'd never made French toast! I decided not to tell them that because I felt confident I would find a good recipe here on my favorite site. This recipe is fantastic!! It's easy, quick, mad my french toast was a hit! They all wanted seconds and my one son ate 3 slices.  I purchased Texas Toast bread for its thickness, followed the recipe exactly, and all was well.  Thanks for this recipe.

It really didn't turn out right, I had to add water, and it still didn't make as much as the recipe indicated (without using Texas or similar toast!). Very little flavor.

I loved this recipe!  Mine was still soggy, but I may have let the bread soak a bit too long.  I had italian bread that was cut thick so I wanted to let the bread soak just for a minute.  I may have overdone that.  I really enjoyed the flavor, as did my husband and my one year old.  YUM!

This is a very good recipe on its own, but the second time I made it I tweaked it by adding a whipped egg white just before soaking my bread.  It was Next Level awesome.

This is a great recipe. It uses far more milk and less egg than I am used to, but we all enjoyed it. I'm glad we tried it.

Best French Toast I've made!  I think I would add a bit more cinnamon and vanilla next time.  I also like the idea of adding pureed bananas that someone else suggested.

Sooo good! I made it for my family and they all loved it! The only problem was the bread sometimes broke in the middle, but I probably just did too much milk! Great recipe!

The recipe alone, I find the french toast was a little bland. In addition to it, i'd suggest topping it with cinnamon and brown sugar to add taste. We also added Strawberries and blueberries.

great recipe when low on eggs and/or got a large group to feed.  2 and 4 yrs old as well as adults enjoyed and other than a slight cake batter taste pretty much same taste as good old fashion french toast.

Honestly, I am so glad I found this recipe.  French toast is my favorite and I have tried so many recipes but they never taste as good as the restaurants.  I was re inspired to attempt it again when I found Texas Toast at the grocery store and so glad I did!  I normally use all the same ingredients minus the flour; the flour is the trick!  It gives it that batter-like crust.  It was so good...better than a restaurant because it was made while still wearing pj's!

These were off-the-the-chain! Following another reviewer's advice, we sprinkled cinnamon on AFTER we dipped the bread, but these were SO delish. It's my first time EVER trying these. THEY ROCKED! PLUS, I GOT TO COOK IT W/ MY DADDY! YAY! We also had scrambled eggs & ham! This is one of the best mornings EVER!

Love it! I do mix the ingredients differently for sure. Mix dry together than slowly whisk in wet ingredients (premixing the eggs as well). It helps keep cinnamon mixed throughout!

Made this french toast recipe with home made challah bread. Cook several slices and figure out how much soaking in the batter is to your liking. You may want a custardy french toast (longer soak) or a drier french toast (less soak, more of a drag through and grill).  I have never made French toast with flour in the mixture, but it really makes it work.  Make sure you whisk each time you dip your bread. The flour and cinnamon together sink to the bottom.

Delicious!  Perfect!  Yummy! Never making another recipe apart from a baked version I like. Only thing I did different was use vanilla sugar from Penzeys in place of white sugar. This recipe is perfect.

Yummy recipe!  I halved the recipe and used cinnamon swirl bread instead of plain bread.  I like the fact that this recipe wasn't too eggy since I'm not much of an egg fan.  It turned out well and I will make it often.

super quick and easy to make with ingredients you already have on hand.  and taste is so much better than regular french toast!  recipe calls for 12 slices of bread but i used regular sandwich bread and probably got closer to 9-10.  make sure you keep stirring the batter in between as all the flour tends to fall to the bottom.

This is honestly the best French toast recipie ever!!! Flour makes a massive difference!! I add a little more than 1 teaspoon of vanilla essence and serve the French toast with hot corn syrup. No room for improvements!

My wife loves french toast, I made this for her this morning, and she loves it. I used Vermont blueberry syrup and blueberries and made them as sandwiches with creamcheese spread inside with the fruit. I normally dont care for french toast, this is the exception.

Today was a Snow Day for me so with the gift of a free day I decided to celebrate by making myself a yummy breakfast.  I'm so glad that I found this recipe and gave it a try.  I really appreciated the added crispness that the flour gave to the French toast.  I had to make some adjustments though because I didn't have everything on hand.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 in place of milk and I also used butter in my pan versus oil.

I picked up some challah bread last night and searched the amazing allrecipes.com for the perfect French Toast recipe, and this one was calling my name.  My fiance told me to never make French Toast any other way again.  No substitutions at all!  I did oversoak my first 3 pieces.  If I hadn't done that, the mixture probably would have covered the whole loaf, instead I have 2 pieces leftover.  So yummy!!

Really delicious recipe!  However, I found that the egg mixture wasn't quite enough for that much bread.  I tried to make enough mixture for 8 pieces of bread, but could only coat 6.  That being said, I did leave one piece of bread in there to soak for a minute or two, and that piece soaked up a lot!  If you're saturating the bread instead of just dipping it, you'll need more egg mixture.  I also like another reviewer's idea of sprinkling cinnamon right onto the bread.  I whisked after each slice and still ran out of cinnamon in the mix.

This came out fantastic! Just as moist and delicious as I had hoped.  

I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful! I used plain whole wheat sandwich bread because it was the only type I had on hand, and usually that means sub-par French toast, but this came out amazingly.  Who knew a little flour was the only difference between dry French toast and delicious slices of perfection??

One thing-I only rated this 4 stars because as is, the egg mixture didn't make enough for 12 bread slices. I was planning on freezing the extras for later breakfasts, but I only got 6 slices out the mixture. Next time I will double it so I can have leftovers :)

Somewhat average first batch. Second batch, I made a few changes. I added a little more cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg, did 1/2 c evaporated milk and 1/2c milk instead of 1c milk. I also added brown sugar, and bam. Way better taste. Sprinkled on some powdered sugar. Cooked these on a buttered electric griddle at 350.

I thought this was a great spin on French Toast .. The flour does add a thickness that doesnt make the inside of the bread so mushy . I used milk on a previous batch , but didnt have any this time around so i used the next best thing water ... And it works just as fine ! I use butter instead of , cooking sprays and oil however .. All and all great recipe , especially with some homemade cinammon syrup !!

Amazing recipe! I have never been able to find restaurant quality French Toast... Until now. At the suggestion of another reviewer ... I added a teaspoon (heaping) of baking soda... You will be stunned at how regular bread will look when you do. I just starred at it... Really amazing... Hubby is still eating the first batch and I had to log on right away.

This recipe is great. Def stir it up each time. We also used bacon grease instead of butter/oil. Freezed the leftover with the parchment paper. This will def stay on the popular side of our breakfast meals from now on.

I didn't have regular milk, but had vanilla soy milk. So I omitted the vanilla extract in this case.  I also used the regular sliced bread since that's all I had on hand. I adjusted it to 8 servings and it worked out well. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed it!

This french toast was very good.  I only had regular bread on hand and that was good.  My girls (9 & 11) loved it also.  We will definitely add it to our morning collection.

This recipe turned out pretty well. I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 whipping cream. I also added nutmeg and a couple of small drops of almond extract. I would try this again, but use thicker bread.

This was very, very tasty! I must admit that when I first read the ingredients, I was skeptical about the flour. However, after reading all the reviews, I decided to give it a try. So glad I did! The flour really does make a wonderful difference. Didn't change a thing. Will definitely make again and again!!

I was skeptical about the addition of flour to the mix, but it worked really well. These are indeed fluffier than my basic recipe for French Toast. We will be making these again. :)

This was the 1st time I've ever made French toast in my life and it was a hit with the family. I substituted soy milk for the regular milk since I'm allergic to anything with milk protein. I also substituted brown sugar for white sugar. I pretty much followed everything else to a "T". And ofcourse i topped it off with powdered sugar. I used white Texas toast. Soaked it in the mixture and put it in a hot skillet that had oil and butter in it.  I lowered the heat to cook it slower so the inside would be cooked as well.

I liked it allot, the only problem I ran into the 2 times I made it is I feel like it's missing something. The first time I made it I followed the recipe and the second time I added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and still feels like there's something missing. I will be using this recipe again but I would like to see it really wow my husband.

We love this recipe!  I used a ninja blender to really froth up the custard and it was so much easier than stirring by hand.  This is significantly better than any other French Toast I've tried--even with regular sandwich bread!  The outsides get nice and crisp while the insides stay soft and custardy :)  YUM!

Love this recipe! I double the vanilla extract and cinnamon, also added a tablespoon of brown sugar. It seemed to be what everyone suggested and they were right, it was perfect and fluffy. Make sure to stir the mixture every time before you soak the toast because the cinnamon will float to the bottom of the bowl. Also soak the bread on each side don't just dunk it in real quick, I normally let it sit 20-30 sec on each side in the mixture. I used one of those Italian loaves of bread from the Wal-Mart bakery and it worked really well.

I've made this French Toast about a dozen times now and it never disappoints. The last few times I sliced up Como bread (on the thicker side) and it worked really well. It is the perfect recipe.

The Absolute Perfect French Toast! My family loved it and this is how we will be making French toast from now on. One thing I will experiment with is using rice flour and other flours to see how it tastes.

Great recipe!  Made today using San Luis Sourdough Bread and as written, but added 1/8 tsp of rum flavor - YUM! I was hesitant to soak the bread to saturation as having experienced really soggy burnt bread in the past with other recipes.  But I soaked the bread as instructed and couldn't believe it turned out perfect!  This recipe is a keeper.

Fantastic. I used Pepperidge Farm Hearty White bread--so the slices were pretty big. I was not able to make as many servings as the recipe is supposed to make because  the big slices soaked up a lot of the mixture. Puffy and rich with a light crispiness on the outside. Great recipe.

I made this 2 weeks ago with no adjustments and the family was very happy (2nds please!!). Now that I've made it again, the only adjustment was by adding a little more cinnamon and vanilla. Not necessary, but brings out the flavors even more on a great recipe. Try this one with Texas Toast (only dip it in the mixture for a moment as not to overwhelm the bread with egg.) Happy Cooking!!!

Yum! Definitely a keeper. Added a dash of nutmeg and baking powder in addition to doubling the vanilla and cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers.  Did taste just like French toast from a restaurant.

Tried this today its okay but still kinda bland and that was with using 1 1/2 tsp spoons of cinnamon, tsp of nutmeg, 1 1/2 tbls sugar, 2tsp vanilla pure. would use for quick meal but would not serve this to others.

Normally I don't get excited about breakfast food but this was simply mind blowing!! Using a butter spray and dusting with powdered sugar added to the flavor, i also used a maple flavored french toast bread. Top with strawberries, warmed smuckers strawberry syrup and whip cream and your in french toast heaven!!

Delicious! I think this is the first french toast recipe I saw that calls for flour, and it was an excellent call because it wasn't too runny. I will keep this recipe. Thank you Bonnie :)

I have been using this recipe all my life pretty much. Came up with it after I didn't like other french toast recipes. I never have measured it out (I'm not the type who ever really measures lol) I just eyeball it so I'm glad someone else has done the hard part for me so I can share it easier lol. The only thing I do differently is I sometimes add a little baking flour to help it be even fluffier and when I'm in the mood I'll sometimes add maple syrup right to the batter and skip plates and forks for grab and go yummy fluffy maple french toast! Thank you for sharing this, now I can share my awesome french toast recipe with my friends who have asked! :-)

Fabulous! The best french toast, bar none. I didn't expect flour to make such a difference! Most easily made in a non stick pan or griddle. In an iron or stainless pan be careful to turn only once to prevent a crispy, floury mess left behind. Served with no sugar added syrup & blueberries, this french toast is heavenly. Thank you.

I didn't realize that "Fluffy" French toast meant that it wouldn't be soft in the middle.  If you don't like soggy French toast then this recipe is for you!  :)

So easy to follow and the french toast turned out great. It's also a very forgiving recipe, I think I had too much egg (made a very small batch just to try) and it still turned out nicely. I addded some lemon juice to it - just to de-eggify it.

I used regular white bread and began by following the directions exactly.  The bread became so saturated that it fell apart in the batter.  Scooped up the remains and patted them together on the griddle and turned the heat way down - about 2 on an electric stove.  

The batter only lasted for five slices, not the twelve in the recipe.  The bread which fell apart eventually toasted well enough to eat, did not notice any flavor.

Prepared the rest of the slices by increasing the amount of egg and vanilla.  

This recipe didn't work for me, but maybe with thick Texas toast it would.

My family thought this was the best french toast they ever had. First comment was "it is so fluffy".  I think the flour is the secret! Try it for yourself!

I used whole wheat flour for more texture. I could taste the cinnamon but wanted more sweetness. After they cooked I added syrup and powdered sugar. It was a quick yummy breakfast!

Very, very good. We've begun eating a lot of breakfast foods for dinner, just for a change of pace, so we've eaten a lot of casseroles, pancakes and other breakfast foods. This recipe for French toast has gone into my permanent file; it gets made in our house again and again.

Pretty good! I had to add a little more cinnamon to the mix as I was cooking, but that's just my taste!

Made 1/3 of the recipe, to yield 4 slices. There was nowhere near enough batter. I thoroughly soaked my first 3 slices (standard white bread, not thick), and there was none left for the fourth.
They were also a lot soggier than I was predicting.

Probably will not make

I love this recipe!!!! I had made it once before but this time I modified it a little. I added a 1/4 tsp Almond extract and 1/4 tsp of  to the mixture. Also I Used Brioche and topped it with strawberries, bananas, raspberries, and whip cream.

WOW. First time I've tried making french toast. It's better than some I've had in restaurants! I cut it in half and only used one egg. Still great - but only enough batter for maybe 4 pieces.

This was really good.  I may add a little more cinnamon next time for extra flavor.  I loved the consistency the batter made.  I will make again.

Made this recipe this morning for my little one (4 y/o).. she normally eats like a bird and she requested seconds and thirds! I used cream instead of milk and more cinnamon + vanilla (to taste). Turned out amazing.

amazing!
Made 4 pieces for my sister and I along with some fried Conecuh hikory smoked sausage. Added extra vanilla (vanilla lovers over here) and put syrup and powdered sugar on top. Better than what my mom makes (don't tell her)! So fluffy and the cinnamon dd the trick.

This is our go to french toast recipe. It takes a little extra work from what I'm used to making (just eggs, cinnamon and a splash of milk) but it's worth the effort! Much more fluffy toast this way. Thanks for the recipe!

The addition of flour is GENIUS. Who knew something so simple would be so effective in achieving (or rather maintaining, as I find my past attempts at french toast tend to 'deflate' as they cool) the fluffiness. I made this recipe as is (with the exception of a dash of nutmeg), although I found 1/2 the recipe was sufficient for 3/4 of a loaf of challah bread (plenty for two people). In the future, I will plan on tweaking the recipe (i.e. adding a little more vanilla, using half-n-half instead of milk, adding a dash of OJ with orange zest grand marnier as one reviewer suggested, etc.). Definitely adding this recipe to my brunch repertoire.

Was delicious when followed exactly, however I also made a gluten-free batch by substituting the all-purpose flour with gluten-free all-purpose flour, and regular bread with gluten-free bread (lightly toasting it beforehand in order to thaw it).  Worked both ways; will make again.

I would of never thought to add flour to your egg mixture when cooking French toast... but this was just awesome and will be the only way I make it from now on. And the blueberries on this was great, my husband love it, and was simple to make. Its a keeper!!!

This tasted pretty good...but as written, a three-star is about all I can give here.  I made it as written (as I usually like to do the first time...because you can't really review a recipe if you change it).  This made only 8 pieces for me, and not 12.  I also think it could use some more cinnamon and maybe some more vanilla.  I will probably make this again and make those changes and plan for only 8 pieces...because after wiping off the excess mixture and still not getting the number I expected, I was disappointed.

I changed serving size because it was only for me and I also changed vanilla extarct to almond extract, since I didn't have the first. It came out delicious. It was fast to make. I will use it again. Thanks.

The flour in this recipe definitely helps to eliminate the sogginess from my french toast (even though the outsides were burned to a crisp). I have always wanted to master making french toast and this recipe will allow me to proudly prepare and serve a batch to my family and friends.

Delicious french toast my family loves!  That says a lot because my previous attempts were not so good.  :)  I do add a splash more vanilla to mix and sprinkle extra cinnamon on while they're on griddle.  But that is just personal preference.  Try this.  You  won't be disappointed.

Simple, easy-pleasy, delicious French toast.   I am married to a man that thinks ‘breakfast food’ is only for breakfast time.  Well on a cold, snowy, rainy winter night I decided to fix breakfast for supper.  I chose this recipe because he does like French toast.  I was right – he did like it and also enjoyed the eggs and sausage that I fixed with it.  His one comment was “this was good, but it would have been great if you would have fixed it for breakfast”!  The French toast was great, and I will be fixing it again, definitely for breakfast……..but maybe again for dinner!

Just tried this and it's amazing! I used Van de Kamp's French toast bread. I added 1/8 tsp of nutmeg to the batter (personal preference). It came out crispy on the outside and it wasn't gooey at all on the inside, perfect! I made a basic peach reduction to replace syrup and I am in love! My roommate generally doesn't like sweet things but he cleaned his plate and went back for seconds! Will definitely make again.

We doubled the cinnamon because we are big cinnamon people but the beauty of this recipe is that it is so easy to change to suit different families tastes. I also love the flour addition. I usually used pancake batter but that gave it a little too much of a cakey-ness.

I made this for a football playoff party and everyone LOVED it had comments that it was the best they have ever had at any restraunt or anywhere. The only thing I did change was I used Texas toast for the bread.

I made this recipe this morning for breakfast and it was most excellent.  Since I only had 1% milk, I used 1/2 cup of 1% milk and and 1/2 cup heavy cream.  I also added nutmeg and used Texas Toast.  The next time I make it I will ad some brown sugar as suggested by some of the previous reviewers.  I plan to freeze the few pieces I have left over and toast them  another day.  This one is a keeper!

Light and fluffy.  The flour makes a huge difference in the texture of the french toast.  This is the only way I eat french toast now.

I used a blender to mix the ingredients, I thought that would incorporate all the ingredients better than hand mixing. This was delicious, will be my go to french toast. Top it with fresh fruit and powered sugar, awesome.

Awesome recipe! I felt like such a pro making it for my boyfriend this morning! I wanted to use up a leftover loaf of italian bread from last night's dinner and it worked really well with the batter - nice and fluffy with a crispy outside.   This will definitely be my go-to recipe for french toast.

Great french toast recipe.  To prevent ingredients seperating - I first mix all dry ingredients, then beat in the eggs till smooth and add the cup of milk last.  The cinnamon and flour are perfectly blended that way and, with no seperating.  Also, I add quite a bit more cinnamon (probabaly a tablespoon).  Almost any kind of bread works great - normally I use a french or italian loaf bread sliced in two and thoroughly drenched in the mix, then slowly cooked in a covered skillet so the middle isn't soppy.  Great stuff!

Great texture and flavor!  Just like a restaurant would serve.  I used an Italian bread as it's what I had on hand.  Would be even better with Texas toast or other thick sliced bread.  This was much better than just an egg / vanilla / cinnamon dip.

This makes very good, classic french toast.  Due to my husband's food allergy, I made a gluten-free version using gluten-free bread ("Udies" brand) & gluten-free flour ("Bob's Red Mill" brand) and it turned out just fine. I do believe that your results will vary depending on what type of bread you use. I used whole grain bread (gluten-free) and it wasn't as fluffy as I would imagine it would've been had I used a wheat-based bread -- I think a brioche would be wonderful & I will try that in the future (and will edit this review to reflect that).  I also reduced the sugar slightly, as it was plenty sweet when served with syrup. With that said, it was still delicious as a gluten-free french toast and we were very pleased with the results.  I will keep this in my family recipe binder as my go-to french toast.

Wonderful recipe! The only thing I did differently was to add a little more vanilla and cinnamon and then a dusting of powdered sugar once it was plated.

Really liked this recipe!  The toast was nicely crisp when cut into with a fork and creamy on the inside.  I did up the sugar and vanilla a bit but that was the only change made.  I used high maize flour to up the fiber content. I used my own homemade, whole grain bread sliced nice and thick. I tripled the recipe and used a whole loaf of bread.  I froze the leftovers and they reheated nicely in the toaster. This recipe is a keeper!

I don't eat french toast, but my husband and kids really liked it.  They didn't think it was anything special, although the thickened egg mixture did make dipping very easy.

Three of my husband's twenty-something cousins requested that I make French Toast for them. I've had trouble in the past with French Toast not browning properly. The flour made all the difference. The girls acted like a bunch of buzzards when they descended, saying they couldn't help themselves because it was truly delicious.

We loved this recipe.  I opted to use texas toast after having issues finding sour dough bread at my local market.  I love cinnamon so I double the amount.  This was a hit in my house.

They really had a fluffier texture.  The kids liked the "cinnamony" sweetness.  I prefer the salty/butteriness of traditional french toast.

Yummy! We added a pinch of nutmeg to the recipe and as the French toast was cooking, we sprinkled it with a bit of cinnamon. Delicious! Tastes just like NJ diner French Toast!

Great!  The flour is definitely the secret.  I like to add a little OJ to the mixture too.  I personally like mine without the flour, but this is good as well and PERFECT for the kids!  Very easy to make french toast sticks with, the texture of french toast was always a turn-off to my 6 year-old until I discovered this.

I cooked this for breakfast this morning and my family gave it rave reviews!!!  I added a little more sugar and cinnamon with a dash of nutmeg.  Very simple and I had most of the ingredients.  The grocery store was out of decent french bread so I used a loaf of Italian bread and it was wonderful.  Will definitely add this to my recipe box as a keeper!  I did make sure to whisk the batter before dipping pieces to keep the flour and cinnamon mixed as suggested. I added a sprinkled powder sugar before serving!  DELISH! Thanks for sharing this!

This was absolutely delicious. My kids could not get enough of this. For the bread I used challah. If using this type of bread, you might want to increase the eggs to four or use 3 eggs and 1 egg white

Good recipe! The mix of flavors in the batter is perfect. My husband absolutely loves this. The only thing I do differently is use butter instead of oil. I do think for 12 slices of bread you would need to increase the batter ingredients. I usually make between 7 and 10 and find myself cutting it close.

I was skeptical about this recipe--it sounded like soaking your bread in thin cookie dough before cooking--but it turned out great! The addition of flour is genius, it really eliminates the sogginess that most French Toast recipes have. In the future, I think I'll increase both the vanilla and cinnamon to bump up the flavor, but otherwise it's a great recipe!

This is a great french toast recipe - it doesn't turn out all soggy, it's got excellent flavor (the cinnamon makes it even better), and it's extremely easy and quick to put together. This is my go-to when it comes to french toast! My rating is based entirely on the recipe as-is.

I think next time I would butter the bread first, and sprinkle on cinnamon, brown sugar and powdered sugar on after.  Also I would use egg bread! But good!

These are my favorite breakfast go-to! Make them the night before and freeze for a quick breakfast. I used Challa bread and do cut them thick. I do soak the bread in the batter as the areas where I didn't fully soak (edges usually), I could tell they were not moist as the others but crunchy like stale bread. I used 1Tbs of white sugar and 1/2tbs of brown sugar. Doubled the vanilla and cinnamon. The cinnamon does get taken from the batter after the first few toast are dipped so I would sprinkle a little cinnamon on the rest while they are cooking. If you are taking them out from the freezer, reheat in the microwave for just 1min 30 seconds - 2 minutes for 2 french toasts. I cover it with powdered sugar and light maple syrup.

Made it for the first time today. Family enjoyed it. The recipe states that it is for 12, but I only had enough for 6. Maybe it was the Texas Toast sized bread I got. Will have to double up next time. Did double the vanilla and cinnamon and sub'd brown sugar for the sugar. Partnered up with some peppered bacon. Will have to serve up again soon.

This is my go-to French toast recipe now!  So easy and so delicious. My picky toddler *devoured* this.  I found the batter makes fewer than 12 slices - maybe it's the bread we're using - but that's fine with me.  I will be making this again and again.

Best French toast ever! I used thick sliced French bread. The Mr raved about it & my picky 2 y.o. loved it. Won't be using any other recipe.

Very good.  Kids loved these.  It was a great way to use up some bread I had sitting around.  I had to add about 4 servings onto the recipe to get 12 or 13 slices.  Will make again.

Ok so I normally don't write reviews but felt I had to for this one. This was delicious, this will definitely be my go to recipe for French toast from now on. The other change I made was I added a bit more cinnamon everything else was as the recipe called for.

Awesome recipie! Super easy! I used hawiian bread and added a little extra sugar and cinnamon. I also added Panko breadcrumbs which makes the french toast taste like the French toast sticks from burger king! They are Japanese breadcrumbs and they have them at Costco :) great recipie thank you!

Light and fluffy! Made this with Oroweat 8 Grain bread. Delicious with blueberries and a bit of syrup. Note: I adjusted this recipe to make 4 servings (instead of 12). However, I only had enough mixture for 3 slices of bread. Perhaps it was the type/size of bread I used.

Great recipe. I used brioche bread and after cooking it for 2 minutes on each side I placed it in the oven (375) for 5 minutes. Also, since I used brioche bread I doubled the ingredients for each slice of bread, i.e. for 4 slices of bread I used the recipe for 8 servings size.

This recipe turned out to be really good. this french toast is not one of those recipes that turn out soggy. this is the best french toast Iv'e tried.For it not to be soggy you should pour the mix in to a shallow bowl.

It was a bit soggy when I tried making it. I used Vienna bread and apple pie spice instead of cinnamon. Maybe it's just me, but it was a bit slimy when we sat down to eat. Overall it's a good recipe though- flavor's nice, easy to follow instructions.

This french toast was awesome. I've tried alot of French Toast Recipes from this website, but none as good as this one. True to its name, these are the fluffiest French Toast ever; I like the fact that flour was added. Will definitely make again...

Best french toast I have ever made! I used the Pepridge Farm brown sugar and cinnamon swirl bread...to die for! I have never been a big fan of french toast because I don't like it soggy, but using the flour made it perfect. This is def going to be a regular on our weekend breakfast menu :)

This is the best tench toast I've ever made, and rivals my favorite restaurant French toast. I substituted half and half for the milk and added a little more cinnamon. Also, I used French bread, and it came out with a wonderfully crispy crust. Yum!

I halved the recipe and it was perfect for 5 slices of toast. I also lightly pre-toasted the bread slices in the toasted oven and then let them cool before dipping in batter. My picky kids loved it! A keeper.

Very good french toast to be sure to follow the instructions and whisk the milk first or it will stay lumpy.... very good french toast though

I made this french toast this morning and it was delicious! I love that cinnamon and vanilla extract give this recipe more flavor and sweetness, but the flour was a little clumpy. I mixed with a whisk but next time I make this (and I certainly will again!) I will sift the flour to get rid of clumps.

I will DEFINITELY be making this again. I followed other users suggestion and upped the cinnamon to a full tsp, and used sourdough as the bread (ended up w/ half the amount though). My hubby, who is usually a syrup junkie, ate his sans-syrup so as to enjoy the flavor and was THRILLED, as was my 4-yr old and 1-yr old. All around, the satisfaction could be found

I scaled this down to make enough for just me and my boyfriend and it was awesome. I did use almond extract instead of vanilla and it added an amazing flavor.

This the best recipe for French toast out there. I am very picky about most French toast made in restaurants, and this one was the best because I knew exactly what was in my French toast. I did add freshly grated nutmeg about half a teaspoon.

This is the best French Toast recipe I've ever tried. I used half & half instead of milk and cinnamon swirl bread. I dipped the bread slices and let them soak the batter for a minute or two before cooking them. My husband and kids all enjoyed this special breakfast treat. From now on this is is the recipe I will use. Thanks for sharing.

Loved it. It is very close to the kind my family has made for generations, just a nice improvement. Only modified to 2 eggs and one egg white and I spinkle the cinnamon on after I put them in the pan.

Yummy this is an easy french toast recipe with great flavor due to the vanilla and cinnamon. Make sure before you saturate each bread slice you mix the batter so the cinnamon and flour don't separate and your toast is even. Love how the this recipe DOSENT come out soggy! Great Basic French Toast!!

The flour really makes a difference!  I too used plain 'ole white bread (even though I love french toast w/challah bread) and the flour fluffed it up and helped to create such an amazing even, golden brown color.  Thanks for that tidbit.

About the only thing I changed was nixing the cinnamon (had none at the time) and using a like ammount of ginger with sourdough bread. My roommate considered this the best French toast she's ever had, so I'll be making again.

This is a great recipe! I used cream instead of the milk and it gave these a nice smooth texture.  This will definitely be my go to french toast recipe!

Excellent recipe-would have been 5 star, but it only made 8 slices of regular white bread. Next time I will definitely double the recipe.

Really fluffy, this will be my new go-to recipe.  However, I'd leave out the sugar.  The syrup or toppings would be sweet enough.

I made this in my Foods class at school and we thought it was absolutely delicious! When our teacher came by to ask about it, we couldn't answer because we were enjoying it too much! We added twice the cinnamon also. I'm definitely going to use this over my old french toast recipie!

Like other reviewers, I've always had problems with my french toast turning out mushy....that is....until this morning!  My french toast cooked up beautifully.  It was fluffy and moist, but not mushy at all.  My husband loved them and normally he doesn't like my french toast.  Definitely a keeper!

Just made these this morning - made a small batch (sized down to one egg) and there was just enough mixture for three one-inch thick slices of the homemade bread I made yesterday. The taste is utterly delicious, and they fried up beautifully on the pan. I had read the previous reviews so I did not "soak" the bread, just dipped it in until it was coated. Delicious!

What is so special about this recipe?? Just not to what I'm used to since I'm used to a slightly sweeter version that comes from elsewhere.

Wow, this recipe is so good.  The french toast is so fluffy and yummy.  I loved french toast as a child when my Mom used to make it on Sundays but it always turned out a little on the flat and soggy side (but still good though).  I used Texas toast for the bread.  You have to remember to stir in the cinnamon before you dip the bread into it.  I would not change anything about this recipe.  Thank you for the recipe.

Great French Toast!  I'd always done French toast the easy way- dip bread in egg+milk mixture.  This was more work, but really tasty!

Delicious!  I ran out of mixture at the end, and I used Pepperidge Farm white bread and ended up cooking 5 pieces.  I don't see how this is for 12 slices!  The recipe itself is great.  Best french toast I've made at home.

SOOOOOO GOOD! 
But, the only thing is the recipe in my opinion doesn't make enough egg mix for the bread. I had to make a significant amount more.

Very good!  I scaled it down for 4 pieces which worked out great.  I think it could use a little bit more cinnamon, but that could also be because I've been using the same bottle of  cinnamon out of my cabinet for a couple years now.  This will be my go-to recipe whenever I'm craving french toast going forward.

Very good! 2 batches is necessary to saturate a loaf of bread.

I followed this recipe to a T.  I used potato bread instead of french or challah.  Everyone loved it.  They all said it was the best french toast they had ever had.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This is a great addition to my breakfast standby list! So much better than egg & milk French toast. I used the butter flavored Crisco, as suggested, and it cooked up so nicely.

just got up off my lazy butt at 5:30, and started to read through a few breakfast recipes for something new to make for the family before they head out.  I make french toast pretty often but this one definitely beats mine, Its now 6:20 and theyve been cooked, enjoyed, cleaned and I'm laying down again.   Thanks! I will definitely try this one again

I made this for brunch today for my husband, son and my mom and I. I made enough for 16 servings and by the time I got all of them fed there was just enough batter to make 1 piece for myself! I think I'll make this one again!

Excellent though I tweaked it just a bit. I added extra cinnamon, a healthy dollop of Mild Molasses and used 3 packets of Stevia in place of the sugar. I'll drop that to 2 packets next go-'round and give 'er a go. With the addition of the Molasses that may be all that's needed. Both white and wheat bread taste good with this recipe but I was only able to get six slices coated but that's more than enough for the two of us.

My little boy LOVES French toast. Me? Not so much - but these are delicious! They came out perfect, crispy, and tasty. We like cinnamon, so we took the advice of another reviewer and didn't mix the cinnamon into mix - we dipped the bread, then sprinkled cinnamon onto each side before frying. Perfection!

This was good.  A little bland for my taste however.  I think it needs a little more salt and sugar and little less flour.  My families recipe is fairly close, just uses 6 eggs, 2 cups of milk, 2 tablespoons of sugar.I use triple the amount of vanilla as well.  Good tho!

Just OK. I think the flour detracted from the frech toast taste. I wouldn't think it would cover 12 pieces of bread either, I halved it and it made 5 pieces.

I've been looking for a simple french toast recipe and I have finally found it.  I didn't change a thing in the ingredients of the recipe and my little picky eaters gobbled theirs up.  I used old hoagie style bread and butter to cook with because that's what I had on hand.

I just tried this recipe and it turned out great! This is my first successful attempt at making French Toast. Remember to stir between adding each bread because the ingredients like to settle at the bottom of the bowl.

While this was super easy and tasty, can't say it was particularly more delicious than the standard recipe without the flour. However, come to think of it ,,, the sourdough bread I used came out soggy free.  Mmmm ,,, Okay well anyway, we like it with melted cheddar cheese between the slices and well, Yummy!

This was excellent.  I agree with other reviews that you must mix in between the dippings of bread to spread the cinnamon.  This for sure is going into one of my favorites!

Great recipe!  I like my French toast 'eggy' so for me, this was the right amount for making 8 slices of bread.  I love it with cinnamon raisin bread.

maybe I did something wrong but this came out the same as I make my french toast without the flour.  I didn't see any difference the flour made.

This was a good recipe but not exceptional.  I used day old cinnamon raisin bread and sprinkled the cinnamon and some nutmeg onto each slice as it was cooking on the first side.  If I hadn't used raisin bread I think it would have been rather blaw.  The flour does seem to puff up the bread a bit more than ususal.

Terrific! I cut the recipe in half, using two eggs, and just used regular whole wheat bread. It's worth the few extra minutes it takes. Next time I'm making the whole batch and freezing the leftovers. Thanks for sharing this recipe! **UPDATE** My husband likes this so much that every weekend I make a double batch and freezing the leftovers for his breakfast during the week (I'm at work). Bonus, he has stopped doing the eyeroll when he finds me trolling the internet recipe sites!

yummy fluffy french toast, but my search for great french toast doesn't end here as I had hoped it might, from some of the other reviews.  it was good, but not special.  I added some ground cardamom which tasted great with the cinnamon!

This was extremely good. Followed the recipe exactly. I think it can be a little more specific as to what to use to "lightly oil" the pan, as I tried a few different approaches to that, and they all came out a little differently. Melted butter or margarine seems to be the best. Wonderful recipe, however.

I always thought french toast was disgusting until I had the recipe. omg I now see why so many people like french toast. the flour truly makes this recipe stand out. the toast is nice fluffly. It is not soggy or taste like egg!!!! Bloody Brilliant!!!!

I didn't think there was a way to make french toast at home like they do in the restaurant.  This was it!  It was awesome.  I used a few days old loaf of Texas Toast and it turned out great.  I'm going to try it with Challah bread next.  Thanks for sharing!

We followed the recipe and pureed 2 ripe bananas to mix in, as a reviewer suggested. It was the exact amount needed to make 1 whole loaf of Challah bread French toast, which is our favorite kind. All of us said delicious, moist, and rich. Maybe the banana added moistness to this bread. Very easy to make and all the ingredients are on hand. Loved this!

i give this recipe 5 stars! i had never made french toast before, and this recipe was incredibly easy to follow for new cooks like me.   one thing i did also was added a dab of butter on the first cooked side while the other side was cooking, and let it melt right in. not sure if it made a difference but just thought i would share. =)  this recipe is definitely a keeper! =)

I always wanted to make french toast, so I decided to use this recipe as my first time. It was the most delicious french toast I've ever tried! My husband wouldn't stop raving about it. I did make some changes though. I customized it to make 4 servings instead of the original 12 (just for my husband and I). It asked for 1 tbl and 1 tsp of flour. I added 1tbl and 1/2 tbl instead, just to make it thicker. Also, I fried these using melted butter instead of oil. As I was frying them, I sprinkled cinnamon on both sides, to give it that extra hint of cinnamon. These came out prefect!

BEST french toast! I won't ever make my old stuff again! I think what makes it so good is the flour, sugar, vanilla & cinnamon! This one's a keeper!

I can't say this recipe was bad, but I just didn't find it to taste any different than the regular french toast I've always made with just eggs, milk and cinnamon.  So save yourself the extra calories and ingredients and just make it with those 3 things.

Made this morning for our breakfast and this will be my new go-to french toast recipe.  It is similar to what I used to do but has more milk and I like the addition of the flour.

This was a great recipe and I will certainly make it again. But do not try to cut it in half. I used texas toast but ran out of the mixture after only 4 pieces. But it is simple enough I was able to whip up some more very quickly.

I would only change one thing.  Seperate the egg whites and whip them to a meringue, and fold them in just before DIPPING the bread.  Also makes for very fluffy waffles!

I made this for my 3 kids today for brunch, it was quick and easy (like most french toast recipes)  and it was different (with the flour).  It didn't "wow" me though.  We did all enjoy it though, I actually didn't notice that there was flour in it.  In the end I think I'd just omit the flour it seems kind of unnecessary.

This is a great recipe! I love how the addition of flour makes the french toast so fluffy!!! I used regular white sandwich bread and only had enough liquid for 7 slices, so that was a disappointment. The only thing I changed was to add 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the batter. We all loved it, but next time I'll be sure to double it!

This was good. It was a bit soggy when cooked as directed in this recipe- I cut the milk in half and that seemed to help. I also doubled the cinnamon and the vanilla because I love both, that made it much more flavorful. Yummy!

The French toasts turned out to be EXCELLENT! This was the first time that I was able to make not saggy toasts. I just used old Wonder bread, they still turned out to be fluffy. My 3 year old is the biggest fan.

Really good!!! I did add about a Tablespoon of Brown sugar as well and it was SO good!! I would recommend doubling this recipe if you're cooking for a group because I didn't have enough mixture to make 12 pieces.

Husband and I LOVED this! I didn't have texas toast, only normal buttermilk toast, but it still came out fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I also added extra cinnamon and a smidgen more sugar (but not much)- delicious!

This recipe was wonderful.  I have been looking for a recipe that did not require soaking overnight.  I made the recipe per the directions and my husband loved it.  I used texas toast and was able to get about 8 slices.  I also used  criso shortening in the skillet as suggested by another reviewer.  It did not burn and all the slices came out perfect.  I will use this recipe again.

This recipe is great especially when all you have at home is thin, store-bought bread. I didn't like much with my homemade bread but with thinner brands it's a must.

DELICIOUS!! one tip though, i use brioche bread that i slice myself into 3/4"-1" slices and only have enough mixture for 7-8 slices of bread. This is a staple Saturday mornings.

Fantastic!!  I'm allergic to dairy so I used Mimic Creme cream substitute in place of milk and it came out Perfect!  Next time, I think I'll try "buttering" (with original Earth Balance) the slices before frying as one reviewer recommended.

Much more flavorful than plain french toast.  The vanilla and cinnamon are delightful, and the flour provides a smoother texture to multi-grain bread.

This is very tasty.  Only my last piece of bread turned out fluffy because I let it soak while the others were cooking, so that's the key, let it soak for a few seconds.  All the toast tasted nice, even the ones that were flat like regular French toast.  I will be using this recipe to introduce French toast to my English/French fiance, because he's never had it and I think this one is perfect, not too eggy.  Also, I added lots of cinnamon!

A wonderful variation of french toast that really keeps the toast in great condition for presentation. For an extra special kick I use 3/4 Skim Plus and 1/4 cup heavy cream in place of the 1 cup of milk.

My boyfriend and I love french toast. Unfortunately, I am a terrible cook outside of baking, and I consistently have a hard time making it. While I ran into trouble on this one (all my own fault), the frustration was worth it, because it was definitely delicious.

Delicious!!! Followed directions exactly except I added a dash of nutmeg. As other reviewers have noted you have to keep constantly stirring so the flour doesn't settle to the bottom of the mix.

Excellent! I used 21 grain bread and it was still moist and fluffy. I used brown sugar instead of white.  Will use this recipe from now on!

Nothing special about this French Toast, the flour in the batter gives it the fluffiness, lacks flavor.

I didn't realize that I had left my cinnamon and  vanilla extract at my mothers from Christmas time so I substituted with a few pinches of powdered sugar and it still came out great!  Its nothing extraordinary but its fast and yummy!

delicious.  I used thin sliced bread, and the batter wasn't enough.  I needed to make more.  I can't imagine how you soak the bread with what batter is made.

Make for quick and easy french toast for those who don't mind a few extra steps. And a little oil in the skillet mixed with margarine or butter helps.

This recipe was good; however you really need to use Texas Toast Bread or French Bread.  Also I had to throw in a little extra splash of vanilla and brown sugar to the last half as my first crowd who were gobbling up the first half said they were a little bland.  Overall they weren't to bad and very easy to whip up!

Made this exactly as written and it was very good.  Next time I will probably try making the batter in a blender as I did have a small amount of flour that didn't completely incorporate despite careful whisking at the beginning.  The only bread I had on hand was regular sandwich bread which still tasted great.  I'm sure this is phenomenal with thick french bread.  Great recipe!

This recipe turned out excellent! I like it because it's not so "eggy" tasting. I was out of regular milk and had to substitue buttermilk and it still turned out great! This recipe is a keeper. Thanks!

This is the only recipe I will use. I find the thicker the bread the better this recipe comes out. It tastes great with just regular sandwich bread but with a thick sliced italian or french bread it just simply amazing.

They were delicious! If you don't eat them with syrup, then they would need some more sugar, but overall was a HUGE success.

best french toast recipe! I've been using it for years and I always use 1/2 tsp of almond extract and 1/2 tsp of vanilla, as well as a dash of nutmeg. Perfect every time.

This was good. I added a little nutmeg as well. Not sure if they were truly "fluffier" than what i usually make. Everyone liked them though.

Very tasty, very nice french toast -- better than my mother made when I was growing up (but don't tell her that!).  I'm not sure why it's called "fluffy" french toast, as mine didn't really seam to rise or anything.  But that might have just been the bread I was using.  I make this recipe in 1/3 batches and can usually get 3-4 pieces of toast.

Pretty good recipe for French Toast.  I didn't have flour on hand and used pancake mix instead and it came out delish, probably even better seeing that it was malted pancake mix :)

I scaled this reciped down for 4 and followed the instructions as written.  I did whisk in between each slice of toast (I cooked one at a time) and added cinnamon sugar before grilling in butter.  DELICIOUS!!!  It wasn't eggy AT ALL and that's what I loved about it.

Tastes just like homemade french toast, nothing special.  It seems like restaurant french toast is always better than homemade so I was looking for something like that.  This isn't it.

Yum! I just made a few slices for my picky 2 1/2 yr old who is sick with a cold and won't eat much right now, so I figured it might be something he'll actually eat and a way for me to get some protein in him.  He LOVES it and so do I.  I just wish I made more now.  :(  I better go back to the stove and make more.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious, I've used eggs and milk or eggs only and they were just ok.  I tried this recipe and everyone loved it, even my picky eaters a 6 year old and 2 year old.  I froze the rest in wax paper like someone said and hubby said they were delicious (he didn't had any on the first round) Perfect!

Really good basic and easy french toast recipe.  I actually made it dairy-free by using 3/4 c. very vanilla Silk milk and 1/4 c. regular soy milk (I ran out of vanilla) and used vegan butter in the pan.  Came out delicious!

I've made this twice now, and everyone raves about it. I use texas toast style bread, and a pinch of pumpkin pie spice along with my cinnamon, and it works just great. Thanks for the recipe, I think the flour really makes a difference.

I enjoyed this recipe b/c it wasn't over eggy. I think that's what I don't care about french toast. But I think with the flour, it takes some of that away! Hubby said it was ok. If I make f.t. again (we don't eat it that often) I will use this recipe.

Great, I actually made an error and put icing sugar instead of flour, still good.  I don't think you can mess up this recipe, really good.

I used regular old white bread and added a splash of orange juice.  I cooked it in a George Foreman grill and it came out awesome.  It didn't taste like flour to me at all, but I whisked it well and didn't have any lumps.  The mixture was kinda like pancake batter.  Was fluffy and not soggy at all like regular french toast!

so tasty! i used pumpkin pie spice this morning instead of cinnamon and it was very nice.  i would use half again as much spice next time for more flavor.  i would also use a touch more vanilla. for topping i just used a little bit of butter and powdered sugar so the flavor of the toast itself with the spices would come through.  a great recipe

Very good recipe.  Love the consistancy that the french toast has.  Not too eggy.  This is the best french toast that I've ever made.  I think the flour in the egg mixture makes a real difference.

I made this recipe as-is and I didn't find that the flour made the french toast fluffier, either. And I don't see how flour would do that without some additional leavening. However, I used multigrain bread and I would probably had a different result with something less dense. The flavor was good but not exceptional and I didn't a dozen pieces out of it, either.  Some suggestions: combine all ingredients in the blender to eliminate the lumps, and replace the sugar with orange marmalade and the milk with buttermilk for more depth of flavor.

I used Challah, and substituted 1/2 cup flavored liquid coffee creamer for 1/2 cup milk, added a dash of almond extract, and used pumkin pie spice instead of the cinn.  My husband enjoyed it. I didn't see a difference in the addition of the flour, but that could have been due to the add'l creaminess of the flavored creamer and also the dense challah I used.  I also used other reviewers tips for cooking with the butter flavored crisco and that worked well for not getting overly brown by the last batch. Kept the early batches warm in the oven while the other batches cooked.

I've never been a fan of french toast. I've never made it either! I decided to give it another chance and make it this morning with this recipe, and indeedy it was yummy! I topped it off with sliced strawberries and cool whip. My boyfriend and our roommates definitely enjoyed it seeing as they're all gone ;x! Thanks!

Loved this!!!  On accident I added an extra egg, used half a cup of milk and added 1/4 cup of flour.  I used a large bowl to dip the bread in.  Coated the bottom and kept it tilted while I dipped the bread in. They came out perfect.  I would have made a picture but didn't have any leftovers.  Will try this one again real soon.

I know that other people have said that this recipe didn't come out soggy I don't know if I did something wrong or what but mine came out really soggy.  Also, it tasted very strongly of the flour.  I could barely taste the sweeter taste that I expect from french toast.

Very good!  The flour does keep it from being too soggy and it comes up fluffy and fabulous.  I added a splash of spiced rum and a bit of nutmeg to the batter but it would have been good without it too.  I'll be using this one recipe from now on for sure.

This is delicious!  I used fresh french bread sliced diagonally about 1-1/4 " thick I used my thumb as a gauge from end of nail to knuckle).  Let the bread soak up all of the batter before frying.  I pan fried it in butter and served with real maple syrup.  Like another reviewer, I added, oh, maybe a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract with the vanilla (for 3 servings). I also added a bit more sugar.  This is a wonderful recipe that I enjoyed making and eating. Oh yes, and my husband said he could smell it outside of the house and it smelled yummy!

I always get compliments when I make this french toast.  I always get an unsliced loaf of bread from the bakery, Italian, etc. and than slice thick pieces.  It comes out great every time.

This French Toast came out really good. My mistake was using whole wheat bread (that is all I had on hand). Besides that I followed the recipe exactly how it said. I think i would like it even more if i used white bread. Good Recipe :)

This recipe was perfect! The french toast came out fluffy but was not too dry. Definitely a new favorite:) I added 1 tsp ground cloves and sprinkled cinnamon on one side of each slice. I had a few left over pieces, which I froze separately in sandwich baggies. I cooked them in the toaster a few days later and they were crisp and delicious. Yumm-O!

Delicious, and i used almost week-old French bread, which was almost impossible to cut into slices! It was still fluffy and soft. I won't even be trying other French Toast recipes.

Better than most French Toast recipes. I used English Muffin Bread, and it most definitely turned out fluffy.

If you dont want a strong cinnamon flavor, cut it by 1/2. It really is a lot of cinnamon. I also liked the flavor when I used 1/2 Tbsp brown sugar & 1/2 Tbsp white sugar and added a pich of nutmeg. I think next time I will also make it with 4 eggs instead of 3. I do like the added flour. It gives it a nice texture.

This is really easy to make even if you don't do it perfectly or if you made a little change. The flour really ads something nice. You notice a little more fluff as you eat but you don't really think of flour unless you know it's in there. I find I need more of the mixture then the recipe indicates so I made a little extra. I also find that the bigger the pieces of bread the better. Really yummy overall and easy to whip up. My favorite french toast from this site so far and I have tried about 5 of the most popular.

I used this recipe yesterday and it was the first time I ever made homemade french toast. It went over very well, even with the picky 3 and 6 year olds. It was extremely easy to make and the only change I made was that I added a splash of orange juice to the mix. I used Texas Toast and there was not enough of the mixture, so when using very thick bread, I would suggest preparing the mix for a larger number of servings.

This was the best Frnech toast I've ever made!  I cut the recipe down to 4 slices of bread, did cinnamon to taste and eyeballed the rest of the measurements.  Sprinkled powered sugar, blueberries and syrup on the top.  Thanks for the great recipe!

1 batch only made enough for 9 regular slices of bread.  I was short quite a bit of batter.  Tasted good but I will stick to my other recipe.

Wow!  My family loved this, my 3 year old thought I made her cake it was so yummy.  I did have to add more milk, one more egg and a extra dash of vanilla and cinnamon to get to all the bread. Used up the white bread (my mom got it for us--we use wheat) and then topped it with fresh berries and powdered sugar.  It didn't even need syrup!

It's a very good recipe. I added more cinnamon, halved the sugar and still found it to be tasty. Especially topped with some honey! I found some of my slices to be a bit soggy but that could have been my fault for letting it soak up too much of the mixture.

Great recipe. Although I couldn't really tell much of a difference with the inclusion of the flour, if anything it reduced the sogginess a bit. I would recommend letting thicker breads soak in the mixture for a little bit longer though, I noticed the flavor didn't soak through the bread unless I let it soak for about 10-15 mins in the fridge. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was nice to have, though I didn't taste too much of a difference in this recipe from my regular french toast recipe.  I used Cinnabon Cinnamon Toast and left out the cinnamon in the egg mixture, and the flavor was just what I expected: warm, sweet, and comforting.

I decided to make this for dinner one night since I was on a tight schedule. It was delicious!  I used texas toast, got out the griddle, and it was done in no time!  I did add extra cinnamon and added a bit of nutmeg, but left everything else the same.  Thanks for a great (and fast) recipe!

Great french toast - I made it with country wheat and it turned out great!  Be sure to get a good soak on the bread, not just an outside coating (be gentle after soaking!).  Try a taste before adding additional butter and syrup on top once serving - the french toast is very tasty (and sweet enough in my opinion) without additional syrup.  I'm also not a fan of loading up on butter if not really needed for taste..

This recipe is so simple yet so tasty.  I made it with my daughter this morning and she basically did the prep and I did the cooking.  I followed others suggestion by adding more cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg, and dressing it up with powdered sugar, fresh berries and home made whipped cream.  Pair it with a cup of coffee or hot chocolate and its the perfect breakfast especially if you have 9-inches of snow outside.

Mine came out soggy, but my husband likes it that way! My batter did not make 12 slices. I may have saturated the bread too much, but still only made about 7. Good with powdered sugar on top and strawberries!

This was good. Not soggy at all. I did double the Vanilla and Cinnamon though. I used sliced Italian bread and soaked the bread more than I normally would but it came out great on my electric griddle at around 300-325

My husband made this recipe for me on Valentines Day. I loved it! He said the only change he made was he added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and used only 1/8 cup of flour. It was so delicious and I think I'll never be able to have plain old regular french toast again!

Ithought maybe by adding the flour it would give it something extra, but I thought it took away from the cinamon and vanilla. Kids liked it and didn't notice a difference.

Made this for breakfast this morning. Very easy recipe with basic ingredients on hand. I used old bread that wasn't soft enough for sandwiches & it worked great. Only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that I'd add a bit more cinnamon. This by far, is one of the better french toast recipes I've tried from this site.

This was really good and not soggy at all which is why I don't normally eat French toast.  We used sourdough bread which adds lots of flavor and so it wasn't bland.  We will certainly be making our French toast this way from now on.

This recipe turned out great. I followed another user's advice to wisk the mixture together before soaking each piece of bread. This keeps the cinnamon evenly distributed throughout the mixture.

Absolutely Delicious! I followed the recipe as is, and it came out fully, and very tasty. The cinnamon flavor rose to the top of the bread, and once I added the powdered sugar, and topped it with maple syrup, it was just like the french toast at a restaurant! I will definitely make it again. Very easy, and not time consuming at all.

This is the best French Toast recipe..wasn't soggy {my old recipe was always a little on the soggy side..Not this one! The flour must be the secret ingredient]. The only changes I made was the serving size,I used the 'calculate' to 6 servings instead of 12 servings. I probably could ate all the 12 servings..LOL! Then I served it w/syrup and sprinkled powder sugar on top..Yum Yum!!  Glad I gave this recipe a try.I Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!! this is a Keeper!

This french toast was wonderful and EASY.  Made this for a special b'fast in bed for Valentine's day and we absolutely loved it!  Took others suggestion and sprinkled the cinnamon instead of adding to batter because it floats even when whisked together.  Once the toast was done, we used syrup and powdered sugar to top the toast and it was FABULOUS!  Great, easy recipe. Will use again and again.

I am in love with this recipe.  I have made it three days in a row and have not gotten tired of it yet.  I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I changed was adding more cinnamon.  I will never use another French Toast recipe again.  It was light and fluffy and reminded me of the ones you get at the restaurants.

Unfortunately I tried this recipe using regular sandwich bread, but I still felt that the recipe was great for making french toast!  What I enjoyed the most was how well you can taste the cinnamon, which reminded me of the french toast I eat at my favorite breakfast restaurant.

Next time, I will try it with thick slices of bread!

I'm one that loves giving out good reviews, but I just really couldn't honestly give this one a 4 or 5. It could have been something I did, because I'm not a very experienced cook, but this French Toast just turned out mushy with no flavor. :( I didn't change anything in the recipie either, so I don't know.

Best French Toast Recipe I have ever tried. I used Challah Bread sliced 1-2" thick. I added 1tb more of sugar and ts cinnamon. Perfect yield for 12, not soggy at all!

Absolutely fabulous! The best french toast I've ever had. Plus, the family loved it! I followed the recipe as written. Keep stirring egg mixture as cinammon will settle at the bottom of the bowl.

I made these this morning for breakfast and it was a hugh hit, even my 9 month old gobbled up almost a whole piece himself. Didn't change a thing. All the flavors balanced out great and it had just the right amount of cinnamon. I mixed the dry ingredients together and I didn't have any problems with the cinnamon seperating. A keeper for a quick and tasty breakfast. Next time I am going to try and make some "french toast" sticks for my 2 1/2 year who loves the frozen ones. A much cheaper and healthy alternative.

Was good. Add less milk (took away from flavor) maybe 2/3 cup. Restraunt style though. Will make again.

How crazy that a little flour would make a big difference, but my family loved this recipe. It made them so fluffy.
 Thank you so much

Yum! This turned out great. Not soggy at all. My husband said it tasted like IHOP. I added a shot of hazelnut coffee creamer instead of vanilla and sugar to the milk and drizzled cream cheese icing. Divine! Next time I think I'll try it with cinnamon raisin bread.

These are really good. I added some butter to the skillet, but there wasn't enough batter for all 12 slices. I sprinkled the cinnamon on them before frying them. They are good and have a nice crunch but are missing something, maybe some orange juice or orange zest.

This will be the recipe I use every time I make French Toast!  It had a smooth taste and didn't taste "egg-y" at all.  Just the right amount of cinnamon, vanilla and sugar too.  I did what another reviewer wrote and also sprinkled some cinnamon on while it was cooking.  VERY Yummy!!!

FABULOUS - This recipe makes the best French Toast that my husband and I have ever had. I did not have any flour, so I grounded some wheat into flour and it was great.  I am anxious to try it with regular flour.

I absolutely love this french toast recipe. The end result is not too eggy, not too moist and definitely not too dry. It has a delicate sweetness and the vanilla and cinammon is a perfect combination. I served it to my husband who was a chef for 9 years, and he LOVED it. He wanted to know where I got the recipe but I told him it was a secret. It's not to often I get to do that. ;)

I just made this for the second time, and again it was a big hit for my 3 teenagers! My daughter called it "special" French Toast...Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This recipe was very good!  I never follow a recipe.  My changes for this recipe were very slight though.  I used Texas Toast (made 8 slices perfectly, no leftovers) and we love cinnamon so I sprinkled extra cinnamon on the tops of the toast before flipping them.  I made a fruit topping in a saucepan over low to med. heat by combining approx. one tsp. butter, one T. brown sugar, one tsp. water, some sliced apricots, peaches, and a banana that i added just before turning off the stove. The flavor resembled cobbler.  The toast was also good on it's own.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

Great recepie, although the french toast isn't as fluffy as I was expecting. I use pancake mix to add a little more "fluff". Be sure to stir the mix after each piece of toast because the flour tends to float to the bottom of the mix.

made as directed..topped with strawberry topping and whipped cream; better than any restaurant! Awesome that when I make this at home I can go organic and control the fat content, unlike at restaurants where you are at the mercy of the chef :)

I found that this lacked the flavor that I remember french toast having when I was a kid.  I did add vanilla and wish it had been a little sweeter, since we don't like maple syrup around out house.

I've been making french toast for years with "this" recipe. The only thing that was different was adding the flour. I really didn't notice a big difference. I used butter to fry it but I never use a high flame so it doesn't burn. I made this with Warren Wickland's Sourdough III recipe. I'll probably try the flour addition again but will try using a little cardamon and brown sugar.

I followed the recipe exactly.  My five year old picky eater had almost three pieces and my one year old loved it as well.  I would agree with the suggestion of other reviewers in that it needs more cinnamon.  Otherwise, a wonderful recipe!

Delicious toast! I didn't give it 5 stars because I took some of the other people's advice and added a Tbl. of nutmeg and I sprinkled the toast with cinnamon sugar as I cooked it. But it came out beautifully and very fluffy. I may eat french toast every morning!

I used pretty stale whole wheat bread, whole wheat four, brown sugar, 1tsp. cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice instead. I also pushed semi-sweet chocolate chips into the bread slices when they were in the skillet...it made it soooo much better! I didn't have powdered sugar, so I topped each piece of toast with a mix of natural maple syrup and almond butter and even some sliced strawberries! It was like dessert, but didn't even feel heavy!

It wasn't your cooking skills, Kristen.  This was just "Okay". Nothing special or stand out.  I had high expectations, as I'm used to WOWZA French toast (See: Crispy French Toast recipe on here).  Added in my typical nutmeg & almond extract.

I love french toast and I have to say, this was the best I've been able to make!   The flour made the difference.   I used cheap white bread as that's all I had available and it still came out great.  I'm sure it would have been even better with better bread!  I'll definitely use this recipe each time I make french toast in the future.

This french toast was "Mm...Mm...Mm...DEEEE-LICIOUS!"  In the words of my very picky eater 3 1/2 year old daughter!  She was convinced we weren't having dinner, we were having dessert!  SO easy and SO good.  I used a leftover homemade bread from the day before and it was great!  I think this will be the recipe I use from now on.  Served with bacon, sausage and fresh fruit...perfect easy meal for any time of the day!

Wonderful! This was my first time making French toast and it came out perfect. I made 4 instead of 12 like the recipe, and the conversion worked out perfectly. I topped it with powdered sugar and that was all it needed!

This is the best French toast I've ever made. Moist without being soggy and great flavor! I made it with leftover challah bread, used brown sugar instead of white, and was heavy-handed with the vanilla and cinnamon. Yum!

These were great! Just a bit better than the normal french toast. I followed the exact recipe and used cheap white bread because that's all I had, and they were delicious.

Very nice. I halved the recipe and to reduce fat I used 1/4 cup egg substitute to replace one of the eggs. I was really impressed that the proportion was exactly what I needed for 6 pieces of bread (I used pepperidge farm cinnamon toast bread).

Recipe was ok, not stellar, but worked in a pinch. Maybe something went wrong as I halfed the recipe to 6 servings instead of 12. Anywho, I will try again and see what happens.

Very good recipe, but i dont think it is the best french toast. I used the bread machine challa I recipe for the bread, and that came out perfect for french toast. It did taste more like a cinnamon bun rather than french toast. It had no egg taste at all and i added an extra egg to the recipe. Next time i will try a different recipe until i find the perfect one.

I will never need another French toast recipe again - this is it!  Add a bit of nutmeg and extra cinnamon for a stronger flavor and make sure you whisk it well before dunking each slice because the mix settles quickly.  My husband said this was better than the French toast sticks we had at college that we both absolutely loved.

My DH made this french toast for breakfast this morning and it was very good.  He followed the recipe exactly, but we scaled it to 8 servings (which made 5 slices of french toast using regular whole grain bread).  The only slight modification he made was to add a bit of nutmeg, and it was delicious with this addition.  In the end, we both agree that the only way to serve this french toast is with fresh strawberries, whipped cream and real maple syrup...Yummy!!!

four and a half!  Maybe because I made a double batch, but the flour sank to the bottom of the dish, so the first batch was like there was no flour, and the second batch was a bit gooey on the sides of the toast.  I will continue to make mine without the flour.

I followed this recipe exactly and my family gobbled it up!  Great recipe.  I think the flour just allows a little of the 'batter' to stick to it.  I might add a bit more cinnamon next time.  My 7 yr old claimed it's the best french toast he's ever had!

This was very good.  This is my first attempt at french toast (I'm not a morning person) and I will be making it again.  I only had wheat sandwich bread so I think it will be much better with a thicker bread.  My wife liked it too.

These were amazing! I found out midway through the process that I was out of cinnamon, so instead I used 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract and it was FANTASTIC! Very tastey!

I tried this recipe this morning and I loved it!  My husband is a french toast fanatic and after nine months of cooking it while pregnant with my first son, I couldn't eat it anymore, that was five years ago.  French toast has made a comeback.  For those who rated this recipe bland, get a little creative!  I added xtra sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, cinniman, and some nutmeg.  Thanks for a family favorite!

Fabulous! I used a light english muffin, cutting each half in half, for one serving. I also used egg beaters and splenda. It was definitely light, fluffy, and delicious!

This was quick and easy to make, and it used typical household ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly after after a few minutes on the griddle, it firmed up and looked great. 

It did seem as though the recipe was missing something -- a touch of sweetness  or moistness. I also think the 7-grain bread I had on hand was not the greatest match for this recipe.

One serving note: If you let the bread "saturate" as the recipe instructs, it won't make quite as many servings says.

This made great french toast. All though it could have been so good because we made homemade bread to use for the french toast. Anyway, the flavor was great. This one will be how I make french toast from now on until I taste something better.

Tasted great. Barely made 10 slices. The last two were not very well soaked.

"Yummy in my tummy!" according to my three year old.  This light and fluffy french toast was delightful.  The recipe worked very well.  I'm not sure what difference the flour made, but I liked it nevertheless.  I will continue to add flour in the furture.

I made these for breakfast one day for my friends and they all said that it was really good and they've never had french toast like that. I like my french toast with honey and I think the winter honey that I used overpowered the taste of the toast (tasted like those that I make with just egg, milk, and some sugar) but they were still fluffy! However, with syrup, I could defintiely taste the difference.

we thought this french toast tasted pretty good. the only changes i made were in using whole wheat flour & 2% milk. this recipe (sans flour) is close to the way i make basic french toast. thanks bonnie!

I saw this version of French Toast made on television, and went to try it.  I doubled the recipie, added more sugar and cinnamon and put the mixed contents into a casserole dish since I used a whole spiraled loaf of cinnamon rasinbread.  It came out delicious. I dusted some powdered sugar over it and some syrup and my family loved it!!!
I don't usually eat french toast because of the egg taste.  But this was light and fluffy and I sliced my pieces like FT sticks!

This made good french toast but we did not find it different from the way that it tastes when we usually make it. We did use texas toast and found that the inside was very soft so the next time we try this I think we will stick with the regular sized slices.

This french toast is not too bad.  BUT, it really needs more sugar, cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg.  Think I will stick with my old french toast recipe.

My husband and I enjoyed this new version of regular french toast.  I doubled the cinnamon, vanilla and sugar (using 1 tsp. of brown sugar and 1 tsp. of white sugar).  I reduced the serving size to 4, but found that I didn't have quite enough of the mixture for the fourth piece.  I'll likely make this again in the future but will remember to add some extra milk and/or an extra egg.

VERY good. Followed recipe by using white sugar since that is what I had. Brown sugar would probably be amazing, too. Better than the norm.

I love it. Make it for me and my sis once in a  while. Of course we don't measure anything and theres been many alterations. Really nice since we have a stick free pan. Easy clean up. Best so far was using orange extract and brown sugar (in fact we've only done white sugar once). We tend to add more flavor and spice instead of sugar. Who needs sugar anyways? But overall far far better than  any french toast I've ever had.

Nice texture, wasn't as soggy as the old stand by.  I think I'll replace my old recipe with this one.  I made it with a Sauteed Apples recipe I found on this site.  Was a hit!

As others suggested I increased the amount of cinnamon. Also I used a cinnamon plus blend. I used thick slice bread and sandwich sliced, both worked well. It is fluffy and not as soggy as my old faithful recipe. Thanks for sharing we will make this again.

This is a little different.  Not too sweet.  My husband and my 3 yrs old love it.  All 11 pieces was gone by the end of the day.  I'm not a big fan of it.  If they like it I'll make it again so therefore I'll give it a 4 stars.

I was pleased with the results of this recipe.  The results were on the order of French Toast that I've had at up-scale restaurants, not at all like French Toast at Grandma's house...which is to say that there was not a lot of egg mixture hanging off the toast, and it didn't have what I would consider a traditional taste and texture.  I added 1/4tsp Nutmeg and used fresh baked white bread sliced approx 1 inch thick.  There was only enough egg mixture to prepare 8 slices.

I found this recipe to be pretty good. I added another 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and a little bit of sweet nutmeg and it turned out good.

It is VERY good but the crust was too hard! Darn it. Maybe I can cut off the crust and cook it the rest? My boyfriend and my son gobble them up and have few extra left overs! Great recipe and will make it again!

This was fluffy but had hardly any flavour. Couldn't really eat on it's own, had to add additional toppings.

I used french bread and I guess I let it soak too long.  The middle was very soggy.  Next time I'll either use thinner bread or not let it soak so long.  The taste was great, however.  I'll definitely try again.

I used to make this recipe all the time!  We always thought it was a better recipe than regular french toast!  I lost all my recipes in a house fire several years ago and got on here today to try to find one similar to the recipe I used to make and here it was!  Not only that but it was submitted by Bonnie and that is my name!  Weird, but I'm so glad it was here!

Very good.  I made this less fattening by using Splenda, fat free milk, lite whole wheat bread and fried using cooking spray.  DH loved and said it was similar to Denny's.

It was still good, but I didn't really notice any difference between this recipe that uses flour and mine that doesn't.  I will stick with mine and save those calories on something better!

It was okay, but not great. It was a little bland for my taste, so maybe if I added a little more sugar it would taste better.

I wouldn't say these are exactly the greatest, but they had a nice taste to them.  There wasn't much difference between these and regular french toast, except they take longer to cook and were a tiny bit thicker.  Flavor and texture were fairly the same.  I did add a teaspoon of baking powder and mixed in all in the blender as someone suggested.  I don't think it was worth the extra effort.

Made the recipe this morning using texas toast.  Sprinkled a little powdered sugar on top, added some butter and syrup and it was great.  My son's friend had 5 pieces.

The flour didn't seem to make it fluffier.  Still, this is a good basic recipe for French toast.  It's not very sweet on its own, so be sure to add maple syrup.

I didn't find this any different then the way i usually make french toast. The only thing different is the flour. It may be because i only had regular sandwich bread. So if i do try this again i would definitley like to try a thicker bread. Maybe a french bread or something. My husband said it tasted the same as regular as well.
