I made it just the way He said to make it. I loved the video so I could check to see that my consistency matched his. It came out great. I poured it into a pan full of butter and bacon grease while the rest was still cooking. what great flavor. I did make 8 times the amount he did, had a large skillet full of spaetzle..love it!

My family really liked it, we had it with cooked red cabbage (a German dish) and sausage. I doubled the recipe, it was super easy!  Will make it next time with rouladen and gravy.  I also did what was suggested and fried it in butter AWESOME.

This made a fabulous side dish, I would double the recipe however.  My family thought it was delicious.

I made this to add to my favorite green bean dish.  This is wonderful. It is definitely going into the recipe file.

I made this for my husband who is half German and lived in Germany for a time as a child. He loved it. I doubled the recipe and had plenty for breakfast the next day. I fried it and served it with eggs. A winner!

Chef John is right! This is probably the easiest pasta dish you could make, and so delicious! My wife asks for it on a regular basis. In fact, we're making it tonight, with beef bourguignon on top. I double the recipe for two (even if we don't put all of the spaetzle on our plates, there are never any leftovers by the end of the night). Thank you, Chef!

Cooking out of necessity here. Not quite as good as what I had served to me in Frankfurt but nonetheless pretty  good. 
I'll make this again shortly.

So I made this, I tripled the recipe and I did watch the video, taking your advice I did have to add more ingredient (milk) as it was too, too thick. But when it was done it was definitely delicious and oh my I was surprised how easy it was to make. My German Dad and from Germany, my Granpa and Great Granpa would all be proud of me. I think they may all be rolling over in there graves doing high 5â€™sand clapping. Thanks for Sharing, Brenda Now do you have a easy Greffla recipe

What a fun, easy side dish! I doubled the recipe, using sour cream for the creme fraiche and half and half for the milk. The cayenne gave a nice warmth and depth. The video was really helpful for getting the consistency right. I am half Polish and half Italian and this fit in nicely with my favorite traditional flavors. Yummy.

Once I found and purchased a larger holed single sided grater it was a breeze to make this German take on pasta. These tender little gems are perfect! A 'must have' for any German meal!
