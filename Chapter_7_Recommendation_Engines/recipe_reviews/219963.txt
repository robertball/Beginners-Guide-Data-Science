I have made this recipe several times now after watching Chef John's video and it is DELICIOUS!  I served this recipe to company this past weekend and everyone raved about the flavor the shitake mushrooms gave the gravy.  No changes are necessary as the recipe is perfect just as written.  ENJOY!

I would have given this recipe about 3 stars for flavor, & that's considering this is really a recipe for MEATLOAF GRAVY rather than for meatloaf, so my rating is based on the METHOD/GRAVY ALONE. I made this recipe exactly as written & IMHO the gravy was good, but NOT great. It reminds me of a gravy I might have tasted in a TV dinner or at Denny's (edible, I wouldn't have sent it back, but I wouldn't have bothered to clean my plate or save any leftovers nor would I never order this again). The fact that it uses shitake mushrooms seems like it would add to the flavor, but it only seems to add to the cost of the dish. Sorry, Chef John, but I've tried a few gravy recipes that called for cans of cream of mushroom soup that cost MUCH less than this one & were easier to prepare & tasted just as good or better. I started off rating this recipe 3 stars for flavor, but knocked off stars because (1) it takes extra time/expense to make than a canned-mushroom-soup-gravy & IMHO this recipe isn't any better (2) cooking the meatloaf IN the gravy makes for a VERYVERYGREASY gravy & just skimming the grease wasn't enough for, I had to get out the gravy strainer & this is an extra step that I didn't care for - why not just make the gravy separately? 3) Personal preference - we like to have a crisp outer layer on our meatloaf & using this recipe/method the whole loaf comes out very moist...like tv-dinner-meatloaf-all-around-moist-throughout..which isn't what we like/expect/want in a meatloaf.

I dont know how anyone could fault this gravy. The shitakes made our gravy pure magic and the addition of a little heavy cream was perfect to lighten and soften the gravy too. 

I made this gravy with the meatloaf recipe found on this site called "Brown Sugar Meatloaf" without the brown sugar and ketchup, also substituted the crackers for Italian Seasoned Breadcrumbs and a heartier dose of garlic.

Remember the beef stock is a big part of this recipe, either make your own (big pain) or use the thick lard-like stocks like "better than bullion". I find a huge upgrade in those stocks and they are available in chicken, beef and turkey.

My wife is a life long meatloaf lover and I am a lifelong meatloaf hater. I made this meal for her and we were both saying "Mmmmmm" the whole time and she said it was the best meatloaf of her life! 

Thanks Chef John

Great recipe...made it with a pork and beef meatloaf which was delicious.  Shiitake mushrooms are a must.  I used a little too much flour (about 3 Tbsp.) and had to add extra beef broth while it was baking, but other than that, it was perfect.

Though I don't eat meat myself - the smell while this was cooking was enough to make my mouth water.  My kids aren't super picky - but i KNEW this was a hit when my son thanked us for having him so that he could eat food as good as this...and my daughter hummed the happy song while eating.  I'd say this one is a winner!!

This stuff is just silly good, I could drink it as is!  Made exactly as written with lots of black pepper added.  Instead of meatloaf I just added a 2 lb bag of prepared frozen turkey meatballs and baked at 250* for a couple of hours until we were ready to eat.  A great easy "semi-homemade" weeknight meal over buttered/parsley kluski noodles.  Thanks for sharing, John, a winner and def do-over for sure.

This recipe is amazing. I did NOT do the Beef Veal and Pork meatloaf he suggested. I instead used his classic meatloaf recipe. Hover instead of 2.5 pounds of chuck, I did a mix of chuck and pork. Came out amazing!!! All the family wanted the recipe. I also did not spoon on the gravy until half way through the cooking process. Made a bit more of a crust on the outside. I would actually have let it stay in longer next time before spooning over the gravy.

This is a very elegant meatloaf, one you could serve to guests.  The rosemary really sets this apart from other more traditional meatloaf recipes.  I added in some baby bella mushrooms along with the shiitake and fresh chopped garlic.

Good basic idea. I used ground venison instead (10% fat), used 1 T. butter and 1 T. olive oil, and non-fat yogurt instead of the heavy cream.  It didn't yield quite the amount of sauce I would have liked, but the flavor was good.  The rosemary and mushrooms complemented each other perfectly...
My only complaint was there was no specific amount of flour called for so I had to just guess at how much to use...but the sauce turned out a good consistency.  Great new way to make meatloaf.

I used Chef John's Classic Meat Loaf recipe with this sauce. I actually did not have shitake mushrooms, I used baby bella mushrooms. The "gravy" is seriously to die for. We ate just about all of it--there is just enough for my husband's lunch tomorrow. Truly incredible.

WOW! I LOVE this recipe! I have made it a few times already. Last time I made it without mushrooms, mainly because I forgot them at the grocery store and didn't want to go back. It still came out perfect! I also used ground turkey and chicken broth. As we don't eat red meat or pork. The only other thing I changed was I used half and half, just because that was all we had in stock. It still came out wonderful! Paired it with garlic mashed potatoes and sweet peas! LOOOVE Chef John's recipes!

This was really good.  I don't eat veal or pork so I just did it with Chef Johns meatloaf recipe which was amazing in itself, very moist.  The only thing I would say is that I don't know how badly it needed step 11.  The sauce seemed thick enough immediately out of the oven to me, I did step 11 and it just seemed to thicken the sauce a bit too much for my taste and also reduced the amount of sauce to the point where there didn't seem to be enough for everyone.

Excellent base recipe. I've made this multiple times, as written and with modifications due to supplies at home. This is also a great sauce to bake chicken pieces. I've also added cooked ground meat (turkey, chicken, beef, etc) and served over rice or mashed potatoes. I usually sub garlic for the rosemary, based on personal preference.

This is the most delicious meatloaf I've ever had!  The gravy is to die for!  I added to the meat mixture 2 eggs, a sleeve of crushed town house crackers, 1 very thinly sliced shallot, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Shaped it into a loaf and followed Chef John's recipe!  Definitely a keeper!

The gravy was great, but I feel that I suffered from the same problem as Chef John in that my meatloaf recipe wasn't spectacular.  I didn't feel though that the gravy made the meat that much more moist for the extra fat you end up with cooking it with the meat.  We did enjoy it though.

Misa,  you are afraid to explore. Add a little bit of butter to the sauce. Sprinkle some white pepper in it and add some chopped fresh garlic. Maybe add some onion powder or chopped onion or better yet use a little shallot. Use beef base so you can regulate the amount of salt and when you saute the mushrooms use a little quality sherry in the sauce pan. It will all make a difference.

I made this for my meatloaf last night. while the overall dish turned out amazing, i did have to tweak it to add flavour and to thicken before adding it to my meatloaf. After making it i realized this is very close to a marsala sauce i make for chicken or veal marsala. next time i will simmer and reduce a few ounces of dry and sweet marsala with rosemary before adding beef stalk. I think i would have to forego the roux and thicken with corn starch. The reduced marsala rounds out the rosemarty flavour beautifully.

Simply the best meatloaf recipe ever!  I added two tablespoons of dry sherry to the sauce while bringing it to the boil.  It went from "great" to "fabulous".

Delicious! Made this shiitake gravy with Chef John's classic meatloaf (replaced the sauce in the classic recipe with this gravy). Meatloaf is my nemesis and I am so happy to say, I won this round! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was probably the best meatloaf I've ever made! It was delicious, and the shiitake mushroom were the perfect type for the dish. The Rosemary gave it an interesting flavor and really combined well with the other ingredients. I added onion to my gravy, and that was about the only change I made. Thank you for the excellent recipe, husband and I will definitely have this again for dinner!

I made this recipe twice now; it was amazing.  However, I simply poured the mushroom sauce over the meatloaf and left some sauce on the side for the mashed potatoes.  I also added a touch of dry white wine to the sauce.  Delicious!!

This is an excellent recipe.  Just be aware that a 2.5 lb meatloaf is a big, honkin' meatloaf!  Serves eight?  Eight who?  Eight linebackers?  For regular folks, I would say it serves more like 10-12.  But it is delicious and does make for a very moist meatloaf.

This is so good! I doubled the gravy part of the recipe, so that I would have enough for my mashed potatoes. 
I will definitely be making this again!

To eliminate having so much fat in the gravy, I added just enough gravy to cover the bottom of the pan and cooked the meat loaf separately, for about 45 minutes. Then I took it out of the oven and drained off all the fat. Then I added the rest of the gravy and cooked for another 30 minutes. It was a lot less fatty that way and it still tasted great.

This sauce turned my meatloaf into a "gourmet" meatloaf. We even had to drink some wine with the loaf. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks!

2 thumbs up from my family! I only used 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tbsp of butter to saute the mushrooms and I omitted the salt as I used beef Better then Bullion for the broth, I only had 5% cream but it still worked great, will definitely make again.

WONDERFUL!!!! I used Baby Bella mushrooms instead of Shiitake mushrooms. I followed the rest of the directions exactly. This was such a delicious sauce/gravy. I paired it with a Double Cheese Meatloaf recipe that I have and browned the meatloaf in the iron skillet that I was going to make the sauce/gravy in. Then I removed the meatloaf and kept it warm in a 375 degree  oven until  the sauce/ gravy was ready to receive the meatloaf. I baked it in the 325 degree oven for one hour and ten minutes. The internal temp was 185. The meatloaf was very moist as the recipe always is and the only thing I am going to change is to double this recipe for the sauce/gravy, and use a larger oven safe skillet next time.

I made this recipe for my family and they all just loved it. I didn't think it had enough flavor for me and would use shiitake mushrooms next time, as that is the only change I make as I already had white mushrooms on hand.

I made this meatloaf tonight for our anniversary and my husband and our guests raved about it.  This is one of those recipes that has some wiggle room if you don't have all the ingredients listed.  I used regular fresh button mushrooms, condensed milk rather than  cream.  My basic meatloaf recipe is one of those that doesn't have exact measurements so it turns out a bit different every time I make it.  The one I made tonight was perfect in the mushroom gravy.  I threw quartered potatoes into the gravy for an even more complete one pan dish.  We added a Persian Shirazi salad (tomatoes, cucumber, onion, mint, lemon juice, olive oil, salt & pepper) so had a wonderful dinner.  This recipe is a keeper.

Great dish.  What I did different was, I seasoned my meat with not only meatloaf seasoning but also I added rosemary garlic season that I only can find it at Sam's. Once I mixed all ingredients, I let it sit overnight in the fridge. I baked my meatloaf halfway and then drained all the fat and grease before adding the gravy sauce to it. I also doubled the recipe of the gravy just because I wanted it to be more saucy than on the dryer side.  Worked out very well. I will definitely make it this way again from now on. 
Update since I made it in August:
I’ve made this several times already and I’ve found it to also be just as good without the heavy cream!

I made the recipe with a ground beef using rolled oats.  I added chopped mushrooms to the loaf along with traditional onions, garlic etc.  Sauce was delicious.  Absolutely a keeper!

I made it and I have to say it as the best meatloaf I have ever had. I did add more mushrooms only because I bought too many but they were great. I also put a couple of slices of bacon on top but would it would have been fine without it. The mushroom gravy is what really made the dish. Big thumbs up...

Yes I did. However, the second time I made it, I made the meatloaf myself, and incorporated 1/2 can of undiluted Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup, into the meat mixture along with the spices, (do NOT use any salt, and only one egg) and sauteed onion and vegetables. 30 minutes into baking, I diluted the other half can of soup with water, and poured it over the top of the meat. It finished baking, with gravy inside, and out. YUM-O.

So I used cremini mushrooms instead of shiitake as they are more readily available where I live. Also I added a little brandy to the gravy mix as it’s a trick from when I make mushroom soup. Since Chef John didn’t have a meatloaf r cope I made up my own. And I figured if Rosemary was good for the gravy, then why not some in the meatloaf with onions and garlic. Yum!

I used crimini and white button mushrooms because the store didn't have shitakes.  I also substituted a mixture of 1% milk and whole Greek yogurt for the heavy cream.  It was what I had on hand.  Other than a splash of sherry, I followed the rest as written.  A great way to cook meatloaf.  The meatloaf flavors the gravy and vice-versa!  Rave reviews from the Sunday dinner crowd! Definitely a keeper.

This is by far the BEST meatloaf I have ever had or made.  I made a basic meatloaf recipe with the beef, pork and veal, added my mother's favorite ingredients (egg, milk, bread, ketchup, salt and pepper) then made the mushroom sauce.  OMG...what flavor!  I didn't use shitake mushrooms, I used baby bellas.  I will make this again and again.

My family and I just LOVE this repie, I make a basic meatloaf with it (ground beef, breadcrumbs, egg, bouillon powder, ketchup and warm water), and I cook the above recipe as stated, no changes as it doesn't need it, it's fabulous as it is, the sauce it produces is soooo good, and I serve it with mashed potatoes, green beans/peas.  Great comfort meal on a cold winter day.

I've made this 2 times already - 3rd time will be this weekend. I use a very basic meatloaf recipe, and only use about 1lb of meat (just making it for 2 and I don't want TOO much left over). The creamy mushroom sauce is incredible. It keeps the meatloaf moist (even when using turkey!) and is delicious served over the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. I love it so much, I've pretty much stopped making meatloaf without this sauce. Oh, and I use regular mushrooms because shiitake are too expensive for my budget. Still great though!

Made this for the 1st time tonite, using our favorite straight Beef meatloaf recipe. Followed sauce recipe exactly. When I was forming the loaf, I thought: "This thing is Huge! We'll be stuck eating this for a month"!......Not So! With only 2 men in the house, it Disappeared Immediately! Rave Reviews. Very Moist & Elegant Presentation....Would Definately make this for company. Served it with baked potatoes and steamed broccoli. This recipe has earned a place in the regular rotation.

Amazing flavor!  Hubby raved about it.  I loved it so much, I printed out the recipe and brought it to work.  Two of my coworkers made it and it was the talk of the office!  I used 2 lbs ground beef to 1 lb ground pork, breadcrumbs, milk, egg, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder...DELISH!  This is a definite keeper!

Changed the meatloaf game in my house! I didn't have beef stock , used chicken stock and added 1 beef bouillon cube and a dash of Worcestershire to beef it up. This was so good i even drenched my mashed potatoes in it! Will be making this one again! Thanks for the recipe! We loved it!

I also used chef Johns meatloaf recipe except I used premix ground pork, veal and beef meatloaf blend and of course did not use the red glaze (yuck).  Was very good.  Only thing I might try is to leave out or reduce the rosemary.  That flavor was a little strong.

I found this recipe about a month ago and I've made it 4 times already! My husband and I are addicted to this gravy. We have made the gravy and meatloaf twice, gravy and pork chops,  and gravy and turkey for Thanksgiving! I made it exactly per recipe and it turned out awesome every time. We could literally drink it Thank you Chef John for the best gravy recipe ever!

This was very yummy!  I used the Classic meat loaf recipe with it , set aside about 1/3 of the meat mixture for later, and had a great meatloaf with lots of gravy!  With the extra meat mixture, I made up some meatballs and froze them for another meal.  
Keeper recipe!

Very good mushroom flavor, but the straight meat was bland. I feel it needed some seasonings mixed unto the meat.

FANTASTIC!!!  For the meatloaf itself, I used the classic trio of ground meats,  Italian spiced dried breadcrumbs and plain panko breadcrumbs, diced vidalia onion, a whole egg,  ground garlic, salt, pepper, fresh chopped parsley.  I did brown the meatloaf a little in the oven, as Chef John mentioned (maybe stove top in a pan next time ?). The creamy mushroom sauce was spectacular. I added more cream than in the recipe, but it was awesome. this dish got huge raves and praises by very particular people, like my wife...and that says a lot !! haha. Delicious !!

This was a huge hit!!  Love it! I started cooking the meatloaf in the hot oven while making the gravy, this allowed me to pour off more of the fat before adding it to the gravy.    Very little fat remained after the meatloaf was done.   Will definitely make this again...." that gravy was great "

Loved the meatloaf, but the sauce is heavenly.  I’m thinking about making this sauce with egg noodles.  I didn’t have enough shiitake mushrooms so I added some baby Bella and oyster mushrooms.  And because I like a little sweetness, I added a little (?1/4 c) Madeira wine just before adding the broth.

The sauce is what makes this.  I have used the sauce for other meats like meat balls.  My husband said it would make a great mushroom soup base.

This is delicious Chef John... I love all your recipes... but 45 years ago I made up (out of necessity) many kid loving ground turkey recipes.  A time when turkey parts were not available.  Only Louis Rich had frozen ground turkey in the freezer section which was super cheap, 89 cents.  I made turkey meatloaf with onions, garlic and bread crumbs.  The cream of mushroom soup was poured over and baked with the meatloaf.  Super easy.  Carrots and potatoes cut up were added, surrounding the meatloaf.  A small amount of cream was added to thicken the gravy before removing from oven.  Family loved it and I still make it.  Also made  turkey 'hamburger' gravy over mashed potatoes.  Another kids favorite.

Oh my word was this delicious! I used a mix of mushrooms because that's what I had on hand. By the time I got to the point to add the cream it had simmered so long and was so thick it really didn't need it! Will for sure be a make again.

I took Chef Johns recipe for basic meatloaf and added it to the mushroom gravy.  It came out moist and delicious.  I think the key is the slow cooking at 325 for an hour and a half.  I didn't alter the recipes.  No matter how you make your meatloaf, adding it to this mushroom gravy will definitely enhance the flavor.  I've just started cooking and I have to say Chef John makes it easy, fun, and most of all delicious.

How this dish suits you depends on how you make your meatloaf. Ive made this several times, using different meatloaf combinations. In my opinion, make your meatloaf more on the bland side (not a lotta heavy spices) & really dial in the gravy. Which is what this recipe is basically for. I used 4 cups of mushrooms and more garlic. Think Salisbury steak.

This is really good and different.  The only thing I did differently, was to drain some of the juices off midway through.  You probably need to use the most lean meat you can find.

I used Chef Johns classic meatloaf recipe to accompany this mushroom gravy and I’d have to start with saying I don’t recommend the pairing. There are too many flavors in the meatloaf and they detract from the flavors in the gravy. So this review is for the gravy. It is VERY good and if you follow the steps and the tips it is very easy and tasty. Note, you can get by with less than 2 cups of shiitake mushrooms to save cost.            I used 3 oz shiitake and tossed in a handful of sliced white mushrooms that I had on hand. The only other substitution was half and half rather than heavy cream. It was still plenty creamy and was good on the meatloaf and great on mashed potatoes.  I would make this again and use it on a simpler meatloaf to make the meatloaf more “fancy”.

This was EXCELLENT!  I usually don't care too much for meatloaf but this was wonderful!  I used the shitake mushrooms .but added some chopped onion after the browning started and one clove of garlic. Also not a fan of rosemary so I substituted fresh thyme  Slid in my meatloaf, made of ground round to cut out the extra fat and allowed to brown before spooning gravy over top.  Also made a smaller loaf for 2 of us, about 1- 1/4 lbs of meat. Baked at 325 for a little over an hour in a roasting pan.  The gravy only needed slight skimming of fat - I did add a little extra broth and cooked for a few minute to warm back up after allowing meatloaf to rest.  The gravy was excellent on mashed potatoes and the 1st time in my 67 years I've ever had gravy on meatloaf - what a wonderful surprise - more like a heavenly salisbury steak!   Thank you Chef John for another great recipe!

Did the mushroom sauce using dried morels that I re-hydrated.  
Nice flavors.
For the meatloaf, I did 1/2 veal and 1/2 beef with mushrooms and onion soup mix and breading and egg.
This recipe takes time to do.

My husband and I love this recipe! It's the only way we make meatloaf anymore. I actually make this in the crockpot. Makes the meatloaf so moist and flavorful.

I made this meatloaf per the recipe.  The meatloaf was moist and tasty and I especially liked the gravy.  This is a keeper but I may omit the veal because it is costly.

I couldn't find shiitake mushrooms so I used plain white mushrooms. It was really good and is now my go to recipe for making extra gravy for my chicken pot pie (use chicken broth) and meatloaf (use beef broth).

This was by far my the tastiest meatloaf I've ever eaten!  It was super moist due to it baking in the mushroom gravy,  which was amazing!!

Made my own meatloaf recipe and cooked it all in a single Nesco Roaster. Seared mini-meat loafs in butter and mushrooms then added the rest. Served over Orzo. 

Almost no cleanup (1-bowl, 1-pot, and the removable roaster pan -- and less than 45 minutes from start to finish. Incredible flavor, highly recommended!!

I made this tonight and it was very good.  I couldn't get the meat mixture so I used  1/2 pork and 1/2 beef and I used Chef John's prison style meatloaf recipe.  I think when I make it again I will add a little white wine to the sauce for a little zip. It did take a good hour and a half and to cook.

This gravy turned out great!  I followed Chef John's instructions in the video and baked the meatloaf for about 20 minutes before spooning the gravy over top.  I also used the recommend Classic Meatloaf recipe and it was very moist and a great way to get all those veggies in!

Rating based on the gravy alone.  It did lend to a very moist loaf, but had a flavor that was a bit too sweet. Glad that I didn't use rosemary, which I enjoy, but wished it had called for a more concentrated beef flavor, using beef base instead of basic sauce. The pre-sliced mushrooms I used also ended up having many stems, next time I will clean and slice my own.

Made it as per the recipe with the exception of the type of mushrooms. I used 8 oz of canned mushrooms since I didn't have time to go to the store. The result was excellent and family enjoyed it.  

I used a deep cast iron skillet to make the sauce, placed a 2 lb meatloaf in the skillet, and put right into the oven.  After skimming the meatloaf fat, the meal was ready.  Easy and quick. I'm not a meatloaf fan, but doing this way made me change my mind. I'll be making this again!

I am not so fond of tomato-y  or  ketchup tasting Meatloaf. This is now my most favorite meatloaf recipe!!   I made my mushroom meatloaf, and cooked it as above. All my family ate so much, that out of 3.5  lb meatloaf I had only enough leftovers for 2 sandwiches!!  usually I have enough for three more days of meals... Thanks for a great meatloaf change!!!

I'm giving this 5 stars for it being easy to assemble (I prepped the meatloaf ahead of time) and made the sauce after it was baked.  The gravy is so tasty!  OMG. I would slather it on a lot of things...  yum!  Looking forward to my lunch tomorrow!

Made the gravy to serve over the "Meatloaf With A Twist" recipe by Blonddee last night.  I don't care for ketchup or bar-b-q sauce on top.  Always used cream of mushroom soup for a gravy.  Hubby loved it.  Next time will double the gravy recipe as not enough for the leftover meatloaf.  Used dried shiitake mushrooms that I always have on hand.  Just soaked them up before browning them in the butter.  Hubby couldn't wait another night to have the leftovers, he made the mushroom gravy tonight.

The sauce is essentially Cream of Mushroom soup - so if you're really feeling lazy or in a hurry you can essentially just get a can of that and save the steps for making the sauce.  
But its so much more fun (and tasty) to make things from scratch.   

I loved the shitake mushrooms in there.  Chef gave a nice tip  on letting them brown up with the butter and flour before adding the stock - it keeps the mushrooms firm and stops them  from getting spongy.    

   I baked my meatloaf naked (the meatloaf, not me) for an hour like the chef suggested in order for it to brown up....and then dumped the sauce over the top.    Turned out beautifully.

 I'm not a fan of the ketchup-glaze that is the most popular topping for meatloaf.   Some version of this will be my regular recipe from now on.

I made Chef John's meatloaf recipe and added it to this AMAZING sauce! 
Both my young boys and husband LOVED it and it has been added to our recipe box! We made sandwiches the next few days too!

I made this, but reduced the broth by 1/2 cup, as we like thicker gravy. This was by far the best mushroom gravy I've ever tasted!

I used the Brown Sugar Meat Loaf recipe from this site. I shaped the mixture into a loaf and cooked it for about 1/2 hour in a large roasting pan without the lid so it could brown a bit  before pouring the sauce over it. I cooked it with the lid on for another hour and then served it in the roasting pan. For the sauce I added onions and a sweet orange pepper I had on hand that I had to use up. It added a nice flavour to the sauce. I didn't have shitake mushrooms so used regular mushrooms. Even with those changes it was clear that the sauce was excellent even without the additions of the extra veggies. This may be my new favourite mest loaf recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe as written and it came out great! I did however season my meatloaf mixture with salt and pepper and green onions before forming the loaf. Also if you watch the video Chef John (the recipe submitter) suggests browning the meatloaf in the oven for a while before spooning  the sauce over the meatloaf, which I did and it was awesome. Five stars for sure!!!!

Excellent!  Turned my average venison meatloaf into something special.  Didn't adjust the recipe at all and it turned out perfect:  rich, creamy, mushroomy goodness.

I used this method with the three meat meatloaf and wow. I used white shrooms, not tasty shitake, so I added about a half tablespoon of smoked peppercorns and the sauce which then had a pleasing, subtle smokey edge. Then I used bbq, ketchup, siracha sauce combo for the top. Also I used 1 t of thyme instead of basil (I was out). Kudos Chef John!

I really enjoued the simplicity of making this with everyday ingredients yet what an amazing presentation! I didnt have rosemary so i left it out and ramped up the garlic. I used my everyday meatloaf recipe and this sauce took it to a new level. Delicious!!

I didn't use shitaki's and I didn't cook the meatloaf in the sauce, but it was amazing!  Even the people who didn't like mushrooms ate them.  I will be using this for many other things.  (Chicken, pork, etc.)

OMG!!! This was absolutely delicious and I'm not a fan of mushroom! This was my first time making meatloaf using another recipe from this site, and I wanted a sauce/gravy to go with it other than the usual ketchup mix and this was it! It's creamy and flavorful it really makes any meatloaf taste yummy! I doubled the sauce but other than that I followed the recipe.

The mushroom sauce was great  Made it as described and it turned out pretty darn good.  Couldn't find fresh rosemary, used dried instead.  .  I used the "Easy Meatloaf" by Janet Caldwell.   Will try her sauce next time.

Yum! Made this last night using my own meatloaf recipe with ground lean beef (90%-10%) was delicious! Served with mashed potatoes and peas. Will definitely make this again! Used regular (button?) mushrooms since that's what I had on hand. Gravy was a little thin but so tasty it didn't matter!
