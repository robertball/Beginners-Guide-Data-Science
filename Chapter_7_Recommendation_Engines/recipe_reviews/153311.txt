a little dry and overly sweet. adding cream to serve with helped cut the sweet. I will say that my husband doesn't care for peanut butter, but he could not stop picking the topping and eating it.
This was good for a quick warm dessert with few ingredients.

A very tasty apple crisp recipe. I modified it slightly increasing the peanut butter to 3 tablespoons and the brown sugar to 1 cup. Delicious with either ice cream or whipped cream.

This was VERY quick and easy. My butter was straight out of the fridge so I stuck it in a coffee cup and nuked for 30 secs before adding it to the topping. My only issue is it is way too sweet. If I try this again I think I will at least halve the brown sugar. Seems like an easy dessert for kids to make

I found this to be rather bland compared to my usual apple crisp.  Also, I didn't like the texture with it being cooked in the microwave.  I think if I were to make this again (and not sure I'd bother), I'd cook it in the oven.

I made this for Mother's Day today, with a few tweaks. Into the crumble topping I added in an egg and added a full tablespoon of butter and peanutbutter, as I was afraid it was going to be a little too dry. I also find that mixing it with the apples isn't a bad idea. Don't make it into a crust! It's absolutely delicious!

hmmm...this recipe confuses me.  i chose it because my oven was full of a roast, but i wanted something for dessert, so the microwave prep, although curious, was enticing.  so i went for because in my house, we love apples, and we love peanut butter...and love dipping apples in peanut butter, so it should be a match made in heaven, right?  not so much.  the peanut butter flavor is VERY mild, and needs to be increased significantly.  the prep in the microwave also doesn't do good things to the "crisp" topping, which after being nuked for 16 minutes, was nothing close to crispy, but more like serious mush.  so all in all it wasn't terrible, but not something i'd make again.  the leftovers sat in the fridge for a week, and then got tossed.

Needed a quick dessert.  Hubby and cousin LOVED the peanut butter in the crisp! I did do as another suggested and did add three heaping TBS of peanut butter instead of two (hubby really likes peanut butter). And a side note - I had canned apples - so I used those - turned out delicious!
