Start by saying that I am 100% Italian. This is a recipe for pasta fagioli an Italian soup that means "pasta with beans". Pasta Fagioli does not have ground meat,carrots,celery etc. It has pasta, tomato and beans. By the way this recipe as it stands is very good.

I will admit I altered the recipe quite a bit, but relative simple changes and this turned out great!  This is definitely a quick fix and don't be fooled into thinking you must have all the ingredients - experiment a little!  

My recommendations for improvemnent:  Don't use the recommended pasta.  Try using a very small amount of fideo pasta (it plumps and absorbs a lot, so use sparingly to avoid a stew like texture) or you can also try 1/2 - 2/3 cup of mini macaroni (salad macaroni).  The fideo and mini macaroni can be added directly to the soup during the last 20-25 minutes of simmer time.  This elimates the need to cook the pasta separately.  Also, omit the salt.  Substitute chicken (or beef) broth/bouillon cubes instead of the water.  I used 3 cups chicken stock (bouillon) and 2 cups water (which is why I omitted the salt).  I also substituted one 15oz can diced tomatoes and one 15oz can of tomato sauce instead - definitely worth this alteration!  I didn't have navy beans so I used a can of chickpeas instead.  

Be generous with the parmesean cheese - put about a generous 1/2 cup portion instead - this helped with the overall flavor!  

I've made it a few times now and each time it tastes better than the last - especially with the minor adjustments!  Thanks for a great starter recipe!

I was really surprised by how good this is.  I've tried a lot of pasta e fagioli recipes, and none of them have tasted like what I remember eating in Italy as a child--until now.  I didn't experience excessive thickening of the soup, but I did cook it with a lid on.  I do recommend doing this.  It is very thick the next day, but this is expected with bean-based soups, and does fine with a little water added.  Thank you for the recipe!

Since I’m always willing to try new recipes I tried this one, before reviewing it. While different from mine, this is a good recipe. I’m 67 years old and yes, Italian also (which doesn’t make me an authority)! I have been making my variation of Pasta Fagioli for a long time and I always use celery. For a reviewer to make such a broad statement that celery or carrots are NEVER in Pasta Fagioli, is just wrong. If you like celery or carrots in your Pasta Fagioli, by all means USE THEM! This is a peasant or farmers type meal and they had to use what they had on hand. Yes this is basically a bean and pasta soup without meat, although there are authentic recipes that use Pancetta (Italian bacon), obviously from peasants with more Lira than the average peasant… lol… so if you want meat USE IT! After all, you’re cooking to please yourself and your family. If you check Lidia Matticchio Bastianich’s recipe, (from Lydia’s Italy on PBS) her recipe has potatoes, carrots and ham hocks in it. So you see, as with any recipe, there are probably as many variations as there are cooks, and all recipes are authentic to each individual cook. Experiment and cook to satisfy yourself, that’s what makes cooking fun and exciting! Mangia!

This was GREAT!!!  I did have to make some adjustments b/c I only had a 40 oz can of cannellini beans, so I elimated the navy beans, and used the whole can. I also added 2-14oz cans of diced tomatoes, and 1-14oz can of sauce.  Used chicken broth instead of water. Added a bit of crushed red pepper for some kick, some crumbled cooked bacon, and served w/ grated asiago cheese. ALSO, cook the pasta separately and run cold water on and allow to cool before adding to soup, so it doesnt absorb all of the broth!!  Great w/ crusty bread and salad.

My husband and I thought this was delicious.  Based on some of the reviews, I decided to reduce the amount of past to 1/2 lb.  In the future, I would possibly reduce this even further to 1/3 lb.  Other than that, I think that it is a great recipe.  I make it again and again.

I have to give this recipe 5 stars because it's definitely the best recipe of it's type that I've tried, from several sources.  I made a few adjustments based on the reviews...I added bite-sized carrots and celery to the onion as it was cooking.  I added a 14.5 oz can of petite diced tomatoes, and used 3 cans of beans: 2 red kidney beans and 1 can of great northern beans (comparable to the other white beans called for in the recipe).  I used less olive oil to cook the onion, and romano rather than parmesean cheese.  I also only used 4 cups of liquid: 2 cups of water and 2 of chicken broth.  I think next time I'll use the full 5 1/2 cups of liquid, as my husband thought the broth was just a bit too tomatoey.  I thought it was great, and I'll definitely make it again.  I served it with the Garden Herb loaf from this site, which is a hearty, chewy bread and a great companion for this soup.

This was delicious.  Based on other reviews, I added 1/2 package frozen spinach, chicen broth rather than water, and 1 can tomato sauce & 1 can diced tomatos.  Will certainly make again!

For all those who didn't think this was "soup," try adding the pasta to each serving individually. That way the "soup" doesn't get soaked up.  I cook the pasta, put it separate bowl at the table, or in a ziplock bag and add it as I prepare servings. I do the same with the cheese.

PLEASE PEOPLE DO NOT BUTCHER THIS RECIPE! This is exactly what a true Italian Pasta Fagioli is supose to be. Both my 100% Italian Father and Mother-in-law make it almost exactly like this. It is suppose to be more of a beans and pasta dish than a soup. The only thing that I did was added a can of diced tomato's, extra garlic and substituted chicken broth/red wine for the water as that is the way my Dad does it. This is authentic:-) Thanks Andrea!

I thought this recipe was great but needed some additions! I added 2/3 # of ground sirloin (browned), sliced carrots, sliced celery and I added one 15oz can of diced tomatoes (with juice) and one 15 oz can of tomato sauce instead of the large can of tomato sauce the recipe calls for. This turned out great and I also only used 1/3# of the pasta! Added extra parmesan too!

This recipe is good and basic and used a lot of ingredients that I always have on hand. I tried a variation by using a can of stewed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce. It made the soup a lot more hearty. I also added a little crushed red pepper to give it a kick. The amount of pasta that the recipe calls for is way too much! Otherwise, definitely good for a good, simple meal.

I gave this recipe 5 stars without having to make it. I know it is good because it is almost exactly like the one my Italian mom made for me and what I make for my family.The only exceptions are I do not add onions.I am sure it would be a welcome addition making the dish a little sweeter if that is what you like.Also I like to add a Knorrs vegetarian boullion cube,then omit extra salt.This is one of my families favorites and very easy.Sometimes I use crushed tomatoes or petite diced depending on what I have same goes for the pasta elbows ,shells,etc. One product I do prefer to use is Progresso Cannelini beans they stay firm also the juice they are packed in is less gelatin like then others.I do agree with a comment that was made in a review about not changing this recipe into something it is not. It is beans and pasta, great in its simplicity an Italian peasant dish. Oh and don't forget to sprinkle parmesan on top!

Everyone who wants to change this recipe and still call it Pasta e Fagioli should read this review:  Reviewed on Jan. 7, 2010 by T-Bone     Start by saying that I am 100% Italian. This is a recipe for pasta fagioli an Italian soup that means "pasta with beans". Pasta Fagioli does not have ground meat,carrots,celery etc. It has pasta, tomato and beans. By the way this recipe as it stands is very good.    Also, I have made this recipe over and over and find that it needs no 'kickers' or additions or subtractions.  This is a true Pasta e Fagioli.  My only change would be to make more of it.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Excellent recipe, I took the advice of others and used 2-14oz cans diced tomatoes in place of the sauce. Doubled the onions and garlic, used chicken broth instead of water. Added 1/2lb italian sausage, casing removed and cooked, decreased the pasta to 1/2lb. Sprinkled the parmesan cheese onto each individual bowl just before serving. Will be making again....

This was excellent, I followed advice of others and replaced the water with low sodium/low fat chicken broth.  I also added 1# ground chicken (only because according to my husband, it's not a meal without meat).  I also used 1 can diced tomatos (italian style) & 1 can tomato sauce.
My husband LOVED it - he added Creole seasoning to his helping & it did add really great flavor to it.

I used an extra can of canellini beans, and approx. 1/3 lb. of ditalini.  It was the first time I made it, and it was perfect!!  It had a lot of flavor, without needing to use chicken or vegetable broth, and my vegetarian mother loved it!

I've been trying to make a pasta fagiolelike our local Italian restaurant's and this is it!  I substituted veggie broth for the water. But I made it with the entire 1lb pasta - soaked up all the sauce, even adding it for only five minutes. I will use 1/3 the next time. Everyone raved about this soup.  THANKS!

I simplified things by cooking the pasta in the pot of soup because the leftovers were going to be combined anyway.  Even though I only used 1/2 lb of ditalini, the noodles still absorbed almost all of the liquid while cooking!  Next time I'm either going to cook (and refrigerate) the noodles separately or else use only 1/4 lb of noodles.  Also I thought the soup was a bit too heavy on the herbs.  Good other than that.  But my husband loved it and made a sad face when I told him I'd use less pasta next time.  Giving it 4 stars because I'm assuming it would be better as written with the noodles cooked (and stored!) separately.

Very delicious and easy to make. I followed some advise from other reviews. I used chicken broth instead of water, I only used 16oz of can tomato sauce and added a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes. I also cut the pasta amount to 1/2 pound. Next time I might add some chopped fresh spinach leaves to sneak in more veggies. I will definitely be making this again.

This is delicious already, and I haven't even let it simmer for very long!  I did add 3 carrots, 2 celery ribs, and 2 zucchini, all chopped, and a 15oz can of Italian stewed tomatoes (chopped) and 15oz sauce for a little veggie-ness. I will be making this again and again!

I have found several good recipes on this site, but this is my favorite!  It's easy, delicious, and healthy, what more can you ask for?  This is also one of the few recipes that everyone in my family loved.  I took the advice of some of the other reviews and replaced the water with chicken broth and the tomato sauce with two 14 oz cans of italian seasoned diced tomatoes and it's perfect.  Will definitely be one of my regulars!  Thanks  for this great recipe!

This was a good basic recipe. I took the advice of others and used chicken broth instead of water, additional garlic and added carrots and corn. I also added some mini meatballs. Instead of tomato sauce I used plum tomatoes in the can that I roughly chopped. This made it more liquidy.

this was one of the best soups i ever had! i ended up using tons more cheese and white beans instead of navy beans because i could not find them. i also used mini penne noodles because i could not find the ones your recipe called for. My husband LOVED this!!

Not bad. If I were to make it a second time I'd probably only use half the amount of pasta called for, and fresh basil wouldn't hurt either. But, since it was not a hit with my children and my husband didn't get excited about it, it's going on the back burner.

Oh wow! This recipe certainly earned all the glowing reviews! Following reviewer's advice to substitute chicken bouillon for plain water made this especially delicious. Also added carrots and spinach for some extra veggie deliciousness. Between three people, I hardly had any leftovers and they disappeared the next day.

This is more like minestrone.  I prefer to use one of the regular pasta e fagioli recipes (preferably one that calls for water rather than chicken broth) and use a pinch of chipotle pepper powder to replace the smoky taste of the ham or prosciutto in the original.

I found this to be a quick, frugal and tasty recipe.  I made this for a friend who came by for dinner with her young son.  We all ate by candlelight.  Two single moms with our children.  There were NO leftovers and my friend asked for the recipe and more like it the next day.  Seems this recipe inspired her to eat frugal but healthy also.  This is a recipe box keeper.

This soup had me singin' in ITALIAN!  OMGOSH it was soooo good and I'm not really one to rave over Pasta Fagioli!  Really GREAT recipe!  I only changed a few things... (which is big for me!)  I chopped the onion ... I added 2 tsp of chicken bullion and a few dashes of salt too.  I also added 1/2 tsp cumin and two parmesan rinds because it did seem like it needed a little something else.  I didn't have the beans it called for on hand so I used one can of kidney and one can of black beans UNDRAINED... I didn't have the right pasta either so I used a tri-colored bow tie pasta which I DID NOT ADD RIGHT AWAY... I allowed the soup to simmer for an hour and 15 minutes - occasionally stirring it and I cooked the pasta separately so that it wouldn't get soggy with any leftovers.  I just put in 1/2 cup of the pasta in the bottom of each bowl to serve and garnished with grated parmesan!  Dang it was SOOO GOOD!  Okay so... after typing this up it seems I did changes some things --- but let's just say I TRIED to keep to the recipe... oh yeah --- one more thing (I'm laughing now!) Instead of parsley - I always substitute cilantro.... I can't help myself.  So... so much for not changing much!  HA!  Served with garlic bread - EVERYONE LOVED IT and most had seconds!

Great basic recipe, but I added some veggies like: 2 stalks of celery, 2 large carrots, 1 Zucchini, chicken broth instead of water, fresh basil, 1/2 cup of frozen spinach and a little extra parmesan cheese. I also cooked less pasta. It's really good!

This has become the recipe I get asked to make whenever we are invited somewhere. It gets raves from everyone. I do reduce the pasta to 1/2 lb, use chicken broth in place of water, and during cooking I leave the pot covered (to avoid the liquid being totally absorbed by the pasta), but otherwise I follow the recipe exactly, and the results are amazing.

One time I tried browning a pound of ground sausage and adding it to the soup, and it was good that way too, but certainly not necessary

this soup was excellent!
i substituted the paramesean cheese with a non dairy paramsean flavored "cheese" and used vegetable broth instead of water.  i couldn't find the cannellini beans so i doubled up on the navy, but being that i haven't had this before i can't compare.  none the less, it was delicious!  i agree with the below information on the noodles. wait til the rest of the soup is done and add to each serving.

Oh my goodness this recipe is wonderful! So far I've made this recipe twice. The first time I made this recipe it was really good on its own. Now I just recently made this recipe again and let me tell you I understand how frustrating it is when people complain a recipe is "bad" after a million changes THE INDIVIDUAL MADE ON THEIR OWN. But this isn't the case, there's no harm letting people no what they did in addition to the recipe as long as you aren't bashing the original recipe without giving it a chance ( if that makes any sense lol ) Moving along, the second time I made this recipe I added carrots, celery, chicken broth instead of the water it called for, and finally I added crumbled mild Italian sausage while reducing the amount of pasta, and topping it off with just a tad more shredded parmesan cheese when I served the pasta fagioli. I personally loved it even more with the addition of Italian sausage. ( You can add Pancetta if you don't like the Italian sausage.) I completed this dish with wheat french bread and a salad. Thank you for submitting this recipe I appreciate it and don't be afraid to experiment with this dish, that's the beauty of cooking.

Pasta Yumioli! I added extra cheese because everything is better with cheese (seriously, I want extra cheese on my cheese).  I used veggie broth instead of water and added a can of diced tomatoes. Make sure you make your noodles separately because they are super absorbent and will SUCK all your JUICES. I sent some of this soup to my sister who was sick and it magically healed her. So I'm not gonna say this soup magically healed her but I will say it probably did.

I substituted diced tomatoes for tomato sauce, and broth for water. Microwaved a 10 oz block of frozen leaf spinach and added that in the end, with the pasta. I felt mighty righteous for making such a nutritious dish! It was so good, served with Aidells Artichoke & Garlic and crusty bread on the side.

This is a very good and quickly made version of this favorite soup. When making this I keep the basic seasoning and ingredients other than the veggies, and vary those by what I have or what's in season.
Everyone in  the family likes it. (We're not Italian)
 In the past I've made a version I found on the net that states it's and Olive Garden clone recipe, which is what I make when I have a little more time...

I've made other pasta fagioli recipes before but this is by far the absolute best!  My husband says "forget all the others and keep making this one!"  The only thing I did differently was to use chicken broth instead of water...

Recipe is great, but would recommend a few changes. I used 4 cups of chicken broth and the rest I used water. Another can of beans would be a great addition. I used the advice of others and kept the pasta and soup separate until serving, and kept remaining leftovers separate as well and mixed when reheating. One pound of pasta was too much, I'll reduce to 3/4 pound next time.

As an Italian-American, I have tasted many versions of pasta e fagioli, and this is excellent. 

For extra flavor, I replaced half of the water with chicken broth and added 1/2c red cooking wine. I also omitted the salt since both of these changes add salt.

If you plan on having leftovers, you may also want to consider leaving the pasta separate until serving since it will absorb most of the liquid. You don't need quite the full pound of pasta to use up the soupy part either.

One last small change I made was using a 29 oz. can of diced plum tomatoes and putting only half in the blender to leave some whole tomato pieces.

This soup was delicious!  I substituted 6 cups of fat-free chicken broth for the water, didn't use the salt and added a small can of diced tomatoes.  I also used about 1/2 pound of the ditalini.

This is delicious! I omitted the cheese to make it vegan. This will be in my weekly rotation. So healthy, delicious and very easy to make. The best thing about it is you can add other vegetables and it will still taste great. I added crushed tomatoes and fresh spinach. Yummy!

Great soup, easy to add your own vegetables to it etc. I made it as the recipe states and it came out great. I agree there was a bit too much pasta, half would do it. I plan on experimenting with this, perhaps add some heavy cream. A must try, feeds many.

I made this as presented with one minor change, I used diced tomatoes uindrained.  It was SO good.  I think I'd use less pasta next time though.    I also made the herb bread refrenced in a previous review....YUM!

My boys love their "Mama's pasta and beans" it is such a simple recipe but I am so afraid of messing it up and my boys no longer eating it.  So on Good Friday I went searchng for a recipe similar to my mothers but not exactly it.  This was the closest to it and it was delicious!  The boys ate it (although they still love Mama's better) and even my husband said it was very good.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Thank you for sharing!!

I love this soup (and so did everyone I served it to -- they were were scraping the bottom of the pot)!  After trying it a few times at local restaurants, I needed to find a great recipe for it -- and I did (plus it's fast).  Changes I made were using chicken broth instead of water, and using Great Northern Beans instead of cannellini and navy beans (I like them better).  I waited to add my pasta and parmesean cheese till the end as suggested by other reviewers.  Next time I will only use about 1/3 lb. of pasta, and I'll probably add another can of beans and maybe try not draining them (I like a strong bean flavor).  Thanks Andrea!

This tasted good, but the pasta soaked up most of the liquid once it was added.  It also makes a lot - so when we had the leftovers, there was no liquid left.  I liked it okay, but I will not make it again.

I have a hard time with tomato based soups. I was hoping to have some luck with this recipe but it just turned out ok. I added some spinach which gave it some nice color. I probably will not make this again. NOTE: As with the other viewers I added the pasta last. Be careful how much you add as it will overtake the soup.

Wow, Andrea, thanks so much to you and all the other reviewers!  This is fantastic.  I used chicken broth in place of water, petite diced tomatoes (undrained) in place of tomato sauce and added mushrooms and 1/2 lb cooked hot Italian sausage.  It is quite thick with the whole lb. of pasta but that's the way we like it!

so bland.  You cant make soup in an hour.  maybe if you let it reduce all day it would gain some flavor and thickness.  It was basically tomato water with beans.

I grew up with "beans and macaroni" being thick. So I added the ditalini in the base and used beef broth instead of water. Also just a little crushed red pepper for some zing. End result wonderful and exactly what I was looking for. Just like grandma's.

Simply delicious! Definitely will make again. What a wonderful recipe!!
 Like other reveiwers I altered the recipe a bit. I subsituted chicken broth for the water, fresh garlic for powdered and added some bacon. I also cut down on the tomato sauce and added a can of diced tomatoes. 
I put the pasta in the soup 20 minutes before it was done. Personally I wasn't too happy with that since it soaked up all the liquid so I added another can of chicken broth. My husband and father loved it as it was which wasn't much of a soup.

Love this recipe, simple to make.  Added chopped bacon or ham to make it more flavorful.  A little too much pasta so reduced the pasta portion.  Very rich in tomato flavor and tasted great.

This is an excellent dish! I made it almost to the T as described by the original author. The only thing I changed was that I added fresh basil leaves instead of dried basil. One variation if you are dieting is to use 1 less tbsp olive oil and use about 1/3 amount of pasta but substitute a multigrain ditalini or even rotini, which is easier to find at most grocery stores. Oh, one other thing, I use kidney beans and cannelini beans. This is too good to miss!

This was pretty good.  I used red kidney beans, and I added a can of diced tomatoes and a square of beef bullion.  If I make it again, I will use a smaller pasta ... I used small penne and I think it was too much, this needs a smaller shape.  I would also add chiffonade spinach leaves. But overall, this had very nice flavor and I will definitely try it again.

This was amazing!  Better than any restaurant! I used 4 cups of veggie broth and 2 cups of water.  I decreased the pasta too.  And I added a few other veggies (carrots, zuchini, squash).  I added adobe spice too.  Letting it simmer for an hour really helped to soak in the taste!  Great recipe!

This came out very good. Both me and my husband ate it all up in 3 days. The third day is when it tasted the best when all the seasonings were really blended together. Only thing I did different is used half the amount of pasta since we wanted a more soupy pasta fagioli. Making a second pot already for this weekend. :)

I have to agree with what T-Bone just said -- to an extent.  Every recipe for pasta fagioli I've made has been thick and yes, more like a pasta with beans and less like a soup.  Minor changes that don't change the concept are one thing, but I've never understood making drastic changes and then *rating* the recipe on that.  The only thing I disagree with is that people are *allowed* to do anything they want to a recipe - it's their food after all.  At any rate, the only thing I changed is that I dislike pieces of onion in stuff like this so I either leave it out or use liquid onion.  Otherwise as is.  Pretty easy.  Pretty decent stuff but not overly exciting - I've had better.  Definitely better when fresh since the pasta (as pasta will do) does soak up any liquid.  Fairly filling.

Yummy!  Makes a ton--next time I'll probably cut in half, as there are only three of us and it's more than we can eat in a couple of days. Also, next time I'll look at the can labels before I open them--instead of grabbing the cannellini and navy beans I grabbed the pinto and black bean cans that were right next to cannellini/navy. Whoops.  It was still tasty.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  I thought, because there were so many great reviews, I would enjoy this.  I found it to be very bland and unexciting.  My boyfriend did enjoy it, though.

Very Good soup.  My 7 year old son made this by himself with the exception of some onion chopping help.  Super easy to make and I usually have the ingredients.  We used fresh basil since we had it on hand and home-made tomato sauce from last nights dinner.  Otherwise followed exactly.  Next time I might add some spinach or kale and a little more garlic.  Thanks for the post.  My son is really proud of himself!!

Just ok but still missing something.  I followed the recipe to the letter, but there doesn't really seem to be any bite to this dish.  The next day, I added some torn strips of pepperoni to it which did add some zip, but overall, I was a little disappointed given all the rave reviews.  I will probably make it again, and I'm certainly not a big fan of messing with recipes, but next time I will try to spice it up a bit.  Just ok for me.

The taste of this was delicious...BUT if you make a larger batch, or plan on keeping it for leftovers DON'T add all of the pasta...mine turned out mushy and I had to throw it out. I would suggest cooking the pasta and then placing an individual serving in a bowl and spooning the soup over it.

this just cooled enough for me to taste....it is AMAZING!! and oh so cheap to make. I am a student and wanted something filling and cheap...I got that and some great taste too!  Only thing I did--used chic broth instead of water, added 1/2 can left over black beans, added 1 tbl of premade pesto. I cooked the pasta seperate as directed and looks like I only added 1/2 the prepared pasta...oh this is gonna be great in my lunch this week!

I have been using this base recipe for a couple of years now, and just realized I never rated it! My family absolutely loves it, even my 4 year old! I add a 10 oz package of frozen spinach (cooked and drained), crumbled turkey sausage and I use spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. I also substiute chicken broth for the water. The pasta does soak up a lot of the soup, so I usually keep it in a seperate bowl, and let people dish out as much as they want in their soup. This is very easy and makes the whole house smell great! Serve with a loaf of crusty bread, and you have a great winter meal!

Delicious! I made a bulk batch of this to freeze in individual meal sized portions, and I found that adding the ditalini makes it bulk up and absorb all the broth. So if you plan to use this OAMC, or as a quick fix lunch, leave the ditalini out, freeze the soup without it, reheat, and then either add cooked ditalini or add a bit of extra water and raw ditalini. This is THE fagioli recipe. To make it a meal, add 1lb. wedding soup meatballs, and 1 lb. cooked bulk sausage. Yummy!

wow - this was the first time i've tried making pasta fagioli and it was spetactular.  i sampled the entire time i was cooking!  i made my own red sauce which made it better.  i used 4 cups chicken broth and 1.5 cups water, and added a bit more salt and pepper.  i also used fresh parsley and fresh basil which added a lot more authentic flavor.  about 2/3 pasta was still too much!  next time i'll half it.  overall, spectacular recipe!

This soup was delicious and so easy to prepare.  I used half of the recommended amount of tomato sauce and added a can of diced seasoned tomatoes.  I used chicken broth instead of water.  Next time, I will wait until I am ready to serve the soup to add the parmesan cheese, because it stuck to the bottom of the pot.

I love this recipe. I usually add a pound of lean ground beef and 1 package of frozen spinach. I also use beef broth instead of the water. I could eat this everyday!

Great! I used two 14 oz cans of tomato sauce, and one 14 oz can of petit diced tomatoes. One cannelloni and one kidney beans. Veggie broth instead of water, sauteed zucchini and squash with the onions and garlic, and used 1/2 the pasta. Added chopped spinach (big container) to soup last 3-5 minutes.

This soup was easy to make and delicious. My husband caught a cold and I whipped this up in no time. Very easy to transport to work in a storage container. I took the advice of others and used 1/2 pound pasta. A keeper!

I enjoyed this soup, however it was incredibly salty.  Since the recipe doesn't state whether to drain the beans or not, I included the liquids from their cans, which may have been the reason for this problem.  I also think my spices are too old as they didn't shine through over the taste of the salt.  I used 15 oz. tomato sauce & 15 oz. diced tomatoes with italian herbs as I didn't have the recommended amount of tomato sauce on hand.  If I try this recipe again, I will drain the beans & use new herbs.  Perhaps this will solve my problem.

This was a great hit on this snowy day.  Because of some changes I made to the recipe I did let it simmer much longer with everyone expressing how wonderful the aromas were in my kitchen.  These are the changes that I made:  in addition to onion use 3 carrots and 2 celery (all veggies chopped in food processor
48 oz can of chicken stock (do not use water) 
2 14.5 cans of diced tom w/evoo and burgandy (do not use tomatoe sauce
For beans use 2 cans of cannellini & 1 can Great Northern beans
add 1 smashed baked potatoe (skin removed).  As others suggested I did not add the ditalini pasta to the soup.  After cooking the ditalini I mixed it with a little evoo (extra virgin olive oil) to keep it from sticking.  I sprikled freshly grated cheese to the top of each bowl as it was served instead of adding to the soup.  It was really excellant soup and I can't wait for the leftovers today.

Pasta swells up to double the size the next day so it turns into a pasta dish.  Do half amount of recommended pasta.  Very good especially next day.

I love this soup and have made it recently for crowds of hungry women.  No leftovers.  I prefer a vegetable broth instead of water and have found 3 cans of cannellini (no navy beans) provides a better ratio of beans to pasta.

We used 1/2 the pasta like people suggested which was a very smart move.  My husband really enjoyed it but I thought it was kind of bland.  I froze some because it made a lot- at least 12 big bowls full.  I will add some extra beans if I make it again.

I really enjoyed this receipe and so did my husband.  He is very picky when it comes to soups but he really liked this one.  The only thing I would change is to cut up the onions a little smaller.  I also added some ground beef and that's pretty tasty too.

I thought this recipe was on the bland side.  I only used half the amount of pasta it called for, according to what other people were saying, and it was too much.  I think a third would be more than enough.

This soup is so good!  I scaled it to 30 servings for a party and people were raving about what a great cook I was!  I used chicken stock and less pasta as recommended and it was great.  The only thing I would do different if prepared for a large group is add a little more water and undercook the pasta.  The soup was kept warm on the stove all night, and after a couple hours all the liquid was absorbed and the pasta was a little overcooked.

This recipe was a bit sour and bland for me but I added a can of vegetable broth, 1-1/2 tsp of sugar, only 1/2 the pasta (PLENTY!) and 1 lb of Italian sausage crumbled and cooked. THEN it was perfect! A good base recipe but excellent with my alterations.

Definitely delicious!  I would reduce the pasta to 1/2 pound or even 1/3 pound and add an extra can of beans to make it a bit healthier.  I also used chicken stock rather than water, which added some flavor.  Was great with salad and bread!

With the help of an adult a child could put this great tasting soup together (and probably have fun doing so). May I also suggest for those of us that are lactose intolerant using a soy type cheese or its equivalent as a replacement for regular cheese? Thanks!

If you're looking for an authentic Italian pasta fagioli recipe, this is it. You can add whatever you want, but then it becomes minestrone or something else entirely. This is the recipe I've been making for as long as I've been cooking, except I use Roman beans when available. Cannelini are great too. Simplicity at its best.

This is a good base to a delicious soup. I added some ketchup (for flavor and thickness), as well as chicken, and red pepper flakes. I also used spiral pasta instead of the recommended.

I agree with one of the reviewers.  I had a Italian grandmother straight off the boat from Italy, and this soup does not have any meat in it, just olive oil, pasta, cannellini beans, tomato and garlic as main ingredients. I haven't ever made it and haven't eaten it since my Grammy passed away (when I was young) and I wanted to make this for my hubby, who loves homemade soup! I went to Pinterest first and all I got were recipes with ground beef in it.  I should have known better..all recipes is the best! Thank you for posting!

Everyone in my family, including grandchildren ages 2,3 and 6 absolutely love this soup! I do only one thing differently from the recipe, and that is I cook the pasta in the soup instead of separately. The kids love it nice and thick, and this is definitely accomplished by doing this. Otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly. I've made it many times now and the leftovers always get eaten up. Thanks for a great recipe!

Fabulous!!!    I made it with 2 cans of cannellini beans because Trader Joe's didn't have navy beans.  I also kept the pasta separate, as suggested, and simmered with the lid on for the hour.

I was skeptical, because I don't really like tomato-based soups, but this was EXCELLENT. I followed the directions exactly, aside from adding 1 small zucchini and 2 medium carrots, both diced. We all loved it, even the picky 6-year-old who hates anything "saucy." :) Next time, I might decrease the pasta by a bit.

Loved this - didn't have tomato sauce so I used 1 can of petite diced, and 1 box of strained crushed tomatoes - also didn't have navy beans so just added a second can of cannellini beans. Flavor was great and will make again.

Delicious! This is very similar to what my Italian-American mother used to make - right down to the ditalini as the pasta choice. We leave out the navy beans and double the cannellini. However, cannellini can be more expensive than most beans, so it's okay to use navy beans.

Yummy soup.  My Italian hubby loved it.  Next time I may serve the pasta in a dish and just mix with each serving.  The pasta tends to soak up all the broth.  Maybe less pasta.

This is a great quick and easy soup recipe. all I added was some carrots and kale to bump up the veggie nutrition. I'm always on the lookout for easy and hearty meatless recipes since I like to cook meatless a couple days a week to save on the grocery bill, and this one will definitely be added to my dinner rotation. Thanks!

Yummy. I used vegetarian "chicken" broth instead of H2O and left out the salt. Used 1/2 pound of bow-tie pasta instead. Next time I would add fresh basil, parsley, and oregano at the end. I think I could have done w/o Parmesan.

I save the rinds from the parmesan cheese and freeze them. Then when I make this soup, I throw in a rind. It  melts down, slightly thickening the soup and giving a wonderful rich flavor! I also only put in 1/2 cup of pasta since I like my soup to have lot's of broth.

My recipe is very similar but I use half tamato sauce and half Spicy tomato juice.  Like just a bit of a bite to it.

This is delicious, my husband loves it. Loses one star because 1 lb of pasta is way too much, almost to the point of inedible. The first time i made it, I only HAD a half a box, so that is what I used and it was a hit. The second time, I followed the recipe to the letter and used a whole lb and wished I hadn't. Had to throw the rest out. Other than that though, delicious.

This is pretty good. I used one cup of piccolini pasta, rolled up some seasoned ground turkey as meatballs and plopped them in. It just felt like there wasn't enough in the soup. I might try this again.

THIS IS GREAT!!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I altered it slightly but to be fair, I didn't try it as written.  Based on the reviews I used Contadina tomato sauce with Italian herbs and instead of water I used 2 cups of vegetable broth, 2 cups of chicken broth and 1.5 cups of chicken stock.  THE FLAVOR WAS WONDERFUL!!!  Next time I will use a little less pasta(maybe 0.5 or 0.75 instead of a full pound).  Hubby is also a major CARNIVORE and said next time I should add some Italian sausage (but he still went back for seconds and thirds)  ;o)

This recipe was very good but I used chicken stock in place of water. I also added two cans of cannellini beans. Also, do NOT add pasta to soup. Cook pasta separate and spoon soup over pasta. Otherwise pasta will absorb all the broth by the following day.

Delicious.  I use this recipe all the time.  I chop the onion instead of quartering it and if i have some left over pork whether bacon, pancetta, etc i saute it with the onion.  I also use only half the amount of pasta because one pound is way too much.

This was a great recipe. I did change it a bit though based on other suggestions. Perhaps, I made it in a way that broke the authenticity of it, but it was super tasty, and really that is all that matters. With that being said, I added 2 stalks celery with my onion. Rather than water, I used 4 cups chicken broth, 1 cup red cooking wine (will reduce to 1/2 cup next time, I think). I also added carrots with the tomato sauce etc, when if I was going to add them I probably should have threw them in with the the onions and celery.... they didn't soften very much but were still good, HOWEVER, I think the soup would be better without them so next time I most likely won't add. This is going in to my winter soup rotation. Healthy, hearty, and filling.... what more could I ask for?

Turned out more like spaghtettios than pasta fagioli, but they were freakin delicious spachgettios.  May have left the pasta in too long so it soaked up the liquid, great recipe.

The soup is very good; however, there was not enough broth.  I doubled the recipe as it was so I would have enough for us to eat on during the week.  Once I added the pasta into the soup, I lost all of the broth.  I had to make another batch of just the broth...it still was not enough so I had to make one final batch of broth.  I will have to adjust accordingly next time.  The soup was very good.  I will make it again.  10/21/2011:  I made it again.  I tripled the broth and left the rest.  I also kept the pasta out until we were ready to eat it then added it.  It was perfect.  Definitely a keeper.

I had to modify a little based on what I had on hand. I only had half the amount of tomato sauce so I added a can of stewed tomatoes in juice, plus some beef broth, and a only about 2/3 the amount of pasta....It came out awesome! Was very simple, & a  big hit...This is a great healthy,economical, easy-to-make dish! Will make again

Delicious as written.  Very easy prep.  Next time I'll cut the amount of tomato sauce, add diced tomato & use 1/2 water-1/2 stock.  Definitely will be trying this again with variations or exactly as written again.

Was the perfect soup with homemade rosemary bread.

Amazingly easy and amazingly yummy!  I've been looking for a good fagioli recipe for some time.  I'm not a big fan of oregano, but in this recipe it's hardly noticeable.  This is a great recipe.  I doubled it for my family of six so we would have leftovers.  I would encourage you to cook the pasta right in this pot and serve with some extra parm cheese and a fantastic loaf of crusty bread!  Who needs potpourri to fill their house with smell - this does the trick!

Great soup that is very easy to make. I don't make any changes to the original recipe. I usually make it to go along with several meals throughout the week. It goes great with grilled cheese sandwichs, salad with grilled chicken, burgers, and so much more. Thanks!

Made this tonight for dinner, it was very good. I made it exactly as written. I did have one problem but I think it was my fault. I let the soup sit for about 30 mins after it was done before we ate it and all the broth was soaked up by the noodles.  I will be making this again. Thanks!

Admitting that I know little about Pasta Fagioli I tried this recipe because I heard about it at work.  Gotta tell ya it is delish!  I added a touch of caynne pepper to spice it up otherwise my soup hating hubby wouldn't eat it.  This got a "you can make this again" review from him (yea).

This was really good but way too much pasta and that's saying a lot coming from me because i like a thick hearty soup with not a lot of broth.  Next time I will cut the pasta in half.  Another thing I will do differently is saving the parmesan for a garnish.  Adding it to the soup only resulted in the cheese sticking to my spoon every time I stirred it and taking the herbs with it!  Some additions I made was adding 2 diced carrots to the onion and garlic.  Sorry to the Italians who may be offended but I really enjoy the sweetness of the carrots in contrast to the acidity of the tomato.  I also added crushed red pepper and some hot sauce for a little kick.  With these minor changes this will be 5 stars.

I halved the pasta the recipe called for and it was still too much imo.  The beans and pasta soaked up the broth way too fast.  I didn't even bother saving this for leftovers because it would just be noodles and beans. It got 2 stars because the flavor at least was pretty good.

MMMM, so good!  This was exactly as I expected it to be and we really enjoyed it!  I only made a couple of small changes due to what I had on hand.  First, I had an opened can of tomato sauce to use up, only about 9 ounces, so used that, but added a full 28oz can of diced tomatoes (love a chunky soup).  I used small pasta shells as I didn't have ditalini.  It was no where close to a pound, but didn't measure, just cooked and added what I thought looked right.  I knew the extra cooked pasta would not go to waste with my 3 boys!  I also used a can each of red and white kidney beans.  Super easy and delicious!  Served this with homemade biscuits, yum!  Even hubby who asked before dinner what 'meat' we were having loved it, LOL!!!

I made it exactly as written except I used less than 1/2 of a box of pasta.  I couldn't find ditalini so I used small macaroni and it was great.  The taste was fabulous!!!  Thank you for a great easy recipe.

This was FABULOUS!!  I made only a couple minor changes.  I used (2) 14.5 oz. cans of diced tomatos with garlic and olive oil in place of the tomato sauce.  I felt the diced tomatos gave the stew more body.  Also I used light red kidney  beans instead of navy beans.  The directions here did not specify, but I drained both my canned beans for the most part before adding them to the stew.  I put the soup together in the evening and brought it to a boil first and then let it simmer 1 hour.  I put in fridge overnight and warmed on stove for dinner that night - took maybe 30 minutes...made ditalini pasta.  I knew I'd have left overs with only 2 1/2 (17 month old) eating so I kept the pasta separate from the soup and added it to the bowls when serving.  I didn't want the pasta to bloat in the leftovers.  Again, simple and FABULOUS!  My 17 month old suprised me by eating this and seemingly enjoying it!  We thought this Pasta Fagioli was wonderful!

Fantastic! make sure to add a can of black beans and a large can of diced tomatoes. It's a prettier and more full soup when you do that. We like penne pasta for this recipe. Oh and it's nice to have some bread  to dip in your soup bowl.

My family and I loved this dish, but I made some alterations as well. I used chicken broth in place of the water, added 3 diced chicken breasts, I didn't use quite the whole pound of pasta (it was still very stew-like, which we liked) and I also increased the amount of parm. I added half a box of frozen chopped spinach and a jar of mushrooms. It was yummy, I'll definitely make it again

My favorite soup! So Italian. So good. Made only these slight (and very delicious) adjustments. Substituted 5 c. chicken broth and 1/2 c. red wine in place of the water. Used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. This kept plenty of liquid while adding texture. Added fresh italian parsley and basil just before serving. And added the pasta to individual serving bowls rather than the entire pot of soup to prevent it from soaking up all of the liquid.     So simple and good. Our entire family enjoyed this, and I'll be making it again and again.

I really didn't care for this soup (and I'm a soup person). It needed vegetables: carrots, celery, zucchini. Way to salty. I could barely eat this it was sooo salty! The base (tomato sauce and water)-- definitely not the greatest taste.

This is a good, hearty soup, nice to have on a cold, rainy evening. I've heard of this soup for years, but I don't think I've ever made it. I'm not sure how authentic it is, and I don't know how it compares with other recipes for it, but I'll still give it 4 stars. I made it almost exactly as written; I used a medium-sized yellow onion, I didn't drain the cans of beans (since it didn't say to do so), and I used two 15-oz. cans of tomato sauce since I couldn't find a 29-oz. can. Despite the little bit of extra tomato sauce, and the liquid from the cans of beans, the soup wasn't watery in the least; it was pretty thick, with just enough broth to it. I just might make this again soon. (I usually read all prior reviews before posting mine, but I'll skip the 279 reviews here.)

Just made this right now and it is sooooo good! I used 4 cups chkn broth and 1.5 cups water, plus added one can diced tomatoes w/ jalapenos. And the tomato sauce I used was also a spicy sauce, so it gave it some perfect heat! And I only used 3/4 the amt. of pasta (macaroni is what i had). YUMMMM!!! I highly recommend this soup!

I really love soup and liked this recipe better than another pasta fagioli recipe I tried earlier this winter.  I added about a half pound of browned hamburger since my husband requires meat to be in his supper, and subsituted a can of chicken broth for 2 cups of the water.  I also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and one 14 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of only the tomato sauce the recipe calls for.  Served with cheesy garlic bread, it made a tasty supper!

Great soup! Made this last weekend for my bf and I. It was a very cold Chicago night... and this hit the spot :) I pretty much followed Andrea's directions to a T, but did make a few substitutions to suit our tastes. Instead of adding 1 (29 oz.) jar of tomato sauce, I used 1 (14.5 oz.) can of undrained Italian-seasoned diced tomatoes and an equivalent amount of Prego marinara sauce I had left-over from another recipe (I didn't want it to go bad...). I also subbed vegetable broth (wanted to keep this vegetarian, so no chicken for me/us) for the water called for. My final change was to use all cannellini beans as I could not find navy beans at my local grocery store. One thing to note: as other reviewer's have suggested, DO NOT USE A FULL LB. OF PASTA!!!! I used a little less than half of a 1 lb. box, and thought it was fine, but my left-overs were a bit too thick (the pasta swells once the soup sits in the fridge). When I reheated individual servings, I added a bit of left-over broth (just eyeball it) and all was fine. Served with a sprinkling of freshly grated Parm cheese (a must - in the soup and as a garnish) and Jo's Rosemary Bread (also on this site) that I made in my new bread machine. Yum-O! Thanks for sharing :)

Very tasty.  I followed other reviewers' advice ad subbed chicken broth for water, 15oz tomato sauce and 15oz diced tomatoes for the large can of tomato sauce, added 1/2 pkg frozen spinach and only used 1/2 lb ditalini pasta.  I would add it to the bowls next time as the noodles absorbed a lot of liquid.

YUM YUM YUM! This was delicious & so very easy to make. I couldn't find cannellonni beans, so I substituted northern beans & this soup was delicious. In fact, it made at least enough for several meals. I will make it again.

Last week I sent my husband to the store to get me 4 leeks which I needed for a recipe.  He brought home 4 POUNDS of leeks.  So since I had an overabundance of them, I used leeks instead of onions in this recipe.  I also added celery, carrots, zuccini, cut up green beans and spinach.  I squeezed the innards out of 1 large, fresh hot Italian sausage and browned it before I put in the vegetables; just for a bit of meaty flavor.  I threw in 1 Tablespoon of tomato paste to brown with the vegetables.  I used one 15 oz can of tomato sauce and one 15 oz can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes.  Instead of grated Parmesan, I put in a couple of pieces of Parmigiano Reggiano rind that I had hanging out in the freezer.  Oh, and I also threw in a bay leaf and fresh parsley instead of dry.  As per other reviewer's suggestions, I only used 1 1/2 cups of pasta, and I used whole wheat elbows (that's all I had).  This was scrumptious!  My husband added it to his list of my top 7 soups (which is now up to 10)  Thanks for the great recipe AVALERIO!!!

I only used 1/2 of the pasta (about 2C. dry)and I still  find that it's way too much pasta. Instead of the tomatoe sauce I used a can of stewed tomatoes and instead of water I used beef broth. Very good soup. THX  I

This is really good! I used one can cannellini beans and one can black eyed peas (because that's all I had). I also added a pinch of cinnamon to cut the acidity and bring out the sweetness a bit. Served it with whole wheat penne pasta, my boyfriend and 2 year old gobbled it up!

I rated the recipe as a 3 if you leave it as is. It could definitely be higher if you do some of these suggestions. First of all, I cooked it in the crock pot on low all day (without the pasta, cook that separately). I also added about 1 pound of ground beef. I found out that I am not personally a fan of ground beef in soup now, so I don't plan on doing it again. However, I will add Italian sausage next time. I substituted onion and garlic powders for onion and garlic since I didn't have the real thing. My husband only likes Northern beans, so I did not use the other beans. I also used beef bullion in the 5.5 cups of water. We also added a can of diced tomatoes. My husband wished we would have added carrots as well, which we didn't have. Also, I would add celery. Lastly, 2/3 cups of parmesan cheese fell into the crock pot instead :) Again, if you add some more veggies, I think it would improve the recipe to a 4+.

This was a very good recipe. I couldn't find canned navy beans, so I used great northern and I used a non dairy parm substitute. I used macaroni for the pasta and cooked it seperately, the added the pasta to each individual serving. Even though it good as is, I think next time I will add some veggies to it. Oh ya, I used 4 cups of veg broth and 1 cup of water.

This is a very good soup and easy to make. I cut
the amount of pasta to 1/2 lb. as other reviewers
suggested, but even that was too much, next time
I'll use 1/3 lb. I substituted veggie stock for the 
water and a 15 oz can of petite diced tomatoes and
15 oz. can of tomato sauce in place of the 29 oz.
can of tomato sauce. I also simmered it with the
lid on to keep it from getting too thick (which it
tends to do once you add the pasta). Served it with
a loaf of "Italian Herb Bread I" from this site, and
it was to die for! 5 stars and highly recommended!

This is a great macaroni and bean recipe.  I use 5.5 cups of chicken broth instead of water and italian stewed tomatoes instead of sauce (for texture) and it's delish!!  Thanks for sharing this!

Bland!!!  I followed the recipe exactly except I added some diced, cooked chicken so my husband would consider this "a meal".  The only reason I give this recipe two stars is because it was very simple and cheap to make.  But, it was sooooo bland.  This tasted like pasta in watery tomato sauce.  My husband said it was ok, but he wasn't crazy about it.  I didn't like it at all, but I like recipes with a lot of flavor.

delicious! i did make a few modifications: used chicken stock instead of water, doubled the garlic, used half the amount of pasta, added one chopped zucchini and a can of green beans. i also let the soup simmer for over 2 hours which really concentrated the flavors and caused it to thicken up nicely. my husband loved it too and we can't wait to eat leftovers tomorrow!!

I really liked this one.  I made the full recipe but took half of it to freeze before I added the pasta etc. It makes a ton and is very hearty. I left out the dried parsley but added 2 Tbs of fresh at the end.  I also waited until the end to add the cheese (half romano)and I added the pasta still a bit hard to soak up some of the sauce.  I also used vegetable stock in place of some of the water.  I also added some diced zucchini to get a green veggie in it.  I may try spinach like some other reviewers did in my remaining batch.  It sounds great.

Wow..this was good.  I did add a can of diced tomatoes, some frozen spinach and I added 2 chicken bouillion cubes to the water before hand.
This is a keeper and it was so inexpensive to make.  The pasta did expand and soak up most of the broth.  I actually like it like that but will just add a little bit more water when reheating.  Kept all the seasonings the same but did add some pepper.

This was just okay. I added a can of beef broth because it seemed too tomatoey to me and added less pasta because is seemed like it would be too thick with all the pasta. Not the worst thing I've ever made but certainly not the best.

This recipe was super easy to make!  The ingredients were inexpensive and it was very filling.  I didn't expect it to have too much flavor, but surprisingly it had a ton!!  There were a lot of leftovers which works out great for me.  I will make this again!

LOVE it!!!  This was the first time I made soup that wasn't out of a can.  This is such a versatile recipe and it saves well; I don't think I'll ever go back to canned soup!  I made the following modifications:
-Added 1 lb. browned sweet Italian turkey sausage
-Added 1 cup frozen chopped broccoli
-Added 1 tsp red pepper flakes
-Substituted 1 can of chicken broth in place of two cups water
-Substituted 1 can diced tomatoes (drained) and 1 can of tomato sauce
-Substituted brown rice macaroni pasta instead of ditalini (I like whole grain pasta and I couldn't find any whole wheat pasta appropriate for soup).

Healthy, versatile, easy, and delicious - can't ask for more than that! :)

This was fantastic. I used suggestions from others: chicken broth instead of water and half the pasta (which was more than enough. 
I added cooked ground turkey (seasoned with garlic) because my husband wanted some meat. I don't think it needed it, but it was really tasty. I will definitely be making this again!

I added a few chopped up links of mild Italian sausage.  We made this batch to take to play in the snow.  We fed ourselves and gave out quite a bit to other travelers.  We still had left-overs.  It tasted the same fresh and frozen.  Will make again.

After making several "blah" pasta fagioli recipes, this one is finally a really good one. I did add a 1/2 cup of chicken broth, 1 packet of powdered chicken buillon, pepper to taste and a little more parmesan cheese.  I put a cup of dittalini pasta in each bowl, opting not to add it to the pot, because I like mine soupy and not dry.  Thanks Andrea!

This is super easy to make and absolutely delicious. It works well to satisfy numerous different appetites - hungry men, vegetarians, children, etc. (my daughter sticks her fingertips in the ditalini & eats it that way). Serve with salad, crusty bread and, of course, red wine.

This was excellent.  After reading the reviews, I only added 1/2 a lb of the pasta, and I'm glad, because it really does absorb all the broth.  I also added ground Italian sausage to make it heartier for a main course.  The kids hated it (too bad!), but we thought it was outstanding, and it couldn't have been easier to make.

Yumm! Very good. I used other's advice and used way less pasta. I only cooked a few spoonfulls of pasta and then put it in the soup at the last minute when serving. I doubled both cans of beans and used the 29 oz. tomato sauce and a 29 oz. can of diced tomatoes. I also added 1 can of chicken broth.  I only needed about 1 cup of water. This was very tasty! Although it made way too much, I will half the whole recipe next time. Very good. Thanks.

Andrea, Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe. I definitely will make this again. Did follow some of the suggestions. added chicken broth instead of water and used Italian seasoning in place of the individual spices. I agree that 1# if pasta was a little too much.

Delicious soup! Although next time I make this I’m going to add only ½ - ¾ lb of pasta, simmer it covered, add an extra can of beans and sweet Italian sausage. My first attempt came out more like a pasta dish rather than a soup, sue to simmering uncovered and way too much pasta.

Wow, this was some of the best soup I have ever eaten.  I added a can of diced tomatoes and an additional can of cannellini beans.  Also I used 2 cups chicken broth and only 2 more cups of water, and left out the salt entirely (and it was perfect).  Also I used some whole grain Kamut spiral noodles since that's what I had, and only 1/2 lb.  YUM!!!  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

This soup was pretty good.  Next time I will definitely use half as much pasta, and probably an extra can of beans and a can of crushed/diced tomato.

This is one delicious soup!  The only change I made was using vegetable broth in place of the 5 1/2 cups plain water, just for extra flavor.  A hit with kids and adults.

I thought this was good. Nothing excellent, but good. The only changes I made was that I used proportionally more oregano than basil, added carrot, and used rotini pasta instead of ditalini. I think the Parmesan cheese really helps this recipe. However, it doesn't make good leftovers, as the noodles REALLY soak up the broth, and everything is a mushy mess, with the flavor seeming a little bit more bland. If you're looking to have leftovers with this soup, make sure you keep the noodles separate and ladel the soup over your portion, saving the rest of the noodles for later. However, I thought 1 lb. of pasta was the perfect amount.

Yum yum yum, a big hit with us!  I added quite a few veggies but even without them it would be great.  It seemed too simple to have much to offer but the end result is definitely greater than the sum of its parts.  I will serve this often as the cold season progresses!

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars!  It sure deserves it.  I've been looking for a great pasta fagioli soup recipe and I have finally found it.  I could not find navy beans at the store, so I used the cannelini beans only.  I do have to agree w/ other users...1/3 lb. pasta more than enough. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is sooo tasty!  I couldn't find cannellini beans, so I substituted with kidney beans--it came out great.  We liked the fact that the soup thickens and becomes very hearty after adding the pasta.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I added the pasta to individual servings and had left overs the same way.  This soup has a great flavor and very little effort.  No adjustments in seasoning are necessary.

Very good but mis-labeled as a soup.  I let this sit about an hour and a half and all the liquid was absorbed.  However, what was left was quite good!  I added a bit more seasonings and some crushed red pepper for a bit of kick.

One revision, in my optionion, would be to use less pasta and if letting this sit overnight make the pasta just before serving the following day. Not only was it too much pasta it absorbed soooo much liquid overnight that I had to add more water and other ingredients which watered down the originally great flavor.

I'm giving this recipe 2 stars because you can't put parmesan  cheese in a liquid because it will clump up. I knew this before I added it but decided to do it anyway to follow the recipe. You can garnish the soup with parmesan cheese when serving.

Not my taste. I thought it would be a good combination of soup, beans, and noodles. But it turned out totally different than the picture.

I make this recipe quite frequently. I made it once according to the recipe and have tweaked it to my families liking. I add white and red kidney beans or whatever I have on hand, fresh parsley, fresh spinach and some crushed red peppers for a little kick. To make it a heartier meal sometimes I serve it over tortellini.  It freezes great too.

This is what I want when I crave pasta fagioli. I subbed chicken broth for water and less pasta. Love that I can make it with pantry staples!  Will make this often! Thank you for sharing!

This was OK.  Problem number 1 was that it wasnt really soup...all the water was absorbed by the pasta.  The taste was mediocre...definitely edible but not great.  Better with lots of salt and extra parmesean.

I love this recipe. Made many tines, great flavor. I do use chkn broth in place of the water and this time I didn't have tomato juice so I used a can of plum tomatoes that I zipped in my food processor. Just as good.  I would also add the cheese at the very end.

This was very good!  Followed the recipe almost perfectly - except I did add some fresh baby spinach and a can of diced tomatoes.  Also some hot sauce and added the ditalini right to the soup for the last 20 min.  Only used half a pound - would be WAY too much if you add the whole pound.

Hubby's Italian grandmother took her recipe to the grave with her so have been trying to come close - this did (come close - not perfect but will keep working on it).

Putting this in my permanent recipe collection - thank you!!

This was very delicious, I used this recipe as a meatless Monday meal. I made the following changes. Instead of 5 cups of water I used 4 cups of veggie stock and 1 cup water, 1-14.5 oz can of tomato sauce, 1-14.5 oz can diced tomatoes and about a 1/4 cup diced carrots .. Served with side salad and sliced watermelon. Will make again

Great recipe, although as I was cooking it, I thought it tasted a little watery.  I added a can of tomato paste and it was just great.  I think next time I'll try some of the additions/substitutions the other reviewers mentioned--especially adding celery and using chicken broth instead of water (I already added carrots to mine--I use any way I can get my hubby and son to eat more veggies...).  Also, probably could have gotten by with 1/3-1/2# of pasta.  All in all, though, great recipe--exactly what I was hungry for!

This was a bit of a trainwreck. As written, I can imagine it would be pretty flavorless -- I used vegetable broth in place of water and it was still missing something. I even added extra onion, garlic, and some chopped carrots. Complaints about there not being enough water are totally accurate. The pasta, even when precooked, totally sponges up all the liquid.

This soup is wonderful!  My whole family loved the taste (including 3 kids!).  I've made it twice and planning #3 this week!  I know it's summer, but I pair it with a crispy green lettuce salad and a veggie sandwich on crusty bread...yum, yum!

This was really easy to make, with simple ingredients, and tasted great! I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used a 6 ounce can of tomato paste, 12 ounces of water, and a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes. I also used chicken broth instead of the 5 1/2 cups water to give it some more flavor. mmmm, it was sooo yummy and satisfying. My bf who complains whenever I make soup for dinner ate 3 bowls and said it was so good.  I cooked the pasta separately so it wouldn't absorb too much liquid and get mushy, and just added a scoop of pasta to a bowl and then the soup over it. Will make this again for sure!

This is a good soup! I only used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and added a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes undrained, used 2 cans of chicken broth instead of all water, only 1/2 tsp of salt and 8 oz of elbow macaroni. I also used great northern beans instead of navy because that's what I had and added parmesan to each bowl. It was perfect. Will definitely make again!

Pasta Fagioli  is wonderful recipe to make especially during Lent. 
Sometimes I would chop raw onions and add it to the top of the soup, which only enhances the flavors. 
I've been making this soup for over 60 years.
Don't forget the fresh Italian bread. 
This is a great recipe!
I wanted to add that sometimes I used ceci beans and a speck of ground hot pepper flakes.

Found Andrea's Pasta Fagioli recipe today.  I had most of the ingredients in my pantry so I decided to give it a try.  I only had (2) 8 oz. cans of tomato sauce so I pureed a 14 oz. can of stewed tomatoes and added both.  I added some celery, 1 Knorr chicken bouillon cube, skipped the basil since I didnt have any and used whole wheat elbow macaroni, and added a 6 oz. bag of fresh baby spinach.  Even with all of my changes WOW!!!! it is super good.  I LOVE soup so I plan to have this often.  Iv had this soup at Atlanta Bread Company and liked it but I have to say this version is so much better.

This soup was very good, I made it as posted the first time and thought that something was missing.  The second time I made it, I sauted some pancetta in the pan first then followed the recipe as is except I split the water and 3 cups water and 2 cups chicken broth.  This is a keeper for me.

Great recipe!  I did follow some suggestions of other users.  I used some chicken stock instead of water.  I also used 1 15 oz can of diced tomatoes and 15 oz can of tomato sauce.  I did find that most of the liquid was absorbed with the full pound of pasta.  Next time I will be cutting the amount of pasta down

I had to change the recipe a little, because it turned out that I didn't have all the ingredients.  So I used Light red kidney beans, 1 can is all I had for beans, and I had to put spaghetti sauce and diced tomatoes in instead  of tomato sauce.  I also had to use regular egg noodles.  Haven't tried it yet, but it smells good.

This is a great tasting Pasta Fagioli as is except one thing.  Double everything except the beans and pasta.  Makes more and freezes just fine for the fall or winter months.

Close to my own recipe. I replaced broth for the water & just use cannelini beans. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Really good soup. I replaced half the water with beef broth and used black beans (all I had). I put the pasta in the soup about 15 minutes before serving. No need to dirty another pan. Next time I don't think I will add all the pasta.

This was delicious. I didn't change much. I added a pound of ground beef and used chicken stock instead of water. With the pasta, I boiled it till it was al dente, and then threw it in a saucepan with everything else to let it simmer until everybody was ready for dinner. Would definitely make again.

This one made me feel like a kid again.  I followed the recipe exactly and what you see is what I got, a stock pot full of Spaghetti-O’s.  My husband tried a bowl and his first comment was, “you forgot to add the weenies.”  lol!  Since this wasn't the "soup" I was hoping for, I think I will search for a different Fagioli recipe rather than make a bunch of changes to this one.

Delicious! I didn't use navy beans just 1 can of cannellini, omitted the salt & used chicken broth instead of water. I also cut the pasta down to a half pound, I think 1 pound would be too much.

This was SO good.  Very easy to make.  I used a bit less liquid because my family likes a thicker soup and it was absolutely one of the best soups I have ever eaten.  I will be making this the rest of the winter!

Like others, I think I will halve the pasta next time ... but otherwise, would not change a thing.  My whole family devoured this and asked for more.  The pasta did absorb *all* the broth overnight, so the leftovers were more of a goulash, which was also a hit with my teenager.  Great recipe!

Followed the advice of other reviews, and used a can of diced tomatoes, and added less pasta.  It was very good, and even better the next two days!

Followed receipe exactly.  It came out as a mostly pasta dish with a little bit of sauce/liquid.  Next time I will only use 1 c. of the pasta and add it to the soup AFTER it has simmered for 1 hour.  That way the pasta will not absorb all the liquid.  It was also very bland tasting.  I think I'm going to add a can of diced tomatoes and use chicken broth instead of plain water.

Great!  Definitely add cannelini beans, and I also added green and yellow long neck squash.  The pasta should be added to each individual serving...it soaks up all the broth when it sits in it for a while (especially when storing overnight or freezing---store noodles and soup separately!)

Great recipe! I altered it a bit but generally followed the directions. I don't like onion pieces, so I roasted it then blended it and added it to the soup.   I also followed a lot of Serena's notes. I used mini fusilli, 3 c vegetable broth & 2 c water, and one 15 oz can diced tomatoes + one 15 oz can tomato sauce. Also used 1/2 c freshly grated Parmesan - the extra cheese really makes a wonderful difference! I couldn't find navy beans, so I used chickpeas. I also like a bit of heat, so I put in a lot of red pepper flakes. I didn't add salt since I used broth. Oh my goodness, it was so delicious. :) Make it, you won't regret it!

This soup was awesome!!!  My husband turned his nose up to it when I told him what we were having for dinner, but polished off two healthy servings!!  I made a few changes based on other reviews.  I used chicken broth instead of water.  I only used half of the pasta.  I used the juice from a can of whole tomatoes because my husband is not a huge fan of a powerful tomato flavor.  I added sliced carrots and chopped spinach.  Great recipe.

I followed the recipe (for the most part) and this came out great.  I used 1-2 cups of chicken stock and 3-4 cups of water instead of just water, and I believe that added a great depth of flavor.  I used the recommended pasta; however, I just cooked the pasta in the pot with all the other ingredients (20 or so minutes from the end of cooking, place pasta in the pot to cook).  It turned out GREAT!  Just like my grandma and mother made.  I love the texture and the flavor of this Italian dish!!!

Very tasty and very little prep work required! I did make some adjustments. I used multigrain rotini and 2 cans of diced tomatoes in place of tomato sauce. I also used chicken broth in place of water but I noticed that a few people had said it came out too salty so I used the reduced sodium version. I omitted the salt completely and made sure to drain my beans. I kept the pasta separate from the soup as well. I simmered uncovered and the consistency seemed perfect to me, not too thick at all.

Great soup - very thick.  I added an extra can of beans - should have probably kept the liquid instead of draining them.  And probably could have done 1/2 of the pasta.  I added chopped bacon.  I'm freezing leftovers - we'll see how it warms up!

This is a good base recipe.  Next time I will add more Parmesan cheese and perhaps seasoned ground beef/turkey.  I will also cook the noodles a little shy of al dente since they continue to cook once added to the hot soup.

This is delicious.  I normally make "pasta fazool" (as my family calls it) with great northern beans, but the mix of navy and cannellini is absolutely delish.  I am looking forward to my garden this year, because I'd love to make this with fresh oregano, parsley and basil.  Thanks so much for the recipe - this is my new fazool!  LOL

A tasty and easy to prepare country peasant soup. I added chopped tomatoes and think 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 can of chopped tomatoes would add that extra texture. I also thought I'd add sauteed zucchini or spinach to increase the vegetable power next time.

I made my own changes, but overall, this is GREAT!!! I added 1/4 chicken bouillon instead of the full cube because this was just a meal for 2. I didn't know this, but CANNELLINI beans are WHITE KIDNEY BEANS & CHICK PEAS are GARBANZO beans. I didn't mind the Ditalini pasta, the brand used was Barilla, cook it for 7 minutes.  Yum, yum, yummy, yum! Thanks to everyone with their reviews. It helped me before I started mine.

This is a great recipe! I added a pound of ground beef and browned with the onion and garlic. Used two cans of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic...two cans of mixed beans. Used mini pasta and like another user, I cooked pasta separately, rinsed in cold water and added the last 10 min. Great recipe!!!!

This was ok, but I much prefer the recipe found on Olive Garden's web site. We love their soups and when I have made it I have gotten rave reviews.

I thought this was excellent. I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I think I will decrease the pasta and increase the beans.

I made a few changes, based on what I had in my pantry.  Chicken broth for the water, added carrots, and used mini elbow macaroni.  Advice for people who think it is too soupy:  drain the beans (this also reduces the sodium), use pasta sauce instead of canned tomatoes (but if you use canned tomatoes, drain them), or decrease the water.  Enjoy!

This recipe is super simple and great as is but I usually make a few changes.  I saute some celery and carrots along with the onions/garlic.  I also added some diced tomatoes and a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce.  I used kidney beans instead of black beans and used 4 cups of vegetable broth with a couple cups of water.  Right at the end of cooking I add some fresh spinach.  It makes a delicious easy pot of Veggie Soup that is really filling because of the beans.

Good, but not as good as Nona use to make! Then again, nothing ever could be. I added a can of diced tomatoes at the end for color. Healthy, easy, frugal, vegetarian, and the family liked it.

Excellent and hearty recipe. The mix of grains and legumes is hearty to make it a complete meal when accompanied with salad and bread. Next time I will double the recipe, so I can freeze some for later!

I made it today for a soup sampler I'm particitating in tomorrow so I doubled it. I used the italian spices seasoning that I had in bulk to the nearest rounded tablespoon (or 2) and extra garlic.. I ran the elbow pasta in cold water but it still soaked up most of the broth (I didnt double the noodles just the spices and broth) It didnt have enough tomato-y taste so I used up the leftover can of low sodium v8 I had in the fridge.. I also added some red pepper flakes and gonna add crushed tomatoes for more texture.. my family liked it so I will have to see how it goes tomorrow.. thanks!

This is a pretty good recipe.  With some extra cheese thrown in, the broth had a fantastic taste.  The navy beans didn't do much for me; in these future I will leave them out and double the cannelini beans.  I may also try to throw in some celery and carrots next time.  Exceedingly easy to make and a nice, hearty cold weather meal.  Good with a mild red wine.

Fabulous!!  I used 1/2 lb elbow pasta and am glad I did that because 1 lb would be too much.  I also cut off a piece parmesan rind and boiled it with the soup.  I did not boil the grated cheese with the soup, but rather added it last after turning off the burner.

This was even better than I expected it to be.  The flavors blended fabulously and was a hit with all.  I loved that it went together so easily.  I added the pasta separately, so it didn't "plump up".  That way, the leftovers will be equally delicious!

This was good. It makes a huge pot! 1 lb. of pasta might be a bit much. I ended up adding 2 fresh tomato and zucchini towards the end. It just seemed it needed more than just the beans. I also had to add chicken stock granules for added flavor. Next time ( if there is a next time) i will cut the recipe in half.

This was just as good as my mom's....I did make just minor adjustments.  I split the water mixture with half water and half beef stock.  And also, because I prefer it thicker, I added a mixture of flour/water just to give it a bit of texture.  With a little garlic bread and a nice glass of wine....fabulous.  Bringing leftovers to work.  Thank you

This was a really good recipe. I made this when my mom was visiting, as I wanted to impress her by making something she wasn't already famous for! :)

Prepared axactly as the recipe indicated, this was delicious. Even thought I was critical on myself, thinking I should have added more salt or this spice or that spice, but my mom assured me it was deliciuous. If it wasn't, she WOULD HAVE told me. She never holds back the criticism, God love her! 

I printed this recipe and put it in my recipe box to be made again.. and again... and again.. :)

This was great, but I made some changes based on other's reviews.  I used beef broth instead of water, added diced tomatoes and about 1 lb. ground beef.  I added all ingredients except the noodles in the crock pot and cooked on low 6 hrs.  I then added about 1/2 of the box of the cooked pasta about 40 minutes before serving, letting the pasta absorb some of the flavor.  Delicious!  Will definitely make again.

Great as a side dish or a vegetarian main dish, this also tastes good cold for lunch the next day. I like to serve it with chicken breasts. Sometimes I have used canned tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, or used all cannelli beans (they are also called navy beans I think)  and there's no real difference.

I substituted 2 c chicken broth for the water.  I used small red beans rather than white.  I made tubettini and cooked it separtely, but undercooked it and added it after the soup was done. This eliminated the pasta puffiness and liquid absorption.  In 1/2 batch I added cooked italian sausage (sweet w/fennel) for my husband (cooked in red wine and sliced in bitsize pieces).  It was easy and tasty and I don't think you could ruin this recipe if you added your own italian flair.

Fabulous!  I don't add quite as many noodle as the recipe calls for.  I add another can of beans.  I also love it with some chopped spinach thrown in.  You can't taste the spinach as it absorbs all the other flavors and it adds wonderful color.

I doubled the garlic, added some veggies, and halved the pasta (with the full amount, it would have been WAY too pasta-ey). The added veggies made it a lot better too. Also, I like how much herbs are in it - it gives it more flavor. Overall, this was pretty good, but there are a lot of better soups out there and I probably won't be making it again.

This is the best recipe - and really easy on those cold/rainy days. My husband (Italian) says it tastes just like his grandmother's. Served best in our house with a loft of dipping bread (for oil/vinegar... and the soup!).

I thought this was a bit bland. It might have been better if the water was replaced with more tomato sauce and more seasoning. My kids did like the beans-pasta combination though.

What a wonderfully easy and healthy recipe.  I was looking for a quick soup for last night and this did it.  While it has to simmer for a while, the prep time is very quick.  We left out the pasta because i didn't think it was needed.  We had fancy grilled cheese sandwiches with fontina, tomato and green onion on a hearty asiago bread along with the soup.  Great dinner!  Thanks for the recipe!

We had never eaten this dish before.  After reading reviews, I made a few subs.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  Instead of 29oz tomato sauce, I used 15oz tomato sauce & 15oz diced tomatoes, replaced 3 herbs with Italian seasoning, used canellini and chick peas(what I had on hand), and 1/2 lb ditalini.  It is delicious and I made it again the following week.  Recipe is in the box.   5 stars for the end result and thanks for sharing.

This is a keeper.  Like many other readers I used one can of tomatoes and 1 can of tomato sauce.  Also substituted 1 can of chicken broth for part of the water.  I don't think some people realize that original pasta fagioli is basically beans (type varies) and pasta, usually tubular, with small amount of tomato sauce.

Thanks, Andrea. Loved this.

Very yummy!  The only problem is that the amount of pasta  is about twice as much as you need.

If Hubby says, "Make this again!" after just one bite, it gets 5 stars! I made two slight changes to the recipe. First, I used replaced 2 1/2 cups of water with beef stock because I had it in the fridge. Second, I replaced the herbs with Italian seasoning. I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and cut back the pasta. The photo I submitted was taken after the soup had been sitting and the pasta absorbed the broth. Yummy!

As others stated-easily adaptable recipe. I didn't realize that I didn't have any tomato sause when I was making this, so I substituted a 26 oz can of Hunt's Zesty & Spicy Spaghetti Sauce and 3 oz of water (to rinse the can out!) to make the 29 oz called for in the original recipe. Used 1/2 c parmesan because I thought it was the 1/3 c! Makes a lot to freeze. It's very filling so all we need is a tossed salad or antipasto and that's supper!

Great base to build on, made the following changes/additions:  1 diced zuchini, 2 cans diced tomatoes, used tomato paste instead of sauce and chicken broth instead of water. After simmering for 3 hrs, added 2 diced baked chicken breast.  Served over pasta (didn't pre-mix it) and then put the parm on top. Wonderful "homey" meal. Made a large amount...great to put in freezer (w/o the pasta or chicken).

This is a great soup!  I added Italian Sausage (mild) and a little more parmesan to the soup.  My husband loved it!  It's a very "homey" kind of soup for cold days.

This recipe got rave reviews from the whole family.  I made a few adjustments based on some other reviews/recipes.  I added somed diced smoked ham while I was sauteing the onion and garlic.  Based on another reviewer, I also used a jar of spagetti sauce and used beef broth instead of the tomato sauce and water.  I also added some fresh chopped spinach.  I served it along with some fresh baked Italian french bread......Oh, so yummy.  Even better the next day!

I was searching for a true pasta fagioli and this is it, Most other recipes has some type of meat added. This was a peasant soup ( tomato's beans and pasta were cheap) and meats were and not part of this originally.  Now this soup is very flavorful. I only cooked two cups of dry dilatini very al dente then added it to the soup. I 1 lb would have been to much for me. I also would not serve it right away, its one of those thing that is better after it cools and is reheated. I also would add one chopped  carrot when cooking the onion next time.

This turned out really good.  I will probably add green beans when I make it again.  I also do recommend cutting the pasta by at least 1/3.  My husband loved this and ate leftovers for 3 days.

I thought this was a great soup. However, I made mine in the crockpot and let it simmer on high for 1 hour. I then set it on warm so we could eat it whenever we wanted to. I put the noodles in after I switched it to warm. It didn't seem like there were too many noodles, but after about an hour or so, they expanded and absorbed nearly all the liquid. So next time, I will not add the noodles until I plan to eat it, and will probably only use 1/2 lb as others suggested.

Very easy to make. I did modify the recipe to make it a little more hearty. I switched out the water with chicken broth, also used a jar of spaghetti sauce. Added extra vegetables like squash, matchstick carrots, a can of mixed vegetables. I also changed the can of cannellini beans with kidney beans. Everything else I left the same. Very good,everybody had seconds and ate hardly any of the salad I made to go with it. Thanks for sharing

This recipe was okay, but I'm not sure if I'd make it again. It smelled really good while simmering on the stove but left a bad aftertaste in my mouth after dinner, and I doubt the leftovers will get eaten.

We really liked this.  I didn't feel like it was too much pasta--we used radiatore, because that's what we had and it soaked up the sauce deliciously.  I also ended up using a bit of crushed red pepper on mine at the table, and that was really good.  I have always had very plain pasta e fagioli, and this was different and delicious.  Thanks!

This recipe is great because you can stick to it or add your own variations to fit your family.  I added ground sausage as well as veggie and beef broth instead of water.  I used salad macaroni pasta, and it really absorbed the broth, which we liked. I used 16 oz of pasta.  It really makes a hardy meal that is easy with next to no clean up.  Plus it's pretty cheap to make, which is always worth a few stars.

This recipe is a great starter recipe!  I've used it numerous times and each time add more and more veggies.  Add anything that it's your fridge.  It'll be great!  I also cook the noodle seperately and keep them apart until I plate the soup.  I like the pasta al dente. Enjoy!

This is one of my familys favorite soups, my grown sons #1 favorite.  I only change one thing, I throw in a small can of Diced fire roasted organic tomatoes. I cook the pasta seperatly and add to the soup when serving it.  
The taste of this soup is so good... I make it pretty frequently during the winter months.. YUM!

Amazing recipe! I have made this twice. Once following recipe exactly for the soup and again tonight. This time i left out the water and added a can of zucchini in tomato sauce and fresh rooms and served it over pasta. Both ways it is wonderful. There is alot you can do with this recipe. We truely enjoyed it. Hubby even asked to take leftovers in his luch for next day. Cut recipe in half for 2 as it makes alot.

This was delicious and super easy.  I made a few adjustments to what I had in the pantry.  I used a can red kidney and a can of black beans instead the cannolini and navy beans.  I also used two 8oz can of tomato sauce and one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with herb.  I also used half the pasta and added a little more dried herbs.  An extra onion is a definite must for those who love onions.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good recipe! I used chicken broth instead of water and about 1/2 lb of pasta.  Also, I do not simmer the parmesan cheese in the soup as the recipe calls for.  I mix it in at the end right before I serve it (and add some to the top since my family loves cheese!).  I have actually made this for awhile just now got around to rating it. This is a keeper!

Excellent recipe. I made it in the crock pot early in the morning and let it cook all day. Hubby brought home med. spicy sausage and grilled it. I added celery, corn, and carrots a little late in the day so they were crunchy for dinner. So, I left it in the crock pot that night on low and in the morning it was delicious. It made  a ton I even gave some to a pregnant friend who has two little ones at home. We had it for dinner tonight and it was even better after all the flavors blended. Yummy!

This receipe is absolutely delicious.  It is one I make all the time and it's even easy enough for my husband to make.  I did make a few changes though to make it even better. 1)Use fresh herbs 2)Use 2 cans of stewed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce (as suggested by others) 3) Filled my soup pot to the top with water and added boullion (does not have enough water otherwise)  4)Cut the amout of pasta in half 5)Add about 1/2 lb of ground hamburger (cooked) 6) Cut the onions smaller (not a big fan)

Fabulous!  I substituted chicken broth for water, as well.  The spices were perfect.  I grated some extra parmesan on top and served with some dinner rolls.  Sooo good!

My six year old kept telling me how good this soup was! The whole family agreed. I did heed the advice of previous reviewers and use chix stock instead of water, added a carrot and  also used fresh herbs instead of dried. Did not have V8 on hand and would really have liked to try the recipe using it. I will make this soup again!

Delicioso!It's so cold and I wanted to serve something that sticks to your ribs for company. This was perfect. Will be sure to make again soon and may add only 1/2 lb pasta. The full pound absorbs all the liquid by the time seconds were served.

This is a very easy and delicious recipe.  I think the only thing I'll do differently next time is to only add the pasta to the soup each time it's served, otherwise the pasta seems to soak up the broth and gets kind of mushy after being refrigerated, etc.  Also maybe I'll try to use less tomato sauce and maybe add some chicken broth too.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Very simple and yummy. I used one large can (29 oz) diced tomato and one small can of tomato sauce as that is what was on hand. Added a can of chicken broth to make up the required liquid. I cooked the noodles separately as others suggested. Will definitely make again!

I thought this was very good, and certainly easy to make.  I served it with homemade breadsticks for a light meal.  My husband felt that it needed more substance (but that is probably just because it didn't have meat), but I thought it was fine.  I did think the beans to noodles ratio was uneven.  I would add another cna of beans - maybe some black beans.

I can't really rate this recipe because I changed it some...
I used 2 stalks of celery diced instead of onion.  I doubled the garlic. I used 1 can of red kidney beans instead of navy beans. Next time I'll add a 3rd can of kidney beans. I added 1 beef boullion cube. I used 3/4 lb. baby-shell pasta instead of ditalini. I also added 3 large cooked and chopped spicy italian sausages. I held the parmesan as a garnish.
Thanks so much, Andrea, for the great foundation of a fabulous soup!  I'll make this again and again!

Very simple and the end result is much better than I expected it to be from the simple ingredients. Added a splash of tobasco for extra pep and had to keep adding water so it didn't dry out. Excellent as a hearty soup on day 1 and then when warmed up the next day as a thick flavoursome pasta and sauce dish. will defo make again

Wanted to rate this again.  I doubled the recipe and made this Sunday.  Everyone raved about it.  I used chicken broth instead of water, baby shells in place of 
ditalini.  I also added 2 more cans of cannelinni beans for the doubled recipe.
I gave a container to each of my brother's families.  They loved it.  This is an outstanding dish.  I will be making this at least once a month.  Great comfort food.  Thank you Andrea for posting this winner.

I don't eat cheese, so I left the Parmasean out of this recipe.  I also added some red pepper flakes, some peas and corn, and used about 1/3 of the pasta that the recipe called for.  We all enjoyed it tonight--there was plenty of pasta, so I don't know how thick the soup will be tomorrow.  I'll eat it either way.

This soup is excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I think one pound of pasta is way too much though. I think 1/2 pound would be enough.  If you like a lot of pasta, add the pound because it still tastes delicious. My family enjoyed it !!!

Delicious, hearty, warm, filling, a full meal.  The pasta does suck up a lot of the broth by next day, it looks more like stew than the soup it did on the day before.  I suggest leaving the pasta aside and adding to soup seperately.

Very good and satisying soup!

I used a little over half the pasta, and it was by far enough. I may even wish that I had used less come tomorrow, as the pasta is sure to absorb the little broth overnight.

Either way, the pasta and beans together were very delicious, and a good source of protein for myself and other vegetarians!

Oh yeah, and great with french bread!

Thanks Andrea!!

We love this recipe - it's great with fresh, hot italian bread on a cold evening.  Sometimes I'll add a 15oz can of diced tomatoes that are already seasoned with basil, garlic and orgeano.  It's really good enough that you could even go without the pasta if you're really watching carbs.

I used chicken broth instead of water, reduced the tomato sauce to 16 oz., & reduced the amount of parsley, basil & oregano due to family preference.  I served the pasta separately to be added to the soup at the table  That way, if there were leftovers, the pasta wouldn't get mushy when reheated in the soup.

I tried this with spagetti sauce and my hubby did not care for it.  You must cut down on the pasta or it is TOO MUCH!!! Definately do not cook the pasta with the beans or they turn to mush.

The flavor is great but pasta soaked up all the soup.  I would recommend doubling the soup ingredients/spices and only using a third of the pasta since the pasta is like a sponge.  Turned out great when I did this alteration.

It was great!!! I did a few changes but not many. I added zucchini because it looked like they had it in the picture. And my family LOVES spice so I added some cayenne pepper. Other than that, I followed the instructions exactly. Next time if I want some meat, I may add some spicy sausage and squash would go good as well. It was a great meal!!!

I was excited by all the rave reviews, but this tasted like canned minestrone to me. Too much oregano maybe? I should have watched more closely when Nana used to make it.

Very very good. Used crushed tomatoes and added a ham bone as wanted to use up. Delicious  and have no  doubt would be just as good without the meat flavor. Will definitely make again soon!

This was excellent dinner on a cloudy , wintery day. I added the zucchini, some bacon bits 1/4 c and used just 2 cans of cannellini beans which I had on hand. It was nourishing and filling with the beans and veges.  Yummy.

Looked good in photo, even better when cooked, had lots of flavor. I substituted about 1/2  chicken broth for water and used rosemary instead of parsley as that's what I had on hand. Will definitely do this one again. 

next time I will try less pasta and more beans, and maybe add some sausage of some sort.

The taste was excellent. Following the recipe, I didn't have enough liquid to really qualify as soup, and the beans disappeared (dissolved?) during the simmering. Because it was so tasty and easy, I'll make it again, adding more liquid, adding the beans in the last 15 minutes, and using much less pasta (it also seemed to absorb a lot of liquid -- even though it was fully cooked separately.

It is very tasty. I would give it 10 stars for flavor, but 4 stars because the amount of pasta is too much, and I love pasta!
I used stewed tomatoes, instead of the tomato sauce.  I would cut down on the amount of pasta next time or keep it separate from the soup. The bottom line is this is a taste and easy soup for a chilly day.

I will make it again!

I liked it but way too much pasta. I should have read other reviews before making it. I will make this recipe again as I loved the broth but will greatly reduce the amount of pasta.

I used the basic recipe, fabulous flavors. I agree with others to cook the pasta separate & add to the soup as you dish it. The pasta got mushy but tasted wonderful.

As is the case, everyone seems to deviate a bit from the recipe, I am no different. I added a little extra parmesan cheese since my family adores this cheese. Other than that I found this to be a very tasty and hearty soup, thank you for the recipe!

My wife is a fan of this soup and this was my first attempt at it. She applauded the recipe and my skills (yeah right LOL) and said it was as good as any she has had. I call that a win.

ME - brothy soup lover, HUBS - (meat/potatoes guy)not so much, but he'll try anything without any heat/spice. Made this last night using tomato sauce from garden, used 1/2 of the beans, cut back on the herbs, kept the rest as written and if I can still rate it after changes, give it an "OK". Like some other reviews, I felt there was too much pasta so I will make it again and add 1-2 cups of chicken broth. Flavor was mild, perfect for him and I liked it enough to try again with some revision. Good base recipe though!

I didn’t make any changes as this was the first time I made it.  In the future, I will either use less pasta or put the pasta in a bowl and add the soup to it .  By adding the pasta to the pot, the pasta soaked up all the liquid in a short period of time.  The flavor of the soup was very good so I will make it again.

I made this last night and it was AWESOME. Restaurant-quality. I went with 4 cups of chicken stock and 1.5 cups of water instead of 5.5 cups of water. I would also recommend a third can of beans, and I probably should have chopped down the onions more. Maybe just slightly less than a full pound of pasta? But all in all an EXCELLENT, restaurant-quality pasta fagiola. I was VERY happy.

Very easy to follow recipe. I may have used too much pasta but I like how it turned out. I followed another review by adding pasta during the last 20 minutes. Instead of dried basil I used fresh basil and doubled the Parmesan cheese.  I also used chicken
Broth (32ounces) and water to make the 5 1/2 cups of liquid that the recipe called for.

I changed everything about this recipe except Cannolini beans because I only used what I had on hand. I used crushed tomatoes instead of sauce and I used basil, garlic salt and Italian seasoning and added another clove of garlic because it's what i had on hand. 
Because my husband is a big meat eater I added sweet Italian sausage and topped with freshly chopped spinach. Sprinkled with parmesan cheese.

Good recipe, as I don't have access to canned beans or tomato sauce I pressure cooked some white beans and purred some tomatoes, used the water from the pressure canned beans and got to the total of 9 1/2 cups.  Followed the recipe from that point except only used 1/2 pound of noodles at the recommendation of other readers.  Thanks will be going into the rotation.

I made it...and added celery, carrots, onion, green pepper...AND...squeezed out the meat from several mild Italian sausages which I cooked separately with the onion and green pepper and added.   Perfect for me.

My boyfriend and his brother are both Sicilian, and request this monthly as a lunch option to take to work! I'll make a huge batch, and divide it out for them. It's especially popular in the winter months, as a warm treat in the construction world.

Tasted exactly like my mom and grandmother's.  The way pasta fagioli should taste.  No meat.  Just a saucy, hearty dish of pasta and beans.

Followed he recipe but used chicken broth instead of water.  Tasted great!  My only recommendation would be to cut back on the pasta to 1/2 - 3/4 pound. Even when you cook it al dante, it still soaks up the broth. I ended up making more of the soup base and adding it in.

This is a good recipe, however,  I would not use the full pound of pasta.  I cooked the pasta as directed and decided to only add half.  I put the top on the pan and it set for a few minutes and the pasta swelled up turning soup into a pasta dish with a thin tomato juice.  I grabbed some vegetables broth and added it to get it back to ‘soup’.  After eating some, I had to throw half of it away because I didn’t have containers to store it, the volume was so large.  Next time I will add a scoop of cooked pasta to the soup before eating it and keep it separate.

Turned out really really good. Changes I made... I added more veggies. Carrots, turnip, rutabag. I used tomoto juice instead of tomato sauce. This is a personal preference that I always change when a recipe calls for tomato sauce or paste. I also omitted the salt. Will definately make again.

I have made this a couple of times and it is just simply the comfort food you need after a day of work. This last time, I used what was in the fridge...leeks for the onions and almost a cup of tomato paste ( left over from something I only needed a tablespoon of to begin with ) in place of the tomato sauce. I just added water/veg broth as needed.  I also had to sub pinto and chickpeas for the beans and only had bow tie pasta. We are not big pasta eaters, so I cut  the amount WAY back.  Essentially the original concept  as well as yummy for the tummy ! Thank you for sharing!

Delicious!  Put everything except pasta &  oil (didn't sauté anything) in the crock pot & let it simmer all day.  Used 1/2 cup grated parmesan , 5 cup chicken broth, 1/2 cup H2O.  Added about 3/4 cup frozen chopped spinach, and cooked pasta & added to individual bowls.  Wonderful flavor & very healthy...really enjoyed it with Jo's Rosemary Bread from this site!

This was an excellent recipe. My wife thought it would taste like minestrone soup and didn't want it, but she really liked it. I took the advice of others and cooked the pasta separately and added it at the end. One thing I would do differently is to add the parmesan towards the end instead of at the start. It all sank to the bottom and stuck to the bottom of the pan. Scraping it got the parmesan somewhat mixed in, but it still clumped up.

I think this soup has as many regional variations in the US as I'm assuming it likely has in Italy.  I'm in northern NJ and can say it's almost what I'm used to getting from any one of hundreds of decent italian restaurants in this area.  It's missing the meatiness (obviously) that you get from a ham hock or a little diced pancetta.  And the texture was off, but I corrected that by removing about four ladles of the soup, blending it smooth with an immersion blender, and then adding it back into the rest of the soup.  Other than that I just reduced the amount of pasta to half a pound--there is plenty of pasta on each spoonful, so I can't imagine what it would be with a full pound.  And it needed salt--lots of it (but I also used a no-salt added Tutteroso tomato sauce)

My husband is half Italian, but he said this was something his 100% Italian grandmother made often on Sunday. So this recipe was a good one. The only thing I substitute it was tomato sauce for real Italian gravy and I also added garbanzo beans because I didn't have navy beans. Oh, and I'm pregnant and a little anemic so I threw in some baby spinach in my bowl. A good loaf of bread and your good to go.

I made this amazing soup a few days ago, and my husband loved it.  I made it with the chicken stock, I also added a pinch of thyme and a pinch of fennel. I used more chicken stock than the recipe called for to keep it from thickening too much. 
The recipe was great, thanks for sharing.

This has become my favorite soup and what's great is that it's cheap to make and healthy for you. I've made this recipe 5 times in the past month (I'm obsessed) each time a tad bit differently using different broths. I think red wine is key to making this soup the most rich and flavor full. Use 1 cup red wine (I prefer Merlot) & 4 cups water. I also reduced the oregano to 1 tsp since I thought 1 1/2 was excessive after tasting my first batch. Add some crushed red pepper for a little spice. You only need a cup of dry pasta (I use macaroni). Additionally I like an extra can of beans and fresh spinach if I have any. You can also sub Romano for Parmesan which I prefer now. 

If you change anything in this recipe add the cup of red wine! So much more depth of flavor! If you don't change a thing in this recipe it is still a great soup.

This was a good start. I used seasoned salt rather than regular salt, and like the others, used extra cheese and cut down on the amount of pasta.

I am no Italian cooking expect, but 1 POUND of pasta sounds like a LOT. It would have turned this into a heavy stew.
So I cut the amount of pasta to 1/4 of pound and used chicken broth for the water. Other than these changes, I kept every else the same and that made a nice, hearty soup.

Excellent recipe! Exactly what I was looking for. My only change was, I did half half diced tomatoes and sauce. Don't undercook this. After the whole hour the soup really comes together. Thank you for the recipe. We truly enjoyed it!

I loved it. The only thing that I did different was that I added a few handfuls of spinach. I think I made a mistake of adding to much pasta because it soaked up all the broth and it started to look more like pasta instead of soup. But that was my bad! Great soup!

Thought it was good. However I added canned tomatoes and carrots that I've seen in other similar recipes. I don't feel it changed the original recipe just added more nutrient vegetables. When it was all said and done and ready to eat, I think it needed a pinch of salt. I will make again in the future.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. We did enjoy it. I have never made pasta fagioli before, so didn't know how it should come out. It was soupy when first finished. Then when set to cool, it became thicker, guess the noodles absorbed the juices. Not a bad thing, I will maybe add less of the noodles from 1 lb. to 1/2 lb. I did follow to the tee, and did put this recipe into my make again file. Thank you!

This was a very easy recipe to make a big pot of pasta.  I did use fresh herbs instead of dried (used just a little bit more) and substituted half the water with chicken broth.  I served it with a side of cabana bread which went over really well with the family.  I was also surprised how well it warmed up the next day for lunch :)  I will be making this again!

Not flavorful enough.  Add chili powder. Increase all seasonings especially garlic. Add celery salt. 1/2 amount of pasta and increase veggies and beans

What went wrong? Is there a typo with cooking one pound of ditalini pasta? I made this recipe without any variation. I cooked 1 pound of pasta and then added it to the soup - but this was way too much pasta in the pan-furthermore the pasta absorbed all of the remaining liquid in the pot. Instead of serving soup my family complemented me on a tasty casserole dish;-)

I would have given this 5 stars, because alone it is pretty darn tasty... BUT: I increased the amount of liquid x2 and its still not soup-y with a full pound of pasta. My suggestion is to cut down on the amount of pasta.

Thank you for submitting your recipe.  I really liked it.  Followed recipe "almost" exactly.  Changes I made:  Used "Italian" canned tomatoes, added fresh zucchini (chopped), and substituted fresh spinach instead of canned (added just before serving).  Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Very good. I added 1/2 the amount of pasta as other reviewers requested. And because of my meat-living sweetheart I added sliced Kielbasa and fresh spinach.

Great recipe by itself, but I made the following adjustments. I used vegetable broth instead of water, added a 1/2 cup of red wine, added chopped zucchini, carrots and baby spinach. Substituted garbanzo beans for navy beans and increased the grated cheese by 1/4 cup. I also used fresh herbs instead of dried and  added whole wheat penne (1/2 the amount) and 1 additional cup of water to allow to cook in the soup itself right before serving. Even the vegetarian in the house was pleased with the results.

This is absolutely one amazing recipe that my children beg for as soon as the weather starts to cool down. I do however make a few changes that do effect the taste and appearance. I sauté Italian loose sausage as well as 2parts ground round. For color and nutrition I julienne carrots as well as sliver my onion into long thin strips. Absolutely delicious! Thank you for the inspiration :)

My family and I loved this tonight. The only thing I changed was I added spinache to it. Delish!! This is also very easy to modify to your tastes and the flavor reminds me a lot of tuscan chicken stew. This recipe makes a pretty large amount so my family of 3 will be eating this for a few days. Next time, I may add some fennel seed and possibly some pepper for a more robust flavor.

I used one 15 oz can of tomato sauce and one 15 oz of diced tomatoes instead of the 30 oz of tomato sauce. I used 5 1/2 Cups of low sodium chicken broth (made mine with chicken paste (Better Than Boullion Organic - 4-5  teaspoons  and omitted the salt from the recipe. Also added spinach for greens ;-) We absolutely loved it! The parmesan cheese makes it so tasty and we served it with a crusty bread from Costco's called Jessica's Oven Bread /Tuscan Pane White ..... it's delicious! Also cooked the pasta separately (al dente) and never added it to the pot! I did not want the pasta overcooked. ;-)

I loved it. I followed the recipe to the "T" and it was really good. My husband liked it also. It was my first time making pasta fagioli. (I order it often at restaurants) After I had my first bowl, I decided it was a little "thick" (more like stew than soup) and since I had some extra tomato sauce on hand I added a little more tomato sauce, water, and parmesean cheese to make it "soupier". Either way its good!

Easy, simple recipe for pasta fabioli.  I normally use 15 oz. diced tomatoes and 15 oz. tomato sauce instead.  I also sautee some carrots and celery in the sauce pan before adding the other soup ingredients.

This is a fantastic and authentic recipe. Pasta e fagioli is JUST these ingredients; It is a soup. BTW, I did not strain the beans - adding the liquid to the pot.

Best way, in my opinion, to turn this into a main course is to add slices of Italian sausage with fennel. It is a spectacular combination.

Enjoy!

Excellent and easy. I used canned diced Italian style tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and chicken stock instead of water. I also added half a box of frozen spinach. I took the suggestion of only using half a box of the pasta and it was perfect! It freezes well too. It smells great when simmering on the stove.

This was better than I thought it would be. The only changes I made, was used chicken stock intead of water. I also added some fresh baby spinach, and I cooked my pasta seperately, then added it.

Delicious!  I followed the directions except that I cooked up one dry cup of Great Northern White Beans instead of using two cans of navy and cannellini beans (the volumes are the same, after cooking). The pasta does soak up a lot of broth for the leftovers, but we like it that way.  This recipe made a hearty soup.
Update 2015.3.1: I have been making this soup for years now.  It is always simple and delicious.  One thing I will warn you is not to freeze it after you add noodles.  I tried it and regretted it.  Pasta does not like being frozen and will go to pieces.
Update 2016.9.24: Due to mistakes, used kidney beans and macaroni in place of various white beans and ditalini.  Only 3/4 lb macaroni used.  Single batch just barely fits into 2nd largest pot.

delicious! it might even be good, albeit far from traditional, with cheese tortellini. i used fresh parsley, basil, and oregano instead of dried, which i always think adds a bit more flavor. i also doubled the cheese and added some more on top when serving.

This is the best pasta fagioli yet. I did alter it a bit. I use stock in stead of water gives  a better taste. I guess you can use any stock you want.  And a tad of Italian seasoning.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  Based on other recommendations I only added about a half pound of pasta.  Next time I would add another can of beans.

This was great, but as a full-time employee and mother of 2, I had to make this a bit easier to make.  I chopped up all the ingredients and used fresh herbs instead of dried (1 tbl spoon to 1 tsp), 4 cups of chicken broth, 1/2 cup of red wine, 1 cup of water, and placed in crock pot for 8 hours on low.  The I boiled 1/3 of the rx pasta and placed in my containers before serving.

I loved this soup... made just a few changes.  Used 4c chicken broth and 1.5c of water.  Added frozen spinach.  I also threw in some frozen meatballs for the meat eater in the family.... turned out great!

Used two jars spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. Diced up some carrots and sauteed with onions. Used only cannellini beans. Left out parmesan. Did not mix the spaghetti with the soup. Actually cooked frozen cheese tortellini and dropped several in a bowl once dished up with a sprinkle of parmesan. The kids loved it!

easy, fast, and tasty! I followed the recipe almost exactly (only thing I did differently was use all cannelini beans, since I didn't have navy beans in my pantry).  I think ditalini pasta worked just fine.  This was a nice light lunch with some bread on the side.  Thanks for the recipe :)

I followed this recipe exactly as it was written. For the most part I thought this recipe was really good... however, I feel like something was missing for me to give this a full 5 stars. This was my first time having pasta fagioli, so many this just wasn't my thing. But I think for a quick fix because most of these things are in your cabinet, it's a great try for something different.

This was real good. I did add cheese torttilini  that I had in the fridge instead of the pasta due to what was on hand. it was really good. I bet it would be just as good with the pasta called for. thanks for sharing

I make this all the time now! It's my go-to recipe. I change it up a little by using chicken broth instead of water, more parmesan cheese, and add a little bit of crumbled up bacon.  I also keep the pasta separate and add a handful or so into each new bowl I pour, keeps it from turning into spaghettios the next day and makes it last much longer (several days worth and two boxes of pasta later!). Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Excellent flavor!  I did make some changes, some per other reviewers and some just for my family's taste.  I browned 1 lb. ground beef with the onion and garlic, drained the grease, then added 2 cans tomato sauce, one can of Italian diced tomatoes, 1/2 can stewed tomatoes (because I had it left over from another recipe), the beans,  3 large carrots (sliced), and all the spices except the salt.  I simmered this for about 40 minutes, then added the ditalini pasta and let that cook for another 20.  My only thought is that the pasta soaked up almost all the liquid, even with the extra cans of tomatoes.  I think next time I will only use 1/2 pound of pasta so we have a little more of the yummy sauce to enjoy.  I know the changes may not be exactly authentic, but they sure are yummy and we like a hearty soup at my house.

This is a wonderful STEW..... It is not the true Pasta Fagioli recipe italian style, the flavor was there just not the consistency. It was too thick mabye half or less than half of the pasta:) Other than that, yummy!

I agree with the others, you don't need that much pasta.  I followed the ingredients and directions exactly and by using that much pasta it was more like spaghetti as there was not enough liquid to make it as soup.  I will only use half as much pasta or less next time.  It was really good.

I like to add carrots, celery and smoked sausage to this. The veggies add more nutrition, and the smoked sausage brings a smoky layer to the whole thing. A little cumin adds slightly more depth. I make a double batch and it gets eaten up for lunches.

Delicious! I made it almost exactly like the recipe, except I only used one can of tomato sauce. I didn't want it to taste just like tomatoes, and I also used 2 cans of chicken stock instead of water. It was so good! Just like in one of my favorite restaurants! Yum Yum!

delicious as is! followed it with water. did not have navy beans, so i used chickpea. used 3/4 lb elbows and it was pretty much all noodles (what i like). generous on the parmesan and no salt. next time, i'd half the recipe and only use cannellini white beans. (chickpea was a tad too flavorful.)

Pretty delicious! I used 3 cloves garlic instead of 2, chicken broth instead of the water, 1 15 oz can of tomato sauce, 1 15 oz can petite diced tomatoes, and 1/2 lbs ditalini pasta. It came out perfect with those changes! Next time I might use 3.5 chicken broth and 2 water, but I'll see.

This is a regular and favorite in the house! I've changed it a bit by using chicken stock instead of water, and added cut up italian sausage links. I brown the links with the onions, and then put the rest of the ingredients onto it. This recipe makes enough for an army, or a couple of teenagers!

I have been looking for a recipe similar to my mother's and this is the closest thing I've found.  The only difference is that we always used chick peas.  I also added a small can of tomato paste to thicken it up a bit.  Tasted just like mom's.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was so simple and so good.  My kids just loved it.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a can of pasta sauce.  We actually liked the added flavor.  Served it with Mama D's Italian Bread from this site.  Yum!

My husband loves this dish at Olive Garden and I tried this to see how he would like this recipe and he loved it. My kids all liked it as well. We will definitely be having this again and again. Very easy to make and not too time consuming. I served it with crusty bread as well. Very good meal on a cold day!! Thank you for posting this recipe.

I think this was a very flavorful, easy soup. I used "italian seasoning" in place of the dried herbs and cut the pasta in half.

Excellent, I used chicken broth instead of water and next time ill use less noodles. I think just a little more then 1/2 a pound would be perfict.

Delicious!  Next time I make it, I will put half the pasta in "soup" and put the other half aside to use when serving.

I followed this recipe to the "T" and it is NOT soup!!!! I did enjoy as a pasta dish although I will add more of the seasonings next time.

My family loved this.  I would definitely make this again.  Like others, I would add tomatoes and extra water or tomato sauce to make extra sauce.  I even sent some to my mom-in-law.  She loved it too. :)

Excellent!  Reminds me of  a Pasta Fagioli soup from a famous downtown Chicago restaraunt.  The only thing I did different was to use chicken broth in place of the water.

I made this the other night and even my husband  and kids loved it.  I am the only vegetarian in the house, so was surprised when even the meat eaters enjoyed it.  The only thing I did differently was I left the noodles on the side and just added them to the bowls when needed.  Nice, hearty soup.

So I thought this recipe was just okay.  I followed the recipe to a "T," but was unsure of the canned beans.  Every recipe I've made calls for drained, rinsed beans so I did the same for this as well since it did not specify.  Once the pasta was added, this was definitely NOT a soup :)  Very thick, not chunky as described since the pasta and beans are small.  I would honestly describe it as very similar to homemade spaghetti O's, sorry :(  If I were to make this again, unlikely, I would use half the pasta and double the beans for a chunkier texture.  I found the ditalini pasta at a local Italian market.  This picture in this recipe is not really similar to how it comes out unless you use macaroni and add chopped tomatoes (which I didn't).

We tried this for dinner tonight and my husband loved it as much as I did.  I made some foccacia bread to go along with for dunking and it was the right mix on a cold winter evening.  As a "fellow Valerio" I heartily give this 5 stars!

Loved this recipe almost exactly as is. My 2 year old ate it and had fun putting the noodles (I used ziti) on each of his fork tines before taking each bite. My alterations were kidney beans instead of navy and then I topped each bowl with a few slices of Italian sausage. Paired it with Italian bread and my hubby was in heaven. Did also take the advice to boil and rinse the noodles separate before adding them. Will make this one over and over.

Pasta Fagioli is made using Ditalini pasta not elbow macaroni; it does not have bacon etc in it.  The only thing I do that is different is keep the Ditalini separate, adding it to the bowls before adding the soup.

This is a great recipe. I made this for my boyfriends Italian family Christmas dinner they loved it. I only made one change I couldn't find any navy beans at the store so I just bought chick Peas and used them instead and I had read in another review. I used the ditalini pasta and just put it in the soup and it soaked up all of the sauce so I added another can and it was perfect. The next day I made it using chicken broth and I was even better.

This was great!  Family loved it.  Tasted even better 2 days later.  Used 2 1/2 cups each of water and chicken broth and then 1/2 cup of red wine.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe.

DELICIOUS.  I USED WHAT I HAD - SMALL WHITE BEANS AND BLACK BEANS.  I ALSO WANTED TO USE UP MY CHICKEN BROTH SO I ADDED 1 CUP BROTH AND 3 CUPS WATER. I CUT THE WATER DOWN BECAUSE I ALSO ADDED A CAN OF STEWED TOMATOES. THE PASTA I HAD ON HAND WAS SMALL PENNE. I USED ABOUT 1/4 - 1/3 OF A BOX.

Delicious soup. I didn't have a large can of tomato sauce so I used crushed tomatoes. It had a slightly sweet taste. My husband loved it and is planning to take leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

This was awesome!! A crisp autumn day, and hot soup - perfect. I didn't realize that I did not have a large can of tomato sauce so used the small can I had, then added two cans of stewed tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes.  This one is a keeper!

This was a nice and easy meal. I made it with chicken broth instead of water. It could use something more. Next time I will reduce the tomato sauce and add some diced or stewed tomatoes.  thanks.

ok...way too much pasta, in my opinion - it was more like a pasta dish with broth and a few beans.  To me, pasta fagioli should have more beans and more broth, and not so much pasta.  The flavor was good, but next time I'll cut the pasta in 1/2.  Also, it makes a TON of soup.

Excellent. I made a couple of changes though. I used all chicken broth. Had no navy beans, so only used Cannelini. Used 2 14.5z cans of stewed tomatoes that I crushed on their way into the pot, gave it a more chunky feel, and less tomato taste. I agree that 1/2 the pasta amount is more than enough. Lastly, added 2 extra cloves of garlic, anything less isn't worthy of an italian name. I will certainly make this often. Oh, I also added 4 stalks of sliced celery, just to use it up.

great recipe - good flavor.  I followed the recipe and used a lb. of ditalini but I would definitely use 1/2 next time.  Soaked up almost all the liquid, even after I cooked them separately.  More like a "stoup" - stew/soup.  Excellent nonetheless!

Used half the pasta called for and it was still way too much.  Was more like hotdish than soup.  Had to do a lot of tweaking to get flavor into soup.  Will probably not make again.

Another successful new recipe for me! Hubby and I so enjoyed making this together we've decided to cook together with a new recipe once a week in addition to our date nights! All six of us liked this including kids age 4, two 8-yr olds, and 17. We added 1/2lb. ground beef and used 3/4lb noodles. We might try some different beans and adding sausage next time. Great recipe over all!

I used a total of 3 cups of dried beans which I soaked and pre-cooked for an hour. I used frozen tomatoes from our garden and about 1/3 cup of very small pasta. Really good. house smelled divine too. I served with rustic Italian Bread.

Going only off of my husband's "review" since I didn't have any, this turned out very well!I subbed diced tomatoes for half of the tomato sauce, and husband asked that next time I also add a little ground beef and extra beans. Thanks, op!

This soup gets very thick, more like goulash minus meat.  The flavor is good, just weird consistency for soup.

This has become one of my all-time favorite recipes to make - and it is easily one of my husband's favorite meals. Based on other suggestions, I use 4 cans of Campbell's beef broth in place of the water and I brown a pound and a half of ground beef and add that. As others suggested, I add a can of diced tomatoes, too. I have also started adding some matchstick carrots for some color. This is a hearty, flavorful dish that is easy to make and gets better each day after you make it ...

I gave it 4 stars because after reading some reviews, it seemed like it did need tweaking. I just made this tonight, and it was great-with changes. I can't imagine that it had much flavor without using broth. I followed suggestions re:adding veggies. I sauteed onions, carrots and celery. Then added a can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano. Then I added fresh parsley, veggie broth, garbanzo beans and Parmesan cheese. I also made the pasta(Rotini) separately.It did have a very good flavor after simmering for an hour. It was more like a minestrone soup. I will certainly make it again.

Very easy and simple.  I do add a can of diced tomatoes for more chunkiness.  Also a full box of pasta is too much after the soup sits and absorbs the liquid.  I only use about 2/3.

I really liked this! Always on the lookout for dishes that freeze well,and this one does, without the pasta.  I freeze portions and then, when I am ready to use it, I pop a little bit of pasta into a microwave safe bowl of salted water and microwave till done. So simple!

I made this early in the day and let it cook all day.  I added the pasta last minute and, I have to say this was excellent...My family loved it!!!This is definately a keeper.  Followed the recipe entirely and would only change one thing: Cut the onions up finer, too many left in the bowl.

Sent my husband to do the shopping for this and he got dried beans!  I don't cook with dried beans much, so they were a little "crunchy" (like boiled peanuts), but I kinda liked it that way.  I also cooked the pasta with everything else so mine was more like a stew than soup.

I changed it up a little by using 4 large tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce, mainly because I had bought too many at my local farmer's market.  But I thought it was awesome with the fresh tomatoes in it.  Good meal, and very good left overs.

very easy to make and delicious. Be sure to grate some extra parmesan to sprinnkle on top at the table. You can also save yourself some work by adding the pata directly to the simmering soup, but be sure to use less pasta then, or add extra water, as the pasta absorbs liquid and can make it like pasta stew (which also tastes delicious).

I was pleasantly surprised with how good this was.  I used fresh herbs, extra garlic, no onions (fiance doesn't like onions) and added Turkey Italian Sausage.  It's a keeper!  Thick and hearty, but very fresh tasting.

Very tasty.  I sub'd 1 small can tomato puree and 1 small can chopped tomatoes with chili and garlic for the tomato sauce, and added 6 chopped thin Italian sausage links.  I also used mixed Italian herbs rather than the individual allotments as it seemed far too much. The pasta "drinks" all the liquid, making it very soggy (and I put it into the soup uncooked!), so I'd recommend making the pasta seperately and serving on the day, packing the leftovers sans pasta. (I used penne, which was lovely)

This was delicious. I used black beans instead of navy and penne pasta and doubled the parmesan. I left out the 5 cups of water because my husband doesn't like soups. It turned out really yummy and I will definitely be making this again.

I found this recipe quite easy to make. I did make one change though, instead of using water, I used Low-sodium chicken broth. Even the kids ate this right up. Was better the next day when it was little thicker

This recipe was very good. I added a touch of spinach and a few extra cloves of garlic. It turned out very good. Next time we may add a some chicken or turkey sausage. We will definitely make this one again.

This is very good and easy to make.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and reduced the amount of pasta by 1/2.  Next time I will also add a can of diced tomatoes for additional liquid and veggies!  I omitted the salt, thinking that soups are usually too salty for my taste, but I would not do that again next time.  Without it, it tasted like it needed salt. Served with salad and Italian bread this makes a great easy make ahead meal.

I really enjoyed this recipe and my husband did as well!  I had chicken broth on hand, so I substituted it for the water, I cut down on the noodles, but threw in a can of mushrooms.  Very tasty!  I'm keeping this recipe on hand for the years to come!

Made this for dinner last night.  It was easy and excellent.  Better than the Olive Garden.  Used kidney beans and northern beans.  Added spinach and some chicken for a hearty meal.  Even better the next day.  Used only 1/3 pound of the pasta.

This is a pretty good, basic recipe.  I did however find it a bit bland and perhaps a little "unauthentic" tasting but I'm not sure what exactly is missing from the recipe to give it that little bit of "something".  Great basic to add to ones' repertoire nonetheless.

Tasty, but way too much pasta.  The next day it was more like pasta and a little sauce, not soup.

This recipe was alright. It makes alot so I freezed a ton.  I think there was a bit too much basil. However it was easy to make although it did not have much flavor.

I altered this by using shells instead of ditalini, feta cheese rather than parmesean, and added chicken.  The flavor was really great!

Very good!  A nice way to get beans into your diet.  We eat very little meat so we try and fit in other proteins as much as we can - this was a nice change from soup!

I liked this one:  I used half the amount of pasta like others had recommended and added the parmesan cheese just before serving - I added spinach to this and cut up some kiebasa since I did not have sausage.  My 3 yr old boy loved it!  My 7 yr old was less impressed, but I cannot please everyone in my house!  The pasta did absorb a lot of the moisture.  I had cooked it seperately and added it the last few minutes of cooking.  It needs something else.. maybe worcestershire?  But overall I liked this one.

Most pasta fagioli recipes I've had do not have a tomato base. This was so tasty even my two-year-old daughter was gobbling it up! I'm anxious to see how the leftovers taste this evening. Wonderful recipe!

Great pasta fagioli!  I to "doctored" it up some.  Used chicken broth instead of water, chopped tomato and tomato sauce, also 1 more can of beans.  Please add the extra beans.  I though it needed it.

EXCELLENT for sure
I did use a 28 oz can of whole tomatoes and 2-8 oz small cans of sauce because it was all I had but I loved the chunks of tomato, and I used 1/2 broth 1/2 water as suggested and only used 1/2 a lb. of pasta which was a smart move.
Next time I might chop some pepperoni too. But it was great for dinner and leftover even better

Good basic recipe, but like the others, I made adjustments. I added carrots and celery to the onion and added a # of ground beef. Threw in a splash of Vinegar and some V-8 and diced tomatoes. Very good.

This was a great recipe for me to start out with but I really can not rate it because I did some mager changes to it.  First of all I changed the cloves of garlic to 6 cloves.  Then I used 3 1/2 cups of Vegetable broth and 2 cups of water.  I added one 29oz can of Crushed Tomatoes with Italian seasonings and used 2 cans of Cannellini and Navy beans instead of just one can each.  I also added 2 large carrots shredded. The noodles I did not put straight into the soup but instead put them in each persons bowl when I served it so they do not soak up all the juices in the soup. I will make this recipe again.

I couldn't find the right type of pasta in my store for this recipe so I used another kind that ended up being a little too big.  The soup tasted wonderful though and I will probably make it again.

Great after a couple changes.  Too much water, 3 cups is plenty.  Added carrots and celery for a heartier soup (while cooking onions).  As others have said, keep pasta seperate until serving.

I made it with the modifications others suggested...4 cloves garlic, extra can of red kidney beans, split water with No Chicken (vegetarian) broth, romano cheese and only 1/2 lb of pasta.  It was great.  Next time, I would probably use even less pasta. It really does soak up a lot of the soup.

VERY good!! The only changes I made were: more garlic, 2c veg broth w/ 3 1/2c water, and 1/2 lb pasta. Let simmer for 2 hours and added al dente pasta at very end.  YUMMMMM!!!

This was a really great recipe.  I added a lot more garlic, probably about 5 cloves.  I used 1/2 pound of pasta based on other reviews and that was a perfect amount. Next time I will just add an extra can of beans and some celery.   I also chopped the onion smaller.

I thought the recipe was very good.  Very Italian which is what I wanted.  The only problem I had was the navy beans were still to hard after the simmering time. I will either boil or soak the navy beans next time around but all in all the recipe was fantastic.

Superb soup!  As is common with us wanna-be chefs, I added a few of my own signature touches.  The end result was stellar though could not have been achieved without the solid foundation of this recipe.

Fantastic! I used vegetable broth instead of water, and it was delicious. I personally don't like onions, so next time I won't use them, but other than that, easy, delicious, and great for vegetarians.

My husband and I thought this was great.  I used vegetable broth instead of water and added some sliced carrots and for the tomato sauce I used a large jar spicy spaghetti sauce plus a little water, just enough to get the consistancy I wanted. I used Chiocciole noodles which really made it good.

This recipe is so easy to prepare, and makes a nice big pot of delicious and hearty soup. I cut back on the pasta as suggested and added to soup before serving. Also used chicken broth instead of water. Served with a crusty hot bread, great winter night supper. This recipe is a keeper!!!

I thought this soup was a bit bland...I'm pretty new at cooking so I didn't know what to do to fix it, but I didn't think it was great.
