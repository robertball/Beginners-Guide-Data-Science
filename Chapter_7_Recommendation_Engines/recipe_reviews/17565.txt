Considering there was no coconut in this recipe, it tasted pretty good.  You should know that it will not taste EXACTLY like a pina colada.  Here's what I did to make it taste better: I substituted coconut milk for regular milk.  Voila!  Also, I had to use more ice to get a thicker texture.  The idea of using the heavy whipping cream was brilliant, by the way!

We doubled this recipe for several of us and it made a big blender-full.  We added 4-5 oz of Cream of Coconut and at least 1 cup of pineapple (probably more like 2) and left out the sugar and liked it better.

This is unbelievable! I used coconut milk instead of milk like some others suggested and it was great. Served this for a girl's night and it was a hit.

Substitute the milk and heavy cream with coconut cream (you should be able to find some in the alcohol mixer aisle of your supermarket) and it tastes very much like the original. I would omit the sugar as the pineapple juice is sweet enough :)

Thanks for the post! We really enjoyed these! I used a cut pineapples for the glasses, which was really cute to serve (like that pic there, great idea)! My guests really thought these were very good and didn't even miss the rum (; My poolboy stopped working and even enjoyed one with us. (;

I rarely give a 5 star since I feel it is for "Thank God for this!" food and is not to be given lightly.  This is a true 5 star in taste but the texture was a 4 star as ours were a little thick (maybe the blender actually whipped the whipping cream :) ).

Overall, a very good drink I would recommend.

Instead of using heavy cream, use coconut cream. Buy a can (or two) of full fat coconut milk, refrigerate overnight, open the can from the bottom and drain off thin stuff; open the top and scoop out the cream-YUMMY! - it can legitimately be called a pina colada because there is coconut in there now:)

I make a similar recipe, but instead of using the heavy cream, I substitute Coffeemate liquid creamer - the coconut creme or Italian sweet cream are the ones I use. Being allergic to coconut - the creamer is a perfect compliment without making me have an allergic reaction.

Noticing this was absent any coconut flavor, I added just a teeny bit of natural coconut flavoring (teeny since it can be a little much very easily).  I also used Splenda instead of sugar.  This is creamy white, frosty cold and refreshingly tasty. I'm thinking a little rum extract would have been interesting too.

This recipe was great! Instead of using heavy cream though, I prefer creme of coconut. Also I substituted regular milk with almond milk and it tasted fantastic!

This is a perfect summer drink! I substituted 1/2 cup of milk for 1/4 cup of coconut milk, to add more of a coconut taste. This drink tastes amazing. You definitely must try it.

Well I saw this recipe and thought that it looked delicious, but I didn't have pineapple juice, milk or heavy whipping cream, so I had to improvise. I used a full cup of cream of coconut, a heaping cup of fresh pineapple chunks, and about 3 to four cups of ice from my ice maker of the fridge, and it was a real treat, I had to immediately make another helping, and although I had to improvise, I'm sure this is just as delicious unimprovised, so I'm saying this gets five stars...thanks for the recipe.

This is delicious! I had fallen in love with Orange Julius' pina colada Julius, and this tastes pretty darn close to that when a little coconut flavoring is added in.

Tasted great! Added extra ice cubes to make it feel more like a slushy and extra added pineapple chunks before blending.

So...as an assignment, I needed to make a drink for a photo...I followed the amounts in the recipe to a T since the directions were pretty clear...and I've had many of Pina Colada, Virgin or alcoholic in my adult life. And this was not that great for me. It wasn't sweet, and it lacked the traditional flavor of coconut. It really tasted like flavored pineapple milk. I'm sorry no one cared for it.

Wonderful! I mistakenly bought vanilla coconut milk instead of my normal soy milk and was looking for a way to get rid of it. This made for a fun night!

this is really good, but i've had better virgin pina coladas before. i used coconut milk instead of regular milk, and i had to use heavy whipping cream instead of cream. i feel like this needs a lot more coconut flavor, but still it's pretty good.

being under 21, i have never had a real pina colada. But i have had many virgin Pini's. This one is pretty good, but Just a bit too thin. I do, however, plan to make it again. This would also be a lot better in Summer than Winter.

A piña colada is rum, pineapple juice AND COCONUT MILK, or cream of coconut. Even as a "virgin" drink, no coconut = no piña colada. This is a pineapple shake, not as good.

I used cream of coconut instead of heavy cream but was too sweet. I would say leave out the sugar if substituting like I did.
