OMG! This is incredible. Followed the recipe,except I did not have the cheese or avacado the first time I made it. I have made it many times since and it is one of our fav's. Spicy goodness will really wake you up in the morning.

AMAZING!!!  I made it for my family (hubby & 7 little kids) & they all loved it!  I actually kept the ingredients separated so the kids could decide if they wanted to layer according to the recipe or keep things separated.  It was a huge hit!  Thank you!

Really,  Really good! The Chipolte chili powder was a lot hotter than I expected,  so you might want to adjust if you are sensitive. Great mix of favors!

I substituted a few things - red potatoes for sweet, Parmesan for feta, paprika for cumin, no avocado.  I have not doubt it's just as awesome how it's listed, however.  It's a hearty meal and very tasty; however, I don't recommend it if you're already close to dying of a heart attack.

Great flavor! The only change: I used Garam Masala to season the sweet potatoes; didnâ€™t add the other seasonings except salt and pepper to the eggs when I fried them. The flavors blended well! Hubs loved it!

Added ground lamb to make it a little hearty, and wow!! We will definitely make this again!  Nothing like a little spice to wake you up in the morning!  Browned ground lamb ahead of time, and added after the spices were added.  Really made this recipe incredible!

Delicious! Love that this uses ingredients I usually have on hand. I had a large red onion so I only ended up using half and I cooked the potato mixture a bit longer to make sure the potatoes were soft. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is soo good. I serve it over chopped romaine.  It makes a great salad!
