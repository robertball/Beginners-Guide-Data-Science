Very good recipe, Cyndi!  I scaled it down quite a bit, but I wish I wouldn't have with the mint.  My family discovered they liked feta, so thanks for that, too!  I would recommend cooking this in foil that has been sprayed because it burned a little in my pan.  I think next time I'll cut the potatoes in rounders rather than wedges, and I'll add the feta for the last minute or so of cooking time.

WOWZA! Cindy these were completely fabulous in every sense of the word. Here is what I did different. I precooked the potatoes in the micro to give them a head start,  We are under another heat advisory again and I was using the grill outside, no 400 degree oven for me tonight. I did cut back on the water since they were partially cooked, but followed everything else to the T. I did have a few fresh picked green beans that needed to be used so I added that to the potatoes in my grill pan. Really wonderful and yes I will make them again!

Cyndi, this recipe gives potatoes a great flavor. Will be making these often. I did not have 80 min. to bake them so I microwaved them for 10 min on high, covered, then put them in the oven(uncovered) for 35 min until the potatoes were tender and browned. I did not have fresh mint but it tasted fantastic without it. Thanks Cyndi, great recipe

5 stars from each and every one of us! I made this as written except that I cut the potatoes smaller, substituted chicken broth for the water and marinaded the potatoes to include the herbs. These were done in about an hour at 410. Delicious and a big hit with the whole family. I served with my "Mediterranean" style turkey meatloaf and it made for the perfect dinner! Thank you, Cyndi, for sharing an outstanding side dish!

Oooh. SOOOO yummy!!! Made these to accompany the marinated Greek chicken kabobs (katplusgoll) I made for dinner tonight. I was thinking of taking the easy route and just opening a pouch of Uncle Ben's rice pilaf to serve on the side, but I am SOOO glad I didn't. :) I pretty much followed Cat Lady's directions to the letter except for a few minor changes. First, I halved everything since this was a side dish for two people. Second, I used the full amount of herbs called for (we like herbs!). And finally, I subbed chicken broth for water and used more of it (my potatoes seemed dry half way thru the first 40 minutes, so I added a 1/2 c. more at that point and another 1/2 c. when I added my herbs). Oh, and I also used herbed instead of plain feta (yummy!). THREE TIPS: a) if you want to prep ahead of time, simply cut your potatoes and add to a large pot of water; then add a bit of lemon juice to prevent browning, b) if you rinse / drain your potatoes and then dry (with a kitchen towel) REALLY well, you'll end up with perfectly crisp potatoes (this process removes excess starch which prevents potatoes from crisping up) and c) spread your potatoes on a WELL-GREASED, wide rimmed baking sheet and roast on the top rack of your oven (you'll also find that this helps crisp everything up, again, if you like your potatoes slightly crisp...). Thanks for sharing, Cyndi! This one's going in my "keeper" file for sure. :-)

HOLY SMOKES!  these potatoes are fabulous -- perhaps the best i have ever made.  i put these in a cast iron skillet on the grill, covered with foil, and let them bake for 40 minutes.  the feta adds such a nice subtle flavor to these.  this will be my go to potato recipe from now on.  thanks so much cyndi.

Excellent! This had all the flavor of my favorite souvlaki, but on potatoes! My only caveat, and it is small, is that there was too much oil. I had to drain some off to get a crispiness. No biggie, I probably had them in a smaller pan than what is required. The cooking time was perfect for me (the water keeps them from burning). I added my oregano at the specified time, but left my mint until just before serving. I wanted it to look really bright and fresh. Thanks for a great recipe! I'm already planning to make it again.

These are good.  I made half the recipe to feed 4 and should have made all 10 servings.  I did increase the mint to 1 tablespoon because we do like mint and a teaspoon just seemed puny.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

WOW!  These potatoes are amazing! The only change I made was I didn't add any water.  They came out slightly more crunchy which is fine by us! I will definitely be making these again.  Thank you Cat Lady Cyndi.  MMmmmmm

Simply Awesome! This is a fabulous Mediterranean take on regular 'ol roasted potatoes. I LOVE feta cheese, so I had to give this a try and I'm so glad I did. I cut the recipe in half, used red potatoes that I quarted and opted out of using the water. I also seasoned with the oregano from the start. I cooked these at 425 vs. 450 turning them a few times during cooking. The feta cheese really makes the dish and the presentation is very nice. This is a definite keeper. Thanks for a great recipe, Cat Lady Cyndi!

These were quite tasty.  I actually (inadvertently, mind you) put the oregano & mint on before it went in the oven and it still came out great.  This pairs very well with the "Northwest Steakhouse Steak Marinade" (also on allrecipes.com) as it has a bit of Greek flair to it as well.

This recipe turned out perfectly. I omitted the mint and added 4 strips of crumbled apple wood smoked, thick cut bacon at the end with the feta. My guests scraped the bowl clean. The only thing I would change would be to maybe substitute some of the bacon drippings for the olive oil.

This was amazing. I added minced onions to give it a little extra flavor and cut the wedges thinner so it would cook faster. Mine was done in 50 mins, I just flipped them over after forty.I served it with steamed cabbage and cubed steak.  My mom and sister were scraping the bowl LONG after the potatoes themselves had disappeared.

I made many Greek dishes tonight (for a large party), yet this was the one that I heard more comments about.  I followed the recipe exactly, but added a little more fresh mint with the feta at the end.  Before I made this, I was skeptical about the water and lemon juice.  I was afraid of soggy potatoes.  But, I really trust many of the reviewers that have reviewed this recipe, (as well as the submitter) so I went with it.  I have never been more pleased with a pan of potatoes!  They were all cooked appropriately (even though my cutting is not even), and they were crispy without being burned!  The herbs were absolutely wonderful.  The feta on top was so tasty - I was afraid it would melt and not sit well on the buffet, but it didn't and was GREAT!  Thanks Cyndi!!!

I've made these potatoes about 400 times since I found this recipe! I have used all kinds of potatoes and they've all been amazing. We think the more lemon and oregano you use, the better! Also, we like to cut them in thin, potato chip-like slices to get them crispy. I had a coworker ask to try them when i brought in leftovers and I told her to heat them up. She tried them cold and said they were amazing just like that. About 4 of us ate the rest cold with our fingers! I bet you could make a potato salad with the leftovers that would be great with burgers! Thank so much for recreating my favorite greek restaurant potatoes!!

This was good, but did not blow us away. I reduced the oil, as many recommended - adding just enough to coat. We found the lemon flavor to be a bit overpowering.

These are hands down some of the BEST potatoes out there. I used greek seasoning (from the site) because I was making another recipe using it. It had both the oregeno and mint in it as well as few other spices so I thought it would be excellent and it was. I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could! Fabulous Cyndi! Thank you so much for sharing!!

Thanks for the wonderful recipe, Cyndi!  Followed the recipe to a tee with the exception of the mint which I didn't have on hand. So I added basil instead.  Yummy! A definite recipe box keeper.

These were good.  I would make them again.  I'm still searching for Greek potatoes I once had at a Greek Festival.  This recipe is not that, but still tasty.  The mint really adds to the flavor.

Delicious.  I made it exactly as written and brought it to a dinner party - everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I love feta cheese and the flavor with the potatoes was wonderful.

Yum! Didn't change a thing except to cut it down to four servings - Delicious!  I served with Easy Mediterranean Fish from this site and it was a match made in heaven!  Delicious! (Yes, I know I'm repeating myself, but they are...) Thanks, Cyndi!

Decent flavor, but it sticks like crazy to the baking pan, and the potatoes burnt and never really got crispy. too many problems to try and salvage the recipe. will be using a different recipe next time.

I scaled this down to serve two people - so definitely not 5 pounds of potatoes :) I loved it and was able to use fresh herbs from the garden. A friend who doesn't like feta even enjoyed it.

I wanted a alternative to baked potato with steak, this was a hit. Great recipe Cyndi-thanks. Everyone still loaded them up with sour cream, chives and bacon bits, delicious!

Another winner.  I follow the recipe (will wonders never cease!) but they don't take anywhere nearly as long as that to cook, maybe 45 minutes or so.

This makes a ton of potatoes if you go with the original servings, but that's okay because I had a lot of potatoes to use up!  I'd like a bit more mint because I really didn't taste it, but otherwise this is a good recipe.  If you decide to make the entire recipe, use your biggest bowl to mix and use at least a 9x13 roasting pan.  Thanks for the recipe!

Before I write this I just want to clarify something being Greek and all. 
Greek Potatoes are usually marinated for a long while with lemon juice and oregano- that's pretty much it. They aren't really supposed to be crispy like a regular roasted potato. Rather soft on the inside  with slightly crispy edges kind of soggy. It's all about flavor with them.
That being said- this recipe was fantastic- despite not being traditional. I followed the recipe exactly- had plenty of liquid and cooked for the specified time.
The Feta makes it as well. I will most definitely make this again.
Thanks!

This side dish is a keeper! Next time I'll omit the garlic, because I prefer a sweeter, milder taste. I used more lemon juice than the original recipe called for (eyeballed it, probably doubled it).

I was running shy on time and wasn't able to bake these for as long as the recipe says.  I did enjoy the tang of lemon these had, which was surprising because I don't like lemon in foods.  My potatoes were still soggy at 60 minutes of cooking, but I may try again, making sure they are all single file and not bunched up in the pan.

Thought these were just okay. I cut the recipe in half and found it to be very bland. If I were to make these again I would only half the amount of potatoes as 2 1/2 lbs were plenty for our household of 5 adults. Just needed more flavor for us.

These were easy and delicious! I served with Creamy Coriander Chicken and it made an impressive presentation. My family is big into feta cheese and this filled the bill. Thank you!

Very good ~ a nice change from my Greek potatoes (which I make to duplicate the taste I had while in Greece & the way Greek chefs taught me). I made it as written, even though I knew the olive oil could be reduced. We were so hungry when the potatoes were ready that at first I forgot to top it with feta. We enjoyed it without feta very much, and so I can say the feta is optional. We then tried it with feta, & thought the cheese detracted from the flavorful potatoes. I do recommend this version of Greek potatoes, knowing that the oil can be reduced & the feta can be left out, if one wishes.

Holy Cazoly, these were fabulous! Followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of mint - which I forgot at the grocery store). The subtle lemon and garlic flavors are so beautiful... next time I might add a dash more of both! Also, the recipe does not say this, but I stirred it at the half-way point.. I think it was a good idea. Yum!

Followed recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. Family loves it and guests are very impressed when I serve this with lamb or rosemary and herb rubbed sirloin tip. 
If there are any leftovers I warm in a skillet and serve with eggs and bacon.

These were very tasty!  I cut the feta cheese in half though - as I thought that was a HUGE amount to begin with.  Though these were good, the pan was a pain to clean!  The potatoes stuck horribly!  Maybe I'll try using that nonstick foil next time?

My most favorite recipe that I've found on this site. So delicious. They take a long time to cook, but are worth it. I've made this recipe several times and just microwave the potatoes for a little bit when I am short on time.

I love potatoes. Actually, not just me but the entire family loves potatoes. So you can say we know our potatoes well ;). This recipe is awesome! I didn't change a single thing. The potatoes were delicious, and bursting with flavour. I can just foresee that this is one of those dishes that's going to be an integral of my family for years and years to come! Thank you for this with us Cyndi! My mouth's already watering for more! :P

These were excellent! I only used like 5 large potatoes because their were only 3 for dinner that night. I forgot the oregano & feta because the potatoes were cooked in the first 40 minutes. I have to say that they garlic & lemon flavors were delicious and will be making these again soon~ planning on using ALL ingreds next time!

WOW, these were FANTASTIC! I scaled the recipe down, but probably used almost the whole amount of feta, lol, we LOVE it. Hubby already called the leftovers for his lunch too! These had such a wonderful flavor. I loved the lemon in these, they remind me of a fried potato that my mom makes that has lemon on them. These will be a constant staple in our house! Cindy, Thanks so much for sharing this AWESOME recipe! :)

I love lemon potatoes! These were great. I'd use less oil and more lemon next time, for my tastes. Tip: If you use golden (yellow) potatoes, they're done in about half the time. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum yum yum!  These were awesome!  I made them as directed, except I cut the recipe down to 2 servings instead of 10.  I was concerned at first about adding the mint because I have not had that with potatoes before, but it turned out great and I am happy I kept true to the recipe.

Loved the flavor of these potatoes! I cut the recipe in half, diced the potatoes, then cooked for about 10 minutes in the microwave as others suggested. Poured the liquid over them & put them in a pan on the grill while I cooked my chicken. Just before serving, I added the feta cheese, & stuck under the broiler for a few minutes - turned out great!

I think I'm in love.  These are awesome, even if you leave off the mint and the feta (I WOULDN'T leave off the feta by choice, but they are still good without it).  I cut the recipe back and found that the potatoes cooked much, much faster than the original recipe recommended, so keep that in mind if you reduce the recipe.  I think it only took about 50-60 minutes total with 2 potatoes.  Excellent recipe!

Excellent. I followed this recipe exactly as written (even though I was a little nervous about adding the water to it), except I used dried mint and oregano in the oven and topped with a little more fresh mint when they were finished roasting. Perfectly done and perfectly flavored. Thanks for the recipe!

This was great!  I made a couple minor changes-I scaled it down and I omited the mint(I just don't like it).  I also added the oregano into the oil mixture, simply because I didn't read the directions close enough!  I will definetly make this again.

I used chicken broth instead of water, decreased oil to 1/2 cup, and didn't have fresh  mint on hand so omitted this. I also chose to not use feta because I served it with greek salad and thought it would be too much. But they were still fabulous potatoes, some of the best I've had! I will add rosemary and basil next time, and probably add more lemon.

Yummy. Made this tonight with yukon gold potatoes - the lemon did not exactly come thru, nor did the mint, but they were delicious nevertheless. Next time I might bump those two flavors up a bit.
I was a little pressed for time, so I cut my potatoes into small chunks and cooked on 425 in my cast iron skillet in my convection oven - took about 45 minutes. Little crispy bits on the outside and creamy on the inside. I used less feta to save a few calories - would also be great with goat cheese or with no cheese at all. Will make again and maybe try to cut the olive oil a touch just to save a few calories.

I didn't follow directions. To speed things up...I nuked red potatoes, "crashed" them then drizzled and sprinkled with ingredients before broiling.

These were good. I liked the flavour though they seemed a bit dry in the end to me, even though there was liquid in the dish, the actual potato hunks were a little dry to me. I think I'd prefer smaller pieces of potato. I did think just reading the recipe that 80 minutes at 450 seemed like way overkill and I did them for just over an hour at 425. They were definitely done, but I don't think 20 more minutes would have hurt them. I threw the feta in immediately after pulling the dish from the oven and covered it for a few minutes while plating the rest of dinner. Thanks for the recipe Cyndi, I'd make again!

great recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i made this for my family of seven, with 5 kids age 3 to 14, and everyone loved it! my mum was begging me to let her make them with some plain old hamburgers because she loved them so much. i stayed generous with the lemon and oregano, and put them in dishes big oven dishes rather then pans so the potatoes basically were in a marinade when they went in and soaked up the juices before they came out. feta is a great partner. i served it with greek style marinated chicken, because i could basically use the same recipe. 4 and a half stars!!!

One word: FABULOUS!! The fresh mint is the key ingredient (okay, combined with the lemon juice, garlic, and feta, but still....). Cannot overemphasize enough: fresh mint.

Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Allow me to preface my review by explaining that potatoes just aren't my thing.  I prefer them preserved and deep fried.  Or mashed.  Chunks of potatoes?  No, thanks!  Yet, I LOVED, yes, you read that correctly, LOVED these.  I made these for Mr. LTH's band for dinner tonight and they are out of this world!  I used baby red potatoes (3 lbs, skin on) which I had chopped 2 days ago and kept in the frig in a bowl covered w/water.  I followed the recipe pretty closely (though I kept all of the "other" measurements the same---except the EVOO, I reduced that to 1/4 C to reduce calories--- for my 3 lbs of potatoes as opposed to 5 lbs).  Upon the advice of a reviewer, I elected not to use the water, as I knew I'd prefer a crunchier potato.  I forgot to pick up fresh mint, so I used dried instead.   These were done at about an hour for me, but I'd cut my potatoes into fairly small cubes, as opposed to wedges (again, hoping for a bit more of a crisp).  Cyndi, THANK YOU so much for submitting this wonderful recipe; I'm glad I FINALLY got around to trying it!

We really enjoyed these!  I halved the recipe since it was just hubs and me.  Wanted something new to go with our burgers and these really fit the bill.  Only addition was a pinch of red pepper flake.  Loved the lemon/garlic combo!!

This is my family's new favorite potato recipe! I followed the recipe but omitted the mint since I didn't have any.  They were so good without the feta I didn't bother to add it.

I absolutely loved the flavors in this recipe! The lemon flavor was present but not overpowering, the mint adds some freshness and the feta cheese just pulls everything together and, when sprinkled over the hot potatoes, becomes creamy and still tangy.  This is absolutely five star-worthy, just as written.  Thanks for sharing :)

TANGY AND YUMMY!  finally, a potato with total zip!  I didn't add the mint, cuz I didn't have any, and I also threw in a little "greek" seasoning mix.  Will for sure make again!

Great taste - I may have overcooked them a little, and need to grease the pan a little bit more.

I have got to say these were soooooo good. I marinated the potatoes in everything before putting in a casserole dish and put on the grill at 375deg for about 1 1/2 - 2 hrs. Neighbors behind us came home and could immediately smell the garlic and lemon and invited themselves over for Gyros and these potatoes.....lmao. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

These were sooooo good!  I must admit I made them for dinner and had some again for an evening snack! :)  The bigger pieces were a little dry, so I am hoping cutting the potatoes a bit smaller next time will help.  Definitely making these again...good enough to make for company!

I was a little skeptical of how much liquid this recipe called for, so I reduced it.  I wish I would not have done that because It was obvious to me why they needed it when I was eating them.  Feta is a dry cheese, so with out the excess liquid, the dish tastes a bit dry.  The overall flavor is great.  When I make these again, I will follow directions exactly and maybe add a little more mint.

I have made these three times now and they are a sure-fire hit. You can leave them until they get nice and browned and dryer or you can leave them with a little more moisture.  Either way, this is a keeper as a basic easy potatoes recipe. I leave out the feta and use artificial lemon juice. Still great.

These potatoes were excellent! I scaled the recipe down to four servings and it was awesome. I did not have mint on hand so I left it out and added some basil. I will be making these again for sure!

Mmmm, these were delicious.  I tossed them in the "dressing" and then roasted them covered for about 30 minutes.  I left them uncovered and turned up the heat for the last part.  They were crispy and salty outside, tender and lemon-y inside.  Will make again!!

This recipe is delicious!  The first time I made it I didn’t have fresh mint, so I used 1/4 tsp of mint tea leaves and it was still addictive!  I decided to make these again one week later, but this time I have fresh mint (and I used 2 tsp) and I decided to reduce the oil from 3/4 of a cup to 2/3 of a cup because I thought it was too much the first time.  Also I used my favorite Feta which is “Vigo”; it’s super creamy and tasty without being overly salty like other brands and it’s 100% sheep’s milk which is authentic.

I did not have any fresh mint on hand. The cooking time was too long. Some of the potato wedges burned. The feta cheese sprinkled on top made this dish yummy, but it may have been too strong of a flavor for my kids.

These are fabulous. But be prepared for a long cook time! They're worth it though. I love to make these to go with Greek chicken kabobs and tzatziki sauce. Excellent meal with other fixings, too (olives, hummus, flatbread, salad). Delicious.
I did leave out the mint since I don't like mint very much.

This was really tasty. I drained some frozen spinach and mixed that in along with the feta and other ingredients then I put it in the oven. When I took the foil off I added fresh lemon juice and tossed the ingredients. Will make again!

These were a hit!! Made it for a party of 10 and everyone loved them! Didn't change a thing in the receipt except the oven time. Our oven is hotter so only cooked  for a total time of 60min.

I halved the recipe, mine were baked in 50 minutes, add lemon zest next time to make it more lemony.

Will make this again. Anytime! I used 3# red potatoes (cooking for 5) and scaled the rest of the ingredients. Turned out wonderfully. Rave reviews from the family!

These were so delicious! I used a bag of Yukon Gold type potatoes. I reduced the recipe to 6 servings so used 3lbs of potatoes and cut each one into 8 wedges. I normally cook my potatoes on a baking sheet, but I always like to follow recipes when I first try them so I used an 11x17 pyrex baking dish (but I wonder how big your dish would need to be with 5lbs of potatoes - mine was really full). I was worried that they wouldn't get brown but they turned out perfectly! I did cook them for the full time - 40 minutes, then added herbs and stirred, then another 40 minutes. I did not add additional water after the first 40 minutes as there was still liquid in the dish. Everyone loved them and I will definitely make again!

These are absolutely delicious! I used large yellow potatoes which I cut into 6 wedges each.  They came out perfectly cooked with a bit of crisp on the outside. I flipped them over halfway through cooking. I made the recipe exactly as written. Everyone loved them! A definite keeper!

I also mixed all the ingredients together and poured on top of the chicken and it turned out great! Very tender and tasty and much less labor intensive that breading the chicken. Plus, you don't have to worry about the breading falling off and you get the same flavor. Next time I'll add Parmesan cheese to give it an Italian twist. I served with roasted Greek potatoes and roasted broccoli. Easy and delicious meal!

I make this regularly for my family--it's really, really (really) good.   I've never made it with feta or mint (just because I rarely have it around), and it's still great without those ingredients.  Just make sure and plan in advance, because there's really no way to hurry along the 1.5+ hour cook time (although, now that I am reviewing the other reviews, I see that people are doing a little microwaving first--great idea).  I scale the recipe down to accommodate 3 pounds of potatoes and cut them in medium size chunks (rather than wedges).

This was really good. The potatoes were a lot of crispier than I liked but they were still devoured. I altered the recipe just a tiny bit by using goat cheese instead of feta (since we didn't have any lying around) and tossing in some halved cherry tomatoes- all served with a drizzle of olive oil. Will make again!

I didn't change much of the recipe while marinating the potatoes, the main thing I changed was the way I cooked the potatoes.  I have a vertical roaster which I placed my chicken on in the middle of a serving dish.  Around the chicken I placed the marinated potatoes (and eggplant that I marinated with the potatoes) and added 1/4 of chicken broth+the marinade to the potato-eggplant pieces.  While the chicken roasted, so did the potato-eggplant pieces.  After the chicken was done baking (~3 hours), I took out the p-e pieces and placed them on a baking sheet and just low-broasted them for 15 minutes.  The chicken and p-e pieces were gone before I could even get a piece… so I'm assuming this recipe was fantastic.  Much positive applause from the guests.

Didn't use all the water, just 1T & 1 tsp total.  Also didn't have fresh mint, but used dried so it did have some mint flavor.  Since it was hot outside we used our electric grill to cook these instead of warming up the house. Will make again.

My family loves this recipe! My changes were to completely omit the water - it is unnecessary and it would seem that it extends the cooking time.  I had this done in about 45 min at 450 or 1 hr at 425; I have done it both ways.

As a Greek, I appreciate this recipe a lot. It is exactly how I make it (with the exception of mint; I don't use it with my roasted potatoes)... Anyway, this recipe is simple and delicious! Thanks a lot!

My daughter loved these but without the mint & feta.  We didn't have 80 minutes of baking so I had microwaved a medium size red potatoes for 4 min each side.  We preferred these to be pan fried best or cut it in 8th and bake it that way.

I loved these.  I made to go with Mediterranean Chicken Packets from the food network site. I was out of mint so I did not add but would like to try with next time.  Mine did stick to the foil so next time I will make sure I spray the foil really good before baking.  I will make these again.

I've made these several times and they are extremely good. I would suggest keeping an eye out on them, as I believe the cooking time suggested is WAY too long, you end up with a lot of burned potatoes.

Loved these, but left out the mint (sort of ambivalent about it).  I used one large lemon (because I don't measure much) so whatever that produced was enough to give just a hint of lemon to the potatoes.  Lots of oregano, and I also used some prepared Greek seasoning I saw while shopping for this recipe.  Garlic is a must and I left in the water to better distribute the lemon juice.. the oil alone does create a crispier potato, but I think you don't get the same sort of flavor distribution you want.    Feta at the end adds a sharp, delicious tang.  If you like feta, you'll be glad you added it, but if you don't, skip it, the potatoes stand on their own.

The feta makes a really nice addition to this dish.  I would serve this as a side dish for company.  I did add some red pepper flakes and didn't use any water.  Clubhouse has a great Greek blend out that had great flavors in this dish.

Best potatoes ever!!!  I added the feta 20-30 minutes before they were done to brown it a little... Delicious!!!!

I pretty much winged this recipe and eyeballed everything so I can't say much for the ingredient proportions... BUT the flavors together are awesome! I didn't think I'd like the mint, but definitely try it, these potatoes were great with!

Great recipe.  I didn't have feta but is was still terrific (next time I'll do it with the cheese).  My only alterations were using boiling water to start things off and i added the garlic along with the herbs as I don't like the taste of charred garlic.  Thanks!

This turned out really great!  I've used other recipes before, but they never turned out.  I thought the amounts of the ingredients were right on in this recipe.  Thanks
