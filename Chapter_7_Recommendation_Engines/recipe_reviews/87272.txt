I made a few changes that made this wonderful.  First when making the dressing, I used only 1/3 cup sugar.  It is plenty.  If you want to use Splenda to make it sugar free that would work as well.  I will probably try that next time.  I also used olive oil instead of  vegetable oil.  Instead of the Chicken Ramen Noodles, I used Oriental.  This flavor seems to compliment this recipe more so.  One last change I made to the dressing was adding the packet of orienal seasoning mix to the actual dressing and not the nut mix.  This makes it much more flavorful.  When I sauteed the nut mix I only used 1/4 cup butter.  Just trying to cut back on the fat and it works!  My kids love this!

I just made this and it is wonderful.  I would give it a ten if I could!  I do have some tips that I hope will help-break the noodles up into small pieces so they toast evenly, make sure the sugar is well blended into the dressing ingredients, add the dressing a little at a time to the salad mixing well after each addition and make this in a very large bowl.  I did toast the nuts separately and advise that you wait until the nuts and noodles are cool before adding them to the slaw.

Loved it, but I made some changes that we delightful.
Too lazy to prep broccoli, so I used broccoli slaw.
Cut sugar to 1/3 cup on advice of other reviewers.
Substituted cashews and pistachios because I didn't have almonds and sunflower seeds.
Added about 1 c. of sliced grapes (someone else did this, and it sounded good...could have cut sugar even more).
Took it to a church meal and got rave reviews, and I'm ready to make up a batch for another event this weekend.  
Love it, and so easy...

LOVE this salad!! I made this yesterday along with "The Best Baked Chicken" for a cookout. Both this salad and the chicken were the hits of the cookout and had no leftovers!! I switched it up a bit. I had to double the recipe for the amount of people at the cookout, so instead of broccoli I used 2 bags of Broccoli Slaw and 1 bag of cole slaw. I also added a splash of balsamic vinegar to the dressing for a little kick. I will be making this for years!!!

Unique and yummy-like a crispy asian coleslaw! Made it for the 4th of July and it really stands out from blah traditional pasta salad/potato salad/coleslaw. After reading all the reviews, this is what I did:I used the oriental flavored noodles, and also only put 1/2 of 1 flavor packet on the noodles and almonds as they cooked; the rest I put into the dressing. I also used a little less than 1/3 cup of sugar and I thought it was just sweet enough. Couldn't find unsalted sunflower seeds, so I used about 1/2 cup of seasame seeds instead. I substituted about 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar in the 1/4 cup of cider vinegar, and I used less than half of a small head of red and green cabbage, and maybe less than half a cup of shredded carrots instead of bagged coleslaw. Everyone loved it and have already requested that I make it for future get togethers.

you definitely do not need all that butter.  I used 1/2 and probably could have cut down more (don't need any butter for the nuts but not sure about the noodles.  next time I might do them separate to save on calories).  I used evoo in dressing and also used 1/2 of that.  I don't think you need that much sugar either.  I would even add more broccoli next time - cut it up really small.  it was yummy.  used oriental raman noodles  and it was good- chicken would be good too I think. thanks!

Did you know that there are 7 grams of fat and 190 calories in one serving of ramen noodles?  And the ramen noodle people try to tell us that there are 2 servings in each package.  Now I don't know about anyone else, but I can put away one whole package with no trouble at all.  So even though this salad appears to be healthy, is isn't, not really.  But this salad is so darned delicious that it's worth it!  I did try to cut calories and fat a little by toasting the nut/noodle mixture in 2 tablespoons of butter instead half a cup.  I used 1/4 cup of splenda instead of the 1/2 cup of sugar, and I only put about a third of a cup of oil in the dressing, I made up the difference with water.  I don't know how these changes affected the outcome of the salad, but they made me feel better.  The salad was still delicious and we enjoyed it immensely. Thanks for the post, Busy Mom of 3.  Excellent recipe!

I brought this to our block party and the bowl was licked clean!  I usually add sesame seeds to the crunchy mixture instead of sunflower seeds, but either would be good.  It's really important to assemble this salad right before serving it to avoid getting soggy-YUM!

Turned out excellent! I saw another recipe similar to this and combined the two. I used just shredded cabbage instead of the coleslaw mix and cut up my own carrots. I also used 3 packages of Ramen, but used only two of the three seasoning packets enclosed with the noodles (one seasoning pack i mixed with the dressing and the other to cook with the noodles.) Great served with grilled chicken and i might have a light peanut sauce on the side. Thanks for the recipe!

Oh My!   What a delicious cole slaw recipe.  I made this for a cookout with my very close friends and they "loved" it.  They now ask me for the recipe.  You will absolutely love this salad!

I was looking for a recipe to use sunflower seeds and found this one.  I'm glad I did because it's wonderful.  I used what I had on hand so I had to make some changes.  I used white wine vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar.  I also decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup and it was sweet enough for me.  I toasted the nuts and ramen in a few tbsps of butter instead of one stick because one stick seemed excessive.  This is a great recipe and one I will make again and again.

I made this last weekend for a family gathering and it went over really well!  Even with my husband, who would normally turn up his nose.  I added some pea pods from a bagged veggie mix that were left over and also some celery for a little more crunch.  I subbed the apple cider vinegar with half white wine vinegar and half balsamic.  Plus a splash of sesame oil, just because I love the flavor so much.  I will be making this again and again!

We all liked this salad but the 1/2 C butter is a bit excessive.  Next time I would cut that in half - just not necessary.  The dressing is really good. This makes alot of salad and it's not good the next day so keep that in mind.

This was a very tasty recipe... but I would delete the soy sauce.  I substituted teriyaki and I think it was too overpowering. I think soy sauce would've been too.  Otherwise, I think it was good.  I also added craisins and they gave it a nice touch.

I have literally  had this every day for lunch for the last 3 weeks! I modified the recipe a bit to make it lower in calories (less butter, half a package of ramen, 1/4 c. almonds and no seeds) and the dressing I make is mostly soy sauce, vinegar and truvia (instead of sugar). I keep the veggies, ramen/nut mix and dressing all seperate until the morning I make it for lunch and it stays for a few days. THANK YOU for posting this!!

I have to admit I tried this recipe mostly because the mixture of ingredients intrigued me.  And boy was I surprised at how wonderful this salad was.  I loved the crunch from the seeds, nuts and ramen noodles and I loved the mellowness of the coleslaw mix.  This was an awesome take on coleslaw and I can't wait to make this for all the summer picnics.  Thanks for sharing!

I've been looking for this recipe for years! It's excellent. I used the beef flavored Mr. Noodles (by accident, didn't realize the recipe called for chicken flavored), and it was great.

I really liked this salad.  It is quite easy to make and is packed with healthy veggies and vitamins (though the ramen noodles are not very healthy....).  I couldn't believe that so little sauce could add so much taste.  You could lessen the amount of sugar and oil and the salad won't suffer.

Great salad. I wanted a low-calorie salad so I used Splenda instead of sugar. I replaced about a tablespoon of olive oil for the 1/2 cup butter to toast the seeds. Worked great and didn't need the fat. I also used canola oil instead of vegetable as it is healthy. This really makes a guilt free salad and is so healthy for you.  Next time I will use 1/2 of the dressing on the salad as it is a lot of dressing. When I served this to guest they asked to go home with the healthy recipe as that was their favorite.  Enjoy and be healthy.

This is a fantastic recipe and went over great with our dinner guests, especially the women.  
I had to make a few adjustments as I didn't have a few ingredients.  I used a 1:1 mix of rice wine and white vinegar in place of the apple cider and I used walnuts instead of almonds.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T and it was EXCELLENT!  Served this salad with dill steamed rice and sesame thai grilled salmon :)

I love this salad and every time I take it to a gathering others ask me for the recipe.  I change it up by adding other vegetables, like red, yellow and orange peppers for added color.  I also like to replace the almonds with walnuts.  I usually keep the nut/ramen mixture separate and add it just before serving  depending on how many are being served, I then have some left for the next day (I find that the ramen noodles get soggy if mixed and kept overnight).  I will also use the nut/ramen mixture on a regular green salad with craisins.

This was a big hit. I tried it with ramen and without, and preferred it without. I reduced the sugar by about 1/4, and added sesame oil and sesame seeds.

My family really enjoyed this salad. A great way to get broccoli into the diet.
If you don't have ramen packages on hand, you can use chicken buillion granuals and celery or chinese noodles for crunch.

This was an excellent hit at our Thanksgiving luncheon.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed this unique coleslaw and there were no leftovers.  Next time I'll be making double the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I usually do not like anything Asian.  However, I thought I'd give this a try due to my dinner guest are big fans of Asain flavor.  WOW!   I have made with both chicken flavored and Asain flavored Ramon noodles-- and prefer Asain flavored as another reviewer suggested.  Great textures and flavors.  I have been asked multiple times for the recipe. Great served by itself or with a bowl of soup.  You will want seconds!

My mother-in-law makes a salad very similar to this-I wanted to make it and couldn't get a hold of her for the recipe so I looked on this website.  I love this recipe!! (even better than Mom's) :)  I used about a cup of broccoli slaw instead of broccoli, 5 1/2 TB of butter, 1 chicken flavored pkg and 1 oriental flavored pkg ramen noodles (it's what I had on hand), and only 1/3 cup of sugar.  Very delicious  Thanks Busy Mom for the easy, fast recipe!!

This was wonderful. I made it for a tailgate, and just kept separate ziplock bags for the coleslaw mixture/ dressing/ dry ingredients. I mixed them when it was time to serve, and I got rave reviews!

Yum! This was a delicious addition to a dinner of chicken pitas. I cut this recipe in half as it was only the three of us. I didn't have a bag of cole slaw mix but I did have a 1/2 head of cabbage and a 1/2 head of napa cabbage. I shredded those in place of the cole slaw mix. I also used Oriental ramen as suggested by a previous reviewer. A great salad that I can't wait to make for a potluck. I am sure it will be a hit.

I made this 2 nights ago, and my family and I love this recipe. I used broccoli slaw instead of coleslaw and half the amount of butter to lighten it up a bit. The salad disappeared very fast and everyone can't wait to have it again.

This was a delicious salad.  It went with all of our leftovers for the week and the kids never tired of it nor did the adults.  I will use the dressing recipe from now on for any kind of slaw.  It is the best I have made yet.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! You can half the recipe to feed a few or double it to feed a crowd. Everyone who tries this asks me for the recipe. A big hit at potlucks and the leftovers are still crunchy the next day. This is much better than regular cole slaw. Thanks for sharing!

This was really really great! I didnt have a slaw mix so i chopped 1/4 head of cabbage and it worked fine. The only thing i may change about this recipe id that it is a little on the sweet side so i'd omit some sugar, and maybe add a little more vinegar.

I made this again tonight for the 2nd time. Love, love, love it! I cut down on the broccoli, and only used 1 pkg. ramen noodles, and half the sauce ingr's. I added more soy sauce (cos I love it), salt, pepper, and a dash of sesame oil. Tonight I found hubby had eaten all the sunflower seeds, so I used white and black sesame seeds instead. This recipe is a definite keeper!!

Awesome recipe, tasted great! I made some changes with my 2nd batch to make it a bit healthier and it still tastes wonderful. *no butter, olive oil only. I added a small amt to skillet and probably 1/4c for the dressing base. *1 pkg of ramen with 1 seasoning pack. *2 tablespoons of white sugar. *reduced sodium soy sauce. From there I just eye-balled the dressing amount, added a few tablespoons of water to stretch it (taste as you go). I used slivered almonds because that's all I had and added some black poppy seeds at the end. I mix it the day before (all of it) and think it tastes best after setting a day. I think next time I'm going to add raisins!

LOVE this "salad". Made a QUADRUPLE recipe for my sister's graduation party over the summer and it was completely gone! About 10 people asked me for this recipe. I did follow some of the other reviews and used way less sugar in the dressing. Only about 2 tablespoons.

Made this recipe for 60 guests at a ladies luncheon yesterday. Seems it was a "hit" as a number of ladies asked for the recipe - and many more commented that the salad was delicious!  Do wait for the 'last minute' to add the dressing so that the ramen noodles maintain their crunch.   I used 5 bags of coleslaw mix & 4 large bunches of broccoli - had some left over even with a generous serving of about 3/4 cup each.  I only used 1 package of noodles for each bag of coleslaw and went VERY light on the packaged soup mix for seasoning (which has a very strong, salty chicken flavour).  I cut back on the onions as the ladies were playing bridge afterward (ha ha). Also, just drizzled butter on the almonds, sunflower seed, noodle mixture and roasted it in the oven. Thanks for a great salad idea!

What a wonderful salad!!! I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it... even the men. The only change I made was using cashews instead of the almonds and sunflower seeds. This will definately replace my old coleslaw recipe!!

This made a ton; I was hoping for leftovers but my family licked the bowl clean!  I made the following adjustments due to my son's nut and shellfish allergies:  I eliminated the almonds and used David brand roasted/salted/shelled sunflower seeds. Instead of using the ramen flavor packets (due to possible shellfish warning)  I used 2 tsp. of powdered chicken boullion.

I liked this dish but I would like to try it with the oriental noodles as suggested.  I halved the butter and next time I will toast each of the toasted items separately.  I didn't burn any of it this time, but I was worried about it the entire time since the sunflower seeds seemed to get darker before anything else.

Loved this salad!  I've been making a napa salad very similar to this for years and loved it to death, but wanted to try something a little different.  This was similar, yet slightly different.  I used broccoli slaw the first time I made it and it was delicious!

This was soooo yummy!!!  I bought only 1/2 c. of the slivered almonds.  Instead of sunflower seeds I had pine nuts (and only 1/2 cup of those).  My Mom (68), 2 kids (13 and 15), and I (45) loved the salad.  I'm curious as to how the leftovers keep.  It's probably going to be soggy.  What a great salad!!

This was really very good, however, it was a little sweet for my taste.  reducing the sugar by half, and adding some red pepper flakes would take it over the top.  It's a keeper!

WOW! I really liked this. Very unusual and totally delicious. I made half the recipe, took it to a church picnic, but still had some left. So, didn't get the same response as some of the other reviewers. BUT I found a new salad that I'll go to often! Thanks Busy Mom of 3!

Crunchy, light and fresh! Very nice change from plain old coleslaw! I did decrease the amount of butter used by about half.  I mixed one packet of seasoning in with the nuts and noodles and the other in the dressing.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was awesome!  Really delicious!  I added some precooked chicken into the ramen/nut mix and like other reviews I added only half of one seasoning packet to this mixture, so there was 1 1/2 package in the dressing. Also used on 1/3 cup sugar.  Thank you, can't wait to make this again!

I love this alternative to traditional "creamy" coleslaw.  I made some changes: instead of a package, I use 1/2 large head cabbage and 2 shredded carrots; I skip the ramen/butter thing, and I make the dressing with 3 T honey in place of the sugar.  I also used sesame seeds instead of sunflower.  This is a great raw food recipe, too, as long as you use raw oils, vinegar & honey for the dressing.

This was an excellent salad. There is such an interesting variety in textures! Even the next day when the noodles went soft, it was still delicious. Also, there is a perfect amount of dressing...not too much and not too little.

Yum, yum!  I didn't use the coleslaw mix, but rather shredded 1 small head of green cabbage and two carrots.

This is a keeper.

This is fabulous!!!! I always have people ask me for this recipe. I occasionally instead, use a bag of broccoli cole slaw and instead of sunflower seeds sometimes I use sesame seeds. Still that fabulous taste to die for.

This is a very good salad that went well with 'Asian Barbeque Burgers' from AR.  To help cut the calories, I did not brown the nut/noodle mixture in the butter.  Instead, I toasted them in the oven for 10 minutes at 250°.  I made a half a recipe using an partial head of cabbage that I sliced as thin as I could get.  The broccoli was a nice addition and I added a little carrot, just for color.

Absolutely delicious if eaten the first day.  After that the "crunchies" go soft and soggy.   If you don't intend to eat all this salad the first day, only put the crunchies on the portion you plan on serving.

Delicious!  I even changed a lot to make it a bit healthier and to suit my food allergies - substituted liquid stevia for the sugar, used 1/2 the amount of butter, omitted ramen noodles & seasoning, and omitted the soy sauce - and it was still delicious!

I DID alter the recipe a little….see bottom.

The best salad out there, doesn't matter the time of year, occasion, etc…it's always a hit.  My roomie had never had it before, said she prob wouldn't like it, I came home from work and it was gone  :) It's so easy to fix, cheap for crowd and/or potluck dinner, etc.  AND if it starts getting low I simply crush up a pack or two more of ramen noodles, no cooking or toasting, and add them to the bowl, they blend right in and the fresh crunch is delicious! 

Changes made:  There's no way you need 1/2 cup butter, I use a wok to do the noodles, etc and only use 1/4 or so, you can always add if you need to.
sunflower seeds are used if I have them, if not the salad toppings mixture you can buy is delicious in moderation. I reduce the sugar to 1/4 and actually INCREASE the part apple cider vinegar(/veggie oil mixture), just to taste, I like the tanginess.  Soy sauce can also be added to taste in my opinion, but 1tsp is perfect to start.  Just depends on how much flavor you like.  

It's my favorite to keep in the house, great in every way, THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!

Made this salad for a birthday, everyone loved it! Since I more than doubled the recipe, I made a few changes. Added a red bell pepper for color, shredded the cabbage myself. I only used half of the sugar for the dressing and less butter for toasting. Since I couldn't find unsalted sunflower seeds, I used mostly unsalted soy nuts and added only a few sunflower seed kernels to the dry mix. - This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing it.

I had to make a few adjustments due to lack of ingredients.  I used a vidalia onion instead of green onions & pine nuts instead of sunflowers seeds & almonds.  It was super even with the adjustments.

YUMMY change from mayo laden slaw.  I seemed rather awkward trying to break up the ramen  noodles they don't break apart easily.   Unfortunately because I was distracted I burned the noodles and nuts first time through.  Luckily I had extra almonds and just used those with the slaw (I used a combo of broccoli slaw and regular slaw) and dressing combo.  Very delicious, even better the next day after flavors are blended.    A do over for sure in this house!  UPDATED:  Since I prefer not to use the ramen noodles, this time I toasted the almonds and added them to the slaw mix.  I however did not add the melted butter as i did not use it in the recipe.

Our group of 8 devoured it with generous helpings and repeats.  I halved the amount of green onion and sugar.  Didn't have slivered almonds, so I chopped a cup of raw almonds I had on hand.  Worked just fine.  Otherwise kept it true to recipe.  This one's a keeper.

By far this is the BEST salad ever!!  I didn't use the full 1/2 cup of sugar, and it was perfectly sweet.  I also used the broccoli slaw, added one packet of the oriental ramen seasoning to the dressing, and added a dash of balsamic.  Thank you so much for sharing!!

I love this salad and have now made it 4 times....and everyone always tells me it's the best coleslaw they have ever had!  I spice it up with chili oil when I toast the nuts, and have also tried it with sesame seeds and pine nuts as substitutions - all good.  I remove the noodles and butter and just use either chili oil or sesame oil.  yummy!!

This recipe is wonderful.  I didn't have almonds or sunflower seeds on hand so ued dry-roasted peanuts instead.  I love the ramen noodles mixed in. A big hit... will do this again (and again and again).  Thanks!

This salad rocks!  We added chunked chicken to it for a little extra protein and it was fabulous.  Wouldn't make any changes.

I made this for a group of 16 people...some of who are VERY picky.  EVERYBODY loved this! It makes a big bowl, but it was wiped clean.  Definitely try this.  I used "oriental" flavor Ramen noodles and 1/2 cup butter.  Delicious!

An interesting combo.  I liked this overall but thought it was WAY too salty from the ramen spice pack.

I did not like this, however others did.  It has a strong nut flavor, and I used maybe 1/2 of the amt called for. I dont think I'll make again. I did use broccoli slaw, instead of coleslaw and broccoli chopped. I dont think I like ramen noodles raw.

After reading the reviews I decided to try this recipe out on my family. The taste is great. My kids (while I was making this) kept turning up their noses at this salad, but couldn't leave it alone once everything was mixed together. Very delicious!

Very, very good recipe. Each Grey Cup football match, I'm asked to bring cole slaw. Each time, I bring one from ALLRECIPES. They loved this one. Several said it was a unique, tasty side-dish to the baby backs.

Took this to a work meeting and it disappeared instantly! I didn't use the 1/2  cup of sugar only 1/3 and that was plenty. Also used sesame seeds instead of sunflower seeds. Everybody asked for the recipe!

I give mixed reviews on this one.  I thought it was a nice change of pace but not something that I would probably make again.  About half the people I served it to liked it and half didn't.

I loved this, my BF on the other hand was not impressed, but this is coming from someone who doesn't like veggies, I on the other hand don't like coleslaw, this will now become my coleslaw of choice and will be made again, love the nuts and crunch.  Thanks for the recipe.

I gave this 3 stars because I didn't find it all that wonderful...but, it also wasn't terrible.  It was just...so-so.  The recipe calls for a LOT of butter, so if you make this, I recommend halving it...but even considering that, it just was too weird to me.  I thought it sounded like an odd mix of ingredients when I decided to make it but judging from the other reviews I thought it would come together differently.

We tried this recipe for 4th of July get together and it was a big hit.  Very easy to make and the bowl was empty when the party was over. I didn't use the coleslaw mix as my husband doesnt eat that part and it was still great.

This was a very good salad.  The only thing I didn't like about it was adding the seasoning mix of the ramen noodles.  Whereas it tasted good with the toppings, there's something about adding that processed season mix to a healthy salad that just doesn't seem right.  I'd like to try adding my own seasonings in the future.  But everyone liked it, so I have to give it a good rating.    The dressing was excellent, but to make it healthier, I cut the sugar in half.  I also cut the butter in half when browning the nuts and ramen noodles.

I love this salad, it's amazing and so delicious. I used Asian Ramen. Also, just got a head of green and a head of purple cabbage & just used 1/2 of each. Also grated a few carrots in there. Not many people ate it cause I don't think coleslaw is real popular, so I took it home and ate it for days!

Excellent! Used broccoli slaw instead of separate coleslaw and broccoli and also slightly less sugar as suggested. My teens loved the leftovers; may keep some nuts and noodle mixture aside or make extra to add to leftovers next time.

this was an excellent choice for our clambake/potluck at camp. Many people raved about it,and many asked me for the recipe.. My husband made me save a bowl of it before I brought it to our function. I did use oriental ramen noodles. and I also cut back on the butter and sugar

Outstanding!  Welcome change from the soggy, mayo drenched slaw you get in restaurants.  I also cut down on the butter and sugar and it was still delicious!  This is the ONLY cole slaw recipe I'll use from now on.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!

I just made this and it is unbelievably good! It tastes like a restaurant salad. The two different guests I had both took some home with them because they wanted more! 
I left out the onions, used only one oriental ramen noodle, 1/2 the butter and 1/2 the sugar.  Make it, you won't be sorry!

Pretty good. I added tahini and sesame oil to the dressing and sesame oil to the toasting Ramen. Pepitas, nuts and seeds added and dressed before serving. Didn't have broccoli. Like the idea of mandarin orange added.

This was interesting! I did cut the butter in half but added a bit of  EVOO. I also used a mix of broccoli slaw and power slaw  ( Brussels, kohlrabi, carrot, red cabbage, kale) from local grocery. I did cut the sugar in half but added mandarin oranges ( 2-11oz cans in light syrup) and about 1/8 cup craisins because that's all I had. The topping was salty but the sweetness of the salad played well together. Definitely will do again. So many things can be added to compliment events! Thank you!!!

I'll probably never prepare regular slaw again.  Made the 6 serving recipe to take to a friends house tomorrow for a get together.  Kept wet   (slaw and dressing) and dry ingredients (seeds and noodles) separate.  Dished some out for a taste test.  It was so good that I didn't stop until it was obvious that I will have to make another batch tomorrow.  

Made some changes:  Used cabbage and broccoli slaw...Did not add broccoli florets...Grated some carrots ...Did not have soy sauce and subbed  a bit of Mandarin sauce for flavor...Left out the seasoning packet... Decreased sugar to 2 1/2 tablespoons...Eyeballed the amount of margarine until it barely covered the bottom of my pan  Next time I will probably do my toasting in the oven and may add some raisins to the salad..

This was excellent. Used only half the butter and half the oil. Added 1/4 cup apple juice to the dressing to make up for the oil.  Leftovers held up well even the next day. My husband and I have been dipping into it. Will be making this one often.

If you'll notice in the photo, this recipe should have mandarin oranges. I've made it for years and the oranges are a must have. Also, to make it a little healthier without losing any flavor, I have never used butter nor the chicken flavored packets that come with the ramen. Not necessary. Cooked and cubed (or sliced) chicken breast added makes this a delicious main dish! One teaspoon sesame oil in place of the soy sauce gives it great flavor!

I really liked it but would cut back on the sugar, it was rather sweet. One thing I did notice was there were mandarin oranges in the picture but they were not mentioned in the recipe.

We cut down on the sugar in the dressing and it works out great.

Yummmmm! I made this last night using other reviewers' recommendations by using the Oriental seasoning and adding the mandarin oranges.  I also forgot to pick up sunflower seeds so I just used extra almonds and it was A HIT!!!  

 I served it to everyone at our party and I had people asking me for the recipe!  One of the guests wants to make it to take to a pot luck at the school she works at because she said she "wanted to impress" her coworkers :-)

I HIGHLY recommend the Oriental Ramen.   I added one of the packets to the noodles and nuts, then the other one in the dressing. Oh, and speaking of the dressing...you really don't need all of that sugar!  I cut it down to less than half.  It's just unnecessary .   I also highly recommend adding in a large can of mandarin oranges (No sugar added).  It really freshens up the overall dish.

I've had similar salads and IMO this one is too heavy on the butter and nuts.  (Although I did get many compliments when I brought it to a party!) Next time I will eliminate the butter and roast the nuts in the oven after I've reduced the amount by half.

Amazing salad! I'm not a huge coleslaw fan so I use Dole chopped salad Asian blend. Also took advice from other reviews and reduced butter and sugar to 1/3 cup. Lots of compliments!

Yum! I substituted oriental flavored ramen, used broccoli slaw and added one yellow, orange and red bell pepper to replace the broccoli. I also added salad shrimp and mandarin oranges, I believe the oranges are a must. My only two qualms were that the seed/nut/noodle blend doesn't toast evenly at all and my sunflower seeds were burnt before my almonds were toasted. Also, this dressing is great but WAY too sweet... Think I'll add extra vinegar and citrus next time.

Loved the ingredients but the sugar needs to be cut down.  Shredded a mixture of green cabbage and carrots.

I tried this for the first time to take to Easter dinner.  I had to try it the night before because it smelled so good, and I wanted to try it before anyone else.  I have read alot of the reviews and alot of other recipes that are similar to this... So this i why I want to put in my review.  I didn't use pre-shredded cabbage, just because I needed to make more.  So I used about 1/2 small head of red & the same of green cabbage, shredded 2 carrots, then instead of white vinegar 1/2 white and 1/2 balsamic vinegar.  I added about 1/2 cup diced red onions because they were already cut.  1 1/2 stalk of celery diced.  I remembered all the different recipes so I got home from the grocery store with 1/2 cup sliced almonds and 1/2 cup salted sunflower seeds.  I only had 1 oriental, 1 chicken and 1 creamy chicken Ramen.  I used the oriental in all the liquid, mixed well and added a little salt and pepper then mixed into veggies.  The other two packets I mixed into the ramen, almonds & sunflowers seeds and then sauteed for about 7 minutes in 1/2 cup butter.  I had some Bran/Sesame sticks on hand so I topped the salad after ,mixed together and it was the BOMB!!  Thank you I will make this again as a MAIN dish with chicken!

AB so LUTEly delicious.  Had no broccoli, used packaged Cole slaw, took pchbloom's suggestion to add mandarin oranges sections to the salad.
Just had a bowl full, am about to have some more.  Everything works together so well.  Thank you for the recipe, Busy Mom of 3.

I just made this salad exactly as written.  It is really yummy!  This makes a really large salad so be sure to use a big bowl.  It would be perfect to take to a party or to a church gathering.  Thank you Busy Mom for contributing this awesome recipe.

I really like this salad a lot.  I blanched the broccoli, since I'm not a real fan of the texture of it raw.  Added shredded carrot for color, flavor and nutrition.  For the dressing I used much less sugar and more soy (didn't measure), black pepper and a touch of cayenne, just my taste.  Used less butter to toast the crunchies and it worked fine, I'd say I used about 3 TBS (but I halved the recipe so that was for 1 pkg ramen).  My sunflower seeds were already roasted and salted, so I didn't add them to the pan, but simply added them to the salad with the other crunchies.  I'd give the salad after my tweaks 5 stars but only 4 here, and that is solely because I don't like the dressing so much as written.  This is a lovely salad I'll make often.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I made it last night and it disappeared so quickly, so by popular demand I made it again!!  The taste is  out of this world!  A whole new twist for coleslaw!  The ramen noodles and almonds added that crunch factor.  The dressing gave it an oriental flavour, sweet and tangy!  I cut the sugar to 1/3 and took a shortcut with the broccoli by just quickly heating frozen broccoli and running cold water to stop the cooking.  (Didn't have fresh broccoli.).   It's superb!  Just wanted to thank you for taking the time to share this rare and delicious recipe!    Judy.

Great new way to make coleslaw....can be a healthier alternative to traditional mayo-based coleslaw if prepared correctly. Gave this 4 stars because I think it has unnecessary fat as written (adds nothing relevant to the flavor & is not necessary).  Recommend toasting the noodle/sunflower seeds/almonds without butter (place in toaster oven, stir as needed & watch carefully). Use slightly less than 1/3 cup olive oil for dressing & make up the difference with toasted sesame oil. I chose to sub Splenda for sugar & used only 1/3 cup; also, I subbed a bag of broccoli slaw for the head of broccoli. Very unique, crunchy & healthy barbeque-worthy salad that even my very picky kids enjoyed. Thanks Busy Mom of 3!!!!

SO good!  To cut calories you can even omit the ramen noodles and nuts and it is still amazing.  I added 1 carrot to the mix, and put pepper and cayenne pepper in the dressing.  Also omitted the butter completely and just broiled the nuts/ramen til lightly brown.  I put the ramen seasoning in the dressing.  Also cut down on both sugar and olive oil (which I used instead of vegetable oil).

My mom's favorite....we all love this and can't get enough of it!  Note:  it makes a lot so if you put the dressing on and have leftovers, it will spoil the entire batch (as vinegar will wilt it sitting there).  I like to serve this w/the dressing on the side OR in "halves".  Meaning - depending on how many people - instead of putting the dressing on the entire batch, I will serve half the batch (and toss w/half the dressing) and put the other half of each in the fridge until needed.

I'm going to make this on Sunday for a family BBQ. Just wondering if anyone has substituted the apple cider vinegar with apple juice. I never have apple cider vinegar in the house but always have apple juice.
