I only made one substitution--I used Splenda brown sugar blend instead of regular brown sugar. Holy frijoles, this is brilliant. The best breakfast I've had in a LONG time.

All righty then. This is great, but for all of you BURNING the grapefruit, try this.  Put it in the microwave oven.  It works ever soo well, and in under 2 minutes. The crispness is STILL there. I do it this way in the Summer, soo as not to have to turn on the Broiler, as well,  I do  it this way for a dessert as well.  Cheers NV

Simple and delicious! I love apple crisp so why not a grapfruit crisp? Well, I wasn't disappointed. I usually just eat these things cold with a bit of Splenda, but this was really nice change. I used light butter and added a little nutmeg along with the cinnamon. As with anything you but in a broiler you have to watch it carefully so it doesn't burn. Everyone's oven is differnent, so use the 10 minutes as a guide - it may take less time than that.

I was skeptical of this because I am not much for warm fruit. I couldn't stop thinking about this though once I read the recipe because I was curious as to how it tasted. Ingredient wise - I did not change a thing. I did follow others reviews and baked at 350 for 10 minutes. Final product: I LOVED it! This a great breakfast that can be made quickly. I saved 1/2 the grapefruit and oatmeal mixture for tomorrow's breakfast. Thanks for a great recipe!

I enjoyed this, even though I do not like grapefruit!  If you are making for only one person, you can easily refrigerate half the grapefruit and half the topping.

I tried this on a whim this morning, as I like oats and cinnamon, and I adore grapefruit. I made it exactly how the recipe called for (except I omitted the salt), but only one half. Broiling it burnt the  out of the topping, so I took out the rest of the topping and the second half and tried it again, baking it at 350 for 10 minutes. Came out nicely that time. It's interesting, but I don't think I'd make it again. Something about the sweetness of the topping and the tartness of the fruit don't really go together all that well!

This is a nice change from the ususal grapefruit for breakfast. It's so yummy and tastes just like a crisp! I have a very hot oven so when I broiled it, it burnt the top in no time so I tried just baking it at 350 and worked perfect.

My broiler burnt my topping too so I used others recommendations & baked at 350 for 10 to 15 minutes, just keeping an eye on it, then used the broiler to crisp up the topping.  YUMMY!

I happened to stumble across this recipe while eating a grapefruit that I had already peeled. I decided to just mix everything up in a bowl and broil it. It was such a nice treat! I did use my homemade pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon & skipped the salt. Eyeballed most of the ingredients since I only had about 1/2 of the grapefruit left. My oven has a low broil setting so I used that for about 4 minutes. It probably could have gone longer, but I was hungry. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this, and my husband finished his serving and said it was "pretty good for a grapefruit" which is VERY high praise from him. For me the recipe as written made twice as much topping as I strictly need as I didn't want to put so much on there that it would fall off. 4 minutes on Lo on my broiler burnt it just the tiniest bit so in the future I'd probably just bake it at 450 for 10 minutes. Thanks for the recipe, we'll be using this one all week!

Excellent flavor! However, it was rather difficult to get the meat of the grapefruit away from the rind making it hard to eat.  Next time I'll pull the fruit away from the rind and cut it in sections before baking it in the rind.

put the broiler on low.  Don't microwave it. It didn't crisp for me, just soggy.

Well even tho I dont like grapefruit, I am going off of what my husband said since he likes grapefruit.  We both thought it was alright.  I did like the crumb topping!  Just not on top of a grapefruit.  My husband said he liked it better cold.  I did sprinkle more sugar over the top to caramelize.  If this was on another fruit I would of probably liked it.  Oh well, I tried it at least!  Thanks for pointed out this recipe to try!  Im always looking for new ways to spruce up foods that Im not fond of!

This was okay.  I really love grapefruit and I love the topping, but together it didn't work for me.  I felt it took away from the flavour of the fruit itself and just made it taste sour. 
I might try it again and see what my husband thinks of it, but I'll take plain ol' grapefruit anyday

This is wonderful! However, if you like your grapefruit cold, like I do, make this an hour or two ahead and refrigerate.

Very Good! Quick and easy. I don't see how you can broil for 10 minutes. I used another's suggestion and lowered the temperature, but still cooked it for 10 minutes.

This would have been delicious, but mine burnt in under 4 minutes in the broiler. I also thought the topping was enough for 2 grapefruit. I added cloves and nutmeg. I will make it again, though, with changes.

Super simple yet super delicious... I never would have thought of this... the oven I used however burnt the granola topping right away so I turned the oven on to 350 to finish cooking... next time I think I will cook at 350 for 10-15 minutes and then brown it with the broiler if needed... the microwave method  for 2 minutes also seemed to do the trick... actually seemed to heat the fruit more thoroughly... however I don't think the granola was quite as good.... either way very simple and unique recipe

We enjoyed this different way to prepare grapefruit.   To avoid the burnt topping as mentioned by other reviewers I baked it in a 350 oven for 15 minutes and it worked out very well.  The topping was crisp and the grapefruit was hot throughout.

I was a little suspicious of this recipe but now I have no idea why. This is such a warm and delicious breakfast! Excellent when its cold outside and so quick, especially since I used a toaster oven instead.  Ever since I mentioned it, my mother reminds me that I have to make this for everyone when I visit.

really quick easy and good.  I've had this with just brown sugar before, the oat addition is great.  As with any food under the broiler, just keep your eye on it.

Oh my goodness!  Like others, I was not sure I'd like warm grapefruit, but it is GREAT!  If you are in doubt, try it.  I have eat it every morning for over a week now - even some evenings.  Can't get enough of it.  Thanks so much!

Tasty!  Broiling mine for about 3 minutes was enough for me... The top was almost burnt, but the grapefruit was still cold in some spots.  Next time I will try the baking method so that the grapefruit has enough time to get heated up without burning the top.

I really enjoyed the taste. Only, with my broiler I found that it got burnt before 6 minutes. So make sure you watch the time and if you can watch the grapefruit as it cooks. The smell is amazing.

Simple and great way to start the day.

I would recommend more than 6 inches for the oven rack and about 5 minutes cook time otherwise the oat and butter WILL burn.

I was REALLY hoping this would turn out well. I made it twice and both times it burnt. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, putting it 6 inches from the heat source. It not only burned, but it was on fire within 2 minutes of being in the oven. The grapefruit wasn't even warm and the oats were in flames. The second time I put the rack down further and it still burned within 2 minutes, though it wasn't on fire. I finally just put it in the microwave to warm it up and ate it since it was slightly less burnt than the first time. The oats were delicious, but I'm not sure how to get that crunchy-ness without burning it.

I don't love grapefruit, but we got several in our Bountiful Basket last week, so I needed some way to use them. This was pretty good. And with only 160 calories per serving, this recipe is good for my diet. 
I did microwave the grapefruit for 2 minutes, rather than broiling.
