I have made this over and over again since I found this recipe!  It's by far the best pork loin recipe I have found. I do omit the teaspoon of salt, I find the fish sauce and soy sauce give enough saltiness.

It was a delight! Just the right amount if spice. I BBQ'd it instead of frying, and I will definitely be preparing it again! Next time it will be for guests.

Delicious!  It is a bit spicy, and a tad salty, but if you take the chef's suggestion and put it inside a sandwich, this pork has just the right punch to shine through other ingredients.  I used whole wheat sub buns, spicy mayo, sliced cukes, julienned carrots and cilantro.  I did not add any extra sriracha, but I know some folks who would love the extra heat.  My mouth was happy with the sweet, salty, crunchy, spicy sandwich.  Thanks, Chef!

Too salty, drop the sea salt and could use some sweetness, maybe add brown sugar.

No changes made to this recipe except we used a pork butt instead of a loin because that's what we had on hand. A bit fattier but delicious just the same. Use it in the Chef John Vietnamese Sandwich, you won't be sorry. This recipe is a keeper.

Put al the ingredients for the marinade into a zip lock bag and mixed it up.  Then added pork cutlets to bag.  Marinated for 6 hours and cooked cutlets on indoor  grill (grill closed) for about 4 minutes.  Delicious with asparagus (also cooked on grill), applesauce and salad.  It is a really quick meal and delicious.

Excellent!!! Although I made a few changes... mine ended tasting like a teriyaki loin, but it was delicious! I just loved the idea of cutting the meat and creating surface to marinate.

Pretty good, easy. Didn’t have 5 spice so just added cinnamon and cloves. Let sit a few hours in ziplock. Baked until temp reached 430. Made Banh Mi sandwiches. Kids liked.

I cut the recipe in half and that was enough pork for 4 people. I cooked carrots, butternut squash cubes, sliced onions and mushrooms in a tsp or 2 of vegetable oil, in the same pan, before cooking the pork, then set them aside while cooking the pork.  I sliced the cooked pork and added it back to the pan, along with all of the remaining marinade and the veggies, heated for another minute or 2, until steaming hot, then served over jasmine rice. Delicious!  I had undercooked the pork slightly so that the reheating didn’t over cook it.

I always cut the 5 spice powder to 1/2 tsp.  I roast it in the oven at 500 degrees using a remote probe thermometer to get the perfect 140 internal degree perfection for the very best Bahn Mi sandwiches ever!

Excellent. The best pork loin that I can remember. I can't wait to make this recipie again. Sliced it over the white rice, just like in the video, great balance. New favorite pork dish.

I roasted it in the oven instead of pan frying.  Just a little dry, cooked a little bit too long.  The next day made it into gravey and was delicious over mashed potatoes.

I used pork tenderloin, marinated 2 hours in the refrigerator following the marinade ingredients except for the sriracha, which I used half the amount.  Served with coconut milk rice and sauteed zucchini & peppers in the same pan while the meat was resting.  Definitely will make again.

I followed directions except I put it on the grill. (too hot to cook inside) We thought it was delicious. Just the right amount of spice. I served it with a Thai Chili sauce, rice and an Asian slaw. Definitely making this one again. Thank you Chef John.

Ended up marinating it overnight and it was great.  Used it to make Vietnamese Subs.

Was wonderful.  I didn't cook mine in the iron skillet but on the grill.  Yummy and will do again, may add a touch of brown sugar.

I used boneless pork sirloin chops, etched partway through for the sake of the spicy, garlicy marinade, marinated at room temp for 30 minutes, cooked them for 5 minutes per side. Made with asperagus and rice, and my other half and I both enjoyed it very much. A keeper thanks to Chef John!
