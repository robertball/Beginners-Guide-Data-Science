This is a very smooth and easy to spread icing.  I chose this recipe because there was no milk in the house, and I had just baked a Crazy Cake(another recipe I found on this site).  They went together very well.  I'll be making this one again!

This wasn't at all what I was looking for-- it was a thick chocolate mess almost like ganache but not as smooth or sweet.  I had to add twice as much sugar, a tablespoon of milk and a teaspoon of vanilla to make it usable.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I'm sure there are other people who are looking for a very unsweet, straight chocolate icing. I just made a bad recipe choice based on the simple ingredient list and directions. (I was looking for "vanilla-chocolate powdered sugar frosting", which I HIGHLY recommend) I MIGHT use this one SPARINGLY (spread thinly) either between cookie sandwiches or on top of them but never on a cake.

This frosting was very yummy!!! The taste deserves a five but overall it earns a four. The frosting was very pretty and glossy but it took a while to get it to the right consistency. It took way more sugar than called for to make it perfect. I also added just a little bit of vanilla flavoring. Very yummy with chocolate cupcakes. I will never buy frosting from the store again. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was absolutely phenomenal. I was making a cake for my best friend's birthday and it was kind of late at night and I had no icing. So I looked on here for something easy with few ingredients, and I found this. So happy that I did.
I must point out, however, that it is VERY import to use real stick butter. The second time I made it with my boyfriend, it was watery because I used tub margarine. 

Also, this afternoon I used the recipe to make truffles. I decreased the amount of water to about 2 tbs. rather than 3, and didn't use the full 1 1/2 cup of powder sugar. The mix was  thicker so I made drops and put them on wax paper on a pan in the freezer, and after an hour they were perfect. Sprinkle with cocoa powder and powdered sugar. Bravo.

Rich in chocolate taste!  Was exactly what I needed to frost 9x9 brownies.  Didn't seem like enough for a full cake. I will definitely make again, but will double for a cake.

This recipe can be played with to get it right but as written this is a myriad of adjectives - gooey, grainy and greasy among them, and none of them what you want in a frosting.  What a shame, because it tasted great, almost like fudge!

Very easy to make.  I made it by hand, and was nont too tiresome.  And it tasted wonderful, and had a nice texture.

My ONLY contention with this recipe is that you definitely have to double it in order to frost 24 cupcakes, I think the original proportions are off. However, with that said, this might be the best chocolate frosting I have EVER had!!!!

Yum! I doubled this recipe and it was just barely enough to frost a 2-layer cake. It has a nice rich chocolate flavor without being overly sweet and sticky like store-bought frosting. I creamed the butter at room temp but after adding the cocoa, sugar, salt and water (and a little vanilla) it was a little too soft to spread properly so I refridged it for about 15 mins. It set up perfectly and was easy to spread on my chocolate cake. Absolutely delicious on "Sandy's Chocolate Cake" recipe on this site. Thanks for sharing such an easy recipe!

Tasted good, but there is no way that you would be able to frost a cake with this. You have to double to triple batch it.

This recipe did not work out very well for me. I don't think anyone else really liked it either. The consistency was a little difficult to work with. It piped well but did not spread well at all. I can not put my finger on what seems wrong, it could just be my error since others seem to like it, but I followed the directions exactly. I hope everyone else has better luck with this one than I did.

Beautiful glossy, dark finish. Very rich & fudge-like. I did use 1/2 cup extra powdered sugar (just to thicken a bit more for my preference) I used this to frost a pan of brownies.

This is the first frosting recipe I have found that actually gets the consistency I look for. Like others, I added in vanilla.  It tastes amazing. However, I gave it four stars for one reason.  I made the frosting exactly like the recipe and it turned out perfect, but there wasn't enough.  So I set out to make another batch.  The second batch was made exactly the same as the first batch, except this time I had to add DOUBLE the powdered sugar to get the right consistency.  No clue why one batch needed 1 1/2 C and one batch needed 3C.  They taste the same and look the same. So, four stars for inconsistency.

I made devil's food cupcakes with this frosting on top... yummmmm!  The only thing I changed was that I used margarine instead of real butter, and I added a tsp. of vanilla extract. It came out fine, tastes great, and because there is no butter, it will not spoil if left out at room temperature for a while...

My signature cake is usually devil's food with buttercream frosting so when my father-in-law requested chocolate frosting I needed a recipe. This is it!! I LOVE this chocolate frosting. It was quick and easy to make and it is delicious!! This will be my go-to chocolate frosting from now on. Also, I needed it to be lactose-free so I substituted Organic Smart Balance for butter and the results were fantastic. I also added 2 tsp vanilla just b/c I love the vanilla flavor. I did have to double the recipe (might need to triple it next time as it is so good!). Thanks for a delicious recipe!

the perfect super chocolately frosting you will always have the ingredients on hand to make! I topped my yellow cake mix. I should have doubled the recipe for my 13x9 pan to give a generous spread, but this will do.

This recipe came out quite rich and thick, so, as the directions said, I added another 1-2 Tablespoons of boiling water.  To tone down the rich cocoa flavor, I added about 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, then for creaminess I added about 2 Tablespoons of butter flavored shortening.  It turned out great!  It was still a little runny, but not watery or thick, and the cocoa wasn't overpowering.

I loved how easy this frosting was. I used it on brownies and would say the flavor was decent, nothing too exciting. But you figure when something is that easy how extravagant can it taste? I'll probably use this for "around the house" but if baking for others I would opt for something more flavorful.

as in other reviews, consistency is the main factor here. well worth playing with to get right though-- best chocolate frosting ever and SO spreadable! i too used way more sugar than called for to get nice and creamy. careful with your water too--- a little goes a long way here. i like 2 9" rounds, modified the servings to 36 and it yields plenty for the center and top/sides of a double layer.

This is a good stable frosting, but I used melted chips in place of the cocoa and it made it a bit more fudge-like.  It pipes really easily then stiffens into a fudge texture.  A big hit with the family!

Pretty tasty. I was actually out of coco powder, so I used hot chocolate mix instead. It was obviously sweeter.

This icing tastes almost exactly like the store-bought icing.  A little bit more bitter, but otherwise the same.  An excellent chocolate icing for cakes!

I chose this recipe because I was out of milk. I can't say I was expecting it to be very good but luckily I was wrong and it is actually a really good and simple recipe. The only change I make was adding a little vanilla and a sprinkle of brown sugar to the mix to give it a little more flavour.

Excellent fudgy-chocolate flavor and it makes enough to generously frost 12 cupcakes.    I didn't rate it 5 stars only because I had some issues with the texture initially--the frosting seemed thick, yet almost oily (I started with with room temp. butter, not sure if that was an issue or not) and it would not smooth out no matter how much I beat it.  I added about 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and 1 Tbsp. of milk and it smoothed out the texture and consistency almost magically.  I will probably use milk in place of the water in future batches. 

I received many compliments on this frosting!

This frosting is delicious and perfect for brownies.  I did substitute the cocoa powder w/ baker's choc/butter substitute. I think this helps to keep the frosting moist.

A very good recipe. It seems that some people had trouble with it, saying that it was too thick and lumpy. I had this problem too, so to remedy it I added some 2% milk a little at a time until it was spreadable. It seems to work better than adding water for me. Overall, it had a rich chocolate taste and went well with the cake I made it for.

Wow - definitely put Duncan Hines frosting to shame......added 1/2 tsp vanilla, and used 1/2 part shortening to 1/2 part margarine (didn't have butter on hand). Was absolutely PERFECT!! Thanks for the keeper!

I'm not usually a big frosting fan, but this stuff is like crack for chocolate lovers! As some other reviewers have done, we added a splash of vanilla and used this on a chocolate cake. Talk about chocolate ecstasy! I think I told my wife at least 3 times that I could never eat store-bought chocolate icing again.

This was very good frosting! I used it to frost the Chocolate Mayonnaise Cake II SUBMITTED BY: Cathy.  I did need to use 2 cups of powdered sugar and I used brewed coffee instead of the water to make it less sweet as my cake was a dark chocolate flavor. It also "crusts" up nice so it would be easy to decorate.  Other reviews said it didn't make enough for a 9 X 13 cake but the cake I made was only 11 X 7 so I had plenty. Good thing since I ate a tablespoon or two of it before I got it on the cake!!! Checking to see if it was missing anything of course!! Thank you for a great recipe.

This was way too strong on the cocoa powder and it was bittersweet as written. I had to add another cup of powdered sugar to tone it down. But then I had to add another 2 T of butter (I used salted) and another T of water. This turned out very rich and very creamy in the end, but that was after my changes. This is a frosting with a lot of body, dense, and filling. I tried to whip it to get it light and fluffy but it wouldn't. It is good though, thanks!

The frosting has a Great texture.  It has a good Chocolately taste that isn't overwhelming!  It complimented the cake I made well.  I made a 9x9 Cherry chocolate cake and 1 batch made enough to cover the whole thing.  Any bigger and you would have to double it!!

This frosting was wonderful! I had no problems with the recipe at all it turned out perfect, very sweet and chocolatey. I had enough to spread a nice layer over the top of a 9x13in cake.

This turned out fantastic. You can adjust the sweetness to your liking by using more or less powdered sugar.

After reading the reviews, I went ahead and doubled this recipe as I was frosting a layer cake.  It turned out perfectly and is delicious.  This will be my new go to chocolate frosting.

I made no changes and thought it worked out great! It was enough to cover a 9x13 pan of brownies rather thinly.

Don't listen to the negative review... I did and fearing it would be too dry and clumpy I added 1/8 extra boiling water, it ended up being too runny and I had to add more sugar to compensate. I'm guessing the ones with the clumping issues didn't 1. Use SOFTENED butter and 2. Didn't mix UNTIL SMOOTH before adding the sugar. Seriously ladies, follow the recipe... I also recommend using a whisk, I was expecting everything to be soft and/or wet enough to only require a utensil, the butter just clumped and did not want to combine so I switched to my whisk and whisked the hell out of it and it combined perfectly. I like my chocolate chocolatey so I added 1/4 cup more cocoa, to die for!

I didn't add as much sugar (I didn't have much) but it made it the perfect amount of sweet. I would recommend adding 1 1/4 cups of sugar. I also used a sheet pan. overall, it was delicious. great recipe!

great recipe! Added about 3 or 4 extra tablespoons of boiling water to ice my layered cake. It made just enough to ice the top and sides, since I filled the cake with fruit. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I adjusted the resume for less servings but I didn't make any substitutions and it was delicious. Next time I may add some vanilla or extra water to loosen it up.

Quick and easy. It was too sweet for me, so I added cream cheese, butter, and more cocoa to the recipe, which made it great. Next time, I'll cut the sugar way back.

This came out looking like cookie crumbles, but was easily remedied by adding some milk. I actually added cream, per request, and it came out great. A little rich for my personal taste, but easy to spread and sticks to what youre frosting. Overall it was pretty great, just add more liquid.

Tastes awesome! Perfect consistency! I whipped this with my mixer and it came out like fluffy chocolate buttercream frosting! I added a pinch more salt because it was very sweet, and it was perfect! So easy.

Good basic, average, and easy chocolate frosting recipe, especially when you're in a pinch and out of many ingredients. I probably had to add at least 1/2 cup of extra powered sugar. I also used vegan/dairy free butter in case anyone was interested, and it turned out well. Not a jaw dropping frosting, but a good easy recipe nonetheless!

This is a great recipe w the following adjustments: use 2-2/2 cups of sugar, add a cap of vanilla. Also note: this icing sets up fast and is roughly the equivalent of a can of store ought frosting, so I would double or triple the recipe.  If you don't, by the time you mix up the next batch, what you have already spread on the cake will be set. That being said, it's great for decorating!

I did not like this frosting. It was very bitter and dark. I had to adjust it a lot just to be able to use it. If you like that kind of stuff, I understand, but that was definitely not for me.

The trick to this recipe is to mix it well with an electric mixer. The more I mixed it (high speed) the silkier the frosting became. It is a little bitter but works perfect for an already sweet chocolate cake.

Had to add an extra tablespoon of water, but perfect! Chocolate-y and thick and delicous. I also added some nutmeg and almond extract.

I love the deep chocolate taste that the cocoa gives to this recipe. I made a change for my own taste and that was to add 2 tblsps of heavy cream and only 1 tblsp. Of boiling water. It gave it more of a milk chocolate taste.

This turned out a little grainy for me, but it was still very good and easy to make.  It was wonderful spread on the peanut butter brownies I had made.

OMG this frosting was so easy and good. I used butter flavored shortening and I would definitely recommend this frosting. I would double it for regular cakes though. :)

I have never made icing from scratch and was a bit timid.  Then I see that you need milk in all of them and we are all out of it.  But here I see this recipe that looks easy as pie with few ingredients.  I am impressed. Even my daughter upon tasting it was like "  mmmm Mommy this is yummy.  You are the bestest cook!"  Ahhh 6 year olds make you feel awesome, but this recipe rocked!!

I chose this recipe because I was using the frosting in a "birthday cake" ice cream I was making. Once refrigerated and blended with the vanilla ice cream and pieces of yellow cake, it was absolutely prefect. I really liked the consistency and would definitely use it on cakes as well.

I liked this recipe quite a bit. I put it on the magic chocolate cake recipe on this site for a double chocolate cake. It was simple, but it barely covered my 9x11 cake, so double the recipe if you want thick frosting or a double layer cake. It is rich and chocolately. The reviews that called it grainy either didn't cream the butter or didn't use hot water - it helps to dissolve the sugar and cocoa and combine the ingredients together. Mine was creamy and delicious!

Delicious! The origanal recipe was a bit to bitter and thick for me, so I went and added 1 Tablespoon extra water. But still, too bitter. So I took out some milk and added 1 1/2 tablespoons. In the end it was perfecto!

This recipe is GREAT! To get your desired consistancy just add a little more boiling water. Just add about a tsp. at a time.  I also added a tsp. of vanilla extract for a little more sweetness but that is just my preference. This chocolate frosting goes amazing on brownies. Thanks for the great recipe.

I did not care for this recipe. When I first made the recipe, It came out more dry than bread dough. I adde water, and it became soup( which was my bad).

This stuff is delicious!  As others said, it's not very sweet as the recipe is written.  I would have actually liked it like that for some things, but I was trying to sweeten up some brownies, so I added more sugar.  

This makes an excellent glaze if you add a little more water than the recipe calls for.  Very tasty and very versatile...and I love that it doesn't use milk, since I don't keep it in the house.

The consistency of this frosting was great and very easy to ice a cake with. I usually have bad luck with my frosting recipes from AR and they end up sliding down the side of the cake. This one was perfect. However, the taste wasn't anything I'd rave about. It was good, but not great. The unsweetened cocoa taste was a little too strong. Perhaps I'll add a little less cocoa and a little more sugar next time.

I will continue buying store bought frosting! This frosting tasted bitter. I tried adding more powdered sugar and some vanilla as others suggested but it just didn't get sweet enough. Won't be making this again.

I accidentally doubled the amount of powdered sugar (after reducing the serving size to 9) and I was supremely happy with the result! Absolutely delicious! No need to buy chocolate frosting ever again!

Tastes Great! I like my frosting thick so I can use the decorating bags and tips and my frosting will stay set up, so I used atleast twice the amout of powdered sugar that the recipe calls for.

AMAZING! I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but used it as a guideline. I added the ingredients a little at a time until I was happy with the taste and consistency. I also added a splash of vanilla, adds to the yum value!

I didn't read into the recipe too closely, but it was entirely too much chocolate for me and my husband. I'm sure chocolate lovers will enjoy it - I'll stick to something else next time.

Very easy to make.  I used a powdered hot cocoa mix because I didn't have any regular cocoa.  Very yummy taste and not too sweet and didn't taste too much like confectioner's sugar like some frostings do.  I will make this a staple recipe for desserts.

I didn't have any unsweetened cocoa, so I just used regular cocoa and lessened the amount of confectioner's sugar, but it turned out Deeeeeeeeeeeeeelicious, at least from a die-hard chocoholic's point of view. Fast and easy to make. Yum!

This is sooooo EXCELLENT!  I usually come on the site for recipies but never leave reviews.  I just HAD to leave a review for this frosting.  I am truly amazed at how wonderful it came out.  I actually doubled the recipe so I'd have enough to spread thickly on a cake.  I added a tad bit more butter-but only because I do that with all recipies lol.  Tastes great and this is definitely added to my favs.

Yum.  I liked this one.  I halved the recipe since I only needed a very small amount.  I also added a tiny amount of vanilla just because I like the stuff. It was so good, couldn't help myself and ate some on a strawberry.

Super easy and super YUMMY!! I didn't have any powdered sugar - so I just used regular and stirred the heck out of it - PERFECT! Plus I added some vanilla and omitted the salt. I frosted a chocolate/cherry dump cake for my hubby's birthday.....YUM! :)

I used boiling milk as suggested by another reviewer and also added 1 1/2 tsp. Benedictine brandy.  As I was frosting Banana Cocoa Bars found elsewhere on Allrecipes I found the amount to be just enough, but if I were using the recipe for a layer cake it would definitely not be enough.  I really liked the dark chocolate taste, though and thought it complemented the bars nicely.

Very chocolaty. I don't like a huge amount of frosting on my cakes, (just a thin skim spread with a knife), and it was enough to frost a 2 layer round cake or 24 cupcakes.

Needed frosting in a pinch - and didn't have time to run out. Discovered I had everything on hand, and whipped out the Kitchen Aid mixer. Fabulous recipe!! Creamy, chocolaty, and sweet! So easy to make, I couldn't believe it. Tasted better than premade frosting - didn't have that "plasticky" smell or taste. Will be making my own frosting from now on - think about adding different extracts for new flavors. This should be a staple in everyone's recipe box.

This was the best chocolate frosting I've ever had!  I was enough to frost to whole cake.  I will definitely make this again and it was so easy!

This was good, but the flavor was sharp instead of smooth. I added about 1/4 c. of heavy cream and that helped take the bite out of the chocolate. Next time I will try making this with milk chocolate and I think that will help a great deal. It does have a terrific consistancy.

I thought this chocolate frosting was incredible! I was looking for a frosting with very few staple ingredients because I didn't have much in the house. This was perfect and it tasted great! I don't think I need to look for another frosting recipe even when I do have more ingredients!

This frosting is so easy and tastes great!  It whips up so light and fluffy using the whip attachment on the mixer.  It isn't too sweet and complements any cake.  Try it, I think you will like it!

I chose this frosting recipe because I was out of vanilla of all things.  The only change I made was to use margarine instead of butter and it still came out wonderful.

An excellent buttercream.  I cut some of the sugar, and used whole milk vanilla yogurt in place of the water until the desired texture and taste was achieved.
