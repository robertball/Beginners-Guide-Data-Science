18 mins. is way too long and I didn't get anything close to 72 cookies out of the dough. I'm quite disappointed that they didn't have more flavor and I even doubled the almond and vanilla. I'm wondering if Wanda fogot something.

I've made similar cookies before but when I tried to make these twice I was disappointed both times.  They were almost impossible to roll out even after hours in the refridgerator & when they baked they flattened out.  I would not recommend this recipe.

The flavor of these cookies is really good, but the recipe doesn't make fingers, it makes flat cookies. I was expecting something like a Mexican Wedding Cookie texture and shape. I think refrigerating the dough after forming and before baking may aid in them keeping their shape. I doubled the recipe and got maybe 30 cookies.

The flavor is very good, but rolling them into 1 1/2" rolls was very difficult.  I may try them again and let them sit in the fridge overnight before trying to roll them.

I'm in a place that's over 5000 feet so I had to crank back the heat as usual, but I found that I had to go even lower than I normally would. I ended up baking them around 7 minutes at 350.  I recommend doing a test cookie or two to get your time and temperature down before you destroy an entire pan like me.

I didn't have any problem rolling them out and I liked the light texture but I agree that they could use a bit more flavor. I may do another batch tomorrow with a 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of coconut flavor.

One more nitpick on the recipe: let them cool completely before attempting the powdered sugar finish.
