This apple pie was amazingly good! It was so simple to throw together. It was nice to not have to fool with rolling out pie dough. Tasted fantastic! I will keep this as my new go-to recipe for apple pie.

The crust did not cook all the way and probably needs to be baked before adding the filling I also found it to be way to salty so I would reduce the salt to 1/4 tsp.

The crust wasn't very good and was more work than I expected it to be. It was also soggy the next day.

My husband is a man of few words and even fewer compliments but this pie had him going on and on about how wonderful it was and how wonderful I was to have baked it just for him. He liked it so much that two days later he asked me to bake him another! I did of course and it was ever so good as the first. I did change the type of apples used to honey crisp because that is what kind of tree to which I have access.

First time making a pie like this and was surprisingly not too hard. Could use some more direction around the butter and the crumble part for the crust. Had an issue getting it to bake to "golden & bubbly" though - it just didn't seem to have enough moisture in the recipe. Still came out looking great. Tasted okay but a bit on the flour-y side fixed with a good-sized scoop of vanilla ice cream.
