This is really good, my whole family really liked (including my 1 year old).  Will definitely make again.  It is also a perfect addition for a Thanksgiving Day meal.

Made this recipe for company and it had a very strong taste of baking powder. The recipe called for 2 tbsps  , I checked other similar recipes and they only asked for 1 tsp- a significant difference. I will try this recipe again as I think it has potential, however, I will put in the lesser amount of baking powder. I was quite embarrassed at the way this dish tasted.

I made this as written but didn't bake it the next day.  It didn't puff up, perhaps because, while I  did take it out of the refrigerator in advance, it may have not come up to room temp or the oven was not true to temp.  I thought the flavor was good, not amazing, but my guests (all rutabaga lovers)  were not excited about it either.  The carrot seems to take away from the rutabaga tang  with it's sweetness.  I think if I were to try this again, I might leave out the carrot. ....and bring it up to temp before baking it in an oven I trust.  thanks

Delicious ... and unexpected, since all my previous experience with rutabagas was from a can.  This has just become one of our holiday staples!
