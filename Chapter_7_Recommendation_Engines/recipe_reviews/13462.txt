I've made this twice (Thanksgiving & Christmas), and I got raves both times! I filled it with every veggie I could think of (raw asparagus and green onions looked especially nice), and I served dip on the side. All the veggies were eaten; then my mother-in-law asked if she could keep it to break up & serve with chili after Christmas! I'm a floral designer, so this year I'd like to make one and varnish it to keep for a silk flower arrangement! Just follow the directions, take your time, and don't be nervous...you'll surprise yourself!

This looked very impressive as a centerpiece. I cut out a section of plastic wrap and put the cornucopia on the plastic on the table. I used a half of a red cabbage for my dip container. 
The dough is VERY SLIPPERY, I recommend two people do this and you have to work very quickly. One more helpful hint. I did not spray the foil with the cooking spray, instead I used that Reynolds Release foil with the non-stick side on the outside that the dough would touch, worked very well.

This is so fun and turns out wonderful.  I did make my own bread recipe in my bread machine after seeing the price of breadstick dough.  I used a basic french bread recipe and omited the oil and reduced the yeast to 1/2 teaspoon and let it rise only for about 15 min..then I shaped it into a rectangle and sliced off 1/2 inch thick slices and rolled into long 20"X1/2" or so ropes and then flattened into strips with a rolling pin...I had plenty for the project and enough to put a double braid around the opening. I just pressed the joining ends together and they stayed joined...be sure and overlap about half of the previous strip when laying around the body of the cone so you don't get gaps and brown it really well for a pretty look.

Don't use the glaze to attach the bread sticks together and only for final glaze. I also sprinkle with sesame seeds after glaze. Lower the oven temp to 325 and increase the bake time to up to 1 1/2 hours depend on how light to golden brown you want the bread form to look. Family raves about this and askes me to make it every year.Also make the day before and keep form in and wrap real well when cool with plastic wrap saves time for holiday cooking.

How cool!  This took 3 of us to make - 1 to hold, 1 to lay the breadsticks, and 1 to supervise!  I think the key is to spray the foil *lightly* with cooking spray - I sprayed it thick, and the breadsticks tended to slide off.  We ended up not using the egg at the end of each breadstick, as that made it slippery as well; however, we did use it to glaze.  It turned out so cute, and we had a blast making it.  Note that you can make it up to a week and a half early - after that, it starts to mildew.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is a wonderful center. Not hard to make and I filled it with Frosted Pecans bites. I also made leaf's with cookie cutter and extra dough then  attached before baking. looked even more festive.

Very happy with this. I made it with my 3 and 7 year old daughters and it came out just fine.  We used a disposable pizza pan like they showed in the movie on allrecipes instead of the foil.  Used pizza crust and cut it in strips. Did not braid it just laid them next to eachother and connected ends. Can't wait to put it out.  Thanks for the great idea.

Easy if you follow directions. Can't forget to spray foil and must use the breadsticks.  Biscuts do not work. Will make every year.

This turned out great! My 17-y-o daughter made it by herself without any problems. We placed it on a platter with cut up veggies all around, and a bowl of spinach dip served in a hollowed out red cabbage beside it.

This was great.  But wasn't very child-friendly as written.  Here is an easier way:  purchase a disposable pizza-pan (as shown in the All Recipes video) or a smallish rectangle (with low edges).  I couldn't find a pizza pan anywhere, but the rectangular disposable pan turned out even better IMO.  Manipulate into a cone/cornucopia shape.  Do NOT spray cone with cooking spray (although it is good to spray the baking sheet you plan to place the cornucopia on).  Wrap with bread stick dough as written.  Pinch edges well or some pieces may come apart while baking.  If braiding is too difficult, then simple 'twists' are fine around the opening.  The disposable pan holds it shape much better than foil and it's easy to fill.  My 5 year old did all the wrapping while I 'helped' by holding the cone in place.  This will be an annual tradition.  :)

Really fun to do, turn out great. I had some slippage3 in the oven, but it formed a more natural look and ended up a great center piece and presentation for veggies and dip.

Very easy to make! I use one can of crescent rolls and one can of bread sticks. I shape my cornucopia with foil and lightly spray the foil with cooking spray. I then wrap the crescent rolls around the foil pinching the pieces together to connect them. I use the bread sticks to make the braid. I also picked up a tip from another review and used toothpicks to hold it together while baking. I have made this using only bread sticks and it was not as successful, the crescent rolls work so much better and look better as a finished product I highly recommend doing it this way. Allow it to cool completely before trying to remove the foil, if you have trouble getting the foil out try pulling it in a twisting motion. Also I only use the egg wash for the top of the cornucopia I never use it to hold the dough together as it makes everything very messy, slippery, and wet resulting in a very difficult time putting it all together.

Really great idea. The corucopia was a big hit. At first I was hesitant because the instructions seemed "detailed" but I read it 3 times and realized it was easy. Make foil in shape of cone/cornucopia, stuff opening with foil balls, spray, wrap breadsticks around overlapping, brush with egg and water. Bake and done.

Great idea. I used a 'vertical poultry roaster' covered in foil with some Pam. Then, after trying crescent roll dough and pizza dough, learned that the pizza dough works best. Once cooked and cooled, I lined the inside with plastic wrap and used it as a centerpiece for veggies and fruit tray. Gorgeous!!! Thank you!

this was a really BAD recipie.  It fell apart and turned out really badly.  IT looked awful when it was finished and it was a waste of money to buy the ingredients.

This turned out great!! And was the talk of Thanksgiving...everyone was very impressed! I did try something a little different and used an aluminum pan that I folded into a cone shape...I don't recommend this. It held it's shape great but was near impossible to get out! I added a little grape decoration on the top of my cornucopia with the left over breadsticks I had, added a little flare and looked even better. I followed the recipe, except I didn't brush the egg/butter mix over...as recommended by others. I used this as my veggie tray and stuffed it full of different veggies to eat with dip on the side. Not hard at all....and I dild it by myself! Will definitely be making for Christmas!

This was so much fun! My first attempt had bumps and the dough slid off the mold when it got warm.  I stuck toothpicks in my second one to keep the warm dough from sliding off the mold and instead of attaching new pieces as I went around (this is how I got bumps) I attached each piece to its self on the underside of the mold where the bumps can not be seen.  I will submit a picture of precooked with toothpicks and the final product so you can see what I'm talking about.

i only used 2 cans of bread sticks, and i opted out on the egg wash to use as "glue". It turned out beautifully. Thank you for such an easy recipe yet something that looks like it came from the bakery! Wonderful!!!

This was perfectly easy for a great centerpiece. We put the fresh veggies inside lining the bottom with plastic wrap so it wouldn't get soaked and yucky. My suggestion is to spray the foil and pan with cooking spray and then wipe off with a papertowel so there is only the slightest amount left on. I was unclear when reading the directions if the dough should be wrapped around the bottom as well... and it should!

Awesome idea, but not as easy as I thought it would be. The dough kept sliding down the foil making it hard to keep it's shape. I thought for sure it would look like a disaster. It turned out better looking than I thought it would. My whole family loved it! Will make every year, but I will put it together far away from the heat of the oven. I'm sure that is why it was getting too soft and sliding.

I had the "brilliant" idea to use parchment paper for the cone shape, but that really didn't go over so well.  Tape doesn't stick well to it, so I ended up having to staple it together in a few places that wouldn't touch the bread.  It was a huge pain to get the shape decent with the parchment paper, and it also soaked up all the cooking spray from the cookie sheet so the bread ended up sticking more than I would have liked.  So please, stick with aluminum foil!  Aside from that, it worked quite well.  My husband took several pictures and kept bragging to everyone about how I had made it. As you're wrapping the bread, just keep your eye out for holes that form in the already wrapped parts. I also found that once the form is wrapped with the braid, I could very easily turn the end up a little and place some foil underneath to hold it. I ended up adding three more braided breadsticks to the end the first three braided ones so that the braid would go all the way around.  I also sprinkled the whole thing with garlic powder.  I stuffed with fresh veggies and used a hollowed out red cabbage for the dip and it just looked fantastic!

This was an amazing centerpiece/appetizer at Thanksgiving dinner. Looked so cool, we didnt want to destroy it or throw it away, so I filled it with bird seed and let our feathered friends enjoy it on the back porch. We will be making this every year!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year. Didn't get a chance to photo it, but it was so much fun to make. I made the foil shape a week or so ahead of time as not to run out of foil the day of and my youngest thought it was a dead fish with it's head cut off before I started the actual process of wrapping it with bread stick dough. Which was soo funny.  Will make this again for future centerpieces. It was a great way to draw attention to the table. TY

I used 2 tubes of breadsticks, a tin pie plate wrapped in foil to form the shape that I wanted.  Mine did not take as long to cook.

I wanted to make this as my husband does all the cooking and gets all the glory on Thanksgiving.  It turned out PERFECT!  Figuring out the foil was a little tricky but I got it!  Also, they didn't have refrigerated bread sticks, so I used the roll out dough that you can cut.  It worked great.  I just cut them into stripes.  I stuffed mine with crackers and served with pepperoni, mozzarella, and a variety of italian meat.  Toward the end of the platter someone asked if they could eat the bread, and they said it was yummy!

We made this for our Thanksgiving center piece this year and everyone loved it! My boyfriend and his mother made the cone and some aluminum foil balls to support it. I used a $10 turkey plate covered with lettuce to display it. Tip: soak the lettuce in cold lemon water for 5 minutes or so to keep it from browning (remember, never chop always tear). I filled it with cucumbers, carrots and cauliflower and served it with veggie dip. The only think I might do differently is buy some extra dough to make a bread bowl for the veggie dip, or gut a small pumpkin.

I made this as a trial run for Thanksgiving. I used a disposable cookie sheet, wrapped it with foil and extended it up at the end for the "tail", covered it with strips of French bread dough I made in the bread machine. It turned out great and wasn't nearly as much work as it looks!

I made this to use as a Thanksgiving centerpiece.  Everyone thought it was adorable and I got a lot of compliments, but they didn't know that I had covered up a hole because the breadsticks had slid after I put it in the oven.  My advice would be to check on it after a short time, while you could still fix it if holes appear where the bread sticks should overlap.  Otherwise, it wasn't that hard.  Would also recommend 2 people for the job.

I made this using my bread machine, and the recipe from this site "bread machine challah 11" I added a little extra flour once the dough came out of the machine. I didn't have enough foil to fill the entire cone...so, believe it or not, I filled my foil cone with socks, and topped with a foil covering. It turned out BEAUTIFUL!! I'm filling mine with rolls for our Thanksgiving table.

What a great recipe! I did it on a lark and was very pleased with the results. (And my husband was too, surprisingly.) It does help if you have experience doing craftsy projects, especially for wrapping the dough around the foil cone, but it's not a requirement.

This is the most stunning Thanksgiving center piece ever! My daughter and I made it one year to take to our family Thanksgiving meal and we get asked to make every year now. In fact it has become my (now teenage) daughter's specialty. My sister saves the cornucopia and adds veggies and dip to take to her office as an after Thanksgiving treat for her co-workers.

I made this for a Thanksgiving dinner I was invited to. I am not a great cook but love to try new things, especially when it is for a party. This was a total hit!!! I had so many compliments.
I did take the advice of others and used the egg/water mix at the end to massage together pieces that were not sticking together well.  I also recommend keeping the breadstick rolls in the fridge and pulling out one at a rime. The colder the dough, the easier it was to form.

I loved this. It was actually simpler than I had thought and turned out better than I hoped. I followed suggestions and only lightly sprayed the foil with cooking spray and only brushed the egg on at the very end once everything was laid out. I put the cornucopia in the freezer for a few minutes in between each can of dough so it could cool back down (to keep it from getting too sticky). I allowed it to cool before I removed the foil. I loved this and it was such a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner today. I did not use the toothpicks b/c I did want it to leave holes in the bread-I did not need them. Thanks for a great idea and recipe. Everyone loved it, I felt like the Martha Stewart of our dinner today!

This was an adventure but, yes, I just took my time and followed the directions.  I did make a few mistakes but only I know about them. I'm calling it successful.   Mine wouldn't have needed to be 18" long so I'll try for something smaller next year.

This ia a great decorative piece that would compliment any Thanksgiving table or gathering. I had to use Pillsbury pizza dough because the store was out of bread sticks.  I cut the dough into 1 inch strips and it worked great. Don't use egg mix to secure ends of dough. Just press them together and brush egg mix on before baking. I froze mine and reused it a week later for another party!

Fairly simple to assemble. For some reason, I only required 2 (11 ounce) containers of bread sticks! But it came out just fine. I needed to put foil over the tip and braid about halfway through cooking to prevent burning. I made this a week before Christmas, froze it with the foil inside, and defrosted on Christmas Eve. It made a wonderful display on my dinner table - I filled it with grapes and vegetables. Thanks!

My husband helped me make this (and I'm glad he did, I can see how making this by myself would have been frustrating!) and it "wowed" everyone this Thanksgiving!  My mom was so impressed she made it the centerpiece of the appetizer table.  This will be a yearly tradition for sure.

Great, easy, inexpensive, impressive addition to Thanksgiving table. Costs about $2/roll of breadsticks and only needed 3 including extras to make a bowl for dip. I didn't have large roll of foil, so just had to guess at measurements. Followed some suggestions not spraying foil and not using wash at ends of breadsticks - couldn't get foil out and a couple ends came apart, but no big deal. Used bed of kale underneath and stuck one leaf inside to hide foil. Guests liked it. Didn't bake entire time. Took about 15 minutes to put together and baked for about 30 minutes. Next time I will try to make it shorter and fatter. Will definitely make again next year.

So pretty! This really made the Thanksgiving centerpiece unique (and delicious) this year. We made a big platter with purple kale below it and surrounded it with mini pumpkins and gourds, and served bread rolls out of the cornucopia itself, then people were allowed to tear in to the horn when the rolls were gone. This was fun, easy, and a very inexpensive way to get a ton of compliments!

I made this for Thanksgiving and although it turned out OK, comments other reviewers made were dead on, but they didn't seem to help me in the process.  I must have sprayed too much nonstick spray, I had a problem with one side falling off in the oven, but I was able to hide it with the placement of food around it on my platter.  It did turn out a deep rich golden color which was nice.  Also the reviewer who said to work quick was correct, I was alone and did notice the more the dough came to room temp the more difficult it was to work with. Overall it was a good recipe and everyone was impressed with it at dinner.  Maybe my next one will turn out better.

I tried this last year and will do again this year.  I saved my "mold"
I used an aluminum rectangle pan which I then put foil around.  It was fun winding the dough on and I found it pretty easy especially after reading all the great reviews and tips.  I baked it, it looked fantastic, filled with various veggies, with a dip and cheese and crackers as an appetizer while dinner was cooking got raves about how nice it looked.

What a great idea. I made my own bread dough using a recipe I found on the web. My only tip is to watch it in the oven so that if it starts to come apart you can rescue it before it is too late. The finished product was a very creative addition to our Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks for the idea and recipe.

First magazine had a real similar recipe but braided. I used frozen bread dough ( 2 loaves) & this turned out great. I baked it 30 min. Much less expensive than the bread stick dough.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and to my surprise it was actually pretty easy!  I used a wicker serving basket with cloth napkins, to set it in, and filled it with fruit.  Everyone loved it- thought I had made something super special!  All the fruit got eaten and most of the cornucopia remained- so I made bread pudding out of it!  I made it again for Christmas upon request, only that time the fruit and ALL the bread got eaten!  Just make sure the bread dough is pressed/pinched well to the adjoining pieces : )

This was fun to make and made my first year hosting Thanksgiving so festive.  We loaded it up with all kinds of cheeses and crackers.

This was tricky to make (the cooking spray made the dough slippery, etc.), but I got lots of praise for it! We didn't eat it, but it served as a serving piece/table decoration with Thanksgiving appetizers.

My 7 year old daughter and I made this for thanksgiving this year. We didn't use breadsticks, instead we used cresent rolls, and it turned out fantastic! Looks complicated to make, but it was very easy and we got many compliments! I should also add that this does not require more than one person to make....  :)

Came out beautiful!!  Little tricky, but worth the effort.  Made a beautiful center piece for Thanksgiving, and I  laquered mine to keep for Xmas use too.  I only ended up using 2 cans of the breadsticks though, I bought 3, I just didnt get into the 3rd.  Might have been because I had normal foil, rather than the large, heavy duty stuff, so my size was just a bit off.

It's a neat idea and didn't turn out too bad, but it was a mess trying to get it to hold together. I couldn't get the opening big enough and while it was baking I kept having to check on it to fix the pieces that slid off. I probably won't bother with this again.

Wow!  You have got to make this.  It is not as difficult as it looks.  I used a disposable pizza pan instead of the foil and it worked perfectly!  I used it as my centerpiece filled with veggies and a side of dip.  The next day we ate it with the hot artichoke annd spinach dip from this site.  Delicious!  This has become a new Thanksgiving tradition.

I just made this with my husband. I only had 12 inch wide aluminum foil, which worked fine. I skipped the egg part for joining them together. As long as you work the breadsticks together they should look fine. Mine might have come out a bit smaller than others, due to the aluminum foil thing, but it looks yummy. I baked at center rack for 350 for about 30 minutes instead of the 45 because it was starting to brown, even though I covered it in tinfoil in some spots on the top. Aluminum foil came out very easily. Will eat tomorrow with Thanksgiving. Going to stuff it with carrots/broccoli and cauliflower.

I love a good project.  This was so fun, and actually fairly easy to do.  Mine is in the oven right now, and it's GORGEOUS!  I can't wait to get it out and put in on display tomorrow.  I used egg wash when it was all together.  I would recommend fixing little gaps about 5-10 minutes into baking...the dough tends to pull apart at seams a little.  A little cooking spray on the pan would have been helpful.  I've turned it a couple of times while cooking because the top gets brown faster than the sides and bottom.  SO cool!

I stumbled onto this and decide to make it for our family Thanksgiving.  To me, the most difficult part was getting the tin-foil to cooperate when stuffing and trying to make the cornucopia shape.  Once I accomplished that, wrapping the bread was a BREEZE!  As other mentioned, I also DID NOT use the egg wash to attach the strips; instead,  choosing to press the pieces together.  This is a FUN project with the end result being very impressive!

I made this for a centerpiece this year for Thanksgiving!  We had a blast making it!  However, the breadsticks I bought were very short in length making the wrapping a bit difficult.  I'll make my own breadsticks next time and will use longer pieces.  Because it is so slippery you really need to make sure to overlap the pieces by half and have another person to help and work quikckly otherwise the pieces will start to sag.  I just pulled it off the table yesterday and it became bird food.  I opted not to preserve it and we didn't eat it because I wanted to save it for as long as I could.  Sitting on the table for a week it dried out and never molded..just got hard.  I took pictures and will scrap it for the album.  It turned out gorgeous!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out great. My guests could not get over that I made it. Everyone thought I bought the cornucopia! I could only find biscuit  dough at the grocery store, so I used that. I took two biscuit dough chunks at a time and rolled them together into long skinny strands and spiraled those around the cone. I glazed the cornucopia with the egg when I was done putting it together. I ended up putting dinner roles in the center. Will make again, and a spinach dip to go with for next time.

What a great idea!  I wish I had thought of this!  Lots of fun to do with the kids; sounds complicated but isn't.  Ours just came out of the oven and is magnificent.  This will be a new tradition in our house and I will take one to our family events this year as well!

This was a fairly easy recipe to make.  My hubby was my first set of hands on this.  (It needs two sets)  As the recipes says, we used the egg mixture to connect the pieces (but only on the first two).  It made them too slippery.  When we had it ready to go into the oven, we took the drooping pieces and stretched them back into place.  After it was baked, we did have a few gaps, but I had some silk fall colored leaves and I used straight pins and stuck the leaves over the gaps.  Turned out great.  Got a lot of compliments at the church's harvest supper.

I love this!!!! I had a "Thanksoween" party for my sister since she was in the middle east for Thanksgiving and Halloween this year and made this for our centerpiece. I was running way behind and threw this whole thing together in about 10 minutes. Mine wasn't as pretty as some of the pictures here but for how hurriedly it was put together I was shocked by how nice it looked. And I ate it after the party it tasted good too! I will absolutely be making this again maybe with homemade bread dough next time as the breadstick dough is kind of expensive. I only needed 2 cans, but I have no idea if I actually made it the right size or not. Only change I would make here is to say it's not necessary to use the egg to seal the pieces together. Just pinch them together, works better that way. Thank you for the very creative recipe!

If I can do this, anyone can! Take the tips about not putting the glaze on the tips of the breadsticks.  I also used a 325 oven. So EASY!  Yes, it takes 2 people to wrap the cone, or one very talented person.

Definitely a 2 person job.  I had problems with this.  I couldn't get the dough to stick very well and when I baked it it all fell apart in the oven. I want to perfect it though. I could tell it would be really pretty if I can get it to work.

My 17-year-old daughter made this for our centerpiece last Thanksgiving.  It was a bit messy and didn't look very good when first put together but after baking turned out fabulous.  We will do it again this year.

Made it for Friendsgiving and it was the highlight of the evening! I couldn’t find breadstick dough so I bought 3 cans of pizza dough and had a little left over. I followed other reviews and didn’t use egg wash to mend the pieces to avoid being too slippery, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The results were beautiful!

The dough was a little tricky to work with and hard to hide the seams but the presentation was worth it. Such a pretty centerpiece! This freezes well so you can definitely make it several days beforehand.

I have this recipe from a magazine that has to be 13 or 14 years old, before my son was born. I have made it every year since and it has become an annual tradition that my kids talk about all year.  I laughed at the reviews where they ate the cornucopia over the weekend or sometime later,  my kids beg for me to take the picture so they can break into the bread!  They eat all the yummy fruits and veggies I put in it too-I'll post this years pic after I make it tomorrow.

I have made this annually for Thanksgiving for at least 10 years - had an old photocopy from a magazine of the recipe, etc.  That recipe adds sesame seeds to the outside after brushing it with glaze.  

Making it is a tradition in our family and my daughter took over assembly when she was 13.  Everyone always comments how nice it looks.

I used pizza dough as I did not have anything else. It looked good going into the oven so I'm hoping it cooks up ok.  we'll post a picture when it's done.  I rated this on the ease of craft.  Wow looks fantastic.  I will definately make this again.  Thank you!!

This makes a spectacular centerpiece for your holiday guests. I stuffed mine with fresh fruit, hard cheeses, dried sausages and placed crackers near it as an appetizer before Thanksgiving dinner. If your bread sticks move away from the foil form during baking use bunches of parsley and other herbs to cover when you create your display.

This came out very well for me.  I overstretched the breadsticks and when they baked they cracked on the bottom of the cornucopia.  No big deal, the veggies inside covered that.  Also, don't curve the end part too much, because I had a hard time getting the foil out and the end piece partially broke.  Once again, not a big deal, since it wasn't even noticable.  Best part was the WHOLE thing was edible, yummy yummy

I LOVE this! I made it for Thanksgiving and it was so easy and everyone praised it! I didn't brush it with butter or egg and it come out perfect! One bit of advice I would give, is don't stretch the dough to much as you wrap it around the aluminum foil because it will cause issues and as it bakes it may split and you will end up with holes here and there. I did also make a bowl to but dip in. I used the ame technique as the cornucopia and it turned out wonderful! I had made a lattes pattern for the bottom and it was so neat looking! I may try and use that same pattern on my next cornucopia!

Three tips: 1) Its all in the mold. Take your time forming it and don't forget to bend the tail into the shape you desire. I like mine to stand straight up. 2) And its been said before - don't put the breadsticks together with the egg wash. Just press them together very well. 3) Have a blast. This recipe is fun to make and will impress the family getting you Ooohs and Ahhhs!

Wonderful photos! gave mee lots of ideas for stuffing the cornucopias I've made for people with different tastes... very helpful.! one fomily loves fresh berries and sideof of whipped strawberry honey cream cheese, one likes mini candy bars n unshelled variety of nuts (gives the kiddos, young and old somthing to do while waiting on the feast...some fresh vegg. n ranch. Made them for years.. but your site was nost helpful regarding the egg glaze for particular desired outcome.... hard,soft, I prefer shiny w sesame seeds. Thanx again for the pics.. it's bread art! B

This was amazing!! I was a little nervous about trying this since the directions seemed complicated but it was so easy! I do recommend having another person help you though. A second set of hands makes it easier! I didn't have any problems with the dough being to slippery or falling off during baking which I was worried about. I didn't use the glaze as glue, I just stuck the bread right to the foil & then used the glaze over the whole thing when I was done. I also only needed 2 containers of dough. I put fruit in the cornucopia & then I made royal icing flowers & decorated the whole thing, it was beautiful! Everyone was sooo impressed! I'm going to make this a tradition in my family! Thanks for the wonderful idea!

I think I made mine a bit smaller than others, but I ended up using 1 package of Fresh and Easy Pizza dough.  I rolled it out and cut 1" strips. I tucked each strip under the last as I came to the end of it instead of using the egg wash to seal. Brushed with egg wash.

Looks amazing.  Made it for a friend this morning & will make it again this week for our Thanksgiving dinner.  Easy to do, but I took it out of the oven after 25 minutes.  Wish I read the directions closer before I tried to take the foil out!  I'll definitely let it cool before trying to remove the foil.  Saw this same thing in a local bakery about 10 years ago---$75 for this size !

This is a very challenging recipe.  I made it with my daughter for the Thanksgiving table.  It really takes two people.  We made our own bread dough.  I did not think that canned dough would work well.  I had her boyfriend, Casey  made a frame out of wire.  We then covered the frame with foil and sprayed it with cooking oil.  We weaved the strands together and entered in an extra strand as needed.  It is important to keep a tight weave.  It is import to work fast as the dough rises. We cut out shapes with a cookie cutter to hide big holes in the weave.  We filled it with an assortment of vegetables with a dip on the tray.  We will attempt to make this again as it is quite impressive.  I attached a couple of photos of our work.

So easy to make, yet all my guests thought that I spent hours making it.  I highly recommend it.  I did lightly spray the aluminum foil upon which the bread sticks are laid as per other reviews.

this was so beautiful...and got more than one use.  I first used it as a veggie "tray", then had tea sandwiches coming out the next time.  Then I lined it with a pretty handtowel and put home made goodies in it.  Now I've dried it out and frozen it, will see how it looks for next year!

My boyfriend invited his whole family to our house for Christmas dinner on the promise that I was "a real chef". My food was great but making this really impressed. It was easy too, now I'm busy thinking of other shapes to make out of breadstick dough...bowls, platters...

This was so pretty! I was assigned the veggie tray for Thanksgiving and wanted to do a little more, so I made this. People were very impressed :). I did have a little difficulty getting the breadsticks to stay together though- the egg wash seemed to just make it more slippery. Luckily, I had a few extra breadsticks so I wadded them up and stuffed them into the big gaps. It still looked fine. Thanks for sharing!

Looked easier than I thought to make... kids helped. The braid part is hard to secure.  Make sure you have it on there good. My 1st one fell off while baking, so I quickly made another and fastened it w/toothpicks (pushed way in so not to burn). I will try again and see if I can get it to look a little better. I served w/veggies and amy's cilantro sauce from the site - awesome!

Unfortunately I don't think I have the talent as some do on here...I expected it to turn out bigger and the opening caved in on me when it was baking. I don't know what I did wrong but unfortunately it didn't work for Thanksgiving...Oh well, it's always great to try something new and challenge yourself!

This was SUCH an amazing idea!!!  I only had 2 packages of breadstick dough, so I made my horn'a'plenty with no bottom (but you totally couldn't tell) and then I just brushed it with melted butter before sticking it in the oven.  It looked FANTASTIC!  I left the tail end of the horn stuffed with the foil so it wouldn't collapse, and then stuffed the front part with 2 different rolls and biscuits, and sort of let them cascade out onto a silver platter and brought it to Thanksgiving dinner.  My family couldn't compliment me enough!!!!  Everyone was SO impressed!  And it was tasty too!!! Thanks so much for a new mainstay for my family's Thanksgiving feast!!!

A few years ago, I saw bread cornucopia at a Thanksgiving party. So I always make it since then. Looks great with veggies! I served it with Avocado dressing (from this site).
Update: I make it every year now, but I use paulas breadsticks recipe for the dough.

This ia an incredible idea! I made this for our Thanksgiving Day table centerpiece and filled it with fresh veggies and rolls. Everyone thought it was a great idea and it definitely added to the festive decorations. It was really easy to make and took no time at all. We are freezing ours and bringing out again at Christmas.

It was a huge hit with my family.  I didn't make it though, my mom did and said it was so easy.  Although the bread did fall off while cooking so keep an eye on that while cooking.

What a hit!  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used non stick foil.  I found that I only had to bake it for 40 minutes (covering it with foil after 25).  Will make again next year!

The directions were easy to follow but we needed four packages of crescent rolls instead of three.  The result was beautiful and functional.  We finished with an acrylic spray to preserve the cornucopia.  Be sure to use an extra set of hands for construction because it was a bit tricky to cover the underside.

This looked very nice. I forgot to spray the aluminium  cone with non stick spray so I had a hard time getting it out of the baked cornucopia. Otherwise worth the time.

This was the star of Thanksgiving this year.  No one could believe I'd made this. Makes a great hostess gift!      My only suggestions would be to WORK FAST!  As the bread dough comes to room temp, it starts to sag and gets really hard to work with.  Also don't use the egg to affix each piece of dough to the next, just pinch it together.  The egg actually makes it more slippery.  Also, once it's out of the oven and cool, pull out the tin foil and bake again for about 5 minutes (covered with foil) to dry out the inside.    Good luck!

Okay I made this but I did not think it was as easy as everyone said it was.  I had a hard time getting the dough to stick together and ended up with some of the strips slipping down while cooking so I had a hole or two.  That being said, it still looked great and everyone was so impressed that I actually made it.  It really made a wonderful centerpiece on my Thanksgiving table.

I just finished with the conucopia for thanksgiving, it turned out fantastic. I actually had quite a few bread stick left over, so i cut them in half both width wise and length wise, and streched them and twirled them and made cheese straws to go with the cornucopia  brushed them with butter salt pepper,garlic and parmesian cheese, and they turned out wonderful. I can hardly wait for the oohs and ahs from everyone. Thanks so much for posting. It was a very fun recipe to make

I have no patience and this did not take any.  It was surprisingly easy, yet turns out looking like you took all day to make.  Turned out real nice and golden brown.  I plan on putting veggies in it with dip on the side.  Will make again!!!

This was super easy and fun! One thing to be careful of, my cornucopia was done in about half the baking time. Almost a little too done! So, check the oven after 20 min and again every 5 min or so and it should be perfect! Also, I used the garlic breadsticks instead of the regular ones. I intend on eating that sucker! =)

This turned out better than I thought and was  much easier than I'd envisioned.  I didn't have any trouble with slippage but the braid did fall off during baking.  I think it was too heavy.  I pinned it back in place with wood picks.  Can't wait to fill it with fresh cut veggies - it will be a conversation piece as well as a nice change from the old "relish tray"!

I made this recipe twice, once with crescent rolls and once with the breadsticks. The breadsticks are much easier to work with and give a much better result. Keeping the breadsticks very cold makes it much easier to work with them. I sprayed the cone lightly and did not use the egg wash to hold the ends. I just pinched the ends and used the egg wash just for color. It baked for a long time, an hour at 350 degrees. After it baked, I removed the foil inside and returned it to the oven to dry out the inside a bit. About 10 more minutes. It was beautiful. Just like I remember my mom making for Thanksgiving. Thanks for a great recipe!

I basically made a cornucopia the same way a few years ago, but using my own bread recipe.  I would think it would be easier to cover the foil using your own bread recipe because you can cut longer, wider, etc. strips.  It gives you a little more control. The refrigerated dough would save a lot of time though.  I make vegetables out of bread to fill my cornucopia.  I also used gingerbread to make leaves which looked beautiful.  I dyed the egg glaze various colors to make the vegetables.

This was such a cute idea.  The compliments overflowed just like my Cornucopia did!  I baked mine in a convection oven and it only took 30 minutes for the braid to be beautifully brown(covered the braid with foil at that point to protect it from overbrowning), and an additional 10 minutes for the rest of it to cook to a golden brown.  I too, recommend 2 people to handle the dough for ease of wrapping it around the foil form.  Thanks for the idea!

This was my first time making this recipe.  I loved it.  However, I used pizza crust dough which worked out real well and it only took 1 and a half tubes of pizza crust dough to make one large cornucopia. It certainly was a hit for the Thanksgiving dinner. It was so pretty with all of the color veggies around it. It would also make a wonderful gift idea for Christmas I thought. I now have people asking me to make them one! I just refere them here to this website! I love this website! I loved the recipe for this too! I love you guys!

I made this for a centerpiece and it turned out perfect!  I recommend using a throw away cookie sheet with the raised edge cut off as the cone since it is more stable.  I was able to make this by myself since it was more sturdy, also if you overlap the bread stick as you wrap it around the mold it won't slip off as some people commented on.  Definitely will make this for many years to come!!

So quick and everyone raved about it! Everyone was amazed that I had made it myself. It was a bit hard wrapping the bread around the foil by myself since I had sprayed it with Pam, so I would recommend having another person to help.

This was a striking centerpiece, filled with vegie crudites.  We will definitely do this again. It's fun to do this with teenagers, as  they enjoy the creative aspect of preparing food.

Good recipe but make sure you spray the foil a lot!  Had to make a second one after the first stuck pretty badly to the foil.  Also make sure you can get the foil out (if you want it out)

We call this a "Confidence Builder".  Premade dough wrapped around foil, it's tough to mess up and makes you look like a million bucks!

This was so much fun to make.  I made my first one last year and I sprayed it with shellac, as suggested, the only issue I had  was the tinfoil didn't release completely.  I sprayed it with shellac, as suggested,  It makes a beautiful centerpiece with my wax vegetables.

Looks complicated to make but it really is simple.  I did use heavy duty aluminum foil for the mold.  Thanksgiving guests were impressed!  I filled it with veggies and made a homemade ranch dressing for dipping.

This is awesome. I had to use pizza dough, because I couldnt find breadstick dough, and it came out great. I  only had to use 2 containers of the pizza dough. Tricky to get the foil out though, I ended up having to leave the tiny bit of foil at the very tip because it tore and got stuck. Maybe I didnt spray it enough.

Turned out beautifully, and we received numerous compliments on it.  I'll definitely be adding this to my Thanksgiving table every year.  Remember that if you aren't using bread stick dough, you shouldn't use any flaky dough recipes or cans, such as crescent or grand's biscuit dough.  I used pizza crust dough.  Also, to preserve it, the finished bread product can be sprayed with lacquer or "clear coat". It will seal the bread and help prevent absorption of moisture, and it wont attract pests, as the sealant will render it inedible.  However, I like the option to eat it, so we won't be preserving ours.  My husband and I are going to try to stuff it with mozzarella, provolone, ham, and pepperoni and wrap it in foil to create a cornucopia stromboli, so that the bread doesn't go to waste.

I made this last year and will definitely do it again this Thanksgiving.  It was very easy with big results- no talent necessary! My braid separated a bit from the opening but I compensated by filling it with cheese and grapes which hid the problem- its very forgiving.  I also sprinkled with sesame seeds.  Just make sure to watch as it cooked much quicker than expected.

Made a cornucopia for an event we were hosting....it came out beautiful!  Nicely browned, and perfect.  Make sure you "grease" the foil thoroughly (I took it outside and sprayed it) before wrapping the dough.   After baking and cooling, the foil form was easy to remove, even with the little "tail".  Mine is in the freezer as I write this, but am going to take it out and thaw it, and have hubby spray it with lacquer.  I want to preserve it for Thanksgiving.  Surprisingly, it was much simpler than I had imagined!!

Couldn't find breadstick dough so used French bread loaf dough instead. Worked beautifully! It definitely took four hands; luckily, I had the help of my seven year old! It was tricky getting the "form" to stand upright so we could seamlessly connect the pieces.

I used the instructions here with my bread machine breadstick dough.   I used 2 large (2 lb) batches and had a little dough left for breadsticks.  I filled it with red grapes and various cubed cheeses and it was well worth the time.  I put a little foil under the grapes to keep it from getting soggy. After Thanksgiving, I cut the open part off straight, several inches back from the opening.  Then set it on the cut end.  I froze it and plan to put a roll in it to use as "floral foam".  Rosemary sprigs will be stuck in that and perhaps a few little chocolate ornaments will finish it  off as a Christmas centerpiece.  The rest of the cornucopia I cubed and will use in bread pudding.  Thanks for the wonderful instructions!

it turned out beautifully despite multiple mishaps.  i couldn't find breadstick dough so i got french bread dough.  i used two.  mostly wrapped them around and then cut strips to make the braid.  egg wash all over and sesame seeds.  the dough was slipping down so i pinned it with tooth picks.  i couldn't get all the foil out afterwards so i cut most out and stuffed the remainder in deep and that worked.  it was done sooner than the recipe like in 30 minutes.  very beautiful and not at all hard, just take your time with the cornucopia mold.

Very clever idea! However, my grocery store didn’t have refrigerated bread sticks dough, but did have refrigerated French bread dough. After reading the label where it says to “place dough seam-side down”, I took a chance and bought 3 11-oz tubes. The dough does unroll, leaving one large rectangle. I placed one on a silicone baking mat, placed the form on top with the opening of the cornucopia at one corner of the bread dough, cut around the form on both sides, but leave some to wrap up and around the tail. The 2nd roll went on top of the form with the short edge of the dough rectangle at the open end of the cornucopia. Leaving 5/8” or so to tuck under the bottom layer, trim away dough along both sides, leaving some near the tail to continue covering that part. Use cut-off pieces to patch any holes, then roll out the remaining scraps and cut 5/8” strips for the braid. So only 2 11-oz packages of French bread dough is needed.
This seems an easier, and less time-consuming project than winding strips around the form. As other reviewers’ suggested, I also covered the form with non-stick foil (non-stick side out) to avoid the oil spray which seems to allow the dough to slip off; and, my husband was nearby to provide extra hands; but I was able to do it alone since no wrapping was involved.I braided the strips on the edge of the form.
It didn’t brown as uniformly as I expected; the sides were paler than the top, but it still was very, very impressive at our Thanksgiving dinner!

Fun project but beware when shaping the curved end. When mine baked it formed a perfect replica of the male genitalia. We had a good laugh over it since we were all adults but would not be appropriate for children. Guests were impressed.

I made 2 of these for Thanksgiving this year-- first time trying the recipe. Followed instructions exactly. The hardest part about this was making the form, and then trying to get the form out of the finished product without tearing it, especially the tip of the tail. Once it was finished, however, it looked very professional! Each one will look a little different.  Very inexpensive and really doesnt take that long to make.

First the cons: 1) It was hard to keep the sticks on the foil. they kept sliding or dripping off the cone. 2) I had trouble keeping all the ends pinched together and some curled away from the cone when it baked. 3) I'd cover the top with foil from the begining to keep it from browning too fast. 3) the foil was a pain in the arse to get out of the cone after it was finished baking. I lost 3 nails and had a few foil cuts by the time i finished. 
DESPITE all that, my family was flabbergasted at the result. No one really noticed the curled ends and were ultimately really impressed with what a nice appetizer plate it made. I'll probably do it again next year, though I'll try to tuck in the ends rather than just pinch them (that egg wash does nothing to keep things sticking together) and I may keep the dough really cold to keep it all from dripping & dropping off the cone. Worth the effort. I would have given it 5 stars had it been easier to make.

I just made this for the second time and it looks so impressive when finished.  I found this very easy and did not need more than one person.  Last year, I made it for the first time and was too picky with my foil shape and over worked it trying to make it look like a perfect cornucopia.  This time I was less fussy and it comes out great once dough is on it and wrapped.  I will fill it with veggies and serve for Thanksgiving tomorrow.  My suggestion is work quickly with the dough.  As it warms, it expands and can get a little tacky.  You need not be fussy with it, it will turn out great.  Breadstick dough is pricey, I remember using an alternative last year as someone suggested, but couldn't remember which of the pillsbury doughs it was.  I definitely give this 5 stars!

This came out great!! I wasn't able to find breadstick dough but I used Philsbury sheet of dough and then sliced sticks from it! After reading comments I thought I would need more hands so I got my most creative friend but this was soo easy one pair of hands works fine!

this was extremely easy for someone who is not a fancy baker.  i didn't even use the glaze except to adhere the braided piece to the rest of the horn.  then the glaze over the whole piece gives it such a nice golden brown color.  will definitely make again!

I made this tonight.  It was very easy, once I figured out how to make the foil form.  I had better luck using a pitcher to wrap the foil around before stuffing it with foil.  I also did not use the egg wash until the last step.  I found that mine got brown rather quickly- we have a gas range/oven.  Might be something to consider for other bakers.  My husband helped by handing me the breadsticks.  You do have to work quickly, but it was easy to make.  It turned out beautifully!

I couldn't find bread stick dough anywhere!  I used crescent dough creations, sliced it into strips and it worked brilliantly.

I made this as a trial run...now I have to make 4 more!! Easy to do..my only suggestion is watch as it starts baking I inserted toothpicks in a couple of places where the seal didnt take. other than that it went as easy as the recipe said! A big hit with my husband & son...the insides will be cheeses, muffin/breads,fruits & veggies!

I love this recipie!
I made the 1st one for my friend and had a small gapping hole so I put a red bow over it.
She loved it.
The 2nd one I checked every 2 mins. for the 1st 10 mins. of baking and caught any gaps and after that didn't have to check any longer.
I used the pizza pan method and used some foil for a longer tail.
Also I didn't pre spray anything.
I did do the egg wash.
Will do this often.

Mine had a hole between the braided edge and the rest but it still looked fine & I served it for Thanksgiving dinner. Read all of the reviews, to get the hints others have- they helped!

This was fun and shows really well.  I had problems with the breadsticks sliding off, but it cooked well.  I filled it with cut up veggies.

This was fun!  I only used two cans of breadstick dough, baked it at 325 and only needed to bake it for about 50 minutes.  It was beautiful.  I did use the Reynold's nonstick aluminum, but wasn't able to remove the foil post-baking because it was stuck in the tip at the end. ** second attempt.  I added a separate small piece of foil at the end for the curved tip.  This allowed me to easily pull the large piece of nonstick foil out post baking leaving just the small piece hidden in the tip.** I did stretch the breadsticks, but just overlapped and pinched well(no glaze during assembly) and had no issues with it separating.  I did need toothpicks to hold the braid in place while baking and they were a challenge to remove, but otherwise had no trouble.  Was grateful to have mom to assist, but I do think it can be done by one person in a pinch--just need some time and patience.  I filled with chocolate candies and presented it as a hostess gift as "The Horn of Plenty of Chocolate."  It was quite the hit...

It was okay. The combination of wheat and vegetables were a little much, my kids wouldn't touch it and it was a bit awkward. It was okay but I won't make it again.

I made by myself and it was definitely a pain in the rear. In the end tho, it was well worth it. Some suggestions: have 2 ppl; don't stretch the dough or use too much egg mix because the dough just wants to seperate. By the time I was done, I had toothpicks holding the bread in place.

This was a fun recipe.  I didn't use the egg wash to connect the pieces together because it was too slippery.  I put the egg wash on at the end.  I only used two rolls of breadsticks. Then I filled it with cut-up veggies and grapes. Thank you for the neat idea. It was a Thanksgiving hit.

This is a fun project and looks nice.  It made the house smell so nice too.  It is slippery and I agree it is best if you have some help.  While mine was in the oven part of the dough slipped away and so now one side has a hole in it but otherwise it's great.

Had a little trouble with the bread sticks sliding off the form.  probably because I used too much Pam but I was worried it would stick otherwise.  I used a heavy tin disposable baking sheet as the base.  After initially opening the oven door a few times to replace the dough that had slipped,  it finally baked and browned fine and was a unique addition to the table.

I made this last year on thanksgiving, and loved it, well worth the time. I filled it with frosted peacans and assorted nuts.
