Hubby has a bad cold, and this has always been his comfort food of choice. Stuck with no car today, I had to rely solely on ingredients in my pantry. Because this is such a basic recipe, this fit my needs perfectly. I omitted the onion and cheese and substituted frozen green peas for the lima beans, keeping all else the same.  My roasted red peppers were particularly mushy, so they didn't stay in chunky pieces--but actually, it made the salad take on an attractive color and speckled appearance that made it very pretty!  Good and satisfying tuna pasta salad, with much room for flexibility with the ingredients.  Hubby was a happy camper!

I have made this recipe twice since April - my family loves it!  It calls for the perfect amount of everything, including the mayo. It is a perfect balance of crunchy and substance (pasta / beans). I will make this often in summer months.  Thanks Laurie and Roger!

Simple and delicious! I really enjoyed making and eating this recipe, it was easy and filling. I added plenty of fresh ground pepper but skipped the lima beans and used less mayo. It actually looked really good too! Less soggy and colourless than the photos on this page. I definitely recommend it.

Sorry but this wasn't for me.  I tried adding garlic powder, then salt & pepper, then more cheese, & I even tried heating it but it just didn't have much flavor.

If you notice the date, today is the day Rita stormed on shore and we are not close to recovering from Katrina.  I was looking through pasta recipes and the name of this recipe caught my eye.  I felt like it was the one I should try and it was great.  I roasted two red peppers, peeled and diced them knowing it would be better than the jar kind.  And as much as I like lima beans I am going to try frozen peas next time which I know I will like better.  For those in the Gulf Coast...I'm with you!

Made this the other day for a potluck at work and also for home.Not one complaint. The sun dried tomoatoes add a nice flavor and my daughter who is so picky with dressings said we could use it also on sandwiches,burgers etc.

I was looking for a tuna and pasta salad recipe.  I came across this recipe the day after a large earthquake struck us.  The title caught my eye and I had to try it.  My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I can't get lima beans, but I used boiled soybeans instead, and it was really good.  I also used try colored elbow macaroni for more color.  I plan on using this for a pitch in sometime.

Sorry, I'm on the boring side of this seeming argument over this recipe.  It was edible and I did finish it (which is why it got a 2 instead of 1), but it was boring and as for the "perfect amount of everything" ??? -- there was way, way, way, way too little mayo, to the point I barely knew it was there.  I think it has the potential to become something better but not as is.

Great recipe although I omitted the eggs (just not a fan of hard boiled eggs in salads).  I've made it 5 times so far and change it up using chick peas or cooked frozen peas. The addition of some finely chopped parsley, hot dry mustard and a bit of thyme gives it a little more punch

I thought this was a very easy, very tasty pasta salad, especially since you can make it with stuff you probably already have, and it's easy to adjust for anything you don't have.  Someone said there wasn't enough dressing, but I found it very well coated, and think maybe they over-measured or over-cooked their pasta to get that result.  I used sundried tomatoes instead of peppers and peas instead of lima beans.  I also didn't have celery, so I ommitted that.  It was still really good.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

With a few changes, this has become a favorite in my house. We skip the cheese, add artichoke hearts and use peas with pearl onions. For the dressing, I use Kraft 3 cheese lite ranch. I also use whole grain pasta for additional health benefits.

This rocked!  Used light mayo, soy "cheddar" cheese and garbanzo instead of lima beans.  Hubby loved it too, will definitely make again!

First tried this recipe about a year ago. Its a great option for an easy weeknight meal, especially in the summer when a light meal is perfect. I have also made  it with canned chiken because my son seems to have developed a sudden aversion to tuna.

This makes a TON of pasta and is really pretty easy. It takes quite a lot of ingredients to prep, but it's worth it. My husband LOVES this and told me I could make it every week. I use half fat free sour cream/half mayo to cut down on calories but keep the creaminess and use frozen peas because we always have those in the freezer. This is an excellent summer salad, good for a potluck, and even better as leftovers.

This was just great! It easily combines staples in the kitchen and most can be substituted if needed. I didn't have the red peppers and don't care for celery so left them out, the recepie easy and delicious! My daughter and I loved it!  Thanks!

I made this and loved it! I had some garlicky dill pickles so chopped them up tiny and added about a table spoon of the juice to the dressing. my friends went mad over it. we ate it at the beach.

Easy and makes a lot. I substitute sun dried tomatoes for the peppers, chopped sweet pickle for the celery, and peas for the lima beans.

Very little flavor.  Couldn't doctor it up to my liking.  It uses GOBS of mayonnaise and it's still on the dry side.

This was delicious. I used penne pasta and roasted cherry tomatoes instead of red peppers, but followed everything else.

This recipe was just okay for us, but not a favorite. This was good for a quick weeknight meal, and everyone in my family ate it. The only thing I changed was I put peas in it instead of the lima beans, because I knew no one would eat the beans. Thank you for the recipe, BLUEFIN

Used the cracked pepper mayo instead, so a bit of a kick! I liked it that way, though. I can see where someone else though it was a bit bland for a one-dish meal.
