As the first reviewer, I just have to say that these are AWESOME!!!!! Made exactly as written (except for using mini choco. chips b/c that's all I had) and would not change a thing. They smelled fantastic while baking and had great texture and flavor. As a lover of the chocolate/coconut combo, I knew these were gonna be good, but they are not just good, they are fantastic and downright addicting, lol! I did put some extra candies on top before baking and they cracked, so I may put them on after baking next time so they are prettier. Me and the little guy had a lot of fun making these, though I think he had more fun eating the candies, lol. These cookies are definitely going into my favorite cookies file. Thanks, Bug, for sharing this wonderfully yummy recipe! :)

These have to be one of the most fabulous cookies ever.  The perfect combination of chewy and crunchy.  The taste is pure summer in every bite! I followed the recipe exactly, my only advise is double, triple or quadruple this recipe as the single batch is simply not enough!!! I doubled and made 24 large size cookies.  As always I make dough balls and place on a baking tray in the freezer, once frozen (About 20-30 minutes) I remove from the tray and store in zip lock bags.  When required bake at 350 for approx 25 minutes.  The perfect crackled cookie every time.  NOTE ~ I did struggle to find the almond joy pieces in my local grocery stores but eventually found them for sale at Target.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Spectacular cookies!  If you love the combination of chocolate and coconut you must try these cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly and mine were done at 8 minutes in my convection oven.  I liked that these didn't spread much so I could load up the cookie sheets.  I ended up with 30 cookies using my tablespoon cookie scoop.  This really is a wonderful cookie and one I will make many times.  Thank you for the recipe CookinBug.

I followed the recipe exactly doubled.  I was afraid that the coconut was be too much, but it was not at all.

These are addicting.  I made these for my Dad for his birthday.  Now, I'm going to have to make them for everyone.

I didn't have coconut extract and used dark brown usage because that is all I had. I used mini chips because i ran out of the regular chips. I used almond M&m's. loved them! Thanks for the recipe!

I made these at the last minute.  So not having almond joy candy on hand, I added an extra 1/2 Cup chocolate chips and 1/2 c sliced almonds.  I baked these on a cooking stone so had to add a couple extra minutes cooking time as these cookies definitely are better on the crispy side.

A little piece of coconut heaven! The Almond Joy pieces are not easy to find.  I did not have any chocolate chips on hand, but they were not even missed.  I will definitely make these again!

These cookies are very good. Unfortunately, I had an enormous hard time to find the candy the recipe calls for. I had to replace it for Almond M&M candy. It did not disapoint. I like the fact that these cookies are not too sweet at all! I just wonder if the mix should be really sticky....next time I will use my cookie scoop. I happen to read about it just before preparing the last batch. They came out perfect but I must admit the ones I rolled on my hands with a little flour came out perfectly round unlike the ones I scooped ;)

I made these for a  recent function and they were a hit.  I frosted them with a thin glaze and sprinkled toasted coconut on top so people would know there was coconut in them.  I used the smallest cookie scoop and they were the perfect size.

I've been wanting to make these for a long time. I made a special trip to the store last night for the coconut and Almond Joy Pieces and was horrified that my store didn't have the candy. I started to panic, but saw a large bag of coconut M&Ms and decided to try those instead. To make up for the almond that the M&Ms don't have, I added 1/4 tsp almond extract along with the coconut extract that the recipe calls for. Right when they came out of the oven (9 minutes was perfect), I pressed three additional M&Ms onto the tops of the cookies. These are AMAZING!!!! Not only are they delicious, but keep a nice shape (they don't spread), and present beautifully. Also, I like the amount this makes. Not overwhelming...I got two cookie sheets worth (24 cookies). These will be a regular around here now. PERFECT! Everyone loved them!!!
