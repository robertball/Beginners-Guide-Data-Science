Simple and delicious recipe! The flavor was a nice combination of sweet and spicy! I had some wings I wanted to cook up in the slow cooker, and this fit the bill! I only had 1 1/2 pkgs of ranch mix, but that seemed to be plenty. I had 20 wing pieces, and the liquid was plenty for that amount.  I will definitely make this again. Might even make it with boneless breasts! 
Thanks for a great recipe!

These turned out pretty good but would have been a lot better with only 2 packets of ranch. The ranch overpowered a bit and brought a sourness to the wings.  They were super simple though and I think they'd be great with one less ranch packet.

Made it for a baby shower -- it was pretty basic and was definitely not one of the things praised that was in the food spread. Won't be making it again.

I think they came out a bit overcooked.  However, I just went by the time and did not bother checking the temp.  Next time, I will start checking the temp after 2 hours.

I am a big fan of smoking meat and cooking Barbeque on the pit. But this recipe is a very good substitute for cooking on the pit. The taste was as good as pit cooked.
