I would suggest using 2-3 oz boxes of strawberry jello, a 20-oz can of crushed pineapple and one 8 oz container of Cool Whip when making this recipe and it works really well.

My grandma's recipe is called Strawberry Fluff and it is almost the same, except she used 6oz pkg stbry jello, lg container cottage cheese, lg container cool whip, and a med size can of crushed pineapple (drained). I grew up eating this at most family gatherings and I continue the tradition with my own family; my kids love it! BTW, I am not a fan of cottage cheese, but I love this!

This is a very quick and refreshing recipe.  I've even mixed it up a few times to Keep it new.  For example, I will add a tropical fruit mix (Dole) to the mixture and substitute a mixed fruit jello for the strawberry.  I also use two boxes of jello mix instead of one.  This is great for showers and parties in that you can basically coordinate the dish with your themes by using different flavors of jello.  I always try to use the actual fruit of the jello mix I've selected.  Again... great recipe!

It sounds strange, but it is so tasty and refresfing.  I like to use lime jello and pineapple, but my mom  always makes this with orange jello and caned oranges.  My Hubby dosen't like cottage cheese, and he eats this, i just don't tell him that it is in it, just mention the whip cream.

MY SUGGESTION - I used only 8 oz of Cool Whip; 1 lime jello and 1 lemon jello; 20 oz of pinapple without the juice.  DELICIOUS!

Love it.  Just as I imagined it would be.  My children gobbled it up.  Made it for Thanksgiving this year.  I used one 3oz box of Strawberry gelitan because our store doesn't sell the 1oz boxes.  Used an entire can (15 1/4oz) of Dole pineapple chunks (I chopped them up smaller), and that added awesome sweetness to it.  Will make it again for sure, and will experiment next time with other flavors.  My friend puts marshmallows in hers.  Had to pass this recipe out, was a true hit!!

Very good.  Personally, I think it could do with less cottage cheese and more pineapple, but that's my preference.

I refer to this as cool whip salad. I make it a lot durinng holidays because a variety of flavors of jello can be used. My husband and I really like it, especially with cherry jello.

I use 2 boxes of orange jello and 1 can drained crushed pineapple, 1/2 cup coconut and 1 cup minature marshmallows.  A great favorite with my family.  I usually have to double the recipe because my family is large.

My family makes this every year for Thanksgiving and sometimes Christmas! I love it! Its a big hit every year. My mom said her grandmothee used to make it. You can really mix it up to suit your taste we add cottage cheese, crushed pineapple, whip cream, marshmellows, and cherries. Just recently I had it different instead of marshmallows a friend of mine wanted manderin oranges.

My family has always called this "pink stuff".  I use (2) 3oz. packages of strawberry Jello.  This year I added marshmellows to the mix for my fiance.  His grandmother made it that way.  This is such an easy recipe and kids love it!

My mom makes this for all the family gatherings. It is very much requested. It's a some what healthy snack for the kids and perfect when you need something sweet.  I like to use different flavors and it always turns out just as yummy.

This is very good. I did change one thing, though, I used a small container of Lite Cool Whip instead of whipped cream to make this a little more diet friendly. I tasted right after I made it and did not like it, but once it sat like the recipe said, it was very good. I will be making this again, and adding some mandarin oranges. I could not find pineapple tidbits at the store, so bought the chunks and cut them up. It worked perfectly. Thank you for an excellent recipe!

This is a great addition to potlucks too!  I make it with sugar-free jello, fat free cottage cheese, and fat free cool whip so it's high protein but low cal.

An okay recipe.  Very sweet and has a weird texture to it.  My husband hated the recipe though and would not eat more than two bites of it.
