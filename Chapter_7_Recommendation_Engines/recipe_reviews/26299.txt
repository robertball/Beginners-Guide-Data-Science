My family loves this recipe. We first found it in 2004 and make it many times a year.  I usually use a casserole dish to make it and once I have poured the spaghetti sauce on the noodles, I take a fork and "poke" thru the sauce into the noodles. That way the noodles are not just mixed with egg and cheese but also some sauce.  As long as you don't "mix" it the layers still stay intact to cut into wedges for serving. This just slightly mixes the casserole so as to not be in such defined layers.

Just tried this one tonight and we all loved it!  Very easy!  Nice alternative to spaghetti and much healthier than pizza.  I used extra lean beef, reduced fat mozzarella, reduced fat parmegian, spaghetti sauce with spinach, and whole wheat pasta.  Couldn't even tell it was healthy...I would imagine making it with the "real" stuff would be even better!

Good. Not great. I used my usual meaty speghetti sauce and it just tasted like spaghetti with a thicker consistancy.Next time i may use a maranara and layer in peperoni to make it taste more like an actual pizza. that said i'll deffinately be making this dish again. i think there are a million things you can do with it.

Great!  My children 4 & 13 along with my husband said it was wonderful. I did change one thing.  Since it said pizza I used pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce.  Will make again.  It has your everyday ingred, easy and doesn't take real long to make.

This was a hit at our house. I give it four stars because, it's basically spaghetti in a different dress...but everyone loved it and I'm putting it into frequent rotation!

I loved this recipe.  I made my own sauce which included mushrooms and chopped onions.  It is very filling so it would be a great dish to take to a social.

I think this should be called cheesy spaghetti - This was so delicious!  I made this for my 18 mo old granddaughter and she loved it.  Everyone else loved it too!  Thanks!

This is a very easy and quick meal to make. The only thing is, that there is used too much pasta, it takes over the whole taste of the beef. And I used pasta instead of spaghetti, it's just as good :)

I love this recipe, it's so easy and tasty. I didn't have any meat so i decided to make it a veggie spaghetti pizza/casserole instead. i didn't add egg cause my mom is a strict vegetarian and she doesn't eat any egg or meat/animals. I cooked the prego spaghetti sauce with 1/2 can of tomatoes (i like chunky sauce) you can add more tomatoes or even fresh one if you like. I also added dried rosemary, Italian seasoning, dried basil flake, and some dried red pepper. Since my sauce is a bit runny due to the water content in the can of tomatoes, i added few tablespoon of tapioca starch, you can add corn starch for thickening if you like. the herb that i added are strictly by taste. i added a few pinches of herb to the sauce, taste, and if i wanted more for taste then i add more...so there's no specific amount. for the cheese i only use shredded mozzarella cheese. i tossed the cooked spaghetti with the shredded cheese and also sprinkle in dried Parmesan cheese that i bought from Costco..pour the sauce over the noodle and did what previous reviewer suggested to use a fork and move the spaghetti around a bit to let the sauce soak into the spaghetti. i added the slices Kraft cheese on top since i have that handy, then i sprinkle a lot of mozzarella cheese on top covering all of the sauce with the cheese. cook in a glass pan for 30 minutes. let cool for a few minutes then cut with a knife and scoop out with a spoon...tasted just like a lasagna and very yummy.

Great!   I added 1/2 cup Vigo bread crumbs to the "crust" mixture.  Instead of beef, I used 2 tbs minced garlic and 1 1/4 cups of finely chopped broccoli in the sauce.  I didn' have mozzerella but used about 6 oz of shreaded sharp cheddar.  I also used red pepper in the crust and sauce with oregano and basil herbs as well.  Surprised how good it turned out! :-)

It was pretty good, everyone liked, next time I'll know to make  the spaghetti "crust" a little thinner but the biggest surprise was my PICKY PICKY 6 yo liked it. She does not like anything different but she went for it so I definatly have to recomend  this one.

This was delicious! The only changes I made was to use ground turkey, left out the American cheese, and reserved a bit of the spaghetti sauce without the meat in it to toss with the noodles before pressing into pie plate.  Would definitely make this again! Great alternative to the busy weeknight spaghetti dinner! Thanks for sharing!

Hubby and son both really liked this.  Eight ounces of spaghetti is way too much, though.  Next time I'll use half or 3/4 as much.

This was good.  I doubled it to fit in a 13x9 pan.  I used provalone instead of American cheese bc that is what I had on hand.  I will make this again.

Loved it!!
Great idea when you have spaghetti sauce left over like I usually do.
Easy to make. Chose it because it had a "crust".
I used pepperoni instead of beef. Worked great.

My family loved this. Made it with addition cheese by adding a little cheddar cheese on top of the mozzarella, also had a little provalone to add, my daughter-in-law says this is a keeper.

I tried this recipe out on my family when they came over for a visit and it was an instant hit! My younger siblings even liked it. 

I would have enjoyed a bit more of a "kick," but this is a reliable and easy recipe I will turning to for future meals.

This was the first time I ever tried a recipe like this and am proud to say that it was a hit. I used leftover spaghetti as well as leftover meat sauce. Not only did my very picky kids loved it but my extremely picky wife gave it a thumbs up as well.

A lot drier then I care for in my pasta dishes, although I did add more sauce then the recipe called for. i added the pizza blend cheese and pepperoni. Still wasn't all the crazy about it. 

Thanks anyway.

Really terrific.  We were getting tired of regular spaghetti dinner, and my kids ate every bite of this dish!  I used provolone cheese with the mozzarella.  This will be going into our family's regular menu!
