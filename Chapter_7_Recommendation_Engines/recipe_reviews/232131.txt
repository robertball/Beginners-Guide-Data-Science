I did not have buttermilk on hand, I soured whole milk with a couple tablespoons lemon juice. I made no other changes. I have made whole wheat pancakes before and know that it takes a bit for the whole wheat flour to suck up some of the additional liquid so I let it sit for five-ten minutes while the griddle preheated. VERY good pancake. Reminds me of the pancakes my dad made for me on Saturday mornings. Kids loved them.

I made these at least twice weekly for the past 6 months. They melt in your mouth. The only changes I make, eliminate sugar & add a 2 tsp liquid stevia. I also add a tsp vanilla, & a extra 1/2 tsp baking powder. These are only personal preferences, its great without them also. 5 stars!!!!

Whole wheat flour is not at all bitter or bad tasting unless it is spoiled. Who knew? The oil in it (which has been removed in white flour)  can turn rancid. It's only good for perhaps 6 months (less in hot weather) from when milled, so freeze it if you want it to keep longer. Also, I was surprised to learn (from America's Test Kitchen) that over-mixing does not make the pancakes turn tough as it does with white flour.

Soured almond milk since I didn't have buttermilk and used brown sugar in stead of white. These were so good- Fluffy and tasty! Even the men in the family (averse to all things healthy) loved them! This is a definite keeper. I had mine with PB, banana, walnuts, cinnamon and honey.

This recipe is great! I've finally found a whole wheat pancake that's fluffy and tender. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used a quarter of a cup of butter and two cups of 1% milk. I let the batter rest for ten minutes before frying to allow the baking powder to activate a bit and let the flour absorb the liquid. It turned out beautifully; these pancakes are fluffy and flavorful, and I will definitely be making them again soon.  Be sure to let the batter rest for a few minutes to ensure maximum fluffiness.

Wow, these are great. Fluffy, thick, and with the subtle nutty taste of whole wheat. I also subbed in soured milk (with vinegar) instead of buttermilk. Other than that, followed the recipe. Kids love them without syrup, my husband loves them, and so do I! This is the third time I've made them and they came out great each time. Perfect whole wheat pancakes"

Yes, it's the first time I made FLUFFY whole wheat pancakes!I found that in that past the pancakes were too dense when I used whole wheat flour.  I did not have buttermilk, so I substituted organic coconut milk. I also added cinnamon and shredded coconut flakes. I used all organic products.Lastly, I topped with chopped banana and a drizzle of raw unfiltered honey. I have enough leftover to freeze! Yum!!Thanks.

Great basic wheat pancake: I found it to be by versatile. I was able to reduce it to one serving easily (it still made 5 pancakes!) and I threw in some wheat bran.  I think it would be good with apples, applesauce, or some zest. I also added a drop of vanilla out of habit.

I've made these several times, and they come out fluffy and perfect! I aim to use organic ingredients (don't always have all organic on hand, so it doesn't always happen), and always substitute whey for buttermilk and coconut oil for vegetable oil. I make giant batches and freeze them; then pull out a couple at a time for quick breakfasts for the kids.

I have made this many times. I dropped the sugar, since my daughter tends to drown her pancakes in syrup. They were still very delicious.

I also like to drop in sliced bananas or fresh blueberries while the first side is cooking.

Love this recipe!!
Did add some xtras
2 tablespoons of Light-brown sugar
1 tablespoon of Vanilla.Had to improvise the buttermilk :
Used 2 Tablespoons of Apple-cider Vinegar.   
Let that sit for about 30 mins(lol i took a shower)
Added Nutmeg ~1teaspoon
Added Cinnamon until the Vinegar smell was gone. ~ 1Tablespoon(my hubby says i have a better nose than a bloodhound)
Did not delete baking power or soda. B/c the chemical composition has to be there. 
No doughy pancakes
Even running up & down i did manage to make slightly blackish ones but they did not taste burnt!
This recipe yields ALOT!! ~25-30 pancakes~4-5"!!!
Thx!  I love this recipe!!!

This is my go to recipe for pancakes! After using this recipe, I actually never really make *non*-whole wheat pancakes anymore! Recipe is very flexible, you can use any %fat milk, buttermilk (my fave), and even coconut milk! When using coconut milk, I add an additional 1/4 cup because for me the batter is too thick otherwise. Be sure to warm ingredients up to room temp (eggs, milk) before using--I find this makes a difference. I use salted butter (or oil plus a little salt) in a nonstick pan, cook until bubbles appear on the side that is up, flip, and cook about 30-45 seconds longer. PERFECT pancake recipe. Add in chocolate chips or coconut flakes for extra fun. I do this while the pancake is in in the pan cooking just before flipping. Definitely a five star recipe!

Love this! Made this many times before I decided to review. They are fluffy and tastey. We love butter in this house so we use a good amount of butter to cook each pancake. I'm sure that adds to their tasteyness. Also, I've tried using different wholewheat flours and quality flour really comes out with better tasting pancakes. Our favorite is King Arthur organic whole wheat flour. Some other tips - we don't keep milk butter on hand so I used 2 and 1/4 cup raw whole milk and added a tablespoon of vinegar (do this at the beginning so it has a little time to react). Cook on low heat and turn off heat between pancakes so the butter you add into the pan for the next cake doesn't burn. Use a ladel for same sized pancakes. :D

I made this recipe today and it is a my new whole wheat pancake recipe.  I substituted coconut oil (warmed up to melt it) for the vegetable oil with no problems.  I had white whole wheat flour, so I used that.  I also halved the recipe and I got 6 nice sized fluffy pancakes.  I froze 2 of them and will see how they taste the second time around.

I did some changes to make it healthier and still tasted amazingly. I eliminate sugar and add 1 teaspoon of coconut sugar (i will try stevia next time), replaced the vegetable oil by 2 tablespoon of coconut oil, replaced the buttermilk by the same amount of fat free lactase free milk (might work as well with almond milk) and added 1/2 lemon juice and zest and 1 teaspoon of poppy seeds. My son and husband love it, totally recommended!

Just made these this morning, delicious! I used milk w/lemon juice for buttermilk and brown sugar in place of white and coconut oil for vegetable oil, then added a tablespoon of chia seeds for added nutrition. Will definitely make these again.

Great recipe!  The first time I made it as is, now I add a splash of vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon and add over-ripe sliced bananas to the batter.  A great whole wheat recipe that is easy and tasty.  I also like that it made plenty of pancakes for my whole family so there was enough for everyone without having to fight over them.  Thanks!

These are delicious! Instead of buttermilk, I mixed milk with vinegar, but that is the only change I made. Once they were finished, I mixed some margarine with brown sugar and cinnamon, and spread it on the pancakes. Yummy!! definitely a keeper! :)

I used whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, skim milk, one sweet applesauce one non sweet applesauce, veg oil and they turned out great. Definitely a recipe to keep.

For a whole wheat pancake they were fluffy, extremely easy to make and absolutely no fuss. Some recipes can be a little particular. This is a bing, bang, boom-DONE kind of recipe. 

      I made some plain, some blueberry and one with blueberry and mini chocolate chips. This is where the PREFERENCE comes in...whole wheat isn't always the best flavor. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes whole wheat.  

I  give it five stars because they were easy to make and I think that if I liked the taste of whole wheat to my fluffy pancakes or oat pancakes, I would make these a lot, however, I had one child ask me not to make them again.

Great recipe just as it is! When I found this I was looking for a fluffy pancake recipe that used whole wheat flour and buttermilk but no fussy egg separating and egg white beating stage. Totally exceeded my expectations and I’ll never separate and beat another egg white again! Fluffy, delicious, perfect. Didn’t need to make any changes. I do sometimes add mashed banana or blueberries for a fruity version!

Big hit in our house. I made as directed, but found that the dough was too thick for my taste, so I added a 1/4 cup of skim milk to make it slightly pourable (instead of requiring scooping). They were fluffy and yummy.  Definitely adding to regular breakfast rotation.

Thanks for the recipe, it’s a keeper.

Used yogurt and milk with lemon juice for buttermilk. Started with milled whole grain wheat flour, which is less absorbent, so added some cake flour to thicken. Rave reviews, and more filling. Will certainly make again.

Great recipe!  I didn't have white sugar on hand, so I used 1 tbsp brown sugar and mixed in 1 tbsp pure maple syrup.  Also added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp almond extract . Turned out really tasty! :)

Delicious and fluffy! Love this recipe. Used spoiled milk so I could use lactose free fat free milk rather then buttermilk. I also always use canola oil because I like the taste better then vegetable oil. Added M&Ms for the little ones. They gobbled them up!!!

Best pancakes I’ve ever made! I changed the following: used 1/4 Cup less flour and used two scoops whey protein in place of flour, subbed out sugar for pure Stevia powder, used 1/4 Cup less almond milk and soured the milk with 2 Tbsp lemon juice, subbed two Tbsp of the oil out for 2 Tbsp apple sauce, and I only used baking powder but increased it to 3 Tsp. I tend to make more protein dense foods and thought this would be another failed attempt, but these pancakes turned out fluffy and great overall. 5 Stars!

Amazing. Only changes: honey and stevia powder instead of  white sugar... Added chopped dates and pecans to batter before pouring. Don't even need syrup. The kids just gobbled them up! Made enough to freeze and will KEEP some in the freezer. Perfect breakfast or on-the-go snack!! Thanks for sharing.

These were good,  but I didn't notice anything outstanding; these tasted fine but seemed very ordinary.

I made some changes: added a little cinammon, used sunflower oil, whole milk yogurt, three quarters whole wheat flour and one quarter spelt flours.  They came out fluffy and delicious!

These pancakes are my family's absolute favorite! My three teenagers and my eight-year-old, as well as mom and dad. Who knew pancakes made from whole wheat would be such a winner?

I don't usually have buttermilk, so the only change I made is substituting it for sour milk made from half white vinegar  and half lemon juice. Lemon juice seems to add an extra layer of flavor.

I've made these a few times, thinking that maybe the first time I did something wrong.  I didn't. The pancakes are not very fluffy and my family didn't care much for them.  I love using whole
wheat in recipes, but there's got to be a better recipe out there.
Sorry, but I think the Bisquick "Melt in your Mouth" pancakes are better, my family surely thinks so.

These are so fluffy, they don't taste "healthy" but I feel better about eating them. So easy to make. I add a little vinegar to milk and let it sit a few minutes as a substitute for buttermilk.  Thank you for this recipe! We had them with blueberries mixed in this morning.

I love these pancakes. Every Friday morning we have pancakes for breakfast.I've changed this recipe a lot, but use this recipe for the measurements of ingredients. 
I use 2 cups of a flour mix, some whole wheat, brown rice flour, corn meal, gluten free flour, buckwheat flour,  which gives it an interesting taste. 
I stay away from sugars. So I use 1 Tbsp Truvia.
If I have no buttermilk in the house (which happens most of the time) I mix 2 cups milk with 1/2 cup yoghurt. I believe it makes the pancakes slightly more tangy.
Instead of vegetable oil I also prefer to cook them in coconut oil, for taste and health.

The only thing I did was use milk instead of buttermilk. Everything else was exactly the same. Yes, you can taste a midge of baking powder, but it does not feel like you are eating whole wheat pancakes. My kids loved them and so did I. My batch made 17 1/4 cup pancakes and were only 3 WW points each.  Worth it!

These are great! Very light, fluffy, and delicious. Probably fluffier than most white flour pancakes. I never have buttermilk so I add a tbsp or two of white vinegar to regular milk and let it sit for a few minutes. To get perfectly cooked cakes, flip once bubbles come thru the middle and the edges look dry.

I didn't have buttermilk, so used 2 cups 1% milk and a 93 mL bottle of drinkable yogurt.  The result was still very light and fluffy  pancakes!  The kids liked them a lot!  I would definitely make them again!  Thanks for this great recipe!

This is the best 100% whole wheat pancake recipe we've had after a few adjustments. We tried it first with the buttermilk but we realized we don't like the tang the buttermilk gives. We substituted for 1 cup plain yogurt and 1 cup whole milk. We grind our own flour and found that we needed to add about 1/4 more flour or batter wasn't thick enough. We also sub 2 tbsp honey instead of sugar. Delicious!

I have been looking for a good 100% whole wheat pancake recipe for quite a while and I finally found one.   This will be my keeper recipe.  I like to let the batter rest for 15-20 minutes to allow the baking powder and baking soda to fluff up the batter.   The pancakes will be light and fluffy and delicious.   I usually toss some blueberries on the cooking pancakes or serve with strawberries or apples.

These are delish!!!  I had to check my flour package to make sure I used the whole wheat.  They are so tender and tasty.  I did use EVOO because that's all the oil I had, and I cut the oil down to 4 tsps. and the sugar to 4 tsps.  Great!!  A new favorite.

Excellent! I scaled it to one serving so only used an egg white. Omitted the sugar and halved the oil. Topped with Greek yogurt, banana, blueberries and a smidge of honey. Healthy and delicious!

Super happy with this recipe! I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I did what another reviewer doc and added about two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice to whole milk to sour it. Everything else was the same except adding blueberries before I flipped them! Yummmmmm! Had extra batter so I froze the rest for later. Perfect whole wheat pancakes!!

I was surprised how great these turned out! The only changes I made were I used coconut oil and let the batter sit for 10 minutes before cooking. They were light and fluffy. Both my toddlers loved them, even with no syrup!

Great recipe! I've made it three times in the last couple of weeks, and the pancakes turn out great every time. Thank you!

These are amazing! I definitely won't be missing classic pancakes. To make this even healthier, I swamped out the sugar for Splenda and milk (for buttermilk) with almond milk. If a serving of 4 is equal to 410 calories, I bet the things I swamped out now equals to 70-80 calories per pancake! Delicious!! Can't wait to make these again.

I used melted butter instead of oil, but had to add a little more buttermilk to give it the right consistency.

Easy, quick. I substituted lemon juice and milk for buttermilk, and let it rest a bit before cooking. Can't wait to make it again!!

I made the recipe as listed and added blueberries (cut in 1/2) before flipping. As mentioned by others, very fluffy and very tasty, particularly for healthy pancakes! Will be making again and won't be changing anything except may swap out BB's for chocolate chips! Fortunately I have lots of leftovers, which I froze for weekday breakfasts! :-)

Made half the recipe and it was just enough for two. Used Splenda instead of sugar (will use palm sugar or stevia next time). Also sprinkled frozen blueberries on half of them as the first side was cooking. Added a little ghee as the cooking oil and all of the pancakes turned out fluffy with a light crispy crust. Topped with maple syrup. Delicious!

Awesome pancakes. Had no buttermilk so I used 2% milk with 1 tbs lemon juice per cup.  Threw in some freshly picked red raspberries.

I thought they turned out wonderful. The only reason I have a four star is because the first time I made them I didn't add vanilla and to me without it they are a little bland. I also used egg whites 3 table spoons oppose to egg just a preference.

Added quick oats for texture. Used regular milk and added lemon juice since I never have buttermilk on hand. Make a big batch and freeze single servings to be used during the week. Favorite way to eat them is with a little jam spread on top. Nice and moist, just the right sweetness.

Probably should've used brown sugar instead of white, the flavor didn't come through.  Made soured almond milk with apple cider vinegar and that worked just fine but didn't add a pronounced buttermilk flavor.  Subbed some rice flour for WW and it made the pancakes super fluffy - I highly recommend it!

I loved this receipe I did add vanilla and instead of regular buttermilk I did the dry buttermilk you buy in the store adding water to it makes it way more watery than regular buttermilk they came out thinner and cooked faster. I made them on a electric griddle next time I will try the coconut oil. They are a great healthy pancake. Dry buttermilk is sold in the flour sugar isle at Walmart.    GS

This is my recipe and we make it quite a bit. Recently we’ve started eating vegan (McDougal style) so I just decided to omit the eggs and oil. I used almond milk with a couple tablespoons of vinegar for the buttermilk and I was amazed at how perfect they were! I don’t even think the eggs and oil are necessary. Just an FYI for the vegan crowd out there :)

So good!! I didn't have buttermilk so I subbed it with eggnog and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I also let the batter sit for at least five minutes. It worked amazingly and the pancakes were so fluffy. There was no bitter taste you sometimes get from whole wheat batters. Everyone loved them! :)

These were excellent. I've already made them twice, and they will definitely be my go-to whole wheat pancake recipe. The second time I made them I added in fresh blueberries to the mix, a teaspoon or so of vanilla, walnut pieces, and half a shredded oats and honey granola bar. With organic maple syrup and butter, they were a hit!

I like that it uses 100% whole wheat, but still comes out tasting "normal". Maybe could've used a little more salt, but otherwise, it's a good solid recipe.

This is wonderful!  I added 1 tablespoon of flaxseed meal to the dry ingredients and it produced a subtle and pleasant crunch.  A nice counterpoint to the soft pancakes.

This has been my go-to recipe for weeks!! I typically cut recipe in half and sub Splenda/Truvia for sugar. Also, I like to add fresh strawberries and/or blueberries. I finish it off with the Blueberry Sauce recipe found on Allrecipes. YUM!!

Good & easy. I added more buttermilk to "thin" the batter a bit; personal preference. Served these with real maple syrup & strawberry/blueberry sauce.

I enjoyed the assistance of this recipe. I add cinnamon and pecan. I used butter spray instead of veg oil. I didn't have any buttermilk so I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk. I also sub with Turbinado (sugar in the raw) instead of white sugar. So good!! Thanks!!

Great pancakes that are a healthier option. My kids didn't even notice the difference from the pancakes that I make with all purpose flour. I did sub soured milk (with vinegar) instead of buttermilk. I also added vanilla to pick up on the nutty flavor of the wheat flour. I will definitely make these again!

Super Tasty and Super Thick and Hardy...  too thick actually, with quadruple cooking times.  They tasted, however, delicious.  So I would make them again, perhaps using 1/4 cup sans flour.

My family didn't care for these at all. I think it was because of the texture. I didn't enjoy making them either, because they are so thick.

These were really good pancakes. I didn't have buttermilk so I made sour milk with apple cider vinager. I also added 1 tsp Vanilla Extract.

I made this recipe this morning with a few alterations. Increased the servings to 5. Instead of using only canola oil added natural honey. 2 and 1/2 cups of buttermilk as opposed to 2 3/4th and 3 large eggs. The mix came to a perfect consistancy! Held up nicely while griddling and the pancakes rather fluffy and very moist. I will make this again for sure. (adding blueberries to a few and chocolate chips a great idea!)

I'm making these this morning for the 2nd time.  Quick and simple to make. I soured milk with white vinegar and it was fine.  My kids love these pancakes and they are a hard sell.  This is my new go to pancake recipe.  Thank you!

These pancakes were easily thrown together in minutes and were quite good.  We never have buttermilk and I forgot to do the easy substitution, so ours were made w/regular 1% milk.  I'll make these again to use up whole wheat flower, but they won't replace "Oatmeal Pancakes II" as my go to pancake, hence the 4 stars.  I was a little concerned because my batter was not thick, as the recipe and reviews suggest, but they turned out fine, albeit a tad anemic/thin.  THANKS for the recipe!

Good basic recipe. I had to change the ingredients since my wife cannot eat whole eggs or milk products. I sub'd Coconut milk for the buttermilk and egg-beaters for the eggs. White sugar was replaced with raw sugar as well.
To finish I added a tsp of cinnamon, and a tsp of vanilla extract.
