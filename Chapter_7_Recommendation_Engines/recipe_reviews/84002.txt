My very picky toddler ate these right up.  We used brown sugar instead of regular, too.
EDIT: An easier way to make these is to melt the butter, then mix in the sugar and cinnamon. Then, add the sweet potatoes, stir them up, and place on the baking sheet.  Much easier and everything is well coated!

I have made this recipe a few times and have found the best combination to be melted butter on top of the slices followed by cinnamon sugar blend and topped with a dollop of brown sugar for each slice. Turns out great with the right amount of sweetness and crispness from the carmelized brown sugar. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this as a healthy snack for my grands...even my 9 mo. old granddaughter loved them! I didn't measure anything...just sliced up 1 & a half medium sweet potatoes, sprayed them w/ butter flavor Pam instead of melted butter & sprinkled them w/ cinnamon sugar. Will make again many times...thanks Jan!

I used PAM instead of butter, and just used  cinnamon instead of cinnamon/sugar. 15 minutes on each side wasn't quite enough time to make them very soft, so I added about 10 minutes.

I liked the flavor, but don't do as other reviewers said and coat the potatoes in butter, they came out soft and limp.  Next time, I will brush them lightly with butter then sprinkle the sugar and cinnamon on the tops.

I gave this a 4 cause I change it up a little.  I use EVOO instead of butter and brown sugar instead of regular.  And cook 10 minutes per side at 425.  I make them for my 1 year old and she loves, loves, loves them!

Loved it!  I followed the directions exactly, and it was a hit.  It's a nice alternative to the marshmellow variety.

OMG!! My boyfriend called his friend and was talking about the love of these while he ate them!!! I bought the longer "cucumber" shaped yams, peeled them and used a mandolin slicer to cut thin even circles.  I melted the butter, mixed in the sugar ( brown), cinnamon and poured all into a large plastic bag to shake coat. I evenly set them onto a baking sheet to cook- I cooked them 30 min flipped and then 30 min more for extra crisp.  They came out just like chips!!! I have already been asked to make these again.

Nice easy side dish!  I will make again, but will add a lot more butter!  They were pretty good following the orginal directions, but definitely needed more butter but my potatoes may have been bigger than what the recipe called for, they seemed larger than medium to me.  Thanks so much!

Turned out better than we thought they would. Very mushy so that's why it was only 4 stars.

Yummy! I use half regular sugar and half brown sugar, but other than that I do everything the same.  The sugars create a crunchy caramelization around the sweet potatoes. Delish.

I loved this recipe and my husband did too. I actually liked these more than the main dish I made. I did substitute the white sugar for brown sugar though. I melted the butter and coated all of the slices and then mixed them in a bowl with the cinnamon and brown sugar so everything was well coated. I also added a dash of nutmeg.

Great snack!  I always have a ton of sweet potatoes around. I found that I need to take them out of the pan right away.  The first batch I made I left them in the pan to cool for about 30 minutes while doing something else and they were stuck hard, even though I had sprayed the pan. The next batch I removed right away, they came off whole and crisped up nicely.  Tasted great!  Thanks for the recipe.

I use Cinnamon with sweet potatoes regularly.  This is my husband's favorite no matter how they are cooked.  We avoid sugar in our house BUT Cinnamon adds great flavor and sweetness to sweet potatoes.  If you avoid sugar, try this dish without it.  It will still be yummy!!

I cut the recipe in half using the recipe calculator feature and used some brown sugar as many of the other reviewers did. This was okay....my husband picked at it and didn't care for it so much.

These were okay.  I don't really like sweet potaotes and it was a way for me to eat them.  My husband who loves them, thought they were okay but not great.  Got the kids to try them because of the cinnamon sugar but no thumbs up.

Not sure what went wrong here.  I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes to a uniform 1/16" and reduced the oven temp to 350 as recommended by other reviewers.  The edges curled up, but the chips never crisped up.  I left them in too long, apparently, and most of them burnt - but the ones that didn't burn still didn't get crispy.  The unburnt chips were tasty, but it's not worth slicing a whole potato to get 5 or 6 decent (but soft) chips.  This is a good idea, but I'll try another recipe.

Very good! My 3 young children loved these. I was looking for a good way to serve sweet potatoes without making the sweet candied yams. This hit the spot.

This was an excellent side dish!  My two boys (4 & 5) both ate it up, and my husband loved it as well.  I added a little more butter than called for.  Great recipe!

Really happy with this recipe. Was looking for one that didn't take an hour in the oven. Of note, this is not a recipe for crispy wedges but for tender chunks that are just the right amount of sweet without the holiday marshmallow gooey nuts extravaganza. Feels healthy enough to serve weekly. Thanks!

Yummy! I sliced the sweet potatoes thin, buttered them, sprinkled with cinn/sugar and topped with alittle brown sugar. Baked for 20+ minutes. Wished that I'd made more. Will definitely make these again. My mouth's still watering!! Thank you for this recipe!

Wow, these were awesome. I've been making sweet potatoes only for holidays, but after making these, I will be making them more often. I melted the butter in the microwave and stirred the cinnamon and sugar into it. I then stirred the potatoes into the mixture to coat. I then transferred them onto the baking pan and baked for 15 minutes and then turned and baked for 15 minutes more. They were perfect. Will definitely make again.

Good recipe, my 2 year old LOVES these. I use brown sugar mixed with oil, stir the slices around on them. Take them out and stick them on a pan and top with cinnamon & seasoned salt...YUM!

Sorry, not impressed!  The slices were soggy-like, not what I expected.  Overall flavor was good, but wrong texture.  Won't make again.

These made great snacks. The only thing I did differently was slice them very thin like chips. I also think next time, I will use spray butter on them to keep them from getting soggy.

This was so easy! We are big sweet potatoe fans. I made the slices really thin and they got crunch around the edges. Our 5 year old said "Mommy, these are the best potato chips that didn't come out of a bag! And you even made em!" Will make these again

This was awesome! Everyone at dinner loved it! Only thing I had to do was cook them a little bit longer because they were very soft when I first took them out.

These are absolutely great! A simple, easy idea and Everyone loves them!  The only thing to watch out though....if they sit out while the rest of the food is cooking, they will probably be half gone by the time dinner is ready!!!

This makes a great side dish for pork chops. I used brown sugar instead of white and added a pinch of salt. I also combined the melted butter, salt, sugar, and cinnamon then coated the sweet potatoes before baking. No muss, no fuss, just put them in the oven and let them bake.

Delicious!  I sliced my potatoes as instructed.  The picture I have shows them in chunks.
I grated a little nutmeg on top of mine but even with simply cinnamon they would have been great!

I substituted brown sugar for regular sugar.  I put half the sugar, the melted butter and the cinnamon in a ziploc with the cut-up potatoes to coat.  I mixed the rest of the brown sugar with some cayenne pepper and sprinkled over the potatoes before baking! The cayenne pepper gave it some kick! Delicious!

Will not make this again.  I didn't really like it.  I made it exactly as indicated in the recipe. It took so long to bake plus it was too bland. Next time I'll just stick with my Mexican version & put it to boil in water and add some white/brown sugar. And when it's ready,  I mash it in a bowl & add milk and mix it. Yummy!!!

oh my goodness!! this was amazing! my husband couldn't eat this fast enough! i made this according to the photo - i cut the potatoes into cubes. i also used brown sugar, adding it to the melted butter and cinnamon. i tossed the potatoes into the brown sugar-cinnamon mixture, and added a little bit of nutmeg. they did come out soft, but that was ok - we loved them just as they were. i will be making this often!
