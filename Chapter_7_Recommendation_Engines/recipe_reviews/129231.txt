These meatballs were a hit at my Luau themed baby shower! I added a little soy sauce to the apricot glaze. I just loved the crunchy addition of the chopped waterchestnuts. Even my picky husband liked them.

These were just okay for us.  There wasn't enough sauce to really even coat them so I doubled the recipe, but we still didn't love them.  With so many great meatball recipes, this isn't one that I'm likely to repeat.  Sorry!

My family liked the recipe as directed.  I added some chili sauce to half of it and it was great like that too.

AMAZINGLY suprised! I am not a meatball fan and when I saw another foe - apricot jam - I tried to run. But the other half teased me so much I made them to prove a point - his point as it turns out :) These are fantastic, hot/cold, reheated, for lunch, dinner, bedtime snack. Served on ramen stir fried with veggies. SO GOOD. I did use an apritcot and pineapple jam instead of the straight apricot. Thanks for the yummies!

This recipe was delicious.  I also substituted Peach jam for the apricot jam and it worked out well.  

Doubled the spices as well as the soy and the ingredients for the sauce, jam and vinegar.  Added just an extra half Tb of brown sugar to balance out the extra soy.   

Not a fan of water chestnuts so cut out half and REALLY finely chopped up the remainder to the point of being minced.

Meatballs were very moist.  Doubling the sauce worked out well and we just heated what we had left and let everyone drizzle what they wanted over the rice and meatballs.

These were pretty good.  Mine came out a little dry.  I expected there to be more sauce on them.  Good flavor, though.

These were really good.  So good my kids actually ate them, which amazed me!  I've made them a few times now, and I add 1/2 cup ketchup to the sauce.  I suggest cooking them for a little less time, maybe 10 minutes.  And putting them under the broiler for a few minutes when you add the sauce to brown them up and thicken the sauce a bit.  Gave 4 stars just because they seemed overcooked, and we preferred them with ketchup.  Will definitely make these again though!

The sauce was great.  One of my guests actually said that they wanted to use a piece of bread to eat the rest of the sauce on their plate!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for a benefit yesterday and they were a huge hit!  Because we were making these in mass quantities, we baked them first and waited until we had them in the roaster before covering them in the sauce.  Worked out great.

Great tasting, all my guests loved them! The only problem I had was that they fell apart once I tossed them in the sauce and baked them again, next time I might try putting some breadcrubms and egg.

I had some vegetarian meatballs leftover from a batch I made earlier this week and wanted a quick recipe to use them up. This one caught my interest because I had all the ingredients on hand. Since I didn't need to make the meatballs, I added the soy sauce, onion and garlic powders to the preserves and cider. I skipped the sugar since I figured it would already be sweet enough. I didn't have quite enough apricot preserves so I substituted the rest with orange marmalade. I heated the sauce on the stovetop until it was somewhat liquid then added the meatless balls and heated through. I served this over rice. Yummy and quick.

These sound yummy. Has anyone made these a day ahead?  I imagine you could and then just reheat in a crock pot.

This was a hit at a party we hosted. They were easy snacks/appetizers for guest.  Guest frequently commented on them and they were gone before the evening was over

These were great.  I'm making them a second time for a party.
