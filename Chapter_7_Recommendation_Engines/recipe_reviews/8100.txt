Very easy recipe. My family loved it.  Very moist and doesn't have to have frosting.

I used palm coconut sugar and the white sugar. I was surprised how much sweetness the cake had alone without frosting. I chose to put chocolate syrup on top and I was very happy with this cake! Perfect cake for using no eggs, butter, or milk! 5 stars!

This recipe is my grandmothers recipe except for the 1 cup sugar substitute.  Hers calls for 2 cups white sugar.  Good job!  Thanks for the memories.
