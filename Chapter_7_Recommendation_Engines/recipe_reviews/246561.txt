Based on the other reviewer's comments about the rice drying out, I made a few changes. I used 1 c of yogurt instead of 3/4 cup. I pre-cooked the rice for 4 minutes instead of 2. I put everything in the crockpot as directed, but 45 minutes later, I stirred it all together and changed the setting to low for the last 45 minutes. Turned out well. Flavor was delicious!

This was very tasty while cooking but once combined in the slow cooker, it dried out. I even cooked it on low. Next time I would double the sauce and cook the rice more. Also I wasn't sure if I was suppose to leave the pods in the dish or remove them. There is a lot of steps but they aren't difficult and it's nice to cook from scratch. I will try it again with a few modifications.
