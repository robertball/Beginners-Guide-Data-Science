This was really good and healthy too.
I punched a few holes in the bottom of the tin foil to prevent the fish from getting soggy.  It turned out great but it did take a little longer to bake than the instructions indicate.

I'm giving this 4 stars, but mine turned out deserving of only 3 stars. We really loved the flavor of this. I think that a couple of my pieces of fish were too fatty because they all but turned into mush. The ones that stayed together were perfect. I'm pretty sure it was a problem with the fish itself, but I'm not sure. Either way it was a fun recipe and i'm glad I cooked it. Thanks for sharing.

Coming from someone who has about 20 lbs of fresh flounder frozen...this recipe is wonderful! I added about 1/2 tsp. of chili pepper flakes, for that extra zing. I also added quite a bit of parsley for nice color and extra moisture. We usually love our flounder fried, but we're trying to make things a bit on the healthier side. I highly reccomend this recipe. It's a wonderful, quick, healthy weeknight meal.

Very enjoyable mild flavor. To spice it up a little, the second time I made this I cut up a yellow onion and substituted for the tomatoes.

I found the flavor to be great but the juice from the vegtables made the flounder really soggy which ruinned my over all enjoyment of the meal

I found this to be bland, mushy, and really unremarkable.   We eat fresh fish where we live several times a week -- so I know that there are so many better ways to fix good fish!   The vegetables were tasty, but the fish was soft, watery, and not at all inviting.  I fix salmon this way, in foil on the grill, so I had high hopes.   But.....I would definitely not recommend this recipe for fish.

This is a great summer meal!  I added yellow squash and fresh parsley to the other ingredients and also poked holes in the bottom of the foil so the fish drains and doesn't get too mushy.

The fish was so mushy, I couldn't eat more than 3 bites.  I found that it had to be baked longer than 25 minutes.  The flavor wasn't too bad but I feel that mushy fish coupled with the mushy zucchini left much to be desired.

Family loved it.  I added a bit more dill and basil then the recipe says and doubled the vegies... but it worked out just fine.
