YUM YUM!  Based on prior reveiws, I sauteed the onion w/garlic & baby bellas, then added about 3/4's of a can of diced tomatoes and the spinach.  Tossed w/blue cheese just prior to serving.  The only change I will make is I will use less blue cheese next time; it tasted great, but it's strong enough I can cut some fat/calories w/out sacrificing taste.  What a great, easy, healthy, inexpensive side dish!  Thanks for a new staple at our house.

I used about 3/4 package of fresh spinach, chopped, and used parmesan and pinenuts, as another reviewer suggested.  I thought it was really good!

I just made this and must say it was delicious!  I used the diced tomatoes with green chilis mild version and switched out the blue cheese for feta (just sounded better).  This is a quick and easy dish that tastes great.  Highly recommended!

Very tasty side dish which family enjoyed.  My husband liked it, admitting had I just served cooked spinach he probably wouldn't have eaten any!  I think I'll try fresh spinach next time for more vitamins.  I used fresh Parmesean instead of the other - it's still a strong flavor and worked well.  I grilled the leftovers on toasted multigrain bread with mozzarella melted on top the next day - and it was good too.

Did this with 20 oz. chopped spinach, only one can of drained diced tomato, and a full cup of blue cheese. Skipped the onion, threw in some old bay seasoning, salt and pepper--perfect. It was "scarfed down" by spinach haters, blue cheese haters, and tomato haters, all of whom loved it. Probably six ways from Sunday to vary this with excellent results!

Made this last night for my parents, and we all LOVED it!!  My dad is one of those who really likes something or really doesn't, and it was a hit with him!  Had to make one change though, none of us like blue cheese, so I used sun-dried tomato bazil mozzarella, and it was WONDERFUL!!  Thank you for a recipe that I will be using over and over!

This was a tasty, different side dish. I made a few modifications for our family. I sauteed the onion with garlic and mushrooms, used fresh spinach and feta cheese instead of Roquefort. Next time I will cut down on the tomatoes, maybe half a can.

I love the flavors in this dish together.  One of my favorite quick lunches is to warm canned tomato soup, stir in baby spinach leaves and continue to warm until the spinach is wilted, then add the blue cheese crumbles.  For an added flavor top with sun flower seeds or pine nuts.

Did a few mods to this recipe. Added some pancetta and garlic while cooking the onions and substituted parmesan for blue cheese. Overall thought recipe was pretty tasty!

Yum, this was so good!  I added mushrooms, used a fresh tomato instead of canned and a bag of fresh spinach.  Hubby and I really liked the blue cheese flavor.  So quick and good!  Thanks for sharing. 

Made this again with a can of Rotel and feta cheese.  That was really good too. The Rotel gave it a nice kick.  Yum!

i make spinach very frequently, and it's usually just steamed with some garlic and EVOO.  this was definitely a different spin, and the tomatoes added a depth of flavor that really made this different from the usual spinach side dish.  i used fresh spinach and fresh tomatoes instead of canned and frozen, which i can only imagine helps the flavor tremendously as well.  my only other change was to add some garlic.  very simple, healthy, and delicious spinach!  thanks!

Yum! I used Monterey jack because I don't have any other cheeses at the moment. Both of my toddlers had 3 helpings apiece and then wanted more! I will make this many, many more times.

Holy Cow!!!  Be prepared to eat it all.  Savory and yummy!  I substituted feta cheese for the blue because that is what I had on hand, and wow!  This is my favorite spinach side dish recipe ever (and I love spinach).

I can't believe how good this was!  I was looking for a new veggie side dish when I came across this one.  The mix of ingredients sounded strange (although I had everything on hand!) I used two 12 oz packages of fresh spinach and I used crumbled blue cheese and added bacon as recommended by other reviewers.  My husband and daughter both loved it!  I used the leftovers the next day by putting them on some black pepper and Parmesan focaccia bread that I cut in half and topped with provolone cheese.  Baked for 10 min to melt the cheese and toast up the bread, it was another home run for mommy!

My husband thought this was okay.  I did not care for it.  I followed the recipe and added garlic based on another recommendation.  Even with the garlic and cheese I did not think it had enough flavor.

Roquefort cheese is a little spendy, so I used extra creamy danish blue cheese. Very tasty.

Delicious!  I used several of others suggestions by adding mushroom and garlic to the onions and using fresh spinach (1 1/2 pkgs for double the amount). I doubled all of the ingredients except the tomatoes and substituted feta for the blue cheese, since I just don't like it. BUT after that, it was REALLY good.

I really like this recipe as you can use it in a couple different ways. After reading a few other reviews I opted for the canned diced w/chiles (I like a little spice) and feta cheese. It was great served over Tabouleh  but I really love it for breakfast with a bit of sausage thrown in mixed with scrambled eggs. Salt and pepper on top and mmmmm....mmmm! Thanks!

Ooh, this was sooo good! I loved it, and my husband liked it. He dosen't even like bleu cheese. To make it extra good AND bad I cooked up a couple of pieces of bacon and added it. However, I used fresh spinach. That balances it, right?:)
This is a super easy weeknight dish or a great side for company that will pull the wool over their eyes! Fab!

Very, very good. Used green onion instead of regular because I didn't have any. Also, used Feta cheese instead of Roquefort or Bleu. Wonderfully tasty and healthy....Perfect veggie dish! Thanks!

Used fresh spinach, didn't have diced tomatoes on hand, so used a half jar of salsa (gave it a nice kick!). Also used goat cheese as that is what was in the fridge. Delicious! Leftovers were added to scrambled eggs the next day. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! I used what I had on hand: fresh spinach, Ro*tel mild diced tomatoes, white onion and creamy white cheese dip. I added the cheese and very little extra pepper and garlic salt after cooking spinach. Quick and easy to make.

I really liked this idea of adding cheese to sauteed spinach. I make spinach often and went with my standard formula (1tbsp butter, 1tbsp olive oil, an onion and 2 cloves garlic with 10oz fresh spinach leaves, seasoned with Penzey's Berbere cayenne pepper mix and salt). I am not a fan of moldy cheeses so I subbed feta with great results. Just 3oz of cheese is perfect like the recipe states. Thanks so much for sharing, we will definitely be making spinach this way again!

The canned tomatoes did not complement the spinach at all. Maybe fresh veggies would have been better. This was not good at all.

This was a great quick and healthy side dish.  I added minced garlic in with the onion as I sautéed it, and used fresh tomato and spinach.  It doesn't take much more work to use fresh ingredients, but it makes it healthier and tastier.

My husband loves greens of all sorts.  I am always looking for new recipes for him.  He LOVED this.  The only thing I did different was leave out the cheese, because I didn't have any.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This a great side dish! I've made it twice. The first time with pretty much everything the same except I used a Jersey tomatoe instead of the canned and I used feta cheese. It was great except the kids don't like feta so this time I did the same with no feta and I used frozen whole greenbeens, thawed under cold water first of course. Great side dish with anything!! Enjoy!

Very pleasant flavor.  As others have done, I added some baby bella mushrooms, and cut back some on the cheese.  Overall a very nice dish.  All the flavors meld very well.

This was delicious! Like others, I used some baby bellas, and substituted gorgonzola for the roquefort... and it melted deliciously for a smooth, subtle sauce.  I definitely recommend this -- great & versitile for the week!

We enjoyed this side dish on Christmas.  It was a perfect compliment to our ham.  Everyone loved the spinach and requested the recipe.  It was very easy to make and very tasty.  A good variety for a spinach dish.  I highly recommend it!

This was really, really good.  I sauteed garlic in olive oil, used fresh cooked spinach, removing the water before adding it to the garlic and tomatoes, and bleu cheese.  Absolutely delicious!!

The first bite was really good.  The subsequent bites...eh.  Later on I lay in bed feeling like I needed to throw up.  There was just way too much cheese.  This would be good with half the amount of cheese, or even none at all.  The diced tomatoes gave enough of a nice taste to it that the cheese was kind of unnecessary, but good for those who like blue cheese like me.

Substituted feta, and this has become a family favorite. Note, eliminate the salt as feta provides all of the salt needed.

So easy and delicious! I used feta cheese because that is all I had on hand. Will also probably add garlic to the onion next time. Definitely took less than 30 mins from start to finish.

This was sooo good, my husband was surprised I made it and liked it as I typically dislike spinach cooked.  But it was so good, I used fresh spinach as using frozen just seemed wrong.  My store only had Gorgonzola, but it worked well.

I've made this multiple times and I enjoy the flavor very much. Normally, I don't add cheese before serving. I think this dish is delicious without the cheese, but I leave the cheese out as an optional topping for others.

This was a very good recipe.  I tried not to make many changes but i didn't have any Roquefort cheese.   The only changes I made was I used parmesan cheese and I used rotel tomatoes instead of just plain tomatoes.  Very good.  :)

I made this as written except I used fresh spinach and 2 oz bleu cheese.  I wish I had kept the cheese at 3 oz, but either way it was well worth it.  This also only took minutes to make, which is always nice.

This was actually pretty good--I was a bit concerned, as we aren't huge fans of cooked spinach or tomatoes, but it worked out relatively well for us.  I didn't have blue cheese; used feta instead and it was good. Thanks for the recipe!

This was delish.  I added some minced garlic, parsley and oregano to the onions.  I used fresh parmesan cheese.  Will be a favorite in our house!!!

This was "OK." Made this side dish to go with blue cheese, chive and bacon stuffed pork chops by DOMMECHEF that I prepared for my bf and I tonight. The two complemented each other very well. I modified Beth's recipe slightly to add flavor as other reviewers warned of an overpowering blue cheese taste. Here's what I did: a) fried 3 strips of bacon, crumbled and added to the spinach  mixture, b) sauteed onion in bacon grease instead of EVOO and c) sauteed 2 cloves minced garlic with the onion. I decided to use gorgonzola cheese in place of blue (it is a bit milder), but ended up using too much of it for the pork chops, so I subbed a bit of blue cheese (which I also had available) and used what was left of the gorgonzola. This is very easy to prepare (kudos!). The finished product is similar to a "jazzed up" version of creamed spinach. Try it - you might like it :) Thanks for sharing Beth!

Just loved this. Used canned tomatoes with chilis to add a great kick...cheese is not needed, but a great bonus.
