I think the "recipe" for the secret hobo spices was actually the ingredient label from a bottle of Astor Cajun Seasoning! (Just kidding!) 
But it is the exact same ingredients in case someone wants to make this and not buy all the spices. In their recipe though, they dip the fillets in melted butter, coat with the seasoning, and blacken in a hot iron skillet (without the oil or white bread). 
Either way it's very good. I served mine over a bed of brown rice made with chicken stock instead of water and added sautaed onions & mushrooms and frozen green peas. When served together it balances out the spiceness of the cajun seasonings perfectly!

Hmmm... and why were you picking the pockets of a sleeping hobo? That's sinking a little low, don'tcha think? If you roll him again, tell him we enjoyed his recipe. Didn't use the bread as I'm gluten intolerant, but the fish was very good.

You can actually buy blackening seasons (Prudhomme, sp?) is what we use...and we follow the directions on the bottle...We serve on a Keiser roll with the seasoned mayo (1/2 c sour cream, 1/2 c Mayo, 1 TBS chopped fresh cilantro, 1 tsp, fresh lemon juice, 1/2 tsp blackening season) which is something we just experimented with, and lettuce...of course the kids think it's best w/ fries and cole slaw...but I concede...I like the Tilapia on a nice bed of greens!!!  :)

I really liked this recipe.  It was super easy & a quick fix for a mid-week meal.  And just as an FYI... Emril's Essence has many of the same spices listed here~ using that saves alot of time & money.  It was a little bit salty - but still delicious.  I served mine with a black bean salad.  Thanks Hobo, for your secret spices!

This was delicious and very easy to make. We added a little bit of lemon onto the fish while it was cooking and served it over a bed of rice with steamed broccoli. the fish is spicy, but it's not too spicy with the rice to go with it. I did decrease the paprica by 1/3, per recommendations of other reviews and it was perfect. It is a little salty, still, so you may want to adjust the salt a bit.

This recipe is very similar to the famous
one created by Chef Paul Prudhomme of
New Orleans. I have made this with fresh
Grouper many times and always used butter
inplace of oil.Serve with a side dish of
Cajun Potato Salad. Warning!!! Cook outside because of the INTENSE Smoke that
it creates.Otherwise this is a GOOD Recipe.

My only question is "What were you doing looking through the pockets of a hobo?"...I'm sure there is more to the story, we'd like to hear it.  Anyway, this is pretty good.  Spicy of course but what would one expect a "blackened" fish to taste like?  I didn't get a lot of juices from the pan to pour over the fish.  I tried it over bread and rice and I liked it over white rice better.  You can taste a lot of paprika, I might adjust that next time.

Make sure you salt to taste. I added the full amount and it was horribly salty. My husband and I agreed it was a great recipe minus the saltiness

Very tasty! It was a little to spicy for my husband's taste but I loved it! There wasn't any juice in the pan so after the fish was done I deglazed the pan with some with wine and a little butter. MMMMMMM.........
 I had a lot of spice mix left over, enough to fill up an empty spice jar so next time I'm already prepared.

Great flavor but like others said, I didn 't get any juices, ended up serving white dry bread.  Will make it again as it was super easy.

I cut down on the salt a little.  Very spicey.  A little to spicey for me, but my wife liked it.  Don't know if I'll do this again.

This recipe is AWESOME! It's very important to use a cast iron skillet though. And coat the fish generously before letting it sit for 20 minutes. I also used more oil and it gave it crispy edges. Yum! I will make this again many times. The kids loved it too!

Zowie!  This was excellent.  There is just the right amount of spice (if you like spicy), and the fish comes out moist on the inside, and crispy delicious on the outside.  I think it could have used a little cornmeal in the spice mix, to give the coating a bit more substance, and crunch.  Nevertheless, paired with my own Mexican brown rice recipe, and a side of spinach; it made a wonderful meal.  You gotta try this!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good for a quick meal. We like spicy foods and this is spicier than most. Followed spice mixture exactly, but I did add a little more garlic powder as we love garlic. DH still felt something was "missing" from the ingredients? Used a cast iron skillet as that is usually the best pan to make blackened foods in. Served with a cheesy rice pilaf and green beans. I didn't use the bread...this recipe doesn't have any liquid in it except for the small amount of oil & a squeeze of lemon juice at the end so I didn't have any "juices" to be soaked up? as it stated. We may tweak it the next time with some other spices too. Thanks!

This was quite good. I cut way back on the salt, and I am glad I did. I also found that the amount of spices was a perfect amount for 2 lbs. of fish. I served over a bed of brown rice with peas. Fish isn't always very good the next day as leftovers, but this was great the next day.

The BEST fish recipe I have tried so far! I read a recipe called "Hudson's Baked Tilapia with Dill Sauce" which has many compliments of the dill sauce, and none for the fish, so I combined the dill sauce with this fish recipe.  FANTASTIC!  The dill sauce is a creamy addition which can take off some of the edge of the spiciness of this recipe if you find it too spicy.  Also, I added a little bit of butter to the oil in the frying pan which worked wonderfully. If you make it indoors, open a window ahead of time, as it will get very smokey!  GREAT recipe!

We love tilapia, so I'm always looking for new recipes. This one was very good as is. Just the right amount of spices. Also very quick to make, so it's great for weeknight dinners.

Wow! Fantastic! I loved the mixture of spices. Our family doesn't always care for super spicy things so I cut the cayenne in half and the temperature was just right for us. I also didn't have any fresh lemon so I left that off. Otherwise everything was the same as the recipe. Super easy and very quick to make. We are always looking for recipes for fish and this is a definite keeper. Thanks!!

Good recipe.  I skipped the bread part as it did not sound too appetizing.  The mixture is definitely spicy, so keep that in mind when applying.  Easy and quick---good for a weeknight meal.

I've made this dozens of times over the past few years and it's always a hit! I never have white pepper on hand, so I just add more black pepper. I also never have celery seeds and it's great without it. Still not sure why one would pickpocket a sleeping hobo, but I'm thankful for the recipe, nonetheless! =D

I made it as specified, but the spices got really blackened (my oil was not too hot) but the fish itself was amazing! I will make it again but not pour the leftover pan stuff over it. Make sure you use a lot of lemon, too, it just creates this amazing flavor with the chicken. YUM! Thanks for sharing.

Very Tasty. Make it easy and buy the blackened Old Bay Seasoning, it has all the same good spices. Like others I chose not to place the Tilapia on a piece of bread. The bread simply, will take care of the extra oil. The tilapia standing alone with your choice of sides, makes for a pretty presentation and is very good to boot. Thank You for Sharing

Very spicy but sooooo good!  I have had a hard time getting my husband to eat fish, but he said he could eat it every week prepared like this.  Good with a little coleslaw to cool it down.

We really enjoyed the Secret Hobo Spices. I baked the fish rather than panfrying it, and it still tasted great. I'll definitely make this again, and I'll use the spice mix on chicken and pork too.

I leave out the bread part. To me that just sounds gross. The fish has great flavor. This is a super easy recipie!

Overall, a great blend for fish. Quite spicy, which doesn't bother me, but just a heads up in case you wish to tweak. I used walleye and skipped the bread... I'm not sure what juices it would soak up and it just didn't sound appealing to me. Served with a spinach-garden veggie salad. Quick and easy!

First recipe from here, and by far the best. This spice rub is great for any seafood, even shrimp. Avoid cayenne for any who dislike heat, but for those who do like heat double it. I remove excess grease with paper towel on the fish, and omit the white bread. Serve over rice, or couscous, with a steamed veggie medley.

Another quick and yummy meal ... the spice mix makes the Tilapia taste extremely good.  And as the recipe was written - we didn't underestimate the bread.  The juice from cooking was a wonderful addition to moisten up the bread and add another layer of flavor to the dish.

great recipe! I didnt have any celery seed or white pepper on hand so I had to leave those ingredients out, but I also added a little Old Bay (hubby is from MD so he loves Old Bay in just about anything!) followed the amounts and cooking time/directions (i omitted the lemons and white bread, but chose to serve in wheat tortillas with sauteed onion and bell peppers) Delicious! I will definitely make this again!

I could give this recipe 4 stars with the following modifications.    1st, the spice rub is really enough for 2lbs of filllets. We had more than half remaining after a thick coating on both sides of 4 fillets (1lb).   2nd, the cayenne pepper suggested is way too much for the average person. I love spicy food and this was borderline too hot to enjoy. I'll use about 75% less next time so that my wife and 8yr old can eat it too.

made this tonight, without reading the reviews. after I seasoned the fish, I thought about how spicy it was going to be so I sent out my husband to grab Mc Donald's for the kids. I didn't change a thing, except I didn't add the bread just because of choice and we LOVED it! It was a little spicy, but perfect for us. from now on this is the only way I shall make blackened fish! Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

I made this with all the ingredients but I broiled it instead of frying it, just a little healthier option and wow was it delicious! The edges were crispy and so tasty, I gave the recipe to many others because I loved it so much.

Great! My husband and I both loved this. We left the spices as is in the recipe, but we both like spicy foods so it worked for us. We did add the lemon to the skillet at the end of cooking the tilapia in order to warm it and to make sure we had juices to pour over the bread. Delicious!

Fantastic!  Healthy, diet friendly and VERY tasty (we had our fish with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans, but I will make the original recipe for lunch soon).  We cooked our fish on a very hot griddle on the BBQ for 4 minutes per side (lid down)and it was perfectly cooked.  A pat of butter on top finished it nicely.  This will definitely become a regular meal in our home.

This was EXCELLENT! We are not fish eaters and I was super nervous about cooking fish (I did salmon steaks years ago and it was awful hehe). We loved it and this recipe is a keeper! The spices really heat it up but just wonderfully flavorful, not to the point of pain. Will try it with a raspberry sauce next time, I think it will compliment the spices very nicely. :)

YUM! YUM! YUM! EASY and FAST way to make Tilapia. Tastes just like, if not better, than the Blackened Tilpia at Red Lobster! 

Paired with a Romaine Garden Salad and Rice Pilaf. Great meal! I would like more of this Hobo's Secret Recipes! :)

I'd been searching for an easy recipe for pan grilled tilapia. Have never made tilapia before, and this sounded so easy.  And it was! We loved it! Just the right amount of spices for me, tho hubby would enjoy a tad bit spicier. I did not use the bread under it as there was hardly any pan juices to speak of. Forgot the lemon, but it was still very good. We will definately be making this again!

I do not like fish, but my husband loves it, so occasionally I will try a fish recipe.  This could make me actually look forward to eating fish!  I followed the recipe exactly, except used cod and grilled it.  Served with my favorite grilled zucchini and I was sopping up the juices with my zucchini.  Thank you, Hobo, wherever you are!

WOW.  Spicy!! My husband loved it!! I liked it a lot, but it was a little hot for me.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will put a little less cayenne.
**** I have since made this about 10 times.  My 2 daughters who swore they hated fish request it often!  I put half the amount of cayenne pepper, salted to taste and it is perfect for us! This is now a family favorite!!***

As tilapia is a very bland fish this recipe is mostly about the blackening spice.  It's easy to make and calls for ingredients you're likely to have on hand.  It does not need a tablespoon of salt so I decreased that to 1 tsp instead and it turned out well.  I was taught NOT to add oil to pans when blackening, mostly due to the HUGE RISK OF FIRE when adding fats to 500 degree pans!!! If you're following the recipe exactly, you may not want to do this indoors. 

However, the flavor is good and there's spicy heat without being overpowering.

This was the best fish my family and I have ever eaten. The only change I made was eliminating the black pepper and using just a dash of cayenne because I don't like my food too spicy. There were not a lot of pan juices and we ate the fish without the white bread.

Great taste and simple to do! I used approximations and none of the oregano, thyme or celery seed and it still worked out nice and yummy! The note about the bread is TRUE!

This was a good starter recipe.  I think to make it 5 stars, someone needs to play w/ their own taste.  I did add a teaspoon of cumin in the mix.  Also, instead of just white bread.  I made a butter/olive oil/lemon juice mixture w/ the same type of spices for the blackened fish.  I coated the sourdough slice in the mixture and baked for a large crunchy crouton and then laid the fish on top of the crouton.  This provided a contrasting crunch w/ the soft fish and added major flavor!

Surprisingly good because I don't usually care for fish and therefore rarely cook it!  However my hubby bought some tilapia so I thought I'd try this recipe.  All I can say is YUM!  Even my 8 yo--who also does not eat fish--ate it all up.  This is a keeper for sure :)  Oh, I also cooked this with the 'Lemon Thyme Basmati Rice' recipe from this site--very good!

Fantastic recipe.  Even the kids liked it (they do have good palates though).   I served it with the "mango salsa" with black beans added on tostadas.  Very nice meal together.

This spice rub is fantastic!  I ended up making it, storing it in a Glad plastic ware little box, and using it on every type of fish I've cooked since and it's been wonderful every time!  This spice rub is very good and worth having on hand to use every time.

This was a very flavorful spice seasoning, but way too strong for me. I couldn't taste the natural flavor of the fish at all. I cut back on the cayenne and paprika and it was still too overpowering.

Super yummy.  I didn't find the combination of spices to be too spicey at all.  I cooked this in a skillet with a combination of olive oil and butter to stop the butter from burning.  All it took was 3 minutes per side - - making this an extremely easy and fast dinner to have on the table.  Thanks for such a delicious recipe, Six Pack!

This was a delicious recipe!  It had great flavor and was a quick, easy meal!  I paired it with asparagus seasoned with olive oil and the same seasoning that i just tossed in the pan after the fish cooked.  It was a wonderful combo.

Overall, this was a very tasty blackened recipe.  Like otherss, I adjusted the spices: 2 TBSP paprika, 1/2 tsp of black pepper, NO white pepper, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp garlic powder.  I used catfish filets and needed to cook them longer than 3 minutes each side.  Unfortunately, all the "seasoning" of my cast iron pan came off in this one use.  Did anyone else have this problem?  I will definitely be doing this again, but outside.  I had to put a fan in the kitchen window to take out the smoke.  But, it sure was delicious!  A keeper!

To me it lack any real flavor except HOT. After reading the reviews I reduced the cayenne and salt by half and it was kinda bland and too spicy. This is coming from someone who loves spicy food. I even ran the fish under water to rid it of some of the spices and still too hot. I'll work on the mix (since I have some left over) and see what I come up with.

Cute story behind it, however the recipe isn't so good. I only used a 1/4 tsp. cayenne and it was still too hot. I've had blacked fish before and liked it OK but this couldn't compare. As for the sauce, I didn't think one Tablespoon of oil was enough to have a remaining sauce so I added 1/2 T. more. (didn't want to up the calories too much). The pan was still dry when I finished. I bought white bread (only had whole wheat) just for this recipe because I like to follow recipes as close as possible. I really don't think this was needed. We ended up scraping off the crust and having fish sandwiches. Oh, well. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

Well, this definitly deserves 4 stars. I didn't use the bread. This is the first time I blackened anything and I must say I was impressed. Don't be afraid to add all the spices when sprinkling the fish it makes the crust that much nicer. I might like to pair this up with a fruit salsa. Thanks for the recipe, a keeper!..>PS WHY WERE YOU IN A HOBO'S POCKET ON THE RAILROAD TRACKS??!!!

This is really good except there was way too much salt for us. Will definitely cut that way back next time. Like others I didn't have any juice left over so the bread was dry. Next time I'll serve over rice as others did. We enjoyed it except had to scrap some seasons off to get rid of the salt.

Instead of onion powder, I chopped up actual onions and some green bell pepper and put it in the skillet.  It added more substance and the bell pepper made it a little less spicy! This was the first time I made my own non-fried fish, and this made it easier.  (I also used MUCH less salt than it called for)

We love this recipe! It is the only way that I can get my husband and daughter to eat fish, so I'm thankful that it is easy as well! The only modification that I make is to forgo the bread. Sometimes we also grill the fish to avoid the fish smell in the house.

WOW. Hot! So, I'm new to cooking, and for other newbs, make sure you don't coat the fish too thickly with the spices - it's a REALLY cajun spice, and ma mouth is burnin'! Lightly coat. Like the picture. So that some of the fish meat is actually still visible. That's more than enough seasoning!

Dish was delicious!! Kinda confused about the pan juices because all I had was oil left over and not much of it.  I served it over brown rice I cooked in chicken stock and added sauteed onion and mushrooms to the rice.  Added a stuffed Zucchini and we all were stuffed!! Yummy

Delicious and flavorful! I modified the recipe as I did not have all the ingredients and read other peoples reviews. I only added 1 1/2 tbps Paprika and a 1/2 tbsp of salt. I did not have and thus did not use: cayenne pepper, white pepper and celery seeds. I added 1 tsp of garlic powder. 
I substituted the bread for white rice and added butter, lemon juice, corn, red bell pepper, and red pepper. 
The last modification was that I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil (not healthy). It was DELICIOUS! I try a lot of recipes and am usually disappointed, but this was really flavorful and I'll DEFINITELY make it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe but my fiance did not. It was just too spicy for her. Next time I will cut down on all of the hot spices, perhaps 2 TBLS Paprika, 1/2 TSP Cayenne, black, and white pepper. I think this will tone it down and not sacrifice flavor

I was really looking forward to delicious blackened tilapia tonight but this did not fit the bill.  There is WAY too much paprika in this recipe...it overpowered everything.  A generous squeeze of fresh lemon juice made it more palatable but I will never use this recipe again.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, since I followed the recipe exactly (other than cutting it down to 2 servings).  I got the oil hot, then put the rubbed fish in.  After about 2 minutes, it started smoking, but I figured that was part of the recipe.  When I turned it over after 3 minutes, the bottom side was black, but again, I figured, well, it's "blackened", so it was probably fine.  After another minute of cooking, I had to turn on the overhead fan and open two windows because of the smoke.  After another minute, I couldn't stand to be in the kitchen because I was coughing so much on the smoke.  I had to stop it.  I put the fish on a plate.  The smoke stopped -- yay!  Unfortunately, I was not able to flake it with a fork.  I hope it was overdone and not underdone.  The flavor was very good, and I'd make it again if I could figure out how to keep it from smoking so badly.

I took a suggestion from another viewer and brushed the fish with melted butter prior to sprinkling on the rub. Didn't use the bread. The paprika flavor was a little too strong for me so next time I will cut back on it but otherwise it was very good and went well with the tilapia. Wish I had an iron skillet. That would have made a good recipe even better.

Blackened Tilapia with Secret Hobo Spices' Haiku: "Smoky, spicy, yum! I love this recipe's name. Where's that hobo chef?" Couldn't help but chuckle at the recipe's name, and description, so just had to make this. The blackened seasoning raised my el-cheapo wimpy generic frozen tilapia filets to a whole new level. Only thing I couldn't bring myself to do was buy a loaf of white bread (we like honey wheat in deez parts) to try that out, and I guess I'm glad that I didn't b/c, well, there were no pan juices to speak of. Very dry, mega-smokey, and oil a-poppin', but wow, the fish was so awesome!! Thanks sleepy hobo!

This one needs some work.  There was so much paprika that it completely overshadowed the other spices.  Also, there were no pan juices.  And I had so much spice mix left over that I could have made an entire second recipe.  Kind of disappointing.

My husband said that Hobos must be eating better than we thought they did!  This recipe is tasty and flavorful.  I didn't have all the seasonings on hand, so did a Jamaician curry powder and Old Bay seasoning along with the onion and garlic powder.  Sprinkled lemon juice on while fish was blackening. Served over a garlic white bread spread with a bit of butter.  Added garlic couscous, grean beans and organic apricot applesauce to complete the feast.  It was a very nice meal!  Thanks! Those Hobo spices aren't so secret after all! : )

My very first  review EVER!! YAY! This came out perfect. I'm a Pastry Chef &  my hubby does must of the cooking around here. With that being said, I was shocked when I tasted this! And after his first bite, my husband complimented me on this dish. WHAT??? (doesn't happen often with savory dishes). He even asked me if I used a recipe or how I came up with the seasoning. He then went on to say that it was cooked perfectly!!  Will definitely make this again & again. Loved it. Just added it to my favorites. Thanx for the recipe & loved the story that went along with it!

We had just had blackened tilapia at a restaurant and my husband asked me to make it at home.  I followed this as written except I only had black pepper, and I didn't use the bread - didn't have any juice in the pan anyway.  He loved it and said I should make all our fish this way.  It was super easy and super fast!

Great recipe for tilapia. A perfect light lunch, yet satisfying for the low carb dieters in my family. I served the tilapia on top of baby salad greens tossed in lemon juice, instead of bread. Absolutely delicious.

I actually found myself feeling a bit guilty for even using this recipe considering how the person who posted it even got it (seemingly pick pocketing a homeless person), but its good. And its a really flexible recipe as well, I've altered it just the way I wanted to with a few other ingredients and it came out just as good.

This is DELISH sooooo quick and easy, I am not sure how this is supposed to be enough seasoning to cover 1 lb of tilapia, or maybe I just need more seasoning that others. Loved it! Even my 4-year old enjoyed it!

This is a new family staple. I needed to lose weight, and tilapia was recommended. I use EVOO and skip the drippings with bread. But even my non-spicy, non-fish-eating family members like this. I quadrupled the spice and it fits nicely in an 8 oz empty cinnamon jar. I just sprinkle on tilapia before throwing on my hot cast iron griddle. It is VERY fast, so I make sure all my sides are done before making this. Goes well with a baked sweet potato.

It was good, loved the spicy. The only thing I didn't like was the celery seed...never liked celery..apparently that taste carries over to its seed as well! Even in such a small amount it was a flavor that stuck out to me. Next time no celery seed...otherwise, great recipe.

Perfectly seasoned. I did not have kosher salt so I used less regular salt. Spicy or HOT??? I guess my definition of spicy and hot are different. This was spicy because "spices" were used but it was definitely NOT hot!! My 16 and 13 yo ate 2 fillets!!! lol !!! There wasnt any "pan juices" to pour off though. But it was great.

This turned out 5 star restaurant quality!!  Instead of using all those ingredients I used Durkee Grill Creations Seafood Seasonings.  I sprinkled in evenly on both sides and then let it set for a half hour.  1 pound of tilapia was 4 pieces which wouldn't fit in one large skillet.....I used 2 skillets at the same time with 1 tablespoon of oil in each.  The cook time was perfect.  I didn't pour juices out of the pan, but just the lemon.  I made tartar sauce to go with it.  I made some breadsticks along the side.

This was so delicious! A little on the spicy side but great. The first time I fried it on butter but it was a little smoky in the kitchen from the butter. The second time I fried it w/ oil but some of the taste was lost in it.  Will definitely do it again and fry it on butter, it was worth it to keep the deliciousness of it.

I have never been a good cook, not to mention fish!  My family LOVED this.  It is on our weekly menu.  I didn't have white pepper or paprika when I made the seasoning.  So I used black pepper and seasoned salt instead of paprika/salt.  Super easy and delicious!

Great recipe! I cut the salt in half, and it was still too salty for me (I have been cutting back on my salt intake). So I only gave this recipe 4 stars. Otherwise, Very good! I put it on whole grain bread and topped it with a salad and homemade vinegrette. It was the best opened faced fish sandwich ever!! Btw, I am not a fish eater. This recipe changed my mind.

I didn't have onion powder or garlic powder, and I substituted celery salt for the celery seed and kosher salt, but it turned out quite tasty. I also served it over rice instead of white bread since I had leftover rice that needed to be eaten. Very tasty and very easy to prepare. Just beware -- it is pretty spicy. I like my food hot but if your tastes are to lower than volcano heat, cut back on the cayenne a bit.

MMMMMMMMMMM YUMMY! I made this for Mothers day dinner and it turned out GREAT! Even though I'd never made fish of any kind before, and was making two differ sides as well, it was really easy.  The only problem I had was that when I went to blacken the fish it smoked my whole house! Other then that it was a fantastic recipe and I want to make it again....just without all that smoke ;)  If anyone has any pointers on that I'd really appreciate it.

I loved the spice mixture that you rub on.  It did have a little kick and I happened to have rubbed both sides of the fillet (which were thin).  That made for a really spicy fish.  I loved it but my 7-year-old couldn't take it.  If you love spicy food, I highly recommend rubbing both sides.  If not, keep it to one side and maybe go lighter on the cayenne.  Thanks for this keeper!

This was pretty good.  I did not think it was terribly spice as others have said.  You MUST drizzle with lemon juice just before serving to bring out the taste (otherwise it is very bland), and you definitely need the 1 T of salt (it sounds like a lot, but it's not).  I seared the fish for about 3 min on each side, and then put into the George Foreman to finish cooking.  I will try this one again.

This was absolutely delicious!  I heeded others' suggestion to decrease the paprika to 2T and used 1/2 t. cayenne, but kept everything else the same.  I had no white bread, so served it over a brown rice pilaf with sides of applesauce with a sprinkle of allspice & Brilliant Sauteed Broccoli from this site.  Everybody raved and asked for more!  I am adding the recipe to my fish rotation.

Great all-around spice! It was enough to last for three different "blackened" recipes at four servings each. As for the salt comments, it depends on the thickness of the steak/fillet you are using. At the thin end of the fillet, you can definitely taste the salt, so now I just spice according to thickness.

Delicious!  I used way less salt, though -- closer to 1/2 tsp, and that was definitely sufficient.

Holy Hades, That was too hot for me...I did use Hot Hungarian Paprika at the suggested amount...I'll probably just buy a rub next time. It was great learning how to blacken fish, though.

This was good. It was little salty and next time I'll cut back a little. I coated the fish with melted butter before coating in the spices but used no oil in the pan. I made a whipped lemon butter (Butter, lemon juice, thyme and parsley) to top the fish with. I also omitted the bread. This is spicy but I thought it had just the right amount of bite. I can see why it would be too spicy for some. I would recommend cutting back on the cayenne if your not fond of spicy food.

I followed the suggestions in the  review by "walela" and we all enjoyed it. Bought the jar of blackening spices, cooked outside (due to another reviewers suggestions because of the smoke) in a cast iron skillet.  Very easy and spicy without being too hot.  Will make again.

This dish was excellent for the entire family. My mom who loves blackened fish, said that this was by far one of the most flavorful recipes she's ever had. My dad who always gets a really bad stomach ache after eating blackened anything, loved it as well and it was mild enough that he didn't get sick on it.  Both my kids, who are under the age of three, couldn't get enough of it and wanted more after their portion.  We however, so not eat much white bread, thus, we didn't add that to the dish and it was still fabulous.  There also wasn't many drippings after the fish was cooked, but the lemon did add a nice zesty taste.

This 'secret hobo' blend of spices is extremely tasty.  It is delicious with Tilapia but I wouldn't hesitate to also use this with other types of fish.

Yummy! That's all I can say. If you like cajun food, you're going to love this! I wouldn't change a thing. I served it with sweet potato fries, which added a little sweetness, and a small salad with creamy Italian dressing.

This was just ok for me.  The flavor was rather bland.  All I could taste was the cayenne pepper, and I didn't even use the amount stated.  Maybe if I play around with more spices, I might get  better results.  It sounded good, but was very disappointing.

This had a fantastic flavor! I did put it on an onion roll, we despise soggy sandwiches and didn't want to risk it. It had a nice kick and held up well on the stovetop.

I really liked the spice mixture and actually have a ton leftover for future use.  The only thing that I had a problem with is that my fish turned out more burned than blackened.  Granted I've never tried making blackened fish before so it was problem cook's error, but next time I will try cooking on Med-High instead of High like the recipe said.  Over all though, my husband who had asked for me to cook blackened fish, was extremely happy with the meal and thats all that really matters anyway.  Thanks for sharing but be careful around those hobos, you never know what they're gonna do!

This was very very good.  My husband thought it was too spicy so next time I will cut back on the cayenne.  My daughter and son-in-law came over after we finished eating and ate up the leftovers. Son-in-law raved about it! Will definitely make again.

This was great, I was looking for something a little different.  It's got some kick and blends nicely with rice and some fire grilled veggies with a little of the hobo spice mixed in.

Too spicy for my girlfriend but I loved it. I served the fish on hamburger buns. My girlfriend put a bit of mayo to cover the spice. I fried my bun in oil and the leftover spice with some lemon juice, a real delight!

This was pretty good. Way too spicy for my 5 year old, but my hubby loved it. I would add a bit more oil then called for. My pan dried up quick and we didn't have any liquid left to pure over the fish.

I had this with rice pilaf.  This was much too peppery, but the blackening is a great idea.  I also had NO pan juices.  I will cut this recipe by 1/3 for a 1/2 lb fillet.

I never would have thought to put celery on fish.  I don't know why, though, because it works very well!

I often cook for myself - in this case I just took a random amount of the spices listed, with a bit of an emphasis on the cayenne and the celery, and did one tilapia fillet, pan-fried in a bit of butter.  The spice mixture is really awesome.  I put a lot of salt in it, but sometimes that's tasty.

This is a great rub. I have used it on fish, pork, and beef. My whole family loves it. I did decrease the paprika a little, but won't next time. This makes a lot of rub. One recipe was enough for 3 different meals.

Absolutely fabulous! My boyfriend said this might be his favorite fish ever! Apparently his best friend got a hold of the leftovers, because he told me the next day that the fish I made "was money". I served this on whole wheat hamburger buns with lettuce, tomato, red onion and wasabi mayo. I cut the paprika in half as well.

I don't know if maybe some of my spices are extra hot (we don't live in the US), but I couldn't even eat this and we LOVE hot foods.  My husband ate some and said it had a good flavor if you could get past all the heat, but that it was way too hot, even for him.

This was very easy and had great zing to the flavor.  I've made it 3 times and my kids, husband and I just love it.  I do it in a cast iron fry pan which gives it a real blackend crisp taste.

I enjoyed this recipe.  It's quick and tasty.  I didn't have thyme so I used Marjoram.  I'm not very much of a fish eater but, this was full of flavor and spice.

I’m torn with this one. I scaled back the spice  rub by a lot and the one piece of fish that it stuck to was too salty and I only used 1 tsp. There was not any pan juices but the addition of the fresh lemon was nice and Mahi Mahi was a good meaty fish to use.

This turned out fantastic using catfish! We don't normally have bread in the house, so I served it over rice. Very pretty dish to serve. Thank you!!

Perfect recipe as is.  Adding a few scallions and/or cilantro with lime juice as a topping is a nice mix.  Goes great with seasoned rice from the drippings!!!

Added a tablespoon of butter to oil, and served on rice (so it was gluten-free) but note - there was no sauce! So very yummy though, I will make this again.

I didn’t add salt like some reviewers have mentioned. It would have been nicer with a juicier salad but overall very good.

This was excellent, and very spicy: Beware! The cayenne pepper adds a huge kick. Was also pretty salty.

I made with couscous rather than bread. There were definitely no leftover juices to pour on bread anyway.

We loved it.  Cut the salt in half.  Get the heavy pan good and hot and then one needs to turn the temperature down some so it won't burn.  Great flavor.  Next time - 2 lemons.

This looks amazing on the plate!  Mixed my spices - used only 3/4 of a tsp of cayenne pepper and I forgot to splash on the lemon juice.  Family thought it was a little too spicy but I loved it!  Served with a side of mashed potatoes and mixed veg - delicious!

With a few alterations, delicious! I can't manage *really* spicy food, so I omitted the cayenne and substituted a small amount of chili powder instead. I did also cut back considerably on the salt. Kosher salt, with its bigger crystals, is less salty as measured than regular table salt, but since I typically halve the salt in a recipe anyway, I did that. It was plenty salty at 1 teaspoon. But it smelled great in the pan, and my teenage boys walked in from track practice commenting how good dinner smelled. With a little squeeze of lemon, it was even better-tasting than it had smelled.

Soooo you're in the pocket of a hobo because, what now??
Anyway, I still made the recipe so next time you jackin him for whateva, let him know it was pretty good.
I seasoned the fish but the hubby brought home food so I stuck it in the fridge and cooked it the next day and still it was good.  I'll try it again to see if the only 30 minute seasoning makes a difference and I'll probably add a bit more salt.

After reading the reviews, I substituted my favorite Cajun seasoning.  It turned out to be a great way to fix Tilapia and I will be doing it again.  Served it with a pilaf and string beans.

I made this recipe as written. Instead of serving it on bread I served it with a side of couscous. Over all I liked the flavor with the exception that it was a little too salty for our tastes. Next time I make this I will reduce the amount of salt. Thanks for sharing this.

this is a great seasoning blend in the right quantity.. i scaled the recipe down to 1 serving and it was perfect for one pound of tilapia.. i ended up cooking this on our gas grill as opposed to pan frying it.. i plan on serving bf's portion in a bun so that technically counts for the white bread right? ty for the recipe

One of the best recipes on Allrecipies. I've made this for over 5 years and get rave reviews every time. I make extra seasoning and keep it in a spice jar for other fish. Made it once when my grandmother was present (she's in her 90's, and eats very little) she surprisingly requested 2nd's of this and the fried cabbage!

This dish is very relish, but spicy.  I like spicy dishes, so this was right up my alley.  I try to minimize the salt because it can become quite salty is not careful.  Also, careful with the cayenne pepper, because it also contributes to the spiciness.  Overall a very tasty, and quick to prepare dish.

This seasoning combination didn't go well together. I have had blacked tilapia many times but the flavors here did not complement each other. I was disappointed with the outcome.

I make this almost once a week.  It has definitely become a staple in my rotation.  I frequently serve it over a Caesar salad or just mixed greens & spinach with fresh lemon juice.   The seasoning works great on chicken as well.

The spiciness of this dish rendered it completely inedible and there were no pan juices. Speaking of heat, after two or three bites my mouth was on fire.

Great recipe. Flavour was great. Nice and spicy! Bit too much salt though and I only used half of what the recipe called for). The fish was moist and tender. I did not serve on bread as I don't enjoy bread. Next time i will use only 1/4 of the salt.

Very good although I think the recipe calls for too much salt, either that or I used too much salt. ingredients were just enough for the pieces of fish I needed. I'm going to add a little less spiciness because it became hard to breathe before each bite. Other than that it was delicious.

I thought this was a bit too spicy, but everyone tore it up, so I guess it was really good!

It's sad that a hobo had to lose this recipe. It is very very good. For people who think that it is too salty, please remember that kosher salt is half as salty as regular salt. Meaning if you put in 1 tablespoon of regular or sea salt, it's like putting in 2 tablespoons of kosher salt.

This is SO good. The seasoning mix yielded way more than I needed so I put it in my empty paprika container (I used the rest of my paprika on this recipe...it calls for a lot and is so worth it).  The fish can be cooked on the stove, but I chose to put it in the oven so I cook make a bunch at once.  It turned out fine.  Also, I had purchased a large amount of tilapia and seasoned it with the hobo seasoning and BEFORE I cooked it, I put a bunch of the seasoned fillets in the freezer so I would have them for another date.  When I cooked the frozen ones (defrosted) a month later, they tasted fresh and perfect.  This seasoning is excellent.

Will never have tilapia any other way from now on. I usually find fish pretty boring but the seasonings in this recipe take fish to a whole other level. Absolutely amazing!  A must try!

This is tasty, even my kids like it. We reduce the cayenne, but otherwise, perfect as is. Like others, we don't get any "pan juices" so we omit the bread. It's nummy anyway.

Tried it with small adjustments, loved it. Agreed with others, there are no remaining juices. Here are the adjustments I made: 1.5 tablespoons paprika; 0.5 teaspoons cayenne pepper; served over quinoa

Aside from cutting the serving size to four, I didn't change the recipe. It was a tad bit too salty and cooking it on high heat was a mistake. I cooked the last two on medium heat and they turned out perfectly; far fewer carcinogens. Otherwise this was a great recipe and I plan on making it again with those two slight alterations.

Too heavy on the spices.  Makes it too spicy and takes away the wonderful taste of the tilapia.

Great recipe for tilapia!  We used to eat a lot of tilapia from Lake Victoria in Uganda where the fish has wonderful flavor and experimented with tons of recipes.  This one is a great change from the usual butter, dill, and lemon type recipes.  We did not do the bread as white bread in Uganda is horrible but was great with orzo or rice. Thanks for rolling that hobo for us.

very good way of serving tilapia. i'm sure you can use this on other fish/meats as well. also, you can make the spice rub in advance and just keep it in a sealed container for quick cooking!

Pretty good, I forgot the lemon juice, but I think it would have benefited from it.  I didn't have any juice left in the pan, so I didn't use bread. I also used about half as much salt and thought that was about the right amount. This has a kick!

I made this recipe using 2.25 lbs. of tilapia and the spice blend was more than adequate (about 6 pcs. of fish). Instead of bread, I served the tilapia with linguine in a garlic/olive oil seasoning and napa cabbage. The only 'complaint' I had was from my son who doesn't care for 'real spicy'....he suggested that the cayenne pepper amount be cut possibly in half if not eradicated entirely.  As for the rest of us, we liked it the way it was.

Love it! So easy my husband was able to prep it all and I fried it up. Wish to find a way to do it without the oil, but the cayenne gave it just enough kick. We had it with Yellow Mexican rice and salsa :)

Wow- this would have been awesome if I had done maybe a teaspoon of salt... The tablespoon was WAY too salty and we could barely eat it. We ended up whipping up some Alfredo sauce and shells and mixing the fish into that to save the meal. I will make it again, I think it is a great concept- but WAY to salty for us.

This was really good. I had never tried tilapia before and the spices were just perfect. Even my fish- hating sister ate half of a fillet! I subbed black pepper for the white, and I didn't find the overall taste too spicy or salty. The only thing I noticed was that there weren't any "juices" that formed during the cooking process, but it still tasted great on the bread. Tell that hobo thanks for the great recipe!

I love spicy hot, but prefer spicy hot with flavor.  Other than the medium warm heat from three types of ground pepper, this fish was bland.  Would not make it again.

OMG, I LOVE this. I cheated and just bought Zatarains blackening seasoning to save time & amount of spices to buy. I also served it over brown rice instead of bread. I wouldn't have had any pan juices left over for bread anyways. For the brown rice:  I used the brown rice in a bag and cooked it in chicken broth instead of water, when done, I added 1 tbsp butter, some garlic salt & worcestershire sauce. I placed this fish on top of the rice. Everyone loved it. Will make again.

Delicious!  I didn't use all of the oil the recipe called for, so we didn't have any drippings.  Served with veggies and plain rice (the plain rice was nice because of the strong flavors of the spices).  

Thanks for the recipe!  Love it!

Love it!  This was added to our "must-do-again" list.  I particularly enjoyed having the satisfaction of blending the rub myself rather than shaking it from a cardboard can.  Two minutes to blend and a little extra satisfaction make it all worth while.  I recommend that this be prepared according to the recipe before making adjustments.  You will not regret it!

This was really good, and very easy.  I really liked it, but it was too spicy for my husband.  I think next time I will cook a batch for me and some with no cayenne pepper for my husband.  Also, I served it over brown rice instead of bread and it was really good!

This was really delicious. I also left out the celery seed. I paired it with the Parrothead Salad also found on this sight. The heat from the fish and the cool from the salad was a perfect combination. I will definitely make this again.

Very good and so easy! On the regular recipe rotation for sure....I did without the celery seed (personal preference) and drastically cut the salt. No white bread either, just rice and green beans. YUM!***Not as smokey as some say, think it is all about the heat level tho

Besides being intriguing (how did these secret hobo spices become known?), this was a tasty and quick dish to prepare.  I didn't serve this on bread, and omitted the celery seed and lemon because I didn't have any on hand.  Be prepared for this to smoke...a lot.  Both the boyfriend and I enjoyed it, so I'll probably be making this again.

This is an awesome recipe.  I am not a big fish lover, but I love this dish. It is very easy to make and very quick.  I pair it with rice pilaf.  I haven't tried it yet with the the bread.

I sprinkled some cajun seasoning (as suggested by a review , and added some fajita seasoning). I used the same method with my wok.  My kitchen ended up smokey, but it tasted much better than some restaurants made it. I've made it twice with no leftovers yet.

I like the idea behind this recipe.  I don't have experience with blackening.  Following the heating directions, I indeed blackened it - and I set off the smoke alarms.  I'll cut back on the cooking temp next time, and I think this will be a 5-star.  I wouldn't mind  calling it 'browned'.  Like other reviewers, I found that this makes a lot of spice rub.  UPDATE:  Confirmed - 5 star when 'browning' instead.

Excellent!  We are trying to add more fish to our diet and were looking for healthy alternatives to fried catfish.  I came across this recipe, tried it, and everyone at our house loved it.  We will definitely be cooking this on a regular basis.

I enjoyed the seasoning mix a lot. I make tilapia 2-4 times a week, sometimes more; it was nice to have a different take. I've used jerk, lemon, curry, garlic, classic fish spice mix, etc.; none have tasted quite like this. Perfect salt, perfect spice! My variations included adding more than a pinch of garlic powder, no white pepper b/c I didn't have any, lots of black pepper, no celery seed (also didn't have). I added a little flour and plain bread crumbs to the spice mix. I soaked the fish in a black pepper lemon water for a bit, sprinkled salt, I dredged it melted butter, coated with mix, and fried it on med-low heat, with oil. Very tasty; I will do this again. Oh, I didn't use the bread.

Loved this! We melted butter to put on it before the spices, and it was good. We did add some oil to the pan before cooking, and I think we could have done without it. My hubby made a little white wine sauce with the drippings and it was all very good! We ate every bite!

Not a big fan of this recipe. We love spice and heat and both my husband and I found the paprika and cayenne totally overwhelming.  We had to douse the fish with our salad vinegarette to make it palatable.  Mind you - I didn't have celery salt so maybe that would have made a difference ?? I was looking to do something different with tilapia but I would not make this again.

Anything that masks the dirty taste of tilapia is 5 stars in my book. I only eat it because it's cheap and healthy, so I always look to really spice it up - this recipe was perfect.  I did cut the spices in half because I baked it.  It was really spicy and salty so I served it top of rice and squeezed lots of fresh lemon juice on it.  Next time I would cut the salt and cayenne down even more, but everything else was wonderful.  In addition to the rice I served it with smothered okra. Will make again and again.

This was really spicy and then bread didn't do anything for me, except add extra calories. The seasoning was so thick that it made it dry, too.

It was visually appealing, but would probably be better for people who love spicy food; it was extremely spicy.  It cleared up my sinuses in a pinch.  I halfed the cayenne pepper, but it still nearly gave my sister a heart attack from the spiciness.  I ate it with a sour cream sauce I got from another recipe (it helped with the spiciness a lot).  My dad loved it though which made me happy.

Great recipe but if you plan on making this cut the salt in half or more. The other thing is the size filets being utilized here need no more than 2min per side. After I made those adjustments it was just like being in the Keys again.

Just made the seasoning and smeared it on my tilapia, let it set 5-10 minutes and cooked in the pan as described.  Oh my GOSH amazing!!  I am new to tilapia and I think I will have a hard time making it any other way.  I'm on a special diet so no bread for me and I didn't add the lemon juice but this is one of the best things I've had ever.  Mmm mmm.  When I'm done with this diet I'd like to have it with some fettucine alfredo.

omg this was SO good.  I only used around 1 tsp of salt.  I served the fish with rice and a big green salad.  Perfect meal.  My husband raved.  It was really super spicy (the kids each ate a few bites, but didn't go further, they are 3 and 4, so that was expected), but we like a meal like that every now and then.  Thanks!

This recipes is absolutely delicious. I have made it a number of times since coming across it. Even my husband enjoyed it and he is not a big fish fan. He actually said this could go on the monthly rotation (which is a big compliment).

This was really good. I only had enough paprika for 1/2 a tbsp and I only used half of the cayenne. I love spicy and found the fish still had a good kick. The full amount of cayenne wouldn't be too spicy for me but for most I'm sure. I got carried away and wasn't paying attn so I used a full tsp of celery seeds. Although I tried to pick out most of the extra celery, it was still overpowering the fish in the end. Not sure if I need to omit it altogether next time or use half the amount suggested but I didn't care for it that much. Lemon juice sprinkled on top is what sends this fish over the top. Very good.

Wasn't expecting it to be that spicy (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), but this was really good.  Good enough to leave a comment which is something I very rarely do.    I agree that the recipe made too much spice mixture (makes it easier for next time).    I also had nothing left over to pour over the fish except the lemon.  Overall an outstanding recipe, if you like spice.

I followed this recipe exactly minus the white pepper (didn't have any on hand) and served on rice instead of bread.  The fish was too spicey for my taste, but my husband loved it!  I will definitely make this again, but will probably cut back on the cayenne to better suite my taste.  I was a little skeptical of the white bread, but after trying the fish I think it would be great on a sandwich!  Great, easy and fast recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I changed the serving size and followed the directions to a T!!! I didn't get ANY juice at the end and it is extremely spicy with the red pepper overpowering the entire dish...maybe next time I'll just make the suggested serving size and hope for better results cause I really wanna like this!

I especially like the seasonings. To me 1 tbs of kosher salt is just right.  Packaged blackened seasoning is way too salty for me. Definetly will make this often.

Excellent!  Restaurant quality in my opinion.  I cut the paprika back to a Tbl because I simply didn't have as much as the recipe called for.   Only had celery salt on hand and cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp to compensate.  Still a tad bit salty, but not bad.  Served with brown rice and steamed broccoli for a delicious dinner.  No white bread though.

5 stars for the hobo encounter alone!  but the recipe itself is just as great.  tilapia is a low fat, low saturated fat, low calorie, low carbohydrate and low sodium protein source with very low levels of mercury and this is a delicious way to prepare such a wonderful creature.  make sure you've got some belgian beer on hand to wash it down (and drink one for the hobos who don't have the luxury of cooking such a delicious meal!)

woderful spice! i did not put it over white bread we ate it with sauteed green beans and home made sourdough toast with blue ceese spread. it was wonderful. my husband said it was wonderful . the only thing i will change next time will be not to put that much lemon juice over the fish.

Very easy and tasty.  I doubled the black pepper to compensate for no white pepper in the house.  I served the fish on plain white bread and the sides were roasted potatoes and carrots.  I didn't have any lemon, but had limes, so I used lime juice instead.  This is one I'll use again, and maybe next time I'll used butter instead of oil.  Butter will make it better!  This is great for a 30 minute meal.  :)

I cut the paprika to 1 tsp, but used all the cayanne - 1 tsp, which was too much for us. I dipped the filets in melted butter before dredging them in the spices, which was a mistake. Too much spice clung to the filets and the butter made the remaining spices get clumpy. I also used less. salt. Nevertheless, they were pretty tasty, though spicy.

My first blackening attempt.  My husband and I enjoyed the recipe, but did not find it spicy at all.  I cooked a second batch of Tilapia and heavily doubled the blackening seasoning and while better, we still did not find it spicy.  A cursory look around the Internet included some blackening spices with Chili Powder, so I will probably look for another rub, but thanks for posting the recipe and getting me started with blackened foods.

Very good--I used half of the cayenne pepper, and left out the bread--there were no pan juices. Had rice instead.  Served it with the dill sauce from Hudson's baked tilapia.  We'll make this again.

Wowzahs!  This fish was mighty spicy, but quite delicious.  I cut the paprika down to 2 Tbsp, and cut the cayenne and salt in half.  Served over white rice with a side salad.  Will make again!

The fish cooks really quickly so be careful. Absolutely delicious flavour. It was too spicy for my boyfriend though. So, beware if you don't enjoy spices.

DELICIOUS! I was worried that I put too much seasoning on the fish, but it's absolutely scrumptious--more is better! Unfortunately I didn't have a lot of juice left to soak in the bread, but I can only imagine how that would have tasted.

I made this dish last night and it was great. I found a blackening seasoning in the store and tried that. I made chicken for the family and fish for me. Both came out crispy on the outside and very moist inside. There wasn't any pan juices, so I served with a rice pilaf. Will definately make again.

We really enjoyed this recipe, but found it necessary to make a few changes.  We cut the salt and the cayenne in half, and didn't serve over bread.  There were no juices left over, so it wasn't served over bread.  Even so, it turned out wonderfully.

My boyfriend made this recipe for me. We did not eat it on bread, but instead we ate it by itself with some veggies. It was really good! We are from down south so the spicy taste was a bonus for us! I am a fan of lemon juice so I added a little extra on top before I ate mine!

The reviewer that said Emeril's Essence was similar is right, except Emeril's doesn't have celery seed.  I used Emeril's Essence and made sandwiches with mayo and tomato.  No liquid left in the pan.  I loved it, but my husband thought the seasoning was a little too much and overpowered the tilapia.

It was ok. Could use a little work on the spices. I paired it with a black bean and corn salsa and rice. That should have worked well, but the flavors just didn't mix. I would welcome some recommended side dishes.

I was looking for something new for fish, always make the same two recipes.  Didn't have a lot of Paprika so I did 1T paprika and 1T coriander.  Makes a really nice crust over the fish and a beautiful color.

Absolutely fantastic!  I've come this site for numerous recipes and although I've really enjoyed so many of them, this has been the best by far!  I did cut the cayenne pepper down by half and also added a teaspoon of lemon pepper. My boyfriend and I love it and I've already shared it with many of my coworkers!

The 5 stars are from my husband. He said it was the absolute best preparation of tilapia he had ever had. I did not have all the dry spices on hand so, I substituted lemon grass and adobo for the celery, onion and garlic powders and added a heaping teaspoon of curry powder (what really made the dish for me). The color was great, the heat was just right,  just a wonderful recipe.

I enjoyed this quite a bit, and so did five out of six eating it for dinner. I served it over rice instead of the bread, but saved some for sandwiches the next day. It had just the right amount of kick to it to let you know it was there without overpowering the fish it self.

I just made this recipe and I loved it. I didn't think it was too spicy. Since some other posters said that they had no sauce at the end for their bread, I just put some lemon juice in the pan and scraped up the pieces that were on the bottom. I put the hot fish fillets directly on the piece of bread and it kind of toasted it a little then, I spooned on the sauce. The fish and bread both were delicious!

Very good, definately spicy, but that is what I expected.  Like others said there was no juice for the bread to soak up.  I served with brown rice instead.

Very good!  I made a few substitutions (used catfish instead of tilapia, olive oil instead of vegetable oil, served with rice instead of bread), but it still tasted very good.  My only complaint was that I think 3 minutes on high was a bit much.  Next time I think I'd cook the fillets on medium-high heat instead.

A keeper! The paparika made it too hot & hid the other flavors, so I'll use less next time. Also reduced the salt. There's plenty of powder to coat, so use liberally. There's no leftover juice, so bread is out. Served over rice

We really loved the taste of this fish, but there was no juice to soak up with the bread, so I served it over rice. It was very very spicy, so next time I would cut way down on the cayenne pepper.

This is a good and fast recipe.  I squeezed some lime juice with it (out of lemon when I first tried it) and it tasted good.  There was no sauce left from the pan.  Next time I might try to squeeze some lemon or lime juice in the pan to make sauce.

While I generally love blackened fish and meats, I really did not care for this dish at all.    This is my first disappointment with a high-rated recipe on this site.
