This chicken came out PERFECTLY! I had about a 4 lb chicken and made a couple alterations to the recipe. I mixed the garlic and rosemary with a little melted butter, less than 1 tbs., and rubbed it all over and inside the chicken. I stuffed the inside with a couple onions chopped in half and squeezed lemon juice all over the bird and stuffed the lemons in there as well. I also added some  rosemary sprigs inside and out. I cooked it at 350 for 1 hr 40 minutes, occasionally basting it. I added baby carrots, seasoned with salt & pepper, to the roasting pan. The chicken was so moist and juicy, all my friends loved it.  Plus, the carrots turned out delicious too. Very good !

The ultimate keep-it-simple recipe. I made this for dinner last night, paired with a simple sage dressing and white wine gravy.  The only tweak I made was to add a little thyme to the rosemary, and I added half of a yellow onion to the inside of the bird. Whenever I roast poultry, I’m sure to keep it covered for the first hour or so of roasting time, this ensures that the meat stays nice and moist. Then I remove the covering for the remaining time to give the skin that nice crispy brownness. Careful about using drippings for gravy if you are generous with the lemon…mine was a little tart, but still yummy. I’ll use this recipe again and again.

I doubled the garlic.  I used a mortar and pestle to grind the rosemary and garlic (and salt & pepper) with 1 Tbs. olive oil then rubbed under the skin of the chicken as well as the outside; it kept the breast from drying out.  I stuffed the inside with a piece of celery, onion, 1/2 lemon and sprig of rosemary.  Very tender and juicy.

Delicious yet so simple. I like a stronger flavor so I doubled the rosemary and garlic and made a rub with the salt. It's a big hit in our family!

I cooked the prepared chicken on the rotisserie and it was absolutely wonderful. I personally don't use much salt, so I omitted it and I think it tasted great without the salt.

As written this is good and simple. With changes it can be something special. I had to add spices and onions to make it work for us as a 4. Thanks for the post.
