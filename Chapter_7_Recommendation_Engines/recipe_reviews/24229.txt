These were a big hit at the party.  I added thinly shredded lettuce, minced onion, and chopped black olives.  Layering these items worked as effectivly as adding them to the mixture.

Though this recipe was well received I found the flavour too intense.  I think I will adjust the amount of package flavouring to half and maintain the rest of the ingredients as they are.

I added some chopped black olives and a couple of green onions to improve texture.  Easy to make and quick to disappear!

Quick & Easy & Tasty!  I nuked the tortillas for 10 seconds so that they were easier to roll up.  I also cut them in 3" sections, less work that way!

I have no clue why this got such good reviews.  I made this for a group of 12 adults in tortilla form and as a dip, and received no compliments on it. At the end of the night when I asked what everyone thought of the recipe, we actually had a conversation about how bad it was....ranch mix was overpowering although I only added half the packet, it was better as a dip, people actually wanted to get rid of the flavor in their mouth after eating it etc.  I do not recommend this recipe.  If anything make it as a dip, not in rollup form.  Sorry to be so negative.

These were a big hit at several parties. I might add some olives or nuts to them next time. I also made these ahead and froze them.

Very tasty and not difficult to make. I took these to a cook-out last weekend and everyone loved them. I also couldn't find the Fiesta Style Ranch dressing pckg, so used regular. Used lite cream cheese and lite sour cream (NOT fat free!) Since some other reviewer's mentioned the filling was runny after slicing, I let my salsa drain in a colander for a few minutes before adding to the filling( I used the fresh refrig. salsa)and that eliminated the problem of too much liquid in the filling. Also used Joseph's Lavosh; the rectangular shape worked well for spreading and rolling. Refrigerated the rolls in plastic wrap for 3 hours, then sliced about 1/2 inch thick. They turned out very attractive and tasty. I'll make these again, maybe adding some other veggies!

Very good recipe, and one of the best features of this recipe is its flexibility.   I agree with the others that you'd best back way off on the ranch dressing mix or taco seasoning.   You don't need it at all, so add it sparingly, or taste as you go.      You can add any or all of the following with great results: small can of chopped olives (or perhaps half a can), small can of diced green chiles, a tablespoon or so diced jalapenos, 2-4 green onions.  A few reviewers seem to have missed the step about chilling in the refrigerator before serving.  You have to do this in order to firm up the rolls, as well as allowing the flavors to marry.  Give them several hours at least, but not too long or the tortillas can get soggy.   It's a critical step.  Don't mess with the low fat versions, especially if taking it to a party.   People trying to lose weight aren't going to be scarfing these down and do you really want to run around the party telling people how the dish you brought is "low fat and healthy"?

Made this for a party and was a HUGE hit.  I made the mix and let it sit overnight.  Assembled the next day, and placed in the freezer for 30 minutes to make it easier for cutting.  I've had numerous people ask me for the recipe!

These were fantastic. I did modify them, I used taco seasoning instead of ranch, I added black olives and sliced green onions. I used jalapeno cheddar and spinach flavored wraps instead of the tortillas, but it was really great. I made them for 3 events over the holidays and people finished them off every time! The only suggestion I have is to not cut them when they are not really cold or they will end up sort of squished. If you want them to look like the picture, make sure you layer the toppings pretty thick and cut it when it's pretty cold. People will love these if you make them!

I made two batches of these for a football party and they were a big hit.  I got three kinds of tortillas (sundried tomato basil, jalepeno cheddar and regular flour) and they were as pretty as they were tasty!

The only difference I made was to use flavored tortillas and add sliced lunch meat (ham with sun-dried tomato tortillas, and turkey with spinach tortillas).  I've made them several times and they're always a huge hit!

The rollups are very good and are great for parties...they look very pretty. Make sure the rollups are refrigerated for a while before cutting..the flavors have to mix together and the mixture needs to get hard enough to cut without being messy. I cut them with a seraded knife.

I used this recipe at a Halloween party and everyone loved them!  It was a last minute change to my menu so I had to use 1/2 packet of taco seasoning and a 1/2 packet of ranch dressing mix, which worked great. I also used sun-dried tomato tortillas and added one can of hot green chiles and some chopped green onions. To keep the wraps tightly rolled I wrapped them in foil while they chilled. This would be a great spread on any layered mexican dip or served as a dip itself with tortilla chips. Thanks! I will definitely use this one again!

I love these types of roll ups when other ppl make them so I decided to try them for a recent get together...quite delicious but I also only used 1/2 the fiesta ranch packet- I put half in & then tasted it and felt it was on its way to too salty but half was good. I added diced red pepper for some crunch.  The only thing I did wrong was spread too much on the tortillas, it was too much filling per piece. I tried to spread it thinly but I guess not thinly enough and will do it more sparingly next time. This time I used 5 12 inch tortillas, next time I will spread it out to 7 or 8 I think!

These were a huge success at our superbowl party - only suggestion is using a super sharp serrated knife to cut with otherwise you'll squish the rollups!

Great for parties! It's basically the cream cheese/sour cream layer of a taco dip in a wrap.  I used taco seasoning (also from this site) instead of the ranch dressing and drained the salsa before mixing it with the cheese. I added oven roasted turkey on some of the wraps. I did refrigerate the wraps all day before cutting them; I did not have problems slicing them as others did.  So maybe they did not chill them long enough?  I also did not have any problems with soggy wraps; maybe the draining of the salsa took care of that. This definitely will be saved as a good party recipe.  Thanks!

Took to work - all gone, and have shared the recipe.  Made the cream cheese and spread on the tortillas the night before and put in the fridge rolled up in a baggie then sliced and plated the next day - it was worth it, the flavors had time to meld together.  Instead of using dry ranch dressing, I used 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning and somce chopped green onion.

I've made this several times and there are never any leftovers. The base recipe is excellent but it is easily altered to fit peoples tastes. I've used different cheeses, I've sometimes added chopped jalapenos or green onions or green chiles and it's always popular. It is however, imperative that you chill these overnight and slice right before serving.

I love these...I've made them many times and everyone asks for the recipe.  But I do caution you, if you do not eat them within the day of making them, the flour tortillas tend to get "gummy".  I've had better luck making them with wraps, such as wheat or sun-dried tomato.

Served these at my child’s party and the adults went crazy!  Only had 2 slices left!  My changes were:  2 blocks Neufchatel/cream cheese (no sour cream), increased cheddar to 2 cups added 1 can sliced black olive.  The key:  refrigerate OVER NIGHT before slicing and texture will be perfect!  Yum Yum!!! Everyone wanted the recipe!!!

Everyone loves these.  I'm always asked to bring them to my work potlucks. Some reviews here have complained about sogginess.  I use about 1.5 packs cream cheese to thicken it up and only 1/2 cup of sour cream and don't have any soggy issues.

I have been making these for over a year now, and they are a hit with everyone I know. Have to make a few batches as Christmas presents, as requested by my friends. I use 2 packages of dried beef , cut up, and puree my salsa. Be sure to soften the cream cheese well for better blending. Wrap in foil and REFRIGERATE OVER NIGHT, for easy slicing.

this is so simple, yet so good.  I made it for basketball playoff snacks for my co-workers and it was a hit.

I doubled the recipe, so I used one punch of fiesta ranch and one pouch of taco seasoning.  I like spicy food, so I think it could use a little more flavor. I was going to add some jalapenos, and didn't, now I wish I did.  Onion would have been good also.  It's still a great, easy recipe.

Awesome! I did find the mixture a little too thin, so I added an extra package of cream cheese. Boy did these get rave reviews, I will definately be making these again soon!

This recipe is fabulous!! I just made this and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. It is quick and easy and can be made ahead of time and put in the freezer. Just wrap each tortilla roll up in plastic wrap and then place them in a freezer bag. Be sure to thaw out in the fridge.

I have to say that I was not a big fan of this recipe. As another reviewer stated, the ranch was overwhelming. It was just too much. I felt like the flavor needed to be toned down a bit, and I am a huge fan of seasoning. I hate to wast food, but this was something that I just had to. I'm also sorry to be so negative, I just didn't like it.

The Flavor was nice although by the time we ate they were very mushy, it seemed the mixture soaked into the shells. No one ate these after trying one.

Didn't have the fiesta style dry ranch so I just used the regular dry ranch dressing mix. Very good, I accidently forgot to add the shredded cheese but these were still good.

I could not find the dressing mix, but my husband found some spicy ranch dressing in a bottle that did the job.  I mixed 1/2 cup of the dressing with 1/2 a cup of the sour cream to thicken it up a bit.  Also added chopped black olives and green onions to this.

This is a great recipe!  I added some corn and sliced black olives for color and texture.  I ran out of flour tortillas and switched to corn, which I didnt like as much.  I still ended up with leftover filling so I put it on a bagel :)  I also didn't have fiests ranch as my commissary doesn't carry it so I used mostly taco seasoning with some regular ranch seasoning instead.  Still great taste.

Very tasty recipe! I decided to trim it down a bit by using fat free cream cheese, light sour cream, fat free shredded cheddar cheese and low carb small mission flour tortillas. The turned out very good! I didn't have the seasonings called for so I used 1/2 a Lowry's Chicken Taco seasoning packet and it turned out great. Finally, I sauted a few hamburger patties until crumbly with a tsp of the seasoning salt. I added this to the spread. Yum! It made 12 tortillas and each one has 7 grams of fat, 23 carbs and 17 grams of protein! They are a meal all by themselves and great with a simple salad on the side!  I also put them in the freezer until verrry firm before trying to cut them into pinwheel slices. Worked Great!

These are awesome!!  This is the 1st review I have ever done.  I have made these over 100 time.  I actually combine this recipe with anouther.  I follow the directions exactly, but then add diced avacado, diced red bell pepper, and a few spinach leaves.  Then top with the shredded cheese. I am asked to bring these as an appetizer all the time.  Thank you!!

I used this recipe this weekend for my wedding reception which was on the 7th and they were so good that my husband ate mine so I didn't even get to take them! :-) I didn't use the fiesta-style ranch dressing mix and I added more chunky salsa. I made enough for 200 people only about 75 people showed up and there were no leftovers of this tray. I am making another batch for home so I can taste it this time. Thanks DOREENB for helping make my reception a hit!

I really liked this recipe.  I mixed the cream cheese with sour cream dry dressing in the food processor to mix it fast and easy, then handstirred the rest in.  We used HOT salsa to give it a little kick but it was not too hot.  Made 1/2 with turkey and 1/2 without. It is very soft when you spread it and my first thought was oh .  But it firmed up nicely.  Didn't drain the salsa butdid chill it for 10 hours before slicing (I think you would be better with a chunkier less "saucy" salsa). You might want to think about using a lower-sodium taco seasoning (maybe even a pure chili powder??) as it was a little salty for my tastes.  But they wiped up the entire platter so I think it was quite the hit.  Will make again.

This recipe was very good.  I took it to a football party & it was the only item that was completely gone at the end of the night.  I only used half of the ranch mix & skipped the sour cream.  I made this the day before the party & the flavors were great, the tortillas did not get soggy either.  Will definitely make this again for future parties.

This recipe is really good. The only thing I would change is using less of the ranch dip mix. I halved the recipe and the 1/2 ounce of dip mix was a bit much. I still really enjoyed the rollups, but the ranch dip mix was a bit overpowering. I used homemade tortillas (I am so proud!) from this site (Authentic Mexican Tortillas) because I bought stale tortillas at the store. I will definitely make these again, however I will use less ranch dip mix. I encourage you to try making tortillas at home. They are easy and delicious. Combined with this excellent filling, they are remarkable. Thank you for the recipe!

i could have used more direction on what type of tortilla to buy and the best way of "rolling" them. Also, the flavor of the filling was way too strong, I would try putting in 1/2 the ranch mix first and then adding to taste. Definitely add cilantro. I ended up buying huge burrito tortilla's cutting them in fourths and wrapping from there.

This is a great appetizer that's easy to make and everyone loves it! I used normal ranch mix & used Mexican shredded cheese...and they were great. Did cut back on the sour cream to about a half cup so it wouldn't be so soft. Will definately be making this for future parties.
YUMMY!

These were a big hit on the dinner table. Definitely add the dry ranch dressing mix to taste - I used not quite half a package and thought it was a bit much. I added a can of rinsed and dried black beans spread between 6 super large spinach wraps after spreading the cheese mixture on them. Made these about 3 hrs before serving and when I went to cut, decided to freeze 10 minutes to help firm up prior to cutting.  They cut cleanly after the brief time in the freezer.  Very easy to customize and they've already been asked for again.

Have served this twice now, once at a bridal shower and once at a super bowl party. Both times it was a big hit. Once I couldn't find the spicy Ranch dressing mix so I used the regular. It came out just fine. One thing to watch out for: It makes more filling than can be used on 10 tortillas. So, maybe have a few extra tortillas on hand, or some crackers to eat the rest of the filing on. YUM!

I made these to take to a party last night and they were devoured quickly.  I added a couple of things based on other reviews.  Added 1/2 package of Hidden Valley Ranch mix and a little taco seasoning as well (did not measure).  I also added 3 chopped green onions.  I served with some salsa for optional dipping, but they were good all by themselves.  Will make again for sure!

Made these for a shower yesterday and they were a hit!  I added 1/2 can of green chiles, 1/2 can of black olives, and used closer to 3/4 cup of sour cream.  It was very good and made about 12-14 tortillas and I had leftover filling!  Served with salsa for dipping.

Yes, I made these & you need to pay attention to how much of the ranch dressing mix you add. Also, I added about a 1/2 lb. of thinly chopped deli ham too. It made the recipe totally awesome, everyone loved it. It's best to store the tortillas overnight, it makes it easier to slice & marries all the flavors together.

Yum! I made these to take to a party and the plate was empty at the end of the night! That's good in my book. I did add some green onions and roasted red peppers. I read the other review about it being too salty and added seasoning a tablespoon at a time until it tasted right. The recipe really made a lot of filling. I only used about half for 10 tortillas. The rest of the filling we just used as dip for wheat thins and that was pretty good!

I love the zip the dry ranch dressing gives  the wraps.  I left the salsa out of the mixture and used it to dip the roll ups in.

This was sooo easy and good.  You can't make it right before you need it though.  Tried making it last minute, and the roll-ups didn't work.  I ended up bringing it to the party as a dip with pretzels which was also amazing.  It tasted awesome with the tortillas, but I couldn't get them to roll and cut.  I think you have to prepare them, let them sit for a few hours to soften the shells, and then cut them.   Will Make again!  Very addicting.

These were great, they were gone so fast wish I had made more. I used fat free cream cheese, fat free sour cream, low fat cheese and also added half a package of taco seasoning. They came out very flavorful and nobody would have guessed they were very low fat.

LOVE these!   So simple and you can change them up to whatever you have on hand.  I added regular ranch mix and taco seasoning to the mixture.  Didn't have a single one left.

I like these!  The flavor is pretty vibrant, but I like that!  I even added a little bit of fresh, chopped cilantro.  I am probably the worst at making rollups pretty, but I sure did like the way these tasted!!  They would go great with a mexican fiesta themed party!

Crowd pleaser!  When slicing, I like to trim the ends off first to have clean edges.  The filling went further than 10 tortillas.  You don't need as much spread on each tortilla as you'd think.  A little goes a long way.

I made these for my friend's baby shower and they were quite a hit!  I would rate it at 4.5 starts if I could.  They are absolutely delicious.  However, I would suggest decreasing the ranch mix (use maybe 1/2 to 3/4 of the package) - the fiesta ranch flavor was pretty strong with the whole packet, so I had to add more cheeses to compensate.

I did not care for this...but in defense of the recipe owner, my store didn't carry Fiesta Ranch so I used taco seasoning instead.  It was not good.

This honestly just didn't do anything for me. The filling just needed something extra, maybe beans or a meat, to give it better texture. The tortillas didn't flatten on me, since I chilled them overnight, but the cold plus the filling just made the whole rollup soggy. I gave them two stars because my husband and father in law liked them.

I made this as one various adult appetizers I served for my son's 8th birthday party and it was gone within the first 15 minutes.  Everyone asked for the recipe and couldnt eat just one.  I added one green bell pepper and one yellow bell pepper for crunch and kalamata olives (which I sliced myself)for a bit more flavor.  I'll be making these for xmas as well.  Love it!!

If you're looking for a very quick and delicious crowd pleaser, this is sure to be a hit. I used lowfat sour cream and cream cheese and found the Fiesta Ranch dressing packet at my local super Walmart. I spread a good portion of the mixture all over the tortillas to help them hold together (and only used 9 tortillias). Also, I used a very good and sharp knife to cut them. They turned out very attractive and extremely delicious.

I wasn't super happy how these came out... I can't say it was all the recipes fault though.  THey didn't look awesome but everyone said they tasted great! I would suggest keeping them refrigerated for at least 3 hours before trying to cut.

I used sundried tomato, jalepeno cheese, and regular tortillas.  I couldn't find the fiesta-sytle ranch so I used half of a regular ranch package mixed with a little of a mild taco seasoning mix.  I used taco shredded cheese and only about half the sour cream and it was light.  Some tortillas I wrapped with black olives and green onions.  I also added just a little of chopped cilantro to the mix.  Plus salt and pepper.  I really think the salsa needs to be one that you really like.  I used Pace chunky salsa and I think next time I'll try a different salsa.  I made it the night before.  Wrapped each tortilla tightly in foil.  It was hard to determine how much to spread on because when you roll some of it squeezes out if you put too much on.  Then the next day before the party, I sliced the wraps.  Everyone liked them.  And I'm glad I did a variety.  I'll make this again.

These had a really good flavor.  I used 2 packages of cream cheese instead of one like a few others suggested.  My only complaint is that they became very messy to eat after sitting out even for a very short amount of time.  I would only make these again if I could put out a few at a time and keep the rest refrigerated.  Wouldn't take these to a party where they would be sitting out.

Tastes awesome!! These really are a big hit with kids as well as adults just as described. I had kids racing to get to the leftovers and adults slapping their hands (jokingly) to get their share. I'm glad I tried this recipe - I can't understand how anyone could give it less than five stars.

These rollups were fantastic.. super quick and easy to make. I make a variation of these using ham, but these went fast on Christmas when I served them with salsa and tortilla chips. This recipe is a keeper!

I only use about 1/4 of both the sour cream and dip mix, it can be too strong. But the biggest (and best) change I make is, after chilling for several hours, I slice no more than 1/2” thick, lay them flat on a cookie sheet, and bake at 350 for 10-15 minutes. SO much better than just cold!

Came out wonderful but I omitted the Ranch seasoning since I personally am not a fan. After I rolled the tortilla up with the mixture, I also rolled it in parchment paper and placed it in the freezer for 2 hours. This made it easier to slice without the filling making a mess.

Great start. Do what you want from here. Very good as is! I use black bean and corn salsa mostly for appearance. No olives for us.  Add little fine onion, garlic powder.  Note to self, leave  out ranch, add chili powder.

I cut the salsa and sour cream in half, otherwise I made this as directed. I took them to a birthday party and only they were pretty popular. Even my mom, who hates anything spicy liked them.

Meh. The seasoning gave it a kick but the texture needed some crunch or something to break it up.

I made these for our scout Christmas party, and there were none left, so something had to be right!

Of course, we're in Texas, and maybe you have to be accustomed to a little more spice to appreciate their flavor.

Easy and quick! Following others reviews, I only used half the package of seasoning mix, and the taste was perfect. I also made the filling ahead of time, let it sit for a few hours to marry the flavors, and then spread in the tortillas a couple hours prior to serving, so the tortillas did not end up soggy. Served as an appetizer at Christmas, people gobbled them up within the first half an hour, and everyone wanted the recipe!

The ranch seasoning and salsa are a bit much. It needs onions, olives and maybe some corn to give it texture.

I made this for a snack day at work, and it is a huge hit!!  I used my own taco seasoning mix that I make (instead of the ranch fiesta mix), and I used Pace thick and chunky salsa (drained the excess juice off).  I've had coworkers asking for the recipe (and where I hid the extra rolls) all day!  I'm definitely making this again, and keeping the extra rolls hidden! :)

As written these were close to inedible.  I couldn't see wasting all of the ingredients so I added another 4 oz of cream cheese, 1/2 C of shredded cheddar, cumin, chile powder, a little extra salsa, green onion, and diced jalapeños.  Perfection!  People couldn't get enough!!!

I just made this, and made a few changes.  I omitted the salsa, and added a 10 oz can of chicken.  It was VERY good! The fiesta ranch gives it great flavor. My kids wouldn't eat it as the "roll up" version, so I left some in a dish and they used it as a dip with Ritz crackers! Will definitely make again.

These were just ok, not nearly as flavorful as I'd hoped. To be fair, I've never cared for tortilla roll-up type appetizers and just hoped this one would win me over. I just don't think they are my kinda thing, and if they are yours, you will probably like this recipe!

I made these for my other half to take to a snack day.  I used 3 different colored wraps for presentation.  I wrapped the logs overnight in the fridge which made them easy to cut the next morning.  The trick is to make sure you have the mixture all the way to the end of the wrap.  All of the women in his department had to have the recipe!

I made this for large groups of kids and got mixed reviews. They found it to be too rich and the ranch flavour can be a little overpowering. I suggest using less cream cheese and less ranch dressing mix. This also makes alot so be sure to have enough tortillas!

These were absolutely outstanding.  I made them for a tailgating party and they were completely gone before the game even started.  I was unable to find the fiesta dip mix that the recipe calls for so I just used taco seasoning and it was just fine.  In addition I like things a bit on the spicy side so I used HOT salsa and it gave the rollups a lot of kick.  Finally I think even more flavor was added by using the jalapeno cheddar tortillas.  As many have mentioned, make sure you refrigerate these overnight so that they are easy to cut the next day.  I left mine in for 12 hours and using a sharp knife I had no problems and they didn't become disfigured when sliced.  I'm already planning to make these again for a work party tomorrow.

These are really easy and super good. Just make sure you cream everything really well (cream cheese well softened) or it you will be able to see the chunks of cheese in it. icky.

They are very good. I took the advice of others and use 1/4 of the fiesta ranch packet and 1/2 of the sour cream. I also added diced black and green olives along with shredded ham. Took to work and everyone enjoyed!

I love stuff like this, it is a good idea for a school-agers lunch (different than a plain ole' sammy) anyways they can be done a varity of ways, with ham pinapple and crm cheese, or turkey ranch dip (or dressing) and avacodos, or tuna (made w mayo and mustard) mixed with apples and raisins --- endless possibilities! and my 5 year old loves to take "new" things to lunch. Many thumbs up

I'd suggest using no more than 1/4 of the seasoned ranch packet.  I used about half of the packet (after reading some reviews) and even that made the rollups quite salty.  I think they'd be good w/out any add'l seasoning, and by adding some chopped black olives and a couple splashes of hot sauce. Other than the saltiness, I had no other complaints.

I have made this multiple times for gatherings and it always draws the same reaction.  

First, "what is this??" people tend to think it's ham salad bc of it's color.  After several people try it the rollups usually disapear within minutes.

These are so amazing...I made them for a Super Bowl party last year and plan to repeat it this year! I add chopped black olives to the mixture. I find that taco seasoning adds good flavor, but can be overwhelmed by the salsa...so season to your taste. People are so impressed by these at parties...they think you spent more time on them than you actually did.

This recipe was incredibly easy and made a TON!  I had two layers of them on a huge platter for bunco and every single one of them were eaten.  I still had 6 tortillas that I didn't even slice (due to lack of room) in the fridge!  My husband took them to work today and they were devoured immediately.  The only thing I changed was to use a block and a half of cream cheese and half a cup of sour cream instead of equal parts.  I also sprinkled diced green chiles on top.  Excellent, EASY recipe!

I made this the night before a party and sliced them up the next day but the tortillas got too soggy. The ingredients inside were very tasty but the soggy tortilla ruined it for me.

Not bad. I used jalapeno cheddar tortillas, and added chopped black olives, diced mild green chiles, and mexican blend cheese instead of the cheddar. I made ahead of time, and my tortillas were a bit soggy the next day, but not terribly bad. My coworkers seemed to enjoy them, as did I. Thanks!

I loved this recipe.  It has been a hit several times over. I added deli ham and turkey and have made it as a small dinner treat. Also Mission has some different flavored tortillas and for the Christmas season, I used the red and green variety.  Taste just as good with regular tortillas.

This was easy and good but the ranch flavor is a little strong if you eat more than a couple at a time.  Not a favorite for me or my husband but my 4 year old loved them.

Great with a few changes: 2 pkgs cream cheese as other suggested; ditched the sour cream; added 1/2 a diced red pepper for some crunch; went easy on the salsa so wouldn't be too runny; used about 1 cup cheddar so wouldn't be too gummy; added a dash of cayenne for a little more kick.  5 stars with these changes.

Great recipe, HUGE hit at my girls spa weekend.  Made a double recipe and 7 women at them ALL!  I used light cream cheese and light sour cream.  Perfect for by the pool, easy to eat while our nails were drying, what more could you ask for?  Will definately make again and again!

This versatile recipe lends itself to variations. I added some chopped black olives, roasted red pepper, green onion and green chiles. I served this at my daughter's college graduation party and the guests loved the rollups. Use your imagination!

These were just ok...not too flavorful when made exactly by the recipe.  I will definitely try again with a little tweaking and adding more filling to each tortilla.

I made a double batch of these to take to work but wasn't happy with the way they were turning out.  I didn't want to waste the filling though, so I plopped it down on a bed of lettuce and topped with salsa and shredded cheese.  The impromptu taco dip turned out to be the hit of the party!

My family like this recipe well enough.  I didn't have ranch dressing mix so I used dill instead.  It tasted really good.  I found it difficult to roll them if I went to close to the edge.  They are much easier to work with after refrigeration.  I will make these again.

Got many compliments on this one. Makes alot of rollups. I liked that it can be made ahead of time. Thought it could use a little heat maybe by using a medium salsa or some green chiles. Still was pretty good.

I tried this according to the recipe the first time, and they were GREAT!!  The second time I wanted a personal touch so I used a little less ranch, added an extra 1/4 cup salsa, used Mexican Taco cheese, plus I put slivered ham on some of the roll ups EXCELLENT!!!

Made these for a graduation party and they were the first dish gone!  Very easy.  I only had an hour to chill them before slicing and because of this they didn't really "set" so slicing them was a mess.  Next time I may increase the amount of cream cheese or decrease the amount of sour cream.

Huge hit at the oyster roast I took it too. Thanks for such a great recipe! Made recipe exactly as listed, though I did zap tortillas in microwave to make easier to work with. Yum!

I tried this recipe last weekend for a volleyball tournament.  I did add green onions.  I had other mothers coming up to me and requesting the recipe which is a new experience for me. Will make this again.

I found this to be more like a dip with the cup of sour cream, very messy to make. Probably will not make them again.

These were really easy and looked more difficult.  I wasn't a huge fan, but my family liked them.

I wasn't very impressed with these. I think this would be much better as a dip rather than a rollup.

These are the best tortilla roll-ups I've tried!  I used to make a version with herbed cream cheese and olives, but I liked these with the salsa much better.   I added slice ham to some of them, and we ate them whole as "sandwiches" for lunch the next day.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Very Good! I used regular ranch mix and a jar of medium salsa, and it was hot enough. I accidentally bought low fat sour cream and it was still really good. I brought this to a party and several people asked for the recipe.

Best tortilla roll-up recipe I've tried.  The sour cream makes it a nice consistancy.  I only had regular Ranch mix, and also added some cajun seasoning, some minced green onions and finely chopped cilantro for extra spice and color.  Will make these often!

Very tasty...I used some ranch dressing instead of the mix and left out the cheese and it was still flavorful and delicious!
