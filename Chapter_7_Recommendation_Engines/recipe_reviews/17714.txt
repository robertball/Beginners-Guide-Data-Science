I misplaced my recipe for this dessert, so I tried this one. It's very good, a couple of different steps than my mom's (adding the milk & butter), but it still tastes the same.

*I made this a 2nd time, only changing a couple things, and it came out even better, I think!
I added 1 tsp vanilla, 2 Tbl coffee granules to 2 Cups water, baked at 325' for 40 mins.

This was awesome!  I did change one thing:  Instead of pouring hot water on top, I poured freshly brewed coffee.  This made the cake have such a fantasic flavor. I can't wait to have it again.

This makes a fantastically rich,fudgey chocolate pudding. The only change I made was that I put in just under one cup of hot water, just enough to turn the sugar and cocoa layer liquidy and nothing more. The  sauce that formed was rich and thick...just perfect for my tastes :)

A little bit thin tasting because there is so little fat in it I guess, but this recipe was so good, especially considering how (relatively) healthy it is! I used the suggestions of some other reviewers and used brewed coffee instead of water over the cake mix; I also mixed some vanilla and almond extracts into the coffee. It seems like you could tweak the recipe any way you want in order to get the flavor you want - I'm thinking next time of adding some spices like chipotle powder and cinnammon to make it into a sort of mexican hot fudge cake. A very good choice for something easy to make and with lots of chocolate flavor. oh, and another time I made it I used a ruby port wine that I had sitting around - it made it fruity and richer and also left it with a hint of an alcohol taste. would be good for a christmas dessert.

We have had this exact same recipe for years with one difference.  We bake it in the microwave for 10-12 minutes on high. I also add 1 tsp vanilla and about 1/2 cup of whatever nut I happen to have on hand.  This is perfect for when you are watching a movie at night and feel like something freshly made, sweet, and fassssst!

This is sooooo good! I used brown sugar instead of white, lowered the water to 1 1/3 cup, and added a splash of vanilla. It's perfect with a little vanilla ice cream ontop and is just as good warmed up the next day!

This was just not good. I would definitely not add as much water as called for, but even without that, I would not make again.

This was delicious!  Very easy too.  Mine was perfect at 40 minutes, even though my oven cooks things very fast.  I did not decrease the water- loved the amount of hot pudding/fudge this produced on the bottom.  I added vanilla to the water (would have added it to the batter but I forgot).  We had this with ice cream and it was gone in one sitting!  My kids, my husband, and myself LOVED it!  My mom made something just like this when I was little.

This is a very good recipe for a dish I've made several times before.

I followed the advice of many reviews and added an extra tablespoon of cocoa and a teaspoon of vanilla to the cake mix, reduced the amount of liquid to 1 1/3 cups, and used coffee for part of the liquid.

The sauce was exactly the right consistency, but I used a cup of coffee and 1/3 cup of water, and next time I'd probably just use half and half.  The coffee adds excellent flavor, but too much will give it a bitter tinge.

It's hard to get that chocolatey-brownie taste with only cocoa, so sometime I might try adding melted chocolate or chocolate chunks to the batter.  

Delicious served warm, this is a great comfort food for a chocaholic.  Thanks!

This is so good and so easy to make!  I haven't made one of these in years and it tasted just like I remember.  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla like another reviewer suggested.  This will satisfy your sweet tooth especially with a little of ice cream thrown in.  Thanks for the recipe!

divine!  added chocolate chunks and used 1 1/2 c coffee instead of water.  Moist, dense, exactly a mix between pudding and cake.  Only problem was the brown sugar hardened up immediately and was more of a crunchy topping...Not sure what i did wrong?

Easy recipe for a quick chocolate fix. Instead of white sugar, I used Splenda which caused the texture to be a little weird. The cake tasted better as leftovers, heated up and topped with Cool whip.

Like the one I remember. Good, easy. I used brewed coffee for the water and it was good, but I didn't have one with just water to compare it to!

We thought this was excellent!  we have a son with dairy and egg allergies so finding a recipe without egg is always a treat.  I did add a tsp of vanilla and substituted the milk for Rice Milk and butter for non dairy but ther rest I did as listed.  Served it with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream (Rice cream for our son) and everyone enjoyed it!  Thanks for the great recipe, we Will be making it again!

This was a great recipe. Made it for a girls night and it was a huge success. It was great with vanilla ice cream on top. Next time I think I'll try the version with coffee!

I really liked this, but had the same issue that many others did with the hot fudge layer being to thin. I did as others have recommended and only used 1 1/4 cups of water (which I added 1 tsp coffee granules and 1 tsp vanilla too) and it was seriously runny. It is a very good dessert, one that I will make again after some tweaking. This reheats really well in the microwave which is a big plus! Thanks for the recipe:)

It's just OK in my book. Definitely too much liquid at 1 3/4 c. I substituted coffee for the water, which added to the taste, but it's still too soupy for my tastes and the flavor isn't exactly what I was looking for. It would be better with less liquid, but don't think I'll try to make this again.

I had way less cocoa powder than I thought I did when I started this recipe, so I had to make a major modification, which thankfully turned out to be wonderful.  I used the cocoa powder for the flour mixture, but then for the brown sugar layer, I used a box of instant chocolate pudding, and a shy cup of brown sugar.  I then topped with the hot water and baked per the directions...  This turned out great, and I might make it again with my modification, altho I find it equally enjoyable when I follow the recipe as written.

It's low fat and it tastes low fat- be prepared.  I followed others' advice to add vanilla and instant coffee to hot water. Seemed like it had enough flavor, just not the richness I'd like.  I served it with some canned whipped cream and that helped a bit.

Adore this recipe! I always use half white / half brown sugar for the topping, and it turns out awesome! FANTASTIC with ice cream--something you'd pay $6.00 for at a restaurant.

Yum, yum, yum, yum!  I did tweak a bit per other reviewers' suggestions - used 4 tbsp of cocoa powder in the cake part, along with a tsp or so of both vanilla and almond flavoring and cut hot water back to 1-1/2 cups.  This is going in the permanent collection.  Thanks for sharing!

This was nothing like the one my mom made growing up.  I thought it was OK, but my family wouldn't eat it and I ended up throwing part of it away.  I'll keep looking for one like Moms.  Obviously a lot of people liked it, so if you have no expectations of the dish, you may enjoy it.  Thanks for sharing.

Really, really good. I was looking for a change from the recipe I usually use, and this hits the spot. I might use a little less water next time and maybe some vanilla to round it out a little more, but it's pretty wonderful as is, especially with a scoop of ice cream.

This was great-tasting and so easy to put together.  I served it warm out of the oven with sweetened whipped cream and fresh raspberries.  I might cut the water amount back to  1 1/3 cups as recommended by some of the other reviewers.  The pudding was a little runny.

I don't know what I did wrong but I followed the directions exactly and it came out horrible.  The pudding never thickened - it was extremely watery.  That made the cake very soggy.  And the cake did not even taste very good.  I found it to be very bland and fake tasting.  So we did not even bother picking at it and eating off the top.Thankfully, my guests had cancelled on me so there was no one there to view my flop but my husband.  But the recipe has gotten such great reviews so I might try it again - but not when we are expecting company!

The water spilled over the top of the tray I baked it in, and it came out dry and lumpy, with a thick black wetness all over it, which was extremely sickly. It definitely does not come out the same as in the picture and was barely edible. I would not recommend this to anyone.

I don't usually care for chocolate, but this is really good. I calculated the servings down to 2 servings and made it exactly as the directions. I hope it comes out just as good with the full 12 servings. I will be taking it to a potluck.

My mom used to make this out of the Betty Crocker cookbook years ago when I was a kid. I love it and have found that replacing the water with strong coffee and Baileys Irish Cream liqueur makes it even better with more depth, although it can be a bit on the sweet side. I also add about a teaspoon of vanilla.

I was going to submit it, but mine is very similar to this.  The only difference is that we use 2 tbsp shortening instead of melted butter and we usually add 1/2 cup nuts (optional) to the mix just before putting it in the pan. I love this cake!

Not nearly enough chocolaty flavor.  And the consistency wasn't right either... not cake like at the edges, not pudding in the middle... an overall rubbery texture.  =(

I was happy to stumble upon this egg-free cake-like recipe however; after making and eating it i found that it seems to be missing something (i'm not sure what exactly). I did whip some sweetened cream and added dollops as needed to the servings of pudding cake and i like the dimension that it brought.

This pudding on the cake was good but the cake honestly tasted fat free. Will not make again. Deff. needed rich ice cream with this to hide the taste of the cake.

This was excellent; the only change I made was adding 2 T. of instant coffee granules to the hot water. This intensified the richness and was well-balanced by being served with huge dollops of freshly whipped cream and sugared strawberries.

I dont like when people judge a recipe, but make a million changes.  but, i did it.  i went with the reviews I read, and decreased the water to 1 1/3 cup, and added vanilla.  I didnt have any instant coffee, so I used a packet of Hot Chocoate in.  Awesome!  It was nice and chewey on top, and a great hot fudge underneath.  So Yummy when you dont have alot of ingredients on hand.  I had one serving, and I think my husband has about 5!  He is a chocolate snob, but apparently he loved it.  Will definitely make again.  So nice on a cold night when You NEED to have some chocolate.  Try it!!

Wow.  Total disappointment.  If you like the taste of unsweetened chocolate, then this will do the trick.  The cake lacks depth, richness and any body whatsoever.  I will not make this ever again.

This is really good!  My teenage son requests it every year for his birthday cake.  I double it and put it into a 9 X 13 cake pan.  It doesn't make a very pretty presentation, but add a scoop of ice cream and you're near heaven! For extra chocolate flavor,we use Hershey's dark chocolate cocoa and I cut back on the water just a bit.

Didn't work for me.  I mean, the texture and recipe came out, but the flavor was one-dimensional and too sharp.  I think this recipe needs milk instead of water.

mmm! this was sooo easy to make and came out perfect! i followed suggestions and added 1 tsp. of vanilla and reduced the amount of water...but i reduced the water too much (to one cup) and the pudding came out a bit thick, so next time I will probably use 1 1/3 cups. served with vanilla ice cream and it was really really good!

I love this recipe except that I use less brown sugar to avoid that molasses taste in the pudding.  I remember being disappointed by that when my mom would serve it when I was a kid.  This last time I substituted 1/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 white for the brown sugar.

This is a very good recipe, it has a nice "old fashioned" quality to it and it is v-e-r-y chocolately@ (How could it not taste chocolatey with a whopping 6 Tbsp. of cocoa powder!) Anyone who has left a review less than 4 stars has either A) Expected something with a more "commercial" taste or B) Done something wrong. I dusted the top with powdered sugar to "dress it up" a bit. I would have no problem serving this to guests, it looks pretty served in a small white bowl/ramekin with the sauce spooned over the top.  Definitely a GREAT recipe.  Thanks!

Delish and really easy! The cake is really dense and chocolate-y and the sauce is nice and smooth. I was a little disapointed with the flavor of the sauce, but it was still really yummy. I will definately make this again!

I completely didn't follow directions and it still turned out pretty tasty.  First I just mixed everything in the pan I was going to cook it in and didn't read the part that said to put the brown sugar with the water, I added the sugar right to the cake.  I added some instant coffee to my water and used a bit less water.  Can't mess this one up!

I picked out this recipe when I wanted to make something chocolately for my family and we only had cocoa powder on hand. This is delicious!  I followed this recipe exactly, except I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa to the batter.  This tastes great with a dollop of vanilla ice cream.  I double the recipe when we have company.  This is far and away our new favorite dessert!

Very nice recipe! I added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 cup of copped nuts, and 1/2 cup of shredded dried coconut to the cake batter. It was like an almond joy candy bar type taste.Served it with vanilla ice cream and drizzled the chocolate sauce over the ice cream, really looked lovely. Next time I will reduce the liquid to 1 1/3c and likely make a cup of that liquid coffee.

My family liked this but I felt it needed more cocoa in the cake part of the recipe, double or more. We liked it though, good recipe! I served it with sweetened whipped cream with a chocolate liquer in it...mmmm...

Very sweet very rich!! Tastes great and it has a unique texture... The cake part isn't as sweet as the pudding part but still good. Can afford to use less sugar.

We also have this recipe, I got this from my grandmothers depression era favorites.  (She does have a note in the margins to add 1-2 Tbsp of instant coffee crystals to boost the flavor for when she only had half the sugar ration left that the recipe called for.)  Definitely more of a cake with hot chocolate sauce on the bottom than the texture of a traditional English pudding cake.

Very good recipe. I was looking for a 'different' chocolate cake and this is a nice twist. I used less sugar and still came out too sweet for my taste, but other than that it was delicious.

Simple to make, and delicious!  Especially good when warm with whipped cream on top.  Great dessert for a beginner cook to prepare.

I replaced the water with coffee (I just heated up the cold stuff in the pot from that morning). I also added 1 tsp vanilla to the coffee. IF you make these adjustments, the chocolate flavor really comes through. Also, bake it at 325 degrees for about 40 minutes.

Just pulled this out of the oven and it looks super yummy.  I did a little tweaking: 1/2 c white sugar instead of 3/4 c, made buttermilk instead of plain milk (per my favorite Hershey's chocolate cake recipe), and used just over 1 1/4 c strong Kona Mac Nut coffee in place of water.  That being said, what I will do next time is use less brown sugar as the 'pudding' is almost too sweet (for me) and probably more cocoa powder in both batter and pudding.  I baked it at 325 and set the timer for 40 minutes, BUT ended up pulling it out with about 12 minutes left on the timer.

Funny thing is I made another recipe on this site but I made several modifications and it was pretty much this recipe!  I've been looking for this for several years as I lost my original recipe.  I did use 1/2 Cup of white sugar since I didn't want it to be too sweet and I used 4 T of butter.  For ease of making I melted the butter in the 8x8 pan in the oven and I stirred the dry ingredients to the cake mix in a bowl and then poured it on top of the butter added the milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla and mixed.  I added chopped pecans on top of the batter, about 1/2 cup.  Then used the same bowl to mix the brown sugar and cocoa powder.  Sprinkled on top of pecans and poured the boiling water over the top.  I added 1 Tablespoon of instant coffee to my water and didn't care for the coffee I used.  I will try again with instant espresso.  Turned out great!  Just like I remember with lots of chocolate sauce to ladle over the ice cream!

This is definitely a VERY messy cake but it is very good with ice cream. It is chocolaty but it isn't rich like hot fudge as many would expect (still doesn't mean it's not good). It is like the Betty Crocker Warm Delights. Don't expect it to behave like a regular cake... this one is for those who don't mind getting messy.

This is a great recipe! And despite the sugar, this recipe is relatively healthy. Beware! Do not use a round glass pan. I even used a 9.5 inch pan and it spilled over. But the Pudding Cake was still delicious!

This smelled great while baking but unfortunately 45 minutes was too long. I pulled it out and it was burned beyond edible. I double checked my oven temp and that wasn't even a problem. I would suggest checking at 30 minutes. 3 stars for a good scent.

I cut sugar in half as I do with all other recipes here, but all the rest I did as instructed. Nobody actually commented on how you get 12 servings out of this, and which trick to use to cover 9 inch pan with the mixture. Neither happened in my case. I baked it for 40 minutes and there was no pudding part at all (except in that part of the pan that the dough mixture could not cover :))). Looked scary, tasted awful. Thanks God the ingredients were really cheap and nobody witnessed it :))). This goes out of my recipe box!

Ok, so a week ago I made the recipe as written, and gave it 1 star. Watery and dull tasting.
Tonight I just made a ton of changes, and they bumped it up to 4 stars. Still not spectacular, but good.
1. 1/2 teaspoon salt
2. 4 tablespoons cocoa in batter
3. 1 teaspoon vanilla
4. 1/4 cup melted butter
5. 1/2 cup cocoa in topping
6. 1 1/3 cups hot milk instead of hot water over top. I just heated the milk in the microwave on high power for 2 minutes.
If I make it again I think I will add 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the batter.

Absolutely fabulous! I was snowed in without eggs but wanted something sweet. It was perfect. I only added a little vanilla. It was not too sweet and super easy. I will definitely make it again.

This is delicious and just the thing for when you want a gooey treat. I added more butter to give it more oomph (4tbls) and use more cocoa as well. I also do the coffee instead of water thing, as many others suggest, and just add 1 cup. It is so so yummy, and very forgiving of these little tweaks. I often think of adding prune baby food to give it a rounder chocolate flavor, and you could obviously throw in some nuts or dates or something. I don't know how it works, but it works!

This did NOT come out well at all. I followed the directions exactly and it came out watery and tasted like pure molasses. I had to throw away the whole batch, even my chocoholic kids wouldn't eat it.

My Aunt use to make these when I was a kid.  It was my favorite and I was so excited to find this recipe.  I followed the directions completely the first time and the puddling was a tad runny and just didn't quite taste right.  It just seemed like it was sort of pasty.  The second time I added 1/4 tsp more salt to 1 2/3 cup of water.  It was delicious.

Took Ani's advice and microwaved for 12 minutes.  Great for a quick warm chocolate fix, but it looked like a train wreck - good enough for the family but not company.  Added vanilla to the cake mix; used equal parts water and coffee to total 1 1/3 cup and I thought the pudding was a little too thick  -could be due to over-nuking though.

Cooked it by the book except for cup H2O instead of 1.75.
I thought it was incredible but dad thought it was missing coffee.
I will add vanilla next time, I regret forgetting to add it this time.
We (4) finished it w/in 30 min... so maybe a double batch next time.
A+ I will make this again.

Not bad, but seems to be missing 'something'.  Sauce is just ok.  Needs to be more 'chocolately' maybe with semi-sweet chips?

The texture was perfect and it smelled great but the flavor was really bland.  Like others, I reduced the water to 1 1/3 cups and added vanilla and instant espresso to it.  I actually think that a bit of salt in the brown sugar/cocoa mixture would make a huge improvement and bring out the flavor of it a bit.  I'm going to try it again with some salt becuase I feel like this recipe has so much potential but it is just missing something.

This was just okay. I love the idea of the pudding forming under the cake layer..it's like magic, but this recipe felt like something was missing. I did add the vanilla like other reviewers suggested but somehow it didn't do it for me. Maybe more fat would help haha! Had this cake with a big blob of cool-whip on top which was a minor improvement but I don't think I'll make this one again.

I was not super impressed with this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except using 1 cup water/coffee instead of what recipe suggested.  It was still plenty soupy at bottom.  I think the cooking temperature is off.  I cooked for 45 minutes at 350* and the top was burnt.  Still, my guest had no problem eating it.

I wanted a chocolate (made from scratch) cake that was easy to make, this one fit the bill wonderfully and I thought it was delicious! Made it for the family and they loved it too, I served it by the spoonfull in a small glass cup with vanilla ice cream.

This was just okay.  I added more cocoa to the cake part than called for, and it was still bland to my taste; meanwhile, the pudding part (the cocoa/brown sugar/hot water) was WAY too sweet.  You could probably do with half the brown sugar amount and/or a pinch of salt to cut the sweetness.  I won't be making this again.

This was in between bad and ok, i would never serve this to anyone.  It needs something i even added vanilla, To me it was a waste of ingrediants, then it overflowed like a volcano in my oven so now my house smells burnt.  Very easy to make so i gave it 2 stars but not worth the effort, sorry.

I followed the advice of others on the amount of water to add (1- 1/3 Cup), and forgot to add the vanilla. I'm going to try this again, as it's EXTREMELY EASY to make, but will have to add the vanilla. It was lacking something. Since this already has a lot of caffeine, I did not add the coffee instead of water. I think I will try it, and make 2 batches. One for the kids, and one for us.
Either way, my kids scarfed this down in one sitting.
Enjoy!

Easy and delicious recipe. I served it with vanilla ice cream and it received rave reviews at a dinner party. The top set like cake and the bottom was a gooey, fudgy sauce. I made a couple of changes to make it SUPER FUDGY: I used Hershey's Special Dark unsweetened cocoa for both cocoa measurements and increased the 2 Tbsp. to 3 Tbsp, added 1/2 C. semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 tsp. vanilla, and used only 1 cup of liquid: strong, freshly brewed coffee. With all the dark chocolate and coffee in here I will probably be awake for days but I don't care; I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made this recipe when some college going cousins turned up unexpectedly for Sunday lunch. I modified it a bit. I reduced the quantity of water to 1 1/3 cups and I added about 2 heaped tsp of instant coffee pd (Nescafe)to the hot water. The taste was great. My cousins loved it and cleaned up the bowl with relish. I thought the cake part was a little too chocolaty in taste.. but that is appreciated by a lot of people.

This had absolutely NO taste of chocolate.  All I could taste was sugar.  
So disappointing since the recipe was so easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand.  If you are going to take a stab and make this recipe, I would highly suggest reducing the amount of water as my pudding never set up.  It was very runny.  Not a big deal to me if the taste was good, but it wasn't.

The texture was good (I reduced the water to 1 1/3 cups like other reviewers) but the taste was horrible. Not only was it bland and not very chocolatey, there was a strange burnt taste but the cake was not even burnt! I would not make this again.

My sister and I were at home with nothing sweet in the fridge, and with final exams in a couple of days.  So, I decided to whip up this recipe with the few things we had in the kitchen.  WOW.  One of the best things I've ever made.  And with such few, on hand ingredients.  It was like majic how you toss everything in a pan, and you get this great cake with sauce (used one mug full of water instead of 1 and 3/4 cups).  And the bonus was that all the cocoa powder and sugar in the cake helped us stay up late and study! THANKS!

I don't know how to rate this recipe because I think I ruined it using coffee instead of the water.  It seemed to make the dessert very bitter like eating unsweetened chocolate.  Maybe my coffee was too strong.  I made it the way I would drink it which is a little on the strong side.  I am going to try this one more time, but with hot water instead of the coffee.  Be careful of the coffee it was very strong and changed the taste of  the recipe.  It looked like it may be a good dessert that's why I am going to try it one more time.

Yummmmm. I used only 1 1/3 cups of water, and this resulted in quite a thick, rich sauce. I wouldn't use less water than that.
I added about 1/2 teaspoon vanilla bean paste, I'd definitely reccomend it.
Very moreish, I think I could have eaten the whole thing!

Definitely a different twist on chocolate cake. I made the mistake of using sweetened cocoa in place of the unsweetened cocoa, and it turned out extremely sweet. The liquid around the bottom of the cake was also a little too runny for my taste, so maybe I'll try using less water if I make it again. Overall, however, it had a good taste and interesting moist texture that satisfied my chocolate craving.

Just like Mom used to make! Perfect comfort food, and quick enough to prepare  for those hard-hitting chocolate cravings. I often scale the recipe down to three servings and bake it for 30 minutes in an individual-sized 21oz corningware dish.

This is an awesome cake that's SO easy to throw together. The ingredients are all things that are usually on hand and it's always a hit. I do agree with other reviewers, though: this cake is much better when you use nice, strong coffee instead of water.

This was very good, and easy to make too.  My 10 yr. old daughter was able to make it with little assistance.  I dont have a square pan, so we used an 8x11 rectangular pan, and it turned out great.  Thanks!

Seemed to be lacking something in flavor. Maybe a splash of vanilla would have finished off the flavor.  The overall texture was good.
