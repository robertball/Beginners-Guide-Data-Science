I only gave this a 4 because although it was very easy, it wasn't as thick as I like. So, to make it better and a little easier, I used 4 cans of diced potatoes and then made a roux with 1/2 cup butter and 6 T. flour cooked together, then added it to the soup. It made it as thick as I like it and delicious!!!!

This a great recipe! It turned out great the first time (I've never been successful making soup from scratch before). You can also add 1 cup of heavy cream and 1/2 stick of butter to enhance the taste and texture. Additionally, use a smallish onion instead of a large one so onion flavor doesn't overpower the potato.

We really enjoyed this soup. I had leftover ham steaks and used that instead of deli ham. I also used homemade gravy mix (Sweettreats' recipe) but otherwise followed the recipe. I served this with homemade French bread for a delicious comfort food meal.

This really came close to my favorite potato soup at one of the local restaurants.  I added real garlic, 1 tbls of sour cream, Emeril's Essence ( 4 BAMS) and a cup of shredded sharp cheddar.  I think i just need a little dill to make it "spot on".  Thanks for the start to the best potato soup ever!

Very good. Used 4 cans of sliced potatoes as suggested by another user. Also added 1 stick of butter melted and stirred with 6 T. of flour as suggested by another user to beef up the soupiness of it. It was easy and I liked it. My kids did not like the ham, but I did.

This is a perfect soup recipe for those of us who can't have wheat or dairy.  I used some smoked paprika in place of the ham and it smells delicious!  Will be eating it in about an hour!

A good and very easy dish.  I didn't have a carrot, so I ended up added more potato.  I didn't have chicken broth so I used 2 bullion cubes with 6 cups of water, and it worked out just fine.  Will make again if I have the ingredients at hand, which should be often since it's a no fuss dish.

Used leftover spiral cut ham from Christmas, otherwise made this as directed.  Turned out great.  If you like the soup a little thicker, just add an extra potato and cook longer.  The potatoes mush down and thicken the sauce. Great flavor.
