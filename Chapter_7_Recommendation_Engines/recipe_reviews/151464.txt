I love the fix ahead idea! I cooked my extra turkey yesterday and used this for dressing, made a day ahead. (didn't stuff the bird for the first time ever)  I fiddled with amounts, personal preference.  Eliminated the salt, reduced butter by half, cut poultry seasoning by half and upped sage to 2 t. I used 20 slices of  oven dried whole wheat bread and only 1 1/2 c of the broth. I usually find casserole baked dressing dry and in need of a dousing with turkey drippings but this was not at all dry. I won't ever buy a bag of stuffing crumbs again.

Wow! I really impressed my in-laws with this recipe and all I did was follow the directions. I made this 2 separate times. One with homemade breadcrumbs and the other with store bought. The best outcome was when I took 2 loaves of bread, cubed them and dried them in the oven to make homemade breadcrumbs ( serving 16). I found that they soak up the liquid a lot more then the really dried store bought bread crumbs, allowing them to retained a lot more flavour. I did make this recipe 2 days before each dinner.  It was the first dish to disappear. There were no left overs! This recipe made me look like a chef, when in reality I rarely have time to cook. Thank you!

I cubed 10 pieces of white bread and 10 pieces of rye bread instead of the bread crumbs.  Didn't even dry them and it turned out WONDERFUL!  I also added some fresh mushrooms and carrots which gave it some color.  I made it the day before, stuck it in the refrigerator, and it was so easy to just cook it the next day.  You should bake it in a 9 x 13 dish.

I made this recipe as written, with no changes or substitutions.  It was great as a make-ahead dressing.  Since my holiday meals are a pretty big production, I made this dressing 3 days in advance, which was wonderful.  However, this is not the best dressing I've made.  It's good, but I give it 5 stars because of the ability to make so far in advance - otherwise, it would be a 4.

This dressing is dry.  I had to add almost two cans of chicken broth.

Good-bye fancy stuffing and hello Do-ahead Stuffing!  After years of making fancy stuffing for Thanksgiving, my son begged me to make box stuffing which I couldn't bring my self to do.  So on the hunt I went for a stuffing that called for basic ingredients and this one fit the bill.  The fact that you can make it ahead was a bonus.  For the bread crumbs, I cubed a loaf of white and a loaf of wheat - placed on a cookie sheet and put in the oven at 250 degrees until the cubes felt stiff.  I added just enough onion and celery to my liking and without measuring the broth, added just enough until all the bread was moist.  Added all the butter and seasonings as called for in the recipe.  Next time I will cut down on the salt and store in a casserole dish instead of a bag.

I liked the seasonings in this recipe, except for the amount of salt. I would make this again, and add less salt. Taste the stuffing, before adding salt. Then, starting with a 1/2 teaspoon of salt add until you get the flavor you like.  I think the saltiness is due to the chicken stock having so much sodium. Per other reviews, you may need to add more chicken stock, especially if you use dried bread cubes.

This was really salty but I'm still giving it 5 stars because I'm not sure if it's because of the way that I do my chicken broth which is with the granules.... Even with it being too salty it was really good and I made it exactly as written!

This recipe is very similar to the sausage stuffing recipe in Betty Crocker.  Salt is deleted in that recipe, so I didn't use it.  I also used 2 tsp. poultry seasoning instead of the seasonings in this recipe.  I doubled the recipe since our extended family loves stuffing!  Wouldn't be Thanksgiving without stuffing & gravy!  Big help to be able to make it ahead of time!

Its the perfect recipe for my favorite Old Fashion Stuffing. I used to stuff my turkey but no longer wish to do so.  Q? Do I need to cover casserole dish when baking in oven?

I made this for a potluck today. Doubled the seasonings and halved the salt. Did add mushrooms along with the celery and onion and only baked it for 30 minutes as we are bringing it to the party today and will just warm it up there. I did taste test it when it came out of the oven and glad i doubled the seasonings,  we like a lot of flavour so will probably triple it next time. Great time saver for sure and will use it this recipe again.

I make a similar recipe with an egg, poultry seasoning and no broth. I toast my bread in the toaster over, then break into pieces.  I also use this recipe to make stuffed meatloaf.  It is so good!

This was easy to make ahead, which was what I was looking for.  There were no left overs.  I added a bit more chicken broth than was in the recipe.  Will make again.

I used sourdough bread crumbs. The only thing I added different from the recipe was about 1 cup of chopped fresh mushrooms. I have had a TON of compliments. AND I have made it ahead both times!

Turned out okay.  Covered the whole time cooking, was afraid it would get dry.  Something could of been added to it for a little more zing but overall liked making it the day before.  It made the day a little easier to get everything ready.
