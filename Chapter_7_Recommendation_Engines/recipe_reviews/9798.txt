With some changes, this is our new favorite biscuit.  I added 1/2 cup of milk, becasue it was very dry.  Then, I didn't read the complete directions, and did not knead or refrigerate the dough.  Just cooked it, drop biscuit style.  yummy!

The cookies were dry & crunchy...which is what I was looking for, but they were also pretty bland.  If I try them again, I will add some more cinnamon, or maybe some ginger or nutmeg.

I'm sure someone had an Alzheimer's moment here. It seems to be missing milk and baking powder. If not, you might as well take some cinnamon and flour, and just stick your tongue in  it - this will approximate the same dry, gross texture.

I love these! So easy to make, and can still use a little butter or jelly if you like. I added twice the amount of cinnamon because I love it, other than that the recipe came out perfect!

I made this recipe last night and after looking at the reviews I decided to add 1/2 cup of milk, extra cinnamon, some nutmeg, and ground all spice. I also used self-rise flour (which is the same thing as adding baking soda). I also decided to add a glaze so I took about 1/2 cup of milk and combined it with powder sugar, some cinnamon, and some vanilla extract. I put the glaze on top of the biscuits after they were done baking and put them in the fridge and they came out pretty good that way.

Well I am a beginner, and mine turned out more like snickerdoodle cookies. I guess I should have read more closely that this was an English biscuit, aka a cookie...
