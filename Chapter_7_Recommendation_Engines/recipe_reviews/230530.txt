My family is a big greens fan. I used spicy breakfast sausage instead of bacon for a change. I had a needed a starch so I added a can of beans to it. Yumo! Thank You Kim!

I always thought collard greens had to be cooked until there was no life left in them. Then I had them at Ethiopian restaurants and knew that wasnâ€™t the case. This recipe is great, easy, and delicious. I did add more garlic, and also about 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar at the end to brighten it up.

I used this recipe because it was the first time ever cooking collards in my house. My hubby who is usually picky with greens immediately went "MMMMM" with the first bite. I used a good pepper bacon, an three cloves of garlic. Definitely keeping this!

Delicious, I added a lot more garlic, but we're just garlic fantics in my house :)
