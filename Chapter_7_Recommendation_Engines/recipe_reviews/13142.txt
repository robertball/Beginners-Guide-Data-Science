This is a simple and quick recipe, but rather bland for my taste. It is better with additional salt and pepper.Maybe adding bacon would be a good idea.

I had a can of creamed corn in my pantry.  So I scaled this recipe to half and used only 1 Tblsp flour and 2 cups 2% milk.  I thought that the addition of the creamed corn gave it the perfect chowder creaminess.  Added a bit of chipotle powder and cumin as suggested by a reviewer, and some real bacon bits.  The popcorn was a fun garnish!  I'll make this soup again with my changes.

This was rather bland, but with the addition of 1 teaspoon of cumin, 1/2 teaspoon chipotle pepper and four strips of bacon, the flavor was made more southwestern and considerably more flavorful.

I added mushroom soup to this recipe, I didn't like the original recipes sweetness, so I added about 3 cans of mushroom soup in a can, then I gave it some spice with garlic powder and other seasonings.  This is a good recipe, though I have modified it each time I made it.
