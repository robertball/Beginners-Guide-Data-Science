I thought these were very tasty. I found a recipe for tandoori powder online so I used that in this recipe. It wasn't very spicy so next time I make these, I will add more. I served this on naan bread and used some mango chutney on top

I rated it a 3 because I couldn't find the main ingredients. Where would I find the tandoori paste?
