This sounds like an excellent gluten-free breakfast recipe. I'm always looking for good GF recipes and will try this out before house guests come next week. Do you think this could be made day before and refrigerated until baked? Thanks!

This was great! Made with fresh mozzarella.  Had to cook a bit longer (at least another 10 minutes), but it was delicious.  Serves more like 6-8 people (not 12).  Would definitely make again!

Absolutely delicious!  I made this for breakfast the day after Thanksgiving for a house full of guests and it got great reviews.  I went easy on the peppers because I don't care for them much and used a mixture of eggs and egg substitute as I made 1.5 times the recipe and wanted to lighten it up a bit. It took a little longer to cook for me than the recipe called for but that wasn't a problem.  We ate some leftovers on Saturday and it reheated well.  Another nice aspect was that I cooked up the sausage, pepper, and onions the night before so I could just put it together in the morning and catch a few extra minutes of sleep.  Definite keeper!

Wonderful gluten free breakfast, that even my non gluten free family loves. I take this camping with the sausage, pepper and onion cooked ahead, so all I have to do is put it all together.

Nice for dinner too! I always add garlic flakes and salt,  substitute cauliflower for the potatoes, and use buckwheat flour + baking powder instead of bisquick-- healthier without aluminum, less expensive, and still gluten-free. My family loves it! I make it a couple of times a month. Will try adding dill.

I love this casserole for the simplicity but only gave it 4 stars because I feel it needs a bit more in the way of seasoning.  I added garlic when saluting the veg as well as folding in more spices to the egg mixture but still felt it could have used more.  Still a keeper though and I’ll keep experimenting with different amounts of the spices each time I make it. Some time savers:  frozen chopped onions, pre-cooked turkey sausage crumbles, and hash browns from the refrigerated section instead of frozen.

Made this today and it turned out really good and it was super easy.  Took off one star because I thought it was a little bland, next time I will try using spicy sausage instead of the plain pork sausage.

Absolutely delicious! I made the recipe as directed EXCEPT I used 1/2 egg substitute to reduce calories. I also used turkey sausage. It was just wonderful. Next time I think I'll add a little hot pepper sauce to the egg mix.

Tasty, moist, and simple. I  used Eckrich four pepper smoked sausage and some jalapenos for extra heat instead of the bulk sausage.

We really liked this recipe and have made it a couple of times. We find it to be more moist than breakfast casseroles that use bread or croutons. We like the hash brown base. We’ve added crumbled bacon and ham as well. Gluten free was great for our friend and we made with regular bisquick for just us. We will come back to this one.

MODS: I used all of a 30-oz. bag of hash browns, because I didn't want any leftovers, LOL. Based on what I had on hand, I used a mix of red and yellow bell pepper, shredded Cheddar/Jack cheese, a mix of yellow onion and green onion, a mix of soy milk and half-and-half. and Cup4Cup (which I adore) instead of Bisquick. (The pantry is REALLY bare, as you can tell!)

I squeezed the moisture out of the potatoes before placing them in the 9x13 pan. I layered the sausage, veggies, and cheese, then poured the egg mixture over and topped with the remaining cheese. The casserole was perfectly done after just 25 minutes; it came out light, fluffy, and flavorful. I think this was far and away the best breakfast casserole at our church potluck!

Very good, tasty!!  I doubled  the recipe for 10 people, still used glass 9X13, but had to cook it quite a bit longer to set the eggs. Great Christmas morning dish—

This is a great go-to for large group breakfast! I was a tad disappointed with the consistently (I fret it's because of the frozen hash browns; will try again with fresh and batted dry potatoes) I was expecting a quiche texture but it's quite a bit more soggy than that. Overall it was well liked and raved by my gluten-free friends :)

I used bacon in place of the sausage. I also added 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, and chives. It was still a little bland. Next time I will play around with the spices a bit. I think this is a great recipe and I look forward to experimenting with it again.

This is a terrific weekend brunch recipe for me. That's when  I usually use up whatever produce I want to get rid of- usually bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms. Last Saturday it was multicolored sweet peppers.  a serrano pepper,  a sweet onion and mushrooms. Into the skillet they all went. Diced zucchini or yellow squash would  be good, too. This recipe lends itself well to substitution in sausage  and cheese varieties , too. 
It was a big hit with my gluten-free husband and the rest of the family as well.

I use this recipe all the time rather we have gluten free guests or not. I agree with one of the other reviewers.... I do not get 12 servings from it. Keeps well and can be reheated.

Delici  ous for breakfast when you re tired aft holiday
days.    next time I will also use green peppers and a few mushrooms..  Slices easily and is very pretty to present....needs a bit more salt and pepper.
