These were very simple to make even with making my own biscuit dough. I found uncooked Johnsonville sausage patties in my store so I just cooked them up prior to assembling.  They were the perfect size for the muffin tins. The biscuit recipe I used was the Basic Biscuit recipe on this site.  I rolled the dough a little thinner and cut with a 4 oz. juice glass which fit the muffin tin perfectly.  If you choose to cook your own sausage from bulk the 4 oz. juice glass will work good for cutting them to size as well. I loved being able to just layer these in the muffin tins and bake. Tasty little gems!

Been making these for a very long time . Wouldn't consider this a (recipe) to be honest. Everything is already made you just assemble. This is more of a assembly lol

Easy peasy! A good breakfast to make a bunch of and freeze for my kids. Great with homemade biscuits too, which I generally do so I can a gluten free version.

These are way too easy! I doubled up on the cheese because the one little square of cheese looked so lonely! I served them with taco sauce from our local beach cafe just to help send them over the edge. I also took the suggestion of using my vacant muffin tins to cook some eggs in at the same time as the biscuits. The eggs were too big to serve on the sandwich so we had them on the side. These were so easy and delicious, I definitely see us making them often!

These are so simple to make, and really good. A couple of things to note . . . the Johnsonville® original recipe breakfast sausage that I found in the shape of patties in my store were NOT fully cooked (and it was a 12oz. package), so I cooked these as directed on the package prior to assembling with the biscuits. The Pillsbury Grands® biscuits I used were a 16.3oz container, not 12oz as the recipe states (I couldn't find any variety of Grands® in my grocery store that was 12oz). Both of these alternate sizes worked fine with the recipe. I am going to freeze some of these to have on-hand for kids' breakfasts on school  days.

These were so quick, easy, and delicious! Talk about a true one pan meal! I plan on making another batch for quick grab and go breakfast during the week! Hint: if you want to add eggs to your sandwich- crack an egg into the well greased unused cups in your muffing tin and the egg bakes up perfectly with the sausage biscuits!

Ridiculously easy. I cannot believe that I've had these items sitting in my freezer and never put them together.. awesome for those busy school mornings . Make extra...  you could freeze them. Or pop them in the refrigerator, when in a hurry throw in microwave. My 10yr old son loved them, had two when fresh.  Thanks for sharing

These were really good and so easy to put together.  Will try again with different sausages.  They reheat in the microwave really well an very quickly.  Going to try freezing a big batch.

I  rated this partly based on the guy who gave it one star because he'd been making it for years. Guess he was jealous. Anyway, it was just what I was looking for - simple and great to heat up  on a cold morning too. Thanks!!

My son and I thought they were very good, wife wife and daughter would probably give it 2 stars. We tried a couple different thing to dip them in, maple syrup was probably best, hot sauce 2nd (for me). I might try doubling the cheese next time. The little bit called for kind of gets overwhelmed. Also, I used Colby Jack instead of American. Not a fan of American cheese.

A quick and easy way to make breakfast for a crowd in no time at all! We absolutely adored these. We even froze some for a grab and go breakfast during the week. Next time I will use a jumbo muffin tin and try it with the frozen grands biscuits thawed and cut in half. I while these bake it is easy to pair this with scrambled eggs or hash browns.

These were very simple to make and good for a crowd.   I am not a fan of canned biscuits, so, next time I would probably attempt to make with homemade biscuit dough.  I couldn't find Johnsonville precooked sausage, so, I bought fresh and cooked before adding them to the muffin tins.

Quick and satisfying recipe. Easy to freeze and reheat for breakfast. My parents loved these. Gotta love a flaky biscuit and some flavorful, pork sausage.

This recipe is a perfect example of a "why didn't I think of that". Quick and easy yet satisfying flavor.  Into my TNT folder they go!

Sausage and cheese on a biscuit? Really friends, how can you beat this? The recipe was a cinch to make, the sliders freeze and reheat well, and breakfast on the go is a piece of cake. The only drawback I ran into was that it was a smidge overly-salty.
