Great recipe we will be making this again. My husband couldn't get enough. I followed the recipe all the way but finished the shrimp on saut√© pan with little bit of olive oil to make it crispy and golden brown. Five stars!

Very good forgot to get 'panko' so just used regular bread crumbs and had to use a lot more of it and the coconut than recipe called for. Dipping sauce is great!
