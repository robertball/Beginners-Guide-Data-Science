This recipe renders a fork-tender, juicy and flavorful brisket.  As others have suggested, I substituted a cup of beer for the water.  
One (perhaps obvious) note; before slicing the brisket, let it rest for 10-15 minutes to allow the juices to re-distribute.

I messed this recipe up and it still came out wonderful!  The only brisket I could find was a tiny little 2 pounder, and I misread the directions and cooked it an hour a lb and then sliced it, put on sauce, and cooked it another hour.  But even with the additional cooking time it came out unbelievably tender and full of flavor.  I did put some liquid smoke on the meat along with garlic salt and pepper.  It was great, and we will definately make again.

I eyed the seasonings, so I added a bit more than the reciepe called for.  It turned out great.  We never made a brisket before, but now we will be making it a lot.  I did not add the water, I mixed the sauce with the brisket drippings and added that to the meat.  I was flavorfull and tender.  YUM!

The celebration was my father-in-law's 90th birthday party!  Used this recipe as our starting point. Talked with the butcher and he convinced me to buy an untrimmed brisket.  He said cooking it with the fat added a great deal of flavor. So for 20 guests I bought a 13 pound untrimmed brisket.  Based on this recipe and recommendations. we cooked ours in the oven 7 hours at 275 degrees.  This was the perfect amount of time. Took it out and trimmed all the fat off, and then sliced as thin as we could.  While cooking, used some rub on the meat as suggested and nearly a can of beer.  We cooked it the day before.  Also made Big Al's BBQ Sauce on this site.  After cooking and slicing, soaked it all night long in the sauce and then warmed slowly on 275 degrees before the party.  It was fabulous!  Everyone raved.  Served on nice rolls with some good deli cheddar cheese.  Yummy.

I used this recipe for the brisket we served at our Kentucky Derby party.  It was so easy to make.  Everyone enjoyed the taste and asked for the recipe.  I did not slice it until after we pulled it out of the oven.

Incredible!!!  This recipe was so simple and delicious.  The meat was really tender and flavorful.  If you'd like to add some "kick" to your meat, sprinkle some red cayenne pepper on the meat and add a little Franks Red Hot sauce in with the barbecue and water mixture.  Yummie!!  Also great cold.

I have a knack for turning roasted meats into shoe leather. NOT THIS TIME!! Used a small skirt streak (1 1/4lb), my favorite BBQ rub, baked 1 hr, added BBQ sauce thinned with beer, baked another hour. Put reduced BBQ sauce over sliced meat - Excellent! (Used web site tool to adjust ingredients to fit meat portion)

This was the most simple recipe I could find and my brisket turned out delicious!  I cooked it at 250 because I was going to be gone for several hours and it turned out wonderful.  Thank you for an easy, delicious recipe!

Super simple and delicious. Reviewers who say it's too fatty should be aware that with Brisket, most recipes tell you to remove as much of the thick fat layer as you can before cooking. This recipe unfortunately doesn't tell you that, but it's almost always a good idea. The only other changes I made to this recipe were 1) I put a thin layer of barbecue sauce on the meat for the first round of cooking, then more in the second (after slicing), and 2) I split the cooking time approximately in half, rather than just leaving an hour of cooking after slicing the meat .

Incidentally, reviewers who say their meat turned out (or usually turns out) like shoe leather should be careful about which cuts of meat they use for slow cooking like this. You need a fatty, gristly cut like brisket because the collagen (in the gristle) breaks down slowly and tenderizes the meat. Leaner, finer cuts like steaks don't have much gristle and are much better for grilling, searing, frying, etc.

This recipe was very easy and delicious!  I added chopped celery and sliced onions to the brisket before cooking.  However, slicing it before cooking it the last hour made it a little dry.  Overall, though, it was great!

I was a little dubious about this one, especially when the recipe said not to use any water.  I shouldn't have worried - it was great, tender and flavorful.  I reduced the cooking time slightly as I used two small pieces of brisket instead of one big one.  Served it with scalloped potatoes and green beans. My family loved it.  Will make it again.

My husband has never cooked a brisket before.  We had one in the freezer, and let it thaw out.  He added all the dry ingredients and later cut it up and added bbq sauce..(sweet baby rays).  Man, this was so good!  It was tender and juicy, flavorful!  Yummy!  One thing that we will do different next time is add more seasoning.. maybe even garlic salt, liquid smoke... Don't get me wrong this was really good!   We had to use tin foil.. If you do, make sure you use heavy foil and to maybe even double it around the brisket.  This is the key to moist and juicy brisket!

I did make two adjustments after reading reviews and my own personal experience with red meat. I did not salt before cooking, that usually draws out the moisture. Secondly, I used one cup beer instead of water. Was very good for my first brisket! Was a bit dry but very tender. Will try not slicing it next time around until right before serving to see if that helps! Usually best to wait 5-10 minutes after taking from oven to slice for max. juiciness. Family loved it, no left overs!

I made brisket for the very first time a few weeks ago using this recipe with own barbeque sauce.  It was fantastic!  So simple and yet so flavorful!  I just bought another brisket so I can make it again.  Made pulled beef sandwiches with some of the leftovers for my husband's lunch the next day.  He was in heaven!  Thanks for sharing this one..it's a winner!!

I was hesitant about cooking another brisket, because the first one I made a couple of months ago came out like beef jerkey!  This brisket came out amazing!  My boys absolutely loved it!   I was hesitant because of the little water that was used, but it was falling-apart fork-tender, and the smell was like the best BBQ restaurant you've ever been to.  I served it with macaroni and cheese muffins (found on allrecipes.com, as well, with a few additions) and garlic-butter corn on the cob.  Will for sure be making this again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was the first time I had ever cooked a brisket.  I was amazed at the ease of preparation and cooking.  My family and I really enjoyed the cooked brisket.  It tasted great and we all loved it.  I took my parent some of this great brisket and even they loved it.  I am quite impressed with this recipe.  A+ all they way

I like to find really good recipes that are still simple. This is it!  I used a Packer's Cut brisket,  which has the fat on untrimmed.  In the pan fat side up,  I drained the fat at slice and sauce time, and it was sooo tender, it fell apart as much as sliced with a Very sharp knife.  The only thing I might change,  is, not to add the sauce and water.  The meat can be used for more things(If there are any leftovers)

Decent flavor. I mixed my BBQ sauce with beef stock. The beef itself came out super dry. Would not make it this way again.

I had never made a Brisket before, this recipe seemded easy and it was.  Not only that, both times I have made it, for large groups, there was none left.  Everyone raved about and could not believe how easy it was to make.  For a busy mom that is important.

Very tasty! I cooked in the crockpot instead of the oven - about 6 hours on low for a 2 lb. brisket. This was excellent and will definitely be added into our rotation.

Terrific tasting brisket and very tender.  After slicing, I tasted the brisket and it was delicious.  I kept a few slices out for my daughter who doesn't like BBQ and unfortunatly put the BBQ on the rest.  My problem was that I bought a new kind of BBQ sauce (Jack Daniels)and it was terrible.  Will be making again with my standard BBQ sauce.

This is my first brisket and I can say that this is awesome! I used the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce from this site and instead of adding water, I used the beef juice itself and mix it with the BBQ sauce.

I did this with about 2 lbs brisket and the cooking times didn't seem right, even thought I had adjusted them. So I cooked it for a little longer and everything turned out alright.

I have no idea what happend. I was SO excited about this and it smelt great but mine was very very tough. I cooked it just as written except I didn't have a roasting pan so I used a 13x9 pan and covered it with foil. We were so disappointed.

Tried my brisket this way for the 1st time. (I've always traditionally braised it in the oven with potatoes, vegetables and tomatoes like a stew.) This was very good.  I added hot sauce and worcestershire to the BBQ sauce.  I also sliced up lots of onions and placed them under and over the meat.  The kids thought we were having ribs and then they said it was even better than ribs because there was more meat and no bones!

Quick, easy, and as delicious as any I've had in Texas. Add some Liquid Smoke and be careful not to use a sauce with too high of a sugar content or it'll burn and taste bitter. I also didn't slice the meat before the last hour of cooking and it turned out fine. Thanks for this great recipe!

It may have just been because I have a slight cold but it didn't seem to have as much flavor as I liked. It was tender and easy to cut and chew. A little extra spice would have provided something nice.

I found the sauce to be too watery so it wasn't very flavorful and the beef shredded. I like brisket so it can be cut in thick slices, like Texas barbecue. I won't be making it again. I even cut the water to 1/2 cup and it was still watery.

I pretty much already knew how to make this without the recipe, so I used this to know what temperature and time to cook it. Brisket is one of my most favorite main dishes ever, and I like it with a strong BBQ flavor so I just eyeballed the amount until everything was good and covered, and didn't bother with the water. Turned out great. Thanks!

IT'S TRUE!! IT'S TRUE!!! This is an easy, tender, tasty recipe...I cooked the brisket at 320 for 4 hrs and added Lawry's lo-carb hickory barbque sauce the last hour.
DEEEE LISH US... and oh so tender...

This was great!  I cooked for 2 hours at 300 then after putting b-bque sauce on, I upped the heat to 350 for another hour.  The meat shredded nicely!  I put the meat on hoagies & topped with coleslaw.  It was a great sandwich... a hit with the whole family.

I usually use my own brisket recipe, but I needed something simple & quicker tonight. Followed directions exactly, & ended up with a tough, overdone chunk of beef after only one hour & 48 minutes in the oven (it's a 2.83 lb. brisket). According to the recipe, I should now cook for an additional hour in the BBQ water mixture. Considering the condition it's currently in, I've reduced the temperature to 275, & plan to check it in 30 minutes. I feel like this could've been a success with a lower baking temp, a smaller roasting pan, & some liquid added in the beginning.

Would not make this again. Meat came out tough and chewy. Flavor was good, but that depends on the BBQ sauce used. It was a lot of work on the jaw to eat this.

Very good, tender and flavorful.  I missed the smokey taste you can get with liquid smoke and plan on adding that to the mixture next time.

I made this recipe a few nights ago.  My brisket was fresh from the grocery store, but smaller than the 4lb. cut on the recipe.  I shortened the cooking time to 2 1/2 half hours, adding the sauce & water after about an hour.  The meat was somewhat tender, but borderline dry.  There was entirely too much sauce created - even halving the recipe!  Next time I make it, I will use liquid smoke instead of the bbq sauce & put that on in the beginning.

Absolutely to-die-for recipe. I substituted garlic powder and taco seasoning rubbed in, in generous amounts, along with "TexJoy" brand Old West Mesquite Shake instead of the salt and pepper. After cooking for 1 hour per pound I sliced it rather thick and poured a cup of Jack Daniels Original #7 Recipe Barbeque Sauce mixed well with one cup of water over it and continued cooking for another hour. The juiciest, tenderest and most flavorful brisket I ever ate. Great recipe... thank you.

OK - I was very skeptical on this one but I had a beef brisket in the freezer so I tried it - - it was wonderful and my hubby loved it as well.  I did not salt the brisket since i think brisket is pretty salty to begin with.  I am a working mom - always looking for quick / fast meals.  I made this sunday night when kids went to bed and we had for Monday and Tuesday night dinners.  I served with baked beans.  Thanks!

This was totally delicious, and so easy! Just be careful on the cooking time, because brisket varies in thickness, and since mine was pretty thin, it was done much sooner. I cooked it for almost 3 hours in the oven as per directions (it was almost done at that time), and then sliced it, transferred it to my crockpot on low, poured the sauce and water over it, and left the house for a few hours. By the time we came back, it was almost completely shredded. I spooned it into soft buns, served with coleslaw and raw crunchy carrots and it was to die for! Gone in one dinner and lunch the next day! Fighting over the leftovers!!

This was so easy and resulted in a tender brisket. We use grass fed beef, which can get tough when cooked incorrectly, but this was wonderful. Thanks!

I tried this recipie last Sunday and it turned out great, I did
add some other ingredients in my spice rub and used beer instead of water, but the brisket was like butter baby. I will certainly use again.

Good recipe. I think the cook time is too much. Mine was done cooking before I even got pour the sauce and cut the meat. I am not a fan of BBQ sauce. Therefore I substituted with a steak sauce. Reviews at my house were great, other than the meat being over cooked.

Great recipe!  And smells so good all day.  I inserted garlic cloves all over the brisket (they get nice and mushy and are great to spread on crusty french bread) and covered in sliced onions.  I don't like bbq sauce, so I just added 1 c. water and did not slice until it was at the table.  Delicious.

Delicious!  I was a little concerned that I may have cooked it too long because it was really crispy on the outside, but it came out perfect.  I used the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ sauce recipe from this site (didn't thin with water before pouring over meat), though it was great even without the sauce.  Will definitely make again.

We loved this recipe.  I have two teenagers and both were enthusiastic eaters.  Makes great sandwiches the next day too.  Unbelievably easy to cook.  We will serve this at our superbowl party.

I was too lazy to do the spices so I just rubbed mesquite seasoning into the meat and let it sit about an hour before cooking.  Everything else was the same.  I doubt the seasoning makes that much difference in the overall flavor.  Everyone enjoyed it and it was easy!  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious.  We used a more complex spice rub on the brisket, but the same cooking technique.  Best brisket I've ever tasted.  Delicious and tender.

Great recipe! Who knew that oven baked brisket could be as juicy and tender!

My brisket was done much faster than it said tho.. Just keep an eye on it so as to not dry it out.

Loved it!  Couldn't be easier.  I salted and peppered the brisket liberally before cooking, and could leave it at that, really.  

Also, for a variation...followed the same process, but instead of BBQ sauce added a jar of beef gravy with about 1/2 can of water(Heinze Au Jus Gravy).   Made awesome French Dip sandwiches!   Oh, that was for a half brisket, 2 1/2 lbs, so for a big one you may need two jars of gravy.

This is mostly how I've always made mine. I really liked the early slicing and BBQing of the brisket though. My husband raved over how great it tasted. I'll be making my brisket like this from now on.

Frankly, I was disappointed by this recipe.  I was expecting a savory, melt-in-your-mouth, too-falling-apart-to-cut dish, and ended up with a good-tasting, but rather tough hunk of meat.  I followed recipe directions exactly, with the exception of adding a BBQ rub before cooking.  I'm still looking for a good brisket recipe, as this is NOT it.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. The biggest complain I've run into is that the meat is dry and/or the meat is too tough or chewy. I've made this twice now and the meat comes out perfect. One tip I could add is to make sure the brisket is sealed up tight in the foil. Also, instead of using water, I used the dripping from the brisket and mixed that with the BBQ sauce. It turns out great that way and tastes amazing.

this was by far the best oven brisket I've tried yet,however I incorporated a  couple ingredients instead of water beef stock, as far as dry seasons added brown sugar and tony thactherys Cajun season and olive oil.take brisket and wipe dry cover lightly in olive oil,take dry season mixed together in equal amounts and rub in.put in frig for six hours or better.when it's cooked you will find it fork tender with lots of flavor,enjoy all you great cooks

I had never made a brisket before and I ended up following other reviews and using beer... I wish I hadn't.  I will make it again, but this time I will follow the recipe as written.

I had never made a Brisket before and tried this and it turned out great! A previous review said they used beer instead of water which I did and I was please with the result.  I had to buy a roasting pan so I got one with a rack in it and cooked the meat on the rack for the first several hours and when it came to put the meat back in with the BBQ sauce I took the rack out.  Love the taste. Without a dought a keeper!

Very easy and super tender!  I used a smaller bottle of Mesquite BBQ Sauce.  It was delicious!  Have made this twice in the past couple weeks!

I made this brisket last Sunday, July 13th for dinner.  My husband just loved it and we ate up all the left overs too.  

This was so easy and tasty.  This one will become one of my favorites.  This one is for sure a "KEEPER".

This recipe was okay.  It smelled great while it was cooking, but my brisket came out tough.  I don't know if I did something wrong or if it was just that cut of meat.  It is worth trying again.

Pretty darn good, I used some garlic salt and Fiesta Fajita seasoning instead of salt and pepper and also a little Liquid Smoke, but what really made it was the Jack Stack BBQ sauce.  My stash over sauce is almost gone until I get more from KC, but it was worth it (dreaming of Jack Stack baked beans...)

This was the easiest roast to prepare and used so few ingredients. I served this with bacon ranch pasta salad and deviled eggs. We all enjoyed this indoor barbecue!

This was a great brisket! My boyfriend was dreading this meal because he thought briskets were always dry and overcooked. Nope, it was very moist! We didn't even use knives.

I consider this a time saving receipe - (pop it in the oven, set the timer, and forget it until the timer goes off - in the meantime I can "multi-task").  A nice and easy spring/early summer meal

When I printed out this recipe, I was not a believer; now I am!  The meat comes out wonderfully tender--perfect for shredded BBQ beef sandwiches!  I marinated the beef for a few hours in a bottle of beer, 1/4 c. oil, 1/2 c. rice wine vinegar, a little salt, pepper and a sliced onion.  After being in the oven, it was so easy to shred, and it was very easy to discard the fat.  Very tender, very easy, very tasty!  Great recipe!  Thanks!

This recipe is awesome.  Before I tried it I could not cook meat worth a darn.  Now I can brag about my barbecue brisket.  I used Gates and Sons Barbecue sauce from Kansas City.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

I must say I was skeptical when I first came across this recipie.  I always thought the way to cook brisket was low and slow.  I followed the recipie exactly and was very happy with the results along with my husband and 4 kids!  Very moist and flavorful and DO slice the meat as suggested, then you get more yummy BBQ sauce on every bite.  Plus it makes serving easier when your not standing there cutting meat at the table.

What a great way to prepare brisket. My local grocery store sells whole brisket in a bag for as little as $1.70 a pound what a deal, just cut the whole brisket in half and use this recipe for a good inexpensive meal. My children like this served on hoagie or hamburger buns. One of the previous reviews mentioned Jack Daniels barbecue sauce, I was glad to hear that I wasn't the only one that didn't care for the flavor of this sauce. I don't experiment anymore, either I make my own sauce or use KC Masterpiece Original.

very easy and very delicious! I didn't slice the beef before adding the bbq sauce, which I think kept it moist and tender until serving time. I look forward to making this again!

This has to be the best brisket recipe I've ever tasted, and I can't believe how easy it was!  We had friends over when I made this, and it was a huge hit.  One of our friends is a chef who has been to school for cooking, and even he said it was very flavorful and tender.  We will definitely be making this one again.

Based on other reviews of it coming tough, I cooked it at a lower temp of 255 and it came out like shoe leather.  Flavor was good but tough.

I’ve tried many recipes for brisket in the oven, and this is the BEST, without a doubt.

PLEASE READ - I added smoked paprika.  I didn't measure the seasonings because the amount of seasonings is based on the size of the brisket.  Just use enough to lightly coat both sides of the brisket.  Use a pan that has a lip around the entire pan.  That's important to get a good seal with your aluminum foil.  Bake fat side down.  The fat almost disappears during the cooking cycle.  One hour before it's done I drained the liquid created by the brisket, sliced it then added the 1 cup of water/1 cup of your favorite barbecue sauce (mixed) to the pan, resealed and returned to the oven for the remaining hour.  THE BRISKET WAS THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD!  THE FLAVOR WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD AND IT WAS MELT IN YOUR MOUTH TENDER!!  YOU MUST TRY THIS SIMPLE RECIPE

This was quite tasty and didn't require too much attention.  The ONLY change that I will make next time is to add liquid smoke to it.  That was missed, but otherwise it was good and I will make it again.

I was going to make the brisket on the grill but heavy rains prevented that. The only substitution I made was using some Guinness Ale instead of water. Came out good, tender and tasty. Only reason I gave four stars instead of five was I wasn’t able to smoke it so it didn’t quite have the full flavor I wanted. That said, it was certainly good and if need be I would use this recipe again.

It came out really tender and delicious even though I didn’t slice it.  My boys don’t like bbq sauce so I skipped.  I rubbed it with Tony Chachere spice to give it flavor and also replaced water with beer.  I added baby carrots, onions and potatoes in the last hour. Seems 4lbs wasn’t enough for my boys!

this is a pretty mediocre recipe. it is very, very easy and the result is not bad, but it's not particularly good at all. nothing special. the meat doesn't end up particularly tender and the flavor is good only because BBQ sauce tastes good (which it does, so the flavor is good...like BBQ sauce).

Very tough and hard to chew. The only flavor comes from the sauce. You will find the brisket is overcooked even before the instructions tell you to add water/sauce mixture and put back in the oven. I still think you can accomplish an "alright" brisket in the oven but this obviously isn't the way to do it. Anyone looking for something similar to smoked Texas-style brisket will be really disappointed. This is a hard, overcooked chunk of meat.

Followed directions exactly and it wasnt very tender. Not sure if it was the cut of meat or maybe it needed more bbq sauce/ water.

My brisket turned out tough. Tasted good, but really tough. I think maybe it cooked too long? I followed the recipe exactly. I could have been the cut of meat too.

Made this today and love it! Cooked it in my slow cooker and the meat was so tender you could flake it with a fork. The only thing I changed was add more BBQ sauce. This is a keeper and will make this often. Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent!  I was worried making this as it was my first attempt at a beef brisket and I was cooking for 20 people.  It was so easy to make, tender and full of flavor.  I wish we had more leftover.  I made this the day before and reheated in the am.  It did not dry out at all.  I used Big Al's BBQ Sauce recipe from this site.  I will be making this again soon.  Thanks for a great tailgating recipe.

I made this recipe on the 4th of July.  My husband loved it.  I pretty much followed the recipe, but I added my own seasoning blend instead of just the salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Did follow the directions for the timing and addition of the barbeque sauce.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  I had to make it again a few days later as my husband requested it. :)

I made this exactly by the recipe, but accidently misread the temp and had it on 170 for 2 hrs.  Changed the temp and probably cooked it 3 more hrs at correct temp.  It was incredibly tender and both the men in our family raved about the tenderness and taste.  Thank you

This was the first time I tried this recipe.  I didn't care for it much, I enjoy brisket the traditional way(boiled) but I tried it for my husband. He liked it. I used his favorite BBQ. The meat was tender enough, I just didn't like the flavor

So good...I made my own BBQ to go with it and it just cooked perfect!  It's nice to get a tender brisket without having to take two days to make it.

Husband loved it. It was ok for me. I guess I'm just used to my dad's brisket which has a thick marinade. I guess this one was watered down too much for me. But this isn't bad. In fact it was nice and tender. Goes great with mashed potatoes.

This is a wonderful recipe! and so easy.  It was tender and very flavorful.  I even skipped the slicing part and it still turned out wonderfully. We had guests and it was a huge hit!
