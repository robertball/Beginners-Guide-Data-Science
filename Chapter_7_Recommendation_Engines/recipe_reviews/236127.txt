I have to be the dissenting vote here. I see that someone recommended an extra can of coconut milk - that would be fine but for me I felt there was a sufficient amount of coconut milk. BUT the whole thing was just so bland. The picture provided is clearly not this recipe as it is given, as a simple scan through the ingredients will uncover nothing to make the sauce a beautiful curry yellow nor anything with the color red (although you could easily add your own red peppers). I actually added some shredded coconut in an attempt to make the coconut flavor a little stronger - because really, it's just coconut milk, onion, green beans and chicken. (I did add garlic but that didn't save it either) So in the end, it's not horrible, it's just very boring, and a recipe I won't make again.

I used suggestions from others and it turned out fantastic.  It was a great way to use some of the green beans from the garden.  I also threw in some of the snap peas.  I used garlic, onion, and plenty of red pepper flakes.  Everyone loved it.

I found the basic recipe to be very bland, not thickened or creamy as in the picture. This recipe just wasn't what I expected.

This recipe was good but I had to add some extras to make it even better. First of all I used two cans of coconut milk because one wasn't enough and the chicken would had been dry if I hadn't done so. Then I added two cloves of garlic and a half of a red pepper I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and added more salt to the creamy coconut milk. We ate it with white rice and it was very enjoyable. Yummy!
