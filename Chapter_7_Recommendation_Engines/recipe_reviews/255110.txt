These were delicious. I had some issues with finding the right temperature because they stuck to my machine. This has never happened before. Regardless, these were loved by everyone, even non-celiac. Thank you for the recipe.

These were crispy and delicious! The only change I made was to add blueberries at my husbandâ€™s request. Next time I will back off a little on the cashew milk to account for the additional moisture from the fruit. Wonderful recipe-adding this one to our weekend rotation!
