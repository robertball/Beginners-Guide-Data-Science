This was very good, not too sour, not too sweet. I used diet soda and zero calorie lemonade to cut down on sugar and calories.

Amazing! I purchased Rehorst Vodka which is a local distillery in Wisconsin and used Rose's Sour Apple Mixer.  I could have drank these all night, but settled for 2 1/2 (gave some to Wife).  My brother in-law loved them too.  My sister was drooling looking at them but she is pregnant so I had to make her a virgin one.  Will make again.

I did NOT use "top-shelf" vodka or apple schnapps, I used diet lemon-lime soda, and used a lite lemonade.  It was still one of the best martini's I've ever had.  A good mix or sweet and tart and very tasty!  This recipe is a keeper, I will be making this a lot!
