I'm embarrassed to admit that I ate the  entire pan of this for dinner tonight. I used a mixture of cheeses - extra sharp Cheddar, smoked Gouda and Parmesan. This would be good with cabbage and cauliflower. Delicious. Thanks, Michele!

Absolutely delicious!  I read the reviews that some people found it bland so I made some small changes.  I sauteed the cabbage in olive oil along with half an onion which I had leftover from another recipe.  I had some leftover Asiago cheese that had rosemary in it that I used for most of the cheese but added what I needed of Romano cheese.  I added a pinch of red pepper flakes to the cream sauce which I made with skim milk.  To the top I added seasoned panko bread crumbs.  Husband says this is a keeper!

I sauteed the cabbage until tender instead of steaming.  Tastes great!

lol  I keep forgetting that I am old.  (66)  This is basic white sauce with cheese.  This is the best recipe to know.  Then add flavourings.  Add cheddar for noodles or macaroni.  Same recipe...different cheese.  Once you know the basics for thin, medium and thick white sauce...can be used for all sorts of things.  I love creamed peas.  or with different herbs...oh and garlic.  for potatoes too.  OOO creamed spuds are great.  And of course cabbage, cauliflower.  Geesh I should be writing a blog here.  Sorry.  This is the basic sauce when they call it "scalloped".

This dish was ok.  The romano cheese didn't melt very well.  It was something different to try, but will probably not make it again.

Mixed review on this one. My husband loved it, I thought it was rather bland. I added a layer of shredded Swiss cheese in addition to the Parmesan/Romano cheese between layers of cabbage and sprinkled Swiss cheese over the top. Then I placed the casserole under the broiler for the last five minutes to brown the cheese. I must admit, the next day leftovers seemed tastier. It was something different to make with cabbage and I would definitely make it again.

My husband loves cabbage, so I decided to try something different.  This will be a keeper, he loved it.  I used parmesan instead of romano, because I had all the other ingredients on hand.  Kids wouldnt touch it, but I really didnt expect them to.

Served this for Thanksgiving everyone said it was OK! Kind of bland.  I thought it would be creamier.  Don't know if I would make it again.

This was a very tasty smooth and mild recipe which my whole family enjoyed.
I did use Napa Chinese Cabbage as my husband won't eat regular cabbage, and it was excellent.  I've also prepared it with different types of cheddar and other mild cheeses to match the flavors of the main dish, with equally delicious results.  I've subbed in canned milk, and Half&Half to replace milk with tasty results, using the cream for a fancy dinner, and the canned milk when I ran out of whole milk.  I've frozen some in meal sized portions and will report back how it does as a OMC dish.  Kudos to Michele and thanks for this recipe.

I made it tonight, it was delicious.
I did not steamed my cabbage, I sauted it in olive oil and onions.
I definitely will make it again.
Thanks for the recipe.
Bon appétit

This turned out very well. I did add a couple extra cheeses, Havarti, and cheddar cheese. Plus, I added some purple cabbage to it as well.

This was definitely different and good! I followed suggestions of sautéing some thin sliced onions in the butter as well as red pepper flakes. I made a white sauce and then added an Italian cheese mix. I will probably do this again when I have leftover cabbage and looking for some comfort food. Thank you!

This was a hit in my house! I sautéed first in olive oil with just a little onion. I replaced the Romano cheese with shredded bacon cheddar. Delicious!

Subbed wheat flour with gluten free brown rice flour and "real" asiago and pepper jack cheese for the romano cheese.   Hubby ate it and actually said, "Don't lose the recipe."

I was looking for something different to do with my cabbage & I'm so glad I found this because I wouldn't have ever thought of trying this. Admittedly, I added some chicken stock and used Feta cheese - that's what I had and I love the salty goodness! - and put my cabbage under some seared chicken breasts, then put it in the oven to finish cooking. It was really good!

This had a good flavor, but was a little bland.  Doesn't need the romano cheese, just some onion powder, salt and pepper and a little bacon grease.  Much better after I spiced it up a bit.
