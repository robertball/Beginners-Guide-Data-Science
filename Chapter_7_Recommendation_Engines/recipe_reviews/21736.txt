This recipe is simple yet delicious. I skipped the capers and used a normal non-stick frying pan. Poured the olive oil into the pan instead of coating the salmon with it. Perfectly accompanied by my favorite salad composed of tomatoes, onions, feta cheese with lemon juice and olive oil. Thanks!

A great, simple recipe that can be modified for your own preferences.  I like to season my salmon with garlic powder, pepper, and lemon juice prior to frying.  I add the oil to the pan rather than the salmon and cook over medium-high heat for 3 minutes on each side.  With this method the salmon will be slightly translucent in the center.  I add the capers for the last minute of cooking.  I like to serve this over salad with tomatoes, onion, kalamata olives, avocado, feta cheese, and champagne vinaigrette dressing.

This dish is wonderful!  It is so quick and easy and full of flavor.  The only thing I would do different is wait a little longer to add the capers because they got a bit too over-cooked.

Will I made my wife happy...made this dish for her. It’s easy to make and its taste great. The Capers and lemon gives the salmon a nice flavor, the capers did rolled off the salmon, so I took a teaspoon of liquid from the capers and put it over the salmon, then put the capers on when I plated the salmon made. It made my wife so happy…she went to the mall and got a new handbag

This is a fast and flavourful recipe.  Combined with the saltiness of the capers I did not think adding salt was necessary.  I also did not rub olive oil on the salmon because it is a fatty fish to begin with.  I did however, spray the pan with olive oil to prevent it from sticking.  However, I enjoyed it immensely and I would make it again.
As a side item, I sautéed brussel sprouts with olive oil and garlic.  Delish!

Delicious and easy! I made it in regular frying pan, like other reviewers I put some olive oil in the pan instead of rubbing the salmon with oil. Instead of cooking with the capers, I put 1 table spoon of caper juice while cooking and garnished with the capers once I put the salmon on the plate. (capers will roll off the salmon and burn on the bottom of the pan).

The meat was moist on the inside but that's about it. I didn't expect such a smoky process complete with smoke alarm blaring!! I should have taken the advice of another reviewer that suggested lower heat for a longer amount of time. Sear the fish then cook it on a lower temp.

Very good simple recipe for those of us seeking a high protein low fat nutritious meal; very good! I have to say, however, to those of you using a nonstick pan, DO NOT ADD OIL OR NON STICK SPAYS TO THAT EXPENSIVE PAN... YOU WILL REGRET RUINING THE NON STICK FINISH! Use, as the author of this recipe recommended, a heavy cast iron or stainless steel skillet.

Living here on the Pacific Coast salmon is a staple and plentiful in season,whether it be Spring (Steelhead), Sockeye or Coho they all have different  grades of fat and should be cooked accordingly, so don't assume that all salmon are similar.My preference is fresh Spring. Pan frying is fine but for full flavour and texture I sear one inch thick filets for 30 seconds per side and then lay on a parchment lined tray and bake on the middle shelf of the oven, preheated to 450F for about 4 - 5 minutes. Lemon wedges certainly but a Parsley sauce for satisfaction. A good Reisling for pairing. Bon appetit.

Great salmon dish! I did modify a bit by removing the fish after cooking then added the capers with the juice of one lemon and 2T of butter to make a easy sauce. Fantastic and quick main course for a week night.

This was a great recipe.  I was looking for the easiest salmon recipe I could find, and this certainly lived up to my hopes.  It was moist and flavorful, as well as easy to put together.

Outstanding for what ten minutes can get you.  It was great not having to turn on the oven for a summer meal.  I used a cast iron skillet and was very pleased by the nice browning and extremely moist texture.  The capers liked to runaway, though, so next time I might try rubbing on spices as other reviewers have done.

Hey people - how can you complain about blandness? Salmon, when not overcooked, is heaven on a plate, no matter how it is prepared. If you need to practice with fish, stat with thin fillets and cook for a minute or two on each side.  Most fresh fish cooks up in less than the standard 10 minutes per inch.  If your salmon is completely opaque, you have probably overcooked it. Please experiment and don't overpower your wonderful food with too much external flavor.  Save the extra herbs and spices for tofu.

Outstanding, fast and easy recipe for everyday or company.   I used Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of salt and pepper.   The butcher at my grocery store gave me that tip for seasoning salmon years ago.  Its a fabulous combo.  I had always microwaved it before, but this recipe gives a great crispy texture.

For some reason I thought it strange to rate this recipe because it's so incredibly simple, & minus the capers is one of the ways I always cook salmon. I decided to add my rating because this "recipe" shows you don't need alot of fancy ingredients or techniques to turn out a great tasting main dish. A great "recipe" because it allows the fish to be the star - no need for anything but a great piece of fish & simple seasonings. I usually prepare this in the GF grill, sometimes w/ addition of dijon mustard, make a quick salad & boom - a very nice yet lite dinner's done in less than 5 minutes - Love it!

I made it with salt and roasted garlic/herb seasoning. It was delicious! In fact, my husband, who is a salmon connoisseur, said it was better than restaurant salmon. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks Noreen!

Very simple yet delicious recipe. Thank you for the tip to heat the pan first. It makes all the difference. This is my first use of capers. I can't imagine how I've not used them before - gorgeous flavor.

Olive oil is perfect for this recipe. I use Pompeian Organic Extra Virgin. I had no problems with it and the heat of my heavy stainless steel pan.

This recipe is also wonderful served with Narsharab as a dipping sauce. Narsharab is a pomegranate sauce which can be hard to come by unless you live near a Russian community.  You can order it on Amazon though the price is rather steep. NetCost grocery stores carry it near the fish section.

Very tasty, and very easy to make.  My husband does most of the cooking, but I have taken on one night a week and this was one of my first attempts.  We both loved it, and I wasn't too intimidated to make it!  It will be added to our regular repertoire.

I just finished this dish 10 minutes ago served with the roasted brussel(s) sprouts recipe from this site and a salad of lettuce/walnuts/apples/blueberries with a balsamic vinaigrette.  
I followed the directions almost precisely. Based on other reviewer recommendations,  I sprinkled the fillets with dill, garlic, and lemon juice before I coated the fish in olive oil. I also added the capers last.
One of the best meals I have had ever. Thank you so much!

Very quick and easy.  Beautiful color and flavor!  I made the mistake in putting oil in the skillet first then putting the salmon in.   Next time I will do the opposite for less grease.

This was a very quick meal to make, but the recipe was very basic and the flavor didn't have much to it.  The capers didn't really add much to the salmon flavor.  it might be better with a caper sauce.  I'll make it again, but it wasn't fantastic.  I too sprayed the pan and then I used a lemon rub on the fish.

This was a very easy to make Salmon recipe. Salmon doesn't need much to make a great dish and the combination of the capers and the lemon really brought out the natural flavor of this fish. I used the salt sparingly since capers are packed in brine and always have a salty kick. I would also recommend keeping your skillet covered, especially with thicked cuts, in order for the fish to cook through. I'll definately be making this again!

Just got done making (and eating) this. VERY good, had a nice crust and great flavor. The Capers were great because it cut some of the fattiness of the fish. Thanks for this Recipe!

This was really quick, easy, and good!  Marinaded the salmon in lemon juice, lemon zest, dill, old bay, and pepper for about 25 minutes.  Then seared the filets skin side (bottom side) first as directed with the cover on.  Make sure to use lots of capers, as what you're expecting isn't enough!

EXCELLENT!  Fast and yummy!  Sprinkled a bit of dill on salmon too.  Covered as others have mentioned.  Five minues total cooking time.  Perfect, flaky, and healthy!

Yes Ma'am!  This is so simple but so delish!  I even messed up and put oil in the pan instead of coating the salmon.  It still turned out great.  I also added just a light sprinkle of garlic and parsley.

Very good, I sprinkled garlic powder and italian seasoning after brushing with oil.  I also added the capers at the end as the smushed.  Very tasty with risotto and garlic green beans.

This is a great recipe. However, even though I cook  a lot i am unsure of the method. Is it better to use a nonstick skillet or enameled cast iron? (my 2 choices at the moment because where i currently live.) It always sticks and i lose the yummy crispy part to the pan. suggestions please.
thank you,
 family cook

Delicious! I never realized how yummy pan seared salmon could be. I always cook it in the oven. I will definitely do it this way from now on. The only thinks I changed were to add the lemon to the salmon beforehand & to add the olive oil directly to the pan.

Make sure pan is really hot before adding the salmon.

Really very good.  My wife's favorite.  I usually end up cooking the salmon a bit longer without increasing to high heat.  And, at the risk of incuring the wrath of purists, after turning them I squirt a bit of lemon juice (from a bottle) over each fillet and sprinkling with dried dill.

Wow, this was delicious and so easy to make!  I used olive oil spray and added dill, lemon pepper, garlic salt, lemon juice, and a small pat of butter on the tops.  I omitted the capers since I don't care for them.  My boyfriend's really picky and he ate every last bite of this.

Love the combination of salmon with capers and lemon, and yes this dish was very easy, but I had some trouble with the outside of the fish browning too quickly with the high heat, and the inside not being quite done enough. Could you use a high temp. to sear it for 2-3 min. then lower the heat to cook through? I loved the taste, so I will experiment with a different temp.the next time I make it.

I needed something quick and easy (without alot of clean up) and this was it!   

I pan fried following directions and then sprinkled generously a mixture of garlic salt, lemon pepper and dill.  I also squeezed a few drops of lemon juice on.  

It turned out nice and crunchy and yet the inside was tender.

This recipe was truly wonderful.  The only change was for my extra thick salmon filets.  I used 2 large filets and seared as directed in my cast iron dutch oven.  I then transferred it to a 450 degree oven to complete the cooking.  I also added the capers near the end instead of halfway through.  The fish was truly wonderful.  And to top it off, I seared some fresh green beans in the dutch oven for a couple minutes and then served those alongside.  Yum!

This salmon was to die for. I added some lemon juice after cooking and it was a hit. The skin was nice and crispy and the meat was buttery and soft. Although I also like baked salmon, this is definitely my go-to method for making salmon from now on!

A little too crusty on the outside for me, and I did feel that it was a bit better with some extra seasoning (rosemary and garlic - nearly burned the garlic), but it was a great starting recipe. I kept the heat on medium high, and removed the thinner portion at the recommended time. I then covered the thicker piece and cooked an extra minute. Delicious - thanks!

This is a delicous recipe. I put the oil in the pan and then added some caper juice over the fish, I put the capers in the last minute of cooking. I also took the advice of one of the other reviews and peared it with salad, tomatoes, onion, and the fete cheese with olive oil and lemon juice. Thanks for the idea!!

My Wife and I made this last night.  It was the best Salmon dish either of us have ever had by a very long shot.  The pan searing locks in the flavor and gives the salmon a nice toasted outer texture.  We substituted salt-free salt substitute and paired the dish up with angel hair pasta with Numan's own garden pepper sauce.  To the sauce we added fresh sliced mushrooms, sliced black olives and sliced roasted and marinated peppers.   Probably one of the best meals we have ever experienced, ever.

I eat salmon every week and was skeptical of this easy recipe. I was wrong. Very easy and delicious! I added garlic powder because I love garlic. Just be careful not to overcook and enjoy!

That was NOT very good salmon.  Thankfully I followed some peoples advice in the reviews and used a lid.  Make sure you have an exhaust fan.

Very quick and easy to make.  I followed others' advice and put put the olive oil in the pan and sprinkled with Montreal seasoning.  Very tasty.  DH really liked it too.

(Gabe) This is my classic way of cooking salmon on a stove. Instead of capers I use LOTS of garlic + limes. I made it tonight my wife said it was WAY better then the salmon she had at the Cheesecake Factory last night. So... Try this recipe! :)

Very good! This is now definitely my preferred method for salmon. I forgot the capers, so added a bit of lemon juice and dill for flavor instead. Just be careful about cooking on "high"--depending on your stove, it may be too hot. I smoked out my whole apartment! Fortunately it didn't burn, though, and came out great.

My 11-year old and I made this tonight using Steelhead trout (yes trout!) instead of  salmon and it was fantastic.  We made some basmati rice and a broccoli/cauliflower mix to go with it and it was one of the best dinners we've had in a long time.  My daughter picked the recipe and helped me cook it and was very proud at how it turned out!  This really takes the KISS rule to heart in keeping it simple and letting the flavour of the food shine through.

My salmon was delicious. I made it for my girlfriend Marsha and her husband and she can't stop telling me how wonderful it was. The only change to the recipe that I made was to add garlic powder and a touch of New Orleans seasoning.

I love this recipe. My only recommendation is to add ingredients (such as salt) only to taste - otherwise, this was a bit strong for me. Also, I agree with other reviewers' recommendations to sear both sides only enough to get it crispy (1-2 minutes at most for me) and then cooking at low.

Excellent in its simplicity!  I added a handful of seedless flame grapes along with the capers half way through the sear.  I squeezed a tablespoon of lemon juice over the salmon filets toward the end but did not include lemon in the plating.  The 'blistered' grapes and capers were sufficient, with the grapes contributing a colorful and delicious counter point to the capers.  Plated the salmon (with a few grapes and capers) on a bed of sweet pea risotto.  One of my wife's new favorites now!

I live in Alaska, so my husband just brought some King Salmon home from fishing and I made this.  Sooo tasty, delicious, yummy.  I didn't have capers on hand, so I put a little garlic olive oil in towards the end of cooking. I used my Grandma's cast iron skillet and it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper.

I live in Manhattan and I don't normally cook. I bought all new cookware and headed to this site to try my frist recipe. Uh, what? I followed these instructions to the letter. What kind of stoves are they using? Portable camping ones? I have a normal apartment gas stove. 

OK 3 minutes on medium heat. Into the pan goes the the salmon with the olive oil. WHOOSH! it sent huge plumes of smoke all throughout the apartment. It looked like the place was on fire. I almost called the whole thing off, but kept going. 

And after just 2 minutes on so-called "high-heat" the so-called "stainless stell" pan (brand new) was ruined. It's been several hours and smoke still hasn't subsided. 

Don't use medium or high heat with olive oil.

Prepared this tonight for dinner and it was better than you would find in any restaurant.  My husband is a meat and potatoes man and he raved about it.  I did however make a hollandaise sauce, just for my own personal taste.  Excellent.

Loved it! At first I thought the recipe seemed a little boring, but gave it a try anyway because of all the positive reviews. The ingredients are simple and tastes great! I really like how the salmon ends up with a bit of crunch. Only issue is I can't stand how the olive oil is popping while I cook.

Love it!  Cooked just like the recipe.  I noticed that a lot of the capers fell off during searing so I added a few after, but this is a GREAT recipe.  Super easy and tastes just as good as another salmon recipe I made that had lots more ingredients and 3x more work.  I love this recipe.  Will be making it tonight.  Also, I made a special horseradish sauce for dipping that complimented very nicely.

Yum! Yum! Yum! Made just as directed. Next time I'll hold off on adding the capers until closer to the end of the cooking time. A few got so hot that they went pinging around my kitchen like little bits of floral shrapnel!

Pretty good, quick too. I added some additional flavor with chopped black olives, white wine and added some of the chive juice as recommended by another member.

I love to cook and I love salmon, but these are just plain bad instructions. If you turn skillet to high as instructed it will burn the salmon and oil. Do not cook at this recommended heat. You are much better off keeping at medium to medium high heat.

The dish was good and got a nice crispy exterior but had to add extra seasoning since it was too bland. Also, make sure that the fillets are extra thin.

We tried cooking salmon using this method versus our normal baking method. Although we followed the instructions, the salmon was only seared on both sides and uncooked throughout most of the fillet. We had to cut it into smaller fillets and continue cooking it for about 10 minutes for it to be cooked thoroughly.

I made the heat medium high and cooked each side 3 min. I also used 2 tablespoon of caper juice along with 2 tablespoons of capers.  Tender and juicy, but missing a zesty kick that it needs. It's all right, but needs to be taken to the next level.

I really liked this salmon recipe.  I think the only thing I would change is a tad less lemon.  But I think that is just my preference so make it like the recipe & adjust it next time if necessary.  The capers really added to it, I would not leave them out.

It was amazing; crispy on the outside and very tender within. I didn't add capers, just the lemon. Served simply with rice and asparagus. Delicious! I have made it several times.

The salmon was just a basic recipe, but the capers burned before the salmon was done. I would add those later.

I'm a first time salmon cooker and this recipe was so easy and tasty. My only suggestion is to shorten the cooking time on the 2nd side. Five minutes was a bit too long. I like my salmon a little more flaky.

I've made this exact recipe several times but have now put my own twist on the outcome. I season with Himalayan sea salt, fresh cracked pepper, and a dusting of cayenne pepper for a little heat. One one side (the serving side without veins or non-skin side) I sprinkle a little dried parsley. The parsley cooks up nice on the flip-side and makes some nice crunchies in the pan and gives the fish really nice flavor and color for serving. 

I use a pat of salted butter and a couple of swirls of EVOO in a stainless skillet. I find that non-stick pans just do not give the proper sear for fish that it needs for flavor. I distribute the butter and oil evenly and then heat the pan to medium-high. I put each piece of fish in when the oil/butter is hot and sear for 3 minutes, flip and do the same on the parsleyed side for an additional 5 minutes and reduce the heat down to medium so it doesn't dry out. or burn. I turn the pan off, remove it from the heat and drain the fish and brown bits on a single layer of paper towels. 

The little brown bits in the bottom of the pan are particularly tasty and make a nice presentation on top of the fish when plated. I even add some minced spring onions on top. 

For a topping I mix 1/2 cup of sour cream, 2 tbsp. of fresh lime juice, a sprinkle of sea salt and ground black pepper, and a tsp of dried dill. Mix until combined. The dill and the crunch brown bits really add wonderful flavor to the fish and the cayenne gives it just a little spicy kick. Fis

I subbed butter for the olive oil and didn't hear my pan for 3 mins so it wouldn't burn the butter. Just adds more flavor.

I usually don't leave negative reviews online, but I feel the need to warn people about this. Don't try it unless you want your entire house engulfed with smoke and every smoke alarm going off, and the salmon burnt on the outside and raw inside. Olive oil and high heat is a no. Disregard this recipe, look for another.

Quite good, and I'm not much of a seafood lover; though I should be eating more.

You definitely have to use the lemon to squirt some of the juice onto the salmon, otherwise the fish is kind of bland. But if you do that, it's pretty good! Not my favorite way to eat salmon, but it was quick and easy, so if you're crunched for time, this would be the way to go.

It’s amazing that such a simple recipe makes the most wonderful salmon! It’s always moist and flakey, never dry.  This is the only way I’m cooking it from now on. It’s easy to adjust the taste by playing with different spices, and I thank the reviewers who suggested adding some of the caper juice to salmon when cooking. It added so much flavor. This is a very easy, very elegant dish.

I had a nice piece of sockeye salmon. No changes made to recipe.  It just turned out too well done.
Could be my electric stove .
Salmon recipe wasn’t bad.  Just nothing special IMO

good recipe, simple, easy, fast. however, 5 minutes on high was way too much, and having it on high at all is way too much. i'm not so good at cooking though. It burned one side that i had it on for 5 minutes. maybe 3-4 mins on each side on med to med-high heat?

The recipe was simple which my wife likes when it comes to cooking salmon. I did add some sun-dried tomato and re-hydrated them in lemon and lime juice. I used butter instead of olive oil.

I had a few pieces of Salmon, (fresh) of varying thickness, so I followed the recipe for the regular size pieces and the larger thicker piece of 1+ inches I added 2 minutes to the final cook time.    I used a nice stoneware type non stick pan,  added oil to the pan, not the fish,    seared the skin side first for 3 minutes,  then flipped it and followed the directions from there.   Didn't add capers.

Very simple, fast and delicious. Didn't add lemon as I felt bad for cutting up a lemon for one portion (only cooked this dish for myself). Added brown rice and a dash of honey mustard for a nice kick. Yum!

Made it exactly as described in the recipe.
A big success!
Easy, quick, succulent. The cook-by-searing method works well on a steak, too. (with steak spices, not capers).

Exactly as written--well, maybe some extra capers well drained. Quick.  Good. Easy. Tasty. Any leftover is delicious, too. Oh, I spray the olive oil on from a can of olive oil spray....works especially well. I have made it many times and it's always a winner.

I love this recipe! It is so easy and *so* tasty! I did pour the olive oil into the pan rather than coating the salmon, and I used my trusty cast-iron skillet. I had no trouble with smokiness using the recommended burner setting--the cook time is really quick. I've used this recipe several times now,  and even without the lemon (because I didn't have it the one time), the dish turns out great. I have added this recipe to my go-to cache--thanks for the great recipe!

Super easy and tasty...Timing on the searing is important but it always comes out crispy on the outside and tasty (even when I burn it it's still good!)

I have made this recipe as stated twice and the results were fantastic. The second time I did use steelhead trout, which  is similar to salmon  in flavor, texture and size. The fish is very simply prepared which allows flavor to shine. Thank you for the restaurant quality meal.

Simple and delicious.  I didn't have capers and added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper for a bit of spice.

Awesome! So easy and tasty! We devoured it in less than 10 minutes. I would be more careful with salt next time - maybe only capers or only salt; or just a slight bit of each -  there was a bit too much. Other than that, I plan on cooking this meal as often as possible from now on! Delicious!

Quick, Easy, and pretty good! I want to give it a 4 1/2 but I can't. Will definately do again. I think fresh, not thawed frozen salmon would be better.

I love the simplicity of this, and it came together very quickly.  I served with steamed broccoli and homemade basil/rosemary bread.

I've tried many different salmon recipes in the past (which just tasted okay), but this is my new favorite. The simplicity of pan searing the salmon leaves the skin crispy and the rest of the filet moist. Dinner didn't take long to prepare at all, which is the best part for me. My boyfriend has already asked me to make this again =) Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this recipe for my husband and son and we all loved it.  It was so simple and we loved the flavor of the capers with the salmon.  I've made it several times and passed the recipe on to friends who also love it as well.
