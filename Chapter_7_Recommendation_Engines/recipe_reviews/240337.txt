A heads up about  the recipe turning out watery. Read the labels of the chicken breasts you buy. If they say brined anywhere the meat has been puffed up by increasing the water content of the meat. When you cook in a slow cooker the water has no way to evaporate and you end up with watery curry. 
I made this using non-brined chicken breasts and it came out beautiful.

at first i was going to give this four stars and bf asked why.. i told him that it was good but it didn't wow me.. i served his plate first (over plain white rice) and forgot the cilantro, lemon, and left out the cream.. the cilantro was the key.. i added some on my finished plate and that made all the difference.. i had cooked some cauliflower in the residual gravy and added it to my plate .. five stars it is.. i used thighs for the breasts.. two 8 oz cans of tomato sauce.. and greek yogurt for the plain.. i usually use Easy Garam Masala from this site when it's called for.. but unfortunately i was out of cardamom so i just used the recipe minus the cardamom.. bf said this reminded him of spanish rice but i think it's b/c of the cumin, jalapeno, garlic and tomato sauce.. either way we really enjoyed this.. ty so much for the recipe

Super delicious. Was even better 2 days after. I cooked it w/ diced chicken thighs for 2.5 hours on high and used half and half and light plain yogurt and it was so good.

This is the perfect answer to Indian take out. Usually we order Indian about once a week and this was just as good. I made exactly as instructed and it turned out perfectly. The lemon at the end really makes it balance perfectly. I made some basmati rice, salad, and naan to round out the meal. Delicious will definitely make again.  The spice is not over powering or too hot. My husband and 18 month old both had seconds.

Delish! And easy to make! I took this over to my sister and brother in law, they had never had Indian food before. They both ate about 3 plates and even made more rice because we ran out. My husband, who loves Indian was grateful that I doubled the recipe so he could have left overs. Definitely a keeper recipe!

After living in Chicago, and visiting Devon Street for fantastic Indian cuisine we moved to a SMALL town in North Carolina. Not an Indian restaurant in sight. I finally decided to make this for my husband. Wow were we pleased. This is great! Wonderful flavor and spice. I went with crushed red pepper instead of jalepeno for personal taste. Love this!

I followed the recipe exactly, and at the end, it had the consistency of water and the chicken was very dry.  It wasn't SO bad that I feel like it was a total waste of a lot of expensive spices, but I don't think we'll eat the leftovers.

Excellent.  Used nonfat plain yogurt.  No tomato sauce, so used tomato paste mixed with 1 1/2 cans of water.  Addicting.

Really enjoyed this dish. Very easy to execute and full of flavor! I used 1/8 cup of lemon juice instead of a fresh lemon, because we didn't have any fresh lemons, and used dried cilantro instead of fresh cilantro, again because I forgot. Still was delicious, but can definitely see how fresh ingredients would have made this dish pop more!

My family, who usually is not too big into trying new "exotic" foods loved it. Will definitely make again.

Adding the lemon at the end made a huge difference. I am not a huge fan of this dish. I make it for my son when he wants it. This time I used this recipe and my crock pot. It was wonderful. Now this is the only way I will make it. I cut the cooking time down in the crock pot because over cooked chicken breast is dry. Hubby who is also not a fan, had seconds.

It's our first time with a slow cooker and chose the easiest chicken and beef recipes to start. This one was fantastic. I didn't use jalapeños but tried to balance with the black pepper. I thought the recipe could use a slightly sweeter flavor, in our case the side was lightly salted fried plantains which helped to scoop up the sauce. I also cut back on cilantro as I hate it but I couldn't even feel it at the end. My chicken ended up slightly dry for my taste (we cooked for 6h30m then 1h after final step) so next time will either cut in smaller pieces or stop earlier. But all in all the best easy recipe for someone starting with a slow cooker looking for a fantastic, elaborate and impressive result.

The entire family loved this dish. I did sauté my chicken breast in ghee before I cubed it and used coconut cream instead of dairy cream. Since the chicken was already cooked, I reduced the cooking time to 4 hours and it was perfectly spiced and delicious served with rice and naan that we had fun making on the grill. I will be making this recipe again in the future.

I have made a similar recipe in the slow cooker but this one has tons of flavor!  This recipe is often requested by my family and I usually double it since it seems to taste even better the next day.  I do substitute fat free half n half for the heavy cream to cut back on fat but may try low fat coconut milk next time as a previous reviewer mentioned.  For the family, I serve over white rice and for myself, I serve over cauliflower rice.....don't forget the cilantro it adds a freshness that is delicious!

As with most other recipes I’ve tried for chicken tikka masala, the results were so so. Not terrible, but tasted nothing like what I get at restaurants. The cumin seemed too strong and I also had issues with the dairy curdling. Not sure what type of yogurt to use, so I used full fat plain. Maybe nonfat would have had better results. Added a few tablespoons of sugar at the end to make it taste a little closer to what I’m used to. I like the convenience of using a crock pot, especially since all the spices blend together best when slow cooked. I’ll keep looking for the right spice combo.

Oh, my;oh my! Absolutely delicious. I had two plump organic chicken breasts (organic ones don’t add much water to the mix) less than 1-1/2 lbs. Added a can of coconut milk instead of whipping cream. Yes, it was soupy, but I got another whole meal from the leftover sauce by adding cubed, drained tofu, cauliflower, and carrot chunks.  And my home is perfumed from the spices! Thanks for this easy, delicious recipe.

I’ve made this several times now, including recently for a dinner party. I serve it with brown basmati rice, naan bread and cucumber salad with yogurt mint dressing. This recipe is delicious and a huge hit with guest who like flavorful food. I like things hot, but used a very small jalapeño for guests so it wouldn’t be too spicy hot.

This was very easy. My husband and I enjoyed it. I will be making this again. One change I made was to add cauliflower florets when I added the heaving cream, lemon juice and cilantro. Was very good.

I substituted chicken for beef stew.

Also substituted the whipping cream for another cup of plain, low fat yogurt since the recipe already called for it.  However, I see others used coconut milk, which is great!

OK, I didn't add the peppers. It's so easy to cook! My 4 year old son helped prepare this meal for our family. You can easily add more chicken to the amounts if you wish.

Fantastic the sauce alone is worth your time. If this had no protein and was just sauce pour over rice and you have a vegan delight.

My husband and I loved this dish. We served it over white rice and was delicious.  I did not have the heavy cream so I used a can of coconut milk instead.  This dish is now a staple in our menu. Thanks to the creator.

My first Indian dish and it was superb! My local grocery store did not have garam masala but it's a combination of spices and I made my own from a recipe on allrecipes. Thank you MeanDean!!

I didn’t care for that dish. Made it without jalapeño pepper and it still was to spicy, next time I will reduce black pepper to 1tc. Missing some vegetables so I would put okra, onion and as other suggest coconut milk instead cream.

This recipe was easy to follow. I may not have had all the ingredients, but it was soo delicious. Such a tasty sauce. I did need to purchase more spices to complete the dish, but I feel it was worth it.

This was a big hit with my family. The chicken was moist and tender after slow cooked for 4 1/2 hours.

I followed recipe with the only exception is I replaced heavy cream with coconut milk as suggested by some reviewers. I absolutely love the creamy taste of restaurant style tikka masala. This was not that. Not even close. It was watery, bitter, and a tad too spicy. I did not use brined chicken either as some reviewers contributed the watery quality complaints here to using that. I will look for a better recipe. I don't understand why this got such high reviews.

Very easy and very good! To save time I cooked chicken first, and I used coconut milk in place of yogurt as another reviewer mentioned. 4 hours in slow cooker worked great. Thanks!!

I usually substitute a green bell pepper and a yellow onion for the chicken, because my fiancé is vegetarian, and this really contributes to the flavor! I typically chop up two jalapeños, too, for a little spice! Yummy!

I never had chicken tikka masala before and I'm not sure why I waited so long to try.  This was excellent.  I omitted the jalapeno because I can't eat them; other than that, I made it as written.

The sauce is definitely a bit runny so I mixed in some corn starch. Viola! Restaurant quality tikka masala! The chicken indeed does go a little dry though, but I'll make this again in a heartbeat.

Chicken tikka masala is one of my favorites, and I enjoyed the flavor of this recipe. I used chicken thighs, and the meat was very tender. I cooked it on high in the crockpot for 2.5 hours and then added the final ingredients and cooked another half hour. I also added cayenne and turmeric as another reviewer suggested. Next time I will add more salt. Some reviews complained that it was watery, but I think they didn’t realize that this dish is to be served over rice. The sauce is delicious. I’m looking forward to eating the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Love making this recipe! I started using a 14.5 oz can of coconut milk instead of heavy cream. It doesn’t have a bad effect on the consistency. Still a solid meal prep recipe. I fill four containers with 2-3 cups of cooked basmati rice and pour the tikka masala on top. That’s four dinners for me!

For us, the lemon was a bit overpowering. I think next time, I might use coconut milk instead of yogurt, add lemon to taste, and reduce some of the jalapeno. (It was a bit spicy the next day). Bumping the amount of chicken up to  2lbs would also help. We had a lot of sauce to lap up with naan, which isn't always a bad thing.

The only changes made were because I didn't have the  specific ingredients on hand.   1. used ground ginger instead of fresh 2. omitted the jalapeno pepper 3. omitted the cilantro 4. replaced heavy cream w/can of coconut milk.   Like the other reviewers, I thought this recipe was restaurant grade.  I actually was in such a rush that I used frozen boneless skinless chicken thighs (about 5) and put them in the crockpot on low.  Then mixed the other ingredients in a separate bowl and poured the whole mixture on top of the frozen chicken.  Left the house and came back to a pot of awesomeness!  I will be making this again.

We really liked this. Made it exactly according to recipe. Although we like a lot of spice, felt this was just a bit too much cumin. Will adjust next time and perhaps add some curry to accommodate the reduction.

Delicious! I don't like to use canned tomato, so I pureed two roma tomatoes instead. I also 1 cup of Greek yogurt initially, and another 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt and 1/2 cup of half and half at the end to limit the heavy cream. I used turkey thighs, so I salted the thighs with 2 tsp sea salt and fried them skin side down prior to putting them in the slow cooker. Ah-mazing. Thank you for the recipe!

Note: I cooked on low for 6 hours and the yogurt curdled. At 5 hrs 30 min, I took the chicken out and blended the sauce with the additional greek yogurt and half and half to a smooth consistency. I then put everything back in the slow cooker for another 30 minutes. The consistency turned out perfect.

I would cut back to half a lemon. It gave the sauce a very tangy taste, and cuts away from the spices that really make the flavour of the dish. I would also add a tablespoon of butter. There wasn't very much of that familiar flavour that I am accustomed to. And onion. I was actually really surprised there wasn't any onion in the dish when that's such a huge flavor bonus when you have so many spices combined together. 6 to 8 hours is way too long. I cooked mine on low for 3 hours and the sauce was burning and that was after I added a dollop of oil to the crock pot before adding all the ingredients per direction. Could be because my crock pit is newer so has a higher heat, but with chicken if you cook it for too long it becomes dry I've found, and loses its flavour.

My husband and I love Indian food so we were really excited about finding this recipe. Sadly, it wasn't as good as we wanted it to be. It was edible, but I won't be making this particular version again. It tasted very sour and had a horrible bitter aftertaste. Also, it  called for several expensive spices, etc so we hoped it would be worth the money (which it was not).

Came out pretty watery.  It might be better to cook the chicken in a separate pan, and adding it to the sauce later so that it doesn't come out so dry tasting.

This was packed full of spicy flavor and was delicious.  I don't often plan ahead when I cook, so I used all dry spices, but it was  very good and I will definitely plan on making this again.

I didn't have garam masala so I made a substitute with the allrecipies recipe for garam masala. I also used 10.6 oz of yogurt instead of 8 because I bought two 5.3 oz containers instead of a regular tub. I cooked for it 7 hours on the slow cooker. I was not impressed. The chicken was a bit overdone, the flavor was meh. It was edible, but not something I'd make again. My roommate liked it more than I did 2.5/5.

I did not make any changes. It was very good, a little spicier than I have had in some Indian buffets, but it was a great hit. It made a LOT of sauce for the chicken, so you could probably double the amount of chicken or make some rice to soak up the extra sauce.

First Indian dish I have made, and has now become my favorite! Substituted Jalapeno pepper for 2 Serrano peppers. Adds a bit more heat but is not overwhelming!

I have never had Indian food before, so I thought I would step into this recipe carefully. I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty soupy in the end. I added the heavy cream and then thickened the liquid left with 2 Tbsp cornstarch mixed with 2 Tbsp water. The end results were really good and different for us. I kept tasting the sauce mixed with the rice and saying, " I think I like this." Try it for yourself.

I’ve been trying different chicken tikka masala recipes, and this one came closest to what I remember enjoying when I visited London. The cinnamon makes it, and I added a little sugar for more sweetness. Will definitely make again and double the recipe!

This was FABULOUS!  Love that i can make a restaurant quality meal in a crock pot.  Added some garlic naan, and I was done!  The hubby says he’s not making traditional chicken tikka anymore because this was a 10 out of 10!

The curry was waaaay too watery. The recipe doesn't call of any oil? The sauce didn't come together like the authentic tikka masala I've had.

This is a good recipe and tastes amazing just as it is written. One thing though, every review on here keeps calling this Indian food... This is a British Dish, not Indian. I think it might be an adaptation of some Indian cuisine from the days of the British Empire, but this is not a real deal Indian dish. Just FYI, but it is very tasty.

Chicken was dry. But overall very good. Did add tumeric and cayenne as suggested.

It was good. I followed the original recipe and added cayenne pepper as I saw suggested by others. I also doubled the amount of chicken and figured I needed to double everything else, but that was probably a bit much. I think even with more chicken than what the recipe calls for leaving the other ingredients at the same amount or maybe just 1.5x instead of twice as much.

Turned out great- swapped yoghurt for coconut milk, added broccoli at the end, and found that it was missing something once I finished it. Surprisingly, it just needed a few globs of peanut butter. Can't wait for leftovers!

The flavor was really great, but mine came out really, REALLY watery. Not sure what went wrong there. I had to thicken mine up with some corn starch.

Like other reviewers, my sauce was very thin.  I had to add a few tablespoons of cornstarch at the end to thicken it up.  I also added some extra MDH spices that I had.

Good flavor in this spice mix. Chicken breast got quite tender in this acidic sauce, though I missed the browned/grilled flavor from more authentic (time-consuming) versions.
I skipped the cilantro because I hate it, and used whole milk because I was out of cream. I wouldn't recommend skipping the cream. I had to add butter to get the balance right.

This dish was very easy to prep, but I followed the recipe and it came out very bland and extra soupy.  From the way it smelled, I expected a lot more flavor.b  I won't be trying this again - I made a slow cooker butter chicken recipe last week that was absolutely amazing!!  If you're craving Indian and wanting a slow cooker recipe, I suggest searching for that one...

Made this for the first time and it was delicious. A couple of tips, we cut the chicken thin and used a meat tenderizer (to pound)and this greatly reduced the cooking time (ours was done in about 3 1/2 hours on low). We left out the jalapeño because we aren't spicy fans. The black pepper added enough spice for us. We added a little more salt to taste. Great recipe. My only negative would be the color, it was sort of a pinkish (flesh color) lol but we aren't serving it in a restaurant so who cares right?!?! Definitely a delicious Indian dish!

I followed the recipe except I used chicken thighs instead of breasts, reduced the jalapeño and cumin a bit and omitted the onion. It was VERY watery, like soup, and wasn't very flavorful, so I should have used all the cumin and jalapeño. I won't be making this again. I prefer the Slow Cooker Butter Chicken. It's terrific!

Very good recipe. I would definitely recommend this to any one. I added a serrano pepper in the mix as well as the jalapeño because I like the heat. In retrospect, I probably should have added habenero instead. maybe next time. anyway, it is a wonderful recipe and it taste almost exactly like it does from the restaurant. I used basmati rice and it went very well with the masala.

Added a serrano instead of a jalapeno. Flavor was great. If you want more of that garam masala flavor, then add more.

I had a hard time deciding whether to give this recipe three stars or four stars.; I opted for four to account for the fact that personal taste may be coming into play with respect to my feedback.  I followed this recipe exactly, and was looking forward to eating it based on all of the positive reviews.  To be honest, both my husband and I only found it to be so-so.  We typically LOVE Indian food and eat a lot of it, but in this case we are going to have a difficult time finishing the leftovers.  Will not be making this again.

This is my first time ever eating tikka masala. So I have nothing to compare it to, but I thought it was great and easy to make. My only complaint is, it's a little watery.

Turned out really well! This is one of the few set it and forget it dishes I know (most of our other crock pot dishes require a few check ins along the way). We will probably double most of the dry ingredients next time to ramp up the effect.

I used the easy garam masala recipe from elsewhere in Allrecipes to make this.  The older kids and I LOVED this!  The little ones thought it was too spicy so I tossed together a batch of tzatziki (recipe also from here)  to cool it down.  Even the little ones liked it then.

Very good. Both kids ate it up. One is vegetarian, so I just made sure the chicken was in large cubes and there were plenty of baby red potatoes. I'm doing low carb, so just skipped the potatoes. I did add a teaspoon of crushed red pepper.

This was very good.  My kids liked it a lot too. Followed the recipe except that  I used coconut milk in place of the heavy cream.  I will probably try the heavy cream next time as it wasn't as thick as it is when I get this in the restaurant.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

The color is off, it needs more spice, and it is too runny.  I know this is a slow-cooker version and not the real thing but maybe I will try some crushed  and reduced tomatoes, and less cream.

Very good and would do again.  Not as good as a recipe I use that is not in a slow cooker.

We eat a lot of Indian food at restaurants so I feel like I can confidently say this didn't taste like tikka masala to me. It is definitely "Indian something" though--it has the distinct Indian profile of flavors. I agree with the reviewer who said that as written, the recipe comes out too watery and not powerfully flavorful enough. In the future I will try it with half or less of the cream, and my husband made the good suggestion of adding carrots and potatoes next time. He says when he wants this again he will ask for "the Indian stew" and I think that's a pretty accurate description of what this is. We WILL be making it again though, so that's a compliment to whomever posted this recipe.

I had high expectations given the 5 star reviews. I followed the recipe and I found the spice mix too strong, it was not restaurant quality. I do appreciate the ease, so I think the recipe is worth playing with.

This was really, really good!!!! It made a huge amount of sauce so we ended up reheating the leftovers and throwing in some large shrimp. The shrimp was even better than the chicken. This has a slight heat to it, but nothing too much. Just don't forget the Naan bread!!!!

I didn't have time to slow cook so I made this on the stove top. Browned the chicken with butter. I couldn't help but compare it to our local favorite Indian /Pakistani restaurant's tikka masala, so that being said it was a little more tart than I liked (which, I usually like) so I added a dash of sugar and next time will only do half a lemon if at all. Other than those minor notes it was a really great recipe and easy. Paired it with aloo gobi and saffron basmati rice which were both easy to make. Husband thought it was good and enjoyed his dinner.

It was okay...thought it lacked spice. Made it exactly as written but in triplicate.
