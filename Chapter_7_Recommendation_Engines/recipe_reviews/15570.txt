I was expecting a peanut buttery version of a chocolate covered rice crispy treat.  So once I got over my disappointment, I realized that these are those little chocolate covered peanut butter balls my mother made at Christmas when I was a little girl.  I loved them then and I love them now!  I don't have the patience (or the time) to dip all those little balls, so I pressed the filling into a 9x13 pan and spread the chocolate over the top.  Cut into little yummy squares, they are a tasty treat!

This recipe is great, I highly recommend it. I use my hands to mix the peanut butter, crisp rice, etc...It works a lot better than a spoon, and is just as fast as a mixer, but doesn't crush the crisp rice. I just combined it and then kneaded it so to speak while still in the bowl. The warmth from your hands softens the butter without melting it all the way to create a firm but pliable dough. Also, when coating the balls, i used a spoon and a fork. I dropped a ball in the chocolate, then used a spoon to roll it around to coat, then rolled it onto the fork and lifted it out, so the excess chocolate could drain off. (Oh, and a splash of vanilla in the peanut butter mixture rounds out the flavor) This was my 6th time making these, that's just how good they go over whether you're making them for family, bake sales, etc.

love this recipe! after making it a dozen times over the years, here's the process i use.  technique tips: 1.] mix with hands as previous review suggests [that reviewer was me, i had to make a new account]...2.] use a cookie scoop to scoop balls onto a wax paper lined baking sheet and freeze for a couple hours....3.] using your hands, dip the bottoms only into the chocolate so that they're about 1/2 covered and place back on lined cookie sheet....4.] either use a fork to drizzle remaining chocolate over the tops, or pour it into a bag an snip off a tiny bit of the corner and drizzle that way.

I made this recipe for the first time at Christmas.  Everyone loved them and was wishing I had made more!  I patted the peanut butter mixture into a 9X13" pan and frosted with the chocolate mixture - easier and faster than making into balls and dipping!  Will definitely make again!

these are a major hit with my family! i followed someone's advice and pressed the peanut butter mixture into the pan and then just poured the chocolate over the top & refridgerated. then i cut them into little squares. let the chocolate soften up a little after it hardens in the fridge before you cut and then chill them again

These are great-my kids go crazy for them. Usually, I don't bother to dip them in chocolate and rolling in coconut is a nice variation, too. Great peanut butter taste and the rice crisps add interesting texture.  Chunky peanut butter is good, too.

Really good.  I only used 3 cups of conf. sugar - it seemed like it would be too dry with all 4.  Use a fork to dip the balls.

This recipe would probably not suffer if the sugar would be halved. Delicious but a lot of people complained about it being far too sweet.

Easy to make and super good!  I used gloves to hand mix the peanut butter mixture.  I placed the peanut butter balls on wax paper and placed them in the freezer for about 8 minutes to firm them up before coating them with the chocolate.  It worked really well!

The taste is wonderful, but mine turned out to be a dry, clumpy mess. I didn't do the balls, but instead took the advice to do it in a pan. I tried to cut them out and they just fell apart, I think next time I will use less sugar, and a little more butter to make sure the ingredients hold together.

These were very good.  They are rich, but satisfying.  I wanted something sweet and did not want to heat my oven.  I cut it back and made 12, that is all we needed.  I love the crunch in the PB... thanks for the recipe and thanks to Sanzoe for finding this recipe.

In our family we call these Buckeyes, My Grandmother has been making these for years- if you roll them smaller their bitesized. We keep them in the freezer- great for a quick fix or for snacking. We normally make these each fall before the Ohio State/ Michigan ( scUM) game and normally end up eating them until the next spring.

I make these at Christmas time every year.  My son can't get enough of them!  Everybody who tries these say that they are "to die for".  I brought some to work and they were DEVOURED in minutes.  Very sinful but sooooo good!

Yum. I divided the recipe in half... or else I would've eaten all 60 of them myself. I softened the butter in the microwave for 30 seconds. I added the PB and put it in the microwave again for 20 seconds. It needed help. Or I'd have been stirring it forever trying to get it to combine. I added the sugar and used my hands to combine all of that together. Finally I added the cereal and used my hands again to mix. I think it would've been very time consuming to just use a spoon.

These are awesome!! They were very easy to make and this recipe makes a LOT. The only problem was that the dough was crumbly so it was hard to roll into balls. But other than that, this is a great recipe!

So good and incredibly delicious! I have a Kitchenaid so the mixing was easy, I didn't even have to wait for the butter to soften but I can see why it would be hard without one. A keeper for sure!

Wow, sorry to everyone that enjoyed these. I made them for the first time this year and NO ONE liked them. In fact, I ended up discarding them alltogether. They were soooooo sweet...tasted like all powdered sugar.

Taste is very good, nice balance between the chocolate and peanut butter.  I used a medium ice cream scoop and should have used my small one.  Pretty easy to make.

I've made these several years in a row for Christmas, and they are ALWAYS a huge hit. I'm about to make another batch for a NYE party as well! My nephew had a blast helping me squish all the ingredients together. So much fun!  The hardest part is getting the butter balls dipped in chocolate. Putting a few on a skewer and pouring the chocolate over worked well, was faster, and resulted in less wasted chocolate. I'm going to try pressing out the peanut butter mixture, cutting it into squares, then placing them on a cooling rack and pouring the chocolate over. Fingers crossed!

These are so good. I douse the entire ball in chocolate, unless I need to distinguish it from other round, chocolate covered cookies (such as coconut) at holiday time.

Dipping the cookies/candies in chocolate wasn't labor-intensive at all!  My 4-yr-old had a blast rolling the balls and my 3-yr-old got to lick the extra chocolate off the spatula.  Great kids recipie!

Well, this is a very good recipe. Easy to make, etc.  I think next time I will leave out the rice crispies though.  I only used 3 c. powdered sugar as well..4 would have been WAY too dry.

This recipe was very good.  I've never made it with rice before.  I wasn't horribly happy with the chocolate coating....make sure to keep it on LOW heat while coating or it will get quite thick and not cover all of the balls.  Everyone LOVED them!

These are soooo good.. I couldn't stop eatting them! The only thing I didn't like was after about a day in the fridge the crispies didn't set to well in the peanut butter and they didn't really get mushy but they weren't crispy.. other than that these are wonderful! Thanks for the recipe...I saved it ;)

Yummmmm! Pretty much sums it up! These are absolutly fabulous! They taste just like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups with an added light crunch! I can't wait to give them to everyone. I'm putting them in my Christmas Goody Bags! My family loves them. I had to put them in their packaging so they would stay out of them. This recipe yielded about 70 balls for me.

Great recipe!  Exactly what I was looking for. It does help to at least soften the butter, and I used an electric mixer to mix all the ingredients together.  This one is in my keeper file!

I actually want to give this 4.5 stars!
I had some problems at the beginning because i didn't realize I had to melt the butter.. LOL ... and then having to mix all the ingredients was a bit of work... however, everyone loved them and they tasted great, especially right out of the fridge.  Yummy!

My husband & I loved these!! I like the rice crispy cereal -- it adds some crunch! The peanut butter mixture seemed a little dry, but I was still able to get the balls to stick together without a problem. I keep them refrigerated to keep from melting -- and they taste excellent cold!!

I made these for the first time yesterday.  They are a HUGE hit in my house!  It was a great thing to make with the kids...they were able to help with everything! I did add only 3 cups of confectioners' sugar like someone suggested. I had no problems with the rice crispies getting soggy.  A day later and they are still crunchy!  They are the one ingredient that has everyone ask "what is that".  Also, I had no problems with the peanut butter breaking up while rolling into balls.  I did freeze them for about 20 minutes before dipping and after.  To make them a little prettier, I melted some peanut butter after I dipped them in chocolate and drizzled it over the top of them.   Soooo good!

This was a new addition to our cookie trays this year.  They we so easy!!  I didn't have any shortening so I used a couple of Tbsp. of butter instead and they were wonderful.  My husband still prefers plain old peanut butter cookies, but my daugher loves these and keeps asking for more.  I'm going to have to make more for her this weekend.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used 2 cups confectioners sugar and no shortening and this recipe was still delicious. I did this because I had made a similar recipe which called for 3 cups confec. sugar and as I recall, it was way too much.

I also was in a rush and just poured it into a pan and covered it with chocolate.

Holy Moose this recipe is delicious, (and very dangerous for all of you who live in a household and are the only one who eats sweets ;)!

I read the reviews on this recipe and I have to tell you that mine turned out wonderful. I did only use the 3 cups of sugar added some vanilla, the mess was no problem I figure it only take about 30 seconds to wash my hands anyway, also anything that has to do with peanutbutter and your hands touching it is gonna be messy. I gave five stars i loved it and so did the whole office. Thank you for this recipe

I have made this recipe for years...I use chunky peanut butter roll the balls and insert a toothpick and put on a cookie sheet and freeze. When ready to coat add a 1" piece of canning wax to the chocolate when dry remove the toothpick and there is no need to keep in the refrigerator

If I could have given this recipe 2 1/2 stars I would have. I followed the directions exactly and I came out with a clumpy mess. After mixing the butter, sugar and peanut butter together, the mixture was so thick that the rice crispies wouldn't stick to it, so as I rolled the balls, most fell apart. Then the rest fell apart as I tried to dip them in the chocolate. I'm not sure what went wrong, but I ended up with a bunch of little pieces instead of rolled balls. They do taste ok, which is why I'm giving them two stars... but there has to be a better recipe. Anyone that goes ahead on the recipe, I suggest trying three cups of sugar instead of four, or to press the mixture into a pan and make bars out of it.

Ideally these would be 4.5 stars...these are a 5 star recipe but time consuming to mix the peanut butter, sugar and rice crispy cereal
