Oh my GOODNESS!!! Chef John you have outdone yourself again. Hands down the BEST meatloaf I have EVER made or EVER had. Buffalo. Bacon. Mushrooms. Tons of veggies within. Over the top amazing.  Never again will my meatloaf be plain and lifeless.  Instead, it will be the family's most requested meal.

I omitted butter. It seemed like an overkill. I subbed zucchini for mushrooms. I used less bacon on top, as I felt like 7 slices was also an overkill. Family loved it.

Outstanding!   Rave reviews from guests, with requests for the recipe.    Chef John's expertise isn't to be trifled with!!!   I usually follow his recipes without modification.    Once again, this was the wise choice.   No substitutions, no deletions, no additions.     I added the optional glaze and think it really added to the dish.     I trust my butcher and after reviewing this recipe, he suggested that I use 90% lean bison, instead of 85% lean.  This is an expensive ground meat, as compared to beef, but I think the expense is worthwhile, if one's budget allows.

Yes, I will make this again. I had omitted the mushrooms due to personal choice and I did not have any peppers on hand. It was still quite good! I did use only beef hamburger. I would like to broil the outside to help get the bacon crispy the next time I make this. Thanks for the great recipe!

I had to change a few things, I had three pounds of meet instead of two and I had to chop all the veggies instead of using a food processor since mine is a tiny.  I think it turned out pretty good anyway.  The wrapped bacon looks beautiful and tastes amazing too. I did use the glaze and it helps the bacon get a more even brown golden color besides tasting delicious.  Make sure that your meatloaf is not touching any of the pan walls because the bacon will not brown or get crispy.  Mine was barely touching it from the ends and those sections the bacon stayed soft, (I hate soft bacon) also be aware that the bacon you tuck at the bottom of your meatloaf will not get crispy either.
