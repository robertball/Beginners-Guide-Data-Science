As it was written, and based on the only review, I could tell this would be  a little bland. During cooking (I used a pot instead of a pressure cooker), I added salt, red peppers, lots of extra lime zest and lime juice, and cilantro (which was pictured but not included in the recipe). I also substituted the water for chicken bone stock. After all that, it was delicious! Sometimes all you need are good bones, and this recipe has good bones.

Not a lot of flavor as I used light coconut milk. Added salt and more lime at the end. Made it in cuisinart electric pressure cooker for 4 minutes.
