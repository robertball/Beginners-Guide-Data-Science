The recipe as written was good, but I didn't think it was great.  For me, there was too much buttermilk flavor and not enough bacon flavor.

Followed recipe exactly, and we loved it.  First time my kids ate their veggies without being forced!

I loved this recipe.  Just the right amounts, for the three of us.  Extremely easy to adjust to your own preferences.

I think this is a good recipe if you don't have fresh white corn.  In the deep south, the recipe is traditionally made with  white corn.  You gently scrape the kernels off the cob with a knife, only going about halfway down to the cob.   Then, with the dull side of  knife press down on the cob and extract all the "milk" from the cob.   This corn milk is the traditional milk used in the recipe.  You can add some regular cream if necessary. but white corn renders a lot of liquid.   Very delicious when made this way.

This was a new taste for us.  Tasted the bacon more than the buttermilk.  I think it would be good with some bell pepper added, but enjoyable as is too!

I did make it just as the recipe said, but I didn't like it at all. My Mother in law made the best fried corn I had ever put in my mouth. I'm a yankee and I never heard of fried corn until I married my husband 44 years ago. Unfortunely She took that recipe to the grave with her 20 years ago.
