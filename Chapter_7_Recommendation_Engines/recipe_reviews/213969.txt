Really good idea-- I made this with a Rice Krispie Treat plate as well, like the other reviewer here & my mom loved it c:  I slathered my hands with butter throughout the time I spent shaping it. I made a double batch so we could have a mug AND a bunch of square Treats :)

What a cute idea!  I use to love to make rice krispies with my mom!  Of course now im 26...but I will still make these for mothers day!  I'm planning on filling them with something too, maybe tootsie rolls...my mom's favorite!
