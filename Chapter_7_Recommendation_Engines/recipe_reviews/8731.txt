I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD LOW FAT RECIPE. I MADE A COUPLE OF ADDITIONS FOR MORE FLAVOR. I USED ABOUT 6 TABLESPOONS PARMESAN CHEESE AND 1/4 CUP FAT FREE 1/2 AND 1/2 PRE-MIXED WITH A LITTLE CORN STARCH AS A THICKENER. IT CHANGED FROM 4 STARS TO 5 WITH THE ADDED INGREDIENTS. WORTH TRYING AND EVEN BETTER THE NEXT DAY!

The theory behind the recipe sounded good, so I made it when I had a girl friend coming over for dinner. Looking at it more, it seemed to have strange proportions, especially if you expect to feed 4 people with the recipe, so I sort of winged it.

I cooked the chicken, pulled it out of the pot leaving the liquid remaining, tossed in a boullion cube and about half cup each of Chardonnay and heavy cream.  I upped the vegetables considerably: 1 whole tomato (chopped), a whole head of broccoli florets (cut small to cook easier), a whole red bell pepper (julenned) and probably close to a cup of sliced mushrooms. I did leave it at just one can of hearts though. It was plenty.

Someone said this recipe was better the next day, but I wouldn't know, my tweaked version which probably should have fed 8 people or more if calculated against this recipe was demolished by 3 of us.

Excellent! I used 98% fat free/low sodium chicken broth and roasted red peppers since I didn't have any fresh on hand. I used whole wheat thin spaghetti for the pasta. Very tasty, light meal. Thank you! :)

This was a tasty, light, easy recipe. I used whatever veggies I had in the fridge that were close to the end of their life. I had peppers, mushroom, zucchini, yellow squash, and tomatoes. then I also added a jar of artichokes chopped up.  went heavy on the chicken stock to be sure to have enough "sauce" and cheese to be sure their was flavor.  I loved it!!! So did my husband.  It would be great with shrimp too.  Try it with whatever veggies you have on hand - great base to be creative! My picky 3 year old also enjoyed it and didn't realize their were so many veggies in there!

great base to a recipe! Added more veggies, green onion, one whole packet of mushrooms, one whole yellow bell pepper, one red bell pepper, onion, scallions, more garlic, white wine, more broth, 2 tablespoons of butter,  1/2 and 1/2, red pepper, black pepper, salt, lemon Zest, fresh basil, parsley, oregano and thyme. I also added a half a small bottle of sundried tomatoes and 1 packet of cherry tomatoes at the very end.  It was delicious!

Thought this was pretty good - even though im not a huge chicken fan. I kept  the chicken cut into really small pieces and let it slowly cook with some garlic, olive oil and a little onion.  Then I took that out, added the broth, a little heavy cream, white wine and some flour to thicken it.  Then I put everything back in the pan, added some more pepper, salt, red pepper, and let it simmer for about 10 minutes.  Really seemed to melt the flavors together.  Could not believe how low-calorie it is!

Delish!  I tweaked it a little bit (more olive oil for the chicken/garlic, whole large tomato, 1 cup of broc.) but I followed everything else.  Really looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow :)

I made it with a couple minor changes.  I omitted the red bell pepper because I don't care for it.  And I rarely measure when cooking- so, I probably put more veggies and cheese in than it called for.  It was really good.  It could easily be punched up in the flavor dept if you wanted to add seasonings.  But it was flavorful made as is.  The entire family enjoyed it.  It's a keeper.  Thanks!

Great starter recipe but I knew my husband would think it was too bland. So I added some healthy choice cream of chicken to the vegetables, and some onions and cheese. We loved it.

This was so easy and very good.  I had leftover roasted chicken breast, so I used that.  I also used frozen artichokes because that's what I had on hand.  As others suggested, I bulked up the meal with more veggies than the recipe called for and used more cheese.  It was a very satisfying and tasteful meal.  Thanks for sharing.

This dish looked promising but was very sad. No flavor.  I omitted tomatoes (with broccoli?) and added wine, basil, garlic powder.  Did not help it.

I had to feed a 300 lb. lineman, but it had to be healthy for me, so this was a great recipe! He loved it, and it was only 240 calories per serving! Tastes great!

Overall it was good, but I made a few changes.  I didn't have any mushrooms, so I omitted them.  I added shrimp and cooked it with the chicken.  Made it better, but flavor was still bland.  Also, while cooking the tomatoes and broccoli, the chicken broth wasn't enough liquid so I ended up using 1 cup instead of the 1/4 cup called for.  Not bad, just bland.

I added a bit of tomato sauce for flavor. The taste is pretty good for such low calorie. I also added more chicken broth for more sauce.

My family loved it! I didn't follow the recipe though. I added more vegetables than called for, and LOTS more parmesan cheese and olive oil. It helps if you add half and half mixed with corn starch, as said in another review. Broccoli and tomatoes especially...add more than it says. Otherwise, very good.

This was low calorie, easy, and tasted pretty good.  I omitted the mushrooms and red pepper and used more broccoli and artichokes instead because I really like those a lot.  I feel like this is a versatile recipe that you could use different kinds of vegetables for and play around with adding different spices too.

I made the above, but modified just a bit.  I added 2 small cans of chicken broth, used 2 jars of marinated artichokes and doubled all incredients except the chicken - which I cubed.  Then served over angel hair pasta.  It turned out to be an excellent dish and very filling!  Even my picky teenager ate up his entire platefull!

This recipe was great.  At the suggestion of other reviewers I added more veggies, some cream, and since my husband has never had artichokes before I substituted them with some chunks of heart of palm.  The heart of palm tastes similar to artichokes, but is a bit milder.

This recipe had virtually no sauce!  I was about to be pretty upset that I wasted my money on the ingredients until I added an Alfredo sauce to the mixture.  After that, it was great but that made it a totally different dish.  I will NEVER use this recipe again.

This dish is easy to make and is very filling considering that its low calorie. I also added onion to the garlic and chicken for extra flavor, and used extra vegetables and chicken broth after reading the other reviews. When the dish was completed i mixed it with extra parmesan cheese and it had a great taste.

This is a great low fat recipe. I love vegetables so I increased the amount of each. I also added a little bit of cream to make it a little creamier & add some more flavor. Though it was wonderful with or without the cream I'd add more vegetables.

The proportion of ingredients has to be incorrect, but the ingredients used is spot on. Very delicious. Used quinoa instead of noodles added 1T cornstarch to thicken sauce

You know, it was good.  Not amazing.  Pretty simple.  I would use more spice - in fact did add garlic and basic.  Could use more tomato or red pepper flakes.  Good for a starter - and if you don't like a lot of spice.

Excellent!  Read the other reviewers' suggestions - added more vegetables and chicken stock.  I would even add more mushrooms next time.  We also added red pepper flake for some spice and dimension.  Awesome recipe!

We did not like this at all. It was so plain, and I agree that I was upset I spent the money on all the food. I ended up throwing it away.

Not much flavor gets into the pasta. Definitely needs more vegetables and additional spices.

Light, delicious & easy. Good base recipe, works even if you don't have all ingredients.  I increased veggie amounts - used 5 cloves of garlic - 2 when cooking chicken and 3 when cooking shrooms and peppers. Used white wine instead of broth, added oregano.Served with couscous.  I've made it 3 times and it's a new keeper.  Yummy.

This was a great healthy recipe.  I increased the amounts of each vegetable, and since I forgot the chicken stock, I used some marinara.  I also added a little crushed red pepper to spice it up.  It was very tasty!  I will definitely make this again.

Overall it was ok. Good but nothing special. This recipe lacked seasoning so I ended up improvising on that part. Added quite a bit of chili powder as I usually do. The quantity of ingredients seemed very off to me. I doubled or tripled the amount of vegetables it called for, and added just a little extra pasta, cheese, and broth. I kept the amount of chicken the same. I ended up with about 6 healthy servings. I’m exited to eat the leftovers and it seems to save well. Good hot or cold.

I used shredded rotisserie chicken (shortcut) and added sauteed onion and a couple extra ounces of pasta. I also included more broccoli, mushrooms and tomatoes than the recipe called for, and I used cavatappi noodles because my kids love them! Great flavor, loads of veggies. Will make this one again.

overall, the concept was good - nice veggies, a little pasta - healthy yes, but it seemed to be missing something - like a sauce of sorts. It just seemed to "dry" almost...next time I'll have to come up with a light sauce to make with it to help get all those veggies down.

Fantastic!  I used whole wheat penne pasta, 8oz pkg fresh mushrooms,  1 cup broccoli, 7oz jar of marinated artichokes, and 1 cup chicken broth, and recommended amounts of tomato & red pepper.  I also seasoned the chicken before cooking with Assmann's chicken fanny rub.  My husband, who is a "meat & potatoes" guy had three large helpings.  Forgot to put Parmesan cheese on top & will be sure to try it that way next time.  This is definitely a keeper!!!

It was bland so I made a fettachine sauce with garlic, fresh Basil and Parmesan cheese. Poured it over the top and garnished with more parmesan cheese. Turned out really good. After my additions would rate it a 5!!

I can't believe how tasty this recipe is with such basic ingredients.  It's very forgiving, too - alter the ingredients to your taste and it's still fabulous - just don't leave out the garlic and Parmesan.  I prefer a higher veggie ratio, so I reduce the chicken and increase the veggies.  Sometimes I leave the chicken out all together.  This last time I used shrimp instead of chicken and it was even better.  I always double the recipe because I hate having half a box of pasta sitting around and the leftovers are great for my lunches at work.  In fact, I use the remaining chicken broth (since there's more than 1 cup in a can) to add to the leftovers so they aren't dry.  I like to add white wine and cream to the sauce (use evaporated milk if you're watching your fat intake).  I suggest adding the broccoli to the last 5 minutes of the cooking pasta instead of cooking it with the tomatoes where it will turn a dingy shade of green.  I also incorporate the Parmesan right into the sauce and add some extra to the top.

Great all in one dish. For the pasta I used a box of orzo. Made orzo separately, then sauteed the chicken and garlic, then added a can of chicken and wild rice soup (no water). Artichokes, 1 chopped tomato, mushrooms, 1 bell pepper. Pepper to taste, a little salt and dry basil. Let it all simmer for 10 minutes then top with shredded mozarella and stir it up. Delicious.

I agree with some of the other reviews - the proportions are WAY off on this one.  I did make a lot of modifications and it did turn out pretty well - added lots more broccoli, peppers, onions, and  olive oil/white wine to give it more flavor.  I used whole-wheat pasta and couldn't tell the difference.  Next time I make this I will be sure to do some more experimentations!

It was tasty, however a little on the bland side.
