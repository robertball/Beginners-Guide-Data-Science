I used fresh pineapple instead of the canned, wild onions instead of the red onion, and had to omit the coconut.  I cooked the quinoa and lentils up in water while I cut up the pineapple.  Great taste combinations and great visual appeal.  This is a salad that I'll serve often!

I did not care for this dish hot.  My husband liked it alot and the kids ate enough for me to know that they neither loved it or hated it.  I did like this a lot better when it was cold and that was unanimous through my house.  Despite the average rating, I will make this again but next time I will add some golden raisins.  I think that this addition could actually bring it up at least one star and maybe even up to five.  For whatever reason, despite the pineapple and pecans, this needs a contrasting flavor because it had a flat curry flavor and not enough depth.

I don't like to rate a recipe that I changed, but there doesn't seem to be any way around it.  I cooked 1/2 cup of lentils in 1c.  p/a juice/water and spices as called for.  Then added 2 c. cooked quinoa, 1/2 c sweetened coconut, 1/3 chopped pecans and about 1 c crushed pineapple.  I liked the sweet with the curry.  Tomorrow I will try it cold with leftover chicken, and the onion I forgot to add.

I really did not care for this dish- I didn't like the pineapple and the curry flavor together- I would of added mango instead of the pineapple- back beans instead of the lentils and added a lime vinegrette instead of the curry powder- I found it really hard to eat

I made this as a side dish for baked coconut shrimp.  I wish I would have put more pineapple and pecans in it.  I used garam masala powder and so it turned out pretty sweet.  Overall, its an excellent dish.  Also, I added some coconut oil before I served it and it made it that much better.

This is one of those recipes I can see making a hundred different ways, depending on what I have on hand. Today when I went to try it for the first time, I was surprised to find I had no canned pineapple. Would I let that fact stop me? Of course not! I used all water, no juice and chopped prunes for fruit. When it seemed a bit dry, I added some extra coconut, raisins and a splash of unsweetened almond milk. I love the resulting dish. Vary the nuts and the fruit and, voila, a different dish each time!

I had red quinoa and red lentils in my pantry; what to do? This fit the bill; vegan protein item that can be served hot or cold, with a salad (as pictured) or with a naan and a lassi. Even my picky husband liked it, and he has the tastebuds of a 12 year old boy. I used a veggie broth base instead  of water (no pineapple at all) and added golden raisins with the coconut, as another person suggested.

We used chick peas rather than lentils (what we had in the pantry). We also substituted broth rather than water for the quinoa. The family (toddlers included)really enjoyed! Thanks for a great recipe!
