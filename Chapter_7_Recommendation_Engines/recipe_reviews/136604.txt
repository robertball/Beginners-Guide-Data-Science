This is the first time I have ever tried something that hasn't been reviewed yet and I'm glad I did.  It was delicious.  Hubby and nanny loved it.  I did use almonds instead of hazelnuts as that is what I had on hand.  I also used more spinach as a personal preference.  The only thing I would probably change is to double the sauce as I didn't feel it made enough.  This was really good and quick which is an added bonus.  Very very tasty and will definitely be making again.  Will use hazelnuts next time though just about any type of nuts would be great.

This was really good.  I do agree with some of the other reviewers. 1.  You need to finely chop the hazelnuts (they are too big if you just use them right out of the bag). 2. Add more spinach.  3. Brown the chicken then bake in order to fully cook (mine were done on the outside but still really pink inside). The sauce is wonderful and it was a definate keeper in our house.  Thanks for the post.

Oh, the disappointment of this!! I thought for sure this would become a  classic.  The ingredients sounded  perfect -especially the prosciutto. I hardly changed a thing and thought for sure this would be a special dish I could pull out for family and friends and reign as culinary Queen.
Alas, it was not to be.  I used almonds instead of hazelnuts but that was the only change I made. I sledged and dredged my chicken (the chicken itself was quite lovely) and it turned a wonderful golden brown and I could tell it was going to be succulent and juicy. (Not easy things to say about chicken) I used a good wine and fresh mushrooms, and waited for the magic to happen. I added the cream  but the sauce hadn't reduced at the 5 minute point.  I kept simmering and about 30 minutes later, it finally had reduced enough to serve as a sauce. I served and waited for everyone to 'ooh' Instead there was a silence. 'Sour' was the comment. Husband was also surprised that it wasn't a fantastic hit, agreeing that the combination should have been outstanding.  We ended up scraping the sauce off and just eating the chicken. It didn't even pass the Wolseley test, as he just ate the bits of prosciutto out of the sauce and left everything else in his bowl. Considering the cost and effort involved, it was an absolute failure. So...not sure if I did something wrong, or perhaps our family's taste buds are off, but this was just not the dish for us!

I was looking for a recipe to pair with an 'important' bottle of chardonnay - and this was perfect.  I made the recipe as stated and it was great.  The sauce reduced nicely to a thin but creamy consistency, which kept it lighter and not too rich.  The sauce was perfectly seasoned by the prosciutto - DO NOT add more salt to this until you reduce it and taste it as most of the time you will not need more.  The hazelnut crusted chicken was some of the best chicken I have had in a long time and paired perfectly with the wine.  Thanks for a great recipe that will see lots of use with my special chardonnays!  BTW, I served the chicken and sauce with roasted asparagus and kamut linguine - yum.

Whoa! This is rich and flavorful. It's hard to go wrong with prosciutto and cream. I sliced the chicken and served it over a pasta bowl of linguine with the luscious sauce on top. Ahhhh, dreamy! Two things I will do differently next time would be to chop the nuts finer and pound the chicken thinner. The nuts being finer would allow them to coat the chicken more evenly and the chicken thinner would assure that it would be cooked through before the nuts get to brown. This is definitly a dish you can entertain with. Any guest would be lucky you did!

I usually only choose recipes that have been reviewed by a lot of viewers/cooks, but like 'bonniecrocker' I took a chance, and I'm glad I did!!

This was very easy to make and very tasty - a great medley of flavors!  My first time using prosciutto too.  The hazelnuts are a marvelous touch - don't substitute if you can help it!

Things I added: 1) Tossed pasta with parsley, olive oil, and tomatoes (over low heat on the stove) before adding sauce 2) Placed chicken in 300 degree oven to keep warm after cooking on stove.

I'll definitely double the amount of sauce next time too.

Thanks hils!!

I recently had friends over and I served this dish to them with the Gourmet Mushroom Risotto recipe from this site.  We all thought it was out of this world.  I added more spinach and prosciutto to the sauce.  I disagree that more salt should be added.  The prosciutto adds plenty to the dish.

How anyone can rank this recipe under 5 stars is beyond me.  This recipe is a 10!

There were no leftovers to my dismay, and I did brown and then bake my chicken.

Hubby said THIS IS A KEEPER!  I will probably hace to make it every week.

This is a dish you will not get tired of.

I upped the amount of spinach, and added a little garlic. If I were to make this again, I would chop up the nuts more finely - I used them straight from the bag, and they were way too chunky. Otherwise this was a really nice meal - looked pretty, and had a great combination of flavors. Thanks!

I followed this recipe to a T(except doubling the cream)! It was yummy!!! I made it with spaghetti just like other reviews recommended, it was fantastic. I had leftovers for lunch the next day and I didn't love it reheated, so enjoy it while its hot!

I made exactly as stated.  If prosciutto is used extra salt should not be necessary.  While I was cooking the sauce I kept the chicken in a warm oven.  Served with roasted asparagus and roasted tomatoes.  Delicious, will make again.

I have made this a couple of times and have a hard time cooking the breasts without burning the hazelnuts.  Next time I will brown, and the bake.  Flavor is great, and the whole family enjoys this meal.

I wasn't mad about this, but the others at the table were. So, score!

Cream and chicken can be bland, which means you've got to add lots of salt.

If I try it again I'll use soy sauce instead of milk. And more spinach leaves.

A little disappointing...I followed the recipe exactly with a little more spinach thrown in because we love it. I also added a lot of additional salt to give it some flavor (didn't really work) I served this with pasta.  I was disappointed with the chicken- just didn't taste that great to me.  The leftover pasta that had been coated with the sauce was decent as leftovers today- but this isn't something I'll make again.  Thanks for a great idea.

Wow, great recipe.  Hubby talked about how much he liked it for days and asked for it to join the "rotation." The sauce is a bit thin, but I assume this is how it is intended. The dish is flavorful and delicious. Definitely a hit in our household!

My husband isn't big on chicken, but he loved this recipe!  He kept going back for more.  It was so easy to make, and the few leftovers we had reheated nicely!  Thanks for the recipe!

Like the other reviews, I normally only make recipes that have 4-5 stars and lots of reviews. This one sounded good, so I tried it. My husband and company raved about it. Our friends wanted the recipe, so I gave them my copy. I doubled the sauce and it was very tasty. Served it with Angel Hair pasta tossed with olive oil, fresh tomatoes, garlic and basil. Yummy. I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious! I was always nervous to make a cream sauce, but this was super easy. I would agree to double the sauce. I omitted the mushrooms b/c the boyfriend doesn't like them. I used 2 huge chicken breasts and put the chicken and sauce over noodles. It fed 5 of us!

This was good with the sauce but it was the chicken itself that made the dish.  5 stars just based on the chicken itself.  I used ground almonds to coat the chicken better.  I had made extra chicken and used the extras in a salad the next day.  OMG was it good.  I would use this recipe again just for the chicken.  Thanks

This was the BEST chicken ever!  Only possible complaint is my husband found he doesn't like hazelnuts (they are a little bitter by nature), so it kind of overpowered the flavor for him.  I might try macadamia nuts next time instead.
