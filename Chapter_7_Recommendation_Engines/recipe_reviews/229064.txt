Sorry but neither my husband nor I cared for this dressing.  The flavors were so very strong.  The garlic, lemon juice and mustard were all fighting each other.  This is a personal view so maybe others will enjoy it.  Thanks for posting

I have tried it.  Cut it in half.  I had it once with anchovies and once without.  Enjoyed it both ways.  If you think that flavors may be too strong, start out with less and you can always add more to taste.  This is a very good dressing.

Very yummy, very   quick and easy. The next     day it was SUPER lemony/tangy. I   prob. added more lemon than recipe called for.... or maybe it needs a tiny bit less lemon
Highly recommended.

I didn't have regular olive oil so I used a very upscale butter olive oil. It was a bit rich. I felt it needed more salt at first so I added more but that wasn't a good idea. I remembered that usually I added honey to my caeser dressing so I added that too. I didn't add anchovy and added a LOT more parmesan than it called for.  I struggled with what I did and ended up adding 2 big scoops of Helmans mayo which helped. It turned out fine. I need to try this again with regular olive oil.

I actually loved this dressing. It's a delightful citrus focused Cesar dressing, which my family enjoyed. Because I did not make it exactly per recipe, I was hesitant to give it 5 stars. I actually did not use the lemon juice because I used a Meyers lemon balsamic vinegar and peach infused olive oil. So my thoughts were the lemon juice would be the proverbial "one peach too much for the fruit bowl."

This was a perfect dressing for the Chicken Cesar Salad I made for family. So the lemony aspect of it worked perfectly with the chicken!

Excellent!  made it as instructed but without anchovy paste as I'm the only anchovy lover here.  Will double the recipe next time and add anchovy to half for me.

Needs less lemon juice, next time cut it in half for Caesar salad. Would be OK as is with seafood salad.
