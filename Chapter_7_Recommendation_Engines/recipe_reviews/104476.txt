This is a great way to ingest you whey protein! If you are anything like me, you may have a hard time just mixing it in milk or water. I made a couple changes to this recipe using what I prefer and what I had on hand. I think the cranberry juice would be good but I only had apple juice. I also substituted the serbet for low fat vanilla yogurt. The blend of the strawberries, bannana and orange was wonderful! I couldn't taste even a hint of the whey (which I used the unflavored kind)!!!!! Thanks for the recipe, I now have a new lunch!!!

I used a frozen banana, which eliminated the need for ice cubes. I also used frozen raspberry yogurt, instead of sherbet. I made no other changes. VERY good. I enjoyed this a lot.

A healthy smoothie at it's best, my friends and I we've tried this smoothie and was hooked, I have tried other ways of making a healthy smoothie to hide the protein powder taste that I add and this smoothie is the only one that does (so far..) THANKS!!!!

There are so many different flavors in this that it's hard for me to believe that I found it kind of watery and blandish.  I gave it a second chance, using all frozen except the orange, so that I could leave out the ice cubes.  It didn't help.  Dunno...

Good, filling smoothie!  Really easy to prepare.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is use vanilla whey powder.  I used chocolate whey protein this time & the flavor was a little weird with the cranberry juice.

Loved the flavors!  I had a problem with it being too runny, but I'm going to experiment.  I used mandarin oranges in place of the orange, so that could have had something to do with the consistency problem.  At any rate, the flavors are great and I can't wait to make it again.  One of my favorite smoothy recipes from this site!  Thanks!

This smoothie is super good! It's sweet with a tang. I have always had problems with smoothies that ask for ice, though. I  think my problem is, I need to start breaking up the ice before putting it in the food processor. I ended up with smoothie all over my kitchen. Ugh! Hopefully I will remember not to make this mistake next time. Thanks so much for the recipe! The only thing I did different is add more strawberries, because I needed to use them. Kid tested, Mother approved!

This smoothie is DE-licious! However, I did use a few substitutions:

I omitted the sherbet altogether
I used unsweetened, 100% cranberry juice, and added a TBsp of agave
I froze my strawberries and banana so I could also omit the ice cubes

The consistency was perfect, and it's an extremely flavorful, without being too tart!
