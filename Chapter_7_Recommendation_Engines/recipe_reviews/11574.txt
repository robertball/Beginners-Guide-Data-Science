Not paying close enough attention to the recipe, I mistakenly threw in 2-1/2 cups of marshmallows rather than the 2 cups called for. Now I don't know if that extra half cup made these brownies better or worse, but oh my gosh these were good! After having one in order to rate this recipe, I'm ashamed to even reveal how many I had after that! These were butterscotchy and chocolatey, perfectly moist, with a funny little bumpy, crackly top--so pretty! Quick and easy to throw together, with amazing results. Individual oven temps and baking pan types can, of course, affect the baking time, but mine were perfect at 24 minutes.

These have been my favorite brownies for 18 years now! Growing up my best friends mother made these (with 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips though)and I've loved them ever since.  I now make these for my own kids who love them too.  These are very rich, moist,and flavorful with the butterscotch & marshmallow making them distinctive. (I can't fathom anyone thinking they are "hard and tasteless"!?) I have found that I need to cook them for 28 minutes or else they are slightly undercooked. (My original 18 yr. old recipe card says 20-25 minutes.)

These are really, really good. I would almost be tempted to use more butterscotch chips, but then, I really like butterscotch. But they are extremely good when made as is. I did bake them for 25 minutes instead of 20, but next time I may try the 20 first just to see how they turn out when done at that time instead. They do tend to stick to the pan, so I'd suggest making sure your pan is greased really, really well. But they're definitely worth making!

If you are looking for an elegant bar that is almost too pretty to eat, forget this one.  But if you're looking for rich, chewy, ooey, gooey, can't eat just one (or three) delight--this is the ticket!  Really fun and soooooo delicious!!!!

These were totally amazing and very much a keeper to be made again. I used 2 cups of choco chips since I didn't have any butterscotch on hand, and melted both cups with the butter on the stove instead of just melting one cup in the microwave with the butter and reserving the other. I also baked them for the full 20 minutes and at first they still seemed like they weren't quite done yet, but i'm glad I didn't bake them any longer because after cooling they turned out just right. Thank you for sharing this recipe and the recipe name fits, because they're going to disappear fast. :)

This is basically the recipe I used about 25 years ago when my kids were young, and the brownies are just as good today as they were then. The melted butter and butterscotch chips really make it rich, and the marshamallows make a nice crust and give a good chewiness. I did bake for longer than specified by this recipe.

These are excellent. I thought the flavor improved the next day. They are sweet but not too much. The marshmallows actually disappear into the dough so don't expect to see pieces of marshmallow in your brownie. The only change I made was to mix the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl and then added this to the egg mixture.

This batter was thick like candy, I wasn't sure they would turn out, but it was quite delish.  They did stick a little to the side of a non stick pan.  I would make these again!

YUM, these are decadent!  Made them for Valentine's Day for my boy's daycare and they turned out great.  I didn't have butterscotch chips, so used milk chocolate chips and semi-sweet as called for and they were great.  I would have like to have tried with peanut butter chips, but there's a peanut allergy at the daycare, so milk choc it was!  I think any type of mixture I'm sure would be fantastic!

These are really sweet.  Too sweet.   This is because of the addition of the melted butterscotch chips.   I prefer the disappearing marshmallow brownies without butterscotch chips.

Wow...really great brownies!  For me, the butterscotch chips and butter in the microwave didn't melt as smoothly as I thought they would.  I was sure I had done something wrong, but nope, these are absolutely delicious following the recipe exactly as written.  Next time, though, I will follow the suggestion of another reviewer and throw in a bit of quick cooking oats.

INSANE! These are amazing. Soft and chewy and buttery and awesome. I lined my pan with foil, and then sprayed the foil really well because they're very sticky. Once they were cool, I pulled the foil out and used a pizza cutter to slice them, way easier. Make small pieces, they are VERY rich.

Flavor considered these were very good.   I used the new vanilla flavored marshmellows and made them in a very well greased muffin tin. To address the problem with them being gooy and stickig to the pan, a tip- Line whatever you are using w/ foil and then grease the foil. Also- let them cool a bit out of the oven then put them in the freezer for and hour or so.  This firms the marsmallows that melted allowing you to cut them without it sticking to the knife.  I will make again for sure- just with a few tricks to remove them more easily.

Awesome recipe!  I did not have chocolate chips on hand but leftover peanut butter cups from Halloween.  Turned out great.  Next time I tried with butterfingers cups.  Still good, but not as tasty.  First timers, when you add mixture to pan before baking it looks wrong.  Don't stop.  Even though it looks lumpy and strange it turns out beautifully.  I have happily passed this recipe along to 4 people requesting it.   This brownie will make an appearance at my Thanksgiving  dessert table this year.  Thank you for an easy and wonderful recipe!

After baking these successfully last night, I have a few suggestions for everyone making these in order for them to turn out perfectly, as mine did:
-follow the recipe exactly
-use a glass 9x13" pan and grease it with cooking spray, thoroughly
-bake for 20-21 mins, 15 mins is NOT enough!
-bake them at night before bed and let them cool in the glass pan, partially covered, until morning.  Then cut and serve!
This is what I did for this recipe and it turned out great, chewy, sweet, and delicious.  The trick is the glass pan, cooking spray, longer cooking time, and overnight cooling.  Good luck!

I loved these brownies.  I couldn't stop eating them!  I gave them 4 stars because I think they need less sugar.  There are so many sugary ingredients I decided to use less than the brown sugar called for, and will use even less next time.  I did not measure, but did not fill the measuring cup fully.  I would go down to a 1/2 cup definitely, and perhaps even a 1/3.  I would also suggest that once you are incorporating the flour mixture into the egg mixture you add the chocolate chips and marshmallows when the flour is half way mixed.  If you wait the mixture becomes candy thick it is so hard to stir!  You have to spread this batter out in the pan, but you will be surprised how awesome it comes out of the oven.  I cooked for 20 minutes and thought this was perfect.

Thanks for the recipe!

This rating is only based on my personal opinion, everyone else that ate these loved them. For me, they werent cooking properly , crispy on the outside but not enough on the inside and were very hard to get out of the pan even after cooling for a few hours. They are very sweet, I would try making again but with only butterscotch chips or choco or peanut butter. A plus about them, is that they taste really good even after being left out for a day.

We made this and it may eventually would have turned out but the cook time must be WAY off. We took it out and it looked done and was even pulling apart from the sides of the pan and even after cooling it came out like raw cookie dough with a weird crust at the top. Only part I could eat was the very edges which is why I gave it two stars. If the whole thing turned out like the edges than it would have been a decent brownie in terms of taste. Should be called "Disappointing Marshmallow Brownies" because the smell had me pretty excited...

This recipe was a great way for me to use up a ton of stale miniature marshmallows!  Once baked, they turn gooey again in the batter (perfect!). This recipe was a hit even though i DID NOT HAVE THE BUTTERSCOTCH CHIPS. Next time, I will def. try with the butterscotch but this was still great.  It's very hard to test for doneness so I just checked to make sure they looked done.  Be careful NOT to burn the marshmallows.  The batter is very thick and chunky so spread evenly over the entire pan because it does not spread very much.

These were AMAZING! At first I wasn't sure while I was mixing it all together but the final result was delicious! The kids have raved about it since I've made it and it's almost gone already. I didn't make any changes to the recipe, definitely a keeper!

These were ok.  I didn't have miniature marshmallows, so I took big ones and cut them up into 8 pieces each.  They didn't melt even though the top and edges were all golden brown.  I usually like marshmallows, but not when I'm expecting a blondie.  The blondie to marshmallow ratio was off for me.  They look nice, and you certainly get your sugar fix here, but just not satisfying for me.

Sticky. Sweet. Delicious. Put in too many marshmallows kind of by mistake, but they were fine. I put them in front of my family, and they...well.... disappeared. Half the pan gone in one sitting!

Definitely very delicious, but not even close to being done at 20 minutes.  I baked an extra 5 or so and I think it could have used a little more then that.  They are really sweet with the melted butterscotch chips but so so good!

The taste of these brownies were average - good.  The amount of guess work it took to decide if they were baked enough was extremely frustrating.  Finally got the bronwies cooked enough, cooled them off...and cutting them was a disaster.  I ended up throwing most of them out.

Taste great...look terrible. But the taste makes up for the lake in the looks department! I'm really curious to try these with peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch...

the taste was great but they were VERY hard.  I was a little disappointed they were flat and more like a candy bar than brownies.

As far as blonde brownies go, these were pretty good.  I was saddened that the marshmallows disappear when baking, thinking there would be chunks, and didn't really think they added anything to the recipe. I did like the butterscotch chip flavor in the batter itself, I'd be tempted to add another 1/2 c to see what that does. Grease your pan very thoroughly, as mine still stuck a little and I coated it.  They cooked for about 22 minutes, and where no where near done at 15.  My husband and I both preferred these cold.

I loved the taste of these.  They did need to bake for a bit longer than the recipe.  Followed the recipe exactly except for the baking time.  Delicious.

These were delicious! I made them for a bake sale and they sold out. I only have two comments which I help will be helpful to other bakers. First, althought the brownies may not appear done after 15 min, TAKE THEM OUT! They continue to cook in the pan and taking them out at this point will ensure that they stay moist and chewy. Secondly, these bars are very sweet, so unless you have a serious sweet tooth don't eat too many although they are addictive. Enjoy!

I didn't have any butterscotch chips, so used peanut butter chips instead. I definitely would not bake any longer than 20 minutes, they were cooked just enough, any more & they would have been burnt. Pretty good, but more of a bar than a brownie.

I cooked this for ten minutes over the stated recipe time, and it still did not set at all.  I don't know if is because I am located in Denver (the high altitude) or if it was just the recipe.  Will not make this again.

Really good!!  I couldn't wait to get these out of the oven because they smelled so good!  While they tasted good warm, they tasted even better the next day when they were completely cooled.  They were a little messy warm as well, but cut nicely the next day. Very rich, so a glass of milk is a must!

Would have given 3 stars but I used a mixture of peanut butter/chocolate chips instead of the butterscotch beacause that is what I had on hand- I wanted to be fair.  They were just average.  Maybe the butterscotch makes all the difference but with all the delicious brownie/bar recipes out there I will not make these again.  Too bad- I love anyting with marshmallow but these really weren't very marshmallow-y anyway.

I wasn't happy with the end result of these brownies. Although they tasted good. They really didn't raise and were more like a cookie bar than a brownie.  I made the recipe on two different occasions and got the same result following the recipe exactly as shown.

These are the best brownies I've ever tasted in my life, hands down.  My husband and kids said the same  but I was in utter amazement at how delicious they are.  Next time I'll bake for 25 minutes instead of 20, but they were still absolutely DELICIOUS.  I am not usually a big fan of brownies, but I will be making these again and again.  Easily 5 stars.

I was not impressed.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The texture is good, but the flavor is so subtle.  Maybe if you spread chocolate icing on top or perhaps added some cocoa and extra sugar to the mix?  I will not be making these again.

These are very good and I would remake them. I just was unsure if they were completely cooked. I left them in the oven longer than the recipe called for and the bottoms stayed doughy while the tops were completely done. I reserve five star ratings for recipes that are ones that I eat and eat and eat until I can't anymore.

These set up kinda weird, not really like brownies. Great with a scoop of ice cream. The butterscotch/butter mixture made for a wonderful gooey inside while the marshmallows added a slight crunchiness which was very nice. I will definitely make these again. Thanks for a different dessert recipe!!! UPDATE: these brownies are DIVINE the second day!!!

Yummy recipe! I made these for my little sisters birthday today.  These blond brownies are perfectly ooey & gooey. I was scared that they were gonna be hard, but they stayed gooey & soft. I baked the brownies by mistake at 325 degrees for about 25-30 minutes & they came out soo good. the Marshmallows on the top didn't disappear all the way which made the brownies chewy & sweet. Love the recipe & my sister did too!

I cannot begin to describe the awesomeness of these brownies.  My only comment would be that I don't think I'd call them a "brownie."  More of a cookie bar.  Make this dessert - your friends, family and co-workers will thank you!

I consider myself a brownie lover and these were not disappointing. I do think the name "brownie" is misleading, and I would call this a blondie. But the flavor is sweet and salty and the texture is gooey. Delicious!

I think these are way too sweet--and I usually like sweet.  Also, I would bake them 10 or 15 minutes longer.  However, they were a hit at work, so I am adding one more star...

I could not get these to firm up and I was afraid of over baking.  Taste as very rich, yet gooey.  Not our cup of tea

I'd give it 3, but the family really loved them so it gets a 4.  I added 1/4 cup of cinnamon chips too.

These were pretty good. I didn't have butterscotch chips so I just used extra semi-sweet chocolate chips. I'm sure it would be very tasty with the butterscotch. As mentioned, these are not good warm. I popped mine in the fridge after they cooled a little and tried them chilled. Very good. Will try again with butterscotch chips!

I made these w/ my grandsons & they were fabulous. My youngest grandson said they are the best brownies he's ever eaten. (of course everything we make is the best he's ever eaten  ;o)   ) But even my non-butterscotch loving husband loved these. I cooked them for the full 20 minutes & think they could have used 5 more. I only had a cup of miniature marshmallows (they really do disappear) & they still turned out allright.

Delicious brownies, especially hot out of the oven when the marshmallows are soft.  I made both versions of this recipe on this web site, and this is definitely the better of the two.  I will make these again!

Only if I could find some Butterschotch chips without Hydrogenated Oil, I used white chocolate chips instead with remarkable results.  These brownies do disappear quite fast...

Very good, but VERY sweet (which you'd expect given the ingredients) - a bit too sweet for my taste. If you like things gooey-sweet, this is your recipe!

Gosh these brownies are heavenly! The only thing I have qualms with is the amount of sugary ingredients. I added less of what was called for for the marshmallows and chocolate chips and it is still really sweet, but good nonetheless!

Gooey & delicious. Used 1/3 cup butter + 2 TBSP applesauce instead of 1/2 cup butter for fewer calories. Next time, try 1/4 cup butter + 1/4 applesauce. Cooked for 24 min.

To be honest, it may have been my cooking but i followed this recipe exactly and it turned out sort of flavorless and more cake like then chewy, I feel like if I increased the vanilla or possibly the brown sugar i would be more impressed, also I would prefer it more moist and chewy does anybody know how I could get that texture. id would appreciate the input.

Holy cow, these are gooooood!  My husband LOVED them.  I made them for church and left him a few samples.  After taking one bite, he wanted his own pan... Hahaha!!  One thing though, I've made these twice and I cannot get the butterscotch chips and butter to blend once melted.  It becomes a separated, gooey mess.  I guess this is normal? because it still turns out awesome!

Don't get me wrong, these taste great, but they don't keep there bar shape.  Really must be eaten with a fork, not just grab and go.  I may cook these longer next time, went with the minimum time as to not over cook them.

Very good. I had to get my butterscotch blazing hot to completely melt, so unfortunately my chocolate chips melted when I stirred them in later. So I couldn't really taste the butterscotch, but oh well, they were nice and chewy and yummy! Had to bake for 25 minutes, at 20 the middle was still jiggly.

This made a good dessert.  Like many others have said, these are more of a bar than a brownie.  Even thought they are good, they arent as moist and fluffy as a brownie.  I read others reviews about cooking a little longer then stated.  So I cooked mine a little longer.  I wish I wouldnt of because it made them overdone.  So next time I will definitely use the recipes cook time.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will make again sometime.

Using the recipe provided my baking went smoothly but the outcome was a little bland, though pretty. The marshmallows crusted the top with a nice brown and made the 'brownies' light an fluffy but I could barely taste the butterscotch. I use alot of store brands and maybe that was the problem but everyone elses reviews seemed so good I'll prolly try again :)

People loved these at the picnic I brought them to.  I baked them for 23 minutes hoping they would not be over-cooked & they turned out runny in the middle.  They were still good, but not quite the texture I was looking for.

Good but very sweet, and gooey.  Cooked about 10 min longer, as per some other reviewers, but it still did not set well, so I cooked 10 min longer.  Not sure if I'll be making this again.

These brownies are great. They did disappear, and everyone was commenting about how "gooey" they were, but in a good way. I just would put a little more marshmallow in it! That's all!

Now I truly understand the importance of following the directions. Now I know this is a important life lesson but I guess you can tell I've always had problems with it.  It looks pretty but I guess in my case looks can be decieving. It took me 25 minutes in the oven and when it came out it was dry and plain, not really on that level that you don't feel an ounce of guilt of all the calories you're comsuming becuase it's just so  good! But it my dad enjoyed them so don't feel to bad.  Now about that life lesson, I figured out what my problem was (not yours!) I skipped the butterscotch chips and added chocolate sauce instead, to bad now I guess I'm going to have to go back to box mix brownies because of this failure.

Very sweet, but my kids loved them.  They did ask: hey, where did all the marshmallows go? Then I told them the name of the recipe.  This recipe is simple to put together and kids love them.  Thanks!

These are good, and definitely have a different flavor, but if you are looking for a great simple blonde brownie, try Blonde Brownies I by Sue Bush, here on allrecipes.  Best Blondies I've ever made.

I have made these twice in two days! I made them with pb cjips cause I did not have butterscotch chips. Then I made them with mint chips. WOW amazing stuff! You can really use whatever kind of chips. will continue to do so. I also had no marshmellows, so I used fluff. GOOD STUFF!!!! thanks for the recipe!

I really, really love these brownies. I bake them in a 7'' x 11'' pan for 30 minutes and press the marshmallos into the top of the batter. They get all toasted and it makes the brownies extra yummy!

Two 11x13 pans of these can make 4 dozen cookies. I made them for church and they were all gone quite quickly. People seemed very enthused about them. They are a good thing to make the night before and then serve. They seem to benefit from sitting overnight.

These are absolutely delicious!  I was a little worried when I made the batter, because it seemed so thick, and I was afraid that cutting down the butterscotch chips by 1/3 c had adversely affected it, but they turned out just fine.  I actually found my marshmallows stayed identifiable, unlike what other reviewers mentioned, but didn't mind at all.  The only thing I had problems with was that the batter didn't lie very flat, so they came out a bit lumpy and bumpy.  But otherwise, this rich, sweet blondie that goes just perfect with a big glass of milk will disappear in no time in my residence.

Yum!  I was looking for a chewy blondie and these definitely fit the bill!  I baked them for about 23 minutes and they turned out great.  I can't wait to try different combinations with peanut butter or caramel chips!

This was very easy to make and pretty popular with the goup. I thought the flavor was good, but not exceptional so only giving it 4 stars instead of 5. A good recipe to have on hand for something quick and sweet.

These are a favourite in my house, first made for our son by request for his 18th birthday, instead of cake. I've made them for various parties, events, and holidays ever since. These are ALWAYS requested, especially by children and young adults -- it's so sweet!

You need to add at least 5 min. to the bake time, watching carefully. If you bake too long, the marshmallows disintegrate entirely.  I also use 1.5 times the marshmallows and 1.5 times the chocolate chips. 

Lastly,  don't worry too much if your melted butter and chocolate chips look a bit grainy or the oil separates. This is from melting on too high heat. Once everything is incorporated, the finished product will still turn out nicely.

These were ok, but not great. I found them way too sweet (and I love sweets!). I baked them the full 20 minutes, but think they needed longer, as my marshmallows didn't fully "disappear".

My parents were amazing and they sent me some chocolate chips down to Bolivia. I had them sitting in my pantry, waiting to use them for something special. I decided to break open a bag (he sent 2) and make these brownies. Obviously since there are no chocolate chips here in Bolivia, I also had no butterscotch chips, so I make it with all chocolate. I also took the advice of others and I used extra marshmallows. No minis down here, so I chopped up some of the large ones (I found a random bag down here and bought it for a special occasion too!). I at least doubled the marshmallows. I know that sounds extreme, but really it was worth it in the end. These brownies did not stick around very long between me, the wife, and 2 little girls!

These are certainly easy to put together.  The marshmellows just melted into the batter and the "lumps" on the top were very crumbley (not sure if that is a real word!).  I thought they tasted better after a day or two.  I took most of the pan to work and they disappeared quickly.

I did like the flavor that melting butterscotch chips w/ the butter gave to these brownies but the marshmallows left a weird, hollow, crunchy shell on top that crumbled when cut (which wasn't pretty). I also had to bake mine for 27 minutes because at 20 minutes they still weren't cooked through. If I made these again (I don't think I will though) id use marshmallow cream instead of marshmallows to see if that eliminates the hollow marshmallow shells on top.

I could've eaten all the raw dough... OMGoodness this was delish! I loved the perfectly chewiness and gooeyness of these little devils! I ran out of chocolate chips so I chopped a block of bittersweet chocolate that I did have. I liked it and my non-chocolate-fan-of-a-boyfriend will prefer it that way... but I think I missed the extra melty goodness more chocolate would've had. But DARN good. Wow... =)

Make sure you pack the brown sugar because I don't think I packed mine and it was not sweet enough for me. To remedy this I drizzled caramel syrup on top. Yum! I added 2.5 c of mini marshmallows like a reviewer suggested and I'm glad I did because they melt right in to where you can barely taste them. If I made these again, I will either add a cup of peanut butter chips or white choc chips to liven it up.

Super yummy, sweet and rich!  I followed the recipe exactly and couldn't even think of anything to change lol.  Well, my son did say that they were 'salty' - so I might reduce the salt next time, or omit it completely - but truly - these were WONDERFUL!  I baked them in an oversized muffin pan for large, individual servings - and they turned out sooooo pretty :o)  A little vanilla ice cream on top never hurts either!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were awesome!! Sent them to my boyfriend overseas and the troops ate them up...and since they are so moist and chewy...they lasted the 6 day trip in a ziplock and he said they were still delicious!I baked these right at 20 minutes and I ended up cutting the edges off (I don't like the edges anyways!) so next time I will do 18 and I think they will be perfect!

This is my favorite recipe.  The family LOVE them and I always take them for potlucks.  Very sweet, though, and I wonder if I should try to cut down the sugar, but not sure how.

I had more or less the same problems as stated by other cooks: the batter was hard and lumpy, I was worried of the final result, I had no butterscotch chips, they tried to stick to the pan (I had lined it with oven paper so no sticky pan for me, but still, you can see they are sticky...). But I'll sure make them again, I couldn't let them alone still hot from the oven! they are a TREAT really; can't wait to try with white chocolate chips!

The only change I made was to use white chocolate chips instead of butterscotch chips, because I didn't have any. They turned out so delicious, and chewy perfect texture! A big hit at the family gathering!! Thanks so much for this great recipe!

I made this exactly as specified. The batter is quite thick and once you mix in the chocolate chips and marshmallows I could hardly stir it and had to force it to the edges of the pan. It came out excellent though, and I cooked it for 24 minutes. It definitely needs to cool before you cut/eat as it falls apart if too warm.

I didn't have any butterscotch chips. I thought about using butterscotch pudding, but in the end I skipped it. I added the margarine to the brown sugar and went from there. I added about an 1/8 cup of unsweetened, shredded coconut. My brownies were done at 25 minutes. I got a light, fluffy, cake like brownie. It wasn't too rich either. Just right. I would make these again.

These brownies are amazing.  I read many of the reviews and my 7 year old son and I decided to make them last night.  I could barely wait for them to cool.  I tried a little before going to bed.  God help me, I'm going to take them to my sisters because they can't stay here.  These brownies are soooo amazing. I did decide to add chopped pecans to one side, because my son doesn't like them.  The pecans just added a little crunch.  This is by far the best recipe that I've ever gotten from allrecipes!!!

I love these.  I was so happy to find this recipe after losing my own!  I don't make any changes.  One thing to note:  I have made these so many times I've lost count.  But...the pan you use really makes a difference (insulated, glass, etc.) After breaking my glass pan, I made them in an insulated.  I used the same cooking time as always, but they were under-baked because of this, and they never set up.  Then I got a new glass pan.  I remembered that they didn't set last time, so I added 7 minutes on to the cooking time.  This time...they hardened to a rock I couldn't cut.  Bottom line - too little time is better than too much - because the gooey ones will be fine with ice cream.  Don't be put off by the 'hard' reviews - they were just overcooked!!

These are wonderful!  I made a whole batch but put it in a 9x9 pan so they were a little thicker. These brownies never make it out of my house... my co-workers hate me for it!

The teens I made these for proclaimed them "the best thing they had ever eaten". I thought they were quite good, too, though very sweet. They were quick and easy and would be very nice on an assorted cookie/bar plate.

I made this last night for my daughter and her family.  My daughter liked it but it just wasn't a favorite of mine.  I don't think I would use this recipe again.  It is just not "my taste" in a brownie.  I thought it would be good for a change from the traditional brownie, but this one just didn't make it for me.

These are amazing. My friend ruined(almost) mine by changing my oven temp to 500 instead of setting the timer for 5 minutes for me, but even though the top was burnt black and the inside bars were not cooked through the family devoured them and we will definitely make them again! Update: I made these again and they are even more fabulous when cooked correctly!!!

I baked these for 15 minutes longer than directed and they still didn't set up in the pan. The flavor is VERY sweet, but their messy gooiness will keep me from making them again.

These were tasty- but a little too sweet for my taste. I though that the butterscotch chips were overpowering so next time, I'd half the butterscotch and up the semi-sweet chips.

Decent, but nothing to write home about. They took 40 minutes to cook, and I swear there are bits inside that still seem a little raw, even hours later after cooling. I don't think I'll make these again, though they aren't necessarily bad. I will continue trying to find a perfect blondie recipe.

these are SO GOOD! I cut the recipe in half and baked in an 8" pan. I baked them for about 13 minutes and they were browning on the edges, but still seemed gooey in the middle. Iread some others had problems with them being hard once cooled, so I took them out and waited to see what would happen. Once cooled they were still really soft-we ate them with a fork. I put them in the fridge hoping this would help and when I checked not even an hour later they were perfect. Everyone loved them, they were gone the same day I made them-that's saying a lot around here. Some people said theirs stuck to the pan so I lined my pan with foil and sprayed the foil with non stick spray and that worked great.

So addictive! These were absolutely wonderful!  The only thing I did differently was to use all butterscotch chips and bake exactly 22 minutes.  They are easier to cut when totally cooled but who can wait that long??  Thank you for a definite KEEPER recipe!

These brownies are a yummy, nice change from the standard chocolate brownie I normally bake.  The marshmallows melt into the dough and make them nice and fluffy! I'm not a huge fan of butterscotch, so I think next time I will double up on the choclate chips, melting only some with the butter so there are still some actual 'chips' in the brownie.  YUM!

Loved these!!! I'm not a fan of making brownies and often just go wth the boxed mix, but these were so easy & delicious. Would love to try them again using something other than the choclate chips, maybe peanut butter or white chocolate. Definitelt a great recipe.

The flavour of these brownies is wonderful. I cooked them for about 18 minutes and it was definately not enough. (very hard to tell as the toothpick method does not work due to the gooey marshmallows, chocolate and butterscotch). I will add a little more flour and cook them for atleast 20-23 minutes the next time I make these and I will make them again! They are very good and VERY rich! Thanks

We've used this recipe in the family for at least 20 years, from a Pillsbury bake-off contest.  Takes every measuring cup in the set.  The original is assembled in a heavy pot on the stove.

I made these on a whim and brought them into my workplace... they did indeed disappear! Super easy to make - and even the raw batter was delicious. I baked for ~18 minutes and they were still nice and gooey.

Mouthwatering!!!! These brownies are light yet rich though still remain not too overpowering. You can definitely have more than one! These disappeared so fast at a family get-together. I will for sure make these again and again.

These are SO rich but they are SO good!!!  I’m not a big butterscotch fan but before I knew it, I had eaten an entire row.  I forgot to set a timer but they baked somewhere between 18 and 23 minutes.  I took them out when the marshmallows were making a bubbly crust on the edges.  Those edges were my favorite, as well as my 8 year old daughter’s favorite, which is strange because she always wants inside pieces.  I melted my butterscotch chips and butter (real butter, not margarine) in a double boiler and it took forever and looked incredibly unappetizing, until suddenly it came together.  I made this recipe again today for a bake sale and used fresh butterscotch chips and melted the butter entirely first before adding the chips, and it went faster and melted more smoothly.  I added an extra cup of chocolate chips the first time and just an extra half cup the second time.  I like to add chips until it looks right.

I make these pretty often and the entire pan is usually gone in less than 24 hours. I brought these to church once for a potluck and everyone was commenting about them, and I mean everyone. I had at least 4 people ask me for the recipe and one person asked if they could take the leftovers home (I made several batches). To say they were a big hit would be a huge understatement. Everyone LOVED these

This is an excellent brownie recipe.  You've got to watch those chips in the microwave though.  It's really easy to get them too hot and then they'll never mix into a "smooth" texture which will ruin the brownies in a hurry.  I like these best with dark chocolate chips instead of semi sweet.

This is my favorite bar to make lately, I've made it many many times.  The cook time listed, 15 to 20 minutes, is not enough in a glass pan.  It's more like 20 minutes.

I made it once using the butterscotch chips, and it was a hit at a gathering, but my family doesn't like butterscotch, so I tried it again with white chocolate chips in place of the butterscotch, and we liked it a lot more.  The marshmallows really have a great effect on the taste/texture, and they are super easy to make!  I did cook them for about 25 minutes.

These are so amazing!  I left out the butterscotch but they were still great.  Everyone loved them!  They fall apart when they're fresh out of the oven so be careful...and patient.

I was tempted to leave out the butterscotch chip like some reviewers, but they are pretty important to this recipe, so I instead decreased the brown sugar to 1/3c.  You'll get a good workout mixing the chocolate and marshmallow into the batter.  I accidentally used the wrong size pan, but that didn't turn out to bad except for that the edge pieces ended up less chewy.  All in all, it's a good recipe.

The feature I love the most with Allrecipes, is the ingredient search...it freaking rocks! I put in butterscotch chips & marshmallows and happened upon this recipe. They are so delicious! I had to make a few modifications as I only had regular size and jumbo size marshmallows (20 regular = 2 cups mini). I also used unsalted butter, dark brown sugar and mini chocolate chips; as it wasn't specified within the recipe and baked them for the full 20 minutes. They turned out so well, I made them twice in one week! Next time I may lessen the amount of sugar and leave out a 1/2 cup marshmallows to later sprinkle on top after removing them from the oven. Thank you Maryl for this great recipe, can't wait to make this again!

WOW! These are awesome!  Made them exactly as written.  A very well butter-greased glass pan and cooling overnight (lightly covered) makes them not stick at all to the pan.  I made them for a party last night but keep trying "samples" because they are so good.  I hope there are enough for my guests now! ha!  These have just become my favorite brownie!

Loved them!  I baked mine for 18 minutes and would recommend baking them for longer (and I like my brownies a little under done). Marshmallows sort of melted into the brownies, but still provided a little gooey-ness to the top.  Am going to try replacing the butterscotch chips with peanut butter chips next time--and there will be a next time!!

I have to agree with a lot of the negative reviews on this one.  It didn't set for me and was an overly sweet mess.  It was especially disappointing because I thought this was the recipe I used last time (guess not) and was meant for a friend of mine.  Needless to say it was a waste of ingredients because it was so un-presentable I had to make another one with a different recipe.

I just baked these yummy bites and they were delish!  I followed the advice of baking it in a glass container and generously greased it for easy serving.  I added 2 cups of milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet as others suggested and baked it for 27 minutes to make sure it was cooked all the way through.  I will definitely bring these treats again for family and friends to enjoy.

These were delicious! I didn't have any mini marshmallows so I put a few large ones in the microwave for about 30 seconds and then mixed them into the batter and it tasted great! I forgot to cover them up overnight so the next day they were VERY hard. Make sure to cover them up! If you do forget like I did, though, just pop one in the microwave for a few seconds before eating. That does a good job of softening it up so you don't have to throw away an entire pan of brownies!

RIDICULOUS!  Seriously.  I teach Foods & Nutrition at a high school and I had a few groups make these for a sophomore leadership academy meeting.  The visiting students used words like "insane, super good, delicious, amazing, and Wow"  I had a little trouble knowing if they were actually done because they were so gooey but went by the standby rule of the edges pulling away from the sides of the pan.  It's always a good sign when high school students ask for the recipe.

We are not big on sweet but when I came across this recipe I knew we had to try it.  I made it for our weekly game night with our friends.  Everyone loved it!  I left the salt out on accident, but I don't think that it hurt the recipe at least we couldn't tell.  I also think the cooking time should be changed to 25-30 minutes.. I checked the brownies after 15 minutes and then ended up cooking them 10+ minutes more.  Even so these were delicious and we will make them again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good....I have made twice and both times they were gone very quickly. Very easu recipe, there is a bit of a baking soda taste when they are warm but goes away after they have cooled. I add 1/2 cup extra chocolate chips and 1/2 extra marshmallows. Try this recipe, you will be glad you did.

We really enjoyed these! It took a while to melt the butterscotch in the microwave, but be sure to melt them all the way.  I read that the marshmallows 'disappear' and you can't see them - when I made them, you can see them.  When you first take them out of the oven, it looks like a big marshmallow puff.  When you let it cool, they sort of melt into the brownies.  I thought these were awesome and my husband and I ate them in 4 days!  The entire pan!  :)

Pretty good, I prefer the traditional brownie, but this was a nice change.  Great for people that don't like chocolate (can you believe there are such people. ha ha)

I baked my batch of brownies for almost half an hour and was worried because they still didn't seem done.  Once they completely cooled, they firmed up nicely.  Great taste!

This recipe is absolutely amazing!!  I will never make a "box" brownie again!  I didn't have any butterscotch chips so I used all semi-sweet and they were wonderful.  Gonna try them with peanut butter chips and with mint chips too.  Expect them to be just as good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy! This was so chewy and gooey, and I loved it! I didn't have any sort of chips on hand, so I used dark chocolate broken up into pieces. After reading the reviews, I reduced the amount of sugar (used white) and upped the amount of marshmallows. Will definitely make again.

Great texture and flavor! They are extremely sweet though. I doubled the salt to balance out the sweetness. They still turned out super sweet and they weren't too salty. If you like sweets these are awesome!

Hmm...I have mixed feelings about these brownies. I was really excited because I love butterscotch, and the marshmallow part sounded interesting...these had an okay flavor, but no one in our family really cared for them too much. The marshmallows did not 'mix in' like some people said it did for them...they left a strange marshmallow 'shell' on top of the brownies, and when I bit into it, expecting an actual marshmallow- it was just a browned 'shell' where the marshmallow had been. That was kind of weird...and because of it, they didn't exactly LOOK very appealing. But, overall- they were just okay. I probably won't make them again.

SO GOOD! I just made these using white chocolate chips instead of the semisweet chips. They are amazing. The melted butterscotch makes them incredible. I can't wait to eat the rest!

these were OK. I made with all chocolate rather than butterscotch chips. They were sort of grainy in texture, not sure why. ALso, I'm not sure what the marshmellows added, I couldn't really taste them.

yum!  easy to make and not too butterscotch-y!  My son hates butterscotch but loved these!  so, if you are not  a fan, don't let that scare you off!  These were delightfully chewy and gooey!  yum!  10 stars would be more appropriate than 5!

They were easy to make but I didn't find them to be very outstanding. I didn't have butterscotch chips so I just used chocolate chips. Maybe that's the reason they didn't taste nearly as good as expected. Also the marshmellows melted completely and I was expecting them to remain more in tact.

These brownies were so yummy!!!  I couldn't find butterscotch chips at the store, so I melted the chocolate chips with the butter instead and skipped the butterscotch.  I took them out after 20 minutes, even though they still looked a bit gooey, but I'm glad I did.  They melted in your mouth and were so moist.  I'll definitely be trying this again when I find some butterscotch chips!

My son has taken to making these and decided to "reverse" chips in the recipe - same amounts, just chocolate melted first, then butterscotch added just before baking.  Wow - they are great both ways!

These were fantastic. I followed the directions exactly. I baked mine for 20 min. Very soft and chewy. Not an overwhelming butterscotch taste. Just right. I also took the suggestion of drizzling chocolate on top. Everyone at work loved them. I can't wait to make these again.

These were pretty good, I think i just messed them up by putting them in a smaller pan. The brownies were to thick and would not cook through :( I would probably use the marshmallow idea but with another brownie mix and a bigger pan next time ;)

I was super excited to make these but I was a little disappointed with the final result.  I followed the recipe exactly.  My brownies came out a little cakey not moist like most brownies.  I also think that they could use more butterscotch.  I didn't think that the butterscotch flavor came through that much.  They were definitely yummy but I'm not sure I would make them again.  If I do I'll add in more butterscotch chips with the chocolate chips and take them out of the oven a little gooey and let them "harden up" in the pan.

I didn't have butterscotch chips but I had caramel so that's what I used and the brownie turned out! The brownie was super chewy. When I was melting the butter with the (caramel) chips, I found mixing them together very difficult so I just mixed what I could (they wouldn't combine AT ALL) and when I poured the (butter and caramel chip) mixture with the egg, vanilla, and brown sugar mixture, mixing was no longer a problem. I did have to beat the mixture quite frantically at first but only 2 times before it mixed completely. That was the only trouble I had possibly due to using caramel chips instead of butterscotch. Scrumptious recipe though! Thank you, WannaBeChef!

These are delicious!  Even when I use the maximum time in the recipe they are still very gooey.  We like them that way, but if you want them to look prettier when you cut them then I would cook them a few extra minutes.  Yummy!

These were really pretty good. They were very butterscotchy so if you're not a fan of that flavor, take note. They didn't cook very evenly so the insides were gooey but the edges were very cakey. I would give them 3.5 stars, but everyone around me seemed to love them, so I gave them a 4. I'd make this again for a crowd pleaser (pot luck, community function etc), but probably not for my family.

I have tried these twice and each time they don't cook completely, even after over 40 minutes!  I wish they would work out because the outside that does cook is delicious.  I might try them again for a final time to see if adding more flour to it will help it set.  Very disappointed that they didn't work. :(

This recipe is awesome!!! The first time I made these I didn't let the batter cool enough and the marshmallows melted, which was good.. However, the second time I made this, I let the batter cool completely and it came out completely different and even better!!!  Excellent Recipe!

These were good, but average.  The recommended baking time was way too short.  I baked them for 25 mins. and they turned out fine, but it would have been easy to over- or under-bake them.  I probably won't be making these again; there are better blonde brownie recipes out there.

Easy and quick, nothing special. The title is a little misleading, you'd never know there were marshmallows in it. Probably won't make again.

I made this for the first time and it turned out pretty  good. I baked it for 25 minutes. It was sooo easy to make I made another batch the next day. I'm still experimenting..I will try to put less sugar and butter next time and decrease the cook time a little. The texture is more fluffy like a cake than chewy like a brownie.  But that's okay because the taste is awesome!

If you like butterscotch, you will love these!  The best blonde brownies I've tasted.  I ended up baking mine for about 22 minutes.  They are so moist and chewy, and very nice looking too.  No changes are necessary at all!

My brownies turned out perfect!  They were chewy and the marshmallows had melted into the bars and left little airy pockets all through.  I baked them until they were a pretty dark tan on top and the middle was firm, NOT LOOSE!  I think that's why so many reviews complained of gooey messes.  Another thing is that I've never liked butterscotch chips too much because, to me, they're too sweet, but mixed in the batter like this just makes the sweetness factor perfect.  I can't eat chocolate so I substituted peanutbutter chips.  These are my very favorite cookie/brownie of all time now.  Thank you so much for this perfect recipe.

These brownies are SOOO delicious!  My family just loved the combination of butterscotch, marshmallows and chocolate.  Perfect! I baked them in a buttered 9x13 glass baking dish and baked them longer than the recipe called for (about 25 minutes).

My mother-in-law shared this recipe with me after enjoying them at a family get together that we missed.  They are sensational!  No one in my family could get enough of them!  I quickly went and made another pan so we could enjoy them all over again!

This was yummy and very pretty in the pan.  I added pecans, which were excellent, but I would probably cut down a bit on the salt next time.

I just made these tonight and they are so... delish!  I used Reeces Peanut Butter chips instead of the Butterscotch.  They melt in your mouth!  Also, I baked them for just under 20 minutes.  I will make again for sure. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is not a brownie.

It is a lump of sweet stuff full of chocolate chips.  Far too rich and it hardens really quickly to the point that it is hard to eat.

This recipe was very easy to make but I felt the finished product was overwhelmingly sweet.  My family likes sweet but not too sweet.  If I make them again I might half the amount of chocolate chips.  I also like a thicker bar and might try baking them in a smaller pan (also increasing the bake time).

maybe these didn't turn out so well because I omitted the butterscotch chips. Tasted like cake. Softness was a bonus. Most likely won't make again...

I guess these were o.k.  To me they tasted like chocolate chip cookies.  I did cook them more than the 20 minutes (I think I cooked them for 25) as some suggested.  I just didn't see the WOW factor in these.  Maybe if they were made with peanut butter chips it would have been more interesting.  I'm not sure if I'll make these again.

To me these are just ok - I have definately made better brownies from this site.  I cooked them for almost 25 minutes since each time I poked them with a toothpick they weren't done.  I think they are probably supposed to be undercooked, because my finished product seems a little dry.  Flavor is ok, but nothing to write home about.

These are to die for! The flavor is very similar to a decadent candy I've had called Modjeskas (Bauer's Candy in Kentucky - try them!) made with caramel and marshmallow (but no chocolate). These are a delightfully different kind of soft chewy brownie. Next time I'll try them without the chocolate chips - for that uninterrupted caramel-marshmallow flavor. Either way though - I can't recommend these enough! You can whip these up in under an hour too...

This brownies never made it out of the pan!  They are a nice combination of tastes - something for everyone!  If you're looking for something different but not so different no one will enjoy them, try these!
