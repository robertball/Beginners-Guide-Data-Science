Followed the recipe, ate the whole thing then realized it was 4 servings. Pretty good as a pre gym meal. I also threw in protein powder. Delicious

This was very good. I'd never tried uncooked, cold oats before, and it was OK. I ended up heating it up, but I could eat it cold if I had to. I used vanilla yogurt and sprinkled on some cinnamon sugar and walnuts.  I'll make this again. (We got 3 servings from this amount.)

Super easy and what a great meal.  I scaled mine down to a single serving just to make sure it all came to my liking.  I did not have plain Greek Yogurt so I subbed in Coconut Yogurt but, everything else was the same.  This is very tasty and ou can make it hop innthe shower and breakfast is ready.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good! Easy and fast to make it will feed about 3 people unless you cut back some on the ingredients going by the recepe I have more than I can eat. Will definitely make again and just cut it all back some.
