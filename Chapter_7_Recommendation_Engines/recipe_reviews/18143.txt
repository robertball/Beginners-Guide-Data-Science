I grew up eating Cirak. Perhaps that is why I like it so much. If you like Cirak or if you grew up with it and would like to try making it yourself this is an excellent recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Not like the cirak we grew up on. Ours is Easter cheese not a sweet desert. But gave it a shot anyway.

I reduced sugar to 3/4 cup and omitted the nutmeg. Cirak is a family Easter favorite and we loved it. Just as a note: the mixture resembles watery scrambled eggs when itâ€™s ready.

We call this hrutka or egg cheese in slovakian cuisine. its a sweet recipe and the juice that is drained is so delicious hot or cold that my brother and i would fight over it to drink. we have it every Easter and although my mom always makes it ive also taken up the reins in making it. its almost painful standing in front of the stove stirring that long... but worth it in the end.
