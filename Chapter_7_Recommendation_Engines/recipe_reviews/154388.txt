I had to make this soup twice and I learned some important things.  Do not try to save time by putting the squash in the microwave.  Drain any excess liquid in the squash before removing the flesh.  Green bell is OK, half and half is not.  We thought it was too sweet the first time, so I removed the nutmeg and added 1 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1 tsp. ginger and 1/2 tsp. cumin.  Also 1 cup basil seemed alot so I used 2 Tbs. dried basil.  I was surprised to find the crawfish at Walmart, but I did add shrimp to the first batch.  It's a lot of work, but I would make it again.

this was such a great tasting soup!  i wasn't able to find butternut squash or crawfish at the store so i used yellow squash and tiger shrimp (it still worked great).  i think that any twist to this recipe will leave you quite happy.
