Not bad but made some additions, I used long grain brown rice, sauted the onion, garlic then added the rice, 1 cup chicken broth, tomatoes and simmered for 20 mins. Then added the other ingredients, including some green pepper and 2 tbsp of red chili flakes.
We enjoyed this with some chicken enchiladas.

This was pretty darn good--though I did put my own spin on it as most cooks are apt to do.  I sauteed the onion with some fresh minced garlic in olive oil rather than vegetable oil, and eliminated the garlic powder. In addition to the oregano I added 1/2 tsp. of cumin. Working with what I had, I cooked 1/2 cup of white long grain rice in chicken broth, then added it to the remaining ingredients to simmer awhile. This essentially amounted to changing the proportions of rice to beans, allowing for more beans, and less rice.  Finally, I used chopped, fresh Roma tomatoes rather than the stewed, though  that didn't necessarily make it any better--I was just working with what I had.  This was SO tasty, and was the perfect side dish for "Whit's Chicken Enchiladas," also from this site.

My whole family enjoyed this dish. I especially love the fact that it's so healthful. I sauteed fresh minced garlic with the onions, rinsed and drained the beans, used only 1 cup of brown rice, and added a little chili powder. The liquid from the tomatoes was plenty for the 1 cup of rice. We added a little shredded cheddar/jack and ate it wrapped in tortillas. Yum!

Good tasting and healthy mean.  I had to add another can of beans to this recipe to make it a bit less saucy, but that was not a big deal.  I did add chili powder and ground cumin give this meal more of a "chili" type of a feel.  Made regular rice seperately in my rice cooker and topped it with the bean mixture.  Overall this was a good recipe.

The best black beans and rice recipe I have found.  I think the tomatoes make the dish.  Very healthy and hearty =)

I would definitely cook the rice separately.  My rice was a little gummy and I had to add lots more water. Even still it tastes pretty good! I'll try this again soon, following my own advice of course.

I thought this was fairly bland and gummy tasting.  It was very easy to make, but it needs a lot more spice.

An easy and delicious recipe.  My whole family loved it.  I served the beans seperate from the
rice so everyone could choose how much they wanted.  Next time, I think I will make double.

Extremely straightforward, simple, and tasty; plus, it doesn't require any fancy ingredients. Also reheats well - I mixed it with chunky salsa. Will definitely have again!

I used 30-minute rice which works just a well, but you'll need at leat 1 extra cup of water.  It's a meal in a pinch.

As a bachelor with a small budget for food and not a lot of time to cook extravagant meals, this has become one of my favorite meals. The stewed tomatoes make this dish. Last night I tried putting my own spin on it along with the advice from other reviewers; I used 2 cans of beans, 2 cloves of fresh garlic to replace the powder, 1/2 tsp cumin, a pinch of chili powder, a bit of chicken broth (1 cup was too liquidy, I had to drain some) and I added about 1/4 cup frozen corn and a small can of green chiles. I also cooked the rice seperately and did not mix in with the rest until it was on my plate as I do with most rice dishes. It turned out really good, but if I use 2 cans of black means again I will also use 2 cans of stewed tomatoes and probably will sautee a jalepeno to give it some more kick. This is a truly guilt-free meal as it is cheap, healthy, and vegetarian along with being actually very delicious.

I enjoyed this! I took the advice of other reviewers and used minced garlic in place of powder which I sauteed with the onion in olive oil. Also added some jarred jalapeno with it. Added tomatoes, beans and cumin for flavor. Very easy and delicious! Will make great leftovers in a burrito I am sure!

I was looking for something quick, tasty, and nutritious to make tonight...with ingredients I had on hand and this absolutely fit the bill!!  I did have to change things up quite a bit, but it was a great jumping off point...something I probably never would have come up with.  I cooked the beans seperatley on the stove top: 1 can of beans a little over 1/4 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/8 tsp sugar, and a dash of cumin....simmered this for about 15 minutes while the rice cooked (cooked seperatley as well). After the rice was done, I mixed in a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies (no stewed tom's on hand), garlic powder, and beans (I didn't use any onion because I didn't have any).  So good!  And SO flavorful (for those of you complaining about no flavor!)...and the best part about it, these are all ingredients I will ALWAYS have on my shelf, and I don't have to worry about the freshness of ingredients...this is KEY when you're a working college student like myself!!  I KNOW this will become a ritual when I can't afford groceries!  Cheap to make, as well!!  Thanks so much for the idea!!

Very bland, even after I added crushed red pepper and seasoned salt.  Also, the liquid to rice ratio must be off...had to add chicken broth because the rice was chewy and all the liquid was gone.

This was very tasty. My 15 month old son loved it as well! I used garlic salt instead of powder and it still turned out very yummy and filling. I also ended up mixing in some cooked veggies (broccoli, carrots, and cauliflower) which was good. For those of you out there that do Weight Watchers the entire recipe is 32 Points Plus. It easily makes 4 very large servings which equate to 8 Points Plus per serving. Well worth it in my opinion.

Replacing vegetable oil with olive, I added one chopped jalapeno pepper with onion then once they were tender, added tomatoes, oregano, 1/4 tsp cumin, 1 tsp minced garlic and drained beans. The rice, I used used 1 cup regular brown rice, cooked in steamer for 45 mins then stirred into the bean tomato mixture after it simmered for about 5 mins. Served to husband on whole wheat tortillas with hot salsa and shredded cheese......He Loved It!! Will definitely make again!

Very good for a simple side to a cuban pork roast I was making.  I cooked my brown rice separately in a rice cooker.

This was a big hit with my family. Everyone loved it. I added ground turkey, chili pepper and cumin to make it more of a main dish. The next day I used it as a burrito filling, it was great. I will be making this again.

Good but I added my own twist.  I added chicken to the onion and garlic saute as well as cayenne pepper, ground cumin, and paprika.  I also used 2 cans of black beans instead of one.  After everything cooked together and the rice was done cooking I left the heat on low and added in 1 carton of quartered grape tomatoes.  Then put the lid on just enough to soften and heat the tomatoes all the way through.  Turned out as a delicious 1 pot meal! :)

With the onions I add mushrooms (I don't measure, just put about a 1/2 cup in). Also I put in minced garlic and let that cook with the veggies. I delete the tomatoes and add Worcestershire sauce (about a teaspoon) and Adobo seasoning (to taste).  I use white rice instead of brown because that's what I always seem to have on hand.

Hubby and kids liked this. This was a last minute addition to the menu and I didn't have Instant Brown Rice so I prepared White Long Grain in Low Sodium Chicken Stock in it's place. This worked out well. I felt it was a little bland so next time I will follow other reviews and add Cumin or other spices to brighten it up a little. We had this with Chicken Enchiladas and felt it went together very well. Thanks for sharing!

I took one reviewer's advice and try long grained whole wheat rice and it took forever to cook - more like an hour. I didn't have canned stewed tomatoes, so I used roma tomatoes and added some water. I simmered in half cup of chicken broth (ran out) and half a cup of water. It was okay, but a little bland for my taste.

The flavor and aroma was really good, but the rice came out too hard.  I'll try this again but will need to adjust the cooking times (or cook the rice separately).

Good recipe. It was a little bland but I added a dash of cayenne pepper to give this a kick. I sauteed green and red peppers with the onions also. It made a ton too.

Quick and easy, tasty and nutritious, not to mention cheap. A real winner! I added pepper and chili peppers for some spicy flavour.

This was great. I made it with fish tacos. Even my 15 month old ate it. I did add a half of a lime at the end before I served it. Didn't need it but did add to it. We will be making this again

Yummy!  I added 1/2 tsp. cumin, salt and pepper, 2 beef bouillon cubes, and about 6 dashes of Tobasco sauce.  Also used 2 cans beans instead of just 1; made it less soupy.

Make this all the time! Quick, easy, delicious, you can't go wrong. I experiment using different spices and some fresh ingredients and it always comes out great. My new fav twist is to add a can of pink beans.

Fantastic! I followed the basic ingreients and method, but I didn't have any garlic unfortunately. I also used Extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added chopped jalapenos. I like it spicy so I added more oregano, chilli powder, cumin and some crushed red pepper flakes. While cooking the rice, I only added a bit of water to get it started about half way, and then I added the patially cooked rice to the beans and tomato mixture. The rice absorbed the liquid nicely but it also left some sauce too. Perfect, will definitely going to make this often! I think it would be good to add a little bit of bacon, chicken or shrimp too! Great, thank you for posting!

I'm sitting on my couch eating this right now and it is soooo good. I was hungry for something with black beans, rice and onion and this is the recipe I found. I used white rice because I didn't have any brown rice, and although I had stewed tomatoes, I chose to use diced tomatoes. I also used about a tsp of minced garlic along with the called for garlic powder. (I like garlic!) Finally, I added about 1/3 tsp cumin. This is so healthy and really hits the spot. I think I could eat the whole pan!

This recipe was quick, easy, delicious, and inexpensive. The only changes I made were in using Italian-seasoned diced tomatoes, rinsing the black beans, and cooking the rice separately and adding together at the end. I also cooked the rice in chicken broth.

This is edible, I'll say that much, although the taste is bland.  In addition to that, I followed the recipe exactly, and found that there was not nearly enough liquid to cook the rice.  When I opened the lid of the pan at the end of the 5 minute cooking time, the rice and beans were dry, hard, and stuck to the bottom.  I had to add a lot more water and simmer for a few more minutes.  I made this as a side dish to go with tacos, but it isn't good enough to eat that way.  I ended up putting some of it IN my taco which made it taste better - or maybe it was the sour cream, cheese, and other toppings that tasted good.

This wasn't bad - but it was much better after a night in the fridge.

Next time I may try adding a little chili powder to give it some kick.

Excellent!  I substituted diced tomatoes with green chilis and added cumin.  Quick, easy, so delicious - very good with the chicken & cheese enchiladas I served them with and also left over rolled up in a tortilla with cheese melted on top.  Thanks!!

SOOOO good! I used fresh garlic instead of powder. I lengthened the simmering time since the water from the tomatoes was a lot. Absoutely delicious!

For more flavor, add ground black pepper or better yet, white pepper (it's hotter than black, be forewarned!), cumin, a pinch of cayenne if you like things spicy, and fresh cilantro. Even a packet of (low sodium!) Sazon will help. Also, saute a thinly sliced celery stalk with the onion and use fresh garlic instead of powdered.

As written, I was not a big fan. I don't really care all that much for instant rice and throwing it all in the same pot just made it an unpleasant texture. So I made a few changes the second time and really enjoyed this dish! First, I switched to long grain rice and cooked it separately. Meanwhile, I sauted onions and fresh minced garlic in some olive oil, then added the beans (I love beans, so I upped it to two cans), tomatoes and cooked rice and switched the oregano for some fresh basil. Oh so yummy!!!

Like the idea but you can make this dish without much trouble using better mix of ingredients IMO. I use dried Black turtle beans and soak them while I'm at work, long grain brown rice, then I use store bought salsa instead of canned tomatos and onion. Also I'm not a vegetarian but enjoy vegetarian/vegan dishes, so I usually add some cheddar cheese while its still hot so it mixes in, but clearly this is not an addition for our vegan readers, but for the vegetarians / healthy meat eaters it does add a bit to the flavor.

Made this for lunch today for lunch and it was a huge hit-quick, economical, and delicious.We served it in burrito shells with fresh salsa, cheese, hot sauce and sour cream, but it was great on its own, too.  My husband used the leftovers as a dip with tortilla chips. My 9-year old even asked if we could have this for dinner sometime. We made it according to the directions except that we only used one cup of rice (all we had left in the pantry). This will be going into the lunch rotation!

Pretty good.  I thought it needed something more, and tried subbing Rotel for stewed tomatoes and added a cup of frozen corn.  With those additions, it was good as both a cold salad and wrapped in a tortilla with a little grated cheese added for quick meal.

Love this :)  Just made it, and it came out amazingly.  I only made a couple small changes, doubled the recipe but only made 2 cups of rice, added some crushed red pepper flakes, dried basil, and lots of fresh garlic (no powder).  And just b/c it's what I had onhand, I used 1 can black beans and 1 can white northern beans.

As is, this recipe is a wonderful base to a fantastic side/meal.  I found that I needed to add a few spices (cayenne, cumin, more garlic) to make it taste alright.  I also just cooked the rice and then added the tomatoes and beans in with the rice - turned out great!

I was worried it might come out mushy after reading some other reviews. So when the timer went off and it was a little on the dry side with the rice not totally done I was suprised. I added 3tablespoons of water and gave it another five minutes. It was perfect!!! My family loved it, it is cheap too. I will certainly make this a regular meal at my house. Thank you for this lovely, simple recipe. Note: recipe says four servings, well it fed all four of us twice and it was the total meal served only with a half ear of corn as a side.

Love, love, love this recipe!  I've made it with a tsp of a southwest seasoning mix for lunch.  My toddler loves it!  And I've made it with cajun seasoning and andouille sausage for dinner.  Hubby and toddler both asked for more.  And it's way healthier than buying a boxed or bagged mix.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  It's got a permanent place in my recipe box.

This was really quick, really easy and really good.  I think the only change I made was instead of plain canned tomatoes I had some tomatoes that were canned with peppers which added a nice spice to the dish.  Add some cornbread on the side and we had a great lunch for a low cost!

This recipe is delicious and quick! I did revise it slightly to add a bit more flavor. I added 3tbs white vinegar, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, and 3 cloves fresh minced garlic.

So tasty! I doubled the recipe and instead of the oregano I used cumin, chili powder and a little salt. I also used fresh garlic sauteed with the onion. I premade the rice and mixed everything together after it was ready. Will definitely make this again!

I agree this was quite a good basic recipe.  However, as some reviewers have noticed, it does need a little bit of tweaking for extra kick.  I sauteed half an onion and a clove of garlic with some crushed red pepper.  Just the juice from the tomatoes was not enough to cook the rice, so I also added half a can of chicken broth.  Then, for extra flavor, I added half a cup of white wine.  I added frozen corn, more crushed red pepper, some parsley, italian seasoning, a little Cajun seasoning, and about two scoops of light sour cream.  It turned out very flavorful, with some bite to it, but still healthy.  With the modifications it was very good.

I LOVED this! I changed it quite a bit though, I cut down on the tomatoes and added corn and a TINY dash of crushed red pepper flakes. I also Drained all of the canned goods and used that liquid to cook yellow saffron rice in the rice cooker. When everything else was done I threw it in the rice cooker and let it sit for a while. I then served it on a flower tortilla with some lettuce and sour cream. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!

Very good and easy - eating it right now!  I didn't have brown rice so I cut it down to one cup of uncooked white rice and cooked it seperately from the beans.  I ran the stewed tomatoes through the food processor to reduce tomato chunks - I just don't like them - and added some chili powder, salt and cumin.  Very good.  Will make again.  Thanks.

Good base recipe. I used 2 cloves minced garlic, added a small can of chopped green chiles, some cumin and chili powder, turned out great... still healthy, but with more flavor.

What's good about this recipe is how easy & healthy it is. What I did not like is how tomato-y it tasted. It was a bit mushy, too, and needed more spices.  This is okay, but not outstanding.

This is a very easy and delicious recipe.  I used the Mexican-style black beans and also added 1 t. cumin, as suggested by a previous review.  It had great flavor and spiciness.  I will definately make this again.

was great, very easy to put together. I did make some changes, I didn't have garlic powder or oregano so I used 3 cloves of fresh chopped garlic and fine herbs with some salt and pepper. I did not add instant rice to this I used basmati that I perpared seperately. my 3 kids (especially my picky 5 year old who hates beans)loved this dish and wants to eat it again tomorrow! Will deffinately make this again.

This is a delicious recipe! This recipe can be personalized by adding favorite spices to it or veggies. I put some ground cumin, oregano leaves, and bell peppers to it and it was great!! A very simple recipe waiting for a family to spice it up.

It was good. I admit that I did not have the tomatoes, so I skipped that part. Maybe it will be fabulous next time when I have tomatoes. And I have a rice cooker to cook my rice, so I never do it on the stove. That may have affected it, too.

This is a great start for a healthier alternative to traditional rice and beans. A couple suggestions that will give this dish a Cuban/Puerto Rican flair are: 1) Use 1/4 - 1/2 c. sofrito in place of the onion & garlic powder, sauteed about 1 minute in 1/2 tbsp. olive oil to replace the veggie oil. Crush a clove of garlic into that as well. Add 1-2 packets of Sazon seasoning, and Adobo to taste, and simmer as directed. For a smoky, authentic flavor, you may dice and fry a couple of slices of bacon with the sofrito, omitting any oil.
Thanks for a GREAT recipe idea!

This is very tasty and has a lot of additional potential. I did not have quick-cook rice, so I sauteed the onions first, then added the rice, water, tomatoes and spices. About 3/4 of the way through the cook time, I added the beans. I also added about 1 1/2 tsp. of chili powder, but next time, I think I'll add more. I also used just regualr canned diced tomatoes because that's what I had. This would also be good with green chiles or green pepper.

This was a great dish and fun to make too - I didn't exactly go according to the recipe when it came to the spices but it still turned out tasting great. I  didn't have instant rice so I made my rice in advance. I cut up half an onion instead of a whole and minced two garlic cloves - I sauteed these until lightly golden. Once the onions and garlic were sauteed, I then added the beans , diced garlic & herb tomatoes (canned) and my spices which were: salt & pepper, cumin, cayenne pepper, ginger powder, and Oregano. I let everything simmer together for at least 5 minutes. With the rice, I put about a tbsp of olive oil in the water and about a tbsp of salt for flavor - once it was cooked I added a tbsp of lime juice. Everything tasted wonderful! This dish is fun to mess around with and pretty versatile as I added about a handful of corn to the dish just for some light sweetness and color. My boyfriend loved this for sure - will be making again!

This was a very tasty dish.  I followed it for the most part, except for using about half an onion.  I also didn't mix in my rice.  I cooked separately; kept separate until ready to eat.  I will definitely make it again.  I would recommend cutting up the stewed tomatoes before adding to the pot.

Very easy recipe! I just cooked my own brown rice separately and mixed everything together at the end, instead of cooking instant rice in there. The taste was a little weak for our preference so I added some cumin and chili pepper powder pretty liberally, which I would highly recommend. It's a great thing to have in the fridge as leftover sides or small meals!

I went vegetarian a couple years ago, and this was one of the first recipes I had come across soon after giving up meat. Since then, I've probably made this recipe a hundred times, it's THAT good. It didn't take very long before I put my own spin on it to make it taste a little more like an authentic Mexican recipe. Instead of a can of stewed tomatoes, I used a can of Ro*tel. I also added a little bit of corn. Also, instead of using the standard Italian oregano, I used Mexican oregano that I brought back with me from a trip to Arizona, and instead of one teaspoon of it, I used two. I added about a tablespoon of ground cumin. When the time came to stir in the rice, I also added about 1/4 cup of water. I simmered for about 7-9 minutes according to package directions. Before serving, I garnished it with a sprig of cilantro. I really wowed my family...they ALL loved it!

Really good flavor. I didn't have quick rice so it took a bit longer to cook. I used chicken broth instead of water in the rice to add more flavor. I also used mexican stewed tomatoes with jalapenos and added hot peppers to give it some kick. I didn't add the rice to the mixture until the end and let it all simmer for about 5-7 mins. Yummy!!

Turned out great! I cooked it a little differently. I cooked Basmati rice in broth until just slighly undercooked. Separately, in a skillet I cooked onion and green pepper in oil, added chopped garlic, a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes, a can of black beans, and oregano. I let that simmer for a few minutes, then added the rice, turned the heat off and placed a lid on it. I let it sit for 5 minutes, just long enough for the rice to finish cooking while sitting there.

My 11yr old liked it so it is a keeper.  I put beans & tomatoes and seasoning in small crock pot.  I was too lazy to cut up an onion so I just used onion powder.  I made 10 minute rice separate and then mixed together.  Everyone loved it.

I was looking for some new healthy recipes for my daughter (almost 1 1/2) and came across this!  I was very pleased!  This was VERY easy to make and it had a good taste.  I will make this again!

This was a great side for the Cuban Midnight Sandwich.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding a couple of minced garlic cloves in with the onion and also my black beans were Cuban style black beans, which had some peppers and other spices added.  I also used instant white rice because that is what I had on hand.  Since I had leftovers, I will add some chicken and make a burrito for dinner tomorrow evening.  Yum!

This is really delicious!  I don't care for brown rice OR black beans, but this recipe sounded like something my husband would like, so I made it for him.  Surprise ... I really like it!  My super-picky 12 year old even liked it! Like some other reviewers, I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil; added minced garlic with the onion; and added cumin, cayenne, salt & pepper.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I actually used another recipe from this site, but came across this one afterward, and realized it was a little closer to what I had made.  I used a can of diced tomatoes, as it was all I has on hand.  I added about 1/2 a red pepper as well as some cumin, chili powder and red pepper flaked.  A little boring, but very economical and very healthy!

These were really good. I only gave it 4 stars becasue I had to use petite cut cmall tomato due to not having stewed on hand. My husband really like these. I ate mine with shredded pork on top and some guac, sour cream and salsa. very good

An excellent base. I tried it first with the stewed tomoatoes, then with salsa. We liked it better with salsa.

As a former Texas girl, I can say that this recipe does not have a Tex-Mex kick to it at all.  It's a good base and has potential but, as written, we found it to be pretty bland.  I even added cumin and extra garlic but it wasn't enough.  I didn't finish mine but Hubby liked his much better after adding salsa to it.

I use either olive oil or canola oil since it is healthy to saute onion and minced garlic. I then use a can of diced tomatoes with mild green chiles and 1 cup of white instance rice. I drain and rinse the bean. My husband does not like as many beans so I only use about 3/4 of the can. This is really good on flour tortillas. It is filling but you feel good about what you are eating.

This recipe was so tasty and so very satisfying, that I couldn't NOT review it!  I'm dairy intolerant, and finding meatless recipes can sometimes be a challenge. This will definitely be added to the rotation!  The only change I made was using Cuban-style black beans.  Otherwise, followed it to a "T", and served on whole wheat tortillas.  Thanks so much for a great, easy recipe!

Great recipe.  I love the packaged version, but I'd say this is better.  Crushed or diced tomatoes would probably be a little better since they would mix in better, but the flavor was great!  Healthy and SO filling!

this recipe turned out pretty dry.  i think if i made it again, i would add less rice.  i dont care for big chunk tomatoes, so i chopped the stewed tomatoes.  very easy recipe though.  i served it with some shredded cheese and flour burritos.

This was ok. An easy way to make beans and rice a little healtheir by using the brown rice.  I cooked my rice separately (using chicken broth) drained my black beans and added sharp cheddar cheese. I served this with spinach tortillas and mexican seasoned chicken breasts. My husband and daughter both liked the meal.

This is excellent!!! Just be advised that if you do use instant rice, just be sure to add some extra water. No big deal, especially if you like it creamy. I also used turkey keilbasa and you really can not tell the difference. Also, I used fresh garlic and I also added some chopped celery. To spice it up a bit with some flavor, I added some cayanne pepper and some ground cumin...YUM YUM YUM...The tomatoes I used came with onions, green peppers and celery in them. I would recommend that..ENJOY!

This was pretty good. I chose to make it as a side dish rather than a main dish. Next time I make it I will eliminate the tomatoes...they just didn't seem to blend well with the taste of the black beans.

This was very good and very quick. There's no need to drain or chop anything. You just throw it all in. I also love that it's so healthy. I added a teaspoon of cumin because I like the taste. I'll probably use a can of tomatoes and chilis next time to give it a little spice.

I really enjoyed this recipe & loved the flavor! Also, very healthy! I had 2 large servings. My husband would have liked more spice, but then he's not a beans eater anyway. I could add spicy salsa in the future. And I liked that it was quick. I added pre-cooked brown rice for the last 5 minutes - still saved me time since I cooked the rice earlier the day.

Very quick recipe, I made this with Chicken Enchiladas also from this site and was able to make this dish while the enchiladas baked. My husband didn't really care too much for it but our dinner guest and myself liked it. Next time I will add an extra can of beans, drained and rinsed so there's not too much liquid. I would like more beans in the dish.

Who would think something so simple could have such a flavor impact?  I added a bunch of cilantro at the very end and that made it even more tasty for my family.  You'll want to keep your pantry stocked with these items all the time for a quick tasty dinner.  Highly recommend and easily adjusted for individual tastes.

After reading the other reviews, I took the advice of adding a bit more spice.  I added fresh minced jalapeno to the sautee, and a dash or two of cumin.  It was delicious!

It was partially edible. There was way too much rice for the amount of liquid that was in the pan. I needed to add a cup or more of broth to cook the rice correctly. It was also very bland and we needed to put salt or salsa on top to eat it.

Not sure if I missed something but I found this fairly bland. I ended up adding cheese, sour cream, and salsa for flavour. My husband added some hot sauce for some kick. After these additions it wasn't too bad.

This is my first recipe from this Allrecipes, and it is was very good!!! I got the ingredients today, cooked it tonight, and really liked it.. Is it the best?? I do not know, as this is my first black bean and rice recipe!! But, I have to do more of these type meals to meet my heart and weight health requirements!! Will try other similar recipes, but to be sure, I really enjoyed this one. I used red onion, if anyone cares!! I do recommend this recipe and I thank Kathy Miller for sharing!!! Thanks Kathy! I love your recipe. For a single person, this was just perfect.. It was EASY and FAST!!! What I did not see, if it was there, was the nutrition values for this recipe. I can use another app to figure that out, but it would be nice to see that included with the recipe!!

This was amazing. I love eating rice sometimes, it feels more filling and satisfying, and this is a healthy way to eat rice with protein and flavor. I sauted the onions and crushed garlic with olive oil. I smoothied two tomatoes in a blender and added to the mixture. The rice cooks faster than the beans, so soaking the beans an hour or so before would be good. I used dried beans.  Added some chili cayenne pepper to up the spiciness. It was so good!

This recipe is a keeper!  The only changes I made were, I used long grain brown rice that I cooked separate (adds to the time). I used minced garlic when cooking the onions instead of garlic powder. I also added chili powder and some kielbasa I had on hand.

Quick and easy! I was looking for an easy black beans and rice recipe, and this is it! My only change was to make basmati rice separately and then mix that into the bean, tomato, and onion mixture. Fantastic!

Here's the thing - either use 1 cup of brown rice or add about 1/2 cup of water to the dish - the liquid isn't enough for the rice. Also might add some salt and pepper depending on the tomatoes you choose.

This is a go-to week night meal in my house.  Affordable, fast cooking and loved by my whole family, even my "meat and potatoes" hubby. Being a working mom I need fast meals and this one never disappoints. As a "meatless Monday" main dish or a side to tacos this is always in rotation!

This is a great, simple dish, but like others have mentioned, I made a few tweaks to the recipe:

1) I used brown basmati rice (cooked it first),
2) I sauteed minced garlic with the onions (instead of garlic powder),
3) I added about a 1/4-1/2 cup of water,
4) I did not have any dried oregano, so I added some some dried cilantro and dried basil instead,
5) I added some cumin and also some cayenne for a bit of heat.

One of the easiest and healthiest dishes you can make and it tastes so good. The best part of a dish like this is how flexible it is.

I thought the recipe was ok but I cooked it too long and the rice I had was not instant. I think next time I will use instant brown rice and put two cups of water in with the black bean mixture.

My daughter doesn't eat meat, so this was a great taco shell filler for her. The only change we made was to use Mexican style diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes because we were making tacos with the filling. We used this in place of taco meat and added yummy taco toppers like shredded cheese, guacamole, sour cream and lettuce. Delicious!

I use fresh garlic, tomatoes and cilantro.  Great flavor!  I like the brown rice too, it has more of a bite than plain white rice. I Also add cumin for a little extra spice.

This was good. I made it as written. It is very mild so if you like your food more robust in flavor I advise you to add spice. My family added hot sauce before eating and that was enough for us.

This is pretty much what we Costa Ricans have for breakfast all the time! A nice spin comes if you add chopped pork cracklings and deep fried spiced diced pork! Add to this some tortilla chips and you will have a nice Chifrijo! Best pub food ever!!

I didn't have stewed tomatoes on hand until I noticed a can of them after I'd already used a can of diced tomatoes, maybe that is why mine tasted so bland.  I had added a 1/4 tsp of cumin and some green pepper, but this was not my favorite recipe.

I made this tonight and it was quick and delicious! All ingredients I kept exactly as recipe called for only adjustment was time had to add an additional 5 minutes because rice looked hard & not completely cooked. I will definitely make recipe again. Yummy!

It was tasty, but I feel like it was missing something. I also added about a 1/4 cup of water, because it was too dry when I added the rice.

Made this tonight, and it was delicious and very easy.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I just used chopped Italian tomatoes.  I think next time I will probably just regular rice instead of the minute rice just to give it a little bit better texture, but I will be making this again.

Used chili ready stewed tomatoes and served over regular brown rice. (Cooked seperately). Also, added cilantro , a little lime juice & corn. Served with fresh avocado & side of cheddar cheese. Needed a little table salt to individual taste. Great inspirational start.

This is the best/easiest recipe for black beans and rice I have found yet!  Not too many ingredients and very quick for a weeknight!  I added 1/2 tsp cumin as well, and salt to taste.

I followed the recipe and made a few changes.  I used fresh garlic instead of powder and cooked it with the onions & EVOO instead of vegetable oil.  I also added some chicken broth at the end because the rice was still too chewy.  I like my rice on the mushy side.  Came out perfect.  Great basic recipe, very delicious and healthy!

I thought this was perfect! The canned beans and tomatoes make the nicest thick flavorful sauce. I did find I needed to add about a half cup extra water to cook my rice, but there is an awful lot of variation between the brands of canned tomatoes/beans so that might not be your case. As written this is seasoned mildly which worked perfect with my spicy main and side, of course extra peppers and herbs can be added depending on preference, I would hope no one docks stars or calls this "bland" for that silly reason :) Thanks so much for sharing, this is going to be made often in our house!

I didn't think this was going to be anything special, but I was wrong. I made this a little different, because I prepared the rice first, then added the rinsed beans and diced tomatoes. This made quite a lot and I'm sure will be just as good left over. Good for you and good... that's what I like ;)

I'm sorry, we didn't really like this.  I served it in tortillas and it was pretty bland.  I think you would need to add lots of spices and some meat.  We won't be making this again.

I was looking for an alternative to the Lipton Rice Sides that I use to complement main dishes.  This dish tasted wonderful and my family loved it too.  It didn't take much longer and does not have all the additives.  I used white instant rice and used minced garlic instead of garlic salt and added salt and pepper.

Neh, I didn't care for this.  Missing something.  I guess maybe I was looking for something more like spanish rice.  Maybe my temp was too high but I had to add a lot of water to the rice for it to cook up.

Very quick and very good!  Perfect for those times when you are wanting something comforting and solid.  Good flavor.  Instead of instant rice, I used a package of Trader Joe's Fully Cooked Long Grain Brown Rice which I stirred in at the end and then let it all simmer together for about 5 minutes. No problems with gumminess. Also added some cumin and used minced garlic (sauteed with the onion) instead of garlic powder.  All in all a winner! Yum!

I found this recipe bland.  I did drain the beans, as my family does not need the added gas! (maybe that's where the flavor went)  I also thought it was alot of rice.  I cooked my rice ahead so it wouldn't be chewy, as advised by other raters/reviewers

I sauteed onions and garlic first, and then added brown rice (not quick cooking), half a can of diced tomatoes, broth, cumin, chili powder, oregano, and s&p. After the rice cooked for about 20 min, and added the beans and heated through. Pretty decent.

This was a great recipe! I think that it would be a little less dry if you used 1 cup when using instant white rice. Also, it wouldn't hurt to have a little spice; maybe a jalepeno pepper or some tabasco sauce. I added sliced keilbasa sausage with the onions.Very good, and easy!

Very, very good! I used abt a Tbsp. of minced onion instead and 3 tsp. of minced garlic instead of garlic powder. Also, I prefer the taste of diced tomatoes vs. stewed, so that is what I used. I reduced the rice to about 1 1/4 c. That being said, this was a delicious recipe. Even my picky 4 yr. old liked it. This will definitely be a keeper. Wonderful for those days when lunch is running late and I don't have anything planned. Thanks so much for sharing!!!!!

We liked this on tortillas.  I used Rotel tomatos and diced chilis instead of just tomatoes for extra kick.  Quick and definitely kid approved.

We thought this was pretty good.  I didn't have instant brown rice, so I cooked regular rice and just mixed it into the bean mixture.  I think it maybe could have used a little more flavor and moisture.  Next time I will use real garlic sauteed with the onion, and maybe mix in some chicken broth.

This recipe was very good although,it needs more flavor,or should I say a kick.I used real garlic instead of the powder. I also added,crushed red pepper,chili powdre,& a little hot sauce.Other than it being a little on the mild side,it was great.I went by the recipe except for using the real garlic because,I have a 84 yr. old mother & I wanted her to be able to eat it too.She loved it.T he other adults that wanted it hotter,added spices to it later,everyone was happy,I'd make this again,for sure.Thanks for the recipe.

It was good - nice and basic. I thought it seemed a bit on the plain side (maybe needs more spice like green peppers or something?). But it was quite good, definitely easy, and I will make it again.

I liked this recipe. Only thing is it does need a bit more spice for my family...we like spice, but if you enjoy a nicely flavored black beans and rice with little to no "heat" you'll like this.

Great quick black beans & rice. I did not use the oregano, but did use a heaping tablespoon of ground cumin and chopped garlic instead of garlic powder. I did use the 1 1/2 cups of rice and it was not watery. I also used a 19oz. can of black beans, less tomato-y.

This had ok flavor but did not go over well at our home.  Too much rice, too bland of flavor, and the texture all seemed mushy.  Even when we put salsa on top and added a salad, we did not like this.  Not something I will make again.

I really enjoyed how quick this recipe was to make.  Instead of the stewed tomatoes which usually I never have on hand, I used half of the sauce as plain tomato sauce and used one 8oz can jar of the "picante" tomato sauce you buy in the stores for that little bit of spice.  As a side dish, I fried some tostones and my husband and I ate every grain of rice.

I like this as a base for meat. I added hamberger some chunks of red bell peppers and chunked onion. Leftovers next day I added more rice and a can of beef broth. It was even better with the broth.

No matter how long I cooked the brown rice, it just never seemed to be done. This recipe may be better if substituted with white rice.

Yummy, quick dish.  I added red jalapenos and tabasco and there was no lack of flavor!  Also, I didn't have instant brown rice, so I made the rice separately and served the bean mixture on top of the rice.
