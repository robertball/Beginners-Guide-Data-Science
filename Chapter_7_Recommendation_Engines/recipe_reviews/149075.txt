I love these.
very few changes made here:
I added 1/2 tsp madagascar vanilla, 1/2 cup golden raisins and 1/2 cup california raisins and used organic sugar.
They turned out fluffy, and sweet.

A great standby to add to our muffin rotation. I replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce and used white wheat flour. I also added raisin.

I made these for my sister who isn't allowed fat due to illness. I replaced the oil with applesauce, and the egg with egg 2 egg whites, as suggested, and added some raisins and dried cranberries. They were a bit bland for me but she liked them as she hasn't had any 'cake' products for 3 months now and is really fed up! Thanks for sharing.

very delicious!! alterations to recipe:
used 1 c. whole wheat flour and 1/4 c. white flour. used 1c skim instead of 1 1/4 c. and added 1.5 c. processed Rome apple peels. added 1/2 c. bran. would have been even better with chopped walnuts.

This is a really good recipe and I will definitely make it again. It has a good flavor to it just as it is, but if you're looking for variations try adding raisins or whatever other dried fruit you like.

Loved the ease of making this muffin.  I made some substitutions though.  First, whole wheat flour in place of the white flour, Splenda in place of sugar, Fiber One Original cereal in place of All Bran, nonfat dry milk and water in place of the milk and Hellman's Reduced Fat mayo in place of the oil. I also added about 1/4 t of cinnamon.  The muffins came out a little more dense than white flour muffins would but they were tasty and moist all the same.  Note: since Fiber One cereal tends to stay fairly crispy, even in milk, I let it sit for about 10 minutes before mixing in the dry ingredients.

This is a good basic recipe for bran muffins.  I added some applesauce and 1/2 cup dried cranberries for a little extra zing.  There are many different ingredients you can add for your own personal taste; dried fruit, raisins,nuts, different flavors of applesauce etc to make them a little more tastey.

These are great as is and easy to tweek. Good with raisins, nuts, cinnamon etc. I always sub applesauce for oil and whole wheat flour. I have lots of zuchini right now so I added one medium zuch finely shredded. My 4yr old has no idea and gobbles them up. Good with Strawberry freezer jam. Moist, dense, earthy. Good good good.

I used whole wheat white flour and cut the baking powder back to a teaspoon and added a teaspoon of baking soda. For an extra fiber boost, I added a half cup of organic raisins that I'd soaked in unsweetened hot chai before I added it to the muffin batter. (If you do this, make sure you really drain your raisins well and maybe even blot them dry if you have to. Too much liquid from soaking might ruin your muffins.) These muffins came out moist, though a little bland. Next time, I might add some cinnamon and nutmeg and a teaspoon of vanilla.

These were easy to make and did not take long to bake. I substituted applesauce for the oil and added a dash of vanilla (I love vanilla in all my baking), a shake or two of cinnamon, and a cup of raisins. My 2 yr old ate two of them as soon as they were cool enough.

I used 1/2 white whole wheat flour and 1/2 all-purpose flour and subbed unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  A delicious muffin that can have lots of variations by adding apples, raisins, craisins, nuts, chocolate chips, or a host of other add-ins.

GREAT EASY recipe.  I'm looking to add more fiber into my diet so this recipe is wonderful.  I made 24 muffins medium sized muffins without doubling the recipe and estimate about 3 grams of fiber in each.  I added a cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 tsp of vanilla.  I also cut back the baking time to 18 mins which I think is perfect.  My kids also loved 'em.  They won't last long!  Thanks!

I didn't used flour at all, I put 3 cups of cereal All Bran, with 1/2 cup of non fat milk and 1/2 of water to make them low calories, I added chpped prunes. I put only 2 tablespoons of sugar and for my tasted It was not enough. They didn't rise a lot, but the flavor was good.

This was a great recipe...easy and tasty.  The cereal itself gives it a bit of sweetness.  When you need a bran muffin...go with this one!  Inge

Perfect muffin. Dense but crunchy on top and moist inside life a muffin should be. Added a splash of molasses, vanilla extract, and a sprinkle each of cinnamon and nutmeg.

good. I wouldn't say anything terribly special for a bran muffin, but worth making again. i replaced the oil with applesauce, came out just fine.

These muffins have a nice flavour...I added a little cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.  I also used applesauce instead of oil, and insead of 2 cups of Bran Flakes, used 1 cup of Flakes and 1 cup of All Bran Buds for a little boost of psyllium fibre.  Finally I added chocolate chips (for hubby and kids).  My only complaint is that they're a little dense, but perhaps that's because of one of the changes I made.  All in all, very good!

1. Great muffins. They baked perfectly and tasted like a bran muffin should. However, I prefer bran muffins with banana or apple chunks.
2. I made them with 2 bananas and no oil and they were rubbery.
3. Now I made them with 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce and it was great.
4. original recipe is okay. maybe sweeten with honey next time?
5. I have finally achieved the taste I was seeking! Follow the recipe as written, and add 1 banana!!
