Very very delicious. I used chicken portions that I had that needed to be used instead of chicken breast meat. And for those that don't have a 48 ounce can of beans in your pantry, it's roughly 3 standard size cans. The dish was successful easy, and overall flavor was really good. My little nit-pick on the recipe was it was a bit runny. It was more like a thick soup and not like a chili. I did mash down the beans in the final step as directed and still found it liquidy, so I added an additional 15.5 ounce can of navy beans and mashed them as well. It helped it a lot better. But reguardless of the additional can. This is a simple and pleasing dish that I will make again.  So thank you Bill. UPDATED: 10/24/14 I changed out the protein for Johnsonville Butcher Shop Style Cheddar Cheese & Bacon Smoked Sausage...OMG was soo good with a dollop of sour cream. A recipe remake on this was totally awesome as this is still a good simple recipe with few ingredients. TY

This is so good and easy.  I didn't have salsa so I used RoTel instead and it was super.

This was a fantastic, flavorful, cheap and easy meal! I added some garlic and tobasco to the pot, and it was great! only complaint is that the chicken turned out a little dry, so I'll try to cook it for less time or on a lower setting next time.

I have made this several times and the whole family loves it. I toss in whole frozen chicken breasts and just shred them up before serving. I cook mine on low for about 8 hours.

Very simple to make. I used 1 can of cannelli beans, 1 can pinto and 1 can black beans because that's what I had. The salsa I used was a mild salsa. I think it needed a little extra umph..Next time I would use a medium or hot salsa. I served it over rice. Very good

So YUM!!!  I didn't have time to slow cook, so I boiled chicken and then chopped, added other ingredients and simmered for 20 minutes.  I added cumin and fresh cilantro, and served with a dollop of greek yogurt and corn chips.  My husband flipped!  Will DEFINITELY be making this one again!

Will make again. Very easy and packed with protein! I added diced onion and minced garlic & instead of using 2 cups of water I used reduced sodium chicken broth and deleted the bouillon cubes to help reduce the sodium. Also used 8 frozen chicken tenderloin breast and cooked everything in a dutch-oven on the stovetop on low setting for several hours. Chicken very tender and moist. My kids enjoyed the chili too!

Wow!  A lot of flavor for so few ingredients... I didn't have green chilies so I skipped that and it was still so flavorful and awesome! Also, because I wasn't going to be home all day and I wanted it ready for dinner when I got home, I cooked in on low for 8 hours... the chicken was moist and shredded apart with ease.
