We call these "jelly bean bars" because the soft chewy centers of these bars remind us of jelly beans. Although unusual my autistic son is crazy about them and even hubby likes them. Arrowroot flour is hypoallergenic has been used for infant formula and in America it is commonly used as a thickener for gravy or pie filling. The batter did not want to mix with the whipped egg whites so I did have to use a beater to combine the two. Perhaps they would have been fluffier and less chewy if I had not beat them. The gelatinous texture of the bar reminds me of a Filipino dessert made with a special rice and cooked wrapped in banana leaves. It would be delicious with coconut added to the recipe. Cutting the bars with a knife is difficult so I recommend using kitchen scissors. I put chocolate sprinkles on the top before baking and took photos so that you could see what these look like.

These are VERY chewy have a good flavor and are relatively easy to make. Very different then what I was expecting but pretty good. I only liked them when they were warm though. My son liked them the next day but I did not.
