I've been making this recipe for years.  It was published in Good Housekeeping years ago using chicken quarters.  As a final step, brush the skin with honey and lightly sprinkle with salt.

I have to say I was a bit skeptical, but this turned out great! The stuffing turned out slightly sweet but had a good flavor and the chicken was very moist and tender. I did add an extra slice of bread as my zucchini seemed a little wet. I stuffed two breasts and two thighs with the stuffing. I also sprinkled the skin liberally with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before baking. I will definitely be making this again!

I used boneless,skinless chicken and I browned the chicken with a splash of olive oil and sprinkled paprika, salt and pepper on them.  I also added about 3 teaspoons of minced garlic to onions.  We loved it!  We will be making this again and again!

I got a good deal at the grocery store and had a lot of bone in chicken breasts. It was about two hours before dinner and I had no clue what I wanted to do with these pieces of chicken.  So, I jumped on here and searched for some recipes!  One of the main reasons I picked it was for the fresh zucchini, since I had just bought a good amount.  I read a few of the reviews and did rub the honey, garlic salt, and pepper on the skin.  I didn't have enough basil and no parsley so I substituted with italian seasoning.  I didn't have swiss cheese either but had some grated mozzarella.  I also followed some other suggestions and added more bread (I used wheat). It was abolutely delicious!  I'm sure this recipe followed exactly is incredible as well!  It was so juicy and the skin on top was crispy.  The zucchini/bread mixture was fabulous! It was simple to make and I served it with green beans and brown rice...I have a picky 3 1/2 yr old.  She ate the chicken up! I will definitely be making this again!

Would have rated it higher, but the hubby didn't like it... I used chicken breasts and pounded them till they were flat. Then I rolled the stuffing up inside. It didn't stay very well, but I didn't have breasts with the skin on them. I really liked the taste, but my husband said he wasn't a huge fan. I will make again (because I enjoyed it!) but not too often.

Just OK...my husband and I found it to be very bland and dry. Zucchini and swiss cheese tend to both be bland so I don't think mixing the two did anything to enhance flavor. If I were to make this again I would try a different cheese and probably add chicken stock.

I really like to fix this recipe when I have company.  It's simple to make but looks like you spent hours making.  I used to make this frequently and then forgot about it.  A little thing you can do to give it a really good flavor is to baste the chicken with honey about 15 minutes before the chicken is done.

This was really very good.  I had boneless, skinless breasts, so used them pounded thin.  I used enough stuffing to just be able to wrap the chicken around the stuffing rather than rolling it jelly-roll-style.  Secured with toothpicks and baked the recommended time.  They turned out tender, moist, and we both enjoyed them.  Thanks for a keeper recipe.

Good recipe.  I made some changes as I felt the zucchini and swiss would be very bland.  I added chicken bullion to the onion, butter, basil and parsley before adding the zucchini and then rather that swiss cheese I used a mexi blend of 3 cheeses; I also felt that the chicken was going to be too dry (I used boneless, skinnless) so I wrapped the breasts in bacon once they were stuffed then baked according to the recipe.  I would definately make this again.

Made this for dinner last night and I must say my dh and I both loved it.  I was a little skeptical because zucchini can be tasteless without a mixture of other ingredients, but this was awesome.  I followed the recipe with the exception of sprinkling salt, pepper and garlic powder over the chicken and brushing a little honey over the top of the chicken skin.  Will make again.

I really liked the stuffing mixture in this recipe, but the chicken itself needed more flavor.  I followed the recipe, plus I added a couple of dashes of ground red pepper to the stuffing.  If I were to make this dish again, I would probably brine or marinate the chicken before stuffing it.  TIP: Once your zucchini is shredded, toss it with a little salt and let it drain in a colander or a mesh strainer for at least 30 minutes to help pull more moisture out of it before you cook it.

Made as is but with boneless skinless chicken breast, threw in a diced red pepper that I had and some shredded parmesan with the Swiss and on top.  Awesome!  My husband adored it.

While making this recipe, I initially had low expectations. Surprisingly, the chicken was quite tasty. Not too strong of a flavor but not at all bland like I assumed it would be. Included this recipe in my "All Zucchini Dinner" inspired by Pam-3BoysMama. Served with "Baked Vegetables," "Savory Cheddar Zucchini Muffins," "Zucchini Chocolate Cake," and "Zucchini-Chocolate Chip Muffins" for breakfast the next day.

What a wonderful recipe!!  I didn't venture far from the recipe but as I didn't have a couple ingredients this is what I did do...I used old cheddar.  Next time I will use swiss...think it would be much better, if it could get any better :D  I didn't have fresh herbs so used dried herbs provence but next time will use fresh and didn't use an egg either.  Also used a handful of panko crumbs instead of bread.  Seriously moist...if you don't over grill and just ground a couple turns of salt and pepper and drizzle of olive oil on the skin.  Indirect heat on the bbq ... yummmmmmmmy!!! (I only did two breasts with the bone in...how could you any other way??? so modified the ingredients to reflect :) )

This was great! The only change I made was that I used half mild cheddar and half mozzarella for the cheese cause I forgot to buy Swiss. It was very, very tasty, but I think I needed to add a little more salt. I always under-salt the first time I make a recipe, but I think this recipe needs that amount of salt because the zucchini, etc, is so mild. This was really great with mashed potatoes and dijon-brown sugar glazed carrots. Thanks so much!!

Overall good recipe but needed a few changes.  There's no need for 3 tablespoons of butter.  I cut it back to one and it didn't change the texture or richness of the stuffing at all.  I grated some part-skim mozzarella I had on hand, added sun-dried tomatoes to the zucchini mixture, and also a dash of crushed red pepper. I sprinkled the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika.  It came out great!

This is one of my favorite recipes that I make quite often for company.  I do make a few changes to it though:  I use boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I split and pound with a mallet and roll the filling in, I use jack instead of swiss cheese because that is what I always have on hand, and best of all I add some chopped shrimp to the filling!

Used this as a base recipe for the ingredients I had on hand. I didn't haven any zucchini so I used butternut squash instead. The Swiss cheese didn't come through at all; perhaps a cheddar would fare better with this vegetable. Challah bread was used in lieu of regular sliced bread. I doubled the recipe as I used a whole chicken, which was about 2-3 lbs. Rubbed it with salt, pepper and garlic powder. The whole thing was tossed into the preheated oven and cooked for about an hour and a half, give or take. Would definitely make this again, and definitely try out the original recipe.

Yes, this is pretty good!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it worked fine.  Baked it for 35 minutes and it was perfect.  Otherwise I made as written.  Love the swiss cheese in the stuffing.

This was a phenomenal recipe! I added a clove of minced garlic to the zucchini mixture and I used thinly sliced chicken breasts folded. Beyond that, I followed the recipe as is and it’s definitely a crowd pleaser for my hungry guys. This will be a returning recipe in my house!

I love this recipe!!! As others - I only had skinless chicken breasts. They were huge, so I sliced in half, and pounded them to cutlets. The stuffing is wonderful, but I didn't get much of the Italian flavor from the herbs - they didn't come through. However, the texture was grand, and the Swiss cheese was a hit! My husband hates Swiss cheese, and he still loved it. (FYI - He has no idea it has Swiss in it...). Next time, I will try it with a more traditional stuffing flare with sage instead of basil. Another fabulous idea to use up all that darn zucchini from the garden. Thanks so much!!

This was very good and my whole family loved it!  I've made it several times and it's becoming a favorite!    I did make some changes...  I used Brioche bread slices I found at Walmart and added an extra slice of shredded bread.  I also shredded 3 medium sized zucchini, which ended up being more than the 2.5 cups, and I used a little over a cup of shredded Swiss cheese.  I also used the bone in with skin chicken breasts and I cut the pocket in the chicken for the stuffing, and not under the skin as called for in recipe.  The last time I made it, I spread a half a can of cream of chicken soup on top of the breasts...  it really added a nice flavor!... for those saying it was bland, this will do the trick as it adds the extra flavor.  Otherwise, I lightly spread a little olive oil over the skin and put a dab of butter under the skin, and salt and pepper the top of the chicken.

I have made this recipe about five times now, and it's always really good! I've even used different kinds of cheese and it turns out good every time. I think you really need to use the bone in chicken breast with the skin that really makes it.

This was pretty good. Didn't take too long to make and my boyfriend enjoyed a yummy home cooked meal. The only thing I did differently was butterfly the chicken breast so I could stuff it inside. Result: moist chicken!

This was good, I followed the recipe and it turned out well. I think I had to cook it a little longer but otherwise everything was good. I may make it again when the kids are not around they were not interested in it.

This was a delicious recipe!  I substituted mozzarella cheese for the swiss (it was what I had), and panko crumbs for the bread.  Got rave reviews from the fella, and I think the kiddo even liked it!  Will definitely make this again!

Delicious! I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt pepper & garlic powder before stuffing and added an 8oz can of mushroom pieces when sauteing the onions. I also used mozzarella instead of swiss (what I had in the fridge). The result was fabulous. I will be making this again. Thank you Redteetop for this wonderful addition to my recipe collection.

Chicken came out slightly dry, but was otherwise really good.
