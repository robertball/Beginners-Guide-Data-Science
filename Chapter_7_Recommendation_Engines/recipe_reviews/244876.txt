This is absolutely delicious, the balance of chili and lemon and the sweetness of the carrots blend together nicely. It tastes great cold marinated or baked as a side dish.We baked at 400 F for 20 min to soften the carrots. we dont always use feta cheese but it still tastes great either way. If you can squeeze the juice a fresh lemon it tastes best.  We used coin cut carrots and golden raisins which works well.

I would give this recipe 4 stars as is. I agree that it lacks zing but it is a great base recipe & is easily adaptable to taste.  I have made it twice now & added 1 tablespoon each of cider vinegar &  sugar & a bit of minced onion. Let it marinate overnight for sure & stir it up as often as you remember so that all the veggies get a good soaking in the delicious juices at the bottom. I like it just as well without the feta & don't feel like it's missing anything. This one is a keeper. Thanks BFR610!

The first time, I followed the suggestion of another poster and baked the carrots for 20 minutes at 400ยบ to soften them and release the flavor. The second time I made this was for a picnic, so I prepared it the night before. I upped the cumin and lemon juice. It was delicious and the guests loved it!

Made this as written. It was practically tasteless. The ingredients are definitely healthy but it lacks zing. In my opinion- could use some doctoring.
