These were AMAZING!!!  They were by far the best muffins I have EVER had.  Trust me- you will love this recipe!!  We used pineapple chunks instead of crushed pineapple, as well as light sour cream.  Next time, I'm going to try splenda instead of sugar to see how that turns out!  These were amazing- I can't say enough great things about them!  Fantastic recipe; these muffins are perfection.  UPDATE: I tried them with half splenda and they were delicious.  I also tried making them with crushed pineapple and found I like the small chunks best.  We served them as part of dessert at our Hawaiian party and they were a huge hit!

Call these muffins if you like, but in my mind these "muffins" are CAKE.  Very good cake as a matter of fact.  So delicious I tried to rationalize keeping them rather than gifting them to the people I made them for as a thank you.  I didn't succeed.  I can always make these again - and will. They're insanely good and deliver everything they promise - real tropical pina colada flavors of pineapple, rum and coconut.  I used butter rather than margarine and a full 20 oz. can of pineapple because that's what I had in the pantry.  Maybe that extra pineapple is what made them so especially good, chock full of pineapple in every bite.  The butter and sour cream guarantee richness and a moist, tender crumb. To take these over the top (I mean why waste the drained juice?) I drizzled a simple glaze over the muffins of reserved pineapple juice and powdered sugar.  My only thought, and one I'll be sure to remember as well the next time I make them, is because these are cake and not muffins,  they bake much better at 350 degrees rather than 375.  Even if not necessary, it sure can't hurt to do so.

Great recipie!  Light and fresh muffins that are almost like a cupcake. However, can't really taste the rum, so I suggest doubling the rum extract if you really want that pina colada flavor.  I am not a big fan of rum so this wasn't a problem for me.  I think these would also be good with a maracino cherry ontop or some other mixed fruit in the muffins.

These were delicious, and I am not easy to please when it comes to muffins. I decreased the sugar to 1/4 c, replaced 1/2 c flour with 1/2 c rolled oats, and added 1/3 c chopped pecans to up the nutritional value. They were great--and still plenty sweet for my taste!

These smelled wonderful coming out of the oven!  They are actually quite healthy too with only 1/4 cup of butter and you can use light sour cream with a good result.  They were a bit too pineappely for my taste so if I were to make them again I would definitely reduce the amount of pineapple in half.  I used shredded coconut because it was what I had on hand but think flaked would work better in this recipe.  I also used 1 Tbsp. of actual rum instead of the extract.

Very Tasty muffins! I actually had a fresh "candy" pineapple that I chopped up to use in this recipe. I used butter (softened at room temperature) instead of margarine. I filled up 16 muffin tins about 2/3 of the way. I also sprinkled a little more coconut flakes on top of the muffins right before baking. They baked up beautifully in 22 minutes. The top rounded out nicely like a muffin should with nice golden brown coloring. The coconut and pineapples smelled wonderful while baking! The coconut flakes on top of the muffins toasted up nicely revealing brown toasty edges. The muffins are tasty with the blend of pineapples and coconuts. I like the bits of pineapples and coconut flakes in each bite. However, I might add a little bit more pineapples next time because I like the sweet pineapples in every bite. Both the sour cream and coconut flakes adds a nice moistness to the muffins. I couldn't really detect the rum. However, If you want the rum flavor to really stand out you could increase the amount.

I used melted butter instead of margerine and plain nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream. I did end up adding a little more coconut just because it didn't seem like very much when I added the half cup in. These turned out REALLY moist and the flavor was pretty good (we really liked the combination of the pineapple and coconut in a muffin), though I think I'd want to cut back on the sour cream next time and add something else. Pina Colada Mix, maybe? I think it's almost where it should be. I think it could use a little more rum flavoring, too. I'd like to try these as mini-muffins next time, too.

These are more like cupcakes than muffins, and super light and fluffy! Everyone raved and ate them all up! Changes - used butter instead of margarine, and almond extract instead of rum, 3/4 cup packed coconut and 1 teas. coconut extract as suggested in other reviews. Also, because of their cake consistency, took another's suggestion and baked them for 30 minutes at 350, not 375. Added a little of the coconut on the tops, which browned perfectly. Perfect! Will make them again today, as all are gone!  Beautiful addition to my favorite recipes.  My batter made enough for 16 cupcakes filling cupcake papers almost to the top.  This time I will add some pineapple extract for a stronger pineapple taste, as flavor was mostly coconut, but delicious none the less.

Hands down, these are amazing muffins.  Not sure what i was going to think of the rum, but between the pineapple, rum and coconut it all mixes nicely & so moist and fluffy.  The flavor reminds me of a macaroon cookie.  i also used coconut oil instead of butter. delicious!

I made these last night. Couple of changes - used light sour cream and butter in place of margerine because that is what I had on hand. I also added 1 tsp. coconut extract in addition to the rum.  I made in jumbo muffin pan because we like a bigger muffin. It made 6 really nice muffins.  Very moist but a bit on the heavy side which is fine because we like our muffins like that.  If you are looking for a light fluffy muffin - do not make these.  Will definately make this again and again.

I have used this recipe many times and love how light and fluffy these muffins turn out. I coarsely chop chunk pineapple, use actual rum instead of extract, add a cherry on top and sprinkle a little coconut over the top as well.

An expert I am not, but I have learned important things along the way:Pack coconut.Pack it like you pack brown sugar.That's the proper way to measure.I don't know why it doesn't stress that on the coconut package.To the recipe,'Didn't have rum so added 1/2t almond extract.Increased pineapple to 20oz drained,coconut to 1 1/2c unsweetened;& added an additional 1/2t baking powder&2T oil.The batter seemed dry so I added 1/4c of the pineapple juice.'In oven topped with more coconut&it made 18. I'm anxious! :) Results:These are a light&tasty little muffins!Maybe just a little(just a little)too pineapply but I did use a 20oz can.The coconut extract leaves a nice aftertaste.Almond is subtle,may add more or not.May leave out the 2T oil next time,but not the pineapple juice.The coconut didn't brown as much as I'd like,but it was enough to take it from plain to interesting.They coulda been bigger muffs,but I doubt only 12 unless you have a larger base or you're a bigger fan of cleaning muffin tins than I am.:D Nice! 'Made these for MH for Mom's day 2013.One more note,a pineapple note:Some brands' crushed pineapple really is crushed.While others,Kroger,has larger pieces&crushed.I don't think I'd like as large as tidbits as other suggested.I'm not big on pieces of fruit in cake or muffins anyway - unless blueberries.Kroger brand gives a bit of concentrated flavor without the "oh" or "chew" factor.  :?  :) Family vote: Very good if we were pina colada lovers.No one liked the coconut feel.

wow! so good! I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose, and also used peach yogurt instead of sour cream (because that is all I had) p.s. I added an extra 1/2 tsp baking soda because of the yogurt..
Even with these minor changes, these were amazing muffins, and a little healthier! A definite favorite in my house! next time the only change I would make is to add a touch more rum as we couldn't taste it at all.

My daughter and I loved these!  I did add a 1/2 teaspoon of coconut extract to them since it's one of my favorite flavors.  Next time I'll probably add a touch more of the rum extract too.  Very moist and travels well.  Definately a winner!

I followed recipes as is, and it turned out kinda dry and not super flavorful. I think next time I would add more rum extract, use whole pineapple instead of crushed and more coconut.   I tried this as muffins and as bread. Does not work at all as bread - too crumbly.

These were more like cupcakes than muffins.  I replaced the rum with vanilla and they tasted very good.  Next time I will add some nuts to give it a little crunch.

These are delicious. I did made a couple of alterations: 1/3 cup brown sugar instead of white; almond extract instead of rum (I didn't have any); a small pinch of nutmeg; and 1/3 cup slivered almonds. After combining the wet ingredients, I added the pineapple, coconut and almonds so that they were distributed evenly before adding the dry ingredients. I folded the flour mixture gently into the wet ingredients just until everything was moistened. The results were very good. Thanks for a keeper recipe!

Love, love, love these guys! I even substituted the flour for a gluten free flour mix called "Mama's Almond Blend" and didn't have any rum flavoring on hand, so substituted almond flavor instead. They were amazing!! And... they were the best gluten free muffins I'd ever made. So moist!

Definitely more like a cupcake and I feel that I should be putting cream cheese icing on top - not a bad idea for dessert!

The flavor of these muffins was really off. I had to double the amount of crushed pineapple used in order to taste it at all, and I don't believe the rum extract added a good flavor to the finished product.

Because I had to adjust the ingredients, I ended up with almost double the batter, and the cooking time isn't accurate. 400 degrees is a better bet if you're going to chance it on these muffins, but keep an eye on them.

These were very moist muffins, but they seemed to go flat when I took them out of the muffin tin.  The taste was okay, but I could barely get any hint of rum or coconute which was a shame.

The muffins are wonderful.very moist. I changed it just a little by adding extra rum extract and 1 tsp. of coconut extract.I also used a 20oz. can of crushed pineapple. I used dryed coconut chips in the batter and sprinkled sweetened shredded coconut on top before baking. the topping came out nicely toasted. I also sprayed the cupcake papers with Pam which kept the muffins from sticking to the papers.I will be making these agan..Reminded me of being at the beach.

I really liked these.  Only change was to add some coconut on top before baking.  The rum flavor was almost undetectable after baking and the muffins don't rise very much.  But the pineapple and coconut flavors came through nicely.

I wish I could be anonymous when I give a bad review. I just don't understand all of the good reviews for this. I'm a pretty good baker, and I have never contemplated throwing baked goods in the trash until now. These were *very* heavy and had a decidedly acidic taste- I presume because of the sour cream/pineapple combo. I thought that perhaps they just needed to sit to blend the flavours, but they are still awful. My daughter tried one today and said to me, "I don't want to hurt your feelings, but these are disgusting".

*disclaimer: I did change the recipe slightly. I don't know how this affected the final result, but considering you can generally do these things in other recipes without major changes to the final result,I'm guessing that this is how they would have turned out had I followed the recipe exactly.
-I substituted coconut extract for the rum based on other review, and the fact that the pineapple/coconut ratio seemed off to me. I still couldn't taste the coconut.
-I used 1/8 c. apple sauce and 1/8 c. of oil.
- I used 1/4 c. vanilla yogurt because I only had 3/4 c. sour cream.

Everyone loved this.  I made as a cake in a bundt pan and cooked it for 30 min.  The next time I'll add bigger chunks of pineapple for a more authentic flavor.

These were very nice.  I made them for the kids, so used vanilla instead of rum extract.  Very moist, the kids liked them.  My only critique is that they really should be called cupcakes...too much sugar and there's really no nutritional value-just yummyness!!

I can't say I cared for these much.  They sounded good but it came out to be an odd mix of flavors for bread.  Maybe it was the rum extract but I won't try them again.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now and most people that like it ask me to make it for special occasions.  I put a crumble on top that takes it to another level.

LOVE these muffins!  Use 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of almond extract instead of rum, but it works great and still tastes amazing!! :)

I think this recipe is good. The reason of my 4 star rating comes from a few details that I think can help you avoid disaster. As someone mentioned, it can be "too pineapply". Here is where things get tricky and your recipe can go down south pretty easy. I made this recipe 2X. Like another user mentioned: use half of the amount of pineapple called for. However, more importantly if you use crushed pineapple, PLEASE save yourself a headache and make sure that you drain the liquid well; otherwise, you might end with pineapple custard or a mushy thing that is all but attractive or tasty! Using well drained crushed pineapple and less of it can make a BIG difference. EDIT: I also used 2 tbsp of actual rum when I baked this recipe the second time around. I could not feel the taste of the rum; however, I would not recommend to add more because this recipe can easily become watery and the outcome will be guaranteed to be awful.

I made this as a cake, instead of muffins.  Delicious and moist.  I topped it with coconut buttercream frosting.  I will definitely make this again!

Made these and they are very good.  Will make again.
Put toasted coconut on top 5 minutes before they were done.
Am going to add more flour to see if it makes it more solid the next time I make them.

These were delicious!  I substituted 1/4 cup of applesauce for the butter and doubled the rum flavoring.  Fantastic!  Next time I might substitute Splenda for the sugar and make them really healthy.

Made these today and they were great! A wonderful balance of flavors. I tried the batter before it was baked and it tasted just like a pina colada...Mmmmmmmm!!!!
