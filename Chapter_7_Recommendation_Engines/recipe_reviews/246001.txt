We absolutely loved this dish.  It was easy to make and healthy as well.  I left out the olives simply because I don't like them.  I didn't have fresh cilantro so used dry.  Highly recommend!

I love the concept of this recipe. I made a few changes to suit my preferences and absolutely love it. I cook the veggies and quinoa separate and add garlic and onion powder to taste when cooking the veggies. Then, before I add the quinoa to the veggies i add a can of rinsed and drained cannellini bean. I leave off the olives and cilantro and top with Parmesan cheese instead. I also use more veggies to get a better ratio of veggies to quinoa.

The broccoli did not cook, so I had to separate it out to cook it separately, then add it in again at the end. It made a mess. I also think this recipe could use additional/ stronger seasonings. I love the idea, but it needs some work.

I didn't have any cilantro so I substituted parsley.
It was really good and satisfying so filling we couldn't eat it all.
Will definitely keep it in my healthy eating arsenal.

Delicious and hearty with added grilled chicken!! Can add more seasonings such as rosemary and oregano for added flavor and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese.
