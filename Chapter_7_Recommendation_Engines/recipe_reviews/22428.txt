I usually only do 5 or so green beans per bundle and cut my bacon in thirds. I don't always have time to marinate overnight. I usually sprinkle some garlic powder and pepper over as well. I know that this mentions being an appetizer, but I always have them as a side at dinner.

GREAT! I used fresh green beans, steamed then marinated in Italian dressing. Served them at a dinner party and what a hit! Great flavor.

This was excellent. Of course I used fresh beans though. I had these once in a European resort and searched for a recipe for it. This recipe was perfect.  I don't think you need tothpicks though - just place them seam down. I also only put 8 in the bundle - it was easier to eat.

I love these guys.  I prefer not to marinate overnight, but bake the bundles in the Italian dressing instead.  Yummy.

I used fresh "french" green beans (the small skinny ones).  I did not pre-steam or boil them thinking that they would be small enough to cook all the way through in the oven.  They were a little on the crunchy side!  Also, I would recommend not putting too many in the pan.  I did not leave any space in between the bundles so the bacon only got crispy on the top.  I think this is a good recipe with great looking presentation and I will try making it again with the adjustments I mentioned before.

I made these with fresh instead of canned and I steamed them beforehand, not as salty that way.  I also only let them marinate for about 8 hours.  They were fantastic!

Excellent! I used fresh string beans instead of canned, and I steamed them slightly first and then marinated. Since they were much longer then canned, I used a whole slice of bacon and wrapped in an upwards fashion around the middle so it looked like two or three wraps. My family loved it! They told me, "If you're inviting over someone you want to impress, make these bundles and they'll think you're a professional! Thanks for a wonderful side dish!

These are a staple around my house. (the green bean bundles with brown sugar are too) I find that it is easiest to keep a smaller container full of these marinating at all times. This helps to have them on hand for those nights when we want them and I had not planned ahead.(like a busy mom has time for that!) When I cook them, I use the 2 cans that were marinated, so I just replace them with 2 more. I never liked green beans until I discovered this recipe from my aunt. They are really addictive!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with others. It is truly delicious.

I use fresh green beans. Marinate them overnight in dressing, then steam/simmer for about 10 - 15 minutes and cook as directed. I love these green beans!! Fancy and so tasty.

While my DBF loved them, I enjoy them made with Catalina French dressing better, there's just too much "twang" for me.

This recipe is fantastic. I made it with fresh steamed beans marinated 8hrs. Very impressive presentation, along side glazed carrots for added color.My husband who's a very picky eater raves to everyone  about it. Thanks for sharing.

This was a good recipe.  I used fresh beans.  I took them out of the marinade and parboiled them before putting them under the broiler.  Next time I would cut the bacon in half lenghtwise to make the wrapping easier.

These were quite yummy!  I used frozen "select" green beans.  I liked how the ends of the green beans got extra crunchy but not quite burnt.  They were also very fancy looking.  (I also skipped the toothpicks and just tucked them under).

I would give these a lot more stars if I could! They are absolutely delicious, and super easy.
I also used fresh green beans and only marinated for about 8 hours.

Nice flavors.  Good directions.  1) we used turkey bacon - which turned out fine, but they were fragile little puppies.  2)  We 'oopsed' and didn't make these for dinner as planned, so they marinated two extra days.  When I finally bit into them, they reminded me of eating the pickle in Rouladen (a german dish with meat rolled around seasonings and a pickle......).  I would probably not choose to marinate them that long again to go with a nice, say, steak dinner, but then again, with some German meals, it might be just the thing to do.......

Delicious, but I think I'll pre-cook my bacon a little next time - my bacon was not as done as I would have liked, and the beans were starting to burn.  I liked this appetizer because it ctually contained veggies, whereas so many appetizers are just cheese, meat and fat.

These are great.  I made these along with the Garlic Mashed Potatoes Secret Recipe and the Savory Garlic Marinated Steaks (both on this site) for Christmas and it all looked and tasted fabulous together.  This unique twist on green beans got everyone talking.

Beautiful presentation, great for a dinner party or other special occasion. I thought the italian dressing flavor was just a bit overpowering -- couldn't taste the vegetable over the marinade and the bacon. But my family overruled me and thought the bundles were delicious made according to recipe, loved the flavor that the marinade imparted. I used frozen "select" whole green beans. Next time I may try using less marinade, or marinating for a shorter period of time, although my family would be thrilled if I made this recipe again exactly as written. Would also be fun to experiment with this recipe using different dressings for the marinade, such as a balsamic vinaigrette.

This recipe is so easy, quick and delicious, it was a big hit at Thanksgiving, now I've been asked to make them for Easter.  The nice thing is, is that we are having Easter at my moms house, so I can prepare them at home and only have to use her broiler for 10 mins to make them hot.

Yummy.  It isn't necessary to marinate overnight - just a few hours.  Children who are responsible enough to handle toothpicks can help and love to do so. Never had them cold because there are never any leftovers.

Followed the recipe but found the canned green beans too soft to handle. I will try this recipe again using fresh green beans.

I love this recipe, but I go ahead and bundle these up 1 day in advance and let them marinate in the Italian dressing overnight. Then I follow the rest of the recipe for draining and cooking. So good! Company worthy!

I really like these string beans. Unlike others, I loved the tangy-ness of the beans and so did everyone else. I used fresh beans and let them marinate in a covered container overnight, shaking it up occasionally. I found that if you just lay the beans down over the flap, there was no need for the toothpick. Once the top side was crisp enough, I flipped it. Just be careful to keep an eye on them because the tips will start to burn. I will definitely make these again, and this time I will make extra. Everyone agreed that they went too fast.

We have been enjoying this recipe for many years.   I purchase frozen whole green beans.  I wrap with the bacon as per this recipe but instead of Italian dressing I use store bought Catalina.    I have never served this as an appetizer.   This is an easy recipe to make for a crowd because I can make my bundles several days ahead of time store in the freezer on the baking pans and covered well with foil.  When its time for the oven I pour the Catalina over top sprinkle some course ground black pepper and bake until the bacon is done.    Looks awesome all piled up on an oval platter and the taste is amazing.   Even the kids go back for seconds.

I made these last night w/ Caramel Apple Pork chops and Smashed potatoes, also from this site! The only change I made was to use the cooking directions from the bundles I. They were great! Everyone loved them. One complaint.....I didn't make more:) One of my children said it was the best dinner they ever had and don't change a thing. I love it when the whole family likes something and thanks to you, they loved this.!

After marinating overnight, the beans fell apart when I tried to put them in bundles. My friend, who is a caterer, places the bundles together & then marinates them! Also the dressing was overpowering!

I used fresh green beans, and chopped the bacon and a small onion in it. Par boiled it, [fried the bacon and onion first] then put it in a pie plate and baked it. I think I used to much dressing on it. I made Calzones [ excellent recipe on this sight] I wanted something different besides a side salad, this fit the bill.

Italian is good with these but slightly strong.  I have made these for over 20 years and I have used barbecue sauce on them and they always disappear.  This is a nice before dinner appetizer.

These were pretty good.  Pretty easy to make, good taste, and nice presentation.  Served with Christmas dinner and they were liked.  I only gave a 4 cause they weren't awesome or anything but they are good.

I didn't really enjoy the Italian dressing flavor and I only marinated for about 4 hours. Maybe it was just the dressing I chose. My boyfriend absolutely loved them though so I am going to try and modify and use only olive oil and salt and pepper when I make them for Xmas Eve. I also used fresh green beans and steamed them for about 3 mins before marinating.

Have to agree that the Italian dressing was way too overpowering in taste. Will likely try these again with some olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Presentation was lovely.

Liked this. Used whole frozen green beans and added a little bit of extras like butter, seasoning salt, black pepper, basil, parsley, oregano and Parmesan cheese. Easy to prepare.

This is the same recipe that my ex-mother-in-law uses, and I fell in love with them the first time she fixed them. I love how easy they are to prepare!

I served this with Christmas dinner and they were wonderful! The only change I made was to use fresh green beans steamed "al dente", then marinated. I will make these again, for sure!

I brought this to a fancy dinner party over the weekend and received rave reviews.  I used frozen whole green beans, and marinated them overnight in the dressing.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

I only had time to marinate this for about 40 minutes, just in time for dinner, I also bought the wrong kind of beans, I bought French Cut Green Beans. This was a delicious dish. The bacon really adds to the flavor. Will definitely make again, will be a regular vegetable side dish for dinner.
