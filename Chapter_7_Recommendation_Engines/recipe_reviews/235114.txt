Made this for my husband, and he literally ate the whole bowl. If you like a New Orleans muffuletta, you will like this bruschetta. (It reminds me of a caponata without eggplant). I added pine nuts to the recipe and served on toasted french bread with olive oil and garlic powder. Delish!

This is really good. I used what I had on hand (different salami) and served it on homemade sriracha bread, which added a bit of spice. I couldn't wait to have the leftovers for breakfast - it's addicting if you love sundried tomatoes & calamata olives. I'm going to try it with pepperoni, too!

Really good recipe. A little dry so I added some garlic infused olive oil to it. Next time I might try an olive mix instead of just kalamata olives.
