This can be a great marinade if you don't use all the salt or all the powders!  I cut the recipe in half for a 1 lb. sirloin steak.  I didn't use any table salt and only half of the seasoned salt (basically 1/4 of what the original recipe called for.  I used minced garlic and added 2 Tbsp. of olive oil.  I let this marinate all day.  The result was a very flavorful, tender, smoky cut of steak and sirloin is not the best cut of meat either so I was pleasantly surprised.  I would definitely try this again but on strips or rib eyes.

We halved the recipe and marinaded two 5-ounce filets for about 2 hours and they were incredibly delicious.  It was pretty salty, which I love, but you might want to put 1/2-3/4 the amount of salt in it if you like yours less salty.

This is pretty good stuff. I did cut back the salt to 1 tsp of seasoned salt and whish I would have added just a bit more. It has a good smokey flavor and went through the meat very well. DH grilled these for us and we enjoyed them.

Very, very salty! This recipe has potential but needs tweaked a bit.

We let our frozen chicken breasts sit in this marinade all day and cut them up into strips before baking.  Wonderful!  Thanks!  We will use this marinade often.

For me the flavor is too strong to use as a marinade and I only marinated my steak for 45 minutes!  Think it would work better as a sauce to baste your meat with while cooking.  The flavor is good, 'am trying to think of a way to tone it down a bit.

WAY TOO SALTY.  I was suspicious that it had too much salt, and the results verified it.  It also had too much liquid smoke in it.  It does not need the regular salt and the liquid smoke needs to be cut by 1/2.  The steak was marinated for 12 hours, and probably would have been inedible if  was for 24 hours.

I think this recipe calls for wayyyy too much salt.  After reading the reviews, I decided to cut out the table salt all together and reduce the seasoned salt to just one tablespoon.  Next time I will use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  All the "powders" made the marinade pretty thick.  I like the concept of this marinade, it just didn't work out that well for me.

This was WAY TOO SALTY and I only used the seasoning salt, nota adding the regular. Going by what others said, I thought I'd cut way back on the salt, and our beef tenderloins that I marinated overnight were inedible....What a waste of money!! I'm sorry, but this was AWEFUL!!!

Nice smoky flavor BUT way too salty. I kinda thought it may be so I had reduced the seasoned salt to 2T and increased the garlic powder (we really like garlic.) It was still just on the edge of being too salty to eat. Will definitely make again but decrease the seasoned salt to 1T, maybe add some of my own seasonings and some chopped garlic cloves. Cooked up really well though. Took a photo but my phone apparently doesn't take a large enough file, lol.

I marinated steaks with this and my family did not like them at all. They were too dry and tasted more like low quality beef jerky. Will not be using this recipe again.

I love a salty steak, but this is even too much.  I didn't even use all the salt listed in the recipe and ours was still way too salty.  I only marinated it for an hour, I can't even imagine how bad it would have been if I'd done it overnight.

My husband really liked the flavor of this marinade.  I would suggest decreasing the salt a little as it was too salty for me.

Made this and did not use no where near as much salt. Used only one tsp. Added about a tbsp of pepper. All other measurements as to the recipe. Had to add one cup of water to this mixture as it turned into a thick paste. I will be trying the meal at lunch. Here's hoping.

Used this marinade for 12 boneless chicken thighs and loved how tender and flavorful the meat was. I did however, take the advice of the other reviewers and cut the salt way down to 1 1/2  tablespoons of season salt and no table salt. Next time  I'll substitute the garlic powder for fresh garlic.  Thanks for sharing Chase.

I left out the salt and used only a tablespoon of the seasoned salt. I cooked it with cubed steak in the slow cooker and it was absolutely delicious!

way too much salt. I'm going to try this marinade again but I'm going to omit the table salt and use half or less of the season salt. Hopefully that change will make it taste as good as it sounded when I first read it.
