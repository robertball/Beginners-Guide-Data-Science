This was incredible!  Probably of my favorite recipes on the site thus far.  I made the minor tweaks that many recommended:
1. double sauce recipe (although really 1.5x would have been enough)
2. added 3 cloves minced garlic to sauce
3. cut oil in half and used olive oil vs. sesame

The meat came out so tender and flavorful.  Poured the sauce from the bottom of the pan over the meat and used for dipping.  

Husband loved as well.  Kind of surprised that my kids (11,8) were just ok with it.  I don't care, however, this was so good that they will just have to ok with it!

This was one of my favourite recipes for pork tenderloin. I doubled the recipe, using olive oil instead of sesame seed oil (because i had none) then added chopped garlic and about 1/3 cup melted butter to the glaze and cooked it all together at the same time at the same temperature (350) the whole way through, occasionally basting the tops of the loins using a turkey baster. While eating I gave everybody a little side dish of the sauce to dip their pork into while eating. It was so good everyone drank whatever was left in their side dish! I make this again and again, perhaps using different meats. It's basically a honey garlic sauce the way I made it, I think next time I will do chicken wings! Also, it is better than soya sauce in plain rice!! Compliments to the chef!

My ENTIRE family (down to my 9 month old) loved this dish. Others mentioned that there was too much oil. I love the taste of sesame oil so I went with the full portion. It was great. HOWEVER, when using the juices to make a gravy it was evident that there was too much oil. So, as a marinade and cooking liquid, it's great as is. BUT if you are wanting to finish with a sauce I'd cut back quite a bit on the sesame. I think this would be fantastic on chicken and maybe even a beef roast... YUMMY.

I just got up from the dinner table and this one is a keeper!  It is similar to another recipe that I have that has ginger, garlic and hot peppers in the mix.  I added 2 cloves of garlic and red pepper chilli flakes to the sauce. I also basted it every 5-10 minutes so a lot of the glaze would be on the outside of the pork.  I would suggest adding parchment paper to the pan because of the high sugar content of the glaze.  This will make for easy clean up.  Thanks for the recipe, Mokonak.

This was a fantastic recipe for basting a pork tenderloin.  I doubled the sauce, except for the oil, boiled it after brushing the tenderloin twice during baking, and poured a little over the sliced tenderloin.  I served it with garlic mashed red-skinned potatoes and broccoli with butter and sesame seeds.  Everyone raved!

My husband and I served this last night for our friends, one of which is a very picky eater.  We were all impressed.  The pork was very moist and had a wonderful flavor.  I didn't have any sesame oil, so I substituted olive oil.  It was wonderful.

I tried this recipe because I did not have time to marinade the pork before grilling like I usually do.  I had hoped this would turn out well, what I evened up with was over cooked boiled meat.  I do think the marinade has potental as a marinade though and I may try that.

This was very good. I did alter the recipe slightly as others did. I used olive oil instead of sesame, reduced the amount of oil in  half, and added fresh minced garlic to the sauce. Also, I used half the sauce to marinade the tenderloin for about 2-3 hours, covered and refridgerated, then during cooking I glazed the tenderloin with some of the reserved sauce. I brought remaining sauce to boil, and used it for dipping finished tenderloin! It was fabulous! Strong and rich flavor.

Very yummy!  I made a few changes:  I doubled the recipe except for the sesame oil and used Agave instead of honey.  I marinated this overnight.  Note - watch your cooking time.  Mine was done at 45 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe - I will definately make it again!

This was great, with a few additions thanks to Sweetjam's review.  I added a little ginger powder, 1 large clove of garlic, and red pepper flakes.  I made the sauce a few hours in advance and I thought the flavor was much better after it had sat awhile.  I used 2 pounds of PTL, so I adjusted the recipe accordingly, and I also covered my pan with foil.  I checked the temp after about 30 min. & mine were both done (in fact just a tad bit overdone), so I highly recommend using your meat thermometer if you don't want leather.  Since I had not timed the rest of my meal to be done this quick and they did not have a very good glaze on them yet, I brought the foil up around them to form a boat and poured the remaining sauce over them and let them sit until the rest of dinner was done.  They were fantastic and the sauce, as an au jus, was great too!

This was excellent.  We had 2 tenderloins.  We marinated 1 in orange juice and garlic and the other my brother did in a mesquite chicken and rib rub on the other.  We were going to do a 3rd with this glaze.  We ended up sticking with the 2 and just put the glaze over them.  It was amazing!!!!  I am making it again tonight with a citrus marinated tenderloin.  I am sure it would taste great by itself but you can definitely epxeriment with the flavors.

This was incredibly good and simple.  Pork was tender perfect and excellent flavor.  Followed recipe sauce exactly but only made one 1# tenderloin.  Used extra sauce to flavor a brown rice/veggie stir fry to go with! P.S. My sesame oil was called "Hot" - had a little bite, but good!

Very tender and flavorful - except my glaze was very runny.  I agree with others, I cut the sesame oil to 1.5 Tbs and I did add sesame seeds at the end for a little touch.  Good - I would make again - just not 5 star worthy.

WOW!!  This was super!  Only changes I made was less honey and more brown sugar.  1/2 a TBS Less of Sesame Oil (I love s. oil..and this was plenty!)  I reserved a little sauce to cook on the stove top in case mine cooked down too much - but it didn't. I did tent the meat for some of the time to protect the sauce - but near the end I uncovered it.  This was great!!!!  Better than great!  Oh - in the sauce I cooked down on the stove top I added a bit of oyster sauce..as it is my new favorite thing.  Not necessary - but good none the less!!  FIVE THUMBS UP!!

Delicious pork tenderloin.  I bought a 4 pound tenderloin and cut it in half so I could try 2 different marinades/glazes at the same meal.  This was very good with a nice mild flavoring.  I poured some marinade in a separate container before I started to baste.  I did not want to contaminate the marinade I wanted to use when I placed the meat on the table.  I then basted the loin every 15 minutes while baking.  Mine hit the 160+ degrees right at the 45 minute mark.  I let the meat rest for 10 minutes, then sliced.  I heated the "clean" marinade and served it on the side.  Everyone (company for dinner) enjoyed this flavoring.

Great! I tried sliced baked sweet potatoes just laid along side the tenderloin about half way done and spread a little maple syrup over those - the aroma alone is worth 5 stars. The meal was a hit.

This was just wonderful...I did lower the oven temperature...I cooked it at 350 degrees and used a meat thermometer to judge doneness...I used olive oil instead of the sesame oil...worchestershire sauce instead of the balsamic vinegar...It was incredibly tender...and the taste was awesome.  If sauce begins to burn in pan bottom...just add a little water...A wonderful recipe...

What a wonderful flavor.  This was very easy and the meat came out so tender.  I did substitute the sesame oil with hot oil, we like spicy.  Yum.

The sesame oil was far too over powering in this sauce. My son couldn't eat it and my husband and I both ended up using a teriyaki to dunk the meat in to offset the sesame flavor. I think those who made it with olive oil and a lesser quantity were wise to do so. I will not make this again.

This was amazing. Everyone ate it and the kids were fighting over the last piece. Will double next time. BF asked 3 times if i printed this out for recipe box. Stated this is his new favorite. I did reduce the oil to 1 tablespoon.

Didn't like this at all.  All we could taste was the sesame oil.  And the dish has been soaking for two days and it still isn't rid of the baked on stuff.  Sorry.  Won't be making this again.

Darrrrrn tasty for being so easy to make.  I added some garlic to the glaze as well as about a quarter cup of melted butter-- thickened it up a bit.  Next time I may even try reducing it over heat.  But the flavor was amazing.

Excellent.  Will make again.  I used olive oil instead of sesame, added a clove of garlic, and made extra sauce to use as a dipping sauce.  I forgot to lower the oven temp to 350 and the extra sauce in the pan burned to a crisp, but the pork still tasted good....i didn't realize until the smoke alarm went off after 30 minutes.  It is a good thing it went off, or the pork would have been overcooked

This pork tenderloin is amazing!  I have made pork tenderloin a few times before, but it has always turned out too dry. I read the reviews on this recipe though and it looked promising so I gave it a try.  The only thing I added to the sauce was minced garlic, which made it even more delicious.  I poked several holes in the top of the pork so the sauce would soak through and then poured the sauce on top.  I marinated the meat for about 2 1/2 hours in the refrigerator.  I covered the roasting pan tightly with foil and roasted at 300 degrees for about 1 hour.  The pork was so tender and juicy, even my husband raved about it. He was very skeptical when I told him I was going to try pork tenderloin again because it turned out so dry before.  The whole family loved it though and I used the leftover meat for stir-fry and pork fried rice.  Very yummy!

I have yet to have leftovers of this one. I too used olive oil and only half of the called for amount. Other than that, the only deviation was to cook it a lot slower (about 275 for 2 1/2 hours after the initial 15 minutes at 450) and in a glass casserole dish with the lid on. It just falls apart and the glaze doesn't burn.

This wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped it would be.  I marinated it for 3 hours before baking it and then I basted it every 15 minutes once it was in the oven but I really couldn't taste much from the sauce.  It wasn't bad, just boring.

I followed the advice of previous posters and doubled the marinade.  I also made the following minor adjustments;  1 T. sesame oil and the rest olive oil, I added 1 tsp. fresh minced garlic and will add more next time, I will also add fresh grated ginger next time.
The type and tempurature of your oven is important.  I always use an instant read thermometer.  I have an old electric oven and it took quite a while to get my desired internal temperature of 160 degrees before I removed and then tented the loins with foil.
I served it over organic jasmine rice and it was fantastic!  I will be making this again, and soon.  Thanks go to the original contributor.

I sliced the pork tenderloin, marinated it for 15 minutes, then baked 10 minutes at 450 and another 10 at 350,in a foil lined baking pan, basting it twice.  My son LOVED it and he's a picky eater.  My husband & I enjoyed it also.  Not having a sticky pan afterwards was a big plus for me.

I made this tonight for dinner and my husband is kind of picky and he loved it as well as myself. I added all the ingredients but the balsamic vinegar and the only kind I had was rice and red wine so I added 1 and 1 of those two. Turned out great! The tenderloin was so tender and flavorful. This will definitely be a favorite of ours. Had sauce left over that i refrigerated. Loved to dip the meat in some of the cooked sauce as well. Thanks for the recipe. A "KEEPER"!!

Made this and another dish for my parents for dinner last night. My Dad is a very picky eater he only likes beef, so I didn't expect him to even try this. I made the sauce and marinated the meat for about 7 hrs then pan browned it, made a second batch of sauce but with no soy sauce in it added good 1/2 cup of water and then baked it. When it was done I sliced up the pork and thickened the sauce with a good tablespoon of cornstarch. He loved the meat it was very tender and with the sauce he never even ate any of the other beef casserole dish I had made also. My 4 yr olds also loved it!!!!

5 stars for the cooking method!  It came out moist and very flavorful.  3 stars for taste, unfortunately.  I have never cooked with sesame oil.  I don't like it.  It is VERY strong and overwhelming.  If I tried this recipe again, I would use some other type of oil.  I will definitely use the cooking method when making pork tenderloin from now on.

This had too much Sesame flavor for me, reminded me of Poke.  I think I'll try it again with Coconut Oil or just Olive Oil.

This was fabulous, but I did make a few additions/changes. I love sesame oil, but reduced it to 1 tablespoon. I added garlic and a little ginger, marinated for just over an hour (my boyfriend couldn't wait any longer :), and it turned out FABULOUS! I didn't have to cook it as long at 350 either, maybe just 20-25 minutes and it was perfect. I served it with white rice and balsamic glazed carrots. Yummy!!

this recipe was easy and taste was great. My family loved it. My picky 5 year asked for seconds. I did make some changes I used olive oil instead and doubled the sauce. I also added 1/4 cup of water to the pan it kept it from sticking and drying out. I also covered it for the first 30 minutes and I added mince  garlic.  This is a keeper

Really delicious. As another reviewer suggested, I used olive oil in place of sesame oil because I didn't have any on hand. Still turned out delicious. The sweet and tangy flavor is a great accent to the pork. I will definitely make this again!

Love, one of my staples for Sunday or special dinners, no complaints.  I season the pork with s/p and sear it first on all sides first then I stick in the oven.  Will try with garlic next time.

Loved this recipe.  I doubled everything except the sesame oil (as per reviewers suggestions).  I used an instant meat thermometer so not to overcook and I'm glad I did. The tenderloins I had were thin and were done in 25 minutes plus the initial 15 minutes at 450.  Meat was juicy and tender.  Great recipe...even my pickiest eater loved it.

Very tasty.  I added a couple of cloves of garlic and it reminded us of honey garlic wings.  Didn't need to double the sauce.  Will make again with jasmine rice on the side next time.

I've used the glaze recipe on both pork and shredded chicken. Only change: used 1.25 tbs sesame oil instead of 2. 

Glaze goes great on both. Husband and baby were absolutely drooling over it.

This is fantastic!! When I have guests over, this is what I serve. I usually make 3 times the amount of sauce and baste every 15min with the extra sauce and pour over the rest when its out (its that good). So tender, so amazing!

Very easy, and good, I made a few changes, I added two crushed garlic cloves to the sauce, and I Marinated the pork in the sauce for about and hour, I also placed tin foil over the top loosely, to keep the sauce from burning. Each oven is different, and my oven cooked this very quickly.  Everyone loved this, the sauce just put it over the top to excellant!  Will make again and again.

The very best pork tenderloin I've ever made. It was so tender! I followed the recipe except for the fact that I used olive oil. After cooking, I sliced down and ran it through the juices. YUMMY!

This glaze was delicious!  My only recommendation would be to cook the pork to tempurature, not by time since ours came out a little dry which was my mistake.  The glaze was easy and very tasty!

Wonderful!  Instead of using pork tenderloin I used pork brisket, which is flat pieces of pork.  I marinated them in the glaze and left some out to brush on during grilling.

This was a good recipe for pork tenderloin.   I added chopped garlic and a little crushed red pepper flakes to the marinade and baked it in the oven @ 350 degrees for 40 minutes.  It was still moist, but I think I could have reduced the cooking time by 5 or 10 minutes.  I will use this marinade again and again.

Spectacular! It began after everyone had a small taste of the sauce, continued as the wonderful aroma filled our home, and climaxed during the first bite. I prepared the tenderloin according to the recipe, but doubled the sauce as recommended by others. What a hit! I asked each person in my family to rate the dinner, and they all said 5 stars (including myself). It was so simple and quick to make. I couldn’t believe I cooked such a wonderful dish. Give it a try – you won’t be disappointed!

This was just OK.  Even with the tons of modifications (added garlic, ginger, cracked pepper, etc) still lacked on some flavor.  Good basic start for a recipe, but it needs more.

I followed the recipe exactly, even though I was a bit shocked by the amount of honey that was called for.  The end result was very tasty, but the sauce definitely began to burn.  Not sure how to avoid that in the future...if i should just add the sauce later, or cover the pan?

My whole family, and my boss' family loved this recipe!  I had to work all day so I wasn't able to cook it in a roaster for 2 hours.  Instead, I put it in the crock pot while I was at work.  Talk about tasty and tender!  The meat also made great sandwiches the next day for lunch!

Marinated for about 3 hours, then cooked at 450 for 15 minutes, covered with foil.
THEN pulled back foil and poured marinade over pork tenderloin and basted every 10 minutes.  Only took a TOTAL of 25 minutes to cook. (Thermometer read slightly under 160 when I removed pork from oaven) I was cooking a 1.5 lb. pork tenderloin.  Let sit for 5-10 minutes in pan with juices, covered with foil. Checked temp again and it read a little over 160.  Came out VERY moist and tender. Mild flavor, but VERY good.

I thought this recipe was great. I did a few extra things to make it excellent. 

First, I brushed the tenderloins with olive oil. 

Then, I applied a rub that consisted of Brown Sugar, Chili Powder, Paprika, Granulated Garlic, Allspice, Salt and Pepper. 

Third, I seared the tenderloins on each side to seal in their natural moisture before roasting. With the rub on them and the searing, the flavor is already going to be great. But the glaze in this recipe is fantastic.

Instead of 2 tablespoons sesame oil, I did one Sesame and one Olive Oil. I'm glad, because Sesame would have been overpowering.

I also added an extra tablespoon of Brown Sugar.

This turned out to be the most tender pork I've ever eaten. The knife sliced through like butter.

awesome.

I loved this recipe and look forward to making it again! I didn't bake the tenderloin, I marinaded it in the glaze for 2 hours, then grilled it. I saved the marinade and created a reduction sauce by simmering on stovetop and adding 2 tablespoons butter and 1/8 cup chicken stock until thickened to your liking. The pork tenderloin was grilled on medium-high for about 10 minutes on each side for medium. Drizzle sauce on pork and side dish (white rice), serve. You will love this recipe and it's so easy to make!!

YUM!!!  This was so easy to make.  I prepped it and froze it, then popped it out of the freezer and into the crock pot.  I didn't have a tenderloin, but used pork chops instead.  Such great flavor!  I'll be adding this recipe to my line-up.

Great recipe and excellent sauce.  Be sure to watch the thermometer as mine went a bit past and the meat was a little too dry.  I would take it out sooner and cover in foil till it reaches 160.

I thought this was GREAT! I made it for my parents and we all really enjoyed it. The only thing I changed was- I used olive oil instead of sesame. I loved it! I will use the sauce also on some chicken.

I did not have all the ingredients on hand to cook this exactly as the recipe called for. I also seared the meat first and added add'l seasoning since there seemed to be a lot of comments about how bland the meat was. Mine came out fine. The left overs were especially good.

I cut back a little bit on the sesame oil, and made sweet potato mash to go with it. My boyfriend and I enjoyed it a lot! Plus it was pretty simple to do, so I will definately make it again.

I really couldn't taste much over the sesame oil, I marinated it while I was at work and perhaps that was a mistake.  I was surprised because I usually really like the taste of sesame oil. I'd be willing to try it again using a different oil.

We tried it for the first time because it reminded us of a recipe we loved and lost. It was really good! We will definitely make it again! Actually, I just joined Pro, used the menu planner(love it!) and put it on for this week :) We used 3 tsp already minced garlic, olive oil instead of sesame, and doubled the sauce. These were ideas from other reviews. Next time I think we will try a little less sauce and another tsp of garlic.

We really loved this pork tenderloin.  Moist and flavorful, and so very easy.  I followed the recipe and cooking method to a "T" and wouldn't change a thing!  Oh, I used a 1.25 lb tenderloin.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

Had to sub vegetable oil for sesame oil and apple cider vinegar for the balsamic because I didn't have either of those and it still tasted great. Will be doing this again.

Cooking time is too long! Maybe 5 @ 450, then 25 - 30 @ 350. Check temps after that!

Like other reviewers, I marinated the tenderloin for about 5 hours and wished afterwards I'd gone for 24 hrs.  I made 2 times the honey glaze sauce but cut the oil in half and cooked the tenderloin in the marinate, basting the meat several times.  I didn't use sesame oil (mine was a funny color and I discarded it), but used a bit of hot chili oil with EVOO.  I did not follow the cooking instructions and cooked at 325 for about 50 minutes until the internal temp was about 150 (my normal way to cook). We will have this again and add a corn starch slurry to the glaze when the tenderloin rests for use in stir fry noodles.  We will have again when we're taking a break from our normal pork tenderloin recipe.

Made this for the New Year's for two picky eaters: my mom who doesn't like exotic food very much and has an issue with chewing hard-ish meat and my boyfriend who likes food with lots of flavor. And wadaya know, they both liked it! The meat was not too hard for mom to chew, and boyfriend liked the unusual combination of flavors in the sauce. He did suggest, however, that next time I cook it for a couple minutes less to make the meat more tender. Other than that, there were no complaints, and that made me very happy! As for myself, I also liked it, especially after pouring the sauce from the pan over the meat. Yum! Oh, and I did use Worcestershire sauce instead of balsamic vinegar, as one of other reviewers suggested. I believe I used 1.5 Tbsp of W sauce and about 1/2 tsp of the vinegar because I didn't want the sauce to have that sharp flavor that the vinegar lends.

Now this is good!  I doubled the sauce recipe, except the oil, and I used olive vs. sesame.  The cook time was spot on, and the meat was tender and juicy.  My fiance raved about it, and there was just enough left to pack for both of our lunches tomorrow.  I'll definitely make this again.

Extremely moist! However, I didn't find the taste overly strong. Everyone absolutely loved how moist it was, so that seemed to counteract the lack of taste. I'd definitely make it again.

Edit: I made this a second time, not realising I had made this before and I cut back the sesame oil as other reviewers suggested (I had wondered why I had sesame oil!) and I only used one pork loin so technically the sauce was doubled. It was MUCH better this time. I salted and peppered the pork during the first 15 minute roast.

I let mine marinate in the sauce for about 2 hours, room temp.  Served it with an edamame pilaf and sesame green beans with roasted red pepper.  Yum!

I made this last night for some friends and they couldn't stop talking about how good it tasted.  I double the sauce recipe and added 3 garlic cloves and marinated the pork for about 3 hours (that's all the time I had) I grilled it for 20 minutes turning it every 5 minutes and the pork was juicy and tender with lots of flavor.  Will make it again for sure.

Everyone loves this. I followed the recipe but added a clove of minced garlic to the sauce. I pan seared the tenderloin then baked it at 400 for 15 minutes. Then I let it rest, sliced it and let it sit in the sauce. It reheated well for latecomers! Yummy.

Easy, and quick.  Although instead of roasting at 450, i browned down the tender loins in olive oil, then skipped to the roasting at 350 part for about 35-40 minutes (until registered at 160).  Delicious!

Not the greatest recipe for us. Found it quite bland. Would probably not try it again. Went according to the recipe and expected it to taste better. Will put the leftovers for this into stir fry to enhance the taste  a bit.

This was ok. I served it when i had last minute company and everyone seemed to eat it, some people had seconds, but nobody really complimented it. I will make it again for my husband and son because one of my sons ate it well and it was super easy. (I am a vegetarian myself and prefer not to handle the meat too much, which is why I chose this one...no searing required)

I followed the suggestions and added garlic and ginger.  I like that it tasted so great without a long marinade.  My hubby loved it, so we'll be making it again. I might try it with rice wine vinegar instead of balsamic next time.  The meat was delicious but I did not re-use the sauce because it burned in the pan.

The flavour of the sauce was delicious. However, even with basting frequently, you couldn't taste much of the sauce on the meat. If I make again, I'll definitely marinate the pork for a couple of hours beforehand. Also, keep a close eye on the pork - mine was done after about 40 minutes or so.

I prepared the recipe exactly as written.  The pork was tender and flavorful.  My husband and I loved it and even had some left over the next day for pork tenderloin sandwiches!  It is easy and quick to prepare; I will use this recipe again.

This was a delicious meal. I made it with pork chops since I didn't have tendeloin. So I didn't need to cook it as long. I also added about a tbl. of Worcherstershire. I wasn't sure if I was going to like this meal at first because of the soysauce smell was strong, but as it was cooking the smell became less strong and wonderful. It tasted like a good chinese dinner. Very tender meat. Both of my picky boys ate it. It's nice to have an alternative to my normal pork recipe. Will make this again.  Thanks

Unsure about this one. I substituted the sesame oil for olive, and marinated the pork in the sauce. I cooked it as directed and it smelled horrible. Ended up tasting ok.. but kinda 50/50 on whether I'd make again.

My husband never liked pork tenderloins until I made this recipe.  It's definitely a keeper and a family favorite.  I usually don't have sesame oil, so I use 1 tbsp of olive oil instead and the sauce is so yummy!  I also often double the sauce, then pour the remainder over the leftovers and it keeps the meat very tender and tasty for days.  Thanks for submitting!

Great recipe - I followed the others advice and doubled the sauce, added 2 cloves of garlic, 1/4 c melted butter, and poured the sauce over the pork as it cooked (after the initial 15 min). I basted every 10 and it only took 25 minutes for pork to be cooked.  I let it rest for 10 minutes and then cut the pork and let it soak in the sauce. Delicious!

There were absolutely no leftovers. I cooked this with roasted potatoes and fresh cream corn. It was fabulous. However next time I will put aluminum foil under the meat. It was hard to clean up. I also used worstershire instead of vinegar.

I don't know why this recipe is called "Honey Glazed". It doesn't have any homey in it at all. lol  We weren't impressed by this one at all. I won't be making this again any time soon.

My family loves this recipe! I've made it twice. The 1st time I made it as the glaze using Rice Wine vinegar in place of the Balsamic vinegar and added 2 cloves of garlic (as others mentioned). The 2nd time I used the glaze (same as above) as a marinade for a couple of hours and then cooked it in the marinade, basting every 15 minutes. Thanks!

This recipe was AWESOME!!!!  My whole family could not get enough of it!  This is the second time I am making it, so I had to leave a review this time.  I did like some of the others and cut the oil in half and did not miss it at all.  This was so tasty!!  I would love to try this same marinade with chicken wings or maybe a whole ham, etc.
Thanks!!  SO TASTY!!!!!!!!!!!! YUMMMMMMM!

Very good recipe, although I agree with other reviewers-- you have to make at least twice as much sauce, unless you thicken by adding brown sugar that has been melted with a little water to make a syrup. That way when you baste the pork tenderloin, it doesn't just drip down onto the pan. It worked for me and it makes a nicer and crunchier "crust" on top. Overall, very tasty and easy to make.

Great flavor.  I marinaded my meat with double the recipe, like recomended by other users, and it came out so moist and tender.  I also reduced the glaze while the meat rested.

I loved this recipe. It is so easy and everyone loved it. I have a 5, 3 and 1 year old and a picky husband. I did double everything but the vinegar and oil. I do not like things to have a vinegar taste so I used what it called for in this recipe 2 Tbsp. I used 1Tbsp of sesame oil and doubled the other ingredients of honey, soy sauce and brown sugar. I added three cloves of fresh garlic. These things were suggested by others. I love honey so I just added more to the top of it while eating it as an extra dipping sauce to the leftover sauce in the recipe. My oven is small so I only cooked mine for an extra 40 minutes instead of 45. I think I will brown it in the skillet next time and cook it at 350 in my oven for about 45 and then check it instead of putting it my oven on 450. It was a little overcooked in parts but I think it is because my oven cooks quicker than most. Try it! You will love it. Thanks for the recipe!

We marinated the pork for several hours in the fridge and it turned out great. Have made several times and always turned out well.  Only change was we used olive oil instead of sesame oil.

This was very good, complimented by my husband and devoured by my kids.  I made very minor changes--olive oil instead of sesame oil, and roasted at 500 degees for 25 minutes.  The pork was very moist and flavorful with a nice glaze to it.  The high cooking temp always works well for me with pork tenderloin, but if you cook it this way be sure to line the pan with foil or it will be extremely difficult to clean!

This has a very nice flavor, but I believe the cooking time is too long. 
 Our tenderloins reached 160o after 25 min. @350o  We like pork a tiny bit pink, so 150o might have been better.

Sorry but I thought that this recipe was only okay.  It did not have much flavor.  I ended up adding garlic, Dijon mustard, and some hot sauce to try to give it a kick, and it was still only okay.  Maybe more Balsamic?

My hubby and I loved this recipe. I didn't have any sesame oil, so I used a little olive oil (used less than the recipe called for because of what some of the other reviews said.) It turned out delicious and incredibly tender. This was my first time cooking a pork tenderloin, and I was impressed with how simple and delicious this turned out. Great recipe!

This is such a hit!  My boyfriend is always asking me to make this.  It's so simple and easy.  Substitute olive oil if you're out of sesame - it's still a great taste.

This was pretty good.  The kids weren't all that fond of it though!  I was hoping for a more honey sticky type glaze but I found it to be a very liquidy glaze that dried up as soon as I basted the meat.  When I cut the pork to serve it the meat was nice and juicy inside. I found the cooking time to be dead on.

This was delicious, simple, and everyone loved it.  I tend to like my pork a little less done, so next time, I would probably cut back on the cooking time.  My husband spooned leftover glaze on his pork.  Something I will definitely make again.

This was okay. Not quite what I had expected. The sauce burned like crazy in the roasting pan, due to the sugar I guess.My husband and daughter did have seconds so not a total loss. Will keep dearching for that one great tenderloin recipe.

I just served this dish to the family that I work for (I'm a nanny). The girls, ages 4, 7 and 9 were raving about it with their first bite. I served it with LIPTON SIDEKICK butter and herb pasta, and a nice (but small) spinach salad.

Great recipe.  Received rave reviews from my guests.  The sauce is delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes and the sauce was great over top the potatoes too.  For those that thought the pork was overcooked, maybe you didn't reduce the heat after 15 minutes?

Loved the recipe, seasoned my port with garlic salt and pepper.  The sauce made a mess in the baking pan, burning because of the sugars.  Any suggestions for the next time?

OMG!! This one ACTUALLY got me to write a review. I used apple cider vinegar and avocado oil (out of necessity) I can’t believe it didn’t marinade at all! So tender and juicy. I also coated it with Montreal steak seasoning and celery seed.  The ONLY way I’ll eat a tenderloin from now on!

Though the glaze was good, the cooking time is so off.  This was done in 15 minutes and was still not juicy. This is with a reduction in temp. Won't make again.

Did not have balsamic or any kind of vinegar on hand unfortunately. Even so, it was just OK. I don't think the vinegar makes or breaks the recipe. I added minced garlic like other people suggested. It's a good recipe if you don't have time to marinate your pork, but it wasn't like... wow with flavor or anything. It wasn't bad either. It was just OK. The sauce didn't really have time to get into the pork, so only the outside had any flavor on it. If you have the time and a pork tenderloin you need to use, I'd recommend marinating the pork for some hours... but if you need something quick, this recipe is alright.

It was ok, but all that marinade didn’t make it any more delicious than if I had just prepared it with simple salt and seasonings.

I followed the cooking instructions and the pork was way overcooked. Next time, after I reduce the heat, I will cut the cook time in half. The flavor of the sauce was quite good, but I would put a little bit less balsamic and will marinate the tenderloin as I didn't think the flavor went all the way through and needed to add a bit of salt after I sliced the meat.

I made the sauce as directed but added a teaspoon of minced ginger and a teaspoon of minced garlic.  Marinated for 4 hours and then baked at 350° for 45 minutes.  Excellent flavor.

I used olive oil and acv as well as added a few minced garlic cloves to the sauce. after the first 15 mins I just poured the sauce over the meat and baked for 30 mins- basting every 10 mins. after the meat was rested I sliced it and returned it to the pan juices. it was great!

Loved this!  I made it exactly as the recipe indicated and it was so delicious.  I did not find this recipe too oily at all.  The best part was my husband chowing down two full plates before he uttered a word.  This indicates a huge success in our house!  Thank you for this great recipe!!!

Made this tonight.   Absolutely amazing!!  I did cut back on the cooking time about 10 minutes and it was moist and delicious..  I used one 2 lb pork tenderloin and did add some garlic to mixture.   Basted every 10 minutes.  I put the pork over mixed greens with red wine vinegar, tomatoes, onions and feta.   It was was excellent.   My husband who is a meat and potato man raved about it.  Def a keeper.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!!! The meat was so tender, although I had to cook it 20 mins longer but that's probably because the pork was larger, and the sauce was delicious! It smelled up my house like a barbecue. I also used olive oil because I didn't have sesame oil.

I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand. The only change was that the meat was done according to my meat thermometer at 30 minutes. Next time I might marinate the meat in the sauce first since it was so delicious. Great recipe.

We loved this recipe! I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I substituted 2 tbs of cider vinegar mixed with 1 tsp sugar. I also followed other reviews and cut the oil down to 1 1/2 tbs. I think next time I will try 1 tbs because it was still a little on the thin side. Thank you for a great recipe, we will be making this again :-)

Seared the fatty side of my roast first (so I didn't put it at 450 for long) and sprinkled with steak seasoning but otherwise didn't change it. Very tasty! Made a nice saucy gravy from it also.

I'm not a real fan of sesame oil, so I took the advice of other reviewers and cut that to one tablespoon.  The marinade ran right off the roast, leaving it pretty bland.  I kept basting hoping for a "glaze", but ran out of marinade and had to make a 2nd batch.  Again, I took the advice of other reviewers and used the sauce from the bottom of the pan as a topping for the meat on the plates after serving.  That made it delicious and earned this recipe a 4 star review.

I have made this several times, it is always a big hit in my house! Too often I decide to make a pork roast for dinner mid-day while at work; no time to marinate a roast. Which makes this recipe perfect for me! It is delicious; tender and very flavorful. I usually serve with rice, as the sauce is wonderful.

I made this today and was very disappointed in the end product.  Cooking time was too long for my tenderloins as they came out very dry.  I didn't like the taste of the glaze too much but I went ahead and basted it with this glaze anyway hoping maybe the cooking when change it to sweet and sour taste I was imaging when I found the recipe.  End result was an overcooked piece of meat that had very little taste .  Sorry to rate this so low but I just can't give it any higher mark.  The loins didn't even look good, looking more like they had been boiled than baked.

I have made this recipe many times, I have substituted different vinegars and oils depending on what I had on hand.  I baste the meat regularly when it roasting.  Very flexible recipe, and very tasty!

I loved this recipe, flavor was so good!  To be fair, I used Worcestershire sauce instead of balsamic vinegar,  just a preference of ours.  I did lower the temp a bit as well. Will definitely be keeping this one.

1st, I only had a 1.5 lb. tenderloin.  2nd I didn't lower the temp, I forgot but didn't cook as long.  I had a little glaze left because of the size I guess.  I made it with olive oil instead of sesame oil and used low sodium soy sauce.  The whole thing turned out delicious and I will make it again, thank you for sharing.

My 9 year old, picky eater loves this! She usually won't eat any meat with a sauce, apparently sauce ruins the meat. :) But this is one she'll eat over and over, we make it according to the recipe, it's so easy I don't need to change it. The only thing I do differently (because I didn't read through the first time) is baste. I just cook the thing in the sauce from start to finish, I do start at the higher temp and then lower it after 10 min as instructed.

I thought this was really yummy!  I served this with brown rice and stir fry veggies.  The sauce really made the rice and veggies delicious, too so I will double it next time.  My hubby didn't love this as much as I did, but I think that might be because I stole all of the sauce.  Oops!  I did add 3 tsp of minced garlic to the sauce and only 1 T of sesame oil.  I boiled the remaining sauce left over at the end for the rice and veggies.  I also basted my pork every 15 mins.  YUM!

Very flavorful and simple to prep. I marinated for 5 hours and it soaked the meat nicely. I put about a teaspoon extra of brown sugar and honey to cut the salt form the soy & sesame.

First time making a pork tenderloin.  Had to avoid the soy sauce so I added honey instead and used golden balsamic vinegar.  Turned out perfect.  Watched the meat and monitored the internal temperature.  Took it out of the oven about 10 minutes earlier than the directions because internal temp had reached 160 degrees.  Turned out perfectly juicy with a mild sweet flavor from the glaze.  Everybody loved it!

I used this as a marinade, as it has similar qualities to other marinades I've used. I added 2 Tbsp Worcestershire, and 3 cloves minced garlic in the bag with the rest of the ingredients.

Definitely a keeper. My husband raved over it. He had leftovers the next day on a sandwich with mayo. The pork went really well with my homemade creamy cucumber salad. Great recipe!

After reading the reviews, I doubled all the sauce ingredients but the sesame oil, only used 3 tablespoons oil and added minced garlic. I followed baking instructions, reducing heat after 15 minutes, but cooked the meat on a rack, turning and basting liberally every 15 minutes. I removed meat to cutting board, tented with foil then poured the rest of the sauce into the roasting pan and made a reduction sauce to serve on the side. the whole family agreed this recipe is a keeper! Thank you so much for sharing.

I followed suit of most people and doubled the sauce while using olive oil instead of sesame seed. Not sure what the difference was but I tried it this way and was very happy with the outcome! I cooked mine about 15 extra minutes to compensate for opening the door to baste and it came out perfect. Will definitely do this one again.

Followed recipe exactly except poured  sauce in pan & over meat without occasional basting. Wonderful especially if you used remaining sauce as dipping sauce. I may add granulated garlic next time.

Fabulous sauce! I only used one pork tenderloin and it was done in about 20-25 minutes (during the 350 degree part). I also used only half the specified amount of sesame oil. If I was doing 2 pork tenderloins, I would double the sauce. Great for dipping, and I poured it over the rice, yum!

Took others suggestions ad added 1 1/2 times the sauce. Added 3 cloves crushed garlic and used olive oil instead of sesame. Added the sauce at the start of the baking process and baked on 350 degrees for one hour. Very tasty.

I marinated this in the sauce (after doubling the ingredients but halving the sesame oil).  It sat in the fridge for about 4-5 hours, then I got caught up in an appointment so had no time to roast it.  I then cut it up into small (1.5 inch) slices and cooked it on the stove, in the marinade.  Took the pork out and thickened with some cornstarch.  Sauce is very strong, but the pork was tender and my family LOVED it.  It cooked up in 20 mins or so and actually my 17 year old cooked it for me.  She added some soy sauce to the end product cause she likes more tangy than sweet.  Will make again, we love pork tenderloin!

Pretty good, everyone liked it. Be careful not to overcook and have it get dry.

The meat was fairly tender, but I was expecting it to be more flavorful.  Definitely tasted better after drizzling the glaze over the meat after slicing.  This was my first time ever cooking pork tenderloin so I didn't know what to expect and I think it turned out pretty good.  I should mention that I did not have sesame oil and substituted canola oil instead. Perhaps that would have made a big difference.

Superb recipe, it should be de-glaced the pan to obtaint the maximun flavors of the sauce. For a more aromatic finish use honey instead of sugar.

Moist and tender.  This roast was delicious.  I added black pepper, garlic, paprika, and onion spices to the sauce mixture.  I also substituted olive oil and apple cider vinegar for the sesame oil and balsamic vinegar respectively.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

This was a great recipe. I am not a pork fan, but this was very tender. I too doubled the liquid recipe, (really you only need x1.5). My husband loved it.  With the left over liquid, I added some flour and made a bit more of a gravy, rather than an au jus. It was quite sweet, so you only need a little, but it was really nice. I made sure I took the pork out every 10-15 mins to baste.

I just made this tonite for dinner. I did marninate it for three hours before putting it in the oven. I also cut the sesame oil in half. Since I didnt have balsamic vinegar I used one tablespoon of red wine vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon of sugar as a sub. I did double the sauce and served it with brown rice. This is really really good, even my hubby loved it ! Will defintely make again !

Really good but not flavourful enough for me. Maybe if I made the marinade into a glaze to serve with the pork it would be great.

I really liked this one as did our youngest son, my DH said he didn't care for it.  I'm going to try it one more time.  I added garlic to the sauce, otherwise made it as written.

Yum! This was the easiest recipe ever. I had one pork tenderloin to use up so I just halved the honey and used tsp instead of tbsp. for the ingredients. Turned out very good.

I was looking for something different and came across this one. It was excellant!! I added a about a 1/2 tsp crushed pepper flakes for a bit of a kick!(as well as the garlic and onion powder someone else recommended.) Fabulous!! I will certainly keep this one handy, I will try this on other meats as well. thanks for sharing!

Ok so I first thought that I could marinate this in the bag and then cook it. That is a big NO with a capital NO. The honey started to burn. So I put in another dish and followed the directions. Turned out really good. Now if I can just get this burned honey out the bottom of my pan. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent easy recipe!  I didn't have any sesame oil, and didn't want to pay $11 for some, so I substituted olive oil. I also used boneless pork chops instead of pork loin.  My family loves them!

Pretty good! I didn't have any honey, but I added honey bbq sauce instead and used olive oil instead of sesame and I also added minced garlic. Next time I'll try the recipe step by step just to see the difference!

I kept the sauce measurements the same as stated, but only used one 1 lb tenderloin as there are only 2 of us eating.  I had to sub olive oil for the sesame oil since I don't keep sesame oil on hand.  This was tasty and simple.

Absolutely fantastic!  I've made this twice and used the marinade also for a pork roast!  My family loved it.

My tenderloin actually marinated in this sauce for 2 days and I would give 5 stars for flavor- but mine turned out a bit more dry than I expected, thus only 4 stars.  The flavor was spectacular, and it smelled sooooo good while it cooked.  My boyfriend loved it- so for that I will definitely be making this again.  One change I will make- I will reserve some of the marinade for dipping sauce as others suggested before.  Thanks for a great recipe- now we have some definite variety with our pork loin!

Excellent! Tangy and delicious..didn't take long at all... the best thing was you can use the left overs for stir-fry the next day. Add some vegetables, make another dose of the sauce and you're good to go!!

This recipe is decent as is, but this time around I made some changes.  I found the original quite sweet, so I cut back on the honey and added an extra tbsp each of balsamic and soy sauce.  Also added a clove of garlic and some ground ginger (didn't have fresh), then marinated overnight.  I didn't have time to bake it, so I sliced it into coins and pan-fried, first to brown and then added the marinade and simmered for a bit to reduce the sauce.  Served over quinoa with red pepper and brocolli.

This was fantastic!  I kept everything the same except I doubled each of the ingredients and added two crushed cloves of garlic. I marinated the tenderloins (2 lbs total) for a few hours then put everything in a roasting pan. I basted the tenderloins twice. There was plenty of the fabulous sauce leftover for the meat and some to go with roasted potatoes.

It was good, but I have had better.  The honey was nice.  This would be good with a picky crowd -- very non-offensive.
Thanks for the post.

I definitely think you need to marinade this before putting it in the oven.  I marinated for over an hour, next time I'll probably do an overnight marinade.  The meat was tender and delicious but overall it wasn't a wow dish, nevertheless, it was a good one.

My family really enjoyed this recipe!  I added some minced garlic as a previous reviewer suggested.  I also sliced the temderloin and returned it to the pan, so the sauce could penetrate.  I plan on trying this recipe using chicken and grilling it.  DEELISH!

This tenderloin was delicious.  I didn't folow directions and marinated the meat all day instead of just basting it.  I'm glad I did because it came out super moist and yummy.  The only thing I changed was adding a little corn syrup to the honey because I didn't have enough.  Other than that I followed the recipe ingredients exactly.

Subbed low sodium soy sauce, olive oil, and red wine vinegar.  Should probably add garlic and ginger next time for more flavor.

This was pretty good.  I marinated it for a couple hours before baking.  It made it very sweet.  I think next time I will follow the recipe a bit more.  If that does not work, maybe I will try to cut the honey a little.

I did think that it was pretty good.  I made it exactly as recipe said, but I did marinade it for about an hour.  My hubby loved it.  I served it with coucous, but should have served it with brown rice...the sauce was really good.  I will make it again.

I just made this for dinner tonight and it was good. I think I would cook the pork with the juice on it and baste several times. It was tender and juicy though. Husband liked it! Thanks.

We didn't like this at all. The sesame oil was way too overpowering. I kept looking at the recipe trying to figure out if I did something wrong, but from what I can tell everything was exactly the same. We will never make this again.

I don't usually cook with Pork but this was pretty good.  The honey sauce was delicious, but the Pork turned out drier than I would have liked it.  I'm figuring this was my fault due to inexperience.
