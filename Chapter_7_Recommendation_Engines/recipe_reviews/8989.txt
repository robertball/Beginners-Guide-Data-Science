I doubled this recipe and used my crockpot.  4 partially frozen breasts were jucy and delicious after 4 hours on low.  I served it with brown rice and roasted zucchini.  This is a recipe I will use again and again I am sure.

I've also made this in a slow cooker with still frozen chicken breasts on low for about 3-4 hours, then shredded up the chicken with the picante sauce for a yummy chicken taco type salad or as someone else mentioned, chicken burritos.  My husband likes to put the leftovers on nachos.

I have made this chicken ,without this recipe, and wanted to leave a comment.  I cook mine in the oven instead of stove top. Use frozen chicken breast (in the bag), pour salsa on top, cover with foil, cook for 1 hour at 350.  NEVER dry when cooked this way.  If you want a little extra flavor, season with a little chili powder, cumin, and garlic before adding salsa.  Not necessary but adds some great flavor.  I like to slice the chicken and use for fajitas.  So easy. For an Italian version use pasta sauce to cook chicken and serve over noodles.  Definitely a great way to cook a great meal especially when you're short on time.

Pretty darn good.  I chunked the chicken and put the dish over mexican rice and added a little sour cream on top.  Just enough kick.  Will make again.

This was delicious.  The chicken turned out spicy and tender.  I used 4 frozen chicken breasts and two jars of hot picante sauce.  When the chicken was ready I shredded it.  We then prepared it taco bar style with soft tortillas, lettuce, sour cream, and shredded cheese.  We'll definitely be making this again and again!

I'm a college student so this was very cheap and easy to make.  I ended up chopping the chicken and mixing the whole mixture with a couple tablespoons of ranch dressing to use with salad to make a Santa Fe Salad...delicious

I just made this and it was delicious with a capitol D...so Delicious. I was worried it wouldn't come out and thought the salsa may burn but instead the salsa seemed to perfectly infuse into the chicken in just about 20 minutes of cooking. I actually made the salsa I used for this myself so it would be as spicy as I like and seasoned the chicken with a bit of seasoned salt and it all came out great! Nice recipe!

Seriously packs a punch with just 2 simple & cheap ingredients!

 I made mine in the slow cooker then served it in tortillas with rice, shredded cheese & sour cream. I you want it a little more spicy, add a whole jalapeño to the slow cooker. Yumm. This would also be a great recipe to make enchiladas with.

Surpringly good! I made mine with "La Costena" brand salsa which was cheap at the Mexican grocer. I am amazed that just poaching the chicken actually works out.  It really penetrates and boy mine was HOT.  I used medium salsa.  SPICEY..whew! But good!  If you are tired of bland chicken try it.. ya won't believe it.  Boy I didnt.  It seems just.. TOO EASY.  Wonder how this method would be with BBQ sauce?  It sure is easier than baking and all the stuff you have to do to get some flavor into chicken.  Really loved it.

This was very easy to make and a great way to use up some chicken you're not really sure to do with. I felt weird about cooking the chicken in the sauce, so I poached the chicken in seasoned water then put it in the picante sauce and cooked. I used this in some chicken enchiladas for some added flavor.

Very good I baked the chicken, with Salsa on top and covered for 60 minutes.  I then served it over elbow macaroni with a little cheddar cheese and sour cream on top.  It was absolutely fantastic.

We made this using a jar of Newman's Own salsa, and it turned out fantastic!  Simple and really flavourful.  Next time, we'll try it in the crock pot.

made this in the crockpot with salsa instead of picante (they're pretty much the same thing). it was a bit dry, but that could be from the crock pot. would be great shredded in burritos.

This was really easy and very good. After the chicken was cooked through, I shredded the breasts and returned them to the skillet for a few minutes to absorb the picante juices. I served the chicken in tortilla shells with lettuce, cheese, and sour cream. The whole family loved it!

The simplicity of this recipe is brilliant.  I needed to do something with an extra chicken breast, and was wondering what to do.  I grabbed my jar of salsa and was good to go.  So versatile, too!  I wrapped up my chicken in a tortilla.  This has so many possibilities.  GREAT!

I used this recipe when making chicken tacos one night. It was super easy to throw the chicken and sauce in the crock pot and then shred the chicken when it was done cooking. Very easy, but still I felt something was missing. Maybe it was the sauce I used. Overall, I think this recipe is a great starting point for recipes like chicken tacos or enchiladas... or even use this chicken to top a nice salad. Very versatile.

Very easy.  I baked very thin chicken breasts at 350 for about 40 mins. I added sour cream at the end of the cooking.

I made this for supper one night when I needed a quick & easy recipe. We loved it! It's definitely a keeper for me, because it's so easy to remember the minimal ingredients!  I used PACE Picante sauce in medium flavor. Served over mexican style rice and extras like sour cream, shredded cheddar & chopped jalepenos. Will definitely add to the rotation!

Super easy, especially in the slow cooker. Added a bay leaf, dried mustard and cumin for more flavor. When there's a half hour of cooking time left, add frozen corn and/or black beans, yum. I also added cilantro which gave it a fresh taste.

I think this is a good, easy recipe. The only difference I did was top with some shredded chedar cheese. Cooking the pace picante sauce gives it a little different flavor. Its very good.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways - shredded for tacos, sliced for fajitas, served whole over rice. No matter how it's served, picante chicken is the bomb! I rub the chicken with Seasoning for Tacos (found here on AR) for a lot of extra flavor (and a 5th star). It can be made spicier with the addition of diced fresh jalapeños, so yummy.  I make it in the slow cooker with frozen chicken, nothing could be simpler. Pork loin or tenderloin is a delicious alternative.

This was so good and SO easy! I added a little extra picante because I was serving over couscous. Other than that, made just as directed. This will definitely be my go to meal on nights I don't feel like cooking or don't have time to prepare.

People are rating this bland but I disagree I think they must be using the wrong salsa. i would say its a subtle flavor but not bland.

Very easy and tasty, I used salsa and chopped the chicken to cook faster. I also served it over rice. Will probably use more than one jar next time so i have some extra sauce to mix with rice.

Had this tonight, and I took one other reviewers' suggestion and shredded the chicken and served with taco fixings.  Wow we loved it, my husband wanted to know what was in the sauce, said the spices were perfect, he didn't know it was his favorite chunky salsa!  Will make again often!

Super simple and delicious.  Nothing easier than a two ingredient recipe.   I give it 4-1/2 stars for ease of preparation and flavor.  Great idea for dorm cooking or harried families wanting a hot meal on school nights.

So easy it hurts! We used a sala that contained corn, black beans and roasted chilies and it was amazing! I used 4 chicken breast halves covered in salsa and cooked it in my crockpot. YUM!

Easy and dee-lish! Perfect for 2 busy people like my hubby and I.  I added 1 tsp of minced garlic and a few generous dashes of Red Hot. I will make this again but will try it in the crock pot like others have done. Thanks for sharing.

Pretty good, very easy to make! I seasoned the chicken before I put it in the salsa. I served it over brown rice that I made with chili powder, red pepper, and about 4 tbsp. of salsa. Great flavor, and it complemented the chicken so well!

I loved this recipe, its a great starter recipe.  I put salt, pepper, and chicken seasoning onto my chicken breast. In my pan I layered the bottom with onion and bell pepper. I put my chicken breast on top and poured the salsa (my homemade salsa) on top and cooked.  Perfection came out of my oven!

Eating this as I type...  yummy! I added carrots while it was cooking to oomph up the veggie factor, and some light sour cream towards the end as I like a creamy sauce. Was cooking very large breasts so used a large jar of salsa and had to add a cup of water part way through as a lot of liquid cooked off quickly.  And it is DELISH!  Served on top of brown rice with guacamole and corn chips on the side. I added a picture to the site.... a nice colourful meal.

I used salsa and the chicken was juicy and delicious. I will definitely make this often. However, if using 2 chicken breasts as the recipe states, DO NOT use a LARGE saucepan (as per the recipe directions). My salsa got all dried up and the bottom of the chicken was burnt. This is why I took off a star. If it had said SMALL saucepan, I would have given full marks. I also added grated cheddar cheese on top of the chicken for the last 10-15 minutes and served with sour cream. It was like a quesadilla without the tortilla and this is the way I will continue to make it.

I have been doing this with pork roast in my crockpot for years, but I was looking for a quick filling for corn tortillas for lunch with a gluten-allergic friend.    I used three large breasts and two cups of sauce and was a little disappointed that the chicken didn't have much flavor.  So I shredded the chicken, added it back to the sauce, and added a bouillon cube dissolved in a little water (which not only added some flavor but also salt, which this needs).   Then I stirred in some chopped cilantro (which I also do with the pork in the crockpot).  Much better!    The next time I'll add the bouillon cube in the beginning and keep the cilantro addition at the end.  Over all it was an ultra easy recipe with an decent result as it is.

My husband said he like this. I needed something quick and spotted a bottle of Picante in the fridge along with a leftover chicken breast I hadn't used yet. I cut up the breast into about 4 strips and boiled them in a small pot (to submerge meat in the sauce) for probably 45 min. - they were tender and tasty. I served with black beans and rice.

So easy...why didn't I think of this?  I put four boneless breasts in with a full bottle of picante and a few splashes of hot taco sauce.  After a couple of hours on high in the crock pot they were perfect for shredding.  Served over white rice.  All enjoyed!

I LOVE this recipe!!!  Its by far the simplest chicken recipe I have.  When Im starving and want something healthy without a lot of effort I just cut up some chicken and throw it in 2 cups of water and 1 cup of salsa and let it simmer out the water...its SO juicy and flavorful and its done in about 25 minutes and that only because I let it simmer...it probably actually done way earlier.  It goes good in burritos too!  YUM! I'm making it again right now!

So easy and quick. I just used the salsa in a jar you can get anywhere and the chicken was done in less than 30 minutes. After the meat was done, I sliced a thin piece of mozzarella and placed it on the chicken in the pan until melted. It was great!

So easy ... and oh so good!!  I was feeding three hungry teenagers so as per other reviewers' suggestions I shredded the chicken when cooked, added black beans, shredded cheddar/jack cheese and olives and wrapped in warm tortillas.  YUMMY!!

I just threw everything into the crock pot and we shredded it for chicken tacos, came out pretty good but not enough flavor to the chicken.

DELICIOUS! I was iffy about making this because it sounds too easy to be good. It was great and super easy..even healthy! I cut the chicken into bite sized strips before cooking and served it with corn and cottage cheese. I will be making this on a regular basis from now on!

Very satisfactory when  you haven't made any dinner plans or have NO time. Kind of like cooking with  cream of anything soups. I've cooked whole chickens in the crockpot with salsa also.  It's always good to have some of these  simple recipes as back up plans!

This is a great recipe to use when you have the ingredients on hand and you are short on time. Clean the chicken, gently boil it for specified time, and you have a wonderful, good-for-you, tasty dish. I had large drummettes on hand, used four with a little over a cup of salsa, and the chicken came out full of flavor and extremely tender. I served it over brown rice. It was great. Thanks!

This was pretty good, but I overcooked the chicken breasts we used. Also used my salsa from last year's canning, which isn't really that great. Would be better not overcooked and with good salsa or picante. Served over rice.

This is honestly one of the most easiest and tastiest recipes you will find. I always season my chicken first with Garlic powder & seasoning salt. I love this when I want a no fuss dinner.

This was so good and so easy!  I added a squeeze of lemon and served with white rice and salad.  My husband raved about it!  I think I will take the suggestion of other reviewers and try it in the crock pot next time.

I used frozen breasts.  I liked it, but my husband was not a fan.  He asked me to not make it again.  Too bad for me.

I did the whole slow cooker thing that a few of the other reviewers suggested. I really liked this chicken. My husband, on the other hand, did not. I'll make this again on a night he works late.

Yes, it's very easy for a lazy night.  And I served it over rice partially made with some of the sauce.  But certainly nothing exciting.

Really quick and easy to make.  After cooking chicken cut it into 1" cubes.  Prepare plate with bed of lettuce, top with chicken and salsa.  Add shredded cheddar cheese and 5-6 crushed tortilla chips to top.

Super simple dinner dish that was a huge hit. For my husband, I made this as suggested and used Pace Medium Picante Sauce. For me, I used Pace and Gardein "chicken" strips since I'm a vegetarian. Also in mine I added a little sour cream at the end of cooking. We both loved the flavor and my husband literally said I need to make this again. I agree!
