This is my recipe and I wanted to add a note here. I was making this when my boyfriend was visiting and he brought me Greek yogurt when I sent him to the store...which was awful in this...I had to keep reintegrating it every time I used the dressing, and the flavor, texture, and appearance suffered tremendously. I love it with regular yogurt, but would not make it again with the Greek.

I stumbled upon this recipe looking for a complement to my chicken fajitas.  The fresh berry sweeteness combined with the tart balsamic flavor really was a splendid combination with the tex-mex fare. My kids loved it!

I am avoiding sugar so I left it out and it was still yummy, you just have to like tart.
