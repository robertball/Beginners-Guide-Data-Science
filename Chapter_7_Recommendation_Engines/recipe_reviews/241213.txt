If you've ever gotten so mad while peeling your boiled eggs that you feel like cussing and throwing them all away because once you turn them into deviled eggs everyone will think a critter had already started chewing on them before they make it to the table then look no further than this method! And I know you've been there. I'm hooked. Once I started making my eggs this way I've yet to say one bad word. Brian deserves a great big kiss for sharing this secret. Shhh...don't tell my husband I said that!

Oh Bd.Weld!  You are my HERO!  The pan set I bought recently has a steamer unit, & boy is it going to get a workout from now on!  I put 3 farm fresh eggs, 3 new from store, 3 older than a week, plus 3 random and they ALL came through it perfectly!  I made a new folder for my recipe box called A-Plus Methods and there went this "recipe" for easy access!  Thank you for letting us all know about this!  I like to keep boiled eggs on hand, since they make such good snacks, & sandwiches, plus I like to use "farm fresh" eggs, & they just don't compute with my "old" method.  I just may start cackling pretty soon!   !!!     Blessings!

Never fail way to get your eggs peeled flawlessly. Tuck this into your "more idea than recipe" folder and don't forget about it. I've been using this method for quite some time (when it was still a "personal recipe") and have always had success. This method works even with a bamboo steamer and a pressure cooker (in 8 minutes). The trick is not to dump the eggs into the ice water, but to place them one-by-one with a slotted spoon into the ice water. Thanks bd.weld for this idea.

This is the BEST method for cooking eggs for peeling.  I have done a dozen fresh eggs and every single one was flawless.  Thanks for sharing this perfect method!  It is positively fool proof.

I will never again boil my eggs! This is the ONLY way to go! I leave the eggs out for an hour to bring down to room temp before steaming, and 15 min. on medium heat is perfect. When peeling, I saw a little trick done by Food Networks Tyler Florence. After the 20 minute ice water bath, to peel, use a teaspoon, to slide under the skin of the shell. It is so EASY!

Local grocery store had eggs for 49 cents a dozen today.  Since the expiration date was also today, egg salad seemed like a great idea.  I had saved this hard steam method for cooking eggs some time after Easter.  My deviled eggs on that occasion were an unusual epic fail, mostly due to egg shells that had a bad case of separation anxiety.  I would like to say that I followed this recipe to the letter, but unfortunately I failed to read directions correctly and didn't use eggs at room temperature.  When I caught my error, I was able to adjust the steaming time by adding a couple minutes.  Even with my goof, the eggs turned out perfectly cooked, with beautiful yellow (no hint of green) yolks, and shells that peeled off like a dream.  Keeper!

Finally! A recipe that ACTUALLY WORKS to make EASY-to-peel hard cooked eggs. It really made a difference. Don't overlook that it says to start with "room temperature' eggs. I didn't have a steamer, so I used a strainer in my dutch oven (for a dozen eggs). I covered, but left slightly ajar. It worked beautifully. Peeling was SO EASY!! Everyone here was laughing at me cuz each egg was slightly cracked for coloring eggs  : D ! Never will I 'boil' eggs again. Thank you, Bd.weld for this great method! (added 9-4-15):  Ok, so I forgot to put a small crack in each egg.  And only left in ice water about 15 min.  Not as perfect/easy, as cracking and leaving in longer but MUCH MUCH better. So, I  will skip that cracking step and the extra minutes in ice water.

I am thrilled to see this recipe finally published! I originally rated it as bd weld's personal recipe back in April 2013. Here's what I said then and what I still feel today.--"It only took a little over a half of a century for me to find a recipe for the perfect cooked eggs. I have boiled with vinegar, baking soda, or salt. I have cooked with a slow simmer and a high boil. I have removed from heat and covered with cold water and I have baked in the oven. THIS one worked. I was afraid to try it. I followed the directions and there it was! A perfectly cooked egg that peeled very easily. A "hard boiled" egg that peeled easily was my biggest obstacle until I tried this one. Thank you, bd! I will use your recipe from now on!"

Maui Girl tried this method and showed it to me...I'm so glad she did! It worked perfectly. What I also love about this method is that you don't get a green edge around the yolk. Thanks BD...you rock!

I did them just as written. I have my own chickens, and up until now, I would set my oldest eggs aside for a few weeks, that I was going to hard cook. Yesterday I steamed 6 eggs  just from the nest, and were still warm from laying. Steamed em for 15 min. and put them in ice for about 1 hr. I was amazed how  well this worked. 5 Stars with ease . Thanks for the great tip.

This technique did not work for me. I followed the directions to the letter and the shell stuck to the egg like glue.

I have used this method around 20 years.  It's the best method to Hard boil Eggs.  Turns out correctly boiled eggs 100% of the time.
Note: I steam for 20 minutes.

I can't believe that it took me all these years to find the perfect method for hard cooked eggs! These eggs came out perfect. Not one messed up egg in the bunch.I made deviled eggs for a Valentine's Day brunch and they turned out beautiful. This is the ONLY hard cooked/boiled/steamed recipe I will use in the future. Thanks for sharing bd weld!

I can't believe that at my age I actually "tried" a new recipe for hard cooked eggs.  I'm so glad I did.  Turned out perfectly - not a hint of sulfur colour.  This will be my new method :)

I steam 6 dozen eggs every 2 weeks (and more at Easter) for church coffee hour.  I use this basic process and have for more years than I can count.  I have engineered a 3 layer steamer insert for my pasta pot for 3 dozen at a time and have recently purchased an Asian dumpling steamer that lets me cook all 6 dozen.  I do NOT fill the pot with a lot of water,  just a few inches so that it can boil/simmer (and steam) for 25 - 30 minutes without boiling dry.  That is the key...because there is so much volume, I give the eggs more time.  I can (and have to) cook with fresh eggs every week and 99.9 % of my  eggs come out perfectly.  They are a HUGE hit at church.

From now on, this will be the only method of cooking hard boiled eggs I will use.   The shells come off in no time rarely damaging the egg's surface, so if you want pretty deviled eggs this is the method to use. I found that for jumbo eggs you might want to increase the steaming for as much as 2 minutes.

This is the bee's knees! I found that putting then in ice water until they were easy to handle was enough to have the peels fall off, no need for another 20 minutes!

I don't have a farm, but I do have three suburban hens (not to be confused with neighbors).  They usually lay 3 eggs a day and its wonderful having fresh eggs.  Except when you need boiled eggs!  I've tried every which way to peel without frustration and this is the one and only way that actually worked!  (And I tried them on today's eggs! )Thank you, much appreciated.

I have steamed my eggs for over a year, ever since I read the instructions online from a professional chef. I steam them exactly 19 minutes & then I dump them into a sink of cold water from the faucet in just enough water to cover them. I crack all of them immediately and I peel them immediately beginning at the fat end where  the air pocket is and you are able to grasp them membrane. the shells and the membrane literally slip off the egg. I rinse them in cold water and place them on a dish towel to dry and place another over them when finished to allow them to cool. this work for 6 or 18. I never have a green film around the yolk. About a week ago I read where you could place them in a pan of cold water bring them to a rolling boil cover them, remove them from the fire & let them sit 15 minutes, crack in cool water peel immediately & you would have perfect eggs. I tried it with 4 eggs and one of them peeled perfectly the others lost part of their whites in the peeling...I will always steam my eggs

This worked really well with getting the shells off cleanly, but I think the time was a little long, as my yolks came out green tinged.

unfortunately this was a fail for me. the only thing i know that makes eggs easier to peel is when they've been sitting around for a while.  i bought my eggs last weekend.

I've tried every method to "hard boil" fresh eggs. This is the BEST. I found I have to steam mine for 20-25 minutes before subjecting them to the ice bath. 15 minutes was too short for 1 day old eggs, the shell still stuck to the egg. I am so happy about this because deviled eggs are competition in my family.

I made this recipe to use for deviled eggs. The eggs were cooked perfectly, but the shell stuck like glue. I made 2 batches totaling 24 eggs and only 1 egg peeled without ripping. I will go back to my old way.

This method worked fine for me. Although, I didn't think it was any better than the method I usually use. Most of the eggs were very easy to peel, but I had just a couple spots that stuck slightly. That's usually the same results with my other method. I think the biggest key to easy to peel eggs is not letting them boil the whole time.

I am very happy with the results from my first attempt.  I left the eggs on the counter for 90 minutes and then brought the water to an almost boil. I had the temperature at medium when I was bringing the water to a boil. I added the eggs, put the lid on the pan, reduced the heat to medium low and set the time for the recommended 15 minutes. I then put the eggs in ice water for about 20 minutes. I did not do the cracking step. After 20 minutes I cracked an egg on a piece of paper towel and then used the suggestion of another reviewer to use a teaspoon to gently get under the shell. Oh my!! That made it so easy to remove the shell. I can't wait to show that tip to my grandchildren. Great recipe. I am going to try to steam them for less than 15 minutes next time. I thought the yolk did not come out as creamy as my usual method.  However, that is all in the timing I am sure. I will update if my yolks turn green after a day or two. For now they are perfect, but that is always the case right after boiling eggs. It seems like after they sit in the frig they might turn green. This is definitely my new way of making hard boiled eggs. It is easy, you don't deal with the cracked eggs that result from cooking them in boiling water. Thank you to the poster!!!

This is the best way I have found to cook eggs, especially for eating for breakfasts/snacks, or for peeling for deviled eggs. Works every time, I have done this several times now, since finding this. I won't go back to regular boiling or baking.

Finally, the technique I've been looking for! Using this method, I just cooked 12 very fresh eggs (the "best by" date was 44 days away), and they peeled infinitely better than any other method I've tried. (There was only one little divot in one egg.) Suggestions: If you're in a hurry, warm your refrigerated eggs by immersing them for about 15 minutes in lots of warm tap water (slightly warmer than your body temperature). Also, when you crack the large end of each egg, do it on a flat surface and then follow up by piercing each egg's inner membrane using a fine skewer, needle or clean push-pin. Insert it through the crack 1/8" to 1/4". And when you peel the eggs, it still helps to do so under running water, with a strainer underneath to catch the shells.

I have always had problems with making hard-boiled eggs mostly due to our home having hard water high in iron.  I don't know if it played any difference, but it I haven't changed anything but my address...  Anyway... I tried this method and it worked well.  I had some 'sticking shell' issues the first time, so I reduced the steam time down to 12 minutes and chilled them for the 20-25 minutes, until the were ice cold.  Since then, I have had no issue with cooking them.

5.10.16  Two words:  THIS WORKS!!  I bought these eggs this morning, and unlike trying to peel other really fresh hard boiled eggs and having the shell stick (making a mess of the egg white), these eggs peeled beautifully.  Thanks, Brian, this one’s a winner!

I'll never hard boil another egg.  This method is hands down the easiest, most consistent, and adaptable to your level of desired"doneness"just by adding or reducing a few minutes.  The only thing not to like is that I didn't discover this 20 years ago!

This is the best trick ever!  However, after playing around with times, I've finessed my personal method.  I put my steaming basket with eggs in it over a pot of water and bring it to a boil.  Then I put the lid on and set my kitchen timer for 4 minutes.  I turn the element off and leave the eggs in the covered pot til they are cooled, and only then refrigerate.  They come out beautifully hard steamed, but with an oh so soft and creamy texture.

The eggs weren't hard and I steamed them for 30 minutes!

I had always thought about steaming my eggs instead of boiling them. Well, I had to replace my electric steamer, and lo and behold, in the instruction book was the recipe to make hard cooked eggs! I discovered that setting my steamer to 12 minutes made the yolks perfectly yellow and no green anywhere. With the steamer basket, you can just set the whole thing in a pan of ice water without having to handle the eggs. Perfect eggs, every time.

This is the same trick my grandma used to use since she had very fresh eggs every morning. If you are lucky enough to get fresh eggs that are almost impossible to peel, try to add this trick: I take a pin and hold it on the table (head side on the table) i puncture the fat part of the egg by quickly tap it on the needle. Then follow the directions on this recipe. Easy peasy!!

Yep! I had to try it as I have a love hate relationship with boiled eggs; I love to eat them, but HATE peeling them! I've used this method 3 times now, and each time I've gotten PERFECT eggs! So easy to peel and no green around the yolk from overcooking! Thanks for sharing this!

I will never boil an egg in water again! Eliminated the 2nd 20 minute soaking in ice water by cracking each egg with a knife prior to the 20 minutes in ice water. These were farm egg, the most difficult eggs for me to peal - every one was perfect.

This worked perfectly.   The color of the yolks was perfect.   Completely done, but no greening at all.   It could be my imagination, but I think the yolks were fluffier than using my normal method.   I should add that my eggs were a mix of fresh and two week old eggs and they all peeled perfectly.  Great job Brian.

I can finally make beautiful deviled eggs again. These peel beautifully. Today I made 30 eggs and only two didn't peel perfectly. That is a first.

Couldn't find my steamer but covered the eggs with water and used your timing and ice bath! The eggs peeled like a dream and were perfectly cooked. Thanks!
