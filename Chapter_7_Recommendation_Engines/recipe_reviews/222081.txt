I like how she said she was going to make it healthier - with butter!  So true!  This was great, I make it all the time now!  I also added some beets,  squash and zucchini because it's summer and it was yummy!

This recipe made a really delicious, moist chicken.  It was really easy to stuff the butter under the skin, I had never tried that before when roasting poultry.  You could add herbs or spices to the butter to give the meat more flavor if you wanted.  I will use this recipe again.

The amount of butter this recipe calls for was probably twice what it needs to be.  The butter melted and dripped down onto the veggies, which were already coated with oil.  The result was soggy veggies swimming in fat.  It also needs seasonings to boost the flavor.  It was edible and can be modified to suit personal preferences.

I followed this recipe with  1/2 the butter (I used 1/4 c. total) and added two garlic cloves inside the Chicken.  The meat was juicy and the skin was crisp.  The vegetables were also very delicious with the olive oil and chicken drippings.  We will definitely have this again.

I really liked the flavor, I cut back on the butter and olive oil because the drippings from then chicken would be sufficient to coat the roasting veggies. Really my only complaint is my chicken has been in the oven for well over the time suggested in the recipe. It has completely thrown off everything else. The brown rice has been finished for awhile and the chicken still isn't quite ready. I just like to have everything done at the same time.

Chicken took longer that stated on recipe so vegetables were slightly overcooked.

Made exactly as written and oh my goodness was it good! Also to the poster, thank you for saying that using butter is healthier than margarine, because it is and I can't believe how many people don't know or believe that. I loved your choice of vegetables to use. Since it is winter time now, and these are in season, they were so delicious. I will make this again and again! This will be my go to recipe for roast chicken from now on. Thank you so much for posting this with the healthier modifications.

Delicious! Maybe because I used an organic chicken, but it was super moist and full of flavor. I used between 1/4 and 1/2 cup of butter under the skin as instructed. I added 4 garlic cloves inside. Sprinkled the bird with Montreal Chicken Grill Mate for additional flavor. The simple combination of vegetables is flavor-fully sweet and rustic. Enough vegetables so no other side dishes needed.

I made a few changes because of what I had on hand.  That's one of the joys of using a base recipe like this.  I didn't have butternut squash, but I had summer squash and zucchini, so I used large slices of those.  I didn't have fingerling potatoes, so I used red potatoes.  And I used only about 6 tablespoons of margarine altogether and 4 garlic cloves in the cavity.  It was very good and moist and using a 3 lb chicken as listed, it was completely done in the time in the recipe.

Great flavor but for some reason the white meat was still kinda dry.

My squash was already partially cooked so it was real soft, I liked the mix of ingredients, used Kosher salt but all in all it turned out quite well as per the recipe.

This turned out wonderfully. I used between 3 and 4 tablespoons of butter, rather than the 1/2 cup that the recipe called for, and it was perfect. Probably the juiciest chicken I've made.

Really liked this recipe.  Only used 1/4-1/2 of the fat (I used margarine as we have no butter in the house) And it turned out great.  I should have tossed the veggies better as they were a bit dry-roasted but I just drizzled and tossed them with a little olive oil after baking.  Yummy!  I got raves from all.  I gave this four stars because I agree with others that the cooking time listed should be 15-30 min. longer. DEFINITELY making this again... And again... And again!  Thanks for sharing, MakeItHealthy!

While very moist I found the chicken to be rather bland.  I have never roast a chicken before so I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of throwing some mushrooms in with the veggies because hubby and I love mushroom...should the skin have been crispy? because mine was decidedly not.  All in all, I'll try this again.
