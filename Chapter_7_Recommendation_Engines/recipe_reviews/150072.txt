I think this would have been much better but, the listed amount of onion and ranch is WAY too much. I may try this again, even though I am the only one that liked it, but use much less ranch dressing (1/3 the listed amount)and a smaller onion. I also wonder about adding some cooked chicken?!?!

Absolutely splendid!! A great flavor combination between the onions, ranch dressing, and tomatoes. I did, however, add some additional garlic salt and pepper to enhance the flavors a bit more. Be sure to let it set a few minutes before trying to cut it to allow the ingredients to cool and set so that they don't slide off when you slice it.

We thought this was ok.  Was looking for something a little different, but it didn't wow us.  Thanks for the post.

I used everything the recipe called for, only eye-balling it all and this pizza turned out very nicely!  A keeper for sure!

I am wondering if I leave out the tomatoes, what could I use in place of them. Tomatoes don't agree with me.
