Absolutely delicious!!  Thanks for the recipe!  For anyone worried about knowing whether or not the chicken is cooked, I'd ditch the thermometer idea posted by one reviewer and just cut into one of cutlets after cooking for 40 minutes.   If the chicken still looks raw (pink), continue cooking.  Thanks again for the recipe, it is definitely a keeper.

Great flavor. I cheated and used puff pastry instead of making my own.

I added a sprinkle of parsley on top of the beaten egg and later added just a pinch of shredded Parmesan to the top for the last 2 minutes of baking.  I didn't have 1 c. White American cheese so I used 2/3 c. mozzarella and 1/3 c. freshly shredded Parmesan.  Instead of putting all of the seasoning on the outside of the rolled chicken breast, I put part of it inside and added salt and pepper inside and out.

I didn't do it right probably. But I think something needs to be added to the spinach that would take the bitterness and it took forever for the crust to cook, thus drying out the chicken. Keep the crust thin!
