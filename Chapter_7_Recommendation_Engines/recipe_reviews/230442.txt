Despite getting the wrong cranberry sauce at the store (we got the regular ol' cranberry jelly), and not having any ginger, this was amazing!  The kids LOVED the glaze (while the roast was resting, I poured it into a sauce pan and added some cornstarch to thicken it up some) and kept asking for more, the hubby kept remarking at the flavor and the juiciness of the pork, and while it was cooking, it made the entire house smell divine.  This is going in the "tried & true" list for sure.

This recipe was delicious. I used ground cloves instead of whole, but I should have used a little less of all of the spices. But even still, it was great. I will definitely make this next Christmas!

I normally cook for a minimum of 25 people so, I'm always looking for a easy but exciting recipe. This recipe fits the bill! I was tempted to brown the roast first as a way to get some more flavors under the sauce but stuck with the recipe and added some salt at the end. Next time I'll pull the sauce, season and thicken it. Great holiday recipe.

Why 3 stars?  No where does it say you should reserve the sauce from the pan and pour over each slice of the roast.  It looked beautiful out of the oven but was virtually tasteless.  When I saved the leftovers (there were a lot of them, unfortunately) in the fridge, I poured the pan sauce over the roast to keep it moist.  Next day I sliced off a piece and put some of the sauce on it.  Incredible.  My wife sent a note out to the poor people who had eaten the bland product from the night before explaining our mistake.  Maybe I should have assumed the sauce in the pan was good as a gravy but I thought it might have been too greasy.  Probably would have been a five star if I'd gotten it right the first time.  Also, as others have mentioned, it cooks faster than the recipe indicates.

this was delicious.  The aroma while baking is fantastic and the meat was so tender you almost don't need a knife.  My husband said this is definitely a keeper.

I cooked it an additional 10 minutes.  There was a lot of liquid, so I strained it and kept the apples and cranberries.

I decided to make this for Christmas Eve because of the good reviews.  The meat was virtually tasteless. Tasted watery and gingery. Nobody cared for it. The sauce was watery. I thought it would be more of a glaze. I won't be making this again.

Loved it! Short on cranberry sauce, so I substituted some raspberry jam and craisins. Very tasty.

The cook time was a bit too long - I would suggest checking it at 45 minutes, especially if you do not have a thermometer to keep in the pork while in the oven.

Followed recipe exactly as written. The house smelled amazing while it was in the oven. The meat was tender and juicy but a bit on the sweet side for our liking. Overall I thought it was pretty good, my husband didn't care for the taste of cloves or Cinnamon on meat and our 9 year old said it was alright. I probably won't make this again, but it was nice to try something different.
