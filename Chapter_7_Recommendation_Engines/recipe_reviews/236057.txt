I used two boneless skinless chicken breasts, and added a 10oz package of spinach and about half a cup of feta to the filling.  I also added a clove of chopped garlic, and a bunch of mozzarella to the sauce.  Topped the whole thing with more mozzarella and baked at 350 for 30 mins.  Delicious!  Tip: plastic sandwich bags with a corner cut off work just as well to fill the pasta.

I made it according to directions. It didn't go over well with either my husband or I. Next time I'd go back to my regular ricotta filling with meat on the side.  Also, I think we just prefer my regular Italian red sauce. Although, I might also try it at least once with a classic Alfredo sauce. A bit more salt might have helped too.

We loved this dish! It was easy and yummy! 
 I chilled the filling and it was easy to kind of roll it into a "snake" and then push it into the manicotti noodles. I like trying a new recipe without making any changes but I didn't have nutmeg so I used Italian seasoning. 
Next time I'm going to double the sauce. Maybe I will add spinach to the filling, or add mushrooms to the sauce...or maybe add diced green chili to the filling for a spicy version.

This was amazing! 
My only changes to the sauce were adding 2 crushed garlic cloves,  1/8 tsp of cayenne, and 1 tsp of oregano. 
After assembling, i tossed a bit of fresh basil on top (had it in the fridge) and topped with shredded cheddar (had that in the fridge too) instead of mozzarella.
Next time i will make with Fresh Lasagna noodles, cut in quarters and rolled around filling; avoids the broken manicotti shells.

Tasty recipe! I made lots of changes based on my family's preferences & what I had on hand but am sure it's good as is.  I didn't use ham and used leftover chopped rotisserie chicken and 2% milk.  Subbed onion powder for the onions & added black pepper, salt, and a dash of nutmeg to the white sauce. Added garlic & onion powder, Italian seasoning, & pepper to the filling. Also drizzled about 10 oz. marinara sauce over the whole thing and added sliced chicken herb sausage to the pan - baked 25 mins. Very creamy, tasty & versatile recipe. Would be good with zucchini, spinach, or broccoli added!
