These were excellent! I didn't have Saki (drank it all), so I substituted fish sauce and oyster sauce in place of the single measurement of Saki. I also increased the recipe to accommodate 2 lbs of meat. (25 servings)

Yes it is VERY sticky but  it's still workable and fries very well. My husband and daughter and twin boys LOVED them!

Give this one a try!

Great recipe for ground chicken.  The sauce was tasty, but would have preferred it to be thicker.  I added a pinch of five spice to sauce and chicken; also a small amount of sesame oil in pan with the oil for frying the chicken meatballs.  Will definitely make it again!  ??

This recipe inspired me and I changed up a few things and it was amazing!  Doubled the recipe, used ground turkey since that's what we had around here. Added an egg and some panko breadcrumbs to the meatball ingredients and left out the corn starch from the meatballs. Instead I used the cornstarch at the end of the cooking in the water and soy sauce etc, to thicken the sauce a little. In addition I added some marsala. So Japan-meets-Italy. Served it over some fresh soba noodles with sauteed asparagus. It was a hit! Will def make a gain.

Good if you make it right.  Still haven't gotten the right amount of chicken. Last batch was wet and extremely hard to shape. The sauce and recipe are very tasty..just watch the measurements.

I have to say, I didn't enjoy this at all! I went out of my way to source chicken mince to make this, and it did not end up tasting very nice. The teriyaki sauce was also flavourless and thin. Next time, I'm making teriyaki chicken with proper chicken breasts, not mince, and will have to find a different  recipe for the sauce. The teriyaki sauce as I know it in the Japanese restaurants I've been to is very thick, sweet and flavoursome. Probably has quite a bit of cornstarch in it to get it to a nice and thick consistency.
