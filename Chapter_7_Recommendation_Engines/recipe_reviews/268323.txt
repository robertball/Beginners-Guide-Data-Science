I made this exactly as written and really enjoyed it. It was my first time cooking with pav bhaji masala and I'm looking forward to making this again.  I used my food processor to make quick work of grating the onion.  Adding in the butter at the end really transforms the flavor.   I'm not sure the small amount of corn was even worth opening up a can for - I might just leave it out next timed or add a bit more.   Also, this makes small servings, so keep that in mind. I got the mild chile and pav bhaji masala from an international market.
