I had some leftover polenta and wanted to use it up.  I made it for my vegetarian husband.  He wanted pineapple and mushrooms, so I added those. Also puréed a fresh tomato and topped it with mozzarella cheese. Voilà! Polenta pizza. Hubby really enjoyed this recipe.

I did not have instant polenta, so used cornmeal.  It didn't thicken up real well, so next time I might use 1/4 cup less water if I'm using cornmeal.  I love veggies, and could have stood many more of them in this pie, but I enjoyed it for what it was!  This  recipe lends itself to trying other vegetable combinations.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great, I did jazz it up a bit. But I would never have come up with this idea myself, so thanks th the poster!  I made my usually cheesy polenta for the crust. (2 c chicken broth (veggie broth would work) 1 cup dry polenta or grits, 2 tbs butter, 2 Tbs sour cream, a handful of shredded cheddar and garlic powder, salt, & pepper to taste) I used Red Gold Chili Ready diced tomatoes for some extra spice.I just added a few drops of lemon juice to the olive oil instead of infusing. I sprayed my pie plate with Pam coconut spray. This is a great recipe base that can be used lots of ways with different toppings. So versatile I know I will make it again!

This is fun to make and delicious.  I don't usually have polenta on hand so I cooked 1/2 cup cornmeal in about 1 1/4 cup water so it would be stiff enough to make a pie crust.  I did that a day before and then refrigerated the crust.  I used oregano and sliced tomatoes from my garden.  I chopped a whole sweet onion by accident and sauted all of it with other vegies and it was still excellent so I think I'll change my recipe to use a whole onion.  I think next time I'll lower the temperature to 400 and bake for 20 minutes to heat more.

for 4servings, I had to double the polenta, salt and water and used a larger pan, perhaps we just have bigger apetites. as it is, its good but with the addition of a pinch of chilli flakes, mushrooms, black olives and zucchini fried with the onions and garlic its MUCH better! I topped it with about 4oz crumbled feta and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese and just popped it under the grill for a few minutes to save on the heat of the oven. I also used fresh sliced tomatoes instead of canned.
