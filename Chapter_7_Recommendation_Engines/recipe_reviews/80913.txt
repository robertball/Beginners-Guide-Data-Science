Cute name for home fries - the whole time I was making them I expected "Oscar the Grouch" to pop out of my garbage can and ask when they were going to be done. (HA) I used a little butter and garlic along with the oil (cut the oil down a bit) and instead of thing slicing the potatoes I cubed mine. These are great with eggs, bacon, and toast -YUM!

We thought this was very good except it needed more than just a pinch of salt for our taste so I sprinkled with a bit of garlic salt.  For the reviewer that stated the potatoes never really browned up, you have to allow this dish to cook on about medium to medium high and don't turn real often, just let them sizzle and brown up before turning.

Just made these with potatoes with no added veggies (well, onion slices of course). And talk about garbage - I didn't peel the potatoes (I did scrub the first)! Guess what - they are better than ever.  Take the other reviewers advice - don't bother with them too much and they brown up nicely.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I had to add some additional spices/items of my own to add some more flavor. I kicked it up with some garlic salt & cayenne pepper. After potatoes were done, I sprinkled some parmesan cheese along with some shredded cheddar. VERY GOOD!!

These are great fried potatoes. For a quick breakfast, I will cut up sausage and fry it up in it. Then when it is all done, break a couple eggs in it, fry till all the egg is cooked, and you have a great breakfast.

These are great! We love serving fried onions with kielbasa or bratwurst. This is also great just with potatoes, salt, pepper and onions, and we usually fry in butter. You can even pop these in a foil pouch and cook on the grill! Thanks for a great recipe!

I've been making fried potatoes since I was tall enough to reach the stove.  My family used to use bacon grease and not oil, but I now use butter.  One-half stick of butter, sliced potatoes, onions, salt, & pepper.  I like the additions of the bell pepper, but never have tried it with the mushrooms, but will the next time.  Thanks!  Now the secret to getting them to brown good and crispy is an iron skillet!  None of that non-stick frying pan for this old lady. LOL  Keep a lid on it at first, until the potatoes get cooked through, then remove the lid and turn the potatoes, to brown throughout for a nice mixture of browning.

Great, easy recipe. I didn't add the mushrooms in but, I did add a little garlic salt and it tasted perfect. I had no problems with the potatoes browning. Just make sure you get the oil hot enough before you throw them in. thanks!

Super yummy. I used half EVOO and half bacon grease. I also used 4 oz. fresh mushrooms, added a few cloves minced garlic and all red pepper (we don't like green peppers). I did sprinkle a little of Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute over the potatoes while they were browning. I served this with South of the Border Scrambled Eggs and my kids and I were in HEAVEN.

Very good.  I like using red and yellow peppers.  I also prefer to cube the potatoes and slice the onions.  We like to add a little more seasoning.  Great side dish!

I make a similar recipe.  The difference is that I bake my potatoes.  Sometimes the night before.  I always have a few baked potatoes in the fridge ready to go.  Take them out.  Chop them up.  It's nice to have when you have a craving in the morning for fried potatoes & eggs.  One of my favorites.  What other veggies do you have that are ready to go to veggie heaven.  Chop them up & throw them in. Yum A little chopped up garlic is always good too.

Very good, but don't stir so much unless you want a big pile of mushy potatoes:) Let them sizzle in the oil & crisp up a bit. I add cheese too.

Made these as a side but added red,green and yellow chopped peppers, Anaheim pepper(chopped), green onions. Seasoned with Adobo and complete seasoning then sprinkled with grated cheese. They were a big hit.

I usually dice up my potatoes for breakfast potatoes because they cook quicker, I followed the recipe and sliced them but I could never get them to finish cooking all the way. I liked the veggies, I ended up using green, red and yellow peppers.

always good.  We leave out the mushrooms, but add whatever else the garden is producing.  Bell peppers, jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, spinach, cilantro, sweet potatoes, garlic, you name it.

A great idea to add more "junk" to fried potatoes, but other than that this was what the description says - basic fried potatoes.  I did think that the dish needed some sort of seasoning other than just salt and pepper.  I added chopped zucchini to the mix and basil.  (Dried added to the skillet and fresh on top as a garnish.)

I'm sorry, but this wasn't very flavorful. I added salt and pepper and it was still pretty bland. I always give high ratings when I like things, but we threw away most of this.
