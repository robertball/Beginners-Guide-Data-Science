I make this all the time with sour cream. It is always a hit. I am looking forward to making it with yogurt.

I made this with a taco seasoning I had made from another recipe. I was looking out of salsa and queso and craving chips and dip so I looked for something I could make with what I had Greek yogurt. This is a food recipe for when you need dip and have limited ingredients.
