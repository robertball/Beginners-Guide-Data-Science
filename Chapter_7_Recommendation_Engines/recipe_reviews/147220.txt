Great cake! I've made this twice in the last 2 weeks. The first time, I had a little trouble with my pudding layer and part of the cake fell on it - still yummy, but not so cute (became lovely cake balls!). Make sure your pudding is in a *thin*, even layer. I loved the cinnamon-coffee flavor of this and will definitely make it again. Both times my cake took 55 minutes to bake - something to keep in mind. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a fantastic cake, very moist! I did add 1 tsp of cayenne pepper for a little more spice, everyone that tried this cake loved it! I wasn't sure how the pudding center was going to turn out, but is was excellent. This recipe is a definate keeper! Thanks for sharing.

The cake was good but the pudding layer came out a little rubbery.  Not sure if I would make again.

I didn't have a boxed cake mix, so I used the recipe on the back of a Hersheyâ€™s cocoa container and changed it to match this recipe.  It called for a cup of boiled water.  I used 1/4 cup of Kahlua and dissolved instant coffee in 3/4 cup of water.  I also added a tablespoon of cinnamon to the recipe.  My husband is a chocolate cake fanatic said it is among the best chocolate cakes he has ever had.  It was excellent!  ...  Oh and I left out the vanilla pudding and it was still extremely moist.

The flavor of this cake is very good. However, I had to bake it for the 55 minutes that others suggested to get my toothpick out clean, and THEN..when I took it out of the pan, it fell in (also like someone else's)  Anyone have an idea how this can be avoided??

I made this in a spring form pan and modified the recipe a bit. I added nutmeg and cayenne for a spicier cake, and used only two eggs but increased the milk. It was rich, and delicious. The vanilla pudding made a nice filling, especially because I froze it over night, and then took it out a few hours ahead to soften up. I would make this again!

My team at work had a Cinco de Mayo potluck and I made this. (I also made one for hubby to take to his work.)

The first one I made as directed and the pudding dropped to the bottom (top when turned out) and was one ugly mess). Taste was still good. I cut off the top part and sent to work with hubby.

For the 2nd one I used Ideal sweetener instead of sugar and added all the pudding powder ( sugar free) into the mix and did not do a ring of pudding.  This was a great hit at work. Everyone wanted the recipe.

Cake was very good, mine fell a bit as well.  Made cinnamon whipped cream from another site and added dollops to hide the indentations.  Everyone loved the flavor and said ugly didn't matter.  :)

I also had to cook it for 55 minutes.  I left it in the pan to cool probably 15 minutes.

Yummy, moist and super simple. Luscious mocha flavor. I prefer it with a dark chocolate mousse. Great recipe, very pleasing results!

great cake but let the cake cool longer than 5 minutes. mines fell apart a little because of the vanilla filling. It's still eatable, and the confectionery sugar disguised the imperfections. :)

mine was different from the picture, I didn't get the cake texture with the cream in the middle: it sort of got mixed together and it came out sort of rubbery. A combination of cake and pudding, which in truth is what it really is, so, no wonder. But it has a pleasant taste, and a good presentation, so we are going to keep it.

This cake was just okay. It was nice and moist and the pudding stayed in great shape, yet the cinnamon wasn't my flavor. It's a nice recipie for what it is.
