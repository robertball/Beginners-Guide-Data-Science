This is a great recipe; I did do one thing differently...
I wrapped each apple in paper towels after putting the wood stick in it, then put them in a big gallon freezer bag and stuck them in the freezer for an hour first. When I dipped the apples in the caramel, I made sure there was no condensation on the outside of the apple (hence I wrapped them in the paper towels) and the caramel stuck to the apple better, I didn't have so much runoff and the caramel set faster. Makes less of a puddle around the bottom. if you do this, it's harder to put sprinkles on it as the caramel sets faster but I suppose if you had a plate of whatever you wanted on the outside right next to the stove, that may be easier\faster. But this is just what I did. :)

Really easy/fun to make! Stick to melting the caramels in the pan rather than the microwave. I've found that the microwave causes the caramels to harden much quicker than if melted on the pan.

I made these and maybe I was just thrilled that I got it nearly right, but my family and students enjoyed them. 
I did alter a few things; 

*I used a crock pot w/ one of those protector sheets for easy clean up. 

* I added milk and water, but now I think I should have added more and thinned it out a bit. :) But sticky is good. 

Iforgot the vanilla, but will do it again this weekend. Now that I have a sense of how to do this I cannot be stopped. I will take over the world hahahahaha

I did not have any sliding as noted by others and I too used wax paper. (but only because my hubby reminded me) hahahaha

I made these caramel apples and they look beautiful, however my caramel is too hard.  The consistency is like a Sugar Daddy sucker.  What did I do wrong??

I make these every year and they are delicious!  Does anyone have a great Idea for packaging them to give out as treats to friends. I am afraid they will stick to the 
paper permanently.

This was so much fun to do!  I dipped the apples in boiling water for a few seconds first to remove the wax.  This did make the caramel stick better.  After that I left a couple plain, coated some in nuts, and others I drizzled with chocolate.  I can't wait to give these to my neighbors little girls for Halloween.

The trick is to use wax or parchment paper. Greasing a metal pan does NOT work. Thanks!

What a great reciepe!!I did add two things to this reciepe though. I did boil the apples to remove wax as suggested by someone. Only keep them in the pot of water for seconds!They get soft and gross any longer.Then put the sticks into them,place them on a cookie sheet with wax paper and place them into the fridge for a few hours. Once ready to get started, add 6tbsp of evaporated milk/cream to the caramels in a pot; then melt the caramels on top of the oven at a low-medium heat, while continually stirring. The cream keeps the caramels from hardening while dipping the apples and makes the caramel creamy. I even went at my own pace! Keep your heat on low until finished.In the meantime, I had a smaller pot with 1 square of sweetened Baker's chocolate and 1 square of unsweetened Baker's chocolate, being stirred while melting. Add tsp's of cream, in intervals, to the chocolate, to keep it at a thin consistency and from hardening. Once the caramel apples were dipped I put them onto the wax paper and drizzled chocolate all around them. PERFECTION! The caramel and the chocolate took no time to harden. Enjoy!!

I made these with my second grade class. I used a crock pot and quadrupled the recipe. It took about 3 hours for the caramels to melt completely on low. My students had fun dipping their own apples. They had the option to put toppings on their apples as well. I used non-stick foil pieces to set the apples on after dipping. I also used Gala apples to appeal to the childrens' tastes. I think I would have preferred the Granny Smith apples, but these were a blast.

This was easy as pie and yielded some glossy gorgeous caramel apples. I used 6 granny smiths, 2 packages of kraft caramels, doubled the water and vanilla. Definitely refrigerate your apples overnight and put them in the freezer an hour before use. This helps set the caramel. If you want extra caramel coating, refrigerate after the first coating for about and hour and then re-dip.   Great recipe which I will use again and again!

My youngest daughter wanted to make these and I helped her out.  She only made a slight mistake and didn't stir as often as she should have.  The bauble that forms is still a mystery to me.  Not sure why it did.  But over all we enjoyed them.

I used 16 oz of caramels & they barely covered 6 small apples so you may need more if you use large apples.  Instead of melting the caramels in a saucepan, I used a double boiler which worked great!  It kept the caramel soft until the last apple.  After dipping, I just let the excess drip off of apple, then turned it upside down for a couple minutes before I set it down on a piece of pam sprayed wax paper.  The caramel stayed soft & the apples didn't stick to the paper.  Let set at room temp.  Yum!

I love caramel apples, and buying the name brand caramels makes such a difference!

We dip our bottoms in sugar or nuts or chocolate chips to help keep them from sticking before we place them on the wax paper..

These were wonderful!  **NOTE..do NOT use the new "caramel bits" Kraft makes, they don't taste as good-they are waxy**
I have a fall festival for my family each year, including 14 nieces and nephews, ages 1-15.  These were so easy, and there was little mess!  The kids loved them.  I thought they tasted best with the green apples, Granny Smith.  Made exactly like the recipe, thanks!!

Very easy to do, first time making caramel apples and they turned out great - I posted a photo of mine where I covered them in crushed peanuts, mini M&M's, Skor bar pieces and sliced almonds - And then I drizzled them with white and milk chocolate (chips melted in a waterbath) - Sold them at work for a charity fundraiser and 6 were sold before I got them to the table :)  Also used Honeycrisp apples along with the usual Granny Smith apples - Good for Halloween and any fundraiser :)

Followed the recipe and ended up with just enough caramel to cover 4 medium apples. I used a small sauce pan and the caramel was still not deep enough to "dip" the apples. The only way to to cover them was to turn the pan slightly on it's side and spin the apples around in the caramel. I lift them and allow the excess the drip off and then lightly scrape the very bottom of the apple on the edge of the pan and allow the excess to fall back into the pan. We picked our apples up at the orchard but if your apples are store bought, you really need to quickly drop them into boiling or very hot water, rub them with paper or dish towels to remove the wax and then dry them completely so that the caramel will stick. I was serving these the same afternoon and did not refrigerate them. The caramel set up fine and then I drizzled with a little melted chocolate. The kids loved them and we will make them again. Thanks for sharing!

i actually love this one but there are a few things that would have made it easier. first i got the wax off using dishsoap and hot water and scrubbed with a towel second if you freeze the tray first and put parchment on it it works like a dream and if the apples are cold it works better..i put them in the fridge a couple hours and then put them on the tray in the freezer for 15 minutes. the sprinkles need to go on immediately if the apples are cold because it hardens quickly but they come off the parchment very easily that way ( if they stick just stick them back in the freezer a bit)

These are dangerously good!  We had some caramel apples recently this summer at the fair.  They were so yummy I thought it'd be nice to make them at home.  Used medium Fuji apples since that's what I had on-hand.  Also used the Wilton wooden craft sticks...just like the kind they used at the fair.  It was hard to find caramel candies this time of year...stores kept telling me they are a Fall/Halloween type item.  Eventually I did find them, though, in the bulk bin section at Winco.  I dipped the apples in boiling water for about a minute to remove any wax...this might have helped since I didn't have a problem with the caramel slipping off the apples.  I wonder if non-waxed organic apples would help the caramel stick better too.  Also, since other reviewers said the greased aluminum foil method didn't work that well, I tried waxed paper instead.  The caramel apples still stuck a little, but were much easier to peel off after being in the refrigerator overnight.  I might try lightly greased parchment paper next time and see if that helps.  These got gobbled up lickity-split ~ my favorite way to eat apples now!

What a great and simple recipe for a simple treat!  I used Kraft Caramel Bits instead of the regular candy squares and I melted them on the stove instead of the microwave.  Maybe I should have done that because the bits never melted all the way and I ended up with several "clots" of caramel.  Other than that, the caramel stuck very nicely and didn't slide very much at all.  Next time I'm going to melt some chocolate chips and drizzle some of that over the caramel.  Yum!!!  Oh and I actually used Macintosh apples because I like them better.  I save Granny's for the pies!  I also used parchment paper instead of waxed paper.  You have to remember to eat these up in a couple of days.  Otherwise, if they sit around too long the caramel begins to granulate right on the apples!

Very yummy!  My whole family loved them!  I didn't think they were too tough or hard at all.  I used parchment paper, too, instead of aluminum foil.  I just thought there'd be less sticking, and I think I was right.  Delish!!

I just made this and it turned out GREAT!  I can't wait to make more!  I just didn't use the vanilla extract.  Next time I am going to crush some nuts up and roll the apples in it.

wonderfully simple recipe.  I used small granny smith apples and was able to make 12.  I used wax paper to line my pan with instead of the foil.  I will make these again!

We loved these. Be sure to remove the wax from the apple so the caramel will stick better. I put graham crackers, oreo cookies, nuts, and peanuts in the food processor--separately-- and rolled the caramelized apple in it.We also crushed some candy bars for a coating.(snickers and Butterfingers) Drizzled  melted chocolate around the stick and top half of the apple.. YUM!  After they cooled, I put them in cellophane party bags from the dollar store. Adding curly ribbon gave them a festive look. We loved making these.

This is a great recipe! I made these with my two kids who are 8 and 6. At first I thought it would be too messy and hard, but I was wrong! These directions were very easy to follow. The apples tasted great with the caramel not gooey. My kids ate 2 each in less than 30 minutes! And my 8 year old has braces, making it hard to eat this kind of tasty treat!

I followed recipe, melted on stove top not microwave, boiled the apples to remove wax....turned out aweful!  most of caramel slid off, don't know what I did wrong.  What did stay on is just a sticky mess, never really set up like picture.

Tastes great, but don't put them on wax paper, the apples stick really badly.  I don't know how i'm going to package them up and bring them to a harvest dinner tomorrow night.

Great recipe!  I just wished I had scraped off the excess of each apple before they set.  But this recipe is just fantastic.  By the way, I didn't change a thing about it.

Great for Halloween. I used actual twigs gathered from my yard instead of craft sticks. Added a nice twist to presentation. Followed advice of first review and wrapped each apple in a paper towel. Place in large freezer bag and freeze for about an hour prior to dipping apples. Make sure apples are free of condensation before dipping

These were very delicious. I actually doubled the batch but instead of using the 2 whole 14oz packaged caramels, I used 1 bag and about 3/4 of the second bag.  As I was dipping the apples, the caramel was getting very thick and drying quickly resulting in the apples being uneven.  In the end, it came out well and everyone definitely loved them.  Next time, I will not take my time.  I suggest for people to dip fast and swiftly.  :)

I used much more milk than the recipe called for.  Also, I used the carmel morsels instead of wrapped candies-- melt easily & you don't have to unwrap anything.

I just finished making these for Hallowe'en and they turned out perfectly!  I followed the directions exactly.  I got 8 medium sized granny smith apples per batch.  I put sprinkles on some when the caramel was still warm, and drizzled melted chocolate on the rest after they had set.  Can't wait to give them out tonight!

one recommendation is to use soft caramel candy instead of the hard ones. The caramel coating is too crunchy when used the hard caramel candies.

These tasted great, just like your original caramel apple.  It was interesting to experiment with different types of apples and taste the flavor differences. Coating them went fine until the caramel began to cool and got a bit temperamental.

These caramel apples are so good. I think the problem with the caramel running off is a result of all the wax stores and growers spray on to make apples look shiny. If you can find a way to rinse the wax off apples, maybe using vinegar???, then we probably won't have the problem with the caramel running off the apples.

Great texture for dipping apples! Make sure to get the waxy coating off your apples and chill them before dipping to help the caramel stick and cool quickly.

This recipe is perfect even if it's your first time making caramel apples (it was for me)!  The caramel was the perfect consistency plain or to roll in candy (we rolled them in chopped heath bar, finely chopped walnuts, coconut flakes, and mini chocolate chips).  The caramel is soft and chewy and perfect.  I substituted Granny Smiths for Cortland and Honey Crisps from a local farm which were probably larger than your typical Granny Smith, so keep that in mind and add more caramels if you have bigger apples- we barely had enough for the last apple.  DELICIOUS - FIVE STARS!

Very easy recipe!  I make witches brooms out of my caramel apples.  I first wrap them in cellophane and then cut stips in the little paper bags without cutting out the bottom and then place the apples in it then I pull the strips up and tie raffia or brown rope or twine on the top making it look like a broom.  really fun idea for the kids!!

I printed this to go by but ended up using tips from here and the recipe from the Kraft caramels.  Combined the two worked out great.  I doubled the recipe and used a 8 cup mixing bowl.  I heated the caramel as directed.  I would dip a couple of apple and then heat it again for a min or less to get it workable again.  If you spoon the caramel on the top of the apples then roll them around in caramel again they look great.  Also as suggested on the Kraft bag I used the spoon to scrape off the extra caramel on the bottom of the apples.  This helped prevent puddling.  I had also kept the apples (small granny smith) in the fridge overnight to help with that.  These turned out great and looked very nice once I rolled them in nuts.

Tasted fine, but you're better off getting the caramel dip from the store and just using that. I put the apples on the greased aluminum foil, and I couldn't get them off! What we were able to pry from the foil tasted good, but I ended up throwing the whole batch away because we couldn't separate the apples from the metal. It was really disappointing.

Gooey and Yummy!  Didn't use the vanilla however did cook in microwave.  Tried on stove but didn't set up.  Since I was making for a bake sale, I set the carmel apples in a cupcake liner sprayed with a little butter baking spray.  Set in fridge for 15 minutes to cool.  Wrapped them up and tied with a fall colored bow.    Big HIt!

Last weekend I made candy apples using the hard, red candy coating with the red hot candies for a bit of a spicey kick. Love em. Hubby asked me to do some with cramel and I chose this recipe because he said "Plain" was good.  I have to tell you, fast and easy works for me.  The taste?  I can be swayed to a new way of thinking this candy apple thingy. Delicious!

What a hit! My summer camp groups loved these! We followed the recipe and then added drizzled melted chocolate on top. Delicious and easy to make (even with 20 six year olds!).

Just like one you'd get at the state fair!   My only comment would be this... consider what kind of sauce pan you use. I had a hard time coating the last two apples. There was a lot of caramel left, but no way to dip it. I kind of had to paint the caramel onto the apples. The last couple weren't too pretty ;) LOL

We had a great time makint these! The only thing was next time I'll either use extra carmel or a different saucepan because it was hard to coat the apples since I couldn't submerge them.  Kids and family loved them though.

These apples are delicious, I have found it best to use a double broiler for carmel as it will burn if just put on the stove directly. Put on a few sprinkles for a sparkling touch.

What a classic October treat! These bring back fond memories of fall and it just isn't Halloween without them. I had trouble getting the caramel on evenly, it was melted thoroughly and velvety smooth, but thick, maybe I should have added a little more water or milk? The first apple was easy, but the last one was much harder since the caramel had thickened quite a bit in the pan and wasn't dippable, it was a thick gooey spoonable sauce. I have only used the round caramel sheets that you wrap the apple in before and then nuke to melt so I didn't do too badly with my first try at making real old fashioned caramel apples. I did cool these on parchment paper instead of a greased sheet and it worked great.

I agree that the taste on these was great - however, the caramel on mine - about 2/3 of it - slid right off each of the apples onto the wax paper. I dont know if there was too much vanilla or what. I will try again though - but with less vanilla to make it thicker and hopefully it will stick on the apples better!

Very easy and very tasty!  The caramel stuck to the apples really well.  We also rolled the apples in chopped nuts, Oreos, and rainbow sprinkles after dipping them.  Mmm...

These turned out awesome! I have been making caramel apples for a few years and have not been able to find a good recipe. I used a couple tips from others like, if store bought apples boil them for a FEW seconds then place them in the freezer for an hour. When I dipped the apples I held them upside down  for about 30 seconds before placing them on greased wax paper. I made 16 caramel apples so I needed to store them. I did half in cello bags and half in the fridge. The apples in the cello bags melted while the apples in the fridge stayed perfect. Thanks for this yummy easy recipe!

This didn't work out for what we wanted to use them for.  I'm really glad I did a test run on the recipe two days beforehand.  I wanted to make them the day before a girl's birthday party, and then wrap them up in plastic or wax paper and gift them as takeaway gifts.  But this caramel was soooo soft and sticky.  I set the caramelled apple on wax paper to set, put it in the fridge for an hour, and then let it sit on the counter overnight.  It was still horribly soft (I couldn't possible wrap it up) and stuck horrendously to the wax paper.  My daughters didn't even want to try to eat it.  Besides which, unwrapping all those caramels was a big hassle.  I switched to a more traditional boil-sugar-and-butter-to-soft-ball-stage candy recipe, which worked better.  I set the apples on cooking-sprayed Silpat sheet, and rolled them in sprinkles (to cover any stickiness and hopefully enable them to be wrapped).  I give the recipe two stars because this might be a good choice to make with young kids that want to eat the apple right away.  Good luck!
