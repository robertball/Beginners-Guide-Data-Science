In the middle of making this (marshmallow part on brownie) my husband came in the kitchen and said with such enthusiasm "HOLY COW! What's that?!!"turned out pretty good...my recommendations: only cook brownie until 16-17 minutes. Make sure pan is sprayed well as my brownie stuck. I found the peanut a bit overpowering but my husband couldn't stop!

Liked the variety of flavors/textures. Hubby said the rice cereal is what made it for him.
