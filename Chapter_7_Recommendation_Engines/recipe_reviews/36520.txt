HO-LEEE MO-LEEE! Man, this stuff is GOOD! Don't let the seemingly common ingredients fool you - this is incredible on any salad (let's put it this way - I've had salad twice a day since I made this, including a breakfast salad!!).  It's exactly the way I think dressing should be - so tangy, packed with flavor and EASY.  I love that I can store it out in my countertop with my olive oil and vinegars (I put it in an empty balsamic vinegar bottle - very cute!). **For an extra-tasty Greek salad, put the desired amount of dressing in a small bowl, and add at least 1/2 the amount of feta you plan to use.  Stir gently, then let it sit 15 minutes or more before adding to the traditional salad ingredients. Very yummy!
**ADDED LATER**
Made as directed, this dressing will separate very quickly and very thoroughly! Here's how to lessen that: You will have to scale back quite a bit - play with the recipe scaler until the oil and the vinegar together equal an amount that will fit in your blender and still leave mixing room. Then, put everything BUT the oil and the herbs in the blender and start 'er up - medium high should do it. Very slowly drizzle in the olive oil until it is all incorporated. Woohoo! You just emulsified! Stop the blender, add in the herbs, pulse once or twice. Just mix in the herbs, don't chop them - it's prettier. Problem solved!

I took the advice of previous reviews and used equal parts of oil & vinegar.  Also, I used 2 parts red wine vinegar and 1 part balsamic.  

We had a back-yard BBQ and I make a HUGE salad with kalamata olives, thinly-sliced red onion, grape tomatoes, peppercini, and crumbled feta then tossed with this dressing. Everyone loved it!  
My daughter and husband are already asking me to make more!

This truly is absolutely fabulous.  I made this for Father's day and everyone loved it - even my dad who generally doesn't like salad.  I did make one change however.  When I first made it, it seemed much too tart so I added a little sugar - not enough to make it sweet but just enough to cut down on the tartness.  That made it perfect.  I'm sure this will be come a standard in our house.

FANTASTIC!  I like to slice ripe tomatoes, dip them in the dressing, put them on a slice of baguette, top with a bit of freshly grated parm or grated mozzarella, and top it in the broiler for a minute or so.  DELISH!  YUMMY!  I no longer buy the cruet-type dressing mix, this is so much better and cheaper! Thanks for a great recipe!

Amazing!!!  I made a more manageable amount (10 servings)  1/2 cup olive oil, 1 1/3 tsp. each of garlic powder, oregano and basil, 1 tsp. each of salt, pepper, onion powder and mustard, and 2/3 cup off red wine.  It was worth all the calculations!!!

My family and I enjoy this dressing.  We crave for it and probably have it at least 1x per week.  The key to the dressing not tasting vinegary is to use a better than average grade of red wine vinegar and plenty of feta cheese.  The salt in the feta balances out the tanginess of the red wine vinegar.  EXCELLENT!  Thanks for sharing Danielle!

Delicious!  I scaled this down to five servings - so easy to make.  I served this over Good for You Greek Salad and the tanginess of the red wine vinegar was balanced out by the feta cheese.  This dressing is very versatile and I'm sure would be great on pasta salad.

This dressing is sooo good! It tastes great on anything, but I love to use on a pasta salad with bell peppers, mushrooms, sliced kalamata olives, and feta cheese. Yummy!!!!

This is an excellent dressing but, as others have also noted, it has too much vinegar for my taste.  I've scaled it down to about 8 fl. oz, a volume that'll fit comfortably in a small cruet commonly available in supermarkets, upped the oil and the mustard a bit and cut down on the vinegar. Here's how it comes out, and the taste - when drizzled over my salad that includes feta cheese and kalamata olives - is outstanding:

8 Tbs (4 oz) extra virgin olive oil,
1 tsp garlic powder,
1 tsp dried oregano,
1 tsp dried basil,
3/4 tsp pepper,
3/4 tsp  salt,
3/4 tsp onion powder,
1-1/2 tsp Dijon mustard,
5.5 Tbs (2-3/4 oz) red wine vinegar.

Thanks, Danielle, for this outstanding recipe!

Very good recipe. Many comments on this dressing from friends.  It is quite easy to make.  I added a couple cloves of garlic to it and it was outstanding.

This dressing is addictive!  It's absolutely delicious, and makes other storebought dressings seem boring and bland.  And it's very easy and foolproof.  Great recipe!

I scaled this down to 20 servings. It was delicious! It was very tart, so I'd reduce the vinegar to match the oil next time (1 cup each at that scale). Too late this time, so I added a touch of sugar and that took care of it. Delicious. My coworker loves it too. 

Note: you can't quite eat it right away, as the basil and oregano need time to soak up the fluids and soften. If you try to eat it too soon, you'll get a mouthful of crunchy, dried leaves. Letting it sit overnight solved that.

I thought this was exceptional.  I replaced about a third of the vinegar with lemon juice, just because I like lemony Greek dressing.  It was wonderful.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I did a trial run on this, scaling the recipe down to 3 servings.  Made it exactly as directed and it tasted good -- could have used more garlic (perhaps freshly minced), but then again I tasted right after mixing so the flavors didn't have time to blend.  Then I tried the same ingredients - minus the oil - mixed into f/f mayo to make a creamy dressing.  And I have to say, I liked the creamy version better.  Thanks for the inspiration!

Simply delicious!  I made and used this on the Greek Orzo Salad from this site.  WONDERFUL!  I scaled it to 10 servings.  Then I used equal parts of oil (1/2 cup) and vinegar (3 oz red wine vinegar and 1 oz balsamic).  Since that time I've also made it for a spinach/tomatoe/mushroom/black olive/red onion salad that I threw together one evening.  Delicious topped with a bit of parmesan cheese.  I'll make this one over and over again!

If you change the amount to serve 10, you will have enough to use a few different times. The ratio of oil and vinegar are just right - follow the recipe! Also, I used fresh basil from the garden - but I'm sure it is just as good with dried. I got rave reviews using this on a Greek salad & in a pasta salad. I will make it again & again!

I think this is a great basic recipe. I made a few changes based on the other reviews, and the end result was FABULOUS!   First, I scaled the recipe down to 10 servings, and did the following: 1/3 c Red Wine Vinegar 1/3 c Light Balsamic & Basil Vinaigrette (Wish-Bone) 1-1/4 tsp Garlic Powder 1-1/4 tsp Dried Oregano 3/4 tsp Dried Basil 3/4 Dried Rosemary 1 tsp Black Pepper 1 tsp Kosher Salt 1 tsp Onion Powder 1 tsp Dijon Mustard (generic brand) 1/2 c Extra Light Olive Oil  1 Pinch of sugar About 4-8 drops of lemon concentrate   I used extra light olive oil because it has a more delicate flavor than extra virgin olive oil (which has a more rich flavor). I also used only 3/4 tsp dried basil because the balsamic vinaigrette I used has basil in it.  I added the olive oil at the end and blended everything in my bullet for a few seconds and it tastes wonderful! Thanks so much :)

I decreased the recipe down to 10 servings.  I further decreased the amount of oregano and basil because I'm not a big fan of those.  I used about 1/2 tsp. each instead of the 1 1/4 tsp suggested by the decreased recipe.  I thought it was quite good and even though the recipe said to serve at room temp, I put it in the refrig for a bit.  My husband thought it was tart but he has a sweet tooth.  I thought it was just right.  Will make again for sure.

This is a good dressing that can be a great dressing with just a few changes.  Use FRESH herbs and garlic. Use 1/2 apple cider vinegar (less sour, more mellow flavor) , 1/2 white wine vinegar and use onion juice instead of onion powder.  It's fantastic!!

This was very tasty. I scaled it down to two people and it made enough for four of us. It was a little oily for my tastes (still yummy however) so I may try to cut down on the oil the next time I make it.Thanks for the recipe.

I saw this today and wanted to give it a try. The original recipe is for 120 servings! So, I typed in 5 on the recipe page and clicked calculate. It made about 2/3 cup of dressing or enough for 5 salads. I added a tad bit more olive oil to taste. If I make again I might add a pinch or two of sugar, to cut through some of the vinegar though. But, it worked great for what I needed it for today.

Wow. They are not kidding.  This dressing IS fabulous!  Both my husband and I loved this dressing.  I scaled it down to 4 servings and slightly increased the oil to equal the amount of vinegar.  The only other change was to use fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  This dressing is so versatile.  It was outstanding on a penne pasta salad with feta cheese, black olives, red and green bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, italian parsley and a little crushed red pepper.  Also, this dressing makes a fabulous marinade for chicken.  I marinated overnight, browned the chicken and then baked it at 350.  I highly recommend this one.  It is a winner.  I will be making this dressing frequently.

This dressing is fabulous!  The only change I made was to add some fresh crushed garlic.  Well, and I scaled the recipe to 10 servings.  It's just the 2 of us and we'll have plenty for the week.  We like to have a salad with every meal and are trying to get away from the creamy Ranch dressings that we normally have.

This is really good. I made a Greek pasta salad. I cut it down to 30 serving. One large mason jar full. It is also really good if you add a container of finely crumbled feta. 

1 1/2 C. Olive Oil
4 tsp. garlic powder
4 tsp. dried oregano
4 tsp. dried basil
1 Tbs. Pepper
1 Tbs. Salt
1 Tbs. Onion Powder
1 Tbs Dijon Style Mustard
2 C. Red Wine Vinegar

This is an extremely salty and sour dressing.  Consider that most recipes call for an oil:vinegar ratio of 2:1 and this recipe calls for 3:4.  Cut the vinegar in half and go from there.  Also, it is too salty, and that's after tasting it on plain lettuce--imagine adding it to a salad with lots of salty feta cheese in it!  You could also do without the onion powder, seeing as how your Greek salad probably already has some tasty red onion in it.

I use this dressing every week.  I don't even bother with store bought anymore. I have tried this recipe many way and I actually like it better with white wine vinegar.  I don't add salt.  If it's too tart an extra pinch or two of sugar goes a long way.  Fabulous recipe, thanks!!!

Has anyone else scaled the recipe down to 10 servings, I am disappointed it tastes like vinegar I'm letting it set and will taste again.  Just wondering, I figured no one would be making the 120 servings.

Instead of powder, I used super minced, fresh garlic & onion. I also didn't have any red wine vinegar, so instead I used balsamic. The dressing came out just the right amount of tangy! Mix in some feta cheese & it can be used as a dip for bread as well.

OH MY THIS IS YUMMY! I changed only two things. I did not have red wine vinegar so I simply added red wine and a splash of distilled white vinegar. It's amazing...

Really yummy! It gets better after you let it sit for a few days and the flavours all come together.  The only change I made was I used equal parts EVOO and vinegar to take away some of the bite since it is a little tart.

When I saw how few/simple ingredients this recipe called for, I must admit I was a little skeptical.  However, it is REALLY good!  I served in on grilled chicken salads (using Grilled Chicken Over Spinach marinade from this site....the flavors were very complimentary!) and it rocked!  I didn't have onion powder, so I used minced onion and I subbed yellow for dijon mustard.   I added 2 tsp of minced garlic and a dash of crushed red pepper. I will make this regularly; thanks for sharing!  I think it will also make an excellent meat marinade!  UPDATE:  This dressing IS very vinegary...I happen to like vinegar so as written is good for me.  If you're not a huge vinegar fan, you'll prob want to decrease the vinegar a little.

This was good and easy. I scaled it down to 5 servings and made a traditional Greek salad (lettuce, onions, roma tomatoes, kalmata olives, cucumbers, pickled beets, and feta.) I made it a meal for two by topping with two chicken breasts grilled on the "George Foreman". I also added about a T of feta, a T of juice from the pickled beats, and a pich of sugar. This pretty much duplicated my favorite Greek restaurants dressing and the pickled beat juice gives it a lovely pink color!

This recipe is very good, but I felt like it was missing a "kick".  I think next time I would add a little red pepper.  I found it odd that I could keep it on the counter, so I put it in the frige.  Whoops!  I see that the oil turns from a liquid to a solid.  Live and learn :o)

I scaled this down as did other reviewers and had some left over.  It holds up well, maybe even improving a bit.  Tarpon Springs is a Greek community in the Greater Tampa Bay area, and this dressing is as good as anything that I've ever had in any restaurant there.  In the Tampa area, restaurants typically serve Greek salad with a mound of mayonnaise-based potato salad in the center under the greens.  I didn't have the time to make potato salad this time, but will do that in the future.  In my opinion, there's nothing to tweak here.  It just doesn't get any better than this.  This is a incredibly good and authentic-tasting  salad dressing!!

I was really impressed with this dressing, I am not, rather was not a salad person and this recipe has changed that.  I noted that several other users had reduced the amount of vinegar and so I tried that and it came out really nice.  I have also invested in a small bottle of balsamic vinegar made by Lucini and I can really taste the difference from my other balsamic Vinegar.  I would certainly recommend this recipe.

What I like about home made dressings is that you can cut down on any spice or seasoning you like. We thought this was good, but not as outstanding as the majority of the reviewers. The ingredients seemed rather basic as you might use in many other salad dressings. I'll definitely make this again Danielle and I'd love to use this as a marinade for chicken. Thanks!

I love Greek salads and found this dressing to be outstanding. Too many dressings are bland but this one is not.  The spices and mustard give it a superb flavor. I am on a modified Atkins and this dressing with only 2g carbohydrates and only 104 calories fits the bill.

This is a wonderful dressing.  It was a bit too tart for my taste, so I added some sugar until it tasted right for me.  I think the tartness level is all about personal preference.  I had no idea that you could change the serving size on the recipe page and hit the calculate button to choose the number of serving you want to make until I read a review for this dressing that said so!  This could have saved me lots of time in the past...

I scaled this to 20 servings, which made the ingredient amounts easy to work with (no 1 cup + 1 tablespoon + 2 1/2 teaspoons stuff).  20 servings yielded 16 ounces.  I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I substituted balsamic vinegar.  Also, I kept the vinegar:oil ratio equal, and it turned out great!

I did not like this at all.  With all the positive reviews I was super excited, but I will not be making this again.  It was wayyyyyyy too vinegary, and I like vinegar.  I even bought a more expensive vinegar in excitement/anticipation of this.

Scaling to 10 servings is the perfect amount. It was much better after changing its balance by adding more garlic, and definately lessening the vinegar ratio to oil amount.

Excellent!  Adjusted recipe to make much smaller batch so I ended up with about 2/3 cup total dressing.  Did not have onion powder, added fresh lemon juice instead, about 1-2x as much as I would have used for onion powder.  Added slightly more mustard than called for.  Came out really good.  Has to be mixed and poured right away before it separates; or make it into a cruet and shake immediately before each use.  I used it on a tortellini pasta salad with feta, tomatoes and other veg and it was very fresh and tangy.  My batch, about 2/3 c,  was a perfect amount for a batch of pasta salad (enough salad to fill a medium mixing bowl).

LOVE this.  I didn't think the vinegar taste was too strong at all.  I did run out of red wine vinegar and had to make up the difference with balsamic but that was the only change I made, save scaling it back to 10 servings.  I'm using it to make a pasta salad with feta, red onions, tomatoes, cucumbers and olives.  It tastes fantastic.  The *only change I would make is to reduce the black pepper as it's a little much but this is REALLY good dressing.

What a surprise that this was the "absolutely" best Greek House Dressing ever.   Family raved about it for days;  and it has now become our favorites dressing for all kinds of lettuce/noodle salads.  Even great as a marinade.  I make it in large quantities and it doesn't last long before I need to make another batch.

I liked this dressing a lot -- and thought my Greek salad of romaine, plum tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, and feta was delicious -- but my boyfriend found the dressing too sharp. I definitely will make this again, but I probably will use less vinegar next time.

LOVE this dressing.  I use fresh garlic and onions, but aside from that, I followed the recipe exactly and my whole family loves it!  I have made it 4 times in the last 4 weeks.

The only reason I'm giving this recipe a 4 is because of a flaw in the directions. As other members have mentioned it is necessary to add the oil at the end (either using a whisk or a blender) in order to emulsify the dressing so it doesn't separate. Other than that, this is outstanding! It was very easy to make. Even my picky husband, who normally hates vinaigrette dressings liked it! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe, Danielle!

This recipe tastes really good when you mix it with feta cheese crumbles and let it sit for about 15 mins before pouring onto the salad.

I only give 5 stars to recipes I absolutely love and want to impress others. It does have a kick to it, the vinger, but too acidic. Next time, I will try balsamic vinegar isntead to give it a sweeter taste since I don't like to use sugar in my cooking. It was tasty and great to have on hand since I do not buy bottled salad dressings from the grocery shelves since most contain too many preservatives and sugar. I will use this again but it wasn't GREAT, but good.

I scaled to 12 servings and it was great.  Make sure to use a good red wine vinegar, it will certainly make a difference in this recipe.

I have been searching high and low for a Greek dressing in the supermarket and was thrilled when I found this recipe.  I scaled it down to 10 servings and was very pleased with the outcome.  I think the herbs may have been a bit overpowering so I may cut back next time, but overall I really liked this dressing.

Sorry to have to disagree with most here, but this dressing is WAAAY too vinegar heavy!  The rule of thumb with most vinaigrettes is 2 parts oil to 1 part vinegar.  The strong flavor of the vinegar did not let the other herbs come through. This was a fail.

We've been making this dressing for a while and it is very good. We were out of red wine vinegar so we decided to use the white balsamic vinegar we had on hand. What an improvement!!!! It gave it a milder vinegry taste without the bite. From now on it will only be white balsamic vinegar. We prefer the white so it doesn't give the dressing that pinkish tinge.

This is a wonderful, solid go-to dressing for a Greek salad. I made it exactly as printed (but scaled down, of course!) and my family raved about it. I also made Greek-style marinated lamb chops and a little of this dressing was fabulous on the lamb. I'm a classic home-made French vinaigrette kind of girl, but this dressing is going to be added to my salad repetoire from now on.

FANTASTIC! We are a large family and don't get to eat out that often. But I used this recipe for Greek Night at home and it was SO close to our favorite restaurants dressing. I used equal parts red and white vinegar instead of just the red wine vinegar and it turned out perfect for our taste!

Great recipe for dressing, Thank you Danielle M. for sharing this!  I have always preferred to make my own and cannot stand 'store bought' dressing.  My one concession to time has been to use the packaged dressings (only vinaigrette type) that you mix in a carafe.  This dressing blows them all away!  I really love it on my mothers recipe for tomato salad, which consists of slices of tomato, cucumber, and red onion!

Good but certainly not fabulous. I found it to be to tangy so I added some sugar and it did tame it down somewhat but it was still too acidic. Next time I will use less vinegar

Delicious.  I adjusted the recipe for 12 servings and stuck pretty close to the recipe.  Based on other reviews I used equal parts olive oil and vinegar.  I also used 2 parts red wine vinegar to 1 part balsamic vinegar instead of all red wine vinegar.  For the 12 serving size I use 1/2 C oil and 1/2 C vinegar mixture.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks!

So worth 5 STARS!  So simple and easy.  I did cut it down to 10 servings to try it and now wish I had made the whole batch!  I put it on some pasta with tomatoes, black olives, red onion.....mmmm good!  thank you for a great recipe.

This is the best Italian/Greek dressing recipe that I have ever tried!  I make it exactly as listed and I have shared this recipe with many people.  

Years ago I purchased a cruet for making the "Good Seasons" Italian dressing (spice mix that you add to oil, water and vinegar).  If you recalculate this recipe for 10 servings, it fits perfectly in the Good Seasons bottle.

Just like the name says - absolutely fabulous! I served it over a salad of romaine, spinach, grape tomatoes, black olives, feta and croutons. We loved it. I scaled the recipe back to 8 servings. The great thing about this dressing is that it is so flavorful, a little bit goes a long way, which is good if you are watching calories. I love vinegar, so I didn't mind the 'bite' at all.

Absolutely loved this.  I scaled this down to 10 and used equal parts red wine vinegar and EVOO.  I would quite possibly make a higher ratio of red wine vinegar to EVOO next time to see if that's even better.  All spices I increased to 1.5 times their stated measurements for the scale down.  LOVED THIS!  I served this over a greek veggie salad which consisted of chunk cucumbers, chunk red onion, chunk tomatoes, garbanzo's and kalamata's.  I was planning to add artichokes too but ran out and will absolutely add them next time.  This salad was PERFECT with this dressing!

Absolutely fabulous is right!  I will NEVER buy greek dressing again.   If you have trouble with it seperating I would mix the mustard with vineger and seasoning and slowly whisk in oil after.  Works like a charm.  I keep mine in the frige though.

I can't get enough of this dressing!  I did, like others, use equal amounts of oil and vinegar, but I also tried something that everyone seems to love.  Make the dressing exactly as in the recipe, but don't add the vinegar.  Let it set a while, and it makes fantastic dipping oil for toasted Italian bread with your next pasta meal.  When you're ready for salad dressing, combine equal portions of oil mixture and vinegar. YUM!!

While photographing this dressing, I decided to taste it cause it looked so good!  It was delicious...however when I finished taking the photo I realized I FORGOT to add the red wine vinegar!  I thought this would be an amazing bread dipping oil...LOL.  After adding the red wine vinegar, I thought it was a bit strong.  Will probably cut back on the vinegar the next time I make it.  It's a keeper!

Fabulous!  I used white wine vinegar though. I added some black olives, whole garlic cloves and feta.  PS: Dont use apple cider vinegar!  :)

This seemed like a pretty ordinary vinaigrette dressing to me.  I like vinegar flavor a lot, but I think I'd try adding a bit of sugar like others have suggested to cut the tanginess some.

I scaled this recipe down to 8 servings and it was more than enough for a family sized salad for 3 nights.  After reading some of the reviews regarding the "vinegary" taste, I added 1/3 c. red wine vinegar and 1 T. balsamic vinegar instead of the 1/2 c. plus 2 t. red wine vinegar the scaled down recipe called for.  Loved it!  We were die hard Good Seasons italian lovers, but now we're converts!  Thanks Danielle for sharing a great recipe!

A good recipe if you do not like sweet salad dressing.  I found I prefered to decrease the amount of vinegar down to where it was almost equal with the amount of oil. Good recipe to experiment with.  Sometimes I scale recipe down to 10 servings, then added a finely minced home grown tomato to the mix.  Excellent.  But I would keep the dressing in the fridge if you add the tomato.  And it does taste better after it sits for several hours.

Great!  This is wonderfully tangy.  I only had half the red wine vinegar needed, so substituted balsamic for the remainder.  Served it over mixed greens with feta & chopped kalamata olives.

Great dressing.  If you drop the servings down to 15 you get the appx 2 cup version.  I also mix it up in a small sauce pan, then add 1 tsp corn starch dissolved in water and heat till just dissolved and clear - dressing no longer separates, and will cling to the salad a lot better.

Thanks AngKN for doing the math for me. This is a good, solid recipe. For those that thought it tasted too acidic, let it be for a couple of days and let the flavors meld. I used this as a marinade for prosciutto stuffed cherry peppers and everyone I gave them to, scarfed them up like they were starving to death. AND asked for the dressing recipe. Oh yes they did. Thanks for sharing. :o)

This is truly an example of "the sum being greater than its parts!"  The only change I made was equal parts oil and vinegar (as suggested) and I used 3 parts red wine vinegar and 1 part balsamic (again, as suggested).  Scaled this to 10 servings (1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup vinegar) and it was 100% AMAZING!  My family was here and we started dipping crusty bread into it and ended up eating the whole batch - I had to make it again for the actual salad!  No problem because it takes all of about 5 minutes!  I'll be making a bunch of this and emulsifying in the blender (add the oil slowly!) and store it in an oil bottle with pourer on the counter top with my oils and vinegars (no refrigeration needed!).  I probably won't buy salad dressing ever again.  THANK YOU!

Made it- it's simple and easy. And holy guacamole, this greek dressing is INcredible!!!! I made jusr enough for one big bowl of greek salad- 1/3 cup oil, 1/2 cup vinegar, 1 tsp each garlic, basil, oregano, 1/3 tsp each salt, pepper, onion, and mustard. Poured it over my romano/cucumber/bell pepper/onion/feta/tomato mix and got a kind of magic!

I just made this for the first time and for my taste, it had too much vinegar.  It was good but next time I will add more olive oil, cut back on the vinegar, and add some lemon and a little sugar.  Most vinaigrette type dressings are 1/3 vinegar ratio to oil, and this recipe calls for more vinegar than oil.  I found it overpowering.  I live near Tarpon Springs Florida which has wall to wall Greek restaurants.  They use a big scoop of potato salad on top of their Greek salads and once you have it that way, you'll never want it any other way, so give it a try!  I just buy the red potato salad from Publix rather than making it and that saves a lot of work.  It's not the goopy stuff you usually get at stores.

Yummy! So much better than any store bought dressing! I did add a *little* sugar to calm down the bite of the vinegar. Delicious on a quinoa Greek salad (quinoa, tomatoes, cucumber, feta, and kalmata olives)

So yummy...used fresh garlic cloves instead of garlic powder, Mrs. Dash Onion and Herbs instead of onion powder, and grainy Dijon mustard. Also used herb-infused olive oil and added honey to decrease the tartness. AMAZING! This will be my "House" dressing. Thanks..

LOVE LOVE LOVE this dressing.  To me it is more of an italian vinaigrette than greek dressing but great nonetheless. I adapted this recipe to 4 servings and it was plenty for a very large salad.  A little goes a long way.

This is the first time I made this, it is fantastic!  I agree with the others, don't let the simple ingredients fool you! I revised 3 ingredients because I didn't have (onion powder, garlic powder or dijon mustard) I substitued with Lemon & Onion Seasoning, minced garlic, and spicy brown mustard.  It was D-O-LIOUS!

I LOVED this! I scaled down the recipe for 12 servings. So easy and delicious! Will make again. The only sub I made was swapping spicy brown mustard for dijon because it's what I had on hand. Gave it a great kick!

I was really excited to find this recipe with so many 5-star reviews and thought it'd be nice to have a big ol' batch on hand, instead of my usual one-salad-at-a-time recipe. As other reviewers have noted, this recipe is bitter (and all the more if, like me, you end up having to throw the whole batch away, wasting all those good ingredients). I also found that proportions of garlic powder and onion powder gave it a fake taste, compared to the real thing. (And, in case you're wondering, I was using fresh, quality powders). Maybe I've gotten spoiled, but I think I'll stick to my old classic, which uses fresh garlic. The shelf-life isn't as long, but it tastes like Greek dressing is supposed to taste.

Wow. this was so sour I still almost pucker my face at the thought!! I salvaged it by adding 5 T. raw sugar to 20 servings. I followed the first review and emulsified it in the blender and it worked like a charm! After the sugar, it tastes like the authentic Greek restaurant's dressing in town. They bottle it and sell it. Now I have the recipe :)) Oh, and I also thought it sounded like too much pepper so I cut that in half. With these changes, it gets 4 1/2 stars!

AbFab Greek Dressing Haiku: "So easy to make. Packs quite a flavorful punch.  Beats store Greek dressings!" I scaled this way back in order to serve it on a salad for two, and only changed using part red wine vinegar to part balsalmic. At first dribble, I was like "wow, this has TOO much flavor!", but after perching a nice ratio of feta to greens on my fork, it all came together for a symphony of Greek goodness in my mouth. It doesn't take much of this dressing to lube a salad and I wouldn't recommend dumping it on too liberally as it's very tangy. But for items that are always on hand, this is a much tastier and elegant alternative to any store-bought Greek dressings.

The only thing I changed was using equal parts red wine and balsalmic vinegar.  I like the tangy kick of the balsalmic.  I'm sure it's prefect as is too.  The only bad thing is no other dressing will compare after having this stuff!  Thanks a million for sharing this.

This was great as is, but if you choose to not use it on a salad with feta, you may want to cut back on the vinegar. Wonderful!

This is awesome! I made greek salad with cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, red onion, feta and kalamata olives and it was addicting with this dressing. I had read the reviews before making it so I decided to add a teaspoon of sugar to the mix to cut the sourness of the vinegar, but in retrospect I don't think it was really necessary. I used it as marinade tonight for chicken (mixed with white wine) and it's pretty awesome. Overall a pretty amazing (and easy) way to make your own dressing.

I didn't think it would be anything special because of the basic ingredients...but I was wrong!  This is great dressing!  I served it on a Mediterranean Salad (lettuce, tomato, cucumber, red onion, feta, olives, and croutons).  Delicious!

I brought it to dress a salad for a work potluck today and rec'd many compliments.  I'm usually not so big into the vinegary/oily dressings but this is now easily in my top 5 ever.  I scaled to 12 servings.  I used equal parts OO and vinegar  and had to mix red wine vinegar, balsamic and rice wine vinegar because I didn't have the full amount of RWV. Subbed a couple minced shallots for the onion powder. Eyeballed the dijon.  Also added a wee bit of ground cayenne.  Yes, I made a few changes. Still I have no doubt it's a 5 star as written.  I plan to make more and keep in our fridge.

I tried this recipe (cut it way down) several months ago and forgot to rate it.  This dressing is the bomb!  We all loved it. The only problem that I have is keep some in the fridge.  Thank goodness it's easy to make.  Thanks for sharing Danielle

I love Greek Salads and dressings but this was just too tart for me!  I anticipated that it would be so I used equal parts vinegar and oil.  Will try to adjust the taste and substitute lemon juice for the vinegar next time.

I have been trying to find a dressing that is healthy but doesn't taste like vinegar and is sugar-free. This is it! It's definitely lick-your-plate good and I didn't change a thing. I would follow another reviewer's advice of emulsifying the oil and vinegar in the blender to help with the separation issue.

I love this simple dressing recipe!  Next time I will add some lemon zest to it but I think if I added lemon juice it would become too tart. For some reason, I also want to put this dressing on a Italian Hero sandwich. A new staple at our house!  UPDATE:  Added the lemon zest and it made the dressing taste very Greek. I poured about a 1/4 over a container of FETA cheese to marinate and this is to die for!!! UPDATE: UPDATE:  ADD 1 T of dried MINT....sends it through the  roof!!!

I needed salad dressing for a last minute bbq, but not 3 quarts, so I scaled this for 10 servings and found it to be a winner!  Delicious and clearly a very flexible recipe. I only let it sit up at room temperature for 2 hours prior to serving and it lacked nothing, very flavorful. Loved that it uses common ingrediants I always have on hand in my spice rack. If you have fresh herbs, go for it, but there's no need when this makes a fantastic dressing with dried. This recipe impressed everyone at the bbq. Thank you!

I made this the other night with cold bowtie pastas, tomatoes, feta cheese, cucumbers, red onion, chicken - for a greek pasta salad.  It was amazing- and I'm making it again tonight to serve for a luncheon tomorrow.  It's better the next day.  ***NOTE - I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL THIS RECIPE THAT THERE IS A CONVERSION AREA ON THIS WEBSITE AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUT IN HOW MANY SERVINGS YOU WANT. IT WAS VERY HELPFUL***

I absolutely love this stuff. It's all I use on my salad, pasta salad and as a marinade. I do equal parts of vinegar and olive oil and I also use honey dijon mustard. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

The BEST ever! I scaled this back to 8 servings, big mistake. Now I have to make more. I also added just a bit of sugar to reduce the tartness a little, but not making it sweet. My husband loves tart oil and vinegar dressings. I will make this just as it is for him.

This is my absolute favorite dressing recipe!  I just made it for the 4th or 5th time...stores great and goes with everything.  I'm using it on a basic veggie/pasta salad today...yumm! I scale it to 10 servings and it makes the perfect amount to store in a mason jar.  Thanks for posting this great recipe!

This recipe makes a really delicious dressing.  I substituted real garlic (pressed) for the powdered, and used fresh basil instead of dried.  I served this to guests at a recent dinner party that was Greek-themed.  It was such a hit I had to give them a copy of the recipe before they left that evening.

Another awful dressing recipe that no one liked.  I made the recipe scaled down to 12 servings, so maybe that made the difference.  It turned out very bitter and tasted of vinegar and nothing else.

I am soooo happy to have found this recipe. I've never been able to duplicate the dressing at my favorite pizza place and now I can! Using the automatic scaling feature I scale it down to 10 servings. Depending on what is in my cupboard, I have successfully substituted apple cider and/or balsamic vinegar for red wine vinegar.

I wouldn't exactly call this "absolutely fabulous," as its title suggests, but -- it is good for a vinagrette-style dressing.  As many others have already mentioned, you might either cut down on the red wine vinegar called for, add more olive oil, add a bit of sugar, substitute balsamic, or do all three of those things to cut the arguably 'too-tart' flavor.  (I would also recommend letting the flavors combine overnight before using.)  All in all, this is decent, but nothing particularly special.

i found this recipe to be tasty but strong on the vinegar. I would either reduce the vinegar, or do what I did and add some more olive oil to suit your taste.

I scaled this down to one serving before going for the mother-lode of 12.  I found this to call for more vinegar than needed. I tried to acommodate this problem by adding a little more of the spices, tiny bit more oil, and decided to add parmesan cheese (can-type) to experiment.  Tastes really alot better now.  I will add to favorites and see what happens.  The recipe is alot like how I top bread sticks but without butter!

This is a great all around salad dressing.  I use it on greek salad and almost everything except salads with fruit.  We have trouble keeping enough on hand. I usually make a version scaled down for 12.

I used this as the dressing on the site's "Greek Orzo Salad" and it was a perfect match. I scaled it down to 15 servings, used a little over 1 cup on the pasta salad and still have about 2/3 cup left--can't wait to try it on some lettuce!

I thought this recipe waS wonderful. I am one who likes the strong red wine vinegar taste. If you don't, reduce the amount of red wine vinegar and increase the amount of olive oil. I prefer this recipe over buying one.

This recipe has  become a staple in our house.  After having this recipe, all others just seem so sweet.  I find that it is  best, since you are using dried herbs, to let the finished dressing sit for a day before using, as this will better infuse the dressing with the flavors.

This is a good basic greek salad dressing and one you should try although I wouldn't refer to it as something exceptional -- it's good. Quick to make with standard ingredients from the pantry and easy to modify according to tastes. Added lots o' garlic, onions, and parsley and used it to marinate chicken strips/pieces that were folded into pita bread. Yummy.

Used the first post in comments to scale down the amount of dressing. Super delicious. I think a popular restaurant in my neighbour uses this because it tastes exactly the same. Perfect!!

Follow recipe and you'll get what you get in the restaurants =very good!  Fyi, you can scale down serving size in the site itself.  Just Adjust servings size. I had to say that because someone else went in to this big trouble to calculate serving size for less

I made this dressing "as is" the first time and scaled it down to 10 servings. It got four stars. But I did it all over again with a few modifications. 1] Balance the oil to vinegar ratio to 1:1. 2] Use freshly minced garlic instead of powder. 3] Put ALL ingredients except olive oil in a food processor or blender. 4] Add sundried tomato powder. TaRAAAA - a perfect dressing for any salad and an amazing marinade!

Fantastic recipe as it is but I tweaked it a bit to suit family tastes.  I took the advice from previous reviewers and reduced the oil to 1/4 cup (for 12 servings) and added 1/4 cup water, then I changed the vinegar to 1/2 cup red wine vinegar and 1/4 cup balsamic.  LOVE it!  We're big-time salad eaters in our house so I'm always trying different dressing recipes and this one is a huge hit with all of us.  I've made it when having company over and a friend who said that they didn't like "Caucasian food" could not stop eating the salad with this dressing - pasta with cucumber, peppers, black olives, feta cheese, tomatoes, onions and this dressing ;)

I just made this recipe again and used half olive oil and half safflower oil.  There is absolutely no taste difference in my opinion.  What I DID notice is that the ingredients emulsified with just shaking--the oil and vinegar did not separate. I also realized that I had omitted the mustard the first time but didn't this time.  Gee!  What a difference that one ingredient makes!//  This recipe is a keeper!  I used the scaled down recipe.  Critical to the dressing, in my opinion, is to make it ahead and let it sit a day or so so that all the ingredients can incorporate. It just doesn't taste that good right after it's made but rather much better after it sits. It does have a strong vinegar taste but that will also depend on the acidity of the red wine vinegar that you use. If you have doubts or are not a 'vinegar' person, don't add all the vinegar at one but rather taste and add.  Love the fact that it doesn't have to be refrigerated, too.  Will make this again and again.

OMGosh is this dressing FaBuLoUs – just like the title suggests!  I did cut the recipe down to 20 servings as I didn’t need 120 servings!  I read through many of the reviews and they talked about there being too much vinegar.  I made it as written for the scaled down version and my family really enjoyed it as written, so that is how I will continue to make it.   I like that this doesn’t have to be refrigerated.  I love making our dressing from scratch and this one quickly moved to favorites list.

Loved this recipe, thank you for sharing it!  I have been on a greek salad kick lately and came across this.  The only thing I did slightly different was the mustard, I used what I had in the fridge which was a Dijon mustard made with chardonnay. Loved it so much I had greek salads for many days in a row just so I could use this lol

I have been searching for a recipe like this for years after falling in love with the dressing at a favorite Greek restaurant back East. I made it as written the first time and it was really good, but then made some slight changes to make it my own. First off, what home cook makes 4 quarts of dressing at a time?! I scaled it down to 10 servings and got enough dressing for 4 large entree salads. For the vinegar, I used a combination of white wine and white balsamic vinegars, plus some fresh lemon juice to make it almost equal parts oil and vinegar. The last addition was some fresh, smashed garlic. I put it all in a medium sized canning jar and shook it up, then left it in the refrigerator overnight and shook it like crazy again the next day! I also use this dressing to marinate tomatoes for "Mama's Best Broiled Tomato Sandwich", found on this website.

This dressing really is fabulous.  The second time I made it I cut back on the vinegar (equal parts EVOO and red wine vinegar) and omitted the mustard to use in a Greek pasta salad and it made a wonderful pasta salad!  I will make it many times again with these two revisions for both green salads and pasta salads.  Thank you for sharing!

This morning I scaled this recipe down to 15 servings and marinated some pounded chicken breasts in half of the dressing all day. (I reserved the other half of the dressing for salad.)Come dinner time we threw the chicken on the barbeque, cooked one side, turned the chicken over on the grill and sprinkled feta cheese over top of chicken while browning the second side. So yummy! We served it with a green salad with the reserved other half of the dressing.

Very, very good! I was looking for a version with lemon but found this instead. Tasty! I changed the servings to 10 to get fairly easy quantities and enough for more than one dinner. I save an old preserves jar for this use. Just mix right in the jar, screw the top on and shake, shake, shake. No blender or bowl to clean and already in a sealed place for storage.

Wonderful !!  We love greek salad from our favorite greek restaurant and this dressing is sensational.  Thank you.  I used Calendars Greek seasoning in place of the herbs/spices just to make it easier on me.  And I added a splash of lemon juice only because I love lemons. And I also minced some fresh garlic into the dressing.  Sensational !

Loved this!  Scaled to 15 for the perfect amount - that also fits in standard / Good Seasoning dressing bottle.  Will make again!  No need to refrigerate.  Follow suggestions and emulsify the oil in at the end, then pulse in the oregano & basil.

I have enjoyed this recipe for a long time but decided to change it, I think, for the better at least for me. On 30 servings I took out the salt, for my health, and added 1 tablespoon of crumbled Feta cheese to make it creamier. I love it even when I run out of Feta cheese for my Fabulous Greek Salad. I wouldn't change your Pizza for the world. PS- The Feta cheese will counteract the tartness of the wine vinegar.

I just finished my salad and did not like this dressing.  I am a huge fan of Greek salad and love Greek dressing. However, this was just too sour, way too much vinegar in it!!!!  I am still looking, don't even think I want to play with this one.

I have made this a few times and it always turns out beautifully! I was making it again today, and realized that I had no garlic powder...no worries! I mashed a couple of fresh cloves of garlic with a bit of the required salt, and it worked just as well. Thank you for this!
P.S. I find that you can't really tell how this type of dressing tastes until it's "married" with the salad ingredients for a couple of hours.
I love this recipe as is.

Wonderful dressing.  I scaled back to serve 10.  Perfect fit for my little Good Season's carafe.  I added a heavy pinch of sugar which made it even better.

WAYYYYYY too much vinegar.  And not enough of some of the other seasonings.  I tweaked this recipe down to 12 servings, and then followed other directions for how much seasoning to use.  Also followed the advice of using equal vinegar and oil.  Also followed the advice of emulsifying to get everything to blend together rather than having the oil and other ingredients all separat (thanks for that tip!). I can mostly taste vinegar.  And usually I like vinegar in dressing and significantly reduce the oil.  I will continue my search for a good greek dressing.

I reduced the serving size to 4 and mixed the ingredients accordingly. It is absolutely delicious! Makes you want to eat more salad so you can have more of the dressing. A keeper for sure!

I really liked this! It was extremely simple and used basic ingredients. I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand so I used white wine vinegar, and I didn't have onion powder so I went without. I put a splash more of olive then called for, but that is the great thing about this recipe - you really can eye everything and tailor it to your liking. It was delicious and had great balance.

I made the recipe without any substitutions or quantity adjustments and my husband said that it gave him heartburn. He is a billygoat, so for him to find something difficult to eat is shocking. However, I will make it again using less vinegar - I think it's yummy and better than store-bought dressings and will be perfect with that modest adjustment.

This recipe was so easy and good. I thought it needed a little more acidity so I added the juice from half a lemon.  It was okay without it but better with the lemon, but since that is personal taste I think this recipe deserves the 5 stars!  I reduced the servings to 10 and filled my large Tupperware bread bowl with vegetables.

A good, solid vinaigrette, easy to make anytime. Thanks for sharing.. it was delicious. A tip for some, however, this recipe might be smoother with less herbs, and don't substitute any. If you don't have one, go without. Mine turned out a bit herby the second time around, and I may not like the dijon. (I used yellow the first time, and it was fine.) Not sure... but not the best ever.

To be fair I always make the recipe as shown.... I did find  the sauce  a bit to sweet for my taste... So I added a splash of soya sauce for a depth ..... Pour the sauce over the chicken and baked... I served the extra sauce in side Bowls for dipping... With a spinach and egg salad... Perfect.. Hubby loved it... Thanks

I changed this for 6 servings and it tasted just like restaurant salads! Very vinegar-y but in a good way. I added a tsp of honey just to sweeten it a bit. Will def make again.

This stuff is AWSOME!  I downsized the recipe to 15 servings. Made it 2 days before serving it for dinner. (bottled and Fridged it)  I cut back a bit on the red wine viniger and added about 1/4 cup of Helmanns Olive Oil Mayo. Blended it a couple minutes in my ole blender. It turned out real smooth and creamy.   I made the the basic Greek Salad to put it over. YUMIEEEEE. Thanks, Sambini

My boys (who don't care for salad) love this!  If you scale the size to 10 servings it will fit in a Good Seasons cruet perfectly.

I have spent years trying to duplicate the Greek dressing from the old pizza shop I worked at in college.  This is AMAZING, and tasted exactly like it!  I scaled mine down to 10 servings, and will be making more often.

A terrific dressing. It's a big hit when I take it into work for our lunch club. The only change I made was to reverse the proportions of the oil and vinegar, to make it a little less sharp.

Made a very small amount just to test out before making a huge patch.   Did add a bit of sugar and didn't have red wine vinegar so used balsamic and rice wine vinegar.  Wow,  this is a wonderful recipe.  Ate a whole yellow pepper with this drssing drizzled on it.  Delicious!

A staple around our house! We have to make more on a weekly basis. Great addition to sooooo many dishes. Have been making it for about a year and misplaced my copy of the recipe so had to get on and reprint it. Thought I should throw in my review since this is the best recipe I've found on allrecipes and by far the most used in our house!

Not only great for a salad dressing, but I marinated some boneless chicken breasts overnight and served with Greek Lemon Potatoes from this site and a greek salad with this dressing.  Incredible!

Amazing salad dressing!!  I used the serving calculator and cut it down to 10 servings and it turned out great.  I did add a pinch of sugar like another reviewer suggested.  It was so good I licked my salad bowl clean!!  This will be my go-to dressing from now on!

I have to go the other way from previous reviewers - I would increase the oil-to-vinegar ratio to perhaps 2:1 next time! But I'm not a low-fat kind of gal, and I love my olive oil. Good flavor, super quick to make. I added some fresh chopped garlic to the mix, and a touch of agave to counteract the tang of the vinegar. A fun recipe to adapt to your tastes.

This was WAY too oily for my taste! Completely ruins any nutritional value you may get out of a delicious, healthy salad by loading it with oil!  I scaled the recipe down to 10 servings and only used 1/4 cup of olive oil.  Believe it or not it was still too much.  Unlike other raters, I don't see a reason for getting rid of the the tanginess from the vinegar since that's where most of the flavor lives, so I added some balsamic vinegar until I got the desired vinegar to oil ratio.  I'm sure more red wine vinegar (I didn't have any more which is why I used balsamic) or even white wine vinegar would do the trick.  I also did not add any salt since the tanginess from the vinegar provided enough flavor and I added feta to my salad which is already salty.  After all the changed, it came out delicious!  I served it over a Greek salad with hearts of Romaine, red onion, cucumbers, tomatoes, green bell pepper, black olives, and fat free feta.

OMG - this is soooo good!  I used equal parts oil/vinegar, omitted the mustard (I don't like it) and didn't have onion powder so I used garlic salt in place of the salt (as well as the called for garlic powder).  I also added a little sugar as well, to cut some of the tart.  We have a local Greek chain in our city and I crave their salad - this is very close to their dressing, so now I don't have to pay $9 every time I want their salad!

Fantastic dressing and BETTER than the dressing at our local Greek restaurants!! Scaled it back to 10 servings and it was perfect. I know other reviews added sugar but that's why I LOVE Greek salads, the tartness of the vinegar. I did do a 1/1 ratio on the vinegar/oil (1/2 cup of each) and it was perfect.  Also, used an immersion blender to mix it together and it formed almost a "creamy" texture and didn't seperate after 24 hours. DEFINITELY going to make again!!

I too scaled this down (to 12).  When I think "Greek", I think "lemon", so used a 50-50 mix of red wine and balsamic vinegars, and added a couple T of lemon juice.  The vinegar flavor was still very strong, so next time will adjust to make a brighter flavor.  I used this for a farro salad recipe (from this site) and it worked very nicely.

A wonderful creamy greek dressing! Not all Dijons or Red Wine Vinegar are created equal so I knew to watch the Dijon as mine is quite spicy and I reversed the ratio of Oil and Vinegar as this would have otherwise been much to tart. The dressing emulifies (thickens) beautifully and smells divine. I used fresh garlic and minced green onions instead of the powdered options. This dressing goes a long way as the flavour is delightfully intense.

My boyfriend couldn't believe what I had created. He was impressed! I follwed another reviewers advice:  Put everything except the oil and the herbs in the blender, and blend. Drizzle in the olive oil until it is all incorporated.add in the herbs, pulse once or twice. Just mix in the herbs, don't chop them

OMG! Best. Salad. Dressing. Ever!!! I scaled this down to 10 servings and used it for the Party-Size Greek Couscous Salad recipe on this site. Incredible! The only changes I made were to do equal parts oil and vinegar and used half red wine vinegar, half white balsamic vinegar, just because I find red wine vinegar somewhat bitter and overpowering. I may be eating a lot more salads in the future!

Holy cow, this is some good stuff!  My boyfriend and I both swear that we will NEVER buy bottled italian/house/greek salad dressing again.  I scaled the recipe down to 20 and it *almost* fit into a 16 oz salad dressing bottle that I had (because of this I had to leave out about 1/3 cup of the vinegar, but it was still good).  Next time I'll scale it to 15 servings so that it will fit.

Poured over canned green,kidney, garbanzo and wax beans. Added onion and green and red peppers, all the ingredients in bean salad. This is WAY better and not so sweet. It goes with everything. Yum.

After reading the reviews of this dressing I decided to give it a shot.  I love Greek food.  I cut the recipe down to servings for 15, and took the suggested equal parts of Olive Oil to Red Wine Vinegar. Very easy and delicious.  My husband felt it was abit too strong on the Vinegar side ( but he has a hard time with Vinegar based foods anyway )   I loved it and look forward to trying it with feta, cucumbers and seasonal tomatoes.  A nice Dressing and change from our usual Blue Cheese standby.

I'm sorry, but I really didn't care for this recipe at all. The taste of the vinegar was way too strong for me. I had such high hopes for this recipe, with all the good reviews. The other flavors in this dressing were good, but the vinegar taste is overwhelming. I'm glad I cut it down to 12 servings, because I don't know who is going to eat it. Sorry, but I don't think I will be making this again.

Thank you Danielle for a delicious recipe.  The only thing I did was to substitute some of the red wine vinegar with Balsamic vinegar as suggested by another reviewer, simply because I happen to love balsamic and thought it would make an excellent addition. It did. I will be using this dressing religiously. Thanks again for sharing.

All i can say is Thank you! My two younger brothers, who wouldnt eat salad if their lives depended on it, now eat it twice a day...happily!! As far as myself, i love greek food and i eat it all of the time, and this is by far the best dressing ive ever tried and its so easy!! only think i did differently was add some feta cheese

So simple to make. I scaled it down to 12 servings because I didn't think I would need very much, that was two weeks ago and I'm about to have to make another batch. I'm not even a huge fan of salads and I'm a picky eater, but this was really good! I made a huge greek salad with this dressing for a dinner party and everyone raved about how good it was!

This is a very good recipe - no need to buy a bottle of dressing from the store with who knows what it in anymore! My only suggestion would be to specify using a light olive oil. The first time I made this, I used extra virgin, which was a little too bitter with the herbs in there. Light tasting is just the ticket, though!

I love this, made a quart of it...much more economical than buying dressing...It is great, I used half balsamic & half Red Wine vinegar and loved the flavor...I might try the anchovy paste next time as someone recommended.

This probably rates 4.5 stars.  I made this dressing yesterday, adjusting it to serve 12.  Today I ate a salad with it  and it was good, but may get better the longer it sits.  There's just a little something missing and I can't quite put my finger on it.  I think I will just adjust my ingredients a little more to my liking and add some red pepper flakes.  But overall it's so much better than ANY bottled dressing out there. UPDATE: I made this again over the weekend and finally made it to my liking. I decreased the red wine vinegar by 1/3 cup and included 1/3 cup Balsamic vinegar.  I also accidently added more black pepper than the recipe called for, but hey, it worked for me.  I ate this on a veggie sandwich yesterday and could've eaten it straight out of the bottle.

I was pretty scared about making this because of the quantity, but I followed the recipe to the T.  OH! I am so glad I did.  Everyone in my family, and people who came over recently for a dinner party raved about this dressing.  
No more store bought! I'm sold! Don't let the quantity discourage you.  I could drink this stuff!

This is the best! After a couple of trial runs I realized it would please my family more if I used equal amounts of olive oil and red wine vinegar. I had tried sugar to off set the bite of the vinegar but then I adjusted the vinegar and kept everthing else the same. In my opinion it is much better than what is being served at the restaurant. Besides being delicious it can be made in just minutes and I never plan to be without again.

Very good. I used this on a Greek salad. I added a little Feta to this and blended it in the blender, slowing adding the olive oil which helps it from seperating.

I made this in my blender and slowly added the oil at the end. Amazing!! I've made it before and just added the oil and mixed, it wasn't the same! The trick is to make it in the blender and add the oil slowly at the end. Before you serve let some feta sit in the dressing too, just delicious.

Thank goodness this site has a converter on it!  I downsized the amount for 12 people and got delicious results!  I even had a couple of folks ask for the recipe!  (My ego loves being able to say "I made it!")

My entire family is Greek, so I know a good Greek dressing when I taste it...and this one is GOOOOOOOD! Like a few other posts, I have tweaked it a little bit.  I used 1/2 Red Wine vinegar and 1/2 Apple Cider vinegar...I thought it gave it the right amount of zip.
I also chopped up some feta cheese and kalamata olives and mixed those in. I would also suggest using Greek oregano (yes, there is a difference). It adds a whole different level of flavor than regular oregano.

I love greek dressing was anxious to try this recipe.  Very disappointed.  To sour, need more oil, less vinegar or sugar added to it.  I will not make again.  I like sour things but this was to sour for me.  I scaled the recipe down do not know if this affected it.  Disppointed after all the great reviews to try this and not like it.  I have enjoyed your website for a couple of years.  Use your recipes constantly and recommend your site.  This is one of the few I have not liked after trying it.

I've made this dressing several times now and it is definitely the BEST EVER!  I use 1/2 the salt (I promise you won't miss it) and add some crushed red pepper for a little extra kick.  This is definitely a keeper!  Great not only on salads, but also a delicious marinade for chicken.  YUM!!

It's hard to find an easy salad dressing with attainable ingredients that does not call for sugar.  This one calls for sugar, but it fits the bill anyway because Equal worked perfectly well as a substitute!  I use it for more than just salads, too.  I like dipping bread in it.  Also, it saved dinner one night when I drizzled it on some roasted chicken that was a bit dry.  Great stuff!

We loved this dressing for our Greek salad. Scaled to a quantity of 5, it is just right for one bag of Fresh Express salad greens (Triple Hearts or Hearts of Romaine). Add tomato wedges, cucumber slices, red onion rings, Kalamata olives and 3-4 oz crumbled feta. Perfect! You can substitute 1 small clove garlic, minced, for the garlic powder.

Excellent recipe! I scaled it down for 5 servings and used it on pasta.  I didn't add any sugar and thought it was still good.  A little bit vinegary but I like that.  I will be making this again and following the suggestion of someone else who bottled it and gave it as gifts.  This is so good you just have to share!

This is very yummy, with changes from other reviewers! I used half red wine vinegar and half balsamic vinegar. I made the recipe scaled the way it is written, and filled 12 decorative vinegar bottles for Christmas presents, plus had enough left for two cruets of my own! Thanks for the recipe :-)

Totally agree to cut the vinegar a bit, but otherwise this is a SIX star greek dressing when you use fresh ingredients--especially fresh garlic and basil.

This dressing is wonderful!  I made it for a family get-together and had to print off the recipe for my family.  I changed the serving size to 30 and mixed it up in a quart-sized mason jar.  I added a couple Tbs. sugar, also, for a sweet-n-sour twist.  I highly recommend this recipe-- it's a winner!

I've worked in a greek restaurant before (it is where I met my husband!) and although this resembles what I consider to be greek dressing, I thought there were too many conflicting herbs.  I'll keep looking thank you.....

This dressing is terrific. I would use 1/2cup red wine vinegar the next time though. I thought it was a little too tart. But it is definetly better than anything store-bought.

I tried this dressing on a greek pasta salad recipe I found on this site as well and it came out wonderful!!  I had been trying all sorts of ready-made Italian salad dressings for my pasta salads, but this one wins hands down.  It is super easy to make and tastes great.

I have yet to find a ready-made salad dressing that I like so I am constantly trying to make my own.  This recipe is a keeper!  I only had to alter the recipe a tad because I found that the red wine vinegar was a little overpowering for my taste but that is super easy to fix...just whisked in more olive oil until I found the right balance.  I can't wait to try it with greek pasta salad!

Very Good... not to strong. I like a lighter dressing, but the flavor is excellent.

Just a little bit too vinegary, so I added a little sugar (1 tsp for 10 servings proportion), and it brought better balance to the dressing.  Otherwise perfect, so thanks!

Tasted like greek...but too acidic for me, also, I even used same ratio oil and vinegar and added 2 tsp sugar!  I will be making this again but plan on using balsalmic vinegar next time.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I love this salad dressing and have made it many times because it is so good. You will love this if you like vinegar as much as I do. Sometimes I even add balsamic vinegar if I want to make it even more intense. I like to toss the salad with just a little and reserve the rest for guests/family so they can use as much as they want. I recommend using garlic salt.

With all the dried herbs and onion/garlic powders, this dressing tastes very much like "Good Seasons" powedered salad dressing.  It improved upon sitting, but still was nowhere near "The Best Salad Dressing Ever" and had very little of what I think of as "Greek" flavor to it.  It was acceptable as a quick dressing for a change of pace on a weeknight, but I would not serve it to company or anyone I wanted to impress with my cooking skill.

tasty, but very acidic.  Using a more mild viniger than the one suggested helps substantially.

I cut the vinegar in half when I make this.  I also subsitute some of the red wine vinegar with balsamic vinegar.  It is delicious and for the past 3 months my family has been on a Greek Salad kick!

Recipe as is (scaled to 15 servings) makes a great marinade for shish kabobs (steak or chicken)--I marinate these and veggies (green peppers, sweet onions and mushrooms) on the skewers for at least 4 hours up to 10 hours. 
For green salads, scaled to 15 servings, I used 3/4 cup red wine vinegar + 1/4 water instead of 1 cup r.w. vinegar, and added 1/4 to 1/2 tsp sugar--all to cut back on the tartness. Best made a day ahead for green salad. Very good recipe; my hubby and kids love it.

I used this during the Holidays and got nothing but rave reviews about it.  I would highly recommend this dressing, and that's coming from a Greek!  
I transferred the dressing into an empty oil bottle when done and it was so easy to just shake and pour.

Very good dressing, much better than the bottled greek dressings.  The only thing I intend to change is to cut back on the black pepper...perhaps 1/2 tsp. of white pepper instead (I scaled down to 10 servings).  Also, it was better the next day because the dried herbs had softened.  Vey easy to make and I plan on keeping this on hand.  Thanks!

This dressing recipe was not that great for me. I scaled it down to make 12 servings.I followed the recipe to a T. It lacked a certain flavor.I am not sure what would have made it better.The olive oil was a bit overpowering.Maybe Conola oil would have made a smoother taste. I will continue to look for the ultimate dressing.

Not bad for a change, but the pepper and oregano kind of overwhelm the flavor of the oil and vinegar, not to mention the salad greens.  This would indeed be good on a Greek salad, but not for an everyday dressing.

This recipe is fantastic! There used to be a place we would go to all the time to get greek salads because their dressing was so good and this dressing tastes just like that! I just made it for a party and people are already asking me for this recipe! It might be great on a sandwich too!

I scaled the recipe to 10 servings. It calls for 1/2 cup oil and 2/3 cup vinegar. Too tart so I had to flip flop the amounts of oil and vinegar (2/3 cup oil, 1/2 cup vinegar). I also added a tsp of sugar and a chopped shallot. As written, I give it 4 stars.

I love this dressing!  I clicked on "change servings" and dropped it from the recipes original 120 servings to 4 servings.  That was enough dressing to last a few salads for me.  I kept it in an airtight container on the counter for the week.  Don't refrigerate it, the oil will harden.  I am going to buy a better quality red wine vinegar for the next time I make it (I used generic and I could tell it would be better with a good brand).  I plan to make this my go-to dressing for salads.  Thanks for sharing!

I will try this again with some adjustments but the way it's written was way to tangy for us. The only flavour was the red wine vinegar. It's hard to imagine this could be labeled Greek.

This recipe as is calls for too much vinegar. If you cut the vinegar down to about half, it is a perfect 5 star, easy and fabulous dressing.

I prefer to make my own dressings rather than buy the artificial-tasting ones from the grocery stores. And why not? They're so simple to make. This delicious dressing recipe is light with just the right amount of tartness and flavor. I use this on a simple salad I prepare with the rich French Leek Pie recipe at AR. Thanks for this great recipe!

I felt like the vinegar was very overpowering.  If you like vinegar this might be a great recipe for you, but for people who like dressings more on the mild side I would add more oil and less vinegar.

I made it with equal parts oil and vinegar...and used 1 clove of fresh garlic instead of powder.  YUM!  I think I will leave out oregano next time as I can take it or leave it...but overall I will be using this as my own 'house' dressing! :o)

I did not care for this recipe. It was sour, bitter and salty. I'm actually angry- I wasted my precious Nablus EVOO (I brought it  400 miles from Jersey City- where am I going to find Palestinian EVOO in Pittsburgh??) on this. But I followed the directions.  I tried rescuing it by using my immersion blender and  pouring (my average) EVOO slowly into it. I'm kicking this out of my recipe box.

it's a vinaigrette with herbs in it.  Normally one puts 2/3 vinegar to 1 of oil and not the opposite as in this recipe.  I used cider vinegar, because it was all I had.  I followed the recipe exactly but found it so sharp that I had to put in a good bit more oil.

I made this recipe exactly except I used the blender and I scaled it down to 20 servings to fit into a jar for the fridge. It has way too much black pepper. I recommend only a fourth called for. I also had to add sugar to cut the tartness. It came out a little runnier than expected and mixed with the salad very easily hence a little goes a long way.

I made this to drizzle on the "cucumber sandwich" recipe from this site. EXCELLENT dressing. During dinner, my son said, "Mom, next time we have a salad, we need to use THIS dressing!!!" Yum.

good template recipe to make your own.  I trimed it down to make 24 oz.  About equal parts oil and vinegar (half and half of red wine and balasmic) and about a TBspoon of sugar and water.  Blended it and placed it on my go-to-list: 'dressing for salads and chicken' :)

I scaled this recipe down to 10 servings.  It is perfect.  I only used 1/2 c. vinegar (used cider b/c I didn't have any red wine).  It is a delicious recipe.  Would also be great as a marinade for chicken - or even a sirloin.

My son, a chef,  says this recipe is great but need to add. GRANULATED SUGAR TOO.  KEEP IN REFRIGERATOR.
And the sat used  should be KOSHER SALT - SO MUCH BETTER TASTING THAN IODIZED TABLE SALT.
This dressing is famous state wide.
My FAMILY LOVES THIS!!!

Very, very  tart but that is how I like my vinigrette.  I didn't have the wine vinegar so I used half balsamic and have apple cider.  I did the earliest scaled back version from the reviews and it worked perfectly.   What a great and easy recipe!  I will keep the leftover dressing in the fridge and most definately not ont the counter though.   I've just had a bout of food poisoning from a salad in a restaurant and I'm not taking any chances!

41/2 star recipe as written. Since that is not an option, I chose 5 instead of 4. When I make it, I do scale it back to 12 servings. For that amount, I do increase the oil to 3/4 cup, and add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. This is great over cut up cucumbers, red onions, tomatoes and kalamata olives. Stir in some feta cheese and you have a quick salad that doesn't last long at a potluck. Thank you for sharing, Danielle.

I can't believe this dressing has such a high rating. It is soooooo tart. It's strange to see a salad dressing resipe where the amount of vinegar exceeds the amount of oil. I've just made it for the 2nd time thinking maybe I did something wrong the first time but NOPE. It's too tart even though I have now almost doubled the amount of oil and added a bit of water as well.

This is classic house dressing with a very 'bright' and tangy flavor. The herb mix is perfect and the touch of dijon gives it a bit of bite. I took the hint from the two most popular reviews, both scaling the recipe down and emulsifying it. My only recommendation would be to use a good quality extra virgin olive oil, and make sure it's one whose flavor you know you like.

Best I have ever tasted! I'm very picky with greek dressing as I find that most are overwhelmed by the the oregano & basil. This dressing had the perfect balance between the herbs and the oil/vinegar. I will use this dressing from now on. Very easy to make as well.

I followed the suggestion to emulsify the dressing in my blender, and the texture was great!  I'd never done that before but definitely will with other oil vinegar dressings.  The flavor of the dressing was good, but holy moly, it was like being punched in the face with vinegar.  We love vinegar and I regularly serve cucumber salad made with just sliced cucumbers floating around in balsamic vinegar (with a pinch of sugar and salt), so I'm not sure what the problem was.  My husband had tears rolling down his cheeks!  In 6 months or so (once we have time to use this batch up a teeny bit at a time, I scaled it down to make 2 1/2 C using 1 1/3 C red wine vinegar and 1 C oil), I will try again but swap the amounts of oil and vinegar because I think this has potential to be amazing dressing.

Perfect!  I was very short on time and had kids tugging at my legs wanting dinner so I followed a review by AngKN so I didn't have to scale the recipe down myself.  Here's her review:
"I love this dressing! Here are the scaled down measurements that will fit into one of those glass, good seasons dressing bottles: 3/4 cup oil 1 cup vinegar 2 tsp garlic powder 2 tsp oregano 2 tsp basil 1.5 tsp pepper 1.5 tsp salt 1.5 tsp onion powder 1.5 tsp mustard Enoy!"
I used dry mustard powder instead of dijon.  Used 1/2 basalmic and half red wine vinegar.  Blended in blender while slowly adding oil.  Used with the Roasted Portobello Red Pepper and Arugula Salad For One recipe from this site. Delicious together!

I always buy the Chicken Greek salad w the house dressing on the side from the fast food greek restaurant in greektown, Chicago. I always ask for extra house dressing because i love the stuff and its void of all the high calorie fillers u get with the store bought brands. Its great. I found this recipe and its almost, close to identical. Love it! I would have gve it 5 stars but i suggest cutting back 1/2 teap. on the Red wine vinegar. It makes it just a little too vinegary for me. Thanks for a great recipe

From the other reviews I was expecting a WOW dressing.  It must be my fault but I don't know what went wrong.  I scaled the dressing to 10 servings.  I used 1/2 cup EVOO and 1/2 cup vinegar since most said the vinegar was overpowering.  Others said for the vinegar use 3 oz. red wine and 1 oz. balsamic.  It was just ok.  Not much taste.  Maybe my onion powder was too old.  I use the other spices all the time but O.P....not so much.  Same with my balsamic but there was so little of that in the dressing it shouldn't have mattered.  Maybe it will be better after sitting overnight.  I'm not giving up on it.  I'd like to have the same results as the other reviewers.  I whisked the ingredients together with oil last as suggested.  Next time I'll try my immersion blender.

This is a winner!!!  Scaled it down to 10 servings and shook all the ingredients at one time in a mason jar...easy!  The oil/vinegar ratio is perfect as it is...I wouldn't change a thing!

5 star all the way. I made this for my family and they couldn't believe that I 'whipped this up'. Lol. I also scaled it down to make 6 servings and it came out great. Thank you.

I really, REALLY, really liked this dressing just the way it is written (scaled down to approx 16 oz.).  It was very flavorful and had a bite that I thought was perfect.  I LOVE oil/vinegar dressings.  (My husband thought it was good, but he wouldn't give it a rave review because he prefers creamy dressings.)  This will definitely be a regular standby for me!

Love this dressing - it was simple to make and amazing!  I used it as a dressing and a marinade for chicken, the chicken tasted awesome and it only sat in the dressing for a few minutes.  This will be my go to whenever I'm craving Greek, yummy!!

Very good! I did make some modifications. First, I changed the serving size from 120 to 10 servings; the amounts I give in my modifications reflect this change. I followed the suggestions in the reviews about using equal parts of olive oil and red wine vinegar, however I also added about 2 TB of balsamic vinegar, for some tang. I would also recommend using 1 tsp oregano instead of 1 1/4 tsp. I was out of basil, so I omitted it. I also added about 1/2 tsp sugar. I served this with a Greek salad of romaine and spring lettuces, cucumber, kalamata olives, pepperoncini peppers, a sprinkle of mozzarella cheese, and croutons. You could even add baked chicken and make it a meal. This is a keeper!

very yummy. I get raving reviews when I use this dressing in my Greek salads. You won't be disappointed. A great dressing to keep in the refrigerator for quick meals.  Also, I love the servings calculatoron this website, to take the work out of adjusting the quantity.

Delicious!  I didn't have dijon so I added a few tablespoons of lemon juice and this turned out awesome!  I'm going to try marinating chicken for kabobs in the remaining dressing.

I used a chianti wine vinegar and the dressing was very bitter & stong with the vinegar flavor.  I tried to add some sugar for balance, but it didn't seem to help very much.  I was disappointed.

Excellent.  Careful with the amount you add, a little goes a long way!  1st time, I used too much and the dressing was very over-powering.  Much better when I used less.

Nice dressing with easy ingredients.  I utilized the very nifty servings calculator to reduce for 10 people.  I'm now wishing I had made double the batch.  

I wanted to try the recipe "as is" without modifications first.  I'm thinking of adding some fresh lemon juice and fresh parsley (both very greek and common ingredients) to freshen it up.  Both of which would require refrigeration so keep that in mind.  

Yummy - sending it to my daughter & mom next.

This stuff is amazing! The longer it sits, the better it is. I made the dressing one week ago and last night, I added it to a veggie pasta salad...it was amazing! Make it (at least) a few hours before serving...it makes a world of difference.

Everyone loves this dressing.  It reminds my bf of the Olive Garden dressing.  I served it with greek salad twice now and will use it for pasta next time.  Using the calculator provided, I modified the serving to 15 and the amount fits perfectly in my cruet.

Yum!  This is the perfect Greek salad.  I scaled it down to eight servings but eyeballed everything.  I did not have onion powder and I omitted the mustard and added parsley flakes.  I also added feta cheese to the dressing.  It was sooo good in a salad topped with tomatoes, cucumbers, kalamata olves and more feta.  Thanks!

OMG I never thought in a million years that I would be able to make my own salad dressing much less a Perfect Greek salad dressing. I was curious of this recipe since my Mom and I drive quite a distance to go to a restaurant on the other side of Atlanta just to get their Greek Salad. When I finished making this I let my Mom try it on a Greek Salad I made, knowing she would be my worst critic. One taste she said, "Wow, no need of going all the way to the other side of town anymore, YOU DID IT". Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This is fantastic, but you need to scale down big time, and even then... add the herbs slowly.  I found when I scaled down and dumped it all in at once, it had way too much salt and bite to it.. when I thinned it out, it was amazing!

This is absolutely fantastic dressing.  Not only have I made 4 batches for myself over the past year, I've also made several for family and friends who all rave about it.  The only thing I do differently is that I use 1/2 balsamic and 1/2 red wine vinegar for extra flavour.

This is an awesome recipe.  I use the dressing to marinate veggies before grilling too.  And trust the author of the recipe...it does not need to be refrigerated, if you do it is takes a half hour to thaw the oil so you can use it.

This is a great vinaigrette.  I used it on the "Mediterranean Greek Salad" from Allrecipes.  See my comments for a few salad changes.  For this recipe I used a slice of red onion in place of the onion powder because I had it left over from the salad.  I also added one tablespoon of sugar and a half cup of parmesan cheese.  I didn't have red wine vinegar so used white wine vinegar.  I mixed all ingredients in my blender. Excellent dressing for the greek salad. (I also re-calculated for 10 servings)

Really simple and good.  I added a pinch of both rosemary and oregano and used half white balsamic and half red wine vinager.  I also added a pinch of sugar since the husband doesn't care for tart flavors as much as I do.  Also scaled it for 10 servings since I don't have counter space for a gallon of dressing.

WOW!  I easily adjusted to make for 10 servings thanks to the web site's customization feature.  This is absolutely delicious!  I will be serving this dressing on a greek salad and serve with homemade pastitsio and a nice crusty bread this evening.

This was WONDERFUL and so easy!  I cut it down to 20 servings.  I think I've found my new addiction!  Oh, one change:  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used white wine vinegar.  I did try them before making & decided they did taste similar enough that it should be fine.  This one's a keeper, thanks for posting!

I am not a Greek salad fan so my rating is based on my daughter's opinion. She told me that this dressing rivaled and in her opinion perhaps even exceeded the very best Greek salad she has ever eaten, and that was in Athens Greece, where she first fell in love with Greek salads, high praise indeed!

Because I was only making this for a small bridal shower, I cut the serving size down to 12. Doing so, I can tell you this is a very delicious salad dressing. The only thing I did wrong, was to not havew enough greens in my salad-made it a little too soggy, but that was totally my fault. Good dressing that is easy to pull together.

This tastes exactly like the dressing I get when I order my favorite greek salad! Perfect! I scaled the recipe down to 20 and it made enough for an average sized salad dressing bottle. I marinated my chicken in this and made my greek salad with a mix of romaine and iceburg lettuce, chick peas, feta, cucumber, tomato and olives, drizzled some of this dressing over it and I can't tell the difference between my salad and my favorite restaurant salad!  As an afterword- dried spices do not stay good forever, so if you have had your spices to long and your dressing tastes funny you might want to think about cleaning out the spice cabinet and freshening up those spices.  =)

OMG!This is terrific!I'll never buy dressing again. However, if it does seem too tart just add more oil. Thank u so much for the recipe.

MARINATE CHICKEN: This is the first time that I have reviewed a recipe but I had to sign up just to review this one. I made the BIG batch of this dressing and I did not know what I was going to do the the leftovers so I marinated some chicken in the leftovers. It was wonderful!!

This dressing suited my tastes but I can definitely see how others would find it too tart. This was decent..nothing spectacular. I was disappointed after all the rave reviews.

This was absolutely fantastic! I scaled down the recipe so it would be enough for just one large bowl of salad, but next time I will make more to have on hand!

After scaling this back to 6 servings and adding 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese, we have found our new favorite greek salad dressing.  I would recommend letting the dressing sit for a bit before using, as it gets better if the ingredients are allowed to saturate.  I've also used it with chopped cooked chicken and romaine lettuce in a wrap, and it was delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

We have salads every night, and this dressing will be part of our regular rotation (we like a variety).  The flavor is as pure as dried herbs will allow--much better than anything else store bought.  One part of the directions caught me by surprise--the part where you add the vinegar last.  I'm used to whisking the oil in slowly to emulsify the mustard.

Yum!  I didn't have onion powder, so I didn't add it.  I added a bit of sugar because a local greek restaurant uses it in their dressing, and it was amazing!  (I changed to recipe to 4 servings, which required 1/2 tsp of all of the spices, and I added 1/2 tsp of sugar)

Absolutely fabulous!  Just as the name suggests.  Scaled it back to 10 servings and it fit perfectly in the salad dressing cruet you can purchase at the store.  Served with the "Good for you Greek Salad" from this site.  It's a keeper!

Sorry, but I did not care for this recipe. It wasn't flavorul and was way too sour! Did not taste like Greek dressing. I'd had better dressing with just extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar and S&P.

I make this dressing all the time and it really is fabulous.  It goes great with Ali's tortellini greek salad on this site.  I add slightly less vinegar, maybe 1/2 a cup, about equal to the olive oil.  Also for personal preference I keep it in the fridge, because I think it would keep longer and tastes better cold.

Awesome dressing. The only thing I changed  was I swapped the amounts of olive oil and vinegar - my taste preference. Is great on salad and also good on grilled zucchini.

Absolutely wonderful!  I used dried, fresh oregano from my garden, followed the recipe exactly as scaled for 6 servings and will never purchase another "store bought" salad dressing again!!!! Just had 11 house guests and they loved it too.

Scaled to 9 servings, which filled 1/2 of my cruet. My daughter and I loved it!! We even tried mixing this into cream cheese (with less oil) for a cracker/sandwich spread. We did this at lunch and made a super Greek salad pita!

YUM!  I was pleasantly surprised by this dressing.  I made a simple salad of baby mixed greens, black olives, tomato, and cucumber and wanted a complimentary dressing, and this was fabulous!  I scaled the vinegar back a little, per hubby's request, but other than that, stuck to the recipe, and it was perfect - very flavorful and light.  I will be making it again, for sure!

This recipe is GREAT!  Made it for dinner guests and they commented that it reminded them of Olive Garden's salad dressing.  I made exactly according to recipe except used onion salt instead of powder becauase that's all I had.  Still was EXCELLENT!!

I scaled the recipe down to 12 servings, and followed it exactly. Thought it might be too vinegary, but it's fine--a little goes a long way (I find that 1 tablespoon of this is enough on a good-sized salad compared to 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette I usually make). Will definitely make this often. Thanks for sharing!

No need for me to order this in the restaurant anymore!  Wonderful!  I found that a little goes a long way so I'm careful not to drench the vegetables. I add to it chopped cucumber, raw zucchini, tomato, onion, Kalamata olives and Feta.  Heaven in a bowl!

I made this dressing with the stuff I had on hand. I had to make a few substitutes white wine vinegar for the red wine vinegar. I also didn't have any Dijon mustard either so I had to use just plain old yellow mustard. I crumbled in some feta cheese and blended all the rest of the ingredients in a food processor. I scaled it down to 4 servings it turned out fabulous! I used some mixed baby lettuce and spinach, grape tomatoes, prosciutto, Greek olives and topped it off with croutons! It turned out to be the salad, I now crave. The dressing had a wonderful flavor. I wouldn't go too long without a breath mint or brushing my teeth after having some.

Fantastic!!!! I am not a big fan of vinegar but I LOVE this dressing!!!!!! I didn't have any onion powder on hand so I added a little more garlic powder (I used the modified to 6 servings recipe). I will be using this as a salad staple at many dinners to come!

Another 5 star rating for an AMAZING dressing!!! I use this as my chicken breast marinade all the time and people RAVE about it. I then use the chicken the next day in a greek salad with this dressing. I cannot say enough good things about it. Thank you to the OP a million times over for posting it!

Love this dressing!!  I scaled it to 4 servings...made it in a "Good Seasons" cruet and just shook it all up.  I didn't have dijon mustard so I used what I had which was French's bold & spicy.  Still turned out wonderful!!

We loved it.  Had all the ingredients on hand.  We go to Greek Town in Chicago and have been trying to find a good greek salad dressing.  This did it.  The only addition I had was mixing fresh dill with the greens.  Definitely a keeper.

This is a fantastic dressing, my husband even commented on how good it smelled as I was making it.  I did add 1/4 c. sugar to balance out the acidy from the vinegar.  Excellent recipe!!!

I used this on Party Size Greek Couscous Salad from this site. I scaled it down to five servings and after reading the reviews I decreased the amount of red wine vinegar. I will definitely make this again. Thanks.

I make a lot of salad dressings. This one turned out pretty good, but not as fabulous as I was expecting based on all the rave reviews. I would describe it as a good basic vinegarette, but nothing over-the-top special. It does turn out on the vinegary side...which is fine by me because I like vinegar, but it might be too much for some people.

Have been looking for the right low-carb dressing and this is it.  I didn't have any dijon mustard, but it was fine anyway.    I really liked the tangy cider flavor.  It was incredible on a plain green salad with feta cheese.  Be sure to plan ahead and let the flavors mingle for an hour or so.  Bet it will be even better after mingling overnight.

What a great dressing! It was totally what I was looking for. I scaled it down to four servings and it turned out beautifully. I added a pinch of sugar to cut down on the bitterness of the vinegar. I won't be buying bottled dressing in the future. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This would be a good recipe to make for the holidays. It doesn't have to be refrigerated so you could put it in interesting bottles and give it to your family and friends as gifts. My Dad, who is the greek salad dressing expert, really liked it but said the local restaurant he gets his greek salad dressing from is better. But he said this is a close 2nd.

I thought this dressing was fantastic.  I used it with a greek pasta recipe as well as a salad with grilled chicken and halloumi cheese and both were delicious.  This recipe is a definite keeper.

I like to use a bit less vinegar and a bit more mustard, then I thaw out chicken slices in the dressing in the microwave (a quick marinade) and add it all to a salad with tomatos for a delicious healthy chicken salad.

Very nice recipe.  Definately better than the stuff you can buy at the store.  I didn't find mine was too vinegary, but I did add a little at a time and kept tasting.  But I found I used it all anyway.  Also added a little extra salt.
Really good!

Used this for our Independence Day gathering on the Greek Pasta Salad recipe from this site (took advice from other reviewer to do so). I increased the Dijon, basil and oregano as well as the garlic in the recipe to taste. It was terrific! The dressing is great and will be nice on any number of dishes.

Very similar to one we make at our restaurant, but i'l have to try the dijon mustard in it! Great on fries as well. (with fish n chips) I'm considering adding some plain yogurt as well for use on our greek salad. Try it and lemme know what you think!

This dressing is really good but gets better as it sits and the flavors have a chance to meld. I have also used this as a marinade for chicken, yum. Defrosted some fully-cooked shrimp in dressing and then drained(water from the shrimp) mixed with rice and some diced fresh onion, tomato, cucumber and zucchini added dressing to taste and had a GREAT shrimp salad for supper.

Easy to make, easy to store, tastes great!  I reduce the recipe to 8 and it all fits into one of those small Vigo Olive oil bottles (emptied).  Then it's on hand and easy to shake up for use.  Referring to several of the reviews in Oct-Nov 2003, I used a little less vinegar than it called for (using only a little more vinegar-to-oil ratio instead of the recipe ratio) because my girlfriend doesn't care that much for vinegar taste. She loved it.  One time I substituted a little balsamic vinegar into the red-wine vinegar.  Both times great.  Feta cheese on the Salad does balance things out, dinner guests love it.  Plus, it's awesome mixed into Mujadara when it turns out bland to make it taste more Cuban instead of Middle Eastern.  Thank you, Danielle!!

I halved this recipes and it worked great- added a little more sugar for added sweetness- was a tad bit sour for my taste. Overall- great dressing!

This recipe sounds great.  My mother's barely eating nowadays, but has always loved potato soup.  I'm hoping that she'll substitute this easy recipe for the nights she only wants oatmeal.  Thanks.

My husband & I both thought the vinegar over powered the dressing.  Too tart!  I think the oil to vinegar ratios may be off. May play with it a little and make again...not sure.

This was by far the BEST salad dressing I have ever tasted. I found the vinegar flavour a bit too much, so I added a tsp of water and that adjusted it to my liking.

Delicious.  I needed a quick dressing for a pasta salad I was making for a Greek party tonight.  This was perfect.  I scaled it down to 10 servings.  Thank you so much.  I will be making this again.

I hate to be the only "nay" vote here, but I was disappointed with this recipe.  The flavor that stood out the most was "bitter".  Not a favorite.

I haven't bought salad dressing for 20 years, and am always searching for a good one. THIS IS IT!  I scaled it down to 10 servings for family use.  It's fabulous as a pasta salad dressing as well as for green salad.  When my guests have four choices, they always choose this one.  WOW this is a real keeper!

Betcha can't make this just once! Very zesty! A general tip: I put this in the smallest baby food jars and it is the perfect amount for two side salads or one big lunch salad. This would also make a yummy marniade!

As a low-carb dieter I really appreciate this dressing's lack of sugar, and it is so easy to make and tastes fantastic.  I usually make it with safflower oil and often I use balsmamic vinegar for a milder taste (but will sometimes use red wine vinegar for more zing).  This has become the house dressing in our home!

Fantastic dressing! I was worried by the look on my families face on Easter when I told them we were trying a new dressing on the "famous Greek salad" I'm asked to bring each time I visit (Mixed greens, tomato, avocado, feta and cucumber) Huge hit!! It's so light and tasty! Perfect for a nice summer salad (or fall, winter, spring) I followed the scaled down version and added 2 tablespoons of sugar to balance out the vinegar.

This is our absolute favorite dressing!!! I’ve made this with almost every type of vinegar possible and it’s delicious every time. My favorite blend is equal parts red wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar and sherry vinegar.

absolutely the best - and easiest - salad dressing recipe I have ever tried.   I am always looking for 'clean' ways of preparing my meals thus avoiding all store bought mixtures.   This recipe has become a standard in my home.
thank you for sharing it with me.

I really liked this dressing with all the herbs and spices, very tasty! However I agree with a few other people that it was a little vinegar-y for me. It's fine if you like it that way but I used equal parts oil + vinegar and still thought it could use less. Again it was still very good though and I love that I have a jar of it sitting around for whenever I need it!

This is an exceptional dressing with some changes.  It takes more oil than the recipe calls for otherwise the vinegariness is overwhelming.  Also, I added some sugar (about a tablespoon for 10 servings).  I also added more oregano and some Greek  seasoning.  Make it the day before if you can and let refrigerate overnight.

This was a very good dressing. I scaled it down to 12 servings. Added some lemon juice and didn't have any mustard so I made my own with dried mustard. Turned out awesome! This is now my go to homemade dressing. I used it on a Greek pasta salad.

This is a wonderful dressing, much more flavorful and healthier than store bought dressings because you make it and don't add any of the other stuff you can't pronounce that they put in those dressings.  I have been using the Bragg Organic Healthy Vinagrette dressing because it's organic & all natural and doesn't have preservatives, but it's very pricy & this one is just as good at a fraction of the cost, especially if you have all ingredients on hand which I did.  I did use equal parts of the oil & vinegar because I don't like it too tart, and it was just right. Glad I tried this one, won't be buying any more dressings at the grocery store from now on.

Perfectly delicious. Have been using it since the discontinuation of my beloved Good Seasonings Cheese Garlic. Definitely recommend using equal parts oil to vinegar. I scale down to 15 servings and use 3/4 c oil and vinegar each.

Oh, yum! We loved this dressing!  I followed the 2011 quantities from AngieKN, and they were perfect.  I didn't have basil, and wanted to kick myself, but I added a few dashes of Italian seasoning. My salad plates consisted of torn Romaine sprinkled with feta and chopped avocado, and on the side, 3-4 canned rice stuffed grape leaves and a helping of store made Tabouleh.  If I had Roma tomatoes, I would add some of those sliced, as well. The salad just burst with flavor! Homemade stuffed grape leaves would be divine.  Be sure to use the feta that comes in a block.  The packaged crumbles just aren't the same.  Thank you, Danielle M!

I love this! I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I did a substitution like another person suggested. 1/2 white wine vinegar and 1/2 apple cider vinegar, and regular mustard. I'm sure that the original ingredients must be even better, but with what I had at hand came out great! Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

A good, simple dressing. I did cut back on the vinegar a wee bit. It was lovely but didn't blow me away.

This is amazing. If you want to eat more salad, this is the dressing you need. I just marinated cucumbers in it for veggie sandwiches and had to hide the cucumbers so that I'd have enough for the sandwiches. We were all standing in the kitchen eating them out of the bowl!

Thanks to the reviewer who stated she ate salad for breakfast because that is the review that made me try this recipe and to AngKN for the scaled down ingredients that fit in a cruet. I pulsed it a few times in my magic bullet to mix and it's perfect-totally mixed but still pretty.

I knocked this down to 10 servings. I thought I had red wine vinegar, but it turns out I just had red cooking wine, so I used half that and the other half rice vinegar to get the vinegar portion. Still turned out really tasty on my homemade Greek salad today!

I would have given it 5 stars but thought it was just a tad tart from vinegar. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will do what another reviewer did and use 2 parts wine vinegar and 1 part balsamic vinegar.

This is delicious!! I don't leave feedback often but had to for this one because it is so good! I used it for pasta salad (mixed with cucumber, black olives, cherry tomatoes, and feta cheese) and it was terrific. I will try it with salad next!! Yum!

Best dressing recipe yet !  If you adjust to 15 you get a small canning jar full.  Lasts for weeks in the fridge but you do have to let it warm up a bit because the oil gets thick in the fridge.

I make this dressing about a quart at a time and keep it in a pickle jar.  When my cruet runs dry, I refill.  This dressing gets better with age.  It takes about two months for the flavor to really go through all the changes I like, so the next time I make it I'll make a gallon and refill my pickle jar from the gallon.  I made the recipe my own by adding a little honey to improve the emulsion.  I also make a version with balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  It's very good, and very different.

Lord have mercy the vinegar in this dressing was overwhelming!  I added more olive oil as one reviewer mentioned.  I also tried adding some sugar to try and cut through the acidity…to no avail.

I reduced the recipe to six servings and use fresh crushed garlic and a little scraped onion juice versus the dried garbage.  Like others have said, a bit tart because of the unusual proportioning of oil to vinegar.  So alter them and add more oil!  A little turbinato sugar or honey takes care of that, too. (Honey is also an emulsifier like mustard.) But the thing that made the dressing pop was when I stirred in a crushed anchovy filet (oil packed).  OMG.  Turn your nose at the thought, but it makes a world of difference in flavor---wonderful!  Besides, as far as I'm concerned, a Greek salad without a few of them on top is just wrong.  (Try adding honey [orange, buckwheat, or mesquite, never clover--—yech] to your balsamic based dressings as well and taste what the pros do to imitate aged balsamic vinegar at a fraction of the cost.  You'll never go back.)

Would give 5 stars if I didn't change it a little, First I scale it down to 12 servings and use about 1/2 cup lemon juice instead of vinegar, use it to your taste, we love lemons and put it on everything in our house. I also add a tsp. of sugar. Again add slowly to your taste if your going to try it. Leave out the oregano. Then of course you have to get some good crusty bread to dip in any left over dressing in your bowl!

This dressing truly lives up to it's name! I scaled the recipe down with no problem. We love this dressing on a crispy Romaine salad with halved cherry tomatoes, chopped cucumbers, and plenty of Feta. Together with a chicken breast it makes a wonderful weeknight meal.

Wow! Amazing.  I scaled back to 6 servings but made it as is after reading through all the ratings.  If you use feta cheese in your salad you won't find the vinegary taste overwhelming.  If you aren't then you may want to scale the vinegar back a bit otherwise, it's perfect as is.  It's fantastic and so very authentic..reminds me of the greek salad I used to eat at my favourite greek restaurant oh so long ago.  Thanks for sharing!!

After losing my normal recipe, I turned to this one.  It wasn't good initially.  I had to add more olive oil to offset the vinegar.  Given all the good reviews this recipe has, I guess the olive oil to vinegar ratio isn't off (just my taste is) but normally in these type of dressings, your vinegar should not exceed your oils.

I saw all of the reviews stating how tangy it was...wow, so true! I like things with a little zest, but this actually hurt my throat. I even added some extra EVOO and some sugar to counter the tartness, but it was still too tart for my taste. I definitely should've cut back on the vinegar (&/or the pepper?). I think I will stick to my old stand-by recipe for a dressing and use this as a grilling marinade for chicken.

Many reviews suggested adding a bit of balsamic vinegar. 1st time I made it I followed recipe & we liked it. I did add a wedge of squeezed lemon juice.

Delicious, tangy and easy! Plus I had everything to make it and threw it together in about a minute.  Good right away, but better the next day.  Next time I'll try emulsifying it in the blender.

See reviews to equalize oil and vinegar.
Dressing will separate if made in large quantities.  One review suggested to mix in blender, adding oil slowly to emulsify the dressing.

I recommend trying this recipe with half the amount of vinegar. I love it made that way because I can taste the flavours of the olive oil and seasoning better - yum!

This dressing is great. I use it to make a greek pasta salad, with feta, kalamata olives, red onions, cucumbers, pine nuts, sundried tomatoes. It is always a hit. Thanks for the recipe!

This is it! I make it all the time now. I have used this to marinate chicken in and then use for souvlaki. I have poured this over chopped veggies and beans to make a quick side dish...A thousand times better than the dressings even at some of the local greek restaruants. Yum!

I tried this recipe for a birthday party tonight and it was such a hit I was asked for copies of the recipe. It tastes just like the dressing used by a local restaurant and I love their salad. Now I can make my own as needed - so excited!

I love vinegar based dressings, especially red wine. I did not have basil or onion powder on hand.  I left out the basil and used onion flakes instead of the powder.  This recipe is easy to scale down and easy to make. It is great for a greek pasta salad (feta cheese, tomatoes, olives, cucumbers, pasta, and this dressing) or just a regular lettuce salad. This is my favorite dressing now; I always try to have it on hand.

DELICIOUS! I scaled this down to 6 servings, only using 1/2 tsp. dried oregano and 1/4 tsp. dried basil, and that was perfect for us. I mixed this up in a jar earlier in the day to allow the flavors to belnd, and just shook it every so often. We really enjoyed this and I will def be making it again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

As promised, absolutely fabulous AND a bonus that I had everything in the kitchen! Made it for a kirby cucumber/tomato salad (from my mom's garden) and it was delicious although it needed maybe 15 minutes to marinate.  I can just imagine what that salad could have been with some feta and onions!

This is pretty much exactly what I was looking for . . . I don't like garlic or onion powder so I left those out (there is green onion in my salad anyway). And I had white wine vinegar instead of red. So in the end mine is a little different, but very good all the same.

Excellent dressing.  I used it to dress a Greek Pasta Salad.  I wanted a creamy dressing for the Pasta, so I added sour cream.  I was catering a "green room" for a band and those hungry rock and rollers devoured the salad.  Thanks, Danielle!

This is so good.  I LOVE Greek dressing, and this does the trick.  So glad to have a sugar-free dressing that I love!!  I do think it's a bit too peppery for my taste, so I'll be decreasing that.

Too much dry herbs gave it a gritty texture and still it was surpringly bland. All my herbs were freshly bought jars, so they weren't stale.

This is my second favorite salad dressing of all time.  The other one is my tahini soy sauce dressing, which you can find on crash test vegetarian (dot) com.  This was absolutely brilliant.  A perfect bite.

It really is absolutely fabulous.  I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand, so I ended up using salad vinegar (I don't think they're the same thing...but maybe they are?), but it was still good.  I'll be making this often!

Fantastic as written.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  It was really generous of you.  We have this weekly with cucumbers, tomotoes and kalmata olives.  Sometimes we add shredded or cubed chicken for a full meal.  I recommend seeding the cucumbers and tomatoes so it doesn't water the dressing down.

This was a hit at a get together. I didn't have enough red wine vinegar and had to substitute a little balsamic, also did not add the oregano. Really tasty, especially with goat cheese and radishes!

Fantastic dressing!  I've had it for lunch and/or dinner nearly every day since finding this recipe a couple weeks ago, and my kids like it too.

Oh my goodness, I love this dressing. Even after I finish the salad, I'm sopping up the remaining dressing with crusty bread. Love it, love it.
Thanks Danielle.

This is the best greek dressing I've had. I used the scaled down quantity as recommended by another user.  3/4 cup oil, 1 cup vinegar, 2 tsp garlic powder, 2 tsp oregano, 2 tsp basil, 1.5 tsp pepper, 1.5 tsp salt, 1.5 tsp onion powder,& 1.5 tsp mustard.  Be sure to chill before using.

Absolutely awesome!  Reminds me of the dressing served with muffuletta sandwiches from one of my favorite restaurants in Shreveport, LA.  Have made 2 small batches of this wonderful dressing and am sure will be making more!  Kudos, Danielle M.!

I scaled this down to about 4 servings just to try it out.  Made exactly as directed and let it sit out on the counter top for a few days.  It was quite tangy so I added a packet of equal and that really seemed to balance out the tangy-ness.  This has an amazing flavor.  I can't wait to try it out as a chicken marinade.

This is a fantastic dressing!! I use it time and time again. Sometimes I add fresh dill- if I have it on hand. I always use the same amount of vinegar as oil. eg. 1c oil to 1 c vinegar. That seems to work really well. Thanks for the recipe!!!

So easy to make, so good to eat! I made this dressing for a Greek themed dinner party. There was no salad left. I am sure it was the dressing that everyone liked. Also I reduced the serving size to 25 and there was more than enough for 10 people. Plus I have left over dressing for more salad!

Despite the list of simple ingredients, this salad dressing was delicious!  Both my husband and I loved it, and he told me to save this recipe.  It has an authentic, fresh taste and was great on a salad with tomatoes, feta and cucumber.

Great dressing. It is quite vinegary, which I like, and very strongly flavored, which I also like. You don't need a lot of dressing on your salad when it is strong like this. Much better if left to sit overnight (dry herbs take a while to infuse and soften). Glad to have another dressing in my arsenal!

This recipe is AWESOME! I usually shorten it down to about 10 servings, which will be enough for about 4-6 salads. The recipe calls for salt, but I add about half of what it calls for, as the red wine vinegar is usually pretty strong enough. If you love Greek salads, or ANY salad, you will LOVE this recipe! It's so easy!

This recipe is great. I reduced everything to yield about 10 servings. At first I found the red wine vinegar a bit overpowering but I let it sit and the flavours really melded well mellowing the vinegar flavour. Much better than the bottled stuff!

Holy ! I can't believe I haven't rated this yet! This is my absolute favorite recipe for salad dressing ever. I don't ever need to buy salad dressing at the store ever again! I like that it's easy to decrease the servings without getting really screwy measurements. Thank you (times a million!)

This is the best dressing ever!  I misread the last ingredient thinking it was red wine, not red wine vinegar. Nevertheless, I used balsamic vinegar instead and it was absolutely delicious.  I'll try using it with red wine vinegar next time to compare.  Note: I used 1 cup of olive oil to 1/2 cup vinegar and scaled the rest of the ingredients accordingly (to 20 servings).

Delicious.  Easily scaled down- 6 servings made enough for a big greek salad with some dressing to spare.  I definitely recommend using quality olive oil and vinegar in this one, it makes all the difference in the taste.

This dressing is soooo good. But try a little less vinegar - I'd add it too taste. And mix it in the blender.  Made this exactly as written but cut it way down for a family of 4. After tasting it as is. I did think it might have too much vinegar.  But once it is on fresh tomatoes or cucumbers - mmmm love it... I love vinegar.  Or leave out a few tablespoons of vinegar and use the vinegar from a jar of pepperoncini or banana peppers or even jalapeno juice to really give it a kick.  My fav greek salad includes:  combo of green leaf lettuce and romaine, red onion sliced paper thin, cucumber. tomato, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, feta cheese, pepperoncinis, salt & pepper croutons, and now this perfect dressing.

Pretty good, but not as outstanding as many of the reviewers here have said this is. I must admit, when I ate this fresh yesterday (i.e. right after I had prepared it), I was terribly underwhelmed. I decided to give this a second try today (after allowing everything to "blend" overnight). While I still think this is too tart for my liking, I do see an ever so slight imporvement. I added about 1/8 c. of sugar which seemed to do the trick, so I'm really glad I gave this another go (I was contemplating tossing everything!). Next time, I'll use equal parts EVOO and vinegar, and maybe even use half cider / half red wine vinegar to tame some of the tartness. I can see how using a superior qualitiy vinegar can (and does) make a difference. I used a name brand one, so it couldn't be that (?). Perhaps my vinegar was too old (i.e. it has become more tart over time)??? Oh, a couple things to note.... I'm not sure it's necessary to use a blender to emulsify this (i.e. so it won't separate). I used my Tupperware Quick Shake container and that worked fine. Yes, my dressing separated quickly, but a quick shake took care of that! Also, this scales well - I only made 10 servings. Thanks for sharing, Danielle! I'm going to try this on a Greek salad since I have so much left. I bet salty feta is all this needs to balance the tartness. :-)

This is a fantastic salad dressing. I made this for dinner last night and after dinner was done my dad said this recipe is a keeper. I ended up making another jar of it before I went to bed. The only change I made was using equal parts olive oil and vinegar. I also mixed everything in my magic bullet. The reason I used my magic bullet is because after the ingredients separate I can just pop the container back on the bullet and it only takes a few seconds.

I have used this dressing on a cucumber/tomato/red onion salad a couple times, once for a July 4th bbq and once for a family reunion...it got rave reviews both times.  In fact, I can't stop eating the leftovers.  my only change is to do as other have suggested and use equal parts oil and vinegar.  Also, I've found that I need less dressing per serving of salad than what it calls for.  So, 12 servings of salad needs about 6 servings of dressing.  YUMMM!!

"Absolutely Fabulous" is absolutely right! Just as good, if not better than many of the best Greek restaurants I have visited.  I've made this several times now and would highly recommend making smaller servings as needed. The crisp zest of the herbs work well together when freshly prepared. Other reviews mentioned adding a squeeze of fresh lemon, and yes, it compliments the dressing exquisitely.

Wow- this stuff is delicious.  I cut the recipe way down to suit the needs of my family, since no one else really eats salad but me.  But guests have commented on it and I am never without some made!  I've used fresh herbs and garlic as well - easy to "mess with" but yummy as listed too!

My family loves this dressing! I took the salad to work for a potluck and most of the ladies asked for the recipes.  I do put a bit less red wine vinegar but if you have a high quality vinegar you may not need to (live in a small town & was desperate..).  I make a big batch & leave it in the fridge. I will also try using it as a chicken marinade.

Awesome recipe, and so easy! I've also used it to marinate chicken for grilled kebobs, and I bet it would be a great marinade for grilled veggies, too. Next batch I'm going to try minced fresh garlic for a little stronger garlic flavor, but it's great just the way it is! Thanks for sharing!

I scaled this recipe back to five servings.  I did make a few changes, one being using equal parts oil and vinegar (1/4 cup each) and using half red and half white wine vinegar.  I followed other advice on using the blender and adding the herbs last, this worked well.  I made the dressing the night before so the flavors could meld, then served it tonight on a Greek salad of romaine lettuce, halved cherry tomatoes, kalamata olives, cucumber, red onion, reduced fat feta cheese crumbles, and rye croutons.  Everyone raved and said it was the best Greek salad they'd ever had!  I will never make another Greek salad at home without using this recipe.  Cannot recommend higher!!

I didn't have onion powder or garlic powder, so I just  diced up real onion and garlic as small as I could. It made the dressing a little chunky, but it was awesome. I got a lot of compliments on the salad I dressed with this!

Made this tonight for some souvlaki.  Delicious.  I followed the recipe as written, but scaled it down for a family of 4 and used a food processor to mix.  This will go into the regular rotation.  I will never buy Greek dressing again!

I just made this today for the second time.   This is a great all-around dressing.   It keeps forever in the fridge too, just shake it up and serve.   I cut the recipe down to 15 and it made just under 2 cups.   Enjoy!!

Totally lived up to the hype!  Used the vinegar I had on hand: 1/2 balsamic 1/2 rice wine, and I was OUTSTANDING!  I imagine it will be even better with the red wine vinegar.  Gonna use the leftovers as a marinade!

I grew up in the shipping town Newport News,  Virginia and this dressing taste just like the house dressing served at the many Greek restaurants in that area.  I made a marinade with this dressing and some lemon juice for pork tenderloin  shish-kabobs and the results were spectacular.  The dressing coagulates when it is cold so it really clung to the meat.

It was a good recipe but I think next time I'll up the garlic and decrease the red wine vinegar a bit.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is pretty good, but to us it is not a 5 star. We like the greek vinaigrette dressing we buy at he grocery store better.

This is the kind of dressing that is good on any kind of salad. Perfect blend of flavors. I don't have red wine vinegar so I used rice vinegar. And I went easy on the oregano as I just don't care for it. The dressing soaked up the feta of my greek salad and the whole thing was just absolutely fabulously delicious.

Too lazy to run to the store to buy dressing, I googled "greek dressing" and it led me here. As everyone else said, it was so easy and I had everything the recipe called for. I changed the portions down to 10 and it was more than enough for our homemade chicken soulvaki pitas. I bet after letting the flavors "meld" for a few days, it will be even better. Delicious!

So wonderful to find a recipe that really can be made right out of your pantry/spice cabinet.  Easy, light and very flavorful.  It's a perfect go-to dressing.  Will be keeping this in my house on a regular basis.

This is delicious dressing.  It's better after it sits for at least a day though.  It was also kind of hard to scale back to just a few servings.

Pretty good stuff.  Only difference is that I apparently was out of garlic powder so I used garlic salt.  It's got a lot of flavor for being such a simple dressing.  Very strong tasting.

After my boss brought the most amazing greek salad his mother-in-law made for our holiday party I could not stop thinking about how badly I wanted to move in with her so I could eat that salad all the time.  So yesterday I realized I'd never be able to do that and set out to find my own recipe.  THIS IS IT.  I honestly did not think I'd ever be able to get back to that feeling I had when I was eating her salad, but this dressing is AMAZING.  SIMPLY PERFECT.   I also used it to marinate some chicken to eat with my salad - DELICIOUS.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

The flavor was great!  I tend to just eyeball the spices, but it always turns out fabulously.  It's a little too sour for my vinegar hating husband, but I couldn't get enough of it!  My only complaint is that after reading the author saying "it doesn't need to be refrigerated," I figured it would be relatively stable.  I scaled down the recipe for 20 servings, but needless to say, had a lot left-- and, unfortunately, after a week, it started getting cloudy and rancid.  It was a shame to pour that much expensive olive oil down the drain.  I'll make this again, but maybe scale down the recipe to 5 or 10 servings next time!!

I just made this recipe quickly before dinner to throw on some fresh cucumbers, tomatoes, and onions from the garden.  YUM!  After my husband finished his salad I noticed him dipping his risotto in the leftover dressing; right then I vowed to never buy Greek dressing again.  As always with Greek anything, this is better with feta!

I really loved this dressing on New Twist To An Old Favorite salad from this site (which did not have a dressing written into the recipe). I think this dressing would be a hit with any Greek-type salad or as a marinade. Flavor and texture are perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best homemade Greek Dressing recipe I have ever found! I think I have made them all in my quest for the perfect dressing :).  It was just a tiny bit tart for my taste, but adding a bit of sugar made it perfect!!  My quest is over.  Thanks for the great recipe, Danielle!!

UNfreakingBELIEVABLE! MAGNIFICO. This is the *ONE*, folks. Danielle, you are a *gem* for posting this, THANK YOU! I've been so utterly dissatisfied with the Grecian dressings on the market, and I've been spoiled by formerly regularly consuming the ~BEST~ & most amazing Greek dressing from an authentic Grecian restaurant in Chicago. I moved out of state over a year ago, and had to resort to the bottled dressings, which have all been great disservice to my Greek salads. This recipe you have betrothed to us tastes -very- similar to the one I crave from the restaurant, and -much- healthier than any bottled deal. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! YUMMAY ;~)

Great dressing!  It was exactly what you expect a greek salad to taste like.  I didn't have any dijon mustard so I used dried mustard instead and it was great.  Thanks for sharing!

I found this recipe a couple of years ago, but never rated it. I made it and have done so several times. It has become a staple in our house. Very tasty, easy to put together and makes a good amount.

I usually reserve my "OH MY GOSH" comments for desserts...but this rocks the world, it is SO AWESOME!!!  Put it on Mediterranean Greek Salad from this website and I seriously can't stop eating it. Only changes I made were: cut serving down from 120 to 12 and cut back a little on the vinegar. MAKE IT, you won't be sorry!!!

Absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was to use vegetable oil instead of olive oil due to dietary restraints.  I will be making this often.

!YIKES! Seriously good eats - I've tried about every dressing recipe on site and this has got to be the best.   My only change was to cut olive oil by about a 3rd (we're big on strong vinegar tastes).  Outstanding and ty for recipe.

I changed the serving size to "10 people" and mixed the ingredients in a very, mini-cuisinart. It was fabulous, fresh, and delicious. I can't ever go back to store-bought dressing.

Wow, I never review recipes but I just had to rave about this one.  It only took me like 5 minutes to make and I love it!  It is so good.  I put it on a romaine salad with greek olives and feta cheese and it was amazing!  I could eat this all day.

A great 'happy medium' for me and hubby. I prefer a sweeter dressing, and he does not, so I added a little sugar to mine and it was wonderful. Thanks for the post!

I have made this twice and both times the dressing tasted great.  The disappointing thing was that it went lumpy after only a few days.  I'm not sure what caused that though, so I will try again, hopefully with more luck.

This was delicious!  I scaled this down quite a bit and will cut back on the amount of red wine vinegar next time. I served this over a salad containing mixed greens, red onions, cucumbers, green peppers, homemade croutons and feta cheese.  YUM!

I just made this for the first time and it was delicious!  I followed others' advice and added a bit more oil to make it equal parts vinegar and oil.  I also used half balsamic vinegar and half wine vinegar.  My husband loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good, but I do agree with the other reviewers who used equal amounts of olive oil and vinegar.  I'm glad I followed that tip because I believe as written the amount of vinegar would have been too overpowering.  All in all it was a good dressing.

even though I have to leave out the mustard part of the recipe, this dressing is now our "house dressing". I haven't bought salad dressing in months now. This is our favorite "greek" dressing, and we are a greek family. Everyone has agreed, for once, that this is good stuff.

This is a great recipe.  I only added a half of a clove of fresh garlic to keep the vampires away.  Also did an Italian version for yesterday's potluck using Italian seasoning in place of the oregano.  Used Romaine and green leaf lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, green/red/orange bell pepper, red onion and lots of shredded parmesan cheese.  Greek version is the same minus the parmesan and add feta cheese and sliced olives.

I followed this exactly....except I made it for 10 instead of the huge amount. My guests loved it. It was delicious on a classic greek salad. My kids (3,2,and 2) even loved it! Great recipe. It does pack a punch! I also used it to make a greek pasta salad....yummy!

This is a great base recipe. Instead of adding more vinegar, I added lemon juice which gave a nice fresh flavor. I also used fresh garlic and minced onion instead of the powders. Great recipe to tinker with and make your own!

I was amazed by all of the glowing reviews and had to try the dressing, but I wasn't terribly impressed. I love homemade dressing, but although it was okay tasting, I'm not a big fan of all of the dried herbs and the texture they gave the dressing.

This dressing had to much vinegar for my taste and a bit salty.  Adding more olive oil helped.  I used this as a marinade for pork tenderloin and it was excellent.

I loved this greek dressing, one of the best I have ever made. I made it as is, and used a bullet blender to mix.  I think I will eat only salad for the next week; this dressing is that good! Thank you so much for sharing!

Excellent and easy.  Everyone comments on how they can't believe it's a homemade dressing.  I just happened to have everything on hand to make it and now we love having it.  I even use this to toss pasta and veggies in for a quick dish.

Used equal amounts of vinegar and olive oil as recommended in recipe; made an 8 serving recipe to use for pasta salad and added 1-2 tbsp grated parmesan.  Love this because I am almost guaranteed to have everything in the house to make it.  Common ingredients ... uncommonly good dressing!

Very good -- I made it with 1 part vinegar to 1 part oil, which works well. Next time, I will only put in half the black pepper called for, as I'm not a fan of black pepper. Otherwise, it's a keeper!

A great dressing.  I used it as a marinade for chicken and veggie kabobs and EVERYONE raved about it.  My brother-in-law said it was some of the best chicken he has ever eaten.  I will be keeping this one around!  Thanks for giving us the 'secret' recipe.

I scaled this down to 10 servings,  and followed other reviewers that used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup vinegar (instead of 2/3 cup) and tossed with Romaine, spinach, tomatoe, kalamata olives, Feta cheese....turned out fabulous!

I used balsmaic vinegar instead, as this is what I had.  I also used less than was reccomended and at first I thought wow this is still too much! I added a tiny bit of sugar and after sitting overnight, it's just delicious! I will definitely be making it again when this batch is gone!

Excellent!  I made it with white wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and next time I would reduce the amount.  It was pretty vinegary but very flavourful.  I will definitely make this again.

I did scale this down to 12 servings. It was good but not my favorite dressing recipe. But some it could be I followed others advice and cut down on the red vingar. It also seemed to be really heavy with the oregano, and basil. So I am going to play around with the amount of spices and the vinegar. I think this would be great on a salad with lots of feta cheese, purple onion, and black olives. So I am going to give it another try.

Mmmmmmmmm!This is one yummy dressing! I was going to add fresh garlic, but decided to follow the recipe exactly as written, and I'm glad I did.  It's fabulous!  I tossed it with a salad made with baby spinach, romaine, tomatoes, red, yellow, and orange peppers, artichokes, green onions, black olives, zucchini, cucumbers, mushrooms and tomato basil feta cheese.  I can't tell you how good it is and healthy, too!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Slightly too vinegary so perhaps add equal parts oil and vinegar. Someone else suggested adding a tiny bit of sugar and I'll try that next time. This is wonderful for on rice or potatoes too. I like having something like this to dip my fries into. Very easy and simple for such wonderful taste.

Oh my goodness, this is really delicious. I scaled it down, I used equal amounts of oil and vinegar, and used fresh pressed garlic instead of powdered. The only thing I can say, is next time I may reduce the black pepper by maybe a third.  Just felt it was a tiny bit too much. I will be passing this great recipe on to all my friends!

This is the recipe I was looking for.  It's very easy to scale down and tastes great.  Occasionally I will just make enough for a couple of servings and it is still wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe.

Not only is this a delicious dressing, but it makes and INCREDIBLE marinade too!  I used it on a NY Strip a couple of nights ago.  The smell of it grill was amazing and the flavor was out of this world.

Thanks!

Fabulous dressing!  Very vinegary, but I like that.  I used it on the Greek Couscous Salad for a crowd from this site.  I scaled it down to 15 and it made alot.

Wonderful and so flavorful. I scaled it down to 10 people and used 1/2 cup oil and 1/4 cup vinegar - mostly red wine with a splash of balsamic and lemon juice.

This dressing is so simple, I don't know why it's so good, but it is.  Like some other reviewers, it has actually been making me eat more veggies, just to have the dressing!  Make sure you use good quality olive oil, and don't substitute another vinegar for the red wine vinegar.

good recipe, but better (in my opinion) if 1/2 oil and 1/2 vinegar is used, as well as a little sugar (a tsp. for 10 servings).

I have to agree, this is a fabulous dressing. I was in the mood for pasta and feta cheese.  I added sweet onion, red & yellow peppers, green olives, capers, Kalamata olives (don't like the pits) and pepperoni!  This was an outstanding salad thanks to the wonderful dressing recipe.  THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS ONE.

Just had a barbecue for two dozen people and everyone loved it!  So easy to make and so delicious. The only thing I changed was omitting the onion powder (I forgot to buy some), and I used fresh garlic.

This is one of the best dressings I have ever tasted!  I didn't have dijon, so I used yellow and I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used 1/4 c balsamic & 1/4 c apple cider vinegar.  Both of the subs were suggested by others.  I will be eating more salad with this recipe!  YUMMY

Excellent.  I scaled it right down to 4 and it was great.  I discovered I was out of Red Wine Vinegar, so I used a fresh lemon juice instead.  I also used a garlic glove and ommited the onion powder.  I then used it on a greek pasta salad.  This is definitely a keeper!

This is really good dressing. It does have a strong vinegar taste though, so if you're not fond of really sour stuff, you may want to cut back on the vinegar.

Used this on Party-Size Greek Couscous Salad from this site and it was perfect. I will definitely use this again. Thanks for the post.

Personally, I thought it was horrible! Too much peppery for my taste (even though I didn’t use the entire amount listed in the recipe). I couldn’t even eat my salad! It was really bad.

I am giving it 2 stars just because my husband thought it was good (we come from different cultures so I assume that’s why I didn’t like it!) but really…inedible! Now I have 2 big bottles full of something that we will end up throwing away.

Very good, just the way I like Greek dressing...a little harsh without sugar, but a perfect complement to salty feta.


Thanks for the great recipe.

This is amazing!  I use it nearly every day.  I really like oregano so I put in a little extra and I think that makes it even better.  Everyone should try this recipe at least once!  I also gave it as gifts at Christmas and everyone who got one loved it too.

I made up two bottles of this for Christmas for my parents.  It's greenish and reddish, and in a fancy bottle it makes a nice gift.  It's better than store-bought dressing, and makes a good table dressing - I haven't gotten tired of it like I often do with more distinctive dressings.  Very zesty - I use it to perk up so-so greens a lot.

I scaled to 10 servings and it fit perfectly into a Good Seasonings vinaigrette bottle.  As others have mentioned, this IS quite tart, but delicious.  I may try to decrease the vinegar a bit next time.  I'm used to a "gentler" Greek dressing that's white in color, but I still really enjoyed this and will keep it on hand.

Completely love this dressing!  I can't use commercial dressings any more because of diet constraints...and this was just what I needed. The taste is just what I wanted and it was so easy!  Love the conversion button on this site...I converted it to 30 servings...

Side note...I used organic apple cider vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar because that is what I had in the fridge...and it worked perfectly!!!

Thanks for posting this Danielle I really appreciate it!

This recipe has "good bones", but it needed a lot of tweaking to get a good flavorful taste, but that is probably more personal taste, just like with anything.  I like my dressing chilled, so I chilled overnight, if you are going to do this, you may want to wait until serving to play around with it too much, the flavor intensified overnight.  All in all still MUCH better than store bought dressings.

I reduced the recipe to 10 servings which was a perfect amount.  I also reduced the fat by using 1/2 water for 1/2 the oil.  I really liked the ease of making it and the taste although a bit sharp and a bit too much pepper.  I will make it  again reducing the pepper by 1/2 and maybe reducing the vinegar by a tablespoon or two.  Definitely serve the salad with feta cheese and sun-dried tomatoes!

Love this dressing. I made some and gave to my mom and she bugs me every month to make more. She adds it to a little ranch or blue cheese or alternative creamy dressing to add some zest when you want a change of pace. Enjoy!

This is very good, almost too good.  It is very strong, but if you like strong then this is the perfect dressing!  I like strong, my husband does not.

VERY GOOD! I used part red wine vinager and part balsamic. I also scaled recipe to 10 servings. This was wonderful over a simple greek salad.

This dressing has the right amount of seasoning.
All of it blends real well.  A nice change from the usual oil and vinegar!

I added this recipe to a traditional Greek salad for lunch yesterday and it was WONDERFUL!  I ended up having to use regular salad vinegar, though, as I was out of red wine vinegar.  I also added a little balsamic vinegar, too.  I scaled it down to 6 servings and that was more than enough for our salad.

The dressing was very good.  I only gave it 4 stars because I think the vinegar was a little overpowering.  Either needs less vinegar or  sugar or something.  I would still make it again though.

We really like this dressing, but it is very vinegar-y.  I only gave it four stars because I wouldn't serve it to just anyone, only to friends I'm certain like vinegar.  A tasty variation is one with parmesan cheese added but then you can't leave it out on the counter, obviously, or the cheese goes bad.  I'd just add cheese to the part we'll be using immediately.

This dressing is fantastic! My husband is very picky and after he finished his salad, he drank the remaining dressing from the bottom of the bowl! This will definitely be our "house" dressing!

This is really tasty, considering how easy it is to make - no chopping or mincing! For my preference, the ratio of oil to vinegar is backwards. I scaled the servings to 10 and flipped the measurements for the O&V, using the larger for the oil. I also added about a TBS of sugar. Mix in a blender to properly emulsify. It's tart but very delicious!

This dressing is wonderful. It makes a huge amount, so make a quarter of the amount. It's still a regular salad bottle full or more. I wouldn't change anything except to cut the salt by a lot.  (because of my own dietary requirements.) It's delicious, Thank you, Danielle!!!

A bottle of this does not last long in our house!
It's also delicious with cider vinegar,not as tart! 
There used to be this Italian restaurant in livonia Michigan, called Mama Mia's  and there house dressing was amazing!!! Just dipping their bread sticks in the dressing was a meal fit for kings. This recipe is awful close to their recipe. I've been tweaking it a bit!  Solid 5 stars!!

First batch was made as directed, with garlic powder and onion powder.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................


It tasted OK, but was missing the zip that those of us that make their own salad dressings look for. After all, that zip is the reason that we make our own fresh salad dressings in the first place!!
...............................................................................................................................................................................................

Second batch as made with fresh pressed garlic and VERY finely chopped onion. I also halved the amount of vinegar, using Braggs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................
It was absolutely delicious!!!
........................................................................................................................................................................................................

Next time I’m going to try using the garlic press to press the onions to make the onions even more finely chopped.

I made this, but I don’t know that I love it as a salad dressing. It was too tart for my salad.  HOWEVER, it is probably THE BEST chicken marinade I’ve ever eaten!  Holy cow.  Soooo good.  So, for that reason, it gets 5 stars from me.  I will marinate chicken in it many, many more times.  Thank you!

Awesome greek salad dressing! I made it as stated the first time and it was great. 

The only thing I didnt like was that it separated within seconds of shaking and it if you pour out a bit too much your salad is ruined. I put the dressing in one of those store bought salad dressing shakers and it ended up spewing everywhere on the ride home. 
The fix is to definitely emulsify it... throw it in a good blender and chop up all of those seasonings super fine. The mix will stay blended better and not be as leaky.

Also, my hubby hates salty and I thought this may come across way to salty to him, so I left out the salt. The vinegar added enough flavor for both of us to enjoy.

This is a great home made recipe for a greek or Italian style salad dressing. Scale it down to fit your needs but it keeps on the counter in a jar for a long time. We have been using this one as a staple for years

As a Greek and as a Greek Chef my taste buds are pretty much in target. This recipe is just “ok”. Anyone making this should definitely scale down the vinegar to half the written amount. Second, I would cut back my salt to half the written amount. 
Will I make this again ? Probably not unless I tweaked it

I love salads but am on a low sodium diet however it has been hard to find a good recipe for salad dressing.  Came across this recipe, made exactly as written and it is now my favorite, I make it frequently.

As is it's too tart. I scale it down to 5 servings and use almost 3/4 cup oil instead of the 1/4 cup called for and leave the vinegar at 1/3 cup.

I just made this dressing and it is absolutely fabulous.  I scaled it down to 10 servings so it would fit in a container.  I want to comment that I made a few modifications , but nothing drastic.
1- I cut the amount of olive oil in 1/2 and used low fat chicken broth as a substitute for the remaining amount of oil.  I did this because I wanted a lower fat version.  TIP: You can actually do this for any dressing recipe 
2- After reading a ton of the other reviews stating that the vinegar was too much, I cut the amount of vinegar in 1/2 and used lemon juice as a substitute for the remaining amount
3- I don't believe that Danielle says this in her recipe, but I made it in the blender to make sure that the oil & vinegar blended.  
That was it!  The mustard gives this dressing a touch of creaminess but it still remains a vinaigrette and the flavor is amazing.

Delicious! Scaled down and used equal parts oil/vinegar, (balsamic vinegar and spicy brown mustard -what I had). Measurements: 1/2 c oil/vin, 1 tsp + rounded 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, basil, oregano. 1 tsp salt, pepper, onion powder, mustard. All but oil in blender, slowly blend in oil. Store in lidded container that can be spooned out in fridge and it stays emulsified.

This is now a staple in our house.  I used the measurements of the first reviewer and keep it in the cupboard, no need to refrigerate!!! My extremely picky son loves it.  I too put equal amounts of vinegar and oil to help with the tanginess.  It's an excellent recipe, thank you so much

LOVE LOVE LOVE this salad dressing.  I've used it on Greek salads, leafy greens, and anything calling for Italian dressing.  The only thing I changed was to use half red wine vinegar and half balsamic vinegar.  Occasionally I'll use Italian seasoning instead separately using oregano and basil.  Such a versatile dressing.

Thank you!!! I’ve been looking everywhere for a good Greek dressing. Store bought doesn’t cut it. My favorite is Panera Bread because of the bite of the vinegar and this doesn’t disappoint. I swear I could drink this. Hahaha. Definitely going to become a staple in my household and it comes together in less than five minutes. Perfection!

This is a flavorful and easy Greek dressing. I made according to the recipe, but scaled down to 10 servings. This would be excellent over a Greek pasta salad, and I'm definitely going to try that. Thanks for the recipe!

Divided recipe down to make a pint. This really good. Lasts a really long time with out refrigeration.  Only change we made is adding a lot more wine vinegar and a bit more Dijon. We like more bite in our vinaigrette. Great as a marinade for caprese salad

It was a very good Greek dressing. I used lemon juice instead of red wine vinegar. Lemon seems more of a  Greek flavor to me.

I do love this recipe!  Made it once before and I found my favourite thing to do was dip my baguette into the dressing.  It's very tangy - not sure how to tone that part down. Will definitely keep this one in my list of favs ;)

Followed the advice of reviewers and did equal parts oil and vinegar - still a little tart for my taste, but very good. I think I would like it much better with balsamic vinegar, so I'll try that next time. 

One small annoyance (which I doubt is the recipe writer's fault) is that this recipe came up in a search for Whole30, but Dijon mustard contains wine, which means it is NOT Whole30. Not a big deal - I used spicy brown mustard instead.

I wasn't sure about the mustard ingredient; but put it in anyway.  It is a very versatile dressing. I scaled it down because we didn't need a gallon of it.

So Good!!  My husband won't let me make any other dressing because he loves it so much.  Great on a salad with kalamata olives, feta, avacado,  and tomatoes.

Awesome dressing! I didn't change a thing...just scaled down. After reading the reviews, I'm wondering if y'all don't know that there is a tool on the recipe that scales it down for you. Just adjust it down to the serving size you wish to make.

I have made this many times followed the smaller recipe and it's fantastic. Also great over tomatoes alone, or cucumbers and onions.

I used fresh herbs and garlic.  Simple and delish.  I do think it could use a little salt.  PS.  I put equal parts vinegar and oil.

I read AngKN advice to scale down the recipe amounts but the dressing went right to the top of my Good Seasons dressing bottle, not enough room to put the top on or shake up the dressing. Just a warning to others you might need a bigger bottle.   I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar. I didn't realize to use Dijon mustard and used powdered mustard instead. I used Greek seasoning spice to replace the pepper.   But it all came together anyway and the dressing was excellent!

I made this with the scaled down ingredients.  It was a bit tart for me, my husband loved it though.  I am making it a second time but adding a teaspoon of sugar to balance it out.  Overall though it is a really good/easy recipe using ingredients I already have on hand and I really like that.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would.  This recipe is OUTSTANDING!  Ive been trying to find a good greek salad dressing recipe for soooo long and it's been way more challenging that I thought! They're either "creamy" (ick), too sweet, strange combos of flavors, etc.  I've been at this for years! I'm from Michigan, home of the Coney Island where greek dressing is king.  Since I live in Chicago now (go Cubbies!), my mom would bring me some of their dressing from Leo's Coney Island (if you ever have the chance...GO!) and it was really good.  But, the main ingredient is  soy oil and they put sugar and other stuff in it that I'd prefer to not put in my body (but once in a while I'm okay with!).  But THIS recipe is the closest thing you will find to Leo's legendary dressing--without the ! And it's Paleo, Whole 30, etc.  I adore this.  I've been making the same salad for a few months now and I am still not tired of it: Romaine, grape tomatoes, diced purple onions, chopped cucumbers, feta cheese and THIS.  Please make this.  It is incredible!  I triple it and keep it in a jar in the fridge and it keeps smashingly.  :)

This is great recipe, although I use it for the list of ingredients and not for the actual measurements. I always add some honey and that makes it perfect.

Does this recipe need another glowing review?  Probably not, but here it is anyway!  I doubled the recipe to make a big Greek salad for a church function and I got MANY great reviews.  It wasn't the usual "oh that salad was good" - several people sought me out to say "that salad was GREAT!!!"  "Fabulous," "REALLY GOOD," "Did YOU make that salad?"  So if you want to be a hero, make this salad.  Thank for the great post!

Thank you to the home chef that originally posted this and to AngKN for the ingredients exchange.  It was such a help.  I followed the recipe based upon AngKN's specifications exactly except substituting Kosher for regular salt. This is truly one of the best dressings out there. I went to "homemade" dressings" last year and keep trying new ones. What a difference making your own dresssings does for the whole experience. I would never go back to the bottle.  This will become a staple in my dressing repertoire and can see it working equally well for sub sandwiches and even for a quick bread salad.  Hats off to you both.

I quartered this recipe and it turned out friggin amazing! Reminds me of a restaurant back home that uses a very similar dressing on their Greek salad.  I’m giving this a two thumbs up, 5 star! It’s the only dressing I’m using from now on.

I didn’t have any onion powder but used red onion in the salad so probably didn’t matter.  It was very good.  Quite tangy and I think better the next day rather than when used right after making.

I made this, the smaller quantity version, except that I mis-interpreted the mustard part and used whole mustard seeds instead of prepared mustard. No matter. I put it over tomatoes and onions for a summery salad and it was amazing!

Love this Greek dressing!! It is supposed to be very tart! It's Greek dressing! I have had Greek salads out where they put Balsamic vinegar in the dressing and it is all wrong for a Greek salad. Balsamic is sort of sweet. Make is as written. You can put equal amounts of oil and vinegar if you want without changing the taste too much. This is SPOT-ON!

Definitely a “do again”.  Use Greek Oregano to get the full flavour.

For a better emulsion, try mixing spices and mustard with the vinegar, then slowly blend in the olive oil. Very good!

Just a little too tart, having the same amounts of red wine vinegar and olive oil. I reduced the amount of the vinegar slightly, but would reduce it even further. I added about a tsp of sugar, and that helped a bit. I scaled this down to 7 servings.

Wish I could rate this a 10 - - it is unbelievable.  Only thing I changed was the  serving size to 10 - - love how it can sit on the counter, not be refrigerated, and gets better every day!  This will be the only dressing I use with the Greek Salad (cucumbers, roma tomatoes, kalamata olives, feta cheese) from this site.  YUM!

I cut the recipe down by a factor of 4 and I still had plenty to use as a marinade for pork chops and a Greek(ish) salad.  its just slightly sweeter than I would like, but on balance it was excellent.  I'll figure out what I need to dial back in order to cut the sweetness.

I will absolutely use this recipe again!

OMG OMG OMG!!! This is the BEST dressing ever!! Perfect amount of tang! I reduced to 10 servings, but next time will make 20 servings! Most dressings have way too much oil, but this was the perfect ratio. I can't wait to try it on my Greek tortellini salad! Amazing! Thank you!!!

Delicious! The recipe scales down well and the ratios are correct. You really do need all the seasonings. I use a little less vinegar because it's very tart.

This is an excellent dressing. The only thing I did different was I used Garlic infused olive oil.  I then used this on a pasta salad that I made with bowtie pasta, onion, green pepper, roasted red pepper, cucumber, tomatoes, kalamata olives and feta cheese.

I scaled this back to 5 servings and due to personal preference only used half the salt. This dressing is a little tart and is much better if made a day or two before needed to allow the ingredients to blend.  I think it needs to be used for heartier salads, like Greek with feta and olives, pasta, bean, or grain salads.

Made the scaled down version that is listed as the most helpful positive review.  I did not find it tart at all as others seemed to.  Maybe they are used to the bottled dressings that all have added sugar?  I specifically did NOT want a dressing that had sweet in it at all.  This was fabulous!

I realized that my store-bought Greek dressing had expired months ago and my Greek salad was already prepared. Found this recipe on the fly, had all the ingredients except for oregano, and I made it in no time. Turned out to be the perfect dressing. Just enough zip and zang, but not overpowering.

Watch out for the number of servings on this recipe. Once you make that adjustment, it is wonderful. I use it for a dressing on pasta salad and everyone raves over it. The flavors are bright and delicious!

Really good dressing!  Thank you to AngKN for breaking it down to home-friendly proportions.  

I find most oil/vinegar recipes to be too bland and oily for my personal taste. For me, the one cup red wine vinegar  to 3/4 cup oil was great!

Now the most requested dressing I make. Used the smaller version. Someone said it was too vinegary.  Omg that is what is so good about it. 
This is not for the faint of  heart. It is zesty, tangy, bright, and an awesome Greek dressing.

Delicious.   I made a big salad and served with  thick sliced Ecce Panis Country Wheat Loaf bread grilled then brushed with olive oil and sprinkled sea salt and oregano.  Yummy light dinner.

It needs to set a little while to let the flavors mingle. It had a great flavor the next day but a bit to much oil for me. I'll tweak it to my taste next time around but I'll be keeping this one. Thanks for sharing.

Followed the recipe as written and was not disappointed.  Even my husband, who is not a big fan of Greek salad, gave it a thumbs up.

This is a great dressing! I do agree with the many other reviewers here about how it has too much vinegar. I kept it at a 1:1 ratio, and even that was a little too vinegary but not bad. I also tried making it with balsamic vinegar instead of red wine and I think it came out better for some reason. The sweetness made the dressing less sour and more tasty.

I used AngKN's proportions as follows: 3/4 cup oil 1 cup vinegar 2 tsp garlic powder 2 tsp oregano 2 tsp basil 

I adjusted the following  to : 1/2  tsp pepper 1/2  tsp salt
Since I didn't have onion powder I added in fresh chopped green onion (about a tsp- you might want to add more & mince it super fine) and about 1/2  fresh red onion , minced
I used 1.5 tsp regular yellow mustard 
Fantastic!

I spent a long time searching for a recipe that replicated a Greek dressing from a favorite local fast food joint...this is the closest I've come!  Brings back memories and even gets my 10 year old son to eat salad.  Two thumbs WAY up!!

This is now my go-to dressing.  I always make the scaled-down version just because that's the size container I have, but I use it so much, I should just make it by the gallon.  I've seen some people say it's too tart.  I completely disagree,  In fact, I change up the vinegar to oil ratio slightly to favor vinegar a bit more (my taste).  So if you are hesitating based on those reviews 1) don't worry and/or 2) adjust the oil:vinegar ratio to your taste!

Has all my favorite ingredients. Good balance.
Personally like it better with vegetable (soy bean) oil but good both ways.

Very good dressing. Naturally I didn't make nearly as much as was suggested and added a touch of sweet (agave). Definitely one to repeat!

Made this dressing today and it's TASTY! The ingredients really pack a punch to the taste buds. I'm looking forward to tasting it after all the flavors have married to see how things mellow and meld. I can see using this dressing on a multitude of not only salads, but other dishes too. UPDATE: used this dressing on a simple green salad and wow was it good! The flavors married very well and mellowed to a nice balance. My husband said it reminded him of restaurant dressing. A big hit in our house!

I used the reduced measurements suggested in another comment, and it was good but a bit too much vinegar. I think I would reduce the vinegar to 1/2 cup.

Wonderful dressing.  I was out of red wine vinegar so I used white balsamic vinegar.  This is a keeper that I will make again and again.  This also made a great marinade for grilled chicken, spiced just right!

Did the scaled down version, added to gluten free pasta, zucchini, red/green pepper, cucumber, red onion (sliced then added to ice water to take away strong onion flavour & after taste), tomatoes & olives. Made day ahead for a function (had way too much food) and then finished it off on the third day, still was very good.  Did use a very good red vinegar.

I have not tried this recipe but having visited Greece and talked to many cooks in Greek restaurants I know that they don't use vinegar; they use fresh lemon juice so altho this recipe sounds wonderful I would not call it "the best Greek dressing".

I used @AngKN's measurements but added an additional tablespoon of Dijon and a pinch of sugar. The second time I added small feta crumbles to the dressing. It's great both ways.

Love this recipe! We never buy greek dressing at our house anymore. I make a few adjustments to our personal taste.... equal parts oil and vinegar, and I like to add one part balsamic vinegar (3/4 red wine to 1/4 balsamic). Also, if you're a beet lover like me, try adding pickled beet slices to the greek salad. It really is absolutely fabulous!

Love it!  I am addicted to Panera Greek salad.  I was able to buy their bottled Greek salad dressing from  a grocery store,  but nobody is stocking Greek.  I did the same scaled down version from one of the reviews.  Came out great.

Best greek salad dressing EVER!  I could drink this stuff straight it's so good.  I made a greek chicken salad for my kids  (who can be pretty picky with non-ranch dressings) and they had seconds and asked when we were having this for dinner again!

I made this from the scaled down version. I thought it needed a couple of teaspoons of sugar to counter the vinegar, but otherwise, just stuck to the recipe. The sugar didn't make it sweet, just less pungent. When I tasted it alone, I wasn't hopeful. But once it combines with the salad makings, calamari olives, red onion, fresh summer tomatoes and feta cheese, it is heavenly. I have eaten three salads for lunch this week. Yummy!

Favor is wonderful! Next time I think I'll use a food processor so the oil will emulsify.

Terrific dressing. I liked it as is but my husband thought it was a little tart. I took the advice I saw here and added just a little sugar to it. It cut the tartness and made it even better! I love to make this dressing for my tortellini salad!

I made enough for 20 servings. I did eliminate all the salt because  of the feta cheese I added to the salad. We though it was a great dressing and will use the rest of the dressing on another salad this week. Thanks for the recipe

Really good! I adjusted it to 15 servings and added a chunk of feta. I to blend in my blender, it helps to keep the oil from separating and mixes in the feta. Will definitely make this again.

This is the BEST Greek salad dressing! So very good!  I adjusted the quantity to 10 servings which is the perfect amount for my cruet bottle.  I do like mine just a little bit sweet so I add 1 tsp Stevia/sugar. This is also really good over sliced tomatoes with feta cheese which I make when I'm too lazy to make an entire salad.

This is a great dressing, but it was a little heavy on the vinegar for my husband and I. I downsized the recipe to make about a cup and will be increasing the oil content and decreasing the vinegar. This is excellent over a salad of greens, greek olives, feta, diced tomato and thin sliced red onion!

On a side note - does not keep well! After 3 days it was so tangy that it was almost unedible. I don't know what happened but it was so tangy and acidic, I could barely get my salad down.

This is so delicious!  I used the modified smaller recipe version from AngKN and it worked out great.  My husband and I loved it on our greek salad.  Here is an excerpt of AngKN review: "Here are the scaled down measurements that will fit into one of those glass, good seasons dressing bottles: 3/4 cup oil 1 cup vinegar 2 tsp garlic powder 2 tsp oregano 2 tsp basil 1.5 tsp pepper 1.5 tsp salt 1.5 tsp onion powder 1.5 tsp mustard "

I used the scaled down version to make a smaller batch of dressing. The vinegar was a little too tart for me so I added 2 packets of Splenda to cut the acidity. And a 1/4 cup of feta cheese. I blended it using the stick blender. It's great now! I think next time I'll just cut back on the vinegar so I won't have to add sweetener...but I'll leave the blended feta.

The red wine vinegar is too overpowering. I made the scaled down recipe which calls for 3/4 cup of oil and 1 cup of vinegar. I cut it down to 1/2 cup of vinegar and it was perfect! It's better after it sits for at least an hour. I used it in my Greek pasta salad. One of the best pasta salads I've ever had!

This dressing is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!! I thought 1:1 vinegar to olive oil was excessively strong and I made it with 1:3 you can even do 1:4 ratio as is common in most vinaigrette recipes. I love to make this for my homemade greek salads with just 2 dolmas from a can. YUM!!!

This dressing is so ridiculously good. I've made it a couple times with fresh garlic and herbs, and kept it in the fridge, and it's wonderful, but the last batch I made (with proportions similar to other reviewers) I followed the instructions exactly and it was great. I'm currently eating it on a salad of avocado, bocconcini, and grape tomatoes. I've used it as seasoning for roasted potatoes. It's great on salad, don't get me wrong, but there are so many other uses for it.

It was okay, nothing special really.  I found it a bit tart due to the vinegar so if I make it again I'll cut down on the vinegar a bit.  I made 10 servings.

I love this dressing. I cut it to 30 servings instead of the original. And used 1 ½ cup red wine vinegar to ½ cup balsamic. Everything else I put in was the scaled down amounts. Some may find it a bit too vinegary but to me it was fine. Also when u store in the fridge, u have to wait a bit for the oil to return into liquid state. I also took someone elses suggestion and pulsed everything in the blend except for oil and the 2 herbs, the oil I then gradually added as I continued to pulse. I finally added the 2 herbs and gave it a pulse or 2.
Its an awesome light dressing

Loved this dressing so much!  I scaled it down according to the other reviews and took the recommendation of 3oz red wine vinegar with 1 oz balsamic.

Great seasoning, but next time I'll do 1 part vinegar to 2 parts oil. As it was, the dressing made you pucker because of the vinegar. I also cut the proportions down (dividing everything by 6), and it turned out very well. A terrific alternative to buying dressing, and you know everything that went in it!

I had high hopes for this dressing but realized that I used organic apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar by mistake. Ooops....but it seems to still be very nice. I shall take pains to make it correctly the next time.

This was outstanding.  I love the simplicity.  I had most of the ingredients already in my cabinet outside of having brown spicy mustard and apple cider vinegar instead of what was listed.  It came out great, nonetheless.  I'll certainly be using this again.

Wow, excellent.  I used a previous poster's scaled-down measurements since only the hubs and me were eating it.  I used 1/4 c olive oil, 2/3 tsp each of garlic powder, Dried oregano, dried basil; 1/2 tsp each of onion powder, dijon mustard, kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper; 1/3 c red wine vinegar.  Whisked it all together and tossed it with mixed greens, feta, tomato, and cucumber.  Yummo!!!  Thank you for sharing such a great salad dressing recipe.

This is the best, and coincidentally the easiest, Greek salad dressing recipe I have ever made. Combine this with the traditional ingredients of a Greek salad, or any other vegetable (sliced cucumbers and onions by themselves make a great, refreshing side salad) for great flavor.  And for the absolute best combination, if you live near a Trader Joe's, try their "Pastures of Eden" feta. You will never use any other. 

Needless to say, I scaled down the proportions to feed fewer than 120--thanks for that option, Allrecipes!

Good with modifications.  The vinegar is really overpowering.  I generally don't like commercial, store bought salad dressings because all I can taste is vinegar.  I also scaled this down to size so that it would fit into a salad dressing bottle.  My version is light and flavorful.

Here's my version: 1 cup avocado oil; 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar; 2 t each of garlic powder, oregano, and basil; and  1.5 t each of salt, pepper, onion powder, and mustard.

Enjoy!

Adjusted ingredients for 8 servings. Truly amazing! 100 times better than any Greek dressing you can buy!  We love making our own salad dressing, and this one is a keeper! Fancy...yet fast and easy! Thanks for sharing! :)

Wonderful recipe!! I used the scaled down measurements that another reviewer was kind enough to post and made this dressing in the good seasons glass salad dressing carafe. I made it twice and I think that the recipe is better with equal parts vinegar and oil as opposed to more vinegar as other reviewers have suggested. My husband loves Greek salad (pretty much the only salad I can get him to eat) so this dressing is a great way to get him to eat his veggies with dinner!! Thanks for sharing!!

Such a great recipe! I didn't have dijon mustard so I omitted it and subbed balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar and it was a huge hit! So quick, easy, and cost efficient, plus it's so much better than anything you can buy. No more bottled dressings for me!

Meh.  I am really surprised by all of the rave reviews.  This was sub-par nothing special for me.  A simple oil, vinegar, dijon and S&P is better than this to me.  Will not make again.  Very disappointed because I had high hopes!  :-(

Very, very good.  Due to the quantities and in the interest of not spending a mini-fortune I used GFS branded olive oil and red wine vinegar and it turned out perfect.  I wouldn't change anything on this recipe.

AMAZING! I loved this recipe. The only things I changed was using fresh instead of powdered ingredients. For the dried items, I used the equivalent in Italian Seasoning (found in stores) due to lack of ingredients on hand. I was great and everyone loved it!

This dressing is amazing! I didn't have Dijon mustard so I just used regular and  it turned out amazing anyway.  This is by far my favorite dressing and it calls for things most people have in their kitchen anyway so it is easy to have all the ingredients on hand at any time.

This dressing is unbelievably good. 

I chopped cucumber, tomato, red onion, and stuffed it in a pita with chicken, spinach, and feta cheese, and drizzled the dressing on top. Now I crave it every day!

There's a lot of vinegar in this. It's too overpowering so I cut the vinegar in half but kept everything else the same ratio and it was just perfect for me. I also had to substitute the vinegar with half balsamic and half white vinegar. Turned out great. Would make again and again! The dressing is very versatile too. You can use it in cooking. I love to marinate and stir fry cucumbers in this dressing. Poor over cold soba noodles with Greek veggies on top with some soy sauce/tiny bit of rice vinegar/ginger powder/dashi mix for a delicious Japanese Greek fusion summer dish. Yum!

I'm obsessed with Greek salads and this dressing is spot on. I did make a smaller batch using someone else's suggestions since a gallon of dressing for a two person family seemed a little much. Thanks for posting this!

Made it per AngKN's scaled-down version.  Wonderful dressing!  And I love the fact that it doesn't have to be refrigerated.  I've tried others but keep coming back to this one.

Definitely the ratio of vinegar to oil is off. I will try this again but make it with more oil than vinegar

My own fault as I was thinking it was too much salt and pepper and WOW, yes it was.   What a waste of good olive oil and vinegar.  The ingredients are fine; the ratio is not - I did have to adjust serving size as I do not own a restaurant. I will try to use this as a base and dilute it to make it edible.

I had just returned home from BJ's warehouse with a salad container full of fresh spinach, and a large jar of Italian/greek olives, but forgot the greek dressing. I replaced the onion powder/garlic with what I had on hand. "the gourmet collection" garlic & onion spice blend. I used the basil, oregano, pepper, salt exactly as stated. Thankfully, I keep a large jar of organic Dijon mustard in the fridge. Since I was out of wine vinegar, I replaced the red wine vinegar with 1/2 C. white cooking wine, and 1/2 C. apple cider vinegar. I followed AngKN's scaled down version. Turned out delicious! Even my 7 yr old loved it. He said this was the first salad he enjoyed.

Great dressing!  Started off with the less is more rule based on other reviews but ended up following the measurements exactly for 5 servings.  Best thing about this recipe is that it's easy to tweak, so when I'm in the mood for something more or less tart, not a problem.  As long as I have the ingredients, I don't think I'll be doing store bought again.

Delicious!! This reminds me of the Michigan chain of pizza restaurants Buddy's salad dressing. They make an antipasto salad using a freshly chopped mixture of romaine hearts and iceberg lettuce topped with diced 
imported ham, salami, natural Wisconsin brick 
cheese and fresh tomatoes.

Just made it and tried it. Thank You for sharing this recipe! Sooo good!! Ive been looking for a good greek dressing recipe for a while haven't had any luck.This is great. I ran out of red wine vinegar so I had to sub a little over 1/3 cup with white wine vinegar, also didn't have Dijon so I just used whole grain brown mustard. I used about half the salt as well. YUM!

Very happy with this dressing recipe!  My hubby loves Greek Salad, so I made Greek Salad tonight for the first time and it went over very well indeed - said it was REALLY good and had a second helping before we ate our steak meal!   Thank you for sharing!!  I scaled it to 10 servings and it made a lot - will keep just fine in a mason jar in pantry and will definitely use it up.  I might just try this out as a marinade for veggies before grilling !

This has become a staple dressing at our house. We do play with the type of vinegar and oil to change up the flavor a bit. Other than that can't get any better!

Very good dressing but the vinegar/oil ratio needed a tweak.  I used a 10 serving recipe and cut way back on the red wine vinegar. Instead of 2/3 c., I used 1/3 c.  Dressing was quite thick because of this so I added a little water to thin out.  I also added about 1/2 tsp. sugar to counteract all the tartness.  Another reviewer used both red wine and balsamic vinegar which I will try next time.  The balsamic won't be as tart.  Definitely a repeat.

As others have mentioned, a little less vinegar makes this the perfect salad dressing.  We love this recipe and wouldn't think of purchasing dressing at the store:-(

I make this salad dressing quite often and love it!  The dressing has a really tangy flavor that goes awesome with some romaine, Kalamata olives, red onion, feta cheese, cherry tomato, cucumber,etc. Sometimes I use this as a chicken or a zucchini marinade and then grill it up... Delicious for a summer lunch.  Thanks for the fab recipe, I will definitely continue to refer and recommend it!  Made a Greek salad for a family lunch and got great compliments from my in laws... definitely try this one out!

I have made this a couple of times and I just can't get enough! I don't even know why I make 8-10 servings because I love this dressing so much, I need to make more. I usually adjust the recipe to make less servings and follow it exactly. I wouldn't change a thing. I make my salad with italian mix lettuce, sliced cucumbers, Campari tomatoes, kalamata olives and traditional feta. It's amazing.

I've slightly tweaked this recipe, 2/3 oregano to 1/3 basil and cider instead of red wine vinegar. We now use this Greek Dressing in our restaurant.

I used to eat only cream-based dressings until I tried this.  This recipe has changed the way I eat salad.  Love it! P.S...it's also great on pita with grilled chicken, feta, and vegetables.

Absolutely fabulous...just as the name implies! I've been making this for years (I'm slow to rate). Now days I make it with apple cider vinegar for the health benefits. I also add a little honey for subtle sweetness. It makes a great marinade, especially for shrimp. It's a must try!

The recipe on it's own is 4 star. The reason i'm rating it a 5 is because of it's versatility. I scaled the measurements down to 15 servings so that i could have a manageable amount. Put it in an empty pickle jar and left it on the countertop for easy use. Since making it i've used it not only as a salad dressing, but also as a marinade for grilled chicken, roasted veggies, and steak (with the addition of soy sauce). The steak was phenominal cooked to medium-well done.

Looking at this recipe I wouldn't guess that it's what Greek dressing is, but it IS... and it's SO  good.  Has a nice kick to it.  As for how I followed the recipe, I estimated everything by eye.  Definitely included a little less vinegar.

I've been making this for a few years after finding it on this site.  It is as excellent as the masses indicate, as written.  For my personal taste I cutback a little on the oregano.  I probably make 4 or 5 pints a year.  There is always some available on my kitchen counter for salads or to use as a marinade for meats or vegetables.

I love this dressing.  I make it on a weekly basis because my household goes through it so fast.  I made it for a birthday party and everyone just loved it.  The only thing I do different is I leave out the salt and add a packet of stevia, just to off set the red wine vinegar.

A fabulous dressing indeed! So flavorful, and reminds of the dressing at my favorite pizzeria! The only thing is that it can be a little tart...so on the next creation, I'll slightly reduce the vinegar (not too much, cause I don't wanna ruin it). But the herbs and seasonings perfectly complement each other. Soooo glad I found this...now I no longer have to waste money buying dressings that go to waste, and I can make my own clean house dressing at home! Win! FYI, I scaled the recipe down to 15 servings, which yields 2 cups, as stated in the video. Next time, I'll reduce the vinegar from 1 cup to a little above 3/4 cup. Enjoy!

I left out the basil and onion powder because I didn't have any and had to substitute balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar because that's what I DID have. Delicious anyway!!! Great, simple ingredients make this dressing light and fresh!

I put this together because I didn't have any salad dressing on hand - it was really good.  I didn't have the mustard but it was still good.  Next time I'll try with the mustard.

Have to agree with Shearone...red wine vinegar was way overpowering for my tastes. Scaled it down to 6 servings as well.  In hindsight, this might make a good marinade for something bland and proteiny like chicken or pork, but too much shock and awe for my garden grown lettuce, tomato and cucumber. In fact, I'll probably use the rest in just this manner. Too bad...my daughter and I love Greek Salad, so I guess my hunt continues for a good dressing.

Whoda thunk? This is so very much more impressive than the ingredients suggest, and my (GreekAmerican) family loves it!  Really.  I love Danielle and I appreciate the suggestions of the others who made changes AFTER trying the original recipe.  April's tomatoes on baguette... delicious!

UPDATE: this was actually really good on a zoodle salad with red bell pepper and black olives.. i let it sit overnight and tried a bit this morning.. i'm so looking forward to lunch! this would probably be a good vegetable marinade for grilling or even on chicken.. glad i tried this again.. ty for the recipe ~~ORIGINAL REVIEW: maybe this is the kind of dressing that needs to sit overnight or something to that effect because i didn't find anything special about it.. don't get me wrong.. i liked the dressing.. but was expecting something more.. maybe it's because i used it on a very simple salad made of lettuce, shredded carrots, and cabbage.. i didn't find the vinegar overpowering like some reviewers stated.. i'd like to try it on something more Mediterranean.. like the kind with olives and feta.. either way.. ty for the recipe.. im eager to see if the flavors meld together overnight and turn this into a 5 star recipe

I loved this recipe, but can you tell me if it's gluten free? I use gluten free Gazebo Room Lite Greek Dressing and it is amazing, but I have to buy it online because it isn't in the grocery stores near me. This is a good substitute, but I've cut way back on my gluten intake, so I'd have to be sure.

Sorry but I did not care for this dressing.  I didn't care for it on the salad and ended up using the remainder as a marinade for chicken and it was okay.

Very fun, sister said it was the best Greek dressing she's ever had. Made a smaller amount (followed AngKN's scaled down measurements) and since I used up the last of my red wine vinegar, I just put it in that bottle and it's pretty.

This is a wonderful recipe and it keeps well. Scaling down was easy.  Used quality balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar.

I don't have to go to the store and overpay for dressing anymore! I used it on my "Greek salad" (cucumbers, onion, kalamata olives, tomato and feta) - and it was truly delicious!  (So good, I licked my plate!)

Note: I didn't have a red wine vinegar, so had to sub balsamic (and mine was some type that was almost like syrup). I couldn't find my garlic powder, so used the same amount roasted minced garlic. I also used the one to one vinegar oil suggested.

Wow, this is really overpowering (vinegar), but just using about half of the normal amount you would put on a salad works just fine.  Good dressing, nothing exceptional though.

Excellent base recipe with the exception that there is too much vinegar called for like others have said. I prefer a 1:2 vinegar to oil ratio myself so I put in 1/3 cup red wine vinegar, 2/3 cup oil, along with a heaping teaspoon of the other stuff with the exception of pepper, just one level teaspoon, and potassium salt, 1/2 to 2/3 tsp of that. 

I originally went to make my own dressings to eliminate the excessive sodium found in store bought dressing and replace it with potassium chloride.  A salad with this much oil makes up my main daily meal on my reduced carb diet combined with healthy protein from eggs, cheese, and the like.

Hokey Smoke, Danielle.  This is a good one for sure.  It was a little too tart for me, so next time - and there WILL be a next time - I'll even the oil and the vinegar. Easy fix.  I made it exactly per recipe, served it with a Greek inspired salad,and both of us loved it.  I had a second salad. Will be good on anything.  Thanks much.

This recipe is just like the spicy and tangy dressing served at Pete's on Bell Blvd. It is my "go to" Greek dressing. I make it exactly as suggested in a smaller serving. I use the food processor to blend and it is always a hit.

Loved it! Scaled back to 4 servings (use the "change servings"). Used a jar with a tight lid to shake it all up. Excellent dressing for a greek salad. We had lamb kabobs and garlic toast with it. Delicious. Will be my keeper for anytime I have a Greek salad.

I needed a last minute Greek salad dressing for Christmas dinner and found this recipe.  I downsized it to 4 servings and WOW!  It was fantastic!  My olive oil had gone rancid, so I used vegetable oil, and I didn't have onion powder so I left that out.  It was still a flavorful dressing that I will use again and again!

This recipe is the BEST!!! I made this for my friends one night for dinner and this was great!!!  Next time just to ensure everything mixes well I will make it in the food processor so it gets a nice blend.  But the flavor is great!

The other reviews for this dressing are so fanatical that the end result is a little anticlimactic. That said, it is a very good, versatile dressing that doesn't require any ingredients you won't already have in your pantry. As it is written, the dressing will be very tart - which I liked. If you're worried about that, just reduce the amount of vinegar so that you're using equal parts vinegar and oil.

I make a Greek pasta salad and had never found quite the right dressing for it...until now.  I cook one box of Barilla bowtie pasta (cook only until al dente), add 1 jar of roughly chopped kalamata olives, grape tomatoes and lots of crumbled up feta cheese.  I prepare a 10 serving recipe of the dressing (following the instructions to a "T").  After the dressing is thoroughly shaken in a well sealed jar, I combine all the ingredients in a large shallow plastic container with a lid, top it with the dressing and marinate overnight (shaking and turning the container a few times).  It's absolutely DELICIOUS!

My family loves this dressing!  I use the measurements given by AngKN & just shake everything together in a Mason jar.  "Greek Night" is a regular rotation at our house, because it is one thing that the whole family enjoys.  We use Sean's Falafel and the Spanikopita recipes from this site, my own greek chicken & a big yummy salad with this dressing!  Easy & inexpensive to make!

This, for me, was a perfect dressing for Greek Salad. The only thing I changed, was to scale down the amount of dressing it made. Still perfect. KC

Oh YUM.  My husband, a self-proclaimed greek salad guru, claimed this was a keeper - the first home-made dressing for which he has said that.  I did a significantly reduced version: 3/4 cup oil, 1 cup red wine vinegar, 2 tsps each basil, oregano and garlic powder...and now that I look at the recipe, I realize that's where I stopped.  Oops!  Well, with those ingredients, it's still fantastic.

Oh my gosh this is good...but it makes A LOT!  Unless you are feeding an army, you might want to scale down the recipe. Also, use a good olive oil as the flavor really shines through.

This dressing IS absolutely perfect on any Greek salad. It compliments the flavor of the kalamata olives and feta cheese. Greate with tomatoes too! The only change I have made is using slightly less vinegar. Other than that, this dressing is awesome!

I loved this and am planning on using it for a rice salad that I make in the spring and summer.  We had it over salads we had for dinner this week, but the wife(me) refrigerated it.  Mistake!  the oil and vinegar didn't have time to blend well enough and of course, my husband was the first to use it.  His words " it is kind of tangy" Really?  It should be with almost 2/3 cup of vinegar on your salad..I said later.. (I scaled the orignal recipe down to 12 servings) and it fits perfectly in a Good Seasons mix yourself bottle!  I love this tangy zesty dressing.  And I also love that I can add other ingredients if I want!  What about some crumbled feta cheese or even some minced onion or garlic flakes next time?  Yum..Yum thanks for a great recipe!

Best dressing I have ever had! Reminds of this cafe in town that has the best salad... Its almost identical! My hubby is a big fan of Greek salad, with the feta and all even though he is kinda picky, and he Loved it! Not a fan of feta myself so just used Romano instead and still taste amazing! Very versatile!

Sooooo good!   Sooooo easy.  I scaled to just four servings, and it tasted fantastic.   Delicious in a regular tossed salad with feta cheese sprinkled on top.   This is a keeper.  No need to ever buy bottled Italian or Greek salad dressing.

I had the ingredients for a Greek Salad at my home and then I realized -- I needed a Greek Salad Dressing to go with it!  I Googled it and this recipe was the first match and boy it is absolutely fabulous!  I had all the ingredients on hand, it was so easy to make!  And my family (even my sons whom can be picky) Absolutely LOVED it!  It's a keeper for sure!

The BEST Greek Dressing Recipe I have tried. I replace about 1/4 of the oil with a little extra white wine vinegar, to lighten it up even more, and it is just fantastic!

This is by far the best Greek dressing I have made and all the ingredients  are likely to be on hand, no special trips to the store.  Lasts a good long time in the fridge and very addicting.

I really enjoyed this.  The combination of ingredients is fantastic and it's all stuff that I have in my pantry.  My only (small) problem with the recipe is that it calls for a bit too much vinegar for my tastes.  I've found that using equal parts olive oil and vinegar works best for me.  This is something I'll be making often.  Thanks for the recipe :)

Pretty good, but not fabulous. I made it exactly as the recipe states (scaled down to 10 servings) and it was waaaay too sour (and I really LOVE vinegar!). I ended up adding enough oil to equal the vinegar, but it still needed some sugar (about 1 T) to make it edible (meaning that it didn't burn my tongue and make me pucker). I also added an additional T of dijon and I still think it needs some work before it's "absolutely fabulous". On the plus side, it looks really nice and doesn't separate immediately. I like the addition of mustard very much. I will use this recipe again, but with quite a few modifications. I may use balsamic vinegar next time and possibly some lemon juice and feta.

I was very skeptical after reading reviews about the tartness of the recipe, so i took the advice of some users and added some sugar to taste.  No other adjustments necessary!  This is the BEST Greek salad dressing I have come across.  Served it atop greens and veggies wand Feta, Kalamata olives on the side, and a nice batch of Chicken Gyros.  I'm olive oil poor now, but so rich by having tested this recipe.  Thank you VERY much!

I have been using AllRecipes for YEARS, and never taken the time to rate a recipe until now. This is FABULOUS!!!  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I just used olive oil, garlic salt (replacing garlic powder and salt), dried oregano, dried basil, pepper, dijon mustard and red wine vinegar. Thank you for sharing!

Very TASTY.  Best Greek Dressing I have come across. Sometimes I use Apple Cider Vinegar in leiu of the Red Wine Vinegar, both tasty.  And fresh herbs also kick it up a notch!  Love it!! Thank you poster!

This is absolutely delicious!! For the person with the separation problem, I am using a plastic shaker/mixer bottle with an insert that looks like a wagon wheel.  tupperware used to sell them, as well as other brands now.  Shaken vigorously, it mixes beautifully and stays that way, even after I sat it down on the counter for a bit.  Serving this tonite for the first time and can't wait for dinner!

5 stars.....better than any homemade dressing I've ever made....tastes EXACTLY like u'd get in a restaurant. And trust me....I'm picky, picky, picky! The only thing I changed (because of what I had in my pantry) was: pomegranate infused red wine vinegar, onion flakes, Xtra virgin olive oil, and inglehoffer HOT dijon mustard.  I put all in blender and drizzled olive oil to emulsify....I will be making this weekly! Thank you for the best recipe on this site!

The flavour was outstanding, my only problem is figuring out how to keep it together. The dressing seperates immediately after shaking.. The flavour was worth it though, so I'll keep playing with it and try to make it stay together at least a few seconds :-)

Needs more oil to make it thick, and a bit of sugar to help with the tartness.

This was sooooo tasty. I used this as the dressing on the Greek Orzo Salad from this site. I pared down the servings to 10 and had enough left over for a couple of dinner salads. I did not use all the salt, just a generous shake. Thanks for the great recipe.

I used this dressing on a greek pasta salad with black olives, green peppers, onion, halved grape tomatoes and diced cucumbers. The tart peppery dressing was PERFECT! Often pasta will soak up the dressing and lose flavor, this one didn't . It held up beautifully.

I believe that there may be a typo in the recipe as in most vinegarettes the oil to vinegar ratio is 3-1 three parts oil to 1 part vinegar. or 2 cups vinegar. HTH

This is just about the only salad dressing my husband and I ever use.  It is also great to use in pasta salad.  I scaled it down to 10 servings.  My daughter loves to measure out the ingredients...she's 8.  It's that easy!

I have been making this dressing all week.  Scaled it down to 10 servings and used equal parts vinegar and oil.  Made it for a salad that contained julienned tri-color peppers, seeded cucumber, kalamata olives, red onion and feta cheese and everyone loved it.  Made the salad again but this time I added bow-tie pasta and it was fabulous.  With or w/o pasta this salad dressing rocks!  It's my new favorite!!!

Greek? Really!? Maybe this is more Italian than Greek since it comes from a Pizzeria. There's a place called Old Towne Grill and Seafood in Charleston, SC. that has a really good house dressing and I was looking for something similar to that. It is a Greek restaurant and this dressing tastes nothing like their house dressing.  Too much of a vinegar taste for me. I followed some of the advice of others and did equal parts of vinegar and olive oil.

After seeing all the rave reviews I decided to try this dressing. It was good, but not as crazy awesome as everyone makes it out to be. It seemed a little salty to me. I also agree with another reviewer that you should add some sugar. I will have to do that next time. I ate this with a salad with feta, red onion, and tomatoes. I think this dressing would be great on a pasta salad or even a snadwich.

This was really excellent. I scaled it way down (to 10 servings) and it still turned out great. I didn't have any red wine vinegar on hand, so I used some white champagne vinegar and the result was still delicious. I soaked the feta cheese cubes ahead of time, and they were really nice. My girlfriend thought the dressing was a bit aggressive, so I might put a little less pepper and reduce the vinegar slightly next time...but I loved it exactly as is!

I only rated this a 4 because I changed it a little bit. I used the same amount of vinegar as olive oil, and added sugar (1 tsp per 10 serving size). Because of the change in the amount of vinegar, it was a bit thick- but delicious! Five stars after the changes.

it was a little too tart for my family.  I had to add sugar to sweeten it up a tad.  next time I would add less vinegar.  I quartered it because I didn't need a gallon.  4 tsp garlic powder, oregano, basil, 12 oz oil, 2c vinegar (would do 1 1/2 c next time, 1 tbsp pepper salt, onion powder and Dijon.  But it is amazingly tasty!!!

Five stars all the way! Delicious, not too strong, and tastes just like the dressing my Uncle has at his Greek restaurant. Opa! I did however use equal amounts of oil/vinegar to balance the tang. Awesome job!

This is so good. It tastes like the sandwich dressing at our local deli. I added some red pepper flakes to mine and blended it in the food processor for an emulsion.

Lived up to all the hype-my new go to salad dressing recipe!  I made a much, much smaller batch to see how it tasted but next time will be making a much bigger one.  I added a pinch of sugar (I scaled this to 15 servings) and cut back on the salt just a touch but other than that followed the recipe exactly.

wow. wow. wow. I really enjoyed this. Made it up quick to dress up a simple mixed leaf salad with red bell peppers, used white wine vinegar instead of red, and it just blew my mind! The BF reacted the same as me: wow. wow. wow. Can't wait to make it with the red wine dressing. I am sure it is amazing!

This is pretty good......although a little too "tart".  Not sure if too much mustard or too much vinegar.  And I love vinegar.  I added about another 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/2 t. of sugar to tone it down. (and 1/2 t. of dill)  Maybe after being in the refrigerator for a few days it will mellow.  Thanks   ....it's a great base!

Got any other recipes from your restaraunt because just like everyone else I thought this was fantastic! Im not much of a salad person but I found myself thinking about one all day because of this dressing. I put ingredients in a blender and slowly added olive oil at end. Turned out great.

I scaled it down to 4 and used regular grocery red wine vinegar, but added in a bit of good quality balsamic.  I am not a fan of salads or dressings, but thought it was light and very doable.  Will definitely be using it over store bought.

The name says it--absolutely fabulous!  Tonight I made a salad with romain, cucumbers, radishes, lots of yellow and red bell peppers.  Didn't want bottled dressing so I found this, reduced the servings to 20 and made it EXACTLY by the recipe--no changes at all.  My family loved it and it's going to be a repeat later this week...this time with some feta cheese and good bread.    Thanks!!

So yummy.  Scaled the recipe for 4 servings and it was so easy.  I served this with Hummus III and grilled chicken.  I'll definitely make this again.

Exceptional!!!  I can imagine that if people didn't have olive oil around, they could use canola oil and it would taste fine that way also.  The only thing I different was I used Italian Seasoning in place of the oregano for an extra kick.  I also didn't have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar and it was still excellent!  Great recipe.

This is remarkably like "Newman's Own" original salad dressing.  It was way too vinegary for us but with some small adjustments (a little water, more oil and a bit of sugar) it is now very workable in a variety of salads.

Great basis but a little too tart without some adjustments.  I dropped the wine vinegar to equal proportions with the olive oil, and added a little sugar to taste in order to balance the flavors.  That being done, it was perfect.

It was good, but just a bit too tangy for me with the vinegar. I even had to cut the vinegar to more than half because I ran out. Adding feta cheese to your salad definitely does help. Very easy to make and it keeps well.

Oooopa! and Sagapo - as a friend. This is a fantastic dressing. I scaled it to 10 servings so it would be family size for one meal. Worked perfectly. Thanks for sharing. Please post more recipes from the restaurant - perhaps chicken?

Really great, versatile dressing.  I usually squeeze half a lemon over the salad (either greens or pasta) before adding the dressing and it brightens it up nicely!  Definite keeper!

Fabulous recipe!! This dressing is now an absolute regular in our home! I too used equal parts of oil and vinegar; I scaled down the recipe to 12. I served this at two separate dinner parties and everyone raved about this dressing. I'd give it 10 stars! Update - This is our new "Go To Dressing" in our home! So yummy!

This is super.  I didn't have any dried onion, so substituted fress minced Walla Walla sweet onions.  I also added the juice from 1 lemon.  I suppose I just can't leave any recipe 'as is'!

SUPER quick to blend up...I make a batch, and in a separate sealable container, throw the dry ingredients in for another time. Amazing taste..I made a Greek Pasta salad with it for a family gathering, and everyone raved!

very good, the second time I made it I was out of red wine vinegar so I used cider vinegar instead, I also added 1/2 tsp of red wine. and a few dashes of basalmic vinegar. The addition of the basalmic and cider vinegars as well as the red wine added a slight sweetness that I really enjoyed.

This is amazing!  I have been craving a good greek dressing since I have been to some greek restaurants lately and this really hit the spot!  I used the recommendation of using the same amount of vinegar and oil.  I will definitely be keeping a bottle of this in my fridge, it is absolutely delicious!

Excellent dressing!  I scaled way back and this turned out fantastic...similar to another 'Classic' dressing I often make from one of my cookbooks.  Yummy flavour and simple to whip up.  Used this on Party-Size Greek Couscous Salad from this site.  So good!

This one is an absolute keeper! I did use a little less vinegar than called for just to cut the tartness. I use it for green salads and it does very well in pasta salads. I despise store bought dressing because it is usually too sweet and never tastes as good as fresh made dressing (except for Newman's Own dressings). This one is the one I will always go back to!

Used this to dress shrimp and veggies in a gyro sandwich and it worked out great. I think i may have used more oil than vinegar.. just as a preference..

Wow!  Better (and cheaper) than any bottled dressing, for sure.  SUPER EASY, I made it in my Magic Bullet.  I left out the basil bc I didn't have any, and it was still really good.  (but I bet it could use it so I will get it for next time)

This dressing is really great and really easy.  I was scared about the amount of vinegar but it is nothing to worry about.  My husband eats a salad every day now.  We are so glad we found a dressing alternative to our usual ceaser.

Let's be honest - who needs 120 servings of salad dressing? Nevertheless, once the serving size was adjusted, the result was great!  Very nice, zippy dressing.

Great flavor.  Took other review suggestions and cut the recipe down.  Used half vinegar and half olive oil and it was still a little too tart so added some sugar to the mix.  Next time I will reduce the vinegar even more.  Much better than bottled dressing!

This dressing is delicous and very versatile. I scale the recipe to 10 servings and keep a jar in my pantry just about all the time. I use it with tuna instead of mayo and on just about any sandwich or salad that calls for a vinaigrette. I like that it doesn't have a ridiculous amount of oil in relation to the vinegar. I don't change a thing ingredientwise.

Think if I had a more current Red Wine Vinegar this recipe would have been less tart. I know now.  Also added Anchovy Paste.

Scaled this recipe down to 6 servings. It was a pretty good vinaigrette that I would make again because of its ease of preparation. Tasted good, but not absolutely fabulous. Thanks!

Seemed to be quite light in taste.  Perhaps due to the red wine vinegar which seemed also quite light.  Will try again with a better red wine vinegar

I used this to make orzo pasta salad for Greek night and we loved it. To make with 1 cup orzo I reduced the serving size to 10 and followed exactly except used half the vinegar just because I don't like too much vinegar.  Only needed a little dressing on the orzo, to which I added sliced olives and feta cheese. The olives made the dish because otherwise the oregano was too overpowering and the olives balanced it out.  Served immediately. Hubby asked to take leftovers for a snack at work and he NEVER takes leftovers.

I made this a few weeks ago and i finally tried it last night. Before serving i put it in with some crumbled feta. This was good but very very tangy.

This was very good! Surprisingly, it really does stay mixed (at least through dinner) when it's made in the blender. Use it on sub sandwiches (ham & Swiss, pastrami & provolone, etc.)like our local pizza place does!

This is quite good, but not mind blowing.  I did use fresh garlic and a mix of red and white wine vinegar, because that's what I had.  The oil/vinegar proportion was fine for me as written.

I might be singing to the choir here with all these 5 star reviews, but this is a really great salad dressing.  I scaled it back to 10 servings, used equal amounts of oil and vinegar plus fresh herbs (instead of dried) and added juice from half a lemon, fresh mint, a half T. of white sugar.  These additions made it more like the dressing from our favorite local Mediterranean restaurant.  So good it makes me crave salad and I'm not usually a salad girl!  Thanks so much for sharing.

Fabulous!!! Totally loved it! I recycled the red wine vinegar bottle by putting some of the dressing into it to give my aunt for her birthday. (I had to add a little extra olive oil...and then when i came back here to write a review i see that many of us did. When will i learn to read the reviews first?!) Def worthy of 5 stars!!

This dressing is great!  Very tangy but flavorful and I like that.  Means I don't have to use very much on my salad which helps keep the calories down.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Tasts just like my favorite Greek restaurant! Finally, I have the recipe...  I used the dressing over lettuce, kalamata olives, feta and souvlaki-style chicken on the grill. Delish!

I don't personally like pasta salad, so I relied on the opinions of some big eaters who visit my house on regular occasions.I poured the dressing over noodles,green,red and orange and yellow peppers, red onion,feta cheese and turkey pepperoni and it was a big hit.This is a keeper for upcoming catering jobs.  Thanks

**UPDATE** This is still awesome, however be sure to always follow the recipe because if you stray, it's not the same. Original: Talk about AWESOME! This is so simple but the most amazing dressing! Seriously, I'd rather have a salad at home then at the fancy italian restaurants with this recipe. I was simply amazed at how good this was. THANK YOU!!!

Really good. I am definitely done buying salad dressing. I agree with some other people that it was too vinegar-y (for my taste). I had cut it down to just 2 servings, so for my second batch I used equal parts olive oil and vinegar.

Very good!  I scaled this back to 4 servings, and used a lavendar infused red wine vin from San Juan Island since that's what I had.  Added a packet of Splenda since I like sweeter vinegar dressings, and this is very good.  May try it with some white balsamic next time.

I made this dressing and let it sit overnight so all of the flavors could settle.  It was great!!!!  I actually used fresh onion and garlic and added a little super fine sugar because it was a little too much vinegar taste to me.  Overall, it was very good and have made it twice since last week.  Had my parents over for the inauguration and they loved it too!

This is an easy, delicious dressing. I was looking for a dressing that tasted like a greek dressing in a restaurant.  I do agree that it was a bit vinegar-y, and I like vinegar.  Will use more olive oil next time. Also, I used fresh garlic and didn't have onion powder so I used a little onion salt instead.

Couldnt decide on giving this a 3 or 4. It was eye squinting/lip puckering tart.It was just way to vinegar-y for my taste. I scaled it down to 15 and to be honest i think most of it will go to waste. Maybe I just prefer creamy dressings.I had gone to a greek restraunt and loved their dressing and thought i would try to make my own. This was not it. Sorry.

I did not find anything special about this dressing in comparison to the one I personally whip up for Greek salads. I usually just throw in evoo + vinegar (white or red wine) + oregano. Not going to bother with preparing this again. Ok, looking at some of the comments I may try this with fresh garlic instead of powdered in the future and I will update my review then.

This dressing gets my kids to each lots of veggies every night.  I don't add the mustard due to an allergy and use about a third of the red vinegar.  It works great for a kabob marinade.

I love this recipe.  A favorite. But, I do scale down the vinegar for my taste.  I have always made Italian dressing ... 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar & that's what I did with this recipe.  Less vinegar or sour taste. But that's my taste!!  Otherwise YUM!!!!

Delicious!  I may never buy dressing from the store again, I love the bold flavor.  I scaled it WAY down and made it in my magic bullet, using the emulsifying trick described by another reviewer.  I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar and it turned out wonderful.

This is a great oil and vinegar dressing.Full of flavour and you can play with the spices to suit your liking.I love the recipe as is and actually let it sit 24 hours before using. With crumbled feta it is awesome.

I've never made Greek/House Dressing before and I don't recall ever having it. I used this dressing for the Greek Chicken Pasta off Allrecipes to substitute the original dressing. I hope its good because I've made the Greek Chicken Pasta before and it seemed bland to me.

Super Yummy & so easy to make!  This is a slight deviation from my Mom's non-creamy ceaser salad dressing & the whole family loves it.  The red-wine vinegar adds a great zip & we top the salad with fresh squeezed lemon and include romaine lettuce with the typical greek salad ingredients.  Absolutely recommend this!

I took some liberty with this recipe, but it still was awesome. Instead of the suggested spices, I used thyme and marjoram. I poured the last bit of the balsamic vinegar I had into a measuring cup (a couple of tablespoons) then filled it the rest of the way with apple cider vinegar. My version probably isn't too Greek, but it tasted great, nonetheless. I love that this recipe doesn't have to be refrigerated. I noticed most of the reviewers who did not like this said they didn't like the tang,so I would agree with other posters to add equal amounts olive oil and vinegar -- but personally I love that "zap" on your tongue when you're eating a potentially boring salad! Next time I'll make sure to have the suggested ingredients on hand so I can make as directed. But good to know you can improvise and still turn out a fabulous dressing. I'd say this recipe is a good "template" for all kinds of flavors -- just keep the proportions the same and experiment!

If you like zippy and zesty, you will love this dressing!  I am SO THANKFUL for the little "servings" box and orange "calculate" tool under the picture and above the ingredients!  Math - ugh!!!  Was discouraged trying to scale it down until I discovered how EASY allrecipes.com has made it for us!  Followed LISAKP71's helpful hint and used the blender, scaling the "servings" down to 10, which filled a quart jar to a little more than half.  Chopped up a bunch of different veggies and served them raw, allowing each to use the amount of dressing they wanted.  Even the ones that made a "pucker" face kept eating it!  We now live in China and have a very small frig, so it is convenient that it can be kept at room temperature!  Thanks for a dressing with pizazzzz!

Awesome dressing. EXACTLY what I was looking for. My only modification was that I used minced garlic and minced onion instead of the powders. Tastes amazing. Even my husband liked it!

I love tangy salad dressings and this definitely has some zip.  I made a greek salad with feta and olives so I omitted the salt in the recipe.  The first time I made it, I forgot the dijon so I added it later and it tastes much better with the dijon.  I can't wait to use this as a steak marinade or even use this dressing in the Grilled Zucchini II recipe from this website.  A keeper!

So easy to make. I followed the recipe and it is my favorite homeade dressing. It tastes better the next day, and each day after that. Try making in advance so the flavors have time to develop.

This IS "absolutely fabulous", just what I've been searching for.  The dressing is very tangy and great on a salad with kalamata olives, cucumbers, tomatoes and feta.  I cut the servings down to 10 and it was about the same amount you would get if you bought bottled dressing at the grocery store.

We LOVE this recipe! We used to be store-bought only dressing people, but after this recipe never again! I used balsamic vinaigrette instead of red wine vinegar, didn't add onion powder (didn't have any the first time I made it and it's delicious without it), and used regular mustard. It's so easy to make and tastes delicious. This is our main salad dressing from now on. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars even though I changed it a little after reading others suggestions!  I cut back on the vinegar {same part vingear as oil) I also did 3/4 part red wine vinegar and 1/4 part balsmatic vinegar! 
The rest of the ingredients I followed recipe!  My friend who eats his favorite greek salad at a local restaurant said he liked this dressing better!!!  I never have ate many greek salads but I will be now!!  This dressing is awesome!!

Wow.  This made a great salad of leaf lettuce, ripe-from-the-garden tomatoes, black olives, and salad peppers.  I did change the vinegar/oil ratio to equal parts and added some white sugar.  It was fabulous.

I love greek food and this dressing makes for a great salad.  I scaled it down to eight servings and made it in my italian dressing carafe.  I used honey dijon mustard as it's what had on hand.  I dumped all the dry ingredients in first followed by the oil and vinegar.  A good shake was all that was needed. Even my 12 month old loved it.  I'll def be keeping this on hand...

I made this recipe exactly as is and it was perfect.  I served the salad with another recipe on this side "chili-lime chicken kabobs" and the flavors were great together.  Will definitely be making this a regular in our house.

I wasn’t very fond of this salad dressing. It had way too much “POW!!” for my taste. If you make this dressing, my advice would be to use it sparingly.

Made as stated.  Very good.  May cut the vinegar down a bit next time or try red wine and balsamic mix.  Update:  I liked the flavour better after it sat for a few hours with the vegetables.  Would keep same amount of vinegar, but will try with mix just to test out the flavour.

This is the best salad dressing ever.  My husband and I both love it and make it at least once a week.  It's nearly impossible to go back to eating store bought dressing.

Wow!! What a fantastic dressing!  I scaled it down to 5 servings, and added it to the "Greek Orzo Salad" recipe on this site.  Loved it!  I did reduce the vinegar to 1/8 cup instead of 1/3 (just a personal preference).  Thanks for the recipe!

I love Greek salad and this is the prefect dressing to top it with. I used equal parts oil and vinegar. I also used half red wine vinegar and half balsamic vinegar. If it too acidic just add a little sugar. This is also excellent for pasta salad.

Didn't change a thing on this except I made 10 servings worth.  Used on the Mediterranean Potato Salad from this site instead of the Italian dressing it called for and I'm sure it's awesome for salads and marinades as well.  I loved the fact that I made everything in my kitchen to make it already.

Really great!  And, MUCH better than my favorite local restaurant's dressing. I love this since, because everyone's tastes are different, you can tweak it to your own personal preference. I know that next time, I'll try fresh basil and a pinch of sugar and maybe some red pepper flakes. I can't wait to use it as a marinade.  It was nice to scale it down to 10 servings so that I could see if I would like it; obviously, this one's getting made again!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

This is awesome!  I used extra garlic powder in place of the onion powder, and white wine vinegar instead of red.  I think the red wine vinegar would give a better flavor, but it's still excellent with the white.

Perfect, perfect, perfect. Once it is combined with the feta and rest of the salad, this is the perfect Greek salad dressing. It is a good idea to mix the dressing with the salad veggies (except the lettuce, if using it) about an hour or 2 ahead of time.  Then at the last minute, toss in the lettuce or put the lettuce on the bottom of a platter and pour veggies over for a great presentation.

Very Very Good. I used the same amount of oil to vinegar as suggested & found the vinegar over powering. I added more Dijon mustard & it balanced everything out perfectly. Used on Greek wraps with feta potatoes & even good with just bread for dipping. Will definitely make again!

This was good, but wasn't quite as good as I thought it would be based on reviews.  It's not quite what I was looking for.  I felt it needed more salt.

I found this to be an AWESOME marinade, but did not really care for it as a dressing. As many others have said, I would put equal amounts oil and vinegar....as is written the vinegar was overpowering.

the dressing is delicious and definitely cut down on the vinegar.  start out with only 3/4cup vinegar to 1 cup olive oil then add more as you wish.  on the day that i made the dressing i didnt actually think it was that fabulous but after letting it sit for 3 days its now really addicting.  this is best served over spinach than lettuce.

This is excellent dressing!  I scaled it down to 10 servings and used some to marinade chicken breasts.  I will definitely make this often.

Great stuff, and I don't like Greek dressing. I used fresh spices, etc. I've already eaten more salad in the last few days then I did all of last month!

Very good dressing.  I'm sure it will be even better after it has sat overnight.  I had it on a greek salad I made tonight and it complimented the feta cheese and olives in the salad quite well.

Very good, and will probably be better tomorrow!  As mentioned by many other reviewers, the vinegar is strong, but I'm going to taste this dressing again tomorrow before making any mods to the oil/vinegar ratio.  I am looking forward to trying this again with the mods suggested by other reviewers:  fresh garlic; different types of vinegar.

This was good, but not something I would make as written over and over.  I like the fact that it is sugar free, but I think something added to cut the sharpness of it would be helpful.

I've been using this recipe for a few years now and it is ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!  I use this dressing on romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, red onions, greek olives, feta cheese, and homemade garlic croutons.  I've become known for this salad amoung friends and family!

This is my second time making this recipe.  It is amazing.  It is a little high on calories but the amount that one serving could cover makes up for it.  I would not change one thing about this recipe.  Last time I made it for 10 and used it on my veggies this time I made it for 25 and the smell again when I made it was amazing. Wow and thank you for posting it

This a bit tart.  But just too much of a vinegar taste for us.  Also, the herbs didn't really shine through.  I will make again but lower the vinegar amount as well as increase the herbs.

Have to admit that at first we weren't sure we liked this but it grows on ya! I think after it wilted the greens a bit and saturated everything the flavor just wows you. Very good. I made it as is and would keep making it that way. Most dressings are sweet (which I like too) but this is a wonderful option minus the sweetness. Thanks!

Made this for dinner to seve with Greek chicken - fast to make and adds a tasty bite to a salad (with greens, strawberry tomatoes, kalamata olives and crumbled feta). I scaled it to 4 servings to try the recipe - but will make a larger amount next time. Thanks for sharing Danielle,

I love this recipe! I love that it doesn't call for sugar, so it fits into my low-carb diet, it's not a thick dressing so you don't use as much as you do of store-bought dressings, and I love the vinegar kick. I'm from Chicago, and though this is nothing like the greek dressings I enjoyed there, still a very good recipe. I make it scaled down to 12.

I thought this was FANTASTIC!  My husband is a big fan of balsalmic dressing and he said this by far beats any balsalmic he has had.  I did use fresh basil in mine and about another tsp of evoo for the consistency I wanted...but it is a definite do again!

Took me by surprise because it looks to be a heavy dressing but turns out to be fairly light.   Good taste, will make it as one of the salad regulars.

DH thought this was great, I thought it could use some tweaking. Next time I might add a little sugar as some of the reviews had said. It is a good dressing if your having lasagna, pizza etc.

I didn't have any dijon mustard but it was still great.  Like a few other reviewers I preferred the overall taste after I added a small amount of white sugar.  I will definitely be using this whenever I make a greek salad.  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful.  Thanks Danielle.  I did cut it down to 25 servings.  I didn't need that much salad dressing for just 2 of us.   I gave a bottle to my parent and they loved it too.  I will make this great recipe again.  Our first two grandchildren have a Greek father so we have loved Greek salads for a long time.

Yum!  This was great.  I used fresh basil and oregano and just a pinch of sugar. I made it to go in the Chicken Pasta-Shannon Style recipe from this site.  Now I want to make it again to try on salad.  Thanks!

This is really good and adaptable. I did not have red wine vinegar so I used 2/3 white and 1/3 balsamic. I did not have onion powder so I used some minced garlic. This is really good and I can't wait to make it the right way!

This was okay.  The flavor was not spectacular or especially unique.  I didn't like how the oil separated and hardened when refrigerated.  I had to heat it briefly in order to shake and serve.

Absolutely fabulous!  The key is to follow directions exactly to the measurements.  (I condensed mine down to 10 servings) But I used half itilian white wine vinegar and half red wine vinegar because for some reason I don't like the flavor as well with all red wine.  I did add just a little sugar and WOW! As good as the greek restaurants!  Don't forget your feta cheese, it completes the salad. YUM!

I am in love with salad again! thanks!!! I hate all bottled dressings and was super stoked to find this recipe.  I have been making it every day, but I just realized that lately I have been forgotting to put in the dijon. I love it just the same, in fact it might be cutting out some of the spiciness of it, so I think I prefer it without the dijon. I scale it down so I have it for a few salads worth and I just leave it on the counter.

This is a really good dressing and marinade. I add a little bit of lemon juice and some water to break up the acidity. Becuase I add the lemon juice, I store it in the fridge.

Excellent dressing and easy to make.  Served on a green salad with feta crumbles to accompany "Souvlaki" and "Tzatziki Sauce I" from this site.  A great dinner I will make again.

It keeps forever even when it's been in the fridge - just take it out a few hours before and it recombines.  Just the greek taste I was looking for.  Restaurant quality.

I decided to listen to the other reviews and added half balsamic vinegar with the red wine vinegar and it wasn't to my liking.  I also scaled the recipe way down, which could have scewed the results.  I will try it again though.  Thanks for the great recipe.

The recipe tasted a little too "vinegary" for my taste.  Next time I would use less vinegar and maybe more garlic powder.

Good standby recipe.       Great for pasta salad, too.

Cut this recipe to 4 servings because I needed 1/2c of dressing for Chicken Pasta-Shannon Style.  I took the advice of the reviewers and cut the vinegar to 3T, and it was still a bit tangy.  Liked all the herbs and the dijon.

This was good and very quick and easy to make. Not anything that received any rave reviews from the family, but was good for a last minute greek salad for dinner.

Others in the house liked this more than I did, but I thought it was just okay.

I tried this 3 times exactly as written and it is just too vinegary for us. I'll have to find a different greek dressing.
