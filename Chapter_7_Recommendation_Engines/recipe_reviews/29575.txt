This recipe is AWESOME!! For the base, I used two 32oz containers of low-sodium chicken broth, clam juice (look for it in the international foods aisle or near the tomato sauce), one 28oz container of crushed tomatoes, and the sauteed garlic and green pepper (I substituted the green onions with onion powder). Use the spices liberally and to your taste (you can't really measure herbs) but don't add salt until you've tasted it. Clam juice is REALLY salty. I let the base simmer for about 30 minutes, then I added one pound of shrimp, two containers of lump crab meat, and a pound of tilapia. I cooked it for another 5 or 10 minutes, then shut it off. You can even remove the soup from the heat, then add the seafood. The heat from the mixture will cook it. It's so good by itself, I didn't add the rice. It's great as is!

Yummy!!  My family is Cajun (from Louisiana), so I've been exposed to a ton of Cajun food in my day.  I'm by no means an "expert", but from my experience, this is fantastic!!  I have been taught that anytime you're using green bell pepper, you might as well toss in some celery, so I added about 1/4 cup of that.  I also used 3 cloves garlic (not so much cuz it's a cajun thing to do, as it is i LOVE garlic!) and added a 10 oz. can of clams and an 8 oz can of oysters.  Also upped the amount of rice to 1 cup.  I've already eaten 2 servings and contemplating another as we speak...will definitley make again!!  :)  (Oh, may up the butter to 2 T next time though, cuz my garlic was burning before the rest of the veggies were done)

Soooo yummy.  I also doubled the recipe.  Living in Tokyo, I couldn't find clam juice in the supermarket, so I improvised.  I bought big prawns with heads attached. I took the heads off the prawns and boiled them till the water turned an orange color (from the row).   I then strained it to collect the soup, which is very flavorful because of the the prawn row in it.  I used this instead of water and clam juice.  I also added scallops and clams, so it ended up being a very hearty soup loaded with seafood.  Served to friends at lunch and everybody got seconds.

This is a WONDERFUL soup - different (at least for me), flavorful, hearty and delicious. I served this as a first course for hubs, myself and a dinner guest, and the 6-serving recipe was cleaned up to the last drop! I followed the recipe exactly and would do so again. We were all pleased and satisified, although just a little full before the main course was served!

i took advice and added (mind you recipe was scaled to 10 servings) 1 cup celery, 10 oz clams, 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes, 1 tspn cajun seasoning, 1 tsp hellfire sauce, and doubled the red pepper flakes...the end result was not only the best soup i have ever made, but perhaps the best soup i have ever tasted...as a tough rater this is the first 5-star i have given

I would give this soup 6 stars if I could.  It's very easy to make with common ingredients and is about as tasty as a soup can be.  I made two substitutions with items I had on hand:  Used a 28 oz. can (3 1/2 cups)of diced tomatoes in place of the 3 cups of vegetable juice to make a thicker consistency (left out the 1/2 cup of water).  Also substituted Tarragon when I discovered I was out of Thyme.  What a great and interesting flavor!  I love that this is a very low fat soup, too.  Good job, Eddie!

Very good basic recipe.  I added a shallot, one stick of celery, a couple of shakes of white pepper, and doubled the garlic.  It didn't have quite enough spice for me, so I added Tabasco at the table.

This recipe was AWESOME!!! My family loved it! My oldest daughter didnt even pick out the "green stuff"! The only changes I made to the recipe were to add more garlic, celery and a can of Rotel tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe Eddie. This South Lou-zee-ana family will enjoy it for years to come.

This was very good and I will make this again.   The only things I changed was to use low sodium V8 and I used chicken broth in place of clam juice.   I also tossed in about a cup of sliced okra.

I think this recipe is a great base, but lacking as written. Where are the veggies? I added a bunch of okra and corn, and that filled it out niceley. I also did 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 v8. Will make again with my mods. THANKS

Y-U-M!  DOUBLE THE RECIPE!  Thanks Big Ed for an AWESOME recipe.  Readers, I made quite a few recommendations, but not because the soup needed it - it was for personal preference only.  This is a 5* soup as it stands.  I added 1/2 chopped red pepper (which I happened to have on hand), AT LEAST 2 T. red pepper flakes, 2 tilapia filets, 4 chopped green onions, at least 1 T. Old Bay Seasoning, Seafood Seasoning was added to my tilapia filets, 3 stalks of celery, 1 T. garlic and I also used SPICY V8 juice.  And, lots of Tobasco!  We like things HOT, and this did not disappoint with my changes. I also pumped up the volume on all spices.  I typically don't like when people modify recipes - but we did it to satisfy our particular taste. Ed's soup is a FANTASTIC recipe - we just customized it for us.

Went down an absolute storm with Mr P this evening - he almost finished the whole pot by himself. Mostly followed recipe exactly, but added celery, minced clams with juice and doubled red pepper flakes. Very, very good indeed. Thank you.

Lip smacking good, fast and easy. A versatile recipe easily modified to fit your taste but easily shines as is. Improvised w/ 2, 4 ounce cans of minced clams as store was out of clam juice {added juice per recipe & added clams w/ shrimp}. Used low sodium V8 {wish I had used low sodium Spicy Hot V8}, and omitted salt. Substituted beef broth for the water and used 2 bunches of green onions & 5 bay leaves rather than 1. We added extra ingredients: (i) 4, celery stalks, chopped, (ii) 3, jalapeño peppers {wanted to use habanero peppers but not available at store}, and (iii) 6, large sea scallops, quartered. We left out the rice this go round. Even after ramping up the spices and spiking the heat, we still added hot pepper sauce as suggested by Big Ed but that’s because we like things HOT. Other reviewers mentioned adding spicy chorizo sausage and more vegetables, and that’s another variation we may go with in the future. This soup’s flavor is even better the next day. Thanks MAGICWAD for sharing this tasty recipe.

I made this soup last night because I'd forgotten to take something out of the freezer for dinner. I had a bag of shrimp that I easily defrosted in some cool water and so I was set to go as I had all the other ingredients in the pantry/fridge! I added some smokies (any smoked sausage would work) to give it the smoky flavour I think Cajun food needs. I also used the single serving sized V8 juice cans and put in three to stretch the meal. I think the idea of some celery is a good one and will put some in the next time!

This soup is fabulous and so quick and easy to make!  I did, however, add a bit too much hot pepper sauce and it was very spicy.  I would say 4 or 5 dashes would be plenty and let people season it after that as they please.  Also, I omitted the salt altogether as there is plenty in the tomato and clam juices.  Great recipe, Eddie!

I prepared this recipe while I was working behind a bar and served it at happy hour. I doubled the recipe but added a pound of scallops instead of extra scrimp. It was a big hit. Mostly men in the bar.

Really delicious.  Did not add salt, clam juice and veggie juice has enough.  Served with cornbread muffins.

I was a little skeptical about a soup with V8 and clam juice, but it turned out great! I added more spices and hot sauce to cover up some of the fishy taste the shrimp added. Also threw in half a bag of frozen okra to make an even hartier soup. I was full after two bowls! Served it up with pieces of a fresh loaf of crusty Italian bread. BTW, it took me forever to find the clam juice. I found it with the canned tuna and sardines.

Made this over the weekend--very good but I changed a few things, so I gave it 4 stars. Added Ro-Tel tomatoes and used Clamato juice. Also, when cooking anything Cajun you have to use the trinity: bell peppers, onions and celery (not in recipe). I also cooked shrimp separately and used the stock as liquid for the soup. I would suggest cooking the rice separately too and adding the soup to it per serving. I cooked the rice in the soup and it turned pink—still good, just a bit weird looking. The Ro-Tel tomatoes and shrimp boil (in the stock) made it plenty spicy. Yum!

I made this last weekend when we had friends over, it went over quite well with everyone. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled it, added canned diced tomatoes and added some large scallops. Since we live in Japan good seafood is easy to find and I am always looking for great recipes like this one! Thanks "Big Ed"!

I made this as directed except for 2 things. I added a can of lump crab meat, which was excellent! Also, I went to my pantry to add the rice, and found out I didn't have any. I already had the soup going, so I ended up substituting the rice with orzo. Turned out just fine and my husband was happy because he doesn't like rice very much. To me, this soup tastes a lot like jambalaya. I will definitely make again!

Very tasty! I made a couple of substitions, not for taste but rather because of what we had on hand. I used a yellow pepper, regular onion and basmati rice instead of the recommended. I also threw in a handful of frozen corn to add some extra veggies. I made the soup base the night before and added the rice and shrimp after heating the soup back up. I think leaving it overnight really let the flavours deepen. Very good, I will definitely make it again!

Fantastic, I only made one change (added snow crab legs) and it was a seriously good, although messy, dinner.  My hubby, dad and kids can't wait till I make this again.  Tkx for the post!!

This is fabulous!  I used pasillo peppers instead of green bell peppers which gave it a great flavor.  I didn't think V-8 juice would be good but it made all the difference.

I made this according to the recipe except I doubled everything.  It was delicious. This is one of those great basic recipes that you can play with and still get excellent results.  Adding sausage would be great, as would chicken, or other seafood.  If I had celery on hand I would throw that in next time. Don't be afraid to experiment with this one.

So very tasty and easy to throw together! I routinely keep chopped red/green pepper pieces and chopped onion in zip top freezer bags in my freezer for last minute additions to recipes on busy nights. I made it with shrimp the first time around (I used 1 large can of V-8 to make 2 different batches of soup. I froze the unused portion after making the first batch...worked like a charm for the 2nd batch of soup) and used sliced smoked kielbasa and some home smoked turkey breast chunks for the second batch. We loved both versions! Thanks so much!

This was really good. I couldn't find clam juice anywhere, so I used minced clams. I did think it tasted better the 2nd day than the 1st.

We don't eat Cajun (spicey) but loved my toned-down version.  I didn't have a bell pepper but can see where it would be good.  I added two cans of clams.  Yummy.

We love this soup! We use broth instead of water, add a couple of stalks of celery and onion instead of green onion, and add a can or two of clams in their juices instead of the clam juice. You can make it as spicy as you want and as liquidy (or not) as you want. Absolutely delicious-and healthy, too!

This was awesome, the only thing a did different was used 4 cups of Clamato Juice instead of the 3 cups of Vegetable juice plus 1 cup of clam juice. I followed the rest of the spices exactly and everyone loved it.

Pretty good.... My hubby's exact words (I quote): "If you had made more, I would eat this tomorrow too." I have to disagree. I like my tomato seafood soup recipe much better. It calls for cheaper, more common pantry ingredients such as jarred tomato sauce, salsa and diced tomatoes. This is not bad by any means. It's just not as good as my recipe and calls for unusual ingredients I don't normally keep on hand (i.e. tomato-veggie cocktail, clam juice). All in all, this was decent, but somewhat lacking without the addition of a few items to add some much needed "bulk." I ended up doubling the broth / veggies / spices and adding 2 cubed tilapia filets, 8 oz. lump crabmeat, a can of (drained) chopped clams and 1/2 lb. shrimp (all tossed in at the last 5 minutes). Thanks anyways, MAGICWAD! :-)

Even the most discerning food critics in my house loved this soup.  Left out the water and used a can of diced tomatoes.  Added crab meat and didn't need to.  Great soup for a cold rainy N.W. evening.

Thank you, Ed!  My husband is also an Ed, and we thought it would be fun to try this soup just on the name alone.  I sure am glad we did.

I've made it as is and it was a wonderful soup for a cold day.  The shrimp were perfectly sweet and tender, and the spices were perfect for opening up the sinuses. Watch the amount of salt and heat because this soup is bold and thick.  

I couldn't decide between this recipe and the one for Killer Shrimp.  We were lucky to live near NoHo Killer Shrimp restaurant for a few years.  I like the veggies in this one way better, but I adore the herb, butter, and wine in the Killer recipe, too.

The next time, I wanted more broth and less mush. Used converted rice to avoid porridge.  Added a can more of low sodium chicken broth, white wine for the water, and up to a cup more chopped vegetables (classic Cajun onion, celery, bell pepper, carrot mix) and a pinch of rosemary, basil, and oregano to cut the saltiness of clam juice.

Loved this!  Added bite sized tilapia with the shrimp and right before serving added the juice of a lime and some fresh cilantro.  It was good without but the lime added some freshness and I just like cilantro with anything hot.

This soup is easy to make and healthy.  I would consider adding tomato soup or tomato sauce to thicken it a little.  This would be a great soup to serve before the main course.

I have reviewed this before. But it is so good I had to review it again!!!! Last time I made this it was New Year's, this time I made it for Superbowl. Again it was a huge hit. I added  1/2 of spanish chorizos sliced really thin and garlic paste instead of garlic cloves. Always remeber this recipe has to be tripled or quad. if you have a crowd. I am also cooking this dish for a ladies retreat. This recipe has endless possibliities. My son had to help me cook it as I was injured and he remarked WOW is this really this easy?

I made it for my parents when they came to visit and they absolutely loved it. Both of them had seconds. I thought it was just okay. It was also very easy to make so I'll probably make it for guests even if I don't make it again for myself. I also thought the recipe might be nice with a bit more rice.

This was great!  I used the substitutions from others and it was a hit!  Instead of veg juice, I used tomatoes, and I doubled the recipe using both scallops and shrimp.  Everyone loved it, thanks Ed.

This is a GREAT & EASY recipe that you can whip up in 30 minutes for a quick, delicious lunch! I have a recipe for seafood Cajun Jambalaya that my family has been making for years...it takes about 1.5 hrs to make from roux to finish. This is an awesome alternative! The flavors could use a little more development since it's not a roux base so if I make it again, I'll add some finely chopped andouille sausage to give it a much needed smoky punch. I have given it 5 STARS because it's SO EASY TO MAKE and turns out wonderfully just as the recipe calls for.

I love this recipe. It is very tasty and even better on day two, (if it lasts that long). Like several others suggest, I add equal parts (1/2 cup) of chopped onions, green peppers and celery, and plenty of Louisiana Hot Sauce.  I've made this many times think it ranks in the top five of my favorite soups and stews.

I used organic brown rice which made the cooking time much longer for my soup and I also used fresh herbs from my garden.  The flavors were a bit bland for my taste but my husband and son enjoyed it.

This was awesome. Very tasty, and more filling than I expected.  I added a little more vegetable juice than called for, doubled the garlic, and spiced individual servings with Louisiana hot sauce.

YUM!  This was excellent and good for you too!  I only had plain tomato juice so that is what I used.  I also added a bit of Old Bay, but I bet if I had used V-8, it wouldn't have even needed that.  I will find out next time.  Thanks for such a great recipe!  Okay, this time I made the soup with V-8.  Honestly, I couldn't taste THAT much of a difference.  Although, I will admit, it didn't need any Old Bay this way.  Next time, I will probably make it with whatever's on sale -  V-8 or tomato juice.  Thanks again!

This was great. I had to modify it a bit because the recipe was a bit smaller than I expected. I doubled everything except the clam juice and shrimp plus I added 1 pound of smoked sausage. I also used V8 spicy. The whole office loved it! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This soup was excellent.  My 10 year old absolutely loved it.  Problem was there was not enough.  Next time I would double the recipe.  This is difinitely not 6 servings...at least not in our house.

This is a great recipe.  I made it as is, but while we ate Boyfriend and I brainstormed on possible adaptations/additions.  I said celery would be a great addition, he wanted extra hot sauce.  Very good soup to eat on a cold autumn day when your heater is broken (I speak from experience.)

I changed this a little - used light butter and added extra at the end to mellow out the acidity. I omitted rice, but put in lots of sliced celery with the bell pepper and onion (I used yellow onion). For fish, I threw in 1/4 lb raw small scallops & 1/4 lb raw tilapia chopped, and simmered for 5 minutes. Then I added 1/2 pound each of pre-cooked mussels and small shrimp, brought back to a simmer, and turned off heat. Let it rest for 10 minutes... and it was fabulous! Served w/ crusty whole-wheat french bread.

This is a very good and easy recipe.  The first time I made this following the recipe exactly.  The next time I made it I added 1-14.5oz can of diced tomatoes with the juice.  Just delicious!  Thanks, Eddie.

We loved this one.  I've made it twice, once with regular V8 juice and the other time with the hot & spicy V8.  Definitely use the hot & spicy!  Make sure to not overcook the shrimp because this can affect the overall flavor, too.

It was good, but next time I'll add some chopped celery to the mix, maybe some chopped onions, and definitely some Cajun seasoning.  I think that will make it five stars.

This recipe was very easy to make and the end result was a great tasting meal!  I doubled the ammount of the red pepper flakes, because I like my food a little spicier.  Everyone in the house loved this recipe...Thanks for sharing!

This was really good.  I would definitely make this again.I added a can of diced tomatoes, more red pepper used white onion instead of green, and added extra rice (and extra water because the rice soaked it up).

I fixed this for lunch during a corporate meeting my husband had at our home.  We had 2 guys from the New England area here.  They both raved about this soup and wanted the recipe.  I  doubled the recipe.  I also added a can of Lump crab meat and and extra 1/2c. of rice, using brown rice instead of white.  I did have to add some extra vegtable juice (Red Gold) because it thickened after letting it sit over night (made the night before) then added the shrimp just before serving.  Thanks for making me a hit at lunch!

Very good, but I just felt it was missing a little something.  I used the crushed tomatoes instead of the juice and water, and I added corn and string beans.  I might add just one more vegetable next time to make it heartier.  But, overall it was good - a nice alternative.

This hit the spot on a cold, rainy Sunday in NH.  Notihing needs to be added to Big Ed's description.  The rating is for the recipe as written (wish most others would do the same).  I will make it again; tweaks will be to start with the Trinity, green onions will be saved for the garnish.  I will season the shrimp with Cajun seasoning and add a dash of Worcestershire ...all personal tastes

Easy peasy! My hubs loved this and ate the whole thing in 2 days. After reading reviews, I added the big can of diced tomatoes,  half cup water, omited clam juice but threw in a can of chopped clams, added celery,  and doubled the spices.  When it was finished added a few shakes of hot sauce. Now it looked more like a side dish then a soup so I added a bit more water but it was just a hearty soup, we didn't wan't to ruin it.  Yummm!

Great recipe! Easy to follow but I did make some changes. I added a shallot, 2 celery stocks, a jalapeño and doubled the garlic. I also added Italian sausage and cooked it in a can of diced tomatoes and two cans of clams.  I changed out the rice with quinoa.  So...  I made a lot of changes but the recipe is so easy to tweak! It tasted amazing! Will definitely make again!

This is my first time making a shrimp soup. This is very simple to prepare. I used what I had in the house- frozen grn peppers, and substituted frozen white onion (about 1/8 c)instead of the green onions. I used chicken stock in place of the clam juice. Also used brown rice and let it simmer for about 35 min instead of 15 minutes.  Other than that, I used the remaining ingredients and it turned out very, very tasty. One day I will make this the way it's suppose to be made!

Good!  I used left over shrimp scampi and left over rice. I substituted chicken broth and used 'spicy' V-* juice. I added cilantro.  Next time I would add corn and green beans.  I was in a hurry and made it in 15 minutes!

I'll admit that I was not planning on loving this soup but it went well with what I was making so I went for it. WOW! What a nice surprise. I made as written and it was loaded with flavor. If I had to change one thing, I think I would add celery next time for some extra crunch and color but not necessary for sure. This one is a keeper!

Yes. I love it!  Substituted diced tomatoes for the juice & brown rice for the white.

Whoa! This soup is incredible! Well, to be fair, I made a few modifications, but bear with me. I too did the tomato juice and chicken broth thing. I also added three sticks of diced celery and some white onion. Instead of shrimp, I used a bag of frozen langostino from Trader Joes, and added in some frozen sliced okra, (it helps to thicken things up, too!) about 8 ounces worth. I also added about a teaspoon of chili paste, a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce, and 1 tablespoon of cajun seasoning. I can NOT believe how great this tastes! I'm so sad that I have no one to share it with, as M has a picky palate (strictly a "meat and potatoes" kind of guy). Oh well, more for me!! This will be in my regular rotation once the cold Chicago winter begins. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe best I could.  Had a can of chopped clams instead of clam juice - but most everything else was exactly in the recipe.  Mine came out thicker than the lead photo - but I like it like that!  I will make this again - and try to add some more veggies to get it even healthier.  I only wish I had doubled it to get even more leftovers!!!

Nice flavor, quick, and simple, can't get any better than that. The only suggestion I would make is to double the recipe because I could see myself eating some more the next day.

I don't love this at all. I thought it was super bland, and I followed the directions completely. I felt that the V8 completely overwhelmed any other flavor - just tasted like tomato broth with rice and shrimp. I will not be making this again.

I made this as written except that I left out the butter and used only 1/2 lb of shrimp (that was all I had).  It tasted good and was easy to make, but nothing out of the ordinary.

I don't want to rate because I made a couple of changes that may have been the problem, but I couldn't post without givin it something. This was OK, but something was lacking. I took some reviewers suggestions and used V8 juice and added crab meat with the shrimp. The crab meat did nothing for the soup so NEVER use that. I wonder if the clam juice was the problem - if anyone has any thoughts please post. I think I'll try it again with something besides clam juice and without crab meat.

A healthy meal my picky husband actually liked.  I added 1/2 tablespoon Lawry's season salt and extra basil instead of regular salt and it almost tastes like a chowder we have at our favorite seafood restaurant :) I almost didn't have any leftovers! I will definitely be making this again. Can't wait to try it with some of the other variations mentioned by others too!

YUMMY! This was exactly what I hoped it would be. Like some other reviewers, I also added extra seafood, white fish and clams. Since my fish was frozen, I added it a few minutes before the shrimp. I couldn't find clam juice so I used the juice from a can of baby clams, then added the clams later with the shrimp. I also didnt have vegetable cocktail (would have bought some when I got the clams but I thought I had a can at home), so I used tomato soup! Worked great.

Good start for a recipe, but I added some chicken broth to thin out the tomato juice and added diced tomatos, celery and shallots.  I didn't use the full amount of clam juice as I'm not fond of clams, and makes it too fishy.  Delicious!  Next time, I will try adding some okra.

This is a great recipe we all loved it, i also added potatoes, bay scallops and crab meat and used Spicy Hot V8 juice to give it a little more kick, next time i will add more V8 due to adding the potatoes.

Very good!  The tomato was a little overpowering, so I added some gluten-free chicken bouillon to it.  Next time, I think I'll add a little bit of cream and make it a bisque.  I used tilapia, clams, shrimp, and crab in it and used jasmine rice.  Even my picky husband ate it (the kids are never a problem...it's the husband who is picky).

Yum, so good!  I love that it's quick and easy to prepare too.  I used low sodium tomato vegetable juice and that worked well because we don't like a lot of salt.  I made it as written but next time will increase the spices just a bit.  Thanks for sharing!

This was great!  I did have to put my own spin on it like all good cooks.  I added a large can of dice tomatoes,some crab meat & clames in own juice too. Also added a tsp of oldbay.  Living in the midwest with cold winters, this will be added to our soup rotation.

I agree with all the 'could give it six stars' reviews here.  Simple, delicious and a welcome break from the rich buttery gravy and sugar laden foods we indulge in so much this time of year.  Excellent flavor.  We served the hot sauce along side so we could each regulate the spicy heat.  Can't wait to have it again!

This was very quick and easy to make.  I think I let it simmer too long because all the liquid absorbed into the rice and it really wasn't a soup anymore but more of a gumbo type dish.  I couldn't find clam juice so I bought a can of minced clams in clam juice and this worked great.  I did add celery and 3 cloves of garlic.  Will make again.

Wow....this is EASY EASY EASY to make and tastes great!!!! My hubby told me after I made it that this was his new favorite soup! I really kicked up the heat with some extra red pepper flakes and the hot sauce I use is CRAZY hot. I was short on tomato juice since I need it for a different recipe and didn't want to go to the store so I used 1 can of tomato soup (condensed) and 1.5 cups of V8. Instead of using the 1/2 cup of water, I used chicken broth and added a touch extra to help dilute down the soup a bit. I used pre-cooked shrimp so I only threw them in at the last minute to heat through and I also didn't have clam juice on hand which I usually do and didn't realize this until after I had started to make the soup. I used fish sauce in place of it but next time I will be sure to go for the clam juice for that seafood flavor! The only thing I don't agree with is the serving size...it states this makes 6 servings, but they are not "american" servings....it made us 3 good sized bowls.

This is pretty good.  It was a bit bland so I added some Old bay, Lawry's, in addition to some cajun seasoning to spice it up a bit.  Nice and quick!

Absolutely no complaints about this recipe...it's now one of my favorite winter soups by far.  The only warning I'd like to give is that I don't think this soup would serve 6 as the recipe states unless it were just a starter soup.  As a main dish, we only got 4 healthy cereal bowls full scraping the pot clean - and trust me - there weren't any leftovers!

Very good.  The shrimp is so golden sweet!  I, too, added celery, clams, yellow onion, doubled the red pepper flakes, and used extra V8.  My mom needs to watch her diet, so I chose the low sodium V8 instead of the extra spicy or clamato cocktails that contain MSG and lots of salt.

Excellent!! I added diced celery for some texture, seasoned with Old Bay, and added some clams. It is better to add cooked rice before serving, otherwise you end up with rice porridge.  I also added some cilantro before serving, and it was perfect!!

Excellent soup! Even my kids liked it. I might put less rice next time. After the soup sat for a while it became very thick. But tasted great, quick and easy. I will make this again.

This was really good.  My house is full of males who dont think soup for supper will be enough but with some sweet cornbread on the side nobody went to bed hungry. I tripled the recipe and added extra shrimp and rice.  I will for sure make this again.

Yummy! I added about 6 cups of V-8 juice because I was making a large pot of soup and chicken broth instead of clam juice.  I also added celery.  Very yummy! Good to play around with maybe add okra or a can of rotel like others suggested! Thanks so much..always a plus when hubby likes it!

This is a really great recipe with a lot of good ideas from other reviewers!  I chose to use a 28oz can of diced tomatoes instead of the juice and water, added a can of clams, 1/4 cup of green pepper and 1 cup of rice instead of the half cup.  I wish I would've just added the half cup though cause it ended up being more like a jambalya instead of soup!  Still a great recipe and will for sure make again.

I made this for Sunday dinner for my husband, son, and myself...son had the misfortune of not being home when it was ready to eat...husband and I ate the entire pot of soup!  This was my first time eating "Shrimp Soup."  What a fantastic recipe, this is definitely one you have to try.  We like things really spicy, so I did substitute V-8 Spicy Hot juice for the tomato-vegetable juice, and I cooked the shrimp separately before adding to the soup, otherwise followed recipe exactly.  My husband loved this (so did I), son will have to wait till next time when I double the recipe.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This dish was absolutely delicious!  It was spicy just the way I like it and it's even better and spicier the next day.  I did however, use white onions instead of green onions and put in more rice to make it thicker but it was great!!!!

I loved it the next day!! Definitly a day ahead dish. I went with the other reviews and added the can of diced tomatoes which made it great. Also, opted for shrimp stock instead of clam juice, and white onion instead of green. Other than the few changes it was great...:) Thanks ED!! PS My Hubby loved it too..

I made it according to the recipe just doubled the serving size. Yes,  I've been cooking for many years and I know how to double the recipe.   It was a bland and awful watery mess.  An hour of tweaking later, using suggestions from others here, then additional tweaking, it was barely edible. I cannot believe all who rated this so good.

Really excellent. My whole family loved this, especially my wife. I added a can of baby clams to the mix, which assured there would be seafood in every bite. The broth alone would make for a great soup.

Great soup.  Was really not expecting this to be so delicious. One suggestion from a old shrimp boat captain friend of mine back in the '70's.  Do not add the salt till you add the shrimp!  Same goes for boiling shrimp (add salt last one minute of boiling)  Salt to early and the shrimp can get mushy.  Salt at the end and the shrimp will snap with flavor.

I also used seafood stock in place of the water.

This is by far my favourite Allrecipes recipe (and I use a ton of them).  If I could give more than five stars, I would.  Only change - I use cauliflower rice - it's healthier, fewer calories and doesn't absorb all the liquid in subsequent days so it is better for leftovers or freezing.

I made it almost exactly stated, except I subbed a store bought pre-diced mirepoix for the veggies. Fast, easy, and really tasty! In future, I think I'll  make it with a light roux.

I did this in my Instant Pot. Sautéed veggies in IP, added all remaining ingredients except shrimp. cooked on Soup function, quick release of pressure, added shrimp and a couple of minutes on Sauté. Served with crusty French bread, a block of cheese, and fruit for dessert. Perfect weeknight meal!

Great soup! Although I did change a few things as well. I added a bit of smoked paprika, half tomato juice to half chicken broth (I think next time I'll do half tomato juice and half water since it was quite salty), half and half red and green peppers,  1 left over chicken breast cut smallish, a can of creamed corn, siracha and a tbsp. of sugar to cut the acidity.  Result, fantastic!

Loooove this soup. I didn't find clam juice at my grocery market but found fish stock and it came out great! I also added celery for additional Cajun flavor. Excellent!

This was excellent. I only made a couple of adjustments. I had no clam juice so used chicken broth (8oz). Then I just added some extra stuff: canned green beans, drained can of diced tomatoes, and 3/4 can of corn. I used veggie juice because it's what I had. I also added Cajun seasoning. It was very tasty! A keeper for sure. Will make again. This recipe I'm sure is great as written. But what makes it really great is that it's a perfect base for adding what suits your taste! Thanks!

The recipe was quick and simple and the ingredients that I had to purchase were inexpensive. Next time I will have to try a different rice because the kind I had increased the cooking time.

I doubled the recipe.  
I had no tomato-vegetable juice. Instead I replaced it with (2) 15oz cans of clam sauce and 4cups of chicken broth.  2 lbs large shrimp. 2 tbs Hot Old Bay,  1 tb scotch bonnet hot sauce and the seasonings mention above for taste.  All other steps stayed the same but quantities doubled.
Results was pretty tasty!!!

It was a good base but needs some additions.   Possibly veggies, maybe clams, scallops, mussels in addition to the shrimp.   This was good but you need to add to this.. it's  just a base.

The best part of this recipe is that it is gluten free!!!!
This was a big hit for my husband and me.  We love Cajun dishes and this will be added to our favorites list for sure.  Basically, I doubled the recipe.  I added a jalapeno  pepper with the green peppers,  added an extra half of a yellow onion, 1 cup okra, 1 medium zucchini, green beans from my garden,  substituted chicken broth for the water, and added a 10 oz. can of  clams as well as a 6.5 oz can., since I did not have any clam juice.  I omitted the salt, cooked it 25 minutes longer to make sure the brown rice was done, and used 2 # of shrimp, since that was the amount in the package.  If I had more veggies, I would have added that as well.  It was a yummy soup.  I don't think there is any way of it not turning out unless it was overly  spiced.  I did add a bit of Cholula  sauce to my bowl, and my husband added a bit of Tobasco.  We served it with Krusteaz Gluten Free cornbread.  I can't wait  to have it again for tomorrow's lunch.

One of my favorites.  I make a big batch of this a couple times a year.  Just made another tonight.  I use low sodium V8, low sodium spicy hot V8 is even better.  Skip the water and add more juice.  Don't use regular V8 since it has several days worth of salt in it.  Perhaps that's why the water was in the recipe.

I added a little more rice than called for but otherwise followed this exactly. I put in a generous amount of hot sauce because I love dishes with a lot of heat. This dish dash absolutely wonderful and perfectly seasoned.

Very easy and delicious! I couldn't find V8 or clam juice at the store, so I got a can of diced tomatoes and a small can of clams, blended together 2 cups worth and added 2 cups of vegetable broth to it. Perfectly successful replacement.

Really really good! I was nervous about adding that much clam juice but it doesn't taste fishy at all. In the future, I would add more rice than it calls for and also add chicken and sausage. It called for just a little red pepper flakes but I kinda went crazy with them.

This recipe was easy and delivered on flavor; it would be an easy fix for a weeknight.  We LOVE spicy food, so the only modifications we made were to up the spice level: used spicy V8 juice, added a squirt of sriracha, and doubled the red pepper flakes.

I was skeptical of a soup based on V8- but this was awesome! My hubby even ate two bowls, and he doesn't like shrimp. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added 1 tsp of Cajun seasoning.

Absolutely delicious! I suggest to everyone, add more seafood other than shrimp. I haven't yet, but I can taste the possibilities! The base for this soup tastes almost identical to one of my favorite seafood spots. Will be making this again!

I've never really had a lot of shrimp soups, but this was amazing. I also added 3 stalks of chopped celery and half a red bell to compliment the half of green bell. I love shrimp, so I put in almost 2Lbs.

This was excellent and will be made again.  I made a few modes based on personal preference and other suggestions.  I left out the bell pepper (pers pref), use low sodium V8, and added a 10 oz can baby clams and 8 oz can oysters.  I would leave the oysters out next time as I didn't think their texture worked great, but otherwise I followed recipe as is and my husband loved it!

Delicious! I was a little nervous about adding any hot sauce because I don't tolerate very hot things well, but after trying it before and after the hot sauce, I would say it is a must flavor-wise.

I used Clamato which is a tomato and clam juice drink used in Mexican cooking.  You can find it right with the other tomato juices.  I added some carrots, diced potatoes, and a can of Rotel. I also added about a tsp of sugar to balance out the tomato juice.  This soup turned out wonderful.

This recipe was FANTASTIC!!! I made it as a starter for a nice anniversary dinner with a Cajun theme, and my fiance LOVED it!! I followed the recipe as written and it was fantastic, and sooooo easy to make!! BTW, for anyone looking for clam juice (took me forever to find it), it's in the international foods isle. I will make this again and again!!

Flavorful, easy, healthy recipe.  I didn't have the spices so I used spicy V8 and it still came out great.

I thought this was between okay and good.  Maybe my expectations were already aimed too high based on the rating and reviews.  Easy enough to make but ultimately.. for me, lacked something.

awesome. made for Mardi Gras today...used brown rice instead of white, which resulted in a much longer cook time. I also doubled (tripled?) the recipe...and used a combination of V8, canned diced tomatoes, leftover chicken broth, and water. We like spicy cajun food, so I added crawfish boil seasoning (found in louisiana) for extra heat, and doctored to taste using garlic & onion powder. we used a 1 lb bag large frozen shrimp added in at the end. tasty!

I made the recipe as stated, with a couple additions.  I added a can of diced tomatoes w/garlic & onions, used spicy V-8 and added a bag of frozen roasted corn (from Trader Joe's).  People fought over containers of the leftovers...

This was great!!!  I made a couple small changes for health reasons: low sodium V8, no added salt.  I also accidently forgot to add the extra water.  I'm not a fan of V8 so I didn't think I would like this, but it's excellent!  Very healthy too.  Thank you!

I've never made gumbo before but I used this recipe and added chicken, sausage, celery and okra and "Bam!"  I went ahead and cooked the rice first and I only had a couple of cups of tomatoe juice so I made up the rest of the liquid with chicken broth and I dropped in a couple of veg. boullion cubes.  You rock Ed!

This recipe is excellent! It has become a staple in our household. Its good just how it is. But we also like to add a can of corn and spicy chorizo sausage which makes it a little more hearty!

This recipe was really good.  My kids ate it up even though it was spicy.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly.  It will make for a great winter regular in my house.  I am planning on adding in some sausage next time.

Excellent taste.  I substituted a packet of dehydrated baby shrimp instead of the clam juice to flavor the broth.  Just wrap the dried shrimp in cheesecloth and remove for serving.  Also, I substituted chicken broth for water to make it richer.

Really good soup, but I made a few changes to mine. I omitted the green pepper and added Old Bay cajun seasoning and 3 cloves of garlic and lots of Louisiana brand hot sauce! Came out really good, especially when you add crusty french bread for dipping!

"you go big ed!!!!" This recipe is easy fun AND tasty! We took the advice of others and added cellery,and onion (red). Also used clamato juice because that was all the store had. No complaints with this dish.  Will definately make it again.

Fabulous!  As with another reviewer, I also used Clamato juice in place of the V8 and it worked out amazing.  I will try cooking the rice seperately next time however as it did become a little thick the next day.  Highly recommended however!

With such great reviews I thought this was going to be a winner, however it is not.  Maybe I did something wrong, both my husband and I didn't care for it.

My husband liked this but I overdid it on the red pepper flakes.  I added brown rice instead of white and made it pretty thick.  He said it tasted like gumboe without chicken and sausage.  I'll definitely make it again with the extra meat.  :)

Excellent, just made this for dinner.  I would only change 2 things, no salt added and add another 1/2 cup of rice.  The flavor of the rest of it was fabulous!

If it was up to me I would give this recipe 2 stars; but I gave it 4 because my husband loved it.  I think it was my fault it didn't turn out.  By the time we were done eating we were actually sweating....I put to much hot sauce in. (ha ha)

This recipe was excellent!  My husband loved it!  Very foolproof, and each person can spice it to their liking with hot pepper sauce.

This was very yummy! reminded me of the south.  I did do some additions as others recommended, and I seem to always add to recipes anyway for my tastes... 3/4 c bell pepper, 3/4 c celery, 1/3 c green onions, 2T chopped garlic, 3 1/2 c low sodium V8, 1/2 t thyme, 1/2 t basil, 1/2 t pepper flakes, 2 bay leaves, 1 t cajun seasoning, 3/4 c rice and 1 lb shrimp.  I wanted it a little bit more hearty of a soup for dinner. It was very delicious and will be making it again!

This has a very nice base. I couldn't find tomato-vegetable juice, so I used a mix of spicy V8 juice and some canned diced tomatoes. Our supermarket doesn't carry good uncooked shrimp, so I also had to resort to the cooked variety. To be honest, I think the base would have been better WITHOUT the shrimp. Next time, I'm going to try clams or mussels instead.
Thank you for the great recipe.

Deicious flavors and so easy.  Enjoyed by all.  In our opinions, it was spicy enough without the hot sauce.

Very easy and very tasty. I used a can of diced tomatoes and, though it wasn't bad, it just seemed out of place in the recipe. I'll try something different next time.
