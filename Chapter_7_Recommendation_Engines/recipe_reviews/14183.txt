Fabulous indeed. A shame it's the farthest thing from dietetic... I don't like garbanzo beans so I replaced them with a can of white lima beans. Delicious.

Sorry to be the "black sheep" so to speak...but I wasn't crazy about this dish. I love beans but just didn't enjoy them cooked this way. The sugar was very overwhelming and I didn't like the combination of beans.  Some were soft and others were tough in texture.  I got confused while I was chewing.  I did eat a bowl...just becasue they are soooo healthy.  But one word of advice...plan on sleeping ALONE after you've eaten this ;)

My husband just loves this dish-we are vegetarians so I use 'veggie' bacon and a bit of canola oil instead of pork. I saute about 1/2 of a thinly slided onion with the 'bacon'. We eat the leftovers cold with rolls for lunch the next day. Thank you Jodi T. for this great recipe!

Very tasty! I think it also tastes better after it chills a day, the flavors blend more. Also good cold.

I personally don't like bean salads, but my hubby does.  I found this recipe and it sounded like something he would like, so I made it for him.  He really liked it, although he thought it would be better cold.  Also, there was so much left that he reheated it the next night and I think he liked it better the 2nd time around!! Definitely worth a try!

This one was very popular and I had to share the recipe.  Though I had to use less sugar and less vinegar it apparently still turned out well and is a keeper.

I made this for supper last night when unexpected company came for supper.  Just went to the cupboard and grabbed the different cans of beans out.  I used turkey bacon and then added some bacon drippings for the flavor.  WONDERFUL!!!!!

What's nice about this bean salad is that it is served hot.  This plus the bacon makes this dish a real treat.

This is Jodi T. the original submitter of this recipe.  I have since started using Balsamic vinegar to make this and it literally flies out of the bowl.  I usually serve it at a buffet in a crockpot.  I have to make a double batch.  GREAT RECIPE!

My husband is a vegetarian so I've also made this without the bacon.  It is just as delicious either way.

The recipe submitter posted a review and said she started using balsamic vinegar, so I used half white vinegar and half balsamic and enjoyed the tang that the balsamic brings to this.  For whatever reason, I like things less "sweet" these days, so if I made any change, I'd cut back the sugar a little, but that's a personal taste preference.  I think this is as much a side dish as a salad, and the bacon flavor is the STAR.  I love bean salads and bean side dishes, and this is one of the best I've had in a long time.  This is a winner Jodi T.

Took to 4th of July Party. It was gone. I changed bacon to 1 lb of ground sausage. My daughter bought the beans and bought the mixed salad beans in can.  Other than that we followed rest of recipe and it was well liked.

Pretty tasty! I cut the sugar down to 2T + 1 donk stevia. I also cut the vinegar down to 1/2 cup. That was the perfect amount for us :)

This is the best 5-bean salad I've made. Friends love it, too. It's a real hit at parties.
