AWESOME!  We are keeping it simple this Christmas and are using Roasted Turkey Breast from Honey Baked Ham Co.  Because I will not have pan drippings from a turkey, I needed a gravy recipe that didn't use drippings.  I followed the following tips:  1. I used Swanson's canned chicken broth (3, 14oz. cans equal 5 cups).  One of the cans I used Roasted Garlic chicken broth.  2.  I increased the flour by 2 Tablespoons, and added 2 Tablespoons of Corn Starch.  3.  I omitted the salt (and I like heavy salt).   There's enough saltiness with the broth.   Thanks JMOR777 for a terrific gravy recipe.  Merry Christmas everyone!

If you have very flavorful stock/drippings from your turkey this gravy is wonderful! So easy and reliable.  I used the  Homestyle Turkey the Michigander way from this site to roast my turkey and it provides great tasting and plentiful stock.  I would not add the salt unless you are using low sodium soup.  This gravy makes a great base for turkey stew or pot pie to use up those left overs.

This gravy was great!  We used it on Thanksgiving with turkey and again on Christmas with ham.  For the ham gravy we replaced turkey stock with ham juices and used cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken soup.  It was great again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

GREAT AND EASY! Here's what  used/did, as I didn't have exactly the same ingredients: I browned the turkey neck and giblets in a sauce pot and added 5 cups of ckn broth, brought to a boil & took out the neck & giblets. I added a can of cream of ckn with herbs soup because that's what I had, and I really think it added a little something extra that made it that much better. I then added some garlic powder, onion powder, lots of fresh ground pepper, and some ground savory (herb). I added 1/4 cup of flour to 1 cup of warmed milk - I did that because I thought the 1/3 was a bit much, and I was right - 1/4 was more than enough. I slowly poured it into the gravy while whisking and it thickened up immediately. Because it was so thick (it wasn't paste or anything, but it was definitely more creamy than a gravy), I added tons of pan drippings to the finished gravy, which not only thinned it out a tiny bit, but added A TON of flavor! I did NOT add any salt - you really don't need it (and I LOVE salty food). This gravy was SO ridiculously easy and SO delicious... I'll be making this a regular staple when  make turkey or chicken. PS - this gravy is NOT enough for 28 people/servings. It makes a LOT of gravy, but if your family is anything like mine, then this is enough for about 2 dozen people. Again, just delicious!

Gravy turned out great and was easier then expected. Instead of mixing the milk with the flour i added all incredients at once and had no problems with lumps. I used 3 cups of drippings from the Michigander recipe and 2 cups of chicken broth.

This was very good and easy.  However, one downside for me is that for “turkey stock” I had to buy a large quantify of turkey stock concentrate to make it from.  
It may take me to the year 2020 to use up the rest of the concentrate. But then again, this may be just a local problem.

I've never been able to make gravy very well.  This gravy turned out just perfect.  It wasn't a pain in the butt to follow the directions and didn't take a lot of time to do.  I used cornstarch, instead of flour, and it thickened up while still on the burner.  My husband loved the flavor and I loved that and how easy it was to make.

I am the submitter of this recipe and I just wanted to share a few pointers for making this gravy.  I don't stuff my turkey just so that I will have lots of juices from the turkey to make my gravy.  I fill the cavity of the turkey with chicken broth, and if it is a 20+ pound bird, I will pour in as much as 32 ounces of chicken broth.  When the turkey is done roasting some 4 hours later, I pour off all of the broth, which is A LOT, and I use this broth to make gravy and to pour over my dressing.  Adjust the flour and milk to thicken, adding more if you like a thicker gravy.  Also, if I have brined the turkey, I do not add salt.  A brined turkey gives wonderful broth, and the gravy is delicious.  Hope this helps with some of the issues people are having.

I'm not sure what I may have did wrong but this gravy had no color, even a bit greenish! Taste was good, finally thickened with added cornstarch, not with standing as recipe suggusted.

This was good, but not as flavorful as I had hoped. I agree with another reviewer in that the color isn't very good. I added just a bit of Kitchen Bouquet, a few drops. That helped somewhat.

I made as directed minus poultry seasoning, salt and garlic powder (I roast my turkey with garlic).  Add the flour to cold milk to avoid lumps, and pour straight into hot broth / soup mixture.  Tasty. Only add salt if you plan to roast your turkey without salt.

My mom has been making gravy this way for as long as I can remember. But...she uses cream of mushroom. I wouldn't do it any other way.

It probably would have helped if JMOR777 explained how to come up with 5 cups of turkey stock. For my stock I usually cook up all the contents that come inside the turkey (neck, liver, gizzards, etc.) with a quart or more of water, adding chicken boullion, celery, onion, carrots & parsley. It's okay but I would love to know if there is a more flavorful way to make turkey stock.

This a great tasting recipe!! The only things I did different is used chicken broth...plain and garlic roasted and I added some onion flakes and parsely. I doubled the recipe so I did add a little more of the spices called for according to my taste and cut down on the season salt. Yummers!!!

I am new to making gravy and this was excellent! It makes a ton though. I could have easily halved it and still had leftovers, but that's okay! I am looking forward to using the leftovers for turkey pot pie! I made turkey stock by browning the neck and giblets with onion in butter, then added 4 cans of chicken broth and some thyme and simmered for 2 hours. Then I strained it and added the drippings to make 5 cups.

This gravy is so good that my mother-in-law turns green because it's better than hers!  After the first year I made it, it gets mentioned and requested by several people every year for Christmas dinner.  I don't think I'd be allowed to host xmas dinner without it now. I do use more flour or add a tablespoon of cornstarch so it thickens better. And I use Old Bay in place of the poultry seasoning.

Very good and very yummy and super easy.  Will definitely make again.  I wanted to make ahead of time though and couldn't find Turkey Stock in the store so I had to use Chicken and then just added some of the juices from the turkey after so we weren't waiting.  Got great reviews from family!

I liked that this recipe was so easy to make and it did have a good flavor.  However, I found the end result a bit too thin for my liking;  I didn't have enough time to wait for it to reduce. I think I'll stick to my old-fashioned way of making gravy, but the canned soup might make a nice addition.

I will never search for or make another gravy recipe!  When I found out that I was having Thanksgiving this year my first thought was, 'how can I keep this simple?'.  Of course buying gravy already made was on my list until I found this recipe! It sounded simple and I like to keep things homemade when I can.  Well, this was a good call because everyone raved about it.  My kids (21 and 15) who have never tried gravy...LOVED IT.  For the Turkey, I used the recipe from this site Turkey the Michigander Way and used the drippings/broth right from the pan for the 5 cups of Turkey stock (and there was plenty).  I also used Olde Bay Seasoning instead of poultry seasoning (which is pretty much the same with some added spices).  Be careful with the salt because the soup is already salty and so is the broth.  In fact, next time I would probably leave the salt out of the recipe all together.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

This is okay but it's not turkey gray. Thanks to sailshonan I will not be makling this gray for Thanksgiving. I like traditional, so, I'll be using drippings from the turkey, seasonings and thickening with flour

This is a good basic idea especially when you want to stretch the gravy. I used this for a roast chicken last night but I don't use the flour/milk method. I prefer to make a roux with the drippings and flour. Comes out smooth every time. I'll be making chicken and dumplings with the leftovers and I'm happy to say that I've got enough gravy to get me going with that dish. Thanks so much!

A very nice gravy. The taste is devine.  I too had a bit of a problem with the consistency... I would have like it a bit thicker but I didn't have the time to let it reduce as much as I would have liked.  The soup is a great addition.  I used the stock from our thanksgiving turkey and added a bit of chicken broth just for fun :)  Overall a great recipe.  thanks for sharing.

Jan 9,2012..update.  Made this again this Christmas and was so happy I did.  Ignoring the fact that I flubbed it horribly last year, I used 1/2 turkey drippings and 1/2 stock and it turned out amazing.  Everyone was thrilled with the taste and consistency, but no one more than me.   Will make every year from now on.  (last year): Giving this 4 stars only because you should not use all 5 cups of turkey drippings...especially if you have brined your turkey...I will make this for Christmas tho and use bought turkey stock as the majority of the base.  This actually had great taste and was as easy as humanly possible to make...just way too salty the way it was prepared..My fault tho!

Tried this a few years/Thanksgivings back and it was a hit! My Mother-in-law especially loved it & after trying the first few bites (this is after the entire family had been sitting at the dinner table for a while) she said she enjoyed it so much that she needed more. She went back to the kitchen for a second helping, then shortly thereafter she wanted a third & this time she brings the entire pot off the stove & places it directly on the dinner table & then everyone joined in & scraped the bowl!  It is honestly that good & obviously a very impressive dish! It can be very versatile, you can adjust the amount of broth, etc to your liking & try different things with it.  Since finding this gem we have made some minor changes, altering it making an easier version of a traditional Thanksgiving turkey dinner that can be used all year long & you don't have to bake an entire Turkey to enjoy it!  And you can make it even more easily & save time by using a crock pot!  Just buy turkey breasts & bake or boil them. Then after making this gravy recipe transfer it to a crock pot.  Debone & "shred" (we actually leave it in big chunks) the turkey & add it to the crock pot.  Let it simmer & mix together while you make cornbread dressing to go with it. Then there you have it, the traditional Thanksgiving turkey dinner with out all the fuss!  I'd say this is the best & most used recipe I've found online!  Recommended highly! Thanks 4 posting!

I used this recipe instead of traditional gravy made from pan juices because we deep fried our bird instead of roasting.  If you roast your bird, I would recommend sticking to the traditional flour and pan juice method.  This gravy just didn't resemble turkey gravy at all.

Would not call this turkey gravy.It tasted like cream of chicken soup gravy. To thin for my taste.

This gravy was great!  I was able to get about 4 1/2 cups of turkey drippings from our 21 pound turkey, but I still used the same amount of ingredients the recipe calls for (maybe a little more flour) and the gravy came out delicious!  The only thing I changed specifically was the poultry seasoning for chicken seasoning, because that's all I had.  Will have to try this with chicken broth, as others have suggested.  The cream of chicken is a wonderful addition!  Thanks for the great recipe!

You weren't kidding -- this was the best gravy, and it was SO easy!  I had to stop myself from slurping it by the spoonful when I was making it.  I thought it was incredible, and it will be a staple every year when I am making a turkey.  Thanks!

Made this for Thanksgiving, it was so yummy! I never, ever make gravy...it makes me nervous, (and I'm a bit of a health nut so we never eat it)and I haven't made any in years, so this was the perfect recipe for me....sooooo easy & so delish!

IF made with real turkey drippings, then what a FANTASTIC and easy gravy recipe! Please note: one cannot expect the same result with all broth/stock, especially if canned/boxed and no turkey fat. Just b/c it utilizes a little canned soup (easssssy, gravy snobs, easy) doesn't mean it's not phenomenally savory, creamy, and the perfect consistency. Only changes I made were to omit garlic, only use a sprinkle of poultry seasoning, and cut salt back by half. I'd never have guessed about the soup being one of the ingredients. I will never make another turkey gravy recipe again. Ridiculously easy to make! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Turned out fantastic!  The first time I've made gravy.  My grandma makes the best gravy in the world and I am very picky about it.  This tasted just like hers!  I used 3 cans of chicken broth rather than turkey stock and a lot of pan drippings.  I didn't have poultry seasoning, so I didn't use it.  I don't think it took away from the taste though.  As the recipe promises, no lumps.

Loved this! I used chicken stock instead of turkey stock because that's what I could find/had available. It still went well with Thanksgiving dinner.

Very good recipe, easy to make. Had a nice thickness and made plenty. Next time I will reduce the seasoned salt to 1/4 or 1/2 tsp as 1 tsp was a bit much and left a slight aftertaste. Overall I'm very pleased. Thank you! I will be making it for Thanksgiving dinner 2010.

I absolutely love this recipe and make it often with the exception of reducing the poultry seasoning by half and adding a 1/2 cup more of milk or water, whichever you prefer to use is fine. If you are looking for a more creamier gravy, use milk and for a thinner, watery gravy use water. Add hot mashed potatoes and toast with sliced turkey breasts or chunks and you have a quick and easy meal that the whole family will enjoy!!!

My husband is usually the gravy maker in the family.  Last night he was doing a deep-fried turkey so I decided to try to do a gravy from scratch.  I didn't have any turkey stock so I used water with chicken bouillon cube and followed the rest of the recipe.  It was perfect!  He asked me today to do some more to eat with the leftover turkey.  This way there is no fat in it either.  I'm so happy with this recipe which is very simple to make.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Great flavor.  This was a lifesaver as all my turkey drippings dried up.  I had to use 3 cans of chicken broth (2 regular, 1 low sodium), and I left out the added salt.  I put the milk & flour in a mason jar and shook it until the flour dissoved then added to the pan--this guaranteed no lumps.  Will use this again next holiday.

This recipe really saved me. I didn't have turkey stock & didn't have time to wait for the turkey to be done to make stock. I needed the gravy ready at the same time as the turkey. I used 2 cans of vegetable broth & 1 can of chicken broth because that's what was in the cupboard. The gravy turned out great. I was really pleased with it & the turkey eaters loved it, too! I'll try actual turkey stock the next time, now that I have some in the freezer. Thank you!

This gravy was AWESOME!!  Gravy was always my favorite part of the Thanksgiving meal when I was growing up and I'm absolutely thrilled to now be able to make my own awesome gravy!!  I made the an Allrecipes recipe for my turkey:  Homestyle Turkey, the Michigander Way by Robin C. and both the turkey and gravy were out of this world!  I definitely recommend the combo.  Because the turkey recipe already had seasoned salt and chicken broth, I omitted the seasoned salt in the gravy - and I am so glad I did!  It was still very salty!  (In the future, I will use lower-sodium ingredients in the turkey.)  This gravy thickened wondefully, there were absolutely NO lumps, and above all, it tasted and looked fantastic!  This will be made each time from now on  :)  UPDATE:  Used low-sodium chicken broth with my turkey this year; still omitted the seasoned salt from the gravy; it was perfect!  Next year, I'm going to have to simmer the chopped giblets during step one, and add a hard-boiled egg or two.  My dad and I love gravy with that "stuff" in it!

I never get gravy right so I never make it HOWEVER my hubby begged me to try again. So I did. and it was lumpy. as always. So this time instead of throwing it out I put it in the blender and then it turned out foamy. YUCK! So I then put it back on the stove determined not to waste food and when it heated thru it turned back into a gravy like consistency and was fantastic! I cooked the Roast Sticky Chicken Rotissere Style from this site and used its drippings/broth to make the gravy. No seasonings needed with that recipe, very savory already. Thanks for sharing.

Very good! I grew up watching store bought gravy being used at the holidays. I've been playing with different gravy recipes since I got married and this one got the most compliments. Also worked well afterwards in making my turkey stew.

I have tried to make this twice with a so-so result the first time and a big flop the second.  Admittedly, it could be user error; however it really didn't turn out for me.

The BEST gravy ever! 
I will only use this recipe from now on.
I used all the drippings from my turkey which was probably a little more than 5 cups (I poured chicken broth in the pan before roasting the brid). I used fresh thyme, rosemary, sage, and marjoram (2 tsp each) instead of poultry season, used 1 tsp. minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and used 1/2 tsp regular salt instead of season salt. This makes a ton of gray. I packaged up the left overs in 1+ cup servings and put it in the freezer for the rest of the year when you can't find turkey gravy.

I really watch my salt, so I was careful (reduced the seasoned salt; cooked a fresh, unbrined turkey; and used reduced salt mushroom soup.  This gravy is the best I have ever made in my 60+ years!

I didn't have pan drippings (deep fried turkey & smoked turkey don't have drippings) and so made a roux with the butter and flour and cooked it on low and kept stirring until it darkened to a beautiful gravy color.  Added the seasonings to the roux, then the condensed soup and mixed well.  Next added the turkey stock (I did have the necks to boil) and let it thicken a bit and finally added just about 1/2 cup of milk.  I let it simmer for about 30 minutes and it turned out great (considering I didn't have any drippings).  Would make it this way again in a pinch.

I made this last year for my Thanksgiving Dinner and it was WONDERFUL! Easy and delicious! I've made it a few times throughout the year with Chicken dishes too. I am looking forward to making it again this Thursday so I am so glad that I saved in in my Recipe Box on this site last year and I wanted to thank the provider for this recipe, so THANK YOU GRADEN! Update:  11/17/2015 - this is my go to Thanksgiving Day gravy for the past 4 yrs now and will continue to be from now on. Never disappoints and tastes so very good!

Usually my husband and I just whisk together the turkey drippings with some flour, and voila! deliciousness! However, this past Thanksgiving I decided to try something different, and unfortunately, it was this recipe. I don't enjoy the taste of canned cream soup all that much, and especially not in such a concentrated form.

This gravy was the perfect combo to my Rosemary Roasted Turkey.  However, I recommend that you only use only 1/4 of condensed cream of chicken soup can because it made the gravy a bit salty for my taste.  The second time around it was perfection.

Wish I could give it more than 5 stars. Fabulous. Didn't change a thing. I've been making gravy for over 40 years and will always make it this way from now on. Rave reviews from Family and Friends. My sister and daughter also used this recipe and got the same results and compliments.

Hands down the easiest, creamiest, most delicious gravy I ever made. The chicken soup which I was skeptical on really added a nice depth of flavor to the turkey stock. My family fought for the leftovers this Thanksgiving. This was the first year my grandmother didn't make her traditional brown turkey gravy she's made for the past 60 years and not one person missed it!

Delicious gravy - I had to do a lot of tweaks, since I didn't have things like turkey stock/pan drippings, so I used three cans of beef stock, 1 can condensed cream of chicken and mushroom salt, almost 1/2 cup flour and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. Deliciousl

Used this for Thanksgiving '09 It was the best, super easy and everyone asked about the recipe. Since I wasn't cooking the turkey I used 5 cups of chicken broth in place of the turkey stock. Also great for leftovers no issue with lumps!!

This was the easiest, BEST gravy that I have ever made.  My turkey made alot of drippings, so I just used them all and topped off with chicken stock.  My daughter keeps asking if she can eat just the gravy.  She has already had 3 servings of rolls and gravy today :)

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving. It turned out great, i used the turkey stock from my roasting pan and the only thing I changed was i was out of poultry seasoning, so i used sage instead and it was very tasty and smooth.

This made excellent gravy. Probably the best recipe I've used and one of the easiest so I'll definitely be making this from now on. It makes a TON though, so unless you're feeding 30 people or like things floating in gravy you can easily cut this in half and still have lots of gravy. I used reduced sodium Campbell's because I brined my turkey and didn't want the gravy to be too salty.It came out great!

Last minute changes caused us to be home for Thanksgiving.  I didn't have all the things I needed, but thought I had gravy.  Found out today (T-day) that I didn't, so found this recipe and it was a huge hit.  Omitted salt like others, and didn't have poultry seasoning, but I had already seasoned water with chicken boullion cubes for my turkey and decided to see if that flavor was enough, and it was.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was incredible! I didn't change a thing. I think next time I might add a little less black pepper to suit my tastes, but this is now my go-to recipe! Thank you!

This is a fabulous gravy but I had to thicken it a little more as it was a little runny for our taste

Very good!  We whipped this up at the last minute.  I don't usually eat mashed pototoes and gravy, but my husband made some pototoes, so we found this recipe.  It was quick and easy.  I substituted Lactose milk to make it a little easier for me to eat.  It was delicious.

This is really quick and easy and great tasting.  It makes good gravy for stuffing or potatoes when you just don't have time for the real thing.

Very good and VERY easy!! I added drippings from the turkey, then added chicken stock to make the 5 cups. I messed up on the flour part somehow, had lumps that I skimmed out, it was my first time ever making gravy. Will DEFINITLY make again!!
**Update** made this again, turned out great (no lumps). Only difference is I did it with beef drippings from a prime rib. Instead of cream of chicken soup I used cream of mushroom soup and beef broth to make up the 5 cups. Nix the poultry seasoning, it was fantastic as ever!

I followed the instructions closely with the exception of the Turkey Drippings.  Mom is making the Turkey, not I, so instead I used the drippings from the Sweet Italian Turkey Sausages I baked for a stuffing recipe (Awesome Sausage, Apple and Cranberry Stuffing).  It stilled turned out pretty good!  I personally couldn't get it to thicken with the prescribed flour only, so added cornstarch and done!  I think it tastes great - hope the family does tomorrow at dinner!

My baby sister and I made Thanksgiving dinner last year for our entire extended family and this gravy was a huge hit!!  I will be making it again this Thanksgiving for my family and I'll also be making it for our church dinner this coming Sunday.  It was the best Turkey Gravy I've ever eaten and I can't wait to make it again!!

I am not a good gravy maker, but this recipe turned out great!!! I didn't have drippings from a turkey. ( I deep fry my turkeys, highly recomend. the turkey is never dry just nice and juicy) so I used chicken broth which worked fine. the gravy was very creamy and indeed had a nice flavour to it.......... I will use this recipe again........ thank you

Wow, this was almost more of a side dish, than an added topping for my Thanksgiving turkey. I mean that in a good way, due to the flavours being so amazing and first rate. It tasted like it took forever, but it was super simple. That's the way I like it! This was great.

This was really yummy and it's nice to have for a no fail recipe when under pressure from new guests! I would probably say that you should taste it as you go and only add seasoned salt if it's your personal preference. I didn't feel like it needed any more salt but we dont' add a lot most of the time so it could just be my family :-)

Taste was good but WAY to salty. I even used the healthy request soup. I think it was because my stock came from a brined turkey. I just don't think this is a good recipe to use if you are using brined turkey stock. Probably will be very good if made with low salt chicken broth or unbrined stock. Also, I reccommend that you use cornstarch and waster rather than milk and flour for the roux to prevent lumps. MAke sure your water is cold for the roux.

This is the first gravy I have made ever and it was the easiest one.  I fixed it for our office luncheon and it was a hit.  I made a little adjustment by using two cups of chicken broth and three cups of turkey drippings. I will add this gravy for my family Thanksgiving dinner next week.

Yummy. I used only 2 cups of beef stock, no poultry seasoning (did not have one) and followed the rest of the recipe. At the end I added small can of mushroom and more pepper. It turned out delicious. This is going to be my stable rec for gravy. Thanks

this gravy was soooo easy to make.  definite time saver or thanksgiving day. all the guests raved about it!! made it twice - once with the seasoned salt and once without.  seasoned salt recipe is too salty for my taste but without the seasoned salt the gravy gets an A+++.

10 stars!!  First time making gravy from scratch for me, always was afraid and thought it would be too difficult.  This recipe is fantastic!  So easy, so tasty!  I made absolutely NO changes.  No problems with lumps either, very smooth, very pretty.  Yummy.  This will always be my gravy recipe.  Thanks so much!

This recipe came in very handy when putting everything on the table. The turkey was borrowed from the "the Michangander Way." 
I made a few alterations I used 2 cans of Campbells chicken & mushroom soup along with the drippings from the turkey. It was quite tastey.   
I look forward to using it again.

I've made this recipe for the last three Thanksgivings that I've cooked, and it was great every time. The turkey stock that is created from the turkey I roast (with root veggies, herbs, and seasonings) is wonderfully seasoned, so no salt or other seasonings were required. Just the stock, soup, flour and milk, prepared as described, and it was perfect. Thanks for this terrific recipe!

This is an awesome recipe.  I used 4 cups of turkey stock, and then 5 cups of chicken bouillon, 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and doubled the spices to make a double recipe. It is the best turkey gravy ever.

Last Thanksgiving I had moved up my side dish game at my parents annual get together.  I am usually responsible for the mashed potatoes, but not for the gravy.  It drives me nuts because the gravy that usually gets ladled onto my beautiful potatoes is pretty much the equivalent of water.  Not this time! I announced I'd be making the gravy too right when I walked in the door.

This recipe was easy and really delicious!  I omitted the salt, figuring there was enough in the soup and the drippings, and I think that is a wise choice for anyone making this, unless you're not putting salt on your turkey.  The gravy is exactly what I wanted, rich, salty, creamy, and delicious.  I got several compliments, even from the usual gravy maker.

I was hesitant to try this, but because of the good reviews I decided to give it a try.  Rave reviews, everyone loved it.  I mixed the soup and seasonings together ahead of time, and stored them in the frig until I was ready to make the gravy.  Very easy, lots of flavor.  I had made turkey stock browning the neck etc. and then cooking them down in chicken broth.

This was delicious! I seriously could NOT stop tasting it as I was cooking it. I will probably make roux with the flour first because the gravy was white and I wouldve liked it to be brown. I used chicken boullion in place of turkey stock as my parents made the turkey at their house. Thanks Graden for this great recipe! It is a keeper!

This is super easy and very tasty.  Plus it makes a ton so there are left overs for the next day.  I also have made it with chicken drippings instead of turkey and it turned out well also.

This gravy is delicious.  We made it for Thanksgiving this year and it made a world of difference in both the turkey and mashed potatoes.  Followed all the directions and ingredients exactly and the consistency and taste were exquisite.  Thank you for sharing!

We love this recipe!  It is easy, tastes great and makes a lot.  It works really well along with the Roast Turkey Michigander Style (this site), because that recipe produces lots of broth.  I like to add both mushrooms and sour cream to the gravy

I tried this at Thanksgiving and everyone was disappointed. Very bland, tasted like soup and not very thick. I seen all the 5 stars and thought it was going to taste great but 11 people agreed it wasn't good like old fashion drippings and flour.

In full disclosure, I should say that I really only like white gravy.  That being said, I had to cook Thanksgiving dinner by myself and new that wasn't an option, so this looked like a great choice.  I made a couple of technical errors that may have effected one of the problems I had with the gravy -- first, I forgot to let the broth come to a boil before I added the cream of chicken, and second, I didn't warm my milk.   All of the reviews I read said they had no lumps, but I did -- not from the flour, but from the cream of chicken.  They were small, and I tried to strain them all out but still some of the slipped thru.  No one but me even noticed.  The main issue for me was the saltiness.  Many reviewers discussed this, so I reduced the salt by nearly half, and I still thought it was salty -- I don't think I've ever said that in my life!  I'm giving this 4 stars because everyone seemed to like it, but just for the salt factor alone, I will look for another turkey gravy.

It was past dinner time, and my family was starving! I had made a turkey but wasn't going to make mashed potatoes and gravy b/c no one ever eats too much of my gravy! My family really wanted to eat it with the turkey so, i jumped on my trusty AllRecipies site and looked for a basic gray recipe. I found this one and will never make gravy another way! I did have to make unintentional changes bc I didn't have poultry seasoning-so I left it out. Also i dumped the milk in before mixing in the flour-so i scooped out some of the liquid into a bowl and did it that way-perfect! Also used Skim Milk and reduced fat cream of chicken.....this was so quick and easy....but so delicious!!!! This was quickly added to my recipe box!

This right here is a keeper. I only had 1 1/2 cups of turkey drippings, so I added 2c of chicken broth and 1c of water. VERY GOOD!!!

I made this Thanksgiving Day for the first time, and it turned out GREAT.  I didn't add the seasoned salt or garlic powder.  I used 2 T. flour and 2 T. corn starch.  I will definitely make this every year.  Thank you!

Awesome gravy! I used low sodium chicken broth since I had brined the bird, and only half of the soup the recipe called for. Turned out fabulous!

Just like the name, this was so easy and TASTY!!! I am not a gravy fan, but this one changed my outlook on gravy! My turkey made lots of wonderful and flavorful drippings...I used 3 C of drippings and 2 C of chicken stock....gravy was very flavorful and smooth - wonderful!

Found this extremely easy and quick to make. Family have asked that this be the new family favourite. I followed the recipe to the "T" and turned out famously. After the second "boiling", and letting it simmer, was quick thick and flavourful.

I had to use chicken broth because the turkey was deep fried.  I use Big Spring Mill *Seasoned* Flour in all my gravies and it gave this one lots of extra flavor (just leave off the seasoned salt and poultry seasoning unless you like it salty).  This is my favorite gravy now because it is low in fat, high on flavor and the ingredients are always in my pantry.

I have been trying to find an easy and delicious turkey gravy recipe for the past three thanksgivings and I've finally found it!!! This was simple, turned out great, and everyone loved it. I will definitely keep this for years to come. I didn't have enough turkey stock from the pan, so I supplemented with chicken stock and it was just fine. Also - note that this recipe makes 28 servings (7 cups)!!! This was way more than I needed - I suggested cutting the recipe in half, unless you're feeding an army!

Perfect!!! Making gravy has never been one of my specialties, but this recipe has changed that. Easy and simple, too. You can't ruin this one. I didn't have poultry seasoning so I put in some Adobo seasoning that I had on hand. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and I was proud to put it on the table this year instead of my usual hit-or-miss gravy. Wow, you have got to try this! Thanks so much.

Works well with the Turkey and rest of thefood I put together.  I would definitely cut back on the broth next time because I had so much drippings.

Very creamy gravy that went perfectly with turkey and mashed potatoes. If you use canned broth instead of drippings, I definately would do away with the seasoned salt. The broth has plenty. Great tasting and easy recipe.

HOLY GRAVY BATMAN!!!  I did it!  I did it!  I made gravy that you can actually eat.  I couldn't find turkey stock so I used 4 cups of chicken stock and 1 cup of pan drippings.  Delicious, easy, and best of all...it WILL work for you too.

This recipe was a great saver for me. We forgot for someone to make gravy for the large family dinner.  I ran online to the trusty allrecipes.com and found this quick recipe.  I followed the directions to the T except we used Cream of mushroom/with garlic soup; because that's all we had.  I also did not add any poultry seasoning, salt or garlic because the turkey drippings were already seasoned.  It was brined and had much of this already in it. It turned out wondeful!  If I would have added the salt ... it would have been too salty.  
The gravy saved the day.  I actually had people call me up later for the recipe to make for their family dinner.

very easy and very good!!!  i burnt the top of the turkey and the drippings were burnt too so i turned to this recipe.  i poured 5 cups of CHICKEN broth into the turkey pan to "change" the flavor to turkey - swished it around, then prepared as directed.  i only had a can of chicken gravy so i used that instead of the cream of chicken soup.  worked fine.  no lumps either!!!!  saved my thanksgiving - except for the burn smell throughout the house :(  haha

OMG...seriously the best gravy ever!  My husband made an announcement at thanksgiving dinner saying that everyone needed to taste the gravy because they would be missing out if they didn't.  Too funny but very true.  The only changes I made was that I used condensed milk since I already had a can open that I needed to use and I added a bit of hickory smoke flavoring.  I also used chicken broth instead of turkey drippings or stock as we deep fried our turkey and my grocery store didn't have any turkey stock.  My sister-in-law says she hates gravy but had seconds of this one!  This will now be my holy grail gravy!
UPDATE: I made a 2nd time but made it a tad different to have as a sauce over chicken and rice.  I just made a bit less and used more flour to make it thicker.  It was excellent this way too!

I was disappointed.  It did not look or taste like gravy but more like soup.  It also didn't thicken very much.  Sorry but I won't be making this again.

Making gravy is not one of my strong points as a cook. I searched allrecipes gravy recipes and decided to try this one. It was easy to make and turned out to be the best gravy I've ever made. Will definitely use it over and over again. Will actually experiment with this recipe to create gravy for other dishes that are good with gravy or sauces. I'm a southern girl so good gravy is a must. It can make or break things like cornbread dressing (stuffing to non-southerners). Thanks for sharing.

I was not impressed at all by this recipe.  I usually enjoy anything that has at least 4 stars, but I didn't like this gravy.  I guess I am use to making it from scratch, and anything else just doesn't cut it...

If you use the "World's Best Turkey" recipe by "Sarah", you'll get drippings that have champagne in them because thats what it calls for in the recipe. By the way, it really is the best turkey... Take those drippings and use this gravy recipe and you have a wonderful gravy to put on everything.  REALLY, REALLY good.  I mean REALLY good. Okay, thats enough reallys.  Happy New Year!!

I had only three cups of turkey stock. I added two cups of chicken broth, omitted the salt and added extra flour. Wow! The gravy was a big hit.  Smothered the gravy over the stuffing and even the six kids ate stuffing for the first time.  Thanks for the great gravy recipe!

Great outcome!  Visiting daughter for Thanksgiving and needed to make gravy for meal with fried turkey.  Used 2 cans chicken broth and one of cream of mushroom.  Used Wondra flour (4T.) to thicken.  Rave reviews!

I needed some gravy for leftover turkey and mashed potatoes, but didn't have any drippings, so this fit the bill.  I didn't need a full batch and I didn't have any turkey stock, so instead of the 5 cups turkey stock I used 3 cups water with 3 chicken boullion cubes.  I still used the full can of cream of chicken soup, which I think made for a thicker gravy.  I also added some Gravy Master for browning and corn starch to thicken a little more.  My husband loved it!

Made a turkey breast using a recipe on this site, Slow Cooker Turkey Breast.  Followed this recipe exactly and it was DELICIOUS!  Used 1.5 cups of stock and changed the servings to 10.  Wonderful, thanks!!

WONDERFUL!  This tastes awesome, and makes a BIG batch.  I used vegetable stock because I couldn't find turkey.  Gravy always seems to run out, but this keeps going and going- all the way through leftovers!

This was a great and easy recipe.  I made this for thanksgiving dinner and everyone raves about it with many saying it was the beat gravy they had ever had.  I’ve now tweaked the recipe for beef by using beef broth and different seasoning blends designed for roasts and have had equally good results. I will definitely keep experimenting with the formula to be able to use in any situation or menu.

This worked in a pinch as I had the ingredients on hand. But the flavor was lacking and it would not thicken up. I had to add twice the flour and it took much longer than indicated

The best smooth, tasty, gravy I had in a long time. I had to use cornstarch because I never have any luck with flour as a thickener. I used  3 cups turkey stock that I had from boiling the turkey neck, 1 can of  chicken stock and when the turkey was done I added 3or 4 tablespoons turkey drippings. Yum!

I use this gravy each and every time I make a turkey and it turns out awesome each and everytime. I do add Kitchen Bouquet liquid gravy browner to give it a darker color but other than that I don't detour too much from. the original recipe. Each time I make it people compliment the flavour.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Used canned knorr  broth, cream of chicken soup and instead of flour, used one envelope of chicken gravy and one of brown gravy (for color).  Was a bit salty (did not add salt either) so next time buy low salt soups. Otherwise very good.

I have only done a few reviews in my lifetime..however, this was so good that I had to.  Only had about 2 cups stock from turkey so used chicken broth and it was a hit with my family.  I am a pretty good cook and usually make gravy another way but wanted to try something different.  This was a hit with my family.  My neice who doesn’t normally like gravy wanted all the leftovers.   So easy and so good.

Easy and even the pickiest of kids will love it!  Without a turkey, I made a couple adjustments. I used 5 cups of organic Swanson chicken broth instead of turkey stock.  I also substituted Lawry’s Seasoned Salt for both the poultry seasoning and seasoning salt ingredients. I would recommend continuing to cook for 3 minutes at the end rather than 1 to obtain a thicker creamier consistency. Great recipe, thank you!

I made this twice for the Thanksgiving holiday. The first time, I cooked a turkey breast and used the drippings to make the recipe for our Thanksgiving dinner at my daughter's home. A day after the holiday, I made the recipe without pan drippings for our turkey breast leftovers. Despite adding additional poultry seasoning and cutting the recipe in half (except for the cream of chicken soup), I followed the recipe as written. This is a delicious gravy and takes the stress off the kitchen when the turkey is being carved.

I added the neck bone from the cooked turkey...yummy! I also added a bit of onion powder and rosemary.    This gravy was a big hit!

This was so easy and tasty. My 14 year old made it for their Friendsgiving. He added a little less milk and he added garlic salt instead of seasoning salt because he didn't know what seasoning salt is. It was awesome.

This was fantastic. My husband said it was the best gravy he had EVER had. I made a turkey for Thanksgiving and used the drippings plus 3 cups of chicken broth because I did not have turkey stock. It came out great and made a ton. Perfect!

didn't have any drippings as we smoked the turkey this year, and couldn't find any turkey stock so had to use chicken (essentially made a chicken gravy).  Easy and good, made a huge volume though

If you don't want lumps, simply mix the flour in the COLD liquid ( chicken broth or water) first before adding to the turkey juice . Stir together the mix with the turkey broth, stirring constantly till  thickened

Made this for Thanksgiving.  I browned the turkey neck, giblets, and heart in a sauce pot and added 5 cups of turkey broth to the dark brown drippings.   I brought to a boil & took out the neck, giblets, and heart.   I added a can of cream of chicken soup, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, touch of onion powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of ground pepper.  Also added the poultry seasoning indicated in recipe.  See recipe for amounts of seasoning.  I then mixed a 1/4 cup of flour into 1/2 cup warmed milk and slowly poured it into the gravy while whisking.  When turkey was done,  I added all the pan drippings to the finished gravy.  Do NOT add salt!! It will be way to salty!  PS -  You may have to play with the milk to flour mixture to thicken to your liking. Very good!!

Used chicken broth, Campbell's chicken + mushroom condensed soup. Also strained in some drippings fro roasting pan after it came out of the oven, then spooned in some of the turkey juices while carving to the gravy while it was warming on the stove. So good, and it didn't separate or get gross in the fridge. Excellent poured over leftovers for up to a week. Just make this, you won't be sorry.

Finally had enough gravy for the entire Thanksgiving meal AND all the leftovers, too! This gravy tasted delicious & was a huge hit with everyone. I added some of the cooked turkey neck  & giblets (that I used to make the turkey stock) & chopped hard boiled egg (it would've been fine without it but I was channeling some of my childhood holiday memories). Next time will omit the seasoned salt as it was a bit too salty. Will DEFINITELY be making this again (and again and again).

Everyone loved this.  I was asked by others for the recipe.  I made it exactly as described but with 1/2 of the salt.  Next time I'll eliminate the salt and maybe look for lower sodium stock as it's just a little salty for me.  Otherwise, it's now my staple turkey gravy recipe!

This is such an easy and delicious gravy to make! If you don't use any of the turkey drippings from the pan, then you keep the fat content low, which is great for reheating purposes. I did add the turkey neck when I first boiled the chicken broth. It turned out very well. I'll never make a different gravy again!

Peal up skin to get butter under it and rub it on top, butter chive garlic mix, Place turkey directly on middle oven rack, pan on bottom rack to catch drippings with 2 cups stock and 1.5-2 cups water, Apple, 1/2 0nion, chopped carrots- just for gravy flavor.. Don't stuff turkey check it 45-30 min earlier than normal it'll cook a little faster like this... Maybe 10-12 min per pound ...

Like another reviewer on here, I made my turkey Michigander Style. I easily had 5 cups of drippings, so I just used that and no stock. I didn't have milk (doh!), so I had to use half and half. I was worried this would make it too sweet or something, but it tasted great. ALSO, I only used 1/2 tsp of salt and I still think the gravy is pretty salty. I would recommend starting with a very small amount and tasting it before you add more. Lastly, once it was all done I added some chopped up giblets (I cooked them with the turkey in the drippings). It's amazing!!

This gravy was phenomenal. I halved the recipe and used organic unsalted chicken stock with cream of celery soup. I also chopped up the turkey liver and added it to the pot. Also substituted white pepper for black. Best gravy I ever made. This one is a keeper.

Did a mash-up of this and my Mom's gravy: boiled the neck and giblets on low with celery and onion for an hour or so. Removed the neck and giblets and let cool; diced giblets and removed meat from neck bones. Return meat to gravy and begin with step 1 of this recipe.  So good!

Great recipe as written. I have made it multiple times with various substitutions including cream of mushroom soup, fresh poultry herbs, and different amounts of drippings depending on how much came off of each bird. The gravy turns out tasty everyone and is now requested at meals by my mother in law.

This gravy is delicious! This was my first turkey gravy to make and I was a bit nervous making it but it was easy and tasted great. I ended up putting giblets in it but will leave them out next time just because I'm not a fan of them. Will definitely continue making this every Thanksgiving!

The only change I did was I added 1/2 cup of light cream and 1/2 cup low fat milk, just to give it a creamier flavor. It was tasty, I would make it again. The only thing was my gravy turned out to be a darker color, not light, don't know why but it was still good.

Wow! This gravy exceeded my expectations! I've been cooking for years, but for some reason I could never master the art of good gravy making. Needless to say, I would panic when Thanksgiving rolled around and the need for gravy would arise. I'm fearful no more!! This gravy is perfect! I had about 1 cup of turkey drippings in the pan, skimmed the fat off, added 32 oz of turkey stock, followed the directions for cooking, added the flour to cold milk and did some whisking and then blended into the stock mixture. Added the seasonings and a perfect gravy was mine about 5 minutes later! This was truly the high point of the meal (for me) because I have finally found a solution to my sad gravy skills  :-) Thanks for a great recipe!!

I did need to add a lot of salt and used some of the starchy water from my potatoes to thicken this up but the flavor was great.

Another 5 star recipe from Allrecipes.com. This is as smooth and creamy a gravy as you can ever expect to get. I know gravy, having made it for nearly 50 years. I had some on poached eggs and toast this morning. Delicious! I used 1/2 the salt and 2 teaspoons of poultry seasoning instead of one. You can't go wrong with this one.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2015, and used 4 cans of chicken stock and 1 can of chicken broth, and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and all the recipe seasoning. I did let the mixture simmer for 20 minutes, then added the cold milk which had the 1/4 cup of flour whisked in as suggested.  I let this simmer and thicken for 20 minutes and added some sauted white mushrooms (drained out all liquids before adding) and added a little more of all the seasonings listed in the recipe. It was very tasty and everyone thought it was delicious. I used the leftover gravy as a base for a turkey soup using the turkey bones, added onions, celery, carrots and the turkey drippings (minus the oil) some of the dark turkey meat and more of the same seasonings, then added water to cover all the items in the pot, and then brought it to a boil, then let it simmer for 2 hours. After fishing out all the bones, it was a delicious soup. A big bonus from this gravy!!!

This is a really good gravy.  Way to salty although, but that was partially my fault.  I smoked my turkey, which had a great flavor to it ... but I should have omitted the salt and garlic and use a low sodium soup.  You can always add salt if it needs it!!!

This gravy is FANTASTIC! Would definitely recommend! I didn't have enough turkey stock, so I substituted what I didn't have with chicken stock. Still turned out delicious! This is going to be my holiday gravy from now on.

I tried this recipe yesterday. It was my first time ever making gravy. It was quite possibly the best gravy I've ever had. I had 2 turkeys, so used more pan drippings than turkey stock, and added about half - 2/3 cup more flour to thicken it up. The cream of chicken soup really adds great flavor. I had my older family members shocked at the quality of my gravy!

This never thickened up for me and it was a little flavorless. And yes, I followed the recipe exactly. Historically though, I've never had luck with gravy. It's probably me.

I just made this recipe as is...I actually had cooked two whole turkey breasts and got about 4.25 cups of drippings from my two turkeys. I did find that I needed to add about a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it up a tad more. I used fat free cream of chicken and it was just right. This has a nice creamy consistency and no lumps. I'm making this from now on!

Needed to add more milk and flour to thicken enough and ended up being enough for an army. Flavor was great, I would make again but only make half the recipe and remember it needs more milk and flour to thicken than what recipe calls for.

Never put dry into wet. After your milk is warmed put a few drop at a time into the flour  until the flour is well dissolved.  You then pour it into the milk and wish it around without having lumps.

I browned 2 turkey thighs in butter poultry seasoning, freshly ground black pepper, garlic powder then boiled them in organic chicken broth then shimmered until meat was falling off bones. Aftering removing the skin and bone from thighs i shreaded the thigh meat and set aside. Using the organic broth thighs had shimmered in and drippings from the turkey I roasted  I made gravy as instructed doubling the ingredients since I had twice the broth as the recipe calls for. Once the gravy was done I then added the shreaded turkey thigh meat to the gravy.

This is an excellent way to make Make-Ahead gravy! I use the drippings from a rotisserie chicken, so I can get the flavor a few days before the Big Day.  And a trick I learned from an episode of Emeril - add the flour to the grease and drippings and dissolve the flour in the drippings. That way, you don't get splotchy flour gravy. Love the use of Cr of Chix in this!

This was easy and excellent! I made it with turkey drippings instead of broth and reduced the drippings by 1 cup - one of my guests said it tasted like KFC! I would reduce the black pepper next time.

We don't usually have gravy with our turkey, but the fresh turkey we cooked yesterday came out SO DRY we knew it had to have something or all of the leftovers would go uneaten. Today I found this recipe and decided to give it a try since I had all of the ingredients on hand.  Since we had discarded the pan drippings prior to realizing how dry the meat was, I added two Tablespoons of butter and a couple of bullion cubes at the beginning.  I followed the recipe the remainder of the way except, based on other reviews, I omitted the seasoning salt.   We loved it. I even ladled it over my dressing leftovers, and I never do that!  All of remaining turkey is now soaking in a nice gravy bath. Tomorrow we will add vegetables before transforming it into a nice turkey pie. Thank you, Graden.

Not impressive at all.  You can't beat the gravy that's made from turkey  parts and real herbs.

This was really good and so easy.  I used 4 cups of turkey stock and  one cup of chicken broth.  I simmered the ingredients in the first step with the turkey neck for a couple of hours while my turkey cooked.  When I removed the turkey from the oven, I added my drippings to the gravy, removed the turkey neck and let the gravy cook for probably another 30 minutes or so before thickening it.  It was delicious and I didn't have to resort to the jarred gravy this year!

I substituted the turkey stock with pan drippings with just plain ol'beef stock (used gravy for homemade poutine). I thought it tasted good by following the recipe exactly (minus my previously mentioned substitution) but thought it lacked a little...zest? So I added about a tbsp of white wine vinegar after staring into the abyss of my pantry for what seemed like an eternity. It really added to the flavor! All an all, a good basic recipe that allows you to tweak it either which way you'd like.

I made this exactly by the recipe, it took a lot longer to thicken but it was absolutely worth it.  Everyone loved this gravy and so easy, smooth and creamy.  I did the same as others and made the Michigander turkey and there was lots of broth and the flavor was fantastic.

I wasn't very impressed.  I didn't have turkey drippings, so I bought the unsalted chicken stock from the grocery store (which maybe that is where I went wrong).  I followed the recipe exactly, and even added the seasoned salt, since I did use the unsalted stock.  The flavor was ok, but it was as thin as water, and the color wasn't impressive.  I stood there and stirred forever, and finally pulled out the corn starch, and THAT didn't even thicken it up to a normal consistency.  I ended up putting it on the table anyway for the whole family, and I am the only person that tried it.  The appearance must have turned everyone else off.  Oh well.

It IS easy and part of it can be made the night before.  What I found lacking was flavor!  I had to add chicken bouillon and had to thicken it far more than the recipe suggests.  Easy?  You bet!  Can you do better?  Absolutely-

made this for Thanksgiving dinner 2013 and we loved it!!! the advice of another reviewer said to cut all the spices by half now this is good advice because you can always add more spices according to your taste I took that advice and cut all the spices by half and it turned out wonderful!!! my opinion is if I had not cut the spices in half, the gravy would have overpowered the rest of the dinner it would have been delicious! but overpowering. This of course, is just a matter of taste. This is the best recipe for turkey gravy not a thing is wrong with this recipe thank you for sharing!!

I was skeptical of this recipe because of the condensed soup, which I usually don't like in recipes.  However, I followed the recipe exactly (minus the salt as other reviewers suggested) and WOW! It had a wonderful flavor and texture.  I would have never known it contained canned soup. Thanks for a great recipe!

So easy - will use this recipe from now on! Great flavor and holds up well. I didn't have 5 cups of turkey drippings so I kind of eyeballed the ingredients. Coloring is nice too! (Btw - I always use my Tupperware Quick shake container for the flour milk mixture and it helps to gradually add while keeping it blended well.)

This was very easy, I didn't have cream of chicken so I used cream of mushroom and it was really good. Thanks!

This was very easy and extremely flavorful. I added chicken bouillon cubes and additional water to make a larger quantity and it was delicious! I froze what I had left and when using it later, it was still very good!

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It came out a beautiful color and absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, with some minor changes recommended by another reviewer (HEADMEISTER, thank you), which was to brown the turkey neck and add 5 cups of chicken broth, bring to a boil and remove the neck as a substitute for 5 cups of turkey stock.

It turned out great but a little salty.  I think next time I will leave the salt out of the recipe since there is some in my turkey stock.

I just made this as a test run for Thanksgiving.  Very yummy.  I followed it almost to a tee.  We'll be using this as it's easy to prepare and fool proof because of the chicken soup.  Great recipe!

I thought this recipe was outstanding and pretty simple to handle while simultaneously trying to cook about 6 other things on Thanksgiving.  My sister is not a gravy fan but even she thought it was delicious.  We were looking for a good flavor that did not call for giblets and this recipe is definitely the winner.

Made this recipe this year for my Thanksgiving dinner, and it was OUTSTANDING.  The only thing I changed was I cut back the season all by half a teaspoon.  We love salt and it was plenty salty I thought, so I was glad I followed my instinct.  Either way, it was GREAT.  Thanks for this great, simple recipe!

This was good turkey gravy - I didn't even have any drippings (had my turkey smoked by someone) but the gravy turned out very well.  There was also a lot of it which was good.  The only change I made (aside from no drippings) was to use chicken stock since I couldn't find turkey stock in the store.

Best gravy ever! I cooked my turkey with celery, carrots, and onions in the water. After cooking I removed the turkey and put everything in the pan into the food processor, added the ingredients as directed and it came out perfectly. Go easy on the salt because it comes out very well seasoned.

Great recipe!  I did end up using half reduced sodium and half regular stock.  It did turn out a little salty but I like salty.  Definitely made PLENTY of gravy for everyone and leftovers.  Also, the grocery store that I normally shop at misordered turkey stock so I ended up using chicken stock and it came out just fine and pleased the whole crowd.

DELISH!! The only reason I gave a 4 star was because I thought the seasoning needed to be watched. I did not take into consideration that I brine my turkey which can salt the meat so drippings can be also. Everyone LOVED the gravy...I got a great review from my father-in-law who is a chef. Thank you!!

Made this today and it came out perfect!!  Wow!  Followed the recipe exactly, but I think I had more liquid in the drippings than I thought so I added a tablespoon more of flour mixed with a little more milk when I could tell it needed a bit more thickening.  I can't believe how good it was!!!

I used this gravy recipe this Thanksgiving and my family loved it more than store bought.  I used the drippings from my roasted turkey minus the fat.  I added canned chicken broth to the remaining drippings to make up the five cups of stock.  It was wonderful and I would make this again.

Made this for the first time today for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a hit!  My father in law went back for seconds on the gravy!  Easy to make, the only thing I did differently is made my own turkey stock by boiling water with the turkey neck and giblets.  Then I just strained off the foam that formed on the broth, and removed the neck and giblets.  Then proceeded as written.  (only because I couldn't find turkey stock, and I wanted turkey flavor and not chicken).  Will definitely keep this one, since I've never been able to turn out a really good gravy.  Now I can!  Thanks!

This gravy turned out absolutely amazing. First time making gravy, and everyone loved it. I will definitely be using this recipe again. I modified it slightly because I wasn't getting 5 cups of drippings. I cooked down the neck, wings, and legs from the Turducken I was making the night before in a couple cups of water. I ended up with 1-2 cups of stock. I then took all my drippings 3-5 cups and added it to the stock. I brought this combination to a boil sprinkled in some cajun seasoning and a dash of salt. Then I added the soup, and brought it back to a boil. I then turned it to simmer and added the milk and flour. Followed the general guidelines of the recipe, but modified it slightly.

I followed the recipe as it was written, and the gravy  turned out too thin.  However, it did have good flavor.  I'll add more flour the next time I make it.

I used the drippings from my Turkey and had more then enough. The only thing i'll do different next time is use a low-sodium cream of chicken and use very little salt. But this gravy is very easy to make and it Delicious!! This is my new way to make Gravy!!

I was leery of this recipe because I thought using cream of chicken soup for gravy was cheating! But I really wanted a flavorful gravy to go with the turkey I made. This gravy was unbelievable! It was so tasty and I got nothing but rave reviews. I did not use turkey stock because I had more than 5 cups of pan drippings, so I just used all drippings. That was the only modification I made to the recipe. Some complained the gravy comes out too salty. I didn't find that to be the case but I tend to like things a little more salty. I guess I would say to use half the season salt and low sodium soup and turkey stock if it's a concern. Very pleased with this and will definitely make again. Could easily be modified for chicken gravy.

Excellent results.  Made for Christmas meal and everyone raved about the gravy.  My gravy always turned out okay, but never received kudos.  This recipe is a definite keeper.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This came out good but a little floury (gritty/powdery) and was not as dark as I was hoping, but I also didn't have as much drippings as I was hoping, but this did really taste great (it was perfectly seasoned), and was the perfect accompaniment to Thanksgiving dinner.

Tried this with chicken broth rather than stock because I made it the day before I cooked the turkey,the rest was exactly like the recipe-family loved it-even my husband who is very particular about turkey, stuffing, and gravy-have to make stuffing "just like Mommas's"-easy and will definitely use again!

This was perfect. I always manage to screw up recipes like this, but somehow this was perfect with very little effort. NO lumps, the warm milk trick seemed to work. Great flavor, and very easy to make.

Made this just as it's written and it came out decent, but not great. Lacked a little in flavor and it's a little on the thick side (just prefer a more liquid gravy.) I might try it again and make some small adjustments.

This gravy is so good and so easy! I reduced the salt by half and it was still on the salty side. I think this depends on how you prepare your turkey though. I used The Michigander Turkey from this website.

Easy to make, tastes good, doesn't rely on pan drippings. Did get a little too thick with standing though.

This was the best gravy I have had in a LONG LONG time.  I am not a fan of the "giblet gravy" my family makes so this time I tried this and it was awesome.  We made Thanksgiving dinner for my husband's employees who had to work that day so I doubled the recipe and it was way too much.  The original amount was more than enough for my family of 4 and 4-8 employees.  Oh and instead of the turkey stock we used the remaining juices from the Turkey after we pulled it out of the oven and I think it truly was the key to making it so good.

Very good gravy with not a lot of work, no messy pan drippings.  It makes an awful lot though so in the future I will cut in half.

Very good!  A big hit.  It makes a TON.  I had seven adults and it was way more than needed.  A delicious recipe though.  The cream of chicken soup is a really nice touch and I made my own turkey stock with neck/giblets.  Awesome!

Turkey gravy has always seemed to be a difficult thing for me to master.. but this recipe was great!! Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving... the only change I made was I used heavy cream instead of the milk.

This was great!  I changed it by replacing the turkey stock with what I had on hand, 2 cups chicken stock, 1 cup milk, 3 cans of cream of chicken and sliced 9 hard boilled eggs.  The spices and the milk/flour mix remained the same.  It was the right consistency--not too liquidy and not too thick.

Very easy to make! We purchased a bbq Turkey from a local restaurant and so we did not have any drippings, but wanted gravy. Instead, I used store bought stock. After reading the comments, I decided not to add salt and the gravy was plenty salty for our taste. I also wisked the flour into cold milk and added. It thickened instantly and no lumps! The gravy has a great flavor, makes large quantities and works very well if you need gravy, but didn't cook the turkey.

Turned out really bland and did not thicken.  I did cut the recipe in half, so maybe that messed up the flavor.

I've made gravy in the past that hasn't thickened up right. This one works perfect if you follow it exactly. I have made it twice and its a lovely light gravy that goes great on potatoes and with poultry - especially turkey of course.

This is a really good gravy, fast and easy, and I had all the ingredients for it already. I did the recipe exactly how it was written, It was the perfect thickness, so I wouldn't recommend the cornstarch and extra flour like some reviewers did. Next time I think i'll put in half of the poultry seasoning it calls for it was a little overpowering. I also cut this in half which is 14 servings, but in reality halving this recipe perfectly served enough gravy for four of us.

This was wonderful!  I didn't add the milk, didn't think it needed it. Also, since all I had was cream of mushroom soup that is what went in.  I will make this again for sure!

I made this with the drippings from my "easy herb roasted turkey" which I used two cups of chicken broth and one cup of water in the bottom of my pan while cooking the turkey. The gravy turned out perfect!! I did have a little bit of trouble getting it to thicken. I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the season salt since I already had enough salt in the chicken stock. I ended up having to add a tablespoon of cornstarch and a little water to it to get it to thicken.  The flavor was amazing according to my husband (I didnt try it because I dont eat meat). Very creamy, pretty color and easy to make.

Thank you so much!  I have never been able to make gravy, it was always lumpy, gluey and tasteless. The sad thing is I am a good cook, but have not ever mastered gravy.  This was easy and excellent.  This will always be in the menu of holidays!

I have always made my gravy the oldfashioned way, and havent ever had a complaint. But I wanted something just a tad differnt this year - and found it, adding the soup was a wonderful idea! silky smooth! the soup was salty enough though so I didnt add seasoned salt, just added a bit more poultry seasoning (Bell's Poultry Seasoning is the best!) Thank you JMOR777 for a Great gravy :)

I will use a little more flour the next time so it will be a little thicker.  Otherwise this was the easiest ever and everyone loved it!!

The cream of chicken soup was a surprise for me but I tried it anyway and it was worth it because my hubby raved about it, not just during Thanksgiving dinner but with each plate of leftovers!

This actually turned out to be quite good.  I had to put quite a bit more flour than the recipe called for.  As I made the gravy, I just added small amounts to a measuring cup and whisking in more flour, and then returning it to the gravy mixture.  I did this until I got the right consistency that I wanted.

This is the most delicious and easiest recipe I've tried to make gravy.  It was perfect for the day after Thanksgiving when we had a ton of leftovers.  We made what we call a “commercial” plate(usually made with roast beef).  Take two slices of Sunbeam white bread and load it up with turkey, then cut in an angle.  Take a big scoop of mashed potatoes and left over dressing right between the two halves, then smother it all in this wonderful gravy.  It was delicious, the kids about licked the plate.

It was creamy with no lumps. But, way to salty.  I would make again and omit the seasoning salt.  Can always add more after making.  I had to keep adding milk to dilute the extreme salt taste.

This was really easy and turned out so good. I don't understand how anyone could give this a low rating and think those that did must not have had good turkey drippings.  It rocked!

This gravy turned out beautifully! This Thanksgiving, we realized at the last minute that we had forgotten to buy jarred gravy, so I quickly found this recipe and whipped it up with moments to spare. It was so easy to make, and everyone raved.

Kinda blah.  With the soup, probably didn't need more salt.  I also added a can of ready made turkey gravy, and that still didn't seem to do much.  Seems a waste of the cream of chicken soup!

I was surprised at good the gravy tasted (I had doubts that anything made with a canned soup would be as good as everyone said), but mine did have some small lumps. I thought I was following the recipe exactly, but looking back over the recipe I realized I might not have used enough milk. There was a really nice taste to the gravy and since I didn't bother skimming off the small bits of turkey from the breast I'd cooked the small lumps of flour weren't very noticeable. Next time I make this I'll just be extra careful to get all the flour mixed in before adding it to the gravy.

this was really good and EASY to make, I did add a good bit of "tonys" seasoning (comes in a green can and I'm pretty sure you can only get it around here)  to it though as it was a bit bland to all of us here, being in Louisiana we are used to things a little more spicy. But it was for sure a keeper!

Something went terribly wrong with this. It was nice and liquidly until I added the flour at which point it congeled into a thick paste like consistency. It was still really tasty, but if you reduce the mixture suficiently, the flour is not necessary!

This recipe is excellent!  The gravy was smooth and full of flavor, with a nice, deep golden color.  I received many compliments this Thanksgiving.  It will be my gravy recipe every turkey day!  I used three cups of my own turkey stock, and 2 cups of boxed chicken stock.  Terrific - thanks so much!

This gravy was awesome!  It was just the right consistancy, not too thin, not too thick.  The only difference that I made was just to use regular salt and I used cream of chicken soup with herbs. A+++

Thanks for the great idea of adding the soup. I was only making gravy for four, so I just added the soup and some broth and flour by the tbsp to the roasting  pan and whisked for for @ 10 min. By far my best attempt at gravy and so easy!
