Even though I made my own changes, I'm giving this 5 stars for the great idea of adding grated cheddar cheese!  I left out the ketchup and egg. The rest the same, though I used dry minced onion and garlic powder instead of fresh (I was in a hurry). Cooked them on the grill and my family LOVED them!! Full of flavor!!

So good.  I added a package of chopped bacon to this recipe.  My friend who has always lived on a ranch and ate the freshest beef, praised all the taste that these burgers had.

These turned out to be the best. My wife, who hates hamburgers fell in love with these. She even passed the recipe on to her mother, who is a chef.

These things fall apart extremely easily on charcoal grills.  I got the hang of how to grill them on the last few burgers that I cooked...

These were "okay".  I was out of Worcestershire, and didn't realize it until I started making these, so that got left out.  And I didn't broil them, because I was practicing for our campout, so I cooked them in a dutch oven.  They fell apart, so we just ate them like loose meat, instead of burgers.  I don't know if I will make these again or not -- they weren't as flavorful as I thought they would be -- but maybe it is because I didn't have the Worcestershire sauce.  A toss-up, I guess - but  a nice change from just plain ole hamburgers.

These burgers had a really good flavor but did not stick together at all on the BBQ.  I think next time, I won't put as much ketchup to see if that helps them stick together better.

These were very good! My family really enjoyed them, even my non meat loving 2 year old. I added 1 rounded teaspoon of dijon mustard and a dash of garlic powder to the mix. And yes they were rather messy in the broiler, but mine stayed together just fine.

I didnt think they tasted very good. I was looking foward to the cheddar taste and didnt. Also, broiling it made a big mess, not to mention lots of smoke and the pan was in the middle of the oven. I would not recommend.

ok for starters it took longer to cook by a long shot. It took me 25 or 30 minutes to cook these. Yes, it was messy and it was hard to flip them because they fell apart. I didn't expect a real cheesy flavor considering how much the recipe calls for so that was not too much of a downfall. I was looking for a simple and quick recipe that was different from our average, unfortunately it was plain average. it was not bad tasting by any means, but it was not above average of a broiled burger. My 2 year old daughter didn't like it because it looked funny, but she's only two so that can be expected. My husband is a horrible critic, but he said it was average. He liked the taste, but it needed more of something to put different flavor. I recomend this recipe if your looking for a simple broiled burger that is juicy. But if your like me and need a different flavor in life this recipe doesn't cut it.

Burgers were dry, meat was too "crumbly," didn't hold together well.  The flavor was not outstanding, couldn't really taste the cheese.  Will not make again.  Broiling the burgers was very convenient though!

This was fine but I think the ground sirloin would been better without all the doctoring up. It seemed too much and took away the flavor of the meat itself. I used dried onion to save time. This was good, but not great.

This only gets 3 stars because my kids thought they were yummy and asked for seconds and because they were very fast to make. Otherwise they fell apart just like in other reviews and I tweaked the recipe I added bbq sauce instead of ketchup and I used more cheese than called for and I didn not add oregano. I will not be making these agian

Just cooked these on my indoor grill...amazing!
I sauteed the onions before instead of adding them raw, and added sauteed garlic as well. I forgot the oregano, but i think it was better without. Customized toppers for each one...mine with a slice of swiss, sauteed onions and avocado, daughter's with sharp cheddar and avocado. 
We both loved them. Definitely will be making again!!

Great tasting burger.  Add about 1/2 c. of Italian seasoned crumbs to the mixture.  This will firm it up while cooking.

Having read most of the earlier reviews, I used 2 eggs and added 2 tablespoons dried bread crumbs. This helped the burgers hold together. My crowd likes it hot, so I also added some chopped, pickled jalapenos (8 rings) and 1 teaspoon tabasco. Excellent flavor.

Pretty good recipe.  I left out the egg and oregano and added some ground peppercorn/garlic seasoning, which gave them more flavor.  I also fried them up in a skillet instead of broiling them.

I had a problem with the patties falling apart, but it was home-ground deer meat that was on the lean side, so I take the blame for that. It was a little onion-heavy, but the onions I have ran on the large side, so no hits for that either. Overall it is a good recipe that I will be using again. :)

Very Tasty, But didn't hold together real well.  Also made a very big mess in your broiler. My husband thought they tasted great, though.  Nice change from plain old hamburgers.

These were just ok.  I couldn't even really taste the cheddar, so what was the point?  It just left a greasy mess in the pan.

This recipe was great! Even my picky 15 month old son loved it. I only used half the ketchup and they still came out great. Next time I'm going to add some bacon like one of the other posters suggested.

The burgers had a great taste but werent in a patty form. Not sure what happened. They were still gobbled by the family though. Great flavor!

I do the same recipe minus the oregano.....fantastic! The trick to burgers with lots of ingredients like this is to form the patties and place in freezer for a bit, firms them up and they dont fall apart on the grill ( it works for me!)

Excellent topped with more cheddar cheese and BBQ sauce (we prefer Dinosaur BBQ)

I couldn't taste the cheese.  But I used a BBQ grill...so maybe that had something to do with it.
