Added Montreal & lawry's to the marinade & switched the veggies to mushrooms, green bell pepper, & red potato (cooked halfway prior), looked beautiful & tasted even better!!! Will grill all summer!

Excellent!!! Loved this Marinade!!! I did add 2 cloves of garlic to the marinade and blended it all together in a food processor.  The Kabobs were wonderful.  I used zucchini, 1/2 a vidalia onion, and an orange sweet bell pepper.  I will use this marinade on many other things now....tastes like it would go great with fish or shrimp!

Incredibly delicious and very simple too. I was worried it would taste too much like terriyaki, but it was so much more complex with the dijon and the rosemary. I can be very picky about my kabob marinades, but this one is definitely a keeper!

I have not made kabobs before but was looking for something tasty yet simple. This recipe was perfect for both. Loved it.

When I showed this recipe to my fiance, he questioned the teriyaki and rosemary combination...we were pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  The flavors actually balanced out very well and made for a delicious flavor combination.  Only thing we did differently was marinade it for 4 hours.  Will make this again!

Was overwhelmed by rosemary. Did not care for this recipe.
