I was going to wait to review this recipe until I had used it again, but then decided to post my results/mistake in the possibility that it might help someone else. I only had large granule white sugar and dark brown sugar so I used them instead of normal sugar and light brown. The cookies that were baked for only 10 minutes had a gummy/cardboardy texture, and the ones that baked for longer were crispy to the point of being too crispy. They were, however, good in milk. I added a little ground ginger and cinnamon to half the dough, and enjoyed the flavor more than without the extra spices. If I get around to baking again with fine white sugar and light brown sugar I will post results and compare the two batches.

We loved these cookies! I did use the vanilla, and just for a bit of spice I added 1/4 tsp of ginger and 1sp of cinnamon. You really do have to chill the dough and the trays, and work fast. I used powdered sugar instead of flour to prevent sticking and I really think it worked well and added a little extra to the flavour.

Thanks Galia for sharing this fun, easy recipe. My little one had a ball using the cookie cutters and decorating then.

These cookies are crispy and very tasty.  The brown sugar gives them a great flavor.  I used vanilla and recommend you do too.   

The dough rolls out very, very easily and is somewhat fragile.  If you need to decorate your cutout shapes before baking them, it is a good idea to chill the cookie sheet with the unbaked cookies on it in the refrigerator for 10 minutes or so before proceeding.  

It is also a good idea to chill the sheet with the unbaked cookies on it before placing it into your preheated oven.  

This recipe reminds me of a recipe I lost nearly 40 years ago.  Thanks Galia!!!

I have tried two other recipes and this one was the best!  They were easy to cut out and baked quickly. I will have to make more to give out for Christmas.  Thanks!

They were not easy to roll out, but they were good for drop cookies! These taste good and were gone the next day. I had to make more!

Very good taste and texture! They are like the ones that we get from the local bakery. A tip for some who have trouble rolling and cutting: flatten dough out on a plastic cutting board and place in freezer for several minutes and use different size biscuit cutters for cutting, then bake for 10 minutes.

I loved these cookies! I made them for Valentine's Day and they were a hit. I only chilled them for 40 minutes and didn't have any trouble rolling them out. They were soft and delicious. I will definately use this recipe again.

Overall, good cookie.  My first attempt at sugar cookies, and was looking for a simple recipe, that didn't have me running to the store!  This was it! No complaints here.  Although, I've had better....

I've never been a big fan of sugar cookies, but these are by far the best I've ever had! My husband and I could not stop eating them, and between the two of us, they disappeared within a week. The only change I made to this recipe was adding 1 tsp. of almond extract. Delicious! Thank you.

Great recipe!  Always watch how much flour you are using.  Always use a little less first, then you can add more if you need to. I used 2 1/4 cups flour and didn't need any more than that.  I also used only 1 tsp. vanilla then 1/2 tsp almond extract, which always adds a nice flavor.  Oh, and I used 1 1/4 white sugar instead of using brown.  Didn't have any problems with sticking when I used my stoneware.. only with my regular cookie sheet.  They turned out great for Valentine's Day!

This was my first attempt at making sugar cookies and they turned out really good...tasted like tea cakes. They turn out huge in the oven! I don't have a rolling pin though and just flattened with hands and cut with cookie cutters after chilling.

These are good and have a wonderful flavor but I the dough becomes really floury very fast. I would also not bake them for the full 10 minutes. I was leaving them in the oven about 7 minutes and that seemd just right but then I was using an older stove and it might run hot.

This is it.  The best.  Perfection.  No lemon or cream of tartar--pure sugar cookies.  I know my cookies. The brown sugar and full tsp. salt give it the perfect combo flavor.  We roll them out fairly thick and they are perfect for cut out shapes.  I have thuroughly child tested this recipe by rolling out and eating.  We all say YUM! Great job, Galia!

We love these cookies!  Every year I try a different sugar cookie recipe for Christmas, but I think this is the one I will continue to use.  We doubled the recipe but used the amount of vanilla for a single batch, and the flavor seemed perfect.  My teenagers cut them out and decorated them, and they are ready to be given as gifts (if they last that long).

I love this recipe and so does everyone in my family and all of my friends.  A little trick my mom taught me for rolling out the dough is putting some flour in the area I'm rolling out in so the dough doesn't stick.  Works like a charm every time.  A cookie that does not last long and the flavour is nice and rich.

I made this exactly the way the recipes calls and they were exelent. I just refridgerated the dough over night. I rolled the balls of dough in between wax paper and it made it much easier to use. Will be making them for christmas again next year.

The brown sugar totally makes these. My husband claimed that these were the "least boring" sugar cookies he's ever had (especially compared to store-bought). Would definitely make again!

I just made these. They taste great...however, the dough is very hard to work with for cookie cutter cookies; would be better for a cookie press. I chilled dough for an hr. but it comes to room temp fast. Because I was making cookie cutter cookies, I ended up taking just an 1/8 of dough out of frig at a time. I rolled it directly onto parchment, used my pretty shaped cookie cutters and removed the residual,leaving the cookie on the parchment. This was much easier than trying to move the cookies, they are too soft for that. Then just lifted the parchment paper onto cookie tray for baking. A bit of a hassle, but they do taste good and look cute too.

Not my favorite tasting sugar cookie recipe, but perfect for using cut-outs and decorating for any holiday! I added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, and was very liberal with the flour when cutting the shapes. Came out perfect.

Horrible, the dough was impossible to roll out, I chilled over an hour and used a bunch of flour but it was so gooey it made a mess, and when I tried to cut a shape out it would rip immediately. I've never had a recipe fail so badly, I am serious

This  is the first time anyone's actually eaten the decorated cookies we make for "Santa"! Easy, tasty, made as described except I chiiled only 45 minutes. Rolled out perfectly.

Nope, not your normal sugar cookie.  Different flavor, didn't care for it at all.  Very thin, was going to decorate for Christmas cookies.

Not sure what I did wrong, but it was sticky even after being in the refrigerator for an hour.  Then they stuck to the cookie sheet and crumbled when I tried to take them off.  I will not be using this one again :(

These taste great, easy to make. Nice and soft inside but a bit crunchy outside. Used Sugar Cookie Icing by:JBS Box.

Very simple recipe for cookie-cutter cookies. They were easy to mix and easy to roll. I rolled to about 1/2 inch thick and baked at 375 x 10 minutes. I will definitely use this recipe again!

the cookies were really good. They have a melt in your mouth flavor. The reason I didn't give this recipie 5 stars is because they cooked in like 5 minutes so when I put them in for 10 and took the first batch out they were burned really badly. But otherwise they were extremely tasty and I loved them!
