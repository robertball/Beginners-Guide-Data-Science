This was tasty! I thought the cucumber gave this a nice, fresh taste and the cream cheese was a nice addition, as well. The only thing I think I would do differently next time is add some thinly sliced red onion, just to kick up the flavor a bit, but that's my personal preference. I only had kaiser rolls, so that's what I used, and that worked well. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

1/13/2014 - Tried this recipe today for my 13 & 16 yr old boys' school lunch.  They loved it!  I did not use the grated cucumbers in the cream cheese but did everything else.  My additions were mustard with the cream cheese and then I added pepper jack cheese to regular hamburger buns.  When these 2 discriminating teenagers make a request to keep this on the rotating lunch menu - it's a winner!!

Followed recipe exactly except served on kaiser rolls instead of bread.  Hubby and I did not care for them. Sorry couldn't give it a better review.

Very good. It is important to use the best roast beef, an English cucumber and a good quality bread. I think next time I will try mascarpone cheese instead of cream cheese for added flavor.
