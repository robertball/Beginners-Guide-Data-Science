I made this but with some changes based on another recipe for a similar appetizer because of the reviews saying it is too bland. I mixed 1/2 a package of taco seasoning mix into the cream cheese mixture before baking, used canned, diced green chiles instead of jalapeno dip, 2 cups of "Mexican Blend" grated cheese and no cottage cheese. I added the remaining taco seasoning to the sour cream topping. It smelled sooooooo good while baking, I could hardly stay out of it! Served with tortilla chips, it went over very well at the potluck I took it to. Everyone is also impressed by how pretty it is with the rings of black olive, tomato and green onion arranged on top. I think a way to avert the soggy bottom crust might be to prebake the crust lined springform pan in the oven for 10 minutes or so. I am going to try that next time.

This was ok, nothing I would rave about. It has a lot of ingredients for the final effect. If I made it again I would leave out the tortilla chips, by the next day they were soggy!

To avoid the soggy crust problems, I simply greased the springform pan, then dusted it with dry breadcrumbs.  I then served it with crackers and tortilla chips, rendering a crust unnecessary.  I substituted sharp cheddar for the Colby.  I mistakenly purchased a can of jalapenos instead of mild green chilis - I ended up using about half the can.  It added a bit of zip, but the rest of the filling really tempered it.  Everyone I served it to asked me how I could cram so much flavor into a little bite, so it was well-received!

Very bland!  This recipe will need to be tweaked ALOT!  My guests agreed.  It is a beautiful presentation, so if you can KICK IT UP A NOTCH with your own personal preference it would be worth it.  Add seasoning, more peppers anything to make it resemble a "southwest" taste. Forget the chips on the botton. Soggy!  Makes enough for a very large party.

I really liked the "back door" warmth of this recipe but I recommend adding one 4 oz. can of diced jalapenos.  There is plenty of fat in the cheeses to tone it down and we had adults and kids enjoying it.  It would not have enough heat without in my opinion.  It's very nice on crackers, celery and, I'm afraid, by the bite.  I just made it again tonight and it was quite a hit.

I just brought this cheesecake to a party and it was a huge hit!  The only revisions I made was to add salt, pepper, chopped jalapenos and a cayenne/chili spice to the "cheese" mix.  I made it with the original ingredients and it was a little bland but the extra additions gave it a delicious kick!  It was easy and great!

I wanted to try this recipe for a Mexican party. It looked really yummy! I found the cheese cake part to be bland, even though I added some hot cheese and extra green chiles. It was also hard to scoop up with tortilla chips as they broke. I don't think I would make this again.

I thought this was a different take on the usual mexican dips.  Everyone loved it!  I replaced the chiles with jalapenos from my garden for an extra kick.

A couple of ideas I've had when making this recipe which is truly a crowd pleaser.
1.  make sure the cream cheese is really soft before adding the eggs to avoid an 'eggy' end product.
2.  you can also do this in a bundt pan and it decorates up very nicely as a wreath.

Must use corn chips for base, always a crowd pleaser and looks so wonderful on the plate.

I was very disappointed about this.  It took up a lot of time to make and it really needed more zip to it.  I added the juice from a can of chopped jalape√±os and taco seasoning to the mix.  It helped a little but we ended up putting salsa on top of it to serve.  I won't be making this again

I made this for an office party.  It was quite simple and looked very attractive.  However: I think next time I will add jalepenos to spice it up a bit.  Otherwise it was good for the milder crowd.

For the amount of time making this and all the ingredients needed this was a disappointment.  The taste was bland and no flavor to it.

This was a very attractive appetizer with the different layers, however, I don't think I'd make it again.  I didn't feel it had alot of flavor.  If I did make it again I would use jalepeno peppers instead of the chillis.  It needed some zip.  I did use the breadcrumbs on the bottom as recommended.  It make a very large portion, good for a big crowd.  I suggest paring down the recipie for smaller crowd for something different and pretty on your table.

5/20/10 Hard to believe I've been making this recipe for 6 years! It's still a favorite of my friends & family. I've made it spicy and mild depending on where I'm going.

4/13/04 This recipe is delicious to the eye and taste. I'm glad that I read the reviews before hand about the crust getting soggy. This recipe works well with low fat products and keeps for several days (with out crust). Very well received.

Turned out very well and was a pretty presentation. As others suggested, I added jalape√±o's, chile powder, extra taco seasoning it was tasty. DH thought it could use a bit more heat, but it was good. I need to find a smaller springform pan to make a smaller version. This serves lots of people.

Baked off the chip crust for 10 minutes, definitely keeps it crispy.  Added taco seasoning, cayenne pepper, chili powder, and salt to batter and that added much needed flavor.  Nothing bland about this with those few changes.  Everyone raved about how good it was and I'm having to provide copies of the recipe to numerous people.  This is the 3rd time I have made this cheesecake and there is never a bite left over!
