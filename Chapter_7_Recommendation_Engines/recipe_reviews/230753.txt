These are fabulous.  First I followed the recipe to a T.  As much as I love them, I have to pump up the fiber and the protein, due to my diabetic husband.  Doing that is a benefit to all whether your diabetic or not.  Gotta watch those carbs when your diabetic or not.  So I bought rolled oats (Bob's red mill) that contained many types of grains with flaxseed.  I use unsweetened coconut, there's no reason to use sweetened coconut, there was virtually no difference.  I add chia seeds (about 1/4 cup).  I also use a local honey.  I do use a crunchy peanut butter.  I also like adding more than a pinch of cinnamon.  Just gives it a little more depth.  These can be quite healthy and stretch out your energy when it dips as long as you can control how many you eat!!!  One last tip: mix the dry ingredients first, makes it all combine better.

FABULOUS, DELICIOUS, SCRUMPTIOUS...you get the idea! Super easy to make, just throw everything into a bowl and mix and roll. The only sight variation I made was to use vanilla nut extract instead of just vanilla, and what a great taste! Highly recommended.  I let them sit overnight and the flavor was even better. I think next time I will use unsweetened coconut to lower the sugar. Nice and chewy and packed with flavor. I will definitely make these again and again. These freeze well too!

Yum! What a nice quick, easy, healthy snack the kids will love! I used organic ingredients except for the coconut. What a great little snack for the kids at school. I will definitely be making these again instead of cookies!

Excellent. I also added some ground flax seed (what the kids don't know...)and a few dark chocolate chips. The flavor is by far the best of the energy balls I've tried. This satisfies my 12 and 9 yr old boys and they reach for these instead of chips! Took me 5 minutes to make them. This recipe is a keeper.

For chocolate topping: combine 3/4 cup coconut oil melted, 3/4 cup cocoa, 3/4 cup powdered sugar and 6 tablespoons of pure maple syrup. Mix well. Add a little hot water if the topping gets too thick. Please note: this amount is for DOUBLE the recipe for energy balls.

The kids and their friends did not care for this at all. All the adults who tried them liked them...especially after finding out they were healthy! I subbed almond butter for peanut butter so I could send them to school. Left out wheat germ because I thought they were dry enough. Much better after sitting 24 hours and the best after 4-5 days. I made balls the first time. Second time I rolled it out between two pieces of plastic wrap and used a heart shaped cookie cutter for Valentine's Day.

Yummy.  I tried 2 other recipes on this website before trying this one and this is by far the best flavor.  I was looking for a protein rich, afterschool snack for kids without a lot of sugar.  This tastes a bit like dark chocolate and doesn't look as bland as other recipes due to the cocoa.  Thanks!

Loved this with finely chopped nuts in place of the wheat germ.  Took it to a gathering where some are gluten-free & since I used gf oats, they could indulge also!  Will be playing with amping up the nutrients even higher next go-round.

These are even more yummy than I thought they would be.  I did add a little more oats, probably used almost one cup.  I used my cookie scoop instead of rolling them in my hands, so they were a little smaller.  They have a wonderful flavor.  Thank for sharing your awesome recipe Tamsz.

Excellent snack! Didn't have wheat germ, used protein powder instead and added a little granola.

These are delicious! Very rich and flavorful. Didn't have rolled oats so used steel cut oats. They still turned out great. Put them in the freezer to set for an hour, then ate one and finally into the fridge. Very quick, easy and chocolatey.

Oh so good! I used Nestum cereal instead of oats because that is what I had on hand, and left out wheat germ because I didn't have any. I didn't measure exact amounts, kind of dumped it all in. Definitely better the next day. To the reviewer who said that this was best after 4-5 days, I don't think that this will last that long! I made these into small little balls, so that each one is snack sized. Yummy!

The flavor of these was okay. I give the recipe about a 3.5. I just didn't care much for the texture. I think they would have been better with ground nuts over peanut butter and the rolled oats were just in too big of pieces and chewy. It might have been better with quick oats or grinding the rolled oats some in a blender. They are a little like raw brownies, but without the ground walnuts, almonds, or other grains which is neccessary for just the right texture imo.

These were easy to make and healthy too.  They reminded me of no-bake chocolate cookies but without all the extra sweetness and sugar added in.

This recipe was a huge hit with my two adult health-conscious kids. It's like having dessert, but it's good for you! I used almond butter instead of peanut butter and I added 1/3 cup chopped almonds. I also used ground flaxseed instead of wheat germ, because that's what I had on hand. Throw in a TSP of chia seeds to add even more nutrition! I will definitely make these again.

Super easy to make and tastes great, clean up was easy as well.  I added a bit of maple syrup because I was low on honey and crushed peanuts because I didn't have any coconut.

I love how easy these are, and they're so good for you and the kids.  I'm not sure, but I'm thinking honey isn't good for small children, so I made some w/o the honey, and they are just as good!

An easy and delicious snack or dessert  recipe! Because I think more is better, I rolled the balls smaller and will be able to have 2 instead of 1 for my serving :)

these were excellent!.  I just swapped out protein powder in place of the coconut because I don't like coconut . I also used quick cooking oats because they are smaller.  I used about 1/2 honey and 1/2 maple syrup and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  helps to chill dough before making the balls.

I made the recipe exactly, and added a bit of ground flaxseed. They have excellent flavor, easy as anything to mix up and I love having something this good for me in the fridge where I can grab it on the go. I will double the recipe next time. It's easier to make good choices when it's this convenient and tasty.

Very tasty! I modified this to minimize the sugar by using 1/3 of chocolate flavored whey protein powder instead of cocoa powder and left out the wheat germ; I only used as much honey as necessary to make the mixture stick, which I would guess was between 3-4 tablespoons -- far less than 1/3 of a cup. If I'd had more peanut butter on hand, I suppose I could have upped that slightly and so cut down the honey even further. The results were DELICIOUS. Lots of energy and lots of protein without much sugar = win!

In general these are pretty good, but I had to add some softened butter to get them to stick together, which made them lose a little of the 'healthy' appeal. A nice treat when you don't want to end up feeling too guilty, though!

With such an all star cast of ingredients, I expected these to taste much better. My family would not eat them at all. Sorry. I think that maybe they would be a bit better with one less ingredient? So one or two can shine instead of all of them mashed together?

My son is suuuuper picky and he loved them! My tip is to put the oats and coconut in a food processor to make it more fine prior to mixing with the other ingredients. Kids can be turned off by textures sometimes. I told him it was similar to a Reese’s peanut butter cup with “cereal crunchies” in it ;)

Just put them in fridge... I didn't have any wheat germ, so I substituted same amount of hemp seeds.  Also rolled them in powdered sugar, so they wouldn't be as sticky.  Recipe made 15 balls, could've been 16 if they were all uniform :).

This was awful. The chocolate overpowered all the other flavors and it was very bitter

I was a little too generous with the cocoa powder and forgot the vanilla so mine ended up a little dry. Will try again, excited to play around with this recipe.

I made these adding almonds and granola and chocolate chips.  Made the treats with plastic ice cube trays which make perfect bites and they just pop out.

My 7 year old son and I loved these!  I cut the honey down to 1/4 cup and may even cut more the next time as they were plenty sweet.  I was worried about them being too dry and tough to roll especially when I used the bulk peanut butter ground at the store.  However they rolled nicely for both my son and me.  It was a great recipe to have my child help with the measuring and the rolling.  The stirring was pretty tough but we finally just used our hands!

These are great. Made the recipe without the wheat germ just crushed up some extra oats. One minute oats might be better as there is some crunch depending on your preference of textures. Made these twice in 1 week and will keep them in the healthy snack arsenal.

Easy and satisfying! Subbed Sunflower seed butter for peanut butter and chia seeds for the wheat germ. Next time I will add flax seed. Can’t wait to make them again! As a breastfeeding Momma these really helped boost my supply.

these were great!  I found the better very very sticky so I think I should have mixed a bit more. you could easily swap for cashew butter (which I used)  it almond butter for a slight variation.  no added sugar there was enough natural sweetness that I didn't miss it!

These are so good!  I love how they turn out and my kids love them.  I add chia seeds and flax seeds to mine, both about 1/4 cup and they still turn out great.  Also, instead of putting cocoa powder in all of them i cut the recipe in half and half gets cocoa powder and the other half gets chocolate chips (more for the kids) and they are DELICIOUS!

I omitted the wheat germ because I didn't have any. So I added in finely chopped, toasted walnuts. Other than that, followed the recipe. I was surprised that they very tasty and satisfying. Love that it's so easy and quick to make!

My first time attempting healthy food (better late than never, right?) so I followed the recipe to a T. It's good, but the honey is overpowering. Next time I make it I will definitely use less honey.

Fast, easy, fairly nutritious. Only thing to say is the batch only lasted a couple hours, will have to double the recipe for next time. Even better than cookies!

I love, love, love, these, and so does my husband.  A great snack that also gives you a little bit of sweet.  I did leave out the coconut (because I do not like it) and also used ground flax instead of  wheat germ.  Thank you  - I have already made several batches!!!

I like making these & having on hand when sweet cravings hit. I always put the container in my fridge at eye level so they can't be ignored. I changed the recipe to what I had on hand. Honey, peanut butter, vanilla, oats, hemp seeds, chia & flax along with coconut flakes & ground Saigon cinnamon. The first batch the hubby & I flew through. So this batch, I doubled. Would probably be good with dried fruit. May add craisins next time. Yummz. Thx for submitting this easy, quick treat.

I made this last night. I omitted the wheat germ since I'm avoiding wheat. It's messy to make but turned out pretty good. Keep in mind they are "healthy" tasting...which I'm training my taste buds to eat more natural and avoid processed food. My husband thought they were good, but my teenage son did not. I'm still looking for a healthy recipe that is teenager approved.

Very good, I made these before but this time I substituted gluten free oats and sunflower seeds instead of the wheat germ. They are quick and great for a pick me up snack or for kids on the go.
