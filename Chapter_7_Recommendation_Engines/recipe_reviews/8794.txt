If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would!  This was FABULOUS : )  I just made this last night, although I did make some slight changes.  I used chicken breasts, instead of thighs, and increased the olive oil to 3 Tbls.  I also seasoned the chicken liberally (before browning in oil) with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I also cooked the onions much longer than the recipe stated (about 13 minutes) because I like to get my onions really carmalized and bring out their flavor-be careful not to burn them!  I served the chicken with oven roasted potatoes as suggested (I used yukon gold potatoes, quarted them, and tossed them with olive oil, cumin, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika-baked at 475 degrees for 20 minutes) and I did toss the potatoes with the onion mixture.  Very, very simple and it tastes out of this world!  Do not be fooled by it's simplicity, and do not hesitate to add your own spices as this recipe is a wonderful base that can be adjusted to suit any palate.  A +++++

I tried this recipe twice. I liked it. Although, The second time I added a few dashes of spices like:garlic powder, paprika, chicken bouillion, & turmeric during the simmer stage. It made the recipe taste even better!

this is REALLY good.  I chopped the thighs into small pieces and seasoned them first w/ paprika, garlic, soul seasoning, & pepper.  made according to directions.  5 min before finishing I added 1.5 Tablespoons of flour to 1 cup sour cream and added it to the sauce.  OH, it's sooo good!

I found this recipe while looking for someway to cook thighs. At first I thought it was way to simple to be good, but I had all the ingredients, so I gave it a shot. It is delicious, and a huge hit, even with my 2 very picky children (5 & 13). 

Couple of tips: season the chicken with salt, pepper and a little paprika before you saute, use a very large onion (my favorite part of this recipe is the sauce), and use chicken stock instead of the water. Serve it over rice with some extra sauce...yum! 

I've tried doubling the sauce recipe and it doesn't come out as good. So I've started doubling the entire recipe using 2 pans, boneless breasts in one and thighs in the other. (I start the thighs first since they take longer to cook.)

Great recipe...simple but delicious!

My husband and I love this recipe! It's one of his all-time favorites.  I do, however, try to use a VERY large onion and we still don't get quite enough sauce for our taste.

A Keeper for sure. I made this last night and my extremely picky teenager had seconds! After reading other comments, I too added more spices, course ground sea salt, course pepper, paprika, garlic powder, basil, and sauted the onions just alittle longer than 5 minutes. I also used chicken stock instead of water. This ends up being a very juicy, sweet chicken dish.

Although I probably won't make this again (there are so many great chicken recipes to try) this was a nice dish.  I added extra seasoning on the advice of previous reviewers and served with roasted potatoes and broccoli.  I also carmelized the onions longer than the recipe called for.  Instead of water I used homemade unsalted chicken broth.  The sauce was very pleasant.

This was very good, easy to make and low cost. My only changes were based on some of the other reviews. I used chicken breasts, cubed, as I did not have thighs. I seasoned them with Mortons Seasoning Salt, paprika and garlic powder. I used about three small onions and instead of 2 cups of water I used about a cup of white wine and a cup of water. This made a delicious sauce that required no additional thickening agents. I served my boyfriends to him over pasta and mine over some green beans, both tossed in the onion sauce. Very good, will be sure to keep this recipe on hand.

Yum!  So easy and good!  I used a lot of salt and paprika and browned the chicken in that before adding the onions.  (used boneless skinless thights and it worked great--just cook for less time).  One thing to note--I served this over a brown basmati/wild rice blend, and I felt the rice flavor overpowered the subtle flavor of the chicken and onions.  I think serving this with potatoes or white rice is the way to go with this dish.  Will definitely make again!

My husband loved this dish over rice! I added some oregano, rosemary, and parsley. You really need a large onion in order to have enough gravy.

Little bland, but not bad.  Sauce also works on rice.  Use a VERY large onion.

This was pretty good. The taste was very mellow. Almost bland, in my opinion but I prefer spicier dishes, I guess.

I did everything the same except I added paprika and garlic.

I absolutely love this recipe. It reminded me of a dish my own grandmother used to make when I was a child. It is the simplicity of this recipe that makes it so good. Sometimes simple is better...and this recipe proves it!

Absolutely great!  I seasoned the chicken with some salt, pepper, paprika and all seasoning mix.  I used 2 onions instead of just one and it was good.

I like that this dish has so few ingredients, but I found it to be kind of blah.  It reminded me of chicken n dumplings or chicken soup... I don't know why I expected it to taste differently!

This is so very tasty.  The day it first posted, I saw Emeril L. create a recipe very similar on TV.  I tried it that night and the family LOVED it!!  I was hesitant about buying/eating thighs because we are so used to breasts, but the thighs definitely lent a very special scrumptious taste to this super easy dish.  I did add a few spices - garlic pepper/salt, and added extra water because we really enjoyed the sauce.  A winner.

Turned out incredible. I was worried it would be like a boiled chicken soup-like thing, but the onions caramalized well. Remember - don't simmer on low - I didn't read the recipe right at first. I simmered on medium high, stirring regularly. Yum.

This turned out quite well, though I think it would definitely benefit from seasoning the chicken a bit before browning. It seemed to take a long time for the onions to caramelize - they actually didn't until about 1/2 way through the 30 minute cooking time when I almost let the pan go dry. I then added more water, and it made a nice, tasty sauce. 

Be forewarned, if you're sensitive to the smell of onions cooking (that is, if onions tear you up), you may have to mostly avoid your kitchen until the onions caramelize - it's pretty powerful! ;)

Probably good IF you add a lot of seasoning - pepper, garlic powder, paprika, Lawry's.  Chicken came out dry but this was so easy that I can't really complain too much.  Made with Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed (skins on) quartered, tossed with olive oil, garlic powder, a little paprika, and Lawry's.

This recipe is so simple, requires few ingredients and is absolutely delicious...so much flavor!!  I carmelized my onions until nice and golden brown and used chicken stock instead of water for added flavor. I served it with brown rice and a vegetable. Yummy!  I will definitely make it again!

This is a very easy recipe and has good results. Chicken was very tender and moist. Have never cooked with thigh meat before and this was a good start for me. I substituted 14 oz of chicken broth for most of the water.

The whole family loved this !!
I only changed a couple of things to suit us... I chopped the boneless chicken thighs in to large chunks and added some basil, parsley, oregano and garlic when the water went in .. and right at the end (just because my kids love gravey) I added some gravey powder mixed with a little water and then let it heat until thick... yummmy. My boys all had seconds and hubby cleaned the pan !!! Thanks the Aussies loved it

I give this 4 and a half - very tasty and easy prep.  I love a chicken thigh, they make everything better.  I used boneless, skinless thighs - still tender and flavorful w/o bone.  Great easy recipe, thanks!

I can't believe the flavor that comes out of this dish! With only a handful of ingredients that I always have on hand, this will be a definite keeper. I mixed in my broccoli and it tasted great.

I had very high hopes for this after reading the reviews. This is a good recipe over all, it is just very bland. I will probably be trying again, with a few seasoning modifications.

I was unsure how this would turn out since the recipe is so simple.  I tried it out last night and it was awesome!  I also seasoned the chicken with garlic and salt before browning.  I didn't have chicken stock so I threw a chicken buillon while it was simmering and served over rice.  Very tasty.

Wow!!! Talk about good!  I made this in my RV, mostly because I was craving chicken thighs and didn't want to have to buy a lot of stuff.  This fit the bill.  I used lo-so chicken broth rather than water.  And it was still a bit salty so I would suggest being careful with salting the meat in the beginning.  Next time, I'll make sure to really brown the onions well at the start as they don't get any browner later on.  If you don't want it to "watery", just keep cooking it, to boil down the liquid 'til you get to the consistency you want.  I served this with crusty bread and that was PERFECT to soak up that wonderful liquid.  Wouldn't serve this without crusty bread down the road.  This is one of the best things I've ever made in the RV!!

No flavor. I even added, salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and paprika to the chicken before browning. The only posative thing about this dish is that it was moist. My husband thought that it would be great for tacos, because you add so much other stuff to it that you will not notice the lack of flavor.
I don't think i will make this again. If I do it will be for tacos!

This is a perfect weeknight dish! I was suprised how flavorful the dish is with such little ingredients. I did however add a little fresh squeezed lime juice and cayenne pepper. This is a really great dish for someone who doesnt have the time or energy to cook up something fancy or is on a budget!

Like other posters, go skinless. This could easily also be done with breasts or other chicken parts. Changes I'll make next time: use chicken broth instead of water. When the chicken was done, I added some corn starch to thicken the sauce and I should have let it cook and thicken just a bit more as it was pretty runny. I did pair it up with roasted potatoes and carrots and drizzled the sauce on it as well. Oh, and for my taste, it needs a decent amount of salt and pepper. And when I heated the olive oil I added a generous tablespoon of diced garlic.

Pretty good!! I just finished cleaning up the mess i made making this and more for dinner. I didn't follow this recipe to the T but it was my base for perfection. I had 8 chicken thighs but only put 2 cups of chicken broth (instead of water). I found it was a good amount of sauce i'd say. I first seasoned the chicken with a Caribbean steak sauce to give it some spice, as well as garlic powder, salt and pepper. To cook the chicken I used Coconut oil instead of olive oil. I used a very large onion and a tray of pre-sliced mushrooms. cooked it all together on high-medium for about 30 minutes to really get the onions really moist and let some of the water evaporate. when i was almost done i added about a tablespoon of butter to give it a smooth taste. I served it with mashed sweet potatoes (really good with the liquid from the sauce!!) and steamed spinach with fresh garlic. Overall it was really good. I made enough for leftovers too!

This recipe was so simple, I don't know why I never thought about it for myself! I love the idea of simmering the chicken in water, because it keeps the meat moist. I added scallions and mushrooms to mine when they were almost done. I think I will use chicken broth instead of water the next time I make this, to kind of give it a richer flavor.

Just made this dish it's really good I did end up using more spices just like others posted garlic salt and poultry seasoning instead of water I used chicken stalk but the 2cups was a little to much but it worked! I poured the sauce all over our roasted potatoes and veggies ;) I also carmalized the onion with a spoon full of minced garlic yummy...

Wonderful! I added my own touch and this recipe gives plenty of leeway to do that.  I used stock instead of plain water, put  the ovenproof skillet  in a 385 oven for 40 min. Removed chicken and further reduced braising liquid. thickening with wondra flour while whisking and added 2t butter to finish.  and give a velvety sheen to the gravy. I served it over steamed basmati rice.

I made this for dinner tonight. It was delicious. I did use chicken stock instead of water. Please forgive me for not staying true to the original recipe, which I usually do. I read some of the reviews and couldn't resist and it was so good that my family wants it again tomorrow night. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This was very good. I didn't think there would be enough sauce but there was.  I almost burnt the sauce because the water evaporated quickly. I recommend keeping a close watch on it as it is cooking.

This did not look anything like the picture.  It needed a lot more browning.  The skin got stuck to the pan and broke away.  It never got brown but the taste was o.k. although there was a lot of sauce.

My picky husband and daughter were skeptical when I added this recipe to our menu, but they both loved it. I've made it twice. The second time I tried to substitute broth for the water. It gave it more of a chicken gravy flavor and the onions didn't caramelize. I will stick to the original; it's a family-pleaser!

Perfect! The only thing I changed was patting the chicken dry first with paper towels and seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper first instead of after adding the onions and water. Amazing how simple and delicious this recipe is.

This was terrible.  I did not care for it at all.  Pretty much tasteless.  My boyfriend took one bite and that was it.  Now I'll try to figure out what to do with the leftover chicken.  And I made it according to the directions.

We made it with chicken breasts, added extras onions, sauted the onions longer, and added four and a tablespoon of sour cream to the sauce and served over rice.   It was delicious!

I added paprika, garlic powder, salt & pepper before I cooked the chicken.  I added a splash of white wine and chicken broth instead of the water.  There could have been more gravy as I served it over rice.  Was easy to fix and had a good flavor.

My family loved this and it was so simple and quick.  I had all ingredients on hand because there are so few.  I used chicken strips because that's all I had and it came out delicious.  I think I needed more onions to get the carmelized affect but it still turned out great.  My husband always says chicken is either too dry or else comes out too wet like it's not cooked well but this was perfect.  He loved it and said it was just right.  Will definitely make again and will try other spices to change it up.  LOVED IT!

We pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees. We put 2 table spoons of olive oil in a pan, and put the chicken on it. Then we diced the onions and put mushrooms on top of the chicken. Now in the oven for 30 minutes.  Let's see how it turns out.

This is my second time making this meal this week!! I tried it earlier in the week (Tuesday) and my husband and son (7) fell in love with it and requested it again today (Friday) this is such a delicious meal that is super easy to make. I also make the potatoes that were suggested by another reviewer in this recipe. I will definitely be making this over and over for yours to come.

When the water was mostly evaporated and the chicken was cooked I added some butter and flour to make a quick rue. It was a little bland, next time I'll add garlic, chili powder, lime and some bell peppers to the mix.

I followed the recipe exactly, however, it took about an hour for the water to evaporate and the sauce to thicken, and it was still to watery. It ended up being more of a broth than actual sauce. Perhaps it was because the sauce was watery and did no justice to the chicken but the flavor was only decent.I'm truly sorry but it was not delicious and it's something I would not do again.

This was ok nothing extra special. I will be moving soon and was looking for ways to use the chicken thighs in my deep freezer. I made the recipe as stated. There were enough onions for my husband and myself but thankfully my kids are picky eaters so we didn't need more of the sauce. If I were to make this for others I would increase the onions and add in some more seasonings like garlic.

I had my doubts something so simple could be so good!!!  Took another reviewers advice about roasted potatoes! Great dinner!!
