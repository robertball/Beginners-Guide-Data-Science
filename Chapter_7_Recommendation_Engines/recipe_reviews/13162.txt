I discovered this one a while back and it's terrific!  I've made it at least 10 times now and what's wonderful about this recipe is that when you follow the directions, and you take that first taste, it's perfect.    I read the other reviews and i agree, 4 cups is not alot of water, but  the vegetables will release alot of water;  however, I use two KNORR SWISS beef boullion cubes  which makes 2 cups of broth per cube, and i add an additional two cups of water, totalling six cups when i start out.  This leaves me with plenty of broth.  Another thing though, is if you like spicy, just remember, the cabbage tends to get sweet when you cook it, so you might consider leaving it out, but since I'm a gringo, I'm not a fan of burn my mouth out  spicy food, so this soup is the perfect balance and absolutely delicious.   Oh, and one other thing,  I found that by chopping up some fresh cilantro and sprinkling it on top of each bowl when i serve it adds a real fragrant and authentic finish to this soup. Try it, and you'll never eat this soup againwithout it .  Thanks  Beatrice for making me happy.

I really liked this. The first time I made it as is. The second time I used 1 tsp cumin powder, no seeds, 3 cups chopped cabbage, rather than wedges and added a 1/2 cup frozen corn. It's a very pretty, tasty, spicy soup. Absolutely will make it again. It's perfect for the -20C temperatures were having here!

This was ok. The broth was nice and spicy but the meatballs  were a little bland. I increased the boullion to 3 cubes and water to 6 cups because initially there didn't seem to be enough broth. If I made again I would probably add a little rice to it. I simmered it for an hour just to make sure the meat was done.

This was VERY tasty!  The meatballs did tend to fall apart a bit while cooking in the broth, but it didn't matter because the flavor was sooooo good!  The leftovers were equally enjoyable!

Excellant! I used broth rather than boullion. Wouldn't hurt to add 1-2 cups more liquid but it turned out great and was easy to make.

Super yummy.  I didn't add the cabbage because I didn't have any, and since we have little ones, I skipped the pepper flakes.  I did use 2 more cups of water (with added bouillon.)  Everything else stayed the same.  I don't know how big "tiny" is, but I made my meatballs about an inch each.  Next time I'll make them a bit smaller so they will be bite-size for the kids.

My entire family liked this recipe, so I will be adding this recipe to my collection.  (esp. for cold winter nights!)  Yum!

I really, really liked this recipe - though I changed it a bit. I used less than 1 c. uncooked white rice instead of the bread and 10 cups of water & 4 cubes of bouillon and I still wished I made it soupier. This was a very flavorful broth and I followed the spices by the recipe (but omitted cumin seed bc I didn't have any). I can't imagine how strong it would've been w a lb of beef and only 4 cups of water. Thanks for the recipe!!

I absolutely love to make this especially when its cold out.  I like to chop cilantro and add to the meatball mixture.  We eat it with fresh lime juice squeezed in and tostadas.  Yummy and so easy to make. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a wonderful on a cold day!  I used 6 cups of water with additional bouillon to match, and also seasoned the meatballs with salt, pepper, cumin, coriander and chili powder for a more flavorful meatball.  Also omitted the cumin seed and added a teaspoon of ground coriander.  I didn't have any celery left in the fridge, so I substituted 2 white zucchini, which I think I prefer.

LOVED THIS SOUP!  While my husband was still eating this he was telling me to add this to our rotation of soups.  I think he went back for three servings.  I didn't have cumin seeds so I just didn't use them.  I had already browned the ground beef when I found this recipe so I didn't bother making meatballs therefore I didn't have to use bread crumbs or egg; I just added the onion and garlic to the soup after saute them with the carrots and celery for a few minutes.  I only had a 28oz can of tomatoes so I used it all instead of spliting the can.  The rest of the recipe I followed.  I had about a cup of cooked ground hot italian sausage in the fridge so I added it to the soup a few minutes before serving just to get rid of the left over kicking up the heat of the soup a little more.  Will be making this soup plenty of times durning the cool winter months.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is very tasty.  Love the flavor of the soup.  I added rice to the meat mixture as I often do when cooking albondigas.  Very easy to make!

This was sooo good! My family is a mix of Nicaraguan and the other side Mexican, and this is very similar to soups we make.
I left out the celery (i forgot!) and made homemade salsa verde, using 4 tamatillos, jalepeno, onion and cilantro. 
What a nice recipe. Thank you!

I've used this recipe for 5yrs now and its great minus the cabbage. I'm not fan of it. My husband who isn't a fan of soups, loves this recipe. I always more water for the the broth. Recipe isn't enough other than that, its great! We love to add lemon and drink with a corona beer to ease the spice! Oh so yummy!

I loved it! I took the advice of someone else and added some cilantro on top as well as some finely chopped green onions and one tablespoon of jalapeno shredded cheese. My husband and I like our food spiced up, so I did double all of the spice ingredients and added some additional salt at the very end. Additionally, I used soy meatballs that I put in right before serving instead of the beef. If any of you do weight watchers, this soup has a great broth and great vegetables, therefore, a great variation to their famous zero point vegetable soup-- minus the beef of course.

This was a really good soup. My only complaint was that the meatballs didn't have quite enough flavour. Next time I will add some garlic and onion powder and salt and pepper to them.

We really enjoyed it.  Followed recipe exactly with the exception of using ground buffalo instead of ground beef.  Next time, will add a pinch of salt to the meatball mixture. Tasted even better the next day.

I made so many changes, I should probably be submitting what I made as a different recipe but, they never post my recipes so, here goes. I sort of combined this recipe with others I found on the internet. First of all, I found a recipe for Alton Brown's meatballs and they were so different from any meatball I've ever made but, the recipe had great reviews so I gave it a try, using ground turkley in place of the ground pork, lamb & beef Alton Brown uses. They were incredible! The recipe is easy to find if you google for it. Back to this recipe, I doubled the oregano and cumin and left out the green pepper & celery though I did add some celery salt to get the celery flavor. I also shredded the cabbage instead of adding in wedges and I squeezed a lime wedge over the bowl of spoup just before serving.  This was so good, I ate the leftover soup for lunch every day until it was gone.

This was great!  It has simple ingredients however an abundance of flavor!  I added a 1/2lb of hamburger to increase number of meatballs, added an additional bouillon cube and 2 cups of water for more broth.  Delicious!!

So good!  The broth itself is very tasty!  I am only giving 4 stars because I didn't make the recipe exact (didn't have cumin seeds, so I used 1 tsp of cumin powder, didn't add the pepper flakes so it wouldn't be too hot for my kids, used italian bread crumbs instead of crumbled bread).  Also, next time I think I may skip the bell pepper.  I don't think it really added anything special, I won't miss it.  My husband and son both raved the whole time we were eating!  Thanks for this great, easy recipe!

I was looking at the other Albondigas Soups and decided to try this one. Well I am so glad I did because my husband loved it. He had been telling me to make this type of dish for quite a while but since I had never made it before I was afraid it would not come out good. So glad I found this site. Love it!!! I omitted the cabbage and instead of red pepper flakes. I added a dry red pepper just for taste. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I had high hopes for this. Not very spicy and a little bland. I'm giving a 4 because I altered the taste by using ground turkey. Otherwise I would have given a 3.

I made this soup tonight for dinner and it was yummy!!  The only things I did different was substitute green beans and corn for the cabbage and peppers, because we didn't have any.  And made the meatballs beforehand.  I cooked them in the oven for 25 min at 350 degrees.  I would make this again! Thanks for the great idea!

This recipe is really good. It didn't state it in the recipe, but I added about a teaspoon of salt to the meatball mixture because everyone knows you have to add salt to your protein or else it will be bland. I substituted dry bread crumbs and also doubled the amount because they felt too soggy and wouldn't hold their shape. To reduce some of the fat, I baked the meatballs on a cooling rack so the fat could drip onto a cookie sheet for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees F. I did everything else according to the recipe and I added 1 pound of dry red kidney beans as a bit of a filler.

Pretty darn good....I added a bit of masa harina to thicken it up, and a couple of jalepenos.  Wonderful with corn tortillas roasted over the open flame of my gas range.  5 stars if hot peppers were in the ingredient list!

Terrific!  I added uncooked rice (1/2 cut) to the meat.  This holds the meat together well.  Also use Tapatio hot sauce/lemon or lime juice, and corn tortilla's for dipping and you will love it!!  
Thank you

This was tasty and hubbie liked it too. I didnt have cabbage or celery, so used some fresh tomato and zuccini instead. Also good without the cumin seed.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  My husband is hispanic and he thought it was real tasty and authentic.  I substituted the cans of stewed tomatoes with Hunt’s tomato sauce because I don’t care for canned tomatoes. I then cut 6 roman tomatoes into large chunks and added it to the soup.  I would definitely make this again!

My bf loved this soup but I thought it could have been better.  I agree with the other reviewer who said that they didn't like the sweetness in the soup from the cabbage.  Next time I would omit the cabbage for these reasons.  I would also add more oregano and probably salt and pepper the meatballs before making small meatballs.

Great base recipe. You can do yourself a favor by livening up the meatballs. I used uncooked rice instead of bread, then added garlic and onion powder, coarse sea salt, and fresh cracked pepper. Also added diced potatoes and cilantro. Boom.

Delicious!! My whole family of picky eaters enjoyed this. Reminds me of the soup my grandma made when I was a kid. I read some of the reviews and did add 6 cups of water instead of the couple, and used 4 bouillion cubes, 3 might have just been fine but I was being cautious. Made plently. Going to make again tonight by request!

This is the first Albondigas Soup I've ever had, so I can't compare it to others but it is really good.  I almost double the meat and definitely double the spices.  I use Napa Cabbage instead of the awful green stuff.  It's good for a light dinner which is how we always have it.  A+

This soup was good-  all 3 of my boys loved it and asked me to make it again. It was a lot like a taco-flavored soup.  I didn't have any cabbage to put in it, but I think that would have made it even better.

I made a vegetarian version with no meatballs.

I've had this in several restaurants.  It never includes cabbage and always includes onion, so I omitted the cabbage and added 3/4 of a lg onion (chopped).  Since I did not have fat from the meat, I also added 1-2 tbsp of oil.  Came out just like the restaurant versions sans the meat.

While I didn't try the meatballs, I notice that the meatball ingredients do not include rice.  If you want an authentic version of this soup,  substitute onion for the cabbage and find a meatball recipe with rice.

I made this last week and was terribly disappointed!!  None of us could finish our bowls.  The broth was bland and the meatballs were just horrible.  If I want to make Albondigas soup again I'll use the recipe simply titled Albondigas from this site.  Now there is a delicious soup!!!

Delicious, even when I changed a few things to our taste. Mixed some chorizo in w/the ground beef, and mixed the spices (chili powder, oregano, cumin, +cayenne & garlic powder) in with meatballs as well as the soup. Added uncooked rice to meatballs and cooked 15-20 min. in 2 qts. boiling water/stock (til rice was done) before adding the veggies/spices to the soup. Skipped bell pepper & carrots, added chopped onion, and used shredded cabbage instead of wedges. Served with lime to squeeze over and pickled carrots/jalapenos on the side. YUM! Will definitely make again. (Note: authentic Mexican albondigas will have yerba buena (spearmint) in it as well, but our family doesn't like it so much.. so this recipe is perfect for us! THANKS!)

Too watery, need to use bone broth as a base to start. Used family recipe for meatballs as the suggested one was bland and unsatisfying. Boil broth with jalapeño for a more satisfying kick. Unsatisfied, but an ok recipe.

I replaced the sliced bread with cauliflower rice (approx 3 cups)  to make this gluten free and low carb.   These turned out really great.  Very tender.  I also added zucchini and the cabbage close to the end of the cooking time so it wasn't too over cooked.   It was delicious and will be making it often.

Made this today, it's pouring down rain, & what a great recipe to cook... My house smelled wonderful with all the spices & veggies in this soup.. My husband RAVED at how good it was too, so this will be in my ''rotation'' for Winter Soups... I didn't have ''stewed tomatoes'', so I just added two fresh chopped ones.. No other changes were made... It's a ''KEEPER'' !!

The meatballs need seasoning!  Try adding garlic powder, salt and pepper, minced cilantro and minced tomato to the meat mixture.  Then use 1/3 c long grain rice and a Tblsp of flour instead of the bread crumbs in the meatball mix.  The broth qty is off.  Add more water/bouillon or a box of beef broth.  Adjust all seasonings to compensate for added broth.  A little less cabbage or none at all works, add chopped zucchini.  Basic outline of ingredients is good; but needs a little tweaking...  Meatballs are so much better my way!

This is a great-tasting soup! I will definitely make again. Not enough liquid to cover the cabbage (maybe my cabbage was too large?), but I stuck with the recipe as written and it all turned out okay.

I have made this soup multiples times. It is perfect just as written.  It’s also a good way to use up that half head of cabbage that always seems to be in the crisper drawer!

The flavor of this soup was fantastic.  However, cooking the meatballs in the broth made it too greasy for our taste.  Next time I will brown the meatballs, drain the grease and then add the broth, veggies and seasonings.

I have made this a few times and each time it gets a little better. I read some of the other reviews and I doubled the broth and used 8 cups of water and 4 bullion cubes.  I also used rice instead of bread crumbs and my meatballs do not crumble.  I also add fresh cilantro and some rotelle tomatoes and its perfect!

Great recipe... I also added more water and beef bullion. Added crushed ritz crackers in place of bread crumbs, lipton beefy onion soup mix, and mustard to the meatball, of course added the onion power, garlic salt, egg, a little water, and pepper. Then formed meatballs and rolled in flour to thicken the soup. Added lots of veggies including potatoes and zucchini, in addition to the carrots, celery, cabbage, and green pepper. Increased the cumin and chili powder, and left out the cumin seeds. Delicious...

We really liked this soup. I'd give it five stars, but I made a few minor changes, and I think without them it would have been less of a success. First, like other reviewers have mentioned, as written it needs more liquid. I upped it to six cups of water and three bullion cubes. The only other change I made was the addition of a healthy shot of lime juice at the end of the cook time. The acid really seemed to wake the flavor up, and I wouldn't make it again without it. That all being said, the bones of this recipe are great and I'll happily make it again.

I really used this recipe as a model since I switched up a lot of Ingredients. I used turkey instead of ground beef and breadcrumbs instead of one slice of bread. I used green chilies instead of bell peppers and I did not have any cumin so I added a little taco seasoning. I added one more cup of water because it just wasn't enough water. It came out great but the turkey meatballs fell apart. Not sure how to fix that. Maybe adding one more egg. Garnish with chopped cilantro to make it pretty. Deliciously flavorful and spicy soup!

Just made this and I believe I'm going to like it but skipped making the meatballs and used seasoned ground beef. My plan is to pour a scoop over some corn chips, top with chedder and sour cream. And only add the red pepper to my bowl. Thanks!

I love this! It's one of my family favorites have made many times my husband is from Mexico and says it tastes like home.  The only thing I do differently is double the water and beef stock and add about six heaping spoonfuls of rice while it simmers.  Thank you for the recipe, if you wanting to make a delicious easy soup this is it.

Delicious! Read the reviews about the tasteless meatballs so I cooked up some brown rice to replace the bread and added 1 t each of taco seasoning & cumin powder along with 1/2 t of dried oregano.  That made the meatballs good by themselves and followed everything else.  So good!

This is just the thing my  family needed on a cold rainy night!  I prepped the meat the day before. I added a couple tbls of beef broth paste along with some dried onion, chilie powder, chipotle powder. I didn't have cumin seed so I just used more ground cumin. I heated up some beef rice and ladeled the soup over it. Heated up the flour tortillas and Voila! My hubby is Still talking about this soup:)  This was delicious!! Thank You very much Beatrice. Winner Winner meatball dinner!

Excellent!  I add 1 c. white uncooked rice+use 3/4 tsp chili powder instead of 1/2tsp as rice absorbs quite a bit. Then add 1/4c taco sauce. Serve w/warm tortillas & salsa. This makes it a one step meal

I would give this 5 stars but I did veer from the recipe a bit by baking my meatballs first and adding in a bit more garlic. I loved the addition of the cabbage and finished it off with a bit of lemon...very good thank you!!

Very good but I had to add more beef stock base (concentrated stock) to give the soup more flavor. I made smaller servings for this soup yet it was still very hearty.
