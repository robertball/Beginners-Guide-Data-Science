Oh no!   Don't know what happened but this did NOT work.  Are you sure that it is 1/3 cup of water to simmer the dill seed in?  The water kept evaporating in the pan before the seeds had simmered for 10 minutes.  Then I added the honey and dry buttermilk mix and ended up with globs of honey/seed/seasoning that would NOT whisk into the rest of the dressing mixture.  UGH - this after I made a special trip to the grocery for dill SEED vs. dill WEED.

I used skim milk in place of buttlermilk.  And dill weed instead of running to the store for dill seed.  My 9 yr old can't get enough of these cucumbers...and she puts them on her salad!!

This was the perfect compliment to our summer BBQ meal. It had a mild lovely flavor that calmed spicy sausages really nicely. Everyone loved it. I didn't read it clearly and forgot the mayo, so I used a bottle of light buttermilk ranch dressing with the honey and the dill and it came out fantastic. Thanks for the great recipe!

Try using a bit more water (1/3-1/2 cup) and put a lid on the small pot while it simmers. Will keep most of the liquid, and flavor, that way. Let it cool sightly before adding the remaining ingredients.

luv2cook is right- the water with dill seed evaporated and maybe scorched it.  My husband thought I put Caraway seed in the dressing. It is a great combination of summer veggies...just need a different dressing.

This was absolutely wonderful.  I halved it for just the two of us.  Did keep the 1/3 c. water, though, and just really kept checking the dill seed carefully.  Only had cider vinegar but that was the only change.  Very, very nice taste.  Husband always makes a cucumber salad that is quick and easy with just bottled raspberry lite vinaigrette which is great, too.  Was just looking for a little change and this did not disappoint.  Thank you!
