My family really enjoyed this recipe.  It is very simple to prepare and delicious!  The only changes I would make when I make it again is to saute a little garlic in the pan first and then add some black pepper along with the salt at the end!  Thanks for the recipe Flora!

Thanks for putting something so simple and delicious out there for all to enjoy. Zucchini doesn't really need a lot of fixin's so this was perfect. I used what I had on hand, one zucchini, few slivers of onion (they upset my stomache but I love them so much I just cut down the amount), 1 chopped celery stalk, fresh chopped parlsey, garlic and red pepper flakes. Served with brown rice - I couldn't stop eating even though I was full!

This is a basic way of preparing zucchini but it is dependably delicious. Just to jazz it up a little I added fresh minced garlic, a drizzle of fresh lemon juice and some chopped, fresh dill.

I had a craving for zucchini, so I started out with this recipe, I added any veggies I had in the fridge (carrots, garlic, etc) as well as 2 fresh diced tomatoes and half a can of diced tomatoes. Also about 2-3 tbsp of Italian Seasonings. Served with pasta for a very healthy, light meal. Thanks!

wonderful but make sure your pan is big enough to evenly sautee all the veggies (and not have to steam them as well!), and add a lot of salt!

This is similar to what I have done for years. I put just a little curry powder in mine.  My husband doesnt like zucchini but he will stand at the stove and pick out all the onions.... always good with whatever spices you use

Really easy and good.  I made a slight variation where I added slices of steak to it to give it some meat and it worked out perfectly =)

This is simple and good. I add a clove of garlic and a dash of pepper. For a twist, add an egg or two, and break them up into tiny pieces as they fry. Serve immediately.

This recipe is pretty good, but a little boring. I added some ground black pepper and Parmesan cheese, which made it very tasty. As is, however, it's rather bland. I also sautéed the onion and zucchini together...it was easier and it turned out very well. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Easy and good.  I added a clove of garlic but would add two next time.  I also added pepper and seasoned salt.  I could see adding chunks of ham to this for a main dish.

I use this same simple technique for yellow crookneck squash. It is wonderful and simple. Sometimes I add a few sliced mushrooms and/or sesame seeds at the very end giving the seeds a chance to toast up ever so slightly

Very delicious! Thank you! I took your idea to serve it with pasta. It was perfect for a hot summer night that you don't know what to cook! Very refreshing and light! I spiced it up with some basil, mint, marjoram and black pepper.

So easy and delicious! I added some garlic to add aroma and a couple pieces of halloom cheese. There is none left on the stove! Dinner was a success and I will definitely cook this easy fast dinner again.

wow this was a lot better than I thought it would be.  I did saute garlic before adding the zucchini, and at the end I added pepper and a touch of butter (which was actually Earth Balance non-dairy).  My husband which generally doesn't like veggies thought it was great and ate it up quickly!

This was simple and tasty.  Like other reviewers, I added whatever veggies i had, including green pepper and garlic.  Also some Italian seasoning.  I placed slices on provolone cheese on top and put the lid on to melt.  It was really good - will definitely try with other veggies.

I usually make my zucchini this way but with garlic instead of onions, but I am always looking for new ways to cook it differently. I added pepper because cooked with the onions it's a more mild taste.

This is a very good and healthy recipe and easy to change up for any reason.  I've made this before with shrimp because my family likes seafood and added a little oyster sauce for an Asian twist and it turned out good as well.

Wow! Simple, yet delicious. Perfect summer side dish with grilled meat. My husband actually liked it . . . and asked for seconds! Keeper! Oh, I used half olive oil and half butter to sauté.

Simple, fast, and tasty. Instead of salt I added some soy sauce, and I took your suggestion and added a dash of Chinese cooking wine.
