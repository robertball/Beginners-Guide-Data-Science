I love this cake. I made one change nstead of using 1 cup of oil I used a 1/4 and filled the rest of the cup with unsweetend applesauce made the cake very moist without all the calories from the oil. My family, friends and co-workers love it too and was surprised when i told them about the applesauce.

Brought this cake to work & everyone loved it.  I made in a 9x13 pan and baked for 40 min.  Also, I used 1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon.  I took the suggestion from another review & used the Cream Cheese Frosing II recipe from this site instead of the frosting that is part of this cake recipe.  Lastly, I will say that this cake is especially good chilled.

This recipe is a keeper!!!  I took it to a Halloween party this morning, and I've been eating on the leftovers all day.  The cake turned out so moist and yummy.  I did use pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 t. of cinnamon to give it an extra bit of spice.  I baked it in a stoneware bar pan which was perfect for it.  Thank you for sharing!

I've been making this cake for 3 years.  I always double the frosting and use about 3/4 of it on the cake.  I use 1 T. of the Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus spice in place of just regular cinnamon.  It's also best when baked as a sheet cake, in a stoneware bar pan.  It bakes fine in 25 min. that way.  I've given out this recipe dozens of times!

I gave this a 4-star rating because Hubs rated it as such because he really enjoyed it, but we disagree in our review.  I thought this fairly standard recipe was good enough, and certainly moist, but this is not a recipe I’d pull out again and make a point of making.  Its biggest flaw is that a mere teaspoon of cinnamon is not enough spice to give this cake the flavor it needs.  I don’t have an issue with cinnamon being the only spice used; it just needs a lot more of it – like maybe a full tablespoon!  And I’d actually prefer the complexity of flavor that any combination of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, or allspice would contribute.  Just as is, the taste falls flat.  Complicating matters is the wimpy amount of frosting, which I didn’t use.  A more traditional amount of frosting, 1/2 c. butter, 1 (8 oz.) package of cream cheese, 3-1/2 – 4 cups of powdered sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla is much more suitable.  But Hubs disagreed.  He liked it just fine.   Three stars (barely) from me, four from him.  I baked this as a 9” layer cake, about 33 minutes.

I've made this a lot over the last year and have made a few changes that haven't affected the quality: three quarter c. oil, 1.5 cups sugar and 3 eggs.  I sometimes add ginger/nutmeg/cloves if I have them around.  The cake has a great flavor and is quick to mix and bake so is a favorite at my house.

I used pumpkin pie spice II (this site) instead of just the cinnamon. It is good however I may double it, so it can taste a bit more like a spice cake too. I also used the cream cheese frosting II, which is heavenly. I make pumpkin cupcakes with this recipe and the only thing I change is using 3 eggs (cant tell the difference) and 1/2 c. oil 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce. I tried with 1/4 c. oil and the rest applesauce but it was too sticky that way.

Very good I made this into cupcakes.  Cut the oil to 1/4 c. as previous poster suggested and replaced the rest with applesauce.  Cut down the sugar.  Did not add walnuts for people at work with allergies. Added some pumpkin spice.  Baked for about 25 mins here made about 22 cupcakes.  Everyone ate them up quickly and asked for the recipe.  Will make again.

I made this cake quick the other day just before leaving for work so, it was still slightly warm when I arrived.  I put the icing on it when I arrived there and it was GONE within an hour.  My co-workers "LOVED" it and everyone wanted the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was, I also added 1 and 1/2 teas. of pumpkin pie spice.  This cake truly is better than pumpkin pie!  It's very moist and rich and the cream cheese icing adds just the right touch!

Like many others, I used a lot more spices than the recipe called for.  I probably used 3 Tbsp. cinnamon, 2 Tbsp. each of nutmeg, allspice, and ginger.  Also, I only had 9 x 13 pan so I baked it for about 10 min. longer but it was still slightly uncooked at some places in the center.  Additionally, I used 8 oz cream cheese and 6 Tbsp butter for the frosting, but the same amount of powdered sugar (didn't want it too sweet) and no milk.  All in all, if you make some tweaks, this is a delicious and moist cake.

I made this for my husband because he loves pumpkin pie and I do not, so I was hoping this was a good compromise. What a hit! I, too, added more cream cheese in my frosting, and used a cinnamond blend (it included nutmet)rather than plain cinnamon. I'm not sure how much of it I used as I ended up dumping rather than measuring. I used a 9x13 inch pan so it took longer to cook (use the toothpick test!) but it was AMAZINGLY moist. I took some to work and was treated like a gourmet chef!

I made the recipe as is and found it relatively easy to prepare. I baked the cake for 35 minutes then took it out the oven and let it cool for a while. I finished it off with the cream cheese frosting and sprinkles of chopped walnuts. Everyone thought this was great and ate it all up. The cake itself was moist but I thought the flavor was just ok-a little on the bland side. To me I think it could have used a lot more cinnamon; maybe even pumpkin spice for a more rounded flavor. I felt that there wasn’t enough cream cheese frosting; leaving me with a very thin layer to work with. One (3 ounce) package cream cheese, 5 tablespoons butter or margarine and 1 ¾ cups of confectioner’s sugar just wasn’t enough for the entire cake. I would have preferred more cream cheese frosting and a thicker consistency to spread generously over the cake. It was creamy and I could taste the sweetness of the frosting. Everyone else enjoyed this and that is what counts. Thou I have to give this 4 stars based upon the recipe itself.

This recipe was a great starting point for a moist sheet cake. I knew without experimenting that it would need more spices. I added more cinnamon as well as gloves and a dash of nutmeg. I believe I used 3/4 cup of oil. The only other change that I will make next time is to increase the salt to bring out more flavor.

Made the recipe exactly as stated and it turned out very tasty especially when chilled. A great alternative to Pumpkin Pie. Will be making this again for Thanksgiving Dinner.

This was great, although I did take the advice of other reviewers and add another teaspoon of cinnamon 1 tspn of nutmeg.  It still could use a little more of something even though it was very tastey and definately a very moist cake.  I think next time I might try some more nutmeg and/or some pumpkin pie spice or allspice.  Definately a great cake but who knows it might be just a bit better.  Thanks for the recipe.

I loved the way this cake turned out!  I made a layer cake and it was very moist. I lightly beat the eggs before adding, and used 2 tsp. cinnamon.   The frosting is very soft, which is fine for a sheet cake, but I had to chill it for a while to be able to frost my layer cake. I will definitely make this again and I might add a little more cinnamon or some nutmeg just because I like a little more spice.

I'm obsessed with this cake. I've made 4 cakes this year for thanksgiving parties and potlucks. It was moist and delicious and was great for decorating.  I used my own cream cheese icing recipe and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the icing.  I gave the recipe 4 stars because it really needed more spices.  I doubled the amount of cinnamon and added clove, ginger, allspice.  Its a great base recipe and super easy to make!

I and my entire group of tasters did not care for this recipe, very heavy oil taste, definitely not enough spice, even the frosting was disappointing.  I will not make this again.

This cake is fabulous!  I did make 2 small changes.  I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil and I used 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon.  I also used Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site rather than the frosting in the recipe.  Baked it in a 13x9 pan for about 40 mins.  Everyone loved it at my tailgate party last weekend and I plan to make it again this weekend.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very moist and delicious! As others suggested I also used pumpkin spice and cinnamon, I also used the cream cheese II recipe, instead of the one with this.

I just made this for a potluck lunch at work, and they were fabulous. I made a few changes for my own personal tastes: I substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for half of the oil; I added a generous dose of pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon; and I only used 3 eggs. I also cooked them in two 9x13 pans to get a thinner, more "barlike" finished product. Worked perfectly! The bars were thin, moist, and more dense than cake--exactly what I wanted! I didn't measure for the frosting, just threw in 5 T. of butter, 8 oz. of reduced fat cream cheese, confectioner's sugar to taste, and enough milk to make it spreadable. I also added about a tablespoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon for flavor. So delicious! I'd recommend keeping them in the fridge because of the cream cheese in the frosting. Definitely worth making, and easy to tweak to fit your health needs or personal tastes!

I made this cake recently. I doubled the recipe and baked in a large wilton pan. I needed to serve 45 people. I did add more cinnamon and some allspice, cloves and nutmeg. I topped it with a cinnamon cream cheese icing and chopped walnuts.  Everyone love it. Thanks for sharing.

I made this for a friend's bday, Everyone loved it! The only issue was with the icing, it was really really runny. Next time I will follow suggestions from other commentators and definitely use another icing recipe. Other than that, I was really proud!! Everyone was happy.

This was awesome!  I made this for Thanksgiving dessert instead of pie this year.   I used applesauce instead of oil, just a personal preference and I frosted the cake with the Nutty Cream Cheese frosting on this site.  It was very yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Very good and moist! Made these into cupcakes. The only thing I might do differently next time is add more cinammon or pumpkin pie spice might be good.

This was one of the most delicious and moist cakes I've ever made! I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to taste the pumpkin, but I could, and it was heavenly! The only thing I did differently was I used a different cream cheese frosting recipe. Thanks for a delicious cake!

This was excellent!  I made a frosting with cream cheese and cool whip which wasn't too sweet and topped it with chopped walnuts.  I was asked over and over for the recipe.

A good cake. Added ginger, and more cinnamon. Next time, I will reduce oil to 3/4 cup, reduce sugar considerably, and cook slightly less longer. I won't use the frosting, as it was way too sweet. I had to add an extra 8-oz package of cream cheese to "de-sweeten." Also, a 9x13 pan should be used, otherwise cake is too thin.

Very good cake. I used 1-1/2 times the recipe to make two 9 x 13 cakes.  I also added a little ground cloves and ginger for extra spice flavor. Easy to make and delicious.

I made this as a birthday cake yesterday.  Since I'm gluten free, I used Pamela's Baking Mix.  Made the following modifications and no one could believe the cake was homemade or GF:  Didn't add baking soda (or was it powder) because the baking mix has it already.  Replaced half oil with half organic sugarfree applesauce.  Increased cinnamon, added some nutmeg and cardamom.  Replaced 2 cups white sugar with one of brown and one of birch sugar (xylitol).  Made three layers in an 11 x 15 pan, sandwiched the layers using cream cheese frosting II (doubled the recipe but used only 1 1/4 10x sugar).  Decorated with toasted pecan halves and shaved chocolate.  Huge rave reviews all night.  Didn't even bother to tell anyone that the cake was GF.

This cake is excellent! It took me 45 minutes to bake. I just made my own cream cheese frosting - 1 stick butter, 1 block of cream cheese, a capful of vanilla extract and confectioners sugar as needed.  I probably used about a cup since I like my cream cheese frosting, cream cheesy tasting.. Yumm-o's!  Moist cake hands down!

This has become one of my go-to recipes for potlucks.  It doubles very easily to use a large can of pumpkin.  I do make the following substitutions: 1c. applesauce for the oil, 1c. whole wheat flour for 1c. AP, extra cinnamon and 1/2t. ground ginger,and I add chopped apple, dried cranberries or chocolate chips to jazz it up a little.  A simple cake that everyone  loves.

I made this cake for a treat day at work, and my co-workers raved about how great it was!  This is an easy recipe, very moist and tastes delicious.  The only thing I changed was that I used Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site (per other reviewers) and it turned out awesome.  Will definitely make this again!!

Made this 11/2010. Really moist, super easy to make, but lacked flavor. I think next time I'll make pumpkin bread instead. This was too dull and not very flavorful.

I have made cupcakes out of this recipe twice and everyone loves them. I added a few more spices and I think that the amount of cream cheese is incorrect, I think it is meant to say 8 oz. Love the cake though, very yummy and moist.

I had to bake a cake for a funeral luncheon - I thought I had a cake mix...but didn't.  I had a can of pumpkin thought...so of course I always turn to All Recipes.com for everything!  This was outstanding...and lots of people asked for the recipe.  I, of course, always recommend this site!  Thank you Sandy for a wonderful recipe...it's a keeper!

This is great recipe. One lady said she used applesuace instead of oil. I always use applesauce if it calls for oil in all my cakes. It is more moist and is less fat in the end..Yummy

I made a trial of this cake today.  Despite not having enough flour, not having the size cake pan that is listed, and with two kids trying to help, the cake turned out great!  I'm making for Thanksgiving and it will be that much better.  Great cake!

I took out a cup of sugar, used 1 cup raw sugar and 1 cup dried cranberries and 1 teaspoon of ground ginger as well as cinnamon. Made 6 large muffins and one small loaf. Added white Chia seeds to top of loaf. As we are New Zealanders we had the muffins as dessert with whipped cream. Just eaten tonight so not sure how the loaf will keep.

Very, very good and my cake part looks just like this photo.  I used buttercup squash.  I doubled the cinnamon but only because my family loves heavy cinnamon so I double it on almost every recipe I make.  I made a 2 layer cake and it worked out perfect (baked 25 min) and also looks beautiful.  Mine was a little bit dense but probably because I used some leftover, whipped sweet potatoes with butter that we had for dinner the night before instead of oil.  Very good - even my husband, who is more picky than my kids and swore he would hate it because it was a cake and has vegetable matter in it,  said "hmmf, it's pretty good" - that is saying a lot!  Little does he know that most of our cakes have vegies snuck in.

I did make some changes to this, and am reviewing mainly to remember them for next time, and there will be a next time!
Used 8oz of applesauce, and 2 tablespoons of oil, and used 3 eggs. Added 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, plus a shake of cinnamon (I may try 2 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 to 1 tsp of cinnamon next time), which gave it enough flavor. I also used brown sugar instead of white but only because I found out I was out of it at the last minute. I think I will keep this ingredient though, much more depth of flavor with brown sugar. I topped this with the Healthier Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site. I took it to a party and it was gone in no time!

Thank you Sandy Rowe for sharing this delicious recipe! My husband is NOT a cake guy, he prefers more pies and cobblers, but he LOVED this cake. Will definitely be keeping this in my favorites file. I didn't change one ingredient...didn't have to, it's perfect as is!

Four words: "Out of this world!" I made the cake exactly as the recipe was written, and I would not change a thing. A few of the reviewers suggested using Cream Cheese Frosting II for the icing, which I did. This was a moist cake, and the cream cheese icing was incredibly creamy with the perfect amount of sweetness. Get the milk ready ... this dessert will melt in your mouth!!!

Delicious!  Very moist cake with a great flavor! The only change that I made was to add ground cinnamon, ground clove and ground nutmeg to the icing.  Will definitely make again! Very easy!

Delicious and moist! Was the perfect compliment for my Thanksgiving Dinner. My cousin kept saying "It's just like a carrot cake, but BETTER!"... no one was disappointed. I did double the cinnamon though, just for fun.

This was very moist and had a nice mild flavor without being spicy. The icing just barely covered the cake but it was adequate. The family really liked this a lot. Thanks for the great recipe!

A very nice moist cake, though it could use a lot more spices. I used about 2t cinnamon and 1t each nutmeg and allspice which gave it just the right flavor.

I've been making this cake every halloween for about 5 years it is my absolute favorite. I like to double it and bake in a large foil pan ( like you can find at your local $ store) It's great with vanilla buttercream, cream cheese, or chocolate frosting. I am trying this year unfrosted in mini bundt cake pans with chocolate chips. Enjoy!

Very good, dense cake.  Bake on a cookie sheet 15x10x1.  Use the Cream Cheese II frosting recipe on this site. (I didn't try the icing in the recipe, because the CCII recipe is great.) Refrigerate, then cut into bite size squares, diamonds or logs.

I've been making this cake for about two or three years now (got from this site) and it's the best darn cake I make! I get asked for this recipe EVERYTIME I make it. It's never failed me. Always moist and delicious. I double the recipe and make a two layered sheet cake. I'm making it now and will be using the cream cheese icing listed here and then drawing and decorating a pumpkin on top for our church function tomorrow (10-13-07). Now, hopefully, I'll win the contest!

I made this in a much smaller version for my mom who adores pumpkin desserts. I put a bit more pumpkin and sugar than was needed and made some good cream cheese frosting that was not what I usually make. It was a hit. Will definitely be making this again.

This is such a yummy cake. I only had a 13x9 cake pan so it took a little longer to make but it wass worth it. I also had store bought cream cheese frosting. I am making this any chance I get.

I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 unsweetened apple sauce.  I also used the Cream Cheese frosting II from this website, except I used reduced fat cream cheese.  I topped the cake with chopped pecans.  It is better cold!

This cake is amazing!  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner, and it got eaten up before the Pumpkin pie did.  I'm not sure how many times I was asked for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.  
(I also doubled the icing and used half of it for something else, but I mixed it with unsweetened WHIPPED cream, and it was really fluffy and yummy)

so delicious and moist..I made this for a church function 2 days ahead and left in refrige..so good everyone raved! I forgot to mention that I used only 1 3/4 cups of white sugar and it was still sweet enough..I also use much less 10x sugar for the icing about 1 cup works great.

I added 1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I use a gas oven and I believe it keeps things moist a lot better than an electric oven that I used for 25 yrs. Also I used the cream cheese frosting 2. My son said it was the best cake he ever ate!!!! Thanks so much for your recipe!!

I made this twice.  Once with 1 C. Coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.   Really good flavor! 
Today I made it with 1/2 Veg. oil and 1/2 Coconut Oil.   Also added a touch of nutmeg and Oh My Gosh!!! Delicious!!!

Made the cake with GF flour. Used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon cloves, and 1/4 teaspoon coriander. It was irresistibly good and no one would never guess that it was gluten free.

Just made a variation of this recipe using some advice from other reviewers. I substituted 1 cup unsweetened applesauce for the oil and added 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I frosted with a cream cheese frosting shared by another reviewer (8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 2 cups confectioner's sugar -- perfect consistency and perfect amount to cover a 9x13" cake). I used a 9x13" cake pan and baked for 40 min. The cake was moist but I personally found it to be too dense, although my husband thought the density was an asset. Even using the spices I did I think the cake could still use more for enhanced flavor. I will increase the pumpkin pie spice to at least 2 tsp, maybe 2 1/2 tsp, if I make this again, and will consider using only 3 eggs to make a less dense version.

I thought this cake was pretty good and very easy to make. I did use applesauce in place of the oil and added some pumpkin pie spice (I think I actually could've used more spice). My husband thought it was great.

This recipe was OK, but not fantastic.  At the suggestion of others, I added 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, but I think it could have used more.  I used unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil. I also used the Cream Cheese II frosting recipe and it was just the right amount and very tasty.  Not sure if I will make this again.

This recipe goes together very well. I put in a touch of nutmeg and I went heavier on the cinnamon. It was done in 20 minutes. Be sparing on the frosting because it can overpower the cake.

Eh.  Too much baking soda gave the cake a bitter taste.  Too much sugar compared to cream cheese in the frosting...not much of that cream cheesy flavor...just very sweet.

I made this for our family reunion get together at the park and it was a big hit. I really liked the texture and the flavor. I only added 1/2 of the oil too, and it turned out fantastic. It's definitely something I will make again.

I made this recipe for my best friend's birthday this January.  She adores pumpkin and the only frosting she likes is cream cheese, so it sounded to me like the perfect cake for her.  It was!  She loved it, and after she let another guest take home some of the leftovers (everyone else liked it too) she said she wished she had kept it all for herself!

I made it according to the recipe exactly, except that I put in almost twice as much pumpkin--probably around 28 ounces.  Maybe that's why the cake was so very dense.  The denseness was my only real problem with it, and I probably brought that on myself.  I made it in two 9" round pans--my first layer cake--and they came out pretty flat.  But still tasty!

Thanks very much!

This cake was very good and original.  I too only used 1/2 the oil 3 eggs.  I also cut back on the white and 10X sugar.  The cake was still very sweet and my family loved it.  I used pecans because we didn't have any walnuts and it was still delicious.

This recipe is sooooooo good!  I have taken it to several gatherings and gotten rave reviews and many requests for the recipe.  Last time I made it, I used 1/2 the oil and one less egg and it turned out just as good (maybe even better, and healthier too).  I LOVE this recipe!

this cake is delicious and gets rave reviews!  we made it this year for my son's Halloween/Birthday party and both kids and adults loved it.  people don't expect a large cake at a kids party to taste so good!  plus you can mix up the decorations with all kinds of themes (Halloween etc.)  I doubled the recipe and had NO leftovers.

I felt it needed more spice so I gave it 2tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp That made it a five star along with making cupcakes 24, and baked them 15-18 minutes, Yummy and moist.

Super easy, tastes awesome.
I subbed 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil.
Also, I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so on top of the cinnamon I added 1/4 tsp of ginger, nutmeg, and cloves.

Made this for a family event. It came out great. I added about a 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice and a tsp of cinnamon to 3 cups of whipping cream along with the usual sugar and vanilla and it was the perfect addition to top off this cake. It was a hit.

I took the advice offered by many others and added spices to this cake and call this my pumpkin spice sheet cake. Each week I bake something for a group of people and this is one they often ask for. It is usually gone within a few hours!

This recipe was AMAZING!  I did cut the oil with half apple sauce.  I also baked it in a 9 X 13 pan and it came out awesome.  Just added a couple of more minutes to the baking time.  Very moist and yummy!  I also used a frosting recipe with more powdered sugar because it was way too rich with the butter and cream cheese otherwise.

I was looking for a basic pumpkin cake I could make my go to recipe for adding other spices, nuts, &/or fruits as the mood struck me. This was perfect! It was extremely moist and made a beautiful warm brown cake--perfect for holiday dessert or everyday eating. I added  2  cups of fresh, uncooked cranberries and 1 diced apple to the batter (plus a bit more pumpkin spice and a 1/2 cup of molasses powder to deepen the color and enrich the taste). I'm sure I didn't need all that to make a nice cake, but it gave it a wonderful richness that tasted almost like a fresh fruitcake (but without all that candied fruit).  It is very sweet so I didn't bother with frosting.  (In fact, next time I will reduce the sugar to 1 cup, since I plan to keep adding the molasses powder for that richer taste it gives.) I cut it into bars to use as snacks or lunch treats and with only two of us, it goes a long way!

This is the most freaking best cake ever. I made it for my family - it was gone within one night. It smells delicious in the oven, but doesn't taste good alone (without icing). It is extremely moist, the most moist cake I've ever had! I love to put walnuts on top of it, with buttercream icing, the best ever!

This turned out perfect and will become one of my go to recipes. It is super moist and flavorful; the only changes I made was the addition of one tsp vanilla to the batter and I made it in a 9x13 pan and baked it for 35 minutes. Not only was it a delight to eat but it went together simply and quickly!

Had some pumpkin pie mix in freezer so used that and didn't do any frosting.  Still added the cinnamon even though the pie mix was already seasoned.  It was absolutely yummy!!  The flavor was rich, moist and delish.  Will make this a lot in the fall for family get togethers.

I made this today and my house smelled so delicious I couldn't wait to try it! I did alter the recipe a bit. Here's what I did: 1cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar (instead of two cups white), added two tablespoons of maple syrup, I used pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon, but I added a smidge extra nutmeg. On the frosting, I used 8 ounces of cream cheese and used the same amount of powdered sugar and vanilla called for, added about 5-6 tablespoons of milk.. I whipped it until it was very light and fluffy. Also, I used a 9x13 pan greased and baked for 30 minutes, until my toothpick came clean. This cake was ridiculously good. I absolutely love it and I'm not a huge pumpkin fan. I had a piece when it was still warm.. it's so good and I recommend it highly!!

I made this yesterday for a Memorial Service and it is a definite repeat.  There are a couple of changes I slightly made.  While following the recipe to the cake batter I added 1 teaspoon of baking powder as well as the baking soda.  I used 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, omitting the cinnamon. Reduced sugar to 1-1/4 cup.  I baked in a 9 X 13 baking pan as I wanted a tall, not thin cake.  Baked for 35 minutes @ 350* based on my oven. I used 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter and add only enough powdered sugar to my taste for the frosting. All other cake & frosting ingredients per recipe.  It was very moist and just indescribably delicious.  Received many compliments.  I want to bake another one today however my willpower will not prevail, it is just that good.  At least to me anyway and I'm not a big dessert person.

I made it for a party and WOW was it ever popular! It really does serve 20, but the 10 of us ate more than half because we really couldn't stop ourselves! :) Delicious! Everyone really appreciated the texture, flavor and that it wasn't overly sweet. (One of the real pluses of the frosting!)

I made a couple of  minor substitutions I uses 2 tsp Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of Cinnamon, and baked in a 9 x 13 pan (40 min) so it would fit on my plate. I also added 1oz additional cream cheese (4oz total) and it really didn't need any milk so I didn't add any, but did add an extra splash of vanilla.

I decreased the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup water to ensure moistness. I tripled the cinnamon and added good portions of ginger and Allspice.  I also added raisins.  I took it to a meeting we had that evening, and everyone love it.

I made this for my pumpkin loving co-workers. I didn't read the changes before I mixed it together, so what I did was off the cuff. I did 1 and 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup light brown. I have pumpkin pie spice and used it because it's pumpkin. After tasting the batter before baking, added twice the amount of spice, a pinch of cardamon and a tablespoon of minced crystallized ginger. Oh, and two tsp vanilla. I will possibly make this again, but will check out some other recipes first. The changes made this  yummy.

I made it with no changes. I'm taking it to our library's boccie ball tournament  fundraiser this afternoon. We tried it this morning and it's a keeper.  When I cut it, I made the pieces small so I have twenty pieces for the fundraiser and plenty left for us.

I followed the recipe exactly.  While it looks nice, has a nice crumb, and I didn't notice any oily taste whatsoever, the flavour really needs help in terms of  spices to wake it up.  If I was to make this again, I'd double the cinnamon and add at least a tablespoon of ginger or put in a couple of tablespoons of Pumpkin Pie spice instead.

I made this twice(second time I doubled the recipe). I was surprised at the amount of oil, however it turned out fantastic. The taste was awesome. Husband loved it, guests loved it, family loved it. This has already become a family favorite and a great way to use up those extra cans of holiday pumpkin and cream cheese!

After making changes, this cake is incredibly delicious and moist. I baked in a bundt pan for 55 mins at 350 and drizzled cream cheese frosting across the top. 
Changes to the recipe were:
Oil 3/4 cup
Applesauce 3/4 cup
1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar
3 Tblsp cinnamon, 1 Tblsp pumpkin pie spice

I used the recipe's 4 eggs.

I will definitely rely on this recipe as it's a winner!

I added allspice and nutmeg after reading some of the other reviews and thought those were great additions - might have been a little boring without them.

I made exactly except for omitting the walnuts! It didn't rise as much as expected but was fluffy and moist to eat. I would definitely make this again for my Thanksgiving Eve dinner.

I really loved it, followed the original recipe and only swapped walnuts for pecans... It is yummy! Beautiful, most crumb like all oil based cakes and not your usual spongy pumpkin cake, very easy to make. I will be making again right away.

I have made this cake twice.   I received many compliments. The 2nd time I made the cake I added a dash of powered ginger, nutmeg and cloves.  It was awesome!  For the foster I did not use 3 tablespoons of milk.  I used one or one 1/2 tablespoons of milk because I like the foster a little ticker.

This was a phenomenal cake, particularly with some tweaks. I made it for my wife's birthday. She said it was the best pumpkin cake she's ever had. I changed the recipe a bit to make it more healthy. I substituted one cup of apple sauce for the sugar and then used 3/4 cup of coconut oil in place of one cup of vegetable oil. I did this because apple sauce sometimes makes cake a little soggy. Then for the frosting I used whipped cream cheese right out of the jar and kept everything else as listed in the instructions except I only used about a cup of confectionary sugar instead of 1 3/4 cup. Seriously, this cake rocks. It was very moist and just rich enough. Try it!

I added 1/2 tsp nutmet, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp cloves and reduced the oil to 3/4 c - as recommended by other reviewers.  I could probably have reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and been fine.  It was beautifully moist and the taste with the added spices was marvelous.  I topped it with a glaze, which was sweet enough to add a bit of extra richness. Frosting might have been a bit overboard.  With the additions it's '5 star'.

Love this recipe!! I added raisins the second time I made it--liked the addition-will keep adding them but was great without them. Used canned icing--Duncan Hines cream cheese frosting-2 cans- topped with pecans.  Will continue even when it's not pumpkin time.

Wow!!! That was good cake! However, after reading a few reviews I made the following changes:
Used 2tsp of pumpkin spice and 1tsp of Cinnamon; replaced 1 cup of sugar with 3/4 cup of stevia; used 1/4 cup oil with 3/4 cup of applesauce. For the frosting I made half of the Cream cheese frosting ll from this site with an addition of 1/4 top of allspice. Baked in a 13 x 9 dish for 8 min longer than called for in the recipe. It went like hot cakes at a birthday party  :) 
Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This is a delicious sheet cake. Certainly it is moist. Perhaps you could add a tsp more of cinnamon if you'd like more spice. I doubled the frosting because it is me. Made this in a 10x15. The baking time was only 18-20 in my oven. This was better the next day.

Changed the cinnamon to pumpkin pie spice, and it turned out addictively good.  We made this as cupcakes with 18-22 mins baking time, turned out excellent.

I made 24 pumpkin cupcakes for thanksgiving desert with this recipe, and it turned out lovely! The cake was incredibly moist and fluffy and I used the cream cheese frosting II (on this site) as many reviews suggested. The frosting was so much better than any other cream cheese frosting I've tried--the cream cheese wasn't over powered by the confectioner's sugar. I also added some pumpkin pie spice (a little over a teaspoon), which gave the cake a delicious and subtle spicy flavor. Over all, I'm happy with this recipe--definitely one to keep for next thanksgiving!

I was very disappointed with the lack of flavor in this cake. Even my Husband was not impressed. I wish I would have listened to the other reviewers and added Pumpkin Pie spice instead of just cinnamon.

Fantastic cake! Step son was eating a piece and I got mmm good. He normally isn't too vocal about the things that I cook, but when he likes it he lets me know. I myself have had a piece and this recipe is fabulous as is, but I would like to try the applesauce suggestion later. Thank you for a great cake!

I read those reviews before I got baking and decided to add my own. Used plain applesauce instead of oil to make the cake more moist, and added 1 tsp each of appropriate spices on hand - cinnamon, ginger, and clove. Very light spice flavor, but still good. I plan to play around with it more. We skipped the frosting and made a homemade spiced vanilla syrup instead to further moisten the cake (like a Christmas pudding) and topped it with toasted pecans. Pretty good after our adjustments, but will still be playing around more to get it right.

I've made this cake in a variety of sizes, and ALL of them have turned out moist and fluffy. Try covering and placing in the freezer for 45 minutes immediately after baking for an amazing, moist texture. 4/5 stars only because I think this recipe works way better with the "whipped cream, cream cheese frosting" recipe (also on this site).

This recipe is amazing! I doubled the recipe and made 2 cookie sheet cakes, and once it was cooled I sandwiched a thin layer of homemade apple butter (search slow cooker apple butter on All Recipes) between the two layers and made a cream cheese frosting. Everyone LOVED it!

Great recipe - but could use some flashy flavors. I added a teaspoon (each) of nutmeg, all spice, and vanilla. I substituted a stick of butter for a 1/2 cup of oil too. Very yummy and a family favorite!

A few small changes... just did half a cup of oil, and a 1/4 cup of applesauce... they are moist and delicious (i made it cupcakes) and instead of icing i sprinkled them with cinnamon and sugar while warm.... thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I am not much of a baker,but have been trying to get over my fear of it. I made this for Easter dinner and found it to be very easy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I cheated on the frosting. I bought the cream cheese frosting from the grocery store. But it was still very good. My daughter said "you made this mom?...from scratch" I will try making it with the tip on using applesauce and see how it effects the taste. I was surprised about the 1 cup oil because it seemed like alot. I told my daughter about the oil content after she ate it and she was not so happy about that. I said at least you got your vegetable servings for the day..Ha Ha. Thanks for the great cake recipe!!

I just made this-so moist!!! I did add 1 tsp of all spice, as well as the cinnamon, for a true pumpkin pie flavor. For the icing, I used 8 oz cream cheese instead of 3-it was too sweet otherwise. Also, I cooked it for 40 minutes; it would have been undercooked if I hadn't.  This was inhaled by my family!

I will never make THIS cake again... too much oil, not enough flour, not enough flavor, had to bake 10 minutes longer than called for and still came out a dense, flavorless disappointment.  I can' t comment on the icing because I used a Betty Crocker cream cheese icing, and that was the only tasty part of this cake.

Was glad that other reviewers suggested replacing some of the oil with applesauce. I further reduced the oil by one T and then added 1 T of molasses to give more flavor. Because cloves, nutmeg, and allspice are migraine triggers for me, I decided to triple the cinnamon, and replace one cup of the white sugar with 1 cup of brown sugar.  I don't have a 10x15 pan so I used 9x12 and increased the baking time.  I used my own recipe for cream cheese frosting since I like mine very thick and pretty sweet. Overall, this had great flavor, was very moist, and everyone loved it!

I continue to make this recipe over and over.  yes i use more than the called for amount of cinnamon....however if you use a high quality cinnamon you wouldn't need as much as you think.  as for the icing you don't need a thick layer of icing if this is made as the sheet cake it was intended to be.  My  MIL who doesn't like any pumpkin enjoyed it so much she wanted a copy of the recipe.  It never fails this recipe.

I made this as a last-minute fill-in for my cooking group at the supported housing building where I work. It came out delicious, but I have one complaint-- the term "sheet cake" is a bit misleading. A true sheet cake is 18x26 or thereabouts; this is only slightly larger than the standard 9x12 cake pan. Yes, I should have read the pan size more closely, but still. On the up side, even when I put it in a sheet cake pan (and adjusted the baking time accordingly) it came out only about 3/4" high but still very tasty. We quickly whipped up another batch of batter and made it in a smaller pan, and it was a huge hit!

I made this last weekend prior to Thanksgiving, to take to a church dinner. Thanksgiving has been ruined two years without trying a recipe first and waited, making it that very day.  This one is wonderful.  Thanksgiving I'll add pecans (chopped) to icing and I'll be the STAR of the show.  Kidding aside - I'll beat what I came up with last year, a recipe HIGHLY touted to be the best flan ever.  NOT!!!
Thank you so much Sandy.
