I found this recipe very misleading. What we in Scotland call a Pancake, sassenachs and other non-Celts call a DROP SCONE.  That which the Southern Brittish call a Pancake, we Scots call a crumpet. You North Americans also call it a pancake, which you eat with Maple Syrup, Ice Cream, etc.

This is a good recipe, but a bit runny and much better if you use golden syrup instead of sugar. (I think you lot call it corn syrup?) By the way, pikelets are Welsh. These are drop scones. 

To DannyMuirMhor: Who're you calling a sassanach, ye raj? ;)

Made this this morning and they tasted great! they are supposed to be thin and crispy, not thick and doughy like a crumpet so i followed the measurements from the original posting of the recipe. Just right!

Arguments about naming and authenticity aside, these are pretty basic, good pancakes.  I subbed honey for sugar on the basis of someone's review who recommended corn syrup--don't have that, but I definitely have honey!  I also was not in the mood to measure anything this morning, and ended up with some thick little pikelets.  I probably did it all wrong, but they were easy and relatively quick.  I don't use butter bc it doesn't agree with me, so I just used Pam instead to coat the pan.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are very good. I consider myself an experienced pancake maker but I burnt several of these. Be careful with the butter. Also, the recipe says 1/8 cup batter for each pikelet. Is this a typo? I used about 1/4 cup. Nice change of pace. Thanks!

These were definitely the fluffiest pancakes I've ever made. I was pleased. I was displeased at the amount of sugar, because it will make them more likely to burn. I'd eliminate it entirely next time--this time I did reduce the sugar to about 2 TB. Also, I'm not sure what 5 people are eating these. I did make mine a bit bigger than the recipe specified, but I still only got 7 pancakes (excuse me, pikelets) out of this recipe. Just a heads-up for anyone else who was thinking of trying these. You really should, it's a nice tasty basic pancake :) Thanks for the recipe!

My Aunt Jenny, born and raised in Scotland, made these "wee treats" and called them Sweet Pancakes. They are suppose to be small "dollar" pancakes, sweet and fluffy, and we loved them! Warm or cold, plain or topped, they are perfect for little hands... or with Mom's tea!

These were good, if you like sweet,eggy,and somewhat tasteless pancakes.  The recipe is very nice and simple if you follow it. I didn't, I automatically started beating the eggs before looking at the directions, oops, they ended up lumpy.  Anyway, the directions are good and I think cutting the sugar in half would improve them greatly.  I give it 4 stars for a good recipe in theory, written well, accurate picture, good description, and potentially tasty results.

I don't care what you call these, I love this recipe. I've also made them adding a teaspoon of cinnamon, and eat them without any toppings.

Light, fluffy, delicious & easy to work with. My only suggestion is reduce the amount of sugar, and then sweeten to taste by serving with jam or syrup.

I agree this recipe is for drop scones. We don't use the word 'piklets' for this type of thing. I think its more of a Yorkshire word for crumpets.

I added a spoonful of blackberry preserves to the recipe and just threw all the ingredients in the blender. When I poured the mix on the skillet for the first pancakes I was worried that it looked a little thin, but they puffed up nicely. They were light, fluffy and moist. Hubby and I agreed that these were the best pancakes we've ever had.

Made it this morning and we all loved it. Especially the kids. I didn't have any self rising flour so I used regular and added a dash of vinegar do could get the rising from the baking soda and vinegar instead. Turned out nice and fluffy. Doubled the recipe and only have a couple left over. Definitely will do again.
