The recipe is excellent. It reminds me a lot of the christmas panettone but it's SO MUCH tastier. I just substituted the eggs with more milk and added more almonds and sultanas and it's fantastic

You MUST double the liquids if you want anything that resembles a bread dough!  It tasted good and had nice texture and smelled so good baking.

I added chopped apples instead of the nuts when I made this, but I added too much extra liquids and flour when I was trying to make the dough in the bread machine and it overflowed a bit and the top didn't bake well.  I left it in the bread machine for an extra half hour to let it cook a little more after the cycle was over, but it came out great.  Made a lemon orange dipping sauce for it and it was a hit.

I twisted this a bit because I had fresh apples. Instead of milk, I used lemon yogurt. Instead of the raisins and almonds, I chopped up 3 small apples and 1/2 cup of pecans. Mixed the apples, pecans, 1/4 cup brown sugar, a small amt of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp vanilla with the cinnamon and only a dash of nutmeg.  I waited until the bread was 1/2 raised, cut a deep hole in the center, stuffed the loaf with the fruit and pulled the dough over the top and turned off my machine to let it raise for about 45 min. Then turned it onto bake. It was wonderful. Very light, fluffy and the center was like a turnover. A little butter and honey to top it off.
