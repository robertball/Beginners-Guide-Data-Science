This was so good I had the impulse to fill the bathtub and roll around in it. My guest at first said it was good, but as he got further down the bowl, to the chunks of crab and corn, he starting raving. He wanted seconds but I decided to save the rest for myself. A significant change I made was to use fat free cream. This made it much healthier but, believe me, the flavor was still outstanding.

I did my own tweaking and it came out so good it should be illegal. I used 6 TB butter, 6TB flour for the roux. Then I used 2 TB butter to soften the 1/2 of small onion. I used 1/2 tsp of cajun seasoning,( 2 )14oz cans of low sodium chicken broth,1 bag of 14oz frozen baby corn,1 cup fat free half & half, 1 cup lite cream, 1/2 tsp shrimp & crab boil, 1 lb of canned lump crabmeat & salt to taste.UPDATE: I used 1 can of white wine in place of 1 of the 2 cans of broth, and it has a nice complimentary flavor to the crab.

This soup was amazing! I halved the liquids and used a can of cream corn and 12 oz of crab to use what I had in the cupboard. I'll be making this again for sure!!

This bisque was awesome but a little too bland so I used about 2 tablespoons of Tony Chachere's (cajun seasoning) and now it's tastes like something I would order straight out of new orleans.

Very good!!! One of the best meals I have ever made. I did change a few things. I used 4 ears of fresh corn. I added one jalapeno and hot sauce for extra spice.I also used Tony's(cajun seasoning)for flavor.I like it real spicy! I also added one and a half more cups of chicken stock so it wasn't so thick. Everything else I followed by the recipe! My whole family is from New Orleans so I know a great bisque and this is one!! AWESOME recipe!!!

nice recipe, but to make things easier, when you make the roux add the veggies directly to the roux; then the liquids...as real cajan cooks use a darker roux although it does not have the thickening qualities as a lighter roux it will still be good

Wow!  This was amazing.  I've never made a soup before, so I followed the directions as closely as I could with a few minor additions and the result was spectacular.  The bisque was so amazing that my husband (and I) are a little worried I may never be able to duplicate it ?  These are my additions: when I added the broth, corn, and bay leaf, I also added a about half of a small jar of pimentos because I thought they would give a nice touch of color and I think many crab bisque's I’ve eaten at restaurants have something red – I wasn’t sure if it was a red pepper or pimento, but the pimento worked very well and was soft and tasty in the soup..  When I added the milk, cream, and liquid crab boil, I also added three splashes of cooking sherry.  By the way, I had no idea what “liquid crab and shrimp boil seasoning” is.  I searched the spice aisle of our best grocer and found ‘superior touch better than bouillon lobster base’ and hoped for the best.  This seemed to work quite well.   I am not a Cajun cooker, but a friend gave us Tony Chachare’s “More Spice” seasoning as a gift, and three “shakes” of this Cajun spice resulted in a bisque that was not spicy until after swallowing, when a mild spice (I have young children) emerged.  This was wonderful – I hope I can re-create it!

This was absolutely delicious and very quick & easy to make.  Cooking time was more around 30 min start to finish.

I was worried about the statement that it would taste salty so I didn't add additional salt (the recipe doesn't call for Old Bay seasoning so maybe that's where she went wrong).  However, it was not salty at all.

I also didn't add the shrimp/crab boil because I didn't have any and didn't know where to get it.  I used a can (6 oz) of lump crab meat and a 1/2 pound of fresh, small shrimp (size 90-110).  I followed everything else to the tee.

Thank you!

This was good BUT, between the salt in the Creole seasoning and the salt in the Old Bay seasoning and the salt in the Worchestershire... this was like a salt lick.   Even my son who always adds more salt, thought it was too salty. I know that my Cajun BF wouldn't like this because of the salt.

I will keep the recipe, but I won't add the Old Bay or additional salt to the bisque.

I did add finely diced carrots, dried parsley (towards the end)

ps: Old Bay brand crab and shrimp boil (liquid) was used.

_____________

EDIT
5/9/16...tried it again...as I didn't see my first review (as I wasn't logged in) hehehe but saw other posts about salt".  This time...I added just shy of 2 tsps. of Tony Chachere's  creole seasoning and the Worchestershire but left out the additional salt and the Old Bay (frankly don't care for the taste anyway)....MUCH better!!! I used a # of fresh crab clawmeat as that's what I got at the fish market!

I thought this might be difficult when I read it called for a roux but it turned out quite simple and fast!  the taste was excellent, I followed the recipe exact but instead of a full lb of crab I used half crab and half crawfish tails-rinsed throughly before adding them to bisque. The taste is one I have tasted in a favorite restuarant in Lafayette, LA.  I will definitley be making again! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was good despite I didn't have any Cajun seasoning... I noticed after I already came home from the store.   Hubby liked it a lot and I tried making up for the spice with some garlic, salt, pepper, cayenne and paprika.  It didn't get as thick as I wanted so I mixed some corn starch with a bit more chicken broth and whisked in a few T. I also added a little crumbled bacon on top (not pictured) with the green onions.

We had no leftovers tonight.  This is so good! I do think that I would prefer creamed corn....next time. The recipe never specifies as to whether or not the bay leaf is removed after cooking is complete, but I always do. So I did.  I wish I had made some corn bread. As I think it would pair so well with this. Thanks!!

Delicious!!!  This was a big hit.  I made it for my monthly recipe exchange night and our theme was New Orleans cuisine.  Very easy to make.  I couldn't find liquid crab and shrimp boil seasoning so I used regular Old Bay seasoning and it was just fine.  I also served it with oyster crackers.  Will definitely make this again!  Thanks for sharing.

This bisque was scrumptious. My kids loved it. I halved the recipe then regretted it because we ate it all so quickly. This will become a regular at our house.

This is an authentic New Orleans style recipe! I gave it five stars because it is true to the usual cooking flavors and spices used in the New Orleans area.  And because it taste better than any other Corn and Crab Bisque I've ever made, and there is nothing about the recipe that I would change.  Thanks for sharing this family recipe.

Great Recipe.  It was delicious.  I doubled the roux to make the bisque thicker.  Next time I will use half the crab and add freshly boiled shrimp and crab claws.

Amazing! This soup has a wonderful creamy texture and just enough spice to counter the sweetness of the corn/crab. I will definitely be making this for years to come! As another reviewer suggested, I used a can of creamed corn and cut back just a little on the milk. I also used half and half instead of heavy cream. YUM.

Not a drop went to waste!  I could not find liquid shrimp and crab boil seasoning (on the hunt for it), instead I added some Old Bay seasoning...delish!!!!  Perfect for summer corn!

Absolutely delicious! Verrry rich. I used 2% milk one time and 1% another along with the heavy whipping cream , and it was still delicious. I did find the darker you manage to get your  roux without burning it, the richer the color. My mother, who is an excellent southern cook, raved about it to everyone. The only thing I added was about a tablespoon of Tiger Sauce to up the kick from the crab boil. Made it twice in 2 weeks.

Everyone you can find liquid shrimp and crab boil on the spice/seasoning aisle @ Walmart. The name of it is 'Zatarains' concentrate Shrimp and crab boil. It's in a little 4oz clear plastic bottle with a yellow label.

I have made this many times and ALWAYS to rave reviews...and I am no chef. I like simple recipes and didn't make this several times because of the length but finally my craving for bisque won and boy am I glad! The only thing I changed is that I use onion powder (to fool my son) and I use shrimp instead of crab. My husband has been a chef in downtown New Orleans for 20 years and he even loves it. Thanks for this AWESOME recipe. ????

Fantastic crab soup w/ bold Cajun flavor. If you like dishes where flavor is as hard to find as Waldo, move on because this isn’t for you. Added two fresh jalapenos, thinly sliced, and combined w/ onion & celery. For Cajun seasoning, we added 1 tablespoon Creole Seasoning Blend by Joslyn from this site and 1 tablespoon Badia Blackened Redfish Seasoning. For corn, used 1 can cream style sweet corn & about 1/2 cup frozen corn kernels. Subbed 32 ounces evaporated milk for milk & heavy cream. Subbed Old Bay Seasoning for the liquid shrimp and crab boil. This is the second recipe we’ve tried by YOYO78, and both were spot on perfect.

This was very good!  I hate it when people don't make the recipe as is, but I didn't have any liquid shrimp and crab boil seasoning or Cajun seasoning so I just used Old Bay and cayenne pepper.  The flavor was great, so I can't imagine how good it would be with the seasonings that were called for.  I prefer my soups a bit thicker so I think next time I make this I will use cream corn.  Great cold night dinner!

OMG.... this bisque is amazing!  I made it for our Cajun/Creole gourmet club night and it was a hit!!  Then I made it again the next day to use up the crab I had leftover and it was just as delicious!  I made with only 1/2 pound crab meat (which was plenty) and added a bit of cayenne seasoning and a touch of Old Bay.  Otherwise I made the recipe exactly as written.  I like spicy so it had a "kick" to it; but it was also rich and creamy.  Absolutely delicious!  I will make this again and again.  Even my DH, who is VERY picky, could not stop raving about this soup.  Thank you YOYO78.  :)

Excellent recipe. I added 8 oz of Tasso because I like a slightly meatier taste but other than that didn't change anything. Just as good as anything I've had in any restaurant here in the New Orleans / Baton Rouge area.

This is one of my favorite dishes and this recipe is perfect. I shared the bisque with my neighbors and they said it is better than what they have ever had in the restaurants. That says a lot because we are in New Orleans and good food is what we are known for.

Delicious! Between my husband, daughter and I-we ate the entire pot in 2 days, and I made a pretty big pot! Didn't use any cream and I didn't use lump crab- I grabbed the wrong can. But next time I will be sure to grab LUMP crab, only for texture reasons. Soup was great! I will be making this recipe again and again! Thanks!

I ended up having to use one pint of half and half in place of the milk and the cream and it was enough for the thickness I wanted for half the servings. I also added precooked small shrimp and cayenne red pepper for extra kick. Served topped with real bacon bits and the green onions with Cheesy garlic bread on the side. Absolutely wonderful on a cold day, rich and soothing!

I doubled this recipe. Amounts were perfect except possibly more roux/flour needed. Did not get as thick as I would have liked. Best thickener would have probably been to cook some small cubed potatoes into the recipe. Used fresh jumbo lump crab meat. Definitely a keeper. Would have also liked to see some additional color. Maybe tiny bit of peppers??? Some sharp cheddar cheese???...but then not very bisque like I suppose. But the basic recipe is absolutely delicious. Beware of doubling however. The original recipe makes a lot of soup. A keeper for certain !!!

This soup tasted very good, but the appearance left a lot to be desired.  It tended to look a little greasy or watery. The taste was good, but I am going to work on making it look better.

My grocery stores did not have the liquid shrimp and crab boil so I has to omit that. Did add extra Cajun spice. Soup was thick and delicious but lacked the spice I am sure the crab boil would of added.

I have made this recipe a few times now and I absolutely LOVE it! I use zatarains liquid crab and shrimp boil and mine is never ever salty.  
I tweak my recipe a bit. Once I used fresh gulf shrimp and boiled down my shrimp heads and used a cup of that and a cup of chicken broth. 
I’ve made this for others and they rave about how good it is.  Since I am from the south (less than an hour from New Orleans) it is a big compliment to me to see people going back for seconds and thirds.
Thank you for this recipe!!

Well followed it.  Didn't make roux as instructed.  Used butter to saute veggies, added flour to that when they were soft, and used creamed corn as well.  I went a bit overboard on the Cajun seasoning so this bowl has bite.  OVERALL, the version above would be simply glorious.  Mine is pretty darn tasty.

This an excellent bisque- hearty, flavorful and really not all that hard to make. I’ve debated adding some potato, but it doesn’t really need it. I thought it was going to be too heavy in the onion, but it really isn’t. The second time I made it, I added 1/4 cup of sherry, very good and I think it could use a bit more. Adding the Cajun powder to taste? Way to vague, I keep adding more and a bit of paprika to give a bit more heat but not too much, I also use twice the crab boil oil. I will perfect this! But as is, excellent!

I did not have the green onions, so they were omitted.  Also, I didn’t have fresh crabmeat so I used some leftover crab cakes and canned crabmeat.  I had corn on the cob in the freezer that I partially thawed so it could be cut off—it took two ears for the required amount. 

I really enjoyed eating this on this cool, rainy September evening!

Soup was delicious. Next time I am going to add less broth and more cream/milk. I did use seafood broth this time and it was near perfect with some homemade bread on a cool, rainy summer night.

Instead of the suggested veggies, i used a seasoning blend. I also added hot rotel. Spicy and delish!

This was incredible!  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have any liquid crab boil so I used two tsps of creole seasoning when it said to add gage seasoning.  I also cooked the vegetables in the roux and then added everything else as listed instead of adding the roux in the middle.  It still turned out great. Maybe next time I'll follow the instructions exactly and it will be heavenly.

I fixed this for friends and it was exceptional.  Living in Louisiana fresh crabmeat is always available and a must for excellent results. Hint:  using powdered milk adds richness without adding calories.

perfect! exactly what I was looking for! restaurant quality. was a bit spicy for my mom, but she is very sensitive to spice. I would consider next time putting less Cajun seasoning.. season to taste. but perfect for me! I used fresh boiled crab. I just started going crabbing every weekend. I will make this recipe again and again and again. thank you so much!

Followed the recipe completely besides that I did not have quite enough crab meat.  It was still delicious and the additional crab meat was not missed.  One of my favorite recipes now.  I'll definitely be making this again.

No, I don't think I'll ever make it again.  The bisque was a bit chalky.    Maybe I should have increased the crab boil seasoning.

My husband is very picky and highly critical of new recipes that I try. His very first bite he said "this is really good babe!" I followed the recipe except I did not have the onions or celery and I use regular Old Bay seasoning that we had because I didn't have the boil. I will be keeping this recipe to make again. Thank you for sharing!!

I cook this every year for my grown daughter's birthday and everyone loves it! I follow the recipe then use an immersion blender then add more corn, crab and sometimes chopped lobster. Very tasty, quick and easy!

So many recipes on this website have reviews that include how people modified the recipe, I recommend following this one.  It's delicious!  I would only attempt to modify the heavy cream and use whole milk if I wanted to eat more than one bowl.

This chowder is amazing... I substituted milk for 2% and did ff half and half and added chicken broth. I also added chopped bacon pieces.. My husband was jealous because I only gave him a small bowl and I had a large bowl.. Delicious!!!

I made this for Christmas 2014 and added some scallops!  It was an appetizer course, but my family loved it so much I have to make another batch and serve as our "seafood" course.  Traditionally,  it's turkey and ham, but the seafood course is here to stay. I'm making it for New Year's Day lunch 2016! I will be adding shrimp this time.

Yum! It was superb, but next time I would use half the amount of onion. I also reduced my cream to 1 cup and milk to 3 cups to reduce fat. It was still super rich and thick. I would reduce the cream and increase the milk even more next time.

I cooked the roux a lot longer aiming for a darker color, also I substituted lump crab meat for scallops and imitation crab meat(which I somewhat sauté first) The family preferred it over the real deal, which I've made several times. This dish has been  a part of our family now for a few years. Tried the new less expensive version 2 days ago and seems its here to stay! Roughly $60 for a double batch is now around $15!

Used lots of tony's and lots of old bay.  Lots of pepper, but no extra salt.  Just enough heat to make the nose run a bit, but not too much that the baby didn't like it.

Roux was golden brown when I did it (didn't cook until it got dark) and it took more like 10-12 minutes of constantly whisking on 60% burner and it turned out excellent.  

For substitutions... Instead of 2 cups of cream, used 1 cup cream + 1 cup milk.  Also, added gumbo file (sassafras) to thicken.

This was good, but not amazing as I was hopeful for after  reading some of the other reviews. Tasted like a  good restaurant quality clam chowder to us. Made a double batch as it didn't seem like a single batch would be enough for the 5 of us...my kids always want seconds...and leftovers! I did add some diced potatoes just to give it a little more texture. Would probably make again if I had access to lump crab meat again.

This would have been an easy recipe but I had fresh crabs & corn on the cob on hand so I had to shuck, boil, clean & cut everything but it was well worth it. I added cream cheese and a can of condensed potato soup and doubled the recipe. I try to  cook enough to freeze. Will diffently do this recipe again. Thanks all recipes.com

Soup was delicious!  I used a can of creamed corn instead of the frozen corn because that is what I had, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Everybody loved it!

This recipe is awesome! I absolutely love it. The only change I made was I used shrimp instead of crab. I boiled the shrimp then diced it up and put it in the pot.

I did a bit of tweaking adding two small Yukon gold potatoes, two carrots, cubed, and 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream. I also used clam base instead of chicken broth. Love the variety.

This was so good, I don't want to share it with anyone!  I gave it a 5 even though I made changes based on what I had in my fridge.  I'm sure the original is even better.  I used canned creamed corn, garlic powder, and old bay seasoning instead of liquid shrimp/crab seasoning.  I had leftover king crab meet from the other night and this was a perfect way to make the left overs go further and last for one more meal.

I made a few changes based on what I had at home.  I used Old Bay seasoning, I didn't have liquid shrimp and crab boil, green onions or a bay leaf.  I added a tsp of celery salt and some crumbled bacon.  When I served it, I added shredded cheddar cheese and more bacon.  My husband who is not really a fan of this type of soup raved about it!

I had to add a little corn starch at the end because mine wasn't thick enough, but other than that this was amazing! Crack your own crabs instead of buying the lump meat - trust me it's SO worth it. I happened to have leftover stone crab claws so that's what I used.

Beyond DELICOUS!!!!  My husband is soooooo picky but  he just loved it.  It took me a little longer on prep time and longer to keep my husband from wanting to taste it before it was done.  We did use fresh crab meat. Splurge and use fresh crab meat like suggested.  Though it's $17.99 a container at Costco. My tummy is smiling  still smiling.

Oh this is sooo yummy! I made it with imitation crab to save on cost and crossed my fingers it wouldn't come out horrible. But it's so delicious even with the fake stuff! I couldn't find liquid crab boil but was able to find the stuff that comes in the boil packets, so I grew that in there while it cooked and just removed the bag and squeezed out the excess liquid before serving. I did not have Cajun seasoning on hand so I used Old Bay and added some cayenne. Obviously I did some of my own tweaking out of necessity, but it still came out fabulous! It reminds me a lot of the crab bisque we sometimes get from Zoup--but even better flavor to the bisque! Yummy!

This recipe was great! I only had the regular crab boil not the liquid form, so I just estimated. I also used some old bay seafood seasoning along with the Cajun seasoning to give it a little extra flavor :) Everyone loved it.

I followed this exactly EXCEPT I used skim milk instead of whole. It didn't thicken up like in the picture. The flavor is really good. It took me way longer to cook than is suggested. I was trying to get it to thicken.

My husband and I are from south Louisiana, and he is OBSESSED with this!  I didn't make any changes other than used solid crab boil since I couldn't find liquid, and I used Tony's where it calls for Cajun seasoning.  This is a definite keeper!

it is super. I did not have the crab boil at hand so I omitted. I also replace chicken broth with home-made vegetable broth. I used 1 1/2 of heavy cream and 2 1/2 of 1% milk. I did not have enough heavy cream. However it turned out super creamy and rich. I will reduce the heavy cream in the future, for the sake of my waist line :). my bf loves it!

Delicious! I took a couple of the other tips. First, I waited to add the evaporated milk until the last hour so it didn't curdle.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes in the beginning. Definitely a keeper!

This was excellent bisque!  My boyfriend is a soup lover and he said it's the best he's ever had.  Even better the second day.  The only thing I changed was I added Old Bay instead of the liquid shrimp/crab boil because I couldn't find it, also used fresh corn I roasted under the broiler and since it had so much onion in it already I left out the green onions.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

We quite enjoyed this hearty soup. The only recommendation I'd make is to have a little Franks' Red Hot Sauce on hand to spice it up a bit. Delicious!

This was delicious! Based on the suggestions of others, I used a can of creamed corn and also added some cayenne pepper.  I did not have any crab/shrimp boil seasoning, but didn't miss it.  To save on calories I used half and half instead of heavy cream - this was still very rich and had great flavor. I will definitely make this again.

Loved it! Even with reducing the calories by using Land O Lakes Light butter, fat free milk and fat free half & half inplace of heavy cream..I don't think we were missing out on any flavor. I might have gone a little heavy on the cajun seasoning but I love it!
*If you never cooked with bay leaves before... remove them before eating =)
