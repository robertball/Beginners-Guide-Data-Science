I stumbled across Stacey Kauffman's Sicilian Sauage Soup recipe about a year and a half ago (on a search for an interesting minestrone), and I've been making it about once a month ever since! It's been a big hit with friends and family, and I often get requests for it.

The only modification I make is, I add a few cloves of chopped garlic to the mix. 

But with or without the garlic, it's a darn tasty soup!

This is AMAZING soup.  I used turkey sausage & added about 4 cups of Kale at the very end and simmered it for 3 extra minutes.  OMG Perfection!!  Thank you!!!

This was a really good soup! I doubled the amount of sausage, broth, and tomatoes, but left the amount of veggies the same. I also added a little garlic and crushed red pepper. We will definitely make this again!

This was wonderful soup. Will definitely make again! I added 1 more cup of chicken broth because it was a little thick (I made it in the morning and then reheated & served for dinner so it thickened up). A great find!

Delicious!  We used a little less crushed tomatoes, we used 18 oz, and we used 2 tsp of dried basil and instead of the ditalini pasta we used small shells.  We used an extra 2 cups of chicken broth to make up for less tomatoes.  I think this was a good move because it might have been too tomatoey if we would have used the whole amount of tomatoes.  Excellent soup.

I loved it!  Since some reviewers said there was too much tomato, I used only about 3/4 of the can and added some more chicken broth.  Otherwise I made it as written.  Very flavorful and hearty.

I will definitely make this again.  The kitchen smelled wonderful during the cooking process and my family really enjoyed the flavor.  It was similar to my "Sausage Minestrone soup" recipe.  The tortellini that Stay has in her dish though was really a nice addition.  I did end up using a spinach tortellini.

This soup is AWESOME!!!! I did saute some garlic with the onion. As others mentioned, I did not use the full can of crushed tomatoes.  Really, really good.

It was surprising to me that a recipe calling itself "Sicilian" didn't call for any garlic.  I remedied that by adding 3 minced cloves of garlic with the onions. Otherwise, I pretty much followed the recipe.  My husband really liked this.  As for me, although it was tasty, I felt like I was eating a bowl of spaghetti sauce.  I don't know if I'll make it again.

This is a very tasty soup.  I added some crushed garlic and a little bit more broth, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

Holy cow this soup is fabulous!  I didn't make too many changes to it but i did make a few.  I added 1lb of italian sausage and instead of parsley i used some dried thyme.  It was great!  My whole family just loved it.  I think next time I'm going to add more pasta and decrease the carrots to two.  Other than that the flavor was fantastic...Oh, I used soup base instead of broth because I like the richness that soup base gives.  Thanks for a great recipe though!!!

very tasty soup, however a bit too tomatoey. No problem though. I will just use a half can of the tomatoes next time. Also i doid use Italian TURKEY sausage as it was on sale. i will use the regular italian sausage and I am sure it will taste very good.

This was a great recipe!  I changed a few things based on what I had on hand.  First, I doubled the recipe.  I used regular breakfast sausage, only had 2 carrots so I added a green pepper. I didn't have enough check broth, so I used 5 cups chicken broth plus a can of evaporated milk, 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream, & 2 T corn starch.  I also used macaroni noodles and added 1 t oregano.  I followed the recipe cooking the noodles in the chicken broth, then I added the mixture of evap milk, cream and corn starch.  I cooked all that until slightly thick.  It was a keeper, my family loved it!

I'm sorry, I didn't care for this soup.  My guy and I both agreed it was too tomatoey.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I served it as leftovers after the first night and we ended up tossing the rest.

I'm giving this a 5 with a couple of changes. I used homemade chicken broth, with pieces of chicken; added two cloves of garlic; one green pepper; added two bay leaves; and a pinch of crushed red pepper; also had zucchini on hand so added that.
Really yummy. Can't wait for hubby to come home and try it!

My whole family loves this soup!  I made this several times and have tried a few variations which the recipe handles well.  Sustituted ditalini pasta with white beans, added garlic with the onions and chopped thick sliced bacon which I cook first in the pot and then drain fat.  I do add a little more broth, but I prefer a thicker soup and I don't add much more.  I usually double the recipe.  Thank you Stacey! Very, very good...

We really enjoyed this soup.  I used 3 links of Premio sweet Italian sausage, added 1 large clove of crushed garlic, added 1 small diced zucchini and an extra cup of chicken broth (as suggested by other reviewers).  It was perfect!  Served with some nice crusty bread.  This made a nice, filling, busy-weeknight meal.  Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Good!  I added garlic and would recommend doing it.  I added about another 3/4 can of tomatoes and an extra cup of broth.  An additional cup of broth was added after tasting it.  I read the directions quickly and missed that this recipe needed fresh parsley so I used dry.

I had to use spiced buffalo meat in place of sausage (convience & diet), but it was really good!! It was like a goulash, but less saucy & more soupy! I added extra pasta (preference) & it was fantastic!! I will certainly be making this again!!

Awesome. Doubled the recipe and then doubled the sausage, i.e. 2lbs. Added 4 cloves of chopped garlic along with a couple of dashes of Italian seasoning.  Used one 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and two 14oz cans of chopped fire roasted tomatoes plus four 14oz cans of chicken broth. I also double doubled on the Ditalini. Toasted up some Ciabatta rolls and...WOW.

I accidentally used 1lb sausage and (intentionally) added a bunch of coarsley chopped kale at the end per another reviewer.  I would have preferred some heat in this soup and will add spices next time (along with the kale and full lb of sausage).  As written this is a 3 star for me, but I think soups are meant to be experimented with in a way some other dishes aren't (baked goods, for example).  So after my modifications my family gave this 4 stars (5 if I pair it with homemade bread)!

I made this soup almost exactly as written, except I made a double batch, and I changed 4 things: 1) I added garlic after the onion softened 2) only used 28oz can of tomatoes for double batch 3) didn't add parsley (didn't have any) 4) added 14oz can kidney beans. This was super easy and super yummy! Everyone had seconds! I will definitely be making this again.

This soup was really good.  I'm not a huge sausage fan, but this wasn't overpowering at all.  I made the recipe as written, but like others I thought it was too tomatoey so I added another 1 1/2 cups of broth and that fixed it.  I also used 2/3 cup pasta instead of 1/2 cup just because I like more.  Paired it with some crusty french bread.

I was really hoping I would like this.  It sounded delicious and has been rated very high.  My husband and I both thought something was off...I followed the recipe to a T and still didn't like it.  It was too tomatoey and also VERY greasy.  Maybe my problem is that I didn't drain the grease from the sausage, but it didn't say to and there really wasn't that much grease to drain anyway.  I looked at the pictures and mine looked very similar.  I also noticed in the pics that they all looked just as greasy as mine.  Maybe I'll try it again but use ground beef instead, use tomato sauce and not crushed tomatoes and add more chicken broth.

I made this tonight for the first time.  It is also my first soup ever.  I did add zuccini and spinach to the soup, but other than that, I followed the recipe.  My husband said it was the best soup he has ever had in his life.  I found it to be very hearty, tasty and extremely easy to make with items typically on hand.  A reasonably stocked pantry can whip this up easily.

I've been using this recipe since 2003 and it never fails to win rave reviews - I just emailed it to a friend and thought I would add my first allrecipes review.  Like many others do, I increase the broth for a more soup-like consistency; however, I also reduce the tomato to about 2/3 of a can, add de-stemmed fresh spinach right at the end, and mostly use chicken or turkey sausage rather than regular pork.  This soup is definitely worth trying, it really is so delicious!

This was great!  Added a little pearl barley because I had it and used tortelini instead of ditalini.  Really wonderful flavor!  Will certainly make again!

Absolutely the best!!!Followed the notes from others and added a little more chicken broth as it did thicken up a lot.  This made a whole pot full of soup and my family..who are not soup eaters, ate the whole thing!!! Can't wait to share this recipe with others.

I made a double batch of this for a New
Year's Day get together. Everyone raved
about this soup and there was none left.
I used spice Italian Sausage and Orzo
instead of the pasta listed in the recipe. This is very very good.

This was excellent soup.  We all loved it.  I did make a couple of changes due to personal tastes.  I added a pound of sausage, three cloves of garlic, a 1/4 t. of fennel seed, and then used 6 cups chicken broth.  Served it with a thick Italian bread, and it was a huge hit!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used bowtie pasta because that was all I had.  Adding spinach to soup is one way to get kids to eat more vegetables.  It was a soup everyone enjoyed and easy to make.

I didn't  make any changes and used mild sausage so that  I could get the full flavour of the soup.  I liked it so much I didn't wait long enough for it to cool in my bowl and burned my tongue.

Very easy and yummy! I added two cups of pasta instead of half a cup because I thought it didn't seem like enough and it turned out great! Also didn't have fresh basil so I used dry basil and it still had lots of flavour.

So yummy! 2nd time I'm making it this week. My hubby loved it and requested I make it again. You don't have to change a thing! I added garlic and red pepper flakes because that's how my family likes to eat. But not necessary. So yummy!

Very good, BUT I always add noodles separately to each bowl otherwise they absorb too much liquid. I also added 3 large cloves of garlic because it's not officially Italian without it  :)

Awesome soup! I cut the tomatoes in half and added 2 cups of chicken broth.  This one's a keeper for sure.

Soooo good! I omitted the fennel seeds and celery just because I don't care for the flavor. I used fire roasted tomatoes for extra flavor. Other than that I didn't change a thing. I will definitely make this again. Great flavor!

I read the reviews and added some garlic and held back some of the diced tomatoes too! It was awesome! We will be making this over and over again! Thanks for such an excellent recipe.

I wish I had read the comments first. I would have added fresh garlic and more broth. Maybe a quarter cup more datalini? I can barely see the pasta in the soup.

An excellent and filling soup! I added a little red wine and cooked it down after adding the carrots and celery to give a little more depth (plus I love cooking with wine). 

Also, I pre-cooked the pasta in boiling water for 5 min right before adding it to the soup to avoid sucking up all the liquid since I'd read other reviewers comment on that issue. That worked really well to preserve most of the free liquid.

I made this recipe on a Sunday before the work week- my husband and I both ate it everyday and were sad to see it  gone!! It was phenomenal and I am making  it again tomorrow. I double it and add more pasta. Also a bit more sausage- I split the amount with hot and sweet mixed.

Very, very good! I made it exactly as written but added 1# of spicy italian sausage, doubled the fennel and halved the crushed tomatoes.

This recipe has an amazing flavor!  Only suggestions I have are to add some mushrooms with the other veggies and I always add 4-5 extra cups of water 'cause the soup is VERY thick otherwise.  Delicious!  My husbands favorite.

Was okay, but the sausages we found didn't quite match the taste of the dish. My husband also didn't care for the fennel seeds.
We added at least 2 cups of extra water, to make enough soup after the pasta was added, or else there would be no more broth left.

Loved this.  Added fresh spinach, 1 can Canellini beans, garlic and about 1 tsp raw sugar.  Also used 1 lb sweet italian sausage, instead of 1/2 lb.  Great with crusty bread!  Also good if you add tortellini instead of the ditallini.

Delicious! I highly recommend this recipe. I made a few adjustments to fit my tastes/available ingredients: I used a package of maple ground sausage, used 1c pasta instead of 1/2c, and added about 2c water in the end

I cook.  Alot.  I love food, I love feeding people, and I love finding recipes.  Most of the time I like to try something new, but this recipe I make more than any other.  I only make three small changes.  I add garlic, more meat, and I always at least double the recipe! I've made this for everyone I know.  Don't miss this one!

I am still on a soup kick and love trying out new ones - this one was good but like others said - it needed more broth after it sat in the refrigerator for a few hours.  So definitely keep some available.

Amazing recipe!  This is my fiance's favorite meal.  I add a few more veggies depending on what I have on hand, like frozen green beans or peas... I also drain the fat after cooking the sausage and onions-- there's more than enough to make it taste good left over anyway.
