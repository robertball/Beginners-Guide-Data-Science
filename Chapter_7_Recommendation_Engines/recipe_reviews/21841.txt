this dip has wonderful flavor. It's perfect for Fall football parties. My husband raved about it.

A new spin on a classic dip!  Everyone at my party loved it and requested the recipe.  I added some red salsa to it, as well, and it gave it some extra "zing."  Will be using this again!

Just made this dip and it was excellent! I gave it four stars because I thought the original might be a little bland so I made some changes. I didn't have any garlic cheese spread so I melted a block of cream cheese (8 oz.) and added garlic powder to it. It's probably cheaper than a garlic cheese spread when you just buy generic cream cheese anyway. I also only had one can of green chiles so I threw that in and also added some hot taco sauce and some salsa to kick it up a little. Last but not least I added half a packet of taco seasoning. This was excellent! Thanks for the idea!!!

Great recipe. Served with Ore-Ida® Tater Tots® which paired perfect with the dip. Next time I will sub a can of jalpenos for 1 can of the green chiles.
