I thought this was amazing.  I didn't have the Caraway seeds though, so had to sub...used half celery seed and half cumin seed.  I also added a bit of garlic powder and some black pepper, and used EVOO rather than Veg. oil.  And we used the charcoal grill: about half hour one side, flip, another half hour or so, check temp.   We planned on having leftovers, but we ate it all right away.  It was amazingly juicy and a ton of good flavor.  Will be making this on a regular basis.  I am going to buy caraway seeds today, so I will use it next time.  I am sure it will be just as good!

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I put all the spices in my small food chopper & made gravy with the drippings, chicken broth & some flour thickening.  No other spices needed except maybe a little pepper.  I'll definitely make this one again - next time for company.

I made this with a 2# pork loin. I used the exact spice rub, but I rubbed the pork with olive oil and fresh ground black pepper, than rubbed the spices onto it, wrapped tightly with plastic wrap and kept in the fridge for about 3 hrs. before roasting. I roasted on a rack surrounded with red baby potatoes seasoned with rosemary, olive oil and salt and pepper. I followed the time and temp. and had a tender a juicy roast with perfectly baked potatoes for dinner. I recommend highly.

This recipe was incredibly good and very easy to prepare.  Slicing it thinly for sandwiches the next day was a great idea.  The caraway crust gave great flavor to the sandwiches; I just added a bit of horseradish/mayo dressing.

Excellent. I only took away one star because the cooking time was not enough. The inside was still raw. Other than that, it was good.

The whole family loved this recipe...the coating tasted great without overpowering the flavor of the pork. We had it with potato pancakes and apple sauce...YUM!

We did not care for the taste.  I felt so strong about this that I had to join so that I could review this recipe.
NOT GOOD!
*******************************************
I found that the new bottle of caraway seed has a strange taste which accounts for my above review. We have disposed of that caraway seed and my review should be disregarded.

Nothing special but still a good recipe.  I used the left over meat to make a wonderful sandwich.

Family and I love this recipe, except I like throw some veggies and water under the rack in the bottom of the roasting pan. It increases the cook time but the wait is worth it, because when the potatoes, onions, and carrots are cooked in the seasoned pork loins drippings, the taste is absolutely wonderful. Also, this main dish goes great when mated with bread dumplings, cabbage, and a tasty pilsner.

Made many times. Dry mustard, prepared mustard, thyme, oregano, garlic. Use 'em all or leave some out. I got a great flavor the last time and I wondered what it was....cumin residue in the spice grinder! Just a touch. But I've done it every way. 
Also, always use the fattier cuts to make this. Even the loin has a fatty end. I've done this with butts and shoulders and it's still fantastic!
For those who find it a bit sour, do what I always do: marinate the meat in a sugar and salt brine for at least an hour up to a day or even two. The sugar involved takes away the slight bitterness, if that is what turns you off.
The salt removes dead blood quite efficiently and that will always make pork, chicken, or turkey less bitter. God, Himself  told the Hebrews to do this. There must have been a reason.
Middle Europeans literally live on this. I second their approval.

I changed this recipe; I mixed horseradish sauce, garlic, and rosemary and a little olive oil into a paste. Rubbed the paste on a pork loin flat side up and it was AWESOME! What an amazing dish.  My husband loved it.

Yummy.  I used a 2 lb. pork loin and made the recipe exactly as stated.  It was very good.
