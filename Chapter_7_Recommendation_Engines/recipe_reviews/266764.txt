I really liked this. It is so nice to be able to find a drink recipe that fits  into my diet. Living in Florida, a margarita really hits the spot and it's good to know I can enjoy one without totally falling off the keto wagon! I have made this with the sweetener and without. I like it better without because I am not a big fan of sweet drinks anyways. I think the lime juice adds enough sweet/tartness. But that is my personal preference.

We made it and were VERY impressed with the outcome.  We used swerve as the sweetener and there was no aftertaste.  I would never have thought to use the orange LaCroix sparkling water as my topper, but it was ideal.  Tasted like a margarita you might get at a restaurant, and it really hit the spot!

I loved it!  I've been pining for a margarita but will NOT do sugar due to the Keto plan that is working so well.  This recipe hit the spot.  I did add a little more tequila just to keep it nice and strong.

Amazing.  Better than expected.  I made regular margs for the family, then made this one for me, and it was just as good.

This was a great low carb option for a margarita.  It was delicious and refreshing!  I did double the lime juice and I absolutely love the touch of sparkling water.  Thank you for the recipe!

Used lime instead of orange sparkling water and it was still delicious! This will be a summer staple!

Absolutely delicious. I used fresh squeezed organic lime juice. Tres organic white tequila. I instead used one packet of truvia, therefore a little lower in carbs.. I used Polar tangerine lemon seltzer. Additionally, I added Angostura Orange Bitters for more orange flavor. Fresh and mostly organic. Refreshing. A brand new Keto drink to add to my weekend lineup of choice Keto drinks. Thank you.

Perfect! Used powdered Swerve and grapefruit LaCroix and organic tequila. Pretty much guilt free!
