My husband likes his log REALLY full, so I doubled the peanut butter. I didn't really measure it, I just filled the divot in the middle of the celery. He inhaled it.....and then asked for another. ;)

I was really quite surprised.  I've had peanut butter on celery before but this recipe is a nice change.  The dried cranberries add a nice sweetness to it.  It looks like the grandkids are going to have to share these!  Thank you senkyb for sharing this recipe.

These are really a good alternative to cream cheese and celery.  Will make this again for an alternative.  Great for a snack at work.

I used to watch some daycare kids and during "bug" week for a snack I would make them ants on a log. It was this recipe with raisins. Kids who would never eat celery, for some reason, would eat these. The red cranberries might actually look more appealing. However, even though I made it for them, and they loved it, it was just not for me. I didn't care for the taste of celery and peanut butter together. However, it worked great for the "bug" and "garden" lessons, and the kids thought they were pretty neat!

Quite different but I don't think it beats using raisins.
