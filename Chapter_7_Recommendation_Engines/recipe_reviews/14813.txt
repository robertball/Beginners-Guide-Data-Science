Suggestion-use croissant dough for the crust (lay flat and connect the triangles). Gives a nice buttery flavor and flaky texture.

Easy and delicious! I used pineapple cream cheese with the mangos and it was wonderful. I took this to a dinner party for an appetizer and it disappeared. I've also tried it with pineapple cream cheese with manderine oranges! Yummy!!!! So easy!

Also good, for a breakfast treat, using English muffins or bagels.  I prefer fresh mangoes.  So fast and easy.
