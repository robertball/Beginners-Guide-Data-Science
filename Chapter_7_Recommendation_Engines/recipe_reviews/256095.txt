This is awesome. Just one point to make. Leave it in the fridge overnight to get the right consistency of the custard. 3 hours wasn't enough. So glad I found this. Thanks!

Made this - good on the first try - but a little ordinary.  Second time I used Bourbon Vanilla & it got a LOT better. Mixed in a little vanilla sugar for the burnt sugar.

Good basic recipe to play around with.

LOVE this recipe! The only thing I took out was the salt as I feel it didn't need it. And it was DELICIOUS!!! I have made it several times in the past few weeks and will continue to make it! If you want to try different flavors, just switch out the Vanilla extract with any other extract you'd like. I have tried Orange, Almond, and Coconut and they were all FANTASTIC!

Easy to make, creamy and delicious! However I only followed the ingredients and cooked it in sous vide cooker on 176'F for one hour. It turned out perfect! Will keep the recipe and make again for special occasions (too fat to consume often, lol...).

This has become my go- to recipe for crème brulee!! It's absolutely delicious and so simple but it does need that extra time to sit in the fridge to get the desired texture

Delicious!  Easier than oven cooking!
Used Canning Tongs with Ramekins... worked like a Charm!
Thank you!

YIPPY YAHOO  !!!!! I always struggled making Creme Brulee in a conventional oven, it always came out too running - like custard.  I googled "Creme Brulee in a slow cooker", and hey presto, I found this one !!I

I  followed this recipe exactly and it was cooked perfectly !!!
It looks like Creme Brulee is back on the menu !!!

Easy tasty but never hardened. I cooked a small amount in the oven and the taste was equal and hardened to a custard consistency
