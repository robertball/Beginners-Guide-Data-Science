Delicious! It's quick AND easy, but has so much flavor. This was my first time using the Swanson Thai Ginger broth and boy, is it ever tasty! It's perfectly seasoned, with just a slight hint of heat. It really does take the guesswork out of making soup and fiddling with seasonings. The lemongrass, ginger, curry, coconut, lime flavors are already IN the broth, so no fuss!  I made this exactly as written, and the only thing I'd suggest is adding more broth since the rice noodles absorb all the liquid (and it definitely doesn't reheat well because of this). I'd even suggest doubling the broth if you want a more soup-like consistency, and serve immediately. Add in shrimp for protein and you got yourself a nicely balanced meal. This one's a keeper!

Made no changes other than adding curry which was not listed in the ingredients and infusing the stock with ginger. 
Overall not very impressed.

We actually couldn't find that specific Swanson broth at Ralphs so we opted for vegetable broth but added ginger, lime juice and fish sauce to give it some flavor. 

The dish was tasty, less a soup and more a very saucy noodle, although didn't remind us of a curry in any way. 

Also, we doubled the recipe for 6 people and still ate every bite so beware if you have hungry diners!

This recipe is missing something... I added chicken breast too. Not a lot of flavor here and kind of bland. Giving it 3 stars because it is easy to make!

Wow this is so simple but packed full of flavor!  I could not stop eating it... turning the 6 servings into 4.  I used my own vegetable stock and added lemongrass, lime juice, curry and ginger at others' suggestions and it tasted great!

Very good. Couldn't find the Swanson broth so I used 32 oz of vegetable broth and added ground ginger, 1 tablespoon. I also added sliced water chestnuts. And some lime juice to the broth. It wasn't very 'soupy' so next time I make it I would maybe double the broth. It was very good though.

A filling healthy meal.  I used angel hair pasta, carrots, mushrooms, broccoli, chicken and shrimp.  Cooked pasta separately and topped with the veggie/meat/broth. Couldn't find the broth recipe called for so just used chicken broth and added garlic and ginger.
