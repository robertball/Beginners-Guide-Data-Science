Iâ€™ve always wanted to try Samosas and what better way to try them than to make them! These definitely did not disappoint. The only change that I made was using a 1/2 tbsp instead of the full tablespoon, because the won tons were breaking from being too full. Either that or use egg roll wrappers instead of the won tons.

I love this recipe!  Only changes were I used jarred minced goner and garlic, and used ground beef/pork blend (all I had on hand).  Omg, you would never notice there was pork in it. 

My first bite I thought the flavour a bit mild but a couple spoonfuls later I discovered it is spot on.  Just enough spice to make your mouth warm but not so much that you're running for the milk lol.   I will definitely be making this again soon!

Pretty good. Lots of work; the spices were a bit overwhelming, but all in all, pretty good.
