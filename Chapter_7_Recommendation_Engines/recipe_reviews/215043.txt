The reason this hasn't been reviewed is that after drinking just one of these, no one remembered.

Great drink to have at home as long as you don't have to drive.  We don't like beer, so replaced that with a splash of sprite.  Also I use gin instead of tequila.  You absolutely cannot taste the alcohol, so do not serve this at a party and allow people to drive home after-wards.

Very good and the beer adds some needed carbonation.  I made this in a pitcher with a 1/4 cup of the liquors and 1 1/2 cups of grenadine, a full bottle of New Glarus Spotted Cow and 3 cups of orange juice.

Best drink ever. Made it for birthday everyone loved it. But it will creep up on you. Drink responsibly. Fruit punch taste can't taste the beer. Next time will try champagne instead of beer. Making it bubbly fruit punch

This drink is light and fruity but not too sweet.  It is strong and it hits you later, sort-of like a good rum punch does.  Fun and tasty drink but you have to like fruity.

Yum! I had to review the recipe before I forgot I drank it! We doubled the recipe (except for the grenadine - used 3oz), used reduced sugar orange juice and this was very good! I'm a sucker for sweet red drinks and I plan on making a pitcher of these for my next party. Great recipe!

Before you make this drink, ensure you have munchies on hand; you're gonna need them.  I made a double batch, threw it in a pitcher and into the fridge.  Could not find grenadine anywhere so went with a Mountain Dew Code Red. You could also use Cheerwine or Big Red; works about the same.  I don't know about the grenadine, but the other options do not come up with an overly sweet drink.  As others have stated, use a good beer and plenty of ice.  Warning; you will NOT  taste the alcohol.  But two 8 ounce drinks later, standing up was interesting...Under NO circumstances should anyone attempt to drive after  drinking one of these; you simply won't anticipate the effect of the alcohol. It's a good tasting, easy to drink, strong as hell punch.....By the way, I didn't have a terrible hangover the next day.

This is surprisingly good.  I wasn't sold reading the ingredient list, but thought I'd give it a whirl (and give it a face :) ) anyway.  I subbed pineapple for orange juice, per personal preference.  The beer I used was what we have on tap, Yuengling's Lord Chesterfield Ale.  I liked it as is, but after tasting added a healthy splash of Diet 7-Up and found I preferred it w/the extra bubbles.  Cheers!

Very good indeed!  Too easy to drink...tastes like fruit punch!  I cannot stand the taste of beer, but you can't detect it in this concoction.

Overall a great drink but we made a few changes.We cut back on the grenadine,triple sec  and beer along with adding pineapple juice and grape juice. It was perfect! Remind you that my  husband and my myself are NOT ones that does mixed drinks! We usually do scotch or cognac with 1 small cube but we decide to step outside of our box. We recommend this drink.

The addition of beer is an odd choice - I wonder if soda would be better. I followed the recipe and mixed together the liquor, then added beer on top of it. It tasted like exactly that - a drink with beer on top of it. It was a little better as the ice melted but I would recommend trying blending all components together instead of adding beer on top.

Followed the recipe and made a large drink!  Guest loved it and I was pleasantly surprised with the taste.  We will see how she feels after she finishes the drink!  She wanted something strong but drinkable and enjoyable!

This has become one of my  favorite drinks overnight.  Excellent share.  I have tried different orange juice types and such.  but they are all great and taste virtually identical.  I wonder if there is a difference in beer types?

I quadrupled this recipe and everyone loved it. Not sure how no one can taste the alcohol cause I sure could. It was still very good and will cont making this from time to time. We could def feel the effects after drinking just 1/2 a glass of it. :) For those who don't like beer (like me), this is one way you can cause you really can't taste it.

Yummy, but I still like a good long island better.  I used cheep bar liquir and I could taste the alcohol.  I'm sure if you use top shelf there wouldn't be an alcohol taste.  Thanks for a good summer drink tgardner.
