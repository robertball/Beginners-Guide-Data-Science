Overall a good recipe however it was a little dry.. Not at all spicy so if you like a kick add something more to it.  We'll eat it again but I'll add sosme things.

I was looking for a way to use left over Mexican cornbread. I used this recipe as a base using what I had in cabinets. I like spicy, so I used Tastefully simple southwest seasoning when cooking chick. Used 1 can crm mushroom, 1can rotel, 1 can nobler corn, 2 cups cooked chicken, 1T Tastefully Simple Southwest Season (spicy) about a cup of Mex blend cheese and 1/2 of a 9x9 pan of Mexican cornbread.  Mixed together and baked on 400 for about 30 
minutes. My family loved it! Will make it again. Will try adding pinto or black beans next time. Yummy, thanks for the idea!

this was perfect for a mid-week dinner, especially since I happned to have everything at hand.  We also topped with some sour cream on our plates.  I really like using cornbread stuffing!

Pretty good, filling and makes a lot, so if you've had a hectic week and you have a fussing child this is the dinner for you. I served it with tortilla chips for a crunch. Do as others have said and use more cheese, really as much as you want.

Very tasty.  When cooking the chicken, I first coated with flour and a mixture of black pepper and a bit of Montreal Steak Seasoning, then sautee'd in thin layer of canola oil.  Added a level of zing and texture.

My husband & I love this recipe.  It's simple, easy & filling.  We like it spicier, so instead of the green chilies & Salsa, I used a can of Rotel(with juice)which made it spicier & a little more moist.  Will fix this one often.
