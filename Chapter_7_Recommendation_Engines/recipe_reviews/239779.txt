Very nice indeed.  The only change I would make in the future is to add a small amount of cayenne to enhance the flavors.  Thanks for sharing.

I doubled the recipe, and added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper (as previous reviewer suggested). Delicious side dish, sweet and spicy - however, next time I'll probably only use 1/4 tsp of the pepper (for double batch).

I made this . Very good and did not change the recipe.  Will roast my carrots using this recipe from now on.  Thanks for posting.

Perfect just as stated! My son that wonâ€™t eat cooked carrots really liked them and finished his.

I read the reviews and also added a touch of cayenne.  These were absolutely delicious!  I cut regular carrots up and roasted them on the foil (thank you for that tip!).  They do shrink up so make more than you think you want.  My hubby loved them too....thanks for a great recipe!

Carrots will cook quicker if slice pieces in half. I saved carrot leaves as a garnish.

Good mix of flavors. The most recent time I made these I overcooked the baby carrots until almost burned but the sugar and butter carmelized to a candy coating.

No changes to recipe.   Excellent when paired with a brisket done in a dutch oven.   Tender and sweet, and the cumin added a fantastic addition to the flavor

Recipe was quick, easy, super tasty.  I boil carrots  for 15 minutes before baking them and leave them in the oven, temp off until they shrivel a little bit.  Huge hit!

Didn't have any cumin so Smoky Paprika was used and it was delicious.  My wife loves them and next time I'll use the cumin.

The cumin puts a different spin on the flavor.  I like it a lot, but would add less cumin next time.  I added butter after it was done to calm the cumin!  Still liked it enough to fix it again!
