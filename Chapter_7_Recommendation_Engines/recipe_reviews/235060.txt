This came out pretty good, but not awesome. I think the chicken lacked flavor, even though I added Italian seasoning to it. It would have been better if it were breaded with Italian bread crumbs. I used rotini instead of spaghetti. I think the recipe needs double the amount of pizza sauce, mostly to cover the chicken. Also, the sauce/water combo wasn't enough to cover the noodles, so part if it came out hard. It needed more cheese, too. I added mushrooms since I love mushroom pizza, and it gave it some nice flavor. I'd make this again, but with the changes I mentioned.

Well, Rhoda, this certainly took care of our pizza craving AND our comfort food craving!  Yum!  I thought since you used wheat rigatoni pasta that it would be OK for me to use my Trader Joe's pasta.  I also used TJ's Traditional Marinara Sauce.  Since this was just for the two of us, I pared down the recipe for 2 servings.  But then I goofed and put all the required sauce on the bottom with the uncooked pasta.  That meant that I needed to add more for the top layer.  But no problem!  It all worked out well.  Delicious!  Not free of calories, but certainly free of required work to fix dinner!  Thanks for making us happy campers!

This was delicious but very heavy. I think next time I might try cubing the chicken instead of leaving the breasts whole, or I may make with boneless skinless chickenthighs for smaller pieces and to make it easier to portion.

This was a great way to use pizza ingredients everybody loves to reamp the same boring way to make chicken breasts. I like the idea of a reviewer who suggested to make a breading to use on the chicken breasts,BUT that would totally change the original recipe and make it into chicken parmesan.  The only change I made was that I didn't add any pasta to the dish until after it was baked. I premade  cooked rotini for hubs and zoodles (zuchini noodles), to mine to lower the carbs. We liked it well enough to make again when pizza cravings need to be satisfied.:D

This is a potentially great recipe. I used penne and partially boiled the pasta before adding it to the dish to make sure it cooked. I also added mushrooms with the pizza toppings and used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts to have smaller pieces. However, the chicken didn't cook underneath everything else, so I had to pull them out and cook them separately on a baking sheet for an extra 8 minutes before adding it back to the pasta. The chicken was a bit bland even though I added small amounts of salt, pepper, basil, and parsley. I will attempt this recipe again and probably keep the chicken separate when it cooks, as well as add more seasoning.

I tried this with1 pound of chicken and proportioned other ingredients. It needed more sauce and more water and less cooking time. It came out dry and undesirable.

This recipe was very okay.  It was good enough for the first time I made it.  I wish I had seasoned the chicken better and I wish I had used a pasta with some texture, the angel hair pasta clumped together.   I wish it had been saucier.  I probably will make it again and make some changes.  It definitely had potential to become a keeper.

Used chicken stock instead of water, salami instead of pepperoni, added fresh garlic, marjoram, thyme, rosemary and parsley. Also only had provolone on hand. The cooking time is off. It's more appropriate for bone in. I cut it in half and did the same for time. Also, added more marinara. I used a 1/2 jar of Muir Glen even though I 1/2 the recipe  Chicken was dry. However, my daughter asked for 2nds on the pasta. I used penne. I'd make again w my revisions.

This is definitely a kids meal. Made it for me, hubby, two teens and it was just okay. I used spaghetti and it was really hard to serve-with the spaghetti buried under the boneless breasts. If I would do this again, I would add green pepper, cut the breasts into chunks or slices, and use a short pasta or break up the spaghetti. Because it tastes like a pizza, I'm sure would appeal to the younger crowd.  I also thought that the amount of spaghetti seemed to be a bit too much (I added more sauce after seeing that from someone else), and think the whole pound of pepperoni is too much. I added a bit less than 3/4 lb and that was fine.

It was just ok. I used angel hair instead of the spaghetti. It needed a little more water added to the sauce. Maybe just cook the whole thing a little less would work.  Probably will not make it again. Husband was not impressed.

My family loved it! Since I'm allergic to tomato, I made 2, one with Marinara sauce and one with Alfredo sauce. It was really good. My husband said the one with the roasted garlic Alfredo sauce was more flavorful.

We loved this one. My husband had 2 helpings plus leftovers for lunch the next day. I especially like one dish meals allowing me a quicker clean up. I used what I had on hand (spaghetti sauce and smoked sausage) and it turned out great! Looking forward to having it again. I sent the recipe to my sister, who remains a picky eater, and let her know that there is nothing in this recipe that she doesn't like and it is great for her busy home as well.

Should the spaghetti be cooked first or the juices from the sauce will cook it in the oven?
