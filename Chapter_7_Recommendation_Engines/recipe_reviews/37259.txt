First time making pasties (apparently the correct pronunciation is "past-eez"), and was a bit disappointed, especially considering all the time one puts in to make them from scratch. They were not a hit with my family. Although the filling was good, the pastry was thick and very dry (perhaps the whole wheat flour was the culprit here ?). The maximum amount of filling I could fit in one was about 2/3 cup, and this was even after rolling out the dough to 9" diameter. After making the eight pasties, I still ended up with 8 cups of vegetable mixture left over (it won't go to waste). Unless you have a really LARGE skillet, you may find you'll need a large roasting pan to cook the veggies. Use a small turnip; this will reduce the amount of excess. 45 minutes baking time was more than necessary. I removed my final batch after 35 min., and the pastry was just as hard as if I had left it in for the full 45 min.

This rating is based on the pastry only as I did my own thing for the filling. It turned out lovely, I followed it exactly, tender and a deep golden colour, amount was bang on 8 huge ones. Hubby and 2 adult sons were very impressed ( I can see fights for the leftover ones!)

I was particularly looking for a chicken vegie pasty recipe. So I just added 1/2 kilo of diced breast chicken, swapped the vegie cube for a chicken cube and got thumbs up all round. Thanx for a great 'fast food'at home dina.

The filling of this is great, I will say though be careful not to overwork the dough or it will be hard as a rock.  Try to work the dough as little as possible to make it work.

I thought this was great, but I have to admit that I used frozen Puff Pastry - I've NEVER been successful with pastry-making, too heavy handed perhaps.
I can think of so many fillings based on this basic one - it's a versatile dish, very easy and quick.  Cooked, they freeze well, too.

These were not bad,the filling was tasty but I agree with others, a bit dry.I come from Micigan and loved the pasties from the UP. People from all over the country come there just to get one.They are made with beef  and suet is added for moisture texture and flavor.The end product is a large delicious meat pie,  It is served with a brown gravy and is piping hot.Those Cornish miners from years ago wrapped them up in a warm cloth and put them in a metal container. When they ate them hours later they were still warm.The making of a pastie is a long laborious procedure.On that note I will give a 4 star rating as the filling was tasty..But...I will still make a true pastie once in a while.

I thought the crust was extrememly dry. The filling was excellent--I added browned ground beef to the mix. I think this would be really good with a different pastry recipe.

I really liked this recipe. I added all the vegetables I had and they turned out great. On the Pastie I just added a little extra water until I felt like it was the right texture. Also it is a good idea to put the dough in the fridge until the vegetables are done. This allows the sticky-ness of the dough to not be as strong so they are easier to roll out.

Review just for filling-- I used a yeasted dough as the crust, which was delicious. The filling is amazing, and this made exactly the right amount for 8 pasties. Could have used a little more salt in the filling--I will probably add an extra half a teaspoon of bouillon next time. (I had powdered bouillon instead of cube, because it's cheaper, tastes the same, and it easier to use.)

I really enjoyed these, but the guys thought they we're missing something (a bit dry).  So, they ended up dipping them in ketchup and BBQ sauce...you see what I put up with!  But I will definately make them again, but tweek with the recipe.

5 Stars for the filling.  2 Stars for the pastry.  I tried this twice.  The first time I used the pastry recipe here, and it was too hard.  Though that may have been me overworking the dough.  The second time I bought the refrigerated pie dough at the store (they didn't have puff pastry), they turned out amazing!  The filling is awesome!  I also made a mushroom gravy with vegetable stock to go with it, since we are vegan.  It was excellent.  Even my carnivore brother loved it!

Our family is vegetarian and were very excited about these.  The consensus is that it's pretty good, extremely filling, however the filling is dry.  

A few of the reviews had already mentioned the dry quality of the filling and so I had upped the water from 2 tbsp to 1 1/2 cups, also adding an extra bullion cube so as not to lose flavor.  Alas, those pesky potatoes just wouldn't allow it.  Next time, I think I'll try adding a dollop or two of prepared veggie gravy inside before sealing them up.  

As for the crust, it smelled just heavenly while baking!  My son says he doesn't like the "crunchies" in it, but I say the wheat is good for him and my husband I both liked it that way.  

This is a keeper, with a slight tweak in the filling department.

Waaaaaaaaay too much flour for this recipe. I used about half of the white flour recipe.  Still turned out dry.  The flavor was good but not really that moist.

I used a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup in place of the olive oil, water and mushrooms.  This was per my Grandma's recommendation. (just straight out of the can, I did not "prepare" the soup at all....)

I used my grandma's pie crust recipe for the pastry, and they turned out great!  Not too bad for my first ever pie crust or pastie experiment....

There is still about half of the filling mixture left over, so I think tommorrow I will try and make these again!

I am rating this as five stars because the filling is amazing! I know the dough traditionally is supposed to be heavy. I didn't care for the dough though so I remade with biscut dough and a rolling pin. We liked that much better. Thank you for the great recipe we will use our modified version over and over!

Made these as written, but added half a can of mushroom soup to the filling. Next time I would leave out the potatoes.

I can't get turnips where I am, so I just made them without. This was my first attempt at anything like a pastie, and they were SO GOOD. My children scarfed them down. I have saved the recipe to make again in the future. Just be forewarned that these make really big pasties and are super filling. Unless you have a super-big eater in your family, recalculate the recipe to plan for one for everyone. I made these for 3 of us and we ate them for 3 meals. Not that anyone complained. :)

Our all time favorite recipe; we make a bunch of these when we go camping, very solid food, and they keep well in this fairly traditional crust.

Based on all the reviews, I opted to buy the pre made pie crust instead of making from scratch. And I wasn't disappointed! Crust and filling turned out great! Everyone loved this. I also switched up the veggies. I sautéed onions and garlic, then added red orange and yellow bell peppers, carrots, and zucchini. Then when those were almost done, I added shredded chicken and broccoli. Took off heat after only a minute and mixed in one can of cream of mushroom soup. Cut up pre made pie crusts into smaller empenada sized pieces, then filled with mixture.   Good thing about these are that you can really fill them with anything! Will def make this again, and try different filling ingredients.

I added a pinch of baking soda while making the dough. The crust was pretty good, not too dry.  I didn't have bouillon, so I added half a tablespoon coriander powder and quarter tablespoons of turmeric and black pepper.  I would likely double these if/when I use this recipe again.  This is to taste of course.  I used a cup of water instead of the 2 tablespoons.  Overall a wonderful base recipe.  Thanks, Alexandra.

I was disappointed that after all that work it was extremely dry.
