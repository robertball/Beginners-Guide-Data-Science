Love this because it's quick and easy.  It doesn't quite have the same taste as regular manicotti because of the string cheese substitution.

This was quick and easy.  Loved it.  Great reheated, if any left overs.  I had to make myself save one for lunch at work the next day.  Will make this time and time again.

Good and easy.  Used spaghetti sauce with italian sausage and topped them with an italian cheese blend.  Served with salad and garlic toast.

This was a GREAT and EASY recipe.  My family isnt fond of ricotta that you would typically fill manicotti with, so this was a great alternative!  :)

What a GREAT idea!!  Especially for kids helping in the kitchen!  Try it with cooked Italian bulk sausage stuffed into either end of the manicotti after you slide the string cheese in.  Wonderful!  Thanks for sharing this concept!

This recipe was certainly easy to stuff, but I'm not sure I like the string cheese as the filling. It didn't really fill the shell and didn't melt like I would have liked. It tasted pretty good but I think I would prefer a ricotta cheese filling.
