This is the first time I'm writing a review but I just couldn't help myself. This is literally what I put on my face as a moisturizing anti-inflammatory mask. (minus the pepper) I always make a tea with the leftovers. Use organic honey just rub the mixture on your face. Let it sit for 15 mins (enjoy the tea while waiting) then wash off with a warm face cloth. It's a great for clearing your skin from inside out.
