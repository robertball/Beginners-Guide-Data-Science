Great healthy cake.   For anyone wondering... I substituted whole wheat flour for 2 of the cups of flour with no ill effect. Also, I baked it in a bundt pan (the person I was baking it for could not have any type of icing, so I thought a bundt shape would be prettier), and it came out fine.

This was great!  My husband is a health and fitness nut and didn't want a birthday cake that had any refined sugar.  He loved this, and so did my kids, who have no problem gobbling down refined sugar!  Glad to have found a cake to please everyone!

This is a great carrot cake recipe!  As I keep finding with the cakes I've been making lately, this cake tastes even better after the day it is made.  I used 2 9-inch rounds for this cake.  I did find the frosting for this cake to be a bit "strange".  It's mainly just cream cheese, and as a result, the honey "separated out" once I had iced the cake.  By the second day, the cake was looking stranger and stranger (a brown, streaky appearance and the icing had split along the line where the two cake layers come together)...but it sure did taste good!  If anyone has some tips to prevent this, please post!

This recipe is the only one I've found up to the task of replacing my sugar carrot cake. This is a great recipe! Just as good and moist as the other cake. I made it as muffins for my 2 year old's birthday, and they tasted GREAT as muffins. Very moist, very flavorful, very yum. And since honey is a whole food, it doesn't do a whammy on your body the way sugar does. Yay!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!
For those of you looking for a healthier alternative to refined sugar.  This takes the cake!!  I also used 3 cups of carrots instead of 2 and used safflower oil instead of vegetable.  I try to bake with honey as much as possible, and the "impossible" seems to be getting easier and easier.  Keep the baking with honey recipes coming!!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Brava!  This is a wonderful recipe. I've made it twice and I liked it both times, a little better the second time when I increased the carrots to 3 cups and the pecans to 1 1/2 cups. It was moister and very dense. If you don't like a dense cake, leave the amounts the same as the original recipe.  The moisture was there both times I made it. The cream cheese frosting is to die for and to decorate the cake, I crushed a Nonni's Gingerbread Macadamia nut biscotti and sprinkled it on top.  It is a limited time release biscotti that I bought at Sam's Club and had on hand available for this Fall time of year.  It added a nice pretty golden dusting to the top of the cake and although the flavor came through a little, it didn't overpower the flavor of the cake.
Top Notch recipe!

I made this, using fine carrot pulp from carrot juicing, and raw, unfiltered honey. The honey blended well with the cream cheese and stayed blended, even overnight. Then I served it to some of the most demanding dinner guests imaginable: fellow churchmen eating a pot-luck meal. After one hour, it was three-fourths gone. All who tried it, loved it, and at least fifteen people asked for the recipe.  Honey is a flavor enhancer. Refined sugar dominates any mix it goes into, so that what you taste is flavored sugar. But honey does not suppress and dominate other flavors; it brings them out. So you can actually taste the carrots, the pineapple, the spices, and the walnuts, with a bare hint of extra sweetness.  And best of all, it produces no "sugar high" and "sugar crash," nor does it make you drowsy after you eat it, nor suppress your immune system, as refined sugar tends to do.

This was excellent! the pineapple made it really moist, and it was just the right sweetness. I actually used 1/2 cup maple syrup and 1 cup of honey, and it turned out really nice. frosting is wonderful also. very simple and easy to make in very little time!

Very good delicious cake.  I use my food processor to grate the carrots, walnuts, and pineapples very finely, so my kids don't see them.  Then they love it, and I feel good that they aren't eating refined sugar.

Very good cake.  Not as sweet as traditional, but in my opinion even better.  My family loves this cake and it is not so sweet as to send my daughter into orbit like many sweets can.

Great for having no sugar! But I will put in a whole 20 oz can of pineapple or add more oil if there is a next time, because it was a little dry.

A perfect cake to make for my Grandpa's birthday party! He cant have sugar and this was just what I was looking for. We didn't make the icing because he doesn't eat cheese instead we topped it with my mom's homemade dairy free ice cream. Next time I make this cake I will add 1 cup raisins. He is also allergic to wheat but no problem it was easy to substitute spelt flour for wheat.

My carrot cake recipe is better - I think I'll just try subbing the sugar with honey. For the frosting, DO NOT use lowfat cream cheese - it's like glue.

Fabulous! We were looking for a good sugar-free cake, for my my daughter's first birthday.... as we try to avoid giving her sugar.  We made this cake... and it was a HUGE hit with everyone, esp my health conscious friends at her birthday party!!

Very good, will likely make again. Good served hot, with frosting, like a bread pudding. It looked like ithad too much honey, so I put 1/3 cup honey instead of the 1 1/2 cup. I also pureed half a can of pineapple and half a canned peach. For the frosting I used vegan cream cheese and maple syrup, honey, vanilla, and it tasted vaguely like a vegan ice cream bar. I also put in 3 1/2 cups of carrots, and for anyone wondering, gluten-free flour works just fine here. Excellent with roasted walnuts on top.

Delicious and perfectly sweet! I used a 16oz can of crushed pineapple, pecans instead of walnuts, and added 1 c of chopped dried tart cherries. I baked the cake in two 8" round cake pans. I cut each layer in two to make a four layer cake.  I doubled the frosting and it was the perfect amount for my four layer cake.

I followed the ingredients exactly (except the frosting) and it's awesome!  I baked it in a sheet pan instead of 9x13 pan (it only took 18-20 minutes to bake).

If you are used to not having much of any sweets, this may satisfy your sweet tooth craving for carrot cake. However, if you're looking to avoid refined sugar and still get a tasty treat...you are better off indulging in a small slice of the full-sugar stuff. Pretty tasteless unless you put a load of cream cheese frosting on it. Will stick to the "real deal" next time.

I was pleasantly surprised by this cake.  I kind of knew this might be something I would like since I am not a big fan of sugary sweet desserts.  I made this recipe into cupcakes for the Valentines party at my son's daycare.  I was not sure that the kids (2 year olds) would like them since they were not that sweet but I did not want my son to have a bunch of artificial colors and super sweet junk so I made them. I figured at least he would eat them. The surprise was that on the following Monday, one of the teachers complimented me on the cupcakes and said the kids absolutely loved them.  Who says toddlers will only eat junk?  Hubby loved these too. Great recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I served it with a dollop of whipped topping enstead of the cream cheese frosting.
The problem that Lece described sounds like she used baking powder enstead of soda.

I have no idea where I went wrong in this recipe (i did drain the pineapple), but after 50 mins, the cake was very dark on the outside and like pudding on the inside. I turned the oven back on for about 20 mins, then shut it off and left the cake in over night. The flavour was pretty good, despite the strange consistency of it. I dont think i will try this one again though, the taste definately wasn't anything special...

I probably put an extra cup of grated carrot. This recipe makes a moist yet firm and very tasty cake.

I made this cake for my wife's birthday and she and our guests loved it. Also, it was quite easy to make just by hand, except the icing I did need to make in the food processor, but other people commented on how good the icing was as well!

Like another reviewer I found this ingredients seemed to make this recipe so incredibly moist, too moist. I am from the UK so wondering if this site converts to metric accurately. I had to bake it an extra 2 hours! And even after that it is nothing like a carrot cake. It tastes like Christmas pudding to me now. With all the amazing reviews I wonder what on earth I did wrong as I followed recipe and cooking instructions. The topping was also a bit too runny, was not sure if it was meant to harden but its a bit strange to say the least, won't be trying this again a lot of ingredients that do not match what everyone else says.

I made this recipe gluten free by substituting the 3 cups of regular flour for 1 cup of sweet potato flour (if your gluten free or paleo buy this on Amazon and you will appreciate it's addition to your kitchen!), 1 cup of potato starch and 1 cup of sorghum flour plus 1 teaspoon of xanthum gum.  I'm sure a mixture of rice flours would be fine as well.  Addtionally I left out the buttermilk and added another egg white.  I think this is probably a very forgiving recipe that will take a lot of tweaking before it turns out badly.  I used Earth Balance spread and Swerve sweetener with a couple of drops of cream cheese flavoring to replicate a dairy free, carb free frosting.

This cake was very good!  I did increase the carrots to 3 cups as suggested by another review.  The frosting was good, but I personally prefer traditional cream cheese frosting usually used on carrot cakes (cream cheese and confectioners' sugar).
