One of the best Lobster Tail recipes I've tried to date. I cut the bitters and ginger in half, just because I don't care for an excess of either one of them, but after eating it neither one was overwhelming. The next time I will add the full amount of both off them. Great job Kerri

Lovely lobster dish on a hot summer night. Just a very nice difference with the orange zest. Apparently, I left my skewers when we moved , so I had to use wooden skewers. They worked fine. I used 12 oz. tails so the cooking time was about 8 minutes longer over indirect heat. Didn't want to burn!!! Doubled the sauce so I had enough for basting and brushing. Thanks to KerriJ for this beautiful and simple recipe.

This was easy and delicious.  I didn't have aromatic bitters, so I eliminated it.  My husband thought it was the best prepared lobster he'd ever had!

I catch my own lobster (Florida Spiney)  I found this recipes and thought I would give it a try.  Always looking for something new.  I followed the recippe and it was OK.  My lobster shell burnt so, next time I will bring the fire to a lower setting.  I will try this again and will cut and split the top of the shell and the last ten minutes have this side up ( shell side up) and add the butter sauce to the lobster meat.

My boyfriend loved them (I'm a vegetarian, so I don't count). I made them almost exactly as written. The only difference was that I used orange-flavored bitters simply because the bottle was a lot smaller, 1/3 the price of regular aromatic bitters and because the recipe was for "orange scented lobster."

Um can I say YUM!!!  My husband loves lobster and he said that this lobster was the best lobster he has ever had!  I have to say that I completely agree with him.  This was delicious.  The orange scent added so much to the grilled lobster!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I will be making it again for sure!

Was very tasty, the orange zest really picked up the lobster tail. I made it without the bitters and only some of the chilli powder.

Definitely adding this to our rotation of dinners! I cooked these in the oven because of the temperatures outside and it turned out great! If you like a buttery lobster, serve with some melted butter and it's perfect!

Easy! Delicious! The only change I would make is to double the  amount of sauce and  serve it at the table.

Great!

This is truly an outstanding recipe!  Though I prefer using fresh ginger instead of the ground spice, I've made it both ways and it's still delicious. Ditto with the aromatic bitters. If you happen to have some on hand, the bitters gives a nice edge to the flavor but it's still wonderful without them. I have also had success in using my broiler instead of the grill (this winter has been far too cold for grilling where I live).  This is now my preferred method of preparing lobster tails and each time I serve them, I receive rave reviews from family and friends.  It's a "can't miss" recipe.

Instead of the typical gifts purchased while on vacation, my wonderful boyfriend brought me home lobster that he caught with his own hands while in the Keys!!  This was my first attempt at cooking lobster... but thanks to this recipe, another spectacular dinner was created by Mrs. Jones!  The marinade was super delicious even without the bitters. I also cooked them under the broiler for about 15 - 20 minutes only because I don't have a grill anymore :-(

The marinade was very tasty.  I'd never cooked lobster tail before this and didn't understand how the shell worked.  I should have watched a video!  Mine was not nearly as pretty as the options in the photos!

Made exactly as recipe minus bitters.  Excellent.  Cooked lobster 10 minutes on first side, about two minutes on second side.
