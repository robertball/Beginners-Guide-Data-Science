I have always used what I was told was the original recipe:
2 oz. Cognac
1 oz. simple syrup (or 2 tsp. superfine sugar) 
1 oz. lemon juice 
Brut Champagne or other dry sparkling wine

In aviation circles, the legend is that this drink was created by Raoul Lufbery in WW1 when he was a member of the Lafayette Escadrille and commanded the 94th Aero Squadron.  The name comes from the French 75mm artillery piece that had a kick like a mule.
When making this, use a good quality Cognac (VSOP) and a good Brut Champagne and hold on to your chair when you try to get up...

Like another reviewer had said; the French 75 is meant to be made with a Brut (dry champagne) and gin. This is not likely to be for the sweet cocktail drinker. If the drinker would like it to be sweet, I advise that you use a Sec.

I enjoyed it! Refreshing, reminiscent of lemonade, crisp, and definitely "hard-hitting!"

Enjoy, and let the good times roll!

Well, now that I'm awake from my nap I can review the recipe!----I think this recipe is completely dependant on the champagne you use.  Using a brut, it's definitely not sweet so be aware of that.  I liked it but don't  know that I'd make it again, just not a "knock your socks off" recipe (but a "knock you out" recipe!).   :)   A great way to use up a bottle of champagne leftover from mimosas at breakfast.

This drink is fantastic!!  It's perfect as is, or as a base for at least a dozen other drink ideas!  I've only made one of these so far, just by adding about a 1-1/2 tsp of Blackberry  Puree in the bottom of the glass first - utter summertime perfection!  ( I didn't get a picture because I couldn't stop drinking it! )  

Oh, it's also great to partially mix in bulk, then top either in a pitcher or individually with the champagne!  Perfect for a group Brunch!

Enjoy!

Close recipe, but something’s missing.  I had this drink at Harry’s Bar in Paris.  I am told this is where it was first invented in the ‘20s.  The true recipe according to Harry’s Bar is gin, champagne, ABSINTHE (only a dash for taste), sugar and lemon made in a shaker then poured over ice in a tall glass.  I have never seen nor heard of it made with absinthe any place else.  The absinthe does make a difference.  Does anyone else know this recipe?

This is "my drink" while going to nice restaurants. Finally decided to try making them at home...gin and tonics took a back seat! This one is a heavy hitter, but I love it!

This was light and refreshing.  Honestly, I think I'd just drink the bubbles straight, but it was something different.

I made the simple syrup out of raw sugar (1 cup water, 1 cup sugar). I made them as a signature cocktail to start a French dinner for a birthday celebration. Used Hendrick's gin, and bottled Real lemon juice. These turned out to be absolutely delicious, and everyone was impressed.

This drink is a good way to use up an open bottle of champagne.

Made according to original recipe with cognac instead of Gin-made a much smoother cocktail.  Have made it several times and will continue to make it as it has become my favorite cocktail.

I'm drinking one now....  i'm not a big champagne fan, but that said i'm enjoying this...  the gin gives it punch and the lemon gives it bite.... only wish i had the cherry at the bottom... i floated a lemon in it and poured the ice from the shaker into it...it's keeping it colder and tastes better..  also i'm using a white wine glass because a flute was too small for ice..

As written, I found the gin a bit overpowering, but then again, I've never been a huge fan of the flavor of gin.  Cutting the amount of gin by about half made the drink perfect for me.
