Easy recipe.  Used butter instead of olive oil, b/c the recipe said butter.  Also, used sherry because I didn't have any marsala.  Otherwise made as described.  I didn't like the nutmeg taste at all and would not use again.  Overall, my husband and I agreed that this was like a cross between chicken french and cordon bleu, but not as quite good as either of those.  Still, worth a try.
