Unlike the other person that rated these, I think these where great, remember they are supposed to be shared with your buddies, not your mom and dad, and for sure not the grandparents or the kids!  These were awsome!  I have made this a few times now and I save the sauce to use for the next batch!  If there is any left that is.

thought I would try these and share at a party. I doubled the recipe but put in only 10 oz of jack but still way to strong! definitely not going to make again,
