*****Note: The recipe was supposed to say 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I have asked Allrecipes to revise the recipe. Also, I use reduced fat and sodium soup when I make this up; adjust salt to suit your own personal taste. Happy Cooking! RadiatingMom/Breeze

There's a lot of green bean casserole recipes out there, but this one is head and shoulders above the others. I think it's the addition of sour cream and the buttery cracker crust (not those tired old french fried onions) that give it a little extra zip and personality. I have to admit that I did sprinkle a little shredded cheese on top before adding the cracker crust, and as a cheese addict I think it made this casserole even better. This one's going in my recipe box!

This is a great change from the traditional Green Bean Casserole.  I used a whole can of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup of sour cream instead.  And I also added some chopped pecans to the topping.  I fixed this for Thanksgiving and loved it.

I have always liked green bean casseroles, but the salt and the fat are overwhelming to me.  I used low fat, low salt cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup sour cream and frozen french style green beans.  I ended up with the freshest tasting casserole ever!  This paired well with Apple Stuffed Chicken Breasts and carrots.

I made this with our Christmas dinner and I will never go back to my old way of making green bean casserole.  Take the advise of other reviewers and use less sour cream.  ***ONLY USE HALF A CUP OF SOUR CREAM, even the author has posted that the recipe is printed wrong.  I used canned green beans and I mixed the green beans and sauce together the night before and put it in the fridge overnight.  When it was time to bake it I put the crackers on it and popped it into the oven. Delicious and easy, what more could you ask for???

This is way better with frozen green beans. To jazz it up a bit, I  
 sauteed fresh sliced mushrooms in butter with shallot, added 1 tsp. soy sauce and 1/2 tsp. dried tarragon. Used only 1/4 cup sour cream. Yep... changed the recipe quite a bit, and it sure was good!

I'm learning that cooking is not an exact science...  Oh sure, you can't really deviate on things like baking soda and stuff like that, but most recipes are pretty forgiving of some tweaking here and there.  I was so sure I had everything I needed to make this for dinner, only to come home and find I had no mushroom soup OR sour cream.  I used cream of broccoli and skipped the sour cream.  I topped with the buttery crackers as indicated in the recipe (I used Ritz), but added a sprinkle of some grated italian cheese I had leftover in the fridge.  What can I say?  It tasted great.  I'm sure the sour cream would have made it better, but this worked out fine.  I will try again with the ingredients specified, but it got me thinking - you could probably do a "broccoli casserole", with frozen broccoli, condensed broccoli soup, and the other ingredients here.  Maybe I'll try that...

One of my favorite recipes from this site! Always a winner and I make this for Thnksgvng. I do reduce the sour cream a bit & use the whole can of cr. of mushroom. Also add a can of corn to this. I LIKE canned Campbell's soups (they are comfort food to me) so I really, really enjoy this recipe. I can understand, though, if you don't like canned soups/sour cream combinations you probably wouldn't like this recipe. (: All to taste, and here's to comfort food!

I used fresh, steamed green beans as I had some that needed to be used. I used healthy choice soup, light sour cream & I am out of Ritz crackers so I used club crackers. I added a bit of onion powder to add flavor, used season-all for the salt & I did catch Breeze/RadiatingMom's review so I  cut the sour cream down to half a cup. I served this w/ leftover Molasses Butter Pork Chops (home recipe) & Smushed Apples & Sweet Potatoes (from allrecipes). I liked this better than the traditional green bean casserole & so did hubby...thanks Breeze, it was delicious!

WOW ... so easy and so perfectly wonderful for that special dinner.  I didn't make this one, I had my husband make it.  He didn't change a thing in the recipe.  This proved what an easy to make dish this one is because he doesn't make casseroles.  He loved it as much as I did, and so did all the folks around the table at Thanksgiving dinner.  We didn't have to worry about leftovers .. there were NONE !

I love the cracker topping, it is so buttery and delicious.  Usually when I make this I use fresh green beans, and just cut them to size and boil them for 4-5 minutes before using them in the casserole.  Very tasty and enjoyed by all.

Yesterday (Thanksgiving 2008), my family & guests loved this recipe. As-is, it  deserves 5 stars, Based on personal preference, I suggest the following: (A) Add 4 T diced onion when blending essential ingredients, & (B) Depending on the size of your baking dish, you may need to double the amount of butter & crackers (I used a large but shallow Corning dish).

I made this to go with our Christmas ham on the spur of the moment tonight.  I used the french fried onions instead of crackers & butter.  I also didn't have sour cream, but I did have some french onion dip and it turned out really, really good...in spite of the fact I forgot the  salt and pepper.  Definitely will make this again!

My family took one taste and left it on their plate.  Tasted like sour cream.  Try 1/2 the sour cream and all of the mushroom soup and nix on the crackers/butter.

This was really simple and easy to make, and I had high hopes for the cracker topping, but the dish as a whole was really just bland... and I think it needed more spices of some sort for flavor.

This was great!  Our new green bean casserole for the holidays.  I did follow the others advice and use 1/2 of the amount sour cream.  I did made extra topping too because it is so yummy.  For those that hate onions as much as I do, this is perfect!

You really need the 3 cans of beans. The French cut style are more compact than the whole cut ones. To those who had a runniness problem I squeezed the excess water out of the beans in addition to simply draining them. I think I actually like them better than the whole cut green beans. I wanted to do something a little dressier with the GB casserole this holiday and I love sour cream so I figured that (1/2 cup) would be good. I used only 2 cans of beans and a whole can of mushroom soup since I hate using partial canned goods in recipes. I always end up wasting the unused portions. I used a tsp. of soy sauce because the traditional recipe uses it according to the Campbell’s site and I like soy sauce. I know the cracker topping is the highlight of this recipe but I had the FF onions (and no crackers) and I like them, so I used them. The sour cream and French green beans made this for me though. The casserole was eaten and was better this way but (personal opinion) I’m still lukewarm on whether this requisite holiday dish is as great as its reputation. I’ll make it again for regular fare but may try something snazzier next Thanksgiving.

I've only made this recipe when I'm cooking for a lot of people. I've found that you can use 5-6 cans of the French cut green beans and keep all of the other ingredients the same; it tastes great and makes it less runny.

This was great. Quick and simple. I did make a slight change, though. I used coarsely processed slightly old bread cut with some asiago cheese for the topping and like a previous reviewer suggested I added about a half a can of sweet corn.

I never got any of these, so I can't testify personally.  The reason I never got any was because the teenager table devoured them before they got around to me.  I served for Thanksgiving dinner, and got comments like, "Delish!", "Yummy!", you get the idea.  Next year, I'll start them at the adult table, and make a lot more.  Thanks for posting a vegetable recipe teenagers will actually eat!

YUMMY! Brought this to Thanksgiving dinner and it was very very good. I only used half the amount of sour cream (as was suggested by everyone else) and it was the perfect amount. I used organic frozen green beans and I added a small amount of organic fried onions under the cracker crust only because my husband wanted them on it! It was really good. A step up from the normal boring Campbell's recipe.

This is such a fantastic way to use extra green beans from the garden! I used light sour cream to cut a few cals and put in chopped carrots and a few sliced muchrooms to give it some more veggies. I also added crushed walnuts to the crackers to give it a little more crunch. Overall great recipe; thanks for sharing :)

I was disappointed with this recipe. Too much sauce and I did not like the flavor of the crackers with the green beans.

This dish was much better than the classic green bean casserole.  I did change it a little because of my limited budget.  I used my home frozen green beans and used saltine crackers instead of the buttery round crackers.  My family really liked it and I will DEFINATELY make this again !!!

I LOVED this!  For so long I've wanted to like greenbean casseroles, but I can't get past those onions (what are those things, anyway?) and the taste of canned soup.  This recipe is so different from what i had tried to choke down in the past, that it will become a staple on my thanksgiving table.  I didn't read the review by the recipe submitter first and added the 1 cup sourcream.  I went back and crushed a few of the ritz crackers and stirred in so that it would soak up any 'sogginess' and it was perfect!  Not soggy at all.  I did add 1/2 packet of lipton's onion soup dry mix to the sourcream/soup mixture, and did shred a little fresh parm to mix with the ritz crumb topping.  I loved the flavor that these two ingredients added to this wonderful dish.  Subbed reduced fat sourcream and Healthy Request reduced fat/sodium cream soup and it still tasted just as rich and good; no sacrifice of flavor.  One might as well double the recipe and use the whole can of soup; this won't last long at your table!  Thanks so much Radiating Mom for this recipe.

This was so good that my husband said it was lighter and a very nice change from the classic version. I added a splash of balsamic vinegar to the sour cream/soup mixture and I took previous reviewers advice and used 1/2 cup sour cream. Thanks for a delicious change of pace Radiating Mom/Breeze!

I just realized I used the entire can of mushroom soup!  It turned out fine, regardless.  I made this for TG and I had 2 comments.  One loved it and the other wanted the FF onions back.  Personally, I thought the sour cream was a little over-powering.  In the future, I'll most likely stick to the old green bean casserole since I don't make it that often.

This is my go to recipe every year!  It's so yummy with the ritz cracker crust.  I do add some of the french fried onions to the cracker mixture as well and it's perfect.

Excellent recipe that I have repeated several times. I use light sour cream, and either fresh or frozen green beans. I bake some cheddar on top. Turns out great every time!

This is a pretty traditional dish.  There isn't much fuss and it tastes good.  I love that you can prepare it the night before, stick it in the fridge and then just add the topping right before you cook it.  Fairly inexpensive for a side dish, very easy and it's an old school classic.  I only used about half the sour cream, just to give it a flavor boost.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

Yummy!  I like this better than the recipe on the french-fried onion can, which I always found too "soupy".  I liked the flavor of the butter and the crackers.  This is a keeper.

I made this according to the directions listed in the recipie and it was WAY to overwhelmingly sour cream-ish. It wasn't until after I logged on to review that I saw an amended note below that states it is supposed to be 1/2 c. sour cream. I will try again next year as this was hard to judge off the way it is listed.  I usually don't have time to read reviews and go by star ratings so I guess I will have to do that from now on!!!

Like other reviews, there was something missing in this recipe. I think the black pepper amount was too much. I used some seasoned salt, garlic powder and celery salt. I agree, too much sour cream.  If I make again, I would reduce the sour cream.  The original green bean casserole is still better.

My family did not care for this at all. I think the sour cream was too much for it. Next time, I might stick with the 'regular' recipe and add some ritz with the french fried onions though. I liked that part.

I made this for Christmas & really like it.  Everyone liked this recipe better than traditional green bean casserole recipes.  The only alteration I made was that I doubled the cracker topping but we like it crunchy.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

Made this with Thanksgiving Dinner, should of made 2 dishes of it since there was none left over to go with left over turkey. Not much of a big fan for the traditional fried onion topping, thought the butter and cracker topping was like icing on the cake. Thanks Breeze!!

I typically despise green bean casserole and oh my, this was so amazing!! I used 3/4 cup of sour cream (Fat Free), and used a sprinkling of the crushed up Ritz crackers (Reduced Fat) in the casserole so it would soak some of it up. I also used 3/4 can of the soup (Low Sodium.) I am seriously in love with this! Making these changes really helps cut down on the fat and makes it that much more nutritious!! I also sprinkled some Parmesan cheese since we are cheese lovers. Love it and will make it often!!

This is a really good and simple recipe. Great way to get both my kids to eat their green beans. They usually don't like them at all. I love that this doesn't require the french fried onions since I can never remember to buy them! I only used 1 can of green beans and a 1/3 cup of sour cream and a 1/2 can of soup. Fabulous! Definitely a keeper in my book!

Since coming to America two months ago I am trying some of the things that we never had back home.  There are so many things that I have never seen, theres so much in your stores.  This did not taste fresh.  It tasted more like canned which we do have back home.  We prefer fresh vegetables and homemade stock.

I normally like the traditional green bean casserole, with fried onion rings but I wanted to try something different.  My family did not like this one at all, it was too salty ( and I like salt), you couldn't taste the green beans because the sour cream was overpowering.

I'm not sure why this is so popular.  I thought it was rather bland and boring.  I would have to add some more green beans, onions, and cheese to make this dish worth eating again.

We made this for both Thanksgiving and Christmas. This has fast become a family favorite. We make it just as the recipe states. My daughter hates the fried onions that we used to put on top of green bean casseroles; so this is a wonderful compromise. Even the picky grandchildren eat this with no complaints!

I use the canned green beans, too. For me, the fresh or frozen ones don't absorb the flavors of everything else, and the dish also ends up watery. I only used half of the sour cream....best dish ever! Remembering this from my childhood, and my mom and grandma made it with canned green beans.

I made this recipe for our family Christmas Eve dinner.  THe only think I did differently was that I added a whole can of cream of mushroom and used more crackers on top.  I used about 1 cup of crushed crackers and enough butter to moisten the crackers.  This was delicious.  Everyone loved it! Thanks for sharing.

This was the first green bean casserole I have ever made. It was excellent and so easy. Love the buttery crackers (I used Ritz) on top. I'm not so fond of the dried onions.

This recipe was just ok to me. My son who loves the classic green bean casserole wasn't that crazy about it. I did cut the recipe in half because I wanted to make for my son, but it was mush thicker than the original recipe that I usually use.

I originally made it with the canned green beans, I didn't think it tasted all that, but my family still liked it.  Then we had a lot of green beans that were about about to go bad so I decided to make this casserole again, 'cept with uncanned green beans.  And I loved it!  Yum yum.  The whole fam thought it was outstanding too.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving!  I used fresh, steamed green beans.  I also added some french fried onions in with the beans (because I couldn't be without them) but stuck with the ritz crackers on top.  Delicious! There was not one bite left over!

I've never been a huge fan of the ol' Green Bean Casserole, but this was surprisingly good. I don't like things too salty, so I used half unsalted beans, plus reduced salt soup. Next time, I want to try it with fresh or frozen beans to make it even more classy ;). This is the newest addition to my Thanksgiving menu.

I used my own recipe for the contents of the casserole, and am only reviewing the crushed Ritz cracker topping, which I tried for the first time after reading this recipe. I'm sorry to say, but I didn't really care for the topping very much. It didn't add any flavor to the casserole, and gave the casserole sort of a mealy texture that I didn't care for, but it did look nice coming out of the oven.

I was really pumped to make this recipe, because it was one of the few recipes that I found that didnt call for milk [I just ran out] and I had lots of sour cream that I wanted to use up. I made this in two smaller dishes, I put the cracker topping on one and cracker & cheese on the other, like another reviewer mentioned. I baked this for 25 minutes and it looked delish when I took it out of the oven. I scooped a bunch in a bowl and started eating it, but after a few bites I got sick of it. Its too sour creamy for my taste[I only used 1/2 cup]. Probably not something I will make again, but thanks for the recipe.

I have never had green bean casserole. I tried this recipe, and it was tasty, but I noticed it wasn't the classic recipe. It doesn't have the cream of mushroom soup the other recipes call for. I think I will try the classic recipes and compare them with this one. This recipe was delicious though, everyone seemed to like it. Not much left over. Isn't that what counts on Thanksgiving?

Growing up, we never had green bean caseroles and sweet potato pies, so in my 30's I have started introducing the tradition to my family and we have had such fun trying differnent recipes.  This one was great.  It comes out thicker than the traditional green bean caserole recipe - I am assuming because of the sour cream instead of milk.  I added corn and did mix in the french's canned onion rings, which sayed crispy! The sour cream gave it much more flavor than the milk.  Fun and easy to make - and good!  Used frozen green beans.

Made it at the last minute. Made as directed, other than some cheddar cheese I added in.  Everyone loved it, said much better than the "regular" version.  Now that I've seen the reviews I'll try it again with 1/2 cup sour cream instead.

This re4cipe converted my husband to a green bean casserole lover. I too was never much for green bean casserole until I tried this recipe. The crackers on top tend to burn on me, so I simply add a little cheese instead. My husband's family nominated me as the NEW green bean casserole maker for the holidays. They all love this recipe.

This is a very good green bean casserole recipe. I added fresh diced onion to mine and crumbled bacon and i just put the frenches onions on top and it was fantastic. I usually use fresh green beans which would make this tast a whole lot better but it was still great with canned. Just remember that when using canned, the beans still put out thier own juices so....make sure that you strain them really good.

I made this with a package of frozen green beans, Healthy Request Soup, and 1/2 cup light sour cream.  I added a handful of cheddar cheese right under the cracker topping.  It was good, and I enjoyed it much more than the usual green bean casserole.

I have been using this recipe for years and it's wonderful. At first people think it's weird that you use sour cream instead of milk. It's much more creamy this way and gives it a nice difference. I have never had any complaints on this recipe, even from people that don't like sour cream!

I really didn't like this. I looooove sour cream, but I think mixed in with cream of mushroom soup was just not for me. I also thought there weren't enough green beans and/or too much sour cream-soup mixture.

It was good. Some things to watch out for
are:1)try without adding salt then increase as desired(soup contains 900mg sodium) 2)sour cream was alright,my husband said it was a bit much,try from 1/2 cup and increase as desired 3)1/2 mushroom soup can seemed a bit much,maybe. 4)more topping was desired,one cup didn't see like a whole lot. Overall, good recipe. Remember,you can always add more, once it's mixed you can't take it out.

I thought this was a OK dish. It seemed like it had too much sour cream for the amount of green beans.

was excited to try this 'classy' recipe for thanksgiving meal.  It was anything but. Not a total disaster but nothing special, made as published. Doubt I would ever make it again.

As far as green bean casseroles go, this is the best I have ever tasted. I doubled this recipe and used a 13 x 9 for 45 minutes. This was delicious!!!!!

This recipe is the absolute BEST!  I have taken it to potlucks for a few years now and always have a handful of people asking for the recipe.  Only thing I do differently is I add shredded cheddar cheese across the top and then slivered almonds on top of that.  Even more rich (fattening) and delicious!!! (And even my 9yo son loves it -- it's THAT good.)

Fabulous! I substituted 9-grain Wheat Thins for the 'buttery crackers' and it was a huge hit! I will use this recipe time and time again! Thanks :)

This was a nice twist on the original. My family really liked the addition of the sour cream. It gave it just a little more zing to the dish. Will use this recipe from now on.

EASY EASY EASY and very tasty! Make sure that you bake this the entire time listed to firm up. This is a slight, but good, variation on the old standby green bean casserole recipe. The sour cream really makes the difference!

This is a really good side dish. I saw one posters review that it wasn't what they were expecting; exactly what were they expecting? It's a green bean casserole - hello!? Don't make this if you aren't expecting the taste of a green bean casserole made with mushroom soup and sour cream and topped with crackers. The kids hate onion anything so this is much better than the fried onion topping. I think the cracker topping is my favorite, although the smoothness of the sour cream is good also. Thanks for submitting.

This is one awesome recipe! I love this. This is definitely not for the folks that like the fried onions on top, this is more refined. I have only made this once and have already been asked for the recipe! This recipe is perfect as written, no modifications needed. This is going to replace our tired, worn out mushroom soup and fried onion recipe. Thank you.

I use the whole can of Campbell's cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 c. of sour cream(maybe a little more). I also add a little bit of onion powder and a dash of garlic powder to the mixture before I mix it up and after I add the salt and pepper. It gives it a little bit of something extra and my whole family raves about it. I even thought about adding a little bit of paprika to it for some Smokey flavor, so I will let you know how it turns out out after I do that. But, the onion powder and garlic powder are a great addition. You just don't need to add very much. Garlic powder is VERY strong, so when I say a dash, I mean a dash!! And I only add just a little bit more of the onion powder than the garlic. You can always add, but you can never take away!! Hope this helps you make the best green bean casserole.

I've made this recipe many times.  It's so easy and delicious!  The family loves it and asks for it every time we have a special dinner.  The onion lovers don't miss the onions at all!

I served it yesterday and as written it was a good amount for 4 adults and an 8 year old boy (although if I'd made more it would have been gone as well).  If you do have leftovers, it heats up well.

 14 crushed Ritz crackers and 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) melted butter make a perfect topping.  I put the crackers in a plastic bag and press them in my hands until crushed, then mix them very well in the butter using a fork.

I use only 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 heaping teaspoon pepper.  The Ritz are salty and 1/2 tsp pepper can be a little more than needed.

I've tried a few variations of green beans and like the canned French cut beans the best in this recipe.   

Thank you so much for this tasty, easy recipe!

This recipe is super easy and really good. I make this every Christmas and/or Thanksgiving. My brother, who does not generally care for green bean casserole, really likes this! I like the crackers on top versus the usual fried onions.

This was not good at all.  There was no "sauce" so to speak.  It was just green beans with clumps of white gook.  No one liked it or finished their serving of it at our Thanksgiving dinner.

I made this recipe with fresh green beans that I blanched for 4 minutes.  I used a whole 10.5 oz can of mushroom soup, 1/2 c sour cream, and 3 oz Super Sharp white cheddar cheese.  For the topping I used the traditioanl french fried onions.  I put the whole thing together the day before, with the exception of the onion topping.  It was amazing, flavorful and - devoured.  I will definitely make it this way again.

Thanks for this recipe.  I was "volunteered" to make the green bean casserole for Christmas and I absolutely loath the french onion versions.  This is bound to be a big hit and it is extremely easy to make, and I might even enjoy it for once.  P.s. thanks for the note about the sour cream.  I would have gone wrong else.

I usually make green bean casserole with fried onions, but since you can't buy them here, the crackers were excellent. And I love the name!

i thought this was great, although the rest of my family didnt.  there wasnt so much cream of mushroom taste in it like other green bean casserole recipes, and the topping was a nice change from the fried onions.  i did double the topping and it just covered the casserole.  excellent!  thank you for the recipe!

I like the green bean part with (1/2 cup!) of sour cream, but I think I like the traditional fried onion topping instead...

I think I flubbed something because the consistency was a bit goopy, but the taste was incredible. I served it for a picky crowd yesterday for Christmas '06, and will experiment with it so that I can serve it all the time instead of the traditional green bean casserole. Thanks!

This was very good. I took the advice of some of the other reviews and added both balsamic and horsradish sauce to give it a little kick and it did! I also doubled the cracker on top, I love the extra crunch. This is a keeper for t-giving menu!

This was pretty good...and terribly easy (have another green bean recipe that I use that is awesome but has so many steps I dread preparing!) Used fresh green beans (parboil for about 3 mins, then blanch). Will make again!!

I thought this was great.  I did change it up a little though.  I used fresh green beans (pre-cooked), less sour cream, added a small clove of garlic and a layer of cheddar cheese. I also used Ritz dinosaur crackers just for fun and extra toddler appeal!  It came out great.

We did not care for this.  After cutting back on the sour cream and using 99% fat free soup we thought it was a little bland.  Everyone should try whatever recipe appeals to them since this is just our personal preference.  Thanks for the post.

Cut back on the sour cream and did not need to add any of the salt. The soup alone has plenty of to go around. Other than having to tweak a bit, I thought this was a nice change from the usual GB casserole. Thanks RadiatingMom!

I just tried this recipe tonight with my two kids. My husband is out of town and does not like most of the ingredients that this one calls for. So I figured it owuld be a good time to try it. We liked it somewhat. I omitted some of the sourcream it called for and the sourcream still over powered alot of the taste. That is why I gave it 3 stars. Even for my taste which I love sour cream did not care for that much of it. Also it made the bottom of the pan gooey and juicey. wasn't attractive at all. This is the first time I've cooked any of the recipes from this web site. I fixed this dish with some Fried Chicken and mashed potatoes and gravy. The Fried Chicken I am gonna do a review on too because it was awsome!!!!

First let me start with I am just learning to cook and there are times even the dog won't eat my dinner!  I made this for a church function so the "pressure" was on.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great!  It was a huge hit and several women ask me what the secret ingredient was...so I give it 5 stars.  Easy and tastes great!

I've made this multiple times now - even when it isn't a holiday! Everyone loves it and always compliments me for it. They like the different taste you get using the buttery round crackers versus the onion, and I rarely get to take home leftovers for later! Great recipe!

This is a delicious change from the original green bean casserole recipe.  So much better!  This will be a tradition for my family at Thanksgiving as well as all year long!  The sour cream is what makes it really tasty.  Thanks, RadiatingMom...loved it!

Absolutely delicious! Doubled the recipe and added cheddar cheese on top. This was a winner. As to the sour cream, this is what makes the recipe. Those that don't care for sour cream will not like this recipe. Those that do, will love it. A nice change from the ordinary.

I too was looking for an alternative green bean recipe/casserole that you make ahead of time, so I tried this recipe. Although a couple of my family said they liked it, I personally found the recipe too sharp with sour cream and not to my liking. I would not make this again.

This was a hit last night with all of us! Doubled the recipe and used reduced fat ingredients. The creaminess of this dish complimented the somewhat dry turkey. I had to pass out the recipe to guests. This is an updated, creamier green bean casserole to what has been our tired, routine recipe for years. I recommend this recipe as a new twist on an old favorite.

This recipe was not at all what I expected. It had too much sour cream and the flavor of the green beans was overpowered. also, the crackers were soggy in someplaces and crunchy in others. I'm going to keep looking for a green bean casserole recipe. Unless you love sour cream, this one is not thebest.

Mine turned out a bit salty (and I like salt). I think if  I make this again, I will either leave out the salt completely or reduce it.

Even better than the traditional version. I forgot to buy crackers but had some french fried onions, so I added about a cup of those to the bean/soup/sour cream mixture, then added a layer on top of the casserole during the last 5 minutes of baking. I also used light cream of mushroom soup and light sour cream--we couldn't tell the difference.

This was the best recipe for green beans. Even my 4 year old who wrinkles his nose at all things green ate this and asked for seconds!! The sour cream made it so smooth and creamy.
This is a favorite and I'm taking to Thanksgiving this year.

Now at first I was a bit hesitant, and I wanted to try a different side dish... this recipe was GREAT! Talk about the perfect ingredients to mix... sour cream DEFINITELY had a lot to do with it.  I will be making this dish again for the upcoming holidays (per the requet of my husband who loved it as well)!!!

This was a hit with everyone!  A nice change fron the usual green bean casserole.  The sour cream was a good flavor enhancer.  I used light s.c. and lowfat cream of mushroom soup and it was great.

I found this dish to be very mushy from the canned green beans. The color was also drab and unattractive. I won't make this again.

I made this as a Christmas dinner side dish.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I absolutely LOVED this and will definitely make this again soon!

Easy and delicious!  A great spin on an old favorite (and even my 18-month-old loved it)!

I served this at Thanksgiving and got nothing less than rave reviews. It's a great alternative just a bit more fattening.

I got quite a few compliments on this recipe, and I didn't change a thing.  One guy even told me that it was even better than the one that he had, which he thought was "the best."

This didn't taste bad and it was easy to make.  I was looking to make something different than the typical green bean casserole with the french fried onions.  In comparison, I found that the original tastes better than this.

Took this one to Thanksgiving...and even though many members of my family only eat extremely "healthy", there was not a single morsel of this left!  Everyone loved it!

This is a great recipe. I made this casserole for Thanksgiving and everybody thought it was delicious. Before I added the crushed crackers I sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese over the green beans.

This was so easy and delicious too. I ended up adding half a can of the fried onions to the casserole and topping it with the cracker/butter topping. I also used one extra can of green beans(total of 4) like another person had suggested earlier. Thanks for a yummy recipe.

I signed up just to rate this recipe. We did a test run to check this out before Thanksgiving. We doubled this and put in a pyrex and it was out of this world! We are taking this to a potluck Thanksgiving dinner. We can't wait to share this with others! This is AWESOME!

I used frozen green beans also added a dash of all purpose seasoning and cooked this in the crock-pot for 4 hours on low then added crackers on top in the serving dish and broiled for a few minutes.  Boy was this dish a hit.  One guest suggested that his partner toss out their green bean recipe and replace it with this one! YUMMY!

I would use the dried onions on top instead of the Ritz crackers.  I also added an extra can of green beans.  The flavors of tis recipe are great though!
