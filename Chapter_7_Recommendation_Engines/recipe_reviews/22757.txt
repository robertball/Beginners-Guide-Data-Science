I guess I don't have the magical touch...but my cookies sure did not turn out.  I figured Chocolate "Clouds" meant light and fluffy, but my cookies were as hard as peanut brittle.  I will not be trying this recipe again!

People could not believe that I could possibly bake such incredible cookies.  I had three people ask for the recipe and one tell me I should quit my job and go into business selling these!

I am trying to eat healthier but I absolutely LOVE chocolate, so this recipe was a perfect fit. I love the fact that it doesn't take hours to bake...they turned out perfect too!! I omitted the chocolate chips; the cookies taste just like hot chocolate to me.

Oh my gosh, this was horrible.  I baked the cookies at 300 degrees for only 30 minutes, and they came out of my oven BURNT TO A CRISP.  I had to throw away all of these cookies, and was upset about wasting my time (and CHOCOLATE!).

Next time I'm making "regular" meringue cookies (vanilla or almond flavor).  I'm not sure it's the recipe's fault, but chocolate meringue isn't something I'm going to make again.

These turned out really well for me. I made them but omitted the chips and I added a big spoonful (probably about a tablespoon) of instant vanilla-flavoured coffee for mocha meringes. I made them larger (I only got 16) and baked for an extra 15 minutes or so. Still a tiny nidus of moisture in the centre, but the rest of the meringue is beautiful, so it's probably my fault for getting impatient to eat them...

Awesome cookies!  I will definitely make these again anytime I have leftover egg whites.

Very good!  These are so easy to make.  A bit sweet.  Keep in mind these are meringues, and do not have the texture of traditional cookies.  This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe was good, I think I was looking for a different texture like someone else said, but I liked the way they came out. Next time I will use maybe 1 to 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips.

I too skipped the chips, added the instant coffee and made large 2 1/2" diameter cookies.  Baked for 1 hour 10 minutes.  I live in the south and have had issues with meringues before, these worked well on this rainy day.  They do smell incredible and I fully understand the tempatation to pull them out early.  Sneak one if you must, but resist the early pull.  Bon Apetite!!

These are wonderful cookies.  I began making them last Christmas and everyone loved them.  They turned out light and airy and then they just melt in your mouth.  Yum! 

I used parchment paper on the baking sheet and they just slide right off!
