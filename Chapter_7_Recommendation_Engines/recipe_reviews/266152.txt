With all of the delicious and healthy ingredients, I thought this would be amazing, but the recipe wasn't specific enough for me to make it come out right. Two pounds of eggplant when sliced in about 1/2" slices (the recipe didn't specify thickness) filled 3 cookie sheets which was a whole lot more than I needed to serve 4. The paste of flat leaf parsley, garlic, walnuts and olive oil needed to be put in a food processor to make it spreadable. I'll make it again using what I've learned and will add more salt.

Absolutely delicious...I didn't have enough walnuts so added some chopped pecans. This was awesome. Thanks!
