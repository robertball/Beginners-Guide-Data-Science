YUMMY! Simple too. I made tart sized pies for company and they were dazzled. I also used my small kitchen butane torch cuz I don't have a real man torch :) Worked out beautifully. Just be ready to blow out the flames on those yummy marshmallows cuz just like the campfire, they want to burn. My hubby says that is what makes marshmallows so tasty and gooey!!!!

Very tasty.  I recommend putting the marshmallows on the pie and freezing until very firm.  When you're ready to serve it, toast with your kitchen torch and serve immediately rather than returning to the freezer.  The contrast between the warm and gooey marshmallows and the cold ice cream is incredible.

This was just OK.  The graham crust stuck to the pie tin, so getting the pie out was difficult.  The chocolate ice cream doesn't really replicate the richness of a chocolate bar, so you have to really like chocolate ice cream to enjoy, and it's not my favorite.  The miniature marshmallows really weren't gooey like in a S'more, despite the blow torching.  All in all, not bad, but not something I will make again.

This was a yummy ice cream pie that we enjoyed while staying at a beach house with our adult children. Everyone raved about the combinations of flavors that imitated a s’more. For convenience, I bought a graham cracker crust already prepared and I added mini chocolate chips to the softened ice cream before putting it in the crust.  Some eaters got creative and added chocolate syrup drizzle over their piece.  This will be a family favorite!

I added Saunders hot fudge to the top of each person's slice right before serving. I like it better than a regular s'more. Great for a summer dessert.

This is a good ice cream dessert for holiday events. It is  very easy but tastes good. I froze it hard then put the marshmallows on top and broiled it for a minute.

Use your favorite dessert.  Used Publix Mint Moose Tracks., :). Some folks didn't seem to understand 3 things were used.  Crust  (store bought), Ice Cream and Marshmallows.  One note be careful when pressing in the softened ice cream the crust may break if you press hard.

Turned out delicious! Will definitely make again. Didn't have  a blow torch so after I put the icecream in the pie, I put the marshmallows on top, and after an hour or two back in the freezer,  I just put the pie in the oven for about 30 seconds under the broiler and it turned out perfect. Made it about 2 days before it was consumed and just kept it in the freezer. It was a hit! Very easy to make and prepare ahead of time. I also cheated and used the pre-made graham cracker crust made by Keebler.

Made this for Father's Day and it was a big hit. Especially here in Central California where temperature gets over 100 degrees.

Haven't tried it but I make a similar peanut butter banana with marshmallows. Might want to add a disclaimer on the blowtorch since this site is 13+
