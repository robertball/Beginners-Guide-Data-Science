I made this recipes after receiving it on my daily recipe email, it sounded too good to pass up.  I am not sure what 2 1/2 cups of heavy cream was for, when I used less than 1 c.  Also, tenderloin is to pricey to ever serve medium well.  I pulled from the over after 30mns and it was already medium well, so if you make this recipe, make sure to check the temp. after 20mns.  This recipe is a good concept, I will make many modifications next time I try it. (Can you tell I'm still upset after over-cooking the tenderloin?!)

I thought this recipe looked good and relatively easy to try for a beginner like myself.  Apparently the recipe calls for way too much cream.  Also, the filet heats up the dough so much that the dough breaks.  The cooking time is way too long for such a nice cut of meat.  It ended up too dry, and that was when I had already decreased the time by 10 minutes.

If you like your filet burned, this is your recipe.
Why 2 1/2 cups of cream ?

With some changes, this turned out great!  I cut back a little on the cream, cut the meat up and browned it in a pan, and threw the meat and sauce into a slow cooker for 4 hours or so until the meat was tender.  Then I just placed the mixture on top of some store bought flaky biscuits.  Tasted wonderful!

If you line the bottom of the pastry with bread (brown is best) it stops the pastry from being as soggy!

This was a huge hit for Christmas Dinner - with my family and guests. Only issues were I was not certain what consistency the sauce should be and the dogh got a little messy, but for this I blame myself not the receipe. In the end it was wonderful.

I didn't like the cream sauce and the puff pastry got soggy. So to remedy it, I cooked the pastry shells and meat separately. I put the cooked meat into the cooked shell and layered it with goat cheese (boursin works well too) and popped it back in the oven for 5 minutes so the cheese would warm up. My husband and I like it this way.

I made this one with 2 cups of cream instead of 1 1/2 and I even threw in some fresh mushrooms. My daughter even ate it! The cooking time should be lessened if you want a steak that is more pink in the center though.

It's a great recipe that is fairly easy to follow. The only thing that can be tricky, is folding the filo dough. Mine didn't look "pretty," but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it next time. In the end they still looked impressive and did taste great. If you have the time, I say give this a try.

This recipe gets three stars because I didn't follow the direction so I'll take part of the blame. Because of the previous review (thank you very much) I didn't use expensive tenderloin instead I use high quality sirloin. 2 1/2 cups of cream????I reduced that to 2/3 cup and still had a lot left over. Dividing the pastry in 3 8x8 inch squares made it really easy to tear and when you add the liquid and the hot meat that is what happened. The juice in the bottom of the pan resulted in a soggy bottom crust that wasn't very appealing. At 30 minutes the pastry was pale at 40 minutes the pastry was nice and brown but the meat was over cooked. The flavor was alright but I wish I'd broiled the steak and used that pastry to make dessert. I probably will not make this again and I'm really glad I didn't buy tenderloin.

I've made Beef Wellington before, so I tried this one with alot of caution.   2.5 cups of cream is much too much. The pastry took too long to cook at that temp.  Recommend, upping the temp to about 425 and only cooking pastry for about 20 mins. You definately need a meat thermometer with this recipe, unless you like messing up beef at $16 per lb

1 sheet of puff pastry is not enough first of all. And way too much cream. It also never thickened ever, why? no flour or cornstarch. Once I started spooning the cream mixture over the beef forget it.

Change the beef to chicken and add ham and it is really good. Like cordon blue in puff pastry.

I made this recipe last night and am giving it 3 stars more for the fact I had to make some minor adjustments due to my local store not having certain things and I tweaked it based off others comments. Firstly we had fresh ribeyes so I used this for my meat. My local store didn’t have puff pastry so I used croissants. For the sauce I used one small I believe pint of half and half, a can of cream of mushroom soup and then sautéed celery and onions till browned and added that to the meat. The soup gave it the extra thicker consistency. I did sear the meat for 2 minutes on each side and then let them rest and then patted them so they wouldn’t excess moisture the croissants. I did heat my sheet pans in the oven with non stick cook spray so the would not stick to the pans. Once wrapped with croissant (took half of one roll for each steak) I put it on the pan and then brushed melted butter on the tops. I did end up cooking this at 425 for 20 minutes and let rest. Was a great medium rare steak and tasted amazing.

I think 40 minutes is way too long to cook this.  The sauce was way to thick and fatty tasting.  I think if you sautéed the onions and garlic place them ontop of the steak inside the puff pastry would be fine.  Then perhaps make a gravy  would make the dish lighter.
