Made as written and this turned out really good. It was super fresh tasting. I may have gotten a mild pepper but I think it could have used a little more heat to counteract the sweet from the carrots and ketchup. I ended up giving it a few dashes of Valentina's hot sauce. This recipe would be perfect for those hot summer days.
