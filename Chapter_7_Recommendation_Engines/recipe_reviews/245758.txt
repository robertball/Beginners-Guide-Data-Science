Pretty easy and pretty tasty. I think I may have drained off too much water as a bit of a struggle getting whole wheat bread crumbs to coat all 4 sides really well but it still came out well.

In addition to using whole wheat bread crumbs I also used I can't believe it's not butter vs real butter to reduce calories and weight watchers points and it still had excellent flavor.

I'm not a huge buffalo sauce fan but fam and I are doing strictly vegetarian for a week and they love buffalo wings so thought I'd give it a try. Glad I did as am pleasantly surprised at how much I like it!
