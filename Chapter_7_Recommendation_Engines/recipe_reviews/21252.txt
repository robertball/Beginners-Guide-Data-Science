This mojito recipe was so-so, but the worst thing you can do is trying to change it to simpilfy it. Basically to make it more like the one at your favorite restaurant is to really muddle (with a back of a spoon, or better a wooden muddler) at least 10 sprigs of mint per drink as well as 3 wedges of lime, 3 tbl. of simple sugar (a 2-1 mixture of sugar and water boiled and cooled-- it's easy and worth it!) Muddle well then add crushed ice to top fill with white rum (about 3 0z) but leave room to add a splash of soda water. Shake or stir and serve! Please do Not use sprite, it will not be the same. But using regular sugar is fine, just cut the amount in half.

This is now my Mojito. You can have some too. You're welcome. Useful tip--because there should be one--this tastes best when served very cold. Lukewarm Mojito bad. Ice cold Mojito good.

I had one of these at a restaurant last summer that is supposed to be famous for their mojitos and LOVED it!  They must be famous because they do something completely different, because I followed this recipe exactly and it tasted nothing like the refreshing drink I had experienced.  These were very boring.  After working a bit on doctoring them up (more sugar, more mint) we gave up and made some margs.

This recipe is good in that it is simple.  As a bartender I am hyper-critical and I see lots of people over do it on the ingredients. Personally, I use 6 mint leaves to muddle.  I think it's the minty flavor that makes this drink so unique and refreshing.  If you're getting a bitter flavor, you're mashing the rind of the lime too much.  You want to release the juices, but not the oil from the rind.  That's where the bitterness comes from. This recipe has the perfect amount of lime if you're juicing it right:)

Muddling is the key to a good Mojito.  You should put about 3 or 4 sprigs of mint and 3 lime wedges.  You really have to put some muscle behind it because you're trying to extract as many of the natural oils from the lime as possible.  I have never had good luck with sugar in these. A simple syrup (1 part sugar, 2 parts water) is the best way to go.  Your final drink should be composed of 1/3 rum, 1/3 simple syrup and 1/3 club soda.  Using a smaller glass is the key.

it works...i should have bruised the mint as recommended instread of slicing it..b/c then it floats through the ice to the top and makes it difficult to drink.. also good to substitute rum with sake

Do not use confectioners' sugar. Didn't dissolve well and left a nasty cornstarch taste in the drink. Will try this one again using simple syrup (and more sugar than the recipe calls for). Will probably also strain most of the mint out - not sure if I liked drinking a salad! but love the fresh mint and lime.

Good start...needs more sugar and you need to muddle the mint with the sugar (I also add a bit of lime juice to make muddling easier).   I use two sprigs of fresh mint (which equaled about 10 mint leaves).  I used about 1 teaspoon confectioner's sugar when muddling and then added 1 packet of splenda to help sweeten it more to my taste.  Without the additions it tasted mostly like soda water.

I have had the best results by making a mint simple syrup, and using the following recipe: 1 oz mint syrup, 1 oz fresh lime juice, 2 oz rum, fill a highball with ice and top with soda. Muddle a few sprigs of mint before adding the ice--more for presentation--and garnish with a big sprig of mint.

this is a great recipe.... i replaced the confectioners sugar with simple syrup.  It is easy to make and it makes this drink just sweet enough.... 1 cup of sugar and one cup of water... medium heat until sugar is completely dissolved.  allow to cool before using.

Disappointing.  This sounded easier to make than my usual way. However,  I will go back to making it with the simple syrup.  I added quite a bit more confectioners sugar and it still was not sweet enough.

I did not like this recipe. I prefer to use 5-6 mint leaves, two wedges of lime and regular sugar (simple syrup is also good), muddle until flavors are blended, add ice, rum, and I like to use sparkling water than soda, not as much salt. Great hot weather drink!

This is good, but is WAY better using Simple Syrup instead of Confectioner's sugar. 2 cups of granular sugar to 1 cup of water, bring to a boil for 2-3 minutes and then remove from heat and let cool. I double the batch! Keep's in the fridge forever...never spoils. Replace the Confectioners with this syrup...about 2 tbls. or to taste.

Try a better option and easier. Get some cocktails 123 Mojito mixer (key lime concentrate). Mix a inch into a shaker and muddle a few fresh mint leaves. Pour 2 shots Captain Morgan spice rum and club soda and shake. Strain into a highball glass half full of ice. My favorite! My friends now like Mojito's 5 star

Best thing is to use fresh limes, organic or scrubbed to remove pesticides.

How I do: ½ lime cubed, 1 spoonfull cane sugar, 4 mintleaves crushed in an glass with a suitable wooden stick. Add 4 cl. rum and mineral water.

A few drops of Agoustura is helpfull if using light rum.

Try a variation and add some wine grapes before crushing...

You can't beat a mojito for a summertime patio drink - it's crisp, light, and refreshing.    I like mine with a whole lime and a 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar or splenda.  Splenda tastes just as good and dissolves more easily than sugar.  Also try a dash or two of bitters if you wish.

I suspect that as with any recipe there is some technique that really makes it work. Trying to dissolve sugar in cold water is often difficult , and I would recommend  simple syrup , or make your own sugar water  to sweeten it , honey would also make a nice replacement adding another interesting flavor, although maybe not traditional.  Another tip I learned which some feel is key is to place the mint on the crushed ice and bruise it against the sharp ice crystals to really release the flavor.

I like this recipe.  It wasn't too sweet or too minty, just right!

Needs WAAAAAAYYY more sugar than called for (like 5 times more!!) and needs less lime.  Mojitos are my fave summer drink, but this was not good.

Not great.  I've had better.  I had to adjust the sugar because it seemed bitter.  I wasn't impressed.

I enjoyed this but everyone else pretty much didn't. I got everyone's leftovers when they couldn't stomach it anymore. Too sour. But I would make it again for me.

This is a refreshing drink in the summer. I thought it was a little bitter though, so next time I'll ease off the lime.

Not bad. We needed to add more limejuice, but maybe our limes were just lame.
Yum!

I used simple syrup & muddled the syrup, lime juice & mint (used alot more than called for in recipe) together. This was OK but I still need to tinker w/ it some. Thanks for letting me try it!

This was light and refreshing,although next time I might use some simple syrup to sweeten it up so the suger doesn't go the bottom. I also left out the rum so the whole family could enjoy. Only setback is the mint in your teeth.

Tried your recipe for the mojito..first tried it in its native cuba.  Its great...just missing one thing though..you need to add a shot of bitters if you are going to have a true mojito.(good for hangovers too!!)

It was yummy. I have never muddled mint leaves before, I wasn't sure how long and what they look like and do you eat them as you drink?  Otherwise, very easy recipe and yummy.

Good base (loved the lime/soda/rum ratio) but it needs more mint and more sugar.  Otherwise the club soda overwhelms the drink.

So awesome!!!! I skip the sugar and add 1/2 shot of mango puree mix I got at the liquor store. Be sure to bruise the mint leaves in the lime juice well. Just got back from a Cruise. This is the drink! Also did not use club soda used Gingerale.
