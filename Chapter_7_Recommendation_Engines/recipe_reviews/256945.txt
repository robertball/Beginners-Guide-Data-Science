as per the recipe it seemed bland. I like flavor. I added caramelized onion & a little garlic. my boyfriend needs more veggies so I threw in yellow bell pepper. I used a tablespoon of worestershire and to tendorize the meat I threw in some beer in the meat. It was missing some heat. instead of black pepper I added Asian chili paste. about a tablespoon it tasted so good I thinned some of that up to make a very thick gravy. With the extras it seemed perfect.  I gave it 3 stars for the original recipe being bland. that's just me. other people don't like all that. I did not have American cheese but I put a healthy amount of shredded cheddar. It's definitely a keeper and easy to augment to personal taste. To me cooking should be an experience that leaves your tastebuds in an orgasmic state.

This recipe also works well with thinly sliced leftover roast beef/pot roast. Next time I will stir the cheese in so everything sticks. Growing up in Jersey, we let the cheese smother the meat. Great idea. This works!

I can't say enough about this recipe, it was sooooo good!  I added in some caramelized onions and mushrooms. This tasted just like a Philly Cheesesteak!

The Worcestershire needs doubled if not tripled but other than that, perfect as written! It also wouldn't hurt to add your onions in with the beef to soften them but that is a matter of personal preference and up to you.
