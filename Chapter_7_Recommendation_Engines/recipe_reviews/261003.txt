I enjoyed the smoothie much more than I expected I would.  I omitted the coconut and only used about half of the dates and oats.  I will get my mask on and go to the store for more ingredients so I can make this again soon!

I enjoyed the combination of the ingredients but I had to add water to make it blend.  Probably 1 cup of water.
