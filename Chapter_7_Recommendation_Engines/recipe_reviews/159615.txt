Our family really loved the flavor of this chowder - albeit with a few changes.  I left out the cumin and added only 1/2 tsp of the red pepper flakes.  This was plenty of zip for our children's tastebuds!  To lighten the recipe I used milk instead of half and half and increased the flour by a tablespoon to keep it thick.  I also didn't add the butter at the end and left out the cheese (although the cheese would have been good).  The soup doesn't look terribly appetizing, but the flavor is fantastic!  Will definitely be making this again!

OOOOO MYYYYYY GOD   SO GOOD TOOK A LITTLE LONG BUT ONCE MY MOTHER HELPED AND CHOPPED EVERYTHING UP WENT WAY FASTER. THIS WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST RECIPES THAT I HAVE MADE FROM THIS SITE. FOLLOWED IT EXACTLY BUT WE DID CHOP THE BACON UPP AN ADDED IT. THE PEPPER GAVE IT A BIT OF A KICK ENOUGH TO GET YOUR NOSE RUNNING BUT IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AS GOOD WITH OUT IT. CANT REALLY TELL THE DIFFERENCE WITH TYHME. PS I HATE ONIONS AND CELERY BUT AS MY MOM SAID IT GIVES IT FLAVOR AND BY THE TIME ITS DONE COOKING YOU CANT REALLY TELL THERE IN THERE. WILL MAKE AGAIN FOR MY UBER CHEF GRANDMOTHER WHO SAYS I WONT GET A HUSBAND CAUSE I CANT COOK. SHE WILL THINK I AM AMAZING WHEN I MAKE IT FOR HERE.

This was "Awesome "says my husband..me on the other hand only gave it a 4. For those of you who don't like too much "thyme" only add half. It killed it. Other than that I will half it next time and it's a TOTAL 5 Stars! Quick note: the butter makes this dish to perfection!

thought I had clams on hand, but didn't, so I made this per original recipe without the clams, and it was EXCELLENT as it was.  Don't think I would like the clams anyway.

Really enjoyed this, so did my husband who doesn't generally like clams. Terrific mix of flavors, seems like an unusual pairing. I also used milk to lighten it up a bit and turkey bacon. Makes great leftovers.

Yum! I added a bit of extra chicken boullion and skipped the carrots. The cumin really added to the taste! Taste better the 2nd day after the flavors have mixed. A keeper.

Great tasting chowder! Although the recipe doesn't say so, I assumed that the bacon gets crumbled and put into the soup. Also, I doubled the potatoes (2 LARGE Idahos) and the chicken (1 lb. instead of 1/2), as I prefer a lot of "stuff" in my chowder. will definitely make again!

I have made this several times and I love it. Now I use it as a base for all different types of chowder. Tonight I am making Smoked Salmon Corn Chowder. I am adding corn and salmon in place of the chicken and clams - delish!!
