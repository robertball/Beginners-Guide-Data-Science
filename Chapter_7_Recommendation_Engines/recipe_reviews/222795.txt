I used sliced baby bella mushrooms and insteaf of using garlic salt, I used Penzey's Shallot Salt. These mushrooms were to die for. I know it's bad to say so but........I ate the whole thing myself. I couldn't help it. And I might just do it again tomorrow.

This recipe is great....have been making mushrooms this way for years....the only changes I make are to use real wine (whatever you drink with your meal) and in place of teriyaki sauce I use Worchestershire sauce...and, I use garlic powder in place of garlic salt due to the amount of sodium that the teriyaki and garlic salt imparts.....of course, this helps if you are on a sodium restricted diet.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. The flavors blend marvelously. I did use baby portobellos, but I'm sure the recipe would work fine with button mushrooms, as well. The only thing I will change next time is to cut back some on the olive oil, maybe using half the recommended about. Otherwise, this is a winner!

These mushrooms were simply delectable and SO simple!  The only change I made was to use baby port mushrooms instead of the button mushrooms (just a personal preference) but OMG these are amazing!!!  I could eat them alone!

My husband and I have made this exactly as written and also used a mix of different kinds of mushrooms. So, so YUMMY! I also wish people would NOT rate a recipe they haven't even tried to make yet! So Annoying! To the “Pro” who simply wrote “Who in the world uses COOKING WINE?”... I guess you felt the need to write that just to be rude since your “review” didn’t mention actually trying the mushrooms at all.

What a superior sauteed mushroom recipe! I did use a Pinot Noir wine instead of cooking wine, and maybe a wee bit more than a tablespoon, also added in a couple extra cloves of garlic. The wine really enhances the flavor of the mushrooms. Simmer slowly over low heat to preserve the great flavor of the wine. The only change I'd make for the next time of making these is to double the batch! We had these over a nice grilled steak.

I can't deal with garlic(I know, that one in a million?) so instead just added a dash of garlic powder, used a good red table wine and finished the recipe as written.  The perfectly cooked mushrooms were the topping for some lovely grilled ribeyes and we are looking forward to doing this again.  Beyond delicious!

The only change I made was to use Worcestershire sauce instead of the teriyaki sauce and red wine vinegar instead of the cooking wine.  I also made it in the pan I'd just cooked a few steaks in.  Served with those, this was a gourmet meal for two for less than the price of a single dish at a restaurant!  Will definitely make again!

This has become my go to mushroom recipe. I've made it even easier using Land O Lakes 1/2 butter 1/2 olive oil cubes with herbs and garlic. I used Kikkoman teriyaki sauce and Trader Joe's balsamic for the wine. So easy and so tasty. They're great added to rice with steamed shredded carrots as a meal. They act like meat.

I wish people would review the recipe as written.  How do you know something isn't good unless you try it once!  Anyway, this was really easy and tasty.  This was not too salty.  It was just perfect.  I bought an 8 oz pack of mushrooms, so I had to cut the recipe in half.  My only suggestion is a matter of my taste and that is to buy whole mushrooms and cut them real thin.  Mmm...I love them cooked down.  The cooking wine I had on hand was Holland's cooking sherry (about $3-4 a bottle).  Definitely try this recipe AS WRITTEN!!!

My wife and I loved this mushroom recipe, which we used to garnish our NY Strip steaks. The red cooking wine provides an interesting, exotic flavor, which meshes well with the other ingredients. It's nearly perfect and I plan to use this recipe as my default sauteed mushrooms recipe, unless I get the itch to try another recipe.

I am with Sarah Jo on this one. I used button because that is what I had and REAL red wine with Penzey Shallot Salt. Decreased both olive oil and butter by TBS an they were still delicious.. And like another reviewer, that was dinner and ate them all.

Made as directed the first time.  Very good, but better without garlic salt, and way too much grease.  Teriyaki sauce is salty enough. Cut butter down to about a teaspoon and splash of EVOO, Subbed garlic powder the second time and much better. Also tripled the red wine (used GOOD wine) the second time, when it sautes down with teriyaki sauce it compliments mushrooms.

Yaa-humm!  You can adjust the oil and butter to your particular diet, but to ask "why all the butter and oil?" (I_Fortuna) I have two words for you....Julia Childs! Fresh garlic (rather than garlic salt) and Baby Bella's make it awesome!

These were good, but mine began to burn using the cooking times indicated.  Rather than regular teriyaki sauce, I used a product called teriyaki baste and glaze which is a bit thicker, which may have contributed to my problem.  I also thought these were a bit greasy and would cut back on the butter and olive oil next time.  The flavor was good and I will try them again.

Very good.  I modified for my diet.  Used very little butter, a splash of soy sauce, red wine and added garlic salt to taste.  With minimum cooking kept the mushroom firm.

This was very good. I halved the amount of olive oil and butter, and microplaned in one very large clove of garlic. I left out the garlic salt, we use very little salt and I didn't think that it would add to the dish.  Other than that I made as directed. Thanks MIG, great recipe.

Yum, loved this!  I used red wine vinegar in place of the wine.  And garlic powder instead of salt since the Teriyaki sauce is so salty.  Really good flavors in this, thanks!

Absolutely delicious!  I opted for Cabernet Sauvignon over cooking wine and used 1 1/2 tbsp.  Turned out wonderfully.  Wish I'd made more!!

I signed up to this site just to leave this comment.  These are fabulous!!  I do not like mushrooms (made them for hubby) and I kept picking them out of the pot to eat. Hubby said they were the best mushrooms he has ever had and he eats them all the time.  My substitutions based on what I had on hand follow.  Only wine I had on hand was red, sweet Roscato Rosso Dolce (the sweet red that Olive Garden used to have - yes laugh all you want but I do like it). Out of olive oil so used only 2 TBLs coconut oil.  Don’t keep Teriyaki around so I looked up how to sub for it: added touch more of the red wine, couple drops honey, dash of ginger, and bit more garlic powder.  Out of garlic cloves so used teaspoon minced jarred stuff from fridge.   Try this recipe, you will not be sorry and you can absolutely tweak & substitute to your liking.

Great recipe and very tasty! I'd have given this a 5 star, except I felt there was too much butter/oil at the end. Also, my DH was a sous chef and were he alive, he'd have been horrified if I had followed the directions exactly and used a cooking wine (I used a quality dry red).  This would be perfect with a tad less butter/oil and if the ingredients called for a good red drinking wine though. Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this again!

Simply wonderful as a side dish for your fabulous steak! As others have done, I substituted garlic powder for the garlic salt, baby bellas for the white mushrooms, and Worcestershire Sauce for the Teriyaki. I used the Pinot Noir (which we were drinking with the steaks) rather than the cooking wine. I used EVOO and Unsalted butter - but only 2T of each. Since I removed all of the salty ingredients I added some freshly grated black pepper and sea salt. SPECTACULAR! Hubs loved it, too. This I will make again and again!

This was tasty on top of steak. Used a splash of regular red wine.. and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Didn't add salt till the end because I like my mushrooms to brown more so then get soggy.. and salt releases the juices preventing that from happening. Would make variations of this again.

I made this recipe tonight. Oh my gosh it was absolutely delicious. It was everything I wanted and more ??.  I used half a tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of EVOO and it was still wonderful. Thank you. This will be a recipe I will keep and use and pass on to my offspring.

Yes I made this recipe and they are the best I have ever had (and I have had some good ones). I didn't have the teriyaki the first time so I substituted soy sauce. Good. Then the next time I made them I used teriyaki and would you believe that we liked them better with the soy sauce although you should cut down the amount of garlic salt. They really are superb!

A pleasant taste on its own, but I'd try it on a hard crust of white bread to balance the sweet taste and rubbery consistence

I made this almost exactly as listed except I don't use wine and used portabella mushrooms. Also, my teriyaki sauce was very salty so I skipped the garlic salt and just added a second garlic clove. This was DIVINE! 

I ended up adding too much teriyaki sauce so I drained the liquid from the mushroom mixture and sauteed up some onions and a little broccoli in that liquid and then combined it all back together. And lo and behold, I had an amazing stir fry base. I mixed this with brown rice (that I made w/ frozen mixed vegetables) and this gave me a super hearty and fairly healthy meal. * The sodium content on my teriyaki sauce is pretty sad so I tried to add lots of veggies.

Fantastic recipe, thanks so much!

These mushrooms were fabulous! We used worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce and no wine. They tasted amazing! My dad couldn't stop eating them out of the pan! Honestly tasted like they should be in a high end restaurant!

They are very tasty... My only thing is never use cooking wine, only use wine you would drink.  Your mushrooms will be much better if you use drinkable wine.

We tried this recipe yesterday and it is now my favorite vegetable!!!  One of our guests has always refused mushrooms, but agreed to try this recipe and is now a lover of mushrooms fixed this way! Everyone at the table requested the recipe! I normally do not substitute the first time I try a recipe, but did not have red cooking wine and had to use burgundy wine instead. Otherwise, the recipe was followed to a "T".

I personally don't like mushrooms, but I made this for my husband and father in law and they loved it. Forgot the garlic because I was rushing. Didn't use as much olive oil, aldo added onion and red bell pepper. I would upload a photo, but I can't on my phone! All in all, this was a good side. 5/5. :]

Made these for dinner tonight to go with some rotisserie BBQ chicken and mashed potatoes and they were delish! The only thing I did different is substitute the teriyaki with Worcestershire sauce so it wouldn't clash with the BBQ. 
This may sound a little funny, but I've tried this dish at Claimjumpers and it is one of my faves so tonight we made it at home for less than 1/4 the cost.

Was looking for a basic sauteed mushroom recipe at the last minute (filet was already on the grill LOL) and this was the 1st one I came upon. No need to look elsewhere! This was delicious! And, like a few others I read, ate a lot of it myself due to non-mushroom-liking family members! Thanks for sharing! Definite add to my recipe box :)

We eat this as a side dish; I use baby bella mushrooms also but no butter or teriyaki sauce (too salty). The wine, garlic, oil, and pepper are flavorful enough and this combo lets you actually taste the mushrooms.

Quite yummy!  I used baby bella mushrooms and cut out the garlic salt because I thought the teriyaki had enough salt taste.  I made a skinnytaste.com dijon pork chop recipe tonight and served these with the chops.  Should've doubled the recipe and there's only two of us!  Will definitely make these again.  Very easy and flavorful.

I didn't have ANY wine for cooking or drinking and I didn't have teriyaki sauce either, so I omitted those, put an extra tablespoon of butter, and dash of soy sauce lol-I hate when people don't follow the recipe just because, but I didn't have certain items but wanted everyone to know that this worked too. My husband thought these were great, I hate mushrooms but make them for him. I never made them before so this helped TREMENDOUSLY and is the highest rated mushroom recipe I've found. Thanks again??

You might want to ignore this review because I did make changes. My usual reviews are based on the recipe as written. I want to know the author's  flavor intent before I make any changes. However in this case, I just cannot use cooking wine. Cooking wine is inferior wine with salt added. In any recipe, please use only wine you would drink. I also do not buy garlic salt. To me it tastes of  chemicals. I try to find good quality garlic powder instead. Add salt to the dish as needed. The other change I made was to brown the mushrooms & fresh garlic in the EVOO/butter and then add the liquids to simmer the shrooms until done. With those changes, this is an easy, delicious way to use mushrooms!

I made steak with steakhouse sides (creamed spinach, these sautéed mushrooms, twice-baked potatoes) for New Years Eve. It was a heavy meal but Oh-So-Sinfully Delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly (perhaps added more red wine and teriyaki) and give this 5 stars. You won’t be disappointed!

I used more garlic and teriyaki sauce than the recipe called for. Served on bagel chips, they disappeared quickly at the party!

Follow the recipe, changing out red wine for the cooking wine and worcestershire for teriyake sauce. Thought they were bland and tasteless. Much prefer using lemon juice and white wine to season mushrooms. Will not waste good mushrooms or wine to make these again.

I loved this recipe! I have made it twice and will not hesitate to make it again. My whole family is a huge fan of mushrooms so we all thought it was great. I don't use the wine or the teriyaki sauce and it still tastes delicious.

Hands down the best! I omit the sherry and add onions. We eat this more than I should admit. Perfect with all cuts of beef, including burgers - even alone!

Loved it but I made minor changes.  Used no wine (due to I'm doing a 28 day challenge and can't have alcohol) and used tamari vs teriyaki to keep it gluten free.  Added extra fresh garlic and no garlic salt and used vegan butter along with olive oil but just used about a tablespoon of olive oil vs the 3.     I'm sure the way the recipe is listed is delicious too.

I decided to make this recipe because I had a pound of Bella Mushrooms that would soon expire. I found this recipe on Allrecipes and decided to give it a whirl. It was delicious. The only things I did differently was to use a sprinkle of garlic powder instead of garlic salt because that is what I had. I also used Worshtershire sauce instead of teriyaki because that is what I had. I used almost 4 cloves of garlic because I love garlic!! I used Holland House cooking Sherry for the wine and it really enhanced the flavor. This recipe tastes delicious alone or would be great on top of steaks or chicken. Definitely recommend it.

I enjoyed to recipe flavors, and that it was quick to make. I added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce to add a more meaty taste.  It was perfect with our grilled London broil and baked potatoes.  However, the mushrooms seemed too oily for my taste.  Next time, I'd reduce the oil to 1 tablespoon or eliminate all together.  There seemed to be plenty of liquid for cooking.  I'll definately make this again and again.

Followed as directed and it tasted like unseasoned mushrooms for some reason.  Maybe I needed to double the sauce or something or that my taste buds are off lol

Delicious! I could not stop eating them! I added a little extra teriyaki because I love the stuff and it was amazing. Even my boyfriend who doesn't care much for mushrooms loved it, try them, you wont be disappointed.

AMAZING! I made to go with grilled sirloin. My guests were raving. Really delicious. I will never make a steak dinner w/out making these!  I have celiac disease, so to make this gluten free, I had to find a gluten-free teriyaki sauce.  (My Whole Foods had Annie Chun's gluten free teriyaki)

Used a red table wine rather than cooking wine. A wonderful blend of flavors. Rather than use these mushrooms to top a baked potato as suggested by the recipe submitter, we topped ‘Garlic Mashed Cauliflower’ from this site. This combination created a terrific side dish.

I loved the taste of this recipe. I ran out of teriyaki sauce and subbed in some balsamic vinegar. The idea that this is suppose to serve 4 is ludicrous. I used it to smother baked chicken and it was a stretch to make it 2 servings.

I took quite a few liberties with this recipe, the main ones being that I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine, and garlic powder and salt instead of garlic salt. Beyond that, I quartered the amount of mushrooms but made a third of the cooking substance. worked out well and we loved it.

I thought these were good. There was another recipe I always used from the site, but I could not find it. I had a little over half of an 8oz package, so I had to cut the recipe way back. The flavor was good, just a little salty between the teriyake and garlic salt.

Insanely good. I add approximately a tablespoon of flour to the mix to thicken the sauce, so none of it gets left behind in the pan! I've done this recipe twice now, and tonight I used white truffle oil, instead of olive oil. Thanks for this great recipe! It has become a new favorite and staple!

I've got to give this 5* even though it turned out way too salty. After reading other reviews, I realized my teriyaki sauce was salty enough and didn't need the garlic salt. So, next time more garlic and no garlic salt. I will probably reduce the amounts of oil and butter since there was a lot left over in the pan.

Very good. I'll use less Teriyaki sauce next time, though, and probably cut the amount of butter and oil.

I thought these were outstanding. I didn't feel like the teriyaki was suffocating at all! In fact, my husband (who hates teriyaki) never guessed that it was in there. We all really enjoyed these.

My husband and i loved these. After reading all the reviews i only used 2 tbs of olive oil and butter. Next time i make it i will use the 3Tbs instead because we loved the sauce. I also used garlic powder instead of salt and used  extra chopped garlic (we are garlic lovers) i used sweet muscadine wine. Will definatley make again.

Instead of wine I used Trader Joe’s balsamic vinegar sauce and instead of garlic salt I used garlic powder and minced garlic as I read previous reviews that this recipe can be salty. I also added some onion and green onion for flavor and color. It came out so beautifully flavored. I recommend letting it simmer the full duration of time to let the flavors fully soak into the mushrooms. Will definitely make it again!

This is a great recipe.I had been given some white mushrooms and I did not know what to do with them.I love mushrooms but, my children do not.I can eat them with nothing else.I made this recipe because I had everything I needed except white wine and olive oil.I substituted olive oil with avocado oil and I did not use any wine at all.It was delicious,I could eat them just like that.

My husband and I loved this recipe! I started as recipe stated then added cut onion, enough to cover bottom of skillet. Let them simmers for 5-7 minutes until soft then added thick sliced Portabella mushrooms. Added a little more wine and Teriyaki sauce and let it all simmer for about 10-12  minutes. Paired this with a Fillet and honestly we ate more of the mushrooms than the steak.  Will  diffently  make this again.

Very tasty. It never occurred to me to use wine in mushrooms, but it added a nice flavor.  The amount of oil and butter in the recipe seems excessive.  I didn’t use nearly that much.  I also added some onions.

The mushrooms turned out great even though I didn’t have cooking wine and I was too lazy to use fresh garlic. I used 1 1/2 lbs whole and halved button mushrooms and cooked in the butter at first. After things were browning, I added a small “splash” of olive oil. (I didn’t add as much EVOO because of the other reviews) I sautéed on Med-Hi for 5-6 min. Stirring every few seconds. After this I added granulated garlic and a little onion salt. I used ~1 T Trader Joe’s teriyaki and a splash of water to loosen the browned bits (no wine on hand). When it was nearly evaporated I put a lid on, and let the mushrooms simmer in their own juices. It really turned out delicious for our hamburgers tonight. I look forward to making these again. Everyone gobbled them up!

I have used this recipe to make the mushrooms several times in the past.  The flavor is fantastic and the mushrooms can be used a number of ways including  serving them as a side dish.  This is a true keeper and I will be making them again in the future.

This is awesome !  I used Worcestershire sauce instead of teriyaki because that’s what I have and I didn’t use red cooking wine !  They were awesome it’s easy and you can adjust what you want !! These are the best  I have ever made !!

I lost count on how many times I've made sauteed mushrooms.  Don't be afraid to use soy sauce instead of teriyaki and more fresh garlic.  I'll use Marsala wine to gourmet things up for my pizza toppings.

Excellent recipe. Made it twice and will continue to add to the rotation. I used Worcestershire instead of teriyaki since that is our preference.

These mushrooms were great and I followed the recipe exactly! I used them to go with my Italian beef sandwiches along with some peppers and onions. Next time I’ll double the recipe to get at least 6 servings - they’re going to be wonderful over steaks!

I make them as written since there are a couple of things that are to "taste".  That means I usually use a little more teriyaki and a little more garlic salt, but they are always a hit and there's never any left!

Cooked a rib eye steak in the cast iron with butter and just used the drippings instead of adding additional butter.
Turned out perfect.

Excellent recipe. I've tried making sauteed mushrooms but this recipe worked. I didn't have Teriyaki sauce so I substituted oyster sauce and it was delicious. I also substituted regular wine for the cooking wine.

I made these delicious sauteed mushrooms for our Classic Car Club Christmas Party.  The main entree was Prime Rib and these mushrooms added so much to this dish.  They were a huge hit.   I had ladies come up to me all night asking what was in them.  These mushrooms will always be part of any steak or Prime Rib dinner in the future.

I've made these mushrooms three times now and my family has gobbled them up every time. They go well with any type of steak or ground meat "steak" such as ground turkey  which has become my 'go to' choice with the addition of sauteed onions and gravy. This recipe is a keeper!

Amazing and so easy!! I swapped the red cooking wine for balsamic vinegar and used. minced garlic in place of sliced garlic. Then I used a combination of baby portobello, shiitake and button mushrooms.

So I had some leftover on cooked mushrooms and I wanted to make something with them before they went bad so I found this dish and it is absolutely delicious and super easy to make! I did change it up a little since I didn’t not have to ingredients. The only ingredients I changed was, instead of red cooking wine I used Red wine (Merlot) and instead of teriyaki sauce I used Worcestershire sauce. It’s so tasty and full of flavor.

These are so good. Made a double batch and place in freezer bags for later. Didn’t have red wine so sub cooking sherry,  it worked fine. Will use as a condiment.Thanks.

I subbed in Worcestershire sauce for the Teriyaki, and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I also quartered the mushrooms rather than slicing them.  These are amazing!  Very easy to do, and they impressed my dinner company.

I did Balsalmic instead of teriyaki or worchester, and it added a tang to the mushrooms that was enjoyable.

sauteed onions don't need anything. all the ingredients with these shrooms do a great job adding something different to a steak/burger. wine, garlic and teriyaki all enhance whats there. thank you mushroom recipe person.

Followed the recipe as written except for keeping an extea-close eye on the doneness of the cake. (Added a bit more baking time as my oven tends to run cooler than expected.) As usual with delicious foods of any flavor profile, I could have eaten the entire thing myself

Yummy- so easy, so quick- I used ghee for butter and really didn’t measure;so I probably used more wine and didn’t add any garlic salt as I normally don’t salt-there was plenty of flavor that I didn’t need it.  This is most definitely a repeat for me.

I added a bit more teriyaki sauce than the recipe called for because my husband thought it needed more salt (I didn't think it did). I have remade these several times and I always get compliments on them.

Made this with sliced baby bella mushrooms. Didn't have any wine or teriyaki sauce so I substituted some balsamic vinaigrette and a little soy sauce.  Sooo good, cant wait to try it with the actual ingredients.

This is my go to recipe for sautéed mushrooms - they are a hit every time!  I make them as a side, with steaks, chicken, you name it.   My only tip is to make sure you don't over cook them - soggy mushrooms are not as good as when they are perfectly tender!  Great recipe and will use forever!

This recipe  came out pretty good. I wasn't wowed with it. Had a hint of the flavors of the ingredients but all in all, pretty bland. I'll use this recipe  again but will add more of just about everything except  the mushrooms  and the oils

Came out great.  I caramelized the garlic in the butter to start... I also added 1tsp of  Worcester sauce as well.  Mmm

These were so good! I used low sodium soy sauce instead of the teriyaki and omitted the butter and it came out great. The wine is what made it. Delicious!

This is one of the best mushroom recipes ever.  I used plain garlic powder rather than garlic salt.  It didn't need the extra salt.

I made these mushrooms tonight to go with a nice BBQ’d tri tip steak.  They were fantastic. And with four of us, they were gone!!  The only change I made was to add some finely diced onions. Everyone one agreed, a real keeper.  Oh, and I may have doubled the amount of wine. :) Thanks for the great recipe.

I used baby Bella mushrooms. I never use garlic salt so I used garlic powder and added a little Kosher Salt to taste. Also I used 3 tablespoons of Marsala Sweet wine. Mushrooms came out superb! I used them in a Cooper Sharp and Provolone cheese Omelet for dinner! My husband couldn't eat fast enough... Turned out delicious!

Best 'shrooms ever! I always use  a good red wine, soy sauce instead of teriyaki, and skip the garlic salt. Sorry if I changed your recipe, but I would have never thought of it without your post. Thanks!

I used sliced baby bella mushrooms, and I was out of teriyaki sauce, but had some Korean BBQ. I ate a pound of sauteed mushrooms plain all by myself. They're that good. I think soy sauce would also be a good substitute for the teriyaki, especially if you're looking for a less sweet flavor. This is going to be a regular for sure.

These are AMAZING!!! Even my husband and daughter, who are not fans of mushrooms, loved them! The only thing I did differently than the recipe is skipped the wine and doubled the teriyaki sauce. I will definitely make these over and over again!

A family favorite for the past six months.  Perfect as is.   

Can make Paleo/Whole 30 compliant by changing butter to ghee and cooking wine to balsamic vinegar without added sulfites.  Tastes the same as original.

Loved these mushrooms!! They were fantastic. The only change I made was I did half of a roasted garlic teriyaki sauce and half regular (just being curious). These mushrooms were super easy and delicious, they complimented the rib eyes perfectly.

Excellent recipe; this recipe never fails. I switch out the teriyaki sauce with worcestershire and add some thyme at the end. Sensational by themselves, as a side, or as a topping (on meats, cauliflower rice, jasmine rice).

I've made this several times, the first time exactly as written and I'm basing 5 stars on the recipe as written. It's delicious and wants for nothing exactly as written. 

I've changed up the teriyaki sauce and cooking wine with whatever I have on hand and find this recipe very adaptable.  Tonight I substituted Maggi sauce for the teriyaki and sherry for the cooking wine.  I also increased the garlic to 3 cloves and added some onion.   

Another thing I tend to do with sauteed mushrooms is let them caramelize. 

This recipe is awesome as written and awesome if modified.

I've made this a couple of times with a homemade teriyaki sauce and good results. Tried the original recipe first, and liked it very much. Tried a nice merlot instead of red cooking wine, a sprinkling of garlic powder instead of sliced cloves, also with good results. An excellent stand alone side dish as well. Highly recommend this keeper.

SO good! Had this with Filet Mignons with Pepper Cream Sauce from this site. I only had 8 oz of mushrooms on hand, and I had it all myself with no problem! Hey, mushrooms are good for ya, right?  I didn't have teriyaki sauce available, so I used Worcestershire sauce, as others have mentioned. I used a chianti in place of the cooking wine. I'd prefer to go with whatever red wine I had on hand. Thanks - great recipe!

Delish. Used veg oil because I ran out of olive oil. Nobody noticed or complained. Tripled the recipe for a dinner for 11 people. No leftovers.

Tastes like the kind you order in an upscale restaurant.  Easy, delicious, and leftovers are fab in an omelet the next morning.

I didn't have any red cooking wine, so I use Merlot.  I thought these were pretty good, but a little to garlicy for my taste.

I hate mushrooms, but I made them for my dear husband. I followed most of the recipe. I say this beacause I didn't have red wine, so I used cooking white wine instead. Once I was done sautéing them, I ended up trying them...OMG, they were so flavorful and delicious. I still wouldn't run out and buy them every day, but I am a actually willing to eat them now. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you,

Delicious! I have attempted to make mushrooms for years and never knew how easy, and yet still so delicious, they can be. I omitted the teriyaki as I can't have soy. I added fresh thyme. The mushrooms cooked quickly and were so very yummy. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wished I could give this recipe 10 stars!  Followed the recipe exactly with an exception of using light soy.  Served it over pasta  as a side for chicken barbecue.  Oh & sprinkled fresh chopped parsley to finish it off!  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe with us all.

I meant to follow a different recipe when I started but went with the flow.  I had to add a lot of red wine, and reduce the moisture to get a nice flavor.  (everyone likes different things)

The mushrooms were far too sweet with balsamic vinegar.

Stopping by to say thank you. 
For me, this was THE base I was looking for. 
It only goes up from here!
This recipe is the 3rd link on the whole world-wide-web that pops up when searching "Pan cooked mushrooms" and the 1st recipe from Allrecipes and  let me tell you, it makes sense. 
I am just beginning to explore the horizons and this recipe is simply beautiful.  I am grateful :)
...can y'all tell?! 
Try it. Alter it. Play with it...you'll see....

This is an amazingly easy recipe, and it's wonderful.  I made a few tweaks: substituted soy sauce for teriyaki and used about 1/4 of red wine instead of red cooking wine.  It was wonderful!  It's a keeper!!

Delicious.  As some other suggested I substituted Red Wine Vinegar for the Wine and Worcester Sauce for the Teriyaki Sauce.

EXCELLENT!  I didn't have teriyaki sauce so I looked up subs online and improvised.  WOW, was that good!  I only had 1/2 lb. of mushrooms.  Wish I had more because it never made it to the dish it was supposed to go with.  LOL  I picked at it while it  was in the pan and then threw some in a leftover (so so) rice dish from last night and it brought it to life. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this a few times now using button, shitake or cremini (baby bella) mushrooms and folks always devour them. I do use tamari instead of soy, sea salt instead of garlic salt, Chianti (our favorite) or Merlot for the wine and have started melting a couple of anchovies into the butter-olive oil combo. This makes everything better and are even great on their own.

I've made this recipe twice and it's simply great!  The only change I make is using crimini mushrooms and to increase the number of garlic cloves because that's my personal preference.  This is my go-to recipe for sauteed mushrooms.

To make these vegan once I used earth balance another time I used coconut oil absolutely delicious. It can get salty though since the mushrooms loose quite a bit of water.  I had left overs and the next day I threw the mushrooms into some cashew cream and then on pasta... OMG soo good.

This dish was delish!! I have to confess that I didn't use the cooking wine because I didn't have any on hand but it didn't seem to matter with the overall deliciousness of this recipe. These mushrooms were to die for!!

These were great! I am not partial to mushrooms but have been trying to incorporate them as we go more vegetarian, and these were really good. I spooned a few on a piece of cheesy garlic bread, and it was quite tasty, and I'll probably throw the rest in with some stir fried veg for dinner. Thanks for sharing. Update: I made this for the second time today, this time cutting both the oil and the butter by half, and I didn't notice any difference in flavor.  Might as well save on the calories, right?

Simple but SOOOO good.  I combined them at the very end with some freshly caramelized vidalia onions and served over teriyaki steak.  Making a bigger batch next time!

I love upscale restaurants and go to many.  I made these and, shortly thereafter, went to two such establishments and ordered sauteed mushrooms - I love mushrooms!  NO CONTEST!!  This recipe is amazing and I promise you won't be disappointed..  I do use more garlic and more teriyaki sauce.

This was a huge hit with kids and adults alike! I will definitely make this delicious side dish again!  I made 4 1/2 pounds,  and I altered the fats that go into this recipe to make it healthier and dairy-free. I used 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of margarine per 2.25 pounds.

The only change I made was fresh garlic instead of garlic powder as that was what I had on hand.  These were divine. Even a non mushroom eater at the table tried them and liked them.  I also used baby Bella's not white mushrooms. Again what I had on hand

Awesomely good! Simple, fast to make and tastes great. I made some changes to personal preference. Used baby bella mushrooms unsliced, red wine (because I have this in the house) and no added salt. Used low sodium sauce. I could sit down and eat the whole bunch by myself. I have made this multiple times.

I have tried many sautéed mushroom recipes but this is my favorite. I cut down on the amount of oil and butter and it was fine that way. I used baby bellas. I will definitely make these again.

Easy recipe and very tasty.  
I cut mushrooms in quarters and Caramelized in hot oil and butter before adding rest of ingredients.  Used Marsala wine and they came out delicious.

We love these mushrooms on burgers, steaks and  grilled chicken sandwiches! So easy to make, but they add such a great flavor to whatever we put them on. Instead of teriyaki sauce, I added the same amount of Worcestershire sauce.

I substituted balsamic vinegar for teriyaki sauce and used sea salt, and used dealcoholized wine.  If I had thought of it I would have thrown a sprig of fresh thyme in it and a squrt of fresh lemon juice.

I've always just used butter and garlic for my sauteed mushrooms. I didn't have Teriyaki sauce so I used Allegro Original Marinade, but I did add Teriyaki sauce to my shopping list so I can follow the recipe exactly the next time. Great recipe, fast, easy and very yummy!

I  will definitely make it again! If you like mushrooms, you will love these! I  agree with the other reviewer who said that she would reduce the amount of olive oil,  maybe half  the amount. Otherwise, this is a wonderful recipe!

I used Portobello mushrooms, baby shitaki and dogboy mushrooms. Instead of teriyaki sauce I used glaze and to make it creamier added a tiny bit of cornstarch. Full body Spanish red wine and 5 cloves of garlic. Great success!

I used a low sodium soy sauce instead of teriyaki and topped it on a ribeye steak. Delicious!

Thoroughly enjoyed the recipe, but this time I made a couple of alterations.  I, as have others, used baby portobellos.   I doubled the recipe, with quadruple the garlic, but 1/4 the garlic salt.  Instead I used 4 dashes of Worcestershire and three pinches of truffle salt.  Delicious!  Oh - I forgot the wine - I think I drank it instead...

I was looking for something a little different than my usual sauteed mushrooms.  These fit the bill and were really quite good.  I did cut back on the teriyaki a bit...perfect!

This recipe is WONDERFUL!!!!  I don't alter it one bit!!  You can put chopped onions in it, but it's not necessary.  This is good on top of steaks or could be eaten as a side dish.  The first time I made it was the summer of 2015, and have made it many times since then.  I have also shared this recipe with many people.  I can't recommend it enough.

Very good mushrooms. I also cut olive oil by 1/4 and substituted worcestershire sauce for teriaki sauce. I at least doubled the red wine.  They had a really good flavor!

I probably shouldn't rate since I had to substitute a lot of ingredients! I used A1 steak sauce and white wine instead of teriyaki sauce and red wine. It was still excellent, perfect with the steak. I also just used regular salt instead of garlic salt. Will definitely make again!

I loved this recipe, as did my husband; he doesn't often enjoy mushrooms as a side dish, but this recipe won him over.   I used baby bellas, white balsamic vinegar and left out the parsley because I didn't have any.    Served with pan-fried sweet potato slices and arctic char with a garlic-lemon sauce.   Delicious!

These are addicting! They are so good! I make these every time I have steak now. The only thing I do differently is I use baby portabellas and I add 1 small onion. Thank you for the recipe!

Used crimini mushrooms and served as a side to Italian - they were delicious and easy. I just think I should have continued to sauté longer so they softened more.

I decided to add Tabasco Chipotle sauce instead of the Teriyaki sauce to add a little bit of smokiness and heat to the mushrooms.  Loved it.

Universal approval at our house! I like this better than using soy or Worcestershire sauce, both of which are fine recipes. I would give this 5 stars using low sodium teriyaki sauce and a little less salt, but that's a matter of taste. This is my new go-to; thanks!

As is this is a very good little recipe :)I think the trick to this dish is to cover the frying pan while sauteeing the mushrooms. You won't need as much oil & butter, this will eliminate burning, plus you'll wind up with a little bit of sauce since the mushrooms will eke out much of their liquid and won't evaporate readily since you've covered the pan.

I HATE mushrooms. But when I saw the beautiful portabellos at the grocery, I decided I wanted to try them and expand my horizons!! Lol. When I tell you that I could literally eat these every day, I'm not joking. They're THAT good. With steak, grilled chicken, potatoes au gratin, that's just to name a few. These things are to die for. I love them. I never have red cooking wine, so I leave it out. But they're wonderful. I've convinced friends and family members that hate mushrooms to try them, and they're a hit!! And because they're so easy, I cook them often!

These are quite good ....... needs a bit of a kick, though. The next time I make it I may add a dash of Worcestershire, a sprinkle of cayenne ...... and possibly a bit of corn starch to thicken it. I used all measures exactly but only 8oz. of mushrooms as there was only 2 of us. It worked for my picky wife but I think it could be a bit better. Great starting point, though.

These were incredibly delicious and super simple to make.  We used olive oil instead of butter.  Wow!  We did used button mushrooms and they were scrumptious.  We used tamari and added just a bit of sugar as a teriyaki sub.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  This is a keeper!

We've never made mushrooms for steak at home but almost always order it when out at restaurants . . . . now that has changed.   This mushroom recipe is simple, easy and delish.   We followed the recipe but added more garlic due to our affinity for it.

I did not have teriyaki so I used 1 tablespoon Worcestershire instead.  Turned out excellent.  I tried substituting low sodium soy sauce for the teriyaki but it was WAY too salty (despite being low sodium!).  Stick with the Worcestershire if you have to substitute.  :)

I am not a big fan of garlic so I added just a slight amt of garlic and added onion instead. I also used wild mitake mushrooms (hen of the woods) and Ioved it.  I also changed the cooking wine to a dry red wine. I could have eaten the whole pan! I was so GOOD!

I've made a few types of sauteed mushrooms and these have been the best.  The only change I made is I used apple cider vinegar instead of the wine.

This was so good and I used half of the leftover juice and sauteed my spinach in it! Yummy!! 
I didn't have red wine so I used balsamic vinegar and I didn't have teriyaki but I can only imagine the taste if I had all the ingredients! Lol... Seriously though, it was good

This is a great recipe for sauteed mushrooms. I made a few changes to the recipe though. Instead of using red wine, i used red wine vinegar, i did without the teriyaki sauce altogether, and cooked on medium-high heat giving it a seared result. Everyone that's tried it this way have all said it's the best sauteed mushrooms they've ever had.

This is simply perfect.  I have thrown away all my previous recipes for sauteed mushrooms.  The beauty of this recipe is that you do not have to make it perfectly and it still holds up.  Highly recommended.

These were indeed, superb! Didn't have teriyaki sauce, so substituted 2 teaspoons low sodium soy sauce and 2 teaspoons A-1 Bold & Spicy for the tablespoon of teriyaki sauce.  Threw in about a teaspoon of chopped fresh parsley in the last couple minutes of cooking because I had it.  Didn't need any additional salt, so didn't add the garlic salt.  Everyone thought they wet delicious.

I just made these today. I had 16 ozs of sliced mushrooms that I needed to use. Did a search & found this recipe. Hard to believe that it is so easy to make such good sautéed mushrooms.  I did the following substitutes that many others did:  I used a red drinking wine that I had on hand. (If a recipe calls for red cooking wine, I'm pretty sure you can substitute a red drinking wine.)  I used the worchestershire sauce instead of teriyaki sauce because that is what I had on hand.  I also used garlic powder rather than garlic salt.  My husband & I both loved it.  Will do with the teriyaki next time, because that sounds good too.  This is recipe is being added to my favorite list of recipes!!  Someone said they froze it for future use.  Will research & hope I can make more & freeze for later!!

I'm always looking for new ways to enhance the taste of the meals I prepare.  This recipe took a very good steak to new heights.  I've prepared mushrooms for steak or hamburger many different ways.  This was the best and it will be my goto recipe for grilled beef.

I to used sliced Baby Bella's, and instead of 'cooking' wine, I used about three tablespoons worth of a GOOD Cream Sherry wine.
As stated by others "These are to die for"

This is a great recipe! I love the flavor. I decided to try it in the crock pot and added some beef ribs. For the ribs I doubled everything except for the red cooking wine which I replaced with two buck chuck red wine and tripled the amount. Cooked on low for 6.5 hours and kept warm in the crock pot for an hour more. It's fall off the bone good and delicious.

Great side dish. Very easy to make. I didn't have any red wine and used red wine vinegar instead. It turned out fabulous! I'm sure with the wine - it will be even better. We served it over rice.  This is definitely a keeper.

THIS IS SCRUMPTIOUS!!! LOVED IT. I substituted sea salt with the garlic salt, however, I tasted the sauce before adding salt and pepper and it was great without it. Next time I won't use any additional salt.

I just made a half-recipe of these mushrooms.  They were really tasty!  I didn't have the wine, so I *slightly* increased the teriyaki sauce.  I used plenty of fresh garlic, and skipped the garlic salt, because I didn't think it'd need any salt.  

Mmmm.  My husband and daughter don't like mushrooms, so I had to eat them all by myself.  :-)  Next time I'll probably decrease the oil/butter a little, and I won't bother increasing the teriyaki.  I'm glad I left out the garlic salt, because I think that would have made it too salty.  

Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my goodness! My favorite mushroom recipe ever! I made these as a side dish not to top meat so I used baby portobella mushrooms and just cut them in half. My family loves them! Last week I was visiting my sister and made these to go with her dinner. Everyone loved them and was asking for more. The next day she bought more mushrooms so I could make them again.  Love!!

Made this tonight to serve with steak. I did use soy sauce instead of teriyaki, probably a LOT more garlic salt. It was superb. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious!   I did not have cooking wine or teriyaki sauce - substituted a good quality balsamic and it was fabulous;  I used a package of gourmet mushrooms from the supermarket.

I have made this recipe three time now and it is exactly what the title calls it -- "SUPERB." I follow the recipe exactly and it is a huge hit. Last night I let the mushrooms and sauce slowly cook down to a syrupy consistency and it was even better. I would gladly serve this to company as it tastes gourmet. It is excellent over steak, chicken, and even pork. Even my husband who doesn't like mushrooms loved this!
