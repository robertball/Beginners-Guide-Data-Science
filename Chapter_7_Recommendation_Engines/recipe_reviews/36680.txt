Very easy and very tasty!  I served this as an appetizer for friends and they all asked for the recipe.  Great with mini water crackers and over a cucumber round.

This makes a tasty appetizer that I enjoyed on crackers, would probably also be good as a sandwich spread or on bagels. I didn't puree mine, just diced the celery very fine, grated the onion, and mashed up everything with a fork. I also used cottage cheese instead of ricotta. I wasn't sure if my lack of a food processor would make this turn out okay. I had my doubts but the end result was quite tasty!
