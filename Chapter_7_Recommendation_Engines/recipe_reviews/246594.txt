4 stars because the cooking instructions are not very good This is very tasty but after reading the other review I cooked it on low for 2 hours stirring every 20 mins or so and it turned out well cooked. I can't imagine trying to cook it for longer than 3 hrs without it over cooking and turning out dry and jerky like

This is delicious. I add a bit more of each ingredient to make more sauce. I also add oyster sauce to the crockpot. At the end I toss in water chestnuts, broccoli & mushrooms. Serve over Brown rice!

Like another reviewer said, four stars due to the poor cooking instruction. I doubled the marinade recipe (as I used 2lb of beef very thinly sliced) and forewent the marination altogether. I poured the marinade right into the slow cooker. I cooked this on LOW for TWO hours, stirring every 20 minutes. It came out absolutely perfect. I plucked out the beef and poured the excess marinade/sauce into a saucepan. I proceeded to bring this to a boil and added some cornstarch slurry to thicken. Served with stir-fried noodles and veg. Very good.

Slow cooker Bulgogi Haiku: "Beef turned to 'jerky', stringy & tough, cooked too long. Flavor was quite rich." Six hrs. on low and our thinly-sliced beef was dry and tough from being in there w/ not enough liquid for that long of a time. I was in the process of making rice, so I quickly stir-fried a mixed frozen bag of veggies, which ended up absorbing the bulgogi "sauce" from the slowcooker - that was quite tasty. I just don't think the cooking method worked so great here.

I doubled the recipe of the marinade.  I did not marinate the meat prior to cooking. I used sirloin and cooked on low for 8 hours. It came out great. I served it over garlic mashed potatoes.

Very good. Stove top instead of slow cooker works well too.

I will make it again but with less pepper a full teaspoon of pepper is way to much, I will use 1/2 that next time

I made it exactly to the recipe. While the meat was tender enough, it just tasted like soy sauce and neither me nor my children really liked it all. And while usually I can see merit in trying to fix a recipe, this one just doesn't seem worth the effort.

I made the marinade as directed, but added about 2 cups of water to the crock pot or it would have dried out.  The water created a sauce and it didn't taste diluted.

Although I like trying new recipes, this one didn't do it for us.  Based on other reviewer's suggestions, I doubled the marinade, increased the garlic to 6 cloves and about an hour before it was done, I added sliced mushrooms, sliced water chestnuts and the green onion.  I had also increased the toasted sesame seeds to about 1 TBL.  I was very glad for the increased sauce, but overall, thought the flavor was lacking.  It was basically meat cooked in soy sauce.  It's not one we will be making again.  Thanks for the recipe - you never know until you try something!

Used my Instant Pot. Totally cooked on 1 hour on the High setting. I just replaced the white sugar with brown sugar, followed the rest of the directions exactly. It was great.

Made the recipe according to guide except for sesame oil (replaced with olive oil since itâ€™s what I had on hand) and garnished with toasted sesame seeds as well. Turned out amazing, will definitely make it again.

I made the whole marinade at once, put the meat in and put in fridge overnight then took crockpot out in morning and cooked on low for about 6 hours, served with mashed potatoes and sugar snap peas.  Kids ate it up great. Was easy and good, but not phenomenal. A bit greasy, with the whole amount definitely enough liquid, not jerky like at all.

Good overall. It turned out quite salty due to the soy sauce. I'd put less sauce on my rice next time. I also cooked it in a skillet instead of the slow cooker since I was in a hurry.
