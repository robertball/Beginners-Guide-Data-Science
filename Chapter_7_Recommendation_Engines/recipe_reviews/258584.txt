Oops.  More info here.  Other than lack of directions, there is also lack of flavor.  Pepper, sausage, couscous, onion, salt, squash all quite bland both alone and in this.   So, a really good bland mix of a couple things and kind of mealy texture with couscous and squash.  That’s how it hit my pallet.  The sausage was good, and would be fine alone but that’s just a heat-up item from the store

I liked the recipe, although I felt like it could more creamy.  I used this recipe for chicken sausage:  : https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/chicken-sausage-patties.   And I only had quinoa.  But i still liked it

Tasty recipe... just need a couple of tweaks for my taste.  I would recommend cooking the sausage first on the stovetop along with the green peppers.  The green peppers, even though a small dice really never got tender and the sausage texture would benefit from some browning I think.. and would add some flavor.
