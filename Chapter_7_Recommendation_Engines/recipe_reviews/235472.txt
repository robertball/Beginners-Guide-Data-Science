I tried this recipe this last Thanksgiving and oh myyy, it was amazing. My entire family absolutely loved it. I'm 20 years old, my parents this year  were working all day so my mom wasn't able to cook. Couple days ago, my family asked me to cook our Christmas turkey. So honored haha.
The only different things I did were, instead of leaving the turkey out for one hour I left it out for one and a half hours because I was using the oven for a pie. And also I didn't use the creme fraiche, I just used sour cream. Delicious

Please don't be afraid of the ingredients list.  This turkey is amazing.  I've made it twice now and my BF drools and begs every time he walks into the kitchen which smells absolutely amazing.  Only change I made was to use lite mayo instead of oil and fat free sour cream with flour instead of crème fraiche.  We do prefer to bake this covered for a couple hours and then uncover for the last hour.

Don't be afraid!  I was looking for something different to do with a roasted chicken and this was unbelievably delicious!  We skipped the jalapenos and creme fresh due to dietary restrictions.  Despite altering the recipe the result was incredible.  The rich, deep smoky flavor was a welcome change to orange, garlic, or sweet BBQ chicken options. The fresh herbs used at the end were a great fresh finish. We all sat around after dinner just picking more meat off the bone , because we couldn't stop ourselves.  This will be part of my permanent collection!

This is the best turkey I have EVER had in my life!!!! It was better than the Peruvian chicken at well known city restaurant. Hubby even brought the left overs to work AFTER Thanks Giving and it was gone! The guys really like this and they are begging me to make it this Thanks Giving! However, we've just relocated to a high elevation, any advice on cooking it at high elevation would be great!

I make this all the time! Sometimes we just buy a turkey breast and it works well for that as well. My whole family loves it and always request it when we host a family dinner. I highly recommend this recipe!!! The gravy is to die for!

My son and I have a turkey competition every year. This year, he grilled two turkeys with each half being a different flavor. I roasted my turkey with half of mine being this Peruvian recipe. It was FANTASTIC!  The gravy was incredible. Even with the odds stacked against me with his four flavors pitted against my two flavors, I still won the competition!  I only wish I had cooked both halves this way!  Despite the long list of ingredients, this really was an easy turkey to prepare. I will definitely be making this again!

My husband is Peruvian. We loved it. We did not however make the sauce since Jalapeños are not Peruvian but you can probably substitute with a Peruvian pepper.

This was a great recipe with a lot of flavor. I prepared it on a rotisserie and it came out perfect. Served with some Cuban black beans, which I included some of the Peruvian spice mixture in, and some spicy sweet potatoes. With the gravy on top of it all, it was a perfect meal to enjoy with friends. Thanks Chef John!

Helllooo cumin!! Wowza! The cumin completely overtook the entire thing.  Next time I will just use a pinch.  I tested this out on a 5lb whole chicken  to make sure it is something we could use for Thanksgiving, and boy I'm glad I did. With some tweaks I think it would be passable, but the way it is in the recipe is not so good. Cut wayyy down on the cumin, add some heat like red chili flakes, and maybe a tad more soy sauce.  I didn't make the 'gravy', and the skin (crust) was not crispy at all. In all fairness I think it's because my oven isn't the greatest, and also because I had to adjust the time and temperature to cater to a chicken rather than a big turkey. I'll give it another shot, but I'm glad I tried this out before Turkey Day! *UPDATE* I changed this from 3 stars down to 2, because the leftovers (which were a lot) were terrible. Something happened in the fridge over night, and the spices completely changed their flavor. The cumin was still way too overpowering, and the others turned grainy and very off-tasting. Most of Chef John's recipes are a hit, but this one was definitely a miss.

The only substitution I made was for the creme fraiche. I used sour cream instead. I also did not blend the spices since they already made a paste. Almost had no leftovers and the gravy is great for sopping!

I didn't have any smoked paprika I just used 4TBL paprika along with some liquid smoke.  Was the moistest white meat I've ever had.  I also like the flavor of cumin, so I found the meat delicious.  Best Thanks Giving turkey I have ever made. Easy to follows directions.  Recommend it to everyone.

I'm Peruvian, so I was looking for a recipe to make the Pollo a la Brasa. Ended up using this recipe and oh my! I butterflied the chicken and cooked it in a charcoal bbq. It was Amazing! Just like back in Peru. I only did the marinating part. Will definitely make it again!

I worried that the cumin might be overwhelming, and it was just a tad stronger than we liked, but this was a wonderful turkey! I had only sour cream, so I added a bit of cornstarch to the sauce mixture. My family really enjoyed the flavors, and it was moist and tender, even though it was a less-than-quality bird. Thanks for a lovely, flavorful new way to roast a turkey!

why not 6 stars, or ten?  I had NEVER made a turkey this good before.  every bite was seasoned.  the skin, wow.  that gravy!  even my gravy-and-sauce-hating husband liked this gravy, and asked for it all weekend on his leftover rolls.  honestly, you need to try this recipe!  do NOT skimp on that rub!  thanks, Chef John, we're not having Mexican food for TG any more.  PERUVIAN TURKEY!

I am of Afro-Ecuadorian heritage and was looking for an easier alternative to the elaborate way we roast turkey.  What a great alternative.  This recipe was amazing and I absolutely loved the sauce.  I had a 20 pound turkey so I doubled the ingredients.  Had a lot of the dry rub left over and it still came out very delicious.  I used Bragg's Liquid Amino instead of soy sauce and toyed with the idea of using apple cider vinegar instead of white, but decided against it. By the way, in keeping with my family's tradition, I marinated the turkey for 3 days.  The sauce was the best gravy mixture I've had with turkey.  I blended the drippings with the creme fraiche mixture and it didn't require additional salt or pepper.  Easiest turkey I ever made!  Thank you so much for making my life easier.  You have great taste, Chef John!

I generally hate thanksgiving turkey no matter roasted, smoked, or fried. However this is far and beyond the best I've ever had. I've made it three years in a row for friendsgiving and there are never any leftovers which sucks because we always want more.

I made this recipe along with the bourbon glazed carrots and the lemon pepper potatoes for Christmas, served alongside traditional Newfoundland pease pudding as well as turnip, cabbage and salt beef.
I made a turkey soup using the left overs from this recipe, which was probably the best I've made.

I rarely give 5 stars for recipes, but I think just the flavours alone  in this one deserves the rating.  It closely reminds me of the yummy Peruvian roast chicken I ate at Chicken and Guns in a food pod in Portland, Oregon.  applied half the recipe for the spice rub  (processed in my little food chopper) on a 5+lb chicken that I split (removed the backbone), did not let it sit to soak in  the flavouring (didn’t have time) and baked it at 350’F for about an hour or when juices run clear at the thigh joint.  The chicken was juicy and full of flavour.  I am definitely going to try this recipe on a  small turkey, like it was meant to be.  This recipe is a keeper!

Great recipe. My in-laws are of Japanese-Peruvian descent and I make a variation of my father in law’s recipe for the meat stuffing and turkey every year. This is an easier and just as good version.

Lots of flavor. I really enjoyed this, not the usual boring turkey I am use to. I will make this again. I had to substitute in the creme fraiche, i couldn’t find any.  1 c. of heavy cream, 1/2 c. Sour mix together and allow to set over night. 

I also used diced green chilies instead of the jalapeños I have people in my house that does not jay spice. They did like this recipe.

This is one of the most amazing turkey recipes I've ever tried.  This Thanksgiving will be the 4th time I'm making this.  It's become a family tradition.  Unique flavors, super juicy and that gravy is to die for.

With the spicy sauce it was quite  good - somewhat bland otherwise, but will likely try another style of turkey next year.

Delicious!! The flavors are so robust and go perfectly together. I used a little extra oil to make sure the turkey was moist.  I also made sure to put plenty of the rub mixture under the skin.

Wow, that was good and the gravy was excellent! I thought all the seasonings might kill it, but noooo it was great. After cooking everything,  I mixed and warmed every one of the drippings and sauces together to make a wonderful gravy.

Tried it today (thanksgiving day) on an 8 lbs. bird. This is my second turkey.  According to all those in attendance this is the "best and juiciest turkey they have ever had". Thank you Chef John in making me a hero haha.

The rub interestingly came out a bit runnier than in the video, and since I only have an 8 lb bird I have a small jar leftover, guess I'll rub it on a chicken next time :) thank you again for the recipe.

I cut this down and used it for Cornish game hens. It was fantastic.  The sauce was nearly perfect.

Excellent recipe for Turkey,  best Christmas Turkey I've ever had.  Even though it's different to normal turkeys it was far better whilst still having a turkey flavour. 

I brined my Turkey the night before in vegetable broth with a cup of salt and ice water in the morning dried off and stuffed it with a sausage,bread,etc.. Mix.   

Keep a cup of the brine for the sauce.

For the final part of the roast not mentioned in the recipe I ended up leaving it in for another hour as it was stuffed then I removed the stuffing and 30min later the auto thermometer had popped out. 

The breast was perfectly moist and the leg meat was falling off the bone. Perfect. 

I recommend making the sauce /gravy too,  it's brilliant with a little spiciness.
