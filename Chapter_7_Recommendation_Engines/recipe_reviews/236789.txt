Horray!  A home run!  I had a jar of Ragu Cheese Sauce flavor to use up and came across this recipe.  My suggestion would be to stir up all the ingredients expect for the biscuits, then add those in last.  I did it as described and the biscuits kind of clumped up and it was hard to mix in the other ingredients.  I had to modify because I didn't have some of the ingredients and it was still great!   No bacon, cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella, onion powder, garlic powder, and just regular parmesan.  Yum!  Our family could have eaten 3 pans of it I think.

It was very good. I took bacon out of my dish and used just one can of whole wheat biscuits. The cheese and Alfredo was a excellent pair with the biscuits. Better than fettuccini Alfredo.

The taste was very good! The texture was "different".  A savory monkey bread is the best way I can describe it....  Still not sure if you should use a fork or fingers though.

It's good, althought it seems like it's missing something and I followed the recipe.  I'll probably try it again with sausage.

It was s hit with my family.  I the ingredients in a  large bowl. I then added the cut up biscuits.  I found it mixed better if done with bare hands. The biscuits seemed to bind together when I tried mixing with spoon or large rubber spatula. I added more onion and cheese to taste.

This was a hit with my family!!! I added some chunks of saut√©ed chicken breast, and extra cheese. I struggled with getting the doughs in the middle to cook thoroughly. I think next time, I will layer full biscuits on the bottom and top layers to help them cook fully.

This was delicious and a family favorite! I added double the cheese because I had some to use up and more cheese is never a bad thing.
