Delicious! I loosely doubled the recipe because that's the amount of chorizo I had left over. I did add garlic because, well, that's just what I do. It was a great side for roast chicken, quite a perky change.

I thought this was a good recipe, I tried it as is and it was good. I tried it a second time and added garlic and green onions and really liked it.
