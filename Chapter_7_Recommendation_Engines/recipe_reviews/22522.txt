Yummy, yummy, yummy!  Very hard to go wrong with these simple instructions.  I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon for additional spice.  Also, adjusted the temperature down to 325 after 40 minutes to keep the crust from getting too dark!  Definitely a keeper.

I doubled this recipe and made three REALLY full pies, and had a little filling left over. I assumed, like most pie recipes, this would not make full pies, I was wrong, this recipe produces generously filled pies! Other than that, I BAKED the potatoes instead of boiling them (I peeled the whole baked potatoes after they had cooled halfway), I added a few dashes of cinnimon and a dash of ginger, plus about an extra 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and reduced the sugar (I used 3 cups of sugar for a DOUBLED recipe). I wish I would have reduced the eggs, this turned out to be much fluffier than I wanted. I wanted a denser, more custard-like pie (like pumpkin pie), and this recipe made a light, fluffy pie. It is a good basic recipe though, and I feel I can work with it until I arrive at the type of pie I want, by reducing the eggs, using half brown sugar next time (in the same reduced amount), and by adding more spices, maybe even some allspice. I also cooked the three pies at 325 degrees for one hour on the second oven rack down from the top (so the pies were closer to the top of the oven), and they came out beautiful, the crust did not get too dark, and they were lightly browned on top, just like I like them.

I added more milk and some cinnamon and it came out just like my mom's!
Also... If you run your potatoes through a ricer you won't get any lumps or strings in your pies.

This was my first time making a sweet potato pie. It was fabulous. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Also didn't wait for potatoes to cool and blended it in the blender. I think this will be a family favorite. Thanks.

These pie recipes are basic to mine, which wash handed down from my mother. However, she always (as I do) felt that eggs made the greatest difference in whether the filling was tight or creamy and smooth. So I would use more eggs than is asked for in these recipes particularly if baking in large quanties per pie. I average 8 - 10 or pies at each baking, and can use nearly a dozen eggs or more in my batch of mix.

This was my VERY first time making a sweet potato pie and I sure am proud of myself.  Thanks to the person who submitted this recipe. I did alter it a bit but it came out PERFECT!!!  I added lemon juice, nutmeg and cinnamon.  It reminds me of my grandmothers good Southern Sweet Potato Pie.  No holiday is complete without it. 
This was very simple to make.

Way too sweet! This took away from the spices. Next time I will cut sugar in half. Also too many eggs, it came out airy and fluffy. Overall this was like eating spice cotton candy (not quite but almost)I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon as suggested but next time it will omit the cinnamon, use half sugar and 2 eggs. This recipe has potential but you must tweek it. 

UPDATE: After making it the first time as the recipe stated, I still believe it was too sweet, however my husband loved it this way. When I wrote this rating I ate a piece right after it came out of the oven. But the next day after it had time to settle, it wasn't as fluffy and airy. I made it a second time with less sugar about 2 cups and 3 eggs, 1/4th cinnamon and evaporated milk and it was PERFECT. When it has time to settle its wonderful!! So I take back what I said and give it 5 stars with some tweeking.

This recipe is excellent!  The only adjustment I made was to reduce the vanilla extract to 1/2 tablespoon and I added 1/2 tablespoon of orange extract.  The recipe should also note that the size of the sweet potatoes will determine how much filling you end up with.  If you use 3, make sure they're medium to small in size.

Being from GA I had never had a pumpkin pie!  It was always Sweet Potato that my family made for the holidays.  I had been wanting one for some time now.  My husband's family is from KY - Pumpkin was it and I never got SP.  So I decided it was time to try to make one like I had as a child.  Store bought have way too much spice and just didn't do it for me.  This pie was very close to what I remember.  Recipe calls for 3 sweet potatoes.  Sweet potatoes come in all sizes and shapes.  I wish that it had stated how many cups.  I ended up with 4 cups of potatoes.  I only used 2 cup of sugar and that was plenty, any more and I think it would have been too sweet, as some people have said in their review.  I did not have nutmeg, so on one pie I sprinkled a little cinnamon.  Both were good with and without it.  Other than a little less sugar the only thing that I would change would be to add maybe 1 teaspoon of salt to the mixture, other than that it is a good recipe that I am keeping.  Oh, and I started checking it at 45 min.s so I did not burn it.  The pies were ready at 50 min.s but ovens cook differently.  I start checking though at 45 min.s.

I loved this sweet potatoe pie however I did some things a little different I used 6 large sweet potatoe and baked 45 min cooled them and pealed and mashed I used 1 1/2 c of Splenda in place of white sugar I used 1/2 c of regular brown sugar 1/4 tsp cinnamon as well as nutmeg I used the rest of the original recipe. this was a great hit it was not real sweet I also topped with coolwhip I give it 5 STAR this is great if you have to watch you sugar intake. This amount made 2 pies

Had a bit of a menu malfunction the day before Thanksgiving. I had planned to use up an old can of pumpkin, for a pie, and it was ruined. Had a big  29 oz. can of new Bruces Yams for a casserole but most years I get lazy and never make the casserole or get the marshmallows and pecans bit together anyway, opting for a little butter and brown sugar on the naked yams. I decided to forgo my lackluster yams with dinner (all the other stuff would be plenty anyway) and use them for this pie. Never had it until I moved south, but I found I do like SP pie better than pumpkin anyway. (Sorry, lifelong comfort food friend but you’re history.) This made a very full deep dish pie with not enough left for another regular shallow pie. Cook time was fine with the deep pie so watch shallow ones from burning. Beware it is pretty sweet and I used only 1 cup white and ½ cup brown sugar. Hubby loved it that way. I think it’s the first SP pie I ever actually made and didn’t buy from the store. Texture is not as smooth as store bought but flavor is outstandingly homemade.

Absolutely awesome!  Even some who don't normally like sweet potato pie like this recipe.  Instead of 2 1/2 cups of white sugar, I used 2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also add 1 tsp. of cinammon.  I bake for 40 minutes at 350, then turn the oven down to 300, cover the crust with aluminum foil and continue for another 30 minutes.  This prevents the crust from getting too dark. I use ready-made graham cracker crust.

I LOVED IT!!! First time making sweet potato pie. I couldn't stop eating the batter it was sooooo good. 

I may have accidently added more vanilla extract than what was called. I also read from another review to add ground cinnamon and extra milk so i did that to. Im soooo excited about this dish and can't wait to share it with friends and family. I defiantly recommend this recipe.

This was good but I agree that saying three sweet potatoes wasn't an acurate measurement because they vary in size; I also used canned sweet potatoes so it was harder to figure out.   I'd say I used about 2 cups.

Great pie, but I revised the recipe a little.  After reading the other reviews I reduced the white sugar to 1 3/4 cups and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I used 2 eggs instead of 4 and used condensed milk instead of evaporated.  I added cinnamon to taste and also added a splash of lemon flavor.  Delicious!

Maybe it was the natural sweetness in the sweet potatoes I used, but we found this recipe too sweet. I will try it next time with half the sugar.

Great and easy to make... I recommend using canned sweet potatoes (15oz); instead of peeling and boiling your own.

I would like to say, that I have never made a pie in my whole lifetime. I am 45 yrs of age. My good friend was saying that he likes sweet potato pie and can't stand pumpkin pie. So I decided to try and bake a sweet potato pie for him. As it turned out, this recipe was wonderful. It was simple to make and he said it tasted great. I would like to thank you for the recipe and would suggest this recipe to everyone that would be interested making a sweet potato pie.

This pie is truly delicious. I also added the cinnamon just because we love it.
The pie was a huge hit and I'm glad I made it :)

This was my first time making a sweet potatoe pie since my mom has been gone. I only made one in the year of 2008 for Thanksgiving and in that same year right before Christmas my mom passed away. So for me trying out this recipe for the first time, I got so many good ratings. My co-workers want me to bake one for them. This was truly a quick and easy recipe.. "THE PIE WAS SOOOO GOOD"

I made three pies and a custard by doubling the recipe and cooking the forth in a glass dish for my gluten free friends. My boss said it was the most delicious pie he had ever eaten and my friend said she'd kill me if I didn't give her the recipe.

My rating is a four star because of the evaporated milk. I could taste it with/over the sweet potatoes. It added a rich/caramelly touch which I thought was really nice but detracted from the sweet potatoes. I would have given it three stars, as a good recipe, but the rave reviews pushed it up.

For alterations, I did half white, half brown sugar and topped one with marshmallow. I also used my own spice blend and upped the spices, as milk products mute the flavour of pumpkin pie spice. I also used orange sweet potatoes, but I'm keen to try it with purple, as I have had good success with purple candied yams.

I wasn't expecting that this being my first time making a sweet potato pie that it was going to taste so good.  I would probably cut the sugar down by 1/2 cup but this recipe is a keeper. Tastes like memories.

I had to make 4 sweet potato pies and had never made them before.  Following this recipe was so easy and they came out just beautiful!  I reduced the sugar to 2 cups.  I followed the recipe on everything else.  Everyone loved them.  I'll use this one again and again.  THANKS for a great recipe!

used evaporated milk instead of condensed.  Used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg (didn't have nutmeg on hand).  Had to bake for an additional 15 minutes, because pie wasn't fully baked.  
Only complaint is that pie turned out way too sweet.

This recipe is just like my grandmother's recipe with a few exceptions.  The only difference is we reduce the temp to 300 degrees and bake an extra 20 minutes so the crust can be pretty and brown. Also we put two eggs instead of four. Another idea, use real butter and real vanilla extract.  The pies will be out of this world.  If you want a pretty crust but want to cook the pie in less time, use a pie shield or put foil around the crust.  Great recipe though!!!

This pie is very good.  I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and lemon juice for a little extra flavor.  Also, I used a Marie Callender pie crust, excellent.  This recipe is a keeper.  It was sooooo good.

This was a delicious pie but it does not need all that sugar. Sweet potatos are already sweet. I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet.

This pie is divine. I have been known to eat 4 slices in a row. I halved the sugar quantity, and used half white and half dark brown sugar, and it was still more than sweet enough. That was the only alteration I made, and it came out perfect!

My kids ate two pies in two days. I absolutely LOVE this easy and tasty recipe. I added a cup of cool whip to make it fluffy (and a little sweeter so next time I'll use less sugar), but this is definitely a hit!!!!

Turned out great. Much creamier and not so dry as the previous recipe I tried. I did bake my potatoes and then peeled... I did add a little cinnamon and I added a few more potatoes as the ones I used were not large enough to get the pie filled adequately. My only advice would be to use BIG potatoes or use 2 for 1 if you don't have any large ones.

Wonderful recipe, I am from the south and was very nervous about fixing this particular pie since my mom has done it for years! It was a big hit and everyone loved it. I love this website, it has changed my attitude towards cooking. If you havent joined you are missing out!

I made this pie 3 Thanksgiving ago and I been hooked since. I'll sometimes add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. I also in the past have reduced the white sugar to 2 cups instead of 2 1/2 cups. Either way, both recipes modified or not taste delicious! Don't worry on doubling the recipe. This fills 3 pie shells (depending how large sweet potatoes you buy).

Delicious recipe! I don't know if I used the right size pie crust, but i ended up making 4 pies.  Thank goodness I had extra pie shells in my freezer.  But very easy and the family loves it!

OK, please use this recipe. I always follow people suggestions. So I only used 3 eggs and 2 cups of sugar. It still is a little so sweet so next time I will use 1 1/2 cups of sugar. I also added cinnamon. GREAT! I WILL use this for Thanksgiving!

I served this recipe for 7 deer hunters this season.  They loved it!  I did make two pies.  One with the exact recipe, and one with half sugar, no vanilla and tablespoon of cinnomon.  I prefered less sugar.  The hunters ate up both pies before heading to bed to get up early again!

I only had condensed milk in my kitchen so I used that instead and boy did it turn out sweet. If I were to do this again, I would definitely use the evaporated milk and cut the white sugar in half, and add a bit of brown sugar. In general, it was very good but very sweet.

If you like pumpkin pie, you will love this recipe. This is by far the best and easiest sweet potato pie. This is the 2nd year that I have made this...and it is quickly turning into a family tradition. I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp of ground cloves....Yummy!

I use to like sweet potato pie.  This rescript made me LOVE this pie.  I have to make it sometimes too frequent.  I asked my friend what to you want me to bring?  My soup?  My cake?  she said:  "The Sweet Potato Pie."  I've had a perso tell me:  "This is better than Patti's sweet potato pie."  I love her (Patti) .  I  just add lemon (1/2) squeezed, I double the flavoring an add 1/4 teaspoon of ginger.  It taste like Christmas!  I know I wasn't suppose to change this but you tweak it an it may help someone and this is how I started it a great recipe!

Enjoyed this recipe after I made some minor alterations. First 3 sweet potatoes equals about 4 cups. For those who need to measure.  I also increased my nutmeg to 3/4 teaspoon to add additional flavor.  With those minor adjustments it made it perfect for my family.

Good recipe. I would add some light brown sugar about 1/4 cup; it gives it a more "soulful" taste. All in all, everything was good!

This is my go to every year. I get more compliment and that makes me very happy. I buy the deep dish pie shells and use 6 large potatoes, as I like a full pie. I add 1/2 t. of cinnamon and the taste never disappoints.

I made this for my first Christmas (just passed) with my new in-laws.  My husband had never had sweet potato pie and was hesitant to try it, but once he did he loved it.  My new mother and father-in-law each had a piece and they really loved it! I like the fact that it's not as heavy as a pumpkin pie; my mother-in-law had never had it either and said it had a "good flavour".  It does make two really full pies and I had filling left over.  I saved it to make some tarts with, so there's no waste.  (BTW: My dogs LOVE sweet potatos and one was trying to eat the peels as I made these pies! So, I boiled two extra potatos and mashed them with their skins on to feed to the dogs.  I give them a spoonful in their kibble. They just inhale it! Another way I've cooked sweet potatos for them is to cut them up and boil them in chicken broth with cut up cabbage.  They just go crazy for it!)

All I can say is wow!!! This recipe is very similar to my family's recipe,except there was no need for tweaking. I did add 1 TSP lemon juice for an extra kick. The pie was gone in 10mins!!!!!!!!!!!

It was easy to make and my Bfriend from the south said it was the best he ever had. I tweaked it a little. I used 1 yam in place of a sweet potatoe and substitued 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp allspice for the nutmeg bc that is all I had available. I cut the vanilla to 1 tsp and halved the sugar. Then put a thin layer of chopped candied walnuts on top. Next time I think i will add even a little less sugar.

This recipe is so amazingly easy!!! The only change I made is like everyone else I added a little cinnamon to the mixture. But I also changed the sugar amount. I have a lot of diabetics in my family so I do one cup of sugar and half cup of brown sugar. It’s still super delicious!!!

I would make again. 

But I recall my Grandma’s pies being darker.  Does anyone have a suggestion to make the filling darker? I already  increased the nutmeg to 1 teaspoon and added a pinch of cinnamon.

Delicious! I may try baking the sweet potatoes next time I make this. I would add more spices to it as well but overall a very delicious pie and came out better than I thought considering it was my first time ever making a sweet potato pie!

I made this today.  I cut that sugar way down to one packed cup of brown sugar. It was more than sweet enough. Added cloves. I also blended in my Vitamix. Very smooth. Will make again.

I add a Tsp of lemon extract (this brings out the favor of the potato) and I had a small bottle of Jack Daniels to the batter.  Don't worry the alcohol cooks out and you are left an amazing pie.

Great recipe, as many others I made some small adjustments, 2 large potatoes, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon with sugar and 1/3 light brown sugar.  Pretty Close to Grandmas pie!??

The pie baked well it firmed up when I cut into the pie it didn't run.  I added cinnamon 1/2 tsp.  The next time I make this pie maybe I use less milk.  I served the pie warm with Vanilla Ice cream.

I REALLY wish people would give units of measure! Seriously folks - last I checked sweet potatoes were not manufactured to a specific size or weight. Ah, the glory of mother nature!

This was my first sweet potato pie and we all loved it!  Very quick and easy and delicious.  I followed other's advice and reduced the sugar.  I used about 1 3/4 cup instead of 2 1/2.  It was plenty sweet - can't imagine it sweeter.  Also added cinnamon.

I combined this recipe with the Crumb Topping for Pies recipe from this site. I was afraid it would be too sweet but I forgot the sugar for the filling and it turned out perfect. I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and used a shortbread crust. I topped the 2 pies with the crumb topping and stuck them in the oven for 30 minutes, then I topped them with marshmallows and cooked for another 10 minutes.

The result was the best sweet potato pie that my sister-in-law and I had ever tasted!

The first time I tried this recipe I made three pies at one time. I was nervous because it was last year Thanksgiving and this was the only dessert. It turned out PERFECT! Everybody didn't believe that I had made these pies. This recipe was easy and I can't see how anyone could go wrong! Thanks.

I found this recipe easy to follow, especially for a total NOVICE like myself, and I was enjoying my own pies.  It's hard to create a favorite so far away from home, but I did it all by myself!!

This was my first time baking a sweet potato pie. I was a little afraid to serve it to anyone else. However, it was easy to make and we all liked it. Thanks for sharing.

This was an outstanding recipe.  Instead of using the exact amount of nutmeg I did a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cinnimon, real butter a little more milk.

I've seen my mother cook, and decided that I wanted to try it. I'm not into baking a whole lot, but I'm from the South and was wanting something from there. It came out great! My stepchildren also like it a lot. They like it better than pumpkin pie, which I don't like at all.

I think this is an acquired taste.  It turned out beautifully but, not my sorta taste.
