My husband and I enjoyed these very much.  I only used 1 lb of chicken since it was just 2 of us but used the full amt of sauce. I doubled the hot sauce and reduced the chicken stock by the same amount so I ended up with 1 cup of liquid. That was the perfect amount of heat for us but I would build up to it if you don't care for a good amount of spicy. I find buffalo chicken dip can be too rich with all the cream cheese but this recipe incorporated it perfectly; enough to taste it but not overwhelming.  Thanks for the keeper!

I loved this recipe! The only problem I had was that it wasn't spicy enough! so for those of you who like it a little spicier, double the hot sauce! other than that i absolutely loved this recipe! I will definitely make it in the future!!!!

Made these for my boyfriend and I a couple nights ago and we were pleasantly surprised! Didn't know what to expect, as we never really make ground chicken or sloppy joes. I more than doubled the hot sauce because, as many people have said, it wasn't spicy enough as is. Also left off the bleu cheese. One thing I'd highly recommend: Make sure you serve with sturdy hamburger buns. Ours were just the store brand and they did not hold up!

Great yummy recipe. I left out the red wine vinegar and only used Monterey Jack Cheese. I made mine into a wrap. Will make again.

I thought this was very good and will be making it again. If you like buffalo chicken dip, you will enjoy this recipe!
Here were my changes: Was not spicy enough as written, so I probably more than doubled the buffalo sauce (just added to taste until it was as spicy as I wanted). I only used 1 Tbsp red wine vinegar, and I doubt the recipe needs that at all. Only added 4 oz shredded cheddar and added some nacho cheese sauce I had on hand. The mixture was liquidy after cooking, so I added a bit of flour to thicken it and let it sit simmering for 20 minutes which helped. I served this on thick TOASTED bread (I liked the textural addition of something crunchy).

Also works great on pasta!  I boiled macaroni and black beans, drained and then put this mixture on top.  Love it!  Quick and easy hot meal that I can get on the table for my family in less than 30 minutes when I get home from work.

This is really good, with a few minor changes... and I think I like it more as a warm dip than a sandwich.  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used what I had on hand, roasted garlic vinegar.  I was also out of brown sugar so substituted white sugar.  I cut the cheddar cheese in half as I'm attempting to limit my cheese intake.  It turned out Amazing!  I served it as a dip with slices of celery and it was eaten up in no time at a football party. Some people enjoyed it with Tostitos Scoops.

This was a crowd pleaser for sure.  Made a batch on Sunday and we have been eating the leftovers ever since.  Today I warmed about a half cup up in the microwave, then mixed it with tortilla chips, salsa, lettuce, and guacamole for a delicious salad.  Restaurant quality.  Will make this again.  I used the whole eight-ounce package of cream cheese (instead of six) just to use it up.

I am so happy to find a recipe that uses ground chicken! The sauce was good but not very spicy. Next time I will add more buffalo wing sauce. I omitted the cheddar cheese because I didn't want it to be too cheesy flavored. After topping it with the blue cheese crumbles, I also sprinkled French-fried onions on top to give it a nice crunch. Yum! Thanks for the recipe.

I agree with everyone that the recipe needs significantly more hot sauce.  I didn't worry about reducing the broth because I let it simmer and reduce for a while.  We are definitely fans.  I threw in some ranch in lieu of the blue cheese.  we also like a little celery in as well.  4 stars only because you have to change it up a little to make it work for the masses.

Followed this to a tee- one of few times. It was Verrrry good. I liked that it began moderately spiced for the more timid souls present, but hot sauce/bleu cheese could be added for those of us who like it zippier and don't care who we breathe on!

i followed this recipe exactly, i was beyond disappointed, it tasted like you were eating tasteless cheese; it was a waste of my time; the neufechtal cheese and cheddar cheese ruined it.

Very yum. Used cream cheese in place of the Neufchatel, turkey mince instead of chicken, and veggie stock instead of chicken stock. Certainly a repeat!

This is a great base recipe. I added a LOT more buffalo sauce and didn't add any cheddar. I think that would ruin the taste of it. I also added a little blue cheese dressing to the mix. I also only added  1 T of the brown sugar, think it would be too sweet to add all of it.

Was looking for a way to use ground chicken, and I'm a huge fan of buffalo chicken dip so this recipe caught my attention. I'm really enjoying it and will definitely be making it again.  My neighbor stopped in just after I made it and wanted to know what I had been cooking - she said it smelled delicious.    

I did use only a pound of ground chicken (I live alone and don't need huge quantities at any one time), but followed others suggestions about using the full quantity of hot sauce in a half recipe.  I also threw in a bit more cheddar cheese.  Very nice flavors.  Reheats nicely in the microwave for single servings too.

We love chicken wings but not the fat and calories so thought we wold try what I presume is a considerbly less fat/caloric recipe.  We made it for the second time camping this past weekend.  YUMMY!!!  Didn't have the brown sugar or the cream cheese.  Used some shredded Mexican cheese instead.  Also put them in tortilla wraps instead of the bun.  WE LOVE this recipe.  This is definitely our new "go to" recipe when we need a chicken wing fix!!

Thanks for posting the recipe, my whole family enjoyed it! Even my twin 3 1/2 year olds liked it. Made a few changes,instead of Red hot I used Buffalo wing sauce from my bar recipe omitted the chicken broth and it had the perfect amount of sauce for sloppy joe's. Will definitely make again.

Great take on sloppy joes.  I used the entire package 8oz of Neufchatel cheese because I knew it would go to waste in my refrigerator if I didn't use it all and added another splash of red wine vinegar because I love it.  This was very tasty and a keeper.  Will definitely make this again.

This was tasty, quick, and easy. I like that it gives me a new way to use my ground chicken that I wouldn’t have thought of. I made the recipe as-is but with 1 lb of chicken because that’s all I had. I found the sauce just enough for 1lb so I will double when using 2 lb. Also, the flavor didn’t have enough kick for my taste so I’ll be increasing the buffalo sauce next time and reducing the chicken stock. For these couple of reasons I went with a 4 instead of 5 stars.

Delicious! I only had 1 lb of chicken, but I kept the same amt of sauce ingredients.  Changed a couple of things because of what I had.  Used a whole cup of chicken broth and subbed in Sambal Oelek for the hot sauce, used reg cream cheese and served it over rotini pasta - loved it!

These were absolutely phenomenal!! My boyfriend pointed at his plate and said, "Okay...from now on, these are our sloppy joes." I take it he approved as well :)  They taste like sloppy joes but with a buffalo kick! I topped mine with lettuce and ranch.  We even tried these in a tortilla shell, definitely recommend that!  I subbed cream cheese for the Neufchatel as I couldn't find any at the store! I only used 1 lb of chicken as I was only cooking for 2, but used the same amount of sauce.  I added a generous helping of buffalo sauce (maybe 3/4 cup instead of just 1/4 cup) and let the mixture simmer until the meat had soaked up the sauce, about 30 minutes. Will definitely be added into my cookbook and meal rotation!!! Thanks for the amazing recipe.

Really thought the idea of buffalo chicken flavored sloppy joes sounded like so much fun although I wasn't sure about the Neufchatel cheese or the cheddar.  After reading all the reviews I ended up using about 2oz of cream cheese and 1 cup of shredded pepper jack and increasing  the hot sauce to taste.  We really enjoyed this flavor of these and they were fun,  but we're unlikely to make again as I have a pulled chicken recipe with a similar flavor profile that is more budget friendly.

I had to go a little light on the buffalo sauce for the lightweight in my home, but  he thought it was good that way. I added buffalo sauce directly to my sandwich and thought it tasted really good.

I found this looking for recipes using ground chicken and I'm so glad I did!  After reading some of the previous reviews, I made a few changes.  I only had one pound of chicken but I didn't completely halve the sauce.  Now I wish I had because it was more like a dip than a sloppy joe.  I did halve the buffalo sauce and it was plenty hot enough.  I added chopped celery and carrot in with the onion to reinforce the chicken wing experience and to add more veggies.  I did not add as much cheddar as recommended, probably more like 3-4 ounces.  To eat, I toasted the buns, sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles, then topped with the sloppy joe mixture.  Open face sandwiches.  This was delicious!  Thanks!

Not too bad! Cut the meat to 1lb but left the sauce at the full recipe. I think it might have been try otherwise. Cut the cream cheese to 4ounces. They were not overly 'buffalo' as I was afraid they might be.it was just the right amount of buffalo flavor. Probably wont be a staple in our house - but, something good to switch things up every now and then.

I basically combined two recipes - from the other recipe I added one medium carrot and two celery stalks diced small and one 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  I only used 1/2 cup reduced sodium chicken broth.  I only used 4 ounces of the cream cheese and about 4 ounces of the cheddar cheese.  I did double the hot sauce and added more until zippy enough for our tastes.  I cooked the ground meat, onions, celery and carrots until vegetables were tender and meat was browned.  Then I added the liquids and cooked down the liquids before adding the cheeses.  I was not too soupy due to reducing it first.  I served on buns with blue cheese crumbles, blue cheese and ranch dressing, hot sauce and shredded cheddar cheese for people to add per their personal preferences.  I could also see adding all 8 ounces of cream cheese and all the cheddar and serving it as a dip (without adding the tomato sauce).  I did use ground turkey since that is what I already had on hand.  I did not use the oil and I did not add salt.  It tasted great and was a way of having the buffalo flavor without cooking wings.
