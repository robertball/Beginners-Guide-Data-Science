I used roasted chicken and homemade chicken broth in this recipe instead of roast turkey and turkey stock. Instead of making stuffing according to package, I sprinkled the dry stuffing mix over the casserole ingredients, drizzled melted butter over the top and then baked it to warm it through and crisp the "topping". We LOVED this casserole, even the kids. There's just enough for two small Tupperware containers full for both my husband and I tomorrow. I served this with a raw veggie platter.

Excellent recipe, I didn't have any fresh mushrooms so substituted a can of corn with the green beens, delicious, and a great way to use up all of my turkey and stuffing!  Thank you!

This one was good-I used cornbread boxed stuffing for the topping, since that is what my husband prefers.

We loved this recipe! Instead of using the green beans, onions and mushrooms that the recipe called for, I used my leftover green bean casserole. This was a tasty way to use up leftovers!
