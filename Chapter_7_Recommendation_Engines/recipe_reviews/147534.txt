The recipe was fantastic!  You wouldn't think that the ingredients would taste good together but somehow it works.  I would caution anyone making this to use only a few small pieces of the peper because I only used about a fourth of one piece and could still feel the heat-and I like spicy foods.

This was yummy and everyone loved it. I did cook it a little too long and it was very loose but I just let it sit another minute and it was fine. I also only used a half a pepper since not everyone likes a lot of spicy.

After tasting as written I decided that it need a little more so I added more of the mustard and a good shake of season salt and that did the trick. I'm not exactly sure how or why but hubby and I both agreed that the dip had a deep roasted garlic flavor  to it even though there is no garlic in the recipe. This works well with plain potato chips too.

I doubled the jalapeno and thinned with milk to a more dippable consistency and served with tortilla chips.  I really enjoyed the green jalapeno flavor but my BF refused to eat it a second time.
