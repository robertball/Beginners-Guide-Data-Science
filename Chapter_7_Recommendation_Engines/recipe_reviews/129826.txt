I love the sweetened condensed milk version of fudge. This is a great variation and yields a fudge with a very nice consistency. The only thing I changed was to add a 1/2 tsp of almond extract. Good stuff!

This is a nice change from regular chocolate fudge.I did tinker with it a bit though. Instead of almonds I used finely chopped pecans, and in place of dried cranberries I subbed in dried cherries. The orange zest was a surprise to me, but the brightness of the citrus cuts the heaviness of the white chocolate! YUM!

This is hands-down my new favorite fudge! I made it several time for family and friend get-togethers over the holidays, and everyone raved over it. The tart cranberries (especially if you use unsweetened dried cranberries) go perfectly with the sweet white chocolate, and the almonds add a great crunch. The red and white look so festive and Christmasy together, they really add some pizazz to the dessert table at any function.  Everyone I have made this for raved over them, and you won't believe how easy it is to prepare! Will definitely be making again!
