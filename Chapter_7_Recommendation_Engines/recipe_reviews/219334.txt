This is a favorite to make with my two boys. Any baking bits will do, if you don't care for Heath bars. It's super simple and never fails to disappear.

These were so easy.  I used crunchy peanut butter instead of toffee.  I made this for my work team for our Christmas dinner.  So easy and fast.  Will for sure make again for parties.

I had something similar many years ago.  Love the toffee bits, and added a bit of mixed nuts .  Think my grandkids will love them.

So quick and easy... definitely my new best recipe to take to coffee hour at church! I did change it a little. I used a mix of peanut butter chips/butterscotch chips and chocolate chips. I also did not use peanuts as I used crunchy peanut butter! Hmmmm good! ~ Noreen

Didn't have heath baking bits, so I used 1 1/2 cups semi sweet chocolate chips and chunky peanut butter. Addictive!
