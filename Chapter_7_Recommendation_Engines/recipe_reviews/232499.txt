Robin, your recipe was absolutely wonderful and received rave reviews this Easter.  I followed the recipe pretty closely with just a couple of exceptions, steamed asparagus instead of boiling and used honey in place of agave, and just a little more than the recipe called for.  I marinated this overnight, turning the bag every so often.  It was delicious.  A great spring/summer side and I'll use this many more times.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

this is what happened after I made it according to directions and allowing it to marinade @5 hours. my wife had to wolf down 5 just to ,"make sure it's spiced correctly."  I loved watching her, lol. I do believe it does need more vinegar and more heat. dang fine recipe as is!

This was  really tasty.  Cooked asparagus for only one minute and that was plenty (stalks were very thin).   Increased sesame oil to 2 t. and used 1/2 t. of Mongolian Fire Oil for the red pepper flakes.  Marinated and kept turning in a plastic zip bag.

Less than a minute in the boiling water if you are using baby asparagus to keep a little crunch.  Delicious - great for parties.

This is a great summer side, because it is delicious cold.  We really liked the crunch of barely-cooked asparagus.  I cooked mine for 3 minutes in the microwave with very little water.  When I make this again, I will use low-sodium soy, since it was a bit salty for us, even with no added salt.  My only tweak was to use about a teaspoon of Sriracha, instead of the pepper flakes.  Yummy, and thanks!
