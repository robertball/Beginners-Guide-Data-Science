These were really good!  A keeper of a recipe!  The only real change one should make is to use red potatoes and not white.  Red potatoes (skin on) hold their consistency better and don't turn to mush as quickly.  Next time I will make this for breakfast with scrambled eggs.  By the way, I posted 3 photos, a before, during and after.

These just came out of the oven! WOW! Delicious. I added a bit more creole seasoning, sprinkled on some cayenne pepper and parsley flakes, and left out the sausage. My creole seasoning is not very salty, so I added a dash of salt (very little!).   For those who alter this recipe severely (like using hot dogs instead of sausage ???), ewww, please do not give this recipe a poor rating. This recipe is awesome and it is not the recipe creator's fault that you added the incorrect ingredients and made it taste bad.   This is so, so good! Thank you.

I made this recipe omitting the peppers and adding 3 cloves of minced garlic.  I also used vegetarian sausage.  The potatoes were crispy and very flavorful.  I will definatley make this again.

I love anything with Creole seasoning, and this recipe didn't disappoint. We can't get andouille sausage here in Canada, so I used a couple of smokies that I halved and cut into thirds. My husband and I had this as a main dish with a side of creamed corn and garlic bread. The blend of spices was perfect.

big hit - i had fresh andouille sausage and wasn't sure if i was supposed to brown it first or not - i put in a skillet for a bit, but not quite until browned.  worked great.  i wasn't able to slice the sausage either, but it mixed in really well w/ the potatoes as crumbled sausage and had a great kick to it.  used the spices as ordered.  left out the bell peppers

Love it.  I had orange and red bell peppers so they (along with the onion) got cut into bite size pieces.

not bad - very good blend of seasonings and spices.  I boiled the sausage with the potatoes, but still think the potatoes could have stood to be a bit more crispy.  Allover good, though, I will  make again.

Outstanding! Mine was very spicy but I think that was due to the Creole blend (Emril's) that I used! The only change I made was that I used the entire pepper and onion, which came to about 1 cup each.

I made this with 1 lb of andouille as it was prepackaged. It's a very good recipe if you enjoy spicy food. I You do need a certain amount of oil to get the potatoes crispy, but like one other reviewer, I found my andouille contained enough fat. I boiled them to defrost them, and as I sliced them, I noticed that. Now, I am not sure who really measures pepper, I just grind it on until it looks to my liking. I topped the dish with some kosher sea salt. I do think a garnish would have brightened up the color, perhaps cilantro or parsley.

Oh my, this was yummy! I loved the spiciness of this, but scale back if you prefer a mild flavor. Other than small changes based on preference (entire onion and green pepper) the only thing I changed was adding mushrooms.  Next time - and there will be one - will increase onion and pepper to perhaps 2 and add two cartons of mushrooms.  My husband even suggested including shrimp or crawfish. A good andouille sausage will also make all the difference.

I made this last night and really loved it.  I sliced the onion, orange pepper and red pepper and used smoked sausage.  Will fix this again.

Pretty  tasty!  I used half and onion and one whole pepper.  Mine was a little over spiced, but that's probably due to my creole seasoning, which is primarily salt.  Other than that (I'll just use less next time), this was awesome.

I love recipes that are easy to put together and you can just throw them in the oven and forget it . . . with the exception of stirring it a couple of times of course.  Add to that a delicious combination of ingredients and you have a fabulous meal.   I used andouille sausage that I had purchased directly from Meeting Place Pasture Farm that was exceptional.  This was easy and delicious.

I didn't think the seasoning had the effect it was supposed to. I tried this with hot dogs instead of sausage, it was ok.

Delicious just needs more seasoning. Goes well with pan fried/baked creole pork chops and a sweet Riesling like an Auslese.

The recipe turned out fine, although I'd prefer it with about half the amount of seasoning. The taste was just not to my personal liking.

Just had this for dinner tonight and the whole family  excluding my two youngest 4and 6, they don't
 Do spicy yet! Loved loved  this one. It was delicious. I added just a tad more of Cajun
 Seasoning  because my older 4 kids and Hubby loves it spicy. They all said make it again! SOON! Thank you Carina, super easy and fuss free for a busy night. I think that maybe this Sunday I will try the breakfast version before church.

I've made this several times - and added different veggies to make it a very well rounded, easy meal... yellow squash, asparagus, etc.

Little too salty but I believe it was the brand of seasoning that I used.  Over all delicious and even my 3 kiddos loved it!
