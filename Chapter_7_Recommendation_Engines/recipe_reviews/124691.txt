i don't give out many 5 stars but this dish is flavorful and easy. it's a wonderful dish to make with small children since it doesn't involve anything sharp or hot. also, add 1/4  teaspoon of peppermint oil when you add the vanilla and use an chocolate pie crust.

If you like chocolate ice cream, you'll love this pie.  It's so easy and makes a great impression.  I used a chocolate graham cracker crust and served it with whipped cream.  It was gone in no time!!!

This was delicious, I can't help but stop and take a bite every time I pass the fridge.  I made it with my 4 year old t she was so proud.  And loved the reaction of her mimi and papa when they tasted it.  This was very easy to make.  It was not too rich, it has a refreshing creamy taste.  I will definitely be making this again!!

For National Pie Day (jan 23) I made this pie for work and my co-workers thought it was yummy good!  The only problem is that it does start to melt after awhile!  Remember to keep it in the freezer if you don't eat it all at once.  So simple so try it!

My husband and I dislike cake, so I'm up to trying almost any new pie.  I made this for his birthday and it worked out so wonderfully.  It took virtually no time at all, and I put the filling in a pre-baked Oreo pie crust from the store.

This tasted great!

Yummy pie! Will definetly make again! Added more cocoa powder than called for, loved it! Next time I think I'll make it with an Oreo crust; not a big fan of the normal kind. Would be even better if topped with whipped cream and dark chocolate syrup! Thanks for the great recipe!

Yummy! Creamy, delicious and extra chocolatey! I only rated a 4 because of the crust. Traditional pie crust takes away from the chocolate flavor for me. I made a Twix crust instead.

Fillling is creamy & tasty.  Not something I would make to impress anyone, but good.  I recommend an oreo crust because the regular pie crust takes away from smooth chocolate flavor.

This was SO easy and SO delicious! It tastes like a fancy ice cream cake! My kids went crazy for it! I added 1/2 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips as a topping. I will definitely be making this again and again and again! Thanks!

This is a great frozen pie that doesn't involve the thawing, spreading, & layering hassles of making typical ice cream pies.  I served it in a chocolate graham shell, and it went as fast as the two other ice cream pies I made.  Delicious!

This is too easy to be so very good!  I coated an Oreo crust with seedless raspberry jam before filling with chocolate mixture.  Topped the whole thing with Cool Whip.  Very yummy!!!

This is an easy, delicious dessert that has become a staple in our home.  It is good with both a baked pie shell or a graham crust.  I sometimes make it a little fancier for guests by piping whipped cream on top with my star tip prior to freezing.  I get a request for this recipe from everyone who tastes it.

Great frozen pie... But I used 4 oz. of whipped topping and 4 oz. of vanilla ice cream in the pie.... And the same equal parts as a topping.

YUM!  We were licking the plate clean.  I made a graham cracker crust and it was fabulous!  We loved it so much, I had to make a second one for my mother in law.  (Cause she loved the first one so much!)

Love this pie!  So creamy and chocolatey! However, I froze this pie for eight hours as the recipe said and when I took it out of the freezer it was hard as a rock and we couldn't cut it even with a very big and sharpened knife.  Eight hours is too long!

I did a heaping 1/3 cup of cocoa, added some salt, and did 4 oz. cream cheese. I REALLY liked it. If you're planning on a fancy decadent dessert you will probably be disappointed, but for quick easy and a nice treat?? It was completely satisfying and enjoyable! I don't know if my changes made that much of a difference or not, but I was very pleased. ** I enjoyed the pie more when it was less than frozen (had been sitting out for a while, but not room temp.) Would serve out of the fridge next time instead of right out of the freezer. Thanks for an EASY and quite enjoyable dessert.

This pie tastes like it's made from rich chocolate ice cream! I've made it several times and it's always popular. It's also easy to vary it a little to suit your needs. When I make it for picky kids, I use a storebought Oreo crust. When I made it for my diabetic parents, I used a crust made of ground nuts (from a recipe also on this site) and used Splenda instead of sugar. I've been tempted to try a version with some mint flavoring added since I love chocolate mint stuff, but I haven't done it yet. You could also make it look a little fancier by adding syrups, chopped nuts, fruit--anything you might normally put on chocolate ice cream!

This was quite easy to make and delicious.  I substituted real heavy cream for the whipped topping and added the sugar and cocoa when it had soft peaks.  I added the milk and vanilla to the cream cheese then whipped everything together.  I think I may have lost some volume with this method.  I used an Oreo chocolate cookie crust.  And it looked a little empty.  Great flavor though!

Awesome! Even my youngest who isn't much of a chocolate lover (prefers lemon anything lol) LOVED it. It is a creamy delicious treat. We even used light versions of cool whip and cream cheese and it still tastes sooooo sinful!! I did skip the reg pie crust and used a Keebler graham cracker crumb crust. Also just mixed the choco chips in with the filling just because.......I will definitely be making this again and again. It was soooo quick and easy!

I used a chocolate pie crust, other than that I followed the recipe, which was so simple and quick.  My family all liked this pie.  It is a keeper.

I didn't care for this pie.  It had too much of a cream cheese flavor which made it tangy.  Oh and not a lot of chocolate flavor which I was looking for.

A winner! I had to have 2 pies for a dinner I was making, so I doubled the recipe, using a whole 8 oz. brick of cream cheese, and doubling the rest of the ingredients. I used graham cracker crusts, and they were so good. Creamy, cold, and the right amount of chocolate flavoring. If you don't use the pie all at once, do put the rest back in the freezer as it softens quickly.

I was a little disappointed in this.  We really expected more out of a recipe with such good ratings.  If you are really looking to impress someone with a pie, I suggest looking further than this recipe.  It is quick and easy, tastes okay (not really knocking your socks off) and uses things most people have on hand.  That is what it has going for it.

This is my very first pie. So easy to make and so yummy to eat! The filling turned out very smooth like ice-cream sundae. It had a rich chocolate flavor that I found slightly too strong (it tasted a little bitter). So perhaps I'll try using less baking cocoa (may be a forth less) next time.

Very easy, rich and smooth. Quick prep and a few hours to freeze, then enjoy. I would have like to decorate with SKOR bar chunks or chopped nuts on top. Good, solid recipe done just as instructed.

This is an amazing recipe, quick and easy, and so very good. The first time I made it was for a party and one of the guests actually stole it right off the table. Now it's one I'm asked to make for everything from birthdays to church functions. If you and your family like chocolate this will be an instant favorite in your house I promise!

This was delicious!  Thumbs up from everyone in the family!  The first time I used a shortbread crust with chocolate chips on top.  The second time I used an oreo crust.  It was great both ways! Yum!

This was a wonderful, creamy pie. I too used an Oreo pie shell making this already easy to prepare pie, easier! Its a great dessert for summer but keep it cold because it does melt quickly. I will definitely make this one again!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving...ever time I speak to the inlaws now they ask me when I am making this again:) It was really good and if you need to save time just buy one of the pre made frozen crusts:) It is really rich so try not to over do it on the chocolate chips/ slivers. I used mini semi sweet morsels, maybe a handful and it tasted perfect:) If you have evil inlaws make this and they will love you:)

My husband doesn't like pumpkin and wanted a chocolate pie for Thanksgiving this year. I followed the recipe exactly except for using a pre-made graham cracker crust. Everyone who took a piece loved it.  We thought it tasted like chocolate ice cream. Thanks for a great recipe!

I had to make a few changes to use what we can get locally. I used frozen whipped cream, and instead of baking cocoa + sugar, I used the same amount of Nesquik. I also used a chocolate cookie crust I made based on a Graham Cracker crust recipe. It turned out great and went over really well with my guests. Great on a hot summer day.

This truly does taste like an icecream pie, and it was so easy!  My whole family loved it!  I used Light Cool Whip, and though I only had 2 ounces of cream cheese it worked out very well.  The next time I'll try it with a chocolate cracker crumb crust.
