Hi - this is my recipe, and I just wanted to say that in its original form, it only takes 20 minutes.  Allrecipes.com tends to change the directions... anyway, just simmer the asparagus in a skillet with 1/2" water until tender.  Sautee the onions and mushrooms together until they're both soft, add seasonings and pour over asparagus on serving dish.  Top with cheese.  MUCH quicker (and true to how I wrote it in the first place!)

The pecans give a nice texture, but for my restaurant, I decided to tweak them a bit. During prep, I browned a pat of butter in a saute pan, stirred in a small amount of brown sugar until it was caramelized, and sprinkled the mixture onto the pecans, then roasted them on high heat in the oven for about five minutes. To balance the sweetness, I threw in a VERY SMALL amount of powdered cayenne, as well as a dash of crushed red peppers, to the asparagus as I cooked it off. Remember, a little sweet and a little spice go a long way in this dish. The final product went over VERY well with my guests.

Used more butter and left out the onion. I have made asparagus with parmesan cheese before but not with those particular spices. Very good.

Loved these. I cooked the asparagus and put that aside, but I put the mushrooms, onions and seasonings all together and sauted till done. I pushed my mushrooms to one side of the pan and put my asparagus back in on the otherside to warm up. Wounderful recipe.

This was very easy to make and very filling! We ate this as a main dish and did not snack before bed.  I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. This will be a regular at our house!

This was absolutely fantastic!  The best asparagus I have ever made!  Will definitely make it again.  Loved it!  I took the shortcut suggested by the original poster, and just cooked the onions and mushrooms together.  Next time I will add more than required pecans, because I thought they were a little too subtle.  Or maybe I just chopped them too small.

Awesome!  The KEY to this recipe is using FRESH grated parmesan cheese.  Do not try to use the pre-grated kind you can buy in the store (or worse yet, the kind the the green can) - grate your own.  If you don't, then I wouldn't even bother making this.  Also, the sweetness of the parm is so good - I would not use pecorino.  We grill asparagus at least 3x a week - great change to our nightly side dish.  I used dried shitake mushroom and added some water to steam them in the pan after I sauteed them with butter. Other than that, I followed it exactly and it came out great!

really great recipe.  Looks great on a white platter.  I added chilli flakes to the mushrooms and it gave it just right kind of 'bite'

I prepared this for the first time following Carrie's instructions (sounded much easier the instructions in the recipe)and served it for Easter dinner.  Everyone raved about it and I absolutely loved it. I like to play with recipes but this one is wonderful as is.  Needed no tweaking although I used roasted minced garlic from jar instead of powder (didn't have the powder).  Absolutely delicious.  This will definitely become a favorite side dish for family dinners.

We skipped the pecans as we are not nut people, and everyone, even my 8 year old loved it. Fresh parm is really the key here.

I'm an asparagus nut but it's always great to try new ways to prepare this perfect vegetable.  The indgredients really blended well together and the pecans added a wonderful texture to this dish.  I substituted fresh garlic for garlic powder but kept the rest of the recipe the same.  I'll definitely make this again!

Mmmmm! I am a good cook, but I never would have thought of these particular ingredients together. You can taste each one and each ingredient brings out the flavor of the others. Genius!  I ended up mixing the sauce ingredients in one pan, and using canned mushrooms because I had no fresh, and used olive oil instead of butter. It was rich enough without the butter. Great recipe!

If you do not really like all of these ingredients, you may not like this dish.  It is a distinct taste that's great if you like all of the ingredients.

This was a very tasty veggie dish.  The mushroom mixture was great.  You can mix things up a bit and use assorted mushrooms.  I used portobellas, as well as white button mushrooms.  I also used white asparagus.  Delicious!

I couldn't believe how good this was -- best asparagus recipe ever!  I did make some changes.  I went with steaming the asparagus as indicated in the published recipe.  However, I used fresh garlic which I cooked first with the onion, adding the mushrooms next.  Also, I used fresh basil instead. Oh -- and I didn't have pecans, so I used walnuts instead.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe for asparagus. I followed it as posted. Next time I might cut down a bit on the butter to save some of the fat. It really was easy as well. Thanks for posting it. I submitted a photo for review

This is a good recipe if you want to "dress up" asparagus.  I added the seasonings to the asparagus (instead of the onions) and omitted the parmasean cheese.  love it.

This is a great, quick and easy recipe.  I made a few changes, I used fresh minced garlic, I sliced my asparagus after steaming and since I cooked the asparagus while I made the mixture portion when the asparagus was done, I drained it and added it to the skillet and mixed it all of it together.  It turned out great!  I think I going to try the same mixture with green beans next time.

This dish is very good, but it takes much longer to prepare than 20 minutes! It took 45 minutes. As a vegetarian entree, I would highly recommend it.
