9.6.18 I made one change to this recipe and that is I added the seasoning packet of Oriental ramen.  I drained a bit of the water from the pan, added the chopped figs to the noodles, tasted it, and there was little to no flavor, just a hint of sweetness.  Knowing I wouldn’t enjoy it as is and most likely it would go down the garbage disposal, I then added the seasoning, and found that zing that I was looking for.  I thought the Oriental taste was a good partner to the fresh figs.   Sorry Chef Lizzie for being the first reviewer and changing your recipe, but I’m giving it four stars with this modification, and I would make it again.
