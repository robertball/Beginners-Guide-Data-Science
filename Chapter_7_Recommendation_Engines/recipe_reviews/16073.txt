What I like to do with these is to grate the potatoes, as opposed to shredding. I find the texture much more appealing. More like a potato pancake, instead of a true latkes, but that's just my personal preference. For every 2 cups of grated potato, one egg is really a sufficient binder, and any more than that just makes them too heavy. I also use alot less salt, but that again is to taste.   Instead of the flour, I have also found better results substituting matzoh ball mix, which contains baking soda and seasonings. They seem to come out lighter, and more flavorful this way. Don't  forget to add the grated onion... it's an absolute must in my opinion, and here again, I add twice as much. And I personally have never bothered with the cheesecloth thing. As you lift out spoonfuls, the moisture simply seeps to the bottom of the bowl. No problem. Don't wait for Hannukah to enjoy these treats, and don't forget the applesauce (or sour cream.) Enjoy!

These latkes were so awesome, just like my grandmother and mom used to make.  I only used 1 egg per 2 cups of potato.  I used the food processor's large grater blade and kept the grated potato in ice water until I had all the ingredients in the bowl and then squeezed the water out and added them.  I used matzoh meal instead of flour and I used about triple the grated onion.  I fried them in vegetable oil. They were great, but definitely on the salty side.  The mixture was a little watery but it made no difference in the end, there was liquid in the bowl when I was done. I think the matzah meal was key. Next time I would use less salt.

This was a bit eggy for me.  I will definitely only use 1 egg next time.  I prefer to be able to taste the potato more.  Also, I read an article about the perfect latke and it said the best temperature is 350 degrees.  I used my metal thermometer to make sure it was that hot before I started and it made a big difference.  The cooked perfectly.  I have had them fall apart before in the past.

I made these for Easter/Passover and they turned out great!  I remember when my mom would make these, and she would always complain about the shredding of the potatoes, but it really wasn't a big deal--in fact, it was kind of fun.  To keep the potatoes from oxidizing, I would ring out the water from the potatoes after every two thirds of a potato peeled with paper towels (because I didn't have cheese cloth on hand).  Paper towels worked just fine. The sooner you ring out the potatoes after shredding, the less oxidation occurs.   Once rung out, they keep pretty well.   I also added extra onion.   I was told to be a true latke, you make them small and thin, and cook the heck out of them.   The cooking took longer than the shredding, that's for sure.   Excellent as leftovers, too.

These were really delicious!  I doubled the onions and still needed more...I'll add more next time.  I went with other reviewers and added garlic powder and only used 1 egg per 2 cups of shredded potatoes.  It was a bit on the salty side so next time I'll reduce the salt.  Very easy to make - great recipe...thanks Rachel!!!

I have never made Latkes before but these were a breeze! I used my food processor (I know..kind of cheating) and it was so simple. I also used olive oil instead of peanut oil and they still tasted great. Thanks Rachel!

I just made these for brakfast and loved them. I didn't have an onion so used powdered onion and some garlic salt. The first time i made them to thick. The next batch i made thinner and they were more crunchy and much better. yum!

So simple, yet so tasty.  I get out the food processer and use the grating blade for the onions and potatoes, then squeeze the liquid out using a towel.  My picky family even eats the applesauce and sour cream served with them.  I used chives instead of green onions.

Finally, a recipe that I'll stack up against the potato pancakes at Manny's Deli in Chicago, which until now have been my all-time favorite! Peanut oil and canola oil both have worked fine for me.  I'll mix the egg, flour, salt and onion first, then shred the potatoes last on a mandoline with the shredder insert, dropping the shred into a salad spinner half-filled with water.  Drain the water, spin out the rest of the moisture and voila - you're good to go. Next step - trying to equal Manny's pastrami sandwiches ...

Emphasizing what others have said about keeping latkes from coming out oily - make sure your oil is plenty hot - almost smoking!  The quicker the egg and flour mixture forms a crust on the outside, the less oil will penetrate.  Just check that they're a good, rich brown color and look crisp, then turn promptly - they'll come out fine and with minimal oil when you fry the other side to the same color.  Just as with other fried potatoes, sprinkle with salt right away.

After making a ton of latkes, I've noticed a few things.  1.  Don't be too over zealous on draining out the liquid.  The second time around I kept trying to keep the potatoes dry and you really need a good balance between liquid and dry amounts or else your latkes will not stay together.  2.  Don't squash them out too thin.  It seems like 1/2inch (maybe slightly less) is the perfect height to squash them to.  Any less and you will be having a hard time flipping them.  3.  If you are being stingy on the oil, make sure the oil is at bare minimum covering a millimeter layer on the bottom or they will not brown well!  4.  1 egg per 2 cups is PLENTY to keep your latkes together. So heed the other reviewers on that advice!  5.  If you like your latkes a bit more seasoned, try different things like adding garlic (or garlic powder) or some curry seasoning.  I wouldn't suggest frying it in garlic olive oil.  The garlic was overwhelming and I like garlic!  6.  Last but not least, it works well if you substitute whole wheat flour or matzo meal instead of the all-purpose.  Although I might add that I found myself using a bit more than called for with the all-purpose.

For the people who asked, grate and shred are different. Shred is larger like hash browns and grate is more mushy not separate pieces. I made these last year & am making again today for a late Hanukkah party. I adjusted recipe per the first review. I grate instead of shred. Like my dad used to but I use food processor and do not bother peeling. I used matzoh ball mix instead of flour, more onion, cut down eggs and added no salt. I sprinkle with kosher salt as soon as they are done frying. Then you actually get all the flavors and salt is one of the flavors. Not just salty. I use a mix of vegetable and peanut oil. Peanut oil makes it more stable at a higher heat so they are crispier.

I've been making potato pancakes (popular with my Polish/Penn Dutch in-laws) for a few years now - with only 2 eggs - plus some chopped onions.  They are always so time consuming to make and I have always had a hard time keeping my shredded potatoes from turning brown - until now!  I used a bag of those pre-shredded real potatoes that you can find in the dairy section of the grocery store (near the eggs) and it was great!  Never again will I stand and shred potatoes.  I will be able to make these a lot more often now that I've discovered how to cut my prep time (and mess!) down considerably.

These were great; more work than I thought, but great!  I used only ONE egg based on the other comments.  They went perfect with the bloodworst I cooked.

These were good; however, when I made the recipe exactly as written, I found it to be too much egg, too much salt, not enough taste, and too greasy.  I found that the recipe tasted better when I used 1 bag of Simply Potatoes Shredded, 4 eggs, 2 tsp salt, 1/4 cup onion, and only added oil on a as needed basis.  Cooked on a griddle on med-low.

A tried and true recipe. I personally like to use mashed potatoes instead of flour, add a little lemon juice to the shredded potatoes to keep them from turning brown( orange juice works too.) Place shredded potatoes in a towel lined bowl place a towel on top and place a plate with a heavy pan on top. Let sit about 10 min. Mix mashed and shredded potatoes together add shredded onions, 1 egg, salt and pepper. Fry as directed. Much better potato taste.

Mmm these are awesome!  I grated the potato so that they were the same consistency as the onion- made for a very tasty latke!  I used olive oil instead on peanut- soo good! =)

I LOVE LATKES!!!....and this recipe is perfect. I read up on the proper way to prepare them (on this site) and did 2 things different that I had not done before. Make sure as much water is out as possible (using a clean dish cloth as cheese cloth was nowhere to be found), and made sure the veg. oil was HOT (a little higher than mid point on my stove between med.and high. They came out perfect. Kept them on a paper towel on a cookie sheet (kept separate) in the oven at 225F when they came out of the skillet. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - a rare 5*

Hey Rachel - I forgot how good Latkes could be until I discovered your recipe! They were SO GOOD, I made them for 2 holiday parties. I did cut down the egg a bit - 2 eggs to 3 cups of potatoes and used half and half matza meal and flour! I just got a new food processor and the course grater is perfect! Thank you so much for a great recipe and by the way...I fried these earlier in the day and they reheat extemely well!

These are do delicious! I had a bag of simply potatoes, that are already shredded, and are sold in the dairy section at the super market. I forgot about them and wanted to find something to use them up in. The bag measured 4 cups, so I just "doubled" the recipe except for the oil. I used vegetable oil and heated it on 7 and watched over them carefully, as they do cook up pretty fast. It made 2 batches of 5. Was very simple to make with the preshredded potatoes and tasty. Note: It says serve hot and I found that the next day they don't heat so well. So, next time I will make only what we can eat just cooked. thanks!

The flavour of these latkes was fabulous, but I found the inside to be too mushy. I'll make them slightly smaller next time so that the centres get cooked through more.

I have made them forever . After grating, rinse in ice water to remove excess starch, drain or spin dry and when you mix in the egg etc. add a little bit of lemon juice and the mixture will not turn black.

Right ingredients, wrong measurement. 1 egg is enough and about 1/2 a teaspoon of salt is plenty, more onion is good too. I made it with 2 eggs and 1 tsp of salt and it was a little too salty, I had to grate more potatoes to use up all the eggs.

It's important to pick the right kind of potato for latkes - might I recommend russets. I chose big ones at the store that looked like they were getting old. Why pick old potatoes? Less moisture content! That means lighter, crispier texture when you fry them. (Oil doesn't like water, remember.)  Don't forget to squeeze out as much moisture as you can, per the recipe instructions. I used about twice as much grated onion, and substituted matzoh meal for the flour. Beautiful!

Great recipe.  I did what everyone else suggested and used only 1 egg per 2 cups (I made 8 cup's of potato's) and halved the salt and flour.  I also put in more onion, since I didn't bother measuring.  Also, when frying, I'd suggest frying it in about a half an inch of oil, since you don't want them to burn or anything.  Other than that, it was a great recipe.

Yum, with the changes!  I used the 1 egg, more onion, less salt and a little garlic powder.  I let the peanut oil get up to 350 F and they came out terrific.  My whole family loved them!

Big hit at our Hannukah celebration.  I made the latkes ahead of time and froze them on trays.  Popped them in the oven at 450 degrees for about 15-20 minutes and they were perfect!!  Thank you to Trader Joes for running out of your potato pancakes and forcing me to make them from scratch - much better!!

1.5 teaspoons of salt is too much. I would reduce the salt by about 50%. I have to dilute the pancakes with extra sour cream or apple sauce cuz it's too salty. Also, I do find it to be a bit eggy. I might reduce to about 1 egg.

A classic recipe missing only one key step. Boil the potatoes first; not completely, about three minutes will do it. Just enough to remove the surface starch. This will eliminate the need to squeeze excess moisture out and produce a far better product.

Loved them. Made some alterations based on the reviews. I used a tablespoon of grated onion and also added a couple chopped green onions. I used matzo meal instead of flour and I would reduce the salt to a teaspoon. One egg for two cups of potato is perfect and it fried up nice in canola oil.

Everyone who has tried these latkes has loved them.  I have used this recipe twice.  Both times, I have cut the egg to 1 egg per 2 cups of potatoes.  I have also added garlic to the mixture.  The second time that I made these I cooked a large batch (10 cups of potatoes) and had trouble getting them all fried before the potatoes began to discolor.  If you are making a lot of latkes it would help to have someone working with you or to break it down to a few smaller batches.  Also, be sure to remove all of the liquid from the potaoes before mixing to ensure the right consistency.

Excellent recipe although I found I could have used more shredded potatoes to the amount of egg.  Used a food processor and squeezed out excess moisture in a towell.  Definately a keeper!

These were quick and easy and would make for a good breakfast accompanyment. They were however a little bland. Try adding some blue cheese or tabasco to the mix, but remember to add a touch more flour.

These are excellent! I made them as a special treat for my boyfriend one morning, and he hasn't stopped talking about them since - every time I ask him what he wants to eat (breakfast, lunch, snacks or dinner), his first request is these Latkes!
I cut down the salt to half a teaspoon, use only 2 eggs, and about 1/4 cup of finely chopped fresh onion, and they come out crispy and delicious every time.

Since the season is near, here's my updated tips from last year which makes them very fast to fry especially for a large group:

1. After shredding/grating, put them in salted boiling water for 3 minutes until you see the starch form on the surface 
 
2. Drain and squeeze out all water using heavy paper towels 
 
3. Similarly, squeeze out all water from chopped onions - you can make the cooked potatoes and raw onions a day ahead
 
4. Use self-rising flour to get a nice crust 
 
5. Get mixture to right consistency by adding matzo meal until liquid not visible and they hold form when stirred 
 
5. Flatten in fry pan with back of tablespoon to get consistent thickness

These were really fantastic! I have never made latkes before, and they turned out great! I followed the advice of some other reviews & used matzoh meal instead of flour, and reduced the amount of egg. I am vegan, so I used Ener-G Egg Replacer for the equivalent of 2 eggs (not 3), and they bound together just perfectly! I also added some shallots with the onions & some freshly ground black pepper. My boyfriend & I really loved these!

(Super-greasy, though, so definitely not an everyday meal! A great treat for the holidays!)

This was my first time making latkes, and I am not Jewish - here is a beginners tip - make sure the oil is hot enough to cook them quickly - my latkes got substantially better as I went along, so there is a definate learning curve.

This is a pretty good latkes recipe. I see no reason for using 3 eggs. I feel that one egg per 2 cups of potato is more than enough. I like to grate most of the potato, and then shred aprox. one half a cup of potato. Growing up my father would grate the potato and not shred it. Some people love using matzoh meal instead of flour, that works great too!

I love potatoe latkes. They make a good breakfast or snacks. I used 5 medium potatos and half of a big onion, shredded them with food processor-fast and easy. I also added 1 tsp of lemon juice to my batter, and reduced the salt to only 1tsp. To keep the potatos from turning brown, I tried to have everything ready before shredding them. Keeping skinned potatos in the water while you skin the rest also helps. And then I squeezed out water from the potatos and onions before adding them to the batter. I used a nonstick frying pan with a little oil-just to coat the pan well. Then I used the ice-cream scoop to scoop out the potato mixture into the pan and flattened them pretty flat. I used canola oil which works very well frying. This recipe yields about 6 ,3-3.5 inch dia. of round-ish discs. They are also so good with ketchup!

I used only 2 eggs and lots more onion! Instead of flour or matza meal I used Bisquick...about 3 tablespoons &  they were scrumptious! Really hit the spot this Christmas morning. =) For toppings I used applesauce & if you use sour cream- cut up some chives & mix it in w/ the sour cream...YUMMY!!

Very good recipe after incorporating the advice from other reviewers.  I only added one egg and tripled the flour and amount of onions. I cooked these in olive oil instead of peanut oil.  This was my first time making latkes and they came out perfect with the above changes!

Thanks to this recipe and "The Perfect Latke" on all recipe I made the best latkes ever for our hannukah party.  These are great - use russet potatoes, and I used matzoh meal instead of flour. Everyone loved them, I enjoyed making them and eating them. Try Rachel's recipe for applesause with them!

(Update...)  made these again in my husband's grandma's ancient waffle iron with a little olive oil spray.  SO EASY, LESS MESSY, PROBABLY HEALTHIER. 


(first review) Wow!  Followed other advice, tripled onion and only one egg.  Added a tsp of baking powder and some garlic.  These were awesome for husband and two toddlers.  Will make again and figure out how to hide other veggies in them.  Hubs liked the shredded potato better than other grated versions.  Will heat up leftovers and put a runny egg on top for breakfast.

Awesome! I added garlic and ground peppercorn medley and Johnny seasoning salt to mine. I also served turkey sausage with the meal and cooked some of the latkes in the droppings after adding canola oil.
My husband talked about them the next morning. A great first potato dish for potato rookies.

As written, I give it three stars.  It has way too much egg and not enough onion.  If you reduce it to just one egg (two at the absolute most), double or even triple the onion, and use matzo meal or panko instead of flour, you'll have a winner.

Not your mama's latkes!!!  I used the recipe converter to increase the servings.  Proportionately, this should be the same recipe as how it's listed above.  I was hesitant to put in as much salt as it called for, but convinced myself to follow the recipe (however I did use less than half the number of eggs it called for- as suggested by previous reviewers).  The latkes are so salty- they are inedible.  Even with a food processor, I find the process tedious and now I will have to buy all the ingredients again and do it all over tomorrow night in preparation for Hanukkah.  This time, I will use a different recipe.

These were good, I followed the other reviews and used 2 eggs. I also used old bay seasoning instead of salt (came out very much like crab cakes without the crab!).  Don't forget to ring out the moisture from the potatoes before adding the other ingredients. I'll make these again. Good reheated too.

I give this a five star because they really are so good. I've been making these for years, I've even added grated cheese and garlic to the mix. When I was growing up I used to think these were our very own family recipe. lol Thanks so much for bringing up an old favourite.

Latkes turned out GREAT. I made 3 batches for 8 people and all of them were gone. Based on the other reviews, I doubled the onion and reduced the salt by half. I also added some minced chives to the potato batter. I used a coffee mug to press them down into thin patties once the potato mixture balls were added to the oil. Delish!

These were so good and so easy! This was my first time making them, and they were delicious! I just used the large holes of my cheese grater to shred the potatoes. My 7 year old helped me make them and he LOVED them! Great recipe!

My husband loves potato latkes.  We used to live by a Jewish deli, and we'd go there all the time for the latkes.  We've since moved, so I decided to learn to make them myself.  He said these were just as good!

I shredded the potatoes with my food processor shredding attachment, and it worked perfectly.  It didn't take long at all!  I'd never grated onion before, but it was easy, too.  The grated onion had a consistancy of applesauce and a lot of concentrated flavor.  Still, I doubled it.  Also, I took the advice of other reviewers and only used one egg and decreased the salt.  They were SO GOOD.  

The only complaint I have is that I'm pregnant and couldn't stand the smell of the peanut oil.  It made me want to gag!  Next time, I'm going to try using vegetable oil, and hopefully they'll taste just as good.

I just made this Latke last night.  It was WAY TOO RUNNY.  Too many eggs for this amount of potatoes.  I squeezed a lot of liquid from these potatoes but 3 eggs are way too much.  Egg pancakes with potato in it, not potato pancakes.  Also WAY TOO SALTY.  I don't think this is my preference, it was too salty that we were not able to finish these.  I think 1 egg will be enough and half the amount of salt will be enough.  I was very disappointed that this recipe is not as good as I expected.

Very good!  If you don't have a cheesecloth, just sprinkle the salt onto the shredded potatoes, wait a few minutes and press down with a plate/bowl to drain the excess water.

These taste really good but I didn't have peanut oil so I just used vegetable oil and it came out very well. And also I would add less salt and more onions. Try making it thinner and crispier. I think it tastes better that way. I used some other reviewer's suggestion to use an egg for every to cups if potato and they turned out great. Absolutely amazing!

I love potato pancakes!  This recipe is so much easier than the Swiss pancakes I usually make.  Very simple & very good!  I made 3 cups with 4 eggs & another half tablespoon of flour. I also used onion powder. I must have made huge cakes because I got 9 even with the extra cup.  I WILL make it again & play with the amounts, but I thoroughly enjoyed them with sour cream.

Rachel, I love Latkes and this was my first time making them successfully. Your recipe was easy to follow and produced the most delicious, totally-not-greasy, mouth-watering, crispy, flavorful, can't-stop-eating-them Latkes. They were exactly how I wanted them.

I used virgin coconut oil to fry them in.

Extra thank you's for sharing the best Latkes recipe.

These were very good! I used about twice the onions and only one egg for the whole batch, as well as only a few dashes of salt (I added salt to it and ate it like a hash-brown-like-pancake after it was fried). Also I didn't have peanut oil but vegetable oil worked great at just over medium heat. Very delicious!!

Three stars because I had to make some changes. (My latkes came out great and tasty though.)  Like what everyone else is saying, there is too much egg in this recipe. I mixed three eggs in with the other ingredients and thought to myself, "It seems too wet." So I diced up about another cup and half of potato to add in. Also, I added more onion. (I love onion so I diced up a small one and mixed it in.) Of course I added a little more flour. So my mix was about 3/4 potato and the rest was wet. I put in some salt and pepper and fried it up. (Hot oil makes all the difference, don't allow it to become tepid). It came out great.

These turned out much better than my other attempts at latkes, but were a little bland.  I made half of the batch as directed, and half with a handful or so of cheddar cheese tossed in.  The cheese ones were much, much better than the plain ones.  It's a good recipe, though, and I'll probably make them again.

I put in less eggs too (2) and didn't strain the second batch, I put more onion in for favor.  They are awesome with applesauce.

I doubled the recipe, but I only put a little extra salt ( I did use season salt though)  and they were still a little salty for my tastes but other then that they were good. I also add a little pepper after the first batch and they were better.

Mine didn't quite come out as you said in the recipe. Here's why:

1. I buy extra large eggs. I used 2 instead of 3 & it had too much moisture. Especify the size of egg OR make it ONE EGG.
2. I therefore had to use much more all purpose flour than it called for. Especify how much using APP would one need or what else to use so that it would work.
3. I hate using onions because of the texture (but that's my pet peeve) so I used green onions. They have a bit of color.

Other things that made mine come out kinda not too good was that used a mandoline to cut my potatoes & the size was too big so I couldn't take out all the moisture I should've.
I also added some pepper since when you eat eggs,it's always added.

However the rest was AWESOME!

Very good!  Took some time for me to figure out how long before flipping to get a nice brown side, but once that was more or less mastered - the recipe was nice and tasty  :)

These potato latkes were the best I have ever eaten. Crisp, light, and delicious.  As per others recommendations; I used 2 eggs, 1 tsp salt. Personally.. I squeezed out excess potato liquid in a towel and then I added dried parsley and measured out each pancake to be 2 scant tablespoons that I flattened before frying. With that measurement I got 13 good sized latkes.

I love this recipe, almost like Nonnie's.  My husband tends to put hot sauce on many dishes for 'flavor' (much to my dismay) and while it's not traditional, I added a good size portion of crumbled bacon to this recipe and my husband absolutlely loved them with sour cream.  No hot sauce in sight!

Per other reviews, I doubled the onion and halved the egg and these turned out great!  Didn't need 1/2 cup oil; I used maybe 1/4 cup canola oil (didn't have peanut and wanted to let our one-year-old try some anyway) in an electric, non-stick skillet and VOILA!  Crispy and delish!

Delicious!  I used a griddle to fry the latkes which allowed me to use less oil.  They weren't greasy at all.  Wonderful recipe--easy to make, and tastes great.

I never dreamed that such a simple recipe could be so delicious.  I have never made any kind of “hash browns” from scratch, but it was so quick and easy.  I followed this recipe to a T, and they came out perfect.  As I was putting them into the skillet I thought to myself that I was making way too many than what my family would eat. (My husband and I, and our two young boys).  But I’ll tell you every last one disappeared, they absolutely loved them.  Even my youngest boy how generally wants nothing to do with potatoes, thought they were fantastic.  I will never buy pre-made hash browns again; this recipe will be a sample in my collection.  Thanks!

They're hard work - but so yummy! I boiled the grated potato as per the advice of other reviewers. Used whole wheat flour, doubled the batch but only used 2 eggs total; added pepper; misread the salt and put in too much - which was almost a good thing because there wasn't enough onion so the salt gave it flavor. Will make these again this week and will add much more onion. ~UPDATE~ For 12 cups of potato, I used 1 1/2 onions. Strained with a cheesecloth - worked really well! And the matzah ball mix instead of flour created a wonderful flavor! ~UPDATE: a 5lb bag of potatoes yielded 10 cups grated potato; I added two small grated onion to that; one egg per every 2 cups; knock the salt down to 3/4 tsp per every 2 cups; use matzah ball mix instead of flour. They're really very good with these changes!!

These were great.  They came out really crunchy and we all munched on them quite happily.  I took the suggestions from the others and used 1 egg for each 2 cups of potato.  I used matzo ball mix instead of flour as suggested but found that the mixture required some extra flour on top of the matzo ball mix.  I used vegetable oil instead of peanut and they were just great. THE BEST LATKES EVER!!

I made these for the first time today and they were amazing! We made them for his class holiday party (a Jewish Preschool) and they were a huge hit. I was told they were the best out of all the classes! The only change I made was using 2 eggs instead of 3 and I did add a few dashes of white pepper. Excellent recipe thanks for sharing it!

I didn't care for this recipe at all. There was far too much egg for my liking which really made the texture nasty, and there wasn't nearly enough onion. Halfway through, we added more onion, more salt and some cheddar cheese to the remaining batter but there was still way too much egg. The whole recipe was just missing something. Sorry.

I gave this 4 stars because of all of the modifications.  This is what I did, and after 3 attempts, found the perfect proportions.  7-8 cups of SWEET potatoes, 1/2 FINELY grated onion, 5 eggs, 1 cup italian seasoning bread crumbs, and salt to taste.  Also, I learned this time around that if the entire pancake moves when slightly touched by spatula, it's ready to flip over.  If not, it will fall apart during the flip. YUM! Go Me! :-)

These are so yummy!  We made them with kids at our preschool, and the recipe was easy enough that they could help, and tasted great after cooking.  We did use vegetable oil instead of peanut oil (due to allergies), and I think we had a bit more onion than called for.  We'll definitely be making these again!

This was great. Didn't have any peanut oil so I used veg. oil instead.  Kind of a pain to measure and keep cutting shredded potatoes to the amount specified.  I just used 3 medium size potatoes & will do this from now on. Yummy!

This recipe is fantastic! We love to make these and they turn out delicious EVERY time! We have even accidentally put in too much flour and they turned out even better. You can't go wrong with this. I highly recommend them (especially with applesauce).

I'm not Jewish, but my boyfriend is, and this year for Hanukkah I made these for him and his friends, and then for his mom. Thumbs up from everyone! (And I've never made latkes before.) I followed others suggestions about adding seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic salt) and using fewer eggs -- right on target.

I've never eaten a latke before, but I thought these were great! They were easy to make, I only used 1 egg as suggested and next time I will use 1/2 the salt, they were too salty. These were delicious served with my homemade applesauce. I will definitely make these again!

I use this recipe time and again. Sometimes I find that this is too much egg. Please note that doubling the recipe is often a bad thing -- your potato will turn grey/brown very quickly with that much unless you've got help in the kitchen and a number of pans going. The egg also tends to separate out if you do this, so you have to remix it all the time and do it quickly. They make AMAZING reheats, microwave or oven. Since I don't mind the greyness (I'm a college student, what would I know...) I usually go ahead and double it anyway (with only about 3-4 eggs though) and live with the greyness. Onion can be omitted without trouble.

I made this today with 40 of my Japanese students (who`d never heard of Hanukkah before). It was chaotic, but everyone had a lot of fun! I cut the eggs as others suggested, but the students and I also found it to be much too salty...

These really are the best! I used one egg and a 1:3 sweet potato to Yukon Gold ratio.  Amazingly tasty for such simple ingredients!  YUM!

I have eaten "potato pancakes" since I was a kid.  This recipe is just like I remember mom making.
The only downside is that grating potatoes is time consuming, but boy, is it worth it!

Wonderful...by the time dinner was ready I had already eaten most of the Potato Latkes.  I tried a little sample when they were done and could not stop eating them.  Especially  nice dipped in sour cream. These are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside,or you can say they are  light  and flaky..just perfect, these are the best ever. 
 They were gone before dinner.. The few I had left  disappeared between the kitchen and the dinning room table..The 2 people helping me put 'dinner on the table' also gave them a 5 star, best ever rating.  You will love these!!
note: After the potatoes are shredded I did put them in a flour sack dish towel (I didn't have cheese cloth) and squeezed the liquid out  before adding the rest of the ingredients. This is an important step, and boy what a difference it makes.   You will love these!!!

Good basic recipe.  I will only add one egg next time - found them a bit eggy.  I also substituted onion powder for the grated onion due to picky children.

The entire family loved these! I didn't have peanut oil. Vegetable oil worked great. Used frozen hashbrowns from a bag too. Just defrost them first.

I discovered this recipe here years ago and use it all the time. I use more oil than is called for and I cut the salt in half, but it is a wonderfully simple recipe. My kids gobble these up. I cook these every few months or so because they are so yummy, not just around the holidays.

These were a hit! A teensy bit too eggy for what we were looking for, but overall delicious. I think I'd maybe just cut down the amount of egg slightly next time.

I did shred the potatoes and grated the onions.  No need for the cheesecloth.  Just put the mixture between your hands and squeeze, letting all the moisture out. I also used 3 Tbs. grated onion, 1 egg, 3 Tbs. flour and fried it in half peanut oil and half canola oil.  These have to be eaten as soon as they are off the frying pan and put on paper towls for a minute. Serve with Sour cream. Delicious!!!!!

So delicious!  We made these for Christmas. Like others, I didn't have peanut oil and used oil I had (canola). I also didn't have a cheesecloth, so I used my hands to try to push out as much liquid as possible. I also used only 2 eggs as a binder and it worked well. Served with chives, grated cheese, bacon, and sour cream. Very good!

I've done these often. I brown the onions in butter before adding. I also add shredded asiago cheese, and for gluten free, use corn meal instead of flour.  Sooo good.

Awesome tasty results, only used the one egg as suggested and added an egg white that was a leftover from another recipe...didn't have to use the starch water to moisten the patties...a keeper!!! Gone in minutes, and definitely keep them warm in oven til ready to eat...

Getting the potatoes dry is KEY.  My mixture was soupy the first time I tried this because I didn't get enough moisture out of the potatoes.  A bit more flour provided a quick thickening, but then they are too doughy.  It's worth the time to dry the potatoes.

Never having eaten latkes before,I have nothing to compare these to, but they are good. I used dehydrated hash browns from Costco, made them according to the directions and then squeezed the water from it.

I was apprehensive at first because of the frying, it seems like every time I fry something it turns into a disaster.  But this went surprisingly well, and they taste good!  Like hash browns.  I think next time I'll use the cheese grater to get the potatoes more shredded.  Definitely will try this again!

THESE ARE AWESOME! Never had these before so my man & I whipped these up! Sooo good! Just wasn't sure what to eat them with - they were on the hash brown side but you couldn't really call them pancakes either. I just ate them plain. Definitely a keeper!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I used about 2/3 of a bag of Trader Joe's shredded potatoes, 2 eggs, 2 Tbs flour, and a dash of salt, omitting the onion.  I also cooked them in a deep fryer set at 350 for about 3-4 minutes per side.  Served with homemade applesauce from this site, they were perfect!

These were amazing!! The only change I made was to use rice flour instead of AP, as we are a gluten free house. My youngest is 18 months old, and a very picky eater, he eats like a mouse. He consumed 3 HUGE latkes and was wanting more. This will be a family favorite, it's better than any I've made before. Served with a dollop of sour cream and some green onions. Amazing!

Fried potatoes are always a hit.   These are crispy and delish.    Make sure you wring out as much moisture from the potatoes as possible though!!

Easy as can be (and less time consuming than other latkes I've made).  I made a half recipe with 1 cup potatoes, 1 tsp onion, 1 egg and 2 tsp flour and 1/2 tsp salt and it worked GREAT!

I first tried this recipe as written several months ago and they came out thick and salty.  I decided to try again with only 1 egg per 2 cups potatoes and a bit less than 1 tsp salt - they came out perfect!

These were great - just like my mom and grandma make for Chanukkah! The only thing I changed was to follow the advice of some other reviewers (and my mom) - I used only 2 eggs and grated 3 small red onions into the potato mixture.

I agree with other reviewer, too eggy.  Plus I was confused as to how much shredded potatatoe-measured out before or after draining in the cheesecloth.  Maybe that affected mine.  Also I added a little extra onion as another reviewer did and maybe that was counter productive.  Will try again with only one egg.

I reduced the eggs to two and added 1/2 tsp of pepper. Served with sour cream and my own spiced apple slices. So good that I'll make these instead of traditional hashbrown potatoes.

Cutting the eggs from 3 to 1 and replacing the flour with matzo ball mix, as other reviewers suggested, made all the difference in the world. Excellent results!

I had a huge bag of frozen shredded potato and thought I'd try Latkes for the first time. I was not excited about the frying so I checked out some other recipes and came up with this. I mixed about 4 cups with dried onion flakes, salt, pepper, 1 tsp baking powder, 4 tbl flour, and 2 beaten eggs. I baked them (1/4 c scoop then flattened) in my convection oven at 400 deg, on a cookie sheet covered in foil and sprayed with cooking oil.  10-15 min/side.  Very crunchy, like a hearty potato chip!

Everyone in our house loves these. I shredded everything (rather than grating). Used a whole sweet onion, added carrots. Put potatoes into cold water in my salad spinner until ready to use. Drained the water and then spun them dry. Worked beautifully. Used whole wheat flour and 2 eggs for 2 cups of potatoes. Made these with Sarah's Applesauce, and it was a big hit.

I made these tonight and they were gobbled up quickly.  I served them with sour cream and applesauce.  They tasted great with both.  I added more onion, a little less salt and used light olive oil to fry them.

I agree with the other reviewers who have said that this has too much egg. 1 egg per 2 cups of peeled potato is plenty. I made mine gluten free by using rice flour. I also added garlic and dill

Amazing recipe!  Delicious and so easy to make.  I used a dish towel instead of cheesecloth and it worked fine.  I also used olive oil in place of the peanut oil.  I can't wait to make these again.

I was craving these after getting an email for sweet potato latkes. I whipped up a batch just now and ate too many of them. I played with the recipe a bit. I added extra onion, shredded zucchini, and some seasoned panko bread crumbs. They turned out just as I had hoped. Mmmm.

I just rang the potatoes out with my hands, then set them on a paper towel and that worked fine for me. I also used extra onion. Just kept shaving till it looked about right! I am a beginner, and this turned out great! Everyone loved these with sour cream!

Excellent recipe and easy to make!  I rang out some of the water from potatoes between shredding and it definitely helped cut back on potatoes oxidizing.  Cut salt in half, may cut back even more next time.

Just like I had when I was a kid! The key to this recipe is wringing the water out of the potatoes - its a crucial step that shouldn't be omitted. It doesn't work the best, but you can also use a good strong paper towel to wring out the potatoes if you don't have cheese cloth. The latkes were delicious and I will definitely be making them again!

These were very good! I used less oil, so mine might have been less crispy than if I'd used more.  Still, they were very well received and all disappeared.

Since many others have offered changes; the first recipe I saw years ago for Latkes called for equal amounts of potato and onion, and to keep them in cold water until all grated.
Sorry, don't recall the amount of egg.

One egg is more than enough.  Any more and the mixture would have become a goopy mess.  The recipe didn't yield very much and so next time I would double up.  Very good once the egg adjustment has been made.

These are so easy!!! No "knuckle blood", because I used the 20oz bag of Simply Potatoes Shredded Hash Browns, all three eggs, one "board" of matzoh, crushed, and 1/2 small boiling onion. Make sure you use enough salt (make a sample latke before doing the entire batch). 
These are awesome! My dad, who is extremely fussy, declared these "excellent, the best I've had in years!"

This recipe was delicious! I have tried many times over the years to make these "potato cakes" never really getting the results I wanted but this recipe is perfect. Just the right amount of ingredients. My family loved them!! I will definately make again. Thanks Rachel for a great recipe!

Really, really good! We used German Butter potatoes (fresh from the Farmers Market, even!) and ended up with a bit more than 2 cups... maybe closer to three shredded cups. I kept the amount of egg the same, but doubled the flour, using one tbsp of whole wheat flour. I used dehydrated onions instead (about 1.5 tbsp), did not even half the amount of salt, and the end result was great. We ate them with salsa on top. I know I'll make these again.

These were delicious and I will definitely make them again! However, I found that medium-high heat was TOO high. I would also add more onions, maybe 3 tablespoons instead of 1. I only used 1 teaspoon of garlic salt, instead of 1 1/2 teaspoons of regular salt. In the future, I might use real garlic and salt, or more garlic salt.

Very good.  However, next time I will use only 2 eggs.  I also used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  I will definately use this recipe again!  Thanks!!

Great recipe, I wouldnt have known how much onion to use otherwise. Used with the very helful how to make the perfect latke tips. I used olive oil and only 1 1/2 eggs and it was totally fine. This was the first time I have made latkes and I was *very* pleased. Will absolutely make again!

I used leftover mashed potatoes, only ONE egg and toped them with fried, diced green tomatoes (I was using what I had in my kitchen).  We really enjoyed these!

Wow! This recipe was an amazing hit!! Over the 8 days of Chanukah, I made more than 100 latkes and they were ALL eaten!! Even my fussy husband liked them, a true Chanukah miracle!!
Since I have a daughter that is celiac, I used gluten-free cracker crumbs instead of flour. I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and reduced the eggs and salt, increased the onion and used regular canola oil. 
I would rave some more but I need to go back to the kitchen and make some more yummy latkes!!

My son just loved these (although how could you not love fried potato). After reading the reviews, I only used 1 egg, which was plenty. I also reduced the salt to 3/4 tsp, though I think I would use a full tsp next time. I'd also bump up the onion a little - maybe another tablespoon.

Pretty good, but I would suggest the following changes to make it slightly more authentic: 
-The ratio of potato to onion should be roughly one medium onion to two large potatoes
-You only need 1 egg:2 potatoes; anything more and it's a bit heavy

He is right about getting the moisture out. If you don't, they will be soggy.

Maybe my eggs are larger than the original recipe calls for but I found that 2 eggs was more than enough. We also enjoy them with a bit more onion, so usually finely dice half of a medium onion.   I fry it in vegetable oil due to peanut allergies.

Way too eggy. Next time I would use two eggs instead of three. I also used half the salt. Otherwise they were good. I would use more onions next time too.

I've never had latkes before, but saw recipes for it and was intrigued. We used frozen shredded potatoes and minced onion from a jar. Skipped step one because, well, you can't pull liquid from frozen potatoes. Absolutely delicious!  Definitely a fan!

Serving suggestion: Put a slice of avocado and a slice of tomato on top. Then on top of that, a fried/scrambled egg.  FANTASTIC.

this was one of the best recipes ive ever used! i could eat these all day. i followed other users advice and used only 2 eggs, i also added more onion than called for, garlic, and shredded cheese. i used olive oil to fry them.  turned out absolutely amazing. the only thing that could make this better is to add shredded zucchini to the mix, which i cant wait to do the next time i make these!

GREAT recipe, and I've made a lot of latkes.  Perfect consistency, although I quadrupled the quantities, and put in fewer eggs than listed here.  I will use this again in the future, ALWAYS.  Thanks for sharing, Rachel.

Super easy, super yummy.  A huge hit!  However I chopped finely the potatoes and used an entire big onion, chopped that as well, and used 1 egg per 2 cups as previously recommended by another member and I doubled the salt.  These were so easy and perfect and a lot less mess and guessing.  I used olive oil to fry them.

I just wanted a quick recipe to remember the ingredients. These are all great, and the shredding/grating debate is totally up to individual taste. The only problem was waaaay too much egg. I wonder if her potatoes are really dry, or her eggs really small. One would be sufficient.

I like the recipe, and agree with most others on their suggestions. I used 4 medium potatoes and grated them for a better texture. I also used half a sweet onion, grated. Reduced the egg to 1 beaten and reduced the salt to only 1 tsp and added about 1/8 tsp pepper. Instead of 2tbs of flour, I used 4 tbs of Bisquick (trust me on this). Nice and browned and delicious - we had them with galumpkis and topped them with a bit of sour cream. Delicious!

Great recipe.  Taste closest to the ones my Mom made us as children.  Only changes were grated potatoes vs shredded, less salt, more onion & one egg (as suggested by others) and added a seasoning mix (thyme/rosemary).  The recipe components were perfect tho--and easy to change up as to taste.  My husband loved them!

I started using this recipe last year when  my daughter and I decided to to learn about Hannukah and the festival of lights. We fell in love with Latkes. We use this recipe often. To season them I use 1/2 ts of season salt and add 1 cube of garlic bullion dissolved in the egg mixture. I also used 3-4 cups of shredded potatoes and still have egg mixture left afterwards. I've also added minced garlic and cilantro.  We use it quite often for side dishes or by themselves. It's made me excited to learn more about different cultures and foods!

This recipe would have been amazing if not for the saltiness. I'm a big fan of salt but this was way too much for even me. I'll probably use just 1/2 teaspoon next time.

I actually made these with a group of preschoolers and they were a big hit. I did some real rough measurments too and they turned out great. The kids loved them. Definitley worth making.

Added a little bit of Gouda in the middle of mine. Less onion (my preference). Still ate it with applesauce. DH ate it with sour cream said they were "really good". Squeezing the liquid out after shredding the potatoes really did help. I would suggest doing half  the onion if u do a sweet cheese like Gouda.

My teenage son followed the recipe, and they were so delicious! (He did substitute olive oil for the peanut oil, and used a little less salt and added some ground black pepper.) Heavenly food.

I took the suggestions of others and used matzoh meal instead of flour, added more onions and used one egg.  My daughter who has tried latkes before and doesn't like them tried one of these -- and then took a second.   Excellent.

I made these Latkes with regular white potatoes (it took 3 potatoes to get 2 cups shredded).  Followed the directions to a T, though strained the potatoes in a mesh sieve since I don't have any cheesecloth in the house.  Fried in canola oil.  As promised, delicious, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside!  Will make again!

Added cut up cooked bacon and sausage.  Increase the onion a little, avoid salt, and cook away!  Also, try a a little fresh herbs in place of bacon/sausage.  Delicious.

I've never had latkes before so I can't compare these to other latkes recipes but these are delicious! I made them one night as a side and we had them two more times in one week. My husband and I fight over who gets the last one.

These came out very salty. That may be my fault because I used frozen hash brown potatoes. Otherwise they were tasty and fried up quite nicely.

This recipe is great! It was my first time making potato latkes and they were so easy. I followed the recipe, just not the peanut oil, I always use vegetable oil to fry in. I pan fried them until they were nice and crispy and then served them up with a dollop of sour cream! Try ths recipe, you will not regret it!

I just made these and the other reviewers are right - you definitely only need 1 egg, and it calls for way too much salt (and I generally like my potatoes pretty salted).  I'd say maybe half or 3/4 of the salt should be used.  These are really good topped with eggs (any style) and smothered in ketchup!

Delicious!  Brought me back to my mother's German kitchen.  Without a cheesecloth, used my hands to squeeze out the moisture from the potatoes.  As suggested, I increased the amount of onion to 2 T. or more and reduced the eggs to 2.  The salt was also reduced a bit, and I added some McCormick garlic and table herb seasonings.  Safflower oil was used in place of peanut.  These are great hot and eaten cold as leftovers.  Will definitely make again!

We love these latkes. I followed other user's comments and only use one egg, 1/2 tsp.  salt, and canola oil.  I squeeze out all of the juice from the potatoes and onion though cloth.  Top off with apple butter and a little sour cream, you can't go wrong!

Thanks Rachel for the great recipe!  I used this to jump start my Chanukah season and refresh my memory on how to make them.  I vary the ingredients amounts and add a wonderful basil poultry rub (basil, thyme, sage among other things) to enhance all the flavors.

I followed the other reviewers' suggestions of the potato to egg ratio.  I also used yukon gold potatoes. The latkes were DELICIOUS!!!  I ended up making a double recipe and we finished them off.  We used apple sauce and sour cream for dipping.  This recipe will definitely be used again and again!

YUMMY!  My kids LOVED these and request them often :)  My friend suggested to have them less hashbrown-like to food process (slightly) half the potato mixture and then return to the bowl before frying.  That worked out great too.

I love this recipe, it is so easy and they come out very good. There is way too much salt though. I would only put about 1/2 tsp of salt.

So...the day before you are going to make these, bring to a boil whole potato, skin and all, take off heat and leave potato in water til cool. Next day grate and follow recipe. I only added 1 egg to 2 c grated potato and flour, onion, SnP. Great!

Fantastic recipe!  I use a whole large onion, though, and buy the shredded Simply Potatoes and then grind them down very fine with a food processor or hand chopper, though.  I prefer the texture of the latkes that way, but this was super yummy as written too! (Made it 3 times in the last week :-))

i followed the recipe and took all the advice from the other reviews - i took 1/3 of the recipe and made it with extra flour and a tbsp of olive oil to make it vegan for my boyfriend - i also added a bit of graded cheese to the mixture and it was a great side dish :)

We had a pile of potatoes that needed to be used up and I wanted to try something new. I'd never had latkes before and this was obviously my first time making them. Though I have nothing to compare them to, I thought they were just great! My hubby thought so, too. Didn't have applesauce on hand, but they tasted great with sour cream and a sprinke of salt (after I cut back on the salt in the recipe, as per many reviewer suggestions). I doubled the recipe and used three eggs as many reviewers suggested cutting back on how many eggs were needed. Anyway, my food processor made this very simple to make and it will most certainly be a regular in our household. Thank you!

Tastes good and easy. I use Simply Shreds or frozen shredded hash browns to make it even easier, I have no patience to shred my own potatoes. Anything can be added to make this your own.

Never having latkes before we didn't have anything to gauge authenticity on, but we couldn't say we were that thrilled with the flavor. They'll be tried again with one less egg and a lot more seasonings.

These are really yummy and whip up in no time.  I had already grated the potato when I realized I didn't have an onion, so I subbed onion powder instead.  My kids really enjoyed them--One said they taste like a cross between a tater tot and a hashbrown. (It was our first time eating latkes)  I think these will be made for breakfast quite often.

I was looking for a recipie that was similar to the one my dad always made us as kids and this may just have been the same exact thing! Absolutely wonderful. My boyfriend and ALL of my uber-jewish friends thought they were great! Followed the recipe to a "t" and wouldn't change a thing!

My family had a great time making these.  I used two eggs instead of three, went a little lighter on the salt, and used vegetable oil for allergy purposes.

I've been looking for a good latkes recipes ever since I was a kid watching the "Lamb Chop Christmas Special" This fit the bill!  I didn''t have the peanut oil so I used regular vegtable oil instead. They still came out fantastic! Yum!

excellent taste, easy to make, great with sour cream. I added extra onion, but it is important to drain the potato, i will drain even more next time. Even try soaking up the onion water because when onion are grated they create quite a bit of water too. Great snack or an accompliment to any meal.

Yesterday was my first time making these...so funny that it's today's recipe of the day. :) I thought that these were Very good. In fact, I think they were the hit of the whole meal! I made them as directed, except used Japanese bread crumbs instead of flour. As opposed to using a cheese cloth, I simply squeezed out the excess with my hands when I scooped, shaped, then placed them in the pan. To go with this I made Burgundy pork tenderloin, Sarah's applesauce (both recipes from here) and steamed broccoli. And of course had sour cream on the table too. YUMMY!!

I haven't tried this but want to answer Snoopy's question..I definitely would/will do just what you were going to...grab the grater and go for it, I think grate and shred are pretty much synonymous, altho shredding would be the smaller size on your grater. I think I'll use the larger size, but will play around with it.  Hope this helps!

Solid recipe, but I think it's better if you use a lot more onion than called for.  I increased the onion to 1/3 cup for every 2 cups of potatoes.

These were OK. I used frozen shredded potatoes, I don't think I would use them again. It was a time saver but in the end I think it compromised the taste.

The whole family loved them! Used left over red potatoes from the night before, so they were already cooked. Just smooshed them up a bit with a masher!

Yummy, but I did change a few things. Per others' suggestion, I cut down on the eggs. Then, I added garlic powder and sliced green onions. And I fried them in a super hot pan until very crispy. Everyone loved them! Sometimes, I like to add shredded Cheddar and crumbled bacon. Not true latkes that way but totally yummy. Unhealthy but ok if you just eat one!

Awesome potato pancakes! These held together perfectly and were crispy outside and tender and moist inside. I doubled this and used 4 good sized potatoes and about 1/4 of a sweet onion shredded finely. I did not double the eggs or salt. Fabulous! Served this with beef rouladen for a great German inspired meal.

I tried these on a whim and found them to be wonderful!  Good for breakfast anytime or supper on a cold winter night.  The only thing I did differently was use a little more onion.

Very nice. I liked these b/c they don't have that heavy taste and repeat on you afterward. I used refridgerated hash browns, already sliced up, so I didn't have to spend all that time slicing and then too much water was not an issue.

Delicious! I ended up using more oil as it was quickly absorbed. I also patted the latkes with paper towel to degrease them a bit.  Fantastic!

Yum!  Very good.  I used a food processer to shred the potato and onion.  I also used Matzo Meal instead of flour.

I tripled the recipe and used fewer eggs more onion and a combination of flour and bread crumbs to thicken.  I used much less oil, just a medium film across a non-stick skillet.  I made half the batch and they were so blah.  I then added crumbled feta, fresh dill and a couple of shakes of Tabasco.  The second batch was much improved, but I wouldn't serve them with applesauce!

I found this recipe to be very easy, and quite delicious!  Since I grated my potatoes, as opposed to shredding them, the consistency of my latkes turned out to be more like real pancakes, rather than the crispy latkes shown in the picture, but I think I prefer them that way.  Mmmmmm...fluffy potato goodness.

I have made this recipe at least 6 times now, and my family loves them. Never any left. I use an entire small onion, only 2 eggs, fry in olive oil, and use slightly less salt. These have quickly become a favorite. Esp with sour cream and green onions. Thansk Rachel!!

I added grated carrots and some parsley for some added color. Reviews had suggested using matzo meal in place of flour, I didn't have any so I though I'd use 2 Tbsp. falafel mix I had on hand (hey, it's Middle Eastern, right?)... actually turned out super tasty. Loved them.

I had eaten these many years ago but couldn't quite remember the recipe. My husband and son had requested them so I went to computer and pulled up my favorite food contact. Found what I wanted and made them up for breakfast. They were delishes, nice golden brown and easy to make. Thanks Rachel, by the way my husband and son loves them.

I added some leftover mashed potatoes and they were great.  Didn't change the flavor that much but the texture was a little different and the yield was greater.

I am not jewish, however my in-laws are.  I make a Hanukkah dinner each year for my children (ages 4 & 6).  When they tasted these, they went nuts!  They are such picky eaters!  I did use less egg as others recommended.  My in-laws were very impressed!  GREAT, EASY recipe.

I printed out the 6 serving version of this recipe. I decided that it did not look like enough for my husband (big eater!!) and me so doubled the recipe except for the eggs.(Doubling the eggs would have made this an egg recipe instead of a potato recipe!) I really wish that I had not doubled the salt, I could not eat even one patty -- it was so salty!! I will try this recipe again and double all ingredients except the eggs and salt. Thanks for a great recipe that goes well with smoked sausage and a veggie!!
I tried this recipe again, reducing the eggs and salt were the answer. Reading other reviews I think I will also try using some garlic salt instead of salt.

Making Latkes during the holidays had always been a challenge.My whole family really enjoyed it so much I had to add a few extra potatoes. I just added the shredded potatoes, little more flour to the excess liquid that was left in the bowl and it was plentiful. This is a recipe I could finally see me sharing with my kids in our favorite family cookbook. Thank you.

My mother and I had made this recipe for our Chanukah party this past weekend.  We tripled the recipe, but only used 4 eggs.  They were a huge hit.  We didn't have even one left.  I'm definitely savings this recipe in my card file for future Chanukahs.  Thanks Rachel

These turned out great!  I didn't have any peanut oil so i used canola instead and it was fine.  Also, I added a little garlic powder to the potato mixture before cooking, but honestly, I don't think it needed it.  They were really good and very easy and quick to make.  Thanks!

Wow! I experienced these latkes for the first time today when we made them for work to celebrate Hannukah. They were great!! I think they added fresh garlic instead of the onions - and I couldn't help myself to more and more! Thanks for the great recipe Rachel!

Delicious. Used green onions in mixture. Also put applesauce and sour cream as topping and garnished with more finely chopped green onion. Will definitely use often.

I did change a few things, This was made for  a single person  I used 1 very large potato, 1/2 onion , 1 egg, 2 tbsp of flour, a dash of garlic.  Omitted the salt and baking powder, and cooked them in bacon fat.   However, I did place the shredded/grated onion and potato, after squeezing out water, in the freezer for about 20/30 minutes. Then added rest of ingredients.  They seem to cook up crunchier this way.

These were a little too eggy, I would reduce to one egg. We also added fresh ground pepper, just a pinch. We loved them and I would definitely make them again!

I used Olive oil in my 9" cast iron fry pan. Egg ran all over. Will make again and fry in rings to hold egg from running. Or perhaps in my one-egg pan. Won't use as much salt.

The recipe as written produces salty, eggy potato pancakes. Latkes should be crispier than this. As other reviewers mentioned, you should only use one egg, not three.

I needed to use some left over potatoes so I made these. I followed others recommendation and used 1 egg per 2 cups and I cut the salt down. These came out great. If I had used the salt called for they would have been too salty for sure.

This recipe is identical to the one my German Mother-In-Law gave me.  The only change that I make is that I place a sieve over a bowl and as I grate the potatoes I place them in the sieve and press them down with a dessert spoon, then I add one spoonful of sour cream. They don't oxidize and the sour cream doesn't affect the flavour.

I have tried many recipes over three years and have finally found the one here. I didn't grow up eating g latkes since we are not Jewish. The closed thing I had as reference were the tried mashed potato cakes my mom made a couple Joe after having them for dinner. But when I tasted these latkes it was like eating those but with a slightly lighter feel, not so densely packed. But the topping s took them to another level. If my mom had thought to put toppings on here I would have found latkes ages ago. These are just mmm good!

Followed the suggestions and only used one egg- loved it! Only issue is that, like many others, I feel it has too much salt, and I think I doubled the onion, but that's because I love onion. I'll be playing with this a bit to get ready for a holiday party with coworkers, so this might be updated!

3 eggs is way too many--it came out more like potato omelettes than a potato pancakes. I would use only one egg.

That said, my little potato omelettes were delicious.

The actual latkes had a nice texture, but don't expect to really feel the potato. Consider adding less egg or more potato if you want something with more defined potato shred look. 

Personally, the salt was *way* too much, and my friend ended up shredding in an extra potato and more egg to even the flavor out. Go easy on salt, guys.

Lastly, I like my food extra flavorful so I added more grated onion. Tasted awesome, smelled awesome. If you are cool with onion, you should try this. Go for 2-3 spoons versus just the 1.

5 stars for the concept but as others have noted, I found a few adjustments to the original better suited our tastes.
I did a half recipe using only 1 egg. I add a splash of buttermilk as well. For the taters I used a grater and them let them sit in cold, salted water while I got other stuff ready. I put them in a colander and let them 'drip' dry.

For a few spices beyond the basics, a bit of red pepper flakes, a little seasoning salt and for fun and texture, I ground up a couple of Ritz crackers. Just two as I didn't want them to over-power the texture.
For frying I used coconut oil.

Loved these! Even my very picky toddler liked them! Made them pretty much as written but used a shallot instead of onion and fried in vegetable oil. I usually eat my latkes with applesauce but these tasted so good I ate them plain.

I love classic latkes, so I made this recipe, but didn’t add any flour. I like my latkes thin and crispy with a chewy center so I make them fairly small, which is why I think I can get away with not using flour. I enjoy them, both, with or without applesauce.

I'm sorry, there's too much egg in this. I probably won't make them again, but if I did, would cut the eggs in half.  I would also reduce the salt and increase the onion.

I didn't like it because my gramma makes the BEST latkes and i have had many in my jewish life! These latkes can become dry while cooking because you squeeze out all the water out of the potatoes. You need to keep a little bit of water so the potatoes can be hydrated so the latkes can be  moist and juicy. Also, DON't EVER SHRED OR GRATE POTATOES.  Always dice or cut them into long thin strips for more flavor and better presentation!

Wow so yummy! My Oma used to make these when I was little and now my boys love the ones I made :) I didn't have peanut oil so I used grape seed oil and I didn't have cheese cloth so I used a clean sheet :-p served with cheese and avocado on top and a side of bacon.

Great, almost the way my mom taught me.  Be sparing with the oil though and blot them before plating.  Only one or two eggs and way less salt.  I would only put about 1/2 teaspoon salt.

After mixing all ingredients together, I took a small amount, squeezed out excess liquid/egg, and shaped them before frying.  They held together really well and were delicious!

Made this last night. Delicious! Read other reviews and only used 1 egg, 3 T of grated onion. Grated 3 medium potatoes. Used vegetable oil. Must be very hot. Made 8 latkes which fed 4 adults. Just squeezed potatoes between paper towels worked perfect.

Love latkes but these were far too eggy for me.  I normally use one egg, preferring the potato flavor to the egg but gave these a shot.  Couldn't finish them.   For the couple who thought latkes weren't for them, try another recipe.

So I have to say, I followed what many other said. 1 egg, matzo meal....these were like my grandmas!

However, the first batch (for school potato latkes party) I made it with fresh grated potatoes, onions. Yummy!!!

The second time, I cheated and used store bought pre shredded...meh.

FRESH is key! I like mine a bit moist and crunchy outside. Melts In your mouth....??

The pre shredded was too dry and the flavors didn't meld together. Also, too much to chew on. ??

Hi there and thanks  for the recipe Rachel.

I'm in the UK and I get kind of mixed up with US/metric/imperial measurements but  I've worked out how to make a brilliant Yorkshire pudding with equal quantities of egg/flour/milk (plus seasoning) and adapted your latke recipe to this, using onions grated by my trusty Ninja in place of milk.  To every 3 egg mixture I add 4 medium/large-ish potatoes, peeled and grated (again in the Ninja.)

I do the batter first (onions grated, then egg, flour, seasoning including a good squirt of garlic paste) and leave it to stand for at least an hour (like Yorkshire pudding) as this allows the flour to expand and blend with the rest of the liquids and prevent it from being stodgy.

Then for the potatoes.  Peel and zap them in the machine and tip into a bowl lined with a clean cloth.  Draw up edges of cloth and wring them out.  You'll get an alarming amount of brownish liquid out ...just keep wringing.  Tip liquid away and in the cloth you'll find stuff that looks like cold mashed potatoes.  Scrape out into batter mix and mix well.  I add more salt at this stage as I love salt  (naughty!)

Then I follow your instructions  though I just cover the bottom of the pan with oil, corn in my case, flatten gently and fry, turning when bottoms are brown ... ohh delish!

They freeze and heat up well too; did one on a sandwich press today with the sandwich.

If you leave out the onion and garlic they  are Irish boxty, very good with butter and jam :)

To die for!! These were so easy to make and were absolutely delicious. I used russet potatoes, grated and rinsed them in cold water, then just squeezed the moisture out of them. I used 2 slotted spoons to pick up a big mound and squeezed the egg liquid out before frying in 1/4 inch of corn oil. Crispy and deep golden on the outside and tender on the inside with just the right amount of onion. I did add some coarsely ground black pepper to the mixture, but otherwise made as directed. Served with sour cream or ketchup, they were the perfect side dish instead of the usual mashed or baked potato. I will be making and enjoying these for years to come!

You best change the amount of salt in this recipe! If I had put the 1.5 teaspoons that it called for I would have had to thrown them in the garbage but because I only put 1 teaspoon in and they were just edible (I had read the other reviews and their comments on salt). I only used 1 egg per 2 cups of grated potato (thanks to other reviewers). I also added a dash of baking powder. I also fried them in sunflower oil.  Other than the salt issue and eggs, they turned out great!!

I've never had/made latkes before this but found it easy and delicious! I wouldn't recommend green onion on top as there is already plenty of onion in the dish already. I grated my potatoes. Not everyone seems to be doing the potatoes the same way but I found that to be the quickest route outside of buying frozen hash browns.

Great base recipe.  Read the reviews and cut back the egg to 1.  Added 2 cloves of garlic and fresh dill week.  Used Herbamere sea salt/ herb blend instead of salt and added a bit of heat with dried pepper flakes.  And a bit of shredded cheese.

I followed some of the other reviews and decided to only use one egg instead of 3; they came out perfect, and tasted wonderful! Also, since I didn't have any cheesecloth on hand, I simply put half of the shredded potatoes in a clean dish towel and squeezed the moisture out, and then repeated with the other half; it worked just fine.

These were great!  I used the food processor to shred the potatoes so this recipe was super simple too. The sign of a truly great recipe...?  I made these two nights ago and now the family has requested them again for Sunday breakfast.  I too doubled the onion and the flavor was spot on for us.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe :)

Potato Latkes I Haiku: "Too egg-y for me. I grated my potatoes, instead of shredding." I let my grated potato drain for awhile to ensure maximum dryness, but found that the eggs called for in this recipe overtook the potato taste that I want to shine when I make this ultra-healthy dish. I mean, once a year I make latkes, maybe twice if I'm feeling sassy, b/c I feel so guilty when I devour them w/ sour cream and applesauce, but this recipe didn't do it enough for us for me to make them again anytime soon.

I've used this recipe and it's good! But here's a new idea for anyone who juices. I used the pulp  left from juicing carrots to make delicious carrot latkes! Simply sub them for the strained shredded potatoes.

Great for a cold snow day,had some cooked potatoes in the fridge so peeled and grated them added only 2 eggs and no flour , used scallions because it was what was on hand---cooked  them in a modest amount of butter on a medium flame -- very satisfying and will be made again.

Totally yummy! My grandmother taught me to make these back in 1970. Same recipe and she even served homemade apple sauce to go with. Of course we also had homemade kraut and sausages! Taught my daughters and hope to share with my granddaughters.

I grew up eating these potato pancakes and loved them served with applesauce. But every time I attempted to make them, I failed miserably and thought I would never get to enjoy them again......that is until I came across this recipe. FINALLY,  I got my wish! I made these for dinner last night along with Pork Tenderloin and I cannot say enough how much my husband (married 33 years and HE never got his wish for these either) and I loved these. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out nice and crispy brown on the outside and tender on the inside. I couldn't believe how easy it was to make these potatoes!  Now we can have them any time we want to and I'm sure we'll be making up for lost time!! Thank you, Rachel for a GREAT recipe!!

I've never made latkes before, so I wasn't sure exactly what I was looking for. However, I'm glad I followed the advice of only using 1 egg as opposed to 3. I definitely feel like three would have made them way too eggy. One was just enough to bind two cups of potatoes together. I also used sunflower oil instead of peanut oil with no problems. Tasted like a glorified hashbrown! I would make these again.

The Rating does not necessarily reflect the recipe. I think since i must be gluten free, and i used gluten free flower, that made  the cakes have a strange taste. I was ok with it more than my family. It was a total bust for us. 
I used Bobs Red Mill flour and from what i hear, that is not the best tasting flower but the only one i can find in the stores in my area so far.
If anyone else out there has celiac disease, use a flower that is not Bobs Red Mill and you may have better results.
BTW, it smelt wonderful cooking. Really sorry this didn't work but i will try again with a decent GF Flour and re-rate.

I made as directed and they came out really wet. I did ring out the potatoes,  they were bone dry but there was a lot of egg mixture left over. Next time I will definitely triple the onion and halve the eggs and salt. and add pepper. good basis recipe though

This was my first attempt at making a homemade latke. The batter seemed excessively eggy and the end result was very, very salty. I added more shredded potato as I was frying them to try to combat it but it couldn't counteract all the salt. I think it would be a perfect recipe if the salt was cut by 2/3 and the egg by 1/2. I usually sneer at reviewers for suggesting changes (ie come up with your own recipe if you know so much--ha ha!) and try to stick to the original recipe, but this time I really wish I'd read the other reviews and cut down on the egg and salt. Who knew!

I did the recipe for my sons first hanukkah (aged 11 months). I made one batch with onion and one without. Im not a fan of the onion flavor but my husband was. Ben gobbed his with sour crean - one in each hand. While my husband who is non Jewish ate them with ketchup for some reason. went  home to my parents and made them too my dad LOVED them. they arent Jewish either but they love the foods i make for Jewish holidays and this is one of their favs during hanukkah/christmas time

These taste just like my grandmother used to make.  Delicious with sour cream or applesauce.  The textures and flavor were perfect.  I used a food processor the first time and a big grater the second time.  Both tools make it easy to use fresh potatoes.  I just press and drain the potatoes in a colander; no fussing with cheesecloth.  The mixture is a little watery but it works just fine.

They came out really good.  I did double the recipe but only used 3 jumbo eggs and still thought it could use less eggs.  I did include matzho meal along with flour since I thought the mixture was to wet.  Next time I will reduce the salt as well.

These were good! I have a ton of potatoes from our CSA and wanted to do something other than mashed or baked potatoes. Like other reviewers had said, I used one egg. I also used some kole rabe whcih gave it a little bit of a peppery note. I used garlic powder and pepper also. Very good!!

These were pretty good. I used a whole leek instead of white onion, and had some fresh dill in the fridge which I also tossed in. I only used 2 eggs, and they held up great, I didn't see any need for a third.  They didn't make 10-12 latkes, though. We got 9 fairly small latkes out of the recipe. Still, very tasty, and both cooking (I also made applesauce) and clean-up were easy. Great low-intensity winter meal.

For us this didn't have enough flavor and was too mushy. I did cut back on the egg and oil though. Adding pepper helped a bit.

These are great.  Does anyone know if they can be made ahead and frozen?  There were none left for me to try freezing when I made them!  I'm hoping to form them, freeze them and cook them off as I need/want for family dinners.  Any hints?

My husband who LOVES just meat and mashed potatoes finally liked something new. I made these last night with peameal bacon for supper, and he loved them. I was so glad because meat and potatoes every night can get boring real fast. Thanks Rachel.

I never made latkes before but the recipe didn't look too difficult. The most tedious part was getting all the water out of the potatoes and onions....other than than it was a breeze. You definately have to  make sure the oil is hot enough.  I followed another reviewers choice to use vegie oil and I used only 3/4 cup of egg beaters instead of three eggs. I will give it 5 stars even though it was modified....and they tasted great. ** You can add a lil spicey cajun seasoning for an added kick

Awesome! So easy to make. The simple ingredients were far more flavorful than I thought they would be. We will definitely make this again! We served them with sour cream on top. (89)

This recipe was great, except i followed everyones advice and didn't put that many eggs, i only used 1. I also doubled the amount of onions, and still wasnt enough! LOL but i think thats just because i love onions! But in the end, the latkes were delicious, and i definitely plan on making them again!

I made these tonight to place on beef brisket sandwich.  While they were very good next time I will follow the advice of others and add less egg.  I did add some garlic as well as parsley.  This recipe has now been placed in my 'make it again' book, yum yum!

These were wonderful.  I made a double batch and it still wasn't enough for my boys. Warm applesauce and maple syrup makes these a great pairing for scrambled eggs and sausage in the morning or as an easy dinner.  Had to make and extra batch to put in the fridge.  I found these also freeze well.  Cook as normal, thaw in fridge, and put just enough oil in the pan to keep them from sticking.  So simple and tastey!

This was a great recipe! I have never made latkes before, so this was a great starter recipe. I made as is (except I used dried onion instead of fresh) and it was very tasty. Next time I will add more onion, as it is just a personal preference. I'll definitely make these again.

Yummy! I only added one egg and replaced the flour with matzo ball mix. Only problem was that it definitely did not serve 6. Next time I'll double the batch for my family of 5.  Thanks for the recipe

Not a bad base recipe. Good, but a bit bland for my tastes, and that was with using more onion than actually called for. I'll have to play around with the spices next time I make them.   I didn't have peanut oil, so I used olive oil instead.

I use 1 egg for every 2 cups of shredded potatoes like many reviewers had suppgested. I also added alot more grated onion and less salt, about 1tsp of onion powder and some parsely flakes. They really have a nice flavor. My bf prefer these cold. I thought i was going to have leftovers and woke up to none.

Wow! I have never had such good potato latkes.These were so unbelieveably delicious!  I'm  having a brunch so made them the night before. Then  reheated in the oven  the next morning and served with sour cream and chives. YUMMY! I took the advice from other readers and used only 1 egg for the 2 c. of potatoes. I also used ore -ida frozen shredded hashbrowns that I had thawed in the frig. Instead of grated onion used 1/2 -1 tsp. onion powder and 1 tsp. garlic salt instead of plain salt. And these were a snap to make. This recipe is a real WINNER!

Very easy- I don't have too much experience with cooking things like this, but decided to give it a try as it is one of my favorite foods. I found it very easy to make, and had a lot left over for the next night! Will definetly make again :)

I love, love, love this latke recipe! Instead of shredding potatoes, you can get frozen hashbrowns & thaw what you need to use in the fridge, which is what we do- as it's a lot easier! These latkes cook up a little fluffy, & golden brown- just perfect!

great recipe.  used to make my own, but found it a pain grating the potatoes and getting the water out of them.  i switched to a mix until i read savta's hint and i used simply shredded potatoes.  couldn't have been any easier.  i increased the amount of onion and decreased the salt a little. i also used 1 egg instead of the 3 eggs.

I made this and you can grate your potato, after peeling of course, the same as you do the onion.  3 medium size will make 10-12 pancakes.

Really really good.  I used a bit more than 1/2 cup very finely chopped onion and less than a teaspoon of salt, and they were still a bit salty. I also used 2 large eggs which was plenty.  I just squeezed the water out of the shredded potatoes by handfuls before adding the other ingredients.

I adapted this to use up 2 small potatoes for a quick snack of 4 latkes. Didn't use cheesecloth, just a strainer and oops, I even forgot the eggs! They stuck together just fine, cooked them in canola oil & served with a little sour cream on the side! GREAT.

These turned out great.  I did use veggie oil, less salt and more onion.  Thanks for posting.  I will add these to my rotation.

My daughter and I had a Latkes cook-off and this recipe brought me in on top.  My husband uses this same recipe but grates the potatoes, where I prefer to shred.  Both are great...but mine are better ;)

These were phenom! I had been looking for a latke recipe similar to this. I served mine with sour cream and applesauce on the side, I think they went best with the apple sauce.

I decided to grate the potatoes and onion.  As far as the flour and egg, you really have to add a little at a time until you get the desired consistency.  Oil temperature is probably the most important.  Medium-High works best.  If you don't have access to cheese cloth, try using a clean t-shirt you don't use anymore.  It worked pretty well.  

Also, I was thinking of a dish to complement my latkes (in case they didn't come out so well), buy some sliced pastrami to roast up in a skillet, rye bread and mustard.  Woo Hoo!!

These were pretty good.  I followed other suggestions and used the "simply potatoes" shredded hashbrowns.  Certainly made this recipe easy and fast and I can't imagine it compromised the taste in any way.  They are not frozen and no excess moisture to worry about.  I loved the crunch!  Others thought they lacked in flavor a bit - if I make again I would add some more spice.  Chopped chives would be good I think.

It is a reliable recipe; I added more onion and 1.5 egg.  They were very easy to make but next time, I will add shredded carrot and pulsed fava beans to make it more nutritous.

We loved these! My husband has never had anything like this before. He was skeptical, but pleasantly surprised when he tasted them. I grated the potatoes instead of shredding them. They came out just as good to me. I companied them with a cabbage roll recipe I found on this site.

Made these for a holiday dinner for guests that were not familiar with latkes.  I got raves.  The recipe calls for 3 eggs and many reported 1 was enough.  I decided to take the middle road and use 2.  I also used veg oil. They came out great! I will make these again.

Very good recipe. The latkes had an excellent consistency and looked nice on a plate. My only suggestion would be to add a little more salt and some fresh ground pepper!

These aren't quite as good as the ones I've had before, but they were still tasty.  I cut down on the eggs as others suggested, and I used the grate function on my blender for the potatos.  I also didn't have peanut oil so I used olive oil instead, maybe that makes a difference.
