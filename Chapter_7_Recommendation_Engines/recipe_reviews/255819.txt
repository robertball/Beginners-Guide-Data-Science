Texture is a winner!I'm eating one ( ok two) right now!I I only made these because I wanted to use up some coconut flour and unsweetened apple sauce and 2% milk that was hanging around too long. Thanks to Allrecipes "this but not that" ingredient search. That being said,I also subbed a second  cup of unsweetened apple sauce instead of the  pumpkin and vegetable oil instead of coconut oil and honey in place of agave. Don't you hate it when people make so many changes? But for real - these are excellent even with my changes.  They are not sweet, but pleasantly muffiny and hubs can drizzle maple syrup on them and be happy. Thanks Laura!

I used Cashew milk instead of Almond milk. I will make them again.

If you are looking for a healthy alternative to the standard sugary muffin, this is it.  It’s hearty, filling, and not at all sweet. I will save it to make again. HOWEVER, If you are looking for a gluten free muffin that tastes just like “normal” muffins, this is NOT it. You’d need to add a ton more sweetener to get It there.  

Notes: I subbed regular milk and butter; used honey instead of agave nectar.

I automatically rated it five stars, but I have yet to make it. I was wondering if I could remove the applesauce? I make myself vegan muffins, and my mother gets gluten free, because she's not vegan but gluten makes her sick, but she's allergic to apples. Would love some help.

These were good & I followed the recipe as written.  My husband found out recently that he is diabetic.  He said these muffins were really good.  I might substitute bananas for the pumpkin next time.

I made these according to the recipe and they turned out great! Moist and flavorful and not too sweet! Maybe it's the oats, but they seem to be more filling than an ordinary muffin. I took some to work and people loved them. Will definitely make these again.

Made this the other morning to use up some canned pumpkin. The batter doesn’t pour, it needs to be scooped and mine didn’t rise at all so don’t be alarmed  if yours doesn’t either. They taste really good (added mini chocolate chips) and even my picky  6 year old boys like them. They are very crumbly. I’m wondering what I can add next time to make them hold together better.

VERY Yummy recipe! I will add nuts, raisins, dates, and or choc. chips next time. I subbed butter for coconut oil without issue.  Delicious!
Don't forget to drizzle coconut cream over the top of a warm muffin and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar, or maple syrup!
