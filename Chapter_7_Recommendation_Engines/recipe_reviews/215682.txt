This was very good I used a little less walnuts than called for as I only had about 2/3 of a cup on hand and I used more garlic than called for. The only issue with this was that it was a little wattery and took longer to cook than stated.

I made it with 1 onion instead of 2 because of the review saying there was too much onion. I used 2 garlic cloves instead of 1. I love the idea of this recipe as an alternative to meat but it turned out too salty. Maybe it was the chopped walnuts? Needs more tweaking.

At first it tasted okay... But way too many walnuts and onions. Needs altering a lot.

This came out delicious! I altered the amounts a bit because I was working with 3 regular sized zucchinis and just eye-balled the amount of walnuts and cheese. I did Not add the chicken bouillon which I think is the real reason some people are finding the dish too salty. I just added a little seasoning instead and it came out So Good. Can't believe there are no breadcrumbs in it! Thanks for the recipe!

Surprisingly good. I was skeptical that this would be mushy and bland but not so!

I will definitely make this again! This is a great lo-carb side dish. I served it with roasted turkey breast and my husband said it was better than stuffing! I adjusted some of the amounts of the stuffing ingredients because the zucchinis I had were on the smaller side so I didn't require as much "stuffing". I only used one onion a handful of cheese and a handful of walnuts.

I added chopped tomatoes and mushrooms to the recipe. The walnuts really made it tasty!
