A very different recipe. Next time I will cut back on the oil. I will also add olives and maybe the addition of a mild cheese. This gets better as it ages. UPDATE: I have my sister addicted to this recipe. She request that I bring it to all our gatherings. You can change this recipe up with any chesse you want and it will turn out the bomb! I made it with feta, cheddar, and blue chesse. It is still wonderful. LOVE, LOVE this recipe! Oh yes, I added olives to it and no one can stop eating once they start!

This was really good. I added a few black olives and a little less olive oil.

This dip was good, i did make some changes.  I halved the recipe first of all because my husband doesnt like gorgonzola.  I added a little more lemon juice, a heaping Tbs of sourcream, and it definately need something else so i added a lot of cracked black pepper, and a couple of pinches of crushed red pepper.  It sure was good though, on some ritz crackers or whole wheat crackers, i enjoyed it.  THank you!

This dip was great.  Spread on Tostitos.  Spread straight from fridge.  I was out of Red Wine Vinegar so I used Balsamic Vingegar.  This would also be wonderful on top of a burger.  It has lots of possibilities.

Serious flavor in this one! I really enjoyed the lemon with the cheese. The gorgonzola I bought came in 5oz container, so I adjusted the other ingredients to work. I did think there was a bit more oil than needed. I also think it might work well to throw all the "wets" in the food processor before adding the onion and parsley. The leftovers (if there are any) are going to be tossed with pasta and chopped pecans - or mixed with cream cheese and stuffed into mushrooms...lots of ideas! Thanks for the recipe, Hammertime!

Loved it! Very stinky, which in our house is a good thing! I didn't have a red onion so I used a few green onions, diced fine. VERY good. I think I'd keep it like that, I like the mild onion flavor. I had to really MASH it to get it to blend, think it would be easier in a food processor or a blender. Next time, more "wet" and I'm tossing it all in a whizzer. And there WILL be a next time!

I preferred this dip served with raw crisp veggies instead of crackers.  It had a good flavor combination with the salty, tart, crunchy, sweet but I felt it was lacking a little heat.  Next time I make this I will add some red pepper flakes! N*R

Again, since this is a N*R review, I made as is(other than I doubled it), so my review will be for that. The flavor was very good but I felt the proportions were a bit off. Next time, I will make it with balsamic, a bit less oil and snip in some green onions. I served it with lightly toasted sourdough and rye and it was tasty like that, but, as others have said, I think it'd be a good topping for burgers. All in all, a solid starter recipe. N*R

By itself as a dip for crackers or whatever, this recipe is a four; it's pretty good, but not totally fantastic.   Used as a stuffing for mushrooms however, is definitely worth a five. I took another commenter's advice for the second time I tried making this and added cream cheese for stuffed mushrooms.  I added about a cup of cream cheese and set it in the refrigerator for about six hours or so.  I chopped the stems off of baby bell and white mushrooms and sauteed them in butter for about three or four minutes, adding a little lemon juice at the end (goes really well with mushrooms, in my opinion).  I very carefully scooped out the middle of the mushroom caps to fill with the Gorgonzola cheese mix and then baked in a preheated oven at 375 degrees for about ten minutes, although another five to ten minutes probably couldn't have hurt.  I still had some dip left over and will probably use that for crackers.  Thanks for the recipe!

BEST DIP!! Used less oil (3 TBS) and added about 12 coarsely chopped kalamatas- everything else the same.  EXCELLENT taste.  Used pita chips as the dipper. YUMMY.

Very Good. I made it how the recipe said to. It is a very concentrated flavor with a nice salty touch that would be excellent for turkey sandwiches, wraps, etc. Next time I will add some cucumbers and bacon pieces...maybe even some sour cream to help tone the flavor down.

This was an excellent dip.  I think it would be really good with black olives.  I'll have to try that next time.  I had it with Jicama and Kohlrabi slices.  It was especially good with the Kohlrabi.  Thanks. :)

I am sorry. I was not to impressed by this dip.  I am still not sure if it should be blended with a mixer... I might like that way as a spread.  I am using mine in some wraps and actually heated it with the meat.  But as a dip, I don't think so...

I too could only find a 5 oz container of cheese. Plus, I thought I had a red onion on hand, but only had yellow, so that is what I used. I am not the biggest fan of bleu cheese, but my boyfriend could not get enough! He wants me to make hamburgers for dinner tonight so he can top them with this dip. In the future, I may cut the intensity with some other more mild cheese or sour cream like another reviewer suggested.

This is a very good dip especially if you like strong cheeses!  I made it to the directions and then tried some, at that point I did add some sour cream to kind of tone it down a little since we were taking it to a party.  But I will definetly be making this one again.

While I loved the flavour of the gorgonzola and the garlic it was very overpowering! I ended up mixing about a third of the dip with a cup of cream cheese to tone it down a notch, and it was still potent. I will try these flavours together again but with only 1 clove of garlic, and equal parts cheese mixed with cream cheese and maybe some sour cream.

We served this to my in-laws over Easter weekend.  It was pretty good.  My brother-in-law ate over half of it it.  I scaled the recipe to use a 5 oz. container of Gorgonzola.  We didn't think the garlic wasa very prominet flavor though, and we would have liked to taste it more.  We could taste the cheese, then the red onion.  I didn't taste the olive oil like others did, but I did use an oil for bread dipping.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this recipe was ok, but there was nothing left in the bowl.  The kids even ate it:)  My one niece thought it was to heavy on the garlic, but I didn't.  I think I would like this mixed into sirlion burgers or topping a steak.  It is certainly easy.

This was pretty good.  I halved the recipe, but added a little more lemon juice.  I used green onion rather than red.  After trying this, I decided I would like it better if it were creamier, so I tossed it in the food porocessor.  It reminded me of a bleu cheese based cheeseball.  Very good served on celery! N*R

Wow!  This is one recipe that is packed with flavor!  I agree with the idea that there is a tad too much olive oil, I could taste the flavor of it even amoungst the other strong flavors.  But it was still tasty and I am generally not a fan of soft cheeses.  Hubby LOVED it, and I brought it to a pot luck tonight and two people asked for the recipe.  I agree, a good base recipe (I like someone else's idea of green onions) and totally servable as is.
