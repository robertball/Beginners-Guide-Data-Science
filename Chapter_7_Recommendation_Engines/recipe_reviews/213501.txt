This was a good, inexpensive recipe for the family. We did not use cilantro but otherwise followed the recipe. It was not a show-stopping fondue, but it was one that all the kids liked. It good with everything that we dipped: cauliflower, French bread, mini ravioli, crunchy bread sticks, and some chicken nuggets.
