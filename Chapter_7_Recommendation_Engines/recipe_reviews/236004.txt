I like my potatoes very well done, so I set my cast iron skillet in a 425Â° oven and when preheated  added red potatoes (personal preference) and baked them until they were well browned.  The other substitution I made was to use regular bacon.   Serve with a little sour cream and you have a yummy treat.

The amount of toppings that can be added to this are endless.  Next time, I would roast the potato wedges at 400 - 425.   Perfect football food!

Wonderful and easy!  I thought the seasoning was a bit basic though so I did add some garlic powder, onion powder and paprika.  My family raved over these potatoes!

By the way... they weren't 100% done by the time I took them out but they were fine.  Also, my cast iron skillet wasn't big enough for all the potatoes so I cooked two batches, then I put them in a baking dish to bake.

I agree with the other reviewer, I roasted them at 400 and for a bit longer, 35-40 mins, I like them really crispy.  I used cracked pepper bacon because that is what I had and would do that again the next time!  Don't forget a side of sour cream!
