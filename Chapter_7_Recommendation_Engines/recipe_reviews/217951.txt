This is delicious.  I used all kale (approx. 1 lb.), butter instead of olive oil, and almonds instead of cashews.  So, so good.

I made this last night....it was terrific!  I used pecans toasted because that's what I had so I can only imagine how good it would be with cashews.

I had been looking for a good Kale recipe because it is so nutritious.    The first time I prepared it, I used nuts, but did not the second time and didn't miss them at all and also cut back 1 tablespoon olive oil by not using nuts.  Just trying to cut calories!  One problem, however, with the recipe, it doesn't give instructions on if the garlic is to be used whole, or cut up. the second time I prepared this, I sliced the garlic to bring out the flavor and it made a positive difference. I also cut up the Kale into bite size pieces so it would be easier to eat.  Great taste!

1st time I have cooked kale!  My grandma, who said she hated kale & is extremely finicky about food ate her whole plateful & said she liked it.  (She really won't eat it if she doesn't!)  My grandpa liked it so much he took my bowl when I had my backed turned to take the cornbread of the oven!  :)  No leftovers!

Changes:  Unless you buy raw cashews, they are roasted. I had some & used them.  I bet this would be even better with freshly roasted cashews.  Wow.  I I had used a little of the bunch of kale for another recipe. I tried to cut a bit from the center, places that looked tougher. I used a bag of baby spinach minus a little, since that is what I had.  I used a medium sized shallot since that is what I had (& I'm not as crazy about onions)  I used 3 garlic cloves, because I had fewer greens & I tend to find garlic overpowering.  This was just right for me, though most people I know would probably be happy with the whole amount.  I will probably try 4 if I have the proper amounts.  Also, unfortunately I only had black pepper instead of white.  It was still wonderful.  I made this with "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread" & ham for an easy, quick dinner.

It is excellent by itself but on different occasions I have mixed in seasoned chicken and/or also added garlic shrimp to this dish with wonderful results.

Wow!  I have never like vegetables very much. But when I heard how nutrient dense kale was I went searching for how to cook it. I tried this recipe only changing almonds for cashews and I really liked it!

Good, but missing something.  Next time I may try throwing something else in it too, like a splash of white wine or cranberries or parmesian cheese.

My husband is not a veggie eater, but he really needs to eat veggies.. too scared to try but this one turns out really good and delicious and now it's one of his favorite sidedish's. I made a few changes,rather then use salt, i used instant chicken bouillon, spring onions and i sprinkled parmesan cheese on the top....

YUM! This is really good! I did add a tiny splash of white wine (less than 1/4 cup), a sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese on top and toasted pecans in lieu of cashews (out of stock). Fantastic! Even our one family member who usually would not even consider this as edible food liked it, and the rest of us loved it! I am anxious to try it with cashews as written! Thank you for the recipe, Dawn!

Great side dish! My husband and I both really liked this. I used roasted sunflower seeds because its all I had, threw them in the skillet for the last minute. Turned out great.

We really loved this. I think next time I will use pine nuts instead of cashews for preference. My family really like this including my kids. My husband, who doesn't like spinach, liked it. What a great healthy recipe!

This was absolutely delicious.  Had never eaten kale before and was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't add the cashews as it was salty enough and I don't need the extra calories.  I did add a rasher of bacon instead.  Added a great smokey flavour to the dish.  Currently on a high protein low carb diet and this was perfect.  Served it with baked salmon and mashed celeriac.

This was ok, nothing special. It was my first time having cooked kale. I threw in raisins for an added flavour boost.

Made it without the spinach, since we didn't have any. It was good, but everything else was falling to the bottom, under the kale. I think the wilted spinach would kind of wrap around things and hold it together better.

The onion did not turn out so well.  The onion taste was was overpowering.  The cashews were great.  I gave it three stars because the next day it tasted much better.

Made this as a side dish to go with Baked Cod with Italian Crumb Topping and whole grain rice. I used some almonds and pecans non salted instead of cashews. Only thing I would add next time is a little stock or white wine as it needed a bit of moisture. All in all the meal was delicious and really quick  and easy to make as nothing took long to cook.

I thought the flavor of this dish was on the bitter side so I was disappointed.  I know it's healthy and I love kale in a smoothie but I won't be making this dish again.

This is a winner, I did the onions and garlic brown and toasty.  Sweet and salt with great crunch!  I also like that most of the ingredients are things that I often have in my kitchen.

This is really good, I've been making something similar for years...if you want a different twist also stir in some cut up tomatoes and a dollop of plain yogurt!

First time I've ever tried kale (picked some up at the farmers market).  Wow!  This recipe is a keeper.  I used butter instead of oil and just toasted the cashews in the butter in the skillet, then removed and started with the onion.  I didn't have any garlic so I just sprinkled in some garlic powder.  Perfect!
