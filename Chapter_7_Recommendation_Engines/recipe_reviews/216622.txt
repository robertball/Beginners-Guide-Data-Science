I cut this down so that my ingredients were 4 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (I weighed it), 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder and garlic powder, 1/8 teaspoon cayenne, and 1/16 teaspoon ginger.  I sprinkled some on my salmon, covered the salmon in foil, put it on the grill, and VOILA!  Yum!  I saved the rest in a retired spice bottle marked well so that I'll remember what was in it!  Thanks, Papa, whoever you are!

I don't like many Brands of Seasoned Salt so I was inspired to try this. I can generally look at the spices and see that I will need to adjust to my liking.   I cut down on the garlic powder to 2 Tablespoons as I love garlic but my husband throttles back on it.  I can always sprinkle additional Garlic later if needed. I also  substituted smoked paprika for the Cayenne Pepper as Wildie suggested.  I have young grandsons that don't like the extra heat.  I also added 1 Tablespoon of ground Thyme.  It's one of my favorite spices so I threw it in.  Thumbs up to this creation!  My husband even commented on how good it was.

I was looking for a recipe like this...can be used for any meats, as well as vegetables on the grill, stews, etc.  One Change I made was to substitute smoked paprika (1 tsp) in place of the ginger.  Very close to Riley's all purpose seasoning.

I think "Papa's Seasoning Salt" is perfect for just about anything. I found that this blend is rather addictive in a good way: I couldn't stop eating it even though I didn't initially find it extraordinarily delicious. I think that it is the onion-garlic-ginger combination that makes it addictive, although I wouldn't actually be able to identify a ginger flavor if I didn't know that ginger was an ingredient. I keep a shaker of it on the dinner table for "regular salt." I made mine with Celtic sea salt and homemade 4-pepper blend. I found that "Papa's Seasoning Salt" became more delicious with time after the flavors melded. I made 100 servings, which is about 1.5 cups.

Thanks to Marianne's recommendation, I made this up in the specified amounts.  For anyone who is interested, it made over sixteen 4-ounce jars.  I plan to give them away for Christmas.  Thanks for posting!

So far I've only used this on veggies, & for me it tasted similar to Magic Seasoning Vegetable Blend, but with a hint of sweetness. I cut the recipe in half, using 13 oz. of Diamond Crystal Kosher salt. I also cut the cayenne pepper to a dash & added 1.5t. of smoked paprika. I used granulated garlic & doubled it since it is half the strength of garlic powder. I highly recommend waiting a day or two before using it to let the flavors come together.

"Papa's Seasoning Salt" is not especially delicious on its own; however, it makes everything it seasons deliciously addictive!  I have made this many times. Thank you Popa Craig for sharing your recipe.

I made this as directed and I have used it on everything from steak, to baked potatoes. It really has good flavor and accents what ever you rub it on. My only issue, and I'm sure its a personal one, is I feel there is too much pepper in it. But if you like pepper this is for you! ? I will be making this again, but cutting back on the pepper. Thank you for sharing!

I've made this twice now & my family has really enjoyed it. I added a little extra garlic because we love garlic. Other than that, I prepared it as written & it was excellent. We use it on all kinds of meats & veggies.
