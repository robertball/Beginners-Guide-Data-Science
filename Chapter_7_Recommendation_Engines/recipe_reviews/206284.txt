I used reduced fat sour cream, homemade dry ranch seasoning and homemade canned pickled jalapeno rings. Because I did use homemade jalapeno rings, I cut it back quite a bit. What I did was chop a little at a time and fold it into the dip and taste it--once I got to the heat I wanted, I stopped adding the jalapeno rings. This was INCREDIBLE. I served this with a veggie platter and my family and I could not get enough.

Fabulous!!!  Made exactly as written. Served with tortilla chips.  I also made one of the black-eyed-pea salsa (cowboy caviar) recipes.  I put a big bowl of chips in between the 2 dips and everyone raved...  Great combo!! This was very refreshing and enticing, the cilantro/jalapeno is just great!!!
3/6/2010 UPDATE
Made for another party and people couldn't get enough!  Served this time with carrots, celery and quartered cherry tomatoes.  Yum!!  Then we put it on hamburgers later that night as a spread.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!

I’ve made this several times as a dip for appetizers. There’s always a ton left over, and was happy to discover how well this goes as a sauce over chicken, pork, or fish.  Great recipe! :)

definitely have to chill it before serving it.  Always a good sign though they were eating it before it was ready.

I made this up for Easter and the family loved it. I did half the recipe and my only regret was not to make more. The spice picks up some heat after it sits awhile so beware.
