HELPFUL TIPS THAT MAKE THIS WORK FOR ME: Say NO to BUTTER!!! lol  After trying the most popular wings recipes on this site, I got the baking down (350 for 45 min, take out and re-spray w/pam to make crispy, then 375 for 15 min) .........but I was not satisfied w/the hot sauce!  No matter what I added or reduced, it still tasted too buttery.  I also didn't want hot because we have toddlers in the house who eat them.  Well, this recipe was a hit BUT with some minor modifications like NO BUTTER!!! Even when you cut the butter in half, you still can taste it.  Plus it makes the sauce slide off the wings.  I add about 2T ketchup or a tad more to the 2T honey and 1/3C hot sauce of any kind.  The ketchup and honey really cut down on it being hot ...like the butter would but w/o adding the unneeded GREASE!  They stick real nicely too! I love them!!!  So if you keep thinking something is just not right, try my suggestions!

Having been born and raised in Western NY, this is the closest recipe I have seen that matches a basic wing sauce. It's a great base and allows for multiple alterations. My wife generally just uses the butter and hot sauce (specifically Franks, it seems to be the best for wings.) But after you make the base, you can do just about anything to flavor it. Teriyaki sauce is a good additive, garlic is ALWAYS great, honey is a good sweetener and tends to bring out the flavor, as does brown sugar although you should start small. (Like about a tbsp for this size batch.) But if you're looking for the way we like 'em back home in Buffalo, this is it. Enjoy.

Typically I prefer a pretty spicy wing, and if you're looking for a hot and spicy wing sauce this isn't it. But If you like wings in general this sauce has outstanding flavor!!!! The ketchup is virtually undetectable it just help make it thicker and the honey gives it a real nice sweetness with just enough pepper sauce to give it some warmth. Not a hot wing sauce but it has real great flavor!!!

Here are a few tips from making this sauce so many times.  - The sauce tastes best with Franks Redhot sauce, and Heinz ketchup.  Make sure not to skip the honey.  -The longer you let the sauce simmer, the thicker it will get.    - Depending on the brand of butter or margarine you use, sometimes the the oil likes to seperate from the rest of the sauce.  In these instances I use a small bat powered milk frother to mix the sauce(a hand immersion blender should work fine also).   -If you like a hotter sauce, use equal parts butter, ketchup, and hot sauce.

We go to a local restaurant that serves the most amazing hot wings.  The sauce is addicting.  This sauce is definetly the sauce this restaurant uses.  It is spicy without the overpowering taste from the hot sauce with just a hint of sweetness.  I can't believe I found this recipe.  AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Great simple recipe, I fried my wings (with no batter) cooked the ingredients as directed and tossed the wings in the sauce. I didn't measure exactly and may have added too much honey, but my hubby loved them and I will definitely come back to this one again and again.

This recipe is much better than plain hot sauce and butter. The sweetness from the ketchup and honey cuts a lot of the acidity from the hot sauce. The only change I made was to increase the amount of hot sauce and add some cayenne because I like spicy buffalo wings. Great basic recipe.

Very good wing sauce just the way it is. I tend to like a honey barbeque sauce, but my husband prefers a little more spice.  I decided to try this recipe and it suited both of us!  Will definitely make this recipe again.

I was hesitant about the recipe, but tried it anyways.  It is now a family favorite. Everyone liked this over the hundreds of store bought, dry ingredient packages and internet recipes we have painsakingly tried.  The ketchup seemed freaky, but you cannot tell it is in there.  I did make one TINY adjustment - threw a dash of BBQ sauce (not more than a squirt - 3 Tbsp) which was great.  I like the sauce to 'stick' to the wings more and think next time cutting the butter down a tad to see if that helps.  This definately is a keeper! Cool Beans!

4 ingredients + personal imagination = 1 great sauce!!  Scott's recipe is great as-is for wings.  I changed the proportions of the ingredients a little and added chopped garlic when making Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches out of chopped cooked chicken.  (1/2 cup each of Frank's and Heinz, 2Tbs butter, healthy Tbs of honey, and one minced garlic clove.)  Serve on a bun, or dinner rolls for a fun snack!  Thanks Scott -- this one's a winner!

I can't have it, I'm allergic to cayenne, but my husband says this is wonderful! I skip the butter, as previous posters have suggested, and discovered something. . . when you drop the butter, there is no fat at all! He says it's wonderful! Thank you for the recipe!

This was delicious!  I used it to make the Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches here and my husband and I just loved it.  I did reduce the butter by half to get a more concentrated flavor in my slow cooker, but YUM!  This will be my go-to wing sauce!

Very tsty!  I followed the recipe exactly (something I rarely do) and doubled it for the dish I was preparing.  The taste is definitely more of a "sweet heat" than a "scorching heat", the sweetness of the ketchup and honey is very present.  The sweetness is what I really enjoyed - I like the way it balances the hot sauce.  This can easily be altered for hotter tastes by increasing the hot sauce and/or decreasing the amount of ketchup.  Next time, I might try half the amount of butter as there IS a lot of grease to this; but the butter does add to the deliciousness!  Thanks Scott!

Honestly, if you execute this correctly, you should not have any problems. Mine stuck to the wings perfectly although I did have to stir it regularly to keep it from separating. Swapping in different pepper sauces easily makes for a wildly different flavor.

This sauce is amazing!  The more honey/sugar you add, the milder it gets.  I use this at least once a month instead of eating at a restaurant!

I used this for buffalo chicken sandwiches and because I really didn't need or want this much butter, I reduced the amount to around, 3 TB. Use really good butter and you don't need very much. I used Kerrygold. If you need to moisten it a bit, use stock. Pretty good. :o)

Awesome! Made this for some friends and it sure made an impression on them. They couldn't make up their mind what taste was predominant except it was very good. This will be one of many sauces I'm going to make when wings are cooked. GOOD JOB SCOTT!

This is a fantastic wing sauce--tastes just like something you'd find at a restaurant. I made it to pour over boneless buffalo wings (from the "Boneless Buffalo Wings" recipe posted by BettyCook on this site), and everything received rave reviews! Will definitely be making this again.

This is a great recipe. I like my wings hot so I used a habanero sauce called Dailey's Habanero sauce found in the produce section at Food Lion. I also used 2 1/2 tbs honey and 2 tbs of brown sugar. I added one minced garlic clove also.  I have made this 4 timees in less than a week. I am a wing fanatic and this is my new wing sauce. Finger lickin Lip smackin good. Thanks Scott.

Great sauce! The recipe as written is wonderful. We like it with a little more heat so will increase the hot sauce to 1/2 cup.  For people having issues with the butter being too oily, make sure you wisk the sauce completely to combine.  Once you do this the consistency is perfect.  You can use this sauce as a base and add garlic, onion powder, etc. to create other flavors also.

Not bad. It is not the best buffalo sauce I've had, but okay. I think we prefer hotter sauce so I will add less honey and more hot sauce next time.

I made this for me and my husband, he really liked it but I found it to be a bit too sweet so I added some salt and red chili powder to the sauce to alter it to my liking.  I would definitely make it again because it's simple enough and tastes good enough.

This sauce was good. Would've given it a 5-star rating only it wasn't hot enough for my "Heat Lovers" and I had to add spices to it to make it hotter. Even with that, it still didn't get HOT enough.

Great recipe! I cut way back on the butter as everyone else suggested, but left everything else the same. I whisked the sauce a bit while it simmered, and the flavors blended perfectly. Thanks Scott!

I was looking for a cheaper way to get one of my favorite treats, but this sauce disappoints.  I followed it exactly and it had a really strong ketchup taste and not a lot of buffalo.  I did like that it's thicker than traditional buffalo sauce, but I don't think I'll make it again since it doesn't satisfy my buffalo wing craving.

Wow was this sauce HOT!!!
After reading the comments, I thought it would be mild to medium sauce.  I was really disapointed when the wings were nearly smoking!  Maybe I should have used Franks instead of Tapatio.

This was great especially for my family as we don't like the hot stuff.  I did as another review suggested and leave out most of the butter (cut down to 2tbls) and I doubled the ketchup and honey so I had enought sauce for the amount of wings I had.  I would definetly make this again!

This was a good sauce recipe, not terribly hot.  I brushed my chicken with olive oil and garlic and omitted the butter.  Next time I'm planning on leaving the skin off (don't eat it).  If you like your sauce with more kick,  add more hot pepper sauce.  Gonna try 1/2 cup instead of 1/3 next time.

Delicious!!  I loved this sauce and it had a nice thickness to it that coated the wings well.  It was something different other than the regular hot sauce and butter buffalo sauce.  The only thing I did differently was added more hot sauce, a 1:1 butter to hot sauce ratio, since we like ours spicier, and added a dash of garlic powder.  The slight sweetness from the honey and ketchup give it such a nice flavor.  Thank you for the recipe!  I can see I will be using this sauce very frequently for our buffalo wings!

We liked this a lot. Based on the other reviews, I cut the butter in half and used a half cup of the hot sauce. I could have used even more hot sauce, but it was very good. Other than that I kept it as the recipe called for.

My son who is allergic to tons of food including peanuts, tree nuts, dairy, egg,seafood saw a picture of chicken wings and wanted to have some “spicy chicken wings”. What’s a mama to do? Go to her trusted all recipes app. This recipe seemed doable and allergen free so I gave it a shot. My son loved it! Although it was a tad spicy on him (it was a first time for him to have anything spicy) he ate it all without me forcing or bribing him. Even my husband approves. He said it felt like eating in a restaurant. The only change I did was to marinate the wings with some lemon, soy sauce and pepper. I feel like the chicken needs to have some flavor seep in and not just outside. I followed the other reviewer on how to cook the wings in the oven.

Very, very similar to what I grew up with in Buffalo. Delicious as is, or if you prefer a suicide wing version you can skip the honey and up the Frank's hot sauce with some  cayenne or ghost pepper juice.

We really liked the taste of this sauce so that's why 5 stars but the butter kept separating from the rest of the ingredients. You had to keep stirring it up to keep it blended. Since that first time I only use 2 to 4 tablespoons of butter and it didn't separate as badly.

Doubled this recipe and only added 3 tbsp.  Baked frozen wings, pulled them out a little ear, mixed the wings in with the sauce and re cooked for 10 min and then used as a dipping sauce.  So good and got lots of compliments. This was also the first time I made wings!

I made no changes and it came out perfectly! My guy loved it and it was perfect for me because I can't do spicy stuff. It was perfectly mild

Used 1/3 cup sriracha and 1/3 cup ketchup with 1/3 cup honey.  Turned oven to broil but kept oven rack in the middle.  Baked wings for 15 minutes on 1 side, basted with sauce and baked for another 5.  Then, turned over, basted and baked for 5 minutes.  Basted again and baked for 5 more minutes.  Perfect, especially since it was my 1st time making them!  Family was impressed!

I tried this recipe and I have to say this is the best wing sauce I have eaten.  I also like because it is so simple and easy to make. I added a little more honey to mine and WOW! I don't know if it makes a difference, but I get my Hot Sauce from Mexico. Had company over that evening and there wasn't anything left. ScottCim you did really good.

I'm only middle of the road on this recipe, but it's probably because I like my wings on the hotter side.  Definitely too much ketchup (but I may have noticed the ketchup because I knew it was in there).  I only fed it to myself so I didn't have any other opinions.  I'd definitely cut back on the ketchup (and probably on the butter too - add more honey).  Kids would definitely like it - not spicy at all.

I made this last night for my family and they loved it, especially my husband. I madre the sauce exactly as written, except I used a little more honey. One I prepared the sauce and poured it over the chicken, I sprinkled some lemon pepper seasoning on the wings. Absolutely delicious!!!!

I agree with other reviewers that the butter is not needed in this sauce. It has great flavor and slight sweetness to it which is perfect for me because i dont like too much spiciness.  Add more hot sauce for more spice.

I was cooking up some wings for Sunday Football and realized that I forgot to grab my wing sauce.  Already having 2 beers, I wasn't driving to the store so I looked up recipes on here and found Scott's.  I only had some Chipotle Tabasco sauce as my pepper sauce and let me tell you - this is IT.  It was so good even my husband approved and he is a tough critic!!  My sauce did separate when left for a while on the stove but I'm sure it had to do with the type of butter I used and didn't affect the taste.  I mixed right back up as I shook my wings in it!!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I think I may have reviewed only on other recipe on here...but I HAD to come give this 5 stars!!  I took the advice of another reviewer and used bbq sauce in place of the ketchup.  I wanted to eat the whole bowl of chicken by myself!! Great recipe!!

We live in Australia so we can only get our hands on asian chilli sauces or Tobasco. We've only tried buffalo wings once and that was in New Zealand. It was really delicious so we thought we'd try this recipe. We added 1 tsp worcestershire sauce and garlic powder. We read one review where they put in a touch of brown sugar. Tasting and testing as we went along. The sauce was a bit sweet so we added sea salt to balance the sweetneness. Lastly we took the sauce off the heat and whisked in chilled butter. This worked fine and didn't split. Overall we were pretty happy with the result and considering we haven't been to the US and tasted the authentic thing, we thought it was bloody beautiful. Thanks

SOO easy!  For the wings, I rinsed and dried them with paper towels.  Using a simple mixture of all-purpose flour, salt, pepper and cayanne pepper, I dredged the chicken in the flour mixture then set on a wire rack that I placed on top of a cookie sheet.  This way the juices didn't cause the chicken to turn out soggy.  Baked the chicken at 400 for about 45 minutes (flipping halfway)...they were perfectly crispy!!!  We poured the sauce over the cooked wings and...YUMMMM!!!!  They disappeared within minutes!

Suprisingly good. I was affraid of the ketchup dominating the flavor but it blended very well. I actually reduced the honey by half since I like my sauce a little more tangy

I took my first stab ever at making wings for the games yesterday.  Picked up two dozen wings from a favorite local grocery, slightly seasoned them, and tossed them over charcoal on the Weber.  I used this sauce, with no butter (Chef Joy made some good points) and the consistency of the sauce and the way it stick to the skin of the wing was first rate.  My only tweak next time will be to use much less ketchup than the recipe calls for, think it was a little too akin to bbq sauce with 1/3 cup ketchup.  More Franks Red hot, less ketchup next time.  Will do again!  

BY THE WAY: if you have never tried making wings over charcoal, you haven't lived - the cooking over charcoal made these wings off the charts good.

WONDERFUL! I always have some of this already prepared in my fridge ready to heat up! I've used red wine vinegar, cider, and white. All work perfect! Throw in some hot pepper flakes for a little more of a kick!

I made this sauce exactly as listed at first. It tasted like spicy tomato soup. My husband agreed. The good thing is that it is very easy to modify - which we did - and ended up with a great sauce.

This was delicious.  I made a double recipe using 1/2 cup butter, 2/3 cup hot pepper sauce, 2/3 cup ketchup and 4 tablespoons honey.  I didn't double the butter-didn't need too.  I will keep this recipe handy.

We immediately fell in love with this wing sauce.  It smelled like it would be spicy but it had the right amount of heat and sweet.  My husband added sriracha sauce to his.

First let me admit that I'm a total wuss when it comes to spicy things. I was a bit hesitant about making buffalo wings at all, but my boyfriend loves them, so I decided to try and find something I could easily make less spicy for me. The other reviewers are correct. This sauce is pretty mild. As-is, I could happily eat it. Since my boyfriend likes spicier things, we divided the sauce in half and added more hot sauce to his and more honey to mine. It turned out great (both his and mine) and we'll definitely be making boneless buffalo wings again in the near future.

This was a wonderful sauce!!! So quick and easy! I would definately use again! It's mild though so if you want it hotter you need to add more hot sauce.

Great! We didn't have honey, so we skipped that, but it was still so good, and I can only imagine that it will be even better with honey.

Too sweet and thick. The flavor was OK but not what I expected.

This was great!  I left out the butter and added garlic powder, a squirt of ketchup, the honey and hot sauce as in the recipe.  It was tangy but had the right amount of heat.  Used for buffalo chicken wraps.  Next time I'll skip the ketchup all together.  My husband thought it was too much flavor, but I think he just had too much sauce on his wrap.

very tasty, sweet flavor is a nice touch. but not very hot at all. I added about tspn of crushed red pepper, didnt add much spice. If i make it again, I'll probably add a little more hot sauce and maybe a little more red pepper. but it was very tasty, either way. I coated chopped cooked chicken breast with the sauce and topped premade pizza dough with it, then topped that with banana peppers and cheese. Came out very good. A little greasy, may cut out some of the butter if I use it as a pizza sauce again.

I think this recipe has way too much butter.  If I made it again, I would cut butter in half.  I am typically a huge fan of butter, but I think the butter may minimize the hotness.  I used brown sugar instead of honey and added jalapenos to make it hotter.  I wanted these wings to be hotter than they are as the recipe is written.

This sauce is great!  Although it is a mild sauce it doesn't have to be.  I followed everything exept for I substituted vinegar for the butter and added a few drops of Habanero Tobasco Sauce and WOW did that make a big difference!  Went from mild to EXTRA HOT!!  Very tasty and not greasy at all!  Best wing sauce recipe I've found yet!  I've tried about 20 different versions and this one is definately a keeper!!

I can't believe how few reviews this recipe has- this is AWESOME wing sauce- much better than anything you can buy at the store.  It's restaurant quality for sure!  Thanks for the recipe Scott.  I thought ketchup was a weird addition, but that and the honey really tone down the heat.  This has tons of flavor and not too hot at all (and I'm a spice wimp).

I just want to say, this sauce it AWESOME!  We have cut back quite a bit on dining out, which is why we searched for and tried this recipe.  It certainly satisfies our craving for our local wing joint!  We like to toss it with boneless popcorn chicken instead of the wings.  Don't forget to serve with Blue Cheese dressing for dipping!

Did not like this.  The sauce was ok.  However the wings were not crispy.  Need to find different way to cook the wings.  Maybe it will counteract with the sauce better.  Maybe cut butter in 1/2 next time.

Great recipe! Small suggestions: cut down the butter, use vinegar for that tang, and you can substitute brown sugar for the honey.  Just make sure you use about a tbsp of sugar (maybe less if you don't want it too sweet).  My family likes a tang in their buffalo sauce so that's why I added the vinegar.  I use that asian hot sauce (squeeze bottle) so I just eyeballed the amount and tasted it for the correct amount of heat.  Very good sauce.

I wish I did follow the reviews and cut the butter back some, but I like to try recipes as they originally are posted - so I ignored the reviews and used all the butter. For future reference - cut back on the butter! I actually could drain some of it off the top of the finished sauce from the bowl, but otherwise - this sauce is amazing! I served it as a dipping sauce for potato wedges and I even dipped my already coated (in a different sauce) wings in there. Wow, delicious! Thank you so much Scott. I will definitely be using this sauce in the future - with less butter ;).

We loved this hot chicken wing sauce! I did cut back on the butter by only 2 tablespoons, based on other reviews.  It is surely a keeper!  Better than bottled wing sauce!  Thanks Scott!

This was absolutely the best wing sauce by far. The only modifications I made were to add a bit more hot sauce and a whole lot of minced/chopped fresh garlic. I will try next time with a bit less butter as it was very greasy. Fantastic!

Great poured over chicken or for dipping. I had a bag of breaded chicken that I baked and dipped into this sauce. Very easy - ingredients I had on hang - and satisfied my urge for some buffalo chicken.

I used even less hot sauce for the kids and added a shake of garlic powder on a whim. They gobbled them up! I liked this sauce because it still tastes like wing sauce without being overly spicy.
