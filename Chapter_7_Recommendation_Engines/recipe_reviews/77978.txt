I exchanged 5 oz of the ketchup for bbq sauce and added 5 drops of tabasco sauce.  I had read that someone thought it was to ketchupy and what I did corrected that.  They went fast!

This sauce is so good!  I love the cinnamon and clove addition.  Adds just the right amount of spice.

I got the courage to go with this recipe with the unusual ingredients of cinnamon and cloves.... glad I did.  This is slightly different from your typical BBQ sauce type dish - and certainly not Italian. Rather a tangy/sweet flavor.  Since this was an appetizer for a pot luck party - wasn't looking for a meal - rather tidbits with a different flavor. It was a hit........

Yum!  I made it exactly how stated and love the taste.  It's different than the typical bbq sauce & jelly recipe that people tend to do but in a very good way.  Everything blends together nicely and it's not ketchupy at all.  I always make this in a crock-pot since I bring this to my work pot-lucks.  I mix all the sauce ingredients in a seperate bowl and pour over the Lit'l Smokies, then stir to coat them.  I cover and turn on high for about 2 hours until heated through and then turn to low to keep warm while serving all while stirring occasionally.  It's a keeper in my recipe collection!!

Delicious! I was skeptical of the cinnamon and cloves, but they really made the sauce tasty. I doubled all the ingredients except for the ketchup, and it wasn't too ketchupy tasting. My husband (a huge little smokie fan) loved it!

I have always used bottled bbq sauce to make lil smokies, but these were really good and very easy. I added some garlic and onion powders. I will probably make them like this from now on! Thanks.

It was okay. Better after many hours of soaking in the sauce. It still carried that ketchup taste. Not sure what I'd do differently. Great in a pinch since most of the ingredients are in your kitchen.

Omitted the cloves, and didn't have mustard, used Mcd's honey mustard instead.

I made these exactly as written. I used French's honey dijon mustard because that's what I had in my fridge. These were so delicious! They were all gobbled up. The cinnamon and cloves give them an extra special something. Great recipe!

It was a little too ketchupy for us.  Next time I'm thinking of adding a touch of Liquid Smoke to see if that will make it more hearty tasing.

I did not care for this at all.  Too much katchup flavor.  I ended up putting more brown sugar in to it and reheated it.  This was very salty, so I feel I need to balance out the salt with more sugar.  I do like the cinnamon and cloves but I'll have to find another way to incorporate the spices within a different recipe.

These were fantastic - 5 stars because of the unique flavor that's a refreshing change to the typical BBQ or jellied sauce you usually find in this dish. Was just a bit short on ketchup (about 2 oz) and it wasn't ketchupy at all as a couple other reviewers commented...maybe that 2 oz. made the difference.

This is the sauce I was looking for! It's something different than the usual sauces.  I'm not a fan of ketchup but used it anyways. I did add a little Worcestershire sauce for a beefier taste.

Seemed too ketchup-y.  Added more spices, mustard and added a little barbeque sauce.

We loved these!  I did not have yellow mustard so I added spicy instead and it worked well.  5 Stars!

Not bad.  Easy, and the flavor is pretty good.  We like ketchup, so although the taste was there, it melded well with the rest of the ingredients.  I put on the stove on low for about 2 1/2 hours and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe because I didn't have the ingredients for the recipe I normally use.  I was thinking to myself that these may be too ketchupy.  But very pleasantly surprised!  I didn't have any of the cloves this called for so added a little chili powder. I also threw in some minced onion and substituted dry mustard for regular, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Took these to work and everyone just loved them.  This is now my new standard! Anxious to try again with the cloves.

Great flavor, but sauce needs to be thicker.  Added onion and garlic powder.

this is a good basic recipe very similar to the one that i used to make.  over the yrs. i made a few adj. i wanted something less tomato flavor.  i eyeball the following and sample as i go.   i normally start with a base of tomato sauce.  i buy the restaurant sz. can and use for so many recipes then  i add dry mustard and cayenne sometimes i even make homemade mustard with dry mustard.  this produces a very hot mustard the longer that this mixture of water and dry mustard sits on the counter the hotter it gets.  love it!!  i add other ing. to the mix for my homemade mustard.  it is wonderful.  i also add Worcestershire sauce, chopped onion and green pepper to the mix.    i love making bbq as well as other sauces.  they allow you to experiment.
