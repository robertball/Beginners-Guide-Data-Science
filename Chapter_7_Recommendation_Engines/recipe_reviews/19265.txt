Exactly what I was looking for in a sugar cookie, soft, fluffy, easy and most of all tasty!  Not too sweet, perfect for tea/coffee.

Eating these tea cakes was like chewing on cardboard. Eating them with tea was like chewing on wet cardboard. I can not see how these cakes could be deemed edible. The seagulls at the beach wouldn't even look at them.

I did this recipe as a drop cookie and they came out alright. This is the first time I've ever baked sugar cookies, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it was a nice and easy recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I tinkered with it, but it is a wonderful basic sugar cookie.

These are fabulous. They are cakes...NOT a cookie graced with either a very delicate whipped icing (store bought will is unsatisfactory), and/or fruit/whole or preserve. (flour should be self rising not all purpose though) They are not to be dipped in tea, but sip-bite as with cuisine and good wine.

These were not good.  At best, they were bland.  I just baked a batch, and even frosted they taste bad enough that I'm going to have to have my husband swing me by the grocery store to buy cookies.

These cookies are very bland and mealy in texture. I did substitute butter for half of the shortening, hoping to bring up the flavor, but no luck. Perhaps with some icing they would be good.
