How delicious was this?  Outstanding!  I prepared exactly as written, but added some sliced granny smith apple and dried cranberries to the vegetable mix, and decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  Roasted for about 1 hr 10 minutes, and let the meat rest before carving.  Tender, flavorful, sweet, it was perfect.  The house smelled wonderful while this was cooking.  Thanks for sharing this terrific recipe, SJRJA, it's going to be a classic in this house.

Oh me, Oh my this is sssssooooo good.  I did change a few things.  I added 2 pealed apples to the squash mixture(only because I had tons of apples on hand) and I used fresh garlic, homemade apple sauce with cinnamon, so I didn't add any extra cinnamon.  When I deglazed the pan with the wine, I added the onions, garlic, and extra two apples and let everything cook down some and carmelized the onions lightly.  And just before I put it in the oven, I added a couple of small handfuls of dried crandberries for some tartness...........it turned out simply wonderful.  We gave this recipe five stars.  My husband loved it and I did as well.  With autumn being my favorite season, I will make this dish often during my favorite time of the year.  I served it with mashed patatoes, and German coleslaw from this site.  This one is a keeper.

This was great! I'd had a boneless shoulder roast in my freezer for a couple months because there are many times that I do not like pork as it gets SO dry and I was reluctant to make it! Anyways, I made it today and it was SO moist and delicious I couldn't believe it. The juices from the roast and applesauce and cooking out of the squash and onion really soaked into the meat and made it so moist and flavorful! I followed the recipe except that I put it in the oven before church and needed way longer than 1 hr., so I put it in at 250*F and vented the foil to prevent boil over- was gone about 4 hours. Pretty much fork-tender- amazingness. :) Served the veggies and broth over white rice. Very yummy.

An excellent recipe as written. The flavors of the apple sauce, sugar and soy meld really well as it cooks and no 1 flavor stands out too much. I consider the original recipe a fairly "safe" dish that almost everyone, kids included, would probably like.   I also made this using the Cranberry Chutney I recipe from this site in place of the apple sauce and I loved that even more. That recipe has cranberries, apple chunks and lots of "pie spices". The spices and cranberries kicked up the flavor and complemented both the pork and the veggies. I found adding the brown sugar unnecessary.   Of course I added way more onions and squash each time and the leftovers were super for lunch the next day. So good, in fact, that I didn't even need the pork to go along with it and just added some leftover boiled potato to make my meal. All the juices had cooked into the veg and it was awesome.

Thumbs up on this one! I mixed the garlic powder and about tsp each s & p and rubbed into the loin before browning. Added water instead of wine. Put into 13x9 as I don't have oven safe pan and baked to temp. Still little pink in the middle which is fine with us. Great taste on the sauce. Squash was nicely flavored, still couldn't get hubby to eat that though. Not to sweet nor tart. Very nice flavor on the pork when drizzled with a little of the jus. I like apples with pork, may add some of those part way through next time. Thanks for the recipe SJRJA!

AMAZING!!! I used a boneless pork shoulder since that's what I had on hand. Along with the butternut squash and onion I also threw in some granny smith apples and dried thyme and cooked it all together in my slow cooker on low for 8 hours. I would recommend cutting down the amount of brown sugar. The roast I cooked was a pound heavier than the one this recipe calls for and 1/3 cup of sugar was more than enough. Perhaps add more if your applesauce is unsweetened, though. Either way, this recipe was fantastic and totally hit the spot :)

This was great, I used a roast with a fair bit of marbling in it as that is my preference.  Delish!

WOW!  This was a delicious combination of flavours and a very pretty, autumnal meal.  I added an extra sliced apple and a handful of dried cranberries (even though I don't like them) and it was DIVINE--cranberries included!!   As one reader posted, make extra as it is EVEN better the next day!  This will definitely be made again.

THIS IS A KEEPER!!!!! My boyfriend will not stop raving about this (and I cook ALOT)!! I did change a few things for convenience sake though. I changed the veggies the roast sits on to whole cloves of garlic (about 5), carrots and potatoes. let me tell you: the carrots need to be added to this recipe. they are PERFECT in the sauce! I'm sure many veggie combos would go great in this, so just use what is on hand! Again: you will NOT regret using this recipe! easy, and makes you look like a super-star!!!! I love the sauce so much I might just use it on veggies as a holiday side-dish!

I loved this dish!  After 35 years of cooking for my family, my purpose in using this site is to branch out from my "usual".  This is one of those dishes!  Simple, flavorful ~ the cinnamon & applesauce makes the butternut squash "sing"!  For those reviewers who found it too sweet, I agree that a little dried Thyme might balance that out a bit, and help bring out the flavor of the pork loin a little more.  But I still give it 5 stars as-is!  It's going in my "favorites" folder to be repeated soon.

Very nice and we will have this again, but QUITE sweet. I will use very little sugar next time-maybe none if my apples are sweet.
Update 11/1/2011: I'm laughing because I planned to use this recipe as a base for my dinner tonight and hadn't realized I had already reviewed it :) Anyway... talk about an autumn meal... I have substituted a very ripe persimmon for the applesauce and chunks of pumpkin for the butternut squash! Used a little less sugar and chicken broth for the wine-It's all in the crock-pot on high right now... I'll let you know how it turns out!2ND UPDATE: Ok, still too sweet. I will remember to leave out all the sugar in this and maybe we will like it more...

Excellent! Not a frequent reviewer but everyone should know how yummy this was!! I made it for my inlaws and it was all eaten up.  Only changes I made was to add 2 chopped apples and after browning I put it all in my slow cooker with the roast right on top, covered the roast in the sauce. 3hrs on high for a 2lb roast. Everyone raved. Served it was creamy risotto. Yum!

I don't know if I did something wrong but after 1 hr 10 min in the oven the middle of my pork was still raw and the squash was hard. It took an additional 45 min to cook. I also cooked it in a stoneware roasting pan so I let it cool and put in the fridge for dinner the next night. everyone made individual plates and reheated in the microwave. this dinner was so good. my kids ate it up and asked for seconds!I will be making again. Thanks for sharing. I bet it's even better the first night, but great leftover!

Honestly, this is the first time that I've ever cooked a pork loin that turned out right!  Delicious.  Make sure you double the squash to four cups.  You will definitely eat it all.  Unlike others, we didn't find it too sweet.  But I did add 1/2 teaspoon of rosemary per someone else's recommendation.

I tried the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious.  Everybody raved and my son who is 24 wanted to make sure the he could get a copy someday so when he out on his own he could make it also.  The beauty of it is that not only does it taste fantastic but it is so easy to prepare.

Five stars all the way! This made excellent use of many ingredients I needed to use up. I did not follow recipe exactly, although I'm sure it would taste great exactly as stated. I use 3 sweet potatoes instead of butternut squash, added a chopped up Braeburn apple, and threw everything into the crockpot. I used the last of my applesauce (exactly 1/2 C. whew!) and then added some water to that jar, the cinnamon, and shook to get the rest of the applesauce out. Added that watery applesauce mixture to the crockpot. Left out all the brown sugar, otherwise followed recipe per Diem. The roast was frozen. Cooked on high 1 hour then low for 5 hours. Excellent!!

I bought a pork loin roast and was looking for a recipe that used some of the seasonal vegetables and fruits I had in my kitchen. The roast had a lot of fat running around the center just like it shows which some people like but I felt like I had to cut a lot just to find meat without fat. There wasn't a great deal of flavor besides being sweet. It wasn't savory like say a pork tenderloin or a beef roast done in a crock pot. My family just thought it was ok not wonderful so will look for another pork recipe next time.

The flavors were very good and this was very easy to prepare.  Only a couple of changes - I did sear it first but then put it in the slow cooker as it was still frozen.  I also used summer squash that I had in the freezer.   Only a few leftovers that didn't last very long :-)  Thanks for sharing. Update - I composed as written but finished it in a slow cooker.  This has become one of our favorites.  So autumn-y Thanks!

We loved this.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used cayenne pepper instead of black pepper and I added a granny smith apple.  Next time I would add two apples but not put them in immediately (they tasted great but almost completely dissolved).  This was a very unique dish - I haven't been this excited about a new recipe in a long time!

Sams Club was running a great price on whole pork loins. So I was looking for something very different to do with one of the loin roasts we'd cut up. All I can say is PERFECT! This was an absolutely delicious dish to make on a cold fall day. It was so simple, even if it had a bit of prep work to it. It's worth every minute! When I bought the squash, my husband wrinkled his nose at it. When I told him what was for dinner, he again looked unimpressed. When it came out of the oven, after an hour of the house smelling WONDERFUL! he still didn't know what to think of the squash. Until he ate a piece. He probably had picked off a whole serving of squash before I even cut into the roast! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Excellent!!  Made this exactly as written with the exception of using an extra cup or so of butternut squash.  My roast was done perfectly in one hour – still moist and juicy.  I loved the squash in this and I also like the idea of adding apples and dried cranberries.  We’ll be repeating this one again!!

I wish I would have read the other reviews before starting because I would have  cut down the amount of sugar in it. The flavor is very good, just too sweet as written. I will definitely make it again with less sugar.

This was really good. As many reviewers suggested I didn't add any sugar.  I was using yams instead of butternut squash and they're so sweet plus the applesauce was already sweet that I didn't see the need for any sugar. I also added a half pound of bacon but I won't do that again just because it was a waste, we couldn't taste it at all.

I did it in my cast iron dutch oven and baked it at 300 for 1 1/2 hrs. It was tender and juicy! The yams and onion were also done to perfection.  We love yams and I am always looking for savory dishes to use them in. They really don't need all the sugar and marshmallows that recipes want you to put on them all the time. Perfect with pork!

This was fantastic!  Love Love Love Love it!  I made a few small changes though,  I did not have applesauce so I blended a cup of apples with the other glaze ingredients in a blender and poured that over the entire dish.  It still turned out great!  If I had applesauce I would definitely put only 1/4 cup of brown sugar unless you really like the sweet.

I also tripled the amount of Butternut squash (didn't see the point of not using the whole thing)and threw in a package of sliced cremini mushrooms.  Still turned out wonderfully and I will be making soup out of the leftover veg (I can almost taste it now!  Yummy!) If I still have any remaining pork by lunch tomorrow I'll turn them into little roast pork sliders on Hawaiian Rolls to serve with the soup.

So easy and oh so delicious!  Now one of my favorite recipes!

This is pretty good and even my picky hubby liked it.  I did not have any butternut squash on hand, so I used plain 'ole potatoes and it still turned out to be a great easy dinner.  Thank you for sharing!

This came out amazing.  I didn't have white wine so I used marsala instead and it was delicious.  I also lessened the amount of brown sugar based on other reviews and threw in a handful of fresh cranberries that I had in the freezer and the tartness really contrasted beautiful with the sweetness of the sauce and the squash.  I overcooked the pork a little bit, but that was my own fault for not setting the timer.  I can't wait to make this again.

It was very good.  maybe person preference, but I think you could cut down on the brown sugar.  Pork was very moist. Butternut squash and applesauce give you a nice compliment and I would cut the sugar by 1/3 next go round - but great potential with just a little fine tuning!

One of my top 5 favorites!  This was the first time I ever cooked with butternut squash.  I added apples to the squash which really added a lot of great flavor.  Next time I will add some dried cranberries too.  Pork was nice and moist.

Company worthy! Was really good with the butternut squash, also added apple slices and dried cranberries. (Didn't have the apple sauce but still tasted good!) Excellent served with cranberry relish on the side.

I had a pork tenderloin to use up and this recipe sounded so good.  I obviously didn't need an hour of roasting time, so I made sure the squash was cut into smaller chunks and 45 minutes later it was done to perfection.  it was wonderful, raves around the table.  Will make again!  Thanks.

I'm not terribly good in the kitchen so I was suprised at how easy and delicious this was! If I can make it successfully, anyone can. I've tried other pork loin recipes with great reviews and have been disappointed. The meat was very tender and soaked in the applesauce mixture perfectly.  The butternut squash was the perfect compliment on a cold rainy Sunday.  My daughter and husband both loved it... will definitely make this again.

Wow! This was absolutely delicious. I used Chicken Broth instead of wine, only because I didn't want to open a bottle of white and it was still good. Oh - and I added a sweet potato which was yummy, too. Absolutely perfect!

Yum!  I used chk broth instead of wine and sweet potatoes instead of squash b/c that's what I had on hand.  I also added some sliced apples.  Husband raved and wanted to be sure I was keeping this recipe somewhere.

My first time posting, this was very good, thou I added garlic pepper and cut up potatoes, and used low fat chicken broth as no wine in house .  With applesauce on the side this was just delicious, like comfort food.

Wonderful veggies especially!  Our slow cooker was running too cool, so hubby upped the temp a bit much, so the meat was overdone before he knew it.  It was dry, however, the youngest kids loved these veggies.  Yum!!!  I'll make just the veggies with these seasonings again.  I'll let my hubby decide if he wants the pork again (I pass on pork these days).

I made this as written in my LeCruset. Unlike other reviewers, I found the pork dry, pink in the middle, and the squash was overcooked, almost to mush. I wonder if the temp got too hot inside the cast iron pan. It may be easy but I won’t be making it again.

Scrumptious! I probably didn’t cook it long enough. The pork was a little tough, but when I reheated it the next day, it was perfect. I was nervous about peeling the squash. I popped it in the microwave, whole, for a 1 minute and it was very easy to peel with a vegetable peeler. Definitely will make again.

I left out the brown sugar and cinnamon because it sounded way too sweet.  After browning the roast, I put it all in the oven, covered, at 225,  for about 6 hours.  It's pretty fantastic.

We did not have any butternut squash, so I substituted potatoes. I also did not have apples sauce, but had apples. I cubed the apples and added them. Wonderful!
We served this with a side of sauerkraut. It was wonderful!

I have made this a couple of times now. My family is not a big fan of squash, so the second time I substituted red potatoes (4C cubed- skin on). Good flavors and makes a pretty plate. Very easy, although if you get a pork roast with twine mesh , you lose the nice toppings. I usually remove the twine mesh and re-tie the roast with bakers string. It’s easier to remove.

Absolutely wonderful!  Roast was 6.5 lbs.  Squash resulted in over 4 C of cubes.  Used a small lunch single applesauce and 2 Pippin apples in SMALL cubes...Cinnamon and the sugar.  Basically, followed the recipe and method in a 3.5 qt. LeCrueset Casserole Pot....this meal fed 2 of us over a week.  Near end I separated items serving fresh boiled Spinach and and mixed a cooked medium sweet potato with the left juice and squash...then mashed....Oh my!  Really good meal(s)!!!

Really perfect for a fall weather supper. I used sweet potatoes instead of butternut because we have loads from our garden. I also used apples chopped up. Just yummy and warm!

My husband loved this recipe. Kids not so much but they are it. I’ll make it again but with double the sauce as I liked the flavour and it would have put it over the top being able to have some as a gravy. I also used chunked frozen sweet potatoes instead of winter squash. And had no white white so I used a hard cider.

My wife rated this as AWESOME. However, the recipe forgot to say what to do with the wine! I mixed it with the cinnamon, brown sugar and applesauce, and it turned out perfectly!

This is totally my favorite recipe - always yummy!  The pork is tender and the sauce is wonderful.  I’ve taken to adding an apple or two peeled and sliced.  Since there are only 2 of us we cut a large tenderloin in 1/2 and freeze the other for a later Pork delight.  Hard part cutting the butternut squash in 4ths.

My family usually complains pork is dry and tough but this recipe takes care of that.  I did not have apple sauce so I put a cut apple in with the squash and onions and used chicken broth instead of wine, there was enough juice to cook the veggies well, have a tasty sauce.  roasted in a covered dutch oven for a little over an hour for a 2.15 roast but could have cooked a little less.  Everyone loved it!

Followed the recipe as written. Pre browned the pork, and put it in with the veggies for 1 hour and gave an add'l 10 minutes. I checked it and it was still pink in the center and the squash not completely soft. So I kicked up the temp. to 375 for another 35 minutes the last 15 of that uncovered. Rested the 10 minutes out of the oven and it was perfect. Delicious flavor, the family loved it.

I added two chopped apples with the squash and onion and in the interest of calorie counting, cut the sugar down to one Tablespoon which was perfect.  I also  used apple cider in place of sauce (because it's what I had on hand) and added an extra cup of water so I could slow cook it. Cooked at 250 for four hours, and it was fork tender and delicious. To not kill our diets I served it with fresh steamed green beans and husband loved it in spite of presence of veggies. It's a keeper!

I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and added two Granny Smith apples, peeled and sliced to the vegetables. Divided the sauce mixture and slathered about half of it on the roast prior to roasting. About halfway through, slathered the other half of the sauce on the pork. Scattered ½ cup of dried cranberries on the vegetables. While pork rested, tented in foil, I spooned the vegetables out of the Dutch oven, using a slotted spoon. Simmered the sauce until it started to thicken just a bit. Poured sauce over vegetables and served with the pork. I will make again. It's good....really good.

This was really good and made the whole house smell fantastic. I eliminated the sugar and used sweetened applesauce and three gala apples so the sweetness was minimal but had a nice sweet after taste. The pork and vegetables were the star. Great. I used everything I had and glad I did. As someone pointed out, add more of everything, squash, carrots, red potato, whatever, you'll be glad you did. This is day two so can't wait to try the leftovers. I would not be disappointed if I ordered this in a restaurant and it came out this way.

This is easy and fantastic! Whole family loved it. I would suggest making your own apple sauce for this vs store bought...makes a HUGE difference in flavor (just slice up a couple Granny Smiths, put in sauce pot with 1/4 c water and a tsp white or brown sugar; bring to boil and simmer 15 min or til tender, mash up a bit). I've made it as is, and I've varied it as well by adding carrots and sweet potato...I've also added a Tbsp of cider vinegar on occasion...comes out great every time!

I made this tonight and it was a hit!  Like some other reviewers, I added a couple of apples as well and cut the brown sugar down to a quarter cup.  I had a three and a half pound pork butt roast so I cooked it for 2.5 hours and tented the foil for the last hour to thicken the sauce.  Next time I think I will add carrots but this was excellent just as it was.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This pork roast turned out moist and delicious!  Even my picky daughter enjoyed eating this.  I didn't have squash and the family doesn't like onions so I omitted those.  I put the browned pork roast in a covered glass dish on top of the cooked wine and poured the sauce over the roast.  I probably won't use as much cinnamon next time but I will definitely be making this again.

Made it just as the recipe called for- so good!  Don't rush the end - let the roast sit for at least 10 minutes (it continues to cook and seals in the flavor). Served it up on a serving platter with squash around it, poured some of the juices back over top it after I sliced it...

This was amazing!!!!!  I didn't have applesauce, so I left it out, and it turned out great.  So moist, juicy, and flavorful.  I let it cook 2 hours so the meat was incredibly tender.  It is our new favorite!

Now my go to recipe for pork loin. I added three apples with the squash and onions the first time, and used sweet potatoes the second time in place of the squash. So fabulous!

This recipe is awesome! The saltiness of the pork was balanced well with the sweet sauce and squash. I added a diced red apple but followed the recipe as written otherwise. Perfect fall weather dish and good one to add my collection.

My entire family loved this recipe!!  I used fresh garlic, added fresh mushrooms and omitted the squash (only because I didn't have).  It was out of this world!!!

Okay so I have never left a review before but I felt this recipe was worthy of praise! I use allrecipes frequently for quick meals for the hubster and I came across this one when I couldn't decide what to make with a butternut squash. All I have to say is this recipe is beyond amazing! It is such a great fall meal and stamped with my husbands seal of approval! The only thing I might do differently next time is cut down on the sugar a bit. This is a must make recipe!!

This was a scrumpious roast.  I like the presentation of this and the blend of flavors in it.  I added some dried (re-hydrated) apple to this as I wanted plenty of apple flavor and need to use the dried apple I have.  Other than that I made it as written.  Loved what it did for the squash!  I will be making this again.

Smelled delicious while in the oven and tasted just as good as it smelled. Used cubed sweet potatoes instead of butternut squash because that's what I had on hand.  I did add a little thyme but otherwise followed the recipe.  My husband loved it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

My husband and boys are not big fans of pork, but this recipe made them change their minds. The pork was tender and the sauce made for a great addition to the meat. I will definitely make it again!

Loved this recipe. I was out of apple sauce so I just blended up an apple which I think probably made it better, the apple flavor was amazing. I also used carrots instead of butternut squash and they were really good. I did it in the crock pot and just added a little water with the carrots so that it wouldn't go dry while it cooked all day about 6 hours. My husband couldn't stop talking about how good it was.

Ok - I did not follow it EXACTLY, but didn't change very much at all.

Didn't have wine - used hard apple cider.
Added two chopped apples
Added a ton of fresh chopped garlic to the applesauce mixture

Otherwise - everything else was dead on the original.

It was FANTASTIC!!!!  Absolutely a keeper, and elegant enough to serve for company.  YUM!!!!

Excellent! I used maple syrup instead of brown sugar, and it added to the seasonal flavor! Also threw in some carrots since my husband doesn't like squash! Made for a wonderful fall meal!

This was such a delicious fall recipe! Everyone greatly enjoyed. I followed recipe as written. But I did not have white wine, so I replaced with beef broth. It was moist and everything had a wonderful flavor. Next time, I will just add more butternut squash because everyone loved it so much.

I'm not a lover of pork but this recipe made me want seconds! I did not have squash, but did have potatoes and pearl onions and the sauce was fantastic on them too! Will make again-maybe even try it on beef roast

I have made this recipe twice and my husband and I both love it. I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and added two peeled sliced Granny Smith .  I browned the pork in a large cast iron skillet and baked it covered with foil. The pork tenderloin was so tender you could cut it with a fork. This is a delicious recipe for butternut squash and pork.  I will definitely be making this again!

Discovered a new way to cook pork.  It was delicious and made the house smell wonderful.  The only change I made was using sweet potatoes instead of squash because I didn't have any on hand.  The roast was flavorful, moist and the resulting broth was very tasty as well.  I didn't read others reviews, but can't wait to add garlic, dried cranberries and apples.  Yummy.

I've made this recipe dozens of times. It's my teen-age sons favorite. I've tried it with the squash but prefer it with just sweet onions. Other then that I've altered nothing, except omitting the cinnamon because my spouse doesn't like it. Delicious!

Wow! This was really tasty! Must admit, I didn't think it would be as I was making it but after the favors blended - Wow! I did make several changes but the flavor, I think, would basically be the same. I followed all of step 1 but I only had Moscato so used that instead of dry white wine. I added only 1/2 an onion and 2 cut up apples (didn't have applesauce either) to the juice in the pan. Didn't have squash so omitted that. Mixed up all the other ingredients and added the mixture to the pan and simmered for a bit. Then, since I wanted to use my crock pot, I put 1/2 the mixture from the pan in my crock, put the browned roast in, then the rest of the mixture! Left it on high for about 4+ hours and it was fall apart tender so tasty! Will definitely make this again!

This was the most flavorful, delicious, moist roast I have ever made, or ever even eaten! :0) The only thing I did different was double the topping to add more flavor and some extra sauce :0) Loved this one!!!

We liked it; didn't love it - but we are NOT Squash eaters and hoped that by dressing up the squash that we would like it more.  I rated this 4 stars because, I must say, the meat had an awesome flavour, so you cannot go wrong with this marinade/coating.  I did as another reviewer suggested and added potatoes to the mix.  Next time, I might skip the squash and do carrots and potatoes.  I did only use 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and truly, it was sweet enough, and that's after using unsweetened apple sauce.  Also added dried thyme and some leftover cranberry sauce (so that could account for some of the sweetness), but the flavour of the sauce was super yummy.  Obviously a very versatile and forgiving sauce; what's better than a one pot meal?

I tried this tonight and my family loved it!  Super quick and easy!!!  I think you need to make sure you use good grainy dijon mustard (not the creamy one) and this is awesome!  I also just added some yukon potatos cut up in chunks as I was going to make mashed potatos but then just added them instead.   My husband said this was "resturant quality" which I was very happy with!  Will make again!
