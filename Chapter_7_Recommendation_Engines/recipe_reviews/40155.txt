Good! I did make some modifications. I melted some butter in a saucepan, and then sauted mushrooms in the butter. Added about a tablespoon or two of flour and cooked for 1-2 minutes. Then I added the cream. I added a couple ounces of grated asiago cheese, too. For the pesto, I reduced the parmesan since I had added some asiago to the cream. I salt and peppered the sauce after I had combined the pesto and the cream. Next time, I will add garlic to saute with the mushrooms because I like a more garlicky sauce. In a separate pan, I cooked cubes of chicken breast seasoned with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning in olive oil. When the chicken was just about cooked, I threw some prosciutto in there as well. I added the chicken and prosciutto to the cream sauce (using a slotted spoon so the sauce woulodn't get too oily) at the end to heat it through again.

my family really enjoys this recipe.  i serve it over chicken and tortellini.  the only thing i do different is i make a rue w/whole wheat flour w/ a dollop of butter before adding the cream.  this thickens it up a bit.  i also use almonds instead of pine nuts...for no particular reason except we like almonds.

this is good, a basic pesto sauce with cream. using a neutral oil will be just as good when making a sauce solely for reheating. if stored in the refrigerator before adding the cream, keeps forever.

I looked at many recipes before I settled on this one. This recipe is quick, easy, delicious, and uses many common household ingredients. I did make made a few changes to the recipe. To the sauce, I added extra garlic and used half parmesean and half romano cheese. I also used heavy whipping cream because that's what I had at home, but will probably use 1/2 and 1/2 next time to make it a little healthier. I used farfalle pasta and added boiled chicken, then poured the sauce over it all, tossed it, and enjoyed. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make again!

Amazing!  Before the last step, (heat & thicken)  I sauteed shallots and baby portabellas in a tbsp. of butter and poured the cream sauce into the pan to heat & mix. I also used only a tbsp. of olive oil & half and half.

Good recipe to add to.  I made a few additions- sauteed mushrooms, diced tomatoes, cubed chicken, and a little tomato sauce.  I poured it over fettuccini.  I was so pleased with the results, I used the recipe for my wedding entree.

I haven't received feedback from my family yet, but I love this sauce.  I used farfalle pasta. The recipe provides enough flexibility to add other good things, such as chicken, shrimp, tomatoes, mushrooms, etc.  I ate my first bowl without adding anything and it was "just right."  Then, I put an 8 ounce chicken breast in the microwave and tasted a few bites with chicken. Wow.  Even better, it was.  I recommend that you wait until the sauce is almost done before adding salt and pepper.  You probably won't need much seasoning.  It looks like I need to get ready to grow basil again this year.  I can see that I'll be having this recipe again and again!

Yum! Oh my goodness, soo delicious!

I used almonds instead of pine nuts and half and half instead of cream. I mixed the remaining half of the liquid in the pan with a bit of flour and cream cheese to thicken it up. I also added another garlic clove, a few dashes of onion salt, pepper, oregano, and dash of sugar.

I divided the recipe in half and still had plenty for 5 or 6 servings, due to the fact that I kept adding milk and half and half in an attempt to thin it out a bit. . . still very thick. I served it with basil garlic shrimp over spinach pasta from this site. This is one of those meals that makes me wonder why I even bother going out to eat. . . it doesn't get better than this! Try it! Thanks for an amazing recipe! :)

Great recipe! Omitted the pine nuts and added a bit more garlic in their place (I'm a big fan of garlic); I also used very light olive oil- just my preference. I followed the instructions and it turned out great. It's light, creamy and very 'fresh' tasting (thank you, basil!) 
The perfect compliment to my oven baked salmon- so yummy!

Oh, Caution- this makes a HUGE amount of sauce! Not too much of a problem for us, because it Does reheat without issue and, it turns out, is also tasty on rice and chicken :). Maybe next time I will halve the recipe or just be ready to freeze the leftovers for later.

**And yes, this *is* a basil sauce- naturally the primary flavor is basil, so if you're not looking for that, I'd steer clear. (Not sure why you'd make a basil sauce if you don't like basil, but hey- no judgement here! :) ).

My other half loved this. I took the advice of others and sauteed mushrooms and garlic, then added the cream. Next time we are adding prosciutto.

Fabulous!!  This recipe was exactly what i have been searching for. Flavorful, creamy, and fresh!!! I substituted almonds instead of using the pine nuts. This is wonderful over chicken, pasta and even rice.

This was a very tasty, easy sauce to make.  I followed other suggestions here and thickened the sauce with a rue of melted butter and flour.  I also used half and half instead of light cream simply because I didn't have the cream on hand.  Very similar in flavor to Maggiano's Basil Cream Sauce that they serve over ravioli in their restaurants.  I'll be honest and say that next time I believe I will roast the garlic cloves before adding them to the basil since the raw garlic flavor was a bit overpowering at first.  My family loves fresh grated parmesan cheese so I added extra to the sauce and then grated some over top of our ravs.  I could see serving this to guests with pan seared chicken and pasta.

I grow basil in my Aerogarden, and this is an excellent way to use it. It was a big hit. I added cooked, bite-sized pieces of chicken and served it over spaghetti noodles. Thanks for a great recipe.

Really tasty, but it came out rather thinner at the end than I would have liked.  Added a flour/butter "clay" to the pot, still simmering, to improve consistency.

I made a few modifications to this sauce; I doubled the garlic and added crushed red pepper and 8 ounces of fresh roasted (and peeled) green chile. The fresh green chile might be difficult to find (the canned stuff is better than nothing, I guess)- it's a staple in New Mexico but rarely anywhere else. I believe the Anaheim green chile is the next closest thing.

I served it over cheese & spinach tortellini with sliced-up grilled chicken from the night before.

It was a definite hit - I'll be making it again soon. Thanks!

Not an especially impressive sauce. Good because it's quick and easy, but you may as well buy some pesto.

Yum!! Fast and so easy! I used fat free milk instead of cream that I thickened with corn starch in the microwave! Next time I will add a dash of red pepper flakes.  I will be making this again and again.  Perfect for company-just add shrimp or chicken, top with fresh diced tomatoes, chopped basil and a bit of fresh parmesan! Like I said...Yum!!!

This was an easy and tasty quick meal to make. My 11 year-old nephew made this for his family, as I assisted him in the kitchen.  I might suggest 3 cloves of garlic for next time, as it was very flavorful.

Great sauce! 2 things that make it WONDERFUL- add lemon zest and nutmeg to the pesto sauce before combining with the cream sauce.

Good and creamy sauce - my only change was to lightly toast the pine nuts first - this gave it a subtle smokey flavor. Tastes great on tri-color pasta with garbanzo beans; baked chicken; toasted garlic bread; etc.

Absolutley excellent! I was searching for something to pair with my chicken and proscuitto tortellini, and this couldn't have been more amazing. My grocery store didn't have regular basil, so I opted for fresh lime basil, and I added just a touch more oil to get things blended better, since I was using a super small food processor. My dinner guest was thrilled with this sauce, she loved how much you could taste the pinenuts. This is a staple in my recipe box! :) THANK YOU

This was amazing. I used heavy cream instead and more garlic. I also garnished with more pine nuts. I will be making this a lot. I love basil and this is fragrant and well infused with the best kind - fresh basil! So good I was eating it before I put it on the pasta!

I poured this sauce over sauteed procuitto, mushrooms and peas with tortelini. It was WONDERFUL. All my co-workers want the recipe. Instead of warming the cream as desecribed in the recipe, I microwaved small amounts for 30 seconds each as I added it to the food processor.

We thought this was ok but not great.  We served over pasta and with salmon.  I liked it with the salmon although my husband didn't think it 'matched' quite right.

Great sauce! I blanched it beforehand to retain it's verdant color.  However, I found the sauce to be too thick, so I added some water.  That seemed to do the trick.  Next time, I will substitue with whole milk instead to thin it out.  I would definitely make this again!

Very good! I couldn't find pine nuts in my local grocery store so I used ready-made pesto and heavy cream and it turned out great but seemed to be missing something. We tossed the sauce with tri-color pasta and shrimp and it was very excellent!

The sauce had a nice smooth consistency and basil has such a lovely flavor, but I think this is a better starter sauce. . . it was a bit bland for my taste.  will reavulate once i perfect recipe.

This was great!  My husband can't have tomatoes so I'm always looking for different sauces to use with pasta.  I made stuffed pasta shells the other night and made this sauce for him and a marinara sauce for everyone else.  When they tasted his, everyone wanted some of the basil cream sauce!  Thanks Ayanna!

Came out delicious! Had to  keep it old school and use a mortar since I don't own a food processor. Even my picky mother that only admits to liking her own cooking told me it was delicious and cleaned her plate. I'm looking forward to making it again.

This was a great sauce, I made a few modifications- Half & half instead of cream which I used about 8oz + 2T of butter.  Also, I threw everything in the food processor at once except for the olive oil, it didn't seem necessary to do it in 2 steps.  Added more garlic because I always add more garlic :)  Tossed it with fusilli, some of the pasta water and two large, diced, tomatoes.  My boyfriend and I loved it.

This was great! Added some garlic powder instead of garlic since that's what I had. As suggested, made a roux from butter and flour and then added the cream and whisked often until thickened. This will be my new go-to white sauce.

I made some changes... I used half the amount of basil and used sage, artichoke hearts & a couple green olives. When the sauce came together I served it with sausage and ravioli. It was AMAZING!

not too bad not too bad! It does taste a little flat to me, but its highly likely that I ended up substituting some of the fresh basil with dried (oops!) it did take more than 5 minutes to thicken up for me though.

This one rocketed instantly to "company fare". I used blanched almonds instead of pine nuts because that's what I had. Likewise monteray jack instead of parmesan. I'm sure it would be fabulous made as posted, though.  I also added a tbsp salted butter. Beautiful.

Bland.  Looks good on pasta so it gets 3 stars.  No flavor.  Consider adding salt.  Regardless of processing time, there is a gritty/chunky texture in the sauce.  Would not make this again.

It's good! Mine turned out a little too chunky, but I might have over-measure the nuts or under-processed. I will process more thoroughly next time, everything kept sticking to the sides of my processor so it was tough to get the right consistency. I've been mixing the leftover sauce with mayo and using it as an aioli spread.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because I had to make some adjustments since I didn't have some of the ingredients and so I was never able to make the exact recipe. However, I used most of the ingredients and did the directions and it was very delicious! I didn't have any nuts so I omitted the nuts. I added more parmesan cheese. I didn't have any cream so I ended up making a rue with flour and butter, heating it with a tbsp of cream cheese and added 1%milk. I also added a little cornstarch to thicken it up a little more and it turned out great! I put it over noodles and chicken. So, in the end it was the base recipe with just a few adjustments. I definitely recommend this!

Very time consuming. Followed directions except used less cream. Extra parmesan cheese and cayanne pepper will help the bland taste. I ran out of parmesan so I used alfredo sauce which is parmesan and cream and it worked perfect. I sauteed mushrooms with chicken. I topped it off with drained diced can tomatoes.

This was phenominal! My fiance didn't care for it very much, but I thought it was awesome. I've never had pesto before, and I'm in love with it now! I followed the recipe exactly and used 12 oz of linguini. The only thing that was difficult is that I do not have a food processor. I used a blender, and it was a bit time consuming, as I had to keep shutting it off and pushing the leaves down to try and chop them up.

Sorry, we didn't really enjoy this. It was pretty bland. At the end, I added lemon juice and salt in an attempt to give it more flavor-still wouldn't make again. Loved the spring green color though!

I've made people into pesto believers with this sauce (though when you add cream to anything, it's pretty much a winner).  Awesome with chicken, could even work with italian sausage.  So good and well worth the work!!

This was tasty served over whole wheat pasta and diced chicken. I found it to be a bit bland. Next time I'll toast the pine nuts first as well as add an extra clove of garlic. I also think that cooking pancetta with the chicken would increase the oomph of this solid basic sauce.

I made this for dinner for a diverse group of all ages. My husband was skeptical but it was DELICIOUS!!!! It was a little hard to thicken, so I recommend stirring in some cornstarch, but put it over any kind of pasta. We grilled chicken and sliced it up too, and it was wonderful!

Thank you for this recipe. My herb garden is overrun with basil, and I have been lookig for some new ways to use it up. This sauce is so flavorful. I will make this again and again. It also freezes great, I defrosted a bag yesterday and served it over sausage tortellini. With a mixed salad and some garlic bread it tasted like I spent hours in the kitchen :)

It was so simple and completely delicious.  Not too heavy, but rich with flavor.  We had it over a squash ravioli, which was fab. Can't wait to try it other ways!

Excellent recipe. I added it to bite size chicken pieces and artichoke hearts in fettuccne noodles. Love it! I used 6 cloves garlic and half & half.  Sent hubby to store for light cream, he couldn't find it so got this. PERFECT

Very nice sauce.  I made the pesto the night before so the flavors could develop.  Used a couple more cloves of garlic as we love it.  My hubby liked this better than just pesto on the rigatoni I made.

Very good recipe. I blanched the basil first by submerging it in boiling water for 15 seconds, then plunging it into ice water, then draining. This helps to maintain the green color. I'm using it tonight on top of butternut squash. Thanks!

A great basic pesto recipe (which can be modified to your taste) with cream. I add some heavy cream (for flavour) and top up the rest with milk, to make it a little healthier. It's very rich!

I was really looking forward to this dish.Unfortunately I was very disappointed.In my opinion the sauce had a foul taste as well as a foul odor.My husband who eats everything said he did'nt think it had any flavor--will not make this again.

Tweaked it by subbing 1 tbps dried basil and 1 tbsp dried parsely for the fresh basil. Used extra virgin olive oil for the roux. Added 1/2 c organic chicken stock. Upped cheese to 2/3 c. Very nice multi-purpose base sauce, almost any cheese will work. I use it for baked pasta dishes.

LOVED IT! However, I also made a little change as another reviewer stated to make a rue with some butter and flour before adding the cream. Also, I used Half and Half instead because it's what I had available and it truly turned out amazing. We really like things to be extra garlicky, so I used six cloves of garlic rather than four, but I'm sure four would've be absolutely yummy for those who don't go crazy for that extra kick. Definitely will be making this again.

My pesto sauce lost its green appearance after mixing in the cream. I measured 2 cups of basil leaves but maybe I was supposed to pack them in the measuring cup tighter.

Also, there wasn't enough sauce to properly coat 2 lbs of noodles. I will have to triple the recipe next time and only cook 1 lb of linguine to get the proper sauce to pasta ratio because I can taste the potential. 

Overall, this is a quality recipe. I just need to work out the kinks on my end because I'm new to cooking this dish and cooking in general as you have probably already noticed. Ha

I'm new to basil, and this sauce is my new favorite using it. I made the mistake of planting the basil with tiny leaves, so it took forever to harvest enough -- next time, I'm going for the giant ones, lol -- but the sauce is well worth the effort. I served it over farfalle with blackened shrimp, and my husband and I both loved it. My only changes were to add a bit of oregano and using cornstarch to thicken it a bit. Thanks!

Turned out great!  I ended up searing pork medallions then finishing the cooking in the sauce on the stovetop (reserving some for later)then topping it with fresh sauce.   Turned out fantastic!  Will make again!

I didn't have pine nuts, so it missed that flavor that it typical with pesto, but still good.  Easy to make.

This sauce is perfect for the type of dish I was going for. It has a very savory flavor from the basil and garlic. One added thing I loved was how it reheated without issue. The family enjoyed the leftovers.

I halved the recipe and used a mini-processor.  I used jarred garlic and mostly half-and-half with a little milk. Nice flavor and went well over angel hair pasta. Will be good over ravioli gnocchi another time.

This was easy, but I didn't think it was anything special.  I mixed  20 oz of tortellini into it and it was too much sauce.  I added 1/2 pound of cooked broccoli the next day and that seemed to be a better ratio of stuff to sauce.  The ground nuts act as a thickening agent, so if you choose to skip them, you'll need to thicken the sauce a different way.

Yummy! Real easy to make, although used almonds instead. Super yummy on some spinach and ricotta manicottis, or just toasted french bread for appetizer. The boyfriend gets so excited whenever I make this!

Good basic recipe. Required a little more seasonings than the recipe called for and it needed to be thickened with cornstarch. Very pleased with end results,

This  sauce was  excellent!  However, because I am a health nut, I used culinary dairy free coconut milk from "So Delicious" instead of the cream.  It was still yummy, and the only downside of this sauce, and this was most likely because of the coconut milk, is that the texture was a bit funny, but overall I do recommend this.

This sauce was great! I needed a good, easy, recipe to make with my girlfriend since we were both not happy with store-bought sauces. We only did one cup of basil because 2 cups seemed like a bit much and we forgot to add the pine nuts but it was still great. id recommend this to anyone who wants to have a "make it yourself" date night. (If you LOVE basil, do the full 2 cups. If you just LIKE it, only do 1 cup.)

Yum! Used a heavier cream because that's what I had so diluted it with milk. Very easy to make and a HUGE HIT in my house! I made it last week and making it again this week.

Tried it this weekend with one chopped roma tomato, 1/2 a red pepper, one can of artichokes, fresh baby spinach sautéd in olive oil and grilled chicken over fettucini noodles. Should have been the spinach fettucini, but could not find at the super market I was at. The added ingredients meant I had to cook sauce a bit longer for it to thicken, but it was a hit and I'll definitely make it again.

I added about 1/2 cup more Parm because my family is cheese crazy, but it retained the basil flavor and was a wonderful sauce. Perfect for Lenten Friday, a nice change of pace from tomato based sauces.

the recipe was a bit bland, so i added some sun-dried tomatoes to liven it up. there was a bit too much cream. a bit watery even after using less cream than required, so i had to add flour and extra parmesan (like some of the others) to firm up my sauce.

once it was fixed up, it was delicious! all was gone in one night!

Yum!  I've never made pesto before and this recipe is a good reason to make it again!  I used almonds b/c it's what I had on hand.  I took 1/4 c. of the pesto (before adding salt, pepper, and cream) and mixed it with 2 oz. of butter and 2 oz. of cream cheese (from another reviewer's suggesiton).  It made the most delicious spread!

Awesome - the only way to go with Pesto. the cream really makes it. I've used raw almonds in place of pine nuts and it turned out wonderfully.

I used this more as guidelines and my version came out very well.  I wanted to double it for 2 boxes of pasta, so I used about 1 1/2 pints of half & half, (I also cheated majorly and bought premade pesto) 2 containers of pesto, 1/2 a container of ricotta cheese, about 1 cup grated parmesan cheese, and then after stirring it FOREVER and it not really thickening, I threw in enough flour for it to thicken to my liking.  I put this over some sauteed eggplant, onion, mushrooms, & peapods and tossed it with fettuccini and it was delightful... especially for my lactose intolerant hubby :)

Incredible! This is the second time I have made it to put over chicken and we just sop up the extras off our plate with the rolls. I use fresh basil from my garden. Couldn't get any better! Thanks for a great recipe.

I loved this recipe, I made the mistake of putting the cream in before the nuts (I used roasted almonds) which messed a bit with the consistency but delicious. I like others had to thicken the sauce with a flour rue but this is a suject of personal preference. Although in doing this I should have put in additional garlic clove, more basil and a touch more parm. My boyfriend and I put this over homemade pasta for lunch the next day. He really liked it and this man doesnt fib when it comes to food. YUM

I made this for lunch yesterday and served it with Ozro with Parmesan and Basil from this site. I used soy milk rather than the cream and thickened slightly cornstarch. Very nice taste enjoyed by our entire family...even my 10-year old son who does not give in easily to the site of something green on his plate. My daughter happily ate the leftovers today for lunch.

This so great as is...the only changes I make is to use almonds instead of pine nuts (cost) and sometimes add sundried tomaotes at the end.  This sauce is great over any pasta, but esp. tortelini or raviloli.

This was awesome.  I had no cream and didn't want to hit the store, so I substituted half of a package of lowfat cream cheese and 1/2 cup of 1% milk heated and mixed smooth. I'm sure it would be much better with the cream, but at least this was low in fat. Thanks again.

I scaled by half but used closer to 1 1/2 cups of basil to use up what I had left.  It does need salt but I don't salt because there is enough in the parm that gets grated on top.  Tossed with pennette and topped with garlic butter sautéed bay scallops.

I made this for a pasta and chicken dish. I made the pesto a day in advance (storing in the fridge) so that I would have less prep while guests were here: all I had to do was add it to the cream. It worked great and received positive feedback from the guests!

Awesome.  I did not add the cream, as I was freezing my sauce for later use.  I can not wait to use it w/ cream.  I did use the Basil Pesto w/ the Pesto-Stuffed Pork Chop w/ Carmelized onion recipe and it was really good. I am planning on making more to freeze before the weather turns.

This was very light. Almost too light. It would be nice as a side dish but I woulnd't eat it on its own. I'm not sure if I will make this again.

This sauce is delicious! My family and friends loved it and the best part was that it was so easy to make!
I poured it over 3 cheese tortellini's for a yummy Italian dinner.

Very tasty, but it's a tad bit bland. I've only made this once and my family enjoyed it, but it could definitely be improved. I'm not experienced enough with sauces to say exactly what would do the trick.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I made it for my picky family and they loved it!!  I added the cubed chicken (coated with flour) and mushrooms that were suggested by another poster and it really added to the meal.  Wonderful!!

Loved this. Even my very fussy husband likes it. I've made it a few times and most recently was a hit with the in-laws. I didn't even get to have seconds because it was GONE!

This was a great basic recipe the first time I tried it.  EASY and FAST.  The second time around, I added a little more garlic and used 1/8 c. of SWEET whipping cream (aka Baker's Cream) instead of using only the light cream.  The sweet dash was killer over seafood ravioli.  The THIRD time I used this recipe, I still added garlic but went back to the regular cream and added red pepper flakes.  All three servings were a hit with adults and my 4 kids.  Definitely a great recipe!!

This was a perfect side dish to a stuffed chicken recipe we made. I wanted something creamy yet zesty to go with it. It was just right!

Not overly happy with this sauce.  In my opinion there was far too much Basil, one cup would be more than enough and the use of light cream also made it rather bland.  Not a favourite and wouldn't make it again.

My family LOVED this sauce! Personaly, I thought it was a bit mild and will probably add a bit more garlic next time. It was great for the kids though. I served it the 2nd time as left-overs and used cheese tortallini. It does warm up very nicely. I can't wait to add mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes and chicken next time.

I followed the recipe exactly and found this sauce to be wonderful!  Easy to make and very tasty.  We tossed it with pasta and shrimp ~ yummy!  We will definitely be making this recipe again.  Thanks for creating it!  (I love this website).
