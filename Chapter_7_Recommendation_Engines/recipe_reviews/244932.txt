Soooooo GOOD!!!  I did change it up slightly.  

Used garbanzo beans (AKA: chick peas) instead of black beans

Left out the mint (not a fan of mint for some reason)

Added some fresh squeezed lemon and a little garlic (starting to think this gets added to pretty much everything I make!)

Stop! Don't pass up this recipe. It is awesome! The ingredients list may seem like it was randomly chosen out of thin air, but you've gotta trust me, this is so good. Don't change a thing.

Since one of my resolutions for the New Year was to eat better, it was tough to pass up an appetizer called "Skinny Dipping."  I made it for guests and most found it surprisingly good in spite of the strange list of ingredients.  We couldn't decide if it was latin or mediterranean, but it was a hit with most.  I served it with sliced cucumbers and orange and red peppers, as well as tortilla chips.  The peppers were the hands-down favorite.

I am a person who loves to try new things, the more unique the better, and was so excited to try this!   Unfortunately both my husband and I thought it was awful and had to toss it.  

The only thing I changed was to add half the amount of dried herbs instead of fresh.  Needless to say it will not be made again.  Sorry.

I made this last weekend and it turned out good. My daughter uses it as a snack after school each day with pita bread or chips. I had all of the ingredients at home except for the mint so had to leave that out.

An interesting recipe. Definitely "tastes healthy" so don't expect your typical dip flavor from this. In fact, it's a bit hard to describe but definitely has a bean base with some tang from the yogurt plus a complex flavor from the fresh herbs. I think next time I might skip the mint and swap for garlic. Went well with tortilla chips and baby carrots. A good healthy alternative!
