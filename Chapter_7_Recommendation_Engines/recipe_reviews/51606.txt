To achieve a more brownie-like consistency, I used 8oz. of white chocolate instead of 6oz.  I removed them from the oven at exactly 25 minutes.  Love to almond flavor!  Family gobbled them up.  Also, to simplify the prep, I melted the chocolate and the butter together.  Worked perfectly.

It was alright, more cakey than brownie.  I would use 1 cup of flour next time.  Substituted 225 gr of white chocolate chips instead of the white bakers chocolate (that's all I had), and vanilla extract for almond extract.  Recipe needs some tweeking, but it was tasty nonetheless.

I didn't add any almond, and I made it look tye dye. I did this by seperating the batter, then added the colors I wanted to each portion, poured them all into the pan (one at a time) and swirled with a fork!

After trying several recipes for white chocolate brownies, I finally hit the jackpot with this one. Tender, moist, and delicious...what more can I say? I'm a frosting girl, and used melted white chocolate chips, sugar, milk, and butter to make a melt-in-your-mouth addition to this wonderful bar. I highly recommend this recipe for all the white chocolate lovers out there!

The brownies did turn out to be a bit more cake like than brownies. I also thought they were a little floury. All in all they were not bad but i will play around with the recipe a little bit.  I also added a raspberry toping which complimented the white chocolate

We did not care for these.  My kids love white chocolate and these just don't taste like white chocolate once they are baked.  They just taste like a really sweet white cake.  I made the recipe as written, but we will probably stick with making our brownies with cocoa from now on.

the taste is lovely, but I have to agree with other reviewers that this is not a "brownie".  It is far too cake-like to be a brownie.  For those who are looking for a true "white chocolate brownie" with a brownie consistency, I'm afraid you'll have to use another recipe.  This is, however, a delicious white chocolate cake and would be a great for an afternoon tea :)

I made these exactly according to the recipe and did not like them at all.  They were more cake like, which was o.k., but extremely dry and no taste whatsoever.  I will not try these again.  Ended up throwing the entire pan out.

"brownies" is something of a misnomer, but this dish is a keeper!!  Just the thing to serve with coffee when a friend pops in.

Delicious!  All three kids loved these.  I somewhat agree with other reviewers that they are not completely 'fudgy' like brownies, but they aren't really cakey either - somewhere in between.  In any case, the slight almond flavor is incredible and I will be making these again!  To simplify, I melted the chocolate and butter together in a bowl over simmering water and it worked great.

This was very easy to put together and baked up nicely in exactly 25 minutes. I did not have sliced almonds, so left them off, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The texture is a bit more cakelike than brownie-like, but it is a very nice, mild white chocolate snack cake. Would make a great base for some other flavors, mix-ins or toppings. Thanks for sharing!

I doubled the recipe and made in a jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper so i could bring these to work. As i have coworkers that don't like nuts,I wasn't sure what to do to boost the presentation so i drizzled caramel and chocolate sauces over the top and marbled it prior to baking. They look and taste fantastic. I think the taste is kind of like a sugar cookie, but a really good sugar cookie! I noticed alot of reviewers are opting to substitute vanilla extract but i love the almond.

These were delicious and easy to make.  We topped them with vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, and more almonds.  Rich and sinful!

I love this recipe.  It was very easy to make.  I also used vanilla extract instead of the almond extract, and I substituted the Nestle chocolate for the Callebaut white chocolate.  It tastes amazing, especially with vanilla ice cream on top drizzled with chocolate fudge sundae.  You can't go wrong.

As per other reviews I used 8oz white chocolate chips, only 1 cup of flour & reduced eggs to 1 whole + 1egg white. Added some semi sweet choco chips & baked for 23 min. So yummy! More like fudgy brownies this way :) now it's a keeper!

The flavor of these was wonderful. But my family found them dense and a little dry and cake like. Maybe I just  baked them a little to long but still feel they should of been a little more moist then what my extra four minutes time warranted.Nice for an alternative tho' with its unique flavor.
