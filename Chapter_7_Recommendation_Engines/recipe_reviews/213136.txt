Oh Yes!  Pumpernickle in my meatloaf topped by Chili sauce and with Swiss hidden inside. This is "good stuff, Maynerd!"  Maybe next time I'll even try it with a little hotter version of Chili sauce.  I'll try some saut√©ed fresh mushrooms, too.

This is a fantastic recipe. If you are concerned with cholesterol and diet, use LOWFAT ground meats or ground turkey and low fat swiss cheese. This is a favorite in my house and very easy to prepare.

I thought this good, but the kids didn't like it. I liked the idea of the mushrooms and Swiss cheese in the middle. Not sure about the chili sauce on top though - ketchup would have been a better choice.
