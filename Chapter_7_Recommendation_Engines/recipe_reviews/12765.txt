A few slight changes (reduced green pepper to 1/2 as I know my family's tastes). I turned the heat off immediately after adding the seafood and removed it after 3 minutes. Then I added some shrimp shells to the cooking water, reduced the seafood cooking water down to 2 cups, to make a more concentrated broth, strained it and used all of that and cut back on the milk called for by 1 cup. (thus 2 cups milk/2 cups reduced seafood broth... resulting in a much more veloute-like and less bechamel-like sauce) Using Monterey Jack cheese, much lighter in flavor, also created an overall lighter taste to the dish, without overpowering the seafood.

I omitted the flounder and added more scallops. Next time I will try monkfish, which has a texture very much like lobster and holds together nicely when cooked.

Since many have mentioned how good it tastes leftover/reheated, I made this in the morning, chilled it, brought it to room temp. prior to reheating and made my and my guests dinner experience much more relaxed. I served it over white rice along with lightly steamed asparagus and passed warmed homemade bread. Yummy!

I actually wish I could have offered 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 because I would like to make a recommendation that would make it taste even better.  My family and I thought it was very good but too pasty.  I think if the flour were maybe a 1/4 cup less and cooked for less time then the recipe suggests, it wouldn't come out so pasty like.  All in all though, very good.  I changed the seafood a little and didn't use fillet bits but 1 lb of shrimp, 1lb of lump crab and 1lb of scallops.  I also served it over rice and steamed broccoli.  Also, the recipe took more than 20 minutes to prepare...more like 30+ for me because of peeling the shrimp prior to mixing all the seafood with the other ingredients.  It is an expensive dish as other reviews have suggested but it's worth it and definitely something to serve when you have dinner guests.

This was awesome and leftovers were even better!  The only changes I did was... instead of water, I used 2 cups clam juice (major flavor booster) and only 2 cups milk.  Pretty much followed the main recipe other than that.  thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Thoroughly sublime! I'm a seafood fanatic, and this was exactly what I wanted. I do not like flounder, so I used tilapia because I had some in the freezer, and bay scallops because they're smaller and more flavorful. To reiterate what others have said, it takes longer than 20 minutes, I'd allow an hour for preparation plus 30 minutes bake time. I had no trouble with the sauce at all, it turned out very rich, creamy and silky smooth, and I used 1% milk.  It takes about 15 minutes to get the onion and pepper caramelized properly, and about 10 minutes simmer for the white sauce before adding the cheese, etc. Keep stirring, and it will thicken! A basic knowledge of making roux is the key to good sauce. I used 3 cans of crabmeat, not fresh. I served with homemade garlic basil breadsticks, a tossed salad, and white wine. Superb! Thanks for sharing ;-)

Great recipes! I cut the recipes in half for just the two of us, turned out real well. I served it with yummy cheddar biscuits (like the ones at Red Lobster), perfect!!! Here's the recipe for the cheddar biscuits... (makes about 8 biscuits)
2 cups Bisquick® baking mix 
2/3 cup milk 
1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese 
1/4 cup butter - melted
2 cloves of garlic - minced
1 tbsp fresh parsley
1/2 tsp salt
-Combine Bisquick®, milk, and cheddar and beat with a wooden spoon for about 30 seconds.
-Spoon on to greased cookie sheet. Smooth tops down with spoon. 
-Bake in 450 degree oven for 8 minutes.
-Combine butter, garlic, parsley, and salt. Brush the mixture over top of the biscuits before serving.

I'm giving this 5 stars even tho I didn't follow recipe because I'm sure it would be great as is. Did the crust part as in recipe, then used 2 8 oz. bottles of clam juice and 1/2 cup white wine for liquid instead of water.Used 1-1/2 lb. shrimp, 1  lb. scallops. 12.oz flounder, 1 lb.lobster chunks for seafood,(used more seafood because a lot of people said it was runny),used 2 cups heavy cream, and the liquid I cooked seafood in.Used 1 cup parmeasan cheese,4 oz. cream cheese,1 cup 3 cheese blend (mozz.cheddar, provolone).Used white wine vinegar and left out salt.It came out out of this world every one at Easter loved it, (20)people.
 Cooked each seafood ingedient separatly since I didn't use the 4 cups of water so they would cook evenly, just took them out of liquid, returned to boil and put the next one in, just took a few min. longer and eack seafood was cooked  perfectly.

Excellent!  I recommend using only the freshest seafood and only real crab meat.  We had it with angel hair pasta and a spinach salad.  Yes, it is expensive, but good seafood makes all the difference.  And, it is still cheaper than eating in a restuarant!  My whole family (inlcuding my 2 year old and 3 1/2 year old) finished their plates, and my husband had 2 huge servings.  It takes alot of work, so definitely give yourself the extra time, but it is well worth it.  I rate it 5 stars for a home cooked meal.  It isn't a 5 star quality restuarant meal, but I'm not a 5 star restaurant chef, and it is one of the best things I've ever made at home.

I was in charge of Good Friday dinner and my father in law absolutely hates fish.  I upped the amount of scallops and just left out the fish.  He's a picky eater and I can always tell teh success of a meal by how many helpings he has.  He had 3 with this meal.  To make things easy, use canned crab (3 Diamond brand best).  It tastes just as good and costs a lot less.  I added garlic to the peppers and onions for added flavor.  Use pre-cooked shrimp to speed things up a little and this way you don't run the risk of making the shrimp curled and tough by overcooking it.  I used jalapeno pepperjack cheese in lieu of cheddar and topped it with a mixture of parmesean and bread crumbs.  My kitchen smelled wonderful while this was cooking!  My family has a new favorite recipe.  Although you use a lot of dishes making this, its okay because all you need to go along with it is salad and bread.  I served mine over rice pilaf.  Although it could also make a hearty stew served in a bread bowl too.  Similar to seafood newburgh.

We really enjoyed this recipie, even though I'm not all that fond of seafood. I did have to make a couple of substitutions; canned crabmeat and orange roughy instead of flounder. And I will definetely buy prepared shrimp! I had some problems with the flour sauce thickening, and I'm not sure the dish even set right (it took almost twice as long cooking time before the top browned). But it still tasted wonderful and it's definetly something I'd like to try again.

This recipe was AWESOME!!!  I listened to other reviews and cut the recipe in half.  I also used more cheddar cheese about 2 cups, and I added some spices and garlic! I used tiliapa instead of flounder and used canned crab meat I served it with angel hair pasta.   Everyone loved it and I know I will be making it again soon!  YUMMY!!

Okay..what did I do wrong?  It was horrible and I was really disappointed after spending so much money on it.  I used the canned Phillips crabmeat and I also omitted the fish but followed the recipe exactly.  I think the Cheese did not go well with the seafood combination.  May have been better with a wine sauce instead.  I also used the bags of Med. Frozen Shrimp so maybe I should have used all FRESH seafood instead?

This was very very good. I followed the recipe exactly as stated and would like to offer a few suggestions. I would not add flour to the butter, onion, pepper, crab portion of the recipe.  The flour just creates a pasty kind of thickness at the bottom of your dish. Secondly I would cut down on the milk-start with 2 cups and get it to the  consistency you like. I found 3 cups made alot of bechemel sauce. I did add about 1 cup of cheese instead of 1/2. Add seasonings to your taste. I added some garlic powder. This is a  wonderful recipe and very easy to personalize to your taste. I made it for my 25th anniversary dinner and my husband  can't say enough good things about how this turned out. Thanks for sharing and I will definitely make again

Good, however lobster should be substituted for Shimp, as the shrimp had a sharp flavor and Lobster is more like crab.  I also found a bit too much flour. But overall it was very easy and good.

This is truly a great recipie! My husband loved it! I served it over pasta, with garlic bread and a tossed salad. It's even better the second day! I will definately make this again, but I think I'll halve the recipie...it makes a LOT of food! Tastes a lot like Crab Alfredo served at one of our local "high-end" restaurants.

This is close to a favorite dish served at a local restaurant. We leave out the bell pepper since it seems to overpower the mellow flavors of the fish.  We love this recipe!!!  It's heavy, though, so we enjoy it most during the cold winter months.

A bit expensive but well worth it.  I substituted wine vinegar for distilled vinegar and that added flavor.  I also increased the pepper sauce.

This recipe is amazing. I followed the directions to a "T" and it came out perfectly. It was pretty fool proof the first time. I have made this recipe at least 10 times now. Since the first time, I turned it into a Seafood Lasagne. I used the noodles that you boil on the stove and the oven ready. The boiled noodles came out much better. Kudos to Kathy for letting me know about this recipe. Every time I have had company and made this recipe, my dinner guests think that I am a real "Cook" and really I am not. Thank you.

With a few changes, this recipe turned out beautifully. I cut back on the flour and butter, which didn't seem to compromise this dish at all. some reviewers said it seemed pastey...to cut that feeling I added texture with sliced water chestnuts. A little white wine vinegar to replace the distilled, and voila! a tastey and beautiful presentation for guests! Thanks, Katy :)

This recipe was very good. After reading the reviews I decided to make some changes ~ Instead of boiling the shrimp, fish, and scallops in water I used 3 cans chicken broth 3/4 cup dry white wine and  seasoned liquid with  with Old Bay and  lemon pepper seasoning. I also cut the milk back to 2 cups. For color presentation I used red peppers and orange sharp cheddar cheese. The reviews were very helpful. This recipe was excellent. PS. also reheats very nicely in microwave.

The fresh seafood that I used tasted great esp the crab meat. Thought the rest of the dish was sort of bland though. Seemed to be missing something.

All I can say is WOW!! This is a fantastic recipe. The only changes I made were 4 cups of milk, and instead of water I used 2 bottles of clam juice. I also omitted the flounder and added extra shrimp. I also mince 3 cloves of garlic to sautee with the green pepper & onion. Instead of serving it with rice I serves it over Puff Pastries. Absolutely delious. My husband and I loved it. Thanks for the recipe. BIG HIT!!!!!

I have made this so many times! Sometimes I exclude the fish, and cut out a little of the water. I messed it up pretty bad when  I first started making it, mixing everything together instead of the layers- it doesn't even matter, there is nothing better then this dish. One of my absolute favorites and I plan to make it again this weekend when I have my family over to announce my pregnancy. This dish also freezes well, just put a big scoop in a ziplock bag, get out all the air, and to reheat just stick the bag in boiling water until soft & hot. However- I rarely have leftovers unless I make it when I am by myself!

After reading all the reviews, I was expecting this to be an outstanding recipe.  But, unfortunately, that wasn't the case.  I had a really hard time getting it to thicken, and it still didn't thicken after cooking.  I substituted orange roughy for flounder and that was okay, and ommitted the scallops.  Next time, if there is a next time, I'll omit the crab crust and just cook it and serve mixed with linguine.

This is a good start but it is a little bland for me. I did the crust as directed with fresh crab and it was delicious.  I reduced the flour in the sauce by 1/4 cup and the sauce was fine. I also used 16 oz of clam juice and 1 cup of white wine to cook the fish in. I will make again but will experiment with adding garlic and/or salt or maybe even nutmeg and/or white pepper.  We served it with a side of linguine lightly dressed in evoo.

Thought this was good, but very, very rich. The only thing I did different, was I used the fake crab meat stuff. I didn't want to spend 30.00 dollars on just the crab if I didn't like it. I like this in a small portion.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I made hte following changes.  I used only 3/4 C flour, no fish, more shrimp and scallops to make up for the fish, 2 C milk, 2 C cheese.  It turned out like a nice casserole with this combination.  Next time, I will use the same amount of cheese, but put in 3 C milk, as we would prefer it to have a more "alfredo" like texture.  Also, next time we will bake the entree differently.  I think it would be good to put pasta in a bowl, then pour the cheesy seafood mixture on top and then top with the crab mixture.  The crab mixture tasted and looked like it would make a great golden topping for the cheesy seafood pasta.

Really is a versatile recipe. Used 2% milk as that is all I had on hand, but otherwise didn't change a thing. Very yummy, but also very rich! Couldn't eat a lot of it at a time, and ended up putting the rest in the fridge for leftovers.

Sooo delicious! If you love seafood and you love cheese, you will love this recipe. Expensive to make, but simple and easy - makes a TON so make room in the fridge for leftovers (or make this for a bigger group of people) It doesn't look attractive (cheesy, seafoody mess) but the taste makes up for it. Made this for my mom last year for her birthday (she's a seafood lover) and she liked it so much, she made it for me for MY birthday! (Lucky me!)

I liked this, but I'm a seafood lover.  Gave it to some friends who aren't seafood lovers and they ate it, but weren't crazy about it (wouldn't waste it on them again).  Don't know how Katy made it in 20 min. - took me an hour and 45 min!  Also I'd say it's more like 10-12 servings than 8 (it's very rich).

I'm really not sure how to rate this. My husband said 3***. If you are lucky enough to use fresh crab meat, I'm sure it would taste even better,but it is so expensive here, that I used 2 cans lump crab(under $3.00 a can). I used only half an onion and half green pepper,family preference. I used only 1/4 cup of flour in onion and pepper mix and a little less than 1/2 cup in sauce mix and I think the consistency came out well. I added my liquids to sauce mixture by removeing it from heat sorce first, then slowly add liquids, I believe it gets less lumps that way. I incresed salt to 1 tsp. as I thought it to be a little blande. I added a tad more cheese to sauce and 1/8 tsp. white pepper instead. I used tilapia instead of flounder. I used more than 1/2 cup parmesan on top and added seasoned bread crumbs. We thought it to be good but we've had better. Served with risotto rice and green beans. Was enough sauce that you could serve with a small side of pasta. It was very expensive to make, and with my husband only rating it a 3, I don't know if I will make it again. Thanks Katy for sharing!

I've made this recipe twice.  It's a very exspensive dish but well worth it.  My family loved it!  Everyone wants me to make it for there own dinner parties.  I think I'll charge at least $75.00  Cause that's alot of work!

Excellent!  I changed it just a little, though.  Based on others' recommendations, 1 doubled the scallops to 2 pounds; eliminated the flounder; added 1 bottle clam juice and reduced the milk to 2 cups.  Also, I didn't use the pepper (we don't care for it) and added some garlic to the onion as it sauteed.  I put it together the day before, then all I had to do was pop it in the oven.  It got rave reviews from everyone around the holiday table.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

I am an experienced cook. I love this site, and find it quite reliable because of the great review feature. This recipe was ho hum at best, and pasty.   It needs a sherry or wine reduction with the onion and pepper to add some richness to complement the seafood and it should have much less flour.  It tastes like filler.

This dish was disappointing.  It was lacking something.  If I made it again, I'd probably add a squeeze of lemon, some red pepper flakes and some chopped fresh parsley.  I guess that's what it lacked - a freshness which the lemon and parsley could have lent to it.  I served it over brown rice, but it would have been far better over toast points.

Note to newbie cooks: when it comes time to stir the sauce "until thickened and bubbly"...don't make my mistake!  I did not let it thicken nearly enough, and my final product was quite wet.  If you're a novice and you think your sauce is thick enough, let it go another 5 minutes after that :)    Even though I botched the recipe, it was still quite tasty and I would definitely make this again.

I just made this yesterday, it was awesome!  Instead of using an entire green pepper I used half of a green pepper & half of a red bell pepper because that is all I had left from a salad I made the other day & the red & green peppers complimented each other so well with the other ingredients!  I also added some green onion to the crab mix that I had left over to use it up & that worked so well.  I boiled the seafood in 3 cups water & 1 cup lemon juice & used talapia instead of flounder just because that's what I had in the freezer already, I am very frugal :)  Everyone loved it, especially my picky 2 year old!  Excellent recipe & left overs were even better!

I've made lots of Seafood Casseroles before but this was certainly a unique recipe. I wasn't sure what to expect because of the way it is put together, but it was absolutely delicious....everyone wanted more.  The "serves" 8" may turn into "serves 4". Just a note, I didn't use Flounder because usually flounder would fall apart. I replaced it with fresh  Haddock. And, I used Lobster in place of Crab.  Prefer the texture of lobster & taste. Crab I find is too flaky.

This was a great dish.  It makes a whole lot so you might want to try half the recipe first.  I used 1% milk and it was a bit runny so either cut back on the milk or use whole.

I made this last night and it is delicious.  I used a bottle of pure clam juice instead of water and the flavour was wonderful.  I will definitely make this again.  Served on basmati rice with steamed brocolli with garlic slivers.  Healthy and Yummy.

This recipe is awesome--with one exception. I would skip the whole first step (eliminating 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup flour) and throw the onions in with the butter to the saucepan. Throw the crabmeat in with the seafood mixture.

To Maura Mo .... This is basically a Rue. If it is not cooked long enough it will taste pasty. Suggest cooking a while longer. That should take care of the pasty taste. I hope this is helpful to you and others.

We made this Seafood dish without the flounder.  We decreased the flour, which someone else suggested, and it was delicious.  The finished dish comes out of the oven appearing to be a little to fluid, but as it cools it is just right.  So we suggest letting the dish sit for about 5 minutes before serving.

Excellent! I served this to my parents and brother for Christmas and they absolutely loved it.  It was full of seafood....I added a pound of lobster and used a pound of scallops instead of half....Delicious!!!  I used about a quarter cup less flour for the mixture so it wouldn't get to pasty....worked good.  It is the second time I make this recipe and everybody loved it....Will make it again in the near future...probably in the summer when the seafood it fresh.

Very mixed reviews on this recipe, a very expensive dish to make to have so many mixed reviews. Personally I was disappointed I think more of a wine and white cheese sauce is more my personal preference. My son kept eating it off the top of the stove and thought it was killer, but did not like it as much after I had baked it with the crab crust. His girlfriend loved it and my husband thought it was pretty good and he is very finicky. SO this one is difficult to rate. I thought it needed more flavor and did add old bay when cooking the seafood and to the sauce mixture to liven it up some but it still needed something. The mixture on the stove made a good cheese seafood soup though. I love trying new recipes and enjoy everyone's reviews, not every recipe is for everyone!

I made this recipe for a cooking demonstrtion at a specialty foods store and everyone LOVED IT!!! The only thing I did different was I used tilapia instead of the flounder.

I seasoned seafood w/ Old Bay Seasoning, Garlic powder, salt & Pepper and place on top of crab meat mixture.  I also seasoned the seafood sauce w/ Creole seasoning and lemon pepper.  Pour sauce mixture over seafood.

Hmmmm...lemme think....um...AWESOME!  This was outstanding.  I subbed tilapia for flounder (had on hand) and crawfish tails for the crab (just love crawfish),  a shredded cheese blend for the sharp cheddar, and 1.5 cups heavy cream for the milk, since other reviewers mentioned that it was runny.  This reminded me of something you'd order at Red Lobster, maybe over pasta.  I served with garlic breadsticks, and even the hubby, who hates anything even remotely "fishy", loved it.  Added more onion and pepper to the left overs, rolled into tortillas and made enchiladas the next night.  Thanks SO much for sharing this!

This was one of the most delicious meals I have ever made.  The people who were having dinner with me all really enjoyed it and have said that this is one of the most memorable/delicious meals they have ever had.  One thing I would suggest is to prepare some french toast w/ butter & herbs, bake it in the oven and serve on the side.  When I made this, I did not realize it was going to be more like a fondue and didn't have the bread ready.  Needless to say, the meal was great but the bread would have complimented it well.

I agree with all, very expensive but quite good.  Suggest serving it over steam brocolli or other vegetables.  Next time I will make half the recipe and season more to taste.  It was a little blander than we like.

My family enjoyed this dish. I changed things alittle however.  I didn't had quite as much green pepper and used only scant cups of flour called for.  I also added 1 1/2 tsp. of Old Bay Seasoning.  I think this helped pick things up.  As for left overs, I baked halibut and poured some of the casserole over that.  I'll make this again and recommend it to everyone.

Pretty good :) My roomie and my bf loved it :) I made it low fat, with fat free cheddar, skim milk, non fat margerine.  I didn't use scallops but doubled on the fish.  I tend to think that the creamy texture masked the flavor of the shrimps, but it went with the crabmeat really well :)

VERY VERY DELICIOUS! It is also easier to make than I thought when I first read the recipe.  I did not simmer the seafood as long as what indicated in the recipe. I could not find flounder in the store, so I used catfish.  I have also used a little more than a dash of black pepper and hot sauce, it turned out GREAT. This recipe will be used whenever there is a VIP event.

Tasty as heck, but soupier than I expected. I think I'll add some thickener to the liquid next time before I assmble the dish.

Seafood part of recipe was great, but the sauce tasted and looked like wallpaper paste, very bland.  Too much flour in roux.  If I made this again, I would cut the flour for the roux down to a couple of tablespoons, NOT 1/2 cup!
Could not taste the Worcestershire sauce or the hot sauce at all.

I'm not usually a risk-taker when it comes to cooking and have to admit that this recipe made me very nervous.  It's one thing to bomb on spaghetti pie - it's another thing entirely when there are so many high-dollar ingredients.  I made it just as written (didn't scale it down) and I do agree that it was bit soupy - thick, but soupy nonetheless.  It was still very good though served over rice and I would definitely consider making it again (although my 11 year old said he'd rather have had grilled cheese for dinner).

This is such a rich and delicous dish.  I use 1lb of scallops instead of adding any flounder, and I use canned crab meat, it's still SO YUMMY.

Followed recipe exactly..scaled to four servings...for those who had a problem with soupiness, remember, when scaling, directions do not scale only ingredients..example, in directions, it calls for 1/2 cup butter, if scaled to 4 servings, it will still read 1/2 cup but should only be 1/4 cup... This was tasty, not gourmet, but still a good, easy to follow recipe..to those who changed recipe by using canned anything, that's not what the recipe calls for...canned crabmeat along with talapia, should not be allowed in your kitchen...I did substitute fresh haddock for flounder...will make again, served over buttermilk biscuits with side of grilled asparagus..would do well over noodles, rice, or pastry..very close to a seafood newburgh..

This is a pretty good dish, but not out of this world.  I halved the recipe and used small pre-cooked shrimp, bay scallops, orange roughy, and imitation crabmeat.  Replaced water with vegetable stock.  I added garlic powder and old bay seasoning and decreased the amount of flour.  Sprinkled bread crumbs along with parmesan on top before baking.  Served over pasta with peas and garlic bread.  Next time, I will probably season and saute the seafood instead of boiling it.

This is a good base recipe but when I made it as is, I found it to be really bland. I added three more cups of cheese and just used 2 lbs of shrimp. I also added some white wine and chicken broth and green onions. I did as others suggested and cut the flour to 3/4 cup and added a little more hot sauce, I like things spicy. I topped the casserole with crushed up Ritz crackers and it turned out yummy!!

I am not typically a casserole kinda gal but this was a huge hit!  It's rich and delicious.  I gave it to my co-worker and the next day she told me her husband had a million thank you's for me!  It's spreading like wild fire...

It is labor-intensive and quite expensive with all that crab meat though.  It's a special treat though and well worth all the cost and fuss.

My family loved this!  I used cod in place of flounder, sea scallops and quartered them.  I used 2 c. seafood broth in place of the water.  I used 1/2 c. flour each time to cook in with the butter.  I also used only 2 c. milk.  I prepared ahead and let it set for 45 minutes before baking.  We devoured it and only have ~1 c. left over.  I made the Cheese Biscuits as JOOOCY79 recommended. Great dinner!

This was great.I made a few changes as suggested by other reviews..I used 1.5 cups of 1/2 and 1/2 and 1.5 cups of milk. I used red peppers instead of green because of personal taste. I used more shrimp and scallops and left the fish out altogether. I also generously added old  bay seasoning and garlic salt to the water for the seafood to boil in.  Left overs freeze great in ziploc bags. To reheat, boil some water and place bag in water until hot. Yum-mo.This was great and make a bunch. Thanks for sharing.

It's quite apparent how good this is by all of the reviews. There are so many ways to enjoy this dish. I'm started with the original and working my way through. My personal note; I'm giving it a five star, but it's a ten in my book. I'm passing this one on!

Very good recipe.  My husband raved about it, I thought it was ok.  It was hard to scale the dinner down to 2 people.  I omitted the peppers and fish and served it over pasta.  A definite keeper.

This dish was highly expensive to make and the returns on the investment were slight. Way too much going on in the recipe, the seafood and it's individual and delicate flavors were lost.

This recipe is wonderful.  It was my first attempt with cooking seafood and my family loved it.  It is better than the dishes at most restaurants!

I made this recipe last week, and as usual, I didn't have all the things called for, so I had to wing it on some things.  I had some fake crab, and used it and it was very good, I did have shrimp, and the only fish I had was a can of tuna, and, sorry, I used that.  It was really good, and even though I messed up and didn't follow the recipe just right, it was very forgiving and it turned out very good, oh yes I added a dash of wine.  I can tell that by making it correctly it would be wonderful, so next time, I'll plan ahead and have the correct stuff on hand.  Thanks Katy M, from Cathy L.

The was a hit with the seafood lovers in my family. The kids weren't too crazy about it - but loved dipping their bread in it. I was a little disappointed I didn't serve this over pasta or rice, but I plan to make this again doing just that.

Wow.  What a special meal this was for my sister's 50th birthday dinner celebration.   EVERYONE loved it... Served it over angelhair pasta and with a tossed salad, warm biscuits, and acorn squash as a side.   8 of us were full afterwards, (Had to leave room for birthday cake!)and there was enough left over for 4 lunches the next day.  Not a meal we'll make frequently because of the cost, but for special occasions, definitely...

Pretty good dish, but it took a lot of work (took me 2 hrs total) and did not have a whole lot of flavor. 

I followed recipe, but added 3 cloves of garlic to onion/pepper mix.  Even so, not much flavor.  Bottom portion with crab/onion/pepper "crust" did not do much for the dish and was just added work making a separate roux.  

Everyone liked it, but assumed it was a basic seafood newburg with a funky bottom part.  Next time, I think a good newburg is a better bet time-wise and taste-wise.

Very good! I did make it my own with spices to my taste and cut the recipe in half, used 1/2 & 1/2, seafood stock, wine, but the liquid content is fine if you make your rue properly and allow liquids to thicken. Worth the $$ for fresh crab and so forth!! :)

Made according to directions. Sorry, as a seafood lover I was disappointed! Not impressed with recipe. Sauce didn't have enough ump--was bland. I expected a lot more wow for the amount of money I spent on the ingredients.

This was absolutely delicious.  Possibly the best dish we've made from Allrecipes.  I've bumped up the amount of each seafood by 1/4, and used Dover Sole instead of flounder but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I say it again, absolutely delicious.

I thought this was really good! Very rich.  I reduced the milk to 2 cups instead of 3, also I did not use fish added more scallops and shrimp. Next time will add a little more scallops. Served with brown rice and garlic bread.  Will make again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Good recipe. Expensive recipe.  Next time I will add some spices to the water when I simmer the fish, shrimp and scallops.  I'll also add more cheese to the sauce.  I used 1 and 1/2 cups of half and half instead of the 3 cups of milk and the sauce was perfect in consistency.  You may want to add a little more half and half if serving over pasta.  The crabby crust had the best flavor!  I'm going to apply for a bank loan so I can make this again and experiment with the spice factor!

Sorry, but this one turned out to be very mundane and below average. Very little flavor. The flounder filets virtually disintegrated when placed in the boiling water and they were good sized filets. Our total recipe cost was $45.00 + and we were tryly disappointed. We checked and recheked our cooking procedures to make sure we followed the recipe exactly. Oh well, can't win them all.

I must have done something wrong.  I made a double batch and poured it over pasta.  It was very thick.  Very time consuming while company was waiting for me to finish.  Taste was good.  I might try a smaller batch again.  Not sure when.

This is an outstanding recipe, should have made more.  My whole family loved it.  I love seafood anyway and this was a nice one to combine all of my favorite into one meal.  Wouldn't have this one alone, not filling enough.  We had a nice salad with this and some biscuits, very nice together.

I give this recipe 4 stars for content.  I would like to give it 5 stars for taste.  I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings, and when it printed up, it had some incorrect ingredient amounts.  The Flour and Butter amounts never changed.  It should read 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup of butter.  Once I dealt with that little problem, and put all the ingredients in the oven.  I thought the results were excellent.  I will keep this recipe in my recipe box and I will certainly make it again.  My husband also liked it.  I did serve it over rice, because you want to soak up the wonderful cheese sauce. As far as cost goes, yes it is a pricey dish, but the results are worth it.

THis recipe was fantastic.  It took longer to make than anticipated (approximately two hours), but it was well worth the time.  I reduced the flour by about 1/2-3/4 of a cup to reduce pastiness, and used about a cup less water than called for by the original recipe.  I also as suggested by another reviewer (see 12/16/2002 review) used the shrimp shells boiled in water to make a tastier stock.  I served over rice with steamed brocolli on the side.  It's a costly dish ($$$), but people haven't stopped asking for the recipe. A good recipe to impress friends and relatives.

This was really good, but I think it needs to be served with some pasta or toasted sourdough bread. It's just a little too runny to be served as a casserole. It's a real throwback to the way my Mom and Grandma used to cook: all concern for flavor, no concern for calories!

I really loved this dish! It was really, really good. You can cut down on prep time by using imitation crab, and shrimp that are deveined and have the shell removed. I also spread italian bread crumbs over the top for a little kick. It does take some prep time but it is well worth it. It is a bit pricey, but makes a big pan. Definitely worth making again and again.

This was wonderful! My husband (a notorious hater of seafood) loved the dish and suggested we make it again. I also think this would be a great dish to take to a new mother or a grieving family- comforting and delicious! This is a "keeper".

It being Lent, and me being Catholic, I browsed the web looking for good meatless meals to eat on Fridays.  (This is often difficult as I am not much of a fish eater) But when I saw this recipe, it sounded so good that I was compelled to give it a go.  I didn't use all the seafood it called for, but it still turned out really well.  (and that's HIGH praise for someone who doesn't normally like fish!)

I made this recipe for a special dinner with family and friends. It was great. I added fresh sliced mushrooms and I used mock crabmeat. I made with scallops and shrimp only, omitting the flounder.

Came out GREAT!!! Made it for a fancy Sunday dinner & had everyone going back in for seconds. Was so rich and flavorful...I highly recommend :) Obviously is a little pricey due to all the seafood used, but well spent. YUM!

This was delicious!  I used imitation crab in an effort to save some money, and I used scallions instead of a regular onion, just for personal preference.  Also, I did not have flounder and I didn't see any at the grocery store so I just used the salmon I had and it worked out very well.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Would make it again, I think it's a new favorite.

This was our Christmas dinner was great! To lighten the recipe for calorie counting reasons I used fat free margarine instead of butter, skim milk, and low fat cheddar cheese.  It was delicious!  Great special occasion dish! I will try with imitation crab meat for a regular weekday dish to cut down cost and see if it takes anything away from the overall taste.

My family loved this recipe. I did make a few alterations that fit more into our lifestyle. I added old bay seasoning, used lactaid milk, used cod instead of flounder and doubled the scallops instead of using shrimp. This will be a family favorite!

I just made this recipe for Sunday dinner.  It is delicious.  I did add my own seasonings, like Old Bay and garlic salt, 1/4 c less flour, 2 cups of cheddar cheese and some tiger sauce.  If these adjustments had not been made, it would have been way too bland for my family.  I served this over linguine.  I had a nice creamy, cheesy sauce. I still gave the base recipe a 5 star rating because everyone has their own seasoning preference.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated and it was perfect.  You don't need lump crabmeat for this as the crabmeat forms a type of crust.  I used "special" and it worked fine.

This recipe was delicious, if your a real seafood lover. I altered it a bit though. I cut the onion,pepper,butter,and seafood water to 1/2 a cup. 1 1/2 for milk, used 1 Tilapia fillet, about half pd. shrimp and scallops, and no crab meat. I kept everything else the same and add bread crumbs to the pepper, onion mix, and at the end with the parm cheese. So good,at the end with the breadcrumbs, don't be shy, the more the BETTER! Serve this with rice.It was about 5-6 servings. My hubby loved it!

I can see why this was rated so much and so well!  It's easy and delicious!  I cut the recipe down to 2 servings just to give it a try and I only had a can of crabmeat (yuk...not worth buying a can!!!)  Anyway, it was terrific.  Will make again with real crabmeat for company.  It's hard to get good seafood in my area outside of Nashville, but got some really great baby bay scallops at Whole Foods and frozen flounder filets at Sam's.  We bring home lots of Gulf shrimp when we go to Florida and so the seafood was pretty good.  Can't wait to make it again!

This was just ok for me.  It actually turned out very soupy, however when I heated up the leftovers the next day I noticed it was much thicker.
I also used canned crab meat to cut back on cost.

Wow, I was very dissapointed.  I had high hopes, however, it turned out really 'soupy' and just didn't have much too it.  The taste was good, after I added lots of 'old bay' seasoning.  I picked out and ate the shrimp but left the rest on my plate.  Should be renamed "cheesy seafood dip".   better luck to others.  thanks

I made this exactly how the directions called.  I wasn't crazy about the flavor....and it is a VERY "heavy" meal.  My husband complained of a stomach ache shortly after eating.  I also think it would have been just as good with only shrimp or only scallops.  Didn't care for the peppers in it either.  Sorry...!

Being for Louisiana I added crawfish tails. I didn't put the scallops. I also roughly chopped the seafood and added more liquid. Served with the Crostini d' Emily recipe on this site.

This came out good, but I would use more salt or seasoning (maybe the old bay others recommended).  I will make it again and add something.

We absolutely loved this.  I used a 1 lb can of crabmeat and made this for company, served with Prosciutto Wrapped Asparagus and a nice salad.  Everyone loved it and it's actually a very easy dish to prepare.

This was good, but I think the vinegar is a bit unusual.  I was thinking I would not be able to taste it, but I could.  I think next time, I will omit the vinegar.  We enjoyed it and my picky 4 year old liked it.  Thanks.

Great recipe.  Did not change a thing.  Served with potatoes and broccoli, so the extra sauce came in handy.  Will do this again!

This is pretty difficult with many steps.  Plus the ingredients, if you buy fresh, are quite expensive.  But, it is absolutely delicious and very impressive!  I served 8 big eaters with it, adding extra 1/2 lb shrimp and crab claws (lobster claws would be better).  Everyone loved it!  It's worth the extra effort.

Really wonderful!!  This dish is our new traditional Christmas Eve dinner!  I folowed the suggestions from Diviana's review and it turned out perfect.  I left out the scallops, even though I like them, because I wasn't sure my family would like them.  Everyone in my family loved it and next time I'll include the scallops!!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. . . .It should be, look at the fat and sodium content in the nutritional info at the bottom. Not recommended for every day meal, but certainly a great treat when you've been good!

Super, super rich.  I was a little uncertain about the weird green pepper crust layer, but it tasted pretty good.  Everyone enjoyed it the first night, but the leftovers sat in the fridge untouched.  I haven't decided if I'm going to go to the expense and trouble of making this again - it was good, but didn't make the big hit that I was hoping for.

The recipe was okay, but I think considering the cost, it was not worth it. If you absolutely love seafood and are really in the mood for it, not matter the expense, then maybe this recipe will work for you, but I was preparing it for my parents, sister, and boyfriend, and only my boyfriend liked it, sort of... It looked nice and tasted okay and everything, but I think it was too expensive not to be spectacular. Also, it took a lot of time to make and a constant watch.

This was very tasty, however it wasn't as thick as I had hoped. Very expensive to make but worth it if you have the extra $$$$.

I personally did not care too much for this recipe, but I did have to change a few things.  I had to leave out the shrimp due to allergies, so I doubled the Flounder, and found out that I really do not like scallops at all.  My husband on the other hand thought it was great.  It was very expensive to make, 1 lb crab meat costs $21 here and we live right by the ocean!  I thought preperation was easy, but my husband thought it was a lot of work (watching from the other room!).  If you like seafood and have some cash to spare, definately try it.

Really good but a bit time consuming.  I accidentally mixed the crust portion in with the rest of the recipe - oops!  Still tasted pretty good and nobody seemed to notice.  Will definitely try again and make the correct way.  Family enjoyed it.

This tastes and looks incredible!  It does take time, so try to get the shrimp already peeled and deveined.  Well worth the effort...it was a huge hit at Easter.  Definitely something to try for special occasions.  While it is costly, it does serve a lot of people, and like I said, well worth it!  My mom adds a little more cheese to hers...Mmmmm!

The adults in my family liked this.  It was good, though the sauce did seem to overpower the delicate taste of the seafood.  I personally wasnt wild about seafood and cheese together, but rated it per what the rest of the family thought.

I put this over noodles. I really liked it and so did those that I shared this with. Even my 3 yr. old grandson said "More Nana." It did take a long time for me to prepare. This is only a "special occasion" recipe.

Works with many types of seafood.  Not necessarily a recipe for the novice cook, or someone that's going to get distracted by the kids during the preparation phase.  Outstanding taste.

This is definitely not an everyday dish but it would be really good for company or a special occassion.  It took me a little longer to make than was suggested but I had to peel and devein the shrimp I also cut up all my fish and scallops.  I added a little extra cheese to the top (cheddar) and added some finely crushed bread crumbs.  I also served it over rice.  My husband said he'd like mushrooms added so I'll do that next time I make it.  It is very good but it is rich.

I think it was great! Even better as leftovers. It was a little too saucy the first time. It takes a long time to prepare, especially when you consider the shrimp. I wouldn't make it a lot, but, I will make it again.

Out of this world!!  I used Tilapia instead of the flounder, and added lobster.  It does take some time to make, but it is relatively easy.  I will make it time and time again.   Better than Bob Chins Crab House!!!

Good, quite good, but not amazing.  It is an extremely rich dish but, in my view, over the top.  Not what you would find in a truly fine restaurant, but more like what you would find in a higher end neighborhood place.  Easy to make but somewhat time consuming.  Don't skimp on ingredients -- seems expensive but serves 8 minimum.

My boyfriend and I really appreciate good food and we loved this dish.  After dinner he said that this dish was "Murry's quality".  Murry's is one of our favorite restaurants so that was definetely a compliment.

I found this a good meal, I put it over noodles and everyone in my family enjoyed it, I changed a few of the fish to what I happen to have and it was great, I think it will be tasty with most kinds of seafood. Thanks, we'll make this again and again.

This recipe is fantastic!  My husband was beside himself! He said it was as good as anything you'd by in a great restaurant.  He has asked me to make it for his family for our big family reunion.  My son loved it and he didn't care for scallops until he tried this!Now he wants it every year for his birthday dinner!                        I omitted the shrimp and fish, just because a friend gave us 7 lbs. of fresh-off-the-boat scallops and I needed to use them.  It was a winner that way, also.  Thank you for this recipe!  It will become a family tradition!By the way, the 1 year old baby liked it, too.

This is fantastic; it does take a little effort, but it's well worth it.
I served it for a dinner party, and it won raves, even with the kids. Remember to use the best quality ingredients, and the freshest seafood. Serve over a bed of wild rice with green salad, and a nice white wine.
Ooooh, yes!

I chose the middle of the road rating for kids. This rating could go up or down. It would depend on how exposed the kids are. 
As for adults, it's definitly a thumbs up. 
Suggestion: Put this seafood mixture over some type of pasta. Great on baked potatoes. Possibly add vegetables to it such as brocolli. Use Orange Roughy instead of Flounder.

This took me 2 1/2 hours to make - It sounded soooo good, sadly, it was terrible!  It may be that I used immitation crab, but....the fish became pasty and it all tasted awful!  Only the shrimp and scallops were good, so we picked them out and ate them with noodles.

I made this for Christmas Eve Dinner one year and it was a hit.  My whole family loved it and everyone wanted the recipe!  It’s a little expensive to make for an everyday meal, but every now and then its certainly worth it.

After reading other reviews I decided to change the recipe in this way: added 2 cups seafood broth instead of plain water when cooking the shrimp and scallops and kept 2 cups for the sauce, added only 2 cups of milk, I only used shrimps, scallops and crabmeat, added more seasonings to taste, used Monterey Jack cheese and it was really good. I've always been afraid to cook seafood because it's too expensive to make if you mess up somehow on the recipe. This baked seafood was like eating at an upscale restaurant. I put it over rice, but decided it's going to be better with angel hair pasta. $50 for the seafood alone, but worth it in the end. One last thing - prep for this meal is well over 20 mins.

Rarely do I give anything a perfect score.  So, a four star rating is suburb in my book. Easy enough to make and welcomed by my most critical of family members, my son who "hates everything".  Excellent!

Amazing! Everyone loved it however very pricey to make. I added 1/4 fresh lemon (great with lemon pepper) I also slightly reduced the amount of flour I added to the milk. I served it with angel hair pasta. Garlic bread a small salad. Wow!

I made this recipe last night, following it closely.   Being in the Bay of Fundy, and having a fisherman to please, I used local seafood- Canadian hard shell lobster, halibut and scallops.  
This recipe didn't disappoint!   I will make this again, using left over seafood - yes, it happens. The next  time I will omit the cheddar and up the parmesan and double the amount of sauce

I don't know if I liked the bottom crab crust, but the rest of the recipe was pretty good. Reminded me of one our favourite seafood dips at a local restaurant, but even more decadent. It was creamy and cheesy. I served it with some buttered noodles on the side.

This dish is excellent for a celebratory dinner--like New Year's Eve.  The seafood is expensive if you buy fresh.  The flavor is very delicate from the butter and seafood.  However, I changed the cheese to Manchego before I even tried it because I did not want to use yellow cheddar.  I bought pre-cooked shrimp and clam so I used Zataran's Crab Boil in the water for flavor but saw some other excellent substitutions in the review section. My sauce looks a bit thin (I don't want to overcook the seafood) so I will serve over pasta or biscuits.  The key is to know how to make a good roux:  undercooked is runny and overcooked is pasty.  The liquid should be hot when added or the flour will not thicken.  This recipe is a keeper.

Great dish! I left out the salt, hot sauce, shrimp, and scallops per diet requirements for the household.  I added 1lb immitation crab (polluck) with the flounder and it turned out very tasty.  The changes saved $s and this is a great recipe for a low salt diet.

This was very tasty. I think next time I would like to decrease the sauce by half. Served with "Soft Garlic Breadsticks," raw sugar snap peas, and raw carrots. The breadsticks accompanied this dish very well.

I didn't think this was all that. A lot of effort for something that just was kinda bland and kinda fishy, and I love seafood. You end up with way too much. My husband wouldn't eat it because it was too fishy, and after day 2 of trying to finish this dish off, even my brother who lives off seafood, said it was too much.

This recipe is just okay, and considering the cost, I wish it were better.  I have made it with and without the white fish, and I prefer without, but I think I will save my seafood for better recipes.

Overall, a good recipe, but I would add a little more seafood than the recipe calls for and I would add a bit of sherry or white wine for a little more flavor.  As the recipe is, it is a little bland, but not bad.

This recipe was disappointing.  It's very bland.  I invited my mother-in-law to dinner and was embarrassed with this very white, very boring meal.  Very expensive to make.  Lots of leftovers which went down the disposal.  Definitely won't make this one again.

This was good, and not too hard to make.  I didn't add the cooking fluid back in, and I think I should have.  I was afraid it would be too runny, but it lacked a little creaminess I would have liked.

This recipe was okay.  Not quite as good as all the reviews.  I used canned crabmeat like someone else said they used.  I think it would have been much better with fresh.  Mine was a little runny, too.  I followed the recipe exactly other than the crab, so not sure what happened there.

I will agree that this was very expensive to make, but it was worth it. The next time I make I will add more shrimp, flounder, and add lobster to it. This dish was excellent my mom and my husband loved it.

I made this tonight and it was good.  It was a bit runny, so I may change the milk out based on other recommendations.  Otherwise it was very delicious.  Recommended for that seafood lover in the family.

This was VERY runny...I followed the recipe, but I DID halve it, the only change. My family seemed to like it however, but I found it to have a poor presentation, which made me disinclined to eat it, despite how much I love seafood!

I love this recipe! It was a big hit. It was pretty easy and wasn't that hard to prepare. I used seafood I had in the freezer, Wahoo, sea scallops cut up, shrimp and canned crab. I served it over pasta becasue it is very rich. I will definitely make it again.

This turned out well though I felt it wasn't quite as "gourmet" as I thought it would be from the other reviews. Don't get me wrong, it is very good for a home cooked meal.It was very filling and great comfort food. We had this with rice and french bread. The kids(2 and 14) loved this. They both had seconds and cleaned their plates.I kicked up the amount of hot sauce and used all fresh seafood. We hate fake seafood so I can't imagine anyone substituting that. May make again since this was good but maybe with just fish or scallops as that would be less pricey.

I was expecting much more from this dish.  The cheese overwelmed the delicate taste of the pricey shellfish.  This one will end up in "File 13".

This was really great.  It took a little longer to prepare but it was worth it.  My husband loved it and ate half the tray by himself.  His brother ate the other half and raved about it.  I will make this again but for a special holiday.  A little too long for after work.  But great to have after work once you make it.  This is extremely yummy.

This was incredible!  I made it as a side dish for Thanksgiving for my 81 year-old mother.  Since we're both watching cholesterol, I made it with fat-free evaporated milk, fat-free cheddar cheese, and diet margerine.  It was truly delicious, even fat-free!!

It took a bit of time to put together and the ingredients were a bit pricey ( I remade the recipe with imitation cod and crab and was great) but well worth the effort.  My husband ranked it as one of his top five favorites!!!

This was a great recipe.  However, I did find the shells in the lump crabmeat still there after I spent alot of time trying to get them out.  I was told if you use the fresh white crabmeat instead of the lump you won't get the shells.  I have not tried this yet, so I am not sure how the with crabmeat would change the taste.

I had been looking for a seafood au gratin recipe for awhile and was very pleased with this one.  My husband and I both like spicy so I added quite a bit more of the hot sauce and also added mushrooms...very good!!

The only problem that it really has is too much butter. Next time, I will try less butter. It goes very nicely with french bread.

This recipe was really delicious, but the recipe took a long time.  You have to boil crab legs, peel and devein shrimp, etc...  Just allow for plenty of time.

I wanted so much to like this recipe but I found it, just o.k.
I think the sauce overpowers the tast of the shrimp and scallops.
you could put anything in this and never know the difference.
I doubt i would ever make it again.
:-(

This was a very costly dish.  I love seafood and its is very time consuming to prepare.  I really enjoyed it as well as my husband.  More seasoning should be added to jazz it up
