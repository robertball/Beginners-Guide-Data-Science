Delicious!  I bought boconccini (little fresh mozzarella balls) and I marinated them for 2 days in garlic powder, dried basil and oregano and salt and pepper.  I then halved them and assembled them with one tomato a strip of fresh basil folded in half, sandwiched between the cheese and tomato. Soooo good and they were all eaten in a matter of minutes and there were only 5 of us eating!

I haven't made this exact recipe but one similar.  I find it's easier to eat if you halve the grape tomatoes and put the cubed cheese with the half piece. I also marinate the mixture for a few hours in the olive oil and add some dried herbs for extra flavor. Also add a few sprinkles of crushed red pepper flakes for color - doesn't really make it that spicy. I rub the flakes in the palms of my hands to crush a little more and release the flavors too. Be sure to buy the best mozzarella cheese you can find.

I made these on Christmas Eve and they were a huge hit!  I changed the recipe to flavor it up a bit: add extra basil (i actually used frozen!), a tiny bit of garlic powder and red pepper flakes.  I marinated this for about 30 minutes.  I also recommend using small balls of mozzarella, halving them and then skewering with a whole grape tomato.  Love this recipe... it is SO easy!  I will definitely be making it again!

This is one of my favorite things to eat, but I had a little balsamic vinegar to the mixture.  Gives it just the right amount of kick!

This was very good!  I skewered half a grape tomato, a piece of fresh mozzarella cheese, a piece of basil and then the second half of the tomato.  Then I drizzled the oil, salt, papper and some basalmic vinegar over the skewers!

I buy the mozzarella balls that are in a herbed oil in the specialty cheese case of my grocery store. Make the skewers & pour the oil over them. Then I drizzle some balsamic vinagrette salad dressing over them. They fly off the table! So easy to make & take. Everyone asks for the recipe!

My sister-in-law made these for Christmas. Instead of chopping the basil she threaded a leaf between the cheese and tomato. She also used halved baby boconccini which is softer than regular mozzarella. It tasted like summer!

These have been the highlight of my summer! I've taken them to parties and love them the next day for lunch or with a sandwich or salad.  Tip for buying ingred:  ~25 grape tomatoes (Santa Sweets) per container, ~45 sm mozzarella balls per container, party picks come 50/pk.  I skewer tomatoe, basil/basil paste or no basil if without & mozz. I have marinated everything overnight & skewered or skewered with no seasoning to transport and take a small container of seasoning and drizzle over the plate before serving.  Drizzle Mediterrean dipping oil & you don't need anything else to season except maybe salt & cracked pepper or garlic if that's to your taste. Once skewered, they will stand up on a plate in a 3" deep plastic container with a lid for taking or keeping in the fridge.  If you love the classic caprese or "tomatoe salad" at your favorite restaurant, you're going to be so happy to have found this recipe!

Yummy and easy!  I marinated everything for a few hours before skewering.  I would have added balsamic vinagrette, but a person at the party is allergic to it.  Instead, I found a squeeze bottle of balsamic vinagrette glaze at the store and used it as a dip.  Big hit!  I realize I could have made the reduction myself, but time was of the essence and I did not want my other food to smell like vinegar!  Anyway, wonderful finger food for a party!

Great recipe, and oh so simple.  I halved the tomatoes and the cheese, putting the halves together on one toothpick with a fresh basil leaf between, and they were the first to go.

I made this for a birthday party.  Big hit!!  I added italian seasoning to the olive oil mixture and sprinkled parmesan cheese after skewering.  It was very delicious.  I used skewers instead of toothpicks.  It fits everything nicely.

I have not made this recipe but have one fairly close. I use marinated boconccini balls and halve them as well as the Santa Sweet tomatoes. Santa Sweet (maybe cherub tomotoes too) are the best tomatoes for this type of appetizer or just palin snacking! I use the whole basil leave between the cheese and tomato. I like to use the "fancy" toothpicks with the frill on the end and customize to event - red/green for holidays, team colors for game day. Just before serving I will drizzle the marinade from boconccini balls over the tomatoes/cheese to "freshen up". Also sprinkle with chopped basil.

Just a simple twist on an old classic recipe and you really can't go wrong with this.  I am of the opinion that no food is perfect without garlic but unfortunately, not everyone shares my view.  So...I often begin by cutting a garlic clove in half and rubbing the cut side on the serving dish.  It provides the wonderful aroma of garlic and only a hint of flavor.  I also like to add a light drizzle of balsamic vinegar.

I give this recipe a 5 star because not only was it delicious, but it was so EASY, my favorite ingredient for a recipe.  I followed the recipe as is, using boconccini mozerella balls, and I added balsamic vinegar and marinated for approx 3 hours before serving.  I wish that I had time to take a picture, but they were such a hit that they were gone in minutes.  I'm making this one again for Christmas Eve.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe Jessi

Everyone loved this! Only thing I did different is use marinated mozzarella and I cut the tomatoes and mozzarella balls in half and drizzled with the marinade and sprinkled kosher salt. I made them the day before the party and they were perfect.

Super fast and easy to make for a large party.  But flavor-wise, just O.K.  It needs the extra flavor you can only get with a plated caprese salad with balsamic vinegar (which doesn't adhere to the mozzarella balls).

I agree that good mozzarella and marinating is the key to making this outstanding, and not just okay. I didn't have much time so I wasn't able to marinate them any. I used kabobs and made a ton for a baby shower.

This is a very easy & delicious recipe. I tweeked it by adding 4 tablespoons of golden balsamic vinegar (because I didn't want to change the color) plus 1 clove of minced garlic, 1/2 teaspoon Italian Seasoning herbs, & a half a pinch of chili flakes for a touch of heat. Allow to marinate for 3+ hours. I did not chop the basil or put it in the marinade.

We have had these many times recently! We love them! I make it this way for my dad and then I put the mozzarella and tomatoes in a large Ziploc and add about 3 tablespoons of balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing. This way everyone gets a different flavor! We LOVE These!

I really liked this.  A premium mozzaella is a must.  I used a deli mozzarella and it just made it so so.  Tasted better after sitting over night.

Good but not terrific.  Add balsamic vinegar to marinade and use leftovers in a salad.

I served these as an appetizer to my Thanksgiving meal. I followed the recipe but added a balsamic "glaze" by drizzling on it the platter prior to placing the tomato and mozzarella picks on top of it. The glaze I used is Acetaia del Casato Bertoni Crema which I purchased in Italy but there are balsamic glazes available at grocery/specialty stores here in the U.S. that are just as good.

This recipe is a keeper and so simple to make... We did them a little differently by omitting the olive oil and substituting Balsamic Vinegar.  We assembled the tomatoes, basil leaf and mozzarella (we used the mozzarella pearls that are available here) on the stick and then just drizzled the balsamic vinegar over them... totally delicious..

I have made this tons of time.  I don't add olive oil, instead, I sprinkle flavored basalmic vinegar on it.  (Espresso flavor is a hit)

Great recipe. Used Ciliegine Fresh Mozzarella balls marinated in olive oil and basil, grape tomatoes, fresh Basil. Combined tomatoes and marinated mozarrella and refrigerated overnight. Seasoned mixture with salt and pepper. Cut mozzarella balls in halves.  Cut fresh basil in smaller pieces.  Skewered cheese, piece of basil and then tomato.

I made these for a shower and they turned out very well but I slightly modified the recipe.  I cut the tomatoes in half and speared half a tomato, a piece of basil (small leaf or half a large leaf, NOT chopped), half a mozzarella ball, and then the other half of the tomato.  I salted and peppered and then added balsamic vinegar.  I also used the mozzarella that was in italian herb seasoning at the store.  It was great!  Can't make these too far ahead of time though because the basil will wilt a little bit.

This was so lovely to bring to our summer get together.  Everyone enjoyed.  Like other reviewers I included a good balsamic vinegar in the mix. I found Pearl size mozzarella balls which were a bit smaller and adorable!! Easy to put together and made a really nice presentation.  Very Good!!

Great for a party. I also drizzled with balsamic reduction of 4 parts balsamic vinegar to 1 part honey simmered for 10 minutes till thick. Since I used cubes of mozzarella the vinegar clung to the cheese and the basil leaves. I didn't pour olive oil on them and that may have made it easier for the vinegar to cling as well.

Easy to make and delicious. Rating 4 stars for recipe as is, but we modified the assembly and I prefer the changes we made

We halved the tomatoes and put strips of basil leaves between them and the mozzerella, drizzled with the oil, then spritzed them with balsamic vinegar in a spray bottle.

A little on the bland side. I think that letting it marinate in the mixture with balsamic would help it. We ended up just serving as a salad instead of putting on skewers.

For added flavor, rinse the tomatoes and roll in sea salt or other dry spices while they are still wet. The spices will stick to the skin and add that little bit of flavor.  When you are finished assembling the skewers, stack in layers facing opposite directions (like a tic tac toe board) and drizzle lightly with balsamic.

OK, when I got this in my inbox, I first thought it said "Corpse on a Stick". I thought, it's not Halloween already is it? For the record it was August 22, LOL. 
But I made them and they are wonderful. I will be making a bunch for my son's wedding picnic in a couple of weeks. Took others suggestions and added balsamic vinegar.

I have made something similar to this, but stacked on a cracker:  slice or fresh mozzarella, bit of tomato, basil leaf, drizzle with olive oil.  so scrumptious.  I shall make these skewers, too.  Some great ideas offered for this recipe, too.  woohoo

Great appetizer and healthy snack. I use the Formaggio marinated mozzarella balls from costco and cut them in half. Sometimes I cut the tomatoes in half depending on their size. I also but a folded basil leaf in the middle. Once the skewers are done, I drizzle with the marinade and some balsamic vinegar.

Fixed these for a cocktail party, doubled the recipe and only had 12 people at the party and they were gone within the first 30 minutes. I did sprinkle balsamic vinegar over them after plating them and I think this completed the taste of Caprese. Will be making again for sure.

It's a keeper. I marinated the mozzarella chees in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Instead of chopping the basil I put about a 3/4 inch piece of basil between the cheese and tomato. Will make again.

Like others, I added a little balsamic vinegar to the mix and served with extra balsamic on the side for drizzling. They were gone very fast. To me the keys are really fresh mozzarella, first rate olive oil, and well aged balsamic. I used 20 year old. Delicious!

So yummy. What a fun & easy way to do the delish combo of mozzarella, tomatoes, & basil. I couldn't stop eating these. And my family loved them. Even my picky little girl who "doesn't like cheese."

Delicious! I threw all ingredients into a ziplock and let the flavors marry while I worked on a few other dishes. By the time I was done, they were ready to be stuck together. I used one package of grape tomatoes and two packages of ore packaged mozzarella balls. My husband and daughter do not like tomatoes but they loved the combination of the tasty 1:1 ratio.

I made these for Christmas Eve.  I bought the mozzarella balls that are seasoned.  I cut the tomatoes and cheese balls in half.  I put a tomato half on each side of the cheese ball with the fresh basil in between.  I was not sure how these would manage being marinated, but next time I will marinate more. I saved the cheese marinade,  added some balsamic vinegar, lemon, salt and pepper.  Made the appetizer, then drizzled the marinade over them.  I had leftovers, which showed me they are even better the next day. I kept the marinade in a container and served it with the appetizer, along with reduced balsamic vinegar.  My sister loved this recipe.  I think I will use an entire cheese ball per appetizer next time, I personally think the tomatoes cut in half make it easier to eat.

I haven't tried this yet, but I've made lots of tomato salads.  I am going to try this ,but add some fresh or granulated garlic and let it marinade for a which is what I do with all my tomato salads.  Oh, and please don't add vinegar to tomato salad per my Italian grandma..... tomatoes already have acid. I'm glad Jessi didn't.

Easy recipe and always a big hit! Perfect bite size appetizers. I prefer to let them sit in the olive oil and bv mixture for at least 20 minutes before serving so they really get some of that taste. Another trick I've done is place them standing upright in a small cup so they absorb the flavors as well.

This was a hit with company.  I used pre-marinated small mozzarella balls. One hour to serving, I added 1 T. of balsamic vinegar to the container, also put 24 grapes tomatoes in and let them all blend.  Then using 4" skewers, I placed 1/2 tomato, then 1/2 mozzarella, then basil leaf, then other 1/2 mozzerella, then other 1/2 tomato.  Lastly sprinkled lightly with salt and pepper just before serving.  Larger skewers helped people grab the appetizer better.

I first made these appetizers as described and I thought they were a little bland.  So I poured a little balsamic vinegar over the cheese and let that soak a couple of hours before I assembled them.  They were a hit!

An almost healthy appetizer!  Very tasty.  Can also be served in small bowls as a side dish as they do in Italy.  The only changes I made were to use cocktail bocconcini instead of the mozzarella and a mixture of golden and grape tomatoes.

This recipe is quick and very easy to make. I added a little Italian Seasoning to the mix and halved the grape tomatoes to make it easier to eat. Next time I will drizzle some Balsomic Vinagrette over the top to add some kick.

This is one of my favorite things to eat. I never thought to put it on tooth picks like little skewers though! Great Idea. I use fresh Mozzarella balls instead of cubed and add balsamic vinegar. I Think it may also taste good with red wine vinegar? I will try that soon. I typically eat this at least once a week.

Recipe missing crucial tip: always sit out fresh mozzarella in a bowl of salted warm water prior to eating. MUST be served at room temp for fresh milky flavor to come through.

Great tasting! I make them with the bocconcini balls that are about the same size as the tomatoes. Once I arrange them on a serving dish, I drizzle them with a balsamic reduction. The reduction has a really rich flavour and is syrupy enough to hold onto the veggies and cheese.

Super easy recipe for a tasty, colorful appetizer.  Marinated mozzarella in olive oil and basil and crushed italian seasoning. Halved the grape tomatoes and skewered a grape tomato half, then a piece of basil, then a mozzarella ball, then a piece of basil, then the other half of the grape tomato.  Presented well on the plate and everyone loved them!

Update: Made it again, this time I did 2 Tbsp Balsamic Vinegar and 1 tsp olive oil and salt and pepper all together . Pour over tomatoes and cheese. add basil and mix well. Marinate for a few hours. Then skewer.. Will let you know how that works out!!
Later: Great! Make sure you add enough salt and pepper. And skewer a little leaf of fresh Basil on each skewer between the cheese and the tomato for more flavor.

These are so easy and always a hit! Plus, the presentation always looks good. I like to add a little balsamic vinegar and marinate everything for a few hours.

Four stars as written.  Then I made it, as many other reviewers suggested with a tablespoon or two of balsamic vinegar.  That did the trick to a five star!  I didn't add the salt or pepper - not necessary.  So good that this is going to be my dinner when The Husband is out of town!

Made this for a party and it was great! I like mine with balsamic vinegar and will serve it on the side in a small dish next time. I added the vinegar to the marinade and I don't think it did much for the presentation ; I also served it plain with a basil leaf for those who might prefer no dressing. I used grape and sungold cherry tomatoes from my garden. This is a simple but delicious starter to any meal or just as a snack. Thanks for sharing!

I made these to take to a summer party.  I made them as directed and then drizzled a balsamic reduction over them.  They were a huge  hit and so easy to put together.

Amazing little appetizer. I put a little dollop of pesto on each and sprinkled with a touch of balsamic vinegar in the middle. Also, I skewered a small leaf of basil between the tomato and the cheese. It was a hit!

A real hit at my house! I did add 2 TBL of a good quality balsamic vinegar as well as a bit of oregano & garlic powder as this is how I make my traditional caprese salad. I also marinated everything for about 24 hours. My family likes this better than my traditional recipe! I use fresh basil from my in door garden.

I added a small cube of Pepper Jack Cheese along with the Mozzarella.  In addition soaking the Mozzarella in olive oil with minced garlic, pear infused balsamic vinegar and dried tarragon 
 for a couple of days gave everything an extra punch.   Putting a small slice in the tomatoes and soaking them with the above for a couple of hours really adds an extra bang.

This is less a recipe and more a creative idea.   I do appreciate it,   made for a great antipasti for a dinner party.   I'd totally do it again.  I'd suggest using the best fresh mozzarella peals you can come across.

So, so good.  If you're in a hurry, or just want to save a step, use this short cut...purchase the Marinated mozzarella balls and brush the finished skewers with the marinade.

Great party food. I soaked my cheese cubes overnight in garlic basil, oregano, salt and pepper and olive oil, This step made the cheese taste amazing. No need to buy the expensive little mozzarella balls in oil.

These were very good and easy. I used string cheese mozzarella to make the prep quick; and to add extra flavor, I used jalapeno string cheese. Some of the reviews mentioned the recipe needed extra flavor so I also added some Italian spices.

I made over 300 of these for my son's wedding.  I marinated the boconccini and tomatoes in herbs, oil, and white balsamic overnight.  I like the white balsamic because it doesn't discolor the cheese, and it has a mellower flavor than red. 
I used short wooden skewers so they were generous - 2 each cheese and tomatoes.  One of my favorite appetizers, and SO easy, lovely to look at.

Delicious with nice sweet tomatoes and I used Mozzarella "pearls" to save time. I could have used more basil than just the partial leaves that I cut up. I should have followed the picture and sprinkled some small pieces on top after adding the balsamic glaze.

It was ok according to the recipe. I added an aged balsamic to give it a little more flavor and pull it up to four stars.

I made these for a NYE party and I received so many compliments on these. I think I could bring these to any party and they would be a big hit. I had to limit how many my husband had before the party started, otherwise I wouldn't have had any left :).

Really tasty and a great, fun and easy appetizer my guests loved.  Added to my appetizer recipe rotation.  I found an unused pound of mushrooms back in the fridge, quartered and marinated them using the marinated mushroom recipe from this site, and added to the skewer along with the tomatoes and the mozzarella.    I marinated the mini mozzarella balls in the same vinaigrette as the mushrooms, using a white wine vinegar to preserve this recipe's pretty presentation.  Thank you for the inspiration, Jessi!

I made this as a light and healthy appetizer before our big Thanksgiving meal and thoroughly enjoyed it. I only wish I’d used fresh mozzarella balls.  Instead, I used an 8 oz. block of mozzarella that I had on hand and cut it into 24 squares. It was okay, but harder to chew. Also the basil turned dark in the oil . One guest asked if it was caviar. Ha!
It was black!

A simple classic that's hard to mess up, but let me share how I did! In attempting to get people together and take advantage of these final grillable days, my family decided to throw a BBQ bash for everyone on our street. I thought these caprese apps would be the PERFECT starter and wanted to go even bigger. We loaded them up onto kebab skewers and threw these puppies on the grill! A little char goes a long way folks. Unfortunately, the mozzarella cheese pretty much melted immediately, plopping cheesy goo all over our burners. DO NOT PUT MOZZARELLA CHEESE ON THE GRILL, YOU WILL REGRET IT. After that debacle, we started from scratch and followed the recipe. Delicious! I just wish the neighbors hadn't seen our initial failure...

Extremely easy, yummy and great on the budget!  At the suggestion of others, I used balsamic vinegar which gave it a great taste and instead of salt and pepper I used an envelope of dried Italian dressing and let it marinade overnight.  I made 50 of them and they were gone in a heartbeat

I made this for a party but did make a couple of changes. I used marinated mozzarella balls from Costco and added a small, folded strip of thin sliced deli ham along with the fresh basil and the tomato. It was so easy and a huge hit!

Make this frequently because it is easy, beautiful to serve and delicious -- always a hit!  I use the fish mozzarella 'pearls' and instead of putting basil in the marinade, I thread a basil leave on the toothpick: basil leaf- half a cherry tomato-the mozzarella pearl and then the other half of the tomato.  I've been asked to bring it to community fund-raising programs, and it disappears in minutes!

Super easy, and very tasty.  I decided to make this appetizer as an add-on to my potluck commitment and it was a great addition to the app table. I received many compliments on how tasty it was and loved that it was a "healthy" alternative to chips and dips.

This recipe is a fantastic spring board onto so many  wonderful options... the simple caprese salad skewer is fresh, delicious and easy to prepare. I upped it a notch by buying the small mozzarella balls and marinating them in really good olive oil, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and garlic. I halved the balls, the tomatoes, and added cooked al dente cheese tortellini to the skewers. once finished, I drizzled some balsamic reduction over the skewers and finished them off with a sprinkle of fresh basil. They literally disappeared within minutes at our Christmas party!

Very fast and easy recipe for a holiday gathering. A fairly healthy but still tasty appetizer. I used the cherry sized fresh mozzarella balls. One tub of the cheese and one tub of cherry tomatoes filled a Chinet platter sized paper plate for our office pot luck. Easy cleanup! Great idea, I like Caprese salad but would not have come up with serving it in this manner.

This was awesome! I had small toothpicks so just put one tomato and two slices of cheese, 2 pieces of basil on each end. I used the sliced mozzerella cheese in the deli (quartered) and soaked it in an olive oil mixture with garlic and seasonings for several hours. After assembling, I sprinkled with a little more garlic, salt, dried basil flakes and drizzled with a balsamic vinegar reduction sauce. Everyone loved these. Thanks!

easy and fabulous!!! I had these ready hours early and they were perfect and well received....didn't have any left!  and I was only able to grab two for myself...they were the perfect appetizer.  Bite size, didn't have to stay warm or stay cold, and were bright in color and in taste!

It was a little bland.  Next time I will add lemon to the sauce or drizzle a balsamic glaze over the top or both.  Great for a group.

Used fresh basil from the garden and it was a taste explosion!
Speared on a watermelon slice and it was a huge hit.

I love it! The only thing I would do a little different is between the tomato and cheese is add a clove of roasted garlic then on the side I would have Balsamic vinegar to drizzle if desired.

Made for a New Year’s Eve party.  Really enjoyed but next time I’d add some salt and Maybe Italian Seasoning or Oregano to oil.  Was just a bit bland for me.  I love all the ingredients and how easy it is to throw together.

I made it but I also added a piece of genoa salami and instead of using olive oil I allowed the tomatoes to marinate in some Italian salad dressing. I felt this made the appetizer go from pretty and bland to pretty and zippy.

I wanted a low carb appetizer for a European menu.  I purchased what I thought was mozzarella balls but it turned out to be a string of mozzarella that was seasoned.  I cut in inch pieces and added more fresh basil as well as balsamic and a little olive oil.  I let them marinate for a couple of hours in the frig.  And used sprigs of basil around the corners of a yellow/orange square plate.  I used toothpicks and put a grape tomato and piece of cheese around the edges.  In the center of the plate  I had dessert dish that has a stem which raised it above the plate and added the rest of the tomatoes that didn’t have cheese for.  And sprinkled everything lightly with a little sea salt.  They were a hit!  And looked pretty. I thought I took a photo however I cannot find it.

Simple and tasty. I agree with the other reviewer's that it needs some kind of vinaigrette or Italian dressing either to drizzle on top or to marinade the cheese in before hand.

I love this version of caprese salad!  I added sides of balsamic vinegar and different olive oils for dipping.  It was a big hit!

I did this, but not on skewers, just in a bowl.  Bad idea, because as it sat in some of the balsamic, the cheese turned brown.  Wasn't as appealing to look at as I hoped it would be.

Served this before dinner last night, and my guests were very complimentary.  The recipe is very easy, so ease of preperation and enjoyment by the guests equals five stars.

The prep work for this was a little more time-consuming, but well worth the effort.  Everyone loved being able to eat them without a knife and fork.  I'll make it this way again.

Tasty, healthy, delicious and simple!!!  We made these for the first time about two weeks ago and we couldn't make them fast enough; they were devoured.  Like others, we also chopped up the basil while using a few of the larger chopped basil leaves to thread between each piece of cheese/tomato.  We'll certainly kept this as one of our go-to appetizer recipes to satisfy our guests ...

I have also made this appetizer by simply wrapping, or placing a piece of, a basil leaf on top of the mozarella (I use the fresh mozarella pearls.  Then I skewer it and on the bottom use the tomato which has been sliced to have a flat side (flat side down on the plate).  Place them on a platter and drizzle with balsamic glaze.  So delicious and makes a beautiful plate!  These are really pretty because of the color for Christmas!

Made these for an "appetizer day" at work and everyone loved them! I mixed olive oil and balsamic vinegar together in small bowl and taste tested until it was the right amount of both and tossed with rest of ingredients. Very yummy! They were all gone which is always a good sign!

I made this in a hurry with bocconcini which turned out to be slices, not balls. A bit too bland, so next time I will add some herbs, some balsamic, and marinate. Delicious, elegant, and fool-proof idea that will definitely become a staple.

I also marinated the cheese and used medium bamboo skewers, with two cheese bites and one tomato per skewer.  Easy and very pretty.

Even better if you marinate the cheese and tomatoes overnight with the olive oil and basil.

Delicious, super easy and beautiful presentation! I made these for a party two hours away and they traveled surprisingly well in a small cooler. I cut the bottoms off the tomatoes so I could stand the skewers. I drizzled a balsamic reduction over the top once we arrived (made the day before and stored in a sealed container). The plate was empty within 30 seconds of being set out! Love this recipe!!

Using the highest quality ingredients and the peak of season will make this recipe shine. I like drizzling with a balsamic reduction and olive oil or basil pesto if ingredients aren't quite up to par.

Have made this recipe twice and company enjoyed it.  I cut my grape tomatoes in half and used the small mozzarella balls ,also cut in half using unwaxed dental floss for ease of poking on the toothpick. A definite hit.

I made the recipe as-is for a bridal shower, except that I doubled it. They were gone in no time. So incredibly simple yet they look elegant and taste delicious. I will definitely  be making this again for future cocktail parties. They are fun to make on decorated toothpicks.
