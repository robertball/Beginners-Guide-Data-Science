First of all, Chel79 is correct that this sauce is good on ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING.  We LOVE it on chicken (either grilled, cooked in the oven, or a cold sandwich).  Also good on salmon and talapia.  Great as a taco chip dip, or with veggies.  As far as the recipe goes, I followed it except put the roasted red peppers in a glass bowl covered with a lid for about 15 minutes, rather than in a plastic bag (don't care for the idea of the hot peppers in plastic).  I cut the amount of olive oil in half, and still think it could be cut down more.  Other than that, this stuff is fabulous, and everyone who has tried it, from teenagers to adults, LOVES it!!  Try this!!!  It's easy and ssssooooo good!!

This is a fantastic recipe! We cook large batches of it and freeze it in 1.5 cup portions. One portion is enough to cook 1-2 chickens in, and boy does it make that chicken taste good! You can also use it on any meaty type of fish. Delicious beyond words!

This recipe is excellent - very easy to make and provides awesome flavour even if just used as a maranade for meat.  I've used it with chicken, beef and pork tenderloin - all with excellent results!
I even added a bit to rice when cooking and that worked well too!
I also use it as a dip for pretty much anything - including Broccolli.  
It's a little spicy, but not hot - very nice flavouring.
I'm going to try the green next!

I marinated a couple chicken breasts (not before reserving some to eat later with plantains) and threw them on the grill.  It was some of the best chicken I've done on the grill.  Very moist.  Even my picky 8 year old loved it.

This had good flavor, but was very thin  so I can't see it being used as a dip.  Also very oily.  Perhaps I didn't add enough parsley, but I was not sure at all how much a "bunch" is.  I would consider this more a marinade as it turned out, rather than a dip or sauce.  For those reasons I didn't rate it higher, but it has potential.

Used this for arepitas topped with queso fresco! Yum, que rico!  I did use 2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce instead of the pepper flakes and left out the vinegar since some don't like it in my house.

This was delicious, I cut the oil to 1/2c as 1 would have been a bit much for our tastes.  We used it as a dip for corn chips and empanadas but it also goes great with chicken.

I followed the recipe exactly as written except cut the olive oil in half as per another review.  This sauce is unbelievably salty.   I will try it again & cut the salt by 2 tablespoons.  I think 1T of kosher salt will be plenty.

tasted this right after completion & was disappointed, but the next day, I understood why everyone loved this.  I had it on a corn tortilla along with eggs for breakfast- delicious.  It obviously needs to set up to blend the flavors.  Also, I had fine kosher salt for the salt/water mixture which yielded VERY salty.  I only used about 2 T of the mixture in my sauce. Just be sure to taste the sauce as your adding this in small quantities so you can judge the saltiness before you dump in the whole 1 C.mixture.

Well, this was my first time trying chimchurri. I used half the recommended oil and half the recommended salt.  3 Tbls of salt would be way too much. I'm not a big vinegar fan but I found the taste interesting. We used it for a dip with crackers. Tomorrow I will try it on chicken. The recipe makes a lot!
