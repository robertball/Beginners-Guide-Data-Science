I was surprised at how much better it was the next day when the flavors really came together. I made a few changes, only because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, but they were slight. I used pecans instead of cashews and used regular raisins instead of golden, and used craisins instead of dried cherries.  The roasted beets were delicious in this salad, and a great way to use up the beets from the garden. I also added about 2-3 extra beets. One other change was to the method of prep: I poured dressing (only used about 1/2) on just the kale and massaged the dressing onto the kale with my fingers. I do this with another kale salad and it really softens the kale, but doesn't make it soggy. Then I added the remaining ingredients. Thanks for the recipe!

Incredibly delicious! I will make this again and again. I didn't have apple cider so I used apple juice. Also because of what I had, used pecans and pine nuts in place of cashews, regular raisins, and dried cranberries. I massaged the kale a bit with a drizzle of olive oil and salt before mixing with other items because I like my kale a bit softer. Great recipe and super versatile. The beets were a wonderful complement to the kale.

Takes a while to prepare since the beets need to roast over an hour. But they are soooooo good roasted! I'm not a big kale fan, it is bitter. I used almonds, walnuts and cashews. Not crazy about the cashews, next time leave out. I'll submit another review after it sits awhile.

I made as directed using golden and red beets, and massaged the dressing into the kale. This salad looks as wonderful as it tastes!

I made this exactly as written and massaged the dressing into the kale like others suggested. I did toss in some ch√®vre. I was not a believer in eating raw kale until I tried this salad. My husband also said he loved the flavor and texture better than "regular salad". Thanks for sharing!

Great fall salad! :-)  I made this but had no cider, so as others suggested, used apple juice & a teaspoon of sugar.  Threw in some roasted sweet potato too!  BEAUTIFUL COLORS!  Topped with goat cheese.  Doubled the dressing ( I like lots!)  Dressed the salad, left to marinate in fridge while the beets and sweet potato roasted, then plated &  topped with cheese, and drizzled a bit more dressing on top! :-):-):-)Will make again, but already have enough leftovers to have for lunch again tomorrow! :-) :-) (only 2 of us)...May add some grains ....yummy! :-) :-)

This recipe is delicious. I made it the day before and stored it in the fridge since other reviewers noted it was better the 2nd day. I had red beets (not golden) and regular raisins, because that's what the store had but it didn't make a difference in flavor. For my beets I did peel and dice them prior to roasting in order to save time.

This is just wonderful!  I used kale and beets that I got from our CSA.  Our bunch of kale was rather small, so I added some spinach as well.  Absolutely delicious!

Used spinach in place of kale (what I had in the fridge) and yellow beets.  Also added the chevre before serving.  Very good beat salad.

I did not have apple cider or apple cider vinegar, so I used rice wine vinegar and 2 tablespoons of mirin ( not sure why, but it worked lol)

I roasted 3 beets but only put two in the salad, these were seriously large beets.  I was heavy-handed with the golden raisins and substituted pomegranate juice for the apple cider.  I used homemade mustard for the Dijon.
I really enjoyed it, even without the goat cheese.  But  it's even better with the chevre!

We made this for a potluck dinner party and it was a big hit. We followed the recipe more or less:  hubby cut up the beets before roasting and they were ready in about 20 minutes. I bought raw, unsalted cashews and put them in the oven for about 5 minutes while the beets were roasting.  We only had spiced apple cider, but that actually gave a little nice bite to the dressing. This is a perfect recipe for a fall or winter dinner!  I've added it to my favorites.

Fantastic salad! I followed the advice of others and "massaged" the dressing into the kale leaves, tossed remaining ingredients and refrigerated overnight to help soften the kale and blend/bring out the flavors. Served with crumbled goat cheese to rave reviews. Very colorful and flavorful. Will definitely make again.

Made as written, except substituted slivered almonds for the cashews, as that's what I had on hand. Incredible flavor, and so healthy besides!

This salad is divine. I agree that the salad is much better the next day. In my version, I used blood orange-infused olive oil that came from a local olive oil store. I also did not have apple cider, so I used a box of apple Juicy Juice that I had in the crisper. I took it to a potluck, and it got rave reviews.

Delicious recipe! I pretty much followed as written. I would suggest peeling, cubing, and then roasting beets. it makes the process a little quicker and easier. I used cashews, dried cranberries, and regular raisins. Taste great, this will be on repeat for me!
