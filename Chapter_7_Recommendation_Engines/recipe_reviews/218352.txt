My family enjoyed this dish.  It is a little on the bland side, although I still liked it.  My hubby and son added some hot sauce to their bowls and declared it perfect!  I do not see a reason to put the veggies and olive oil in first.  I threw everything in together (with no olive oil) and cooked for 4 1/2 hours and it was perfect.  The veggies were plenty soft.  Left out the garbanzo beans.  They just sounded wrong with baked beans.  Overall an easy, comfort food type of meal!

This was very bland, there was no contrast in flavors. Everything had the same texture. The beans seemed to be a flavorless filler and the dish relied heavily on the sausage for taste. The tomatoes along with the backed bean liquid would be too tomato-y. The garbanzo beans had a weird texture. using canned baked beans doesn't have the same depth that making your own beans. I wouldn't say that it make 8 servings. (well not for my husband).  I "doctored" it up a bit. I added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/2 tsp chili powder. Salt and pepper to taste. I added some water to thin it because it seemed too thick.  I used a smoked sausage similar to kielbasa called "slovenian" sausage I get locally. I served it over rice and with corn bread. I am not sure I would make it again.

This was in the middle for us...meaning we were divided on the dish. While 2 of my girls liked it, my son, said..he couldn't get past the taste. My oldest said it was weird and I thought about the same... The flavor was, different, had a weird taste of baked beans with a black lash of cumin. However, I love all the ingredients individually but just wasn't my cup of tea. Even if i followed to a T. So sorry, I don't even know how to correct this, to make again. So there for, I regret in not making this again.

Portions were pretty small and the flavor wasn't very strong.  I liked it, but not enough to make it again.

I used jalapenos, bushes baked beans original and fire roasted tomatoes in mine while the rest of the recipe stayed the same. It was fantastic and I'll be making this again.

Choose a smoked sausage you like and a flavor of baked beans you like because most of the flavor of this soup/stew comes from those ingredients. It is not spicy. If you wanted more heat, I think spicy tomatoes and chilis (Rotel) or chili-ready tomatoes could be used in place of the can of tomatoes. We don't love spicy heat, so we found this to be just right and tasty. I made the recipe as written. I appreciated cooking the vegetables for an hour first. I had no complaints about crunchy onions in my slow cooker food! Everyone liked this dish. I rated it a 4 because one of us thought it was not hot enough and added hot sauce.
