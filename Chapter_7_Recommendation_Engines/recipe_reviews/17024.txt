My family & friends loved this. I didn't exactly follow the recipe though. I put my own twist on it and it turned out better than I would've thought. 
I used 1 can of cream of cheddar, 1 can of cream of mushroom, and 1 can of cream of chicken. I added 1/2 cup of milk, 2 teaspoons of garlic powder, a bit of mrs. dash, and 1 tablespoon of curry. Then after it cooked on low for 5-6 hours I added a bag of frozen veggies (broccoli, califlower, & carrots). I let it cook for another 1/2 hour on low and it was fabulous. We had it over rice. My friends all asked for the recipe.

This was a big hit!  I used 4 chicken breasts, 2 cans of cheddar soup, 1 can of cream of chicken, 1/2 cup milk.  I seasoned the chicken breasts with garlic and italian seasoning, then dumped the soup & milk mixture on top.  I cooked on low all day (about 7 hours) and it was PERFECT!  I served it over brown rice that I cooked with chicken broth instead of water, and even my 19-month-old loved it!  She had seconds! I will use the leftover sauce and rice to make enchiladas tomorrow!

Sorry this is lengthy, but this was a great starter recipe as other have said. I followed the recipe but added Italian seasoning, parsley, Mrs. Dash, and a handful or two of cheddar cheese. The dumplings I did was my mothers recipe, for 4/5 drop dumplings I did 1 cup flour,1tsp baking soda, dash salt, dash sugar and  enough water to make it sticky. Dropped them in the crock pot 30-45 minutes before dinner. right before we ate I topped with a little more cheese. It was creamy and smelled SO good. Made this way, my husband LOVED it and he's not a big fan of dumplings. Growing up with this dish I would have to say this was one of the best recipes, and it's REALLY easy!

I've made this for a long time, with the following change:
I mix 1 can Cheddar Cheese soup with 2 cans Cream of Chicken soup.  Then just pour over the 6 chicken breasts and cook over low heat all day.
Shred at the end and serve over rice.
YUM!

I added a step. I seasoned the chicken (salt, pepper & garlic powder) then browned in a pan with Smart Balance (butter). I then put  chicken in crock. Added milk to the pan to loosen bits.  Used 1 can of soup &  1/2 jar Tostito's 'Salsa Con Queso' ( it's a medium spicy cheese dip for chips). It made for a richer cheesy flavor & a bit of a kick.

When you work all day the last thing you want to think about when you walk in the front door is........what am I going to fix my family for dinner? It is rare that the 4 of us agree on new recipes, but this one was a big hit for all of us. I will make it again and again. I even shared the recipe with the girls at work and their families enjoyed it just as much!

This is sooo yummy! I changed it a bit. I added one can of Cheddar cheese soup and two cans of cream of chicken soup. I omitted the milk and added water. After I cooked the sauce with the chicken for 6 hours, I shredded the chicken, dumped in a can of green beans and a box of stuffing mix. I cooked all of it together for 30 mins.... It is delicious!!!

Yummmm! This chicken dish is sooo good! I followed the recipe to the note and it came out so creamy and wonderful. The garlic powder does add a garlic like smell to the house while cooking. Even my 3 year old thought this was great! I served it with noodles. I will make this one agian for sure.

This was awful.  There was no cheese taste to it whatsoever after it was cooked.  It tasted like greasy fried chicken with a thick paste on it.  Would not recommend it at all.

Followed the directions with a few changes, instead of adding garlic powder, I minced one garlic clove, but one isn't enough.  I actually kept it on high for 5 hours then turned it down to low for 2 hours.  The cheese sauce was perfect.  Ate it over NoYolk egg noodles.  Will do it again!  Really easy!

TIP:  I used one can cheddar soup and 1 can Fiesta Cheese Soup (both Campbells) and it gave it more flavor.  Next time I will use 2 cans Fiesta.  I loved how much sauce there was, how easy it was to prepare (few ingredients) and the fact that I didn't have to touch it all day.  Also, I mixed it with whole green beans which went really well with the rice.  Next time I will also add more veggies and some more spices - maybe a couple dashes of hot sauce or some red pepper flakes. I will definitely make again!

I wasn't sure what my family would think of this - it seems so simple.  But - Wow!  Everyone loved it!  I had thrown this in the crockpot so we would have dinner quickly, and I threw some quartered potatoes in the bottom of the slow cooker.  When I got home all I did was steam some broccoli and dinner was ready.  It was such a hit that my husband was talking about it at work and all the ladies requested the recipe.    A very nice, quick and easy dinner!

This is a very easy recipe and very good.  Like others, I adjusted the recipe slightly and used 1 can of cheddar cheese soup and 1 can cream of chicken soup with 1/2 cup milk.  Seasoned with garlic salt and pepper and let cook all day.  I added some brocolli about an hour before I was going to eat and served over rice.  It was excellent, will definitely make again.

This recipe is a great base for experimenting with chicken crockpot cooking.  I used one can of Herbed Cream of Chicken, one can of regular Cream of Chicken, one can of Cheddar Soup and one can of milk.  I seasoned it with Mrs. Dash, seasoned salt, pepper and a bit of garlic powder.  I cooked on high for 6 hours and the chicken was just falling apart!  My family loved it.  My picky three year old ate a whole piece of chicken.  I served it over white rice made with chicken broth instead of water.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you!

Good jumping off point. ALWAYS use frozen chicken breasts in the slow cooker. They come out so much more moist and tender. I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cheddar cheese soup. Added a splash of white wine. Served over brown rice. The 2 men and 1 year old in my house ate it up!!

Love how easy this is! I have made many times. Ive used bagged frozen chicken breasts right from freezer and stills turns out great. My kids love it over rice with a scoop of the cheese sauce.

I only rated this recipe 2 stars only because it was boring. After I made it my way it was definately a five star recipe! I didnt use any of these ingredients except garlic. I used 5 chicken breasts because thats all I had 1 jar of ragu double cheddar cheese, i can 10oz. cream of chicken soup (only because my husband doesnt like mushrooms),1 10oz. can of Rotel diced tomatoes with lime juice and cilantro drained in a colander and mashed down to get all of the juice out. iT WAS TO DIE FOR. I served with white rice. It was gone in five minutes! You have to try it this way.

This was very good, however, I rated it 4 stars because I made some personal changes. First, because there are only 2 of us, I used 2 chicken breasts.  Second, my husband is a huge gravy and rice eater.  So, I used 1 can of cheddar soup, 1 can of low sodium cream of mushroom, and 1 can of low sodium cream of chicken. It's astonishing how much sodium is in soup, so I always pay a little extra and get the low sodium.  I added 1 tbsp of curry and 2 tbsp's of garlic powder.  About 30 min before serving, I added some frozen peas.  Served it over rice and had dinner ready after a hard day at work!!!

My family loved it! I did one can cream of chicken and one can of cheese, threw in a can of green chilies and let it cook all day. The chicken was falling apart and it was great served over rice.The leftovers made a great grab and go lunch for the next day.

My family is sooo picky they do not eat 90 % of what I would cook so I don't cook that much. This is the first recipe I have rated and that is because my son who hates sauces of any kind (my husband also) loved this meal. The whole family did...I was so excited that I found a meal for us to enjoy together. slight change...1 can cheddar, 1 can fiesta cheddar and 1 cream of chicken soup and extra seasonings. Awesome with rice!!

well one can only assume, when you put all this in the crockpot, make a pan of rice to go along side it, and then telling your hubby that dinner is at such and such time, you expect waking up from a nap, to find there's still food in the pot to at least try....in my case, there was not. What I can tell you is that the recipe was easy. I had no plain boneless chicken breast in my house...what I had was already seasoned in Italian herbs. So I used them, Follow the recipe to a T for everything else. And gave hubby the time line....Everyone raved how well it tasted, but there was nothing left for me to sample to verify. I did read some where about this recipe being bland. And in my case the chicken was not. Because the chicken was already seasoed. I will make again, because the family like this. Thank you.

Love it!  I took some others advice and (since I only made 3 chick breasts) just put in 1 can of cheddar and 1 crm of chicken + a little milk, salt and pepper of course.  Also, minced 2 garlic cloves (someone said 1 may not be enough and we love garlic).  It was perfect!  I cooked on high for 5 hours since I was running out of time.  Oh, I also put them in the crock frozen.  I didn't have high hopes for this recipe since our family likes things a bit more interesting (I thought).  But this was sooooo worth it and it will be in our rotation!  The flavor and smell was amazing for the small amount of ingredients that was in it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This has become a Crock Pot staple in our house!  Even my picky-eater kids like it, because it is so cheesy!  2 notes: (1)I like to cut the chicken breasts up into smaller chunks  - maybe 4 to 6 chunks per breast, of varying sizes.  This makes it easy at the table, because everyone can choose a serving size that suits them.  More importantly, the chicken cooks very MOIST when cut into smaller pieces (in large pieces, the center can be dry).  Thin-sliced chicken breast works great, also.  (2)This recipe is written for salt to be added "to taste".  While I am not a huge salt fan, I have found it very important in this recipe for the salt and garlic to be BALANCED.  Either use Garlic Salt in place of plain garlic in the recipe, or simply measure equal parts of each.

Wonderful recipe.  I put it on this morning and it really smelled good when I walked in after work.  It was wonderful.  Served it on rice.  Only addition was I added a small can of green chiles.  Delicious and my family loved it.

I make this often but use Campbell Fista cheese soup, let it cook then pour it all out and redo with fresh can of soup so that all the grease from the chicken is gone.  About the last hour of cooking.  It is wonderful!!!!!!!!!

we love this recipe! i use a can of cheese soup and a can of cream of mushroom, and throw in some cumin, curry powder & garlic & shredded cheddar cheese to jazz it up. Usually we shred the chicken & add a bag of frozen veggies at the tail end of cooking, & serve over rice for an easy & very tasty dinner.

I've made this recipe so often that even I am surprised. Many variations with the added ingredients. Add-in have included: red pepper flakes, spiracha garlic, quartered potatoes, over chow mein noodles, rice, thai noodles, thin spaghetti, garlic bread etc. NEVER anything left.

This was so Wonderful! I have made it several times now, and at least once a week. My whole family gets excited for it, especially the kids. I did follow some of the other suggestions and did 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1 of Cheddar cheese and 1 of Cream of chicken. I also added the Curry powder. It was so flavorful and made the house smell delicious. The Biggest Bonus of all, it literally takes 5 minutes to put in the crock pot.

My family loves this recipe. I cut up 4 chicken breasts and threw them on top of a 1/2 stick of butter. Then I seasoned the chicken with Italian seasoning, poultry seasoning, white pepper, celery seed, minced garlic, sprinkle of cayenne powder, and 1/2 onion chopped. Then I mixed Cream of mushroom, cheddar cheese soup, and golden mushroom with 1/2 Cup milk and poured it over the chicken. When the chicken was done herbed dumplings were dropped onto the gravy! It was amazing!!

This was really good.  I didn't add quite enough salt and pepper but the chicken was very moist and it made a nice gravy.  I added a package of frozen peas on top of the breasts and served it over mashed potatoes.

Super good and super easy!! This dish smells like possibilities :) I followed it pretty much to the book, but I cheated and lifted the lid about halfway through cooking, I just had to smell its cheesy goodness. I used 4 large chicken breasts cut into thirds, and instead of 1/2 cup milk I did about 1/4 plus a 'healthy' dollop of sour cream. Yum Yum Yum was great over noodles, I think next time I'll add broccoli and cauliflower. Thanks for a simple and delicious recipe Chris!

I find the color and the taste of any condensed cheese soup to be strange so I made this with reduced fat mushroom soup and added just one cup of shredded sharp cheese.  It came out just yummy and very cheesy -  a big hit with the family.  Served it with rice as pictured.  I think I will cut the chicken breasts in half then next time I make it.

i didn't have cream of cheddar cheese soup so i used 1 cream of chicken and 1 cream of mushroom with about 2 cups of shredded cheese mixed in with the soups and milk and served it over rice. I also only used 4 chicken breasts and cut them up into about palm sized chunks. Everyone in my family loved it.

While not gourmet, this dish is easy and tasty. I shredded the chicken, served it over rice, and added green beans as a side.

I made this tonight for supper and loved it. I used one can of Cheddar and one Cream of Mushroom. I also added some grated cheddar cheese and some onion flakes to add some zip. I served it over fettucine noodles for something different. I also cut the chicken breasts into chunks. I will definitely be making this one again. Very easy and delicious.

It was going to be a very busy day and I didn't want to worry about cooking dinner so I picked this recipe. Didn't have cream of Cheddar cheese soup but I did have a can of Fiesto Nacho Cheese. Don't care for cream of chicken so I also used a can of cream of celery with the  1/2 cup milk. It turned out a little too runny I think but was overall very good! I would cut down on the milk next time by at least half. My husband said it was delicious and I do have to agree.

Um.. I am not sure how any one else ate this... I made it for dinner because it was quick to throw together in the morning.. but it wasnt good, no one would eat it.  But the kids liked that it turned out so poorly, they got to have pizza that night.  To salty, just not so good.. and to bad, I like easy recipies.  oh well

Okay, so I didn't exactly make this recipe as written! I looked at the ingredients and decided it needed more. So I used 4 chicken breasts and seasted them with salt, pepper, and garlic salt. Then I added some sliced onion and portobello mushrooms and let it cook. Later, I added 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup, a can of cream of chicken that I mixed with about 3/4 cup of milk. I let it all cook on high all day. Before serving, I added about 2 cups of the Kraft Three Cheese shredded cheese witht he Philly Cream cheese in it....the family loved it! The highschooler in the house even took it to school for lunch the next day! It was awesome!

I'd rate this easy recipe a 4 plus but I made a few changes of necessity. I used a can of cream of chicken soup and a can of jalapeno cheese sauce because cheese soup isn't available locally.  Half an hour before serving I thought the sauce looked a little "soupy" so I added a couple dollops of sour cream. It turned out wonderfully moist and was great over rice but would be just as good over egg noodles.

My family loved this Chicken. It is nice to have these crock pot meals and know it is going to be easy to finish your meal when you get home from a long day at work. I did not make the dump and go dumplings we just made rice as a side dish and steamed broccoli! Will definitely make again.

Great flavor!  I didn't have cheddar cheese soup so I "dumped" 4 oz med cheddar cheese into the crock.  Also seasoned with 2 tbsp chopped onions, 1 tbsp parsley, and sprinkled each chicken breast with chili powder, then topped with cream of chicken soup.  Served over mashed potatoes.

I was not overly impressed with this.  The chicken did turn out tender and moist, but it just did not have a lot of flavor.  Will keep experimenting though.

Made it for my family tonight and they all loved it!!! I used 6 chicken breasts, 2 cans of cheddar soup and one can of cream of chicken soup along with the milk and seasoning the chicken. I put it in the slow cooker on low for 7+ hours and the chicken was so tender that it was falling apart. So good!

Simple, easy and very good. I cooked on low for 8 hours and shredded the chicken right in the slow cooker and served over white rice with glazed carrots. I only used three chicken breasts and it was just enough sauce. I will definitely double the sauce next time. Thanks for sharing!

Nothing earth shattering, but very yummy and easy.  I used one can of the condensed cheese soup and one can of cream of chicken, plus added some onion powder.  I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces before putting it in the crock pot and cooked it on low for ~5 hours then served it over rice.  I will definitely be making this again.

If the recipe is followed exactly it's just kinda boring but this is a great base recipe for anyone. Tons of things you can add to make it your own and have it taste good, a bit of a cream/milk base is needed in this recipe though....even if it's just 1/2 cup!

This was simply very delicious. I only had one can of cream of cheddar, so I used that and a can of cream of chicken. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. My boyfriend devoured it and ate the rest the next day (which he does not normally like to eat leftovers) so that tell me that its great! I loved it as well....yum!

Total meh on this one; was really bland and blah. The Easy Cheesy Chicken recipe is much better. Will not likely make this one again.

This recipe was good, but a little too bland to receive five stars.  As we were eating our dinner, my husband and I agreed that chile con queso dip would be a great substitute for one of the cans of soup.  I served this dish with egg noodles and thought that they went well together.

I made this following the recipe to a T the other day and it was a huge success...Hubby thought it was delicious and just cheesy enough!!  He even took the leftovers to work the next day for lunch, and said it was even better reheated!!

I used one can regular cheese soup and one can fiesta nacho cheese soup, which added just the right amount of kick!  I think it would have been much too bland without the fiesta nacho soup. I also seasoned the chicken with "Butt Rub" (Google it- this is GREAT stuff!)

I have used this recipe before and my husband and two children all liked it (which rarely happens). The last time I made it, I did change this recipe by using one can of cream of chicken soup and two cans of broccoli cheddar soup. The broccoli cheddar soup made it much better. My husband and kids LOVE it now! So easy!

This is a great, easy to make recipe that myself and friends enjoyed.  I did add a few ingredients:  I used 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom, and 1 can of cheddar cheese.  I also added frozen vegetables and rice 1/2 hour before    removing heat  and put the setting on low for the last hour.  Great recipe will definitely make again!

Very yummy! Since I did not have a can of cheddar cheese soup, I used one can of cream of chicken and added some Velveeta chunks.  I added rice to the crock before hand to make it a one dish recipe.  Don't think I'll do that again since it came out a little too thick.  But still delish!

A favourite dish here, served on rice. I use one can cheese soup, one can celery. I find for 2 chicken breasts, it only takes 5 hours on high. Very salty, so not a nutritious choice.

Really easy and tasty recipe.  I use the frozen chicken breasts that you buy at the wholesale clubs, and just put them in the slow cooker while still frozen.  I add a little extra garlic and some  red pepper flakes and it's delicious over white rice.

Love this recipe, so easy to make and change up if wanted to. I followed the recipe, but instead of salt, pepper and garlic powder; I used McCormick Montreal Chicken Grill seasoning, gave the dish a good flavor.

I've been making this for years and it's always a hit. I do make one small change, however. I substitue white wine for the milk. I think it gives the dish a better flavor. I always serve this over cooked egg noodles.

Rarely do I try a recipe where the "Most Helpful" comment by a reviewer is negative, however, I needed a "dump and go" meal for today as I was trying to give my kitchen a fresh coat of paint.  I have never cooked with the cheddar cheese soups before.  I used only 3 large chicken breasts.  The sauce was a good consistency to top extra-wide noodles, but like other reviewers, I found that it created a bad aroma while cooking, and was not only bland but what taste it did have, didn't agree with any of us.  If you like canned and instant foods like Kraft mac & cheese, etc., you might like this.  It tasted like an "instant" meal.  Will not make this (or buy canned cheese) again!  Sorry Chris.

My husband and I loved it. My husband is a hard man to please. I added 2 times the garlic and dumped in frozen chopped green peppers.  It was very flavorful and the house smelled great. Cheese sauce turned out good. Rice as a side dish. It's a keeper.

I made the recipe precisely as described, but the sauce was this greasy, totally not creamy mess. I poured the sauce off into a saucepan and added flour to thicken and then a few handfuls of pepper jack cheese, and then it tasted pretty good. Still, straight out of the box, this recipe isn't very good.

This was tasty but dry. I seasoned the chicken with chili-lime seasoning and browned it lightly before placing in the slow cooker. I cooked on high for 4.5 hours, but it was overdone. I will make it again, but cook on low.

I made this today for dinner. Instead of using cream of Cheddar cheese soup I used 3 cans of cream of chicken soup and added one tub of kraft philadelphia cooking creme southwest blend along with 3/4 can of milk.  I also added 1 lb of baby carrots and 1 can of green beans to the crock before cooking. I served it with brown rice with mushrooms. We loved it. I will definitely be making this again.

I have been making something similar to this for years.  Instead of 2 cans of Cheddar Cheese Soup and only use 1 can and add 1 can of Cream of Chicken soup.  It was always an easy dish when the children were young, but I still make it often because it is one of my husband's favorite meals.  The soups make a wonderful gravy for mashed potatoes.

i tweaked it some...i only used 3 chicken breasts which i cut in half, 1 can cheddar broccoli condensed soup and one can of cream of mushroom...i laid the chicken in the bottom and seasoned with red pepper flakes, light salt and pepper. i topped that with the 2 cans of soup and 1/2 cup of milk and cooked for 8 hours on low. for the last hour i laid frozen asparagus on top and let it steam with the meat,  i then served the chicken over brown rice....very good meal, got the spicy i love and hubby is very happy with the meal

I love this recipe. It really is the easiest dinner that I've ever made, and it tastes so good! I serve it over rice with a side of steamed california style vegetables.

I did not like it. My daughter loved it. I read the other reviews and liked the changes. Will try the other ways.

I also add cream of chicken soup and cream of mushroom soup to this mix.  It tastes great and makes the sauce a little thicker.  We like to serve this with a bag of mixed vegetables and use the sauce as "gravy" for the veggies.

This was just good.  Nothing earth shattering and I was expecting cheesy and it really had more of a chicken flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I think I will try this again but with some cheese wiz or some velveeta to get more cheese flavor.

This was a simple and satisfying meal. The only things i did differently was season my chicken before placing into crock pot. i used only one can of cheese soup and one can of cream of chicken. There was plenty of liquid mixture to cover all of the pieces of chicken breasts.

Every year, the day after Thanksgiving, my friend and I headed for Dale Hollow resevoir in TN to fish for a few days.  He used to put this in the slow cooker and let it go all day while we fished in his big Ranger boat with a 150hp Evinrude.  We would catch brown bass all day and arrive back to the cabin and the wonderful aroma of this dish, which was served over white rice.  Sadly we don't go any longer.  But good memories remain.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe!  Make sure you have extra cheddar soup on hand...I felt the need to add an extra can to my slow cooker.  I let mine cook long enough for the chicken to shred.  I serve it over pasta, like rigatoni or shells.  Also, before serving, I steamed broccoli and mixed it in with the chicken, cheese sause, and pasta.

This would have been a 3 star if it weren't so darn EASY! I put the breasts in frozen, sprinkled some garlic powder and celery salt on them, dumped in the two cans of cheesy soup and a splash of milk (didn't read about mixing that witht the soup....) and that was it. Served over rice. Hubby LOVED it, I thought it was pretty good.

4 stars for easy, 2.5 stars for originality. Probably a hit with kids, and chicken was moist. Served with a side of seasoned rice (as the picture suggests). I would recommend this dish to someone who wants a quick dinner, but not to someone who is looking to impress the in-laws.

Great recipe.  Even my most picky child said that we  would have to have it again!!  Came out a little bland...I think maybe I did not add enough salt and pepper!

I used one can of cheddar soup and one can of cream of chicken (it's what I had.) I also added italian seasoning, I think it would have been pretty bland without it. Good served over rice. May also be good with some carrots or other veggies in it.

This was very easy and pretty good. My suggestion is not to add any salt until you taste it. I don't think it needs any more than the soup has already.

Giving this 5 stars as a good base recipe.  Like other reviewers I changed the soup mix and seasonings.  Fixed it today for lunch in the slow cooker and cooked it for 5 hours on high.  Chicken came out falling apart.  The soup mix was good, but I will add more spice next time.  Served it over rice and broccoli and the meal was good with a side salad.

Followed suggestions of other reviewers.  Used two cans of fiesta cheese soup, one can of crm of cx, and 1/2 c. milk.  Used 4-5 cloves of fresh garlic, and lots of italian seasoning.  Cut up red/yellow pprs and fresh tomato and threw those on top when there was abt 10 minutes left.  Served it with egg noodles.  My husband also added garlic salt to his serving.  Would make this again.

I tried this recipe last night (I'm new to slow cooker cooking)... it wasn't horrible, but it did come out a bit bland and somewhat pasty.  If I try this recipe again, I will be sure to try some of the modifications others have suggested!

This was very good. So easy to make, I added some onion and garlic.  I also had to add a can of chicken broth, my crockpot will burn without any liquids in it.  I cooked it on low heat all day and the chicken was so moist and tender.  I served it over rice.  It was gobbled up.

The house smelled good while this dish was cooking, but it turned out to be very bland. I did not like the taste of it at all. The whole time I was eating it I kept wondering what I could have added to make it taste better. My husband said it was just ok. Probably will not make it again!

I think different slow cookers cook differently.  After 3 hours on high, I could smell that it was burning. I opened the lid and the cheese/milk was almost gone, so I added a can of chicken broth.  Still very cheesy flavor and I used 1 can of cheddar and 1 can of mushroom soup.  Served over wide noodles, very good, will make again

I took the advice to use 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of chicken nad 1 can cream of cheddar. It was good, nothing fantastic, just good. It needs a lot more seasoning and flavor in general.

This was super easy and quick to make. I added a can of Cream of Chicken soup to the ingredients and it turned out wonderfully! The chicken was so tender that it fell apart in the pan. I would add more garlic though, I felt that it didn't have enough taste to it. Also I was able to use 6 pieces of chicken breast. There was alot of soup left over. We poured it over mashed potatoes and made them Cheddar!

I varied this as others suggested, added corn starch at the end.  My kids thought it was okay, I thought it was terrible.  Very fake and processed.  I'll never make it again.

I agree that this is a fairly plain recipe by itself, but the chicken comes out very juicy and tender, and there is tons of room for improvising.  After reading reviews, I knew I needed to tweak it somewhere.  So, I added some salsa to the mix, and then added some sour cream to thicken the sauce up at the very end.  It came out great.  Not too salty, or cheesy.  Just the right amount of everything.  I noticed my husband making nodding gestures throughout the meal.  I'll definately make this again.

I took this recipe and changed it up a little bit. I added sauted onions and I left the chicken in overnight on low.  The next morning I took the chicken out and shredded it and mixed it back in with the sauce.  I took 16 mini pie crusts and prebaked them.  I put the mixture in the baked pie crusts, covered and refridgerated until that evening. When I got home I baked at 350 for another 15 minutes.  These were great and a family of 6 ate all 16 chicken pies.  I will definitely make this again.

Pretty good for the amount of effort needed in this recipe :)
I made no changes except cooking it on low for 8 hours and the sauce was perfect with just enough flavour. A nice easy recipe I will make again.

I'm always looking for easy recipes that might appeal to my two very picky children. I saw this and thought I would give it a shot, despite my intuition and some of the reviews that backed it up. Chicken does not take on flavor in this situation--no matter what. It was basically flavorless chicken in condensed soup. Pleh. I so wanted to like this. 
This may be a starter recipe for something awesome, but as is it's a dud. Ditch the cans. They really ruin things.

update:  leftovers were WAY TOO SALTY.  If I try again I will use low sodium soups or just make my own cheesy sauce without the cans of sauce. IfDoctored this quite a bit. Used 12 chicken thighs sautéed with olive oil in browned minced garlic. Then seasoned thighs with salt pepper, garlic powder and freeze dried poultry seasonings and sautéed chicken. Put chicken in crockpot. Combine one can cream of chicken, one can cheddar cheese soup and one can of golden mushroom with 1/4  Or so oh milk and one small packet of chicken stock. Combined all together and poured over chicken. Topped with 1/3 cup shredded sharp cheddar sauce. Cooked one hour on high and three hours on low in the crockpot.  Served with rice with broccoli and salad with blue cheese bacon salad .

Great recipe.  I made a few changes based on the reviews.  I used 4 frozen chicken breasts and I used 1 can of cream of cheese soup (I used the Campbells fiesta cheese), 1 cream of chicken soup (low sodium) and 1 Campbell's Poblano and Queso soup, 3/4 cup of milk, 1 small can of chopped green chilies and 1 tsp minced garlic.  I had it on high for 4.5 hours and it was done and the chicken was literally shreddable!  I then added 1 bag of frozen broccoli and let that all cook for another 30 minutes on high.  I served over white rice (I added a Knorr chicken Stock Pot to the water) and it was delicious!!

Yum. I made this for Sunday dinner on a cold winter day. I used one can cream of cheddar and one can cream of chicken with mushroom. It was a hit. So easy to throw together, and the chicken was so tender. I will be saving this recipe and may try adding vegetables next time as some others suggested.

The chicken was very moist.  Fell apart as I was taking it out of the crock pot.  Will definitely add more seasoning the next time I make it (I will make it again).  I used one can cheddar cheese soup and one can cream of mushroom - would add one more can of cheddar next time.  Cooked it for about 5.5 hrs on low and that was fine.  Think my slow cooker is a little high though. Served over rice with green beans.  Good idea to use leftovers for enchiladas!  Thanks!

This was good, easy and nutritious.  
I used the Healthy Request soup, lowfat milk and added some steamed broccoli to it in the slow cooker the last hour of cooking.  Complete meal, served with rice and a salad.

This is one of the BEST chicken recipes I have found here.  Its  new favorite, even my picky 8 yr old gobbled it up.  I followed some of the other reviews and added 1 can of cream of chicken soup to the cheddar cheese soup.  I also put a whole 3lb bag of frozen chicken breasts into the croc pot, seasoned with montreal steak seasoning, added the soup mix and set it on low for 8+hours.  It was perfect!

This was a really good recipe, athough I did change it a bit. I peeled and sliced four small potatoes, used four breasts instead of six, and I mixed 1 can of cheese soup with 1 can of cream of chicken. I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, parsley, and italian seasoning. It was done after about 3.5 hours on HIGH. So yummy, will make over and over.

This was a winner with my 4 and 6 yr old and I loved how quickly I was able to prepare it.  If I were rating it just based on myself I might have gone 4 1/2 stars because it is pretty basic in taste.   However, the cheese sauce was very tasty (on slightly thinner side) so I'm thinkinhg I will plan the sides more carefully next time so that I can do something more exciting with that sauce. ...maybe steamed cauliflower or broccoli.

Pretty good. Instead of garlic powder I used Tastefully Simple Onion Onion & Garlic Garlic. Would try other "cream of" soups next time.

I added leftover frozen vegtibles to this dish; it turned out okay, ended up shredding the chicken and adding some cooked white rice to the slow cooker. My family enjoyed it, but it was not what we expected. It required a lot of salt and pepper to achieve the right flavor. I Will probably  not make this again.

This was a very easy recipe. Definitely good for a busy day. I used 4 chicken breasts, 1 can cream of cheddar and 1 can of cream of mushroom. I also added a little onion powder. Cooked on high for about 4 hours and it was done. So tender i was shredding it with a rubber spatula! Served with mashed potatoes and a salad :)

Boring!  I followed the recipe exactly as it is stated and I also added to 2 bags of frozen veggies.  It was a decent hot meal, but that's it.  I lacked flavor and I don't want my leftovers.

This was just ok. I did add minced garlic and salt and pepper, but it was still pretty boring. Not horrible, just won't be jumping the gun to make this again. I guess it's worth it if you have to whip up something fast and easy.

At first, I made this exactly as it says.. it tasted so bland! So I added one packet of dry italian dressing mix, 2 fresh sliced jalepeno's, one can of diced tomatoes and half a block of cream cheese. It was great after I added the additions and served over rice with a hint of lime juice. Will definitely make again! Also, I only cooked for 4 hours total and it was plenty of time!

I used one can of cheddar cheese and one of broccoli cheese because that's what I had, and it turned out good so I would definitely do it that way again. I also added a dash of cayenne pepper to give it just a hint of a kick. Served over brown rice with Broccoli with Garlic Butter and Cashews (also from this site) for a delish dinner.

I made this last night, and it really is as easy at it seems. I changed it to fit what we had on hand, 2 frozen chicken breasts, 1 can of broccoli cheese soup, 1 can cream of broccoli, cream of chicken and 1/2 cup milk. I put in generous amounts of onion and garlic powder, black pepper, italian seasonings, and cayenne pepper (be careful, I added too much and it came out really spicy). I also added some sharp cheddar cheese (be careful, it did make it kind of salty) and broccoli. It came out good, and it was so easy I'd definitely make again. I was looking for a meal that would make the chicken go a lot farther and it did. I just started up the crock pot again to warm it up and threw in 1 more can cream of broccoli (to bring down the heat of the cayenne) and put some corn in too.

This is great. I've made it exact and with different variations. I have made it with one can cheddar cheese soup and one can cream of chicken and extra cheese and it turns out wonderful. Serve over rice or noodles and its great. Everyone loves it!

I changed this recipe a little to make cheesy chicken and dumplins and it turned out great.I used 1 can cheddar cheese soup and 2 cans cream of chicken. I only put 3 chicken breast in the crockpot.I added the dumplings at the very end so they wouldn't over cook.The chicken was so tender it just fell apart.

yummy!  i used a can of cheddar cheese soup, a nacho fiesta cheddar cheese soup, AND a cream of chicken soup.  i added salt, pepper, garlic powder and a little seasonging salt to the mixture of soup and milk.  the chicken was so tender and the sauce had a delicious flavor.  served it over brown rice and the left overs were gone within 2 days.

Quick, easy and tasty.  I've made this several times, you cannot beat how easy it is to throw this together in the morning on your way out the door to work.  I have tweaked it a bit, and usually end up using one can of cheddar cheese, and one can of cream of broccoli or cream of chicken.  We serve it over brown rice with steamed veggies.  Delicious!

This was pretty good - I must have overcooked it  because the chicken came out basically shredded so it was like chicken queso but it was good.  I added hot sauce and some other spices and it was good.

Very nice quick non-gourmet dish to set and forget during a long work day. A word of note - the soups are natively very salty and it shows in the dish. I recommend using at least one can of lower-salt soup to remedy that problem. Also - sprinkle some of your favorite chicken seasoning on the chicken before you pour the soup in; it helps immensely with flavor.

I added chopped onion, garlic and 1/4 cup sour cream to the soup mixture. Cooked on low for 7 hours. Shredded the chicken (it was incredibly tender and falling apart). Added bag of frozen veggies and a can of mushrooms. Cooked on high for 30 mins. Sprinkled shredded cheddar over top of mixture and let melt before serving over white rice. Was still a bit bland, my husband commented that it was missing something, but he took seconds. Would make again when short on time.

Awesome :) I made this my first recipe I tried in the slow cooker ever....I just got it for Christmas this year and I love it!  This recipe is so good - I used thin sliced chicken so it cooked quicker -I served it with white rice and green beans. Delicious :)

Seemed really bland, to be honest I would have rather have used my expensive organic chicken breast for something else.  Needs something to kick it up a few notches.  Way too bland for my family's taste.

I am going to give this 5 stars because all of my children liked this recipe. (my husband also enjoyed) I put this over white rice. The chicken fell apart beautifully. My teenager was pleased to know that he could have the left overs all to himself for lunch tomorrow.

When it comes to easy and tasty, this is great! The chicken shredded apart it was so tender. My boyfriend LOVED it. I served it over small red potatoes I had sliced thinly and baked until tender. It's definitely a stick to your ribs winter food!

My kids loved this.  Served it with jasmin rice.  We'll be making this again.  Might try and sneak some veggies in it next time.

Super yummy.  Comes out with a really thin gravy.  I used chicken thighs and I added cooked white rice at the end to make a great chicken and rice.  Everyone ate it all up!

This was a huge hit with my teenage boys and husband.  I used chicken tenders, easier for cutting.  I poured 1/2 can of chicken broth on the bottom of the pot ( I used a liner).  After adding the chicken I dumped 1 can of cheddar soup and 1 can of cream of chicken.  It cooked on low for about 3 hours.  Great flavor.  I used to left over chicken broth to cook the white rice.  I will definately make this again!

So easy and good! I halved the recipe because there were only two of us. The chicken recipe as written is 5 stars for us! However, I added a bag of frozen veggies and a box of cooked pasta in and that was too much- I used too much pasta so you couldn't really taste the cheese anymore. My mistake. Anyway, I will make again and next time either make the full amount or use less pasta.

I loved it! I did add my own twist though.. I put chicken on bottom, covered it with Poultry seasoning, and I do mean COVERED it.. then put Cream of brocolli cheese soup (1 can), cream of mushroom/cream of chicken.. Added Sour cream.. about 2 table spoons ( ALL ORGANIC).. s/p .. and then let it stew for 6 hours, slowly letting the chicken shred apart. I put it over Brown rice and my fam LOVED IT!!! my 4 year old loved it!! Will make again!! Oh yeah.. a Cup of milk too

I served this over mashed potatoes and along with peas...Very good and Super easy dish. Perfect for busy days. I did throw in a little extra pepper and minced garlic, but other than that stuck pretty close to the recipe. My husband loved it and we had the left-overs the next afternoon!

This definitely lived up to its title "Dump and Go"! I think it took me all of two minutes to get the crock pot ready in the morning, which was awesome. Of course the chicken was wonderfully tender, and we liked the flavor of the sauce AFTER we added cracked pepper and more garlic powder. I served this over rice. We'll be making this again!

This meal was extremely easy to put together.  We had most of the ingredients on hand.  However, after cooking it as instructed and tasting it, we found that eliminating the cheese sauce and adding the following ingredients to the chicken in the crock pot prevented it from going to waste entirely:  1 1/2 cups white wine, 1 cup of BBQ sauce, and four medium sliced potatoes (soften in the microwave first for quicker time.)  Cook for another hour and enjoy.

This was good. I will probably make this again because it was so easy and there were just a few ingredients needed, but it was not outstanding. My mom really liked it though. I did not have any milk on hand so I added about 6 oz. of cream cheese and fresh chopped garlic. I served this along with baked potatoes and steamed broccoli and used the leftover cheese sauce on the broccoli.  I used about 5 chicken breasts and there was a lot of leftover cheese sauce, so next time I may only use one can with milk or cream cheese and a little chicken stock.

This is SUPER easy!! I only used 4 chicken breasts and cooked it on high for 4 hours and then on low for 2 hours. Turned out very moist and delicious. Will be having this regularly. Delish served over hot rice.

This was really easy to make and tasted great! I only used 5 chicken breasts though, but it was more than enough for 4 people. I also added some different seasonings to it. I seasoned the chicken first with garlic powder, Tony's(Tony Chachere's), and some Renzios Greek Seasoning(mixture of herbs, etc). I also cut out the fat on the chicken.  Shredded the chicken right before serving and mixed it up in the slow cooker then served on top of rice, with veggies on the side. We all loved it! I will definitely be making this again!! :) I've also made it again and added a can of green beans(drained) to it 20 minutes before serving and stirred it up. Yum! It's always a hit!

This recipe was just o.k.  No rave reviews.  Hubby said not on the top of his list.  I did use one can of the Fiesta Cheese soup and one of the Cheddar Cheese soup.  I think that made a difference in taste.  Otherwise it would have been REALLY bland.  It was just still missing something. Wasn't crazy about the texture either.

I thought it was good. A little plain, but still good. I think maybe if you added a little milk to the cheese soup then it would thin it out and give it not such a strong cheese soup taste.  Or spruce it up somehow.

I wanted this easy recipe to be really good but it was just kinda blah.  Needs some flavor.  Maybe some blue cheese or something with some kick.

The flavor and ease of this recipe was good. I would recommend, shredding the chicken while in the sauce and putting on top of rice.

I made this with all of the ingredients listed in the posting.  The only change I made is I used only 4 chicken breasts, but kept the other amounts the same to have a saucier chicken.  This is no gourmet style meal, but if you're looking for a no-fuss, cheap, and fulfilling meal, this is it!  It takes all of 2 min to throw together chicken and soup mix.  I prepared some egg noodles and spooned the cheesy chicken over them.  Makes a great & simple meal.

So I followed what everyone else said and cooked with 2 cans of cheddar cheese and 1 can of cream of chicken.  Cooked on low for 6 hours and added frozen broccoli 1/2 before it was done. Served it over wide noodles.  It was yummy.  Kinda reminded me of tuna casserole.  Will make again.

I love this recipe. It is so easy.  I do it a bit different though. I do 1 can of cheese & broccoli soup & 2 cans of cream of chicken soup. And I do not season it with salt, the condensed soups make it plenty salty as it.  Just before it's done I throw in some steamed frozen broccoli.  I serve over rice.  Yummy and easy, my two favorite qualities in a recipe.  You can also switch up the cheese & broccoli soup for cream of mushroom and add fresh mushrooms in at the end instead of broccoli.

I made it as the recipe said, and put it over rice.  Was pretty good, and easy enough that I'm sure I'll make it again, but would be inclined to try a few substitutions as suggested by others, so that's why I gave it four stars.

I gave it four stars because it was easy and my son loved it.  I see where people say it is a little bland.  I made it and put over orzo pasta.  The pasta had a mac and cheese flavor while the chicken was tender. I may make it for my son again since he liked it so much.  I thought it was just o.k.

Well I liked the sauce...but the chicken wasn't anything overly exciting. I wouldn't make this again.

My kids and I did not like this recipe. It was too processed tasting (prob from the cheese soup) and the colors were awful. It simply did not look appetizing, and frankly, didn't find it much so either.

This was good. I had to make some changes but overall it is pretty good. Just a little salty for our taste. I won't add salt next time I make this. I used an 8oz. container of sour cream instead of milk and I also added a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup. Thanks for the recipe.

this was GREAT!  I was skeptical about the cheese soup...I did 1 can cheese soup and 1 can cream of chicken.  I think either way would be good.  The chicken was very tender and the "sauce" was excellent served on top of rice with steamed broccoli on the side.
I made chicken pot pie out of the leftovers.  OMG!  it was soooo good!

This recipe was awesome!  My whole family loved it!!  I used partially frozen chicken breasts since I have to leave so early in the morning - so I let my crock pot defrost and then cook the chicken and it was delicious!!

Another quick and easy recipe.  I used one cheese soup and the other cream of broccoli.  I served over rice and steamed broccoli.

I did as other reviewers suggested and used 1 can of cheddar cheese soup and 1 cream of chicken. Next time I'm just going to stick to the original recipe. It didn't have a cheesy taste in the end. Just stick to the original recipe on this one!

This was ok, it smelled good, but I really didn't think it had that much flavor. My kids ate a few bites,  and my husband ate half a bowl, and then said no thanks.  I just think it's missing something.

I thought it was pretty good. I cooked it on high for 5 hours and then on low for 1 hour. I put in 2 cans cream of cheese and 1 can cream of chicken. I put in a little bit of garlic Mrs. Dash and salt and pepper. The chicken was very tender. I poured it over brown rice. The only thing I didn't like was the crusty, nasty ring of burnt cheese left around the edge of the crock pot. Maybe I should have used more non-stick cooking oil or something...

This was quite good.  I was worried that the cheese soup would be overpowering, so I used 1 can of cheese and 1 can of cream of chicken.  I put the garlic powder and pepper directly on the chicken and then poured the soup mixture over it.  Very nice flavor.  I served it over spaghetti.

The flavor was very good, but the sauce was way too thin. The next time I made it without the milk and we enjoyed it more. Very good with rice or stuffing.

This was good and the chicken shredded with a wooden spoon. I did take the suggestions of others and used 2 cans of cream of chicken and 1 can of the cheddar soup. I added garlic powder and the milk and put frozen broccoli in during the last 30 minutes.

This recipe really does not need added milk. There is plenty of liquid as the chicken cooks. I cut boneless chicken breasts into peices and added boneless chicken thighs in pieces as well. I substituted minced fresh garlic for the garlic powder. We really enjoyed this over rice.

Awesome recipe! The only complaint I had was it was too soupy for me. I think I might try adding some flour about 10 to 20 minutes before serving so its thicker. But I definitely am making this one again!

By the end of the recommended cooking time, it had dried out a bit, otherwise it was good. I will add extra cheese soup to it next time.

When I was preparing this I didn't think I would like it. The look and smell of the Cheddar soup did not appeal to me, but I was surprised how well it turned out. I used the 2 cans of Cheddar soup and added 1 can cream of broccoli. At the end I threw in a lot of frozen broccoli. My family and I really enjoyed it.

My hubby and I thought this was really good.  I used one can Cheddar soup and one can cream of chicken, some extra garlic powder, and a little bit of crushed red pepper! Served over white rice. We only cooked 4 cx breasts in the soup mix so we had lots of extra cheesiness to mix into the rice. Yummy!

This recipe is wonderful and simple.  I cooked it the chicken on the crock pot's "Low" setting for about 10 hrs & it was GREAT. So tender it almost fell apart and tasted like roast chicken.  I made some new potatoes out of a can and covered them in some of the cheddar soup from the crock pot and a can of grean beans.  Mouth-watering.  Will definitely add to my recipe box.

I enjoyed this recipe thoroughly. I made two changes though. I used campbell's spicy nacho cheese soup, for more flavor and I sprinkled shredded cheddar on top.

This was not the best recipie. It was pretty bland. I made it a second time and I used 2 cups of grated velveta Cheese and 1 cup of milk. Instead of the canned soup. I melted it together and poured it over the chicken. And it was better

I made this on Saturday, when we were gone all day for soccer.  While it's very easy, and sounded good, it doesn't really have much flavor.  The chicken was very tender, but just didn't taste like much of anything at all.  Will probably not make this again.

Needs a bit more spice, and maybe half the soup....although I did use the healthy request version, so it may have been a little less thick than the traditional one.  next time I will double the garlic powder and add a couple tablespoons of Italian Seasoning, but the chicken was very tender

I took the advice from some other reviewers, and tweaked a bit. I seasoned with Ms Dash, as well as the salt and pepper. I also used half cream of chicken and half cheddar cheese soup, and added a bag of frozen veggies half an hour before it was done. It was great!

Only thing I might change: I may pull apart the chicken when I add the veggies, just to distribute the sauce better.

Been making this for quite a few years now, I usually make a larger batch since I have a giant rugby player for a son and because of that I add another can of soup.I suggest playing with it a bit, I've added a cream of asparagus soup, cream of broccoli, whatever floats your boat. Do season the chicken before you pour the soup mix over it or it'll be bland ( I use garlic powder and pepper) and even when using 3 cans of soup keep the milk the same or it'll be too soupy. The last one I did was using the fiesta nacho cheese soup, they all loved it.

I followed the directions except I didn't have condensed chedder soup so I had to make my own soup (first time making that too).  Mine did not turn out like the picture but my husband and I both liked it, very tender.  Served over pasta.  I used 2 lbs of chicken breast and turned slow cooker from high to warm after 5 hrs.

This very good and almost too easy. I read the reviews and shredding the chicken when it is done is a no brainer. It's better when you add veggies for crunch (I just heated up a steamer bag of frozen veggies and added it after the chicken was done). this would even be good in a wrap, or a taco. I used the canned cheddar soup from Aldi's,  it gave me a lower sodium option.

I made it with 6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and used 1 can cheddar soup and 1 can cream of chicken soup. Added 1 cup of milk and a tablespoon of poppy seeds for looks. About 20 minutes before serving time, add 2 cups of instant rice. It fluffs up beautifully and it is SOOO GOOD!!!!!

I have made this several times now and these are my changes: i use Campbell's Fiesta cheese soup for a spicy touch. Fresh chicken is better than frozen, but the frozen works if it is on sale. I serve with fresh plain rice from a rice cooker.  also love to make burritos with salsa!  wonderful dump and forget recipe!! thank you so much!!

Although I enjoyed how easy this recipe was to put together, it turned out SO incredibly bland. Will definitely bump up the spice game next time. Side note: I stirred in cooked broccoli at the end which went well with the rice I served it on!

I really like this dish; I do cream of cheddar cheese soup with cream of  chicken as well.  It is very good; the chicken is oh so tender!  I have made this dish now 4 times in the past few months.  It's a go to.  When you take your chicken out, you will probably have a lot leftover sauce even putting a little on the chicken, but the chicken is cooked so tenderly,  It's a great dish; highly recommend (and super easy too)!

We felt there wasn't much flavor to this dish.  I made exactly as written except upping the garlic powder to 2 tsp.  I cooked on high for 4 hours, the chicken was still a little dry.  Next time, I might try cooking on low for about 6 hours instead.  We thought some Italian spices might make it better.  Will update review  after trying!

Very good and super easy to make.  I didn't have 2 cans of Cheddar cheese soup so I used 1 can and 1 can cream of mushroom soup.  I made everything else the same, but omitted the salt since there is so much in the canned soups.  The family loved it.

Even my super-picky, never eats anything with sauce 5-year old loved this recipe--and she is the kind of kid who only wants to eat plain breaded chicken breasts cooked in the same way every night.  I made a couple of minor changes based on other reviews--I used both cans of cream of cheddar, but I also put in a can of cream of chicken.  I seasoned the chicken breasts with garlic and Italian seasoning, and I cooked on low for 7 hours.  The chicken shredded a bit when I was cutting it up but actually the pieces that were covered in sauce were the best--the ones that had the inside of the chicken exposed with no sauce were pretty bland, so you want to make sure you have plenty of sauce.  I served this with jasmine rice that I made with chicken broth instead of water.

So easy and really tasty! Followed recipe as published but cooked on high 3 hours and low about 2 hours. Chicken was moist, perfect, and easily shredded with fork. Served over rice. Will definitely make again.

This is easy enough that my husband will make it.  My kids like it as well.  We have done it with 2 cans of cheese soup, a can of cheese soup and a can of broccoli cheddar soup, and can of cheese soup and a can of cream of chicken.  Our favorite is the cream of chicken version.  We usually round it out with some rice, steamed broccoli, salad, some fruit, and biscuits.

Nothing special.  I used one can nacho cheddar and one regular cheese soup.  If I made again, I would not put the nacho in it, but I really don't care if I make this again.

I took the tip of the reviewer who added a jar of salsa con queso, and that made it perfect! I think  the soups by themselves would have been too bland for us. I have shared the recipe with this tweak a few times already.

I thought this was pretty good and easy. Follow as stated EXCEPT... cut the large chicken breasts into 3-4 pieces. Salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powdered the chicken, then browned it. Mixed soup and 1 soup can worth of milk, then added to chicken to crock pot. Was probably done at 4 hr mark but I cooked it for 5 hrs. During the last 30 min. I added frozen broccoli (love the frozen organic at costco). Served over white rice...yummy.

VERY easy... and wound up pleasing everyone in the house from my 4-year-old to my critical husband. Followed exactly, except with maybe a little more garlic. I took the chicken out after about 5 hours to cut into pieces and had to shred because it just fell apart! Put it back in the cheese sauce and mixed, then poured over rice. Pretty bland at first, so I added a handful of shredded cheddar and I have to say that was a MUST! It was just what it needed. Definitely going to make again, maybe with some variations others suggested like adding cream of chicken or cream of mushroom. Thanks for the easy delicious recipe!

I love this!  The only change I made was that I used crushed garlic instead of garlic powder.  I served it with a grain and veggie mix from TJs and it was a super easy and very yummy dinner.

We loved it.  The only thing I omitted  was the cheddar cheese soup, I added a jar of Ragu' cheese sauce,1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 can cream of chicken soup, a small can of drained mushrooms along with an extra tsp. garlic powder. This makes a lot of gravy so add some extra chicken if you enjoy leftovers. Serves well over steamed rice.

I cook it for 10 hours on low and save some cheese sauce. Around dinner time, I make rice, heat up the sauce, make some rice and serve the chicken on rice with the cheese poured over. YUM.

This as pretty darn good! I modified slightly after reading the reviews.  I used one can of cheddar cheese soup, one can of Nacho Cheese soup, one can cream of mushroom soup and also added fresh garlic and mushrooms.  About 20 minutes before we were ready to eat, I added 2 cups of shredded cheese to the crock pot.  Served over egg noodles and the kids begged me to make this again sometime!!

Tasted good, hubby even had leftovers the next day. Used Broccoli cheese soup instead, and added some fresh basil and onions. was a bit soupy though, will probably cut down on the milk next time. Chicken was very moist and we paired it with multi grain pasta, delic!

2 cans of soup was too much unless you add pasta to it.  I added half a box of bowtie pasta to the chicken.  The kids liked it.  Will make again.

My husband put this together yesterday for last night.  He followed the recipe, no variations, and it was not good.  There was no taste, at all.  It is a good base, but I think next time I make it, I will follow other people's ideas.

Super easy to make and delicious with brown rice! I followed the recipe as posted, except I did stir it a couple of times. So, that makes me wonder... why should I not lift the lid while cooking? Next time I will probably only cook it 5 hours as 6 hours seemed to make the chicken a little overcooked.

OK, next time cook chicken for 8 hrs, drain water, then cook with rest of the ingredients for an hour. Otherwise it will be really soupy.

This was tasty, quick, and easy! I used 6 chicken breast halves, 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 can of cheddar cheese soup, and some spices. I served it over egg noodles with veggies and garlic bread. My kids loved it too! The chicken was so moist and just fell apart when cutting into it - no knife needed! I was considering shredding the leftovers to make enchiladas but never did - it would have worked though!

The only modification I made was to substitute one of the cans of cheddar soup for cream of chicken as some suggested, and it turned out wonderfully.  I cooked on high for 5.5 hours and the chicken was tender and falling apart.  Served over brown rice with a side of broccoli.  Terrific!

FANTASTIC!!! The first time I tried this, I used 1 can Cheddar Cheese, and 2 cans Cream of Chicken soup, with the left over 1/2 a bottle of Cheese Whiz (because I had it). I also added Italian Seasoning, Onion powder and Onion Salt. to the chicken before adding the soup. Even my three year old ate a ton! Today I tried cooking some mixed veggies for the last half hour, like another review suggested. I DON"T RECOMMEND! It changed the flavor of the sauce.  Instead of chicken breast, I used 2lbs chicken thighs. Super easy and so good!

Me andmy fiance both loved this dish. I used 2 cans cream of cheddar and 1 can Campbells chunky baked potato soup. Followed the exact cooking directions and the chicken came out really moist. we had it over rice. We might add a little hot sauce next time to change it up.

Didn't care for the flavor.  I did vary the recipe, so it isn't exactly as it called for.  I used 2 cans cheddar soup and 1 can cheddar broccoli soup.  Added 1 bag frozen broccoli.  My family gave it mixed reviews.

simple but delicious. I love that it is so easy to add to. I have made as written, I have also added potatoes, and I have also in a pinch added cheddar cheese soup. Chicken is always tender great recipe!

I will make this again. This is a basic recipe, but you really should add some extra to make this really worthwhile. I added frozen broccoli and used one can of cheddar and two cans of cheesy broccoli soup. Spice it up with some salt, pepper and whatever else you like. I found it cooked all up within five hours.

Wow this came out great ... I did put salt pepper and garlic powder over chicken first and then put it in the slow cooker. Then i added frozen veggies the last 30 min and it came out so good.

I hated this recipe. It was too bland for my tastes. I listened to others advice and added a can of cream of chicken soup in addition to the cheddar soups. If I didn't add it, I still don't think I would have liked it. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because my boyfriend did like the recipe. He thought it tasted like chicken and dumplings.

Excellent recipe.  Instead of the slow cooker, I baked the chicken breast at 350 for 20 min on each side.  It was very tender and juicy.

This is great.  I need to watch my fat intake, so I used the fat free broccoli and cheese soup instead and it turned out great.  I also added frozen broccoli for the last 30-45 mins to add some veggies.  I served it over noodles and everyone gobbled it up.

This tastes like Campbell's.  The 3 stars are for the chicken.  Moist and tender, but I started with frozen chicken breast on high for 2 hrs, then low for 5 hrs.  It's a good place to start, but as written, it's chicken in undiluted Campbell's.

I thought this recipe was just okay. But I didn't follow it exactly. I made some alterations that were recommended by another reviewer. I used 1 can of the cheddar soup and 1 can of cream of chicken and spiced it up with curry, garlic and some seasoning salt. I also added some frozen veggies, which was a nice idea! But I thought the curry seasoning just didn't mesh well with the cheddar cheese soup. Those two flavors just don't go together. If you want to try curry in this dish I would recommend just using the cream of chicken and omit the cheese soup.

This was a very easy, tasty dinner. I used Chicken Tenderlions so only had to cook for 5 hours and it was hearty with pasta. I added a splash of chicken stock for extra flavor.

My family did not like this recipe. I made it with two cans cheddar cheese soup and one can cream of chicken, and like other reviewers, I seasoned the chicken before I added the soup and milk. It was very bland and tasted like cardboard....definately needed something. I will not make this again.

My boyfriend ate this up.  He is a very picky eater. I used 1 can of cheddar cheese soup, 1 can of cream of broccoli and 1 can of cream of chicken and put in 4 huge frozen chicken breasts straight in the crock pot.  The only thing I would do differently is I put in 1/2 cup of water like most said and next time I would put in milk.  It was not thick enough. BF would eat it again so it was a big hit!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I used one can of cheddar soup & one can of cream of chicken.  Plus I added some frozen mixed veggies.  I served it over a mixture of small pasta (using up leftovers).  Next time I think I will use cream of broccoli and serve with rice.  So many possibilities with this recipe.  I love it!

This was a pleasant surprise. I needed something that had very little prep time. This worked so well. It was not an expensive dish either and it was very tasty. I served it over rice with broccoli on the side. I will make this dish again.

This is one of my family's favorites.  This is a very versatile recipe.  You can add veggies at the end.  We like this served over bisquits or rice.  The chicken (if not overcooked) is very tender and delicious.

We thought this one a bit bland, and that was after substituting a can of Cheddar soup with 3/4 jar of Salsa Con Queso. Definitely has promise and we will try this again using a can of chiles or red pepper.

This isn't bad at all! My fiancee's eyes light up every time I say I'm making it for dinner. I also add some frozen veggies to the mix about a half an hour before it's ready... even better!

This didn't come out very well in the slow cooker so I switched it to a glass baking pan and put it in the oven. It came out good that way. Nothing special, though.

I agree with some other reviews!  This is a good basic recipe, but some things need to be added. I added fresh broccoli to my crock-pot and some curry (well, actually a lot of curry). Without the added spices it was a little bland for our taste. When done we spooned it over rice. For little thicker sauce I added some mayo/sour cream. This also makes it a little richer. If you added the richer ingredients, cut back on the cheese soup and substitute with cream of chicken, mushroom or broccoli (whichever you prefer).  Don't forget some salt and pepper. Great starter recipe with endless choices.

this was a great base recipe.  I would recommend adding some extra spices, maybe some green chilies or rotel to spice it up some.  The chicken was very tender and shredded and was great over noodles.  I made the recipe with 1 can cheddar soup and one can cream of chicken, it was a nice combination.  I'll make again with some of the additions I mentioned.

Very easy and very good.  I served it over rice and it went together nicely.  I over cooked it a bit but it was still good.

I slow cooked this yesterday.. I work 12 hour shifts, and it takes me 1 hour each way to get home.. Sooo, I slow cooked this on low, and hoped for the best.. I was afraid it would either be cooked into mush, or set my house on fire.. But alas, it was just fine! The chicken was super tender and I actually liked the cheese soup in it.. I didn't think I would like it, (I thought it would taste too processed) but it was nice, b/c it was already done when I got home. My hubby got home before me in time to make rice a roni as a side and left over broccoli bake.. Probably not the healthiest dinner I have ever made, but was one of the easiest! Thanks for the recipe!

I was surprised at how simple and truly delicious this meal was!  I just threw it in the crockpot before church and came home to a DELICIOUS dinner.  My husband and toddler loved it.  I served it with rice and some freshly sauteed spinich.  Will do again!!

I have made this recipe a few times now. The first time I followed it exactly and it was bland. I have since played around with it and it really is a great base recipe to go on. You can add veggies, shredded cheeses and extra spices to suit your preference. I have even served it over mexican or teriyaki rice to enhance the flavor. We love it and my kids are usually quite picky!

I thought this was very good and easy.  The chicken had a buttery flavor.  Served it with white rice but I think mashed potatoes would be better.  My 20year old son said that it tasted bland.

I wasn't too sure about it when it came time to eat it but it was pretty good. The chicken came out really tender. Served it with rice.

Simple & easy. Love it. The chicken was so tender! It just fell apart. I added a bay leave to the sauce in the slow cooker and served the chicken over a bed of wild rice with a side of green beans.

I followed this recipe as written and wasn't impressed. As others wrote there was no flavor. Both my kids balked at it and I had to reheat leftover for them. After adding some con queso to it my husband said it wasn't bad and said he was starving after a long work day and didn't care how it tasted as long as it was hot.I ate half of mine and then heated leftover also. I am not a picky person and usually like everything. This just wasn't worth the calories.

My husband who is not a chicken lover said this one was a keeper.  I added sauteed green and red bell pepper and served over rice.  Pretty and good.

Needs a little help.  Substituted one of the cans of cheddar soup for a jar of cheez wiz and upped the milk from 1/2 cup to a whole cup.  Came out tasty, boyfriend said next time to put some spice to it and it would be great shredded to put in tacos.

I couldn't rate this dish very high for a few reasons. One was the awful smell of it cooking. Usually crockpot dishes make your house smell good, but the cheese sauce made my house stink!! Another thing was the sauce was very thin, not thick at all. The chicken breasts were very moist (a good thing) and fell apart when I removed them. All in all, I wouldnt make this again.

This recipe was great.  It cooked perfectly and I have cooked it many times since I first found it.  I can freeze it and serve later over rice, potatoes, on a bun, anything.
