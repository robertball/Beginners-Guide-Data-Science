I tried this recipe for my boyfriend and I tonight. I used instant brown rice (we use it a lot, so were used to it) instead of white. I didnt measure anything lol. Couple squeezes of brown mustard,  worshy sauce, soy sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, and sriracha hot sauce. i marinaded it for about 1 hr 15 minutes. i cooked it with olive oil and in the liquid for about 1 1/2 minutes to a simmer and then drained it. i cut long green onions and slightly saut√©ed those with the beef. AWESOME. I love spicy and added extra sriracha hot sauce. my boyfriend did too and he loved it.
since i drained the marinade the rice was slightly dry so we added a touch of soy sauce. the beef was salty enough so i wouldnt recommend putting it on the beef, only the rice.

I suspect bok choy would be amazing in this. next time!

a nice version of beef and onion on rice. 
yum! im stuffed.

We loved this.  We made one and a half pounds of steak and double the marinade.  I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the marinade and it was perfect.  

I heated the oil in a large non-stick pan so the meat could be in a single layer.  I cooked on medium for about 3-4 minutes per side.  I guess it depends how thickly you slice the steak.  I sliced mine between 1/4 and 1/2".  

It was snowing here and it was so nice to make such a tasty recipe where I happened to have all the ingredients on-hand.  

We are going to make this again - soon!

Wow!  Talk about kicky!  This is extremely spicy.  I tasted the marinade before adding the meat and was almost knocked off my feet.  I took the advice of another reviewer and added some brown sugar.  After tasting the marinade I was worried the meat would be too spicy for my husband and I so I only marinated it for about 15 minutes.  It was really good!  I was pleasantly surprised.  Thanks for sharing.

I read the reviews before making this recipe so changed it to suit my family's tastes. I used only 1/4 cup of Worc., 2 Tbsp Honey Mustard and mixed in 1/4 c Brown Sugar so that the flavor would be in the marinade. If the marinade is too thick you can thin it a little with water or apple or citrus juice but avoid adding additional Worc. Sauce or you are back to having too much "kick" for some folks.  I sauteed onions, garlic, mushrooms and red pepper strips then added the steak strips to cook. It was fabulous over brown rice.

This recipe, with no changes, is a good start.  With some changes, it is by far a 5 star winner.  I used only 1/4 cup Worc. Sauce, 1/4 cup tamari soy, 2 tablespoons minced garlic, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper, 2 tablespoons Boetje's stone ground mustard, 1/2 cup olive oil. Blend all ingredients in blender till smooth.  Put steak, or chicken, strips in ziploc with marinade and pop in the fridge for as long as you like; i did mine for 3 hours and it was wonderful!!!!  Saute some yellow and red peppers along with 2 yellow or white onions and 1 tablespoon of minced garlic in a little olive oil until tender crisp.  remove veggies and saute strips for about 6 min. total. remove meat and add leftover marinade, boil for at least 5 min.  Serve everything over long grain white or brown rice.  Delicious!!!!

This recipe was boring and lacked the kick I was expecting.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Perhaps the steak strips should marinade for longer than 30 minutes?  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either and it left my friend and I longing for more flavor.  I probably will not be making this again.

Very good.  I thought that there was a little too much kick, so I just sprinkled some brown sugar on it while it was cooking.  It helped tone it down a little.

Great recipe! Since I didn't have an Worcestershire sauce, I used soy sauce instead. It ended up tasting greater than I expected.

This is really good!!  I did add brown sugar to the marinade. I will try it without the sugar -- I don't need the calories that sugar adds. :) I used dijon mustard because that's what I had. I marinated the meat for about 5 hours.  And I added some sliced carrots when I sauteed the onions and garlic.  I wanted to add a little color and I really liked the addition. Thanks for the easy recipe that I will be using often.

This was okay. The worch. sauce really overpowers any other potential taste. Per others, I did add some brown sugar, which did cool this off, and green bell pepper strips while frying for some color. However, I doubt I'd make this again. Thanks anyways.

I changed this a bit by using 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup Worstershire sauce.  Will make this a lot.

I made this recipe as written and we liked it ok.  What put it over the top and won a spot on our regular rotation was the addition of half a teaspoon of orange peel.

Spicy but incredibly good. Best use of worcestershire sauce I've tasted so far. This and a glass of wine turned my teeth a hideous dark grey until a good brushing... maybe not a good recipe for a date!

These were pretty good, even though I don't like Worchestershire sauce much. And they were quick.

This is one of my family's favorite recipes.  I change it just a bit to suit my family, but only slightly.  I do not marinate the meat, I throw the meat and marinade in the slow cooker.  They could be ready in 4 hours on high, but at 6 hours on high the steak is falling apart and no knife needed.  I also add 1-2 Tbs brown sugar to the marinade as other reviewers suggest.

The posted recipe should be called Bitey Steak. Whenever Worcestershire sauce is used as an ingredient, it is usually wise to add brown sugar in order to remove the bite. For Kicky Steak, try using Koops Arizona Heat mustard instead of yellow or Dijon, not only will you get the kick but savory spices as well.

Would not make this one again.  Husband wasn't a fan either.  It lacked a saltiness.  Maybe if I did 1/2 soy sauce and 1/2 worc. sauce it would have been tastier but it lacked kick either way.

Good, but HOT!  I will add less pepper the next time I prepare it.  Also could be used with a cheaper cut of beef if marinated over night.

This was pretty tasty, I didn't expect it to have as much KICK as it did! It was very good, but too spicy for my family- I would make it again though, just less pepper :)

Mmmm...Kicky Steak Strips and Garlic Mashed Potatoes!  I eat a lot of rice, and wanted something different.  I marinated the steak strips overnight and used Boetje's Stone Ground Mustard instead of yellow.  I also sauteed extra onions and added quartered mushrooms.  You can't beat a 2-ingredient marinade!

Good base start, I added red and green peppers. Then served with sweet plum sauce and soy sauce which I thought blended well with the peppery kick. I like the ease and flavor of the marinade. Thanks

This recipe helped our steak stay moist, which can be hard in CO :P but I just didn't care for the taste THAT much.  I will agree with other reviewers who felt that the Worcestershire overpowered any other flavor.  I tried it the way the recipe is written, I tried it w/more mustard added, I tried it w/brown sugar added, but I just didn't love it, but also didn't have anything else on hand to doctor this cut of meat (and IT was the only thing I had defrosted LOL).  I might try it with soy sauce instead of Worcestershire next time, but it'll be a while before we try this one again.

I broke the rules!!! I made the marinade as stated and seared my meat as stated - but then i seared some veggies in the skillet, and dumped the leftover marinade in the skillet and added a little water and cornstarch. Boiled the snot out of it and tossed the strips and veggies in the resulting sauce. Served over oven brown rice from this site because I can't make real rice w/o setting the stove on fire. It was a little tame for my taste so I added hot sauce but my 5 year old cleaned his plate - you have my eternal devotion!

I made this recipe exactly as written and I thought it was good but not great. First off, the worcestershire sauce is the main taste so if you don't love that to begin with you won't like the dish all that much. This is probably why some reviews found it to have too much kick. I love worcestershire sauce so no problem for me. My 4 kids(all under 5) didn't complain about the dish one bit even though I don't usually make spicy foods. I however, feel the recipe could use a boost. Next time I am going to add some thin strips of carrots and maybe some red peppers to make it more like a stir fry dish. Also, I think I may try adding some brown sugar as suggested by other people. With the above changes I have a feeling the dish will be more interesting.

I thought this was great. A lot of kick. I took other viewers suggestions and added some brown sugar. Also, I didn't use top sirloin, I just bought what was on sale, what's the sense of taking a good top sirloin steak and smuthering it in a marinade? At least that's my feeling on it. Wild rice was a delicous choice too.

Magnificent!  I made a few small changes - I used Dijon mustard because I had it on hand and I added a red and a green pepper with the onions and garlic.  I also marinaded the meat for a few hours.  It turned out great!  This is one of my new favorite meals.  Easy and delicious!

I wasn't too big of a fan.  I only used half the mustard and it was still too much.  I was expecting some sort of sauce to be with the meat to serve it over the rice but there wasn't any.  Could of just been my cooking but I won't make again.

Very disappointed. It was boring with no flavor at all. I let the steak marinate for at least 5 hours, doubled the garlic, added salt and still no flavor. Sure didn't get spicy at all! Won't be making this one again.

Wow...only had an hour to marinate and it was perfect!  The marinade ingredients, as per the top-rated reviewer, were spot-on! Used strip steak.

Followed the recipe and it came out perfect! I added brown sugar to the marinade.  Put a little to much because it came out sweeter than I would have liked, but still tasted great. Brown rice and peas for the sides! Great quick and easy weeknight recipe.

I had major issues with the marinade.  When reading the recipe, I thought this would be good but after I prepared the marinade and tasted it, it was too much for me.  I added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to make it more palatable for me and I still cooked the beef hoping it would still be allright but the flavor just wasn't right for me.  Since the steak was eaten I will give this recipe 3 stars but I am not preparing this again.

Great flavor - though I did do as others stated and added soy sauce - I doubled the sauce.  Also - I used part regular mustard and part chinese hot mustard, this added the Kick!  Served it with broccoli as others suggested.

I just made this dish tonight and it was great.  I used Dijon instead of yellow mustard (just because I didn't have any on hand) and it turned out wonderful!

tasty - as the others, I added some brown sugar - also, I had only about 1/2 enough Worstershire, so I made the other 1/2 from a combination of HP Bold & wine .. ended up quite tasty, but we found the meat was way overcooked (and I didn't even cook it the whole time recommended) - next time I will try stir-frying at very high temp for just a minute or so - maybe even in parts (stir-fry enough for the kids, then get pan really hot again and cook for parents...)

A lot better than I expected. I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar. Very tasty. My husband gave it five stars after the first bite. I also added about 4 or 5 garlic cloves. Very good and very easy to make. Definitely worth trying.

My familly liked this a lot, but you do have to be a fan of worcestershire since that's the dominant flavor.  I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar (doubling the recipe), and thought that toned down the mustard and worcestershire somewhat.  It's different, and I think that's what appealed to everyone.  I'll make it again for sure.

This was a very nice recipe. :) I used an entire onion instead of only half a cup though.  I would also recommend not discarding the leftover marinade as I found the rice was a bit dry and needed a sauce. I will add the marinade to the pan with the steak next time and cook it all together and then mix it all with the rice. Delicious meal.

Super yummy but I did change a few things.  First I used some brown sugar in the marinade.  Secondly I made another mixture of Worcester sauce, spicy brown mustard and brown sugar to cook in with steak and veggies on the stove top.  I added some carrots and also some paprika.  I then put it over steamed rice!

This recipe is good on it's own, but like other reviewers, I thought the marinade was missing something.  I added 1/4 cup of dark brown sugar and about 1/2 tablespoon of grated ginger. I loved it. Quick and easy family recipe.

I am eating this, right now.  It was bland.  I even used a mustard with mustard seeds, and apple cider in it, and, I added Lea and Perrins steak sauce!  After the first bite, I had to salt it, pepper it, and, put steak sauce on it.  It's "kickin'", but, in the wrong direction!  More garlic, garlic powder, season salt, more pepper...maybe that will help!

I REALLY LOVED THIS RECIPE! I MADE A FEW ADJUSTMENTS THOUGH AFTER READING THE OTHER REVIEWS... I USED HONEY MUSTARD INSTEAD OF YELLOW MUSTARD AS WELL AS A TBSP OR TWO OF BROWN SUGAR. IT STILL HAD A KICK BUT IT WAS MILD ENOUGH FOR MY FIVE YEAR OLD TO EAT!

Loved the sauce (which MUST be doubled)!  This was spicy without the pepper (which I forgot) but very tasty even on not-so-good quality beef.  Wish I had made more.  I did cook the onions and garlic first, removed them and deglazed the pan with white wine before adding the drained strips of beef.  After the beef cooked for a few minutes, I added the marinade and reduced the sauce a bit.

OUR FAMILYS NEWEST FAVORITE RECIPE!!! We have used steak, chicken, shrimp and tons of vegetables. Each time we do one a meat we also marinate a few veggies to go with. The veggies take about the same amount of time to cook as the meats.  I did as others have suggested and used 1 t onion powder, 1 t garlic powder & 1/4 C brown sugar instead of fresh garlic & onion. Have made this marinade with different meats/veggies at least 8 times in the last month!!

I let this marinate overnight and I didn't find it spicy. My meat had a vinegar/mustard taste that just didn't work for me. Sorry won't be trying this again.

I made this tonight, it was good.  Family liked it but I was really hoping for something "kicky".  But I like spicy.  Overall this was a good recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This is so good!  I added broccoli and served over white rice to make the chinese food beef and brocolli.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I believe it needs to be marinated longer.  Other reviewers said it was too spicy, but I didn't think it was spicy enough.  I tried the recipe exactly the first time and it lacked flavor.  I tried it a second time, but this time I marinated it all day while I was at work.  Much more flavorful and definitely a keeper for our family!

This was alright. I added broccoli and made it a healthier version of beef & broccoli. It needs something more to it though...I'll be playing with this recipe some more.

This recipe tastes a lot better than it looks. I did add 1 Tbsp brown sugar, garlic powder, and pepper to the marinade. The sauce was good over the rice and the steak tasted great!  I had it with green beans and French bread. YUM!  It is a keeper!

I LOVE this recipe. We like it better with chicken strips. Instead of disposing of the additional marinade, i throw it in the pan to cook with the onion mix. I also do not like chunks of onion so I substituted Tastefully Simple Vidalia Onion dressing for the onions. This is one of our favorite dinners to date! Thanks

Honestly, I didn't think this recipe was all that thrilling. It needs a little something else - not quite sure what yet. But its a decent start to a recipe that could be so much better. I would definitely recommend stir frying some fresh vegetables to mix in with the meat as well as a few more herbs.

This sounded better then it actually was. It was okay, but did not meet my expectations. We all liked it but would rather have a stir-fry dish instead. Thanks for posting, it was nice to try something new and different.

I did things a little diff. I used 1/2 cup soy sauce along with the 1/2 cup worce. sauce. Used spicy brown mustard instead of reg and added some red pepper flakes to give it a "spicy" kick. Let it marinate for 2 hours and grilled it. Served with white rice and sauteed onions and carrots.

Ok, My 13 yr old son and I went a li'l bit overboard with this.  We not only added 3T of brown sugar as another reviewer had said, but also 1T of horseraddish, a quarter of a small red onion, about 10 splashes of Emril's green pepper sauce,  some seasoned pepper, dried garlic, garlic salt and 1/2 a bunch of fresh parsley stems and all.  WOW! this is great. It is easy to make too.

I have made this several times now and it's always a hit. Great Addition... I cook some red and green bell peppers with the meat, and serve it all over rice which nicely absorbs the extra marinade so it doesn't go to waste!

This is a family favorite.  Taking the advice of others I put about a cup (in a double batch) of brown sugar in the marinade to balance the kick.  Also I cook up the beef with some of the marinade to give the meat a nice glaze.  It's wonderful served up with jasmine rice

I made this with sirloin steak and added some mushrooms and tomatoes. I served with leftover Alfredo noodles I wanted to use up. After reading the other reviews, I used 1/4 cup Worcestershire and 1/4 cup soy sauce and added about a tablespoon of brown sugar. Very tasty!

I find that having the meat slightly frozen makes it much easier to cut thin strips.  Also I used Dijon mustard instead of the yellow mustard.  Rather than white rice I served the meat over Rice Pilaf.  All in all, this was a very easy recipe to make.  My husband really liked the taste.

My husband loved this.  I added crushed garlic to the marinade, as well as black pepper.   I sauted onions, green peppers, and garlic first. Set aside in a bowl, then did the beef and threw the veggies back in at the end.   Served over rice, but hubby liked it better in a wrap the next day.

These are very flavorful and have quite a kick to them. They're perfect and the family loved them.

Easy, fast, and tasty. Before slicing the steak, wrap it in plastic wrap and place it  in the freezer for 20 minutes to make it firmer and easier to slice it thin, and cut it against the grain.

Added green and red pepper strips. Didn't use white pepper  ...( heard about the heat already). Went with black pepper.
My mother, who doesn't like anything.  Loved it.  I think it was the yellow mustard, diff. Than  usual.   Thank you!

I made quite a few changes. If you stick to the recipe there's not enough sauce to flavor the rice. I added some of the marinade and some red wine then diluted the strength of the sauce with water and simmered until the sauce reduced.

Will definitely make again!  We cooked it with the marinade, the steak was tender and the juice helped the rice from being too dry.  It was awesome for leftovers the next day

I did make a couple of minor additions.  I added a little garlic powder and come cayanne pepper to the marinade (we love it spicy!).  I didn‚Äôt have yellow mustard, so I used Dijon. I also added mushrooms to the onions and garlic mixture.  To the rice (brown long grain since it was what I had) I added a bit of garlic powder and a good dose (not measured) of Greek seasoning.  It was a absolutely the best beef recipe I have made, possibly in my life.  The package of meat I bought was 1 1/2 pounds so I doubled the marinade, and I dumped all of the meat and marinade into the pan to cook so I had lots of juice to put over on the rice with the meat and veggies.  I will make this again and again.  I can‚Äôt wait to eat the leftovers!

I made the kicky steak strips according to the recipe, except that I used brown rice.  My wife and I both enjoyed it.  I made a mixed green salad with sherry vinaigrette dressing to accompany it.  I plan to make it again.

I made this for the first time lastnight. It was very tangy which we liked. We didn‚Äôt think it was kicky though. I think next time I will use more meat and maybe a little bit of brown sugar to cut the tang down just a bit. It was delicious we really enjoyed it!

My family loved it!  I made two and a half pounds of meat, so I multiplied the recipe accordingly.  

I used half yellow mustard and half whole grain dijon. I added a tbsp and a half A1 and a half teaspoon black pepper to the marinade, but no pepper later. I let it marinade for several hours. 2 cups lo my brain white rice and broccoli. 

Next time I will slice the meat even thinner, but it was a definite win!

Great Simple Steak marinade thank you for the recipe will make again.. The only changes that I made was that I seasoned my meat with Paprika , black pepper and Garlic powder as I did not have any fresh garlic. I did also add a bit of scotch bonnet pepper sauce as we like things on the spicy side. I didn‚Äôt use the exact measurements for the sauce as I also did not have 1/2 a cup of Worcestershire sauce so I added mustard to taste. My son loved it and what steak I couldn‚Äôt finish he also ate.

I I was hesitant to make this because it has mustard in it but was very surprised can't even taste the mustard once it's cooked. It was very quick and easy to make and my husband and I both enjoyed it.

As I was mixing the worce  and mustard this totally became stroganoff  to me. I added a can of beef broth, teasp of thyme,  some salt and pepper 1/4 cup of corn starch and marinated for 1 hour. I then  took the  meat out and browned it. added the marinade and simmered for 1 hour.  I turned the heat off and added 4 TB cream cheese and 4 TB sour cream. Served with buttered egg noodles. Delish!

Wow this was so quick, easy and simple, and  flavorful I did use Dijon mustard instead of yellow, just because I was trying to use it up. Next time I think I will make a cup and a half of rice instead of just a cup, seemed like it would be a little more balanced that way. But this will definitely go into our regular meal rotation. No leftovers - we couldn't stop eating it. Thank you!

We love this dish. I would recommend doubling the recipe if like left-overs. I have mad this several times, but I do make some modifications to make it more "Kicky". First off, I substitute yellow mustard with Dijon. I also add red pepper flakes and also Crimini Mushrooms. Lastly, I marinade for a few hours and not just 30 minutes.  I do not discard the marinade and use it to cook with for a sauce to go over the rice. This recipe is super easy and yummy.

This meal was awesome. My whole family loved it, especially my son who just moved back from school a month ago and said it was the best meal he has had since he has been back home. Of course I had to brag a little to my wife who does most of the cooking. I made this recipe exactly as it's written the first time. It was pretty good but I thought it could be better. The only adjustments I made were to cut the amount of worcestershire sauce in half, add 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and also 8 oz. package of mushrooms sliced.  The second time was a charm. It was excellent.

This was fantastic but I did make adjustments like a few other reviewers mentioned - half soy sauce, half Worcestershire.  Also added 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Marinated for a few hours and charcoal grilled this.  It was perfection!!  Definitely a keeper.

I would have given this 5 stars if I hadn't changed the recipe.  I set out to make as written, but only had 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce and since going to the store was not on my agenda I added 1/4 cup of teriyaki sauce and a handful of brown sugar.  Sirloin strips were very tender, had a great flavor and we both loved it.

I loved this, although I didn't measure anything and I added soy sauce, used spicy brown mustard, and sriracha as well. I found it to be very versatile and you could make it your own by adding or subtracting any of the ingredients. I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent.  I knew I would love this because I love Worcestershire sauce.  I ended up marinating it for a day and a half.  I did not have garlic.  I did use Jalapeno mustard and also added a little ginger root.  I also used a whole onion cut in strips as well as some strips of red and orange bell peppers to add some vegetables as well as some color.  I will definitely be making this again.

I didn't have as much meat so I used 1/4 cup worchtershire sauce and 1 tbs of mustard and I added 1tbs of honey and some cornstarch. It turned out amazing. Next time I make it I'll add some steamed broccoli.

Maybe I just don't like the taste of Worcestershire sauce, but I won't be making this recipe again.  I followed other reviewers advice, and used 1/4C Worcestershire sauce, and 1/4 C soy sauce.  I also added crushed red chili pepper and Sriracha .  There was "something" about the flavor I didn't like.  Since I use all the other ingredients all the time, I'm blaming in on the Worcestershire sauce.

At first I thought the recipe called for too much black pepper but when served with the rice it did not bother me.    I think it makes a huge difference with the quality  of meat.  I used a USDA approved "top sirloin thick cut" and sliced it thinly.  Also, I made sure not to over cook the meat.   Delicious flavor!

I made it and it was a hit.
Next time I'll figure a way to make a light sauce based on the mustard/worcestershire sauce for the rice.

I know it's not fair to rate something you've modified, but my wife doesn't like super spicy food. So I only used half the Worch, and made up the rest in water. Then I added 1/2 C. dark brown sugar and 1/4 C. soy sauce. Finally I used Nancy's honey mustard in place of the yellow mustard. Un-real. This is a make again and a good base to modify to your tastes.

It was good the first time but not great. The second time I marinated it longer but added  garlic pepper sauce S&P to the marinade and it came out PERFECT! You may want to cook the steak a little less though.

Delicious! My family loved it.   Will definitely make again.  Having read the reviews, made a few adjustments.  Sliced the meat thin as suggested.  Added a quarter  cup of brown sugar, and also 1 Tbsp of balsamic vinegar to the marinade.  Marinated for about 1.5 hours.  Once the meat was cooked, removed it from the pan and added some of the remaining marinade to the pan.  Boiled it to make it safe. Made a wild rice blend, served the meat over the rice, put a few spoons of sauce over it.  Served with a roasted veggie medly of broccoli, little sweet bell peppers and multi colored carrots.  Everyone was happy!

I enjoyed this recipe. Simple and easy. I like everyone else added some brown sugar, which blended well. I used brown rice and would love to add some veggies  the second time around. But thanks for the recipe I enjoyed it:)

My family loved it. I also added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and a few teaspoons of Siracha.  I added some green peppers with the onions and garlic. Next time I will double the sauce. I cooked it for awhile longer to get my meat tender. Great over white rice. Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty yummy a written! A little spicy for my palate  so the second time I made it I added some brown sugar which helped cut the heat. Will definitely add to the meal rotation, so simple and good!

The only thing I did differently was use onion powder instead of actual onion because my boyfriend doesn't like onion and I added brown sugar since so many others recommend it. If you're not a yellow mustard fan use less cause it over powered it in my opinion. Other wise over all I'd say it was ok

loved this!!!  the steak was so tender.... I threw some red hot and soy sauce in while I was cooking the steak.. I didn't have any garlic so I used minced garlic. Put it over white rice that I had buttered. I drained the juices while I was cooking, I probably shouldn't have done that, but I did. lol.. def wanna make it again!

I added Soy sauce and omitted the onions! To reduce the fat and calories I used non stick cooking spray. This steak is also great if you just prefer tips instead of a whole piece I served this with a baked potato with light laughing cow garlic and herb cheese! Awesome meal!

This was a great recipe. For me I didn't need as much olive oil as this recipe asks and I also added green pepper. I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce so I used soy sauce.DELICIOUS.

I added some vegies to this recipe and used brown mustard.  The marinade is best with just the meat as I will be adding a lot more meat to the leftovers.  FYI, if you like the marinade, try the wooster with spicy mustard and use the strips of steak to make the best cheese steak sandwich with mushrooms and onions.  It is sloppy but yummy.

Nice recipe and very versatile. The second time I followed this recipe I breaded the steak after marinating them. It was very tasty and added a little crunch.

A little too sweet. Next time I will substitute in half worcestershire, half soy sauce. I added a few shakes of hot sauce for the much-needed kick.  I also recommend substituting the water for beef stock or broth. And adding in a vegetable (broccoli, green bean?)

Really liked this one. I used 1/4 of Worcestershire and 1/4 cup of soy sauce but that is what we like. Next time I think I will use sweet hot mustard instead of plain yellow.

I followed the recipe as instructed but with a little twist.  I added brown sugar to me and my husband taste.  It turned out just fine.  I also thicken the extra sauce to make a gravy.  We enjoyed the dish and he can't stop asking me to make it for dinner.

I added bok choy and sliced mushrooms and used 1/2 worcestershire and 1/2 Costa Rican worcestershire and this was wonderful. Next time I would cook the steak first, put it aside, cook vegetables and then put together.

Ok made this 2 ways and the family did not like the steak and onion version so this was a nce easy way to make it I took the advice of others after tasting it and did half soy and garlic garlic from tastefully simple with broccoli and mini corn and the twist was I used frozen beef strips by tyson now that was good the steak was tender and the sauce was yummy and it was fast I also served with long grain rice like another viewer said and she was right perfect side dish

This was really good.  I used more onion and added portobello mushrooms. My only problem was that I did not have enough for three people.  Will double the recipe next time.

These were not very "kicky," but had a good flavor.  I added some red pepper and basil to step it up a notch.  The added spice was needed to keep it from being too bland.  It was difficult to know what to serve as a side dish.  I ended up serving salad, but maybe next time some steamed veggies.

I used a mild dijon instead of yellow mustard, and linguine instead of rice, because I'm not a big fan of rice.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe fairly closely and am looking forward to making it again, but wondering about making a cream sauce to accompany?  I found it just a touch dry for my fancy.

This wasn't spicy at all which was confusing to me considering how many reviews stated how spicy it was. I accidentally overcooked the steak a little, but the marinade tasted really good. Will use again when I need a quick, easy recipe. Served with garlic mashed potatoes

This is an excellent dish. It has a very unique taste that is addicting. In fact, I'm cooking it again tonight. For those that prefer it baked, I let my meat sit in the whoreshire sauce and mustand in the refrig for 2 hours, then I baked with foil tightly over pan served with rice. The foil allowed the meat to retain it moisture and it was tender. My kids loved it...

Tried this and used the recipe but was disappointed.  I did marinate it for longer and used brown sugar as was suggested in other reviews.  Just didn't do it for us.

The mustard was a little overpowering. My wifes asked me if there were cloves in it, but there's not. I could have used a little more spice. I will definatly change the marinade. It was ok, not great.

I marinated the strips for longer than the recipe calls for, about an hour and a half. I used instant rice instead. I thought that the recipe was very bland and I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper once the dish was prepared due to the blandness.

This recipe was pretty good, but nothing extraordinary. I tried to add more veggies for me, the veg-head, but, in the end, it reminded me of fajita filling on top of white rice. If I make again, I will make sure I have tortillas on hand :)

Followed recipe. Hard part was cooking thinly cut steak strips "on each side".  Did it like stir-fry. Worstershire flavour was far from over-powering, (marinated 30 min in fridge). It was a good dish...

The steak turned out great...but there wasn't any gravy left over when you put it over the rice.  I ended up having to make a brown mushroom gravy to pour over it.

It was a little too hot for me, But I am not used to that much pepper. I put a little Soy sauce on afterward and I liked it better.My friend really enjoyed and love the smell in the kitchen from the garlic and onions.May fix again, but will change the marinate to half soy.I think adding more veggies would also be better, depending on side dishes.

This receipe was Excellent and so easy to prepare.  The flavor was terrific.  My husband absolutely loved it!  I added julienne green and red peppers for color and the unique flavor of the veggies further enhanced the overall meal.  I will make this receipe again and again.

I liked this recipe, but my husband made a different marinade for his steak strips.  He used chipotle marinade with soy sauce instead.  His had more kick, but I liked the recipe better.  We also will add some peppers and mushrooms to make it a more complete meal next time.

This has become my husband's new favorite dish. In his words, "This is better than the stuff you could buy in a fancy restaurant!"

I did change a few things. I added a lot of zucchini (because I had some I had to use up), and just stir-fried it in beforehand. Based on some of the comments on this recipe, I added some brown sugar to tame the spiciness - I'm not such a "spicy" cook. I also add more onion than the recipe calls for, and I've even put in other vegetables (mushrooms, green peppers, etc) so that this recipe changes each time I make it. I made it both when my in-laws came and when my parents came (their first time at our apartment), and it was a hit!

I gave this a 4 because my husband said it was pretty good but that is being generous, it really should be a 3.  The idea is good but the mustard flavor is overpowering in the meat.  Also, my meat was a little tough.  I don't think I will make this again.

This was okay.  Just seemed like regular pan fried steak strips over rice to us, nothing out of the ordinary.

Very tasty!! My husband and I both loved it. I added some brown sugar to the marinade per everyone elses reviews. I also added a tad of cayenne pepper to give it a little more spice and more garlic (I love garlic so always do triple amount in recipes). Fast and easy and will definitely make again.

It was wonderful.  It wasn't quite as spicy as I was expecting but it was really good.  I poured the marinade into the pan after the meat was 12 way done and it made a nice sauce for the rice if people wanted it.

It was an easy and flavorful way to cook sirlion.  I did not think it was hot or spicy, and I have a low tolerance for any spicy food.  I added fresh spinach after the meat was cooked and covered it, allowing the steam to cook the spinach.  It tasted great.  I am sure I will make it again.

This was absolutely delicious, I did substitute Uncle Ben's Long Grain & Wild Rice (Original Recipe), for the whote rice. My neighbors loved it too.
