Alot of flavors going on here with the various vegetables. The asparagus flavor is lost with the stronger flavors of the Brussels Sprouts and Broccoli. No reason to use frozen vegetables in this. Use fresh.

I used recipe as a guide because I had a ton of fresh spinach and asparagus to cook, and leftover fresh ground and seasoned bread crumbs. I did not use the brussels sprouts or broccoli, but would if I plan ahead in the future. I thought it was okay, something different, but my roommates loved it and kept picking at it before I could even put it away. I give it 4 stars because I did not follow it exactly and because of the compliments and snacking by my friends :)

This is great! I added a few almond slivers and some parmesean cheese into the recipe and it was yummy. I'm new to cooking, so easy and delicious, I will definitely try this one again!

I think the amount of bread crumbs was a little too much and probably should have been added at the end as they ended up being a bit soggy when it was all done. Also the cooking time was a little too long as the veggies ended up being a bit too mushy. I think if it cooked a little less, with a little bit more spice [of some kind], it would have been a bit more flavorful.

Excellent!  I used fresh vegetables as per the other suggestion and was very pleased with the results.  Next time I'll cut the brussel sprouts in half after cooking them (my microwave has a vegetable cycle that makes this a snap) to distribute them better.

Basic good idea, but too much cooking time.  Also the brussel sprouts overpowered the other veggies.  I will not make this again without serious modifications.

My daughter and I LOVED this dish!  We even enjoyed the warmed up leftovers.  I used all fresh vegetables and lessened the amount of Brussels sprouts after reading some of the other reviews.  I steamed the broccoli and Brussels sprouts until just turning tender as directed but roasted the asparagus with 3 pieces of bacon on a baking sheet for 25 minutes rather than steaming them. I then tossed all the vegetables together with the bacon, crumbled, and a little bit of the bacon drippings. I sprinkled the bread crumbs on top (not as much as was called for) and at the end sprinkled the top with a little grated cheddar rather than mixing the cheese in.  I am excited about making this dish for a large family gathering next week as I know it will be a hit.  This is absolutely the best way to eat your green veggies!

I'm giving this 5 stars because my kids asked me to make it again.  They gobbled it down and wanted more.  The kids and I don't really like Broccoli, Asparagus, Spinach, or Brussel Sprouts.  But, we wanted to be healthy so we made this.  We did use all FRESH, no frozen vegetables.  We used extra cheese and breadcrumbs.  We cooked it as long as the recipe said - it could have been ok cooked less but again, no complaints.

I'm just saying if you want to be healthy and eat those green veggies and you are tired of the same old salad, this is the way to go.

I did not use Brussels sprouts, and I used frozen asparagus. It turned out very good. Next time I will add a little salt and maybe some dried ground chipotle peppers for added flavor.

Fresh vegetables are tastier and easy to use. I made this with many different veggies and a whole package of mushrooms following the advice to soften the Brussels sprouts, broccoli and eggplant before baking. As I didn’t have bread crumbs I used crushed Ak-Mak crackers. They worked great. I added spicy chicken sausage. My wife claims it was the best dish I’ve ever made.

I cooked the veggies on the stove in EVOO because boiling causes veggies to lose their nutrients. I used 1/8 cup of oats instead of bread crumbs and I should have just left them out. I think this was only good because I cooked these in oil. I wouldn't have liked them steamed. I didn't have brussel sprouts so it was just a bag of broccoli and asparagus. Probably won't make them again.
