This recipe isn't only extremely easy, it's tasty too!  I put all items into a crock pot and let it heat up, it's a great way to keep it warm all evening, but it doesn't last long.  Also, I like to add some Asiago cheese and use garlic mayo, it really gives it some zest.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  It's easy to prepare with few ingredients and it tastes awesome!  I buy mini Phyllo pastry cups and put about 1-2 tablespoons of the mixture in them and bake for about 20-25 minutes. They make really great appetizers and they're a little fancier than just the dip.  I served them for Easter and for another family gathering as an appetizer.

After reading every last review on this Dip, I decided to go ahead and try the recipe for a potluck I was attending. It was a HIT. Some people in attendance were the foodie types, too, and all thought this dip was delicious. I did add to the recipe though, based on other people's reviews: Added 1tsp garlic, a few more ounces of spinach (I had fresh - boiled, drained & chopped), and a whole extra cup of cheese! Put it in a crockpot and it was all gone by the end of the night...

This was a hit at a work get together.  It was the first to go.  I served it in a bread bowl and exchanged the sour cream with cream cheese.  Also I added red peper flakes.

We all loved it!  I have always made the Lucsious Spinach Artichoke Dip from this website and my husband and I both thought this recipe was MUCH better and creamier than the other recipe.  For my alfredo sauce I used leftover Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce also from this website.  Maybe the people who don't like this recipe aren't using a good alfredo sauce??  The only change I made was that I topped it with some mozzarella cheese and put it under the broiler for a few minutes. We had it with tortilla chips and my little girl ate a whole bowl of it as is!  This is my new favorite recipe!

I found this to be incredibly bland and nothing like the restaurant dip...it wasnt even that great compared to no dip at all.  I tried doctoring it up after the fact to no avail.  It had a REALLY strong artichoke flavor, but I attribute that to the fact that there was not much else to cover up the flavor.

we used roasted garlic alfredo sauce and miracle whip instead of mayo. miracle whip taste dominated flavor and roasted garlic was to much.

I always, always double this recipe because it is so popular. I also bake it in a stoneware casserole so it stays warm for quite a long time. It's emabarrasingly simple and easy--but we love it!

This was so good. I didn't add mayo. I pretty much cooked Alfredo sauce from scratch (whipping cream, butter, parmesan chesse). But before I make the Alfredo sauce, I saute fresh spinach and artichoke hearts in olive oil and garlic. I put in the spinach and artichoke into the Alfredo sauce and stir altogether while Alfredo sauce is hot. I added a blend of Italian cheeses to make thick and creamy. Yum!

This recipe is very good.  I added two cloves of fresh minced garlic to add some spice and flavor.  This is my new "go to" spinach/artichoke dip.  My sister says it tastes too "restauranty" and not homemade.

I would have rated this 5 stars, but my Aunt does something I cannot quite figure out that makes hers just a bit better.  I doubled the recipe but only had a 16 oz. package of spinach so I just used that.  I made my own Alfredo (half and half/parm/butter) baked until the edges bubbled and that's it!  I can't say it vanished because someone else stuffed everyone with jalapeno poppers before I arrived :(  I will make this for every special occasion and will arrive early next time:)  *special note to the person that was hatin on the artichoke flavor, IT'S SPINACH ARTICHOKE DIP.

This is an AMAZING and easy recipe, I LOVED it. I added some sour cream and made in mini Phyllo pastry cups as one of the reviewers suggested. It was to die for..

This was a huge hit. My only bit of tweaking was to add 1 clove of garlic, which I am glad I did. Next time I will add two cloves.
I made a double batch which filled 30 phyllo cups and still left lots to bake in a dish. The phyllo cups went in the blink of an eye. People then started dipping tortilla chips into the baking dish. The oohing and ahhhing never stopped until some time after the dip was all gone.
The consensus was people preferred the tortilla chips to the phyllo cups. The chips added a bit of saltiness that put the dip over the the top. 
What a wonderful recipe!

This recipe is a real crowd pleaser...and so easy my husband can make it! I usually have to make 2 batches for dinner parties because it goes so fast! Just be sure to drain the spinach well or it will come out mushy.

Very good I love this recipe I added 16 oz of spinach because that's how big my package was, it was great.  I liked it better than Applebees.  Thank you very much.

I didn't think this was very good. The mayonnaise taste was pretty awful, and I don't think 20 minutes baking was enough so I had to put it back in another half hour at least.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!  This was so easy to make and very tasty!  My husband loved it so much that he made it into a meal, just sat down and ate almost the whole thing i made!  I garnished mine on top with extra cheese before putting in the oven, but otherwise, i made the recipe exactly like it said too.  My husbands only complaint was that he likes his more blended than this, so next time I'm going to blend it before i bake it.

Very tasty with some tortilla chips. My boyfriend insisted I only give it a four because I used "too much green stuff, not enough white stuff," but he was chomping it down pretty heartily, so I think you win five stars ;)

I used fresh chopped spinach and marinated artichokes which really provided a lot of flavor, then the sun dried tomato alfredo-everyone raved, and it was gone in minutes!

This was AMAZING!  I made a triple batch in a 4.5 qt slow cooker- and it was gone by the end of the party- this is addictive!  I used garlic alfredo sauce, and that seemed to be exactly what this recipe needed, otherwise I did exactly what the recipe said.  I will be making this again in a few weeks- it was so EASY!

This dip is now a favorite to bring to parties.  I added some garlic and also half a jar of sliced mild peppers to add a little extra flavor.  I brought it to a dinner with girlfriends and the five of us polished off the entire dish! It definitely got rave reviews.

This recipe was very good...though I did make some changes.  I can't leave any recipe alone!  I doubled it, as it was for a party.  I used roasted garlic alfredo sauce, some Mrs. Dash, and half of a large jar of roasted red peppers, chopped.  For the cheese, I used a Parmesan blend, and also a block of grated white cheddar.  VERY good!!!  Leftovers would be great on a sandwich, or mixed with pasta or rice!

This was quick, easy and yummy! It makes a lot, so make sure you have enough people to eat it up. It could use a little extra seasoning if you like to spice things up, but still very tasty as is.

This recipe is simple, fast, & delicious! I made it for my family and was asked when I'll be making it again. I made some minor tweaks, but they're not necessary, by any means. I used Parmesan-flavored Alfredo sauce and I sprinkled about 1/2 cup of cheese on top of the dip before I put it in the oven so that there would be a layer of melted cheese on top when you take it out of the oven. I also think it can stay an extra 3-5 minutes in the oven so that it's hot a little bit longer (it cools quickly). You can also put the dip into 3-4 smaller oven-safe bowls, which will keep the heat from dissipating as quickly. That being said, the dip is even good when it's cold! Enjoy!

I've been looking for a recipe for Spinach Artichoke dip and I have to say that this is the BEST one I have found.  It's quick and easy to make.  I usually add some garlic powder, onion powder and ground black pepper to the mixture.  I've made it four times since the holidays and it is always a huge hit!

This is a great, easy recipe for classic spinach artichoke dip.  I used Classico jarred Alfredo sauce in the recipe and I served it with pita chips.  We didn't finish it but it reheated well the following day.

This was one of the best spinach/artichoke dips I've made and it was gobbled up before I had a chance to get a second bite. I used homemade alfredo sauce, added in garlic powder and sprinkled more cheese on top of the casserole. Wonderful and thank you!

I made this for a get together last week and it was very good! But I was hoping it would taste as good as the kinds I have had in resturants, but it seemed to be lacking in something. can't put my finger on it, but it was still good!

Great dip and incredibly easy to make!  I added a little extra cheese, about a tablespoon of minced garlic and a few sprinkles of garlic powder and pepper.  I served it with french bread and pita chips.  I'd definitely make this again!

By far not the best ever spinach artichoke dip.  The alfredo sauce was overpowering and just bland. It tastes nothing like the corporate restaurant dip.  I would never recommend or make this again!  It is the easiest to make though.

Substituted sour cream for alfredo sauce. Not much flavor to this dip. Next time will add some spices -- maybe some garlic, worcestershire sauce, etc.

This is a great recipe just as it is. But try adding a can of drained shrimp, or even better, fresh tiny shrimp. Could use crab also.

This recipe resembles the spinach & artichoke dip at one of my favorite restaurants! So easy to make! I am making it for the second time this evening for a pot-luck dinner. I’m sure it will be a hit!

This dip is excellent! I see what some of the other reviewers were saying about the blandness. Perhaps adding a small amount of salt may help. After adding black pepper and lots of garlic powder, I have no complaints! Also can't ignore the fact that this is incredibley EASY and FAST to make. I'd recommend this for office parties or pot lucks.

We loved it.  I added some garlic and onion powder to give it a little more flavor.  I wouldn't change anything else.

I prepared as directed. I found this to be bland and it tasted like it was missing something, just not sure what.

I added Johnny's garlic and herb seasonings.  It was just the trick for a touch of flavor without overpowering the rest.  I also use the garlic alfredo sauce.  great recipe.  I'm sure I will use again and again

This was very good. I made it for my nephews graduation party.  I didn't feel it was the Best Ever.  But I would use this recipe until I find the BEST EVER.

It's always a hit at any party!  I also use red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.

This recipe is great, I have made it several times for family and friends and it has always been a hit and the first thing to go.  I did add fresh minced garlic to the recipe.
