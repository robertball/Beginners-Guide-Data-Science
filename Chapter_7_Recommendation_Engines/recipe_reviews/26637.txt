This satisfied my craving for a good steak with a fantastic sauce.  I used an iron skillet to prepare this in as it allows me to get the heat very high before I put the steaks in (which makes them crusty and seals in the juices).  I also sauted mushrooms and added to the sauce.  I used rib eye steaks,  fresh rosemary and beef broth.  I also used Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper...it does make a difference.  This is really an excellent recipe...a steak I would expect to get in an upscale restaurant.

Cannot wait to make this recipe again. Used filet mignon and it was superb. Also fresh rosemary. I think this would also be great for some thick boneless pork loin chops, like pork marsala. The sauce was to die for. Served with some mashed potatoes and drizzled some of the sauce on the potatoes. For a nice presentation, I took a long piece of fresh rosemary and placed it in the potatoes leaning over on the filet. Husband loved this. My mouth is watering now -- I think I will make this again tonight. Thank you for this great recipe!

I used chuck steak and it was so bad we had to throw the dinner in the garbage.  Tried this with skirt steak and it was much better and tastier.

I'd rate this 5 stars if it weren't for the chuck steaks and rosemary.  I abhor rosemary, and chuck steaks are too tough to pan fry.  I stumbled upon a 2 pound package of filet mignon marked down "Reduced for Quick Sale"  for half price at my favorite market.  I always have Marsala on hand to make Veal Marsala.  After searing the steaks, I placed them in the oven set at 200 to keep them warm.  I sauted the garlic, some shallots, and some sliced crimini mushrooms, then added 1 tsp tomato paste and let it start to brown.  Added 1 1/2 cups Marsala (no broth) and reduced it to 1 cup.  Added 4 Tblsp butter whisked in 1 T at a time, and finished the sauce with a squirt of lemon juice and some freshly chopped parsley.  Delicious!

Very good indeed.  Our only tip is - if you are not making your own chicken broth, use broth that comes in boxes and not cans.  Otherwise, when the sauce reduces, you will be left with a slightly metallic taste using canned broth.

I used tenderized chuck eye steaks that I marinaded for a couple of hours in olive oil w/ a tad bit of balsamic vinegar & rosemary & I had pretty good results...not melt in your mouth tender, of course, but not too tough, at all. I used 3/4 c of marsala ( a good one...you'll be happier w/ the results if you don't use a wine bought in the condiment section of the grocery store) & 3/4 c of chicken broth...decreasing the butter to 2 tbp. to make it less fattening. We loved this! Served coconut shrimp as an appy (I had some leftover) & then these wonderful steaks w/ corn on the cob w/ parmesan butter, fresh tomato slices &  rolls. My grandson was in hog heaven!

This was very good.  It's a great sauce.  Great for carb watchers.

As someone already suggested, great with mushrooms.  I added them at the same time I added the chicken broth and marsala.

Yummy!  I substituted 1 cup beef broth for the chicken broth and Marsala (we don't do alcohol).  I didn't have fresh garlic on hand, so used garlic powder.  I added one can of mushrooms, and cut up one leek into the sauce.  Otherwise followed instructions as posted... yummy!!  :)

This is definitely one of our favorites.  My husband raved about the taste of the sauce.  We used round steak the first time we made it and that turned out well.  Used top sirloin the next time which was a lot thicker and tended to be tougher.  We doubled the chicken broth to 1 cup and the marsala wine to 1 cup and added a can of mushrooms when we sauted the garlic.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes this is a family favorite -we made twice the first week we tried it!  Can't wait to try the sauce with chicken and pork!

Rib eye & chuck steak are two totally different quality of meat.  Rib eye find, but, chuck...without marinating it, I doubt you'll get your teeth through it.  Don't use chuck steak or you'll be sorry.

I enjoyed this recipe. Did not use chuck steak, but rather a round cut. Used beef broth instead of chicken broth and complete forgot to buy rosemary so I used dried italian seasoning. I added both sweet onion and shallots with the garlic. The flavor was spectacular. I do prefer a sauce that is thicker and I think next time will add cornstarch to the beef broth before adding it to the mixture so that it is less of something that just runs off the plate. Otherwise - awesome!

I added Baby Bella Mushrooms and onion, along with corn starch to thicken the sauce. I served it over Garlic Mashed Potatos alongside Steamed Broccolli, and it was outstanding!

I prefer to use tri-tip steaks pounded to approx 3/8inch. I added rings of onions and a bit more garlic for our tastes. This is a very delicious meal when served with garlic mashed potatoes. If your sauce doesn't reduce as much as you'd like, use a bit of corn starch or flour to the mix. Thanks for sharing.

The sauce is worth TEN stars, but the recipe is poorly written. The description says "savory rib eye steaks", while the actual recipe calls for "beef chuck steaks". Also, onions are pictured, but not mentioned in the recipe. Made with filet mignon, it was quite wonderful.

This was great but can't have any wine so used beef stock instead and one med. onion cut into rings and put in with steak. A meal fit for a king.

WHAT GREAT FLAVOR. WE HAD THIS A A RESTURANT AND WENT HUNTING FOR A RECIPE. WE ALL ATE UNTILL WE WERE ILL. ID SAY THIS AND I DID GREAT. I DID A COUPLE OF THINGS DIFFRENT. NOT CAREING FOR ROSEMARY I USED FRESH THYME. SLICED ONIONS AND MUSHROOMS. ABOUT A 1/2 CUP HEAVY CREAM JUST TO THICKEN THINGS AND ADD FLAVOR. I USED BOXED LOW SALT BEEF BROTH. THE MASALA WAS ALSO THE LOWEST SALT I COULD FIND. WHICH I FOUND WITH THE COOKING WINES.HOPE THIS HELPS YOU.

Wow! So easy and so delicious!
To be honest, I have used this site for quite some time now, and have never been inspired to go back and rate a recipe, but this is the best steak I've had in a long time, and the preparation was foolproof!
Thanks!

I bought some of this steak on sale only to realize it's not the best cut to cook with. I came across this recipe and it turned out AMAZING! My husband loved it and the leftovers were eaten. This is another recipe that has been voted into my cookbook. :-)

This was OK, nothing special, sorry.  I would not have really been able to say why until I started reading thru the reviews.  My printed copy (May 2010) says chuck steaks both places, nothing about any ribeye.  I am not a steak expert, and have to just trust the recipe, and I used the chuck steak called for (though a thin one).  So that may have been part of the issue.  I followed this exactly (except perhaps used a spread instead of butter, I don't recall).  I generally love rosemary and Marsala is fairly good (though I cook with Burgundy more).  So I'll blame it on the cut of steak it calls for.  I know the former reviewers won't see this, but for future reference, don't rate a recipe based on the picture - members just put their own pics up of how they made it.  Interesting to see what people did, but don't rate it based on that.  (A lot of folks added onions and mushrooms.)  I also noticed several people who really didn't even make this recipe at all, and that's not even counting the changes of steak cut.

This was pretty good, we really liked the sauce, though I wish it had thickened up some since I was serving the steaks with mashed potatoes. Next time I'll add a bit of cornstarch mixed with a little broth at the end to thicken it and see if that helps any.  I used beef broth instead of chicken and that seemed to work very well. I also seasoned the steaks with garlic in addition to the salt and pepper (and used ribeyes as a personal preference).  Over all I think this was very good.  With a few more tweaks it could be amazing. as it was, it tasted pretty close to something I'd be served in a restaurant.

Very good, I did not have Marsala on hand so I used 1 cup broth. I also used a couple of thick bacon wrapped steaks (the ones from Costco) I had to cook the meat longer because of the thickness. The butter is the key! Thanks!

I tweaked this a bit by marinating the meat ahead of time.  With that, this was DELICIOUS. One of the best recipes I've gotten from this site!

I really enjoyed this recipe - the sauce was terrific.  I think next time I'll add some mushrooms and maybe try to thicken the sauce a little, but it was still great as is! Thanks!

I think using a good cut is very important. mine doesn't turn out tender and juicy,probably marinating for a long time, i.e overnight will help. also substituted red wine for marsala and had to add cornstarch to thicken. I will try it again using the recommended frank steak.

Hmmm - I'll give this a 4 for a flavorful sauce (husband loved it - I thought too much rosemary) but I couldn't eat the steaks cooked only for 10 minutes - they were still very rare - I ended up cooking for at least 20-25 minutes and there was one that we couldn't eat at all because it was so pink/red. So - other than that, I followed the recipe exactly except I added worcestershire, which I wouldn't add again - I think I added too much. I'll try beef broth next time as other reviewers suggested. I will definitely try this again - maybe with a thinner cut of steak.

This recipe was really good!  I marinated the steaks for 1 hour in a mixture of olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and some crushed garlic.  Then I sauted mushrooms into the wine mixture just before it completely reduced.  It turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

Oh, I just Lovvvee this recipe.  This was my first experience with marsala, and it was absolutely finger-licking good.  I make this dish several times a month.  Don't change a thing!

Good recipe. Cut back on the rosemary if it is not a favorite for you, this spice does stand out. I used cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I also rubbed the steaks with vegetable oil and let them stand at room temperature for a couple of hours to tenderize. Other than that I made the recipe as described and it was good. I will make this again.

These were great!  Next time I will reduce the sauce a bit longer, as it thins out again when you add the butter.  A perfect recipe for when the weather won't allow for outdoor grilling.

WOW!! what a great steak sauce!! I broiled the steaks(cause my stovetop was pretty busy tonight!) and used beef broth instead of chicken broth. I ended up "licking" the pan!! A must try!!

Wow.  Just finished making this and it was fabulous.  Do not waste this great sauce on a chuck steak...definitely use rib-eyes or better.  Added finely diced onions with the garlic, and a little less chicken broth to reduce boiling time.  Use fresh rosemary!  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans sauted with butter and garlic....pour the sauce over everything and enjoy.

Very easy and tasted like I took hours to make.  I used ribeyes instead of chuck steaks and the only thing different I will do next time is add some sauted mushrooms and onions. We loved it!

I'm not sure where I went wrong, but our Marsala sauce was inedible.  It was soooo sweet even with the stock added.  Didn't help that our rump steak also turned out to be a really bad cut, so all in all a very dissapinting meal.

Usually I'm pretty good at following recipes, perhaps it was the chuck steak but this just did not come out as well as I would have liked. It was nice, but the sause didn't seem to get into the meat, just sat on top and wasn't as flavorful as I would have thought.

I cooked this last night with Chuck Steak (bone-on). It was great. Used beef broth instead of Marsala Wine and added 1/2 an onion. My family rated this recipe as 5 stars.

My husband really loved this steak.  I liked the simplicity of the recipe and I only needed one pan.  I used New York Strip because these steaks are my husband's favorite.  I do not suggest using Chuck Steak for this.

This was sooo good!  Really enjoyed the flavor.  I had no idea what I was going to do with chuck steaks & this was so easy!  I didn't have marsala, so I used cooking sherry instead & also took another reviewers suggestion to sub the chicken broth for beef broth.  Will definitely make again.

My husband and his co-workers loved it. It came out nice and juicy and it was quick and easy to make. Personally, I'd rate it a 4. I sprinkled it with garlic salt instead of regular salt and added mushrooms. I did simmer the sauce for a lot longer just to make sure the alcohol flavor wasn't too strong.

Like other reviewers, I used beef broth instead of chicken. You must use rib eye chuck!  It is the most tender of the steaks when frying. I also thickened the sauce with flour but used alittle more garlic. Everyone loved this including unexpected company!

The sauce had great flavor... I used about 1 inch steaks and it was ok. I think next time I make these I'll use a thinner cut of steak...other than that this tasted wonderful! Thanks Lynne!

This was great. I can't say that it made the meat any more tender (since it wasn't a marinade and this isn't the nicest cut), but the sauce was absolutely delicious. I served it with sauteed potato slices and green beans.I will make this again. Strange -- the ingredients are items that I have used many times with less satisfying results. They really came together nicely in this dish.

Incredible recipe.  My kids loved it and the sauce was amazing.  It is a great meal to fix during the week when all moms are looking for a quick meal.  I did double the recipe for the sauce as my side dish was mashed potatoes and I knew my children would want to use it as a gravy.

The chuck was wonderful!  I pounded it and then used the meat tenderizer.  I didn't have any marsala so I used cream sherry w/beef broth.  I also cut the steak on an angle like a flank and my DH actually though he was eating a flank steak :-)

The cut of steak is VERY important in this recipe.  Filet melted in my mouth, sirlion was a little tough.  I made a lot of changes.   In order: Maridade the steak for 24 hours (thanks IMVINTAGE).  Marinade in olive oil, vinegar, dijon, honey,  spices.  Added sauteed mushrooms and onions.  Thickened sauce at the end with flour.  Added a healthy sqeeze of lemon (thanks Dianemwj).    Used 1/3 of the butter.  Used fresh rosemary.

So delicious! Fast too. Only changes were that I used random herbs from my garden and normal cooking wine. Added some flour too to make the sauce thicker. I am a teenager and wanted to give my mom a break from cooking so I made this - whole family loved it.

I can't imagine how good this must be if you have all the ingredients.  Used Merlot as I am a heart patient and keep a lot of Merlot on hand.  Had to blend garlic powder with the broth as I was out of fresh garlic. But all that aside it was delicious.

I used top sirloin but will use filet next time. My modifications: added cornstarch to thicken and doubled the marsala amount. Also, I had previously made broth from this roasted chicken recipe which had rosemary it (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Roast-Chicken-with-Rosemary/Detail.aspx ). Next time, I won't add more rosemary to the sauce. Overall, the sauce is a hit! Served with side of boiled red potatoes and canned corn.

I cut the steak to pieces and brown the pieces.  I then added a whole head of crushed garlic to the meat.  That is the only tweak I made.  The flavor is very good.

The pan-frying went well... but, something went horribly awry with the marsala sauce. I'd prefer it without the sauce... or maybe a thicker one.

Great recipe.  This is always a hit with the family.  I tweak the sauce a bit to suite our tastes.  This added another favorite menu item to our list.

This was really good and so easy.  The only things I did different was saute one onion before the garlic and I added 1 tsp of corn starch at the very end to thicken the sauce a little.

Delicious!!  I added more garlic, used beef broth instead of chicken and thickened with cornstarch.  I am sure it would be awsome with great cuts of meat, but it is also a very good way to use up those chuck steaks that come with the rest of the meat we get when we order a 1/4 of beef.

I rubbed the meat with vegetable oil and let it sit at room temperature for an hour before cooking. I learned to do that from another recipe on this site. It helps to tenderize the meat. We enjoyed this recipe. I took the advice of another reviewer and strained out the garlic.

This was an extremely good steak recipe.  Being a hard core steak sauce person, I was hesitant to try this, but I'm glad I did.  Goodbye steak sauce, hello Marsala sauce.  I was pretty liberal with the salt & pepper, and cooked the steaks for 6 minutes on the 2nd side to make them medium done.  Even my 2 yr. old who is rejecting all forms of protein for some reason, devoured his piece of steak.  Thank you!!!

Okay... I had a horrible experience making this recipie. Without getting too much into it, I ended up broiling the steak and making the sauce in a sauce pan. With a few other minor problems, I was sure that my dinner was ruined. However, it was wonderful!!! Complications and all, I still give yummy recipie 5 stars :o)

I made this with chuck eye steak and steak seasoning instead of salt and pepper. I also added sliced onions, thinly sliced bell peppers and mushrooms to the sauce. I served it with baked potatoes. It was wonderful and my husband loved it! I will definitely serve it again.

This was good. I saw some reviews where people were debating the type of steak to use with this-- there's been a lapse between when I actually cooked this recipe and when I'm now reviewing it, but I know I bought 2 very inexpensive steaks that were labled "perfect for marinating" or something like that. They were very thin and only cost about $2-3 for both of them. I know that's a bad description, but maybe it will help someone! All in all, this was a good, easy recipe.

This was god but lacked the bold flavor I am used to.  Personal preference....    I like to try new twists on old favorites - but next time I wills tick to using Beef Consomme instead of the chicken broth.  I also thickened the sauce up a bit, another personal preference.

I made this for my husband and he loved it! It was the first time I ever made marsala sace. I added chopped onions and doubled the recipe to have enough sauce to put over our oven roasted potatoes and the chuck roast that cooked slowly all day long. My husband said if we went out to eat, it would have cost a fortune and it was better at home, made with love! I will make it again and try it with Veal and Chicken s well! Great Recipe & Compliments to the Chef!

Very good recipe! I added mushrooms and onion as recommended, and used a thin boneless rib eye. The steak cooked much quicker than expected (about 2 min/ea side); opposite happened to my sauce which needed a little extra time & cornstarch. In the end, the sauce turned out great - definately will make again.

I used a whole cup of chicken stock to reduce the sweetness and I thickned the sauce with a little cornflour. It came together very easily and tasted great.

I cooked the steaks for a lil less than suggested at first.  I added onion and fresh mushrooms to sautee with the garlic.  Then I put the steaks back into the pan to simmer on low with everything for a couple minutes.  Very tasty & juicy.  Note:  If you are going to add mushrooms and other things, you might want to double or even triple the sauce.

This was a tasty recipe.  I made it with mushrooms and onions as others have recommended.  Next time I think I´ll add a full onion (I used one-half) as the sauce gave them an incredible flavor.

hmmmm, where to begin....i had high hopes for this dish to be scrumptious & followed the recipe as written except to substitute beef broth for chicken broth. the submitter & many reviewers recommended chuck steak so i felt fortunate to find 6 pretty ones (which weighed in at a little over 1 1/2 lbs.) at my meat market. the only problem i encountered was our steaks ended up being very rare when we would have preferred them to be closer to a medium doneness. i pan fried the steaks according to the higher time variable & in addition, kept them heated in a warm oven for 10+ minutes while everything else was being prepared. had i known the instructions were for "rare" then i would have seared the meat on both sides before lowering the heat! aside from this faux pas, the marsala sauce was tasty but thin, needing either further reduction or a thickening agent. this recipe is nice but needs a little tweaking to get it where you want. we enjoyed hasselback potatoes with this dish. thank you for the recipe, lynne. i can only give it 3 1/2 stars but will try this one again!

WOW!  I very seldom feel the urge to write a review..but this one deserves it!!  Great recipe.  Very easy.  I used the other suggestions and added beef broth instead of chicken, and also added mushrooms when I sauted the garlic.  Leave them big and chunky, it adds nice texture.  The best part?  I used cube steak and they tasted like a more expensive cut!!!  Just lightly coat the steaks with veg oil and let sit at room temp for an hour before cooking to tenderize.(Got that hint here too!)  Thanks Lynne..this is a keeper!!

This recipe was great! My friend and I cooked this dinner for our boyfriends as a part of Valentine's dinner. The boys loved it! Like many other chefs using this recipe, we used beef instead of chicken broth.  My friend and I NEVER cook, and this recipe was easy and tasted great! I will surely make this recipe again:)

This is a nice, simple way to prepare steak indoors as the recipe indicates. We add 1 4.5 oz can of mushrooms and it turns out great. I do a little bit of cornstarch to thicken the gravy to our preference. I use this one on ribeye steaks as well.

I used topical-flavored rum and savory instead of Marsala and rosemary, because that's what I had on hand. Nice, subtle sauce.

Actually not a bad recipe, however the distinction must be made: if you're using ribeye sure, follow it. Chuck is a different story, you need to marinate or brine for several to 24 hours, or slow-cook for a few hours (4 to 6), if you don't want a tough mouthful of meat.

we used this recipe for chicken and I did not care for it at all. The wine seemed to overpower everything. I eat this dish at my favorite restraunt all the time so maybe I did something wrong. I will try it with steak next time and see how it works.

This was pretty tasty I think the only downfall is using the chuck steak.  Its just such a tough piece of meat no matter which way you cook it.  I will make this again but with a different cut of meat.

although the recipe/pic is confusing with ribeye vs chuck it is very good.  The sauce alone is worth saving this one.  As warmer weather comes along here I can't wait to make it again with filet cooked on the grill.    Most delicious!

This was very good, I think next time I will try the rosemary, I did not have any this time so I used a little thyme, and I think I cooked a little too long because the sauce evaporated a lttle too much and I did use mushrooms. My husband and kids liked it and thats all that counts.  I also grilled the steaks but next time will try pan frying it. I had some really good steaks so I was scared to pan fry them.

Not as tender or flavorful as I would have liked.  Ended up dipping my steak into ketchup.

Perhaps the cut of beef wasn't correct.  I used beef shoulder London broil.  Also used beef broth instead of chicken broth.

I cooked the steaks covered with the gravy for a time hoping the wine would soften them.  Perhaps it was not long enough.

I used thin cuts of T-Bone, which cooked pretty fast.  I did forget about the rosemary which might have made a difference because I thought this was very bland.  I usually make chicken marsala, which is better for me.  I thought I had beef stock, but only had chicken which also might have made a difference.  Otherwise, I didn't like this one at all.

This was really good.  Both the husband and I enjoyed it.  I used beef broth instead of chicken & extra garlic.  I also used a ribeye steak & tenderized it with oil, so it was very tender.  Will definitely make again.

Well, the first description of this recipe says to use rib eye steaks.(my favorite)I printed this out long ago & asked my butcher to give me chuck steaks.  Way too much fat. I really wasn't impressed by the sauce, even though it sounded good. I don't understand all the raves- oh, well, I guess everyone has different tastes.

Great recipe and a good way to enjoy a low-carb meal.  I used baby portabello mushrooms and it was delicious.  I would have liked a thicker sauce but didn't want to up the carb intake.
