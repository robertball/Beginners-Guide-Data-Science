This is the second time I have made these, and I was so impressed with the way they taste I had to try them again, even though they didn't bake up as well as I would have liked the first time.  So this time I made a few necessary changes.  First, these require a bit more flour than the recipe calls for, so I used about 2 1/4 cups of flour instead of just 2 cups.  Next, the recipe doesn't call for any baking soda (which it needs), and these spread perfectly with 1 t. of bking soda added.  The other change I made was the sugar.  Instead of 1 C of white sugar I used 1/2 C white sugar, and 3/4 C brown sugar.  These changes made this cookie perfect all around.  They are soft and yummy and the chocolate and orange together are a great combo!

I loved this recipe!  My mom has been making orange choc. chip cookies all my life, and half-way into this recipe I started thinking, "Could the addition of  frosting be worth the work?"  Is it ever!   They are the most lovely choc.chip cookies, and the frosting takes them over the edge--hell, my family would it *it* alone . . .  Surprisingly easy, wonderfully flavorful, didn't seem to take long when all was said and done.  These cookies are definately going to be a regular at our house . . .

When I bit into this cookie, it reminded me of those orange nougat filled chocolates.  Did not like at all.  Took them to work and about 3 people tried them and none of them liked them either,  threw the rest of the batch away.

I made these the other night without the frosting. They were gone within a day! How delicious!

One of my childhood favorites!  One of only thing I have changed is to cut the icing recipe in half as it makes way too much.  The other change is to generously add more orange zest to both the cookies and the icing.  So yummy!
