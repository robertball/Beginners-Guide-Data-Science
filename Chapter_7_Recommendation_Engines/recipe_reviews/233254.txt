This is the most delicious fish I have ever made or even had. I used tilapia instead of sea bass because I didn't want to bother with my grill, and because my grocery store had a great deal on fresh tilapia. I sautéed the tilapia in a teaspoon of coconut oil over medium high heat for maybe 3-4 minutes per side. I accidentally used 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. I was worried it would overpower the dish, but thankfully the sauce was very forgiving and still balanced. I also (intentionally) used 2 cloves of garlic because I love it so much. I served this with cauliflower "rice" (I Ross some cauliflower in the food processor until it is the consistency of rice) sautéed with chopped shiitake mushrooms; snap peas tossed with a wee bit of sesame oil, soy sauce, and lots of black pepper-cooked under the broiler.

I tried this tonight and it was amazing!  I used Sriracha for the chili sauce, and added a teaspoon of Thai Chile Ginger sauce plus a teaspoon of Ponzu Lime sauce.  My husband grilled the seas bass as instructed and it was perfect.  Moist inside with a nice crisp char on the outside.  Wish I had taken a picture. Served with log grain wild rice and sugar snap peas.  WILL make again!!  Probably too often!

I use this dressing on steak, pork, fish, chicken, and even white rice! Everything is amazing with this dressing. I put it in a saucepan on low heat for a while to meld the ingredients. This is a favorite in my house.

I watched the video, and Chef John said this sauce would be good on chicken or other types of fish.  The fish market had no sea bass today, so I bought some salmon.  Right before dinner, it started to rain, so grilling outside was not an option.  I just used the grill pan on the stove top, and this turned out pretty well.

Our friend could not stop eating the sauce. She put it on vegetables and pretty much anything she could find. Very tasty and so very easy.

Awesome flavors and super easy to throw together. My only advice is for the folks who typically don't measure because we are such experts at estimating :)... I highly recommend MEASURING the fish sauce because it is EXTREMELY salty and a little too much could ruin some really expensive fish.

Super fast and easy, yes; but, watch added salt. Only change... I brushed the fillets before grilling with half the dressing instead of extra oil.  I’m sure I’ll prepare this again.

Love! Super easy. I did a little more Asian style with some sautéed bok choy, mushrooms and bean sprouts. You really can’t go wrong sea bass.

It's very nice and we will definitely make it again! I didn't have the fish sause, so I added one teaspoon of soya sauce instead. Also, one tablespoon of lime and lemon zest. Perfect.

Very Good!! I didn't have a fresh lime so I zested a lemon and used bottled lime juice.  I agree that it was a bit salty but not so much as to rate it a 1 or 2 star.  Maybe different brands of asian fish sauce contain different levels of sodium?? Next time I'll use 1 tablespoon.  I will definitely make this again exactly as stated except for the fish sauce which I'll reduce to 1 TBSP.

it was delicious. For those who find it too salty i think its because of the fish sauce. I only put a couple tsp. 2tbp. of fih sauce I think is way too much.
I loved it and definitely will make it again and again.

Amazingly simple and wonderful flavours  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the cooking method. I put it in an aluminum fish on the bar b que 6 minutes per side. Melt in your mouth. Definitely a family favourite

Epic sauce recipe. Super easy to make. I also exchanged tilapia in place of grouper and cooked in a skillet. I imagine this sauce would do any white fish proud, or even chicken for that matter.

I thought this was a delicious recipe! I added more garlic and lime zest/juice then it called for. I also decreased the fish sauce to 1 tablespoon because I've had issues with how salty it is in the past. Great, quick recipe that would be delicious on almost any fish!
