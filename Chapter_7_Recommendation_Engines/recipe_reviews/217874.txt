I made this recipe and used chicken thighs but didn't stuff them.  I mixed bacon, feta, diced tomatoes, 1 tsp. of dried basis and poured over thighs in slow cooker.  Very, very good!!!

Didn't have the chicken thawed out in time to put in the slow cooker, so stuffed them and put them in the oven at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. I only had a can of diced tomatoes with garlic, so used one can of diced tomatoes and sprinkled dried basil over all. The flavor was mainly from the tomatoes, but very tasty. Next time I will double the stuffing and try it in the crockpot.

Made this dish last night, folowed recipe as originally written, didnt substitute anything.  Not willing to give this dish a 5, but the flavor was good,  sauce very runny, I will make dish again but will add a little salt and maybe add something to thicken up sauce a tad.  Besides that, all and all, it was a good meal.  Cooked up some angel hair pasta and served with it.

Very delicious!  The only things I changed were adding a few pats of butter to brown the boneless chicken breast and then made a balsamic drizzle to use before servings.  Yum yum!!

This wasn't my favorite.  I love the idea, but I felt there was something missing.  I do think I will try this again, but I will try  different cheese and more seasonings.

I made Garlic Spinach from here with fresh spinach and proceeded with the recipe adding the cooled spinach to the stuffing. I browned the breasts  before stuffing to give them some color and rested the stuffed breasts on top of the diced tomatoes. I served with Lemon Pecan Pilaf and green beans. Served to company and was very well recived! Thanks!

We all loved it. The bacon adds a smokey flavor. I was nervous about my 9 year old not liking it, but she did! I didn't stuff them as I had no time, but I mixed everything up and put it on the chicken and it turned out great. Will definitely make this again. Super easy to make during a busy week.

I loved this recipe! We changed it a bit and put a can of tomatoes with green chile's in it, for a little extra flavor. We'll definitely make this again!

This was really good. I will add salt next time, but other than that, I think it was great. Served with tortellini and garlic bread.

I made this w/ drumsticks and I just slit the thicker part of the meat and used the toothpicks as suggest.  I also boiled the meat just a little bit to decrease cooking time in crock pot. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned but boiled them a little. (also I put a little of the boiled water in the crock pot). I used Turkey bacon instead of Pork. Sides included a salad, green plantains and yellow (sweet plantains)... The meal was delicious and needed just a little bit of Frank's hot sauce to make it perfect.  Very low sodium diet seemed like! Will make it again.

I made something similar to this off the top of my head a while back.  I also added fresh thyme into the feta mixture. it was delicious.  I think next time i make it, i'm going to try to crust the chicken with Pistachios.

This was an odd recipe. I'm a fan of chicken,  bacon, fetta cheese and spinach however somehow something was amiss. Perhaps I over-cooked or over-stuffed the chicken (see picture) as it was a bit dry. However, I'm glad to have tried it. Wouldn't make again.

Surprisingly delicious, and I had my doubts! Does need a bit of salt, and next time I think I'll try added spinach. The tomatoes really do have a lot of flavor, and the chicken is moist and tender.

Fantastic!  I dusted my chicken in basil, garlic, crushed red pepper, S&P before searing it in Olive Oil.  Once seared, I transfered it to the crock and then cooked the bacon in the same pan as the chicken. Once cooked, I stuffed the chicken with the bacon.  Added Italian styled tomatoes and then some beef stock.  When I was ready to serve, I took the chicken and stuffed it with the feta and put in the oven at 425 until the feta melted. For my very picky 7 year old, I used Mozzarella.  Dish was a hit iwth everyone!

This was better than I expected! I used frozen chicken breasts and set my slow cooker on low for 7 1/2 hours and it came out great. I'm sure it would have been even better if I had stuffed them. I did add some much needed garlic and salt. When done it was still missing something so like other reviewers, I added shredded cheese to the final product. My family liked egg noodles with this dish and I had mine in a bowl over spinach. I will definitely make it again.

I made this in the oven - 350 for 20 minutes (the chicken had been pounded to 1/2 thickness). Salt & peppered the chicken, poured organic diced tomatoes over the chicken, sprinkled the cooked bacon and feta over the top. Fantastic! Served with orzo and Garlic Spinach as another user recommended. So good AND very easy dinner.

So delicious and SOOOO easy!  Other reviewers mentioned this recipe being runny so I just added french bread to help soak the juices.  The chicken wasn't big enough to stuff so I just mixed everything in the cooker and it came out great.

This recipe was amazing, the chicken was juicy and textured, the feta and bacon extremely flavorful. I followed a tip in the reviews that advised patting them a bit with butter but the end product was wonderful and very filling. I didn't think there was a huge tomato taste at all and it cooked great.

Also the final product is more attractive than the picture associated with the recipe!
