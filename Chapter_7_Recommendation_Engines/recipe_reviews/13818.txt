I used agar agar instead of gelatin, and orange+apple juice instead of apple juice. Smells nice, but tastes like the spices. Will not be making again.

It was okay, but nothing great. I'd stick with the regular pumpkin pie.

I LOVE pumpkin anything and it's so good to have a recipe that is guilt free.
