This was a great recipe that I tweaked a little.  I used canned corn that I sauteed with the sage and a little butter until the corn was slightly browned and grated in a pinch of fresh nutmeg then added it to the polenta.  By sauteeing the sage, it softens the flavor   This was super good!

Pretty good, but there was a lot of sage. My dad couldn't even finish it because it was so strong. I'd maybe cut the sage in half.

Not too bad.  I used frozen corn instead.  This recipe makes a ton.  I wish I had cut the recipe down because I don't really like it cold.

Very good - this reminds me of dinner with relatives in the Piedmont region in Italy. A wonderful side dish... Sliced and grilled the leftovers the next day which was just as delish as the night before! Thanks for this recipe!

This was my second attempt at polenta.  Though better than the first, something still wasn't right.  The flavor was good, but we didn't care for the roasted corn chunks, they were a little too sweet.

This would probably be better if you cut down on the sage. It was a little over-powering.

First time having and making polenta.  Really good recipe, followed the tip to cook corn in a little butter and added 1 Tbs dried sage. I'll be making this again!

I made this without the corn, and it was delicious.  My whole family, including young children, enjoyed it.

I'm sure the fresh roasted corn would have been awesome - but I only had frozen and it was still a hit

I actually forgot to put the cheese in and it was still really delicious. It is very hardy and we had a lot leftover, but it was delicious heated up the next day, as well. Definitely use fresh corn.

This recipe is a keeper, thanks so much! For the corn, I just popped open a can of corn, and put it under the broiler for 12 minutes. I also mixed in some okara that I had left over from making soy milk, and it blended in beautifully, and gives the dish some protein. I loved the spices, and actually doubled up on them.
