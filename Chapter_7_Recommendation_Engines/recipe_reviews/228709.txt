I thought this was a pretty good recipe. However, it does come out kind of bland and lacking in seasoning. For me though, this is an extremely easy fix. 

I seasoned mine with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and some of my home made Italian seasoning (crushed sun dried tomatoes, basil, oregano, dried garlic, etc). I didn't have any smoked cheese, so I added a little bit of smoked paprika also. Still, this dish was really good and my family loved it. I suggest to anyone to experiment with it some more and make it their own.

Surprisingly good I have to admit I didn't think it would be. I did add chopped green peppers, garlic and sliced onion saut√©ed them all with the smoke sausage, then added cheese and Progresso Three Cheese Cooking Sauce and penne. followed direction and voila! Very good quick meal.

This dish is pretty darned good!  I used fire roasted diced tomatos as that's what I had on hand, undercooked the pasta by 3 minutes and used a smoky cheddar which I doubled and it was really good.  I wanted to eat a second serving but the richness of it kept me from being able to finish it all.  My husband enjoyed it and told me he'd love for me to make this agin!  I'd say tonight's dinner was a success!

I think the main thing to remember here, is these starter sauces are not inteneded to make gourmet meals but to help busy people prepare and make a family dinner in a short period of time and with very little fuss.  I could see the sauce was on the watery side so while the pasta was cooking I simmered the sauce and tomatoes with some black pepper to thicken it a little and It really did seem to make a difference.  I also added grated parmesan.  This turned out ok, nothing I would rush to make again but an edible family meal!

I tried this recipe and it was pretty good.  I will probably make it again, but will add some sweet onion, garlic, and definitely brown the smoked sausage. My kids said it needed some bacon so I may try that as well.  Pretty quick meal for a work night.

This recipe was seriously saved, by the review of Terry E. I sauteed some roasted garlic chicken sausage, as that is what I had. I like sausage crisp, so I wasn't going to bake it raw. Like that reviewer I added the same additions: I did 1/2 green pepper sliced, 1 large garlic clove minced, and 1/4 small white onion sliced. After sauteing the sausage slices I turned the heat down and slightly caramelized those ingredients. I also added a pinch of garlic salt, and a 1/2 cup extra cheese to thicken it, as I found the sauce thin and in need of some extra flavor. I liked all of the ingredients, but there was an after taste of the tin can to the sauce. I am not against using canned sauces or soups, on occasion to save time, as long as they blend well with the rest of the ingredients in the dish. It was fine for my family, this evening, just not a dish I would serve to guests.

While I was waiting for the oven to preheat and the pasta to cook, I decided to brown up the smoked sausage in a skillet with some onion and garlic-it was a nice touch, both for the look of the sausage and the flavor additions of the onions and garlic.  When stirring in the cheese, I felt the need to add more and am glad I did.  Other than that, this would be better with fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of plain.

My family really enjoyed this, but I had made too much pasta, so the sauce did not cover all of it. Other than that, it was pretty good as it was. I might suggest adding a little bit of colored bell peppers to it, but it was good enough to try again.

I made some serious modifications - but I loved it once it was done:

We used Three Cheese Light alfredo sauce instead of the recipe creations, I used minced onions because I'm lazy, added minced garlic, used italian flavored diced tomatoes, used Chicken Hardwood Smoked Sausage from Hillshire Farms, and used whole wheat elbow macaroni.   I also put the whole cup of cheese in and then put another half cup on the top since I didn't read the directions well enough ;)  I called it mac & cheese for my 5 year old twins and they loved it also.

I did not care for this recipe.  I usually try to see the bright side of every dish.

Very easy and much better than I thought it was going to be.  I used garlic flavored al fresco natural chicken sausage.

I made recipe as written with no tweaks. As is this recipe was not a winner in my house. It works as a base but it needs help to make it something good. I doubt I would make it again but if I did I would add garlic, onion, pepper and other seasonings to give it better flavor and hide the from a can taste.

Very good with a few tweaks. Definitely needed diced green pepper and onion (sauted with the sliced sausage) and used Rotel in place of the diced tomatoes. Instead of smoked sausage I used venison ring bologna and that was perfect. Easy and filling!

I followed the directions mostly but took others advice and added diced red pepper, onion, garlic, and added Spanish smoked paprika, basil, oregano, Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. It could use more Creek sauce, I added a little milk and more shredded cheese. All of these additions helped the dish a lot, I'll make this again!

I just made it and it is very delicious. I made a few changes to the recipe.  I used diced tomatoes with chilies and I added blanched asparagus and green beans. I also added a few sliced fresh mushrooms.
