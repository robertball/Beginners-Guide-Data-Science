I had so much rhubarb that I used twice as much as the recipe called for with 2 cups sugar but it was wonderful! My family loved it and it was gone before it got cold.

My family's been making this recipe ever since we found it at a potluck. We've found it's also very good with raspberries if you don't have any rhubarb. A tip: never, ever, ever use half and half in place of cream. The rhubarb will stay crunchy and sour and the whole thing will be soupy- inedible. I know this because my mother tried this once.

I've been making this cake for years and it's my DH's favorite!  Be sure to refrigerate the leftovers (if there are any) because it's even better the next day.

My husband said this was the best rhubarb dessert that he ever had.  I used 4 cups of rhubarb and only 1 cup of sugar and then added a sprinkling of cinnamon.  2nd time I made it I didn't have heavy cream so I used about 3/4 cup of half and half and it turned out great.  Soooo easy!

I am rating this cake 4 due because it is too sweet. This coming from a sweet tooth.  The sugar ratio (to me) over-powers the rhubarb. When it is a Rhubarb Cake...rhubarb should be the star of the cake. The flavor of it should be forefront.  Not sugar.  However, it is very, very easy to make and I like the fact that it is not too custardy.  The contrast between textures are spot on to me. Might be due to the fact that I left in 10 minutes longer.  I definitely agree-- the recipe is a keeper but I will (like the other suggestions) increase the rhubarb to 4 cups and decrease sugar to 3/4-1 cup.  The sugar already in the cake mix compensates enough but even with original recipe measurements a delicious cake.  The whipping cream gives it that homey goodness. Note:  I do agree that the box cake mix flavor comes thru but recipes like this--are for quick, tasty, easy desserts.  This recipe perfectly fits tha' bill.  If were not for the over sweetness, I would give it 5 for a GOOD BOXED CAKE recipe and it is highly adaptable to other substitutions as well as additions.  Great job.

This recipe was one that I have seen for a while but thought it was too easy to be good.  I was wrong!  It was delicious and easy.  I only had a lemon cake mix so used that instead and it turned out great!  My parents loved it.  Next time I might add a bit more cream because I LOVE the custard that it makes at the bottom of the cake.  This is a delicious and fast cake!

I took other suggestions and doubles the rhubarb, upped the sugar to 2 cups ( could make this less) and added more cream.  I also used lemon cake mix, and upped cook time 15 min.  This made it tangy and we thought better than original cake,  thanks for this easy recipe!

It was good but not a five star.  My husband loved the edges.  I thought it could have used more rhubarb.  Next time I will double the rhubarb but keep the sugar the same.  I like the tartness of the rhubarb but this lacked it.

This recipe is fantastic!  I have never baked anything with Rhubarb before, but a friend gave me some fress Rhubarb and I wanted an easy recipe to start with, this one was a winner!  The only change I made was to put the rhubarb with the sugar in a ziplock bag first, then prepared the cake mix, this really let the rhubarb mix well.  My kids (very picky) LOVED this cake!

OK, My mom makes this with exception to a couple things. She uses 4 CUPS RHUBARB and only 1 cup sugar and 1 pint whipping cream. Seriously the best rhubarb cake in the whole wild world.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars with the following amendments:  - use white cake instead of yellow cake - use 4-6 cups of rhubarb, not 2 - use 1/4 cup of sugar, not 1 and 1/4 cups  When I first tried the recipe as posted it was MUCH too sweet, and the rhubarb was lost.  As amended, it is just a little hint of sweet with lots of rhubarb tang.  I love it, and I make it a lot in the summer.  Everyone who loves rhubarb raves about it.

Tart, creamy, cakey, yummy!! The best! I used a french vanilla cake mix and it was just dreamy, my family can never wait until anything cools though, so I will have to make it again. I will definately be using this as a rhubarb standby----- oh and sooo easy!

I made this with 4 cups of rhubarb, the amount of sugar called for, a lemon cake mix, and messed up and used a full pint of whipping cream.  The extra whipping cream made it very "moist" on the bottom.  Either the sugar and/or the cake mix made it too sweet.  I ended up cutting up raw rhubarb and microwaving it in a bowl and then adding that to each of my servings to get the right tart to sweet taste that I wanted.  Probably won't make again.

This has been a favorite for years.  I also up my rhubarb to 4 cups, sugar only 1 cup, and whipping cream 1 1/2 cup (table cream and 1/2 & 1/2 will not set up for a nice custard)  Always a hit!!

This is just like the cake my aunt would make in the summer when we had family functions! Thank you!!!  I knew what the ingredients were, but didn't remember the quantities.  I used a Lemon cake mix with some frozen rhubarb and it was delicious!!  Next time I will try this with blackberries instead of the rhubarb :)

there are few recipes that I just give solid 5... this is one.  Just did the recommendation of double rhubarb and 2 cups sugar. I've added strawberries in the past. It's a perfect combination.

Splendid

My recipe calls for 4-1\2 cups of rhubarb over batter followed by the sugar sprinkled over rhubarb followed by a whole pint of heavy whipping cream. Makes the most delicious rhubarb custard under a moist cake top. Never fails to turn out and disappears quickly. Requested by everyone.

Awesome.  Use a butter recipe golden cake mix and about 5 cups of rhubarb, cut sugar to 3/4 c and sprinkled 2T red strawberry jello powder over top of cake when I dumped it all together.  Took about 45 min to bake but it was great for a summer picnic!  My 5 yr old could make this its so easy!

OH MY GOSH! This was by far a great simple desert. I did used 4 c. frozen rhubarb and let it drain for a about 1 hour as suggested by others. Also as suggested I cut the sugar. I used  1 & 1/4 c. sugar for the 4c. rhubarb. This is the 2nd time I made it & I put in rhubarb a pkg. fo sugar free strawberry jello. Loved it this way too! Someone said a cake mix had a store bought taste to it. I always use 1/2 milk and 1/2 water for the liquid, plus oil and eggs as specified in cake mix directions when making a cake mix. My friends never realize that it is a mix until I tell them.

Absolutely the best!  I even made it healthier by making my own yellow cake with whole wheat flour and less sugar. I used more rhubarb and less sugar in the topping. The cake was gone before it cooled off!

This was absolutely delicious.  I was worried that it would be too sweet, but it has just enough sugar to sweeten the rhubarb and the cream.  I did use about four cups of rhubarb because I got a  little carried away when I was cutting it up, but it still turned out great.  Thank you for this wonderfully easy and tasty recipe.

Delicious!  Extremely moist.  Rhubarb added a nice tartness.  I only used 1 cup of sugar and it turned out well.

I took other reviewers suggestion and used 4 cups rhubarb. I used 1 1/2 cup of sugar. It was perfect!  I also used just a bit more (maybe an extra 1/4 cup) cream. I can't imagine using only the amount of rhubarb the recipe calls for.  It should be the star of the show! Will most definitely make this again!! The only change I would make....if any....is maybe just a little more cream as I love the custard it produces. yum yum yum!!

I want to give this the highest possible review, since this is a great dessert, even though I feel the amounts and baking time are off. My family also makes this, but we do the following: use 4c rhubarb, sprinkle over prepared cake batter, put 1c sugar over rhubarb, pour 1c heavy whipping cream over all, and bake for 1hr. Easy as 4-1-1-1! I love the simplicity and yet complexity of the moist cake, custard-y bottom, sweetness with tangy. I think if you only used 2c rhubarb, you would lose the fresh, tangy rhubarb flavor in all the sweetness. It's great served hot or cold, with vanilla ice cream or cool whip or by itself.

I have been making this for years.  In my oven it does take close to an hour to bake and because of all the extra cream it doesn't get completely set in the center so the tooth pick may not be completely clean.  It will have cooked enough to be safe.

Made this today but used 3 cups Rhubarb and it was fantastic. Will definitely make again. When you cut and serve make sure to turn upside down. Would probably be good with some fresh raspberries on top for looks and garnish.

I followed the recipe to a T and what some called custard seemed slimy and mushy to me. Maybe it was the glass baking pan. I will stick to rhubarb breads.

This has been my go to for great desserts for 10 + years. My changes - 1 use more rhubarb 4 - 5 cups, plus I use what I have on hand for the cup of cream like fat-free 1/2&1/2 or evaporated milk. Bake 1hour 15 min - 1hr 30 min checking from 1hr on toothpick.

This cake was very easy and tastes good. I followed the recipe exactly, but I'm still confused. Why does the rhubarb go on top of the cake batter rather than vice versa? Shouldn't the batter go on top of the rhubarb so when you turn it upside down (hence the name "Upside Down Cake) the fruit would be on top? My rhubarb and custard is mixed throughout the cake, rather than being in a layer. I will try a different recipe in the future.

Made as directed except used 10% cream and it turned out fine.  Maybe because I didn't cut back on the sugar?  Left in pan and just flipped over pieces as served (still warm).  Added cinnamon for personal taste.  Next time I will try adding more rhubarb if I have enough.  Its still a cake mix but it is a quick and easy dessert.  There are plenty of other recipes for those who want to make their own cake. Used a glass 9x13.

I have served this cake at many functions, and I have yet to see leftovers!  I too cut the sugar and double the amount of rhubarb.  I have also used 2 cups rhubarb and 2 cups triple berry blend or variations of other fruits with the rhubarb, and it always goes quickly.

This was super easy to do. The cake to rhubarb ratio is off. Too much cake not enough rhubarb. I used three cups of rhubarb and about 3/4 cup of sugar. I like the cake with the Rhubarb Upside Down Cake I, better and it doesn't have all the added fat from the whipping cream.

I've been making this for about a year & I love it. Yesterday I threw in a few leftover raspberries with the rhubarb. What a great combination.

This was a super easy recipe and it tasted fantastic. I ended up making two of them in 2 days, one for a BBQ and one for the family.

I was not thrilled with this -- I needed something to use up a boxed cake mix that was taking up room in  my pantry.  And I did have rhubarb in the freezer.  The idea is great for the southern menu we had planned -- chili and collard greens (from this site) -- but the taste of a boxed mix still comes through.  Next time I will make it from scratch with the rhubarb.  Thanks for the idea, though.

Love this recipe! So many of these cakes are far to sweet and this one is just right! I have used half and half for the whipping cream and it has worked just as well.

Love this cake. I'm not a big rhubarb fan but this recipe makes the rhubarb flavor less intense.. Will make this again and again.

So quick and easy and soooo nummy gone in an instant gave a few pieces to co-workers and babysitter and they gobbled it up and were drooling for more.  I've never cooked anything with rhubarb before but but a plant and its sooo huge I've been experimenting.  Thanks for the recipe!!

It doesn't get any better than this! I'd give it six stars if I could. We've been making this recipe for years and everyone absolutely loves it.

WOW! 5 stars on ease of preparation and 5 stars on taste! It's DEE-LISH! I'm trying hard to stay away from the leftovers and I'm finding it's most difficult. This is a keeper!
