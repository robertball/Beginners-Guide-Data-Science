I made this recipe twice. The first time I follow the directions exactly and they were way too hot for my personal taste. We had friends over to try them and they, liking hot and spicy food, said the fritters were not too hot at all. They said the fritters weren't anthing special, a bit too greasy, and definitely have lots of napkins handy but"...I guess, okay." Their feeling was they are too labor entensive for what you end up with. The second time I made them, I toned down the heat and didn't deep fry them.  I upped the ratio of cornmeal to flour and I used some whole wheat flour. To keep the original idea of the spiciness, I did add some taco mix seasoning; enough so you could tell it was definitely there. I didn't deep fry them; I fried them much the way you would cook a crabcake. I removed them from the skillet, placed them on a cookie sheet, covered and baked them for 20 minutes. During the last 5 minutes of cooking, I sprinkled on half of them some shredded pepper jack cheese. I made the Cilantro Dip pretty much like the recipe but for the hot seasonings and salt and I added a little taco seasoning. I was after the taste, just not the heat. My guests said the second batch were okay but they definitely preferred the heat. They liked the texture of the second set and they were less greasy. And I think I preferred the ones with the pepper jack cheese on them. We decided they were okay but, nothing to brag about.

I have to admit we really liked these!  They did take a bit of effort to make, but we had them for lunch and they were a hit with the whole family!  I used Masa Harina instead of the corn meal because it's what I had.  I think it may have made the texture less grainy than it would have been with corn meal.  They could use a little pinch of salt in the bean mixture as well.  No greasiness as some others mentioned.   Thanks for this recipe!..

These weren't bad, but they were not good either.  Deep fried them & then baked them as the recipe specified & they were just greasy on the outside (even though I did drain them on the paper towel) & the inside was too dry.  For the amount of work that went into making these fritters they were nothing special.  Of the 3 people eating them, everyone agreed that they were sort of "blah".

Instead of deep frying, I fried these like pancakes.  I used jalapenos as a garnish instead of putting them in the dough. When these were browned, I served them without baking, garnishing with cilantro sauce (which was too salty, though that might be the fault of the brand of ranch dressing I used), jalapenos, cheese, red onions, olives and more fresh cilantro.  Next time, I'll make the dough without sweetener and make my own cilantro sauce so it won't be too salty!

The flavor was good in these but boy oh boy were they ever greasy. Even after a lot of squeezing them with paper towels. Next time I make them I'll attempt baking them or stove top without the oil.
