I see there has been some negativity about this recipe. One said they didnt puff up enough. One said they were too bland, and tasted too much like flour. I found that if you rolled them too thin they didnt puff up they ended up flat, but if you rolled them thick enough they turn out fine. As far as taste I just added a bit more vanilla then it asked for and it was fine. As far as tasting too much like flour I can see that happening if you use the four cups and add the whole other two, or as much as recipe submitter has to use when she makes them due to her humidity. I used the four in the beginning but only used one cup at the end. I left my dough a little tacky but made somewhat of a ball out of it while tacky, then dipped the ball all sides into some flour that I had on the table, worked it in a bit then rolled out on floured surface. That seemed to help out with the over flouring. So for me I liked this recipe and it turned out great, cooking is all about experimenting and tweaking till you get it just the way you want.

Yummy!  These definately did puff.  I was amazed.  I have been searching for a fluffy cake like cookie and this is it!!  I actually sat in front of the oven and watched them puff.  They taste great, better with frosting.  Totally easy, I did not even follow the recipe perfectly!  I used butter instead of shortening, regular milk instead of sour and cinnamon instead of nutmeg!  They key is to add flour, but just enought to keep from sticking to the table and not to roll them too thin, then they come out perfect, melt in your mouth soft!!!

I have been searching for a sugar cookie recipe that would produce a soft cookie that was easy to decorate--this is it!  It made 85 cookies because sometimes I rolled the dough thinner.  The nutmeg gives it the perfect kick.  I used 1 cup sour cream instead of sour milk.  I frosted them with "Buttercream Icing" from this site and they turned out perfect.  I stored about half of the cookies in a Rubbermaid container for several days and they were still fresh, same with the frosting...Try it!

These cookies are the BEST! They taste exactly like Lofthouse Cookies! (they might be regional, sorry if you haven't had them) I am throwing away all of my other sugar cookie recipes for this one! Everyone I gave them to called me back to tell me how awesome they are. I didn't change a thing except I had to add more flour to roll them out...I didn't even have a rolling pin either I just patted them out with my hands and smoothed them over. Anyone who says they had a problem with the dough being sticky or bland are apparently not very good bakers and/or are .

Wonderful, soft and yummy cookies! I have waited for a recipe like this. They puff up just right and have just the perfect hint of flavoring. You should have no problem with these cookies at all,, just follow the recipe, and remember to use updated ingredients, not out of date stuff, as u will always have a problem. 
Great and thanks for posting!!!

Very good. You can make them without rolling out, also. Add just enough flour that they will hold their shape a little better. Drop a tablespoon of dough in a bowl of sugar. Roll in a ball and drop on paper lined pan. They bake up nice and puffy with crispy outside and soft, cakey inside. Use half butter with the shortening and add twice the amount of vanilla for richer flavor.

These made wonderful, stay-soft sugar cookies! We made Valentine cookies over the weekend and this is by far the best sugar cookie recipe ever. Very light, not too sweet, cookies!

This is simply the best sugar cookie recipe around! My local bakery makes the best sugar cookies ever, and it looks like I found their recipe. I have made these 3 times in 1 month, I cant keep them around. I ran out of nutmeg and used a little cinnamon and cloves instead, it was great!(but better with the nutmeg) Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I did not care for this recipe. I had to add 4 extra cups to even make the dough roll-able and work-able. Even still it stuck to my counter and cookie cutters.  After baking, they looked great. Nice and puffy, but after biting into one, they are tasteless. They taste like flour and not much else.  I wasted my time on this and my ingredients.

This went over BIG with my daycare.  We had fun making and eating them.  we used the "Sugar Cookie Icing" recipe to decorate.  Just the right combo. not too sweet.  I think next time I'll use half butter, half shortning and some almond flavoring.

I have mixed feelings about this recipe. I did have to use all 6 cups of flour, and even then it was too sticky to roll out, so instead of adding even more flour, I just dropped the batter onto the cookie sheet with two spoons. The flavor was definitely flat, so I added 1 tbsp vanilla, 1 tbsp butter flavoring, and 1 tsp orange extract(though I think almond would be better).  I must admit, after adding additional flavorings, I ate 5 of them right off of the cookie sheet (oops). I am refrigerating the rest of the dough, hoping that it will firm up so it can be rolled out. Definitely a soft, cakelike puffy cookie. Definitely a keeper, but still looking for that perfect recipe...

I think that this recipe was just wasting my time. The recipe does puff up,and looks rather good, but the cookie itself tastes like nothing. It does not taste good, even with icing. Don't waste your time on this tasteless recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly, even baked them on parchment paper like it said. The flavor of the cookie was good, but as far as it puffing up, it did not! I don't know what bakery this cookie was in but it is not a good recipe. I want a recipe that my grandmother made, but unfortunitly it died with her. I was hoping this one was close to it, but it is no where close. These are the flattest cookies I ever baked! Had to put them on the cookie sheet with a miniture ice cream scoop cause you would have to add gobs of extra flour to ever roll these out! I expected a round cookie that was thick in the center and soft. This was a disapointment.

Wow. This uses alot of flour!  Be prepared to use half a bag, no kidding.  Overall it turns out to be really cakey and puffy and has a real nutmeg taste.  So, if you like them thin and crunchy this is not the one for you.  But, if you like them puffy and don't mind adding cup after cup of flour to work through the very sticky dough, try it. I will use less nutmeg next time.  A little spicy!

This is close to my Grandmas cookies. They puffed up beautifully. I added more vanilla than recipe called for. The only problem is they do not have much flavor. I will make again but tweak it. They were not as moist as I hoped. But I know they can be tweaked. But over all not bad.

The cookies puffed up exactly as promised, however they puffed up too much to hold their shape.  I ended up only adding 1 more cup of flour (5 total).  They tasted all right, but not like lofthouse cookies and they were missing something.  I couldn't taste the nutmeg at all.  I think more vanilla and substituting some butter for part of the shortening might make them better.

These cookies are average at best. The texture is great and they hold a shape for easy decoration however thats all they got going for them.  The flavor is not bad its just not good either.  For me they make a great way to serve frosting.

I followed the recipe and had no problems, and the cookies baked up soft, high, and tender.  I treated the dough more like pie crust and floured my board well; I turned the dough and dusted more flour until I could roll without sticking.  Even the re-rolled scraps were tender.  I used a tablespoon of vanilla because we love vanilla, and we frosted them with a simple butter-cream frosting tinted green for St. Patrick's Day.  If you're looking for crisp cookies with a sparkle of sugar on top, this is not it.  If you want a soft, cake-like cookie, here you are.   The vanilla and nutmeg compliment it well.  Nice recipe.

This is it!  The recipe I've been searching for!  I know everyone's taste in sugar cookies is different, but I love those soft Lofthouse sugar cookies, and wanted something like that I could make at home.  This is the one!  The one thing I noticed is they are easier to decorate when you cut them into smaller shapes.  I had a mix of bigger and smaller cookie cutters, and the cookies are so incredibly soft that the larger cookies were a bit hard to handle.  Delicious though!  And totally easy to make.  I sometimes think the simple approach is the best, as in this case.  I wish I had an excuse to make them again sometime soon!

Yummy and soft with a lot of flavor.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  Easy to mix and roll out.  Made them a generous 1/4" thick and they baked up soft on the inside and light golden brown on the outside.  I froze half the batch un-iced (cause it makes a TON), and one month later we thawed the frozen cut outs, iced them and they tasted just as good as they did last month.  Will make again.

I believe this recipe would be a good pizza dessert crust.Somewhere in this recipe it should  say refrigerated overnight,as it is too runny.It doesn't have the taste of a sugar cookie.

Fabulous! I used butter flavored shortening, just a pinch of nutmeg, and increased the amount of salt and vanilla. Quite Lovely!

I was looking for a recipe similar to the ones sold in cookie bouquets.  This comes closer than others I've tried.  It is a good recipe, but ever so slightly bland.  I made ghosts for halloween and sprinkled them with powdered sugar. They turned out really nice and so far, everyone eating them came back for more!  You will have to use a lot of flour to roll them out.  Just try to use as little as possible.  I rolled out just enough dough to do 2 or 3 (approx 3" diameter) cookies at a time.  The dough is so soft, you don't even have to use a rolling pin.  I let the kids pat them down with their hands and you couldn't tell the difference between the rolled and not rolled cookies!

I had a gallon of sour milk so I was looking for recipe options to use it up.  We stumbled on this one!  I am not normally a cookie eater but I made these and then froze them.  They taste just as good frozen as they did freshly made.

This is a classic, basic, sugar cookie recipe.  The taste is good - especially with a little extra vanilla & nutmeg, but if you don't chill the dough, they tend to loose a bit of their shape.

If I could rate higher than 5 stars, I would.  Every time I have made this recipe and brought it to work, people ask me for the recipe.  It's a winner every single time!  I use sour cream instead of sour milk and I really watch the flour I use.  Also, you MUST roll it out think enough (I'd recommend more than 1/4 inch, but a little less than 1/2 inch).  I have even halved this recipe because it makes TONS of cookies and I don't always have time to frost them all!  I used Betty Crocker's Whipped frosting and it comes out great!!

I baked these yesterday & today they are getting RAVE reviews from coworkers.  

I used more nutmeg & vanilla based on some users comments that they were bland.  I used butter flavored Crisco and refrigerated the dough for about an hour.  Rolled it out on my Pampered Chef pie mat & it was so easy.  I did have to remind myself to only roll it to 1/4 inch thick, as my usual recipes roll it thinner.

Great taste, great texture.  Thanks!

Didn't care too much for this recipe.  Not only was the dough extremely hard to work with (unless you have the time to freeze it first), but it tasted awful.  I'll stick with the Sugar Cookie recipe that came with my KitchenAid mixer.  Much much better!

This dough is sooooo sticky!  I live at 4,500 ft and in a desert so I rarely add all the flour required in a recipe.  I have now added an extra cup and a half to it and it still doesn't appear workable.  I was worried after reading the reviews, they were so varied in opinion.  I tried to roll it at first between two pieces of parchment and I can't get the parchment off, the dough just stuck equally to both pieces.  The consistancy is very close to the coffee cake, and old fashioned cakes I have made.  I was so frustrated by this that I signed on just to review it!  I haven't even baked them yet, but to be safe I made the sugar cookies from Betty Crocker before.  I will rely on those for my valentines day cookies and hope to make this recipe tolerable enough so that I don't waste so many ingredients and time.

Yumm!  I have always been hesitant to make sugar cookies because my husband loves my friend's cookies so much, I didn't want to compete.  I used this recipe to make Christmas cookies with my daughter and everyone loved them!   They were nice and fluffy and tasted great! I will definetly keep this recipe around.  Thanks!

They came out very well!  I didn't have a rolling pin or anything, so I just rolled them and cut them out with a coffee cup.  I used some orange icing, cinnamon chips, and milk chocolate chips to top them.  My roommate and husband both like them a lot!  It's an easy recipe to make, but the preparation took about 45 minutes to make the full batch.

Ok, I apologize for this rating but I cannot give these cookies a good review with a clear conscience. These cookies tasted like flour and BORING!!! I even used cinnamon like other reviews said but they were tasteless. I like to consider myself a very good baker...maybe I just need to try these again adding more flavor or something else.....

This is a great recipe. They turned out perfect- like store bought cookies, and I used the recipe for icing that contains milk, powdered sugar and light Karo syrup. These decorated beautifully for Santa. I didn't add the nutmeg, but I did add a little more sugar after reading some of the reviews. I thought that they tasted excellent.

I read a lot of reviews that complained about this recipe, but I liked it a lot. It was easy, and there was no chilling involved like other recipes I've used. I also thought the flavor was great, not plain and tasteless like other recipes.

I never take the time to review recipes, but this one was THAT GOOD!!!
It was not the easiest dough to roll out and even though the recipe did not call for it, I did chill the dough. Sill had to add additional flour. They puffed up perfectly, are very tasty, and are now my top choice for sugar cookies!

Very similar to my mom's recipe, but with nutmeg that gives these the needed holiday flavor. Don't know what the leavening did for the recipe.  They were a hit with the coworkers and my kid.

I had high hopes for this recipe when I read the review that compared them as similar to Lofthouse  Sugar Cookies.  I've been looking for a cookie recipe exactly like that.  I have to say that I'm disappointed in this recipe as a sugar cookie.  It tasted more like a muffin top, as it had a cake like density.  Not quite a cookie, really.  Although it was quite delicious, it wasn't what I was looking for.

The cookies puffed up beautifully and looked great, but like some of the other reviewer said, they tasted really -blah.  
My blah problem wasn't floury though.  I think I have some advice for that one, when the recipe says to add flour until you get the right consistency, start by adding only half a cup- or even a quarter, and add by quarter cups when you still need some.  You'll find that you probably won't end up using 2 cups, maybe even less than one.

This is a great recipe and it makes A TON of cookies! I make some buttercream frosting to put on top of them, but they're great without too. They're nice and soft, but not cakey, just right. This is by far the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever found and they are a huge hit every time I make them! My two year old niece told me they're "scrumtrulescent" the girls in my dorm beg me to make them all the time! Thanks for sharing!

I used this recipe last year for Christmas and the dough is a dream to work with.  The flavor from the nutmeg is more than adequate.  Those who commented about a lack of flavor must have had old nutmeg.  These have a beautiful texture, keep very well and improve upon aging a few hours.  A perfect sugar cookie recipe.

I love these cookies.  They are the closest I have found to the bakery style cookies.  They are soft and puffy and wonderful.  A lot of the reviewers complained about the flavor but I thought these had more flavor than most sugar cookies.  I baked the first batch for 10 min as suggested and they flattened out and turned gooey so I added a couple minutes to the next batch and they were perfect.

I loved the texture and appearance of these, but I'm not sure about the nutmeg.  My family just didn't go for it.  I think I would try these again but with less (or no) nutmeg and maybe some lemon peel or extract.  I didn't roll them out, instead I just used a cookie scoop to make about 1 inch balls and then pressed the tops with a glass dipped in sugar.  I will try the recipe again, just with less nutmeg.

This recipe did take time to mix, but it was well worth it!  I have never had a sugar cookie puff up like this one and it tastes great warm, cool, and/or decorated!  My husband has never liked my sugar cookies as they always went flat and crispy, but not this one; he loved it!  My kids can't wait to take them to school for their Halloween party!

I followed this recipe to a T, and I have to say  I wound up throwing them away.  They were easy to make and easy to bake, but the results weren't that great.

I made these for my son's preshool class.  My husband and I neither one liked them warm from the oven.  But, once we decorated them into yellow smiley faces (Confectioners sugar, water, lemon extract and food coloring) they were great.  Both of my boys loved them.  I really like the fact that they were soft and not crisp.  I have never been able to get any kind of cookie soft, so this was a first for me.  Thanks

I really liked this sugar cookie recipe because there is no need to chill the dough, which helps when children are impatient to get to the cookie cutting!  
The cookies really do puff up wonderfully and they  are almost cakelike and not too sweet -- really great for icing however you like.  Terrific!

Great tasting cookie!  The nutmeg gives this cookie a great new twist on the traditional sugar cookie.  It is fine to leave out if you are not a nutmeg fan as well.  I like the rise from these cookies and cover with royal icing as well.  A great recipe to use for home made "Black & Whites" as well.

This to me was a typical sugar cookie bland and boring, the recipe did not call for any where near the amount of flour I needed to even begin to roll these out for cut outs, I had to add 2 more cups for a total of 8 cups which would have made these VERY bland and tasteless (floury tasting), however being that I like a good spicy sugar cookie I added 2 tsp. ground cardamon, and double the nutmeg, I also added 1 tsp. almond extract as well as the vanilla. Turned out pretty good and average. Need to keep the rolled out dough to no less then 1/4" to have the nice fluffy thick cookie. Sorry will not make again, way to much flour!

These were really good sugar cookies. I left the dough in the fridge overnight since it was difficult to work with, and ended up just flattening them with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar. They didn't need any frosting as they were sweet enough on their own with just a little bit of sugar on top.

This recipe doesn't puff up. I made this recipe three times. The first time I follow it exactly, and it spread out. It was chewy, and had poor flavor. Then I went out and bought new flour, buttermilk, baking soda, and baking powder -- same result. On another attempt I added nearly two cups of additional flour. This time it did indeed puff up. However, the extra flour made the flavor too bread-like. I'm still searching for a recipe that will look and taste like the cookies sold at grocery store bakeries.

Awesome texture, no doubt.  But aren't cookies supposed to have flavor?  So puffy and light and perfect in form, yet without any kick whatsoever.  With this much flour one must balance it with additional sugar, spices, or liquid flavoring.  Something, anything to support the wonderful eye appeal so that you don't feel that you have been tricked with the first bite.

I was dissapointed with this recipe.  The cookies really did come out tasting like pancakes, and they were much harder to work with than your standard sugar cookie.  My batch puffed up way too much and I couldn't really do the decorative frosting that I had planned to.
