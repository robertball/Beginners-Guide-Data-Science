This was a hit with our youth group! I made it for a girl's 18th birthday and everyone loved it. I added one box of chocolate pudding mix to the cake mix and it made it extraordinarily moist. Also, make sure the filling is very cold before you put it on the cake or else it will spill over. I actually put mine in the freezer before putting the chocolate topping on it and it worked well.

Wonderful recipe.  I used the recipe for "Sandy's Chocolate Cake" which yields a three layer super moist chocolate cake and I used this recipe for the unique OREO filling inside.  I've used this combo a few times and had rave reviews.

This cake seriously needs to be submitted to that website for extravagantly bad-for-you-but-delicious-concoctions which shall remain nameless. It is, essentially, an entire no-bake cheesecake stuffed between 2 chocolate cakes, with half a box of Oreos in the middle, and the centers from a box of truffles on top. That's what it boils down to. My husband is so proud, he took a picture to share with all his friends. This is delicious! I used extra Oreos in the filling to make it prettier. I don't like the frosting from this recipe. It tastes good, it looks good, but this cake has to be stored in the fridge, and that stuff sets up *so* hard that cutting the cake revealed a huge-fault line down the middle of my cake.  Crrrack! The solution, of course, is to take the cake out of the fridge an hour or so before you plan to serve it, and the cream cheese will have stabilized the Cool Whip enough to do that, but still...I think next time I'd use "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" from this site instead. Thank you for a wonderful birthday cake for my husband! (P.S. I cut down on the sugar in the filling to 1/3 cup and could go to 1/4 cup as the Oreos themselves contribute quite a bit of sweetness, and I prefer a slightly more savory filling when it comes to cheesecake type filling!)

Yummers! This cake was great! It was different then your everyday cakes. The part that goes in the middle was like tasting heaven! And it was so simple to make. I loved it and will for sure make this again!

Good cake, simple to make.  Who doesn't love the combo of Oreos and cream cheese?  I used 1/2 as much butter and chocolate baking squares.  I spread some of the Oreo filling in the middle, and some on top of the finished cake.  I then drizzled edges of cake with melted chocolate and garnished with Oreo halves.

I have made this cake about half a dozen times. It is definitely one awesome cake. When I do make it I totally eliminate the sugar that's in the middle part -  I'm not big on sugar and don't like things to be super sweet, besides, there's plenty of sugar in the cookies. I still get rave reviews and people asking for the recipe. The one thing I would recommend is to put the ganache frosting on one layer of the cake while it's still on the rack AFTER it's cooled completely and BEFORE you put it on top of the cake over the creamy middle. *MAKE SURE THE FROSTING/GANACHE IS COMPLETELY COOLED BEFORE LIFTING IT TO PUT IT ON THE CAKE.* I have put it in the refrigerator - rack and all - to help harden and cool it. (You might want to put newspaper down to catch the chocolate drippings.) I have found this to work best because on a few different occasions I put the frosting on after assembling the cake and it tends to crack the top, making the top of the cake fall apart and look like a mess. Still tastes great, though and one you have to try!

I am a beginner when it comes to baking and I was thrilled with this cake!  It looked like I had slaved for hours and was very yummy too.  Who doesnt love Oreos?

I must admit that I didn't have a slice of this cake after baking it.  I took it to a potluck party and it was gone in 10 minutes, so I assume that everyone liked it (or at least liked how it looked).  I used the Wilton fanci-fill pan and filled the center with the Oreo filling (this recipe made the perfect amount for the filling, though if you want extra to decorate the top of the cake, then I suggest making an extra half of the filling recipe).  I iced the cake with chocolate ganache instead of using the chocolate icing part of this recipe.  As for the sugar, others commented on the sweetness of the filling so I only used a little over 1/3 cup of sugar and light cool whip and it tasted good to me.

This was a hit at a big gathering.  I used half the filling between layers and half on top to make it prettier.  I drizzled the chocolate over the top.  The filling was wonderful, but using a cake mix wasn't the best.  I will make this again using a from-scratch cake.

Made this over the weekend. After reading others reviews I went with the ever so moist cake doctor cake, used the filling from here and the milk chocolate glaze from the cake doctor. I also made half the filling with mint Oreos and the other half with Oreos, let the mix sit in the frig overnight and then put on the cake. Next time I will let it sit out a bit longer, it didn't spread very easily. Everyone is still talking about this cake.. It is now my favorite. Thinking for Christmas of making a red velvet and using the berry Oreos or the mint for the filling with a white chocolate glaze...
Update: made for a young lady who loves peanut butter and chocolate so used a pb pie filling... They inhaled it. It is very rich

This is, HANDS DOWN, the BEST cake you will ever make!  I am not a chocolate lover, but holy wow this is awesome.  The flavors blend together to create pure perfection.  Aside from all of that amazingness, it's incredibly easy to prepare and FUN for the kids help with!  I made this for my husband's birthday, who loves Oreos, and am making it again today for my Dad's birthday, who loves chocolate.  Can't go wrong!

This recipe is very good.......Can't justify giving it 5 stars though.  If I give a 5 star rating, then it has to be really really good:) I basically just made the middle part of this recipe, because I made brownie instead of cake (which I think was a great combination!).  The Oreo mix is really nice, but next time I would add more Oreo.

I frequently bake cakes, but since I don't really like to eat them I rarely even have a piece of any that I bake.  That being said, my 8 year old daughter wanted an oreo cake for her birthday, so I made this one (with only one change....I added a box of Jell-o instant pudding, cheesecake flavored, to the cake mix), anyway, everyone was raving about it.  So I tried some and Oh My Gosh!  They were right, it was great!!!  Will certainly make (and eat!) again!

I made this cake for a dinner party. Both adults and kids loved it! All the kids asked for seconds. I used two torte pans to make the cake. I made my own glaze with 1/4 cup butter, 2 TBLS. of light corn syrup, and 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips heated in the microwave for 1 minute and 15 seconds. I then stirred the mixture until blended. It was simple to make and looked so cool!

This recipe is so delicious! The combination of the cream cheese filling and chocolote cake were a match made in heaven!! I thought the glaze would over power the cake, but i was wrong. It added a welcoming texture and complimented the cake. My family loved it,so I am going to bake it again as a birthday cake for a oreo fanatic. I love that the cake itself has a great presentation and does look like a giant oreo!!!

Excellent recipe.  My sister in law made this on vacation for her daughter's birthday.  We had to go buy the ingredients again to make it a 2nd time that week.  The only thing we did different was we didn't like the "frosting", so we used canned chocolate frosting instead.  One of my favorites now.

Delicious, but messy. The cake was very moist with a light chocolate flavor, although I couldn't seem to make it look as good the other pictures. The filling was also light and delicious. Once I cut into it though, it seemed to fall apart a bit.

I needed to transport this to a family gathering, so made the cake in a 9 x 13 pan, used the filling as a topping and skipped the chocolate glaze. Got thumbs up from everyone.

I have made this 4 times now, and is limited to certain birthdays to keep it special.  Everyone that tries it loves it, and looks forward to the next one.  The only thing I do different is I smash the first 12 oreos completely, blend that  into the cheese, then add the cool whip and an additional  12  coarsely crushed oreos (this was done by accident the first time I made it). As I said, I keep this cake for very special occasions, however writing this make me think I won't be able to wait 2 months.  (lol   sshhhh don't tell)

Made it for my mans' birthday and it turned out amazing, everybody loved it! Very transportatable too, drove across Vancouver with it and we both made it without any scratches. I couldn't get myself to put Cool Whip in a cake frosting, so I just grabbed some liquid whipped cream and made my own with my kitchen aid in under five minutes.  So worth it! Will definitely make it again.

I made this cake twice in two days lol. The first one I made for my 12 year old nephews birthday.  I made it as a layer cake and took the Oreo filling (I added a pinch of salt and a splash of vanilla and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup) and filled my plastic lined cake pan and froze the layer. It was very easy to assemble the cake that way and then I frosted it with pastry pride (non-dairy whipped topping) and decorated it with a video game theme.   By having the filling frozen it was similar to an ice cream cake, Big hit at the party, so much so that there were no leftovers lol. Second time I really simplified it and made a sheet cake and used the Oreo filling  (same changes) as a frosting.  I know I'll be making this again, thanks for a great recipe!
I forgot to say I skipped the chocolate topping for this occasion, maybe next time

My son requested an Oreo cake for his birthday so I did an Internet search and found this recipe.  He was thrilled to have a cake that looked like an Oreo but even more thrilled that it was delicous.  Excellent recipe!

A Birthday cake...a success...let the chocolate glaze cool for longer then the time suggested so it doesn't drip down the sides of the cake

I made this cake for my daughter's fifth birthday party.  I was so happy with the results.  The cake looked and tasted great.  I especially liked the fact the the cake tasted like it was not made from crunched up oreos - it really had a more complex taste.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for my husband's birthday party and everyone LOVED it!  I thought it was going to be a heavy cake but I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't.  The only thing I did differently was use 1/3 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup.  I have a feeling I'll be making this cake over and over again!

I made this cake for my birthday, and my friends loved it! It's easy to make and tastes great! One thing I would change is to use less whipped cream and maybe a little more cream cheese. The center was just oozing out when we cut it. another solution would be to freeze the cake before cutting. Nevertheless, it was an amazing cake!

I made this twice. Once according to directions, once adding instant chocolate pudding to the cake mix. Both were good, but we thought the one with pudding was more moist and overall better. My family can't get too much chocolate!

I was skeptical it needed the chocolate on top but so glad I went with it. WOW! Just made this for my daughters birthday & now my son is requesting it for his birthday, too. It’s the 2nd best cake I’ve ever had. (My MIL’s Mississippi red velvet is #1)

Amazing. First cake I have made where everybody wanted to take some home with them after eating some that evening. Relatively easy and came out as it was supposed to look. Taste is exceptional and looks very cool. This will perhaps be my go to cake from now on!

Was a huge hit for Valentine's Day! I used a mix and just powdered sugar on top to simplify, but it tasted indulgent and was easy enough. Next time I'll use my food processor to crumble the Oreos finely so I can use a piping bag to put on the cream cheese mixture more evenly.

This was amazing- we have made it twice.  DOn't forget the cool whip has to be thawed, we forgot one time and it was a disaster! Kids, their friends and extended family love it.

Delicious filling, very pretty cake.    Looks impressive. Glaze isn't sweet. Kids may not like glaze. I followed others' suggestions to glaze top layer first and then add it to bottom half after it hardened. I also briefly froze the filling as others suggested. On the whole, this was a very good, easy cake that looked great. If I make it again, I might use a different glaze.

I used the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe from this site for the cake (use mini chocolate chips). And I used half the sugar to mix with the cream cheese as suggested by other reviewers. I put four extra Oreos on the top, and I drizzled the chocolate on the top instead of pouring it on. Great recipe, and my husband and three-year old son loved it.

This oreo cake filling is delicious! I used my own favourite recipe for dark chocolate cake from scratch and then followed this recipe for the filling. Like many others, I made chocolate icing for the top instead of the glaze listed here. I also put some oreo pieces on top for decoration. Mine didn't come out as pretty as the picture...but there's always round 2! Will definitely make this again. Thinking of making cupcakes next time and using this as a filling!

This is a pretty cake, and I made as written for a birthday. The kids did not finish eating it because it was not sweet enough and the store cake mix was bland without a sweeter frosting and filling.  Next time I will add more oreos to the filling and frost the entire cake with a chocolate frosting.  I am giving it a 4 star because it was pretty and it has potential with some tweeks.

Solid cake - the fun appearance trumps the flavor.  I might make again - it was very easy.  I recommend putting the filling in the fridge or freezer for a half hour before putting it on the cake base.  If you don't, I don't think it could support the top cake portion and it will just overflow and ooze out, ruining any cookie effect you might be going for.

Was a big hit! I did not add the sugar. Next time I will not add the chocolate topping, too messy to cut. I will try powdered sugar instead. Filling was very tasty!

This cake is very easy to make and everyone loves it.  Just a quick question.  Do you use the 16 oz. container of Cool Whip or do you measure the Cool Whip into a 2 cup measuring cup?

We made this for our daughter's 8th birthday party, and it was a big hit!  Our cakes - unfortunately - stuck to the new pans I bought to bake them in, so it wasn't a very pretty birthday cake, but everyone said it TASTED great anyway!

I made this cake for a church Christmas party and everyone loved it. One lady that didn't take a piece because she doesn't like chocolate told me she tried some of her husbands and loved it. She said that she didn't take any because  chocolate desserts are usually so sweet but this one wasn't. I followed the recipe except I added a large box of chocolate instant pudding to the cake mix. I couldn't  find the right size cake mix so I used the 11.25 size and it was just fine. I loved the brownie-type cake, the creamy filling and the chocolate glaze. I did let it sit out while we ate after it had set and it cut very nice.

HUGE hit with EVERYONE!!

I have made this well over 50 times.  My oldest son requests this EVERY year as his birthday cake.  My husband requested it this year.

I have taken it to many potlucks & there is NEVER any left.  I've been asked several times for the recipe.

Def a keeper.

Very tasty!  We added some chocolate chips to the cake batter, but other than that we followed the recipe to the tee.  A little difficult to cut (due to the hardened chocolate topping).

Great birthday cake for my son!   I made some modifications  1.   I used the cake mix recipe on the back of the Hershey's baking cocoa container.   It's so rich and moist, worth the extra effort.    2.   I used less sugar than recommended for the filling.   It called for 1/2 cup, I dumped about 1/8th out.  Next time I may just use 1/4 cup.   It was still plenty  sweet.  3.    I added extra Oreos. About 17 total.  4.   I added another cup of cool whip, to get rid of the cream cheese taste, it was perfect.      I think it tasted like a bakery cake!

The description is accurate: for two years, my younger two kids have wanted only this for a birthday cake.

Edit: I've lost count how many times I've made this cake. Every birthday since I first made it.

I made my cake 3 layers to make it even look fancier for my husband's birthday.  My entire family tries to eat pretty healthy, but no one resisted this cake.  There were only  6 of us and it was all gone the next day.  I'm sure I will be repeating this recipe again.  I did leave it in the refrigerator the entire time.  It made for a cool summer dessert.

This is by far one of the best cakes I have ever made.  It was even better if you let it sit in the fridge for a day or two before needing it (I had left overs and figured this out).  I will definitely be making it again in the future and most definitely for birthdays for years to come!

My daughter made this and it was excellent! We left off the chocolate topping because she thought it would be too much and just topped each piece with a dollop of whipped cream. It was fantastic and next time I'm adding the chocolate ganache on top!

I used fat free cream cheese and cool whip which seemed to make the filling runny. Might freeze the mixture next time in an attempt to keep it a little more solid.

The saying how this cake will turn to a Birthday tradition is so true. I asked my brother what kind of cake he wants for his Birthday and he said Oreo. Great for me because it's so easy to make and great too. Thanks so much for the recipe Love this site and the reviews too.

This cake was sure a hit.  You think this cake is going to be heavy, but it is not.  The filling is light and makes the cake delicious.  I am always looking for cakes that do not have frosting as my husband doesn't like it.  He loved this cake.

Easy - Tasty & Super Quick!!!  I was a little confused with the sugar - I was afraid white sugar would have a gritty consistency so I used 10X sugar & the Oreo filling was very creamy.

Made this as a request for my husbands birthday. It turned out very good! It was really thick with the 2 round cakes and the filling. Probably close to 12 inches high! Difficult to cut, but excellent to eat.

I used this more for the filling than the cake as a whole...but boy was it good!! I spread it between two devils food cakes and instead of the chcolate on top I covered the whole thing in buttercream to be able to decorate it for my son's birthday and it was a hit...much like the Oreo cake you can get @ Albertsons.

This cake was really easy and quick. I used a little less whipped topping. I also made my own glaze from the website for the topping other than that it is a keeper.

What a great cake! Being it's Christmas time, we used the candy cane oreos for the filling. We used store bought chocolate icing, and I piped a snowflake on top. Then we sprinkled some gorgeous silvery white and red sprinkles. This made a very attractive cake. To top it all off, everyone raved how good the cake was...made my day! Thanks so much for sharing:)

I have made this twice now. The first time was great, but was not too pretty. The second time was much better looking. It is now my boys' requested cake for birthdays. For my son's 18th I made the Oreo cake and also a Heath Bar cake. I made the cake in a 13x9 and let it cool completely and cut in half and put the mix minus the Oreo's and now with Heath Toffee Bits...my hubby LOVES the Oreo cake and says this is even better! Thanks so much for this recipe...it is the absolute best!!!

I ended up using two boxed brownie mixes and I didn't have any heavy cream so I didn't make the ganache, I just used chocolate icing.  It came out really good.....but very, very rich.  This would serve a lot of people because you only needed a small helping.  I will make sure I have all the ingredients next time and make it as written. yumm.

This was a huge hit at a birthday party (for adults!)  I couldn't keep the chocolate sauce from dropping down the sides, but it didn't matter--it still tasted great!

I made this for a party yesterday.  I used low fat oreos, low fat cream cheese and low fat cool whip.  It was easy to make and looked amazing!  Everyone commented on how great the cake looked and tasted!  I did crush up 4 more oreos and sprinkled them over the top of the cake while the frosting was still warm.  Great, easy recipe!

I used "Chocolate Zucchini Cake III" on this website to make the cake rather than a box mix.  I made two 7 inch round cakes (by halving the recipe)and then spread the filling between to make the "oreo," but there was so much that I ended up putting it on top also.  VERY yummy combo and this is coming from someone who is not a chocolate cake fan.

This is a very messy recipe, but soooo worth it. I covered the entire cake in dark chocolate and crumbled some Oreo's on top of it. It was a big hit my office!

When my boyfriend's son requested an oreo cake for his birthday this was an excellent rendition of a giant oreo and was AWESOME to eat as well!  The three of us managed to eat the entire cake in two days - it was that good!  I used a butter chocolate recipe for the cake mixes and also added four or five more crushed oreos as it didn't seem to have enough in the creamy middle.  Keep the cake refrigerated otherwise the creamy bit gets too soft and messy.  Definitely a keeper!

EXCELLENT!! Everyone raved about this cake, it was the perfect dessert to finish our July 4th celebration. The only difference that I did was not to use the frosting, I did make it but it was way too thin, so I used a can of frosting. Thanks so much for sharing.

Awesome.  Have made it twice already and plan to make it tomorrow again.  The frosting can be runny so canned icing is a good option.

Turned out great! I literally had people forming a line in my house waiting for me to finish frosting it cause it looked so good! I used milk chocolate (it's what I had on hand) and it seemed fine, though I'd like to try it with the semi-sweet that the recipe calls for.

Excellent recipe!  I'm a beginner when it comes to making desserts, but this was fairly simple and was really tasty.  It's quite rich though, so serve smaller portions than normal.

The stars are for the frosting.  I put this on a special chocolate cake of mine.  I use low fat cream cheese, low fat cool whip and I use 24 chocolate wafer cookies rather than oreos.  Oh my word... Everyone who tries it says it's the best ever.  I mean, they just about freak out it's so good.  :0) Thanks for the easy recipe!!

The reason I gave this 4 stars is because I made just the frosting and haven't tried the cake. The frosting, anyway, was delicious! The only thing is that it seems a little strange having something crunchy in an otherwise creamy frosting. But it was yummy!

This cake is easy to make and impressive to serve.  You just can't go wrong with a combination of oreos, cool whip, and cake!

I just was not wowed by this recipe, and I thought I would be...what's not to love, right??  It's a little dry for my taste.  I have tons of cake recipes and this one is just not a keeper for me.
