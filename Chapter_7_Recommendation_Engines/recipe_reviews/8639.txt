These wings were great.  I don't boil or refridgerate the sauce first.  I just mix the ingredients well, then pour it right on top of the wings.  No need to go through the extra steps, they turn out perfect without it.

This recipe was really good!  I added a good splash of cider vinegar and about 10 dashes of hot sauce to the marinade before boiling.  I also used chicken strips instead of wings.  The chicken cooked perfectly on a shorter schedule:  10 min., turn, 10 min., then 5 min. on a broiler pan.  Also, I made another half-batch of marinade (with 1 tablespoon cider vinegar and 5 dashes hot sauce) and stirred in 1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 3 tablespoons water while it boiled.  I served the extra sauce for dipping, and the next day, threw the leftovers together into one container.  It microwaved up just as good as the oven version!  The next time I do this, I plan to make rice and serve the chicken and sauce over it!

This is definitely TOO sweet!  I was so sure of this recipe, I mean, it has almost identical ingredients to dozens of other recipes I've tried, however, upon looking back at the ingredients, I noticed it was missing one key ingredient other similar recipes had: vinegar.  I think that is why this was too sweet, it was missing vinegar and hence, a 4 star rating instead of a 5.  I think because this recipe calls for 1 1/2 cups of honey, maybe 1/4-1/2 cup of vinegar should be right?  Anyhow, I added freshly grated ginger to the sauce to give it more of an asian flare.  The good thing about this sauce is that it did carmelized nicely on the wings.

Decided to take this a step further by adding balsamic vinegar to the marinade, cut the honey back to 3/4 of a cup and added garlic and onion powders. While my chicken was cooking, I placed the marinade into a sauce pan to reduce and become nice and thick. Once the chicken was almost done, I brushed the thickened sauce over the wing, added some sesame seeds and baked for another ten minutes. Kids and hubby flipped over this. Thanks Vickee!

Great wings... brought them to a Wing Contest and they went over very well.  One of the first wings to disappear.  I topped them with toasted sesame seeds and green onions.

Would have added a little cayenne and increased the baking temp after taking the foil off next time.

Absolutely loved these wings!  What a nice change from the same ol' hot wings.  I used extra garlic and did add some cayenne pepper and a pinch or two of crushed red pepper to add a little zip to the sweetness of the wings. I only wished I doubled the recipe because they went to fast! Thanx for a great recipe!  :-)

I didnt have any honey on hand but had a huge craving for "sticky chicken" so, I used corn syrup and also because of the mess my kids make with wings, I substitued drumsticks. The kids ignored the side dishes and went ga- ga over the chicken. We had -NO- left overs with this chicken!! Thanks Vickee!

Sorry! This recipe was almost the worst thing I have tasted.  The wings were way to sweet, and it needed more seasoning.  The soy sauce gave it a nasty after taste.  I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

We liked it. I changed the servings, because I had a 3 lb bag of wings. There were 4 of us (5th was a child who doesn't like chicken, so he doesn't count) and there were still not enough wings! I marinated 20 hrs. 

I would give it 5 stars, but there is a another recipe here I like better. (Japanese Chicken Wings)

Excellent. Mine turned out exactly like the photo on the recipe page. I did add a generous splash of white vinegar to the marinade and it was still very sweet (in a good way).  It was tender, fall off the bone dee-licious.  One warning:  WATCH them those last twenty minutes (during the dry bake) because the sugar will caramelize very quickly and you could end up with scorched chicken in the blink of an eye.  I was multi-tasking and almost ruined them by not paying attention at the end--now I know better for next time.  Otherwise my only complaint is that I wish I'd made more.  I do recommend the splash of vinegar.

These were good.  I added some fresh orange juice and some red pepper flakes to the marinade to give it some spice. I didn't bother taking them out of the marinade after an hour.  I just turned them and cooked for another 30 min.  Came out great.  Thanks!

Good, but with some changes! I approximated everything, but reduced the honey quite a bit, increased the garlic, and added apple cider vinegar and a little bit of tabasco. Cooking time varies too, so I'd check after a half hour, turn the chicken, and go from there.

Great marinade.  I used only 1 cup of honey as that's all I had and found it a good balance between the sweetness and the saltiness of the soy sauce.  I also added 2 teaspoons of minced ginger for some zing.  Was delicious with skinless chicken thighs.  Thanks!

These wings had a nice flavor and were definitely sticky.  A word of caution, really watch your pan when it's covered in foil in the oven, mine overflowed and made a nice sticky mess in the bottom of my oven.  Also, watch it near the end of the baking, as mine ended up burning along the sides.

Good starter recipe, but needs some changes to be 4 or 5 star. I added 1/2 tsp. of ground ginger and 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes. I would not make these again without adding the red pepper. I will add more next time. Also, I would recommend using really meaty wings, as my small-normal sized wings shrunk significantly and nearly dried out, even after reducing the baking time by 10 minutes. I served the wings on plain white rice and tossed some steamed broccoli in the remaining sauce for a tasty, Asian-inspired meal. Hubby enjoyed it as well.

Update:  Tried this recipe again with much better results.  I ran out of honey after about 1/4 c. so I used light corn syrup and a little maple syrup to make up the rest.  I added about 1 tsp. red pepper flakes and 1 tsp. cayenne pepper and a little extra garlic (2 BIG cloves).  I still could have done with more heat, but it was much more savory and less overpoweringly sweet (maybe the corn syrup was lighter).  Also, I shortened the uncovered bake time to 5 minutes before removing the wings to the heavily oiled rack.  I used the broiler instead of letting them cook for 10 minutes each side just to brown up the skin.  MUCH better result - no charring!  This time I reserved the sauce (checking with a candy thermometer to make sure it got up to 180 degrees) and poured it over white rice on the side.  VERY TASTY!  I may never need to go out for Chinese again.  As written, I still think this recipe gets 4 stars, but with my modifications, I would give it 5 all the way. OLD REVIEW:  Very good sweet flavor, but it needed a little kick.  I tried adding about a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes, but this was no where near enough to cut through the sweetness.  Next time I will try at least a tablespoon of the hot stuff.  They turned out very tender and were not very hard to make, but I thought the last cook time on the rack was a little too long.  Some of my wings got a little charred.  I would keep an eye on them during that last 10 minutes.

These were fantastic!!  I made a little extra sauce and spooned it over sticky rice from a rice cooker.  The flavor was very similar to a Japanese favorite of mine, Chicken Donburi! YUMMY!

I won't be making these again.  A lot of messing around with cooking for very little flavor reward.  I did add vinegar as suggested by others.  The flavor just wasn't there.

These were so good at my nephew's B-Day party my parents are asking me to make them again this weekend for my sister's graduation. I made with 3.5 lbs of chicken and forgot to put in frig night before, so they only marinated about 1 hours and 1/2. I also doubled the recipe. I didn't even get to try them. Might try the boneless on rice like someone else did for dinner one night.

These were awesome to say the least!!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into strips.  To the cooks who thought these were way too sweet, does the word "CANDIED" in the title tell you that just maybe they are going to be sweet??!

This was a really good recipe despite some of the negative reviews. Candied Wings..hello, it is going to be sweet. After reading the reviews I decided to double the sauce recipe but only used 1-1/2 cups of honey. After tasting it I did add the vinager, cayene and red pepper flakes. I also decided to put an asian twist on it so I added 1/4 cup of red curry paste and the sauce was great! It is 100 degrees today so I cooked sliced boneless-skinless breasts for 4 hours in the crock pot using 1/2 the sauce and reserving the other half to serve over chicken and jasmine rice. this is a great recipe and everyone can tweak it to their taste and sweetness. Thanks Vickee

These were AWESOME!! This is definately something that I will be making again! I doubled the recipe because I had 4 lbs. of wings, and I had a ton of marinade, so I will keep that in mind for next time. Also, I ran out of soy sauce, so I used a couple of tbls. of teryaki sauce. Turned out great! These wings were a hit with everyone! I served these with the cilantro fried rice recipe from this site (I put lots of veggies in it instead of chicken)Excellent dinner! EDIT- I just made these again last night, and was working from memory, and forgot that I was supposed to marinate the wings- I just baked them covered for 1 hour, but flipped them a few times, then I drained off alot of the sauce into a pan, brought it to a boil, added cornstarch to make a thick sauce to pour down over rice and the wings. I also broiled the wings for about 5 mins. to get a nice color and crunch! You never would have known that they were supposed to marinate! Also, I did add a few dashes of ground ginger and onion powder to the sauce for just a litte extra flavor...Awesome dinner again...this recipe will defiantely get use around my house!!

These are very good!  I used two extra cloves of garlic and a little hot sauce to strengthen it up.  For baked wings, these are as good as I've found.

Good & easy. Nice flavor. I did not find these to be too sweet, as some other reviewers did. Also, I liked that these were not "greasy" like some wing recipes tend to be. Could use a little more flavor - next time I'll use some extra spices/seasonings.

Two pounds of wings is not enough to necessitate the use of a 9 x 13 dish. Nor is it enough to require such a large amount of sauce. If I were to make this again, I'd either use 4 or 5 lbs. of wings or halve the sauce and cook it in a smaller dish. Also baking them on the rack charred them. Not cool. Won't be doing that again. On top of all this, they are merely mediocre in terms of flavor. Wish I loved these like so many others seem to. C'est la vie.

I always like to keep to the recipes on here - at least to rate, then I tweak if necessary.  Had to give a 3 as is...way too sweet but worked as a nice starting point.  I cut the honey back to 1 cup.  added rice vinegar (really helped to add tang and balance the sweetness), toasted sesame oil, crushed red pepper, cayenne, more garlic, and a couple of dashes of Mongolian Fire Oil.  Instead of cooking in the oven, I first grilled the wings which gave them an added smokiness.  I then marinaded them for a few hours and threw them in the oven about 45 min.  They turned out fantastic!  Took them to a party and everyone loved them!  Told me I have to call them Pamela's Ninja Wings.  Will customize and add to my recipe box.

I made this recipe exactly as written - and they were VERY good! The process of cooking these, is just fabulous, and the chicken fell right off the bone.  
With that being said, I was looking for a more GARLIC honey tasting wing (trying to replicate some from a restaurant), and these were mainly just honey flavored, so next time I will lesson the honey, up the garlic, and maybe add some red pepper flakes (or hot sauce).
But these were so good, my husband and I ate them all, and even my 1.5 year old twins ate some (of the chicken not the bone part)!
I suggest  you make them - then decide how you want to alter the seasonings for your own liking! 
Also, when baking these, they can be messy! When it said to bake them on a "rack" at the end, I put a metal cookie rack ON an aluminum foil covered cookie sheet, and baked them that way, no mess to clean up, and they came out SO crispy and amazing.  WILL make these again and again.
Thank you!

This was my first venture into wings. If I'd had any idea they would be this good, I would have made them ages ago! One word of wisdom, don't put them on the rack in the oven without greased foil under them. The sticky burnt mess was not fun to clean up.

these were pretty good.  They came out nice and tangy/sweet and sticky.  Upon reading others reviews, I added a couple tbs. of apple cider vinegar, a dash of srirachi and a little cayenne for some heat.  Next time I make this I will make it with chicken legs.  The sauce would be great on them!  I didnt make a full 2 lbs of wings so I had a lot of extra sauce!  It would be great over white rice!  These almost taste like the japanese wings that are on the site that I love.  Thanks for the recipe!

After trying it at a friend's house the same way, I had to make it at home.  I had a 4lb bag of wings, so I put them in a crockpot, doubled the ingredients, mix them and poured them on top of the chicken.  I cooked them for 6 hours and they came out fantastic.  I wasn't sure about not having kind of crispy skin, but it went over great.  even my husband who can't stand crockpot chicken loved these.  He took the leftovers to work with him. Easy, fast and makes a great dinner.  Thank you for this recipe!

Delicious! Turned out perfectly browned and falling off the bone. Perfect sticky sauce. For those who want some heat, try adding some cayanne pepper to taste. Recommend putting together the sauce and either halving it (1/2 into marinade, 1/2 saved for use later) or just skipping the marinade altogether because it comes out the same.

I started asking my family to rate recipes of a scale of 1 -5 stars and everyone said this was a 4 1/2 - 5 stars. My husband said 2 pounds wasn't enough and bought 4 pounds instead so I doubled the recipe. He was so right! There were only 3 wings left after my football party and I only ate a half of a wing because I was so full from simply cooking all day. Great recipe, everyone loved them!

As some reviews suggested, I cut back on the honey.  I also added extra garlic and some cayenne pepper.  My hard-to-please husband loved it!  I did too. This was quick & easy.  We enjoyed the extra sauce on white rice.  Next time, I'd probably double the sauce so we could use more on our rice.

We LOVED LOVED LOVED these! Super easy to make. I made two batches. The first batch I marinated overnight and added some hot sauce to cut through the honey. I followed to baking directions to a tee and they came out perfect. I added green onions and seasame seeds for looks. They were sweet but yummy. Next time I would add more hot sauce. The second bacth I marinated over night but not in the sauce. I seasoned them with creole spices. Then the next day I soaked the wings in the sauce for about 1 1/2 hrs. Then baked them. I liked these better because the creole spices were in the chicken more. Second bacth was better but both were amazing.

I didn't find these wings as good as  the other reviewers. I was hoping for something more flavorful and "stickier" since that was how the recipe was described. They were too putzy too: first you have to marinade for a period of time, then bake with foil, then turn, then without foil, then on a rack, turning again. They weren't worth all the effort.

Pretty good. I used four cloves of garlic, 1/2 honey & 1/2 maple syrup, and a teaspoon of Creole seasoning for a little heat. I'm sure I'll make these again.

It tastes great...I had to adjust some ingredients as I was preparing 3 lbs of chicken wings for New Year's...I didn't have more than 1/2 cup of honey...so followed other advice and used corn syrup to substitute...I sliced several cloves of garlic and then added some garlic powder and a little crushed pepper to the soy...it was tasty!

Very very good. I doubled the sauce for optimal stickyness. I also doubled the amount of garlic. The downside? My baking pan is totally destroyed.

I would not recommend it. It had the weirdest smell and taste.  Most of the time the recipes with a lot of stars are very good.  This one is not.

We made three different wings recipes from this site last night as a test run for the super bowl. GO COLTS!!  I must say that I thought these would be my least favorite - but they turned out to be the best!!!  I absolutely love them. Thank you for a great recipe!

Husband didnt like these at all and he is not picky. They had a subtle flavor and we like things that are more flavorful & the soy was a little overpowring PLUS I just made Japanese Chicken Wings which were AMAZING so comparing those to these, these are a little blah.

We loved this!  I boiled the ingredients first and added red pepper flakes.  This is similar to a recipes my mom made with Heniez 57 and honey.  This tastes a lot better!  Next time i want to grill this.

This was delicious!  I didn't have enough honey, so I used maple syrup as someone else suggested and I also added 1/2 cup of sugar because someone said it did not carmelize.  The sauce was amazing, great poured over rice or used for dunking the chicken.  Next time I'll try it with some deboned chicken thighs that my kids love (meatier than chicken wings).

excellent flavor!!  I cooked the sauce on the stove and then dunked some quick fried wings in it, baked in the oven for 20 minutes to finish the wings off and served.  Quite a hit at the party as an appetizer!!  THANKYOU!

I was really nervous about this one especially for as much soy as it called for.  I was gagging from the smell.  However, I took the suggestions of others about boiling remaining sauce and adding cornstarch and water mix to thicken it.  And the suggestion about putting the wings under the broiler.  The wings were a big hit...although very messy.  I was amazed at how good they smelled after they cooked. Even though they smelled good I still could stomach tasting them because of them being on a BONE.  Next time I will definately use some boneless chicken strips that way I can have some too.  I definately plan on making again.

These were very good.  The meat just fell off the bones.  The one thing I might add the next time around would be a little bit of cayenne pepper just to have a bit of spice to go with the sweet.

I like the fact that these wings are baked rather than fried. I doubled the recipe and used 5 lbs of chicken wings and served them as appetizers at a small get together. They went over really well. The recipe itself is really simple to make. The quickness part I had to give it a 4 & that is only because it does take a while to bake these. I would make these again for any party. In fact, I think you could make these ahead of time & then reheat them in the microwave and they would still be great.

I have made this a few times and love it. I went to Smith's to get chicken wings for the big game and they didn't have any. I decided to use chicken tenders. You don't get the great same stickiness. I definitely recommend using wings or even chicken legs. The stickiness comes from skin.

These were so good! The first time I made it exactly as the directions.  Next time - made a few adjustments - added fresh ginger and some balsamic vinegar and cut down on the honey and poured some sauce over chicken breasts - oh man.  It just keeps getting better and better.  Good recipe!

Easy tasty chicken wings! I tweaked it with cayenne, red pepper flakes and garlic pepper and black pepper. I also cut the honey down to 1 cup and opted for a 1/4 cup of corn syrup. My family loves chicken wings and these were palate pleasers.

I made exactly according to directions. I think it’s unfair to not follow the directions and instructions then rate it. These were ok. I was surprised these were not tastier. They looked great but didn’t seem to have much flavor as some others have said as well. I do think the cook time is too long for these. They would have been better had I cut 10 or even 20 minutes from the cook time. They were not falling off the bone juicy, dispite cooking in the juices. Maybe the rack portion of the cook time hurt them. I will eat all of them, but will not make again. I prefer my own go-to recipe of ½ cup orange marmalade + 2 tablespoons chili powder.

Very good I added sweet chili sauce and just marinated the wings for a few hours. I then used a rotisserie and didn't add anymore sauce. They were awesome!

I think the only reason I would give this 3 stars is because I changed the recipe. This is VERY sweet and tastes like you soaked the chicken in a bowl of honey. Which, well, is pretty much the case. We added crushed red pepper, shriracha pepper sauce, and garlic salt to counteract all the honey. Not sure I will making these again.

FABOLOUSLY, STICKY AND SWEET!!! Family enjoyed these tremendously.  I would prefer something with a crispier texture with the same stickyness perhaps a broil or fry before coating then putting in the oven?? Overall a great recipe.

I have been a wing fan for years, and these are absolutely my favorite! Satisfies the wing craving, and the sweet tooth! Sometimes I just microwave this sauce, let it cool a few minutes to thicken up and use it for dip with plain deep fried wings. Delicious either way!

These were awesome! I didn't measure much, prob used a little less honey, used about 4 TBS low sodium soy, 1 tsp minced garlic from jar, a little cider vinegar. brought to boil then poured over wings and put in fridge (prob for less than 2 hrs). Otherwise followed this recipe, and they were a hit with my whole family. I can't wait to make them again! Thanks for the recipe!

AMAZING!! These turned out SO yummy! I did exactly what the recipe said. I marinated them for about 4 hours. I popped them in the oven and when they came out they were such a beautiful color. We served them with Hooters wing sauce (hot) and they were perfect. The sweet goes good with the spicy! I will defiantly be making these again!

I really like this recipe but for some reason it seems to turn out different every time and I dont know why.  I also find it very time consuming because half way through there is a huge layer of fat in the pan and I take out all the wings drain the fat then put the chicken back in.  If I dont drain it it does not seem to carmalize.  Yummy, but tempermental.

I used this sauce for chicken legs (found a good sale) and doctored it a bit. For those who like it simple, this is a good start. I did add a bit of fresh chopped ginger, some green onion and a little sesame oil. We ate them with Sesame Noodles and it was inhaled.

This recipe is pretty good but I definitely had to make some changes to the sauce, it was WAY too sweet! I added more soy, apple cider vinegar, and crushed red pepper to try and mellow down the sweetness and it came out pretty good! Next time I won't be using the full amount of honey

These have potential to be 5 stars, but not without some tweaks.  I added the splash of vinegar that many reviewers suggested, but I still think the flavor was lacking--it was a little bland to me.  The sticky and the sweet factor is spot on, and the cooking process was perfect, but something was missing.  Maybe more soy sauce and waaaay more garlic, some fresh grated ginger and a drop or two of Sesame oil would do the trick.  Not sure....

The taste was okay on these, but was not garlicky at all. By the time they were done cooking, I could sort of taste something salty (soy sauce's contribution) and something sweet. Don't think I'd try these again.

This was is an excellent recipe. I was surfing all recipes and said to myself, "what can I make with chicken wings" and then I came across this recipe. I took some advice from some of reviews, omitted the soysauce alltogether, added a half cup of honey, some hot sauce and cider vinegar along with the cloves of garlic and after cooked, I decided to add some potato starch to thicken the liquid. I think they came out excellent! The hot sauce balances out the sweetness and is more than enough sweet. 1 cup is just way too much. I think I improved the recipe completely :) First mix with cider, add salt and seasoning, add the garlic and some olive oil and let cook on both sides until blood shows on top, then turn to the other side. Add a half cup of honey and about 10 dabs of hotsauce and mix until evened out. Add the starch after the wings are cooked well browned on both sides and let thicken. I added a table spoon and mixed in. Perfect. Enjoy!

I made this recipe last night and my husband is a very very picky eater but absolutely loved these...  I took suggestions from a few folks.  Used half the honey, added a dash of vinegar and seasoned the chicken prior to baking...  Once done, looked just like the picture and where fall off the bone :) Will definitely make these again...  Thanks for the great recipe.

I rated it a 4 only because I made some modifications to get it to a 5. I tried it first with no alterations and it was ok but a little too sweet with nothing to balance it so the next time around I added 4 to 6 tablespoons of vinegar (basically added it to taste) and 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of Cayenne and I was very happy with the results. I have made it three times now. Its a great recipe and easily modified to different taste if you added different spices to the basic honey / vinegar / garlic combo.

I was skeptical because of the long cooking time, but these were SO tender!  The sauce was great.  I didn't have as much honey as I thought I did, so I had to use 1/2 honey and 1/2 molasses. I also used and would recommend low-sodium soy sauce. It was really good that way.  My family raved over these! Thanks so much!

Absolutely amazing! I followed cooking directions exactly and the chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender. The taste was spectacular and I wish I had made more! I added toasted seasame seeds just before I served them, it was a hit and I will definitly make them again.

Excellent, but only 1/4 cup of honey is plenty.  I also added hot sauce and a dash of cider vinegar per another review. I seasoned the wings with garlic salt and cayenne pepper, baked them at 400 degrees, then poured the sauce over the wings and baked them about 10 minutes more on 350.  I used low sodium soy sauce.

My husband liked the chicken. I sliced and baked some red potatoes and put the sauce over it.  My daughter liked the potatoes better.  I took people's advice and added some vinegar (apple cider vinegar). I think it would have been better if I left it out.  I will make this again but this time I will make it a little spicy. Good recipe.

We found this to be somewhat lacking in taste, which was surprising. Next time I will consider adding more soy sauce.

The sauce for these was excellent. Out of the 3 different kind of wings that were made (these, hot, and bbq) these were voted the best. I keep trying to think of different things to use the sauce for. Thanks.

very yummy and a nice change from buffalo wings.  i bet this marinade would also be great on ribs!  i followed the recipe exactly except for adding extra garlic.  i also saved the sauce after placing the wings on a rack, added 1 tbsp cornstarch and heated for 5 minutes (boil).  it was great over the rice!  the only reason i didnt give five stars is because it was a little sweet.  otherwise, very very good!

I thought these were mediocre. I only marinated mine about 2 hours, perhaps they would have had more flavor if I marinated them longer? I even added some red pepper flakes and extra garlic. They were pretty easy though and appealing to the eye after I followed suggestions of adding seasame seeds and green onion to them when they were finished.

really taste good and genuine for a chicken with plain rice served together!! I tried this recipe yesternight with my family and we enjoyed the dinner. I am a mother of two kids ages 5 and 3 years respectively....with this treat so sweet, i want to prepare it again but next time i will surely add a bit of chili on it for a nice treat. Thanks for the recipe.

This was by far the best wing recipe I have come across!  As a college student living a dorm, I'm always looking for easy and delicious recipes with few ingredients, and this one fit the bill.  I marinated the wings for a full 24 hours, and the meat turned out very moist and flavorful.

I tried this recipe because I wanted some braised chicken from Chinese restaurant. It came pretty close.  It was great. I added 4 small dried Szchechuan peppers to give it some heat. My family loved it. There was no leftovers. I will be making this instead of going out.

I added a bit of hot sauce to spice it up and instead of placing them on a rack/grill after draining the sauce, I just put them back in the oven uncovered for about 20 minutes. While they were in the oven, I brushed them w/ some apricot preserves and this added a wonderful flavor. We will definitely make these again.

I didn't have honey in the house, but I had wings to cook. I used brown sugar (50:50 w/ soy sauce) and added sliced onions to the marande and followed the rest. They were great! This cooking process is simple and tasty. The brown marandate helped added to the golden brown of the cooked wings. I will try the original recipe after a trip to the store to buy honey!

I love this recipe.  I didn't have enough honey so I substituted with Log Cabin Syrup and I added a lot more garlic.  My 7 year old loved them!

This recipe is similar to what I used for my homemade rotisserie chicken recipe except that I add rotisserie seasoning to the marinade. Didn't have clover honey which I personally think it blends better with soy sauce. Taste was a bit strong due to the tupelo honey I used. I also took another reviewer's advice and added ginger to the marinade. Overall, this is a great recipe. Next time, I will try the recipe again but as is.  No ginger and def no tupelo honey.

This recipe was very easy to make and turned out very tasty! I didn't alter the recipe at all, and after tasting it I'd do it the same way each time. When the wings were removed from the sauce and going through their last round of baking I brought the extra sauce to a boil and added a bit of corstarch & water to thicken it up - we used this as an extra dipping sauce. Definitely worth trying!

these were great; my hubby loved them.  I added 1 extra garlic clove and 1 tsp. of Tunisian chili powder for some zip.  I also added a splash of vinegar to the sauce and grated zest from 1 small orange.  Marinated for several hours.  If the recipe is followed regarding the baking process, they are sticky and very nice.  I didn't find them too sweet but maybe because of the vinegar splash added.  Very tender and good flavor!  I liked the fact that I didn't have to fry them and splatter the stove.

Rated this a 4 because the sauce would be good to try on chicken, pork or ribs.  Won't make the wings again because we really liked the Japanese Chicken Wings that were made also.

I marinated the chicken for only 6 hours... still turned out great.  I also increased the temp. to 400 once I removed the foil cover.  Delicious!

Delicious.  I added 1/4 c. maple syrup which enhanced the flavor.
I plan to serve often. Very easy and they look wonderful.

I loved this recipe. I cut back a little bit on the honey for health reasons and on the soy sauce to balance it out. Only mildly sticky, but still delicious

Was Ok, I had to remove chicken wings from pan and throw them on the grill for a few minutes, since they became much to soft and then had to thickened the sauce with a bit  of corn starch, so the sauce would adhere to th chicken wings.

These were delicious! I added some sesame oil and some vinegar to the mixture. I think I will add some cayenne next time for a bit of heat. They were sticky and sweet and didn't last for long! The marinade would be really good on short ribs or with some salmon too.

I enjoyed the wings and the other reviews were right, You need to add Vinigar. I also sesoned the chicken wings with Jane's Original Mixed up salt and ground black peper before I marinated the chicken over night!! Great treat next time I will use other parts of the chiken like legs or breast so that there is more meet.

I think the boiling of the sauce was for AFTER cooking the chicken and IF you were going to pour it over rice.  You don't want to cross contaminate because it's been with the chicken

It's good in a different way. My husband and daughter thought they were a bit to sweet, and I would have to agree. Maybe a little less honey next time.

Tasty marinade. I seasoned and baked my wings first to make them crispy. Then I put the sauce on top. I should have reduced to til it was thick and gooey though. Still, very tasty. Husband enjoyed this.

Amazing wings. I marinated for about 8 hours, and added a splash of sesame oil and a pinch of freshly grated ginger. Next time I will marinade for 24 hours for full flavour. Great recipe.

These wings were excellent! I did follow the suggestion from another review to add vinegar, I included 1/2 cup white vinegar and left the rest of the recipie as is. They turned out great! Exactly what I was looking for in a sweet wing. The sauce was nice and thick and sticky. Thanks for the great recipie! I will be making the again and again.

This was delicious! I made minor changes to the ingredients to suit my taste (I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of 2 and added some red pepper flakes), but other than that I made it exactly as directed.  Loved them! Sweet (but not too sweet), sticky, yummy goodness. I don't like super spicy wings, and I never like anything too sweet - this was just perfect for me!

My family loved this dish including my sister family who I forwarded the recipe via email. We follow recipe as stated however I did add crushed red pepper for a mixture of sweet and spicy taste. Also since I did not have enough honey I used some maple flavor syrup also(lite). A great taste. It came out just like the photo.

I made this sauce yesterday to put over wings for the "superbowl supper"...it was awesome!  I however did not bake them, I deep fried the wings until crisp, place them in a tupperware bowl with some sauce, lidded it and shook it to coat them well.  It was great!  The only thing I would do next time is not boil the sauce...for coating wings, it was a bit thin and I had to let it cool in the fridge to get it to thicken back up a bit!  I will just mix it well in advance to get the flavors to combine.  But the taste was AWESOME!  Thanks!

I love chicken wings and normally bake them with varies spices and then add hot sauce.  Needed something different and this was it.  Marinated mine before baking just to see how it turned out.  Found it equally as delicious, and much faster, to bake first until crisp and then add sauce to wings.  My husband likes to fry his wings so this works better for him also.

I added vinegar like others posted and it was still way to sweet. Pouring a bottle of any store bought honey BBQ sauce over the chicken would be better then this recipe.

I had high hopes for this with review modifications and used 1 c honey, 1/4 c vinegar and an extra clove of garlic, but the sauce did not absorb well. So I improvised and added a shallot, 1 tbsp cayenne, and saved the sauce after putting the wings on the grill, added some cornstarch, and dipped the wings in the mix. The chicken ended up overcooked because I messed with it so much but the sauce was fab. Will make again the same way and add cornstarch to the sauce before marinating.

Very tasty, kids and picky husband loved them. Super easy to make, these would be great as a party food also.  Remember to put something to catch drips when you put them on the rack.

Chicken wings turn out great but make sure to cook as directed for the extra crispness.  I rated it 4 stars, as I felt it was still lacking a little something, otherwise great!

This recipe was very good, but like many others, I also made a few changes.  First, I too cooked the wings for a much shorter amount of time.  I baked the marinated wings for 1/2 hour in the oven and then another 1/2 in a toaster oven.  They came out delicious!  Finally, I also added sesame seeds and green onion to garnish, which really made it tasty.

Turned out well but needed a lot more garlic, and I also added a generous pinch of chili powder. If I were to make them again, I would cut back on the honey a little bit. Thanks.

Really yummy, and hard to mess up!  I've made these twice... the first time, I made 4lbs of chicken wings and doubled the recipe for my friend's surprise birthday party, and they were a hit.  There were none left at the end of the night.  The second tme, I made them at  home for dinner with boneless chicken tenders... also yummy!  They were great for dinner, and leftovers tasted pretty yummy too.

Well I didnt get to try these.  I made them as a pre cooked meal for while I was out of town.  I dont have a pic either.  However my mom and the kids loved them.  They were easy and I had all the ingredients on hand.  I will be making them again.  Thanks.

this was a great recipe. I changed it up a little. I didnt do the last step of cooking it on a rack. I just baked them covered and they turned out just as good. For leftovers tomorrow I plan on thickening up the sauce. It wasnt thick enough for a gravy. But overall, the chicken had a wonderful flavor. Thanks for a great recipe!

I agree with other person here, long drawn out process for mediocre wings.  They were not bad, just not great either.  Missing an ingredient maybe?  Spice it up?  Make it sweeter?  Not sure.

We LOVED this! So easy to prepare, and the taste was just terrific - when my husband walked in the door he actually said "It smells lovely in here!" My son and husband both devoured these, though next time I will probably use this sauce on boneless skinless chicken breasts as my hubby says wings are too much work! :) The only thing I did differntly was I used 3.7lbs of wings and made 1 1/2 times the recipe for sauce. I had PLENTY. The wings were almost covered in the 9x13 baking dish I used (which worked well I thought). I did marinate them for a few hours before baking, but didn't cover them during baking. I baked 30 minutes, flipped them over, baked 30 more, flipped and baked 10, flipped and baked 10 more. They came out GREAT!! We weren't looking for crispy skin, so I tried it that way instead of risking over cooking or scorching them. We served this with white rice with a little of the sauce and broccoli. Next time I will put the sauce in a pan and thicken it with some corn starch to have a nice thick sauce for dipping and for the rice. Yummy!

This was a long drawn out process that I did not think was really worth the effort. I was expecting them to be a lot more candied. They had a good overall flavor but, they definitely need some heat added to them.

Delightful!  I made 1/2 of the sauce and it was just great. There was lots of juice in the pan when I baked them. I marinated for about 3 hours and baked them at 375. They were tender and not too sweet. Make sure you do the last step and bake them out of the juice as they  finish up nice. This will become at the top of my wing recipes. Thank you.

So simple yet so good. My 12 year old daughter prepared these as a Halloween dinner. She called them 'bat wings'. We left the wings intact, cooked them uncovered, and basted occasionally, perfect. Thanks for the recipe, we'll be making these again.

This was a pretty tasty change of pace. I cut the recipe in half since I only had a pound of wings. I didn't bother with the marinating because I didn't have time. I also didn't use the stove to heat up the honey/soy mixture; I just stuck the mixture in the microwave for 30 seconds. Heating the mixture is definitely needed, since it mixes together much better that way. I cooked the wings covered for 30 minutes, then uncovered them and turned them over. I put them back in the oven (uncovered) for another 20-25 minutes. Then I took them out, turned them over again, and put them back in for about another 15 minutes. Even though I skipped the wire rack step, they turned out great.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong or not, but the sauce was so burnt it was inedible and I even took them out of the the oven 7 minutes before they were supposed to be done! I followed the recipe to the letter, the only thing I did differently was to use a 11x7 pan instead of 9x13 since I only had 6 wings. When I went to remove the wings from the sauce, the pan was dangerously close to boiling over and I narrowly diverted a smoke alarm disaster. The sauce was actually kind of good on a small section of a wing (where it didn't burn) and the chicken itself wasn't burnt, but still, I will not be trying this one again.

Instead of wings I used drumsticks. The chicken came out perfect. I didn't have minced garlic so I used garlic salt and powder - I just threw in a few pinches of each for flavor. I also marinated them for about 3.5 hrs instead of overnight and the flavor was still delicious.

This is one of our family's favorites! I use thighs and legs. Also, I skip cooking it over the stove and bake them till the sauce is thick. Yum

I used this marinade on chiken thighs and it turned out great! I put slices in the meat so the marinade would permeate better and let it sit in a ziploc bag for 24 hours. Delicious!

I gave this recipe only 4 stars because it's a pain to make. The taste is wonderful and everyone raved about it but it makes a complete mess. I might make this again but I'll REALLY have to be in the mood for them and have a lot of patience that day.

My family thought this recipe was ok. The wings didn't come out "sticky" like the recipe said it would. We didn't think they had much flavor. Probably won't make again.

Well....I don't know what got into me to use chicken breasts instead of wings but it was all I had at the time. The sauce was delicious - I didn't think it too sweet at all; I even added a little ground ginger. But sadly, the chicken was super dry and almost burnt from putting it on the rack - we had to get pizza! So...if I ever buy wings, I will give this another shot!

Very Good Wings.  I was hesitant about using an extra rack for the latter stage of roasting, but the result was great.  It seems to get rid of some extra fat too.  
I had a lot of sauce left.  I freeze them and use it for some garlic ribs at a later date --- you don't have to do that!  I found I need to add a bit more soya sauce for this.

This was delicious,  I used 6 chicken thighs,  I added two tablespoons of ketchup some hot sauce & a tablespoon or two of rice vinegar. I seasoned the chicken with salt pepper, Adobe, cayenne & Cajun... I was looking for a sweet & spicy taste. I didn’t boil it before hand I let it cook In the sauce for an hour Turing at 1/2 hour just like the  recipe says and it basically braised the chicken. Extremely moist & to get the thick sauce to pour over I scooped some out at the end of cooking the chicken boiled it .  Roast or sautéed pianapple till it browns go great with it.

4 stars because I changed the portions so I cannot say with certainty that this recipe is 5 stars. HOWEVER, these came out delicious! I used 4 wings, 1/4 c of raw honey, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 2 garlic cloves and sprinkled a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder (maybe 1/2 tsp total) on the chicken before adding the marinade. I didn't boil the marinade. After an hr, I simply uncovered the chicken and stood it up so that most of it was out of the marinade and cooked for 10 mins more. Then the sauce really began to thicken and made the wings nice and sticky, even with my extreme reduction of honey! So easy, I marinated it overnight and cooked it in the morning while getting ready for work!

I added some apple cider vinegar as per several other reviews, more garlic, a bit of some Weber garlic/herb grill spices, and thickened the sauce with a little corn starch at the end.  Very good, and not too sweet.

I've been making this recipe for years now. It really does taste better when you allow the chicken to marinate in the sauce for a few hours. Usually I make these as a last minute idea so I rarely do the marinating step. So on the first day the chicken is still good but not amazing. But the leftovers that I save till the next day, they get some extra time marinating in the sauce, and are simply divine now that they are really "candied"!!

I will. Make these again and again. I looked at other reviews and decided to use 1 cup of honey instead and they tasted perfect. Having them bake for a while on a rack made them restaurant quality!  Love these!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made these today for dinner. Oh my were they good. I marinated them for close to 3 hours in the refrigerator. I flipped them before I placed them in my smoker. The smoker made them full of flavor and complemented the marinade. I used pecan and hickory wood chips and smoked the wings at 250 for 2 hours.  My kids said that this recipe belongs in their favorites book. Thanks for the recipe!

Next time I make it, I'm going to cut down the Honey, add more Garlic and from reading the other reviews, try adding some cider vinegar and cayenne pepper.

I've made this several times. It is so good. Sometimes I like to make it spicy, so I'll add some cayenne pepper to it.

I just used the sauce from this recipe and applied it to some deep fried wings.  For those who don't like their food too spicy, this takes the cake.

I agreed with other reviewers and added some cider vinegar to the sauce.   Used 8 chicken thighs and doubled the sauce mixture.  As the chicken was baking, I boiled the extra sauce with a small amount of corn starch to thicken.  Served over rice and was a great hit!!  This was very sticky, so have lots of napkins available ( or you can lick your fingers liked the kids did ).   Thanks for sharing, vickee.

Good, just not a family favorite.
