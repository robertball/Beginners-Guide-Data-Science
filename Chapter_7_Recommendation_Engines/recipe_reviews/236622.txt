What a wonderfully easy recipe.  I did change it up a bit by cutting back on the onion (hubby doesn't like too much) and adding one red and one green bell pepper cut up.  I threw these peppers into the flour as well.  I also swapped out the sugar for 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I served it over brown rice.   I would definitely make this again.

This recipe was good for inspiration but poor for execution. I totally ad-libbed this recipe like I do with most. Instead of following this recipe as-is I took bits of it and changed the proportions and followed Budget Bytes sesame chicken recipe, sans the corn starch and vegetable oil. And I recommend these main changes for (1lb of  beef)

-Increase the portion of vinegar to 3 tablespoons
-Sugar 1/4 cup or 3 tablespoons (best to go with your preference)
-1/2cup of ketchup (for thickening)
1/2 an onion thinly sliced (I mixed in green onions as well)
Then include the other ingredients for the sauce in the budget bytes recipe but no need for sesame seeds.

Basically I may have created a new recipe but it turned out great and I'll give credit where it is due. If any doubts in the sauce taste it before you slather your meat in it, it should have a tangy taste. Best Wishes!

I was really hopeful about this recipe--it provided a promising way to use up a chuck steak I had on hand and I like all of the ingredients.  However, the ratios are way off and it fell far short of my expectations.  It was far too...vinegary (is that a word?). As for me, I won't be making it again.

I was trying to find something to do with a bunch of steak that I bought on sale and had the ingredients for this on hand. I won't be making it again. I thought it was very bland and the corners of the casserole were burnt when I checked it at 2 hours. I think it needed to be sweeterr. We ate it over rice and put soy sauce on it, but that didn't really help.

This was super tasty!  Since there are only 2 of us I only used 1 lb of beef, but left the sauce measurements the same so there would be plenty.  It was delicious.  I would cut back a little on ketchup next time to reduce the sweetness and onions but only because I'm not overly fond of them :)  We will definitely make again.

Had to cut the onions amount in half because my guys are not supper crazy for them.  But it was a hit.  Cleaned their plates.

Reviews submitted were not too encouraging.. I would ,most likely, free lance  or other wise adjust/ augment the ingredients. to subvert the perceived short comings outlined by my fellow cooks.

My family wasn't overly impressed with this recipe, it was okay.  The long cook time kind of sucks up all the sauce and your left with this really thick kind of clunky sauce.  Taste is good, but don't think I'll make it again.

This was easy to make.  I used only 2 lbs of stew beef and 2 onions, but I kept the sauce measurements the same.  I wasn't a huge fan of the gooey flour on the beef.  Maybe if the beef was browned in a skillet before baking, it would be better. However, I don't think I will make it again. It wasn't bad, but I would rather eat something else.  My husband, who isn't very picky, did not like this. He said it's edible, but not good.  He gave it 2 stars.
