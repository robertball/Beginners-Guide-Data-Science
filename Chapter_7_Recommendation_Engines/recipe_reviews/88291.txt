I gave this chili 3 stars because I like the concept of it. I like the chicken and corn and it makes a very hearty chili. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars, though, is because it is EXTREMELY spicy. My husband and I had to add 2 or 3 dollops of sour cream to our bowls because it was just too much. I think the tbsp. of pepper is a mis-print, because my mom said in all her 50 years of cooking, she has never seen a recipe that calls for that much pepper! Next time I make this I will SIGNIFICANTLY reduce the amount of pepper and probably the chili powder as well.

I've never made chili before, and this recipe turned out great. I'm not a fan of beans so I omitted them.  And to replace the bean liquid, I put a can of chicken broth in instead.  To replace the beans, I just put in more potato and chicken.  I also added a tsp. garlic salt, a tsp. of paprika, and a little more chili powder. It's got quite a kick and tastes great with corn bread.

This was good but like other reviewers I thought it was extremely hot when I taste tested it so I added a can of tomato sauce & a can of chicken broth (then it wasn't hot enough, so I didn't win). I also poached/boiled my chicken instead of frying it to cut that fat from the veg. oil. All in all it was good but need improvement.

Based on another review, I cut the chili powder to 1 1/2 tablespoons and only used 1 teaspoon of pepper. Additionally, I added some curry powder, a bit of brown sugar, and more corn. It was very good.

Nice chili! I cut the recipe in half but still used 2 tablespoons of chili powder, since I like it so much.  I also eyeballed the black pepper since I read that this recipe called for too much. I used dark kidney beans and added a garlic clove, and also used low-sodium vegetable broth (again, eyeballed it) instead of the liquid from the beans to cut down on the sodium. Other than those changes, I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out fantastic and I would recommend this recipe for anyone who wants chicken chili but not "white chili."

I wanted to try something diferent for our annual chili party.  This recipe was perfect.  It was different enough but still "chili" enough.  I did add a 15oz can of tomato sauce because it looked a bit dry; I was concerned the potatoes might not cook fully.  The spice was just right!  If I cut the chili powder, I think my 2 year old would love it.

I needed to use up 1 lb of ground turkey, 1/2 can vegetarian refried beans, and 1/2 can sliced jalapeno peppers from a previous nacho dish (also from allrecipes, also awesome), so I substituted the ground turkey for the chicken, sauteed it in olive oil with an onion, and otherwise followed the recipe (halved), adding the refried beans and sliced jalapenos during the 25 minute simmer when the potatoes were cooking. My thirteen year-old, who doesn't like to try anything new, loved it. My hubby thought it was delicious. New chile recipe! I also cut down on the pepper.

I am not usually a fan of chicken chili but this recipe is great with a few changes.  1 tablespoon of pepper must be a misprint.  Reduce to 1 teaspoon or less.   It also needs more liquid in my opinion.   I added several cups of chicken broth.  With the reduced pepper and added chicken broth it was excellent.

Turned out great.  Cooked chicken first in large cast iron pot, drained chicken grease (optional).  Then added everything all at once. Didnâ€™t need to cook onions first.  Reduced to 1 teaspoon of pepper and 2 tablespoons of chili powder since I had kids, but 3 may have been fine.  Added one tablespoon of garlic and one tablespoon of curry ( or cumin).  Serve over rice (optional).  Sweet potatoes would work great too.  Finally, I did drain and rinse the beans so I added 4 cups of vegetable stock.

Way too much pepper! Needed something else to give something other than pepper flavor.
