I was excited to try this recipe out, as I've been wanting different chicken recipes.  I was hesitant about the honey and mustard, but figured it must be an amazing flavors since most have liked it.  I was wrong.  It was ok.  If you don't really like a sweetness to your dinner, then definitely skip this one.  I agree with another reviewer about the nice mix of chicken/rice/beans/veggies, but just didn't like the honey mustard sauce.  Perhaps I'll keep the filling, but change the sauce to something different.

EXCELLENT DISH AND SOO EASY. I did make 4 minor changes: (1) used whole wheat tortillas (2) baked as burritos, not as a casserole, (3) instead of mixing the sour cream/honey/mustard mix in dish I drizzled it in the middle of the burrito b4 I rolled it and then also on top of the burrito, and (4) added a little salsa to the top of the burritos. I only used about 1/4 - 1/3 of the honey/mustard/sour cream mixture .... i think the dish would have been WAY too sweet using the entire mixture. The recipe really is awesome, easy and healthy!!

I made this recipe ( doubled) for my son's football broadcast team at his high school for our grand opening.It was a huge hit with teenagers and parents alike. I was asked for the recipe as well! Great choice for that type of crowd and easy to prepare! I am a no frills type of cook so this was perfect for me. Make it and they will come!

I absolutely loved the flavors in this one. I think that the yellow rice is going to be essential, and I'm really glad that I found it- it wouldn't be the same with white or brown rice since it has the seasonings already there. I followed the recipe exactly since it was my first time making it, and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I did use large burrito-size tortillas, and I could have gotten away with just two on bottom and two on top. Although very good as is, I think that next time I will do these in actual burrito form rather than a casserole and maybe up the rice by another 1/2 cup. Thanks for a unique, lighter twist on burritos!

My husband and I really enjoyed my version of this recipe. I am gluten intolerant so I used Ezequiel brand tortillas. I substituted brown rice for the yellow,  Agave syrup for honey.  I didn't have green peppers or garbanzo beans so I just doubled the red peppers and black beans. What a treat this was! I might try a little hot sauce in the honey mixture next time to give it some zip.

I had high hopes becuase of all the rave reviews but I did not like the flavor of this at all. The mustard taste was way too strong. Good combination of beans and veggies though.

I had some turkey left from making AR's Make Ahead Turkey Gravy, so I substituted it for the chicken.  Also had some 6" flour tortillas that needed to be used, so that size worked well for me in this casserole (still used 8).  I'll admit I was concerned that the honey would make this too sweet and really thought the mustard sounded a little strange.  However, it all ended up tasting pretty good.

I was very skeptical of this honey mustard burrito thing.  However, it was really tasty!  I used ground turkey & added red onion to the pepper/bean combo.  I also used pepperjack instead of the mozzarella & added tobasco to the honey mustard to give it a kick.  I added spices to the meat also, because I was afraid it would be bland.  Oh, and I just made some extra honey mustard sauce to drizzle over the top instead of just honey.  So good!

I was wildly surprised at how much we all liked this dish in our family.  Everything I used was left overs from the previous week...did not have left over green peppers so I used our left over shredded zucchini and it was a hit.

not bad. realized i didn't have honey so i threw in brown sugar and it tasted great. if anything, i'll come away with a nice tasting "honey" mustard sauce : ) anyway, dish was pretty dry; not sure yet what i will do next time to fix. more sauce? more cheese?

BUT my 1 year old liked it and that makes points with me. overall mild taste, chunky bits and can't go wrong with cheese. will make again but with more modifications. UPDATE: double the sauce and chicken- that's the secret. Added mushrooms and tomatoes. Is now my favorite dinner!

This is a fantastic recipe that I made twice in a row because I was craving it so much!  Definitely needs to be served with salsa, but otherwise is perfect!  I made with hominy instead of corn once - delish!

I was really excited to try this recipe and it didn't disappoint!  It was delicious.  I put about 2 cups of the yellow rice and about 2.5 cups of shredded chicken so it sort of dried it out a little.  Next time I'll stick to the recipe or actually roll them up as burritos.  We topped it with sour cream and homemade salsa and it was YUMMY!  I will definitely be making this again.

good. a little dry. doubled the recipe and it made 15 burritos.  Because others said they didn't use all the sauce because it would make it to sweet.   I did 3/4 of the sauce.

So much good here. And some tweaks to make it my kind of yum.
Half the mustard.
Half the honey.
Pintos instead of garbanzos.
1/2 tsp to 1 tsp cumin, stirred into the bean mixture.
Optional: finely dice and saute the peppers .(I diced them fine and then sauteed them, because a family member doesn't enjoy the flavor or texture of under-cooked  or large dice peppers.) 
Reserve 1 cup of bean mixture, not merely 1/2 cup.
A thin layer of 2 TBS sour cream on the top layer of shells. And then the cheese for the top, followed by the 1 cup of reserved bean mixture topping that.
Butter the pan, rather than spray it.
Bake, covered, for 1 hr at 275-F.

This was good but definitely has a "different" flavor.  I was really in the mood for mexican food and, while I liked this dish, it didn't satisfy my Mexican food craving at all.  I pretty much followed as is but left out the garbanzo beans

I used healthier tortillas (flax, etc.) but it was still quite good.  I like all the beans in the recipe.  Healthy and tasty.  Great mustard/honey sauce!  Will make again!

We are big Mexican food fans, and this is a totally new taste for our menu. We loved the sweetness of the honey and the bell peppers. Yummy!! I made lots of extra for the freezer.

I use a lot of chicken in my cooking and was really looking forward to a new recipe. Unfortunately no one in my family liked this. I just didn't like the sauce and the mozzarella was just "weird"...should have used jack instead.

This was AMAZING! I made it for dinner last night, just had leftovers for lunch, and can't wait to have leftovers again tonight! The blend really is great with the different ingredients. I will defintely be making this a lot more in the future.

I followed this recipe exactly.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it!  Not too sweet at all!  It was a little dry, but I think that is becasue I baked it for 45 minutes.  I will definitely be making this again, and try baking for 30 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was good but a little too sweet for me. Next time I think I will add some green chiles and scale back on the honey. I will definitely make again.

I truly enjoyed the flavors of this dish! I put all the cheese in the mixture and realized I was only supposed to use half, but I love cheese, so I just added an additional 1/2 cup to the top. Still... the dish didn't quite "stick" together like I thought it should. I am going to make this again in the burrito style suggested by other reviewers, making extra sauce to pour over the top. This is a dish begging to take liberties with! The filling is awesome!

Really good!  I rarely make enchiladas because my young kids won't eat it.  This was a nice twist that even my picky eaters loved.  I served it with avocado slices and hot sauce for my husband & I.  The only thing I did different was to double the sauce.  When I mixed the sauce with the chicken/veggie mixture it just seemed dry.  Luckily it's quick & easy to whip up more.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

Made this tonight and came out great!! I did make a few changes. I didn't have garbanzo beans so I used northern white beans since that is what I had on hand. I thought I opened a can of regular corn, but by accident I grabbed cream corn, so I added the whole can. I also added a dab of lemon juice. I made the whole mix and mixed the honey sauce in the crock pot and cooked it on low for 2 hours. We just warned up the tortillas and added the mix. I ate it just like that but my husband added some salsa to his. Will most def make again

Delicions!  Thanks for the recipe.  I made the following minor changes:  wanted a vegetarian dish so omitted chicken and used 1 15oz can of black beans and 1 15oz can of garbanzo beans; 1 whole diced red pepper, 1 whole diced green pepper; 1 small onion, 1 diced tomato.  Instead of placing the whole tortillas in the baking dish I tore them into strips then layered them.

Absolutely fabulous! The taste was surperb and a pleasant change from the usual Mexican casserole. I only had to make a few changes based on ingredients I had on hand. I used quinoa, as another reviewer mentioned, because I had some that needed to be used up. I ran out of yellow mustard so have of the mustard was Dijon. I also ran out of regular honey so used some key lime honey we had. None of the changes really altered  the texture or flavor much from the original. Definitely a keeper. Tasted even better the next day. The family loved it and went back for seconds. Thanks for the wonderfull recipe!

Just made this last night for my family.  We routinely eat tex-mex style foods, and I was so excited to see a twist on one!  It was so easy to make, the taste was wonderful, and we will be eating leftovers tonight.  Since we eat vegetarian in our home, we substituted Boca Veggie Crumbles (fake-meat) for the chicken.  We also added extra cheeses, which always makes everything delicious.  I look forward to eating this again!  Thanks!

I thought this was a great recipe, something a little different.  I just made more of the sauce, because it didn't seem "saucy" enough for me! I love the Garbanzo and black beans!  I just used a whole green peeper, and no red- it was less expensive to make that way. Same taste, I think! Yum!

This was really good.  I used whole wheat tortillas, and brown rice to get some whole grains in there.  I added half of a jalapeno pepper and a half cup of onion.  The sauce seemed a little sweet for my taste so I just added a bit more mustard-turned out great.  I needed to bake it a little longer than indicated.  Really enjoyed this!

I made this recipe exactly as stated tonight and I have to admit I'm a little disappointed. I love honey mustard dressing, but I really don't care for the yellow mustard in the dish. It was too over powering for my taste,  but without it the dish is nearly tasteless. I don't think I'll make it again.

It is an interesting recipe but I don't think I will make it again. I did leave out the peppers because I really don't like them. And I used the tortillas you have to cook at home before using because they are thinner and not as doughy. Also I used 6 tortillas instead of 8 because that seemed like way to much dough. Other than that I followed the recipe. Not a bad flavor but a little sweet for us.

This recipe was great. My husband and I loved it. I followed the recipe except I did not make a casserole I used spinach wraps and made burritos instead. For reheating purposes I figured making burritos was better so I wouldn't have to reheat the whole casserole for two people. Also since I am a vegetarian I used the Morning Star veggie chicken and brown rice instead of yellow rice. The  brown rice was excellent seasoned with a little turmeric and curry for the yellow rice look. I was also a little skeptic of the honey and mustard sauce but all the flavors blended together amazingly. I also mixed together a little more sauce to ensure the bean mixture was not dry. So I used 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of spicy brown mustard and half cup of honey. I served the burritos with black bean and corn salsa. So yummy I can't wait for the leftovers.

I made this last week and followed the instructions exactly. It turned out perfectly. I'm not a huge fan of garbanzo beans but they were surprisingly pleasant in balancing out the sweetness in this dish. I thought the black beans might "muddy" the color of the food, but that didn't happen. I drained the beans really well. It also surprised me later when I took leftovers to work. I figured the tortillas would be soggy but they didn't turn out that way, even in the microwave. This is not a spicy dish. I think it would be good for children. Spicy salsa on top, after cooking, would be a nice way to add some heat. Also, the time it takes to make the rice is equal to the prep time with the other ingredients. Start cooking the yellow rice first and by the time it is done you should be ready to mix it in and bake.

Loved it! Even my very picky 7 year old who rarely likes anything that isn't pasta related and won't touch vegetables other than "crunchy" carrots inhaled 2 servings of it before telling me this goes on his list of favorites. Lots of flavor. The tortillas on the top turn out a little hard, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful flavor, so I still have to give it 5 stars. Will make again and again!

Our family LOVED this dish.  Sweet with spicy, can't be beat.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.   We accidentially left out the cumin, but it was great anyways.  Will definitely serve again!
