They shortbread cookies were absolutely amazing!  I bake all the time and have not made cookies that are so easy and taste this good in a while.  Great recipe!

I loved this recipe, they taste and look great! I didn't change a thing. I rolled the dough into little logs and then pressed them out on cookie sheet with a fork so they had a design. I let them cool and then dipped one end in chocolate and nuts, sprinkles and coconut. Thanks for the recipe, I will make these again for sure!

I started making this recipe for Christmas and I have to say - it's amazing! The dough turns out very buttery and melts in your mouth! I didn't change a thing on the recipe for the actual cookie. However, I dripped them into melted white chocolate with pink food coloring for Valentine's Day - wow! I actually prefer the white chocolate taste to the semi-sweet. This recipe can be used so many different ways. My family has already requested these cookies two times since Christmas ... It's a great recipe and a huge hit at my house!!

These are great. I made them some time ago and didn't realize I had gotten the recipe from on here. For the chocolate I used vegetable oil instead of shortening, until I got the desired dipping consistency. And, I had to microwave the chocolate for 1 minute stirring after 30 seconds. Once melted I made some walnut, almond, and plain chocolate and set them on parchment paper to harden. The cookies are buttery and practically melt in the mouth. Yum!

Followed the recipe, used the 'fork method' as one other reviewer suggested and they turned out awesome. Taste delicious! Hope my cookie exchange party goers will love them as well!! Thank you!

These are really yummy, even without the chocolate in my opinion, though the chocolate definitely adds a nice touch.  Definitely a tad time consuming, but I had fun making different shapes.  The ingredients are things I always have on hand, so I'll definitely be keeping this recipe around!

Let me tell you--- INCREDIBLE shortbread cookies! The kids and I had a blast decorating them up with white and dark chocolate, colored sugars, and 4 different kinds of nuts, to include in our Italian Cookie Boxes for Christmas gifts --right along with all the authentic Italian cookies we make every year. They got rave reviews and ALL 25 BOXES sent returned to me a phone call that requested your recipe!! Perfezione assoluta!! Ottimo lavoro!! Thank you!

I used the basic shortbread recipe; did not dip them this time (I may do so for the next batch). The basic recipe is delicious, very tender and true to the "shortbread" taste we are looking for at Christmas. This is a very versatile recipe; you could decorate them in a number of ways. Delicious.

Very easy and very tasty!  I used the chocolate melting wafers instead of semisweet chips/shortening.  Look great on my Christmas cookie trays!

These were very good, and even easir to make. Instead of dipping one side in chocolate, i just lined them up, and drizzled on top. Topped half with chopped walnuts, and half with sprinkles. Both were equally as good. One thing though, if you don't dunk, you won't need nearly as much melted chocolate, i had a TON left over.

You can't find an easier recipe than this one! I just made these for the first time and it definitely won't be the last. The only thing I changed was using butter instead of shortening with the chocolate. I melted the chocolate in a glass bowl in the microwave and then set it over a pot of simmering water to keep the chocolate melted. (only use 2 inches of water in the pot. Don't let it touch the bottom of the bowl.) I drizzled the left over chocolate over pretzels. Yum!

These cookes are amazing!  I did modify the look of the cookie though. Instead of logs I made mine round with apricot jam in the middle and white chocolate drizzle on top.  Everyone complimented on how good they tasted!

These were ok. I thought they lacked in flavor. For the effort involved, I was hoping for  bigger flavor. I have another shortbread recipe that I think I will stick to.

Love this cookie!  I only gave it a 4 because I didn't use walnuts due to allergies, but I'm sure it's still a 5 :-))  Easy, and delicious!

Super easy shortbread.  Not overly sweet, which is what I wanted.  Wonderful butter taste!  I was pressed for time so I just lined up all the cookies and flung the chocolate on top.. um, I mean, I drizzled it carefully, ha!  Looked as good as they tasted!

Really buttery shortbread! Try different ways of putting chocolate on them. My favorite was drizzling chocolate over the top. It was lovely.

I actually used a cookie cutter with these and made hearts for Valentine's Day (I submitted a photo). The dough is too crumbly to roll, so I just flattened it with my hand and cut out the hearts. They turned out beautifully, and were absolutely delicious. I will be looking for excuses to make these more often - I could eat them all day.

Just made these and they are good but I feel like it may be too much confectioner's sugar for my taste and not buttery enough. Not a bad cookie at all just not what I was expecting from a shortbread.

They were time consuming but delicious and pretty.  I dipped only one end in the chocolate (also used oil instead of shortening) and then dipped them in various colored sprinkles and sugars.  They are fragile though so be careful with dipping to not break too many.  I am hoping that they freeze well.

OMG!  I made this for a cookie party and they were so beautiful everyone thought I cheated and bought them at a bakery.  I made them with the "fork method" and they looked like pretty little shells dipped in chocolate and sprinkles.  I can't wait to make more!

Simple, tasty, and they look really impressive! I dipped some into white chocolate and sprinkled with crushed candy cane, and some into milk chocolate. A lot of "bang" for such an easy recipe!

Love this recipe! This will be my go-to recipe any time I need to bake cookies for an event. They are so quick to make, almost fool-proof and it is easy to make them look pretty. I ended up with 30 delicious cookies.

Awesome texture! Super easy to make and yields a crispy, melt-in-your-mouth, buttery cookie. I only bake for the holidays and I've been getting lots of compliments on them.

Cookie dough was so simple!  Very good tasting.  They are fragile, so look out when dipping.  I did add 1/2 tsp.salt, otherwise it was unchanged.

These are so delicious!! They literally melt in your mouth when you eat them.  I make them, along with a bunch of others, to give out in little Christmas tins.  These are definitely my favorite in the bunch, and I get lots of praise on them! Recipe is perfect as is.

Simply put- YUM.  Time consuming but worth it!  My only issue was that all of my 'logs' turned out into a shape more resembling a puddle, and were very thin around the edges.  I believe I may have worked the dough while it was too warm.  I might chill the dough for 30 minutes or so before working with it next time.  So-5 stars from me, seeing as my issue was most likey user error. ;)

These were my favorite to make out of any of my christmas cookies this year. The only change I made to the ingredients was I added 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Instead of rolling the cookies out into "logs" I decided to try and press the dough into santa and snowman candy molds I had and they came out BEAUTIFUL. If you are going to try this, I suggest you lightly flour the mold or else the dough won't come out in one piece.   I also baked them for about 13-15 minutes instead, dipped them half in chocolate, and sprinkled with nonpareils.

Awesome cookie.  My daughter and I had a great time cutting out shapes, making logs and then dipping the cookies.    Would suggest dipping first about half the cookies, then using the left overs to drizzle the shapes, using a spoon.  Time consuming but then, it's a labor of love and well worth the time I spend with my family.  Did I mention the awesome cookie at the end?

This is definitely a 5 star recipe..and the only one I use for shortbreads. It's quick and it's easy..and you can dip them and they look great!... add the nuts to it if you want or simply leave them out..takes minutes to make, and such a crowd pleaser!!..

Nice easy tasty recipe. I made these last Christmas and they were so good I have been looking through the recipes so I could make them again. Praise the Lord I found them. My pastor enjoyed them so I think I will be making them for him and his wife again this year.

This is a good, basic dough...especially for Christmas cookies.  The dough can be flavored/shaped/dipped in so many ways for different cookie variations. Adding a little cornstarch keeps the cookies nice and tender.

I made this for one of the choices in our 2012 Christmas Cookie Exchange.  Love the taste of shortbread, and this recipe did not disappoint.   I chose to dip the ends and add sprinkles rather than the walnuts.

These are very tender and "short" with a nice hint of maple flavor.  They are so "short" that it was difficult to keep the cookies from breaking when dipping in the chocolate.  The next time I will thin the chocolate a little more.  Be careful when taking them off the cookie sheet as well.  Delicious!

These were fun to make and looked quite pretty when finished.  We drizzled melted chocolate over some and dipped the others, then pressed the chocolately side into coconut flakes, crumbled peppermints, or crushed pecans.  Warn kids to be careful -- the cookies break if you press too hard.  The flavor of the cookie was not my favorite, but they worked out fine.
