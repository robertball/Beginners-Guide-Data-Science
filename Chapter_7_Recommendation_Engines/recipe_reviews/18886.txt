Delicious recipe for dinner or picnics.  If you don't want to add the pickles, add a 1/4 cup of vinegar and increase the onions to half a cup instead.

This is my favorite bbq bean recipe with a few changes. We don't eat pork so I made some modifications. I used vegetarian bbq beans instead of pork-n-beans. I did the vinegar substitute for the pickles (thanks for the suggestion!). I also added 1 cup of onions and 1 cup of green peppers and sauteed them first, and used turkey sausage instead of the ground beef, sautee-ing it with the onions/green peppers. I increased the bbq sauce to 1 cup and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Took it to a picnic and got rave reviews!

great recipe, but not clearly written.  Fortunately, my version of it turned out okay.

Very, very good.  I used only 1 lb of ground turkey and a whole medium onion.  I made this about 4 hours before a party started and set the slow cooker on low.  Everyone liked it!  This will be a staple for our cookouts in the future.

I thought these were tasty.  Made with out the meat and used vegetarian beans instead of pork n beans.  Double it up and I am happy with the ease and taste.

This was really good!  Just let it simmer on the stove top to let everything heat/blend.  Took the lid off for a few minutes to let it thicken up a little more.  Used honey baked beans and honey barbeque sauce (we love honey!).  Tasted even better with a little cheddar mixed in.  Enjoy!

I had intended on halving this recipe for the two of us to have as a main dish for lunch but discovered I had a 28 ounce can of baked beans.  Therefore I only put 3/4 pound of ground beef in it but followed the recipe other than that.  I happened to pick up Hot bbq sauce so it had a bit of a kick and we ate it like chili with cheese and onions on top.  Husband loved it.  Thanks!

I got rave reviews but I made a few changes. I only used 1 pound of ground beef and cooked it with green peppers and onion. I didn't have dill pickles so I used 1/4 cup of sweet relish and 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar. I also used 1 cup of bbq sauce instead of 2/3 cup. Cooked it in the slow cooker for 4 hours on low. Topped it with shredder cheddar cheese. Delicious!

This is a great recipe, everyone loved it.  I hate to review using substitutes BUT I used Sweet Italian Turkey Sausage in place of the meat.
I prepped and refrigerated it the day before and then cooked it up in my crock pot - on low - for 4 hours. Perfect to serve with Chef John's Baked BBQ Baby Back Ribs.

This was a 5-Star with a really nice flavor, tang. They were meaty and savory. The barbecue sauce used was Jim Bean Bourban. I will definitely make these again.

This recipe~~very simple, but to me, it was okay, there is room for adjustments, while the kids totally liked it, hubby said it was fine(which means~~just okay). I was on the fence because even though it was hearty and thick, for I felt the sweetness over-powered the loads of meat. Either reduce the ground beef & let the beans shine OR add savory seasonings to cut the sweetness & let the meat shine. I'd have to play around with the recipe to customize the flavor combination if I make again. Thanks though.
