Unbelievably good!  The combination of sweet and salty can't be beat.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I had already made up my mind to make these, sorta, when I found this recipe.  I had just tried a "Blarney Stone" from a bakery and decided it was too good to not try to make ... I used a vanilla box cake (and it was GOOD and who could tell with all the yummies on top?) and I made my homemade cream cheese frosting (for you people who thought the frosting w/this recipe was too sweet).  Im glad I looked up this recipe because I never did take into account how I was going to actually execute the frosting part, but obviously freezing the cake, already cut, did the trick.  Thanks to the reviewer who suggested freezing in sections... I froze mine separated w/pieces of waxed paper and after frosting the first few I realized that even taking out two at a time was too much ... the easiest way was to take out one at a time from the freezer (they really thaw out quickly and the frosting/rolling part took some time).  Anyway, the result was absolutely GREAT, these Blarney Stones are worth the trouble!!!  The end result was far from "flavorless" and the icing was far from "too sweet."

Mmmm . . . very good!  Suggestion:  When you freeze these, freeze in 3 batches, taking one at a time out of the freezer to frost and coat with nuts.  I froze them all together and took them all out of the freezer at once, and by the time I was about a third of the way through frosting them the remainder had thawed which made frosting them VERY difficult.  Also, I had about a cup too much of the nuts - you can probably cut the amount of nuts down.  The "second phase" of recipe is very time consuming and messy, but the result is YUMMY.  Be sure to frost/coat with nuts near the sink and have paper towels handy as you'll need to rinse and wipe your fingers frequently!

These were really good. I took them to a party today and everyone raved and wanted the recipe.
One note: I only put 4 cups of peanuts in the food processer and I probably could have gone with 3 or less. There were A LOT of peanuts left over. Next time I'll start by processing 2 cups and then do more if I need them.

I love this recipe!  My Grandma, and Mom always used to make these for St. Patrick's Day, and now so do I.  I bake the cake the exact same way, however, the frosting ingredients on this recipe seem a little too "sugary" for my taste.  Instead I melt 1cup butter a splash of vanilla, and gradually add powdered sugar until it gets to the consistancy I can spread.  I also put a little green food coloring in there, the kids love it!  I make frosting as I go so I'm not left with a lot of extra.  Freezing the cake is solely to make frosting easier, I don't freeze mine.  I hold each square with a fork in the bottom and frost sides and top, it works just as easy!!

These were fun to make on St. Pat's Day but not very good to eat.  We won't be making them again.  They are very sweet, even with lots of salty peanuts coating them.  The recipe states that it takes one hour to make; however, it fails to include in that time, that the cake has to freeze overnight before frosting.  Frosting them can be messy.  We found that it was much easier to stab the bottom of each piece with a fork and to hold the folk while frosting the pieces and rolling them in the peanuts.  Since the pieces looked like they would be messy to eat, we cut each square in half.  That made it much easier to frost and eat.

I really hate to give a recipe a bad rating, but this was not at all what I expected.  First, the icing is extremely difficult to work with.  It also makes too much.  6 cups of nuts is also too much.  I ended up with lots of little chopped peanuts left over and nothing to do with them.  The stones themselves are just barely ok.  The icing is almost pure sugar and is the predominant flavor.  The cake is basically flavorless.  It was a lot of time and effort to ice and nut them, and after all of that, all you can taste is the icing and nuts.  I was really disappointed.

This recipe was good, but the leftovers were not.  I took them to a party and people enjoyed them, but by the next day the leftovers were soggy and messy.  Also, I had A LOT of peanuts and frosting left over, if you're trying this one chop the nuts and mix the frosting as you go.  They tasted all right but I don't think I'll make them again.

I made this for St. Patrick's day and everyone took one bite and threw the rest away.  It was BEYOND sweet.  It was also a real pain to assemble and the frosting was very messy.  Maybe I wasn't doing it right...

These the the best blarney stones we have had in years!  The recipe is simple and just like we remember them when we had them 30 years ago in Montana. We didn't have enough salted peanuts for six cups, so we used some unsalted peanuts and mixed them with the salted. We will make the again for sure...and that's no blarney!

These taste good, but they're a lot of work for something that most people look at and say..."what are those" and carefully pick up, smell, take a bite and throw the rest away.  Not worth the time.

This recipe was good but not as good as a local bakery here...I'm still working on perfection. Once the flavors are perfect these literally melt in your mouth.

Great recipe. I made these for a St Patricks day party. Huge success and the next day they were just a good. The combination of salty sweet was great and the cake itself was terrific. No bad reviews here.

I would rename this to Payday Cake. Tastes just like a Payday candy car. 

The idea of icing these was daunting... so try this variation: 

Do not cut them into squares; place the whole pan into the freezer for a few hours (overnight is not necessary). Pour the icing across the top like a sheet cake. Then add a layer of nuts and cut like a cake. You only need about 2 cups of nuts in this variation. 6 cups is insane anyway. Enjoy your Payday! :)

If you cannot handle this recipe, turn in your apron and step away from the kitchen!  They are delicious and are great as leftovers when re-heated on low!

My great grandma made this for us as kids. We looked forward to them at every family reunion. We did use store bought angelfood cake though, and it is just as good.

Wow I am very impressed with this dessert. It is hard to believe something so simple can taste so good. I went completely with the recipe. After trying it you can have fun with different ingredients but it tastes just fine how it is. It is nice with a cold glass of milk. My husband is in love with this recipe. It is a little messy kind of like rice krispie treats are BUT very easy to clean up! Thank you for this recipe I quite enjoyed it!
