I have made this several times, the recipe is good but what is great is the Gluten Free Pasta by Barilla. I have Celiac and this is the ONLY pasta I have found that is edible and doesn't fall apart. The price is good also. Check there page for other recipes.

I really enjoyed this.
Very simple to make.
I didn't have peas, so I substituted asparagus tops

This is definitely a keeper.  I sauteed nitrate free pancetta until crisp and then removed. In the rendered fat, sauteed the onions, mushrooms and two cloves of garlic.  Added the remainder of the ingredients as written.  Just delicious!

A quick easy and tasty meal to make.I substituted Nush dairy-free yoghurt which blended well and I  then garnished the dish with spinach and grated Violife vegan cheese as I'm gluten and dairy intolerant.
It was very tasty.

Fast, easy and delicious. I added some pancetta for some extra flavor. The pasta is fantastic with a great taste and texture. Thank you for the recipe.

This was a great weeknight, vegetarian dinner!  It's super easy and utilizes ingredients I almost always have on hand.  Of course,  versatility is always key for me and this recipe has it.  I could easily see using spinach or broccoli or whatever veggies you have on hand.  It came together quickly and the leftovers are tasty.  My gluten-free nephew ate it up and asked for seconds - that's all I need to hear!

I used regular pasta. In addition I added chicken as well. For the whipping cream I added that to taste. Overall delicious I will definitely make it again.

I used Fat free half and half instead of cream. It was a delicious meal,  flavorful and satisfying my spouse loved it. Making it again next week!

12-23-2018  ~Very pleased.  I wanted something different from my go-to pasta with garlic and olive oil and this really delivered.  Hubs didn’t like it because he said it was too salty but then his opinion can’t be trusted as he gets pickier as he gets older. (Me thinks he didn’t like it because the Parmesan, which he hates, was unbeknownst to him.  It wasn’t’ too salty) I, however, found this delicious - creamy and flavorful, not to mention pretty.   It’s easy too, so long as you have all your ingredients prepped and ready to go as you prepare this.  I used traditional pasta, not gluten free, added some garlic to the mix and, since same picky husband used my mushroom mix for another dish, baby bella mushrooms.

This was great. I will make it again. Doesn't have to be gluten free pasta, either, and very add-to-able with other veggies.
