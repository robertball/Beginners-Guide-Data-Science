I whipped this up for some leg quarters I was grilling and it worked well with chicken too. This is a good basic recipe and one you could change up if you wanted to. I think replacing one of the teaspoons of paprika with smoked paprika would really bump this one up a notch.

Seasoned a ham steak with it. The ham steak recipe called for some seasonings I didn't have so I used this instead. Turned out great and the broth left over from baking the ham steak was so good it will be used for hambone soup next. 

I also use this seasoning on eggs in the morning. It's so useful. Going to try it on a pan fried steak and hamburgers later next week.

This is a delicious flavor combination.  
I adjusted the quantities slightly. 
I didn't have normal Paprika only Smoked Paprika so I used 2 tsp of that, 2tsp fine Himalayan Pink Salt (I should have used a little less, but will next time), 2 tsp heaped Onion Flakes, 1/2 tsp freshly ground extra bold Black Pepper, 1/4 tsp Peri Peri (chili powder), 1/2 tsp Hot English Mustard Powder.
I blended everything with the spice/coffee grinding blade in the Nutribullet.
Will definitely make this again!
Love the creative name for this blend.

It's a good spice blend but has nothing to do with Vikings.  They didn't have cayenne pepper...

Rubbed this one on bone in chicken breasts and grilled to juicy perfection. The flavor was so good.

This is wonderful! It definitely has a kick to it. We added some garlic power with the other ingredients too. And we used it on some grilled steaks earlier this week. It's just as good as on the ribs! You really could use this on anything.
