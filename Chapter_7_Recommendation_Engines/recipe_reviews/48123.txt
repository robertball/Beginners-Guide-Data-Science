Not a bad stir fry recipe! I was concerned about the reviews that said it was bland and tasteless so I made a few changes. I added an extra Tbs of garlic and ginger (but I LOVE both). And use the real stuff! Powder doesn't have as much flavor. I sprinkled the tofu with s&p and cornstarch and fried it in another pan. I separated the bok choy and cooked the thick stalk part before I added the leafy part so the leaves wouldn't get soggy. The most important thing is to make sure that the veggies aren't overcooked otherwise it'll be soggy and all the flavors will mush together. Last of all, make sure that the sauce is very thick!! It will be bland and runny if you mix it together too early. I think next time I'll try using sesame oil too.

I thought this was just wonderful! like others, I baked the tofu first, and I used sesame oil.  I did use different vegetables, only red and green bell peppers, carrots, and broccoli, and I doubled the sauce.  

Overall, I thought this was very flavorful, even though I forgot the crushed pepper! I didn't think it needed salt...soy sauce is very salty.

This recipe is fairly simple, healthy, and quite tasty too (at least with the few improvisations I used!). I made it with the array of veggies I had in the fridge--some broccoli, zucchini, red and yellow pepper, and baby carrot--and fried the onion, garlic, ginger and tofu in a mix of regular vegetable oil and toasted sesame oil. I used half the tofu called for, and made more of the sauce. The sauce really was key, and its flavor can be adjusted easily. I did not find the meal to be bland, and I didn't need extra salt. As I do for many Asian food recipes, I topped it off with nuts, sliced almonds this time. Thanks for the recipe, particularly the sauce!

This is my go-to stir fry recipe.  It works with any veggies (I usually throw in onions, broccoli, bell peppers, and snap peas.)  To fry the veggies and tofu I use vegetable oil with a sprinkle a combo of sesame seed oil.  I like to use extra firm tofu, and before I put it in the pan, I pat it dry with paper towels, then coat with cornstarch to get a subtle crunch.  The sauce is the best part.  Sooo easy, and yummy!  I sometimes sprinkle ginger powder and red pepper flakes in while it's simmering for extra flavor.

The sauce was great but I cut the tofu into strips instead of cubes so it could have a more fried texture to simulate a beef stir-fry. Very good recipe.

This was my first time cooking with tofu and fresh ginger so I was happy that it came out edible. I baked the tofu on 350 for about 15 minutes. Don't be gentle with it when cutting as that's when it tends to crumble.

Stir-fry is all about the sauce. I found this sauce to be sweet and somewhat tangy. I didn't follow the recipe to the T-spoon, but it was still good. I don't know if I could crave this stir-fry, though, because I'm not a huge fan of sweet entrees.

There are a lot of vegetables so I had to double the sauce called for and it turned out perfect. Nothing wrong with extra sauce.

This dish was pretty good. I really liked the sauce. Next time I'll probably substitute some of the veggies with ones I prefer more, like broccoli and asparagus. It didn't really re-heat all that well.

Nice, simple and fast.  I used my preferred vegetables (broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, snowpeas, baby corn) and served over rice.

This recipe turned out well. I didn't have all of the required ingredients (i.e. fresh ginger) but the taste was decent. I think the sauce is what pulls it all together and really now that I have the sauce recipe it can be used on just about any stir fry. I liked not using much oil but had to add some to the pan because the garlic was sticking so much. Next time I make this I will cook the tofu first and then add in the garlic and onions. I also baked the tofu for a few minutes before adding to the pan per another reviewers suggestion but next time I will bake it longer. Tofu is just so hard to cook.

Overall though my husband and I really enjoyed the recipe.

I didn't have rice wine vinegar and substituted regular white vinegar.  The honey I used also seemed to have a particularly strong smell and sweetness.  The dish came out a bit strong tasting.  Maybe I'll try it again with different honey or use less?

I I gave it 5 stars because it was just right, although I substituted a lot, because most of the vegs I had available didn't match your recipe. I did have tofu, bean sprouts, carrots,garlic and mushrooms;  Everything else I substituted or omitted.  However, your sauce recipe is top of the line for flavor, so it was still a major success!  I wanted to let others know that it allows for a lot of variations.. I did double the sauce because by the time I had everything else together, it was really more than I expected.

The cooking time seems a little off...I don't like vegetables cooked until they are mushy, but carrots need to stir fry more than 2 minutes or they are really crunchy.  Other than that, it's a good recipe and you can use whatever veggies you have on hand.  Zucchini & yellow squash work well.

Very tasty! I used teriyaki sauce instead of soy, and we enjoyed it. Served over brown rice.

This turned out really good.  I used veggies I had available- broccoli, onions, green pepper etc.  I left out the honey as I often find honey too sweet.  Instead I added hoisen sauce and black bean garlic sauce to taste.  Yum!  That did the trick.

Really delish!!! And I didn't even have any ginger—I will definitely have some next time, as I bet this would be even better with it. My husband ate tofu!

Yeah!   This is pretty good. :)  I will definately use it again with my subs.  I baked the tofu, steamed the veggies, and used liquid aminos in place of soy sauce.  I also used chicken stock in place of water and sauteed the ginger/garlic in a small pan then added the sauce mixture to it. Once everything was ready, i tossed it all together in a large pan for just a moment to heat through.  Served with brown rice :->  Thank you for this recipe.  It was a great starting point for me and I hope that my additions will assist someone else! xo

This is very good but I did modify the sauce a bit.  I used 1 cup of chicken broth, 4 tablespoons rice vinegar, 2 1/2 tablespoons honey, 3 tablespoons soy suace and a touch of oyster sauce.  I used vegetables that I had on hand (broccoli & carrots) and served it over oriental egg noodles.  Delicious.

The sauce poured on just before serving really makes the dish.  I will be memorizing it so I can make stir fry as a quick go-to healthy meal.  This was my first time to stir fry in a good wok and it turned out great.  I used different vegetables with the tofu and threw in some seafood at the end (hubby think meat must be in every meal...sigh).  I also forgot the ginger that I had bought specifically for this...oops.  Case in point, as long as you get the sauce right you pretty much throw anything in your wok and it will come out great if you use the sauce from this recipe.

Takes a while to get the sauce (which we doubled) to thicken and also a while to cut up all the veggies. good though!

This was okay. It had a subtle flavor, which was disappointing, as I was hoping the sauce would have more flavor. It was good, but not anything exciting. I tried adding some Thai Chili paste to the sauce, which did add some spice, but the taste wasn't really improved. Will keep looking for "the one" stir-fry sauce recipe!

I'm not sure where I went wrong with this recipe. The first half of it started out great - the ginger, garlic, and onion was heavenly. The tofu cooked up nicely with it (a tip I got from another allrecipe.com-er - bake the tofu first until it browns slightly, it makes it firmer, drier, and easier to cook with). The fresh ginger gave it a wonderful taste. But my sauce was not sweet, it tasted mostly like vinegar - there was no depth to it. And for whatever reason, it didn't thicken up. I should have used more cornstarch. Ultimately, I probably won't make this again; I'll look for a different sauce to top my tofu and veggies. I will keep the garlic, ginger, and onion saute from the beginning of this recipe. Thanks, Bansree!

We liked this stir fry and will make it again. 
I toasted the Tofu in the oven to brown first. 350 degrees is what I used.
I doubled the Ginger and Garlic but thats just me.
I added one TBS Hoisin sauce to the sauce  and used Orange Juice in place of the 1/2 cup water.
Portabellas for the mushrooms.
Made more than 2 servings though as the two of us will get a second meal from it.
Thanks for all the reviews before hand which made this an even better recipe!

This was delicious, and super easy!  We used frozen stir fry veggies and did a half/half mix of mirin and rice vinegar for the sauce.  Turned out wonderfully, and didn't feel greasy at all.

This is a nice sweet & sour stir fry.  Great way to use up veggies (I did cabbage, carrots, & celery). I like to add extra ginger to the sauce mix & let it boil with it. I want to try using orange juice instead of water too. Not as good as take out, but better than a lot of the stir frys I have made :o)

The sauce is waaaay to bland. I second guessed this when it said to make a sauce from water. I would advise to cut the water down by half or more. I even added extra garlic and ginger and it did not help. Too bland for me, I will stick to my usual stir fry with garlic, ginger and soy only.

I was in the kitchen ALL night for this one, but it was tasty. I fried all the veggies and kept them warm and then made the sauce in the wok, adding everything back to get hot again. I did double the garlic and the sauce which was a good thing. Served it with rice noodles...yum!

My first attempt using tofu.  I cheated and bought frozen stir fry veggies, I figured the sauce would make the meal anyway and I was right.  My husband actually liked it.

I love tofu, but not this recipe. It was too bland and required a lot of hot sauce at the table just to taste like something. Maybe some cilantro would have helped? Doubling the garlic, ginger and pepper flakes?

This was really fresh, healthy and fantastic! It was a perfect dinner after hitting the gym. Fortunately, I had most of the ingredients except fresh ginger (I used ginger powder), bamboo shoots and baby corn (which I don't care for anyways). I put it all together in a wok and it came out beautifully. I also didn't have the crushed red pepper so I squeezed some sriracha over it towards the end. I will definitely make this again.

Fairly easy to make. Packed with nutritions. 
However, it is good only if you're a fan of sweet and sour dishes.  Lacks a distinct flavor - but overall, a healthy and quick dish.

This made a delicious  stir fry meal for diner tonight.
The sauce has a nice balance between  sweetness and tanginess. I had to double it though. The family likes a lot of sauce on the Rice. I didn't have rice wine vinegar. So, I looked up a substitute, white vinegar and sugar. But just half the amount of vinegar because rice vinegar is milder than white vinegar.
For veggies, I used what I had in the fridge, broccoli, carrots and red pepper. I served over some Jasmin rice.

Thanks for a great recipe!  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  We like strong flavors so I doubled the garlic, ginger, and crushed red pepper (it was spicy for my palate so be cautious if you like mild spice).  I only had soft tofu so I gently cut it into cube-size pieces and sauteed it in a separate pan with a small amount of sesame and canola oil.  In the wok, I used the following minced or chopped veggies:  6 green onions, 4 garlic cloves, and 2 inches of fresh ginger; then a few bok choy and napa cabbage leaves, 3 carrots, 2 celery stalks, 3 sliced broccoli stems, one medium zucchini, and three or four cups of fresh spinach.  Per another review, I cut the soft leaf parts of the cabbage and bok choy away from the stems and didn't add the leaves or the spinach to the wok until the last two or so minutes of cooking.  I made the sauce as directed and cooked it until it was thick.  Adding it to the moist vegetables at the end made the sauce just the right consistency.  My husband said this is one of his new favorite dishes!

I must concur with the group that says "too bland & unexciting."  I made the recipe as written, and the family sat around suggesting things to add to make it tasty.  Nope, not a keeper.

I made this last night.  It was edible, but my sauce turned out bland and too watery.  I'm not sure why.  It didn't thicken up when I added the corn starch like I thought it would.

I made this stir fry last night and shared it with my neighbor as my 14 year old hates tofu.  My neighbor was blown away.  She said, ypou didn't make this, where diyou get it.  It tastes like it came from the restaurant.  I added some chinese eggplant to the veggie list and deleted the bell pepper and added broccoli.  it was great.  to my surprise, this morning my 14 year old daughter had taken some for lunch, minus the tofu.

This is for sure one of the best stir-fry recipes I have ever used - vegetarian or not.  I made it for my family (2 & 4 year old and husband).  I left out the crushed red pepper, bean sprouts and bamboo shoots as the boys would not eat them, BUT the dish was SO good.  This dish can easily be tailored for what you & your family like and it's so easy.  The sauce is also delicious.  It tastes really fresh.  Will definitely make this again.

The flavor of the sauce was extremely boring, paired with the flavorlessness of tofu made for an unpalatable dish. This one went straight in to the compost pile. (if I have to modify a dish then I'm not really making the dish I'm rating - so I rate them only by how they are written)

This is truly a profound recipe! Its simple and basic, and yet, once tasted, complex and vibrant! The sheer color and arrangement of these ingredients makes it appealing. Unlike any other stir-fry recipe, this has perfect ingredients with cook times very close to accurate and a perfectly well-balanced sweet and sour sauce. If I might add just a few more ingredients, try some crushed up cashews and alphalpha sprouts in the mix with your favorite choice of rice.

Not a repeat recipe for us.  We love stir fry, this recipe was heavy on ginger and lacked other flavor.  Just ok, and we're left disappointed that we used all of our fresh ingredients for this.

I doubled the ginger and garlic and cooked all the vegetables in a thai stock I bought from Wegmans to cut the fat. I grilled the tofu on the George Foreman and added that last, but ended up just using sesame oil and lite soy sauce to season everything because the sauce wasn't a good mix of flavors at all. I liked the veggie combination, but that could have just been a result of throwing a bunch of veggies in a pan and cooking them.

Wonderful recipe! I tried this tonight and it turned out great! I did mess up on the sauce and put all the ingredients in at once, so it was a bit thin, but still tasted good. My culinary adviser (a.k.a. Mom) suggested using sherry instead of the vinegar. Will definately make again.

I really liked this recipie. Making it directly according to the recipie, I did think it needed a 'kick' so I added some spicy asian sauce, and it was perfect. I used pre-spiced tofu (half what the recipie calls for) and also added some shrimp. I didn't have bamboo shoots, but it didn't make a difference. I really liked this recipie and my husband, who refuses to eat tofu, even liked it and requested that I make it again!

This recipe had so many vegetables that it was very nutritious. But like everyone else it was so bland. The recipe doesn't even yield any salt, so I forgot to add my own. Everyone complained about it. I won't be making this again!

This recipe was not terrible, but it was definitely not delicious. If you're looking for something to enjoy rather than just tolerate, I recommend getting a LOT more creative than this.  This stir-fry sauce was a little bit tangy and has potential, but is by no means delectable as is.

I wouldn't make this recipe again. It was edible and did not taste bad, but was unexciting in flavor and not worth making again.

Very bland as the recipe is presented. We had to add salt and pepper to make it palatable.  Needs serious help. I'm not saving it.

What did I do wrong here? This is my tofu that WAS cubed?  It just turned into a sloppy burnt mess! Is there an extra step that wasn't mentioned here?

yes, I added some more vegetables, like broccoli and zucchini , added few drops of sesame oil to taste , sprinkled some toasted   seeds on top and it turn out to be great. It's a healthy, hearty and tasty dinner.

I selected this recipe based on what I had available in someone else's kitchen.  I doubled, per other reviews, the sauce & therefore doubled the spices.  Instead of water I used chicken broth.  Saluted the tofu ahead of time & Used fresh vegetables that were available & it came out fine.

The sauce is great but the extra water from the cooked vegetables I used diminished its flavor considerably. Next time I will strain the extra water from the vegetables before adding the sauce.

It is really healthy, and it does have a nice taste ... but i needed to add a million different spices to this to get any sort of flavor. The sauce by itself doesn't flavor this dish enough. Still going to make this, but in my own special way next time. Maybe use a premade sauce and more of it.

This recipe looked delicious the plus is it contàins healthy vegetables... The down side is the vegetables where far from being doñe in that little amount of time... 
Suggestions... Make sure YOU HAVE YOUR INGREDIENTS  in advance .. Then cook vegetables till tender at least a half hour...

Enjoyed this recipe, especially the fact that you can add whatever veggies you like.  Thought after the fact that cashews may have been a nice addition. Definitely would add sesame oil for sauteing and sesame seeds againnm.  They weren't in the recipe but they just sounded like they needed to be in there.  Used fresh garlic and ginger and would probably bump up the quantity on both, just a little bit.  Didn't have rice wine vinegar, so made due with apple cider vinegar.  Sauce was a nice finishing touch.

I used the recipe for the basics of cooking tofu. I added my own mix of veges and didn't have all the sauces so I used soy sauce, onion and garlic powder and a little fresh onion. It was great!!

this has got to be a first for me.. i decided to start off with making the sauce so i could focus on all the veggies afterwards.. but after tasting it i couldn't bring myself to make the rest of the meal.. bf said to just doctor it up.. so i tried adding some more soy sauce b/c mine is low sodium and also some sriracha.. but it just smells/tastes weird to me.. like too much vinegar.. and i LOVE vinegar filled foods.. bf said to just pour it out and try something else.. which he NEVER says

Fast...easy...great taste.  I like recipes that I can make in a snap with whatever I have in the fridge and this one fits that description.  Also, it tasted great.  It can also be modified to make it less sweet if preferred.  It was a little sweet and the red chili peppers made it have a tiny bite too.  I loved this and would definitely recommend it.  I like the idea of baking the tofu first when I have time to give it a different texture.  Tofu can be soft but baking it will make it more like meat.

I like my sauce a little thicker so next time I will add a little more cornstarch.  I did this strickly vegetarian and by the "empty the fridge" technique for the veggies.  SO good!  I paired it with a Cider beer and did not have the opportunity to take a sip after I tried the stir fry!  Inhaled!  My coworkers all told me that my leftovers spelled amazing the next day.  Will definitely make again.

The sauce was a bit heavy and sweet four my family's taste. By the time I put the vegetables in, the ginger was no longer discernible.

We liked this recipe. \i had no bok choy or bean sprouts. Added radishes, sliced thinly and broccoli. Took a while for the sauce to thicken so must start it sooner.

Overall a very simple and flavorful dish!   I didn't have bok choy so I shaved off some regular cabbage which worked great.   Only had 1/2 a pack of tofu and there  was more than enough food for 2 people.

I loved it!  Even my kids at it.  The tofu kind of broke part, (which was ok since my kids didn't realize what they were eating, but I didn't like that.)  The flavor was perfect.

I changed the recipe by adding more garlic and ginger. I also used slightly different veggies. Even with adding more garlic and ginger I found the tofu still very bland but the sauce was good.

Easy to cook and fast but a little on the bland side.  I will probably up the soy sauce next time.  I served it over rice and I was surprised my family enjoyed the meal with no meat.

Very good.  I doubled the sauce and used the veggies I had on hand - bok choy, pea pods, asparagus, bell peppers.  I probably used 2x the ginger and threw 3 whole cloves of garlic in so it wouldn't burn.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Some suggestions though: for those who say that it is too bland, I think it would be nice to use sesame seed oil instead of vegetable oil... it has a really nice flavor. (I also added sesame seeds.) My tofu didn't seem to hold a whole lot of flavor (maybe it was undercooked), but the broccoli did, so you might want to use vegetable that will pick up more of the flavor. I enjoyed the fresh and healthy factor, but overall it wasn't overly impressive.

I tried following the recipe as best I could and the sauce didn't taste right.  A little too overpowering and not what I wanted.
