This recipe just did turn out all that great.  The fritters were really bland.  I may make this again and try to modify it...

Don't forget to add salt or this will be very bland, I added a few pinches of crushed red pepper.  It still didn't have much taste, but nothing that mayonnaise, honey-mustard, or ranch dressing can't help!

These are really yummy, and a unique way to serve broccoli.

These were very dry. I made them again with seasoned bread crumbs and about a tablespoon of butter to moisten the bread crumbs. The cornmeal made it too dry. I also added some shreded cheddar cheese.

I don't like all the grease, but if you ad three more eggs, you can cook it as a quiche-type-thing in the oven.  Just remember to grease the pan.

I added a package of dry ranch mix.  They were pretty good!

I did make a change and used a combo of flour and Panko because I didn't have cornmeal.  That's why the 3 stars. Not sure if that was it but they were dry and not what I expected at all.

Just okay.  I added some salt and some flour, too, because the cornmeal alone wasn't binding the way I wanted it to.  I used frozen broccoli and thawed and strained it first.  I served them with spicy ketchup.
