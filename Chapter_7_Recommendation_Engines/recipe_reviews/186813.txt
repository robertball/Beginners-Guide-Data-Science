I was kind of leery at first on how the flavors would go with each other.   The blueberry, banana and peanut butter played very nicely against each other, you could taste each individually instead of one overpowering the other.  I used the wheat germ in it.  Overall, it was really tasty and will definitely make again!

This is really filling, which I appreciate in a smoothie. I made the full recipe, drank half for breakfast and half for lunch. Instead of just blueberries, I used a frozen berry mix (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries). I also omitted the honey as I don't like too much sweetness in my smoothies. Thank you :)

This recipe was actually pretty good! I liked how you could taste the blueberry, banana, and peanut butter equally.  Not one stood out over the other! I'd make this one again!

Delicious, filling, and a big hit with the kids.  I use blueberry yogurt and omit the the honey.  Another great tip is to use frozen bananas.  I take my ripe bananas (peeled and broken into chunks)and throw them in a ziplock in the freezer.  This makes my morning even easier!

This was better than I expected - I love blueberries and peanut butter, but never thought of having them together.  It really was pretty good!  And very filling, too.  Nice change from the usual.

I didn't care for it, but my kids did. Of course, they like anything with peanut butter. I liked that it wasn't too sweet and it used flax seed. I'd make this again.

delciious!! even my dad, who usually says food is so-so, LOVED this smoothie. he stopped at home in the afternoon briefly, and he took the cup from me and drank in big gulps! i think he loved this smoothie b/c of the peanut butter, which gives the smoothie a really "herng" taste. its a chinese word, and im not sure how to describe it in english except fragrant? full of goodness? and i LOVED this smoothie also! will definitely make again if i have blueberries on a hot/warm day!

Wavering between 4 and 5 stars - this smoothie is really surprisingly tasty, and I love what a nutritional punch it provides!  A hearty start to the day or a healthy alternative to a milkshake for the kids.

we liked it,  made it with a frozen banana and added a handful of ice. I like cold things.  We think we could decrease the peanut butter.  But good overall.

This is easy, quick, and most of all, it is so delicious!!!
I have been making it everyday for breakfast for me and bf. For two people, use multiplier 4 to calculate your ingredient amounts, that way it fits two 18 oz smoothie cups.

I did not have any flax seed on hand, went with frozen blackberries instead of blueberries and vanilla rather than plain yogurt.  Delicious, sweet and a good morning or afternoon hunger killer.

This is really tasty andvery filling.  It's definitely not one of those smoothies you can chug down.  I doubled the flaxseed and it tasted fine. I omitted the honey and yogurt and it was still really sweet and thick.   The key is to use a ripe banana

Made this for breakfast and it was quite good. The peanut butter is a bit over powering but still good. I would make this again.

My picky and traditional breakfast loving hubby was very pleased when I made this for him. He loves eggs and meat  and toast but never has time to really sit and eat it. So I made this for him on the go and he said it was surprisingly filling and extremely delicious. I added one more banana to thicken it up and a tiny bit more flax meal.  So thats one more change for healthy living!

I really liked it.  I've been looking for new ways to use blueberries since they are in season and cheap (and delicious).  I used the wheat germ instead of flax and honey roasted peanut butter instead of regular (I like it a little sweeter).  Also didn't have plain yogurt so I used vanilla Greek yogurt.  Will definitely make again and try using the blueberry Greek yogurt for extra blueberryocity, but the recipe is great as-is.

I really like this smoothie.  I change up the fruit all the time and I feel really good about the balance of carb/fat/protein.  Good start to the day.

I made this and it is delicious. I used vanilla Greek yogurt, almond/coconut milk, 3 tsp. sugar instead of honey and I added a handful of fresh spinach. It tastes just like a peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich. Yummy!!

This was good, and very filling. I substituted frozen mixed berries for the blueberries, and left out the honey. It was not quite cold enough for my taste, so I will make this again, but I'll substitute frozen bananas for fresh.

My 2 year old can somewhat be a picky eater, but he loved it! We now have this for a quick snack as well. Also, It is very versitle with different varietys of fresh and frozen fruit. Thank you so much for sharing!

I had to create an account to review this recipe! My husband is on a special diet before surgery, so we had to make a couple adjustments: subbed yogurt for water, added a scoop of vanilla protein powder and fiber powder. Also, we don't use ice cubes, so we used frozen sliced banana. Omigosh this smoothie is amazing! I can't wait to have this again tomorrow!

Great Smoothie!!!  I didn't have blueberries right now, so I used blackberries.  Great consistency!  I did add 3 ice cubes to it to get it really cold.

The right consistency, color and serving size.  I tasted mostly banana and peanut butter though. It was still very nice though.

It is, indeed, surprisingly tasty, albeit odd. I made it as is, with maybe a little more peanut butter. You get great nutrition from it for sure. When I first drank it I was hit with peanut butter, then the banana snuck in the sides, and finished off with the mild flavor of blueberry in the back. They don't really clash, though I don't think this will be our go-to recipe. Thanks for sharing!

SOOOOO good!!! You have to try this.  I wasn't sure about the peanut butter but it adds so much to this smoothie!  I like making this with frozen blueberries and I also add 1 cup of ice.  I did add a little more honey so that the sweetness wasn't diluted from the ice.  Delicious!  I will make this again and again!

Yum, this is good. I followed the recipe to a T except I only had whole flax seeds. I ground them first in the blender. Pretty tasty!

This was right on. I never would think to put blueberries and bananas together but was amazing. I didn't have flaxseed or yogurt however I did put some vanilla protein powder in.

Adjusted the recipe:  no flax seed, blackberry yogurt (6 oz.), no peanut butter.   Turned out pretty well, I'd say.

Was also a little hesitant about the combination but was actually really good and enjoyed getting the extra protein from the peanut butter to keep me full. My 3 year old also approved.

My fiance made this for himself and loved it. We did have to make a few changes. He is lactose and only likes the choc soy milk so he used choc soy milk in replacement of the regular white milk. We also did not have any yogurt in our apartment so we opted out of using that. He also added in choc whey protein to his shake. One last substitution was we used almond butter because it is healthier. We also added in ice because all of our fruits are fresh and never frozen. He will for sure make this one again.

It turned out to be a very satisfying breakfast on its own.  I think all the flavors balanced themselves out well.  I did use PB2 peanut butter powder because that was the peanut butter I had on hand and I threw in a couple pitches of spinach greens.  I will most likely make this again sometime in the future!

This smoothie is AMAZING. I could not believe the peanut butter blended so well. I have made blueberry banana before but truefully the peanut butter brings it all together. The taste is complete and perfect.

When I saw the title for this smoothie uh I had to try it! It came out so delicious and filling. I used fresh blueberry's and just added ice. I also didn't have any flax seed so I used chia and it came out great!

Very tasty -- the unexpected flavor blend is delicious. No need for honey -- seriously, it's sweet enough as it is! I thought it was a little too much milk because I like my smoothies thicker, but that's easily amended next time.

I can appreciate why kids would love this smoothie. Yet, I found the peanut butter was overpowering. My husband like it but wasn't crazy about the mixture. Noneless, I might have it once in awhile just for a change of scenery by adding less peanut butter... We'll try again

This smoothie was weird! It looked just like a blueberry smoothie, but tasted only like banana and peanut butter. I only had 1/3 cup of vanilla yogurt so I used that instead of the 1/2 cup of plain. I kept everything else the same, except using frozen fruit. I did find it somewhat on the thin side, though, for having used frozen fruit.

We really love this smoothie. The odd combination work for my kids and husband. If I don't have plain yogurt on hand I sub flavored/vanilla and skip the honey. I also freeze the banana. I have subbed peaches or strawberries for the blueberries and both work great.

Awesome!  I only us natural peanut butter, so I added an extra teaspoon of honey to make sure it was sweet enough.  My 3-year-old loved it!  I loved it too!  My husband liked it, but said the "peanut butter stuck with him" a bit, in terms of an after taste I guess.

I didn't have flax seed and I used frozen strawberries and raspberries instead of blueberries because they're what I had on hand. The peanut butter flavor was certainly dominant, but you could still taste the fruit. I'd make this recipe again.

Awesome smoothie! I'm lactose intolerant so I substituted original/unflavoured soy milk  for the milk and yogurt. I highly recommend using a frozen banana for a more chilly, thick smoothie!

I found this to be delicious. 
The flavours are like a peanut butter, banana + jelly sandwich...

I used real maple syrup instead of honey so my 10 month old could share with me. We both loved it!

I left out the honey and yogurt and used light vanilla soy milk instead. Also added a tablespoon of chia seeds. Very good.  Will be making again.

I excluded the flax and I used a frozen banana instead of  a fresh one. As other reviewers mentioned, the balance of blueberry, banana, and peanut butter was excellent.  The texture was also fantastic. Great recipe!

I used a mix of blackcurrents, redcurrants and blueberries, and I used almond milk in place of the yoghurt and milk (an easy vegan swap!). It was DELICIOUS!! Wasn't sure how it would all combine but it was one of the tastiest smoothies I've ever made, will definitely make again :)

Yummy good! I could taste the pb from the first sip. This one is a keeper. I can't wait to serve this shake to my grandsons.

I used pure peanut butter and found it to be too much. Next time, I will use less. Otherwise, very filling & yummy.

This stuff is awesome. I didn't have any yoghurt around, so I substituted evaporated milk. Still tasted awesome.

I've been using this recipes for a couple of years now. I don't use wheat germ or flax seed, instead I put a scoop of vanilla protein powder in. Delicious.
