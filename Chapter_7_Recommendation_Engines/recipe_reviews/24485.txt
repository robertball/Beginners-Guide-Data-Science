I used Diet Ginger Ale and I made homemade lemonade using a recipe from this site that used Truvia instead of sugar. I did NOT add the additional sugar. My kids enjoyed this as is but my husband made these into a makeshift Lynchburg Lemonade by adding a jigger of whiskey. I'll make this again.

I made myself a drink- using 12oz diet ginger ale, 6 oz light lemonade, & 1/4 c. Splenda. No ice- just used chilled ingredients. VERY YUMMY!!! And so easy & virtually no calories- wow.

I have made this recipe at least three times for family and friends and everyone loves it. They often ask for the recipe. It's such a pleasure for me that it's very simple to make and it doesn't include 50 ingredients.

I used Splenda instead of sugar, but otherwise followed the stated amounts in the recipe. This was a nice refreshing drink for the first warm day of the year in Columbus! Thanks, Martha!

This was way too sweet. I had to double the amount of lemonade because it just tasted like overly sweetened ginger ale. Next time I will leave the sugar out all together.

I must have used the wrong ginger ale or lemonade becuase it was EXTREMELY sweet! It probably would have been perfect if no sugar was added. We ended using a lot more ginger ale and lemonade.

This is easy to make and very tasty. I used "Newman's Lemonade" which has a very low sugar content and diet ginger ale. Delicious and refreshing!

If you like a refreshing drink for a party, if you also lemon punch it tastes the same.

Thank you Martha for such a yummy recipe.  I made a cup of this for myself just to taste it using crystal light and diet ginger ale.  Rather than adding ice I added frozen raspberries which added an additional layer of flavor.
