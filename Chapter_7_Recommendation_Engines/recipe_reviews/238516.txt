I have to admit that I followed this recipe loosely. I had about 1/2 of a 20 oz. package of fresh tortellini left that I needed to do something with, and this recipe fit the bill. I didn't have any pepperoni, so I substituted some small cubed German proscuitto that I had picked up at Aldi. I also didn't want to open a whole can of black olives, so I used Kalamata olives that I had already opened. I did follow the recipe for the rest, just kind of eye-balling the ingredients to match the amount of tortellini that I had. It was delicious, and my daughter was happy to take the left overs in her lunch today.

I love this recipe!  I made it exactly as written for my nieceâ€™s wedding shower a few years ago and it was a huge hit.  Now Imm asked to bring it to all family functions.  I do adjust it a little now- I add halved grape tomatoes and use both mozzarella and provolone as well as pepperoni and salami- and I try to add a little less dressing.  Always make it a day ahead to let the flavors blend.  And I always have to double it.  Great recipe!

I am a pasta salad kind of guy. I miss the tortellini salad I used to buy at this deli when I lived in Seattle  a few years back. 
This salad really took me back home. It was delicious and it will now be a staple in our home. Two of my neighbors could not get enough and were very excited when I gave them a copy of the recipe. I did not use pepperoni but went with boars head salami instead. Great salad ! Totally out of the ballpark!!!!

This was really tasty!  We split the recipe into two portions and to one we added the artichokes (Only had one jar on hand) and to the other half we used pickled banana peppers instead.  Simple and easy!  Be sure to use a good quality sharp provolone cheese.

Lots of yummy ingredients, but sooooo salty!  I might try it again and omit the dry Italian salad dressing mix to see if that helps.

I made the recipe as written.  It was ok.  I think 3 packages of tortellini was 1 package too many.  The amount of pasta overwhelmed the other ingredients.  If I make this again, I will  cut back on the amount of pasta and probably add grape tomatoes and pepperoncini.

I actually did not follow the recipe to the letter. I went Freestyle. I was out of black olives, so I used green olives. I left out the pepperoni and put a can of diced tomatoes with basil and garlic. It was delicious.
Don't be afraid to mix and match and substitute as your pantry allows. You come up with some really good alternatives.

This is great as is!  I did make half by using just one package (9 oz) of tortellini and then roughly halving all of the other ingredients.

I have made this a handful of times. You can't go wrong. It always ends up delicious . I have used mozzarella instead of provolone and I have used both. I have used salami instead of pepperoni and I have used  both. I have also added pepperoncini  to it. It is always a crowd pleaser .

This recipe was fantastic.  I am ashamed to admit I had never tried cheese tortellini before this and now I can't stop thinking of the different options I can add in with this.  Chicken, crushed pepper, banana peppers, etc. the options are endless and I plan to make this over and over.  Great flavor and easy to make.

I made this dish for a hot Memorial Day low country boil at the lake. It was the perfect side dish, and all 30+ guests agreed!
