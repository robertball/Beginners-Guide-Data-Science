Added more olive oil and lemon juice.... plus Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper... put the extra onto plastic wrap and made a roll .. like a pesto sausage and froze it to use later.  Can cut the amount I want to use and save the rest.  Yummy stuff!

Easy to make. I used basil right from my garden. Added some daily and a little more garlic. Yummy!

This was so easy and it tastes delicious!  I added a pinch of salt, some grated parmesan, and a bit more oil than called for.  I've never made pesto before, but this was so easy I know I will make it again and again!

This is sooooo yummy! I made it to eat with crackers, or on carrots, and it was amazing. I'm definitely adding this recipe to my main rotation. I added spinach leaves, and next time I'm also adding a can of garbanzo beans for a healthy pesto hummus dip. Yum! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe!  I needed to add just a bit more olive oil to make it a better consistency.

Perfect. Just what I was looking for.  Something quick  and easy and tasty.   I did add about 1/4 Parmesan cheese and a little more olive oil to get the right consistency.
