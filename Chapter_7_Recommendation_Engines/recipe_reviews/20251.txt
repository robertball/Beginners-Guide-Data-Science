I would've given this 5 stars if it added pecans! However even without pecans it would have been yummy (especially for people who have nut allergies but some crunch factor really makes a difference). I reduced the sugar by 1/3 and it was sweet enough, would make this again.

If I had mashed up the beans better, I think this would have been a bigger hit. However my sons figured out it was different, so they were already assuming they would not like it. Would try this again if I could figure out a substitute for the dark corn syrup that my diabetic DH can consume.

I tried this pie because my husband loves pecan pies, but we have a relatively tight budget, so don't purchase pecans often for much of anything except salads. We tend to spend the budget on plenty of produce & any discretionary food budget $'s on parmesan & etc. In the past, I considered trying peanuts instead of pecans, but my husband was dubious, so I didn't try that. When I heard of beans in a 'pecan' pie, it just cracked me up so much that *I* decided that my husband had to try a pie this way. My daughter did the actual mixing & baking. She did a fairly good job. My family had mixed reviews on this pie. However, before sharing our results, I need to admit that we underbaked this pie a tad. Perhaps the texture of the beans might be different if it was baked a little longer. That said, as it stands, my husband is inclined to think that the beans in themselves are not a problem, but that he would like a little crunch. So I'm thinking that substituting some peanuts for some beans would work better. Even peanuts have a significant expense for our particular budget, especially when compared with beans. So next time, we'll try about 1/3 C of peanuts. Also, I think that rather than mashing the beans roughly, I'll turn the 2/3rds cut of beans +nuts out onto a cutting board & chop them roughly using a chef's knife. Other than that, the recipe is alright, but my husband likes the pie base of his mother's pie so I'll try the beans & peanuts in that base next time. Thanks 4 the idea.
