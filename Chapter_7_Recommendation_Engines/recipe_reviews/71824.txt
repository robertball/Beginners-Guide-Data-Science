I placed all ingredients in a foil bag and grilled everything together for about 30 minutes. Turned out pretty good.

Made this last night and it was great!! The relish makes the steaks more 'summertime fresh', opposed to using a steak sauce. Grilled the tomatoes fresh out of the garden. Next time I'll try grilling the onion and garlic as well.

We made this one last week.  I used the big slicing tomatos that the store had.  Instead of dicing the onion we cut it in thick slices and grilled that as well.  Roasted a whole head of garlic on the grill wrapped in foil; be sure to cut the top of the garlic head off and drizzle with olive oil and a sprinkle of salt.  You can also put a dash of oregano or basil on it.  Wrap in foil and place on the grill.  When everything is done unwrap the garlic and squeze it out of the bulb.  I chopped all the veggies together.  We also had grilled squash with this meal.  We will be adding this one to our weekly rotation!
