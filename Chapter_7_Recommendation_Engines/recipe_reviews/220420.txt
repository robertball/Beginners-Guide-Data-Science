Im only giving it 3 stars because it was bland for my taste but has lots of potential.  The second time I made it I changed a few things.  I sauteed a small chopped onion, dash of red pepper flakes and 2 minced garlic cloves until translucent.  Then added the chicken, salt, pepper, a dash or two of dried oregano and basil.  This really upped the flavor without adding a ton of calories and turned it into a 5 star dish.  Yum, yum.  Thanks for sharing.

Husband and I both really enjoyed this.  I modified recipe for 2 servings, used an 8-ounce b/s chicken breast, the same amount of asparagus and substituted jarred roasted red pepper for the bell pepper.  Fast, super-easy and perfect for my Weight Watchers plan...only 9 points!  And anytime husband says 'I like it,' it's a keeper!  Thanks Kris!

This was really good with a few add-ins, suggested by other reviewers. I added sauteed onion, garlic, basil and oregano. I also coooked the quinoa in chicken broth. I'll definitely make this again.

Been trying to cook more with quinoa since it's really quite an incredible grain. Aside from simply substituting it for rice I am always on the prowl for easy dinners that use it. This recipe looked like just the ticket for a quick mid-week dinner, except it did look a little bland, and my husband is not keen on asparagus. I had a bag of frozen spring vegetables with a cracked peppercorn seasoning (PictSweet Steamables) so I substituted that for the asparagus, there was red pepper in it, as well as a small amount of asparagus and some zucchini and green beans. So it seemed on par. Looking at other reviews, I also added some minced garlic, chopped onion and some Penzey's Tuscan Sunset spice blend (it's an Italian Style seasoning.) My husband walked in the door as I was cooking and exclaimed that the house smelled FANTASTIC. Another reviewer had mentioned that the meal was only 9 Weight Watcher points. He's on WW so when I told him that he was even happier. This easy to prepare meal, with ingredients I usually have on hand, will definitely be in the regular rotation!

This was simply and quick.  Like others, I added basil and oregano.  I used asparagus, zucchini, celery and tomato.  That's what I had and you can really throw anything into this.  I also added 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 1 Tbsp sesame oil, and 1 Tbsp rice vinegar because I like a "sauce".  It was very good this way.

Awesome!  Let me begin by saying that my husband and I are not vegetarian, vegan, or even all that healthy of eaters (though I'm working to change that).  I have never used quinoa before.  As an experiment, I bought some red quinoa and tried this recipe.  I used coconut oil (no flavor), cut up chicken thighs, and per some suggestions, some garlic, green onion, pepper, basil, oregano, and a pinch of sea salt.  HOLY COW!  It was so good, I was amazed, and the nutty flavor of quinoa reminded me a bit of Chinese flavoring (think Cashew Chicken).  I am now a quinoa convert, as is my husband AND my 3 year old!  Thanks, Kris!!!

Pretty good. I liked the flavors, but it was missing something for me, maybe some seasonings or a light sauce to enhance the texture and tie the flavors together. Good and healthy as written, though, and very quick and easy! Thanks for the recipe. :)

I was looking for a recipe containing these ingredients and found a winner!! I read all the reviews to see the tweaks and changes.  I combined most of them-saut√©ed onion, garlic,added a little basil and salt; used the leftover chicken broth to poach my chicken breasts and cooked the quinoa in that.  Finally, I sprinkled some feta cheese on top and it was so yummy!!  Definitely will make this again and share the recipe with friends and family that want to eat healthy!

Have been wanting to make a recipe with quinoa and liked the small list of ingredients for this dish. As written, though, I thought it might lack flavor, so tossed the chicken in a homemade blackening seasoning before cooking. Will make this again.

This turned out really well. Was delicious. We even accidentally forgot the red peppers (which were a pretty big part of it) and it still tasted great.

The next night we made a variation with the red pepper we forgot and pears, which was surprisingly good.

Pretty bland as written. I even took other reviewers suggestions and added some chopped onion, minced garlic, basil and garlic salt. Then it was okay. Healthy, but just okay tasting.

The recipe was OK, but I made it a little healthier by cutting the mayo amount in half and substituting greek yogurt.  Also, because I prefer a tarter tartar (ha ha) sauce, I use half sweet, half dill pickles

I like the base point of this recipe, but just by reading it felt that it lacked flavor. IMO it's not necessary to cook the quinoa in chicken broth. I cooked mine quickly in a rice cooker and then focused on adding more flavor to the stir fry. I started by sauteeing chopped onions, then added the asparagus and chicken. I also added button mushrooms I had lying around and some leftover cabbage kimchi. The kimchi was great and added a lot of tangy flavor. I recommend it.

This was very tasty and easy to prepare. While my quinoa was cooking, I cut and saut√©ed my fresh vegetables. As per others suggestions, I added diced onions, sliced mushrooms and minced garlic to my vegetables. This just helped get some vegetables out of the frig and more nutrients into my meal. It made 5 entree servings. There was plenty of chicken, so I may be more generous with some of my vegetables next time.

I love the idea. 4 stars bc flavor is just ok as written. Second time I made this doubled with ground chicken 2 packages of frozen asparagas and frozen tricolored peppers. Seasoned (garlic, onion, crushed red pepper) and cooked chicken first while quinoa was cooking, then saut√©ed frozen veggies. Put it all together with a little parm on top. everyone enjoyed that way.

This was the first time my boyfriend and I were trying quinoa. I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth and found the smell overpowering. Neither of us cared for quinoa, it turned out, but the dish was okay. We might try it again with rice.
