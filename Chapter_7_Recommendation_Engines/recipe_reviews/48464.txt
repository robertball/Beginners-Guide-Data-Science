Nice change from the usual method of cooking artichokes. Before I sauteed them, I rubbed the insides with a cut lemon and squeezed the juice from 1/2  of the lemon over the artichokes. I used more olive oil than butter which helps prevent the garlic from getting too dark. I added the juice from the remaining 1/2 lemon to the water or white wine. When serving the artichokes, I poured the sauce from the pan over them. Yum! Thank you for this recipe.

Wow! I love artichokes and always just boiled them before. Had fun getting the choke out, but I think I have a method now. I doubled the butter and garlic the second time I made it and doubled the water for steaming. I also doubled the steam time, found it was much more tender that way. I always dip my artichoke in a simple butter and lemon mix. The garlic was a wonderful addition to the flavor! And this week, artichokes are on sale. My boyfriend doesn't care for artichokes, so I just make this recipe with two artichokes as my complete dinner! Yum, yum, yum! A definite keeper! I can't wait to visit my folks and cook it for them this way! Thanks for the recipe. I'll also try some of the other suggestions folks have made so far.

I decided that I would do the opposite to try to recreate a dish I had at an Italian resturant.  I steamed the artichokes first than I sauteed them. Yummy!  Buttery and garlicky they were tasty!

I tried this recipe, and loved it. I thought scraping out the raw choke would be much more difficult, but I used a melon-baller,and it came right out. My daughter loved not having to deal with it while eating her artichoke. The toasty garlic flavor was great too! I will never make artichokes any other way now. WOW

This was outstanding!!  My husband and I love artichokes and really enjoyed the garlic flavor.  I replaced half the water with lemon juice although white wine or chicken broth might enhance the flavor also.  Thanks for a great one!!

I didn't want my garlic to turn bitter w/ the long cook time so I  sliced it, sauteed it for a couple of minutes to infuse the oil & removed it from the pan before adding the artichoke. I normally would have chosen to steam it w/ wine nstead of water but I was serving this w/ a tilapia in white wine sauce & didn't want my flavors to be redundant so I used water & squeezed a half a lemon in. I served it w/a ramekin of melted butter for dipping.

Very good and different way to make artichokes!  I did, however, use 6 large cloves of garlic since we are garlic lovers.  I also added 3 Tablespoons of Chicken Broth in the last 5 minutes of steaming because I have a very powerful stovetop and needed more liquid.  Thanks for the recipe John!

We love artichokes!!  This recipe is one of the easiest and is delicious.  I've served it twice and both times we've loved it. My husband likes it because the choke is gone and it makes eating the artichoke easier. The second time I steamed the artichokes about 45-50 minutes and we liked the texture better.

Excellent, but then I love artichokes so much Santa always put them in my Christmas stocking!  I used white wine for part of the water called for which added great complexity of flavor.  Not an inexpensive vegetable given how much of it is inedible and they're kind of a pain to prep, but they're worth every penny.  (Note: The smaller, baby artichokes, if you can find them, may be more expensive, but have less waste and are more tender)

These are awesome. I had HUGE artichokes, so mine took a little longer to steam - otherwise changed nothing. Thanks for the recipe, we'll use it again.

I just made this dish - it was wonderful! It was great to try something besides just boiled artichoke dipped in garlic butter. What I did different - steamed the artichoke first with garlic tucked under the leaves and drizzled in lemon juice. Removed choke. I sautéed the garlic in the butter and then removed the garlic (so it wouldn't get too bitter). Sautéed the artichokes and then added chicken broth, water, and lemon juice to steam. Delicious! Thank you!

This is great if you really like garlic.  I made it twice and the first time I used too much garlic.  The second time I eased up a bit and I Really enjoyed it.  I love that you cut the fuzzy stuff out of the middle before you sit down to eat!  So much less maintainance!

I really want to give this more stars, but 1/4 cup of water is too little! My artichokes started to burn in the pan and I had to rush to add more. Otherwise, they turned out well.

Very good.  I steamed them first, then added the butter and browned them a little, then added the garlic (so it wouldn't burn).  My husband and I both loved them.

This is me, Jjdon - my recipe.  I've done this a couple of times now, but I'll do it again so it comes up on top.  Allrecipes edits the recipes they get and in this case they didn't necessarily do it well.  People talk about cooking times and liquid - that all depends on the size of your artichokes.  We like them about fist sized, which can cook in 20 minutes or so, cut in half.  You need to think about the size, and you need to watch the time and liquid - this is actually almost braising.  Often I will add liquid part way through.  You can walk away but you can't walk away and forget it, either.  If you pay attention and watch how they are going this is hard to ruin.  Yes, I can see monster chokes taking 40 minutes and a fair amount of liquid.

I used this recipe to introduce artichokes to my family...they are now all fans of artichokes!  I did steam them for 45 minutes and because we are fans of garlic I used the amount stated in the recipe.  This one is a keeper!!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious!!  I have always added garlic to the water when steaming artichokes, but this recipe now takes top billing in my kitchen!  Having lived in the Garlic Capital of the World, I automatically doubled the garlic in this recipe.  I received great reviews all during dinner, from all ages.

Mmmmmm.  This turned out really well, though I did my own tweaking.  My hubby turned me on to artichokes when we met, but he was always burning them because they  would invariably run out of water in the steaming stage.  I found a way of cooking them in the microwave and adapted it for this recipe:  simply follow this recipe through the sautee stage and then, instead of steaming on the stove, arrange the choke halves cut side down in a microwave safe dish with about 1/4 inch of water, cover loosely and microwave on high for 17 minutes.  Let them stand for 5-10 minutes.  The chokes cook nicely and do not burn.

I don't know what I did wrong but these turned out horrible.  They were very bitter and did not have much flavor to them.  I was really excited to try this one too b/c of the rave reviews :(

What a great way to prepare artichokes. I will use this method from now on. However I was not at all happy with the garlic. It made the artichokes very bitter. Luckily I had a lemon in my fridge so I squeezed the juice all over the cut side and that made them fantastic!!! The juice went right into it. Next time I will eliminate the garlic completely and use the lemon juice to flavor them before serving.

YUM!  Very easy and delicious!  I served with a pesto mayo and my guests loved it.  I added a little sea salt to zing it up just a bit.  Excellent first course!

This is great!  We have always flavored the butter in which we dip the steamed artichoke - it is much easier and tastier to cook the artichoke with the flavoring!  Instead of cutting artichoke in half, also try pouring the sauted butter and garlic over the whole artichoke before cooking in a pressure cooker, and eating leaf by leaf!

Delicious and easy recipe! I reversed the process. Steam first then saute. I also added Hollandaise Sauce drizzled over top of artichokes. My husband has never liked artichokes before but he loved them cooked this way!

I tried this last night because I had bought some baby artichokes. My husband wanted to know when we could have it again! Soon since I only used half of what I bought :) - It was really good and much easier than I had expected - Thank you JJDON.

Whoa~ This is fantastic!!!  I took some suggestions from other reviewers and added fresh lemon juice at steaming and after.  I also added a wee bit of onion to the garlic when sauteeing. This recipe is fab.

I have made these and the grilled artichokes.  I said the grilled were the best I've ever had, but I was sooooo wrong.  These are outstanding!!!!!  Followed the recipe to the letter, wouldn't change a thing, except maybe how many I make.  I ate two whole artichokes in one sitting, my nine-year old ate one and a half.  Great recipe, thanks!!!

This was very bitter.  I love artichokes, and this was the first time I didn't want to eat them.  I think the garlic was cooked too long.  I might try this recipe with a different cooking method to keep the garlic from going bitter again.

I really enjoyed the "prep" on the artichokes--getting rid of the hairy choke, however, the steaming should be for 45 minutes instead of 20.  There is no way of getting around a long steaming process, unless you use a pressure cooker.  The recipe as it reads will give tough artichokes with no meat to eat.

My husband really liked these- I also cooked them nearly double the time recommended.  Dipped in lemon butter.  Yum.

Ruined my artichoke. I was so looking forward to it too. The leaves never got soft enough to eat (after an hour of steaming them). The garlic ended up burning, and the butter just made it a slippery mess when trying to eat it. I'm going back to boiling them.

Tasty! The only downside is that the leaves are slippery with all that butter and it's hard to get a good grip while you're eating it.  But I can deal with it!

This was a nice change of pace for cooking artichokes. Usually I just steam them. They tasted great, but I probably won't use this recipe all the time.

This recipe produced some of the most delicious artichokes I have ever had. I ended up passing on steaming it in just water, and used a combo of white wine and water. For dipping sauce I cracked some cloves and let them sit in some butter while it melted. Super garlicky, just the way we love it! Will definetly make again.

I found it a pain to yank out the "fur" and kept getting stabbed by the purple prickly leaves. I didn't notice much of a difference between this and when I steam them regularly. Also I needed to steam them much longer than the recipe stated. I tried adding white wine,, but that didn't help much either.

This was pretty good!  After sauteing the garlic in butter, I pushed the garlic to the edges of the pan so it wouldn't brown and get bitter. The only one who didn't like it doesn't like artichokes period!

I used dry white wine instead of water for additional flavor, and I didn't need to steam them for more than 10-15 minutes.  I've made these twice and we love them.

I have made these a bunch.  I absolutely love them.  Even people that don't typically like artichokes like these when I make them.  The only thing I do differently is add a little lemon juice while steaming.  I serve with garlic lemon butter sauce, because I don't like mayo.

This recipe is really good, although I think steaming and THEN sauteing will lead to a better flavor. I had never thought of steaming the artichokes before-- much easier than boiling! We still served them with a bit of lemon juice for dipping and they were a huge hit at the dinner party.

This was fantastic!  I did two things differently:  1) I added about another 1/4 cup of water at around 5 minutes left to cook, and 2) I added a very, very small amount of cooking sherry to the pan when I added the second round of water.  The artichokes were perfectly tender and wonderful!  It is surprising to me that other people say theirs took so much longer to cook!

While delicious (eventually) the artichokes were absolutely NOT done in the recommended time.  I just left them to simmer well after we had all finished dinner and checked on them about an HOUR later and they were overdone but at least they were done!  Next time I will steam them like I normally do until they are almost done and then quickly sautée them afterwards.

These were wonderful.  I added more garlic and a little bred crumbs at the end to kind of thicken the butter,  my eldest son (7yrs old)  ate about 1/2 of mine.  I used only one artichoke to try it with.

I steamed them first for about 30 minutes, then sauteed them, then removed the choke.  These were pretty good.  Next time I will make my herbed butter to dip the stems in.

I used olive oil instead of butter and served with garlic mayonaise. It was pretty good, a nice change from the usual steamed was of preparing them. A little too greasy. Be sure to watch them carefully so they don't burn.

We really enjoyed these. I read a few of the reviews and the common theme was the bitterness so after the garlic was sauted I removed it from the pan, garlic is bitter if cooked too long and becomes brown. I followed the lead of another reviewer and added a dry white wine instead of water in the beginning, topping up to pan with water as needed. The time and amount of liquid really depends on the size of the pan and the artichokes. Thanks for sharing.

Another good way of preparing artichokes.  I'm glad I saw the note from JJDON that this recipe was intended for small artichokes because mine did take a lot longer to cook.  The garlic and butter give a good flavor, but an added squeeze of lemon would be perfect.

I made these the other night and they came out great. I did add a bit of lemon juice and Italian seasoning to the water oil mix, which was a good addition. Overall, very easy to do and very tasty. Will be making these again.

So much more flavorful than boiling. We have enjoyed armloads of delicious artichokes every day this week and this was one of my favorite methods. The intensity of artichoke flavor is lovely, and these are easier to prepare than boiling, which dilutes the artichoke flavor. I have a cleaning hint, especially for those dealing with organic home grown artichokes; soak them 30 minutes in a large bowl or bucket of water, then plunge them rapidly up and down in the water to rid them of dirt and aphids. After cutting in half, use the tip of a paring knife to score right under the base of the fuzzy choke-then pry out the choke with a spoon. It will pop out almost in one piece. More than 1/4 cup of water might be needed to steam for 20 minutes; I would say 1/2 cup if you don't have a tight sealing lid, or check at the midway point.

Yummy! Easier to make this way. Saute onions with minced garlic in olive oil and butter. Squeezed half a lemon on artichokes. Added the artichokes to pan. When adding the water I added the other half of a lemon and some more butter. They could have cooked longer. Will make again.
