We make this dip all the time, but we substitute 2 cans of crab for the clams and add jalapenos to spice it up.  It's a great dip!

I was craving good clam dip and this was great.  I didn't do it in a bread bowl, just mixed up the dip ingredients and cooked it in the oven in casserole dish at 300 for about 25 minutes until it was bubbly - it was a hit!

I loved this recipe - it was SO easy to put together, and it was a huge hit!  We brought it to a party, and it was the only thing that was completely devoured.  I only had time to cook it for about 1-1/2 hrs (although I did use the convection setting on my oven) and it still turned out great.  I bought a couple of extra baguettes and sliced them up to serve with this.  Wonderful!

I changed the clams to crabs and it turned out great!  I've made it a few times and it always goes over well.

This is a great recipe! For those who like a bit more zesty flavor, i made some minor changes. I added 4 cloves of pressed garlic in place of the onion. 4 teaspoons instead of 2 for the Worcestershire, and lemon juice. 2 teaspoons of hot sauce. I use tapatio. 4 tablespoons of beer instead of two. I also added a 1/2 cup of finely grated sharp cheese. I used parmasean, but you could use any sharp cheese with a little bite to it. Other than those few minor tweaks, this is the best hot clam dip i have found.

This was good, but a little bland. A bit more hot sauce, onion, and beer will fix it. We served it with crackers b/c toasted bread really didn't hold up, it was a little to thick. Coming to the next potluck with a little fixin'!

Awesome!! My whole family loved this. Even those who are not big clam fans ate it up. I baked it for 2 hours (1 hour less than suggested in recipe) and it was fantastic. Great appitizer for parties!! Suggestion: buy some extra bread to use for dipping or include crackers on the serving plate.

I made this for a New Year's Eve party at my boss's house.  When he asked me what I was bringing, he was like not thrilled with the idea.  Boy did he change his mind after I brought it.  There was no dip left, but plenty of everything else that everybody else had brought.  Personally, I will be making this for all parties from now on.  This is an exceptional dip and the presentation is great!

This recipe was fantastic... only changes I made included 1. using 8oz of sour cream instead of one of the cream cheese packages, since I didn't have enough cream cheese, 2. throwing a few shakes of cayenne pepper in instead of the hot sauce and 3. baking it in a casserole dish covered with foil at 300 degrees for 1.5 hours (last 10 minutes uncovered) since I didn't have a bread bowl.

Took this to a football party and kept it warm in a new serving dish that had a tea candle underneath.  Worked really well.  Dip got rave reviews from the crowd.  I did add a clove or two of garlic and some dried parsley.  Will make again!

I doubled the recipe and baked it for the recommended time in a casserole dish. It was really good and a big hit at my party. I served it in a warming dish with french bread slices that I broiled in the oven to toast. Delicious!

I tried this recipe but found it to be bitter. Beer, grated Onion hot pepper sauce and Worcestershire sauce are all bitter ingredients. I would suggest less grated onion or use sweet onion (vadalia) I think with the sweet onion the recipe would be less bitter. I would try this recipe again with some adjustments.

Very good, even with modifications. I had no cream cheese or onion; used sour cream instead and some onion soup mix along with everything else in this recipe. I didn't think it was good at first, but after the flavors blended in a couple of hours- it was great -it was finished off quickly at the party...

This was quite good.  Next time I'll try it with jalapenos for sure!  My only problem is that there wasn't enough bread for the dip, so we were burning our fingers tearing the bread bowl apart near the end, haha.

I was not impressed by this recipe. I was looking for a very clammy taste, and I halved the recipe and still used two cans of clams. The onion didn't seem to add a good taste to the dip. Worcestershire and lemon juice are right on, along with a dash or two of the clam juice. I love clam dip, but I'll definitely modify this recipe next time.

I make this all the time for family gatherings. We are not hotsauce fans, so I don't add that and it comes out just fine. I use a sourdough round. When I transport it to parties, I leave it in the foil and wrap it in a towel to keep it warm. I have extra crackers on hand because the bread goes pretty fast!  Thanks!!!

This was tasty, but could have used just a little more kick. I used Sourdough bread as that was all that was available (and I was too busy to make my own). This is relatively quick to throw together, but the baking time is the killer - plan ahead. Toasting the extra bread is key here. Very yummy!

Awesome!  Made this dip for a Mother's Day cookout and everyone raved about it.  I made the recipe as written except I added some sprinkled garlic powder to it.  I couldn't toast bread fast enough to serve with it.  It is a keeper!

I am not sure if I didn't drain the clams enough, but the consistency was too watery.  The taste was good though, will have to attempt a smaller amount and try something to thicken it.

Used onion powder instead of onion.  Seemed like it mostly just tasted like cream cheese, was bland.  Felt like needed to increase most the other ingrediants, like pepper sauce, beer, worc, etc.  
Wasn't that great with bread, better with Ritz crackers.  Don't think I'd bother making it again.  Better dips out there.  =)

This was a great dip and very easy to make. The only change we made was that we used fresh little neck clams instead of the canned clams, but still very good.

I am a seafood lover, particularly shellfish.  I must admit I was hesitant to make a clam dip though.  I wasn't sure how it would go over at the Christmas Party I was bringing it to.  I told everyone it was a "seafood" dip and it was gone within 30 minutes.  Everyone loved it!  After they tried it, I told them it was a clam dip.  Several people asked for the recipe.  Note:  I only baked it for an hour and a half.

Amazing!!!  My husband's totally picky, "food weary" european/ mediteranian family ate it all.  The rest of us enjoyed it too... I made enough for 25 and it was gone. I'll be making this for years to come.  Thank you so much!

I have been making this recipe for over 30 years, but because I love my dips really chunky, and full of seafood the dip has evolved. I add close to a full bag of shrimp that has been thawed and tails removed, plus a a whole package of imitation crab, along with a clove of garlic, and a quarter teaspoon salt. The crab lends a sweetness to the dip. I'v also used this dip for seafood fettuccine. I just thin the dip out a bit with liquid from the clams. If it's too thin as a dip, I add more cream cheese. Even without additions I've made over the years,it is still so yummy.

This is a very easy recipe. I did double both the Worcestershire sauce and the lemon juice for a more bold flavor.
