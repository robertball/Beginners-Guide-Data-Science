With changes this recipe is very good I added seasoning salt garlic powder pepper & parmesan cheese to seasoned bread crumbs I also baked first 1/2 hr covered like a nother viewer suggested I also sprayed a little butter on after uncovering potatoes for a crispier topping cooked till tender & topped with bacon crumbs & sour cream

I had forgotten about this recipe. Thank you for reminding me how good it is. I always used Italian breadcrumbs and baked them covered for 1/2 an hr. Uncover and bake until tender. Excellent with roast turkey or chicken.

Delicious! I used Panko crumbs for the bread crumbs - added a pinch of chili powder with the paprika and other spices. I had to peel my potatoes though because they were starting to sprout. Mine were medium sized potatoes and cooked beautifully crisp in about 45 minutes. Hubby really liked these - he said that wedges would be good so you get more of the crispy coating. Next time - and there will be a next time.:)

These potatoes were great. I didn't find them bland but I added some different spices like garlic powder season salt and paprika. I am currently on the weight watchers program and with in nutritional values supplies each serving is 2 points. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was not at all what I thought it would be. It needs the salt cut in half and the texture on the outside didn't quite mesh well with the texture on the inside. My honey loves potatoes and he had some of these left on his plate. That said it all. Will not make these again.

I thought these had a nice texture and good flavor and were a nice change to standard seasoned roasted potatoes. I don't quite understand complaints that they were dry. Baked potatoes without condiments are dry. I still thought the taste was good not overwhelming didn't steal the spotlight from the main dish. Will definitely be making these again. Thanks =)

These potatoes were good. Not a whole lot to offer for flavor but go well with a main dish that has a strong flavor or gravy/sauce. I personally put sour cream on these after they were done and they were very tasty.

Nice to have a new way to serve potatoes. The crunchiness is a good foil for the glazed meatloaf recipe. I think a half teaspoon of salt would be plenty though.

Very good. I topped them with sour cream. I even had them the next day in the microwave and they were still good.

Very good--will make again. I did not think these were bland at all. However it did take quite a bit longer to cook than it says.

I made these with the Rempel Family Meatloaf recipe. We did not like these potatoes at all. Way too bland and pretty dry too. Never again will I make these.

Very tasty and a great alternative to plain baked potatoes or mashed potatoes. Only complaint was they were a little dry.

These tasty potatoes were a good alternative to all of the other methods that I've been getting tired of lately. Thanks!

Should have been called Crummy potatoes. Took way longer to bake than recipe said. Were dry and tasteless.

These were just okay. We thought they were lacking something. My husband didn't really care for them but I will try them again with some tweaking. Thanks.

I tweaked the spices some but even quartered they needed to bake about an hour and a half not an hour. I also used panko. Tasty!!!
