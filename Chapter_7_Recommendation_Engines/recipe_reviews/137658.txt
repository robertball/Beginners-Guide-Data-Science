This was pretty simple to make using my Kitchen Aid mixer. I proofed the yeast in my mixer bowl with the warm milk and sugar for ten minutes, then added the whisked egg, vanilla, and butter. After that had combined well, I added the combined flour and salt. After that had combined, I took the submitter's advice and added dried Craisins. I had to add an additional 1/2 c. flour to get the dough to jump on the hook, but once it did, I let it knead with the hook for about five minutes or so. I then let it rise in a greased metal pan on my warm oven, covered with a moist towel, for an hour. After that, I divided the bread into two loaves, rolled it out and added the butter and brown sugar. I formed it into loaves and set them in the loaf pans and covered them again with the moist towel and let them rise for a second time for about fourty-five minutes. It only needed to bake for about a half hour. I don't usually time my breads, you just kind of know after a while. They smell done. This was a fun bread to make and smells out of sight when baking. Quite the stress reliever. No way you can be upset when smelling a wonderful sweet bread baking! Thanks, Valerie. NOTE: I did use unsalted butter, lowfat buttermilk, organic flour and brown sugar Splenda. For those of you who are timid bread makers, just go for it. I used to be, but now I really enjoy making bread by hand. Use your Kitchen Aid. It cuts your work in half!

I'm the submitter of the recipe.  I'm so glad many of you have enjoyed our family recipe.  I've put practically everything under the sun in this bread!  A favorite of my family is chopped bittersweet chocolate and dried tart cherries.  It's divine.  It's also good to add cocoa to the dough to make chocolate bread.

Warm gooey goodness! This was soooo good! I about doubled the brown sugar requirement for the filling, and added walnuts and it turned out absolutely fabulous.  I would love to try the cocoa powder/butter/vanilla mixture. Or maybe sugar/orange/cranberry/pecans.

This makes the most wonderful cinnamon raisin bread! I added the dry ingredients into the wet the second time I made these and they were even better than the first loaves. I added 1 cup of soaked raisins in the last few minutes of kneading. I doubled the cinnamon sugar filling. Wow!  SO GOOD!!!

Most of my family, except my 12 year old daughter loved this!  My husband thought that it was a little dry, but otherwise good.

Being a born and bred Hungarian, I have had this before.  I did "tweak" the method a bit though.  I don't have a stand alone mixer, so I used a food processor, which meant that it didn't need as much time in kneeding.  And to help the process of rising, I used a tip which I learned while making some bread:  I put the dough in a bowl, covered it and let it rise in about six inches of warm water.  I did the same when the dough needed to rise a second time, but instead a put it in bread tins!  It really worked, and the dough was great!

This is a wonderful recipe! I cut it in half so I only made one loaf. I decided to proof my yeast for 10 minutes in the warm milk with the sugar, and it is a good thing I did that because my first pack was dead! I added the egg, vanilla, and (unsalted)butter to that, and then mixed in the flour and salt. I don't like to use a mixer when I'm only making one loaf so I kneaded my dough by hand, but besides that I followed the rest of the directions and it was done in exactly 30 minutes. I waited for it to cool and it sliced beautifully. I will  be making this again!

WOW! that is the best cinnamon bread i've ever eaten! i did use whole wheat flour instead of white- still fabulous.  the only problem i had was that it formed a "skin" on the outside while rising, but that was because i left it to rise while i was at work (a/b 3 hours or so). after i punched it down and rolled it out, it was fine though.

This is fantastic cinnamon bread.  It makes the best french toast, too.  I've received many compliments and my kids beg for me to make it.  A great comfort food for winter.  Made the dough in my breadmaker then followed rest of recipe as written.  Highly recommend.

Heaven on earth is the only way I can describe this recipe! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you! The only thing I did different was disolve the yeast in the warm milk before adding to the flour mixture.

Excellent! I used this recipe as a base. It's an extremely versatile and user friendly combination of ingredients. Out of habit, I always proof my yeast first. While that's proofing, I combine half the flour and the rest of the dry ingredients minus the salt in a stand up mixing bowl. Once proofed, I blend it with what's in the bowl and mix with a paddle attachment. Then I add the rest of the flour, the salt, and tossed in a BIG handful of quick oats and 5-6 tablespoons of wheat germ (so I wouldn't feel guilty eating it), then used the dough hook. I took suggestions from other readers and soaked 2 cups of dried cranberries and squeeze drained well. I added a shy 1/2 teaspoon of finely grated lime zest and combined with cranberries. After the first rise, I hand kneaded the berries and zest into the dough. After baking, and while the bread was still hot out of the oven, I liberally drizzled Vanilla Glaze (from this site) over both loaves and IMMEDIATELY sprinkled crushed granola into the still wet glaze. All I can say is, "WOWZA!" Thanks wisweetp for sharing your secrets for this extraordinary culinary treat!

This recipe makes a wonderful sweet dough that can  be used in many ways. The baked cinnamon loafs were delicious hot out of the oven, as well as toasted the next morning. By the suggestion of others I doubled the cinnamon and sugar for the filling. For me, the loafs still didn't have enough cinnamon flavor and will be increasing it to 4 teaspoons next time I make it. The 2/3 cups of brown sugar was perfect.  I topped the buttered loafs with raw sugar before baking to give them a nice crunch on top. Roll dough tightly to give the loafs more swirls.

Now this is good ... really, really good.  I used my bread machine to make the dough and the measurements were bang on.  No need for addtional flour or liquid, the only small change was subbing oil for the melted butter.  I did however double the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture based on other reviews.  No need to skimp on all that sugary goodness.  The other half of the dough was made into cinnamon twists, which were delicious.  Can't wait to try different variations on this perfect recipe.  Thanks for sharing wisweetp!!

Fantastic recipe- I've made it twice in three days! Doubling the cinnamon sugar filling made too much, I thought it was going to ooze out so I didn't use all of it the first time. I used a generous 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon the second time and it was perfect!

These were FANTASTIC!!!! The dough was so easy to work with and had a very nice texture to it. I did substitute oil for the butter in the bread recipe. I have used both water one time and soy milk instead of the milk in a number of different instances. Both came out great. I brushed light non-hydrogenated margerine instead of butter onto the dough, sprinkled it with a generous amount of brown sugar and cinnamon, rolled it up tightly and cut it into 1 1/2 inch slices and placed them into well sprayed muffin tins to rise for 35 minutes. I brushed the tops with an egg wash and baked it for about 12-15 minutes -  DELICIOUS!!!!!

The only thing that should change about this recipe is the use of "stars" for rating.  It should be little pants.  How many pant sizes do you think you'll go up after making this recipe!  If you make it once, you WILL make it again, and again, and again.  DELICIOUS!  I made it for dinner, and my husband has already called dibs on the remaining slices for his breakfast.

I followed the recipe exactly and after hours and hours the dough did not rise properly the second time.  I baked it and found it too be dense to the point of inedible...two loaves for the garbage can!

I made this over the weekend.  I had a few problems. Maybe somebody here has some suggestions?  First, I halved the recipe. It did not rise as quickly as I expected, it took well over one and a half hours to double. My yeast is new and alive, I've used it in other recipes with good results in recent days. Also I kept the rising dough in a warmish, draft-free place. Should I have INCREASED the yeast, even though I halved everything else?  The layers separated while baking, so I was left with big gaps in the swirl. It was tasty, but dry.  So what can I do next time to:  1) make it rise in a more timely fashion 2) not separate 3) be less dry and more moist?  Thanks, all suggestions welcome!

This was recommended to me on the Recipe Exchange this morning, and now, after eating several slices slathered with butter, I can add my five stars to this one.  I pretty much did what tat2whttrsh did except that I used 2 cups of all-purpose and 2 cups of white whole wheat flour, and I added raisins to the filling.  I know my hubby will love this toasted tomorrow morning.  I'm also wondering if maybe this will change my granddaughters' tastes regarding raisins!  Thanks, Nuggets, for recommending this to me!

This was great! I doubled the cinnamon sugar filling this time and I still feel like it could have a little more but definitely delicious as is. Thanks! Oh and I did have to add about 1/4c flour just to get it too sort of come together (it was still very sticky and loose) but made for the most moist and delicious finished bread.

I doubled the amount of filling and kneaded about 1 cup of raisin into the dough. I didn't have a stand mixer and got a pretty good workout kneading the dough for 5 minutes. :) Everyone in my family loved this bread. Next time I'll try to use less butter and double the amount of cinnamon but not sugar in the filling, to cut down the calories.

Second time making this. I didn't alter it other than to make one with cinnamon and the other with the cocoa powder both using 1/3c brown sugar. I love how soft this bread is even when using fresh grd whole wheat flour.

Made this twice now, and it's a keeper. Used 1/2 whole wheat flour to make it a bit healthier. Used breadmaker to make the dough - so easy!

This smelled so good while baking and my husband I I couldn't help but eat half of the first loaf when it came out!  I made it in my bread machine on dough cycle and then rolled it out and doubled up on the filling.  I put both loaves to rise and they rose up very nicely before baking!  So good, I am making these for holiday goodie baskets.

I've noticed Summer bread baking, leaves my loaves smaller than in cooler months, since my house is air conditioned, it effects rise. This recipe was no exception, but I tried it anyway. First rise went great when I put it in the microwave with a preboiled cup of water to keep the heat contained. But second rise was not as full, even after almost 2 hours. But the flavor of this bread far outweighed the rise disappointment (not recipe error just housing conditions) I know this recipe will do just fine later in the season when my house is more suitable to nurture this eloquent bread.

This bread is amazing! will be making often! I read the reviews first so I made a couple of changes based on what I read read. First I used 1/2 bread flour, 1/2 all purpose. the bread was light and fluffy will do that from now on., second I used 1/3 cup sugar in the dough itself, as some people said it wasn't sweet enough. I think it made it too sweet. will use only the 1/4 cup as recipe states. I doubled the filling recipe but trippled the cinnamon. was so good. I also soaked 2 cups of raisins and added them to the dough.

This is a nice bread, but for us, nothing exciting.  To be fair, I really wanted to add raisins but didn't have any and I think that would've made a huge difference.  I increased the cinnamon/sugar amounts almost by 3 and there still just isn't alot of flavor to this bread.  Nice texture though.

Excellent bread.  I used bread flour, added raisins and baked it free form because I wanted a more rustic, chewy bread and it came out perfect.  This was so good.  I’m sure this will be excellent for French toast too.

Really great recipe.  I sub'd 2 cups of wheat flour for white, and bread was still really tender.  The cinnamon/sugar mixture baked out a bit, but I think that may have been my fault for not tightening up the loaf before baking.  I also decreased the oven temperature to 325 and baked for 25 minutes, because my loaf pans are dark (ie not glass).

The day after baking, this bread takes on this really delicious crusty flakey texture on the outside, but still so soft on the inside from all that wonderful sugar and cinnamon. I didn't double the amount of filling, but I didn't measure it either. I mixed and matched until it looked and tasted right to me. Already have requests for more.

This was very good bread!  I layered in dried cranberries and toasted walnuts with the brown sugar mixture.  In retrospect, I would have mixed them into the dough as when slicing the tended to fall out.  Will definitely make this bread again!  Oh, and I used half whole wheat flour which I think gave it a good heartiness without being too heavy.

This bread is quite delicious. I made it two days ago and I think it is even better leftover and toasted. The only problem I had was that midway through the baking, one of the rolls opened up and started leaking some filling, but it was very easy to pinch back together. Just check on it periodically through the baking.

Very good!  I overbaked it a bit, but it's bc I had to have bf turn off the oven and he just left it in the oven after turning off.  So completely our fault, but still very lovely bread.  I doubled the cinnamon filling and would do that the same next time.  This would also be lovely with nuts or raisins. Very pretty as well.    Thanks for the recipe!

Mixed feelings on this recipe. For some reason I can never get the dough to rise. I have tried multiple times now and I always get the same result. This latest time I used advice from other reviewers and proofed the yeast first. The dough again did not rise at all. Oddly, the bread while not as full as it should be always turns out delicious. I would have the agree that the overall taste is the best cinnamon bread I have ever had. I am not using a mixer (all by hand), so maybe that is where my problem is?

How can a recipe that's rated 5 stars by so many be bad?

I followed this recipe exactly except I used bread flour and doubled the amount of brown sugar and cinnamon filing. This bread was amazing. It tasted kinda like a cinnamon roll minus the icing. This bread makes great toast also. Don't bother trying to halve this recipe. You'll want both loaves! 

I also bakes at 325 instead of 350 for only 25 minutes because I used dark metal bread pans. 

Excellent bread. I'll be making this bread often. My entire family loved it.

Very good bread and easy to make.  I used 3 cups ap flour and 1 cup whole wheat just to make it a little different.  I proofed the yeast in the milk with sugar and then placed everything in my kitchen aid to mix.  I added some walnuts to the filling and it tasted very good!  I will keep this recipe and make again!

This was excellent.  I used 1/2 bread flour and 1/2 fresh ground flour.  Mine took closer to an hour for the second rising but turned out delicious!  Soft and tender with a nice soft crust.  I added raisins, but I might try some nuts next time.  Can't wait for our morning toast.  Yum.

I kept pretty much everything the same for this recipe, with a few exceptions. 1) I doubled the brown sugar/cinnamon filling and  2) added 1/2 cup raisins (so 1/4 C raisins per loaf) that I soaked in water that had cinnamon, cloves, and allspice so they were nice and plump.  Also I would suggest rolling these loaves very tightly, otherwise when they rise and are baked, there are big hollow gaps between  the layers.

Really really yummy!!  Just a few changes based on some other reviews, proofed yeast in milk, then added the dry to wet ingredients.  Also used 1/2 c Brown Sugar & 2 tsp of cinnamon  for the filling.  Just a personal preference.  This is soooo good! I had a hard time choosing which Cinnamon type of bread I wanted to make.  I'm REALLY happy I made this one! Give it a try! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was perfect. Very esy to make. I let mine rise at about 75 degrees. The dough was very moist yet fluffy, and it tasted like cinnamon rolls! I brushed the loaves again with melted butter fresh out of the oven, which gave them a pretty sheen and took care of any dryness they might have had.

I'm rating 3 stars because the dough was just so difficult to work with.  The end result was pretty good although a little on the dry side.  If I tried again I'd be inclined to add a bit more liquid and I might try it in my bread machine.  My son is gobbling it up but I wasn't thrilled with the end product.

It was super good and I enjoyed having fresh bread that wasn't very difficult to make. I did cook it longer than the recipe asked for to make it golden brown.

I made this today following the recipe exactly but added candied pecans to the center before rolling. If learned that using a sifter to distribute the sugar mixes helps to distribute evenly (my mom would be proud).  I used the bread machine on the dough setting and then transferred to pan (note the singular) after filling and rolling. I totally blanked and forgot to split this into two rolls, adding the entire batch to a 1-1/2 lb. loaf pan. Fortunately, it turned out awesome - big, but awesome.

It was so good. First bread I made and I did double the brown sugar and cinnamon and it turned out great. For yeast best to use warm milk like you would fix for a baby. If it is to hot the yeast won't set. My mom told me that bit of advice and it really works well. I also tempered the eggs into butter to make sure I did not end up making scramble eggs.

Very easy to make and it is great right out of the oven. It also makes great french toast because it is a slightly dense bread.

Fantastic. We did double the cinnamon & brown sugar, but next time we'll triple the cinnamon for our preference. May try adding diced raisins as others suggested.  Haven't tried yet toasting, but hope to.

Wow, so good! Made this as written but used my bread machine for kneading only. I made only one loaf just for to try out and wished we had doubled the brown sugar mixture, but it's still lovely as is. They're best eaten right out of the oven when they are still hot.

WOW, this was really great. As per many reviews, I doubled the filling and added apples. When done cooking, I sliced in the pan and poured hot vanilla glaze between slices and on top... A-MA-ZING!!!

This is a great cinnamon bread recipe, its very forgiving. I did proof the yeast before adding all the other ingredients and doubled the cinnamon brown sugar mix. I will be using this as my to go to cinnamon bread recipe from now on, would also like to try this recipe out as cinnamon buns.

My husband made this by hand and we used the cinnamon sugar I had mixed up some time before. We omitted the raisins and halved the recipe to make one loaf. Other than that, we stuck closely to the recipe and we enjoyed it very much, although my husband said he would use much more cinnamon sugar filling than called for (he loves sweets!). Definitely is a good base for all kinds of variations. Thank you for a great and versatile recipe!

I made the dough in my bread machine. I used 1/4 cup more sugar then suggested because I was making it for a craft fair and wanted the bread itself to be sweet, not just the cinnamon mixture. I also cut them into peices after rolling it tightly and placed it into lined cupcake tins. They were perfect! I have never attempted "cinnamon rolls" before, and I probably never will now. This was just too perfect. :) I'm making them again to take on a family road trip. :)

I made this bread this morning and it could not be any easier. The trick the other poster mentioned about letting it rise in the oven, with the light on, is great! I did not proof the yeast , just mixed it with all the other dry ingredients and it rose beautifully. I did experiment a bit and added chopped bittersweet chocolate to one loaf along with the cinnamon mixture. To die for!  I did double the amount  for the sugar-cinnamon mixture--2/3 cup brown sugar and 1and 1/2 tsp.cinnamon. It was the perfect amount for my taste. Oh my, wait until your kitchen starts to smell with the aroma of this bread.  I definitely want to make French toast with the raisin loaf. I really don't know how our mothers and grandmothers existed without stand mixers with dough hooks---glad I have one!

I'm a bread novice with a couple of failures under my belt, but I gave this one a shot anyway and it not only turned out, but it is *amazing bread.* So, so, so very yummy! Like many others, I proofed the yeast with the warm milk and sugar first (it was a month past its expiration date, so I wanted to make sure it did its thing!) and added about a cup of dried cranberries. I also used 3 c. of bread flour and 1 c. of whole wheat flour. And doubled the filling. Thank you, wisweetp for an amazing recipe!

Delicious!  And the combination of the brown sugar & cinnamon warm and dripping in the center just added that special touch to the flavorful bread.  I used a small-mixer dough hook to knead, so did it without a bread machine. I ended up leaving it to rise double the time too.  Soooo glad i ran into this recipe!

Delicious!  It seems that our kids are asking to make this together every weekend.  We double the recipe now so that it isn't gone before it's even cooled down.  Our only edits to the recipe are throwing a teaspoon of cinnamon into the dough itself and adding twice amount of sugar / cinnamon filling.  Of course the extra filling created a blow-out in the oven on the first attempt,  so we only spread the filling about 3/4 of the way across the flattened dough prior to rolling.  That keeps the cinnamon swirl inside the bread pretty well.  Just for fun we cook it in our solar oven.  It still gets nice and brown and doesn’t heat up the house in the summer, but takes about 50% longer. Really moist bread.

This is the best!!! Have made it twice and came out perfect both times. Followed the recipe exactly as is...didn't have a loaf pan so just covered my baking tray with foil paper and it worked just fine. Tastes divine toasted with butter!

Very good recipe.  Made dough in breadmaker and then baked in oven.  I took the suggestions of other raters and doubled the filling.  I also added almond slivers and grated semi-sweet chocolate to the filling.  Yummy.  The only issue is that I had to add 10min to cooking time even though it was in a convection oven.

This recipe is amazing! After I proofed the yeast with the sugar and warm milk, I added the rest of the wet ingredients together and mixed well.  I then mixed the flour and salt and added that to the wet ingredients.  At this point I added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to the dough before mixing and allowing it to rise.  I only had one glass baking dish, so I used a metal one as well.  Both loaves turned out great and I didn't adjust the time for either.  Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I made this wonderful recipe and it is all everyone said it would be.  However, unless my yeast is getting old, I would add 2 T. Yeast as it did not rise very well.  If you look at the picture of the bread, it is rather flat.  I think this addition will do the trick.  Wonderful flavour with added raisins.

This bread is DELICIOUS! The only change I made was to double the filling and lightly brush the loaves with melted butter once they're out of the oven to help keep the tops from being too dry. Wonderful!

I made one cocoa & one brown sugar cinnamon (no raisins). My boyfriend loved them both, but loved the cocoa the most. I used ? cup sugar & 1 teaspoon cocoa for the filling. I then used some of the filling & sprinkled it on top after brushing with butter before baking. Yummy!!

I've just made this bread for about the 100th time, so it is most certainly a go to for me. my husband says my learning to bake, and specifically THIS recipe, is the reason he proposed.  I follow the dough recipe as written (though I've tried combinations of whole wheat and white flour in the past) and use pecans, dried cherries and dried dates in the center with the cinnamon and butter.  this bread makes amazing French toast, as well!  Thank you for the recipe - AND the wonderful husband!!!!

Wonderful bread! My only problem was that in baking, a huge gap developed between the outer two layers of bread. Maybe too much butter in the filling?
I made on with a dark chocolate, coconut cranberry combination that I blended together first

Made this twice already.  First time, prepared as directed.  Excellent but in my opinion needed something more.  2nd time added cut up apples and raisins.  Recipe makes 2 nice sized loafs.  2nd time around made half recipe into a loaf, and 2nd half  cut into  9 very nice sized rolls.  Dough seems very forgiving but needs extra time for 2nd proof with addition of fruit.  Next time will try cranberries.

super easy and cute bread recipe, definitely wouldn't put too much if any butter on the loaf until almost baked. otherwise makes great toast or french toast ?? I did let the yeast activate for a few minutes as suggested.

I made this with a swirl of valhrona & regular cocoa powder, brown sugar and butter. I also added about 4 ounces of diced marzipan to the swirl. Amazing soft moist bread with a nice medium crumb. Very easy to put together in the stand mixer, dough rises high and rolls out without difficulties. Sliced it while still warm and it was divine! Good recipe!

This is wonderful!!!!  I had this several times in Hungary and this is pretty close to what I had there.  Like she said, the vanilla isn't usually put in the dough, but it's real good!

I've had this several different ways.  The sweet filling varies - but my most favorite is the poppy seed!  You can get a can of that pie filling (just about the same) and spread that on.  There's also a hazelnut spread and a walnut spread.  

Try it - it is a long process, but it's worth it!

It is easy. Nice texture. Flexible as far as fillings that would go nicely-or no fillings at all.

This is soooooo good! I added dried cranberries with the brown sugar and cinnamon. With half of the dough, I rolled it but instead of just putting in the oven, I cut it up like cinnamon rolls. They turned out great!

Very easy and delicious bread! Next time I'll go heavier on the layer of cinnamon, just my preference. No butter on top of our bread in the oven though- I  egg wash the top before baking-makes a nice golden glossy top. Great recipe! Thanks!

this is ok,  it looks great but the taste was bland.  I think if I make it again I would add more cinn/brown sugar mixture and I would add raisins.

To the reviewer who said this is 'heaven on earth', you were 100% correct! That's exactly what it is. So easy, sooooo tasty. I'm making my second batch this weekend. I doubled the brown sugar and cinnamon as others suggested. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

I followed the instructions that Sarah Jo listed in her review, and this recipe turned out to be amazing. My family absolutely loved it - not too sweet and the perfext amount of cinnamon. I am looking forward to try using cocoa as an alternative.

I wasn't impressed, bread didn't hold together well when baked due to filling, it seemed to unwind and make impossible to toast.

I've been looking for a great and easy bread recipe that is versatile, and have found it!  I've made this recipe twice now, both times making only one loaf Cinnamon, the other plain, by omitting the cinnamon and brown sugar step.  The family devours it every time!  I think this dough would also make great dinner rolls or sweet rolls, and plan on trying that next time.  Thanks for submitting it!

We love this recipe, and today I'm sharing it with my mom.  We are making Christmas cookies...and a little Christmas bread.  Thank you for sharing all the variations your family enjoys, especially the dark chocolate and cherries.  One of our loaves will be just as you described !

Great recipe - super easy to follow for a first time bread maker!! I did double the filling as others had recommended and used some whole wheat flour as well as all-purpose ~ it was perfect.  YUMMY!!

this bread is AMAZING. i made it according to sarah jo's review (in a kitchen aid) and there was something i was wondering, would it be possible for me to make it in two separate steps?  could i make it the night before and let it rise for the first and second time and put it in the fridge and then take it out and bake it the next morning (and would i have to let it come to room temp. first?). Or could i make it the night before and let it rise the first time and then put it in the fridge and then take it out the next morning and let it come to room temp and rise for the second time and bake it. hope this makes sense!

This bread turned out perfect.  It was not overly sweet and unlike many homemade breads and stayed soft for as many days as it lasted at our house.  This bread was very popular with my family.

I haven' made this yet-- hopefully next week- but wanted to ask a question... can this bread be made rolled as one longer thinner loaf, rather than a bread pan shape? Baked on a cookie sheet? l am tring to (attempt) to duplicate a rolled bread my motherinlaw used to make every year. She passed away & of course- recipe was never written. She made a nut roll and a prune jelly roll- long and not as fat as a bread pan bread. I am hoping this fits the bill as a "new tradition" in our family and want to surprise everyone at Christmas.  I think making it as you state with cinnamon or cocoa will be a nice update. Thanks in advance for any advice you may have. My MIL was of HUngarian descent which is why I think this could be it ! I gave 5 stars  as I know this will be good ; ). I'm especially eager to try it as french toast...yummm

I have never had the knack for kneading dough, so my breadmaker saves me!  I use it to mix, knead and raise the dough then remove it to pans to bake in the oven. I used quick rising yeast - this recipe turned out beautifully, it was very light and fluffy, just sweet enough. I'm looking forward to making again and trying out some of the variations suggested.  Excellent!

Excellent recipe.  After making this it transported me back to my childhood and the special days that my Grandmother would make home made cinnamon buns.  Due to personal preference only, I changed up the recipe by using bread flour instead of all purpose flour and feel that it gives the bread a "fluffier" texture.  I think all purpose flour will be just fine though.  I did follow another user's suggestion to proof the yeast first.  Allow it to dissolve.  I proofed my yeast by melting the butter and warming the milk at the same time and making sure that before I added the yeast that the liquids had time to cool to just above room temperature (no hotter than 115 degrees and no cooler than 80 degrees to have optimum temperatures for the yeast to perform properly).  While the yeast was proofing I put the flour in the mixer and added the sugar and salt.  After proofing the yeast, I added the egg and vanilla and wisked as instructed then added the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients.  Then followed the recipe the rest of the way.
*Hint*  Do not skimp on the filling, it's better with as much of the butter/cinnamon/brown sugar as you can get in it.  5 Stars all the way, thank you for the great recipe.

I have been making bread for about 10 years now and OMG this is one of the best I've ever made.  I made it exactly as stated (except I did add the yeast to the milk) and since I don't have a stand mixer I kneaded it all by hand.  I had to add a little more milk to get the dough really elastic, probably because I live in a dry climate, AZ.  I also thought the amount of filling called for was just right--I didn't double it.  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Wonderful bread!  I added 2 Tablespoons of cinnamon to the dough, but other than that followed the recipe.  Tasted awesome!  Definitely will be making this again.  I mixed this in my bread machine through the dough cycle.  Formed it into a loaf, let it rise, and it was perfect!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe! I followed it nearly exactly - the changes I made were: 1) I proofed my yeast (milk+yeast+2 heaping tbsp sugar). 2) I increased the sugar amount in the dough to 1/3 cup total and the sweetness was JUST RIGHT! 3) I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the dough itself 4) I added chopped walnuts and raisins (the walnuts added a delicious crunchiness and the raisins added some additional sweetness). Everything else was done exactly as the recipe dictates. This bread is phenomenal - mine wasn't dry at all! and I adore the thin crust and great flavor! 10 stars!

this is SO delicious!  I did have to add about 3/4 more flour than called for in order for it not to be gooey.  It turned out perfect.  Warm, moist, heavenly.  Will make again!

The only deviations I made from this recipe were to let the bread rise a little longer each time, and to replace half the AP Flour with Whole Wheat-- and it turned out FANTASTICALLY. This is so simple and foolproof! Thank you wisweetp!

Delicious! Followed suggestions below to add more cinnamon. The amount of flour specified was enough for me - but other reviewers put more. I used a stand mixer to knead the dough and it came out great when I mixed dry into wet about 1/2 cup of flour at a time to get a good consistency.

I'm eating it as I type, absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS, although next time I'm going to almost double the cinnamon and brown sugar and make it thinner so there's more swirls. Not to mention Quadrupling the recipe, I took them out of the over less than ten minutes ago and they're gone!  Yum :)

these are really tasty, but I don't think the cook time is accurate. Next time I make these I will put them in the oven for less time.

I used bread flour instead of all purpose and kneaded the dough by hand. It came out wonderful! Thank you!

Absolutely delicious! My Hungarian grandmother is a tough critic, and she quite enjoyed it. I ran out of butter (guess I should have checked before hand...) and finished with applesauce- couldn't taste the difference. The only negative thing (if you could call it that) is that the bread needed a good 5-10 minutes more in the oven. Overall, gooey goodness! Both loaves disappeared within hours!
