EXCELLENT! My teenage son ate 4 (yes, that's a four) bowls of this for dinner tonight. Each bowl got a comment:
Bowl 1) Wow Mom, that is really good!
Bowl 2) Does Grammie know how to make this? (he's going to visit soon) You should teach her.
Bowl 3) Mom, can we have this every night when we go skiing?
Bowl 4) Man Mom, I think this is better than you and Grammie's Cheesy Potato Soup. We need to have this again.

So, a success would you say? Yes, please, and thank you!

This recipe is very similar to the others here on AR. The two changes I made was use Better than Bouillon ® instead of a bouillon cubes, and cut the water and cream in half. (I like my  soups and stews chunky.)  Still very good but a bit salty for my taste. I will use some  chicken broth in place of some of the bouillon base next time to better control the salt level.

OG = Olive Garden :) It was delicious and I loved the addition of the cream! I used red potatoes because it was what I had, and they were perfect, too.

Great soup, but we don't go to the trouble of cooking everything separately, and made a couple of changes.  We cook the bacon first, then remove it from the pot.  Then add the sausage and red pepper flakes and let it cook in the bacon fat.  Then we add the onions and garlic to the sausage, then we add 4 cups chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon cubes, along with the potatoes and kale, and also add a parmesan rind (MAKES IT!).  Then we do the heavy cream at the end.  Great base recipe, but a couple of minor changes make all the difference!

OG uses equal parts beef and sausage. Half milk half water and I don’t remember bacon being in the OG recipe but I do love bacon half of a stick of butter. Otherwise this was a spot on recipe. This is a substantial food source. Proteins, fats and greens!!

Easy recipe.  Easy to follow.  I didn’t have bouillon cubes but I had leftover chicken and beef broth in the fridge, 2 cups each and the remainder I used water.  I left my bacon in bigger chunks because I forgot to crumble them. Lol But hey we all need more bacon in our lives.  Great recipe!

This is exactly how I make my Zuppa Toscana. After serving finish with fresh parmesan or Romano cheese and fresh cracked pepper. I love serving it with homemade bread also.

Universal approval from my picky eaters. The pickiest said, "I don't love the sausage, but it's good enough to eat." And that is HIGH praise.
I used chicken stock instead of bouillon cubes. I think the pureed garlic is an unnecessary step unless you already have some, but I did it just in case.

Oh this is outrageously good! I also cut back on the water (6-7 cups) and used fresh spinach instead of kale and it was outstanding!  Just the right amount of heat to give it a slight kick.  A great addition to your soup collection, as it's a great change from the ordinary! We got four servings from this.

Made this tonight and it was amazing. I used Italian seasonings and sage in the sausage. I’m not an onion person so no onions. This turned out great!

This is divine! I first had at at friends and I’ve been craving it so I made it today and it turned out great. A little spicy with the red pepper flakes, I love it but I should have added less if I wanted my kids to eat it.

It's very good, but felt like it needed more salt or bouillion. Instead of using the pepper flakes I used spicy Italian sausage because we love Italian sausage.  If you are in a hurry I would have the potatoes cooking in one pan and the sausage and or bacon/onions cooking in another pan so that you don't have to wait on the potatoes.

This was way too watery for my liking. I would take out about 2 cups of water. It was also too spicy hot for my taste. I would use half or less of the crushed red pepper. In addition I think I would use country sausage instead of Italian sausage to cut down on the heat factor.

Instead of adding the kale to the whole pot, I added to the bowl and let it sit for about 3 to 5 mins with a lid over it to cook. I divided up the rest of the soup into smaller portions and refrigerated.  As I take out a container,  I reheat the soup and add the kale to get that fresh lightly crunch to the soup.

I used the small fancy potatoes that many stores sell now.  I used purple and gold, but they come in many varieties.   It is important to either use sausage that is not in a casing or remove it from the casing, as cooking the sausage and then slicing it didn't work as well.   I used Wrights bacon which is very lean and cut in 1 inch strips to make the soup extra hearty.  My husband and stepson loved it!

I threw in a handful of spinach, doubled the Kale and sprinkled in a dash of cayenne pepper.  Served it with fresh grated parmesan and salt/pepper!  SOOOOOO good! My husband is still talking about it so I'm making it again today!!!

Definitely making this one again. I used one box of reduced sodium chicken stock and 6 cups water instead of bullion but otherwise followed the recipe. It was spicy which we like but I would reduce red pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon if cooking for folks that don’t like spicy foods.

Delicious! I did only add 5 cups chicken broth and 2 TB flour because I like thicker soups but the taste was AMAZING

This is a new hit with my family. After prep it is dead easy to make. I have moved far from any OG locations and it’s been a decade since I’ve had it, this literally flew me back into time, awaking memories with old friends who we used to go with for their all you can eat soup/salad deal. 
This is a new favourite go to soup.

Amazing!  My family doesn't like onions or kale so I left them out and only added fresh spinach to my bowl when serving.  With some buttered crusty bread to dip in the soup it was delicious!

I combined parts of this recipe with parts from the Pioneer Woman recipe. I made my own chicken broth with better than boullion. I used 2 cups of that broth, 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 3 cups of skim milk to cut the calories a bit. I did use the turkey bacon but I made it ahead of time and mixed it in with the sausage, onion, garlic. I added dried oregano and black pepper to taste. Always a pinch of salt here and there. I did use the russet potatoes but I sliced them rather than in chunks. This taste IDENTICAL to the original thing!! My husband was very impressed as this is his favorite soup!!

It was good but not great. A little bland for my taste, but my wife and daughter loved it. I did make one change, and that was spinach instead of kale. Only because my family is not a fan of kale. We are firm believers that kale is a salad bar garnish that is not to be eaten. Just our opinion, you do you.

Excellent recipe.  Used low sodium chicken stock  instead of bouillon cubes/water and added  sliced mushrooms, sautéed in garlic and butter. 
Absolutely delicious - made this for a party and was a big hit! Will definitely make this again.

This soup was amazing!  It was even better than Olive Garden because I controlled the amount of ingredients that went in it. Ours had lots more meat than what you get in the restaurant!  It was so good I’ll be making it every week!

Great recipe!! Tastes just like the OG soup. Do not have a heavy hand on the red pepper flakes if spicy is not what you want. Will make this one again. I used half & half instead of whipping cream.

My neighbor used to make her version and I loved it so I came across this recipe and wanted to give it a try.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It turned out really good but next time I would not add so many red pepper flakes, especially if you are feeding children.  Also I would add a few more potatoes.  I had leftover soup without potatoes.  Overall it was very tasty.  Thanks!

Excellent soup on a cold night.  Tastes exactly like OG but by making it myself, I was able to provide more ingredients to each bowl.  OG provides a lot of broth and very little ingredients and I get it but by making it myself, I was able to provide this soup as a meal.  So tasty.

Both my husband and I enjoyed this soup. The only change I made was that I decreased the red pepper flakes to 1 tsp.  May even go a bit less next time.  Also was considering the next time  eliminating the red pepper flakes altogether and using “hot” ground sausage.

I made this and it was a big hit. I did add more of the heavy cream than the recipe called for to give it a more creamy flavor which my family prefers. Will be definitely making it again and again.

My fav soup at "OG"! I thought the soup was GREAT although I made several slight changes ... don't hate me. I don't like ingredients to be listed without more precise measurements, of which this recipe has several. Who wants to weigh potatoes? I used 5 cups diced Idaho.  1/4 bunch kale. I used 7 cups of cut kale from a bag, which was a nice amount. For the onion I used 2 cups diced SWEET onion. I used bulk Italian sausage, fresh garlic and substituted 64 of the 80 oz of water with chicken stock and mixed the remaining 16 oz water with 4 teas chicken base (instead of bouillon).  And ya just gotta have Parmesan sprinkled on top at serving! I can't stand it when people review a recipe they have totally changed!

I added fennel to the sausage as I browned it for additional flavor.  Also suggest cubing bacon frozen before cooking i.e. easier to cut up.  I used cracked pepper bacon to add flavor.  Would also suggest cooking bacon separately to render it  crispy and to avoid burning the garlic.   Did not have any heavy  whipping cream on hand, so I substituted with regular milk.  Worked just as well.  "OMG" OG Good!

I used mostly chicken stock rather than water. I also used spicy italian sausage and left out the  pepper flakes.  I am not a fan of Kale so I used swiss chard instead. With these few changes the soup turned out very good.

Excellent soup, will certainly make again!!  The only thing I changed was not using the red pepper flakes, as my wife thinks anything like that is unbearable hot!   I did add my own flakes to the soup.  Very good, very good!

I have never had this soup at OG so I can’t compare mine to the original.  I didn’t add the hot pepper flakes as I have an issue with “spicy” but I followed the recipe and while I thought the broth was very good the kale never really seemed cooked after 15 minutes and by that time the sausage was overcooked.  The recipe called for the potatoes to be “diced” but it seemed they should have been larger to add to the soup (the picture seems to show them being bigger).  All in all, I think the ingredients are good but the recipe itself needs to be reworked.

Didn't  have cream so used whole milk, other wise followed recipe and it was delicious! However it is too salty for my low salt diet, so next time I will use reduced sodium broth, and also will check to see if I can find reduced sodium bacon and sausage.

Didn't turn out quite how I hoped, but still very tasty. I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted milk and butter, but I may have gotten the measurement wrong. I also used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon. I also added a carrot and green onions. If you like crispy bacon, I would suggest cooking the bacon separate, because it did not crisp up at all in the pan with the onion.

Love this soup! I don't eat pork, so I make my own spicy  Italian sausage from ground turkey. And I leave out the bacon. I do however,  use turkey bacon in recipes if I have it on hand.. I added a little shredded carrot for color too. Great soup whether you make it with make it using kale or spinage!

This is our favorite soup. I took it to a potluck New Year’s Eve and it was enjoyed by all. One gal said it’s her favorite at Olive Garden & this was exactly like it. I make huge batches & freeze them in quart jars. It’s the perfect meal for my husband and me.

I've made this soup for a few years now, but no red pepper flakes. In fact we had it tonight. I use low, or sodium free, chicken broth & more potatoes & kale than this recipe calls for. For a thicker broth I add potato flakes just a few minutes before it's done. So delicious & warming. My husbands favorite cold weather dinner.

I use  mild sausage and less red pepper (1/2 tsp). I use baby spinach rather than kale. I brown the potato cubes. It is better than the restaurant item.

This recipe tops our local Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscana!! I double or triple this recipe and there's plenty of meat and veggies with this recipe (unlike OG), and we prefer whipping cream over 1/2 & 1/2.

More red pepper flakes, also 1/2 lb Italian sausage and 1/2 lb hot Italian sausage. We make a double batch for the 2 of us, and will eat it night and day. Addictive !!!!

This was a wonderful recipe tastes great easy to make. I halved the amount of red pepper flakes ( due to a spice sensitivity)  and i used a regular almond milk all I had for non dairy cream.

I've made this several times and it is always good.  I really like soups in the Tuscan style and this one doesn't disappoint.  I'm reviewing it now because I've strayed from the recipe and it turned out really well, so I thought I'd offer the modification.  I replaced the potatoes with about a cup of lentils, the kale with about a pound of brussels sprouts, the water and bullion with homemade chicken broth, and the cream with buttermilk. I put the brussels sprouts, cleaned and halved, in on top of the onion/garlic/bacon/sausage mixture with a cup of chicken broth.  I let that cook until the brussels sprouts were softened some, then added the remainder of the broth and the lentils.  I boiled that at barely a boil for 20 minutes to cook the lentils then added the buttermilk.  We really liked it.
