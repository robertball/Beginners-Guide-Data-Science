I am Russian and indeed this salad is very popular in my country. But there are couple of things we do differently: we grate potatoes and eggs after they are boiled, first goes salmon, then potatoes, whites, then yolks. Mayo between each layer and no mayo on the top! In my family we also add boiled and grated carrots on top of the salmon (by the way, i prefer to canned in oil - it's juicier). Some families also put steamed rice in between. This salad is called "mimoza".

This is very good! My mom is russian and she makes this salad with tuna, plus she adds some grated cheese layer to it, but it's also very good with salmon!

This is so good.  I actually used 5 eggs, so that eggs would cover the whole layer of potatoes, without potatoes being visible. The only thing I would probably change is adding some salt and pepper over potatoes for a little more to it. thank you JMRIBKA. I'll be looking at your other recipes.

I invited a Russian gentleman to dinner, honoring him by cooking a Russian menu. I found 3 recipes on the web. This was exquisite! I chilled it for about 3 hours. It was excellent the next day for breakfast and again for diner.  It served 8.  The man said it was very authentic. I recommend it HIGHLY. We had it with a Russian Tomato Salad and Roasted Lamb leg with Artichokes. All 3 were a huge hit!!!

Absolutely wonderful! I live in Russia and served this for a party. It was the first salad to go! I used tuna instead of salmon. Our mayo comes in squeeze bags so it was easy to apply it in pretty spirals.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and made more eggs. 5 was just enough for me to cover the top layer with thin slices. I also added salt & pepper to the potato layer as other reviewers suggested. For presentation purposes, I finely shredded a mild, white cheese and put it around the edge of my round dish.

This is a very nice flavour combination. Next time, I think I'll try shredding or even mashing the potatoes and mixing that layer with mayo before laying it. I also think I'll crumble up the egg rather than slicing it as was suggested by some other reviews. When I lived in Russia that seemed to be the common thing to do and it holds together better that way when you serve it. Thanks for the recipe!

I mixed the sauteed onions, salmon, potatoes and mayo together, then served on lettuce with the sliced eggs. Great flavor! Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good, and popular with guests.  I will make it again.  One problem was the quality of the canned salmon.  I didn't expect to have to pick out bones.  (Bumblebee pink salmon).  I will try to find a higher quality product to use in the future, because I was worried that bones would slip by me and cause problems for my guests.

The sauteed onions make this very tasty indeed.  A nice, simple, delicious salad.  Wonderful luncheon dish.  Serve with crusty bread and follow with sliced fresh peaches in champagne.

This was delicious. I am always looking for ways to eat more salmon because it is so good for you!
I used vaccume packed salmon and seasoned liberally with salt and pepper at each layer.
It was simple easy and tasty. Read entire instructions before making.
I give it 4 and a 1/2 stars.

I made this for my Russian husband and he really liked it. This type of salad can be made in so many different ways by Russians, but this particular recipe is delicious just the way it is. Thanks for sharing your version JMRIBKA, I have made it a few times already. :-)

This recipe has become a favourite in our household. Whenever we go to a bbq I take this dish and its always the first one gone, just like JMRIBKA says.
Like another reviewer mentioned, I do more eggs so it completely covers the top.

this turned out very well, very simple to make.  i mixed the mayo with the potato before i layered it, and did the same thing with the egg (to save time!)  it might not be as authentic, but i felt it helped mix the flavours more.  definitely needs salt and pepper

I had left over salmon from last night. So, I had all the ingredients for this simple salad and it was great. The potatoes really balance the strong salmon flavor, which I am not a fan of. I added crushed pepper to the onions for a little kick. Glad I found this recipe.

Not as much onion or mayo. (Put garlic powder and salt and pepper in the mayo).

I made this for dinner tonight and we both enjoyed it very much. I ran out of mayo and used low fat sour cream to help stretch the mayo that I had. Also added dill to the dressing and garlic powder. It is a nice Lenten meal with a veggie side and a little apple sauce. We are looking forward to the leftovers.

It had a very good flavor- a little drier than I was expecting, though.

I made this for the first time and it was delicious, but needed a bit more acidity so I added diced picke and that really made it perfect.

I added a heaping Tbs oh Dijon mustard to the mayonnaise, and additional thee eggs. I cooked the potatoes and the eggs together in an electric pressure cooker for 4 minutes, putting the eggs in an ice water bath immediately. Diced one egg and distributed in the onion layer. The other extra egg was diced and used as the crown. Every morsel was eaten and pleas to make it again were made. I am sure it will be a family favorite.

I loved this salad. I used five eggs and layered it as follows:
Salmon, half sautéed onions, mayo, potatoes with salt and white pepper, last half of onions, mayo, crumbled egg whites, mayo and topped with crumbled egg yolks and fresh chopped parsley.

My husband and I ate it fresh for dinner and as a sandwich filling the second night. I had it again this am for breakfast with toast and wil finish off the last tonight for my dinner. Yum!

Love this potato salad version.  Canned salmon adds so much to the flavors.  Followed the advice in the other reviews and used 5 hardboiled eggs and chopped them.
