Really good. Great the next day and stay soft! I used regular salted butter (I cut out a little of the kosher salt) and omitted the nuts- still great. Don't let these over cook! 11 minutes is just enough, let them finish on the cookie sheet outside of the oven for about 2-3 minutes.

I followed the recipe except for not adding in the nuts.  Next time I will cut back on the chocolate chips.  I used the hand roll method since there were so many chocolate chips it was impossible to do the spoon method with the chips falling off the dough.  Definitely worth the effort because the cookies tasted fabulous.  This recipe will be a keeper!

These cookies were soft and chocolatey.  The only thing I would change next time is to use regular salt instead of kosher.  The salt taste was a bit too noticeable and I think it's because the kosher salt didn't blend as well as the other kind would've.  Otherwise very yummy!

These were the best cookies I think I have ever made....I made these over the Christmas holiday and they were a hit everywhere I took them.  I even had to hide them from my husband. The only change I made was that I used chocolate chunks instead of chips.  Didn't have the chips on hand.  After I have tried these with the chunks I will only use chunks. With chunks you get more chocolate anyway. These cookies remind me of a brownie cookie more than a cake cookie though. I think you should give this a try.  This has become a staple in my house!!!

Exactly as promised - chocolatey, cakey goodness. I was worried the dough would be too soft and spread (it's really sticky) but it didn't... I did substitute two teaspoons of mint flavouring for the vanilla and used mint chips instead of chocolate, and omitted the nuts 'cause I couldn't think which ones would taste good with mint and chocolate. Wonderful cookies - I made them large so I only got 2 dozen.

Wow! These are way better than I thought they'd be. Im not a huge cookie fan, but I needed a way to use up some walnuts, (my mom has a very prolific walnut tree). I didnt think they were overly sweet or anything. They are better the next day, nice and chewy. Make sure you have milk though, these cookies beg for it!

Oh baby!!! I have tinkered and experimented with other cookie recipes and this one really is the best. Mine didn't flatten as they baked so they came out really ugly...but who cares when they taste like this! My only change was to reduce the chocolate chips to 1 cup since I also crammed in a cup of walnuts. Enough talk...must get another cookie!!!

Pretty yummy! I like my cookies really soft so only baked about 8-9 mins in my oven.  The catch with these cookies as others have mentioned is they are MUCH better when completely cooled (like the next day), weird taste when warm and I was really disappointed, but the next day YUM-O!

Delicious! For a little more flavor, try adding extra vanilla, some cinnamon and a dash of chili powder to the dry ingredients. HINT: I blended in 1/2 C. sour cream with an extra tablespoon or so of flour and of cocoa. Drop by tablespoon onto parchment paper. The cookies weren't as brownie-like with the sour cream...tender, soft and tasty - right out of the oven! And yes, 11 minutes was perfect baking time. W.O.N.D.E.R.F.U.L.

These were okay.  I wasnt too pleased with the flavor.  I cant quite pinpoint what it was though.  My son liked them and we had fun making them together so I gave them a four.

Other than the directions, I really liked this recipe. I just used the conventional method to mix these up, finding it unnecessary to cream the butter for 10 minutes followed by "massaging" the dry ingredients in a plastic food bag.  I used regular ol' table salt,  miniature chocolate chips, and substituted chocolate covered sunflower seeds for the walnuts. Chewy, gooey, brownie-like cookie that satisfies even the deepest chocolate craving.

First attempt at chocolate cookies...Super Yummy! Used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening. Used 1c brown sugar instead of 1.5 white. Used 2 c cake flour because I was out of all purpose. Used 2 c. white chocolate chips. Result: outstanding:)

With a few minor changes, this is one of the best cookies I've made.  I took out half the sugar, and used brown sugar for extra depth of flavor, they are still plenty sweet.  Recipe also works great without cocoa for regular choc chip cookies.  I made 1 batch choc with white chips and 1 regular with choc chips, looks great together! I also tried with 1/2  margarine and came out fine too.

These cookies were great! Not very sweet dough (just how I like it), but still soft and chocolatey. I made a few changes; used salted butter and omitted the kosher salt and instead of 3cups total of walnuts and chocolate chips, I used one cup each of sliced almonds, chocolate chips, and marshmallows. So good!

i made these for Christmas gifts. They taste great and don't dry out as fast as other chocolate cookies i've made. I used 1/2 veg shortening and 1/2 butter so they don't flatten as much. They tast like brownies and everyone loved them.

Yum! For an even more interesting cookie, use 3/4 cup white chocolate chips, 3/4 semi-sweet chocolate chips and pecans.

DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe but didn't add nuts and used the mint and chocolate swirl chips. I also left them on the cookie sheet for 2 minutes because I made them a little larger. Great chocolate taste!!

I couldn't be happier with this recipe!  I used milk chocolate chips because I like the flavor better than semi-sweet.  Also I used the flattened ball method and rolled them in powdered sugar before baking (see my photo).  I can't wait to make more!

AMAZING.
followed the recipe exactly with no walnuts~ However i did chill the dough for about 30 minutes.. i dont know if that did anything..

Sooo soft the next day, very very chocolately, kinda tastes like a brownie though :)
My go-to cookie recipe from now on!

The only issue I have with these cookies is that they only last a second and vanish before I know it.  I love these more than any other cookie I have made in my life and I appreciate this recipe.  I added white chocolate to a batch once and that was good too.  Thank you.

I get a bit confused when instructed to "drop by two teaspoonfuls." Too vague and likely inaccurate as that would be quite small. So for my first sheet I made them about the size of a big cherry tomato. The rest of them I made smaller, like the size of a typical bottle cap. I actually like the bigger ones better (they came out the size of a typical Chips Ahoy cookie). I yielded 80 cookies. OH also I was able to handroll my first 8 but then I suppose my hands warmed up too much bc then anything I touched turned into a gooey mess. I resorted to using 2 spoons to dish out and shape the cookie (like how they do with your ice cream in Cold Stone Creamery haha!). I omitted the nuts... Great cookies!!

Wow. These were super rich, super chocolaty.  Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Like perfect brownies in cookie form.

A chocolate lover's ultimate cookie. Easy to make, followed the instructions & ingredients as listed. I give a plate of cookies for my sister-in-law's b-day and she raved about these! I have to hide them from my husband or he'd eat them all.

Worked out pretty well, I didn't use unsalted butter or Kosher salt, but they taste fine, however, definitely have to have that bag to mix the cocoa and flour, the chunks don't get fully broken otherwise!

These are a huge hit! I brought them to my mother's xmas party and they went really fast! I used salted butter and cut out the salt. I also used a 3:1 ratio of chocolate chips to peanut butter chips. I'll be making this again for the xmas party at work. Happy Holidays !

I'm just a beginning baker and even I couldn't mess this up (even though I thought I did!). I halved the recipe and ended up with about 9 huge cookies. I thought I left them in for too long because they looked hard but when I bit into it, it was just the slightest crunch soon accompanied by a glorious chocolatey chewiness that reminded me of a brownie. 

I think the next time I make these, I'll add caramel chips to make it kind of like a turtle cookie!

Excellent recipe.  I only cream the first ingredients for about 3 or 4 minutes, and combine the dry ingredients in a bowl instead of a bag.  Still turns out delicious!  My favorite twist is to switch out the nuts for a whole bag of peanut butter chips.  These cookies stay fresh for a lot longer than other recipes I have tried.

I added cinnimon to these, used salted butter, and didn't put it nuts or chocolate chips, because i didnt have any, and they turned out great. i baked them for a few extra minutes because they were so soft, and they taste great!

meh, these were just okay. I made a couple of adjustments: 3/4 C sugar 3/4 C brown sugar, 1/2 C butter 1/2 C shortening.  I mean these are good cookies but not as good as other recipes I've used on this site.

These turned out exellent! I followed the recipe pretty closely. The only changes I made were: I used regular salt (didn't have Kosher salt), I multiplied the recipe by 1.5 to get more cookies, I didn't use nuts, and I used 1/2 cup fewer chocolate chips because it was all I had. They came out soooo good. Very fudgy on the inside, so really- DO NOT cook any more or less than 11 minutes. I will definitely keep this recipe. Two thumbs up.

This was everything you would expect from a cake like, almost chewy cookie. I think you would probably get a better cookie by adding some unsweetened cocoa powder to your favorite chocolate chip recipe. I tried this one because I needed a chocolate chip cookie that didnt need milk or brown suger... it's snowing and I'm running low on both. Try it and enjoy!!

This is a great recipe - use the plastic bag to mix - if you don't its a marble-y cookie - not attractive.  Very delicious! Thanks.

Great recipe! As some others did, I slightly modified a few of the Ingredients just a bit. First thing was I halfed the servings down to 12 instead of 24. Then I took out 1/4 cup of white sugar and replaced it with 1/4 cup of brown sugar, replaced kosher salt with regular salt, added another 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract, and rather than a whole cup of semisweet chips, I used only 1/4 cup of semisweet mini morsels. Baked for no more than 10 minutes, 2 inches apart from each other on cookie sheets lined with parchment paper. Sit for approx. 2 minutes on sheets after removing from oven, then Allow to fully cool on rack for yummy chocolate goodness!  In addition to these modifications, one of more important things Is to ensure all ingredients are at room temperature, along with sifting all dry ingredients together will help yield a superior product. Thanks for the recipe, without which I could not have created my wife and daughter's all time favorite cookies.

These ended up really nicely. The cookies were perfectly baked! Make sure you don't over cook these though, the perfect time for them was really 11 min. The nuts gave a nice crunch. Since I used all Ghirardelli chocolate and cocoa, it was very rich but the taste was amazing! I recommend them eaten at once, if you like them to be nice and gooey good! But if you are making them for other people, cool them completely or else they'll stick to each other when you put them in a container. I put my settings to 24 cookies, but for some reason ended up with 56. Doesn't matter to me because they were good, but I would be careful if I didn't like chocolate so much. I used salted butter and left out the kosher salt. The taste was good still.

Great recipe, recommended if you like chocolate and brownies.

These cookies turned out great! I omitted half the butter and they still puffed up and were very stable. Chewy on the inside and a little crispy on the outside. Perfect!

Unbelievable! These are like rich, chocolatey brownies. I used half Crisco and half unsalted butter, only one quarter teaspoon of kosher salt, and I did one cup of white sugar and a half cup of brown sugar. Baked small cookies for only eight minutes, perfect. Oh, and I only had a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips so I put in a half cup of Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips!

Just made these cookies tonight and my family could hardly wait til they were out of the oven!  They are like little individual brownies.  They're a hit with us!  This is going to be a family favorite for many years to come.

I really enjoyed these cookies! They are a chocolate lover's dream and a dieter's wort nightmare.  I followed the recipe exactly (minus the nuts).  The 10 minutes for the butter and sugar can be shortened if the butter is slightly softened beforehand.  Also, mixing the dry ingredients in a bowl works as good as the plastic bag.  The only reason I gave these is a 4 is because they were good but then I frosted then with Vanilla frosting and topped with some sprinkles and then they were amazing! Better than chocolate cake!

These cookies rocked.  I made them with my 3-year-old and they turned out like little brownie cookies.  We took them to Thanksgiving and my father-in-law was eating them with his coffee the next morning.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was replace the all-purpose flour with whole wheat pastry flour.

This is a delicious cookie!  I substituted Smart Blend oil for the butter, used whole wheat white flour, and split the white sugar with Brown Sugar Blend.  375 for 7 minutes and the result was a crunchy outside, chewy inside treat!

Great recipe.  Will make again.  Have to substitute the butter for milk free margarine due to a milk allergy and it still turned out great.  Careful how long you cook them as it is hard to tell if it is cooked due to the dark color and it can easily over cook.

Chocoholics rejoice! These cookies turned out amazing! Seriously, if you can take the chocolatey goodness this recipe is for you! If you can't replace the chocolate chips with toffee bits or white chocolate chips, or maybe butterscotch chips.

These cookies were a hit w/ my family.  They are very chocolate-y!  I did use 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Flour was a white and whole wheat blend, too.  Don't overcook.  I will make these again for sure!

These are awesome!  The only change I made was to use half brown sugar and half white.  The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is that the chocolate was a little TOO overwhelming as written... I guess I'm just not a true chocoholic, lol!  Next time I'm going to try half white chocolate chips and half regular (and there WILL be a next time!)

These cookies are my husband's all time favorite!!  They are moist and rich and loaded with flavor.  I have tried several variations on these cookies-- I have made them as directed with nuts and semi-sweet chips... very yummy :).  I have also made them using bakers chocolate, broken up into bits or very dark chocolate morsels (try Ghirardelli 60% cacao morsels)... my personal favorite.  For Christmas this year, I am trying this recipe with Andes Mint chips... very excited and optimistic!!  
Note:  The dough is very thick... I would not recommend trying to make a double batch-- it's very hard to mix.

my kids loved these cookies. It seemed a bit involved to make them but they have remained soft. They're more like brownies. My daughter ate a few with ice cream and a spoon. Will make again.

I would give this recipe 100 stars if I could!  Buttery, chocolatey, delicious...perfect!  I left out the nuts, doubled the vanilla, and used a cookie scoop (and did not flatten the cookies), just because that's my preference, and would like to try white chocolate chips next time.  The flavor is very much like a delicious delicatessen brownie.  I've been looking for a recipe exactly like this for a long time!!  Now I just have to save some for my husband.

SO EASY, SO FAST, SO GOOD! I didn't have any nuts, but these cookies were just the thing to calm a serious chocolate craving, and I whipped them up in no time at all!

These cookies were great.  I made them with white chocolate chips, and I also added walnuts and some mint extract.  Yummy!

This recipe is way too sweet for my taste. The second time around I only used 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder. Everyone prefers it this way except I should have added flour to replace the cocoa powder I left out. With the added flour I suspect the cookies wouldn't have crumbled so easily. With the modifications the taste was great otherwise you may have sugar shock. DO NOT FLATTEN COOKIES IN ANY WAY! Drop using a spoon and cookies will spread adequately when baking. I'll let you know how the third attempt goes.

This recipe is awesome!  I always get rave reviews when I make these cookies.  They are great with Andes mint pieces instead of choc chips as well.

I added chocolate chips and peanut butter chips to the recipe. It was fantastic. DH and I experimented with the baking time. We started at 11 min and increased each tray by a min up to 13 minutes. I found the perfect time to be about 12 to 12 and a half minutes.

I followed recipe exactly and they did come out very cake like. Some people said they tasted brownie like, but i used the mixer alot to put this together and it came out with a cake texture. awesome cookies, best with lots of chips and choc. chunks too.n thanks for a delicious recipe. my forth chocolate cookie recipe for the week and these were by far the best.

absolubtly gorgeous! i used half plain chocolate chunks (bournville) and half white chocolate chips and it worked great. I also substituted the butter for a soya spread (pure)which also worked really well. I would recomend leaving the cookies on the sheet for about a minute before removing onto a cooling rack as they are less likely to break. a real hit with everyone although i didn't add nuts because my sister is allergic

These are really good!  And they stay really soft!  Took about 9 min to bake in my oven.  I used mini M&Ms instead of chocolate chips and did not put nuts in them.  And I also used salted butter b/c that is all I had.  They were great.  Will make again.

For chocolate lover's these are a dream and I would have given it 5 stars if I was. Alas I am the type that omits half of the chocolate chips out of my cookies. I used 1 cup white chips and 1 cup milk chocolate chips. The family said they taste like brownies.

These are delicious!  I'm not a big nut fan so I took the walnuts out of the recipe and they still came out great!  

I made one batch for my husband to take to work and after tasting the first batch, I decided to make two!

This was the recipe that I have been searching for.  I used to have a recipe for chocolate chocolate chip cookies years ago, that a chef had given me.  I had unfortunatly lost it during my move.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  The cookies came out nice and chewy and chocolatly.  I did put a shot of chocolate syrup in the batter at the end which gave it even more of that chocolate kick.  Great cookies, I will keep this recipe looked up!  Thanks.

This was a good change of pass from the traditional chocolate chip cookie, but still not what I was looking for.  It was more of a fudgy texture than a cookie.  All of my co-workers liked it though, no cookie gets turned away in our office

I made these as a birthday present for a friend. Luckily (for her) I only ate one of them after I'd wrapped all the others - if I hadn't waited, I would've ended up eating them all myself, they were so great!

Wow!! These cookies were Deeeelish! I used a little less salt (i didn't use kosher) because i was using salted butter and i used Bread flour instead of all purpose or cake. Still turned out great! Really super easy to make, baked evenly, delicious! Will definitely make again. Thanks!!

these are great!  i ran out of white sugar and used half light brown sugar.  I used Scharfen Berger natural cocoa, and the chocolate flavor was just awesome!  Also, instead of using the bag to mix the flour i just used a whisk and it was fine.

This is just a chocolate drop cookie recipe with chocolate chips added.  Your basic brownie cookie.   But no chocolate drop cookie should be using Kosher salt.  You already have salt in the recipe.   Not one for my recipe box.

I used mini chocolate chips and my 4 year old grand daughter, who helped me make them, thought they were the best cookies ever!  I mixed in the bowl, then sifted the dry ingredients instead of mixing them in the ziplock bag.

Love these! My ten year old made these all by herself, using chocolate mint chips, and they came out great! Nice chocolate flavor and cake-like texture.  Dough was easy to work with - she opted to roll them into balls, which resulted in nicely shaped, uniform sized cookies.  Will definitely make these again!

I altered this recipe just for fun, and to use what I had. For the butter, I used half butter and half coconut oil (solid at room temp). I used Hersey's doark chocolate cocoa, and Ghirardelli semisweet chocolate chips. I used powdered vanilla in addition to the vanilla in the recipe. I added ground flax meal, and 1/4 cup wheat germ. Wow. That's all I can say. If you are having a chocolate craving, this will fix it! So rich and creamy and such dimension to the flavor. I would have added a tsp. of instant coffe if I had it, but I don't think it needed it. It was perfect.

Yummy, yummy, yummy. Used chocolate chunks since all I had on hand, and wow great substitution. My hubby hates cookies with crunchy or hard or even firm bottoms, so hard to make a cookie he will enjoy. He was excited and happy with this cookie, I will be making these again and again.

Deliciously dark and chewy!  I didn't use nuts and only used half the chips and it was still fantastic.  What a decadent treat!

These came out great! I used less sugar, and some extra cocoa powder, to get a more bitter, chocolaty taste.

Fantastic!  I made them for a club meeting and all 40 disappeared within 20 minutes.  I made another batch when I got home and they have stayed chewy and moist for days.  I used 1 C cocoa powder and 2 C flour because I liked them extra cocoa-y. Baked for 9 minutes and then let them bake on the sheet for another 2 minutes out of the oven.

These were fabulous! I was having a crappy day and needed a pick me up (plus something to do to get my mind off it) and these were simple enough for both; not to mention they were amazingly delicious. Nothing cures a cranky mood like an excellent cookie.

This was a great and easy cookie recipe. I should have read all the previous reviews though b/c there was to much salt. Definitley cut down on the salt, it goes to the edges and so the first thing you taste is salt. I also used butterscotch & Chocolate chips in this recipe, and it turned out great.

My 7yr old son made these cookies for a homeschool "lesson". He did it all alone and these are seriously the BEST cookies we have ever had! They are like little chocolate handheld cakes and taste amazing! Really...these are an easy and very good cookie to bake with your children. We ran out of cocoa but hand pudding on hand. We used 2/3 c of pudding and cut back the sugar to 1c of raw sugar. Still came out wonderful. We have an oven with a mind of it's own..so we only needed to bake them 9 mins. and let them "cool" on the sheet for 1-2 mins. My son says he can't wait to make these for Santa!! :)

These cookies are very rich and chocolaty.  I left out the walnuts and added 1/4 cup of millet instead.  This gives the cookies a little crunch and some extra nutrition.

These are now my favorite chocolate cookie recipe. I used a little brown sugar with the white sugar. They are best when they are still warm. This is a very easy recipe and well worth it.

I made these yesterday and they turned out great. Followed as written and they were moist and tasted like little brownies, but today they seemed to be a little dry and crumbly. Still tasted great but I was a little disappointed they didn't stay moist. But my 2 1/2 year old who dosen't really care for cookies at 2 of them so they can't be that bad! Will give it another try espically since it might be a bakers error.

Thank you for this recipe. I'm a chocoholic, and these cookies satisfy the cravings. You can't just eat one. I didn't have chocolate chips so I substituted semi-sweet and unsweetened baking chocolate bars, and I used only 1 1/3 c sugar instead. Since they are easy to roll, you can put any type of ingredient in your own cookie. My son likes M & M's so I pilfered from the trail mix and placed one on top of each cookie, they look great. This is a keeper, another one for my christmas cookie list.

These cookies were an absolute hit! One of my friends recently stopped smoking and said these cookies were better than nicotine! I made a few changes. I used 2 cups of white chocolate chunks and 1 cup of milk chocolate chunks and didn't use nuts. I also just stirred the powders in a separate bowl instead of putting them in a plastic bag. These cookies are amazing! Thanks for the recipe!

These were AMAZING!!! You have to make sure you don't overcook them though, they harden as they sit. I added about 1 to 1 and a half cups of mini marshmallows to half of the dough, and i found that the marshmallows kept the cookies softer than the ones without. Enjoy!

Absolutely the best chocolate chip cookie that I've ever had!  More like a very rich brownie than the traditional choc. chip cookie though.  I used regular salt instead of kosher salt, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written.  The guys in my husbands' fire station ate up all the cookies between breakfast and dinner!

Simply yummy!  These were really delicous cookies, everyone loved them, sooooo chocolatey!  I substituted shredded coconut for the nuts because I prefer that and they were great!  I also did not beat the batter for ten minutes, and they worked out anyways.  Will definitley make again.

Try to heat the butter hotter next time, which might help to dissolve the sugar much easier and faster.


just made it.the cookies are very good and everyone loves them.
creamed butter and sugar thoroughly this time, maybe this give effect to the cookie also. baking 13 mins is better.
after refrigered, the choco chips become more obviouse.

absolutely incredible!  A friend of mine loves these so much and because she is hypoglycemic she says one of these and its perfect!  I actually make the dough for her since she cannot bake at all, and then she portions it out into smaller portions to make about 18 cookies and throws them in her freezer.  This way when her family feels like cookies, she just takes a package out unthaws the dough and has a bke off.  But she always says they don't turn out as good as they do for me.  It could be due to the freezing of the dough, but she still says that they are still to die for!  excellant recipe.  Also for a little kick, I sometimes like to add nuts.

FABULOUS COOKIES! I adjusted a few things to my own tastes and they turned out great. I didn't add the cocoa b/c I didn't want them to be too rich, nor did I add the walnuts. With those minor changes the cookies still turned out delicious. A definite winner!

These are sinfully sweet, but as another reviewer stated, don't eat them until they're cool. There's just something strange when warm. The stickiness of the dough lends itself well to the use of a cookie scoop: no problem!! I didn't have choc chips or walnuts, so I used 1 cup of white chips. Good. Very sweet; have some coffee or milk and these are a treat!

You need to try these now! These cakey chocolaty cookies are best eaten the first 2 days. So, I would recommend halving the recipe (they make a lot) if you are baking these for yourself. The 3rd day they became dry and crumbly so get out the milk.

These are the best cookies ever.  Accolades every time I make them.  The only problem I ever have is the cook time, the specified time never seems to be quite enough, so I add a few minutes, or turn on the speed bake.  These cookies are a chocolholics dream.

I love this recipe and have made it numerous times. However, I recently changed it a bit and it resulted in the best milk-chocolatey cookies I have ever tried.  Instead of using butter or hard margarine, I used the soft stuff (the kind that comes in the tub, like Becel) and I added an additional 1/2 cup of sugar and approx. 1/4 cup of flour. Per recipe, I also added a bag and half of Reese Peanut Butter Chips.  The dough will be much softer (more like a cake mix) and the resulting cookies are a chocoholics dream!

It was another rainy, miserable day here in Pittsburgh and I was having a major chocolate craving!  This recipe looked interesting (kosher salt, mix dry ingredients in a bag...NO brown sugar!)  Let me tell you....the first batch was gone before the second batch came out of the oven!! My husband and kids went nuts!!  Excellent cookie....sure to be our new family favorite!

I used 1/2 cup less chocolate chips and it was still very chocolaty. Reminds me of a brownie.  Not sure if I will make again because it is almost too much chocolate.

I made these because I had unsalted butter and no brown sugar.  Glad that was the case, these were soooo yummy! Did not have a problem with flat cookies. I did add about a half tsp of baking powder, only change I made.

These are the cookies I bring out when ever some one needs cheering up. They are excellent. It is important to watch them while they are baking and to pull them out before they get over cooked, and I just use regular salt. I even tried them once with skor pieces. These are the best, I highly recommend them, and the real secret is to microwave them for 3 seconds so they are crispy and gooey.

Tried the recipe for the first time and it was delicious!  Hubby & daughter loved it!  Last night I did another batch but substitute 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of the white- still good and more chewy and used milk chocolate chips. On the last dozen, I added some white chocolate chips.  I omitted the nuts this time.  Very good recipe!  Thank you!

Possibly the best cookies I have ever had.  These are perfect!  I used regular salt but I also omitted the walnuts.  I also used only 1 cup of chocolate chips and I added 1 cup white chocolate chips.  Beautiful and delicious!  Very simple to bake as well.

This is the second time I made these, and they are wonderful.  The only thing I did not add was the nuts because my kids don't like them.  But I'd much rather have the nuts.  I think next time I will add nuts to half the dough.  I don't usually bake cookies that well as mine always seem to come out flat as pancakes, but for some reason, these turn out thick, soft and gooey.  Thanks for sharing!!

These cookies are amazing! I make them as often as I can. I have tried them with the original recipe, and they are great. I have also used light butter with half the sugar. Also great! They work out to be about 100 calories per cookie when measured out to make the recipe amount. I generally add 1/2 tsp butter flavoring to the mix, and they can be made with or without nuts.

Best cookie recipe I have come across in a long time.  They cooked up perfectly round, made exactly 2 dozen and were moist and chewy.  Fantastic.  Will definitely be making these again.

I have made these several times now (without the walnuts) and absolutely love them!  This is my new go-to recipe when I get a chocolate cookie craving.  They are quick to put together and bake up nice and fluffy with a yummy, not-too-sweet chocolate flavor, just as if you were using a pre-made cake mix :)

Very easy and tasty! I halved the recipe and made with almonds instead of walnuts.  Nice when you want more than a cookie and not quite a cake.

These were beyond tasty!  The perfect level of chocolatey goodness.  I also added some mini marshmallows that I had on hand.  I also use dark chocolate chips because I prefer them to semi sweet.  Cookies were moist and delicious.  Next time I plan on mixing up with white chocolate chips or trying the mint like another reviewer suggested.  Needless to say, this is a keeper!!!

I've just made these, substituting butterscotch chips for the walnuts, and they are fantastic! They are nice and fluffy instead of flat and crispy. 
I plan on making iced cream sandwiches out of them, and can't wait!

Will soothe even the most addicted choco-holic!  These WILL NOT dissappoint! We used mini-chips and made them a bit smaller in size than the recipe called for,  so the outside was slightly crisp and the inside was cakelike and delicious!

I am only giving these 3 stars because, they were not soft, which I was very disappointed in, I hate hard cookies. They did however, have very good flavor. Don't know what I did wrong, not sure if I'll try again or not.

I loved this recipe, as did my coworkers.  They couldn't keep their hands off!  To make them a little more interesting, I substituted cinnamon chips for the walnuts.  Great flavor and a bit of a kick.

The cookies were great.  I put 2 tablespoons of vanilla in mine.  I also put 1 cup of m&m's and 1 cup of chocolate chips - no nuts...I wouldn't recommend the m&m's because it was 2 different kinds of chocolate in one cookie (a bit overwhelming) But the actual cookie itself it fantastic!!

These turned out very well. They tasted a lot like brownies. Although the recipe was successful, they weren't really to my taste--too sweet. Nevertheless, the recipe is good.

these turned out just as I expected - reminded me of Millies cookies in london - my favourites. I found the larger the cookie the more moist and chewey, so 11 minutes was the perfect cooking time

Not bad, not bad.  I made these without nuts, and I wanted a mint-chocolate taste so I used peppermint extract instead of vanilla. They came out just fine. I took me longer than listed to bake each batch - maybe 15 minutes - but they are good and everyone liked them.

They were okay. I made these because I was out of brown sugar and kids wanted to make cookies. I didn't add the nuts and mixed both semi-sweet and white chocolate chips to them. Probably won't make these again simply because the other cookie recipes are so much better.

These were absolutely great cookies! Might be a little too rich for some, but the college boys I made them for loved them!

I have made these several times; I use half semi-sweet chips and half white chocolate, and they're a big favorite of mine.

This is a very unique cookie recipe- great for chocolate cravings, that's for sure. I didn't like the stickiness of the dough, it was hard to work with. Taste is 5 star, though.I used margarine instead of butter, and threw in some white chocolate chips as recommended by another reviewer.

Great taste but very rich and sweet.
