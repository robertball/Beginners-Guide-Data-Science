My meringue fell off in the oven too! It was all OK except for that though. Nice twist with the orange.

this was ok.. the meraguine started falling off in the oven, may have cooked it a bit too long and it was just a weird combination for my taste. I think if you added some vanilla to the mer. it may have made a bit of differece. It just needed something else to it.. But it was fun to try!
