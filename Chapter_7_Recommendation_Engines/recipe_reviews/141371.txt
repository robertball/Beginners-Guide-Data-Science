I grew up making watermelon-lime slushies with frozen pieces of watermelon rather than bothering with ice. The flavor turns out better and stronger that way.

Substitute limeade concentrate, and add ginger ale or a citrus soda, to make it even more refreshing.  I also froze watermelon chunks so did not need ice cubes, but did need the ginger ale to make it go through the blender.  I also omitted the salt from the blender batch, and added it to taste to the finished drink.  This is good!

REFRESHING! I tripled the ice to make it more slushy and didn't add all the sugar at once, but to taste.  I also stuck the leftovers in the freezer and let thaw for 10 minutes, then added a small amount of water and poured into a glass.  Either way, I will be making this again when I have more watermelon than I know what to do with!

This is excellent with the changes I made.  I used frozen strawberries instead of ice cubes.  Also used 3 T. lime juice instead of 1/3 cup.

I used lemon juice, didn't have lme, omitted the salt and only measured the melon, but eyeballed everything else. Came out fantastic! So refreshing and delish. It'such a great and simple way to use up extra watermelon that is lying in the fridge! thanks for sharing your recipe!

This recipe is very refreshing.I did find that the sugar needed adjusting according to the sweetness of the melon. I added only half the sugar initially then adjusted to my own taste.

We had 3/4 of a smallish watermelon that was not getting eaten so I scooped all in melon out (probably around five cups' worth), and I added 12 ice cubes, the juice of half a lime, around 2 TBS sugar, and no salt. It was plenty sweet as the watermelon was really sweet. And half a lime was enough for us, any more would have been overpowering. Thanks for sharing, Olivia! I think I prefer drinking my watermelons!

This is pretty good.  1/3 cup of lime was a little too much so I would cut that back to maybe 1/4 cup.  I also could have cut the amount of sugar due to the ripeness of the watermelon.  My 3 boys really liked it and it was a great way to get a large amount of watermelon out of a crowded fridge, not to mention the fact that it's better for them to drink than kool-aid!!!

Very refreshing drink. The drink is much better when you freeze the watermelon and add it instead of ice cubes. I give the recipe 5 stars when done that way!

This was pretty good!  I substituted three handsful of frozen strawberries for the ice cubes, as other reviewers suggested.  I also only had bottled lime juice, so I used 1/4 cup of that, which tasted like the right amount.  I am glad I didn't use more.  I subbed agave nectar for the sugar to make it a little healthier.  My husband agreed that it would taste better spiked with alcohol, but the kids all enjoyed it, it was a nice treat for them and a great way to use up extra watermelon.  Thanks!

I wasn't too crazy about the lime juice, but it's good. I think my husband would love this though! Next time I will probably not add as much of the lime juice though. Strawberries would be delicious in this!

This was really really good!  I checked my watermelon the night before I intended to make it to make sure it was good and sweet - that's key for making this with little sugar.  I froze the watermelon in chunks and then blended them with the lime juice, about half the amount of sugar, and some soda water.  The kids LOVED it and so did the adults.  A great refreshing treat on a hot summer day, without too many calories.  Thanks!

A refreshing way to get rid of unwanted watermelon. I used lemon juice instead of lime cutting it to 3 T. and omitted the salt. You need to adjust the sugar depending on the sweetness of the melon. Some of the kids wouldn't touch it - others loved it.

I loved this recipe. Here's a suggestion for you. Use balled ice from Sonic. It blends really easily and fast. My daughter's thought this was the best treat ever!!! Delicious!

I made this and added some fresh strawberries and froze chunks of watermelon to avoid using ice cubes as others had suggested...it was awful!  I was unsure of adding salt, so I only added a dash...all I could taste was salt.  I had to add more watermelon and strawberries to dilute the salt flavor.  Even after everything it was still awful!  We tried to make it an adult drink and added some vodka...nothing helped.   My advise...eat your watermelon the old fashioned way, and avoid this recipe.

Loved it!  I had some watermelon that was a bit overripe for just plain eating, and it worked great in this recipe.  I didn't measure the lime juice, just used the juice from 2 limes.  Very refreshing drink to go with our grilled salmon salads tonight for dinner!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I didn't use the salt, and substituted frozen strawberries for the ice cubes. This was good, but very tangy from the lime, so I also added about 1/8c of agave to sweeten it a bit. Very refreshing.

ver refreshing and wonderful for hot summer days. Made just like recipe instructed. DH and I loved this. This recipe is also a good way to use up and remaining watermelon you have leftover that otherwise would go to waste. Thank you so much for sharing!! Will make every summer!

oohhh yeah, this is good.  the first batch i didn't have limes, so i used some margarita mix i had on hand, then the 2nd batch i put some apple flavored vodka - and i like it mucho! i think the pinch of salt kicks up the watermelon flavor a notch.

Pretty good, but nothing spectacular. I added some raspberries cause I had them around - that was nice. Also - recipe does not yield the number of servings it says - 1/2 recipe only made 1 serving.

Good for a watermelon-lovers, but for guests try adding different fruit or frozen fruit juice concentrate. We also tripled the ice for a smoothie consistency. A great base recipe. I added vodka!

Wow this is so refreshing and a great way to use up my watermelon.  I didn't add as much sugar as called for.  The lime is a fabulous addition and really brings out the flavors.  It could use more ice depending on how slushy you want this.  The kids loved it!  Thank you!

Ditto to the solution of "too much leftover watermelon". I took the advice of others and used frozen watermelon "cubes" instead of ice. Otherwise, I followed the recipe except for us adults. I added about 3/4 cup of frozen vodka (during the blending process), which made a really refreshing summertime cocktail! :-)~ (Using flavored vodkas would work well, too, I'd think.)

Light, refreshing, tasty.  Not really a fan of watermelon, but I liked this.  Perfect for a hot day, when you just can't quench your thirst and is quick and easy to prepare.  Mine wasn't true slushy consistency, but adding more ice cubes might help with that.

It was cold and sweet, but it just wasn't strong enough flavor for our tastes. My hubby said it was trying to be lemonade, just missing the extra flavor.

I left out the salt and sweetened it with honey instead of sugar. It tasted like a Watermelon Limeade! I may take the suggestion of others and add flavored vodka or Midori next time I make it.

Oh, this is a good one!  We had a watermelon that nobody was eating. I chopped it up, put it in the blender with some ice, blended it, added some bottled lime juice and sugar and....voila!  The kids really liked it.  I always wondered how watermelon juice was made.  Thanks Olivia.

I've been making smoothies all summer- this is my favorite so far! I added about a cup of frozen strawberries, and left out the sugar and salt.  Delicious and refreshing!

I enjoyed this drink.  I took the advice of the other reviews and I used half the fresh lime juice.  I really enjoyed it. It was a nice way to use up an over abundance of watermelon.

This is our new favorite summer drink. So easy & refreshing!!! HUGE HIT at a picnic. We took a gallon of it. It requires a lot of watermelon to make even a cup so buy a lot.  For the adults, a splash of cucumber vodka made it extra tasty.

Great use for sketchy over ripe  watermelon.  Cube it, throw the whole bowl in the freezer while you do something for about an hour, stick it in the blender with the juice of one or two limes (for about four cups of watermelon cubes, I used about 1/4 cup).  Give a few grinds of the salt shaker and blend it up.  No need for ice cubes.  Don't forget the salt, if you have been sweating, it is good for you.

I've never actually drank any of this (yet). My mother-in-law is currently in hopsice care and is pretty much living off of this stuff. When nothing else tasted good, she relied on this. This also helped calm the coughing (she has tumors on her lungs) and she said it made her throat feel so much better.  Now that she can't swallow solids, this and water are all she can get down.  Because it has made the end of her life so much better, this recipe should get six stars. 
MIL is a health nut and stopped eating processed sugar a while ago, so we use honey instead of sugar. We also would freeze the cubed watermelon and use very little ice. Sometimes we'd throw in a few mint leaves. Add some rum with the mind and you've got a frozen watermelon mojito.

Great way to use up watermelon that's gotten a bit mushy... Lime juice is a good add.  I'd add sugar to taste.

Add a little more sugar. Way to much lime juice. add a little more ice. Next time  I will do less lime juice than the recipe says. And maybe  no salt.

This is a fun/refreshing summer drink.  On Fridays I like to add vodka or rum!  It's just my husband and I for now so when I buy a whole watermelon (if they're on sale) I cube and put bags in the freezer, that way I can use them in lieu of ice as others suggested.  I have used limeade concentrate and lime juice, both are good.  I also will add other fruit from the fridge (berries, melon, etc.). I like that there isn't lots of sugar in this drink aside from the natural sugars in the fruit, it really doesn't need it!

My first taste of this was fantastic but then I kept on tasting salt.  My husband said "yuck, all I taste is salt".  I put in the exact amount per the recipe.  I would recommend leaving it out entirely or using it very sparingly, I am not sure it there is a need to add it at all.  The lime & the watermelon taste nice together & I will make it again, minus salt!!

just tried this with leftover watermelon that I needed to get used up.

  next time I will leave out the sugar it was pretty sweet, but the melon was a very sweet one, so I only used 2 tablespoons rather than the 1/4 cp. but overall I loved it, it was refreshing, and I added some fresh snipped mint from my garden, that was a nice touch.

Love the idea of freezing the melon, that someone posted may try that next time to.

I didn't have limes on hand so I used fresh squeezed lemons, might add one more of those as well [I used 2]  Will try this again, with some tweaking, but great idea!!  Thank you!

Been making this refreshing summer slush for the last 3 years now, and I can't believe I haven't ever reviewed it! Like most reviewers, I use frozen watermelon cubes, which make for the perfect slushy consistency. Always omitting the salt, I prefer using limeade concentrate and a scant bit of sugar to taste, as well as a little water to help it blend smoothly.  My 5 year-old DD requested this tonight after a busy night of riding her bike, and I was happy to oblige! This also makes for a great adult frozen concoction too!

Delicious!!  I took another reviewer's suggestion and added frozen strawberries in place of the ice cubes and kept the rest of the ingredients the same, outstanding!  My kids loved it too.  This made so much that I used the leftovers and made popsicles out of them... talk about a treat... and so much better for you than most of the popsicles you get from the store.

Good and refreshing.  I love this drink.  I've even made it with fresh lemons and even lemonade and it tastes just as good. The lime juice gives it more of a lighter taste.  For adult beverages add a bit of vodka or coconut rum and you will LOVE this summertime drink. Easy to make and great for family get togethers.

This was really good but we made some new changes. We used about 1/2 cup of Z-Up and about 1/4 cup of lime juice, other than that it was amazing. One thing that was disappointing was that it came out more like a regular drink than a slushy.

I made this exactly as written for my kids and thought it was pretty delicious. I then took the leftovers for the adults and added a shot of watermelon pucker to each glass and a sprig of mint and ooohhh was it good.

I froze my watermelon and skipped the ice (but I had to add a splash of water to get the blender going)

This recipe is fine as is, but I added some lemon lime soda to my serving to give a little fiz, but my main problem with this recipe is that it smells very unappetizing!  I don't kmow how to change that, but this is definitely worth trying!(:
