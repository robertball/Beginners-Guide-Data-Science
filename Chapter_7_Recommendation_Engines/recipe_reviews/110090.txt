I made this a few years ago when my sister and her kids came to visit.  I don't remember if I got it on this web site or elsewhere.  I didn't have a plank. I just put it on the grill with some foil underneath spayed with a little cooking spray to keep it from sticking.  I used a whole salmon filet and besides not using the plank I followed the recipe exactly.  It came out great.  Even my husband enjoyed it and he doesn't care for fish.  My daughter asked me to make it this July 4th but I couldn't remember where the recipe came from.  I so glad I found it again!!!  This time I'll will use the plank.

Three words: SEALED THE DEAL!! I made this for someone who I just started dating and she loved it. I eat salmon a lot, especially when eating out, and this is right up there with the best I ever had. I had to bake it, since it was raining that day, but it was still excellent. Also I marinated the salmon for a few hours in the sun-dried tomatoes and dressing. I bought an untreated cedar board from Lowes for $5 and they cut it into eight 1ft planks for me. I soaked the planks over night, coated them with oil, and let them warm with the oven. I think that the warmer the planks get the better. This was a big hit and is my new favorite salmon recipe, can't wait to make it on the grill!

The salmon was amazing, but I'll give some pointers.  There's absolutely no need to brush the cedar planks w/ the olive oil, further there's really no need to even brush the salmon w/ the olive oil, especially b/c the salad dressing will have oil in it. Try to avoid oil packed sun dried tomatoes, and go w/ regular sun dried tomatoes that are loose packed.  This will turn the salmon into a much healthier dish.

So very yummy and so simple! A very different Salmon recipe that is sure to please. The flavours combine wonderfully and seems like it should be so much more work than it really is.

Pat Hawley made this for Memorial Day 2008 and it was absolutely scrumptious!  Leftovers the next day were equally delicious!  Awesome - and tastes gourmet!  Perfect for company!

This was probably the best salmon recipe I have ever made.  The flavor was great and the fish was extremely tender.  The only change I made was to mix the ingredients together and marinate the fish for two hours.  I don't know if this makes a big difference or not, but it certainly didn't hurt!

Just one word of warning - make sure your plank is well soaked and that the heat on the grill is not too high.  My first plank caught on fire!

This was my first time grilling salmon, with or  without cedar planks, and it turned out amazing. Everyone loved it. I did end up marinading the salmon in the dressing and a few sun-dried tomatoes for a couple hours before grilling.
