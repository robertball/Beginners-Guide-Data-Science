This is a very refreshing drink! I can taste a hint of all the different drinks in this mix.  It's a perfect combination. I also think it has the right amount of fizz, and kids really enjoy that.  For the adults a splash of vodka would be nice!  THX.

So delicious and so easy to put together.  I doubled the recipe and it fit nicely in a regular pitcher.  I like the idea of some sherbet in it to make a nice punch.  Think I'll go have another glass now.  :-)

I hope everyone enjoys this yummy drink. You can multiply this to make a great punch too. As a punch, it would be great with a few scoops of sherbet for a refreshing crowd-pleaser. If someone could submit a picture of this recipe, I would really apreciate it. :D

I followed the recipe and added 1/2 cup white grape juice to cut the sweetness of the pineapple.  Very nice.

This recipes is exactly like the Houlihana's Fruit Fizz.  I liked that it was easy to put together.  The only thing I didn't care for was that the pineapple taste was strongest flavor.  Refreshing though.

I made this punch for a summer family cookout (17 servings - bought 1 jug cranberry juice, 2 liters 7-Up, 1 can pineapple juice, 1 container OJ). Very good. Everyone enjoyed it, and my granddaughter asked me to make it again for our next holiday get-together. Personally, I would prefer less pineapple juice.  The taste is somewhat similar to Apple Orchard Punch, which I prefer.
