I've made countless recipes from this site, but this is the first time I have reviewed a recipe.  I don't really care for fish much, but I've decided to eat it for my health.  Looking for a recipe with ingredients I had on hand, I found this one.  I can't get over how good it was. I absolutely loved it!  To save money, I only used half of the macadamia nut mixture, but it would have been wonderful with the whole amount.  I covered the fish with tin foil and put the fish in a 400 degree oven for 7 minutes.  Then I put the paste on the fish and returned it to the oven (w/o the foil) for another 7 minutes.  Don't overcook!  Trust me, you will love this recipe.  I can't wait to make it for my friends!  Thanks so much for this recipe!!!

If you follow the recipe to broil the fish, the topping will burn right away.  I would recommend baking the fish at a high temperature with the topping vs broiling.

This was incredible! It had a great flavor was easy to make. Everyone in my family loved it! I made a couple of small changes, I only used half of the nuts to make the paste and chopped the rest to sprinkle on the top. I baked it at 400 instead of broiling, my broiler is out of commision, and it still browned the nuts on top.

Listened to others and baked the tilapia for 10 minutes at 400F. Also, I assembled a marinade from 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, 3 crushed cloves of garlic, 4 squirts of soy sauce and a pinch of old bay seasoning. I spread this over 4 fillets and let it sit in the fridge for 2 hours before cooking. Came out fantastic.

This was really good.  Tilapia is such a mild fish and the nut crust gave it a good flavor.  I didnâ€™t have any macadamia nuts so I used pecans instead and it turned out just great.  Like others suggested I baked the fish at 400 for about 10 mins and then broiled the fish for about 3 mins to make the topping nice and crispy.  Delicious!

I cooked the fish way less than the suggested 15 minutes, I only cooked it 6 minutes and I think anything more might have overdone the fish. It was wonderful! I just wish the actual fish had more flavor. Next time I plan on marinating the fish to give it more flavor.

I baked this at 400 as one other reviewer did!  It came out so good that my husband said ' I wish I made this one so I could still be the better cook'.

Very good!  Though I added some water to the topping, it was almost too thick to spread.  I think next time I may use only 6 oz of nuts, there was a little too much topping compared to fish.

This was really good!  I followed the advice of others and baked it at 400 degrees for 10 minutes and then broiled it for 2 minutes under the broiler to crisp up the crust a little.  I also reduced the amount of Macadamia nuts to about 5 ounces, but I may reduce it even further the next time because I really couldn't taste much of the other ingredients.  My husband suggested adding more hot sauce next time, but he really likes things spicy!

I just made this recipe today and it was very tasty.  I will definitely make it again.  I don't think anything will stand 15 minutes in the broiler unless it's made of steel.  I of coursed followed everybody's suggestion and baked it for about 10 minutes at 400 degrees until the topping was golden brown.

Overall pretty good, it just seemed to miss something, some kind of spice or maybe a marinade on the fish like someone suggested. Can't put my finger on it.

I made this last night following the suggestions to bake at 400 degrees.  I followed the ingredients blend exactly.  It was absolutely delicious!  DH even asked for another piece, something that he seldom does with fish.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe that will remain on our list!

This is a great recipe, something we have made with our own recipe every Christmas. I suggest making a mango chutney- type salsa to go with the fish. We make ours with fresh mango, red onions, cilantro, and jicama, mixed with lime juice, honey, and spices to taste. It finishes it off really well, and adds a pop of flavor and color! Delish!

I baked the fish at 350 for 15 minutes and broiled it for a minute. It would have burned otherwise. The topping is delicious! I normally need a lot of sauce with my fish but I skimped on the macadamia nuts and it still came out great. I will make this again.

Excellent recipe! The crust mixture is quite thick, so I added about 1 tsp of additional olive oil and 1 tsp of extra soy sauce.  As was recommended by other users, I baked it at 400 for about 10 minutes, then turned on the broiler just to brown the crust.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this using pecans instead of macadamia nuts. I've eaten pecan crusted tilapia at a restaurant and it was wonderful.  This recipe may have been better without the hot sauce....that's what killed it!

Super yummy!!  I used a little extra hot sauce & garlic, and cut back on the pepper.  I also baked the Tilapia for 7 mins. w/out the Macadamia nut past, and then spread it on for the remaining 7 mins of baking time.  My husband said that it was EXCELLENT!  And that doesn't come easy from him!  This will defiantly be made again and again at our house!

I would've loved the flavors in the nut mixture for the tilipia, if I had NOT broiled it and caused all the topping to burn right away.  I was soooo disapointed. Bake this recipe, do NOT broil.  That is, unless you know a way to broil fish that doesn't burn up right away that is.  I personally know not how to broil anything other than toast w?o burning.

So tasty and SO easy!!!  I used rockfish because it was on sale, and also doubled the garlic. I baked for 20 minutes @ 400 degrees instead of broiling because my broiler burns stuff, but still came out nice and crunchy on top! mmmmm mmmmm

My husband's on a low carb diet so I've been trying to find new recipes. This was definitely a hit! I omitted the brown sugar (for obvious reasons) and seasoned the tilapia with salt and pepper. He loved it!!

This has been added to the regular rotation.  I followed everything to the letter except I added about 1/4tsp of curry. I also baked it for 6 minutes at 400 and broiled it for an additional 2 minutes on low. The fish was just a touch overdone, but I think it's because I overcooked it while defrosting it. Otherwise, it would have been perfect. I served with Garlic couscous and egg drop soup (with curry). DELISH!

I really enjoyed the taste of this dish. I did think the sauce was difficult to put on top of the tilapia due to how thick the sauce was! My boyfriend loved it though! Quick & Easy!

This was amazing!  It has a bit of a kick so my 4 year old wasn't a fan, but everything is "spicy" to her.  I did as others suggested and baked it.  Put it in my toaster oven on convection setting and 400 degrees for 12 min and it was perfect!!!  My husband said this is one of his top five favorite recipes!

Excellent recipe, but I agree with the others.  I cooked it at 400 for 10 minutes.  You only need to turn it on broil for the last minute or two.  I served it with ginger jasmine and wild rice, which complimented it nicely.

great recipe only with the sauce i mixed in a little soy sauce with the mayo, honey, and sweetened condensed milk to lesson the super sweet taste to it. It helped to balance it out a little. My fiance hates honey walnut shrimp, and he LOVED this!

The flavor of the crust goes excellent with flakey mild tasting fish. I think it would be too much with Salmon or Tuna. I've used Swai, Snapper and sea bass instead of Tilapia. I'm with the others...bake for 15 min/broil for 3 to 5 till golden brown. Served it with steam broccoli & roasted sweet potato. Mmmm!

This recipe is terrible. The topping burns if you follow the recipe. I recommend cooking the fish first, then putting the topping on and broiling for only two minutes. But I wasted $6 worth of nuts the first time, so I won't be trying it again.

This was GREAT!  I am spoiled from eating at favorite Maui restaurants that serve similar dishes with local fish, and this was easier & cheaper than going to Maui for dinner.  
I probably could have used a smaller portion of nuts, but we really loved this recipe.

This was great! Even my husband and son, who are definitely not fish lovers, came back for seconds.
I added half a jalapeno pepper instead of the hot sauce for a little better flavor. I also didn't have quite as many nuts as it called for, so it was a little extra pasty. I ended up having to spread it on the fish with my fingers, but this worked well.
Will make it again, thanks!

5 stars for taste. 1 star for directions to broil. You will have charcoal fish if you broil 15 minutes. As one reviewer said, bake at 350 degrees for about 8-10 minutes, depending on thickness of fish, then stick under broiler to crisp the top. Delicious!

Loved this, but added more brown sugar than what is called for. Great sweet and spicey flavor!
