Loved it!  I added mozzarella cheese and a squeeze of lime on top for a little twist.

Love these!  These might be the best paninis I have ever made!  Just the right amount of heat - crispy on the outside - flavorful - perfect!  I made my own blue cheese dressing but otherwise made exactly like the recipe and can't wait to make again!

Very good!  I did saute the onion before grilling the sandwich and I added some provolone cheese.  Great on sourdough!

Excellent recipe for buffalo chicken lovers.  Skipped the bread ... Just chicken, sauce and blue cheese.  What's not to love?

I was scared to use blue cheese dressing because I am not a fan however, it was really good on this sandwich. The heat from the pan melted the cheese chunks into the bread so i didnt get any big chunks of blue cheese (yuck) in my sandwich. 

I will be adding this sandwich to my routine.

Made my own blue cheese dressing, otherwise, I followed the recipe.  I did add leaf lettuce and tomato slices to the sandwich before serving.  The blue cheese melts into creamy goodness, and the buffalo sauce gives it a nice kick.  Just had the taste for a sandwich and salad for dinner last night, and although this was a little decadent, we enjoyed it!
