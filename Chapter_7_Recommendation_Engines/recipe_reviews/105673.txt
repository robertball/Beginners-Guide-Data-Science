This is absolutely delicious, quick, easy, and beautiful! Perfect for a hot summer evening! The tofu I had was extra firm, I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry and did not have basil leaves. I served this as the whole dinner, so I cut the 12 oz boxed tofu slab into 2 ~ 3/4 inch slabs. It was quite filling. The suggested Pinot Grigio wine was perfect with it. Male & female diner agree it's a keeper!
