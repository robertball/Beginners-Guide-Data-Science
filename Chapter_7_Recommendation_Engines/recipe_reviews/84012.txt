This is such a good idea.  The ingredients are great for my dad's diabetic diet.  And I thought it would taste great too-- until I got to the tablespoon of seasoned salt part.  I hesitated, and then put in two teaspoons of salt instead of the tablespoon.  WHOA!  Too much!  I tried to compensate by doubling all the other ingredients in the dressing-- but it was too late.  I ran out of mayo and sour cream, and the salad looked more like soup by the time I finished.  I do want to try this recipe again-- but next time I'll add the seasoned salt 1/2 teaspoon at a time until I find the right balance.

This salad is delicious!  I really liked the sour cream dressing.  I made it the night before and the texture was great.  I doubled the recipe for a graduation crowd.  It was a big hit.

This was awesome! I loved the dressing. I actually used light Miracle Whip in place of the Mayo. I added slightly more vinegar and mustard. I used real sugar. I used very little salt. Sunflower seeds and almonds add a great flavor and crunch to this recipe. I will make this again!

I made two changes to this: I used real mayonnaise because it has much less (& often none) sugar, and I couldn't find bacon bits so I used rather a lot of turkey bacon.  I took this to a dinner & was told my my hosts that I was welcome ANY TIME...if I brought this salad.  It is fabulous & I'm making it for my mother's wake tomorrow.

This is a great salad and I absolutely love the dressing but it turned out to be way too wet for my taste.  I even cut down on the wet ingredients and still it was too wet.  But I enjoyed it none-the-less.  I left out the Splenda and seasoned salt though.  (Splenda scares me, haha.)

Great salad - I made just a few minor tweaks to it:  I blanched the cauliflower to make it not-quite-as-crunchy as raw (but still crisp), and cut the Splenda down a bit. Since I didn't have regular white vinegar, I used a white wine vinegar.  After tasting it, I also added about a half a tablespoon of red pepper flakes to add a little zip as a foil to the sweetness. (We like "zip", so maybe a little less red pepper for those that don't.  Very good on top of a bed of shredded lettuce too, for a whole meal.  Thanks for posting it.

At first taste, this screamed "egg salad" to me for some reason (which isn't a good thing in my world, as I don't care for egg salad!).  It chilled and we took to a friend's house for dinner.  I liked it better after the flavors had a chance to meld.  The only change I made was to eliminate the celery per personal preference and I used white sugar in place of Splenda.  THANKS for the recipe, Ginn!  EDIT:  I need to edit my review and replace my 4 stars w/5 since I've thoroughly enjoyed this for lunch the past 3 days....

This is a yummy salad and is so crunchy with the califlower and has good texture with the added peas.  Very good and easy.  Nice to have a different thing to do with cauliflower.

I thought this was going to be good according to the reviews. I made it exactly as written, and everyone turned up their noses to it. Not sure why. Its a good base recipe, so I will try making it again with a few changes. Thanks for the recipe though.

This is delicious. First time I made it, I got distracted and forgot the cheese. It adds a whole layer to the flavor and the salad was much better, less sweet, when I went back and added some cheese.  A nice change from potato salad.

Loved it!  I mixed up a half batch of this in the morning, but did not add the cheeses or the bacon.  Tonight I dinner, I stirred the salad really well, and then add the cheeses and bacon.  My DH is not a fan of raw cauliflower or peas (loves both of them cooked) and he really enjoyed this salad too.  For people who had issues with the dressing, taste it before stirring it in to the salad ingredients.  Add more sugar if your tastes want it sweeter, more vinegar if you want it to have a little more zip.  This salad will go over really well with our summer gatherings.  Thanks Ginn, for sharing your recipe.  It went really well with our 'Turkey Bacon Avocado Sandwich' from AR.

I need diabetic friendly -this is a good for that. I've been using this receipe for a few years when I am missing potato salad or for potluck situations. Sometimes it does turn out a little wet for me( I am not good with measuring), so now I cut the dressing receipe in half and then add more of whatever my tasting tells me it needs.
I have been known to add instant potato flakes when it gets soupy. Add 1 tablespoon@ a time and let it sit for a few minutes b4 adding more flakes.

A friend made this many years ago and I was searching for a recipe - this one is yummy! Her trick is to cut up all the veggies and let them sit overnight  in an upside down container with paper towels under it. It takes out all the excess water so the salad doesn't get soupy. Then mix everything in the am and you're ready to go.  I also added red onion and broccoli.

I made this as is and it was wonderful!. It's not for everyone because of the raw cauliflower but I loved it!. The peas help tone down the strong taste of the cauliflower. The dressing is so flavorful. I may use that dressing on the pea salad I made at the same time from this site. It was bland but this was not! Thank you for sharing!

This is an awesome alternative to potato salad! I used regular salt instead of seasoned salt due to personal preference. I also left the shredded cheddar out of the mix but offered it on the side to avoid soggy cheese. Even my picky eaters had seconds!

Good combination of ingredients for a colorful and flavorful presentation. The bright green of the peas contrasts nicely against the white cauliflower. I omitted the cheese and added sunflower seeds. Used my regular recipe for potato or macaroni salad dressing. Will definitely make this again.

I love this salad.  I used regular salt, rather than the seasoned  which I'm just not a fan of.  I found the 2 tablespoons of sweetner to be just way too much and had to adjust the other dressing ingredients a little bit to address.  Next time I will simply cut back on the sweetner.  I had no problem with the dressing being runny as a few other reviewers reported.  This salad is definitely best when made a day prior to serving.

I made it exactly like it was printed. I refrigeratd it overnite. I found it to be very bland, so I added some chopped celery and some ranch dressing. If I were to make it again, I might use Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise. One of our guests who usually eats everything, did not like it.

Strangely enough, I LOVED this recipe even though I don't really care for Cauliflower!  Followed the recipe exactly as written, just wonderful!

Really good.  I kind of guestimated the amount of dressing and it turned out fine.  Looked at some other cauliflower salad recipes and added some chopped radishes and a handful of broccoli for color.  This recipe is a keeper!
