I give these a 4 for just the recipe, but I'd give them a 5 with my modifications. The bar part was really good, very peanut-buttery. I left out the chocolate chips in the dough, but I did sprinkle some on top to melt and spread once I took it out of the oven. After it cooled, I made a frosting of peanut butter, powdered sugar, a little milk and a little butter. I spread that on top, then drizzled with more melted chocolate chips. The result was heaven! 
This recipe made a great base, but with the frosting and melted chocolate it was awesome.

What can I say but... This is one recipe that has become a family favorite.  I LOVE LOVE LOVED this tasty treat. I didnt find the dough stiff. I just used a hand mixer and it was very creamy.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, softening the butter and peanut butter in the microwave before adding the sugars and vanilla. These bars have a chewy, moist consistency, much like a brownie. I did leave out the chocolate chips, since we're not big chocolate fans, and I frosted with cream-cheese frosting.

These were very easy to mix up and bake. They came out chewy, like a brownie but a little denser, and extremely peanutty.

I think the texture might be affected by what kind of peanut butter you use. I used old-fashioned creamy, the kind you stir. They would probably come out different with shelf-stable peanut butter, maybe more dry.

The chocolate chip "frosting" is a good idea--it was super-easy and adds a great touch. I used a fancier kind of chips (extra-dark chocolate, these are for a gift) and they taste just fabulous. My husband is already bugging me to make us our own batch!

But I'm not going to, because the only down side with these is the total calories. Yikes! Special occasions only.

These are so wonderful!!  I doubled the batch for a church BBQ and baked on a cookie sheet for 25 minutes.  I tasted one slightly warm with the chocolate still warm, I am going to have a hard time giving them away. They are the best peanut butter bars I have ever had. Seriously my eyes crossed a little bit with the first bite.

Wait a day, then rate these bars. They were WAY better the next day! Changes made: spelt flour in place of wheat. I also used Skippy Natural Creamy Peanut butter (perhaps a "rounded" cup of it). They are very peanutbuttery; exactly what I was looking for.

I was pretty disappointed in this recipe.  Very dry (too little butter too much egg??).  I don't know it was just weird.  I didn't have choc. chips so made without, but don't think that effected it that much.  Won't make again.

My husband went nuts over these bars!  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and he and a friend went through the entire pan in a day and a half.  I agree with other reviews that the peanut butter flavor could have been stronger, but when I made them a second time, I used MILK chocolate instead of semi-sweet and it really made a difference.  These are a new staple around our house!!

These were awesome - even with all of my "almost" mistakes.  I realized too late that my brown sugar was more like a brick of brown sugar (that thing could have been used in the pyramids) so I just used all white sugar and hoped for the best.  Guess what - it worked!  I almost forgot the flour, but got it in at the last minute and these were to die for (and I've never made any kind of bar in my life.)  Totally gooey and will make a repeat appearance whenever I'm asked to make a dessert.  Thanks!

Would be rating 5 stars, because the taste was really good, but it was more cake like than bar.  I added a bit more butter. Maybe next time, I'll cut back on the eggs.

Good texture on the bar.  I used milk chocolate chips because my PB does not contain sugar so it needed the boost for flavor.

These are very simple to put together if you are short on time.  A little greasy and not as much of a peanut butter taste as I would prefer.  I put peanut butter chips and chocolate chips in the batter and left off the chocolate chips on top.  Kids think they are the bomb!

The other reviewer had it right. These are a little dry when first made but are amazing the next day! I did add some extra milk to the recipe and used natural peanut butter. I will use more peanut butter next time and maybe a little more sugar, and milk chocolate instead of semisweet.  Definately has tons of potential.

This dessert was very easy to make and turned out to be delicious. I would have to agree with another review I read. These bars are much better after they've been refrigerated for a few hours. I will definitely make these again. :)

I followed what someone else said and used 2 eggs and an extra tbl spoon of butter.  They turned out well.  They were just too thin for the 9 x 13 pan, I'll use a 9 x 9 pan next time.

Just made these, and followed the directions exactly.  They turned out perfect! Not greasy at all? I wonder if it made a difference that I used an electric mixer, perhaps that helped? These are a hit. Simple to throw together quickly, and taste great!

My guys liked this one.  Only change I made was used the same amount of brown sugar as I did white; 1/4 C and I didn't put the chips in the batter just on the top.  Only problem I had was that I did not think the chips when far enough- you may need to double the amount for the top. EASY and good.

OMG these bars are awesome.  I only used two eggs (only had two left!) and bumped up the butter by one tbsp.  Otherwise, I made them exactly as described and they were too good to be true.  Rich rich rich, but amazingly delicious.
Perfect with a cup of coffee after dinner.  Thanks!

Exceptional. Husband says these are better than chocolate chip cookies (and that is saying a LOT). We included just a few chocolate chips in the batter, but mostly used them for the yummy frosting. A new household favorite.

My friend wanted my peanut butter bars for her birthday next week, but *gasp!* I lost the recipe! So I gave these ones a shot, and they're close. Moist w/o being greasy (like my old recipe) and they look nice too! I skipped the chocolate chips and they taste just fine to me. My friend will never know the difference!

YUM! I did change it up a bit, so that's why I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5...I used a whole stick (8tbsps.) butter, and only 2 eggs. Also, I baked this in an 11x7 baking pan, and that was the perfect thickness, IMO. I didn't use the chocolate chip topping, but only b/c hubby didn't want it, and they were for him, so... I did use the chips inside the batter, though (mini choco. chip), and that really made these extra tasty. My batter was also not too thick and was easily spread into the pan. Great peanut butter flavor...a keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

These turned out great. I was also able to make this gluten free and lowered the sugar. I used a mix of 3 parts millet flour to 1 part each of tapioca flour and sorgum flour. I used a small amount of choc chips in the batter, and skipped the frosting. Thanks for submitting the great recipe!

I made the plain version of these bars for part of my dad's birthday gift.  He's a big peanut butter fan.  Everyone said they were good, but I think I would like them better with the chocolate chips as I'm a chocolate fan.  I'll probably make them again when I want peanut butter cookies and don't have time to bake the individual cookies.

I think these bars are delicious.  I just made 2 batches (seperate) and each turned out the same.  A brownie like texture.  Yummy!  I added 1/2 pb chips, 1/2 choc. chips.  No chocolate on top.  I'm sure the soccer team will love them!

came out amazing- when I took them out of the oven, they looked really greasy- but I drained them off before putting chocolate on top.  Very easy recipe.

Not the best. Very cakey and not much flavor. I made a peanut butter buttercream frosting- refrigerated them after spreading it- and topped that with a chocolate ganache which made them much better but they were more like flat cakes than bar cookies.

I made these as directed without the chocolate chips. They were very good. For some reason, mine were of a nice chewy brownie texture, so that is what I called them. LOL.  Also, they were not overly sweet or peanut-buttery. Some might have thought they were not sweet enough, but I thought they were pretty good. Def. didn't last very long around here!

I made these as written, and was very pleased with the results.  They are dense like a brownie - I didn't find them dry at all.  Added bonus - they whip up in no time.  I'll be making these again.

I made these exactly as the recipe is written.  My hubby is raving about them, and he's a peanut butter addict.  I could take them or leave them.  I don't think the peanut butter flavor is strong enough...but hubby loves them!

These are the best bar cookies ever.  They lasted only an hour and a half in my household of six.  I did not change a thing - except a few extra chocolate chips in the dough.

WOW !!!!  I have found my new favorite cookie/bar/treat. I don't give 5 stars often, but this is definitely 5 *****'s !! I left out the chocolate chips and topped these little beauties with melted Hershey kisses. (I mixed a little Crisco in with the Hershey Kisses.)Thank you very much fro sharing this recipe. I will most definitely make these again. Merry Christmas :)

I loved this recipe. It was so super easy and quick to make. Once it came out of the oven, I poured the rest of the choc chips and a bag of pb chips, let them melt and then spread it out like a frosting. The kids came running!! Thanks for making smiles.....

These were more cakelike and dry than I'd hoped, so I think I will try another recipe which calls for less eggs. To be fair, I do think I overcooked these bars though.

I made this while I was procrastinating, which is always when I seem to be baking. Anyway, I followed this recipe exactly (minus the chocolate chips, I didn't have any) and they were delicious! They didn't seem hard to spread at all, I used my electric mixer and the dough turned out nice an fluffy and easy to spread. I could see why they would be stiff without an electric mixer though. Without the choco chips they needed a little more oomf, so I spread nutella on the cut bar. Heaven in a bar! This will satisfy all peanut butter lovers! Thanks for the recipe Missy Anne! I will make it again.

This was sooo good.  I used reduced fat peanut butter and I sprinkled the chocolate chips on top when it had 5 minutes left to bake and as soon as I took it out I spread it over the top.  Me and my friend ate them in 1 day!!!

I omit the chocolate and frost them with vanilla buttercream; tastes just like the peanut butter brownies we had in the school cafeteria 35 years ago! Thanks for a great recipe.

Good but too cakey.  They need to be more gooey--it's like they're missing something.  Perhaps more butter?

These are very good. I only made one half the recipe. I left out the chocolate chips (too lazy to run to the store) and baked them in a 9 inch round pan. After the "cake" had cooled, I cut it into wedges and sprinkled confectioner's sugar over it. It tasted very peanut buttery and soft--not greasy at all--and my family really liked it.

Just like my mom used to make when I was little but a lot easier.  Sometimes I don't put the chocolate on top, but if I am giving them as a gift, I don't omit the extra calories.

Just what my peanut butter craving needed! Didn't have any butter so I tried using sweetened condensed milk... shockingly, it worked okay!  I used natural crunchy peanut butter & it wasn't too sweet. Also, I wanted something a little lighter than the reviews suggested it would be so I added 1/4 tsp baking powder.

My family loves these bars and every time we take them to an event people always ask for the recipe!  I modified it slightly by adding 1/2 cup peanut butter chips and 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the batter.  For the frosting I usually mix 3/4 cup peanut butter chips and 3/4 cup chocolate chips.  This just adds a little more peanut butter flavor!Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This was very good as written.  Quick and easy, not very many ingredients, simple and easy to follow instructions.  My 7 year old niece helped me and she had a blast.  Good memories for her I hope.  I had to stretch my choc. chips, so my bad, but the recipe itself was just fine and they were yummy.  Thank you for sharing

These were very yummy!  The reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are VERY rich.  I could only eat a few bites before I felt sick, but those few bites were GOOD!  Will make again.

I'm giving these 4 stars because they were very quick and easy and had a good texture. I did not think they had much of a peanut butter flavor, so that's why I couldn't give them 5 stars. I added a little extra salt to the recipe and only two eggs since the eggs I had were very large. I did not find the dough to be very stiff and was able to easily spread it into the pan instead of pressing it in. The kids all liked them, but agreed that they did not have much of a peanut butter flavor. Thanks for the recipe. I will probably try these again, but use crunchy peanut butter next time so they will have more peanut taste to them.

This was simple and very good.  Instead of chocolate chips, I used caramel/chocolate chips.  Was a big hit.  Thanks for the recipe.

These bars are good.  I cut back the sugar just a tad (minus 1 tablespoon) so they turned out not as sweet.  Next time I'll leave out the chocolate chips for a more peanut butter taste, like the previous reviewers.  However the chocolate frosting is a hit-simple & goes well with the bar.

These were very easy to make, but I think next time I may try using milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet. I think the semi-sweet, overpowered the bar and I really could not taste all the peanut butter

almost perfect but not quite. next time, i will add either another 1/4 cup of brown sugar or some honey. since i made these for my husband, i left out the chocolate (he's not a fan), but i'm sure they would be a nice touch. we've been looking for a great peanut butter bar recipe; with some adjustments, this may be it.

This recipe turned out really well. These were quick to mix up and convenient to bake bars. I used all-natural chunky peanut butter. I took the advice of another reviewer and frosted them with peanut buttercream. I took these toa game night. They got rave reviews by everyone. Give this a try. You're gonna love them.

Excellent as written. My only change was to wait longer after sprinkling the chocolate chips over the top of the warm bars. I like having the chips stay intact instead of spreading them, so I let them cool longer before cutting. Thanks for sharing!

Terrific! Soft and delicious. We did add a little more flour at the end and used 1/2 cup total of mini chocolate chips. Cooked 25 minutes in convection oven. Great recipe.

I must start by saying I royally messed up this recipe.  I had looked at several others and decided on this, and immediately plopped in a full cup of butter!!  So I had to punt, hoping that the simplicity of this recipe would make up for my mistake.  Boy did it ever!!  I basically doubled the recipe, added a cup or so of uncooked oats, and only half the chocolate chips.  We were entertaining a group of women from Spain and Mexico and they thought they were the best cookies ever.  One asked for the recipe, and I told her the original, authentic recipe was easy, but I wasn't sure I could reproduce the other, in Spanish.  That is my homework.  

If my mistake can't ruin these cookies, nothing can.  I say give them a try.  I will do them again properly, but for tonight, everyone in my house is very happy with them.  Highly recommend.

It tasted da bomb!! I used crunchy peanut butter and it really made a nice texture. The time on the recipe for it to cook is totally WRONG. I checked it after 25 min of baking and it was raw batter. I must've doubled the time. Check the bars with a knife before assuming it is done. Once again, it tasted DA BOMB though.

These are DELISH!!  I've made them twice in the last week. I have to admit the first time I didn't read the recipe correctly and I dumped all of the chocolate chips into the batter (I used mini chocolate chips). I had more that I could have put on top but I decided that would be overkill. My husband took them to work and he said they were all gone before lunch!
The 2nd time I make them, half went to my family Christmas eve celebration and half is going with us to spend Christmas with my sister-in-law, but I did sneak a taste (or two or three...) and they were just as good as my first messed-up batch. In fact, they are addicting! Thank you so much for posting your recipe for such a delicious treat!

I had run across a "peanut lover's mix" of Reese's Pieces, pb chips and peanuts at the store, and wanted to make bars instead of cookies. I was a little leery of the three eggs called for, but wanted to make the recipe as directed, at least the first time. I found the bars not dry, but more doughy than I had wanted, since we usually prefer our brownies/blondies more fudgy than cakey. Next time I make these - and there *will* be a next time, because the flavor is good! - I'll stop at two eggs.

I really wanted to like this recipe and think I will try to make it again since there are so many good reviews. It has good flavor, but the reason I rated it at 3 stars is because it seems to not be fluffy enough. (I'm wondering if 1C may not be enough flour.) I'll update my review once I try again!

These are fantastic, I took the advice of other reviews and doubled my other ingredients, next time I won't double the wet ingredients or I'll increase the cornflakes by another 6 ounces. They are addictive and delicious.

I love this recipe, though I agree with what others said about it not fitting in such a big pan.  I used a 9"x9" pan and it was just right.  I left out the chocolate chips and instead used some boxed chocolates we had gotten for Christmas that had partially melted and re-solidified, so they didn't look nice enough to serve to company anymore.  I pressed the chocolates into the dough after it was in the pan so they'd be evenly spaced, and tried to mostly bury them in the peanut butter mixture.  The result, I have to admit, was unusual, but our family and guests all enjoyed it.  With each bite you never knew what kind of chocolate you were going to find!  I named the dish "Buried Treasure", but my husband called it "Land Mine Surprise", and of course that was the name that stuck!

Delicious and so easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with the results! Although the ingredients that go into this dessert seem very rich, the cookie was very light - delightful!

I made them exactly as the recipe said.  They came out dry, denser than expected, and very disappointing.  Surprising, since the dough was quite tasty.

I didn't have an issue with the dough being stiff. It was easy to spread. I took the advice of another member and softened the peanut butter & butter in the microwave first. Very good. Thanks!

Very good.  Didn't have a 9x 13 pan so put it in a mini muffin pan and then melted peanut butter and chocolate chips and spooned a little on the top of each one.  Everyone at work loved them.  Will make again.

Made these for a party and were a big hit.  I did use a little more flour because I thought they were to runny and also used milk chocolate chips instead because I only bake with milk chocolate.  Will make again and agree with other reviewers to add a little more peanut butter next time.  Very easy to make and very good!

These were pretty good. I made as-is and they werent very peanutty. Next time I will use the whole jar of peanut butter. I also found that after you put on the chocolate chips to pop them back into the oven (turned off) while its still warm-- it helps them melt faster and makes it easier to spread.

This recipe is awesome and simple. It calls for things that almost everyone has in their cupboards. We love these bars. They are a great treat in our home.

My grandmother and I used to make these every year at Christmas.  I have been trying to find the recipe and this is the closest one I've found so far.  We never mixed the chips into the batter, but I think it's better with them in!  Thanks!

I want to thankyou for the recipe that I have been searching for, about 8 years to be exact.  I made these tasty bars for my own wedding reception as part of a dessert tray, they went over fabulously, then I misplaced my recipe, how wonderful to find it again here!!  Thanks again!

I made this recipe with 4, four year olds and it was easy . We all loved them.I halfed the recipe and didn't put the choc. chips on top just baked it in. I misread it and put 3/4 cups chips in instead of halfing that also. I put in more vanalli. I was suprised that it  didn't have anything to make them rise ,uncertain how that would work, but it was good.I put in 2 eggs instead of 1&1/2 We'd make it again.

This was good, and we ate it all up right away- but when it comes to cookies that much only rates a three ;-) My husband has me searching for pb bar cookies that taste like a traditional chewy pb cookie and these didn't have the exact flavor he was looking for. Too many eggs??

Easy to make and a little greasy, but was not what I was expecting.  It's more like a peanut butter cookie bar than what I thought I peanut butter bar should be.  I won't be making these again.
