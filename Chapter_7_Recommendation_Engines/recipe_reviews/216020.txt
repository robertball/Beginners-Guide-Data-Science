I thought this was very good and so did my daughter.  We dug into it as soon as it came out of the oven.  The tapioca does a nice job thickening it and the walnuts are delightful.  I omitted the coconut only because I realized I didn't have any at the time.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I made a few tiny changes only to use what I had on hand. I did not have walnuts on hand so I increased the oats to 2/3 cup. Before tossing the apples with the filling ingredients, I tossed them in a little lemon juice and I used two tablespoons cornstarch instead of tapioca. I also added 2 tablespoons melted butter to the filling only to make more of a "filling" when it was combined with the juices of the apples during the baking process. Really, REALLY good. Jazz apples were on sale this week and a GREAT apple in this particular recipe. Crisp and slightly tart with a light sweetness. The smell of this while it was baking was ah-mazing! The one issue I had with this filling is it came out a little dry. When I try this again (and I will try this again), I'd make more of a juicier bottom by making a kind of apple pie filling out of either apple juice and water and the remaining ingredients. It could have been because my ingredients would not fit in a pie pan but I've really not had this happen before. The flavor was good and the sweetness was perfect--it just needs more "stuff" in the actual apple-y part. NOTE: My ingredients were too......much for a 9 inch pie pan. This fit into a 9x13 baking dish just right. 30 minutes at 350 degrees was just right for me.

This really was good. I did make a couple changes just out of necessity (didn't have any coconut and we have a slight walnut allergy in this family). I also did not measure the apples, and instead just sliced up 4 empire apples. I doubled the oats to make up for the coconut. And I also added 2 tablespoons of melted butter to the apple filling, because we like more of a pie type filling. As I said, this was excellent. Next time I will use at least one more apple, as I feel it was a little skimpy in the apple department. And I for sure want to try this with coconut! I used a 9x13 casserole dish for this, because I was concerned it would be too much for a 9 inch pie plate. I made homemade whipped cream and served this as a dessert for Thanksgiving. It got many compliments, and was definitely a favorite. I'll be filing this one away.

I made this and served with vanilla ice cream at my small group at church.  It was very good, but I don't know that it was any better than other apple crisp recipes I have tried.

Awesome topping. For the filling, I only used 4 thinly sliced apples: No sugar, spices, etc. The topping had enough flavor to take care of the apples. Perhaps a little less salt would be a good idea. I also did not use the coconut or nutmeg AND substituted a bit of the butter with vegetable oil.

Excellent recipe; however, I do agree with another reader that the butter may be a tad too much and definitely makes the paper liners greasey.
I chose not to process the oats in the food processor, preferring instead, to keep them as is and they add a great texture to the finished product.
I think next time, I'll try applesauce in place of the butter.  This recipe is really, really good!  A keeper!

This was delicious.  I used my own homemade apple filling but this recipes crisp.  The crisp was tasty, buttery, crispy and delicious!  Loved it.

The crumb topping came out very well. It had a nice texture that held together well.  I think there was too much vanilla, though--a little overpowering. The coconut blended in with the other ingredients. Maybe I'd taste it more with less vanilla.

I use my own home-made apple pie filling, and incorporate the topping from this recipe.  My husband enjoyed it so much that he asked me to make it for his company Christmas party.

I am really surprised this was a 5 star recipe. It tasted fine, was not bad, but I have definitely made better. It did reheat in the over well for a later eating. I'd call it mediocre and will not make it again.

I made this recipe as submitted, the first time with Granny Smith apples. The topping was great but the apples turned to mush. The second time I used Honey Crisp apples. They held their shape and made a great dessert.

Topping came out way too dry and the main body was too thick for my liking. The tapioca does a great job of thickening, yet there simply was insufficient fluid to create a nice syrup. Next time, I will skip the nuts, reduce the oatmeal and add something for liquid to the apples.  I believe the issues are due to the apples I used and possibly I made some errors in measurement of the topping (?). Very tasty, simply could be far better & I certainly will try again.

I would use a little less sugar, especially if serving with ice cream.  I did double the spice in the filling and added about an 1/8 tsp of cloves to both the filling and topping.  I also substituted the same amount of corn starch for the tapioca and it turned out fine.  So YUMMY!

This apple crisp is the best I have made.  I put the walnuts into the food processor instead of stirring them into the mix.   The rest of the recipe I followed exact. I used Granny Smith apples.  I made this for a Sunday night family dinner dessert and everyone loved it.  We ate it warm with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top!  Delicious! Will be making this one again and again.  Great Fall dessert. :)
