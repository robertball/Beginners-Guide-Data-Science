Ok, I really played with this recipe...but gosh, it is such a good comforting meal!  I grilled my sausages and made my own beef gravy with stock I thickened up.  I uses Emeril's cheddar, onion mashed potatoes and let me tell you...this was better then anything you'd get in a pub!  Delish!!!

this is exactly how I make them (minus the chicken broth/milk idea for the potatoes)- some recipes call for beef sausage, i always stick to pork- better flavor with the gravy...
this recipe is very easy and very tasty!!!

This came out fantastic!  I made some changes, based on what I had.  I used turkey sausage and used my own mashed potatos recipe.  It was simple, tasty and comforting.  I served it with some smashed peas with mint.  Definately a keeper.

this is a very good dish that I will make again. Just to make it easier, I grilled the sausages and then cut them up and added them to the bottom of the casserole dish. Then I layered on some gravy I had made. ( I addedBistro! a british gravy powdew to the pan with the sausage drippings and whisked in some water and veg stock.) Then I added the onions and bell pepper mixture and then the mashed potato. Very yummy for the winter.

The "mash" part was a little salty for my tastes, although the entire 6 lbs. were eaten, so maybe it's just me.   Used grilled polish sausage because that's all I had...again, no complaints.  A good meal, that makes me want to take a nap.

This is what I would call comfort food - left out the onion (allergy to them) and sticked to how I usually make me mashed potatoes.  Added some Irish soda bread for an at home St. Paddys day celebration :)

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  My husband requested the dish... I'd never even heard of it.   He said I pulled it off pretty well. The recipe was really easy to follow, and I was surprised how easy it was to cook. I did make my own recipe mashed potatoes though, so I can't attest to the ones in this recipe. Thanks for the recipe!!

Pretty good, but I was very disappointed that it called for processed canned gravy. I went ahead & just made the gravy. To do this, add three table spoons of butter to the onions after they have sautéed to soft. Add the remaining herbs & spices called for in the original recipe. Stir while you allow the butter to melt. Add up to a 1/4 cup of flour a little at a time. Stirring until the flour combines with the butter to a paste consistency. Cook for a couple of minutes. Add one cup of beef stock. Stir to mix. Allow to cook stirring regularly until the liquid thickens to a gravy consistency. A delicious comfort food dinner! I  like to accompany mine with green peas for a little color & veg.

This is a good recipe to start with. I went to my local butcher shop and got a package of authentic Irish banger sausage. For the recipe, I pan-fried my sausages, then removed them as noted, to sauté the onions, which I did for somewhat less than the five minutes suggested, because we like them to still be crunchy, so long enough just to heat them through. Also, I never buy canned gravy, so I made some pan gravy. I removed the onions from the skillet, added some beef stock that I had in the fridge to and brought that to a boil while stirring with the juices still in the pan. I gradually sprinkled in a bit of Wondra flour to thicken it up just a little and then dropped the onions back into the mixture and stirred everything together. I let the whole thing simmer for another 8-10 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes. I prefer to mix the onions into the gravy to give the gravy more of a flavor kick. For the potatoes, I did not add the chicken bouillon; rather, i drizzled a little bit of the beef stock in while I was mashing. When I had mashed the potatoes done and plated, I added the sausage on the potatoes and ladled the gravy mixture over everything. It was yummy!

This was great! Very easy meal to prepare. Here are the changes I made: didn’t use the bouillon cubes, didn’t prick the sausages (as advised by previous reviewers) so they would stay juicy and made gravy from my own homemade beef stock. Can’t handle canned gravy! Used Johnsonville beer brats. Will definitely make again!

I will make my own gravy next time, but otherwise this is a super easy recipe, and a crowd pleaser. Made it for one of our World Cup patties, and it disappeared!

Yummy comfort food! I made my own gravy because I am not big on canned stuff. Other than that, really great and easy recipe that you could easy tweak to your own taste. Also would recommend salt and pepper for the potatoes.
