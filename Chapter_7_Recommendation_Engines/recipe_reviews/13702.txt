This recipe could be presented as either a salad or a desert! Nice blend of flavors & textures. I substituted 2 sm cans of mandarin oranges for the fresh & it turned out great! The dates didn't stand out very much, though, so next time I might try another dried fruit. Very pretty presentation!

I thought this was okay. I used rehydrated dried cranberries, used kiwi instead of apple (what I had...). The flavor was good, but the texture of the frozen cream cheese/OJ/cream mixture wasn't very nice, like ice cream that melted and refroze.

Very original and fun to put together. I want to serve this as a dessert for Christmas dinner so I thought I'd give it test run. Really good. Again, very original in taste and presentation. I would have liked slightly more flavour. Maybe a little orange extract. Of course it could be just me because the taste is already nice. I'll try again and see. I think this will be my "something new" at Christmas. I'm looking forward to watching every one's reaction.
