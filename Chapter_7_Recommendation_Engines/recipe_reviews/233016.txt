This is a quick and easy family dinner,and I agree with the reviewer who mentioned your alfredo sauce will make or break this meal.  I used Prego's alfredo with bacon and we loved it!  Not having to chop the blend of vegetables which includes asparagus, carrots, red bell pepper, and peas, made this a super fast pasta dish.  I used fusilli since I'm out of fettucini, but any pasta will do.  I would make this again if I'm pressed for time.

Grand daughter thought this dish was "awesome"! Nice combination of vegetables. Quick and easy meal that tastes like it took forever. I used a cheese alfredo sauce but you can use your favorite to make this recipe your own.

This was good. Though I added salt & pepper, fresh garlic, some fresh basil and some fresh grated parmesan.

This was very tasty and easy to make.  Using the Birds Eye Recipe Ready Primavera veggies makes it convenient and quick to prepare!

Yum! This meal is so simple to make and can be thrown together quickly on a busy day using things you most likely already have in your pantry.
The Bird's Eye veggies tasted very fresh and tasty. They are very pretty and add so much color to the dish.
A couple of tips, if you grill the chicken and then slice it into thin strips it adds a lot of flavor, plus cuts out the oil. 
How you feel about this dish is going to depend a lot on what type of sauce you use. I used a home made garlic-alfredo that I had prepared ahead of time. The garlic added a whole new delicious dimension to this. This is a great base, but you're going to need to add spices. Garlic, black pepper, etc. whatever tickles your fancy will work with this.

the family thought this was tasty for the quick fix of needing a super fast throw together recipe. This is a recipe to go to, if you want pasta with quick convenience right out of the freezer. Even though I love fresh veggies, it's a great sub for when you need dinner on the run. With shorter steps of a jar alfredo sauce, frozen veggies and you could totally add the convenience of pre-cooked chicken to boot to make it faster and skip the step of slicing and cooking your chicken (for time constraints)...however, the family enjoyed and was together in no time to fuss over.

This was really good. I used Bertolli® Light alfredo sauce thinned with a little white wine and about a 1/4 cup Birdeye® recipe ready onions and garlic along with the Recipe ready product called for in the recipe.  I used shrimp instead of chicken and used farfalle pasta.  It cooked up super quick and made a very easy weeknight meal.  I would make this again.

This was very easy and quick! Awesome for a busy day. Much better than take-out. I like that the vegetables are all ready cut up and I don't have to buy a lot of all different things. They don't turn into mush when cooked either. Season to your liking and this makes for a nice family meal. I served this with garlic bread and cantaloupe. My guys are not really into salad, but a salad would be a perfect side dish with this.

I prepared this recipe for dinner tonight, and I made only one change:  I used 1 1/2 cups of Alfredo sauce.  The plate was colorful and interesting in appearance.  This would easily fill the bill for a desperation dinner, where the ingredients can be readily on hand for an evening when the cook (me!) is pressed for time or ideas!  Also, pre-cooked, leftover chicken would speed things along.  I really like Alfredo with shrimp, too, so feel free to customize according to what you have on hand.

My hubby and I really enjoyed this recipe! I think the sauce you use will make the biggest impact on taste and how it comes together. The frozen veggie mix was quick and easy, and complemented the pasta and rice nicely. I seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder while cooking and otherwise followed the instructions exactly. I used Prego Homestyle Alfredo sauce. Yumm!

I thought this was descent. I followed the recipe as is, except instead of using only a cup of alfredo I used the whole 16oz jar I bought. I have made a similar recipe with fresh steamed broccoli and pre-made alfredo that worked fine. Just use a good brand of alfredo sauce. I prefer the fresh vegetables version, but this was fine considering it was so quick to make and it was too hot today to be in the kitchen too long. Plan to eat right after making, as it does get dry the next day.

I prefer fresh veges, but they aren't always available. The recipe ready veges are a nice substitute when you aren't able to use fresh because of the season or a busy schedule. I made homemade Alfredo sauce with garlic and thyme which added great flavor to this dish. I also seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before searing. This was a quick and easy meal.

Very easy meal for a busy family.  I could find the Bird’s eye Primavera so I used fresh carrots, tomatoes and zucchini. Very yummy.
