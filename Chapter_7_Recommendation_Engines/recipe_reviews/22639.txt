I made a lot of changes, but only to lower the calories and add more veggies. For the sauce, I chopped 1 onion, 3 tomatoes, and 1 green pepper in the food processor. I combined with 15 oz canned mushrooms and 8 oz tomato sauce.  I then added pasta seasoning (basil, oregano, etc.), but did not cook.  I used bowtie pasta and layered: 1/2 pasta, 1/2 sauce, cottage cheese, 1/2 pasta, 1/2 sauce, mozzarella cheese. This made 8 large servings at only 250 calories each.

This was very good!  I made it exactly as written and we loved it.  You could definitely add other vegetables to the sauce and change it up any way you prefer.  I always make recipes as they are printed before adding my own touches though and this one is definitely 5 stars as written!

Tasty basic recipe--kind of dish that both adults and kids would like. I followed recipe exactly except that I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese (I'm sure either is fine), and I added two cloves of crushed garlic to the sauce. Some of the pasta on the top got a bit hard and crusty--perhaps putting foil loosely on top would prevent this?

I've been making this for years and I really like it. I do a few things differently-I saut√© the onion in olive oil in a saucepan, along with 1-2 cloves of chopped or pressed garlic. Then I add the other sauce ingredients to the pot. I also add some basil-maybe a teaspoon. I think the next time I might also use a little more macaroni, maybe cook 9 oz instead of 8 oz. I also wonder if maybe ricotta cheese would be better than cottage cheese. Anyway, it's a really good recipe.

This was very good!  I also used ricotta cheese because I didn't have cottage cheese.  Mine also got a little crusty on the top, so next time I will cover with foil.

What's not to love about this dish?  I must admit that I made one major substitution by halving the recipe and using a jar of Trader Joe's Traditional Marinara Sauce (sorry about that to all those who don't like reviews that change the recipe!).  I divided the ingredients between two cereal-bowl-sized Corning dishes, following the stated proportions of cheese.  I couldn't help but scarf down a few healthy spoonfuls after snapping my photos!  Total comfort food!  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! I needed a recipe that used things I already had on hand, so I used a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of making the simple tomato one, and added sliced roma tomatoes to one of the layers, canned mushrooms to another, and used whole wheat pasta shells.  I did loosely cover the top with foil as others have suggested and that worked well.  Took the foil off near the end, just to brown it up.  A great-tasting, simple, and quick meal I'll make again.  The leftovers were also equally good and went quickly.

I used Cheddar Cheese instead of Mozzarella.  Good dish.  I think this dish would do fine with any cheese or a combination of a few.

My family enjoyed this. I added 1/2 Tbsp. minced garlic to the tomatos, and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Will make again.

Also add 3/4 teaspoon garlic to the sauce.  3T minced onion from a jar can be substituted for a fresh onion.

I've made this 3 times each time tweaking it.   From your recipe not enough sauce got 8 ounces of macaroni.  Everybody loves it!
