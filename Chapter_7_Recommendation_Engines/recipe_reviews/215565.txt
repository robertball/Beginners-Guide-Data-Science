This was so good!  My search for a great beef stew is finally over.  My husband raved about it while he was eating it, mentioned it again later that night, and then raved again when we had leftovers the next night.    I cooked the beef stew on low overnight and had my husband shut it off when he got up so it would cool enough for me to put it in the refrigerator before I left for work.  It was so good I couldn't stop taking bites.    That night, I let it simmer on the stove for about an hour while I made some corn bread to go with it and I had all I could do not to take a bowl.   But I convinced myself to wait until I thickened it and it was so worth it.    I made no changes to the recipe other than not putting in the mushrooms (my husband hates them) and I used regular paprika and diced tomatoes since that is what I had.  I had never put tomatoes in a beef stew but I really think it added something.    Thanks for sharing.

Outstanding! I made minor changes: omitted the wine since I didn't have any and the mushrooms because I don't like them in stew, increased carrots, celery, potatoes by about 50%. This is now THE stew recipe at my house!

I really liked this. I changed a little bit but overall was the same recipe. I didn't have marsala so i used dry white wine and i used regular paprika. The flavor is great, i will make that again.

Delicious!  I made as written with a few enhancements.   I added some spices from another recipe - one heaping teaspoon rosemary, one teaspoon parsley and two bay leaves.  What flavor!  Because several people commented that there was too much juice, I only used 1 can of beef broth instead of three.  As it cooked it became plenty juicy.  Then after 11 hours in the crock pot I removed about a cup of juice, boiled it and added the cornstarch to thicken.  Then I added it back to the crock pot and stirred.  Perfect!  This is going to be a staple at my house.

I really wanted this recipe to blow me away with the marsala wine and tomatoes. It was definatly really good but I would haave liked more.......... something. I read the reviews about most of the seasoning getting lost in the excess flour so instead of a resealable bag I seasoned the beef in a container w/ a lid and shook untill the meat was seasoned evenly. Then I added 2 tbsp of flour and shook again. The meat was coated prefectly w/ out loosing any flavor.  Other than that I made everything else as written. This was very good, but very classic, nothing extrodinary. I will not be making this again.

This is a very nice change from the bay leaf recipies I normally use.  I used a Sweet Marsala and it added a really nice hint of sweetness to it.  I did thicken the gravy a bit more at the end by spooning the juice into another pan and thickening it separately then mixing it back in to the slowcooker... turned out wonderfully delicious!  Highly recommend this recipe!

My husband & I really enjoyed this stew!  We love crock pot cooking since it's easy & typically yields enough for left overs.  I left out the wine since we don't care for that flavor, used 2.5 pounds of chuck and low sodium broth since organic wasn't available. Still delicious with the slight changes. We paired it with homemade biscuits.

We assembled this with our cooking group then, my family tried the frozen, place everything in the crock pot method--and it was simply, delicious and full of flavor! Total time saver! I will certainly be making this again!

This is the perfect stew recipe for someone who has never tried to make stew before.  It gives you the basic proportions and you can leave out or add ingredients to suit your tastes.  I added a little bit of gravy flour at the end to thicken.  This was delicious!

This was OK.  Even after adding the flour the gravy was too thin for us.  And there just wasn't much taste.  Won't be making this one again I am afraid.

I have just made this for the 2nd time.  Absolutely perfect!!  I used red wine instead of marsala wine because that is what I had.  Also, I left out the paprika because I didn't have any.  This did not make a difference.  This is the best beef stew I've ever had or made!!

5 years later, and this has become an old regular FAVORITE in our home!!  I cannot rave enough about this recipe!!  I usually make sure to have the marsala wine, because I just love the flavor that it adds, but regular red wine is fine too!   Still have never used the smoked paprika, just regular paprika from the spice rack!  I make this 2 or 3 times throughout the fall/winter, and it's ALWAYS everyone's FAVORITE!!

Excellent and VERY easy! I made mashed potatoes and served them in the bottom of the bowls and put the stew on top. A very hearty meal for a very hungry family!

Make-Ahead Slow Cooker Beef Stew Haiku: "'Stew' and 'Haiku' rhyme! Nevermind that, this was good! Thick, hearty stew, yum!" Halved the recipe, and due to what I had available, had to use diced tomatoes instead of crushed, non-organic beef broth (pfft, I don't always buy into the "organic" marketing), and regular paprika. But wow, when I got home from work, I swear I was like a cartoon character being beckoned to the kitchen with a wafting finger of aroma - smelled awesome! Taste was great on a chilly night; looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!

Excellent recipe! It's one of the best beef stews I've ever made, and it was easy and didn't take a lot of time to prepare. I substituted regular paprika for smoked, used 4 potatoes, 3 celery stalks, and 1/4 c rice wine with 1 T brandy instead of marsala wine. I don't think any of these alterations made a huge difference, and I will definitely make this recipe again!

I thought this was an excellent dish\.  My whole family loved it!  Had to make a couple modifications due to a tomato and mushroom allergy, but otherwise didn't mess with it the first time.  Added the thickener and don't think it did much.  Ended up serving it over mashed potatoes and that worked well.  Next time I may cut back on the broth a bit and see how that works out.

This was delicious and very easy.  I wish the beef was more tender; it wasn't bad, just wasn't melting in my mouth.  Not sure hot to fix that in the future.  But very hearty and will be making again for sure!

This recipe was incredible. The problem I tend to have with beef stew is that the meat turns out too dry. This version leaves the meat tender and delicious. Thank you BusySpoons!

This is definately a keeper!  Easy to make and the whole family loved it!  I did flour and brown the meat on the stove, but don't see this as a needed step if it is cooked on low.  The only wine on hand was a cabernet, so used it and it tasted great.  Will definately make this for both home and church.

Increase the marsala wine to at least 1/2 cup and use it to deglaze the pan after frying the beef. Then pour this into the slow cooker. There's a lot of flavor in the pan. Add some garlic. Instead of worcestershire sauce, I like teriyaki sauce. Thicken the stew with cornstarch and water when it's done. Also goes great with dumplings.

My family loved this stew! I served it with toasted hunks of crusty sour dough,  It was a perfect  meal for a cold day. It was fork tender in 4.5 hours in my slow cooker on high.

This was a fantastic recipe! I didn't have any wine so I didn't add that. I did add corn and peas. I also used some of our Scottish Highland beef that we raise here on our farm. Real lean beef grown the old way all natural. Also added a little more garlic and it turned out the best stew that we have ever ate in our lives!! Thank you BusySpoons!

This was pretty good. I made it exactly as written only using regular paprika instead of smoked. It could have used a little more salt, and it definitely needed to be thickened.

I like to make freezer crock pot meals. I doubled this recipe  so I had one cooking in the c.p., and prepared the 2nd batch for freezing. With that one, I found it much simpler to combine all the ingredients, (minus the vegetables) with the pre-browned beef in a freezer bag and placed the bag in a bowl until it was frozen. I will just need to add the fresh veg. or a bag of frozen stew veg. to the c.p. along with the 
beef & tomato mixture.

Loved this!  Omitted the mushrooms, used Cherry Red Wine, did not have beef stock so used one cup water mixed with one tablespoon soy sauce, and used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes that I pureed.  I think the pureed tomatoes and one cup water w/ soy sauce made this a hearty, thicker, flavorful meal.  As others have stated, the 3 cups of beef stock would be a bit too much liquid.

De-glazed the pan used to cook the beef and onion (I left out the mushrooms) and poured all the liquid into the crock pot.  As we're a small family, I froze half of it to use at another day, as the chef suggested!  I also added a potato and 1 carrot and 1 stalk celery.  I used Hungarian Paprika, as well.  This will now be the Beef Stew recipe we will use!  NO leftovers :)

I made this as written except I substituted red wine for Marsala.  It takes a lot of time to prepare!  It requires more corn starch to thicken all the broth, and it needs more salt.  While it was basically a good stew, I thought it was missing "something".  Perhaps that "something" was the unique flavor of Marsala.  Try it for a nice change from the ordinary beef stew.

I made this following the recipe.  It was great.  Serve with nice crusty bread because it yields a lot of juice/gravy!

This was fantastic. The only thing I didn't add was wine. This had a great flavor to it. My wife loved it. I know what I will be bringing with me for lunch tomorrow.

Even without the soup mix and the mushrooms, my husband and son loved this. I didn't have beef broth but had beef base.  I mixed 1 1/2 Tablespoons with a quart of water and added in place of the 3 cans of broth. I didn't add the cornstarch either. Red wine is an acceptable substitution for marsala.

I'd like to make a suggestion to make this recipe a bit less wasteful: Instead of tossing the meat and the flour in a plastic bag, you can simply stir everything together in a large bowl. Works just as well and creates less trash that will take decades to decompose in the landfill. :-) Same goes for the crock pot liner: It's really not that hard to clean a pot now, is it? :-)

Loved it! I had to make a few substitutions, as I didn't have all of the ingredients on-hand. I had no mushrooms, no Worcestershire sauce, beef broth, paprika, crushed tomatoes, or cornstarch. I substituted a bit of Bragg's Liquid Aminos for the Worcesterhsire sauce, used water instead of beef broth, and did w/out the paprika, crushed tomatoes and cornstarch.  I DID add some rosemary from my garden and a bay leaf, when browning the meat, AND in the crock pot.  I also used salt-free Garlic Herb Sensation by The Spice Hunter (Pavillions) in place of seasoned salt...and added some regular salt and pepper.  It turned out EXACTLY like my mom used to make...and her recipe box was lost, so I was thrilled to find this one!

Very good beef stew. Perfect blend of flavors. The only thing I did differently was instead of mushrooms which we do not care for in stew I used cubed turnip. Leftovers were very good and had enough to throw in the freezer for a meal for hubby  when I am not home.

This was great! My son, who is a very picky eater, thought it was wonderful and that means a lot! The first time I made it I didn't have the Spanish smoked paprika so I substituted creole seasoning. It gave it a kick but it was a little too much. I am making it again right now with the Spanish smoked paprika. I couldn't fine it in the stores so I ordered it online at Amazon. I will make this the rest of my life!

Outstanding. I have made it twice and both times it was amazing. I forgot to add all the seasonings the second time but didn't notice a taste difference. And it was definitely easier to make the second time. I put the beef,  mushrooms and onions to the side,  chopped up everything else and threw them in the slow cooker,  and did the beef combo lost. Makes about 10 cups.

I have never given a 1 star review, but I was so upset over the results of this. I made this EXACTLY per recipe.  THIS IS NOT BEEF STEW..all I can taste is the can of crushed tomatoes!  I came home all excited for this dish for dinner and it smelled amazing in my house, but then I dipped in to taste it and BLAH - it was like tomato soup with beef and vegetables in it.  This didn't even taste a little like beef stew. I took out all the liquids and rebuilt it again without the tomatoes and salvaged it to where it was tolerable, but I will NEVER use this recipe again.

Honestly, I can't stand stew and will only make it when desperate during the winter.  This was a great surprise.  The meat was "like butter" and the flavors were delicious.  I didn't have crushed tomatoes so used diced...no big deal at all.  In my rush to get everything into the crock pot before work, I didn't read the reviews.  After the fact, I did, and absolutely agree with reviewers that said there was too much liquid.  Next time I will half the broth, and even at that, it still may be too much!  Eyeball it.  Other than that, this was delicious.

Followed this recipe EXACTLY as written, including using real Spanish SMOKED paprika, something most reviewers admit they did not do. It has been in the crockpot for about eight hours on low. It smells good, but the flavor is very strong and tastes very much like the smoked paprika. I'm okay with that as my family is from Spain and we use that spice in many dishes. It is not a traditional American beef stew flavor, however. I'm not sure anyone other than me will really like it. I've done several samples and agree with some of the other reviewers that it is somewhat bland. It needs "something". I'm reluctant to just add a lot of salt but I do think that would help, although I'm not sure that's the best solution healthwise. As of right now what is in the crockpot is more of a soup than a stew, sort of the consistency of typical beef barley. The paprika also has made the entire thing pretty red in color, not at all like the photo and again not a typical looking American beef stew. I am going to serve it with a crusty bread for soaking up the broth, will add more salt, and will keep my fingers crossed that it is better tomorrow, as some reviewers have stated. I am giving it three stars now as it doesn't look anything like the photo and is definitely missing something it needs to give it a more full bodied flavor.

The was a perfect recipe and easy enough for my daughter to prepare.  I omitted the tomatoes (not what I would add to stew) and I used regular paprika.  Will definitely be making this again.

I substituted the crushed tomatoes for a can of sun dried tomatoes.  It added a zest of flavor without drying out the meat. Fast, easy, and a perfect meal for almost any football game.

Major Hit!!
Few alterations include:
In the seasoned flour, we just used 2 tsp homemade essence (same recipe you can buy @ the store, except the smoked paprika, mine has the smoked paprika), which already has the paprika, pepper salt, Ect. (love the smoked paprika)
Didn't have fresh mushrooms, so used pkg onion mushroom soup mix instead of just onion soup mix.
For veggies I used about 5 potatoes, 5 carrots and a bag of mixed veggies I had on hand.
Didn't have any wine, so just left that out.
We used bullion to made 4 cups broth, one can of roasted diced tomatoes &
did not use cornstarch, but saved the excess flour from the meat & added it about a couple hours in.
Was a major hit w/ the entire family (even the 1 year absolutely loved it), hubby said was the best beef stew he'd ever had.
Will definitely be using this recipe again!!

It turned out wonderful and tastes a lot like Dinty Moore Beef Stew. I made some minor adjustments. I cooked the potatoes separately to prevent over cooking them. I only used one carrot finely sliced and cooked separately.   I also omitted the Celery because we were having a snow storm and Celery was not worth a trip to the store! I used a can of Hunt's Diced Tomatoes which were already seasoned with Basil, Garlic and Oregano instead of the Tomato Paste.  I used 3.5 pound of Stew meat and 16 ounces of whole white Mushrooms which I pre-steamed prior to adding to the Crock Pot so my ingredients would fit nicely. And I used regular Paprika.  I see Recipes as a guide and work with what I have on hand.

I only had 1.54 lbs of beef stew so I improvised with adding 2 sweet potatoes, along with the 4 smaller sized Yurkon Gold Potatoes, a yellow onion and a large white onion. Additionally some green snap peas! I will add to my review after this is done! I am choosing to cook on low all night. Thinking that will certainly be enough, but time will tell:)

Just made this for the second time and it's delicious! The first time I didn't have smoked paprika and I think that made a difference to the final taste this time.  I always make a new recipe to the letter of the ingredients and instructions, however this second time, my hand "slipped" with the Marsala, so this batch has a few splashes more. I added more veggies and included some turnip and parsnip. It made a huge pot and is enough to feed hubby and I for about 5 meals. This freezes very well as I learned from the first time .

New to Allrecipes & this is my first review! Made this for me and my hubby. FABULOUS! I used 2 lbs of chuck tender steaks because they were on sale. I cut them up in cubes while they were frozen. Followed recipe EXCEPT for the following changes. Used regular Paprika because that is what I had. Omitted mushrooms and tomatoes due to personal taste and omitted wine because I didn’t have any on hand. After I put the beef in the crock pot, I put 1/2 cup of  beef broth in the pan I cooked the beef in, warmed it and to got all the drippings I could and poured it into crock pot. Used 4 stalks of celery instead of 2 because celery is not appreciated as much as it should be ?. Instead of 31.5 ounces of beef broth, I used 20 ounces because of the reviews stating the sauce was too thin with original recipe. (This includes the 1/2 cup I used to get the drippings from the pan). I used store brand beef broth, onion soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, Olive Oil and Dollar Tree spices. Made a whole batch of Sweet Dinner Rolls dough from Allrecipes and split it to make both dinner rolls and cinnamon rolls. WHAT A WONDERFUL MEAL! Cost $11.43 for one big meal (including the rolls) for 2 and four servings of leftovers. Will be adding this to my repeat recipes.

The flavor is really good!! My final broth did not need to be thickened at all. I didn't make many changes. I only used two cans of broth; I used a bigger can of whole tomatoes, because I couldn't find a smaller one. I used all of the juice from the can of tomatoes and removed three big tomatoes; I had to actually remove a cup of liquid from the pot once everything was in there because the pot was too full; I used about 6-7 small red skinned potatoes and a whole bag of baby carrots; I added an extra TB of Worcestershire sauce to the broth and about a Tsp of sea salt. I cooked it for 9 hours on low and then left it on warm for 3-4 hours. The meat fell apart, but the veggies stayed in tact and didn't turn mushy. I was concerned that a 12 hour cook would make the veggies mushy. I will definitely make this again.

This turned out sooooo good! Will make again for sure!  I took some suggestions from reviews. Don't like mushrooms and didn't have the wine, so left those out.  Added extra carrots, celery, and potatoes and used regular paprika.

I am not a cook. Husband does most of that or we're off to a restaurant. I found this fast easy recipe and when my man walked in the kitchen after a hard day of work he was most pleasantly surprised by the delicious kitchen smell.  He loved this.  This is a wonderful recipe. Very flavorful and gave me a bit of confidence in the kitchen. Can't go wrong with this. Yum!

I've been searching for a beef stew recipe for years. This is it!  My kids loved it too. I prepped the meat the night before & added everything to slow cooker the next am. After the 10 hours on low, I transferred it to stove top to simmer for 30 minutes & added cornstarch to thicken. It really was great!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. My family  and I enjoyed it so much we're having seconds today. I just started getting into my slow cooker this year it's great. Saves not only time but I'm super mom again without having to be over the stove for more than a hour. This is a must try. Thanks!!!??

I made this today.  It was so good!  I wasn't able to fit all of the beef broth in my crockpot, so I followed the directions exactly, except only used 2 cans of beef broth.  At the end I added some wondra (flour & water) to thicken.  Definately will be making this again!

I made the double recipe, cooked one and froze the other. Both pots were delish! Would have liked to had left-overs the day after but unfortunately, too many people tasted it and that was it.

I really enjoyed this stew. Even my little girl gobbled it up without complaining (this is an amazing feat). I tripled the recipe and used red wine instead, plus threw in some Italian seasoning. When I cooked the meat I used all the flour mixture and that helped thicken the stew up a bit. The only thing was that it was time consuming to prepare the stew. It worked great for a Saturday night dinner, but to do it before work on a weekday would require a very early morning. All in all...yum!

This was great. I did use some of the beef broth to deglaze my frying pan.  Maybe that evaporated enough to make a difference.  I also tilted the lid for the last 2 hours.  All together it wasn't too watery.  I added salt at the table, others didn't.  Aside from that it was great!  Thank you!

It turned out wonderful and tastes a lot like Dinty Moore Beef Stew. I made some minor adjustments. I cooked the potatoes separately to prevent over cooking them. I only used one carrot finely sliced and cooked separately.   I also omitted the Celery because we were having a snow storm and Celery was not worth a trip to the store! I used a can of Hunt's Diced Tomatoes which were already seasoned with Basil, Garlic and Oregano instead of the Tomato Paste.  I used 3.5 pound of Stew meat and 16 ounces of whole white Mushrooms which I pre-steamed prior to adding to the Crock Pot so my ingredients would fit nicely. And I used regular Paprika.  I see Recipes as a guide and work with what I have on hand.

Rave reviews. Followed the recipe exactly. It filled a large crock pot and fed 6 adults that night. I think people would’ve had seconds but there weren’t any. I will definitely make again. The flavor was outstanding!

Takes about 7-8 hours in the slow cooker instead of 4. Really good with a bit of Smokey Chipotle sauce and Habenero Sauce.

Looking back, I notice that a lot of the positive reviews mention using regular paprika. I used smoked like the recipe called for. It has a strange taste.  Won’t make again.

I followed the recipe it’s turned out delicious but I did have to add corn starch until it was thicken to my taste. I was getting inpatient with the crook pot so 3 hours into it I transferred the stew to stove top at low simmer until done turned out just fine. We wanted to eat dinner sooner than later

Beef stew is one of my favorites but I didn’t love this. I don’t know if it was the smoked paprika or the tomatoes or the wine but for me it was bland, a little bitter, and overall nowhere near as savory as a traditional beef stew. It was worth a try but I won’t make it again.

Doubled it. Already had the meat cooked so I didn't do step 1 & 2 other than fry the onions. Any red wine should do. I had IKEA's Glogg, a mulled wine,  that I had on hand. I needed a bigger pot than my crock pot so I cooked it on the stove in my extra large dutch oven. I simmered it for about 4 hours. Everything was perfect!

Great. The only change is that I made it in a 

Pressure cooker. 1 hour and it was ready.

I love this recipe and have made it a few times. I usually just throw all the ingredients in the crockpot (minus the flour) without throwing the meat in the pan first. Mostly because of time. I also cut the tomato and double the meat.

I really enjoyed this beef stew.  Perfect for winter.  I didn't have any mushrooms so just left them out.  My mother never had any mushrooms in her stew so figured I wouldn't miss them.  It was still delicious.  I will make again for sure.

It wasn't cooked in 4 hours on high.  I cooked it 6 hours and the carrots weren't quite the way I liked them, so after eating it for dinner, I'm cooking the rest for another 2 hours on low.

I did thicken it with cornstarch.  Husband and I really liked it.

Very Yummy!!! Although I did switch the peeled potatoes to red potatoes halved and it gave the stew a more colorful look.

I had to leave out some seasonings because we got snowed in, but had all the veggies and  meat on hand.  It was wonderful!  My husband really liked it, too.  We'll definitely make it again soon. It thickened nicely on its own, but we made biscuits to enjoy with our salad.

Pretty much followed the recipe except no celery and no soup mix. I’ll make it again. I used $3.99 a pound beef from Kroger and cut it into cubes myself.

Just an update on my previous review.  I decided the Worcestershire sauce was a little heavy.  This is a wonderful base recipe but I think next time I'll use a bouquet garne with some bay leaf.  Can't have ANY alcohol because of my meds, but think a heavy red, and a bit more than called for in this recipe, would go well.  Used the slurry any appreciated the difference.  Should have done a better job of removing any remaining olive oil after browning the meat and cooking the onions.  Really expected it to be absorbed (usually is).  Perhaps it's because I usually use vegetable oil.    But it's a great recipe, as I said, one u can make ur own.

This was awesome! I didn’t cook my meat as long before putting it in the slow cooker, and it still turned out delicious. I didn’t have paprika like I thought I did and used some red pepper flakes once everything was in my slow cooker for a kick and it is perfect.

This beef stew was so delicious!!!  My entire family loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly except for when I didn't have the ingredient.  So, instead of seasoned salt, I used regular salt; I didn't use marsala or paprika.  And for the beef broth, I opted for low sodium.  I didn't use mushrooms because I don't like them so I added and extra carrot and celery stalk.  But with these modifications/omissions, it still tasted amazing!    I will be making this again for sure!

I made this recipe in my new Ninja 4-in-one cooking system.  I followed the recipe exactly and had one of the best beef stews I have ever tasted in just 4 hours.  My husband remarked "you can make this again any time, it's really good."  Heated up some of the leftovers for dinner tonight and both of us felt it was even better the second night.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you, BusySpoons, for this great recipe.

I increased the 1 Tbsp of Worcestershire Sauce to 3 and didn’t use onion soup mix (didn’t have on hand) but otherwise made as written. When done I increased the salt and pepper to our taste. Very good on an early fall night.

This was simple and straightforward, but really nothing special. Would definitely use less broth next time

I will definitely make this again.  I didn’t flour the meat or add Worcester.  I also made it gluten free.  It is absolutely delicious.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Pretty good.   I would welcome any seasoning suggestions besides sale and pepper to taste.  Maybe that paprika that I couldn't find gives it more punch.  I also didn't use as many mushrooms as the recipe called for.

I thought this was a very tasty recipe for beef stew.  I did make a few edits based on my knowledge of the ingredients and that I was cooking this on the stove in my dutch oven rather than a crock pot.  I increased the beef broth a little to 32 oz.  I also cut back on the beef... Used maybe 1.25 lbs.  I also increased the celery and potato just a little.  Very good overall, but I'm not sure that I'll replace my other beef stew recipe for this one.  My preference if I make it again would be to cut back on the paprika a little.

The best stew we've ever tasted.  Hands down.  It's out of this world excellent.  Didn't have any wine, so that was omitted but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

I’m not actually a beef stew lover but my wife is so I decided to have it ready when she came home from work. As soon as she walked in the house she talked about how great the smell was. We both felt this is the best beef stew we have ever made! I didn’t change the recipe other than omitting the mushrooms. This is now on my favorites list!

So good and easy! I added peas and corn the last hour, 4 red potatoes and a little garlic powder instead of garlic cloves, not a fan. Didn’t have the wine, thickened it with the cornstarch, it was delicious!

This soup is a delicious comfort food. I left out the mushrooms and wine, and I was happy with the results. Instead of the wine, I used vegetable broth. The tomatoes add great flavor. The stew meat and broth were really good. I have made other vegetable beef soups and they weren't as good as this one.

This was delicious! Everyone devoured and leftovers went quickly. Only slight modifications- I listened to other reviewers and cut the beef broth in half which turned out perfectly. Instead of Marsala, I used the red blend I had on hand and omitted the mushrooms. I used baby brown potatoes, halved with skin on and to save time on prep, I browned the meat the night before and then cooked on low for 12 hours the following day.  Smelled delicious when returning home from work! Will definitely make again.

This was an excellent stew recipe.  I made it exactly as written and it was perfect!  Take the time to find smoked, sweet Spanish paprika.  It adds a slightly sweet, smoky flavor which pairs nicely with the Marsala.  It was a nice change from the old basic meat, potatoes and carrots type of stew.  I will definitely make this again!

This was delicious!  The combination of marsala wine, smoked paprika, and crushed tomatoes makes for a wonderful flavor. I bought pre-cut stew meat from the grocery store for convenience and it was a little over 2 lbs, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It did need to cook the full 12 hours for the meat to be tender enough and I did not need to thicken it at all and I used a full 32 oz. container of broth. Will definitely make this again this winter!

I made it , following the directions & we both enjoyed it.  I finally bought a slow-cooker & this was my first time using it! I cooked it 5 hours on high.  Tomorrow I will heat up the leftovers. I'm hoping they will be just as good as the original batch or better!

First time I made it I found there was insufficient vegetables for the amount of beef and gravy. Second time I doubled the potatoes & carrots and used 3 sticks of celery. I also added to the vegetables 2 yellow onions - quartered. This is a great stew.

Very easy to make. I didn't have the wine so I skipped that step. I also made a gravy out of the broth only because we prefer thicker stew. I will definitely make again.

This one' s a hit at our house. I've made it twice now, and it's staying on the menu. I subbed in ~9 small red potatoes cut into 1/8ths (we like the skin). Had to skip the Marsala (didn't have any), and just added a little extra worcestershire, onion powder, and garlic, and it came out fine. (Cooked 4hrs, then warmed overnight.) Really happy.

I followed the recipe, except that much more liquid built up in the crock pot than I expected, so there was not enough space to include it.  I made a larger amount than the original recipe quantity. It was so flavorful that we all overate.

I made this exactly as directed, with one minor change. The recipe did not specify what type of potatoes to use, so I used regular baking potatoes. They were kinda big, so i only used 2-1/2 instead of 3. In the 23+ years that I have been married, this is the first time that I can remember my wife getting a second helping of anything that I have made. She even noted that she wasn't even that hungry when we sat down to eat but she still had two bowls.

This soup is so easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, and it was so nice to start it in the morning, go away for the day, and then come back to wonderful smells and a delicious dinner in the evening.  The one big change I made, which I loved and will keep the next time I make it is that I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies in place of the crushed tomatoes it calls for.  This gave it a nice little kick!

Excellent stew recipe.   I used about 1 cup of a cabernet sauvignon instead of marsala because I had some to use,  adding it towards the end when crock pot was simmering.   I used a London broil cut, which was on a good sale.   Other than that, I followed recipe exactly.  So flavorful, we loved it.

This was a lot more detailed in the beginning as my stew meat was frozen and trying to brown that took awhile. However, this was the BEST beef stew my family and I have EVER eaten! 5 stars across the board. If you're making this before you head to work, it is worth it to brown the meat the night before to save that time in the morning.

Very easy and delicious! I doubled the recipe and used an Instant Pot. Here are my changes:
I set the Instant Pot for Stew  for 10 hours
With 4 lbs of beef and all the veggies I could only fit in 4 cans of broth instead of the suggested 6. I was originally worried about this and thought it would reduce too much but with the Instant Pot it ended up being almost too much liquid! If you do make it on a stove or a traditional Crock Pot that might not be the case. I couldn't even fit the tomatoes in with everything but I wasn't happy about putting them in anyways and it doesn't need them! It would have made the stew too sour and acidic in my opinion. Also, I used Cabernet instead of Marsala and it was perfect. Marsala is too sweet to me. The only other thing I did differently is added parsley at the end. I will definitely be making this again, it was a huge hit!

It was really good! No need for the cornstarch because I added about 1/2 the beef broth.  I didn't particularly care for the tomatoes, it made it too sweet for my taste, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.  My sons absolutely devoured it!

I used venison instead of beef, and also added a zucchini that I had on hand.  I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed.  I also used chicken broth because that is what I had. Next time, I would use less broth, and might add some barley.  Tastes GREAT!

Easy and very tasty. I usually avoid recipes that have "dry onion soup mix" in the list of ingredients, but I had a pack, and thought I'd get rid of it. Wow was this tasty! I might have changed my mind, just a little bit, about onion soup mix!

Hubby and I really enjoyed this, I did not divert from the recipe except that I eliminated the potato and subbed in 2 small parsnips and 1 small rutabaga. I'm diabetic and try to make some better carb choices when I can. A definite make it again recipe!

I've made this a few times. I've added and subtracted things as needed depending on what I've had on hand. Sometimes I've added corn or didn't have enough room for tomatoes. I've used corn starch instead of flour. I've actually used this recipe with deer and it turned out great. The low and slow of the crockpot plus the flavor really took away the gamey taste. It was so tender and delicious.

Great way to use the tougher cuts of venison in place of beef. The meat turns out both flavorful and tender.  This recipe is really good just as it is.  I diced up a half of a rutabaga and added it to the pot just because my venison stews always have had rutabagas. Also included a full cup of frozen wild mushrooms the last two times I made this stew which I believe is a nice enhancement.

We love this stew. Once I made a double batch of it for a group of friends and they all loved it. I made it with elk that particular time, but have used beef with the same great results. One of the guys even called me a couple weeks later to get the recipe. I leave out the wine and wait a bit before I add the onions and mushrooms to the browning meat, but other than that, I follow the recipe just as given.

My husband & grown kids & grandkids LOVED IT!! To throw it over the top I added half a cube of butter or if you prefer, a small dollop of butter (not margarine) in your personal bowl of stew. I also eliminated the can of tomatoes.

I loved this recipe.  It was easy to make.  The only change I made is that I added some gravy master to it to thicken up the gravy.  One could also add the stew seasoning to add evne more flavor.  Other than that i would change a thing!

This turned out wonderful! I put all the sauce ingredients and onion in with the beef in one ziplock, and the carrots and potatoes (I didn't have mushrooms or celery) in another and froze them. The night before I was planning to cook it I left it in the fridge. Put it in the slow cooker for a good 12 hours and it was amazing.

I made this today, I stuck 100% to the recipe for the first time making it. However, I didn't thicken it with the optional corn starch. The liquids released from the onion and mushroom is needed to help brown the meat, so maybe half or even thirds at a time is helpful.  Overall, I liked it, but its quite bland if following the recipe to a T. My wife didn't really care for it.

This was great.  I made minor changes just because of preferences and what was in the pantry.  No mushrooms, diced tomatoes and I added a sweet potato simply because I like them.  Didn't need to add the cornstarch, broth had a nice consistency.  Big hit with the family, will definitely make again.

I make this stew as written, except I used Merlot instead of Marsala wine. I made this twice and it comes out great . It's a nice winter evening supper. Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of my favorite tasting stews.  With actual cold weather in Houston it is a great day to make it again.  Even my sister asked for the recipe.  Defiantly a keeper.

Really bland, and a very thin gravy, even with cornstarch. I would recommend a LOT more seasoning, and more than 4 hours cooking for sure.

I used 2.5 lb. chuck roast and added 1 lb. browned ground  beef.  Did not use tomatoes, substituted tomato paste. Added 1 can french onion soup and a cup of frozen peas.  Subbed dry red wine for marsala. Turned out very nice, served with french bread and mashed potatoes.

I made this exactly as written.  Preparation was quite time consuming...there are a lot of ingredients!  It was rather bland, even with all the seasonings, and there was way too much liquid.  Slow cooker recipes do not need this much liquid as it doesn't evaporate as it cooks.  This was okay but too much work for the effort.  I think I'll go back to my tried and true stew recipe.

Awesome! Best beef stew I have made! Did not have marsala wine but used sweet red wine. First time using smoked papricka - great flavor. Other stews made were "flat." Not this one. Will make this one again!

This recipe was very flavorful to us.  My only variation that I will make the next time I fix it, which I most surely will, would be to thicken it more before serving.  I did use corn starch at the end but it was not nearly thick enough.  I highly recommend this recipe otherwise.

This stew is awesome. My hubby loved it!  I admit I made 2 changes; didn't have the smokey paprika so I used regular and, since neither of us care for cooked celery, I left it out. However it was delicious. One note, it makes a lot of stew!  We both had a bowl and half and just made a small "dent" in the amount left in the crockpot. We froze what was left and look forward to this again on a cold winter type day. 

Oh - I did thicken it with cornstarch as there was a lot of liquid (thin). I used a mixture of both the stew broth and water and a couple of heaping teaspoons of cornstarch blended together. I then stirred it into the hot stew, mixed it well, and then turned the crockpot off 30 minutes before it was "done" so that it was cool enough to enjoy. 

Don't forget to make a skillet of cornbread to go along with this!

Love the taste and how thick the gravy is in this. I might make it with baby onions instead next time and add some peas, and maybe a tad more garlic.

I usually don't make any recipe the way it is written, I always change something.  But I liked the recipe when I read it so I thought I would give it a try.  Followed it word for word. The only thing I didn't have was the Marsala wine so I used Oliver Soft Red. It was done in 8 hours on low. REALLY REALLY GOOD!!! A definite KEEPER!!!!!

The best yet. Stews in slow cooker tend all be a little bland, not this one. It was very tasty. I added Bragg  instead of salt. Definitely a favourite .

Really good.  Only changes I made was some extra potatoes and added two cans of Veg-Al and omitted the carrots and celery since there was a lot of those in the Veg-Al.  Will be making this again.

My favorite stew recipe.  Only thing different is I use a red wine instead of Marsala, one that I'll serve with the stew.  I think the smoked paprika is the secret to this recipe.

This was good!  I added a additional carrot and celery.  Also added a couple of more potatoes.  I did use the cornstarch to thicken the gravy.  Did not have Marsala wine - used dry white wine about 1/2 cup.  Used the wine to deglaze the pan and then added all that yumminess into the slow cooker.  Took 6 hours in my slow cooker.  Will make again - next time may use burgundy wine and add in some frozen peas.

My husband makes homemade beef stew all the time. I came across this recipe and we tried it and I'm so glad we did. It is the best we've ever had. My mother is very critical when it comes to food, but she absolutely loved this stew!  My husband made it on the stove top, can't wait to try it in my slow cooker.

This was my first attempt at a making a meal from a crockpot and it was a success! Good flavor. I added extra mushrooms and used baby carrots. Gravy thickened after a little bit of sitting, next time I may make a rue to thicken it up.

Loved this recipe. Followed it exactly and added cubed sweet potatoes as well as white.  Took longer in my slow cooker. Added some gravy master to enhance the gravy at the end.  My family really enjoyed it.

Made this recipe last week.  It is soooooooo good!  Definitely a five star, if not more.  My husband and I have had several meals from this batch and it  just seems to get better and better.  Served it with cornbread and a good glass of red wine.  Will definitely put this in the winter rotation of meals.  Thanks for sharing this.

Loved this recipe, hubby gave it 4 1/2 stars .. Changes I made 

1. I didn't flour the meat before browning, but did season it 

2. I left out the potatoes .. otherwise I followed the recipe as written .. this recipe is a keeper

I don't really care for the traditional "gravy-type" stew....and this was a great alternative.  I think the smoked paprika and crushed tomatoes gives it a great flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

I followed the directions exactly and I didn't like the wine in it and next time I think I would add an knorr beef boullion.  Also, less broth as it was too soupy even after putting cornstarch in.   I am definetly going to give it another go as it was not bad.

Loved this recipe! I omitted mushrooms as they are something we so not like and the celery as the hub does not like celery cooked. I cooked it in my slow cooker for 5 hours and the meat was so delicious and tender and the veg flavorful. I did have to add cornstarch as the broth was thin; I will cut this down by a third next time. Myself and the hub had seconds! Definitely a new staple in our household!

My husband and I love this stew.  Made it for the second time today and love that it is one of those recipes that you can adjust to your liking as far as the veggies etc. are concerned.  As long and you keep the basic broth recipe true to the original recipe you are good.  Thanks Busyspoons.

This is delicious.  I used regular paprika but added a little liquid smoke to get the flavor.  I also used smokehouse pepper instead of regular black pepper.  I did thicken some of the liquid with cornstarch on the stovetop and then added it back to the crockpot.  We all loved it!

Gooood...  I didn't use the broth or onion soup mix.  And the time seemed excessive, so I just cooked it on the stove in my cast iron for 2+ hours and it was great!

I didn't have everything on hand that the recipe calls for, but I thought it turned out great! I didn't have mushrooms, paprika, organic beef broth, or dry onion soup mix. I substituted a bay leaf, 2 teaspoons beef bouillon in two cups water, and diced onion. This stew had more flavor than any I have made in the past. Some reviews stated the broth was too thin, but I simply added 2 tablespoons cornstarch at the end in a small amount of water, and it instantly became a wonderful thick stew broth. Excellent and very flavorful!

Oh my goodness, what a fantastic stew.  I do not cook, I have great intentions however I am up early and in late daily.  This incredible meal was more than I could hope for.  I changed nothing with the exception of adding the paprika and flour an hour before it was done simmering.  I paired it with a salad with fresh garden veggies and an onion roll.  My boyfriend thought he'd come home to the wrong house :)

Best beef stew I ever had. Never thought to put tomatoes in with the other ingredients when making stew. Used regular paprika and added more potatoes but all the flavors were wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe!

mixed thoughts. I was very excited to have a bowl and discovered that i didn't think it was that great. Kinda bland. I ended up adding butter, hot sauce and salt to my little bowl. We ate it for dinner the next night. It tasted great on the second day, totally different stew. I didn't add anything to it the next day because it tasted great. 

My husband thinks this is a 3 star. I think 4. might not be making again though. 

disclaimer, I had no smoked paprika so I used regular.. i wonder if that makes the difference??

I really love this stew, But I made a few changes, I added about 10 ounces of beef gravy in place of stock, added a bay leaf and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper, and some mini corn and used regular paparika
