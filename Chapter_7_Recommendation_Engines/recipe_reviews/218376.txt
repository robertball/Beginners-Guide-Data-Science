I made this recipe for a salty/sweet party we had at work. It was a really simple recipe and so easy and quick to make! I ended up melting the butter and marshmallow fluff in the microwave in a big pyrex bowl, then stirred in the crunched up fritos. I put that all in an 8x8 pan and pressed down with parchment paper. I left them loosely covered with foil overnight and everybody loved them the next day at work! I'll definitely be making these again.

Was really good!  I went the old fashioned way and used regular marshmallows instead of marshmallow cr√®me.  Went together just as easily as Rice Krispie treats.  I could easily eat an entire pan of these, but man-o-man the calorie count has to be enormous on these!  Sure would be a fun way to eat an entire bag of Fritos though :)
