Excellent recipe; I followed other's suggestions and did the following:
saute fresh mushrooms and onions in butter before browning meat, reduced milk to 1 1/2cp. milk, added 1 1/2 beef broth, and added a cn of cream of mushroom soup as the last step.  This will definitely be on our table again!

When I first made this dish, my husband and I both found it to be much to salty. Next time, I omitted the canned mushrooms in their own juices and instead used fresh mushrooms.  This eliminated the salty flavor. The patties were very flavorful, but I added some crumbled bacon bits and a little crushed garlic.  I also prefer a gravy made with cornstarch over flour and found that to work great also.

We LOVE this recipe -- easy, cheap, and yummy!  My only change is to saute sliced onions with the mushrooms.  This one is firmly entrenched in our rotation!

SUPER GREAT! This was the first time I ever made salisbury steak. I did change the recipe a little, we like onion so added more, used only 1/2 the milk and salt, and as others have done I used a can of beef broth and a can of cream of mushroom soup, fresh mushrooms that I sauted in the butter to use for the gravy, and a tsp of worsh. sauce. This made the gravy nice and thick. YUMMY!!!

I added worcestershire sauce to both the patties and the gravy, I also used 2 cups of beef broth and 1 cup of milk. I also placed the patties in a casserole and smothered them in gravy, I then covered with foil and baked for about 30 minutes. The gravy needed additional thickening as I felt it was too runny for my family's taste so I added a bit of slurry before pouring the gravy over.

It was good and with the minor adjustments I made it will remain in the line up, thanx for a good recipe the whole family likes!

Delicious!  I did make a change though, not because I saw anything wrong with the recipe but because I am lazy!  Instead of making a sauce with the butter, flour, milk, and mushrooms...I just used a can of cream of mushroom soup and milk.  I added some flour to make it thicker.  Still turned out yummy!  And it had a good gravy consistency.

This was really good....everybody loved it INCLUDING my 3 picky children!  I did, however, have to omit the mushrooms, but still delicious.  I also left out the poultry seasoning, used seasoning salt, garlic pepper, and onion powder and the "steaks" were super flavorful.  We liked the gravy over mashed potatoes.  Thanks for a great recipe :)

Who would think that salisbury steak could be so good?  Whenever I think of salisbury steak, I have visions of TV dinners.  Fix this with mashed potatoes and biscuits and you have a meal fit for a king.  Like me, you will swear off TV dinners forever.  I served the very easy to prepare, "Red Hot Biscuits" from the allrecipes website.  With the mashed potatoes, I just can't tell you how good it tasted.  Even though I only had two cups of milk and had to substitute chicken broth for the rest of the milk, the consistency and flavor of the gravy was primo.  This was an absolutely awesome and amazing meal.

I made the patties according to the recipe, but for the gravy I sauteed fresh button/crimini mushrooms in butter and set aside.  I then added more butter/flour and added a can of beef broth and an equal part of milk.  I also added worcestershire sauce and dijon mustard before adding the reserved mushrooms and the pre-browned patties back in.  Yummy!

Yep, I made this again and it was just as good as the first time.  I did omit the beef boullion cube, used fresh mushrooms and cut back about 1/2 cup milk, but, it was delicious in the end.  I don't think I altered the recipe enough to not follow the directions as they were.  This time, I did make it with mashed potatoes.  Again, we had enough for left overs.  Next time, I don't think I will put poultry seasoning in my meat mixture, I think I will change it to a steak seasoning or maybe include some steak sauce.

Great recipe!  The gravy turned out nice and thick; I made the recipe as is but cooked a bit longer then the 10 minutes in the end.

I wasn't sure I should bother adding my review since there are so many here already but why not?  My family LOVED this recipe; however, I made a couple of changes because I was missing ingredients.  I usually follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it and change it to suit us if needed.  Instead of buttery round crackers, I used vegetable flavoured ones.  Because I didn't have any beef bouillon cubes, I didn't put in the juice from the canned mushrooms.  Instead, I put in a can of onion soup.  I thought that three cups of milk sounded excessive so I only added one.  The gravy was just right as far as I was concerned so I'm glad I didn't put in all the milk.  I think the onion soup helped the flavour so I'm writing that change on my recipe and keeping it.

I made this recipe completely as directed... the taste was EXCELLENT... my son kept saying that it tasted like sausage... maybe that was the herbs in the poultry seasoning?  I used 96% lean beef... and the patties were rather firm, I guess ...Nevertheless, non-red-meat-eating-boy glommed it down.  The main issue that I  had was that the sauce didn't thicken....I don't know if might have been the extra liquid from the canned mushrooms or too much milk... but it just seemed very liquidy.  I wound up having to add about a TBSP more flour to the mixture.... and in the end, it was thicker, but the milk had curdled a bit by the time that happened...& didn't look as pretty as I thought it would...but it was noticeable to me & no one else! :)  All told, this was an excellent comforty kind of meal... served with yukon gold mashed potatoes & left over corn...great for this cold evening... I will definitely make this again...but do a little experimenting with the gravy!  Thanks for sharing!!

This was good but not great in my opinion.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I needed to add some more cracker crumbs to the meat.  I felt it was a little bland, but my biggest problem was that the sauce got to thick and lumpy after sitting.  Needed more liquid.  Still, we enjoyed it.  Not sure if I would make again.

I added fresh parsley, garlic salt, breadcrumbs instead and garlic to the meat... I sauteed fresh baby bella mushrooms with onion, garlic and white wine and instead of using bouillon cubes I used 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1 1/2 cups of beef broth! Served it over buttered basmati rice... NOM!

I used 93% fat free ground beef, fresh mushrooms instead of canned and used only 2 cups of milk and 1 cup beef broth. Instead of butter and flour I used about 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce and 2 1/2 tablespoons corn starch to thicken the gravy. Tried to make on of those comfort food dishes a smidge healthier... Yum!

Delicious!  I thought I had fresh mushrooms, but had used them in something else.  Didn't miss them, this was really good.  Hubby says to put it in the rotation!

I too made changes to suit me.  Nothing against the author, just preferred not to use milk.  Instead, used beef bouillon & burgundy, added a little flour to make a gravy.  Prior to that, sauteed onions & mushrooms in butter.  I mixed minced garlic, diced onions, oregano, eggs, worcestershire, italian bread crumbs & "house seasoning." I fed (8) hungry men & they loved it!

We love this recipe!  I would suggest that you do NOT drain the pan drippings after cooking the patties.  That adds to the flavor of the gravy.  It's also helpful to whisk the flour into the milk/beef stock prior to pouring it in the pan.  That makes it cook more smoothly.  We do also add some garlic occasionally, but we generally stick to the recipe. 

Also, I just made the BEST patty melts as leftovers from this recipe.  Just sauté some extra sliced or chopped onion in butter and/or bacon drippings.  Remove the onions from the skillet, but leave the drippings.  Brown slices of rye bread in that skillet, using the pan drippings to lightly coat the outer sides of the bread.  You can melt some sharp cheddar on the bread slices as you're browning them, if you like extra cheese.  Reheat one of these salisbury "steaks" with some of its mushroom gravy, melting some sharp cheddar on top as you heat the patty/gravy.  (I just did this in the microwave.)  Spread some salad dressing (Miracle Whip or similar) on one or both slices of the browned rye bread, along with some spicy mustard.  Add some of the sautéed onions and the "steak" with its gravy to one piece of prepared rye and top with the other slice of bread.  This makes a SUPER flavorful, juicy patty melt!  We won't talk about calories...

The texture of the meat was not great! I was disappointed in this recipe. The gravy didn't have much flavor and my son and husband did not like it either. Won't be trying this one again. Disappointed.

This is a yummy dish with lots of gravy.  I used Ritz crackers and low fat milk, and light margarine.  I also used a bit more onion and a dash or two of "wooster" sauce.  My husband and son each ate two patties, so saying it feeds 6 is stretching it. I'd say it easily feeds three adults.  Mashed potatoes are a must with it because of the generous amount of gravy.  I think next time I will make larger, thin patties to take advantage of the delicious gravy.

I followed the recipe as written but had to make one small change. I wanted the gravy to be thicker so I added one extra tbsp of flour. This is really good and a different with the milk gravy. Will go into my keeper file.

I alter the recipe a bit by adding worchestershire sauce and my own cajun spice recipe and lots of garlic powder, no egg and no butter, use extra virgin olive oil to brown and large slices of onion after beef is browned. For the side dish, I coarsed cut up potatoes and carrots, boil, add beef bouillon till tender, drain, add stick of melted butter and more homemade cajun seasoning, stir and ready, delicious comfort food.

Everyone liked this better than the other Salisburys I've made.  The gravy needs more but I'll figure that out on my own.  As is, it is good, not great.

This is good for what it is. I'm trying to get over my snobbery of ground beef dishes; however just don't enjoy meatloafy-style foods. DH liked it, reminds us of our childhoods. Kids ate it but don't love it.

Very good.  did follow some of the others changes.  Fresh Mushrooms and sweet onion simmered in the butter.  Used 1/2 beef stock 1/2 milk.  Tons of extra gravy.  Though I tippled the batch.   Will make again.

This is an amazing recipe. I modified it a bit to suit our Indian palates. To the patties I added 2 cloves of minced garlic. Did not have any poultry seasoning, so used mixed Italian seasoning. After it was fried, I drained most of the oil, sauted 2 cloves of minced garlic and half a minced onion and then added mushrooms. When the mushrooms were done I added 2 cups of milk, half a cup of water mixed with chicken cube (did not have beef) which I thickened using cornflour. Then I cooked the patties in the sauce for about half an hour as we like our meat well done.   Turned out yummy. Will def make again. Only change I would make is probably to try and get beef cubes

Very nice.  I started with a little olive oil in the skillet, and fried the patties along with some onions, which I allowed to caramelize.  After removing the patties, I tossed the mushrooms in with the onions and let them cook down after I removed the patties from the pan.  The caramelized onions gave the gravy some extra flavor. I also added a little garlic powder to the hamburger mixture. I'll use this often. Thanks for the post.

This is fantastic. I changed the poultry seasoning to 1/2 tea. I browned the burgers and set aside, then the mushrooms and set aside.  Used 2 tbls. flour, 1 cup skim milk, 1 cup beef broth and 1 pkg. mushroom gravy mix prepared with 1 cup of water. I then put the burgers into my slow cooker and added the gravy and let it cook for a few hours on low. Served with mashed potatoes, carrots and creamy cucumbers.

9.10.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/90497/scrumptious-salisbury-steak-in-mushroom-gravy/ ... This was good - & I almost followed the recipe!  ;D  I only had one can mushrooms.  I drained them & added after the gravy was thickened.  I thickened with 6T flour & it could've used more maybe.  I subbed beef broth (no cubes) for the milk.  A good winter dinner, I guess.  'Not wow-ed, but good.  A little wine in the gravy would be yummy.

Pretty good base recipe. Browned patties, then made gravy and baked 1/2 hour @ 350. Patties need more seasoning. Add a lil Worschestire to the gravy and use fresh mushrooms.

Less liquid and used beef soup base rather than the bullion. (I do not use poultry seasoning either but after making numerous times, salt pepper, garlic, a pinch of oregano, sage or basil depending on how I feel.)Sauteed mushrooms then made a roux to add the liquid to.
Last time I used 1/2 beef and half fresh sausage (we just butchered a pig) to stretch the beef. Maybe a little sausage would have been okay but 1/2 and 1/2 was way too much. :/

I followed most of the changes that CMB146 mentioned in her review.  I didn't add the cream of mushroom soup and it was perfect.  My picky husband really enjoyed this too.  1 pound of hamburger sure goes a long way with this recipe, with enough leftovers for another meal.  Thanks for this recipe and all the great reviews.

Yummy! I was only cooking for two people so I ended up cutting the broth and milk in half and I also used bread crumbs. I did sliced sweet onions with the fresh mushrooms. I also added a dash of worchestershire sauce to the meat and to the gravy.

Good recipe.  I left out mushrooms due to family member with allergy to them, but added sliced onions instead.  Husband usually doesn't eat anything with gravy, but ate this gladly.

This was so delicious i added it to my recipe collection.  I used ground turkey, panko bread cruumbs, and chicken base paste instead of beef and cracker crumbs.  Try it this way, it is so...good!

Used Italian bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs.  Added quite a bit more onion, minced garlic, mrs. dash, seasoning salt, poultry seasoning to meat.  Browned meat in skillet and removed.  Sauteed fresh crimini mushrooms, and onions.  Deglazed pan with beef stock and white wine.  Added flour with cooled broth to thicken gravy.  Only used maybe a cup of the milk, but the full amount of broth.  Omitted the butter, as I am watching calories and fat.  Used some Kitchen Bouquet for color.  Placed over browned patties, covered and baked at 350 for 45 minutes (made 1/2 cup patties that were thicker).  Made mashed potatoes to go along with the gravy.  We enjoyed this very much.  Made green scallion biscuits to go along with the meal.

AWESOME! YUM! 5 STAR X 10    I have made this a few times now and we all love it. On my kid scale it fell short and they didn't want/like it.  EDIT - I added more onions and fresh mushrooms, now kids like it.

I usually make meat patties like that but never tried poultry season in ground beef and sometimes use cream of mushroom soup but this recipe is by far a more flavorful tasty gravy.  Served it with mashed potatoes.  I had fresh mushrooms that needed to be used so that was the only thing I changed plus added 1 can of the mushrooms to go with the fresh.  This is a quick easy meal and will make it again.

I can't even say how GOOD this was!  Tender, juicy, flavorful!  I will definitely make again.  I didn't make exactly as written.  I substituted fresh mushrooms for the canned and used a mixture of 2 cups beef stock that you can buy in the boxes with one cup of milk and 1tsp of beef buillion granules. I also doubled the meat as well as the onions and spices in the recipe to make more steaks and left the gravy the same! (just a note: you would also need to double the gravy if you are feeding more than 4 adults) This makes you think of Sunday dinners at Grandma's house!

Just what I was wanting.  I did more crackers than called for to make the meat stay together better, and ommitted the poultry seasoning b/c I didn't have any.  I also used just one can of mushrooms and pureed them to get the flavor w/o the texture (I'm not a big mushroom fan).  I also cut the milk some.  It was great and made lots of gravy.  We were all impressed with how tender they were.

My family and I did not like the Salisbury steak.  Something about the flavor of the steak itself was no appetizing.  However, I changed up the mushroom gravy recipe and it was fabulous! I used the cans of mushrooms and puréed them. I melted the butter and mixed the flour in the pan.  Then, I added the mushroom purée mix and substituted beef broth in place of the milk.  This makes great beefy mushroom gravy!  For those who like chunks of mushrooms, add chunks of mushrooms to your gravy but still purée some mushrooms for a more aromatic flavor!

This was a really good recipe. I added garlic to both the meat and the gravy since we are garlic lovers. Also added splashes of worc. sauce and red wine to the gravy. It just seemed like the meat was missing something...an herb or something. Maybe next time I will add rubbed sage, or thyme, or parsley. Or all three. Great recipe tho. Will definitely be making this again. Served it with homemade mashed red potatoes.

The whole family loved this. I was afraid the gravy wouldnt have enough flavor so i subsituted 2 cups of milk with beef broth. I also added worchestesire, dried mustard, and a little beef broth the the meat mixture. This came out with an exellect flavor and plenty of gravy for the mashed potatoes. Both my boys at the steak gone, and my husband said "wow"! Thanks, we will have this often.

I love this dish and make it often. I follow the recipe but add a few potatoes that have been microwaved a few minutes, slice them then let them finish cooking in the gravy after the patties are added back to  the pan.

Great recipe, my family of 8 loved this! I did take the other reviewers suggestions and used fresh mushrooms, 1 cup milk, with a can of beef broth instead of beef bouillon.

I doubled the recipe, glad I did, it was delicious!  use high quality ground beef, fresh mushrooms instead of canned, pay attention to the 1" thickness recommended for the patties -- we loved it!

I made this and even my picky 6 year old loves it!  I did cheat a bit with the gravy....I used cream of mushroom soup mixed with beef bouillion.  I didn't thin the soup with milk or anything, I just adjusted the amout based on how many patties I had.  I also used ground beef mixed with dry onion soup mix and made patties from that.  This is definately in our meal rotation!

Scrumptious! I made this recipe as written except I used fresh mushrooms and added a small chopped onion, and sauted them together. Also when I added the 3 cups of milk, I added one at a time stirring well in between. I cannot believe how good this turned out. I would never substitute canned mushroom soup or canned broth, because there's no reason to. It's perfect as is and the homemade taste is worth the extra little effort.

Good base recipe, but for my husband's taste, I knew I'd have to add to it.  I used ground VENISON, and it worked just fine.  To the patties, I added 1/4t celery salt, and 1t garlic, along with a little extra minced onion, and increased the poultry seasoning to 1/2t.  In the gravy, I used fresh mushrooms and a small thinly sliced onion, which I cooked in the meat drippings with a bit of butter. I also added a dash of sage, probably 3/4 or 1t dry mustard powder, 1/2t garlic powder, and 1t worchestershire sauce.  I also had to add cornstarch on top of the flour, as it simply would not thicken to desired consistency.  I got rave reviews with these additions.

I gave this 5 stars, but as an altered recipe as others did. I made the steaks same as the recipe. On the sauce, I sauted fresh mushrooms and onions. Then I added 1 1/2 cup milk and 1 1/2 cup beef broth, and a can of cream of mushroom soup and a little Worcestershire sauce. Excellent with the changes. I don't like boullion, which is the main reason for the change.

made it according to reviewers suggestions - mix the flour with either the milk or beef broth or you will have lumps!! Otherwise, great flavor - be sure to add the worshestershire at the end!

Very good.  I subbed fresh mushrooms for canned.  I forgot to add poultry seasoning to the meat, so I tossed it in the sauce instead.  It turned out great, and no need to change anything.

I thought this was excellent.  I first wasn't sure about the recipe when i saw it was made with the milk, boullion  and flour but figured i would give it a try...it was delicious...easy to make and what i call a "comfort" food.  I didn't have the cracker crumbs so i used bread crumbs instead and it came out fine.  Plenty of gravy to put over rice or potatos as a side dish.

Oh my, these were great!  I followed some of the "Most Helpful" reviews.  I actually prefer the sauce without the cream of mushroom soup in it otherwise you loose some of the beef flavor a Salisbury steak should have.  Just a helpful tip, make sure you really mix your seasons into the ground beef well because as I was taking bites I got more poultry season in parts than others.

Great recipe.  Might tweak it a bit for our own tastes later.  I followed some other reviewers advice and went with real mushrooms.  Overall a great recipe for my first attempt at Salisbury steak!

This was pretty good, I liked the idea of the milky gravy but think I prefer a beefier gravy.  I will probably stick with my old recipe.  I am glad I tried it though!

I like to review the things I try on this site. This was a very good recipe. Had some people over and they loved it. I had this in mind when I went to the store and they had this deal on round steak. I bought that and used that instead of ground beef. It was great!!! Used worchestershire while frying up and let it simmer alot longer then 10 minutes. Served over buttered noodle. only 2 cups of skim milk and 3 lbs of meat. It was great thank-you

very good, more like country fried steak taste. i didnt exactly measure anything i used one small onion, diced, a handful of ritz crackers which i crushed by hand. i dont like mushrooms so i eliminated them completely. made the gravy out of the minimal pan drippings butter flour and milk, bullion etc just like the recipe states. i also added a little extra salt and pepper. at first i thought the gravy was tasteless, but after the steaks went back in to cook in the gravy for 10 minutes it was wonderful. my family couldnt get over how good it was.

Great meal with egg noodles & steamed asparagus. I did tweak it a little. After the meat was cooked initially I sauteed fresh mushrooms and onions in butter and a little of the oil/grease leftover from the meat. And I used 2 cups of beef broth and 2 cups of milk instead of 4 cups of milk. It turned out great and the family loved it.

My family loved this!  I didn't really change anything except I didn't have beef bouillon cubes I only had chicken I used them.  I increased the recipe to make a serving for 8 instead of 6.  I did need to use a little more flour to thicken the gravy it was too thin at first.  Oh, and I didn't use poultry seasoning, I used garlic and onion powder.  It  came out excellent, I've never made homemade salisbury steaks before..definitely a new family favorite and in our rotation of meals.  Served with mashed potatoes, green beans and biscuits.  My hubby used the leftovers to make breakfast for me and him... he used the steak, gravy and biscuits (gravy on the biscuit of course) and served with an over easy eggs...OMG.. Down Home & Tasty!

i wanted something different and easy and this fit the bill.This was a very tasty recipe. I didn't have bullion cubes, so I used beef broth instead, I used fresh mushrooms and I added heavy cream instead of milk, about a half of a cup. I served it to my husband who liked it very much. I will definitely serve it again.

I am giving this recipe a 5 solely for the idea, because I really didn't follow it exactly since I didn't have any milk on hand.  It turned out great even without the milk.  What I did was make the patties, but not with crackers - with bread crumbs instead.  I also used double the meat, added some steak spice, some fresh garlic, some onion powder, some oregano, some basil and more poultry seasoning.   Instead of the milk I used three cans of cream of mushroom soup, with a little bit of sour cream.  I also used 1.5 cans of beef broth. I sauteed several fresh mushrooms and also added a can of whole mushrooms with juice.  I served it all over roasted yams, potatoes, carrots and some broccoli.  It turned out really great!  The sauce was delicious, even without the milk!!  Thanks for the idea and maybe next time I will try it with milk, or maybe not... I'm a big fan of creamy mushroom sauces, and my way turned out perfect!

This was absolutely incredible. The steaks were very tender and moist and the gravy was really, really good. I was tempted to shortcut with cream of mushroom soup but I decided to go ahead and make the gravy from the recipe. I am so glad--if you're tempted to skip the gravy, DON'T. I did end up using only 2 cups of milk because it seemed plenty thick and I used fresh mushrooms and sweet onion that I sauteed seperately and then added to the gravy when I put the steaks back in to simmer. Very, very good--easily as good as, if not better than, the salisbury steak we get in southern restaurants. Note: the boullion adds a salty flavor so be sure to taste test before adding more salt to your plate. And this amount of gravy was only enough for the steaks so if you want more for mashed potatoes, double up.

This was very good.  I didn't have crackers so I used ground oatmeal.  I used half whole milk and half skim for a richer gravy.  I added some Kitchen Bouquet (aka browning sauce) which I felt gave the gravy a more appetizing color and also added to its flavor.  The next time made this I used fresh sauteed mushrooms which I felt was definitely better than the jarred/canned variety.  Even my 15-month old self-proclaimed vegetarian loved this!  We'll be making this over and over.

Added a little horseradish & worcestershire to the meat and it gave the "zip" it was missing!  Also used 1 1/2 cups whole milk & 1 1/2 cups beef broth in lieu of the bouillon cubes! Sauteed some chopped garlic with fresh mushrooms for the gravy. Serve with mashed potatoes and it makes a nice fall meal!

The "steak" part of this recipe is great. The gravy isn't. Instead I made and fired the patties. Then in a sauce pan I made brown gravy (2 packets from McCormick), just as the gravy started to boil I put it in a clean fry pan and add the patties. I cooked them on low simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes. EXCELLENT. With this change I would give this five stars. I also added one can of drained mushrooms to the gravy mixture for the last couple minutes of cooking.

I thougt this was just OK. I felt the gravy was too floury and thick. Im more of a thin beefy liker. Plus the "steak" tasted like more of a burger.

This was GREAT! My family and I were so pleased with how this turned out! I added Worcestershire to the meat mix and substituted one tbs of brown gravy mix for 1 tbs of flour.  I served this with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies and it was a huge hit- thanks for the great recipe!

I was plesantly surprised at how good this came out. I made the meat without any changes but I bought some gravy at the market eariler and wanted to use it up so I sauted the mushrooms then added the gravy and cooked with the meat. I did use a little more onions and mushrooms than were called for. I fixed this with mashed potatoes, carrots and biscuit bread. Both my wife and I thought it was a wonderful meal. It doesn't taste anything like the TV dinner.... this is a good, easy to fix meal and I highly recommend trying it.

This was most excellent. I only made very minimal changes: exchanged the crushed crackers for bread crumbs (because that's what I had on hand), left out the mushrooms cuz I don't like 'em, used 2 1/2 cups milk & 1/2 cup water, and added a small splash of worchestershire sauce. Scrumptious!

I love this recipe! It is in regular rotation in my house. I usually follow the recipe exactly but I have used diced onion and celery instead of just onion and it was still delicious. Very filling as well. My fiance loves it when I make this for him.

I was quite happy with how this turned out! My husband had seconds! I did make a few changes per 2 other reviewers' suggestions. I used fresh mushrooms, beef broth instead of bullion, added cream of mushroom soup. I also used 1/2 the milk and salt. I had to add much more flour to thicken the broth mixture. I may have used too much broth though. It took much longer than the 3-4 min. per side to brown the meat. However, the end result was a thick, creamy, awesome gravy! One more thing, though- 1 lb of beef for 6 servings??? I made the full recipe, and only had a little left over. I'm looking forward to reheating eat for another meal!
It was a 5- star worthy meal, but I deviated a lot from the original recipe.

This recipe is a regular on my make-ahead/freezer meal repertoire. Serve with rice, mashed potatoes, or rolls to help sop up the extra gravy. This is a great freezer meal/make ahead recipe.

Just made this tonight and hubby and both kids loved it.  I had to tweak it just a little, kids hate canned mushrooms, so I just sauteed onion in place of the mushrooms in the gravy.  I love how simple this recipe is.  I'm not a great chef..(just ask my family, LOL), but this is great because I can get creative with it.  I did add cornstarch to the gravy because I was in a hurry and it wasn't thickening up very fast. If you hate trying new recipes cause they take forever and nobody really likes it...try this one.  We loved it!!!!

Yummy!  This is so good.  My husband asked that I make this once a week.  I followed the other reviewers in sauteing the onion and mushrooms first.  I also addefd in the cream of mushroom at the end.  The rest of the recipe I followed the recipe as is and it was great!

It was good, but not great.  I had a difficult time getting the gravy to thicken up and I think I would have preferred fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  If I make this again, I will definitely make a few changes.

I personally did not care for the gravy. I scraped it off, in the middle of cooking, and used a roast beef gravy packet and it was good to go. The gravy in this recipe was too buttery and rich. The meat mixture was perfect.

Very good! I made a couple of changes on the fly...my meat mixture was too wet so I added an extra 2 T cracker crumbs (the meat I had was wet so I'm pretty sure that was the problem), extra T of flour to thicken the roux, and replaced the bullion cubes with Better than Bullion. Served with mashed potatoes it was very very good, and even my picky son ate it up. Thanks!

This was excellent, we both loved it. I used fresh mushrooms because I had a TON of them. The gravy was so delicious. It was a completely last minute dinner idea and was started and on the table in a half an hour. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. LOVE quick, easy, and delicious dinners. I will make this again, thank you!

I cannot believe I haven't rated this yet since I fell in love with it the first time I made it! We followed the recipe the 1st time, but this last weekend I tweaked by using a package of fresh sliced mushrooms and about 3 slices of sliced yellow onion and 1 small minced clove of garlic added to the gravy. As a kid I just loved Salisbury steak and I have never grown out of it. This is so easy and so yummy, and I think it will be a great way to use leftover hamburger after we have made hamburgers, just reduce the recipe for about 2 servings. 
I use low fat milk (1% or 2%)and 4% fat ground beef, reducing the guilt but not the flavor.
This is at the top of my "comfort foods" list!

While my family found the meat moist and tender, we all agreed this was lacking beefiness. As the gravy finished I found I had to increase the cooking time so it could thicken. Not that unusual as we live over a mile high, but in the end bolstered it with a cornstarch slurry and beef stock.  This probably won't be fixed at home again, but will make for hunny's family with some modifications.

I made this exactly as the recipe called, and found that flavor-wise, this dish was a 5.  However, this had to have been the most watery gravy I have ever seen in my life.  That is why I gave it a 3.  Next time I make this, I will definitely experiment with the gravy.  But as the author wrote it, I would have to say it was just substance to get me through to the next meal.  Nothing to write home to Mom about....

Good recipe, though I changed a couple of things. Personally, I found the gravy to be a little bland, so I added some onion soup mix (half a pack to the gravy and half to the burgers) and "doctored" it up with some additional seasonings (pepper, salt, garlic powder). I also added half a can of cream of mushroom soup and cut back on the amount of milk used, I probably used 1 cup in total. These are just preferences of mine. With my changes, I absolutely loved it and husband literally told me it was "to die for"! I made it with mashed potatoes and had plenty of mushrooms/gravy to spoon over both. I will most certainly make this again (with my changes). Thank you so much for sharing!

A + Recipe! We don't like mushrooms so I just subbed onions for them. Didn't change anything else - Why fix something that isn't broke?! The gravy is fantastic over mashed potatoes, and the patties are so moist and delicious! Thanks so much for the recipe! It is definitely a keeper!

This made a LOT of gravy.  Too much for the six small patties, even with mashed potatoes on the side.  If you are expecting large patties, you're not going to get them with only one pound of beef.  I'd suggest adding another pound of beef and making larger patties.

This is so easy and taste great. Everybody in my family loves it and there is never any leftovers. i would rate this recipe a 10 plus. Be careful with the salt because most crackers are already salted.

Easy to make and tastes great.  Patties broke apart easily; would recommend adding 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to solidify.

I followed this recipe very closely and it was delish. My only change was using fresh mushrooms (I think this is key). I found the poultry seasoning to be a little over powering so I will use less next time. Such a simple recipe to make any day.

This was really good. I made a few slight changes but nothing that changed the recipe dramaticly. I didn't have crackers, so i used quick oats instead, and i didn't have poultry seasoning so i just left it out. For the gravy, I used fresh mushrooms and added some onions sauted till tender then removed I added 2tbs of flour and i had to add a bit more butter to incorperate it,  I only had 2 beef boullins left, so i used that and 2 cups of milk. It instantly smelled like cream of mushroom soup but homemade. I really liked this recipe because most other recipes i tried, the patties ended up falling apart. The texture of the patties were fantastic. very nice flavores. I served with rice and greenbeans. My bf def. wants we to keep it in our rotation.

I used ground turkey.  I did as others suggested and sauteed fresh sliced mushrooms and onions.  Then I mixed a can of cream of mushroom soup and half a can of beef broth, with a dash of worcestershire sauce.  I poured this over the formed patties and baked it in the oven for about 45 minutes.  Sooooo tasty.

Amazing! My husband and 3yr old absolutely loved it! They've already asked when we're going to have it again!! :) I always read other reviews and followed these suggestions: Sauteed the onions; Omitted the can juice, and sauteed the mushrooms; I didn't have crackers or poultry seasoning so I used plain bread crumbs and Montreal steak spice instead; Added Worchester sauce.

This was good - but not fantastic. My sons loved the gravy on egg noodles though - so I will make that again for sure.  I might try to just make a hamburger gravy out of it.

I used onion powder instead of the finely chopped onion, but otherwise followed the recipe. I'd use real onion next time, as the recipe states, and maybe add a bit more seasoning, but generally very good. Makes a lot of nice, thick gravy.

Delicious comfort food! Served it to guests and they loved it. It tastes even better the next day. Made a couple substitutions: used 3 C organic mushroom broth and 1 can organic condensed mushroom soup instead of the milk, used 10 oz fresh mushrooms, and Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers in the patties.

Cooked this on a weeknight so I had to take some shortcuts.  Cooked the beef with fresh mushrooms and put them in a casserole dish. Then I added cream of mushroom soup (condensed) + 1 can of milk into the pan and scraped up the bits to make a sauce.  Poured that over the beef patties and baked on 350 for 1/2 hour.  It was delish!

I made this last night and followed the recipe as written.  Absolutly fantastic.  Easy to prepare.  The only problem, no leftovers!  Our family polished all the patties off.  Served with fresh green beans, mashed potatoes, and dinner rolls.  Perfect.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper in the recipe box!

This was a yummy recipe; my husband loved the fresh sautéed mushrooms. I plan on preparing this recipe in the future.

I made yummy recipe again this month, but with a little twist. I prepared it with fresh sautéed mushroom and onions, and cracker crumbs, but instated of patties, I made meatballs. It was an instant hit.

This was just ok.  I thought that the mixture needed some moisture with the cracker crumbs,  either milk or water.  Mixture was dry and not tender.  Used 85% ground beef and fresh sauteed mushrooms.

AMAZING!!  Followed the recipe exactly, except I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  This was absolutely delicious and incredibly easy to make.  I will make one change, though. I will make sure I double the recipe next time as we did not have any leftovers, and this is one dish where leftovers would be welcomed!

Good dish! Needs a few adjustments. I would leave out the beef bouillon next time and subsitute beef broth. Also, I used fat-free milk and it was the  perfect consistency.

At first I was pretty skeptical about this...it sounded....strange. My mom wanted to try it out tho so we had it for dinner one night and it was actually pretty good! It's tasty and the mushrooms drowning in their rich, creamy gravy is the perfect thing to top them with. Everyone liked it and I've made it several times now. I followed the recipe almost exactly the first time but used fresh mushrooms. This recipe makes way too much gravy, so now I make half the amount (with the same amount of fresh mushrooms) and half the amount of milk with chicken or beef stock. With those modifications, this makes a 5 star recipe.

Very easy and taste great! I didnt have any mushrooms so prob would have been even better! I made this dish first before I started my cheese potatoes to go with it, so I put the steaks with the gravy in the oven for 30 min so I didnt have to watch them on the stove. They were really tender. I didnt alter the recipe AT ALL! Will be adding this to my must have dinners........!!!!!!!

This was very good Salisbury Steak.  I did make a few changes based on the reviews I read.  Here is what I did:  In addition to the egg, salt, pepper and poultry seasoning, I added 1 t minced garlic, about 2 T finely chopped sweet onion and 1 t worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. I replaced the crackers in the meat mixture with 1/4 cup plain bread crumbs (I just didn't have crackers).  Then I mixed the meat in my Kitchen Aid mixer before shaping into 6 patties.  As for the gravy I made the following changes: First I cooked 1/2 a sweet onion in the butter then I added fresh mushrooms. I used 1/2 of an 8oz pkg of sliced. It really needed more.  Next time I will use all 8 ounces.  To the mushrooms and onions I stired in 1 t minced garlic and then 3 1/2 T flour.  To this I added 1 cup milk, 1 beef bouillion cube, 1 can swanson beef broth and 1 t worcestershire sauce. This was instead of the 3 cups of milk and 3 beef cubes.  After this thickened a bit, I added 1 can Heathy Request Cream of Mushroom soup.  Not wanting to overcok the gravy, I finished this up in the oven on 350 for 30 minutes.  My husband really liked this!

The mushroom gravy was great.  The only change I made was using fresh mushrooms instead of the canned.  I thought the patties could have had a bit more flavor.  Next time I'll add a bit of garlic to the ground beef mixture.  Really easy to make, made a great weeknight dinner with mashed potatoes and peas.    Update:  Made this a second time, again with fresh mushrooms.  I added a large clove of minced garlic,  extra onion and cracker crumbs to the beef patties.  Allowed the mushrooms to cookin in the butter for about 5 minutes to soften them up more, and added a bit of cornstarch to the gravy to thicken it up a bit.  Really perfect cold weather comfort food.

This was my first time trying salisbury steak so I was not sure what to expect.  I only deviated a little from the original recipe.  I sauteed my onions as I have found that helps the meat stick together better, and I like the flavor better as well.  I also added about a tsp. of Kitchen Bouquet to help thicken the gravy and 2 dashes of Worcheshire.  My husband loved it and so did I.  Served with baked potato.  Will be adding this to my recipe book!

I cut the milk down to  two cup and used only one can of mushrooms and the sauce still wouldn't thicken, so I wound up adding more flour. My husbands likes mushrooms, but said there where too many for this sauce. Next time I will cut back on the mushrooms and maybe add something else. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was a great recipe. I made a couple changes to the steak and to the gravy. I added worcestershire sauce to the patties and replaced the 2 T onion with the same amount of dried minced onion. I didn't have poultry seasoning on hand, so to replace it, I added a bit of sage, thyme and marjoram. For the gravy, I added an extra teaspoon of beef boullion granules and a can of cream of mushroom soup--as you can imagine, I had to add a bit more milk to thin the gravy. My husband and two year old both loved this recipe--we will definitely make it again.

With a few minor modifications, I think this recipe is great. I loved it. First time, I made it exactly to the recipe. After that, I used closer to two pounds of beef and eliminated using the canned mushrooms with their juice. I used fresh mushrooms and added two extra bullion cubes for more beef flavor to the gravy and let the patties cook a little longer in the gravy. This recipe is now a keeper! Thanks.

I used the gravy from this recipe and it was tasty and easy to make.  However, after reading the recipe I questioned the low amount of add in's to the meat.  I agreed with other reviewers that it would just taste like a hamburger patty.  Therefore, I used the "steak" recipe from the Salisbury steak recipe (also on this site).  The combination of recipes was 5 stars.

This was really good!!!  I had all of the ing. on hand and hubby really enjoyed.  Next time I might cut back a little on the gravy (it almost makes too much) and add just a bit more seasoning.  Thanx for sharing!!

I really liked this one. I however would use a little less milk so there is not as much sauce and maybe a little more flour to get it to thiken better. All in all though, My husband and I rellay liked this recipe and it will deffinitely get made again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did make some changes, as well. I put the mushrooms in the blender, so my boyfriend would eat them. Instead of bullion cubes I used 1 cup beef broth and 2 cups of milk. I also had to add some more flour, but it made a wonderful gravy!! Definately a BIG HIT!! Will make again.

We really liked this dish.  I used fresh mushrooms and added a little garlic salt.  Also added a little more flour to thicken up the sauce - it seemed a little thin to me. Still a great recipe!

This was GREAT!!! My husband said, "Mmmmmmm".  3 T cracker crumbs = 6 Ritz crackers. I've also used toasted bread crumbs. The gravy had a wonderful flavor and there was plenty of it for both meat and mashed potatoes. I added 1/2 tsp kitchen bouquet (browning sauce)to the gravy. The second time I made this I didn't have canned mushrooms so I sauteed a small package of fresh sliced ones and didn't worry about not having the juice from the can. It is even better with the fresh mushrooms! Thanks, this is indeed SCRUMPTIOUS Salisbury steak!

MMMMM This is the first recipe I have rated and I've been using this site for at least a year. This is so super yum! I used fresh mushrooms and added a 1/4C water to compensate for the liquid in the canned mushrooms. My hubby loved it and he usually hates mushrooms. Wonderful receipe!

I used only the gravy recipe this time as I had some pre-formed "Omaha Steak" hamburger patties I wanted to "smother" with some flavor.  This was fabulous and I can't wait to use the entire recipe.  Will definitely make the gravy again as well!

I liked these. I had a bunch of ground beef to use up so I subsituted milk for the egg, made the patties and froze them. I made them a few days ago and they came out wonderful. I used whole fresh mushrooms and it was pretty classy for a ground beef dish! LOL!! The gravy was very good and could stand on its own if need be.

I made some changes so that this would be more 'fat friendly'.  I replaced the ground beef with ground turkey and the crackers with matzo meal.  I omitted the poultry seasoning and omitted the butter--instead I used nonstick spray.  I seasoned the meat and the sauce with dried minced onion, season salt, minced garlic and lots of pepper.  Instead of using three cups of milk I used one can of fat free beef broth and enough non-fat milk to equal three cups and thickened with cornstarch.  I added a good squirt of ketchup as well and left out the liquid from the mushrooms.  I used corkscrew pasta and there was nothing left!  YUM!  This also is a great make and freeze meal!

Delish!  Will definitely make over & over!!  For lack of ingred., the changes I made were bread crumbs, beef seasoning, 1 can mush, 1/2 c. fresh mush, 1/3 cup water, and added a little bit of "Wyler's Shakers" beef bouillon with the reg. bouillon cubes.  Looking for a recipe to use that "free" case of beef patties you get from places like K.C. Steak Co. when you order steaks?  I tried to dip patties in egg first, then into dry ingred. and DID not work!(kept falling apart).  But then I just mushed the patties in w/ all the ingred. like the recipe calls for & Wa-Lah!.  Made an awesome flavor! I too added flour before mush.  Do not let the color fool you...I was expecting a dark brown & questioned adding even more bouillon shakers until I tasted it.  It was a light tan but had a flavor to die for!  Thank You!

This dish had a wonderful flavor and I will definately be adding it to my weeknight lineup.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I would make some changes.  Next time I will add the flour before the mushrooms and cook off a couple of minutes until the flour is incorporated.  Also make sure the milk is added gradually, stirring all the time, to make the gravy/sauce a little thicker.  Delicious, though, and my husband really liked it, too.

5 patties. Or four good-sized ones. Sour cream potato chips win over crackers. Sauté onions, 2 cans/1 lb. fresh shrooms & garlic in butter and remove/set aside before browning meat. Reduce milk to zero unless beige gravy is desired; increase liquid to 2.5 c. minimum (I used the remainder of an opened box of ready-made broth, approx 750ml). Cannex soup is unnecessary; more of a 'jus' than a cream sauce is preferable here, imo. The onions'll be caramelized by gravy-making time, mmm. Oh yeah, that's gravy made with cornstarch, not flour... The poultry seasoning (or some sage) adds a wondrous touch.

Caution on this recipe.  While it calls for you to "brown" the patties in a skillet, it really means for you to thoroughly cook them through.  I followed the directions precisely and my patties in the gravy were still emitting blood.  Not good.  I improvised and saved my dish at the last minute, but take a strong hint . . . cook the patties thoroughly before you do anything else with them.  Don't just brown them, as the recipe instructs.  Cook the patties at a lower heat than suggested in the recipe and let them cook thoroughly.  Also, make sure you don't get the patties too thick.

This is my first attempt at making Salisbury Steak and my first time writing a review, but this deserved it! DELICIOUS! I used ground bison as we had a lot of it in the freezer and I was looking for some new ways to use it. The only other changes I made was I cut the milk to 2 cups and used hot water for the other cup so I could dissolve my beef broth and seasoning (pretty much the same as beef bouillon, but that's what I normally have on hand). I also followed some other reviews and added some additional thin sliced onions in with my mushrooms for the gravy. I'm sure it would be every bit as good exactly as written, my changes were just to use what I had on hand.

I would use beef broth versus beef bouillon too salty. Fresh mushrooms sautéed in butter,add flour then broth

Easy to make because of the common ingredients, gravy was yummy.  I used sliced mushrooms instead of canned and doubled the onions because we love them.  Nice weeknight dinner - thank you!

I added Worcestershire sauce to the meat and the gravy, along with a few more spices: onion and garlic powder.  Doubled the meat to 2 lbs. (and the ingredients for the patties), but kept the gravy the same and it was plenty for 6 Salisbury steaks.  I did have to add a bit of cornstarch slurry to get it to thicken up.  Otherwise, made as written and it was just what I was looking for.  Finished with a sprinkling of parsley.

Family loved it! I didn't have poultry seasoning so used italian spices instead and followed one of the tips adding Worcestershire sauce to both patties and gravy, you just have to be careful though , if gravy turns sour add a little bit more of cream or sugar. Also, I only used 1.5 cups of milk and 1.5 cups beef stock. I wanted more of the beef savoury taste in the gravy that had a taste of milk instead of having it as milk with a taste of beef. Been using this recipe 2x a month now! Thanks again!

This was pretty darn good. I read the reviews so I sauteed the mushrooms and 1/2 a diced onion in 1 cup chicken broth and 3 Tbs. butter. I also added garlic salt, pepper and Worcestershire to the gravy. I was out of crackers, so I subbed breadcrumbs for them. I thickened it with cornstarch. A delicious and easy recipe using things I usually have on hand. This one is a keeper.

I have been looking for a recipe for Salisbury Steak for awhile and this one had the ingredients that I wanted....and it was AWESOME!! My husband raved about it for at least 2 hours after dinner.  Made as written and served with mashed potatoes. It made great leftovers too.

It was awesome. I did however, use what was in the pantry and fridge.
   As others suggested. I used a basket of mushrooms some Worchester sauce, an onion, clove of garlic browned in butter and then added the flour,some milk and beef bouillon
  If you don't have poultry seasoning , season the beef as per your taste! Seasoning salt? onion powder?  Trust your buds.

This was good. I doubled the meat mixture because one lb of ground beef was never going to feed 6 at our house. No need to double sauce, there was a lot! Serve with mashed potatoes or noodles or something to soak up gravy. Begining cooks note:
make sure to cook your flour for a minute or two so that your gravy doesn't have a raw flour taste. This was comfort food and I would probably make this one again.

This is great the way it is. We love it as is, no need to modify it in anyway.  Never used a milk based gravy before for beef, but I definately will use it in other recipies as well.

I tried this recipe today. My husband, me and the kids all loved it! I plan on adding this to our list of regular recipes. 

I few things I did different-
-I cooked the patties on the George Foreman Grill...just cause I'm lazy...lol
-I used venison burger because that's what we eat mostly
-I didn't have beef bullion so I used chicken...it still turned out delicious, but I can't wait to try again with the beef bullion! :)

Very simple, relatively quick and everybody enjoyed it. What more could you ask? I did use fresh baby bella mushrooms, otherwise made as written. Sauce/gravy thickened up beautifully and was well-seasoned (meaning, to my family's tastes). Really good recipe; thanks for sharing!

Delicious! The only change I made was to use fresh mushrooms in place of the canned. I served with mashed potatoes and salad. Will definitely make again - even though my 6 yo daughter didn't care for it.

Easy & quick. Excellent taste. My 5 y/o son said it was a keeper. Can be a little salty as mentioned in other review, however we didn't mind the salty taste. Can leave out the salt in the meat to help reduce the over salt taste. Used skim milk & it did fine.

Very good recipe. You might want to season your patties a bit more but other than that very good!

I've made this recipe four times now and each time the family LOVES it!  I usually make enough to freeze as a TV dinner for the hubby's late nights.  I've tried other salisbury steak recipes using soups, and they don't compare.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Followed exactly, just added 1 more can of mushrooms.  Just use juice of 2 cans not the last.

I rate this 3.5 stars.  It was pretty good, but I won't make it often. Good comfort food if you ask me.  The gravy took a long time to thicken (it did thicken nicely) even at medium heat. I almost added more flour but glad I didn't; I think it would have tasted too much like flour if I did.  I didn't get 6 1-inch patties out of the beef, only 5 3.5 to 4 inch patties which was ok with me.  Oh, I used fresh mushroom and sauted them until they started to darken just a *little* bit before adding the flour which worked out in the end since the gravy took so long to thicken.  I think if I had sauted them longer to make them can style soft if you will, they would've been over cooked.  I also added some sliced onion  (sauted with sh'rooms)because I like the combo and I had an opened one in the fridge that needed to be used.

I also think this gravy would be a good base for stroganoff too.

This was a good recipe.  I gave it 4 stars because the timing is off, it took 20 minutes longer.  Also 3 cups is too much milk, my gravy never got thick enough.
****I made this again and reduced the milk to 1 1/2 cups and it turned out great.

This is an amazing recipe.  It's easy to make and SO full of flavor!  I used fresh mushrooms, and since I didn't have an onion, I used dry onion flakes.  I served it with mashed potatoes and fresh bread.

I was a little Leary about this, made a few tweaks to the receipe but when all said & done, it was delish!  The kids & husband devoured it first then worked on the sides, which pleased me.  I made it with egg noodles but the gravy congealed to quickly, not sure how to fix that.  It was yummy tho! :)

It's a good base, but even after adding extra spices, my family and I still found it to be bland. I will definitely try at least once more, but will be adding lots of spices to it to give it more flavor. 
Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome!!  I have two boys, (my son and my boyfriend) who HATE mushrooms so I opted those out and I am THE worlds worst at homemade gravies, and this turned out spectacular!!  I even got a 'this was awesome' compliment!!  Cut the milk to 1 cup and beef broth to 1 cup. Amazing recipe, thanks!

We thought this was pretty good, though a little bland.  It might be because I used fresh instead of canned mushrooms, though.  I'd suggest additional pepper and only 2 1/2 cups of milk.  I liked that it avoided canned cream soups!!!

This is a great recipe!!  I made it just like it's written except didn't add the 1/2 tsp. of salt to the meat mixture - Didn't miss it either.  Tip:  Pick up a bag of Ore-Ida Steam and Mash russet potatoes
in the frozen food aisle.  It will cook in the microwave while the salisbury steak is cooking.
Mash the potatoes, add a salad, and you've got an A++++ meal.

Made this last night.  Quick and delicious.  Used two cups of beef broth and 1 cup of milk.  I used fresh mushrooms.  We loved it.  Will definitely make again. I used less bouillon to taste with no MSG.

So simple.  So good.  I think I had more like 1.5 lbs hamburger and I only used about half of the milk.  The gravy was looking a little thin, but it thickened up just fine.  By the time I got around to putting the leftovers up, it was really thick.  But then again, I only used half the milk with the recommended flour.  Anyways, this was very good as written.  It would also be good to add a few things to your taste like onions, garlic, etc.  I would suggest you give it a try.

Best Salisbury Steak ever!  My family never cared for the traditional onion soup gravy so I tried this and it was a hit! The milk gravy is so good. Everyone looks forward to this meal.

We really enjoyed this meal... the changes I made on the 2nd go-round...  used Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers, no poultry seasoning, and used an 8 oz container of fresh baby bellas instead of canned shrooms.  I served it with egg noodles and garnished w/ a bit of parmesan - delicious :)

I want to start this review with saying I changed nothing from the ingredients. I also can admit I messed one step up a little bit. However, what came out was more than delicious and I sincerely look forward to eating this dish again (And hopefully getting it completely right :D.) The meat had the consistency and flavor that Salisbury should and the sauce was perfect!

Mmmm-Mmmm-Mmmm...DELICIOUS!  Modified the recipe a bit by: adding beef broth instead of the bouillon cubes/1 cup milk/fresh mushrooms/steak seasoning instead of poultry.  and served over mashed potatoes. This is a keeper!

Was rushing while I was making this and didn't refer back to the reviews - wish I had. 4 stars because as made the sauce was way too runny. Ended up using beef broth for part of the milk and then needed to add more flour and a can of cream of mushroom soup to thicken.  Then it was just right. Next time I will leave out the juice from the mushrooms. I added some minced garlic and used onion powder in place of the chopped onion. Was concerned about the amount of pepper, but shouldn't have been. 5 stars for the patty. It had a wonderful flavor. Will definitely make this again, but next time will not put as much liquid in for the sauce.

I tried this recipe for the gravy, not the meat patties since I already have a certain way I like to make mine.  I didn't have buttery crackers so I just used some Panko bread crumbs like I always do...and instead of fresh onion I added a little Lipton's Beefy Onion Soup Mix (combined with about 1/3 C. natural beef stock) to the mix.  That takes care of the salt, so I just add a little fresh cracked black pepper.  I did follow the advice of some other cooks and used some beef stock in place of some of the milk for the gravy, and I still think it's too milky.  This would be great over a chicken fried steak perhaps, but not so much with this type of beef.  I really prefer the 'beefy' type of gravy with this recipe.  I ended up adding about half a can of cream of mushroom soup (was trying to avoid doing that) to even out the flavor...and that helped out a lot.  Sorry, I know I didn't stick with the recipe but I can already tell you the 'milkiness' of this gravy is not what I prefer with Salibury steak.  So after the changes I made I will give it 4 stars b/c it is still pretty good that way.

I wanted a recipe that didn't use cream of mushroom soup and was still easy.  This is it!  Yum, yum, yum!  A great comfort food.  The only thing I changed was to use fresh mushrooms instead of canned which I would definitely recommend!  This would also be good with some sliced onion added w/ the mushroom sauce as well.

I made this recipe with few exceptions--- I used a combination of meats: ground beef, pork and veal.  I did not have the buttery crackers so I sauteed some bread crumbs in butter and add that to the meat mixture in a bowl.  Rather than mushrooms, I browned an onion in the pan drippings after removing the steaks. Then continued with the gravy.  Served with mashed potatoes, this recipe is a "keeper".   One "tip" I learned when making burgers--since many of us have the habit of flattening the burgers so they cook through to our liking, we lose so much of the juices that keep the meat moist. If you depress the middle of the burgers BEFORE cooking them as if you were poking a hole in a donut, as they cook the burger center will "rise" up to equal the sides around it and you will have a perfectly cooked burger!  I have tried this several times and can attest that it works.  I did it with these Salisbury Steaks and they were EXCELLENT!!!!!

This was delicious! I didn't have beef bullion, so I used chicken and I left out the salt. Added to my monthly menu.

I halved the milk and added beef broth and cream of mushroom soup, as suggested. I also baked it for 30 minutes. Good with fresh mushrooms.

Yum! The steaks were excellent, altho I think I'd prefer them thinner next time, but the flavor was great! I could NOT get the gravy to thicken so I ended up adding more milk w/cornstarch to the simmering pan of gravy. I served this w/Traditional Mashed Potatoes from AR.

I used heavy cream in place of half the milk, cut out the beef bullion and added a little garlic powder to my meat (which was ground turkey instead of beef). I also put a few pieces of mushroom and onion into the grinder and added it to the meat before cooking. Overall awesome.

Can't give it less than 5 stars, as hubby and son declared it "delicious" and want it every night! I like the fact that it is not made with condensed soup - this way, I can control the salt. I used just over 2 cups of milk, and the gravy was very thick (will use slightly more, next time). This was a hearty and filling meal.

07/30/09-- Made this again tonight...I had everything tonight and I can not wait to make it again. I tripled the recipe and so good thank you....again   I had  misfortune with the crackers so I used oatmeal. It was a chance but it turned out so good. I added 3 tbs of oatmeal instead of crackers but kept the rest the same. My husband and kids loves this recipe and wants it again tomorrow night. Thank you so much for this recipe I would add more stars if it was possible.

I made this with fresh mushrooms and the gravy was delicious!  However, I think next time I'll leave the poultry seasoning out of the meat.  I thought it added an odd taste.  But other than that, very good.  Will make again.  Thanks!

This recipe was so good! We loved it. It took about 1 hours from start to eating it and the gravy was really good. I had to use a bit of cornstarch to thicken the gravy more but other than that the recipe is good and I will definately make it again!

This is good. It is very easy and theres plenty of time for clean up while it is cooking....which is a bonus. recipe called for 3 cups of milk...I only used 2 and still had way more than enough gravey. This is a good recipe for kids and husbands/boyfriends. i would NOT reccommend preparing this for company becaue the gravy doesn't look as good as it tastes.

Excellent recipe. It is perfect paired with potatoes and corn. My family, including my picky 8 year old son, even loved this. I only used one can of mushrooms and omitted the juice I also added 1 1/2 to 2 cups of milk (we love extra gravy) and garlic powder to taste. There wasn't any meat left, but there were some potatoes and gravy, so we ate the leftovers the next night and the flavor was incredible. I will definitly make this quite often. Thanks.

I've already made this recipe twice and my family loves it, my husband actually begs for me to make it constantly.  Even my son who hates meat loves it.  I added browning sauce to it, using fresh mushrooms, and as for the onion I added what the recipe required to the meat and sautéing what was left of the onion in the butter before adding the mushrooms.  All in all it's delicious and is definately staying in my family's regular rotation.

The beef was a tad bit bland and needs a little more taste. Next time I will add onion, garlic and spices to the burgers.  
Other than that, it is a great recipe and I will definitely be making it again!

This was pretty good. I rinsed the mushrooms and sauteed them with butter and garlic before making the gravy, and used cornstarch instead of flour. Two picky eaters loved it over mashed potatoes, although the 14yr old said it looked like cafeteria food:)

This is sooooooooooo yummy!  I only made 2 modifications. I added another small can (with juice) of mushrooms for gravy. Also, in the meat mixture in the beginning of forming patties I mixed a little Dale's meat marinade in with it - yum!  Wouldn't change anything else.  We had this over rice, even my 3 year said he loved it! A great comfort food and keeper! Thanks!!

Super delicious!  Loved it!  Not diet food but definitely comfort food.  Perfect with wide egg noodles and green beans.  Fresh mushrooms (instead of canned) make it way way better.  Delish!

LOVE this recipe! I've made it a few times already and we cobble it up every time. The only thing I change is that I use fresh mushrooms but I keep everything else the same.
Thanks for an easy, very tasty dinner!

I made this for dinner with some modifications - 1 1/2 lbs ground chuck, 1/2 c. sauteed onions added to meat mix, garlic, 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, & fresh sliced/sauteed mushrooms. Delicious flavor.

This isn't the prettiest of dishes, but it sure is tasty. I followed reviewers' advice and cut the milk (I used soy) to one cup and then used two cups of chicken broth. Great with mashed potatoes.

I used fresh mushrooms instead of the canned.  In order to add some "juice" I didn't have from the can when combining with the flour, I used some red wine.  The flavor really came out in the sauce and it was delicious!!

This recipe reminded me of the wonderful salisbury steak I used to have when I was young!! I absolutely loved this recipe because it was so easy and yummy. It went great with my whipped potatoes. I think I did end up adding just a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Wonderful!

My husband is a meat and potatoes guy so he likes this pretty good. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and sauteed a whole chopped onion with the mushrooms instead of adding it to the beef.

I thought this was very tasty. I had more than a pound of hamburg so I added 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning. I also added garlic and extra cracker crumbs and 2 eggs. I used fresh mushrooms and extra butter a tablespoon more. I also used a bit more flour to thicken. My gravy was brown and flavorful. Served over butter noodles. I had thought about adding peas to it but changed my mind at the last second since it was a brown rich sauce for me. I don't know why it was white sauce for some people.

Like I always say, I make a new recipe exactly as written the first time. I did change this one, but only the ratios of items.  It came out very well with the amount as well as consistency of gravy.  However, I found it to be rather bland----with little beef flavor & I used ground round.  Next time I will follow the suggestion of another reviewer & add some of my own ideas to this one.

I made this recipe last night and it was pretty good. I followed it exactly. I did end up adding some cornstarch at the end to thicken it a bit more because I wanted a thicker gravy. Another problem I had was the cooking time. It needs about 30 mins to cook in the sauce or else the "steaks" don't get completely done in the middle.Also just a word of advise, watch the bouillon cubes you use because some are too salty and will affect the flavour. I will make this again!

When I tried this recipe I was hoping for a rich brown gravy on the meat, but what I got was more like a thick bland country style gravy.  I didn't care for the flavor of the poultry seasoning with the beef.  I couldn't get my kids to eat it.  I will not try  this recipe again.  Sorry.

This was VERY good.  I used fresh mushrooms and the gravy didn't thicken, though, so I had to use some cornstarch, which was no problem at all.  It does make a LOT of gravy!

I added onion and fresh mushrooms to the patties and used evap fat free milk.  B'friend loved it - he's a mushroom freak.  It was ok for me.  I'm sure I'll make it again.

Great recipe!  Wonderful flavor.  The only changes I made was I used almost two pounds of meat, therefore, adding one more egg, 3 more tablespoons of bread crumbs(I used these instead of crackers), and doubled onions, salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning to accomadate for extra meat.  I also added a couple of splashes of worchestershire sauce to the meat.  I left the gravy mixture as is.  The taste was wonderful.  I didn't double it for the added meat.  It was just enough, you gotta have something to pour over your rice:)  And, it all took little time and effort to make this dish.  I will most certainly make this again.  I have a feeling it will become a regular family meal staple.  Also, I used a very lean meat and helped it to brown using a little vegetable oil in the pan.  No need to drain with such a little amount of oil, plus you get the added flavor of all the little black tidbits left in the bottom of the pan.

This was very good;however, in search of the perfect salisbury steak for my hubby, I've tried several and the best so far is Hamburger Steak with Onions and Gravy (at this site) by Anne Sweden. You will have to double the gravy, (and I added fresh mushrooms)  but its well worth it.  This is my personal opinion and I mean no disrespect to the recipe I'm reviewing.  Just liked the other one better.

This was so easy and delicious. Real comfort food! The second time I made this I made three changes, I used fresh mushrooms, used low sodium beef broth(in place of the milk and cubed bouillon) and cornstarch for the gravy, and served with chive and cream cheese mashed potatoes.  WONDERFUL!!!  I only WISH my grandma had made this for me!

We all liked this.  I used fresh mushrooms, and I threw in a can of golden mushroom soup since I didn't have the juice from the mushroom can.  I omitted the salt based on the other reviews, and it came out just fine.  My husband thought it tasted like something from a diner.  It wasn't my favorite Salisbury Steak recipe, but I thought it was pretty good, too.  Thanks!

This is a good recipe.  Our family loves salisbury steak.  My staple recipe makes a creamier gravy using cream of mushroom soup as well as other seasonings for the meat but this was very good also, I just think we will stay with our old standby.

I made this recipe for my 2 & 4 yr old children and they loved it!!! It's a nice home cooked meal. I also eliminated poultry seasoning and only used 1 can of mushrooms, and it was wonderful. Definately will be making this again.

This is a very good recipe for salisbury steak.  Those who complained that it was more like a hamburger - that is what salisbury steak is!  I too used fresh mushrooms.  I sauteed them with onion and when enough liquid had formed I added 1 beef bullion cube.  I added that juice to my electric skillet in place of the canned mushroom juice while I was cooking the beef patties.  Only other change I made was I added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup sour cream to the sauce at the end.  Served over egg noodles. YUMMY!!!  My husband and I fought over the leftovers for our lunch.

This was very good comfort food served with mashed potatoes.  It does not taste like the salisbury steak I am looking for, but I will definitely make this again.  The teenager turned her nose up until she tasted it.  She wound up getting seconds!  Definitely worth a try.

The gravy wasn't very thick, but this was a delicious meal that my husband really enjoyed.  I sauteed onions and mushrooms and then stirred them into the gravy once everything  was combined. I will make this again.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  It was easy, fast and contained ingredients I had on hand. And yes, the gravy is delish.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was good. It didn't "Wow" me or anything but it is a good home cooked meal to serve to your family.

Although my kids passed on it, my wife and I thought it was great! I did take the easy route and use gravy from a powder mix, but it was still wonderful, especially served with mashed potato. It will certainly go into the rotation, and the kids I guess can have mac & cheese instead.

This was a great meal.  I changed the recipe slightly, however.  I made the burgers a little thicker and added fresh mushrooms, rather than canned.  I recommend serving with white rice, rather than potatoes.  Also, the estimated time to prepare was off by about 30 minutes.

Pretty dang good.  My husband loved it, and it was fairly easy to make.  I satueed fresh mushrooms and that was delicious.  But if you really want to save time, just open a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I'll be making this again! Served with mashed potatoes and a green salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

We loved this.  The only changes we made was used 2 cups of milk and omitted the bullion because of salt and used 2 cups of beef broth 99% fat free.  Used mushrooms minus juice.  It still came out a little thin so I whisked in a little corn starch to thicken it to our liking.  Wonderful.  Thanks for the post.

I followed the recipe exactly and it did not turn out very good at all. The gravy was very thin and the meat was a little dry. Sorry to be the first one to give this recipe a nonperfect review, but I will not be making this recipe again.

This recipe turned out better than I was expecting it to, since I've never made Salisbury Steak.  Here are the changes I made:  
1) Saute 1 medium onion until carmelized.  Push the onions to the side of the frying pan while the patties are cooking.
2) After I put the patties in the oven to stay warm (on "Warm" setting, I sauteed a container of fresh mushrooms, not canned. 
3) Add the milk and bouillon to the pan with the sauteed onions and mushrooms.  I substituted 3 heaping teaspoons of"Better Than Bouillon" paste for bouillon cubes.

Side notes:  I served this with a wild rice pilaf.  Since the salisbury steak mixture is tan and wild rice is a very dark brown, I added lightly sauteed carrot shreds (bought shredded from the store) and frozen peas to the wild rice.  Actually, I transferred the wild rice to the same pan I sauteed the carrots and peas in.  Along with steamed broccoli, the green from the peas and broccoli and orange from the carrots made the plate more interesting to look at.

Made a very good week night meal.  Next time I'll probably use fresh mushrooms and maybe some onions like suggested by others, but this is good as is.

I used fresh mushrooms and onions. Sautéed them prior to the meat. Used 1.5 cups of milk and 1.5 cups beef broth as others suggested. Made with a side of mashed potatoes. Whole family loves it.

This is incredible comfort food that isn’t outrageously unhealthy (not that it qualifies as “health food” though). I make it according to the instructions, except I reduce the amount added salt. I leave the drippings in the pan (turning the heat up pretty high to cook the patties) and then let any additional excess fat drain from the patties as they are sitting aside while I make the sauce—but there’s not much excess fat to begin with since I use lowest fat hamburger meat available. Using a huge pan helps so that there is plenty of space between the patties as they cook so that liquid doesn’t accumulate around the patties and “steam” them, and the fat can cook down to that crispy crusty deliciousness that adds the hearty beef flavor to the sauce. This makes excellent leftovers, too!

I made this using 2 cups of beef broth and 1 cup of milk, and used fresh mushrooms, as that’s all I had, oh, and one minced garlic clove in the meat mixture. It’s WONDERFUL!!! We were both in comfort food heaven!! Thanks for a great recipe!

This turned out really good.  I only added 2 bouillon so it wouldn't be too salty.  It took longer to thicken than I expected so I was worried it wouldn't.  It turned out fine.  I also added more pepper to the gravy.

My husband and I both really liked this. I did add sliced onions along with the mushrooms. I didn’t think it was going to hold together - I had 1.11 lb. of hamburger meat, so maybe that made a difference. It made great leftovers, and I will make this again.

I made by the recipe. My family ate but no one loved it. Some of us don’t like raw onion and although the onion was cooked in the patty it still crunched. I would leave out the pepper and reduce salt. Let them add their own at table as I found there was too much of both for me. Even my son who I would expect to be OK with the salt and pepper still did not care for it. Maybe it would be better with fresh mushrooms.

Following others, I pre-cooked the onion, used fresh mushrooms, and used beef broth instead of some milk (though I'm not sure that's any different than the 3 bullion cubes).

Everybody loved it and the gravy was awesome with mashed potatoes.  150-200% the meat portion to match the amount of gravy.

I didn't make any changes, but next time I think I would cut the poultry seasoning in half and add some worcester sauce to the ground beef or sauce.  Not sure which would be better.

My family loved this recipe!! I used tips from the other reviews such as using cornstarch instead of flour. I used the 1 c of milk and 2 c beef broth as suggested.  The one thing I did diffrent is I did saute the mushrooms but I used the dry saute method to cut down on the butter.  Dry saute you use a hot pan and stir the muchrooms until they release their juice.

This is such a good recipe, but using 3 bouillon cubes makes it just too salty.  Better to use 1 tsp of better than beef bouillon.  Makes 4 patties. 6 are way too small, unless you have little kiddies.  Fresh mushrooms a must !  Enjoy!

I made the recipe pretty much as stated, except for adding a few things to the meat such as worchestshire sauce and garlic. Make sure you don't make parties too thick. If I were to make it again, I would brown them longer, a couple were still a little pink. I did use all 3 cups of the milk and if you are patient and cook on low, it did get plenty thick but I think it was almost too much gravy. I served with mashed potatoes and the gravy was good on them as well. I'm not sure if I would make again but I didn't hate it either.

I doubled the meat recipe because I could tell the milk amount would make a lot of gravy. I put chopped green peppers in the beef and added rings of onion the same time I put the mushrooms in the skillet for the gravy.  Fantastic
Now one of my favorite recipes.
If you wanted a smaller amount, just half the gravy

I will probably make it again, but would leave the poultry seasoning out.   Also, I would drain the mushrooms before adding to the gravy.  I added Lawry's Seasoning Salt.

Followed the recipe to the letter. It was good but not great. Needs more spice and flavor. Next time I think  I will use cream of Mushroom soup and Worcestershire to add a little more flavor.

Yes I will make it again.  Didn't have beef bullion to put in and it will be better next time I make it, but we enjoyed eating it very much.  I had four beef patties and I halfed the ingredients in the sauce.

I read the reviews & used fresh mushrooms. I don't like bouillon cubes, so I used a Tbs of Better than Bouillon. It tasted good, but the meat was still medium rare after cooking as directed. If I do this again, I will cook it longer, maybe covered.

I need to try this again, gravy was white, no flavor. I even used more seasoning than called for. The milk and flour,,, don't know how this turns out to be brown Salisbury steak gravy.  Adding beef broth helped a bit to fix whatever mistake I made. It was more like country fried steak gravy.

Tasted just like meatloaf. Would be much better with ketchup than that overly-milky gravy. Waste of time and money.

I did tweak the gravy, but boy, was this off the chain delish!
Gravy: 10 oz. water and four beef bullion cubes. Chop: 1/3 onion and add to water. Add salt and pepper, bring to boil. Turn down heat and add one can cream of mushroom soup. Stir until blended well while continuing to simmer. Add in small cup: Three Tbs. flour and water until mixed well with fork. Add slowly to liquid until thick and bubbly.

I didn't read any past reviews so I made this exactly like it was written except I drained my can of mushrooms. My husband said it was really good without me even asking him. That doesn't happen too often. I liked that I had all the ingredients on hand. I will be making this again just as I did the first time.

Absolutely a husband approved dinner.  It does make a lot of gravy and I am looking forward to serving the leftovers on egg noodles.  Only  thing I changed was to add a dash of Worchestershire Sauce to give it a little more flavor.

Love this recipe, but being particularly lazy I just used one can of Campbell's beef consomme and 1 can of mushroom soup and added milk to get the desired consistency for my gravy. My husband loves this dish. We are not big eaters so I always make four patties 2 rounded ones and 2 flat ones to use for Salisbury steak sandwiches .  I often make patty melts with them using rye bread, lots of fried onion and cheese. I don't know which I like best the original or the leftover night but both are delicious.

Awesome! Used fresh mushrooms and a can of condensed French onion soup. Added the Worcestershire sauce. Big hit with the family.

I only made the sauce, and I used 8 oz. fresh mushrooms and an onion sauted in butter, 2 tsp. beef bouillon & a can of mushroon soup. Turned  out pretty good and very easy.

I make this every time my family wants hamburgers because I might be the only American that doesn't like them. I don't used canned anything that is available fresh including making my own broths so I subbed some.  Good basic recipe  to play with.

I do not agree with using canned mushrooms for this recipe. Fresh mushrooms are better. Aside from the small change I followed the recipe, but I do not think the poultry seasoning was needed... For that matter I don't think the salt was needed either. In fact the salt, pepper,and poultry seasoning to be left out and Montreal steak seasoning could be used instead.

I made as written , except sauted fresh Portobello  srooms separately in butter first and put aside.  Cooked the meat separately and put aside.  Then did the gravy, added a dozen SMALL, skinned white onions simmered until soft, and then combined everything.  Served with mashed potatoes and it was comfort food heaven.

great recipe, but lacks a lots of seasoning in the sauce. Tasted like nothing, so you will need to add pepper ,garlic, onion powder, whatever you like.season to your taste. but overall ver good.

my boyfriend couldn't stop talking about how good this was he said he was looking for his mom when he tasted it lol. but instead of seasoning it with salt and pepper I poured in a pack of Lipton onion soup powder that really set it. also I put the sliced onions in with the mushrooms and sautéed them together.

I used
1.5 c milk
1.5 c beef broth
1 can cream mushroom soup
Drain mushroom juices into bowl, combine mushroom juice, milk and beef broth, stir in 4 tbs flour. Add to mushrooms once fried.

Hamburger patties had great flavor.  Gravy was good, but not as much flavor.  It looked like the gravy was going to be runny so I only added 2 cups of milk.  Also, I substituted 3 tsp. of beef bullion - didn't have the cubes.

Wonderful taste and easy to make.  I substituted beefy onion dry soup mix instead of bullion, and used 1/2 cup of half and half with the whole milk for the gravy.  I also used onion powder instead of chopped onions.  I will be making this again.  It goes great with potato salad.

This is a great recipe! I did make some changes, though...I used dried onion soup mix to flavor the beef instead of poultry seasoning. I also added a little garlic, onions, and Worcestershire sauce to the gravy. I served it with sour cream and chives mashed potatoes. My husband liked it and so did my 2 year old. Will definitely be making this again.

I used everything the recipe had suggested with one exception. I added diced tomatoes to it. And that made it, in opinion, more scrumptious! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us.

This is delicious.  A family favorite!  The only thing I do differently is add garlic powder, because I put garlic powder in everything.  In general, this recipe is perfect as it is.

I don't eat red meat but my husband really liked this. I followed others advice and used 16 oz of fresh mushrooms (sauted) and 1 1/2 cups milk and 1 1/2 cups beef broth. Thank you for the recipe.

Sautéed half an onion with the mushrooms. Kept the milk to beef broth ratio the same but used "Better than Boullion" to make the broth and it tasted great- made a great gravy and I wouldn't change it. Served over egg noodles.

Yay, I have leftovers!  I made this for two people, and it was delicious!  I can't wait to finish it tonight.  I did make three very slight adjustments:  I used the Italian bread crumbs as recommended by others, formed only 4 patties as the chuck shrinks, and I made the gravy thicker with additional flour.   Wow, this is a new favorite way of cooking ground beef for me.

Our family really liked this recipe. The flavor reminded us more of Swedish meatballs but without the work of rolling the meat into balls.

This was really good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I was really worried about how much milk I used and it was very runny at the end.  I ended up adding about 3 teaspoons of cornstarch.  I don't know if it helped or not, but it was excellent when we started eating it. and the next day was even better!

Delicious and easy! Husband pronounced it "Awesome," which is something, as he is a picky health conscious eater. P.S. I used fresh mushrooms and no bouillon cubes per others suggestions and did not need Cornstarch.

I made this for 5.  It was liked by all.  I was worried I did not have enough gravy so added 1 more cup of milk, extra mushrooms and flour and had way too much gravy left over.  Very tasty though.

Good recipe! Sautéed some mushrooms I had in the fridge instead of using the canned. Shook the flour and some of the milk together to avoid dealing with clumps. I didn't find it too salty as some reviewers did. Liked the amount of gravy it made. Everyone enjoyed. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

I followed most and added 2 cans of cream of mushrooms to the sauce.the sauce was a bit bland so I seasoned it to my liking and it was perfect. I sauté my mushrooms  and onions and I added a lil bit of minced garlic. I only did 1 and a half cup of milk and a can of beef broth. Hubby and daughter  LOVED IT!!

Good recipe although I used FRESH mushrooms. Don't know why anyone would ever use canned mushrooms, if it's convenience, you CAN get them fresh AND sliced.

My family and I really enjoyed this dish.  It was so hearty and delicious.  Although, I'm glad I went with my gut.  It didn't seem possible that 1 lb. of ground beef would feed six.  I doubled the recipe for six of us and we only had one plate of leftovers.  I added onions like a lot of others suggested and they were a nice addition.

Followed but adjusted the recipe a little. All done it was delicious. My daughter who's not a fan of salisbury steak really loved it and wanted 3rds but it was all gone.  Will definitely make again!

This turned out really good. The whole family loved it. I did adjust it a little to our own preferences but basically the same. 
I used fresh mushrooms and chopped garlic,sauteed with a lot more onions in the butter,also 2 cups milk and one can of beef broth.It thickened up nicely. I served it over rotelli and sprinkled fresh chopped parsley on top,so good and also would be great over mashed potatoes. My family is looking forward to this again soon.

Awesome recipe!  Took the advice of others and used fresh mushrooms cooked prior to adding to gravy (especially since I read that canned mushrooms are allowed, per fda, to contain up to 20 mites/can, whether this is true or not I prefer to err on the side of caution)...  This is the first review I've ever written and I've used quite a few recipes on here.  I found this dish so easy and so yummy, as did my husband and 17 yr old picky daughter, that I wanted to try and cancel out one of the bad reviews- don't listen to them!  Esp if you're adept in the kitchen and can make the slight modifications necessary to fit your preference.  Thanks for the recipe!

very much enjoyed this. I took the suggestion of using italian bread crumbs. we also only used 1/2 the mushrooms (my husband doesn't like them and conveniently only brought one can home.).. amazingly he LOVED the steak and gravy including the mushrooms. this is a big deal for my mushroom hating hubby. looking forward to making these again.

This recipe was sooo goood and it turned out really well. The gravy is easy to make, just make sure to use a fork to stir at first to press the lumps out. I just squished them with the fork. Once the gravy sits it gets this filmy type skin that I took off with a spoon or re-heating and stiring will dissolve it. As the gravy sits, it also thickens, so you will need to add just a little more milk to thin it out just a bit. The salisbury steak was also very good. I definetly will make this again.

I'd never thought of adding poultry seasoning to ground beef before but it definitely made the meat delicious.  I'll probably start using it in my meatloaf too.  I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of the cracker crumbs, fresh mushrooms instead of canned and half milk and half beef broth for the gravy.  I found that this resulted in very bland gravy, so I quickly dissolved a couple tablespoons of bouillon in some hot water and added that to the gravy, plus a ton of pepper.  I did end up adding a bit of corn starch water too because I like a thick gravy.  It was wonderful.   Hearty and comforting.  Will make again!

I tried this recipe for the very first time last night. I thought it was great, just a little salty. I should have read the reviews, next time I try this and I will try it I will try the suggestions and tips I have read in the reviews. Instead of using buttery crackers, I used saltine crackers and increased the tablespoons, I aslo did not add poultry seasoning. I served with butter noodles. This recipe is quick and easy!!

I used more like 1/2 cup chopped onion for the patties, as I felt they would need a little more flavor, used fresh mushrooms and only two cubes of bouillon.  I added just a smidge of Worcestershire to the gravy, to make it like my Mom used to make it.  I might try just one bouillon cube next time, as the gravy was a bit too salty for our tastes, but overall this was a great comfort food dinner.

I used 8 oz of fresh mushrooms instead of canned, added fresh garlic, and added some fresh parley at the end, but otherwise made the recipe as written. It was yummy! I served it with corn bread and green beans, but I think it would be excellent on top of some flat noodles.

This was Yummy! The only changes I made was used bread crumbs instead of crackers because that is what I had on hand. I also doubled the recipes because we wanted some leftovers for lunch. This was my first time making gravy and I was VERY afraid that it would turn out a lumpy mess but it came out perfect and delicious. This is a great sunday dinner. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and veggies.

Made this for dinner tonight. Followed the recipe exactly as written.  The family gave it two enthusiastic thumbs up! My girls are not big fans of mushrooms so I was so suprised when they both said the gravy was delish!  This is definitely going in my recipe box.

This is really tasty, comfort food-type of dish.  Relatively easy to make.  Lots of gravy left-over though.  Seems like lots of reviewers change up the recipe a bit.  I like it as it is although I leave out the poultry seasoning because I don't have that on hand.

I didn't eat it, (just a little taste), but family really likes it.  I used a can of low sodium beef broth and drained the canned mushrooms to get lower the sodium content a little.  Since I used beef broth I cut  back the milk to 1/2 cup.  It was a little lacking in flavor in the end so I stirred in a teaspoon of beef  Better Than Bouillion.  I served it over egg noodles.  I will make this one again.

i thought the patties tasted good. The gravy to me was bland. I used 1 1/2 cups milk and 1 1/2 cups beef stock. I also added beef base. I'm still trying to get the gravy to be not so bland. I just put everything in the crock pot and hopefully after it cooks more it will be good.

Great comfort food! I followed everything to a tee except i used freshed mushrooms. My family really enjoyed it! Great taste in the patties and gravy but next time ill use less flour because i like my gravy thin, it came out to be really thick  and ill definately double the gravy!

We found this to be very bland.  I only changed two things, I substituted beef stock for half the milk since I hate boullion cubes and will not buy them, and I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I don't think the changes were the problem.  It was adequate, but not the comfort food I was looking for. Definitely not "scrumptious".

Really great flavor in the sauce. I think I will try to decrease the milk next time and use half water. I agree that the fresh mushrooms make it. I did have to cook my patties for almost 20-25 mins. I don't think they were over sized either. When I did the suggested time, I noticed red juice leaking into the white gravy. Kind of lost my appetite but, that really never lasts long for me! Husband and kids liked it. Thanks!

This is a great recipe that sticks to the ribs on a cold winter day. My family loves it. Because I felt it was a little too rich for me, the second time I made it, I split the milk up with water and added some gravy master, only because I like dark gravy with a tinch of sugar to bring out the flavor and it was simply delicous.  Thanks for sharint.

Wonderful recipe. So easy to make! However, I drained the mushrooms before using them and instead of ground beef I used spicy sausage. It was just the right amount of spice/salt ratio. I served it over egg noodles. Will be making this again.

I was looking for a different recipe to use up some ground venison - this was a perfect one. I increased the ingredients to compensate for my 3 pounds of ground venison, and completed cooking in a deep dish in the oven since hubby was late coming home. It was a delicious meal!

Very good.  Is a bit too salty though, for my taste, and I leave out the onion (since neither husband or I like onions).  But added some minced onion from the seasonings.  I've made this several times.  I do add some cornstarch to gravy b/c it is too thin.

Well, I was somewhat disappointed. The gravy was very thin. I had to take some out and add more flour in order to have gravy for the potatoes. The flavor wasn't that good. Maybe the mistake I made was instead of making (6), I made three. Didn't think that would make a difference. But, maybe. Will use fresh mushrooms also if I make it again. Not sure what happened. Especially after reading all the good comments.

This is a yummy recipe although I used onions instead of mushrooms. I'm definitely going to make it again!

Among the best Salisury Steak dishes I've had. Minor changes based on others' input;  Added 1.5 tsp Worstershire to meat mixture before frying.   Used fresh sliced shrooms.   Used lean gound beef.   Reduced milk from 2 C. to 1.5 C and added cream of mushroom soup.

Didn't have milk, so used cream of mushroom with garlic instead.  Still completely delicious.

Very good.  I haven't had salisbury steak that good since high school.  The things that I change was the cracker crumbs ( I used bread crumbs) and the poultry seasoning ( I used the meat seasoning).  The gravy was good, but I made it too thick.  But overall the food was good.

I made this for dinner and even though I got strange looks from the family they all ate and eyjoyed it. I also opted to use half milk and half beef broth. I also adding a little cooking sherry and was great. Was a nice change of pass with stuff you probally half on hand. I severed with noodles and broccoli.

Loved it but used cream of mushroom soup being that we are not a fan of mushrooms.  Added a little extra milk.  Passed the recipe on to friends.  Was a Big hit with everyone even the kids.

Really excellent & hearty homestyle meal! I modified this after reading some reviews & it turned out great.  My husband said it's one of his new favorites! Here's what I changed: used 1 1/2 c. of milk and about a tablespoon and a half of beef bullion powder (didn't have granules), 2 1/2 tbsp. butter and 2 tbsp. flour, added 1 can cream of mushroom at the end, and added a dash of garlic powder with the other seasonings.  I also used crushed saltines instead of breadcrumbs, which was excellent.  Loved the poultry seasoning flavor in this! The texture of the beef patties was excellent - not too firm, but not mushy soft.  The sauce was so thick that I simmered it with a lid on for most of the time.  Might cut back on bullion next time or eliminate the added salt b/c it was pretty salty.  But still outstanding flavor & a keeper for sure!

I thought my boyfriend was going to ask me to marry him right after he took the first bite. What a great recipe.  The ony thing I did change was to sautee onions and mushrooms before adding cooking the "steaks".  I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup and it was wonderful!  Definitely would recommend this. My bf wouldn't let me throw out the remaining gravy.....he wants me to make mashed potatoes tonight so he can eat the rest of it!

I followed this recipe and unfortunately it was not so scrumptious - my kids didn't like it and they are greedy so it didn't work for us.  I ate it but I know I put a little too much poultry seasoning in it but it still should've been good.  I think the steak was ok but the gravy was not good at all - it might've worked if I made my own gravy from the oil instead of the milk - just didn't work.  I give it a 3 out of 5.

To be honest, I have not made the Salisbury Steak part of this recipe. My husband's family are vegetarians and we wanted a nice gravy to go with a nut roast recipe we found on this site. The gravy was AMAZING!!! We have used it several times since and each time we just pour it over EVERYTHING on our plates. I would eat it just by itself!

Perfect recipe! My husband, and 1 year old loved it!!!  I used ground oats instead of ritz, and a tad extra salt to compensate. Delicious, moist, and somewhat healthful salisbury steak was the result. I have already made this twice. This is a fantastic budget friendly meal with mashed potatoes, and a welcomed bit of variety from traditional hamburger recipes.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I disliked Salisbury steak growing up, but this is wonderful. If your short on time, just use your favorite hamburger patties in this sauce.

I make this with lots of fresh mushrooms and diced onions, sauteed with the beef patties.  Also, when sprinkling flour onto mushroom/oinion mixture, I also sprinkle a little beef boullion powder to make it a little 'beefier'.  My kids love when I make this dish, total comfort food.

This was delicious. I did make it with fresh sliced button mushrooms as the canned ones remind me of what I think slugs would feel and taste like lol. I also sauteed a little onions with the mushrooms. My husband tells me I can make this one again.

I love this recipe and so does everyone in my family (including my three year old, who asked for seconds AND wanted leftovers the next night).  I get off of work at six, so during the week I like making dinner that doesn't take an hour to cook but is delicious.  This fits perfectly!  It's very easy to make and I can have dinner on the table in 30 minutes..  Just make sure you keep stirring the gravy.  I use Adoba seasoning in place of poultry seasoning, bread crumbs instead of crackers (no patience on my part to crush crackers) and use dehydrated minced onion.  I keep the patties on the shorter cook side and to keep them warm, I put them on a plate with a paper towel and store them in the microwave (about the only thing my microwave gets used for) while I make the gravy.  I passed this along to one of my best friends, who loved it so much she told me to just give her my recipe collection for Christmas.  Also, I rarely use a recipe that I don't tweek to some extent.  The modifications I mentioned above are minimal at best, especially for me, but I basically stick to this recipe exactly.  Try this recipe.  You won't be dissappointed.

Wonderful. Like some other reviewers, I sauteed about 6 oz of fresh mushrooms in oil instead of using canned ones; for the gravy, I used about 1 cup of milk and 2/3 cup of chicken broth instead of beef bouillon, and i added about 1 Tbsp of cornstarch to thicken it up. I served it with some angel hair pasta. I will make this again, it was delicious.

This was really good! I did not drain the grease and only used half the butter. I did add onion to the mushrooms and the meat, I also did half the amount of milk and a can of beef broth. Oh I used regular saltine crackers because that is what I had.

We love this recipe! I followed the recipe exactly as it is written and it turned out wonderful. The rich, creamy texture to the gravy is excellent. This Salisbury steak is the perfect comfort food with mashed potatoes on the side! I have added this to our families regular meal rotation. Thanks so much for submitting this recipe! :)

This was fantastic, my first time making it and it turned out great. Nothing gourmet, but a nice home-cooked meal. I followed the directions with the "steaks" but also added a tsp of worcestershire and a tsp of steak sauce. I used fat-free salt-free saltines. For my gravy, I had a can of beef gravy, added the 2 cans of mushrooms, added about 1/3 of a can of cream of mushroom soup, which made it taste way too much like that soup. So I opened up a pack of Lipton's Onion/Mushroom packet mix and poured about 1/2 of that packet in. It was too strong, so I poured in the potato water I had from making mashed potatoes. It ended up turning out perfectly. I will definitely make this again.

This was very good. Not like the salisbury steak you get in a frozen dinner. The gravy is really creamy. I will definitely make this again.

You guys make me look better and better by the day!! My husband expressed earlier that he doesn't really like salisbury steak and he thinks of TV dinners when he thinks of it but I had him surprised! I am so happy I stumbled on this recipe, it's great. I've never had my gravy come out that good. I followed this recipe to the T and I will be using it again.

this was a great low budget recipe. i used ground venison instead of ground beef and it turned out great. i also added a touch of dijon and worcestershire to the gravy. there was plenty of extra sauce to serve w/ mashed potatoes

This was very good.  Some of the reviews said it was too salty but I ended up adding a little more salt and pepper at the end.  I followed the recipe exact but plan on using some of the reviewers suggestions next time.  This one is a keeper - I had no idea salisbury steak was so easy!  Thanks for sharing!

My husband really enjoyed this Salisbury steak.  I liked the fact that it used a homemade gravy instead of a condensed soup base.  I followed several reviewers' suggestions:  added a dash of Worcestershire Sauce to the meat and to the gravy, drained the mushrooms (used only 1 can), and added sliced onions to the gravy with the mushrooms.  I also added a little salt and pepper to the gravy, and reduced the milk to 2 1/2 cups so it would thicken a little faster.

Very good - my five year old son who normally will not eat any sort of gravy really enjoyed this and made a point to let me know several times - my husband commented on the meal alot - saying he liked this one better than the other recipe that I normally use - and that the gravy was REALLY good - I guess its a keeper

This was good, but the poultry seasoning taste in the steak was a bit much for my family.  Next time, I will use half.

Yum!!! I'd make it again. Took the advice of another review and used 2 cans of golden mushroom, 1 can of french onion, and fresh mushrooms in place of the gravy recipe listed here. Faster and very tasty. I love that I didn't have to bake it.

Very delicious but very salty. I think it might have been because of the bouillon cubes though. We increased the serving size to 16 and aside from being salty, everyone loved it. 
I think next time, I'll try using a condensed beef broth with reduced sodium, in place of the the cubes. Perfect with mashed potatoes.

This was the first time I ever made Salisbury Steaks and my hubby and his brother's loved it!!! We do not eat beef so we substituted it with ground turkey, I added about 3 dashes of garlic powder, doubled the poultry seasoning and the black pepper, added 3 dashes of onion powder and I also used McCormicks Mushroom Gravy mix, two packets made as directed except I substituted one cup of water with chicken broth, added 1/4 cup all-purpose flour and about 1/4 cup of butter to gravy, simmered it and then poured into drained skillet with steaks, let simmer another 10 minutes and mmmmm good!!!

I was a bit skeptical about the flavor after I cooked it, in fact, I wouldn't eat it right away. However, the next day we did have it for dinner and it was really good. I also fixed this for a friend and she thought it was a great comfort food. I guess I will be fixing this again. However, I think I will use fresh mushrooms next time. I did make changes based on previous reviews.

I really didn't like this recipe too much but my husband did, which is why I'm rating it in the middle. To me, the meat tasted like breakfast sausage and the gravy just tasted like cream of mushroom soup. I will continue my search for a good salisbury steak and gravy recipe.

I followed other reviews and used 2 cups of milk.  This still made tons of gravy and the consistency was perfect.  I also added an extra cube of bouillon because the gravy was too lightly colored.  The gravy tasted great with it but I can't say it woudn't have been just as good without.  This is going into our regular rotation for sure!

I also used fresh mushrooms in place of the canned and used beef stock to sub for the liquid in the canned mushrooms. It was excellent! A little tedious, but worth it.

This turned out pretty good, although I do think I prefer more of a beef based gravy.  I only used 2 cups of milk and felt that was still too much.  I also added in about 1/4 cup of beef broth, and some Italian style breadcrumbs to the patties because they seemed too wet.  Thanks for the recipe!

I fixed according to recipe with only one change, I drained the mushrooms!! It was very good but not 4 or 5 stars,it could be with some changes as the reviews say. The thing I like is that if you do not have canned or dried soup available you can make this and it can be doctored up :):)

GOOD!  This was very tasty.  I used whole wheat flour and skim milk to try to keep it a little healthy, and it was great.  My husband still talked about the gravy this morning!  Thanks for sharing

SCUMPTIOUS INDEED!  I doubled the recipe.  Added worcestershire and liquid smoke to the meat.  Made my own mushroom brown gravy (2 cans golden mushroom soup, 1 can french onion soup and 1 can milk).  Saute fresh mushrooms, add the soups and milk.  I won't look any further for my salisbury steak recipe!!!!!!  Thank you so much!!!!!!!!!

This recipe was to die for!  My family are very picky eaters and I didn't have a drop leftover!  I added worsheshire sauce to the hamburger mix for extra flavor and didn't use beef boullion cubes - used beef broth instead.  Fried them, then baked them in 350 degree oven for about 30 min. and they came out great!  Also used cream of mushroom soup in the gravy mixture.  
Will defitely add this recipe to our family dinner rotation!

This was my first time eating & preparing salisbury steak.  I just wasn't impressed.  Too much work for a glorified beef patty.

I left out the mushrooms because I didn't have any. The gravy looked really unappetizing, so I wasn't too sure about it. Luckily, it tasted much better than it looked! I went back for seconds to find out my family of 4 had emptied the pan (and I made a double batch!!!)! I will try this again, but may be with a brown gravy!

This was really good. My whole family loved it. I used fresh mushrooms and I also added about a tbsp of flour and the gravy thickened up nicely. I also used extra large bullion cubes.

Pretty good. My only change was that I used ground pork (sister's boyfriend works at a hog refinery, so we get free pork), which was surprisingly tasty.  My only "disappointment" was the gravy, for a few reasons.  1) Didn't thicken up as well as I would've liked (next time I'll use 2 cups milk); 2) Didn't have much flavor (next time I'll add worchestershire to the meat patties and Kitchen Bouquet to the sauce); and 3) it makes a LOT of gravy (but this should be solved by cutting down on the milk).  Otherwise a good recipe that I will continue to use with modifications.  Thanks!

Really good!  I changed it up a little- added some worchestershire sauce and some regular spicy brown mustard to the beef mixture.  To do the sauce I used a can of cream of mushroom and thinned it with beef broth and I finished everything in the oven- 375 for about 40 mins- loosely tented with foil.  These were excellent!  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Who knew that salisbury steak could be THIS good?  I will definitely make this again-DH and my mom liked it (although the 3 year old wouldn't touch it!)  Thanks!!

Great for the most part!  I do this all of the time, but I used to use a pre-made packet gravy.  Never again will I use one, they are full of chemicals and bad stuff for you.  So what I changed was I used fresh onions and mushrooms.  I sauteed them.  Instead of milk and beef cubes I used organic, low sodium chicken broth from a box. I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef. To compliment it I used homemade mashed potatoes and fresh steamed broccoli. Oh, I also didn't use the poultry seasoning.  I used organic crackers as well.

Really good. I used fresh mushrooms, sauteed the onions like others said to do and then added them to the patties, a little red wine (will use more next time). My  sauce did not thicken like I wanted it to but was still very good. Served with mashed potatoes and corn. I made 4 burgers with the meat...

When your looking for something different....this is the recipe. I haven't had a good salisbury steak in a very long time. This recipe hit the spot. And for the kids .....what goes better with a burger patty than baked french fries?........NOTHING. Fries is the way to go. Thanks for the great recipe.      ...HEAVY...

This is really tasty although I made a few changes.   I didn't like the appearance of the creamy gravy so instead of bouillon cubes and milk, I used 3 cups of boiling water to 3 teaspoons of beef soup base.  I also added dry mustard and worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture.  I do not use canned mushrooms so I sauteed 8 ounces of fresh mushrooms.  And I used fresh bread crumbs because I didn't have the crackers on hand.  Delicious comfort food!

My husband and son are meat and potato men! We all loved this, I let mine simmer longer than 10 min to make the gravy thicker. With the seasoning you put with the meat it needs no salt or pepper! YUMMY! I will definately make this again, comfort food and cheap to make! :)

This is my new comfort food go-to.  I followed the recipes except for using fresh mushrooms and making my gravy differently (by eyeballing it and no boullion).  I serve this with simply potatoes mashed potatoes, frozen corn and some garden peas.  Pure heaven!

My husband and son loved this. They really liked the gravy. It was pretty easy to make. I am not a mushroom fan so I ate it without the gravy and it was still yummy. The buttery crackers make it really rich and yummy. Good old fashioned, inexpensive, comfort food.  Thanks.

I thought this was a 3. My son thought it was a 4. My husband thought it was a 5 so we compromised and gave this a 4.

End of pay period. No money for groceries.  Gotta make something with ingredients on hand (well, no poultry seasoning - whatever that is).  Recipe of the day comes in.  What a wonderful surprise.  It tasted scrumptious and was perfect for the chilly weather we had that night.  My husband even said it was as good as his Mom's (quite the compliment!).  Definitely will make this again - though for comfort food nights only - the cholesterol must've been through the roof!

good stuff. I think it won't come out too salty if you omit some of the shroom juice and obviously add less salt to it. It was not too runny as others said. It came out just the right consistancy. Just keep the flour handy incase you feel it is to runny. Good stuff though.

The flavors were interesting, and I liked the sauce, but I thought there was something lacking.  Next time I am going to try real steak (instead of meatloaf type patties) and fresh mushrooms instead of canned.

This was good.  But not 5 stars good.  The other reviews said the gravy didn't come out very thick.  Mine did.  So I suggest following this recipe for the grvy.  My boyfriend LOVED this meal.  So I'll make it again.  I think next time I will try making the patties a little more thin.  They had too much of a "hamburger" taste.  I felt like I was eating hamburgers with gravy.

What a dish! And, a very creative thing to do with a burger patty! It really hit the spot with the chilly wind blowing outside. I deleted the salt though, cos with the cracker crumbs and butter, that's all the salt I need.  That gravy would go great with eggs in the morning!

It was good, but hamburger is hamburger. The gravy was delicious. I used fresh 'shrooms and substituted a can of beefy mushroom for one cup of milk. I did not add any salt to recipe b/c i did use the canned soup and it was plenty unless you are a saltaholic. Served over rice and my 2 year old loved it. Will make again, but maybe next time try beef tips.

This has a great taste and is easy to prepare.  However we think it should only use 2 C. of milk, as 3 makes way too much. We also prefer a little more salt.  Serves well with Tater-Tots.

The sauce never turns into a gravy! The recipe calls for way too much milk. It's very runny and spreads all over your plate. It is tasty but, I would never use this recipe again.

We enjoyed these patties immensely.  They were very filling without adding breadcrumbs as a filler as most recipes do.  There was lots of gravy and was great with mashed potatoes.  My new favorite way of making hamburgers!!

Oh my goodness, was this good! My fiance has asked if we can now have it once a month. I was pleasantly surprised at how much gravy it made, but it was a bit thin. I will add the milk more gradually next time. I added a bit more onion and some Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. Next time I might add a bit of garlic powder to the patties. I served it over rice and it was perfect. Lots of leftovers, too.

Quick and easy recipe (hubby cooked last night).  We both wished the gravy was more beef-y and thicker too.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  This isn't a dish I'd normally prepare/eat (not sounding snobby, promise!), so I let my husband do the reviewing.

The first time Ive made salisbury steak and it turned out absolutely delicious!!A real comfort food.  I used aeromat seasoning instead of poultry and added a some seasoning salt to the ground beef and grilled using the George Forman. I didnt make the gravy from scratch like the recipe sugests,I sauteed fresh mushrooms instead of canned and added that to a brown gravy made from a package.  Next time I'll  make two packages of gravy.  I served this over egg noodles.  Definatley a new family favorite

My oldest son wanted shrimp for dinner for his birthday and since only he and I will eat it, I decided to try this for the rest of the family.  My husband gave it a 3 star rating telling me that it was okay, but nothing special.  My daughter and youngest son both didn't eat theirs (but they're not big fans of ground beef).  I tasted it and thought it was a little salty like another reviewer said but okay in texture.  I don't think I'll be making this one again.  Thanks, though.

even though it was really salty...I will be making this again. I started to only use one cup of milk with one boullion cube but the gravy was way to salty I had to add more milk. Next time I will use unsalted butter and beef broth maybe that will cut back on the saltyness. Other then that it was really good. My picky 2 year old ate it up which is rare since he never eats meat unless its chicken fingers.

This was a yummy, tasty recipe.  I've made several varieties of salisbury steaks ~ my favorite is using condensed cream of mushroom soup (a less work as far as making the "gravy".   But I did make it this time..using canned beef broth (not boullion) with half the amount of milk (adding a bit more if necessary to get the right consistency).  Overall, it's a really good recipe.

We just finished having this for dinner.  I'm sorry to say...WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH...lol.  They couldn't get enough of it. I needed something quick to go with the Au Gratin potatoes I made from here last night. This was it.  Hubby says it's a keeper.
