This is a good, basic pot pie recipe, that can be altered to suit one's individual tastes. I increased frozen peas to 1 cup, as well as 1/2 cup each of celery and carrots, as I felt it needed more veggies. I added 1/4 cup of wine and a splash of Worcestershire sauce, as well as salt and pepper for a bit more flavor. I also used frozen pie crusts (defrosted of course!) and brushed a beaten egg white on the top before baking, which makes a nice golden, flaky crust. I didn't have the time to wait an hour for it to cool, so after cooking the filling, added the cheese right away and immediately put the pie in the oven. It turned out great! One of our favorite quick meals!

Very good recipe. However 325 degrees is too low a temp. for a golden brown crust. Should be 375 for 30 mins.

This was great! If you add a little extra cornstarch and turn the heat up  just a little bit (to about medium high) you dont have to let it sit for 45 minutes.The extra heat with the extra cornstarch make it thicken in just a few minutes.  Make sure to keep stiring while the heat is turned up so you dont burn anything.

This is a great recipe!  I now quadruple the recipe, using 4 cups of whatever vegetables I have, and use Pillsbury pie crusts for the top only.  I bake only one and freeze the remaining three.  I have taken these to friends after having babies, and all have asked for the recipe. Thanks for sharing Chris.

Good recipe. Be sure to cook long enough. Do not place on an insulated cookie sheet because it keeps it from browning and cooking properly,

Wonderful recipe! There was an awkward moment when I was raving about it and my mom asked if it was better than hers.  She insisted I make it for her so she could see for herself, and she loved it too!  I did make a few changes, I increased the veggies to 1 cup each and used potatoes instead of celery.  I also increased the chicken to 1 1/2 cups.  Rather than waiting 5 min to thicken I just increased the temp instead, and I didn't wait an hour for it to cool, I added the cheese and poured it into the pie shell immediately.  Yum!

I love this pot pie.  As a former Wisconsinite.. I love cheese. :)  This pie was easy and tastes great.  I use Pillsbury pie crusts for this recipe, as my homemade crusts don't usually turn out all that well.  I baked the bottom crust for about 15 mins and 325 so that it won't be soggy after the chicken mixture is put in.  This is a very nice recipe because you can add/substitute different veggies.  (My kids don't like celery)  Thanks!

I don't understand how that one reviewer said this isn't a "real chicken pot pie". She/he must've been jealous that this was someone else's recipe! I made this for dinner tonight. I usually just make the quick Bisquik recipe for pot pie, but I'm pregnant and making recipes to freeze for when the baby comes. THIS IS DELICIOUS! I love cheese in anything. I didn't know if my hubby would, but the two of us ate 90% of it for our dinner! I followed this recipe exactly except for using frozen beggies and thought it had extra zip with the cheese. This recipe is quick, easy, and tastes like it took hours. It's very filling and I will definitely make more of this and pass the recipe onto my friends! GOOD JOB!

Followed the suggestions to up the veggies, used 1 cup peas, and 1/2 cup each of celery and carrots.  Would add a little more cornstarch next time, as it turned out a little too soupy for my taste.  Also followed the suggestion to bake at 375 for 30 min. - came out perfectly golden brown on top!  Will def. make again, with a little tweaking to suit our own personal tastes.  Thanks for the great recipe, Chris!  :)

This turned out wonderfully well with just a couple of adjustments.  I had to cook the chicken, so I boiled a chicken breast in a couple cups of veggie stock I had in the fridge, letting it reduce to 1-1/2 cups before I added the veggies.  I didn't want to wait an hour for the mixture to cool before putting it in the pie shell, so I baked the bottom shell about 8 minutes before adding the filling (without cheese), spreading the cheese on top and stirring lightly.  I put the top crust on and baked as directed, increasing the temperature to 350 near the end to get a bit of browning.  The sauce is flavorful and just thick enough, and the crust is flaky on both top and bottom.  Delicious!

Really good recipe that I have made about 20 times now. This is something that can be mixed together quickly with a bag of frozen vegetables and some Velveeta or can really have that homemade flavor with a good pie crust recipe and some freshly cut vegetables.  I have done both and both turned out good.  Use the Grandma Ruth Pie crust with this.  It will really bring out all of the flavors.

This was pretty good and easy to make. The only thing that really needs to be changed is the amount of filling, it wasn't nearly enough, if it wasn't for that I would have given it 5 stars. My boyfriend liked it and he normally doesn't like chicken pies of any kind.

This was my first time making this, so I made it as per the recipe (except for adding some additional carrot).  I thought it was great!  Rich and satisfying, and surprisingly filling due to the cheese.  I'm not sure the cheese added a lot of taste, but it certainly added that wonderful comforting richness.  Sweet and perfect.  I could imagine some onion and/or garlic added to it.  As another reviewer indicated, great base recipe.  Thanks!

Liked the idea of this recipe, thought, next time I'll leave the cheese out.  I love cheese, but it didn't really add too much to the dish, and since it's expensive I'll use it in other recipes instead!  Added some herbs and spices because I thought it would be bland otherwise.  Good base recipe, though!

I used a little more chicken broth than the recipe called for, and a lot more peas and carrots.  I also added salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  It turned out completely amazing; the cheese really made the difference.

Very good.  Big hit with my husband and two 5 year olds.  I used shredded canned chicken (2 cans) - much easier.  I also brush the crust with a beaten egg and cook 5 minutes before adding filling.  It helps keep it from getting soggy.  I also cooked at 375 for 30 minutes.  Perfect!!

I have made this recipe countless times and everyone loves it.  I usually make 6 or so at a time and freeze them for an easy go to meal.  The only change I make is I add potatoes and don't add celery.

I don't really like Chicken Pot Pie but this was Awesome!!!! The only thing I did different was to bake at 375* for about 30 to 35 mins and put foil on the edges for the last 15 mins of baking.(So not to burn the edges.) I will be making this for many yummy years to come!!!!!!!!!!!1

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't have stock, so I used broth and I added corn and some green onion.  My family enjoyed this and I will make it again.  Only thing is, it take longer than 45 minutes to bake- almost an hour, I would use the advise another reviewer gave and hike the heat to 375 and it will be quicker.

Not the usual dinner you'd make on a hot and humid summer evening, however, my daughter loves chicken pot pie and I already had the leftover chicken on hand. I didn't have any stock in the house, so I used cream of chicken soup instead. I too used only one crust and it was fine. Very delicious and Ty gave it a thumbs up Chris!

It was fine and fairly simple.  But it lacked any flavor whatsoever.  It needs salt/pepper and other seasonings.

YUM! Best pot pie recipe ever! Will def. make again, as requested by hubby. Felt it needed more veg so I added broccoli and mushrooms instead of peas (along with some pepper and garlic) and it was fantastic. Used Pilsbury refrig. dough to make it easier, and def. needs to bake longer than 35-35 min, mine was in almost an hour, maybe next time will up the temp a bit.

This was okay. It is easy enough but I just don't think its the right recipe for us. I found myself missing the more traditional taste of a chicken pot pie. I'm giving it 4 stars because as the recipe goes it is pretty good and easy, but like I said, not the one for us. So, thanks for posting.

I accidentally made two of these one night and used a only one serving of cheese and it still came out good!  My family made me swear in blood to make it again - thanks!

Wow!  Look no further... this chicken pot pie recipe is awesome!!!  We just had it for dinner tonight and my husband and I ate over half of it!  This is exactly that homemade pot pie taste I was looking for... I've never made pot pie before and was really blown away by the flavor.  The filling is so yummy I almost didn't bother putting it in a crust!  I tweaked the recipe a bit by adding diced potato... omitted the celery, used flour instead of cornstarch which worked fine... added more chicken (1 cup seemed skimpy), more veggies and a little more stock... and added seasonings: I recommend adding salt, pepper, onion powder, poultry seasoning (or sage and rosemary), parsley to taste... this really intensified the flavor (especially the poultry seasoning).  I also used frozen pie crusts to simplify things.  I wonder if the cheddar cheese was even necessary it was so tasty even before I added it, but I think it added that special "ooomph" for the recipe.  I will definitely be making this again and again! Thanks!

This recipe was super!! After reading reviews I baked the bottom crust for 10 minutes to prevent sogginess. I added diced potatoes and parsley and substituted corn for the peas. I made small cutouts from the top crust using mini cookie cutters instead of cutting slits in it to vent, then baked it at 350 instead of 325. Let it set for 15 minutes to firm up the filling before cutting. I doubled the recipe and froze a pie for my sister's family after the birth of her baby and her husband fell in love with this recipe. I'll be making this one for years to come!

This was good.  A few things though:  The bottom of my pie did not cook.  I used a glass pie plate so maybe that was the problem.  So next time I won't put it on the baking sheet.  Also, I had purchased chicken stock, but since I had boiled my chicken, I decided to use the actual chicken stock.  I realized later that because of this I should have added extra salt as mine was quite bland.  I think it could have used some more flavour.  Not sure what would work, maybe some garlic powder?  Also, I added some potatoes and instead of peas I used frozen corn.  You can really use any vegetables you want.  I would make this again.

Tried this last night, as written, with regards to my veggie combo-I used GG combo of corn, baby corn, broccoli and carrots, then added 4oz sliced mushrooms...I also added some spices, as I thought it was very bland.  Too Salty, even hubby noted that and he's a salt fiend....must've been the combo of chicken broth, mushrooms and cheese.  Will try again, but will use other reviewer tips---mainly use low salt cream of something soup or chicken gravy or even canned low salt chicken broth in place of the broth and sauteed fresh, sliced mushrooms.  It'll work, I'm sure.  Kids did love the cheese!

My husband, who loves cheese and crust, declared this fantastic!  I thought it was pretty good too.  I added one more cornstarch, vegies (including mushrooms) and cheese than the recipe stated.  Cooked it at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes.

My bottom crust turned out fine but for some reason I could hardly taste it so next time I will try what others say they do -- put a nice thick crust on top and forget the bottom.  Also I'll brush it with egg white to get it just a little browner.

Warm, wonderful goodness. I needed a recipe to use my chicken stock with and this popped out at me. Sadly, I didn't have any peas (how pathetic is that??) so I substituted potato, but I did have carrots and celery in the fridge. Next time I will use peas along with all the rest.  mmm, so very delicious!!

I have been looking for a good chicken pot pie recipe, and I decided to try this because the filling sounded good.  I did make some modifications based on my preferences.  I cut the chicken in cubes instead of shredding it, I added a little garlic powder to the filling, and I also added about half a can of low fat cream of chicken soup because it did not look as creamy as I like it after it cooled off.  Instead of using a double pie crust, I cut out a piece of puff pastry to cover the top and left the bottom crust free.  I did this because I had the puff pastry left over from another recipe.  Because of the crust change, I baked it at 400 degrees for about a half hour.  The pie turned out delicious, and I will definitely make it again.

This was quick and easy and a good way to use up leftover chicken. The only complaint I would have is that the insides were quite watery. While my children were quite happy with it, my husband mentioned it would have been nicer if the sauce was creamier. He suggested perhaps adding a bit of cream of chicken soup to it, so I might try that next time. But, as mentioned, it was quick, easy and emptied out a few containers of leftovers in our fridge! :-)

Wow! What a nice surprise! This recipe was so nice. Great comfort food! The cornstarch really is the key on this thing. I used 1 cup of frozen mixed veggies and then also cut up some celery and cubed some peeled potatoes and zapped them in the microwave and added to the mixture. I used left over Italian dressing marinaded chicken breasts cut up into one inch cubes. I only had chicken broth, not stock, so I put in approximately one TBS of granulated chicken bouillion with it. I baked my bottom pie crust first so it wouldn't become soggy. The cheese added some zing but I think next time we will try it without it. This had a nice thick consistency and I can't tell you how pleased I am to have found this recipe. I did have to bake it a bit longer than called for. I will never pay those high prices for store bought pot pies again! Thanks!

This is now one of my favorite recipes.  It is really delicious.  I have made it several times to take over to friends' for potluck.  I usually double the recipe, and use whatever variety of vegetables (often they are frozen) I have on hand.  It's a very adaptable recipe.  One other quick item -- I always use the Crisco can recipe for the crust.  Although I make a double crust recipe, I usually put a nice thick layer on just the top instead of dividing and putting one on the bottom.

This made good use out of some leftover chicken. It was good. Used a frozen pie crust. Had to cook it hotter and longer than the recipe said.

Loved it! I had to cook about 50 minutes, but it turned out much better than expected! Surprising amount of flavor for so few ingredients. I don't like carrots and celery in my pot pie, so I just used extra peas. Also used turkey instead of chicken.

I don't know if I should be giving this 5 stars only because I made so many changes.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken, frozen mixed veggies, a whole 8z block of shredded sharp chedder (we love cheese here), and made the bisqick top (1 cup bisquick, 1/2 cup milk, 1 egg 400 degrees for 30 minutes)  It was extremely quick and easy!  I would have like the traditional pie top, but I didn't have time to make it (*read to small children under my feet :o) ).  I did make the mistake of adding some milk to the final mixture because it looked too thick, but I should have left it alone. Mine was just a little too runny, but still delish.  My two year old LOVED it! Thanks

My family loves this recipe!  It's so easy to put together.  I use precooked packaged chicken and ready made pie crusts.  It's especially good with sharp cheddar.  I also add tarragon and black pepper.

I was known as a (not so good cook) until I made this pot pie. My family loves it and we have it once to twice a week. It is so yummy with the cheese and it always turns out perfect. Thank you for an excellent recipe.

This was a huge hit at our (usually buffet style, because no one likes the same thing)house!  I did not add peas, but put in frozen cubed potatoes like others and it turned out wonderfully! I also baked the bottom crust before. Thanks!!

I also justed used one crust (on top) and brushed it with egg whites.

I used frozen tart shells for this recipe. My husband and I think that this is the best pot pie we have ever had.
I had never heard of using cheese in a pot pie before. OMG, it made it taste even better. Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was a good dish, but for my family's taste I would only do a single pie crust on top and decrease the cheese by about half.  Otherwise really good- will make again with modifications.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I like others altered this or that.  I reduced the amount of liquid as suggested.  Mine was still not creamy.   I think I didnt let it cook long enough when I added the cornstarch.  Still was an excellent dinner.  I may make it with home made chicken gravy as a sauce next time. In whatever form I will use this recipe again.  The cheese was definatly a brilliant touch.  I love cheese.

Pretty good, next time maybe 1/2 an onion sauteed in a bit of butter to soften, then add the other ingredients. This might add some depth of flavor which I felt the recipie lacked.

Excellent, this is the second time I tried this.  I incorporated the many suggestions from fellow reviewers.  I used turkey (pre-cooked from a supermarket).  It was better than the last time.  Someone said this was a lot of work and they had a traditional chicken pot pie that tasted better and took 1/2 the time to cook.  I'd be curious to see that recipe and try it for comparison.  Although, if you leave out the cheese, it probably would be traditional.  It doesn't take much work my way - I use frozen peas and carrots and cream of chicken soup instead of stock.  I'll keep this one.

Great pot pie recipe! I added two heaping tablespoons of minced garlic (because I'm a garlic fanatic) as well as 1/3 cup corn and about a cup of leftover cubed potatoes. I increased the chicken stock by a cup, and doubled the milk and the cornstarch, as well as tossing in around 1/2 cup more chicken.. Just enough filling for a nice, round pie top!

LOVED THIS!  One of my boys ate half of it....I guess I have to make two next time.  I cut the cheese down to 1 cup and also added corn.  Baked it in a pie pan over a cookie sheet and it turned out fabulous.  I also baked the first crust for 10 minutes as reccommended by other users and baked it at 375 for 30 minutes without cooling the ingredients first.  A WINNER!

Excellent pot pie recipe!  I added some cubed potato and about 1/4 cup extra chicken broth and of course salt & pepper.  The cheese really gives this a wonderful flavor, but I think it would be just as good without it.  Thanks, Chris!

I made this recipe for a group of friends and my husband and they loved it!  It was definatly a keeper, however, I used low-sodium cream of chicken soup in place of the chicken stock, 1/2 the amount of cornstarch, added corn and cream cheese, as well as more celery, carrots, and chicken.  I also added black pepper and parsley to give it some flavor, and used both pastries for the crust and none on the bottom.  It is definatly something I will make again, it was a  hit!

A keeper! The cheese makes all the difference in this recipe. I did make a few changes... I added 3/4 can of Crm of Chicken, substituted small chunks of potato for the celery and used chicken broth instead of stock. Also, I didn't have any cornstarch, so I used flour. Great flavor!!

absolutely delicious!  My boyfriend loved it and can't wait until I make it again.  I also added cubed potatoes, chopped red onion, garlic, rosemary, oregano, cracked black pepper, parsley, an additional tablespoon of cornstarch, and substituted heavy cream for the milk & chicken stock for the broth.   I also shredded half a block of colby/monterey jack cheese instead of buying the pre shredded kind of cheese which can be on the dry side. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

excellent recipe! I couldn't find the crust in my grocery store, so I put the filling into a casserole dish and made up the dough for some mayonnaise biscuits and topped it with that, and it was perfect!

I loved this recipe-- I made it for my husband who loves pot pie and for my Mom's Club meeting dinner raffle!! I prepared it so it was ready with instructions how to bake.  Perfect for someone sick or who has had recently had a baby or anyone with little time to prepare healthy meals.  I made it even easier to make by buying the roasted chicken from the grocery store and shredding that.

A good way to use leftover chicken.  Added a wee bit more cornstarch, baked as directed but let pie set for 15-20 minutes out of oven.  Contents remained firm and delicious.

We liked this pot pie, thank you for the recipe. 

Made a couple of revisions based upon personal preference: for the veggies I only used one bag of frozen Steamfresh mix of broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, instead of the listed vegetables as we're not keen on peas & celery.

Also added one can of cream of chicken soup to make it thicker & creamier, as the mixture seemed too runny even after cooking it with the cornstarch as directed. 

Served it with a bed of wild rice and a side of green beans with French's fried onions, good side dishes alongside.

Very good , I did add a small onion and garlic powder. Prebaked the bottom crust and that worked out well. Also did bake in a 375 degree oven. Forgot to add the cheese, but still good.

I used this recipe as a start because I wanted to add cheese to a chicken pie, but it seemed to be lacking a lot of veggies, and other ingredients that add flavor.  So, I did cook the bottom shell @ 375 as recommended by others.  I also added frozen corn, about 1/4 cup of finely diced onions, 1 red potato finely diced (so they wouldn't be hard) and salt and pepper to the filling mixture, and just added the cheese into the hot mixture (after the milk/cornstarch). I brushed the top w/an egg wash and baked at 375 for 25 minutes.  It turned out really good!  Wasn't at all runny, and my mother, who's a bit picky and doesn't particularly like chicken pot pie, had two pieces!  Woohoo!!!

This pot pie was easy and turned out good.  To suit our tastes, I replaced the celery with corn kernels.  The meat I used was the leg and thigh meat of a rotisserie chicken.  I did find the filling to be kind of bland so I added some salt, pepper, and garlic powder to liven it up.

This was really flavorful...merienda yesterday was a great bonding! This is now officially my favorite chicken pastry recipe next to Chicken Croissants which I found in GourmetRecipe's website. I love it as my kids do!

I really like this recipe. I changed it up a bit though. I increased peas to 1 cup. Also I chopped up about 5 green onions and added it and increased cheese to 2 cups. I completely omitted celery because I dont like celery. As per another user's suggestion here seasoned with salt and pepper and added 1/4 cup  white wine and used frozen pie crusts and a frozen pastry sheet for the top. The white wine really added flavor This pot pie is delicious!

This was very very good. The only reason
I didn't give it 5 stars is because it
was so oozy. I let it sit for about 20 
minutes before serving it and still turned into a puddle on the plate. It was very delicious though. I will make it again and maybe add more cheese to try and "tighten" it up a bit

A very good, basic pot pie recipe. I added some diced blanched potatoes to mine, as well. The family liked it, too.

My DH said..."Woman...you must make this again!" LOL When he starts talking "caveman" you know it's good! I omitted the cheese and added some seasoning salt. I may try crumbling cooked cornbread over the top instead of the top pie crust for variation next time. Thanks so much for a GREAT recipe

I left out the celery, added in some garlic powder, black pepper and some fresh parsley as I had some in the fridge to use up. This was a good way to use leftover chicken. I will use again. Thanks.

I served this at a dinner party and made each guest an individual mini pot pie in an oven-safe bowl.  I just filled each bowl and criss-crossed strips of dough to make a top crust.  I also added a little extra sharp cheddar cheese.  Everyone loved it!  I doubled the recipe to serve 6 people and thought I was making a ton of food, but there was barely enough to go around.  I would recommend making more than you think you'll need if you serve it this way.

I like this recipe because it is so versatile. You can use whatever veggies you like and that's great. I used leftover "Roast Chicken with Rosemary" from this site, and it was delicious. True comfort food.

Great pot pie!  I followed someone else's advice and cooked the bottom crust for about 15 minutes before adding the filling.

Wow this is really good.  Unfortunately I forgot to put the cheese in before I put the top crust on so I had to put the cheese on our pieces after it was cooked.  It gave me a pretty good idea on how it would have tasted if I had it right.  I’m definitely making it again hopefully with the cheese in this time. Thank You!

Having tried this recipe before, I LOVED it!  Upon making it a second time, I realized I was out of milk, which is one of the required ingredients.  So, upon my husband's recommendation, I substituted the milk with the same amount of sour cream.  The end result was totally divine, and added a truly interesting twist!

I quadrupled this recipe to make 4 pies at once for the freezer.  Deboned a roasted deli chicken and used two large cans of homestyle (chunky) vegall, drained.  The pie tastes good, but it is more runny than my regular quick chicken pot pie.  The cheese is a good idea and tastes good in the pie, but next time I'll add it to my regular recipe.

I used left over grilled chicken, 2 cans of veg all and 1 can of chicken broth to save time.  This recipe made a great chicken pot pie I just wish the filling was a little thicker, however that may have been due to some of the changes I made. Will definitly make again. Thanks

This is a really good winter time meal.  I doubled the recipe to make two...it worked out well.  I added plenty of salt and pepper to it, I think it would be rather bland without extra pepper.  I also used chicken broth instead or stock and cooked mine almost an hour to get the crust done.  Good recipe...thanks!

My husband loved this recipe!  I did not get to try it because he ate the whole thing himself!!  I substituted corn for the peas, added onion, diced red potatoes, and I didn't have any celery so I used broccoli instead and added some garlic powder.  I had to cook a little longer than stated but it turned out perfect!  I will defintely make it again and hopefully I will get some this time!!

This recipe was just o.k.  Of course I changed it up so that could have something to do with it.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of the chicken stock and combined with the cheese found it to be way too rich.  Also very salty.  I think I may try it again without the cheese and maybe a low sodium soup.

Very good.  I too make this with the double crust on top.  Sometimes for an extra kick, I add some wine to the sauce while cooking.

This was just okay.  I used a single crust on the top.  It never browned nicely and looked rather bland coming out of the oven.  I'm not sure if I'll try this one again.

This recipe was very good.  I really liked the cheese in it.  My husband
went back for seconds.  My 6 yr old liked it, but it was not a winner for my
2 year old.  But I will make this one again.

How fun to make your own pot pie! Leftover baked chicken from the night before and almost all ingredients from my pantry made this a yummy, fun, cost effective alternative to boring leftovers. I would make this again, and again even when I don't have nearly everything on hand.

This was the first time I had ever made a home made Chicken Pot Pie. It was delicious!! It was a bit time consuming, but it was well worth the wait. I too am a cheese fan, so that was great! Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will definatly be using it again!

Very tasty. I used frozen mixed vegetables, it worked well. Better day#2 because it thickened a little more. Will make again. May try making my own pie crust.

I had left over turkey and put this together quickly using frozen veggies and a few potatoes, which I sauteed with some onion and minced garlic before combining with the sauce.  Mine turned out a bit on the dry side which probably was my error in making the sauce more like gravy.  Next time I will try for a thinner sauce.  The flavor was delicious and everyone enjoyed the cheesy turkey pot pie.  I will be making this one again.

This did not turn out great, the filling was watery and cooking it at 325 is too low. I would not make again and I did follow the recipe, exactly.

Love this recipe!  It's a go-to recipe for after Thanksgiving turkey leftovers.  I add onions and use up leftover veggies from the veggie tray.  Sometimes bake in a dish with biscuit dough on top instead of making pie.

This was really good but I did make a couple changes. First I cooked the bottom shell for a few minutes before filling it so it wouldn't be doughy. I added more starch and it took only a few minutes to thicken. I also added more chicken, veggies and I added onions. I think next time I will also turn up the heat cause at 325 it took forever for mine to cook. Otherwise Very yummy.... a new family favorite!

This recipe required too much time for a pot pie. I can make a traditional pie that taste better in half the time. Maybe all the rave reviews are from people who never tasted a real chicken pot pie.

Awesome recipe! Seems to be tailor made for leftover chicken. To cut down prep time I used canned peas and carrots. I also increased the heat to 350. This is one of my boyfriend's all-time favorites.

My husband and I really enjoyed this delicious chiken pot pie.  I'm already thinking about making it with left over roast beef.  I made a short cut out of it by using a can of no salt added veg all and mushroooms would be an added delight!  Reheated very well -- will definately serve this to guests.

This pot pie is excellent. I made a few changes to the recipe, though. I used frozen vegetables. I had a mixture of corn, carrots, lima beans, green beans, potatoes, and celery (fresh). These were so easy to make. I cooked them thoroughly and then froze them for convineince. WHAT A GREAT RECIPE. Thanks for sharing chris!

This was good.  Next time, I would definately soften the celery in butter to eliminate the crunchiness.  I added lots of pepper and a little poultry seasoning--the flavor was great! I used cream of chicken instead of chicken broth as previously suggested; was very creamy.  Tasty!

This is the best pot pie I've ever made. My husband and 3y/o loved it (and they are a very hard crowd to please.)  It was so easy!  I didn't use as much cheese and I added potatoes and it was still good.  I had it for breakfast this morning!

I doubled the chicken and upped the quantity of everything but the liquids.  Added salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Like another review did, I didn’t use a crust on the bottom and laid a puff pastry sheet on top.  Baked at 400 for 30 min.  Turned out perfectly.  Just delicious!

Like the other reviews this is a very good base. I add garlic, parsley,salt,pepper and diced potatoes.  I was looking for a pot pie that did not use canned soup and I found it. Will use this again. Thanks for the post.

I will definitely make it again. My husband doesn't like peas so I didn't add those. I kept everything else the same. Very Good and easy to make.

I altered it quite a bit. I boiled chicken breasts and cut into chunks. I used cream of chicken, cream of celery, and canned mixed veggies seasoned with salt, garlic powder, minced onion, and black pepper. In a large mixing bowl, I mixed all ingredients, generously added shredded sharp cheddar cheese, stirred in chicken seasoning, then folded in the chicken chunks. My family enjoyed every bit of it!

Yummy!  Of course I made it my way.  Isn't that the point?  I used frozen mixed vegi's and fresh celery.  I used 1.5 cups of medium white cheddar cheese and an additional half a cup of Trader Joes three cheese shaved cheese that I had left over from a lasagna I made.  I did not let the mixture cool for an hour and it worked fine.  I also added an egg white brushing across the top to make the crust flakey.  Next time I will add mushrooms.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. It took a long time to prepare and had very little flavor. It thickened up fine and I added some potato. This would have been great if it had some flavor.

Awesome!  Chicken pot pie is good enough by itself, but when you add the cheese, it's even better!

YUMMY! I added canned sliced potatoes to the pie, and used fresh vegetables.  This pie was so creamy and delicious that I decided never to go back to store bought pies!

I was looking for a recipe that I could use legs & thighs with - this was perfect.  I had a lot of leftover chicken, so I guessed at the proportions to modify, but used a small bag of frozen mixed veggies, a deep dish pie crust(s), and it turned out great.

I really liked this recipe.  I did a bay leaf when the broth was simmering.  I also added some parsley to the recipe.  And I cheated by using frozen pie crusts.  Very good!

Fabulous!  This was so delicious!  I made it with left-over BBQ chicken that I had grilled the night before.  The BBQ flavor was a nice touch.  This would be an excellent company meal.

My family loved this recipe.  My 6 year old daughter asked for seconds!  Very easy and so delicious.  I agree the cheese makes the pie!  I added potatoes too.  Thanks for the great dinner!

This was a great pot pie recipe.   I substituted potatoes, broccoli, and onions in place of the peas (hubby won't eat peas).   He loves pot pies and cheese so this was a real winner in his book!  This is a very tasty pot pie recipe and I highly recommend it to anyone in the mood for some good, warm comfort food.

This recipe was delicious!!!!  I used sliced swiss cheese instead of cheddar and it came out great.  I also added potatoes and used cream of chicken soup instead of chicken stock.  That made the recipe quick and easy!  Even my 9 month son loved it!!!!!
