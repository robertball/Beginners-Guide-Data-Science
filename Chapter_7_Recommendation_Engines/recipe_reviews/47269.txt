Makes a nice impression, but is quick to put together.  We're not blue cheese fans so I subsituted feta, tasted great!

This tasted so great and was so easy.  I searched for something to make to go with a pasta dish after coming home from a ski trip and feeling lazy to eat out.  Found this recipe and happened to have all the ingredients (used apricot instead of peach).  Dinner was on the table in under 30 minutes, and our friend was so impressed that he said he's sending his wife over for lessons!

Loved this recipe! Also made it with fresh pears and I liked the canned ones better. Simple to prepare and looks great.

Very good - added a little molasses to the dressing as in the recipe for Hot Spinach salad on this web site & left the rest as is.  Everyone loved it.

I have made this for several events and everyone loves it. I always add some walnuts and use feta cheese instead of blue since it's milder.  Will try with canned mandarin oranges for summer months.

It's quite delicious.  I added candied pecans.  Since I don't like raw onions, I'll caramelize them next time.  Fancy little salad that's delicious and quick.

Wow, I'd eat spinich everyday if it tasted like this!  It took my hubby just a matter of minutes to whip this up.  My parents are visiting in a couple of weeks, and I will remake this then.

Loved this salad, and so did my DH!  I backed down a little on the oil.  And used Goats cheese instead of blue.  Lastly am not a big fan of canned pears.  So I recommend ripe to overripe (sweetness is key here) pears.

Very good salad!! we're not used to blue cheese, but it blended in really well with the other ingredients. I used a very ripe fresh pear, it was great! The only suggestion I have is cut back a little on the oil and add a little molasses to the vinegrette to give it a little somthing extra. MMmmmm...

Excellent!  The combination of the sweetness from the pears with the smoky taste of the balsamic vinegar makes this salad a real treat!
