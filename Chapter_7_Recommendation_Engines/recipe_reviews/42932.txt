This recipe is excellent, and I make it often :-) For those who claim not to like tofu, I think this dish gives tofu to stand on its own, not just be a substitute for meat. If you're a vegtarian, I'd advise using slightly more tofu, adding more Asian vegetables, and scaling up the amount of sauce by 50%. You also might want to add 1 to 1-1/2 Tbsp of sesame oil, to replace the flavor the pork gives it.

Here are some other comments:

1. As written, this recipe is quite spicy. For the fainter of heart, I would recommend starting with 1/2 tsp of cayenne. Less if you're really spice-phobic.

2. To make the texture more interesting, I put the tofu cubes on parchment on a baking sheet and put them under the broiler (second rack down) for about 10-15 minutes, so the outside gets crispy. You could also fry it for a similar effect, but the broiling approach is lower fat.

3. I always put in a teaspoon of sesame oil into the black bean mixture. It only adds 5g of fat total to the dish and rounds out the flavor a bit more.

4. I don't think the 1 Tbsp of corn starch is enough to thicken the gravy sufficiently. I usually end up using 1 1/2 - 2 Tbsp.

5. For more different textures, adding some bamboo shoots or water chestnuts is a tasty alteration. If you add a lot more stuff, though, make sure you scale up the black bean sauce to coat everything sufficiently.

There is nothing wrong with this recipe, but be forewarned: It is NOT a recipe for Ma Po Tofu.  First of all, Ma Po Tofu's main flavor is the Sichuan peppercorn.  Seriously, this is the main flavor of the dish... yet it doesn't appear in the list of ingredients.  It's like someone who doesn't know how to cook chinese food ordered it once, and tried to copy it without having any knowledge of Sichuan cuisine.  Many of the other ingredients do correspond to the ingredients of the original dish, but dry sherry, green peas and cayenne pepper would never appear in the restaurant version.  Thus, I have provided a 3* review not because the dish is particularly bad, but because it might mislead someone into thinking that the dish they were making would turn out to taste like Ma Po Tofu -- it will not, and you will be disappointed.

My husband and I have traveled throughout Asia, and Ma Po Tofu is one of our favorites - we have ordered it wherever available.  THIS recipe is by far the best Ma Po Tofu we have ever eaten!  I am amazed and absolutely thrilled to have found it.  Thank you Linda!  I have used a couple of tiny variations due to supplies on hand: added two thinly sliced green onions, used "hot" chili garlic sauce and 1/2 tsp pepper while leaving out the cayenne, used black bean garlic sauce without rinsing (because it is a sauce), and substituted extra-lean ground turkey for the pork.  My husband said it tasted exactly like pork, which he loves.   Oh, and I added a little more chicken broth as it cooked down a bit.  Delicious!

Hi, I live in China and Love Sichuan food "Ma Po Tofu" and "Shui Jiu Niu Rou"  are two of my favorites.  Sichuan food is known for not just the "la"  what we call "spicy hot" but also "ma la" which is the no-so-hot but mouth numbing tingling feeling you can only get from Sichuan peppercorns.  They have an amazing flavor- I am Addicted.  If you go to a Chinese grocery store ask for "hua jiao" "flower pepper." It is little and round black/brown, sometimes green or other colors.  Both syllables are pronounced in the first tone, high, and flat.  good luck- it is worth it.... just watch out!  try grinding it a little or just fry them in oil and throw them in- THE AROMA...

This was great!  I used beef instead of pork, like my local noodle-house does.  I also added a finely chopped half-onion, and added a bit of white pepper, and a dab of sesame oil.  I probably used a whole thumbs-length of fresh ginger, finely chopped.  I served it over rice, with broccoli on the side.  I'd never sliced soft tofu before - it's so easy! two cuts horizontally, then slice as on a grid.  Very nice texture - creamy and soft.  I tried not to stir the mixture too much as it heated, so some of the tofu would retain its shape.

Delicious. I've made this dish many times and the BF (who is not normally a tofu fan) and I always gobble it up. For those of you have trouble finding fermented black beans - the black bean paste/sauce that comes in a jar works great (you should be able to find it at the Ethinc Food isle at your grocery store). I serve this plain white rice, and I like to double the sauce b/c love having it over my rice. I also use sliced waterchestnuts instead of peas for some extra crunch (and b/c the BF doesn't like peas but loves waterchestnuts). Another tip - I once subbed beef broth for the chicken broth b/c I'd ran out of the latter, and it tasted great as well - richer, in fact. So, when you feel like having a richer tofu dish, use beef broth. Otherwise, chicken broth is just fine.

I will definitely make this again. I added a few drops of sesame oil and 2 green onions as well, and used black bean sauce instead of the beans. Served over rice, it made a very good hearty meal. I dare you not to like tofu after this!

This is a great dish for those just coming into the tofu world! Thank you for sharing it!  It's a super hit and often cooked!  I too add 1 tsp of sesame oil to the pork/meat section and to sauce mixture.  We like things really spicy so I've increased the chili sauce and the cayenne pepper by 50% and used Chili Bean Sauce instead of the fermented black beans.  I've served it with nasi goreng (Indonesian fried rice) and with yellow rice and both were a hit.  Many thanks again for this great recipe!

Yummy!  And only the 2nd time I've been able to make tofu turn out good. My changes- I used 1/2 lb ground pork and black bean garlic sauce since I couldn't find paste.  I've found that tofu is much tastier if you make a good effort to squeeze out the water- I place the tofu on a plate with a plate on top of it and something sort of heavy on top of that plate and let it squeeze the water out for 30 minutes.  Then it sucks up the flavor of the sauce well.  Delicious!

This was my first time buying/trying tofu and I went into not expecting to like it but was desperately wanting to try  it. Turns out, I don't like tofu but I refuse to give this a low rating just because I didn't end up liking the main ingredient. IF you like tofu and spicy, I think you will love this dish. I agree with other reviewers in the fact that you need to use extra firm. I used fresh snap peas instead of frozen regular peas and they were excellent in this. Even though tofu ended up not being our thing (taste like what band-aids smell like to me) this was an excellent recipe and one I highly recommend if you like tofu.

This is a great recipe that I've made a few times now. My only complaint about the recipe is that 1 tsp of cayenne makes the dish way too spicy. I love spicy but I find using 1/2 tsp works much better. Also, I used ground turkey instead of pork (BF won't eat pork), used fresh pea pods instead of frozen peas, and added mushrooms and water chestnuts. I then topped with green onion (per another reviewer's suggestion). Delicious.

We just made this for dinner. We made a veggie version and just added some steamed broccoli. We also didn't have any chili paste, so used chili garlic sauce instead.  We did broil the tofu, as suggested, and it was good.  I personally, found this a little bit salty.  If we made this again, we will use less soy sauce.

Delicious and so quick and easy to make! I added green onions at the end as well and replaced the sherry with xiao shing rice wine since that was all I had. Seemed to work great. 

Great recipe!! Thanks for sharing!!

I've never had this before and this was my first time making it and I loved it. I worked with what I had on hand. I subbed leftover roast pork, cut up for the ground pork; red wine vinegar and water for the sherry. I didn't have chili paste w/garlic so I used chili powder and minced garlic from a jar. I skipped the cayenne, peas & chicken broth. 

I sauteed the tofu cubes in olive oil with fresh sliced mushrooms, minced garlic, fresh chopped up ginger and chili powder. Near the end I threw in 2 handfuls of fresh spinach leaves. In the sauce pan I heated up the cut up roast pork, red wine vinegar, water, cornstarch, a bit of chicken broth granules, soy sauce, regular canned black beans with the juice and some chick peas. Then added in the sauteed mix and served. Both my kids wanted some too. I didn't measure anything. This recipe is very forgiving and you can tweak it any way you want. I will definitely make this again. Delicious. I

I substituted the dry sherry, water & chicken broth with sake. I also substituted the cayenne pepper with Thai chili powder and added chopped fresh Thai chili since we like it spicy.  I don't have any peas but I added the chopped spring onion instead.

The sauce was basically good although the as written verdon myst be incredibly spicg. I only used half the red pepper and it was at the top of my comfort zone for heat. I addded another 1/2 c of liquid as it wss too thick in the sauce with cornstarch in it in 2 places. I am not terribly fond of tofhu but it is healthy so i am looking for ways to hide it in my food. The sauce  I did like with changes above. The tofu still had the soft squishy texture I dont love. Another poster suggested broiling or frying it first. That might help.

Ya gotta love "spicy" but DH absolutely enjoyed this dish.  Made it just as stated.  Thanks for sharing.  Wasn't as "soupy" as I thought it was going to be.  Warms up good the next day.

Made once with tofu and once with chicken thighs (cut in pieces). Very good both ways!

Good flavour but way too salty for me.  Would definitely cut down on the soy sauce and/or chicken stock next time but I will definitely make it again.  I substituted long beans for the peas and used more pork and increased the sauce quantity.  It really is worth trying this recipe.

Yummy and easy! We doubled the amount of ground pork, sherry and cornstarch mixture, doubled the amount of chicken broth and minced fresh ginger,  used Black Bean Sauce with Garlic since we couldn't find fermented black beans, Linghams's Hot Sauce since we didn't have chili paste, and like others, added some green onions and a few drops of sesame oil at the end. Hint:  Take the tofu out of the water in package and press it down with weighted plate or bowl for 10-20 minutes to get some of the excess water out.  Thanks. We'll make again.

I've always seen Ma Po Tofu on Chinese restaurant menus, but had never tried it. We all really enjoyed it. I used prepared black bean paste and I cut way back on the soy sauce because prepared paste is pretty salty, but next time I won't use soy sauce at all as the finished dish was still a little salty for me. The recipe doesn't specify what firmness tofu should be used; I used extra-firm and was glad I did - I can see a softer tofu falling apart in this. I followed everything else as written and served it with sesame rice. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the most "restaurant-like" version I have tried.  I didn't have the correct beans -- I used fermented soy bean paste instead --but I figure the fermented part was more important than the kind of bean.  I also subsititued szechuan pepper for the cayenne, as I knw that is what most restaiurants use.  Next time I will double the sauce ingredients, as I like my ma po tofu on the saucy side, and I found this a bit too dry for me.  But, it was super quick - definitely faster than getting takeout.

This recipe reminds me of some of the best ma po tofu dishes served in restaurants in Singapore. It's quite spicy though,so better to go with less cayenne pepper, and add more to your taste as it's simmering.  We loved it, kids thought it a bit too spicey.  Served over rice, awesome.

I've made this dish twice and it turned out great both times!  I left out the peas, made a little extra sauce, & dried the tofu out a bit in the oven (as one of the previous reviewers recommended).  My husband loved this dish and said it was as good as what we've had in local restaurants!

Excellent Chinese comfort food!  I only used half a teaspoon of chili paste and omitted the cayenne pepper entirely.  This gave it a hint of spiciness that I enjoy.

This was very tasty.  My husband and I both loved it.  The only thing I felt like it was missing was the straw mushrooms.  Also we didn't add any peas.  I love peas, just not in my tufo.  I'm so glad to have the recipe!!!

Most excellent, however watch out for the cayenne.  I used 1/2 of what is called for and it was plenty!  We are spicy-food eaters, too, and half the recommended cayenne made our heads sweat.

My husband thought this was pretty good but I thought it was good, but it seems so much like hamburger helper (ground meat, peas, and tofu is all it is).   Serving it with rice was important. I cut way back on the cayenne and chili paste, and used black bean sauce with garlic instead of the fermented beans.  Putting in the frozen peas at the end means they give a nice 'pop' when you eat the dish, and they add color. But it was when I added the peas that it suddenly looked like an american casserole.  IF I make it again I might add more bean sauce and other vegetables (mushrooms, green onions, onions).

Love this! Of course I have made a few modifications and have made this many, many times. I have toddlers so I don’t use the cayenne, and have found that depending on the type of bean paste you use one must definitely scale back on the soy sauce. Taste your mixture before adding it to your dish! I quadruple this recipe every time I make it! So yummy!

Loved it! Turned out very similar to the mapo tofu I used to eat growing up in Vancouver. :) thanks for sharing! Only variations I made were adding a bit of green pepper and green onion and a hit of Chinese five spice (for the Sichuan peppercorn taste) - and used beef instead of pork. Curious to try with pork next time and will also add more spice because I like it spicy!

It came out pretty good, and very easy & fast.  I feel like it needs a little acidity - maybe a little vinegar? But it's a good quick, healthy supper and I'll definitely make it again. I didn't have cornstarch but flour worked fine. Also didn't add the extra cayenne but the chili sauce lent enough mild heat for flavor.

This is a great recipe! It might not be authentic but it is delicious! I upped the cayenne, soy sauce and chili-paste with garlic to 2 tblsp (which may have been too much) and it made the dish bursting with flavor. Love it over rice.

The recipe is very easy to follow and easy to make, but the flavour isn't what I'd like it to be. I liked the spiciness of the dish, but it's lacking some key elements like Szechuan peppercorns.

Have made this at least 6 times. Love it! I agree with many that you should go easy on the cayenne pepper, unless you really like your food hot. Also agree that you should double the sauce. I've never made a dish with tofu, but have had some eating out. In this dish, I like the texture of the tofu crumbled so it blends in nicely with the ground pork, so I buy extra firm tofu and squeeze as much liquid out as I can (probably easy with cheesecloth-so far I've just used my hands!) and it crumbles easily. I love adding chopped water chestnuts. One time my son ate all of my frozen peas, so I just used regular mushrooms and scallions. I loved it. Now I add these every time, plus the peas. I also use black bean paste. Very forgiving  and easy recipe. I've never had the "true" dish at a restaurant, but love this one!

This is a great recipe. Its very easy to prepare and tastes great, and reheats well if you don't finish it all. I don't have sherry and I usually add sriracha (rooster brand) on it to make it spicy.

Depending on what tofu you use, you may need add a bit more cornstarch to thicken the sauce up. If the sauce is too light in color, use a bit of dark soy sauce to darken it up.

This dish was awesome!  I baked my tofu to keep the pieces from falling apart too much, and I think I could have used less cayenne.  Still it was a lot easier and more authentic than I expected.  Definitely a keeper.

Boyfriend loves it! However, it needs more meat! I highly recommend 93/7 ground beef, the little extra bit of fat helps the cornstarch thicken. Again, great boyfriend food if you need to teach him about tofu.

My husband really liked this.  We will use this base recipe again but likely add in more traditional Chinese vegetables and possibly reduce the pepper.

I love everything about this recipe. I make it all the time and everyone loves it... even if they are typically weary of tofu since it picks up the flavors of the dish nicely.

Thanks for the great recipe! I used sake instead of sherry and added sliced green onions. This was deliciously spicy. It was a little too spicy for my SO, but perfect for me.

So delicious!  I used ground ginger instead of fresh ginger and bean sauce instead of the fermented black beans.  Tasted wonderful with these substitutions!  I love this recipe, thanks for sharing!

Ma Po Tofu is my favorite asian dish - this recipe is a great homemade version!  I've tried many recipes before this, and this one is the best.  I don't eat meat, so instead of pork I use mushrooms, I also add a lot of chopped green onions at the end.  I also sometimes add diced carrots to give it a little more substance since I don't use the pork!  Love this recipe! thank you!

This recipe was awesome! I was a little skeptical about it tasting like ma po tofu from a restaurant since it had so few ingredients, but the flavor was right on!  Also, not nearly as oily as from some restaurants but still has all taste :)  Highly recommended.

This was delicious!  I also used black bean chili paste and garlic chili sauce and left out the cayenne - it was wonderful!  I served it with brown rice, as opposed to the white rice recommended, for more nutritional value.  Definitely a keeper!

I used braised tofu, soy beans instead of peas, & ground turkey instead of pork.  It was very yummy!  Next time I will cook the meat first, then add the sherry because I would have liked to drain out the grease from the turkey.  Not quite like the dish a Chinese relative made for me, but a very close second.

I like tofu and it was good to find a tasty and relatively easy dish to make.  I took the suggestion of one reviewer to use the black bean sauce w/garlic instead of the fermented black beans.  That worked well.  I also used ground beef instead of ground pork.  The first try, I put the chili sauce and no cayenne pepper.  The second try, I didn't put any chili sauce nor cayenne pepper because I wanted the kids to give it a try.  It is better with the chili sauce but it was still tasty without it.

What a wonderful recipe! If you think you don't like tofu, you should try this recipe. It will quickly change your mind. I know this will be one of our family favorites! I too added a bit more broth and used ground sirloin instead of pork. The sauce is so delicious! Thanks for sharing a tasty, healthy, low-fat recipe!
