To make this recipe kid friendly...I added 1tbsp of brown sugar to the dressing and substituted the almond slivers with almond meal.  I also used Creamy mild American mustard instead of dry. I added strawberrys. My 4 kids at every bite of this beautiful salad!!

This was pretty good. Instead of dry mustard, I used dijon. I also just used regular balsamic vinegar since I had never heard of maple flavored.  I also used bagged spinach as a timesaver. Next time, I will add some strawberries.

This salad was very good, great combination of flavors. I didn't have maple flavored balsamic vinegar, so I used regular balsamic vinegar and added some real maple syrup.

I couldn't find maple flavored balsamic vinegar, so I just used regular balsamic vinegar. This salad was incredible! I definitely plan on making it again in the future.

As is, it's good. However, I could have done without the dressing. It just didn't seem to fit. I did get the idea of throwing mango and all kinds of nuts into my salad because of this recipe. Thanks.

I made this a few times for different functions...it's very delicious and it's definitely a favourite for vegetarians. The only complaint that I would have is that mangoes always sink to the bottom so I have to tell people to scoop up to get some fruit. It's the nature of the recipe so I guess it can't really be changed. But once it's served on the plate, it's yummy!!!!

This was very good.  Like others I didn't have any maple balsamic so I used a bit of maple syrup.  Also used dried tarragon instead of fresh, and added some arugula, sprouts etc.

It was fabulous! I used reg balsamic and added a little maplec syrup. Didn't have any tarragon and used a dash of oregano.  I added thinly sliced strawberries and cucumbers. I also topped it with a little feta. When I tried the dressing I was worried it would be overwhelming but it wasn't... it was an amazing dish! I will make it again! Thank you for sharing!
