Just what I'm looking for. Bought some gorgeous Poblanos yesterday and will give this a try. How can someone decide if they don't like a recipe if they haven't tried it? If a recipe doesn't appeal to you, shut up and move on. Keep your hate to yourself.

I have not tried this, but it intrigues me. I suggest using both boneless breast halves and boneless thighs. And buy the chicken with skins on for extra flavor. You may need to cook the chicken a little longer. If you are concerned about the fat, remove and discard the skin before plating.

Poblano cream added nothing to the recipe but the time and trouble to roast and prepare the pepper!

I have made this recipe twice and my family loves it.  I made it exactly as the recipe was written so I could give an honest opinion.  It is worth the effort.

My kids loved it...it's not as intense as I thought it would be.   Easy dish to make and eat.  Followed the directions precisely. Served it with brown rice.

I am not a soup sauce fan, but Campbell's sells a Cream of Poblano soup in many parts of the country,  and it is very good.  King Ranch Chicken casserole is fabulous when you use it for the can of cream of mushroom, along with the cream of chicken soup. I will try this recipe using the poblano soup and one more roasted poblano, small dice, in the sauce.  Using a large onion, saut√©ed well, then putting at least a third of it in the sauce would help also.   Remember thst Mexican cookery uses white onions and is more compatible with those recipes. Minced fresh cilantro sprinkled lightly  on top as a garnish is a nice touch, but only if you enjoy it. Sometimes, I believe Campbell's is so focused on shortcuts they sacrifice flavor anf many dishes come out very bland.... always tweak   them to suit your taste.   Oh, and cook that chicken for at least fifteen minutes more at a low simmer stirring occasionally.

It seems that putting the peppers into the simmering sauce would help a lot. And if you really want flavor, get a can of chipotle peppers in adobe sauce, dice one up really small or whiz it in the blender or food processor and add that to your sauce. Then it will have a little kick and a lot more flavor.
