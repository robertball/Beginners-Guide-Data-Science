I have ALWAYS been afraid to make Chicken Alfredo. This was so EASY. One substitution I did make was I used sour cream instead of whipping cream or half and half because that is what I had in my fridge. The whole family LOVED it. We got 8 servings out of it.  I ate it 3 nights in a row and it was wonderful heated up. I highly suggest this recipe!!!

This was SUPER delicious!! The only thing I did different was add extra garlic (powder form), onion powder, and Italian seasoning. I also added milk in leiu of the cream and just let it cook down to thicken up. Also, I mixed in shredded mozerella at the very end. Super yummy!! Best Alfredo on here yet!!

I added broccoli to this to make it a complete meal and used whole wheat fettuccine.  This dish was okay.  I had to toss out leftovers which is unusual in my home.  If there had been more of an abundance of sauce, I think it would've gone over much better.

My fiance and I really loved this recipe for one of our weeknight meals.  However, we cannot find the Progresso Recipe Starter anymore and we have tried 3 grocery stores in our area.  We may have to try making chicken alfredo another way.  :-(

This was a 4 star recipe. Of course, I made a drastic changes,I used beef instead, 2 cloves of garlic, and I used sour cream instead of whipping cream/half-half. I recommend sour cream over whipping cream, tastes alot better.

For both ease of preparation and taste, this recipe beats any other I have tried hands down.  Never any leftovers!

About the chicken Alfredo the recipe is OKAY. It was kind of hard to follow the direction. well the ingredients about the Chicken Alfredo is plane but one of my member actually added Johnny Seasoning into for flavor,the flavor turned out alright. I don't even know if its different then the others. Everything is actually different then each other recipe how to make it. The final look like, it really look good how we made it.This is my first time actually made this type of food.

Not bad, but to be honest I don't know that the canned good helped, and overall it was just a little bland. I did make some perhaps significant modifications, which you can judge for yourself at my customized version http://allrecipes.com/customrecipe/63436137/creamy-chicken-and-mushroom-alfredo/detail.aspx. To summarize, I added vegetables and subtracted fat (left out the butter and used milk instead of cream). I am not one to eat meat swimming in fat on a weeknight - that would be a special occasion kind of meal.

Another case of a good base but needs (a lot) more help. I made the recipe as written except I used linguine instead of fettuccine.  We thought it was pretty bland. It is not something I would serve guests.

What turned out well was the "Cooking Sauce" it didn't take much but follow the basic steps. But the Final product didn't come out well as we expected due to the pasta being over cooked. There wasn't any changes to the ingredients but they way how it turned out didn't satisfy me. 
If I were to cook this I would not overcook the pasta. The Final product looked like food you would get in jail but yet again this is how I see it. I would recommend to anyone to cook this because I believe if I were to cook this individually it would turn out great and taste better than my last due to many perspectives on how they whats "right" when cooking.

This recipe was an okay turn out. The pasta looked scrumptious, but the taste was somewhat different from the look. It had steps that were easy to follow and the outcome was very nice. The food looked as it did in the photo of the food and I was very pleased with the look. The only problem was the taste. We never changed nothing about the servings or anything but the taste was more like a macaroni and cheese than chicken Alfredo. I think it may have been the sauce. I believe that if we made our own sauce, the taste would have been better. I would definitely recommend this recipe to others, but the only thing I would say to change if you would like a different taste of sauce is to create your own Alfredo sauce. Overall it was a great turn out!

The Easy Weeknight Creamy Chicken Alfredo had an easy recipe to follow although it was in one step. The final product turned better than the picture in my view because we added parsley at the top. We did not alter the serving so there was no change in the recipe. The next time I make the same recipe I would use some more spices and vegetables so it doesn’t look plain. I would recommend this recipe to some else because it’s easy and tasty.

Tasty and easy to put together.  I wondered, though, if it might be just as easy to make an sauce from scratch.  But it was convenient, uncomplicated, and good.

This turned out so much better then I had hoped for. I made it exactly as written then added fresh spinach and steamed carrots at the end for a more colorful dish. We ate it for 2 days and liked it very much.

This was much better than I expected after reading the reviews.  The sauce was actually pretty good and very easy.  I went with half and half and instead of 1/2 cup parm I used 1/4 cup parm and 1/4 cup mozzarella.  I used Shirtake noodles instead of pasta to lower the carbs and instead of chicken I sauteed some shrimp coated in Cajun seasoning.  Next time I would use the pasta and save the Shirtake for something else. All in all I feel this is a good starter.

So the boys would have rated this a 5, I think it's a 3 so we'll meet in the middle at 4.  Personally, I don't think this dish is any easier than making a fresh cream sauce, but I know a lot of people are intimidated to make their own so this is an easy option.  The only changes I made were to add some sauteed diced onion (half a cup) and some lemon pepper seasoning on the chicken.  My boyfriend and son went back for seconds.

This is a good base recipe to add your own twists to in order to make a great meal. My favourite additions include mushrooms, spinach, mozzarella, and using sour cream. I did find the directions a little confusing as it talks about salt, pepper, butter and garlic, all of which are not on the ingredients list for the dish. But overall a nice and easy weeknight meal that you can easily adjust to suit your tastes.

I really did not care for this. I was really looking forward to it after reading the first 2 reviews. It sounded wonderful. I followed the recipe as is, but the sauce looked thin and had a strange tin can after taste. So, I followed the first 2 reviews and added some sour cream and mozzarella, to see if I could thicken it up and cut through the flavor. It definitely didn't taste homemade to me and the basil flavor was too strong, also, in my opinion. The additions helped some, but this just quite honestly tasted a lot like the noodle and powder packets at the store but with a lot more work.
