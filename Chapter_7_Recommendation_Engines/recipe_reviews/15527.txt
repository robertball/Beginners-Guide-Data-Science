I was impressed with how little time it took to make this candy and it's really good--especially to peanut butter-lovers!

Very smooth- taste much like a non-crunchy Butterfinger Bar. Might be great with an added chocolate layer.

I LOVE this recipe. It's peanut butter fudge with few ingredients and few steps. Love it. We have some food allergies to dairy and corn. I use Agave syrup instead of corn syrup and oat milk instead of "milk" and it comes out ridiculously good. Best part is my husband who has never made anything sweet before just made this for me last night with no help from me and couldn't even screw it up!

This is a very creamy candy much like a PB fudge but couldn't be simpler to make! I was very pleased with the end results with so few ingredients.

Thanks. While still warm rolled into balls about 3/4 in (made 85). Dipped into tempered milk chocolate. Yummy.
