For years, my husband was looking for the "right" cardamom cookie...and we found it in  this recipe!! It's by far the best spice cookie I have ever tried! It's flaky and light. Just perfect! I have also used this for Pecan Pie and Pumpkin Pie crust.(I bake the crust at 350 for about 5 min before adding the filling; then put foil strips around the crimped edges of the crust. Take the foil off 5 min. before the pies come out of the oven, they're beautiful!!

These cookies are excellent! Based on prior reviews, i doubled the cardamom, adn added more cinnamon. Also, instead of lemon, i used orange peel, and insted of milk, orange juice. I rolled the dough in a log, put it in the fridge for an hour, then sliced the cookies, and baked at 375 degrees for 8 minutes, and they came out pefect!

I absolutely loved this cookie.  I found the dough a little sticky to work with and you must be very careful with the cooking time as it cooks very quickly. I think this is a cookie that adults would probably enjoy more than kids.

On my second go round with these cookies, my opinion of them has risen considerably.  Still didn't use the zest, still didn't dust cookies (I think they're sweet enough as-is).  Did however use butter instead of my usual low fat margarine this time.  Used too much butter, in fact, closer to a half cup than, so almost 2 tbsp over.  The result was a cookie that wanted to be more like shortbread, which I certainly had no problems with.  Doubled the cardamom this time and did a couple shakeashakes extra of cinnamon and I think these are pretty much the perfect tea cookie.  A very 'adult' cookie as someone else said.  Lastly, extra butter helped the stickiness in my dough SUBSTANTIALLY and I chilled in the fridge for an hour while watching TV :)  Normally I reserve 3 stars for recipes that were fine but not something I'd make again--this time it's just due to the number of changes I've made.

Soft, delicious. Don't cook these too long or you lose that lovely texture. They're great with raisins or dates and with extra cardamom.

These are a nice textured cookies, but need way more spice.  I used 2 tsp of cardamom and 1 of cinnamon.  Also tried a batch with dried cranberries added and they were very good.

The recipe turns out great after a few adjustments. I increased the cardamom to 1.5 tspn, the cinamon to 1/2 tspn, and lemon peel to 1/2 tspn.  I don't like cookies too sweet, so I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup to let the spice flavour come out. I also found the dough too sticky too roll, so I made balls and flattened them with my hand - note that this will decrease the yield to 1.5 dozen.  I sprinkled pecans on top, too, and am enjoying the cookies very much!

Cookies are very good but this recipe needed lots of tweaking. I used 1/2 tsp cardamom and 1/4 tsp cinnamon and used orange zest in place of the lemon. I did not add the milk as the dough was already too sticky. It was far too sticky to work with so I rolled in a log in plastic wrap and chilled in the freezer then sliced the log to make the cookies.

The dough was too sticky to roll so i just spooned them out and flattened each one individually.  I left out the almonds, so perhaps that is why.  I made them once with double the cardamom and still thought it was too subtle, so made them with triple.  Very pleasant cookie.

Dough is too sticky to roll but cookies turn out fine the "regular" way.  Unique flavor.

I love these cookies.  I have just made them for the second time.  The dough was sticky so I used a small scoop to put them on the parchment paper and then slightly wetted my fingers to flatten them.  I chilled the dough in the refrig. in between batches.

I made these intending to take them to work but forgot to do so.  Bf wasn't impressed but he doesn't like cardamom.  I forgot about sprinkling sugar on top; I should have done so, as these cookies are not that sweet.  I added a bit more cardamom and the flavor is not very strong at all. Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies are great. I added a bit more cardamom and cinnamon as per previous reviews. The only thing is that I doubled the recipe and only had 15 cookies. Maybe I make them big, but that's how I like them. Great recipe.

Delicious flavor; followed the recipe exactly, only necessity forced me to use vanilla almond milk instead of regular. Yum! Also, didn't roll these out 1/8" thick because it was too sticky to use a rolling pin on; instead, I just made thumb-tip sized drops on the cookie sheet, and that seemed to work fine.

I had no lemon, so orange zest it was and no almonds, so walnuts were substituted. They turned out to be a considerably different type of cookie, but nonetheless a tasty spice cookie. Will make again and take the advice of other users to use the cookie as pie crusts.

Delicious cookies.  I used orange zest, since I did not have a lemon and liked the way it turned out.

For those of you allergic to wheat & gluten, I made these wonderful cookies with a combo of sorghum, rice & coconut flour. I'm also allergic to almonds so used hazelnuts instead. Added extra cardamom, extra lemon zest & a sprinkle of anise seed. Even used Earth Balance vegan butter. And they came out light, flaky and absolutely delicious!!

Looking for a decent cardamon recipe to use up the bottle of spice... this cookie dough has no baking soda, no baking powder low ratio of butter to flour and not much else to making it moist or chewy etc. Yes I added in more lemon zest as well as cinnamon and i normally also make my pie crusts by pulsing in the food processor..but this dough recipe still baked dry hard and looked like a DIET biscuit. I sincerely believe the ratio of ingredients are incorrect and i earnestly ask the food testers of allrecipes to please try baking this. I am not convinced it is a bona fide cookie recipe and feel it has been posted as a joke.... sorry.

Did not have lemon zest or orange zest so I used 1 tsp lemon juice and then reduced milk to 1 tsp. Also increased the cardamom to 1 tsp and the cinnamon to 1 tsp. Did not sprinkle with sugar (enough sugar in dough). Baked on parchment paper about 10 minutes. Very good cookie, easy and quick to make.
