Recipe is simple - but it doesn't have the same rich flavor as "true" caramel sauce.  Making caramel sauce from scratch is soooo much easier than babysitting a can for 3 hours!  What you need:  1 cup Sugar, 6 Tablespoons Butter, 1/2 cup Heavy Cream.  Have the butter and cream measured out and on hand when you begin.  Whisk 1 cup of sugar in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves.  Once the sugar starts boiling - do not whisk just swirl the pan.  When the sugar turns an amber color add the butter and swirl until melted.  Remove pan from heat and count to 3 - then slowly pour the cream into the pan, swirling until incorporated - then whisk until mixture is smooth.  Pour into mason (glass) jars and allow to cool.  Can be kept refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.  Easily done in less than 10 minutes and tastes much better!

I first reviewed this a couple of years ago, but I wanted to post again in response to the scare-mongering... Ok, so my experience is this: I have boiled DOZENS and DOZENS of cans of condensed milk, and I can assure anyone that IT IS COMPLETELY SAFE TO DO SO. My only advice is 1. Make sure you keep topping up the water, and do not let the pan boil dry. 2. Be careful when opening the can: I wrap the can in an old towel, because some of the very hot caramel sauce does ooze out of the puncture hole a little. By the way, the 'sauce' will turn out very very thick and gloopy - NOT a syrupy pourable consistency.

People, People, People.  My greatgrandmother, grandmother, mother and now myself have been boiling Eagle Brand Condensed milk for a century and half. Some reviews said that the cans were exploding, easy resolution. 1. Do NOT open the can or puncture holes in it.in any way 2. Get a large pot of water boiling. 3. Once water is boiling, take off milk labels and put cans into water (I do 4 at a time as it will keep on the shelf for a few months) 4. Turn temperature down to simmering & allow to cook for 2 to 3 hours (the longer you cook it the darker/thicker it will be) No one in my family has ever turned he cans. 5. after cooking for alloted time, turn off heat and remove pan from the stove to allow to cool, & then just walk away, do NOT attempt to drain the water or remove the can or open the can at all. 6. You MUST allow the cans & water to cool, before opening the can up. This will prevent the exploding can dilemma for some of the reviewers!  The milk can also be done on a campfire (which I have done at least a dozen times or more-allow it to cool in your cast iron dutch oven the same way you do in a pan on your stove top).  It is an amazing treat at camp (the boyscouts love it). This comes out thick enough to spread & we have been eating on sliced apples for as long as I can remember-delish.  Add a scoop to a pan with a little heavy cream & heat for an amazing caramel sauce...As far as the babysitting comments go...watching your food usually goes hand in hand with cooking :)

I don't know if it's a good idea to leave the lid on the can when boiling.  I've been doing this for at least 10 years when making my caramel pie and have never left the lids on. Better to be safe than sorry, remove the lids...makes it easy to stir around to make sure all the milk is cooked properly as well as preventing unwanted pressure building up inside the can with the boiling water.

I agree about the waste of time and energy for this, and I have an alternative. I love this stuff so much I'll eat it right out of the can as dessert in itself. But if I want to heat it, I make two notches in the can and put it on my top oven rack for 20 minutes or so at around 350. I'm not sure if this is a whole lot safer, but it seems to work alright and I just carefully take the thing out with oven mitts.

Do be careful if you try this method. I checked the Eagle Brand website, and found three methods for making their Homemade Caramel, similar to this recipe. They also said "For safety reasons, heating the unopened can (an old cooking method) is NOT recommended."

This is good. It's definitely got more of a butterscotch taste than caramel, but it's nice. It's not really a sauce; I used it to fill the bottom of a pie before topping with bananas and cinnamon. As for the safety factor - keep in mind that nearly ALL canned foods are cooked inside the sealed can at high temps in order to pasteurize the food inside. Some foods actually go into the can raw and are cooked during this process (the noodles in Campbell's chicken noodle soup, for example). It's perfectly safe.

I had worked in a canning factory for years and seen my share of sealed cans explode.  Hot, warm and cooled, doesn't make a difference.  When they explode it can be dangerous and messy.  Loud too.

I was recommended a similar way of making caramel where you take the lid off the tin and stand the can in boiling water 3/4 of the way up the sides for a few minutes. I think this way might be better for people who are concerned about time or the sealed tin. You would also be able to see how fast it was caramelising and be able to judge the time for yourself. It's apparently good for camping if you want caramel on your porridge in the mornings!

It takes all the hassle out of making the actual caramel and dissolving it with cream. However, some may find it a bit too sweet for their liking. This can be problem can be resolved easily by adding cream (or low fat milk) till the desired consistency / sweetness is reached.

Cheers!

This isn't caramel.
I'm spanish, my grandmother has been making this for over 50 years, and her mother before that. It's basicly "dulce de leche" or "manjar" as it's called in my country. Traditionally it's made in a pot stirring constantly, but this is much easier to make. Also, I will add that I nor my grandmother have ever turned the can and it has never scortched nor has it exploded. As long as it's completly submerged in water, there is no need to turn it.

This is so easy and good.  I made a couple of cans in the crock pot, as I read was possible from another reviewer.  I filled the CP with water, set it to low, and ignored it all day.  About 9 or 10 hours later I turned off the CP and let the water cool naturally.  After it cooled and I removed the cans & opened them, both were filled with yummy "dulce de leche" style caramel.  It is now in my refrigerator, waiting for it's next use.  I saw the caramel apple dipping sauce they sell in the stores, and I vowed to never buy that again!  I'm so excited to have this easy, yummy recipe.  Thanks!

I've made caramel this way for many years. It is delicious! A couple of hints: Don't use sweetened condensed milk with a pull tab top, think old school. The lids on these cans are already weak for easy opening. Use a BIG kettle of water. Fold an old dishrag and place under the can while boiling, or something else to lift the can off the bottom of the pot. You don't have to use a rolling boil, a simmer or a little bigger than that will do. 3 hours is a minimum for a spoonable caramel, longer makes a thicker, darker caramel. I'd guess that the reviewer that got the butterscotch flavor needed to leave it to boil a while longer. But hey, I like butterscotch, too. Allow the can to cool in the pot with the water. I wouldn't handle it until it is cool. Plus, who wants to handle a gallon of boiling water and a hot can of lava! This is WAY better than the dip you can buy for apples! My grandmother's name was Marie. She cooked for 8 kids. If she gave me a recipe, I knew it was tried and true!

This is NOT a true caramel sauce, my thought is that this is a simplified version of dulce de leche.  The method couldn't be any easier.  Some reviews indicated trouble w/ cans exploding, well that issue is easily solved. 1. Do NOT open the can or puncture it in any way. 2. Set a large pot of water to boiling.  3. Once water is boiling, insert cans (making sure to remove the outer label) 4. Turn temperature to where it's gently simmering and allow to simmer for 2-3 hours (the longer you cook it the darker/thicker it will be) 5. Once time has elapsed, turn off heat and remove pan to allow to cool, and walk away, do NOT attempt to drain the water or remove the can or open the can at all.   6. You MUST allow the cans & water to cool, before opening the can up.  Hopefully this will prevent the exploding can episodes for some of the reviewers!

This is truly an excellent, time saving recipe for caramel sauce!  Yes, you do have to use caution when boiling the milk.  I wouldn't consider it "babysitting" because you can do this when you are doing your morning chores and running back and forth through the kitchen anyway.  TIMESAVER:  Boil more than one can at a time; it will keep fine on the shelf for about three months.  TIP:  Let the cans cool completely before opening.  Yes, you can buy caramel sauce, but you won't get one as good as this!!  Hands down--the best!  WARNING:  You do have to keep water in the pan and be careful not to let it boil dry.

I have beeen making this for years, I boil my in the pressure cooker for 45 minutes with the water level above the can, turns out perfect every time. Once cooled, I stir it in the can to soften it before using it as a topping on chocolate cake, sprinkled with cocoanut! My family loves it!

As some reviewers said it's not quite a pure caramel taste but it is super yummy.  I did a bit of research and decided to try it in my crockpot.  I just covered it with water and set the crockpot to low for 8 hours.  Perfection!

Actually, what you get from this is called manjar; that is sold here in chile. It is not the same as caramel, which is called caramelo in spanish. Caramel is more liquid while manjar is rich and thick. if you like the rich taste of this (which is very good) simply add milk to it(in a saucepan over medium-low heat) until it is the consistancy that you like. you can also make a mousse   hope this helps! use one can of manjar with 3 cups whipping cream + 1 tbsp confectioners sugar. whip the cream and add the sugar. fold in manjar
This is not a dangerous recipe as long as the pan always has water, it has been called a dangerous method because some people tend get distracted because it takes so much time. as long as you babysitt it .. it will be fine
i give it a 5 because it has great taste, even better than some of the manjar sold in chile. try it with toasted bread, apples, graham crackers or try the torta de hojas here.. yum!
Update: I cant believe some people say this doesnt taste good or it was a waste of ingredients!!! you can make sooo many things with manjar. its a thicker buttery milky type of caramel sauce. when you make it this way its thicker than the ones that they sell in chile or argentina but its just a matter of adding whipping cream as I said. You really wont regret this! I will upload a photo of manjar that is sold in chile so you can see the thickness that you will get because the one that i buy is very thick as i like to spread it on bread!

You can also do this in the microwave. Just pour the milk into a high-sided glass bowl, cover loosely with plastic wrap and cook on medium for 2 minutes, stir. Continue cooking, stirring every 2 minutes, for about 10-15 minutes. If you want it thicker, cook it longer.

I needed caramel sauce for a brownie recipe and was looking for a traditional sugar, butter and cream recipe. The brownie recipe calls for Smuckers caramel sauce, but I didn't want to make a trip to the store.  In my search I came upon this recipe.  Since I had a can of Borden's sweetened condensed milk sitting in the cupboard, I decided to try it first.  I followed the recipe to the letter and boy was I suprised how delicious it came out.  I've read reviews of this stuff over the years and I see what all of the hoopla is all about.  Mine came out thick like pudding with a delicious deep caramel taste and color after three hours of cooking.  I started dipping things in it like nuts and kettle chips!  I can see how people  talk about eating spoonfuls of this stuff.  I had to put it away before it was all gone.  It will work out perfect for my brownie recipe thinned out with a bit of heavy cream.

Seems too easy to be true. I take it to summer potlucks with fruit. I make 3 or 4 cans at a time and they keep unopened in the fridge for weeks.

Just a little background on this recipe....boiling a can of condensed milk is actually an old Norwegian tradition. It is called preme and is most often served on a cracker such as a Saltine. Thought you might like a fun fact!

My mother did this for us kids for years at Christmastime. When the stuff was cool, we dipped full sized marshmallows in it from the end of a kebob stick, then rolled them in shredded coconut or chopped nuts, it was a lot of fun, and an easy "candy" for us kids to make and add to the cookie tray at family parties.

My mother has been making this in this manner for over 40 years.   This is more of caramel spread than a sauce.   In Mexico it is known as Cajeta.   I've found it precooked in California at grocers carrying Mexican products & sold under the Nestle La Lechera  brand as Dulce de Leche.  Do head the warning and don't open the can until completely cooled.  You can cool the can faster & stop the cooking process by running cool water in the pot after the allotted cooking time.  The longer you cook the can the darker the Cajeta becomes.

My family and friends have been making this for over 30 years. The secret to keeping the cans from exploding is to use a pot with a strainer insert to keep the cans suspended while boiling. Make sure the cans are not touching each other or the sides of the strainer insert. Make sure the water level is at least 2 or more inches above the can tops. Bring to a full boil, then reduce heat to a slow boil with big bubbles and place a cover on the pot. Set your stove timer for 2 to 3 hours. The longer you boil, the stronger the taste. Set a second timer for 30 minutes to check your water level. Every time you check, reset the second timer for another 30 minutes. This will ensure the water will not boil down too low. If it does boil down from the original level, be sure to add more boiling water to keep it at the same high level. I use a glass lid on my pot, which makes it easier to check the water level every 30 minutes. Once your kitchen timer goes off, after 2 or 3 hours, turn off the heat and allow the cans to sit in the water and cool overnight. I use an 8-quart pot, so I can boil 5 cans at a time. I am in the process of making 5 cans everyday to use for gift giving. When I take the cans out of the water, I dry them and use a wet cloth to shine them up a bit. The cans do get cloudy looking on the outside and sometimes a little rust will show. Once they are clean and dry, I cover my cans using fancy printed duct tape and add a label with the date processed. Great on apple slices.

A tip !
if the sauce turns out too thick, add whipping cream  little at a time, until it reaches desired consistancy

I also boil the cans and just watch to make sure the water level doesn't go below the can, but even if it does, it's ok, I've had it go below the can and was still fine. I like to use it for making turtles during the holidays. Use a small ice cream scoop or cookie scooper, roll in chopped pecons and then shape into balls. Refriderate or freeze for a couple hours then dip in melted chocolate, they are so good and will amaze people when you tell them what they're made of. Good luck!

thank you Lorri and thank you CandyH.  Love the stuff and I think it tastes much more like carmel than butterscotch which I'm not that fond of.  I put 2 cans in my crock pot and cooked for 4 hours on high.  I then did as CandyH directed and added 8 oz  of cream cheese and 2 teas of vanilla and a pinch of salt to cut sweetness (never heard of that before but thought I'd give it a try.  I feel like I'm getting away with something to be able to make such a delicious sauce with so little effort.  I plan on drizzling over cheesecake for Christmas dessert.  Thank you both!

I've made this tons of times. Usually for a fridge tart, but once in a while (for a real treat) I use this as a filling in chocolate cake. Believe me - it takes even chocolate cake to a higher level of devinity.....
I usually boil for about 2 hours, don't bother with the turning of the can and after boiling I do remove from water with a slotted ladle and let the can cool completely before using.
Left overs always disappear quickly by spoon to tummy.....

When I try it next time I'll cook it for longer than the 3 hours specified since
it wasn't entirely caramelized when I opened the can.

I just HAD to try this after reading all the fears of blowing up cans etc.   I followed the directions to a T.  I just simmered it slow and made sure the can was constantly covered with boiling water.  I let it cool in the hot water as suggested.  Presto... a deeeeeelish caramel like sauce for ANYTHING.  It's not really caramel for real...but it's rich enough and sweet enough to be it's twin sister.  : )

My grandma, mom, and now myself, have been doing this for a very long time. If you keep the boiling water above the level of the can, and do not cover with a lid, you will not have a can explode. We only do it for 2 hours or so and it turns out wonderful.

This turns out amazing! Make sure to use Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk for a smooth & thick consistency. When I used Carnation Brand, the texture was a little grany, like half melted sugar. Also, I boiled an extra hour (total of 4 hours)  to make sure it was really thick & camelized. I use this on apple slices, poured over a hot apple pie, or over icecream. Also makes a great addition to gift baskets.

4 stars because it is incomplete!!  This was the FIRST step of the recipe I have been looking for.  The SECOND step is to, AFTER allowing the can to cool until you can handle it, add 4 oz. of cream cheese and 1/2 - 1 tsp. of vanilla (depending on your taste).  Also, I heated the can in my crock pot, so the heat was more even and I didn't have to "babysit" it as much.  I started with hot water and simmered on high for 2 1/2 hours.  It was better than any caramel sauce I could ever buy!!

This recipe is fantastic.  However, after it cools its more like super-sweet caramel pudding.  I put it in the blender with spiced rum to make it into a sauce, and give it away in jars.  I hate the taste of rum, but the spiced rum tastes so good in this one.  Blending it with rum turns it into a great sauce instead of custard-like consistency.

I have been doing this for years and it is wonderful caramel.  I think the taste is far better than anything that can be bought.  It is a thicker caramel, not a pourable syrup.  Just make sure you keep topping off the water and you should have no problem at all.   I have a 6 quart pot that is used specifically for this purpose, as the long boiling time causes a buildup on the sides of the pot.  I can boil 6 cans at once, making it worth the time and energy.  I don't bother with turning the cans, and have never had any problems with burning.  I also let them cool completely before opening. I like it better chilled than at room temperature.  This is wonderful for dipping apples in, spreading on the top of shortbread cookies, or just eating right off a spoon!!!

My mum has made caramel this way since before i was born. One thing i seriously suggest is let it cool in cold water 20 minutes before you open the can or it can spurt out at you causeing seriouse burns. My impatient helped me learn the hard way.

I wouldn't want to use this as a caramel sauce for something like ice cream.  However, my mother used to make this for another purpose.  She would take vanilla wafers and spoon a little of the sauce over each one and then dip the top in shredded coconut.  It makes fabulous cookies that are very impressive for something like a shower.

This is more like dulce de leche than caramel sauce. A word of warning, as I don't think this recipe states it clearly enough, you must ensure that there is always water covering the can. The water will boil off within time, so you'll need to keep adding water so that the entire can is always submerged. If you let it boil without being submerged, it causes the pressure in the can to increase and it will explode.

I tried this recipe because I needed caramel sauce and had condensed milk on hand but no heavy cream.  And it's OK...  Sweet, sticky caramel sauce -probably good for kids' ice cream, or something like that.  But if you're looking for  the depth of flavour in traditional caramel sauce, you're going to be disappointed.  I probably won't make this again.

After reading Moonbeagle's review, I too opted to use a double boiler. To cut down on the sweetness, I add a pinch of salt. I also add a 1/2tsp. vanilla. The recipe is so easy and good, and what a relief to not have to stand constantly over the stove!!!

Read all the reviews and went ahead and prepared as stated.  Nothing exploded and I didn't turn the can either.  I didn't even have to top off the can with more water.  Just got super creamy smooth caramel.  LOVE IT!!!  No more store bought caramel for me.

I decided to try this recipe as I don't keep cream on hand to make "true" caramel. I made this per the suggestion of foxtell8: I simmered the unopened can for 3 hours and removed pan from heat to cool completely. The next day, I opened the can with no problems and dumped the thick caramel into a bowl to eat with apples. My husband flipped over it and my kids (11, 9, 7, 5, 2) all couldn't get enough. I didn't care for it as it retained that sweetened condensed milk flavor. I will probably make it again for the family as the SCM is something I keep in the pantry.

Like many others, I learned this from my mother back in the 1950s. Works great. Concerning fears that result from reading manufacturers' websites: PLEASE be aware that, because fear of liability lawsuits virtually controls the way commerce works in this country, you must take manufacturers' comments with large helpings of salt. If it is even remotely possible that something even slightly negative could happen from someone's heating the milk with the can intact, the company will warn you not to do it. I've done it for decades, with no problem. But I echo others' suggestions: let it cool slowly before opening. I store it in the fridge and, when I have a sweet craving, eat a spoonful. Better than candy!

I know this recipe as dulce de leche, a Mexican caramel sauce.  It's for sure not the same as the caramel sauce you may have had on your ice cream sundae - different, but good.

This worked great for me!  It came out creamy and delicious.  Did not taste like butterscotch to me at all...had no issues with cooking in the can.  I never let it go past a simmer once the water originally boiled...definitely a keeper recipe...thanks to whoever posted this!!!

I agree with LLCH - it does tend to be on the sweet side. And I especially agree with OFIESTY - it's better to be safe than sorry. I actually cooked mine in a double boiler. Let it simmer for 1.5 hours, and it turned out like advertised. Next time though, I think I'll just melt some caramels...it's a lot quicker.

Made this last night.  Was very rich and tasted good.  Was on the thick side so I added a little extra milk to thin it down.  Hubby liked it to.  A little time consuming.  Wish it could be done in less time.

as a russian american i grew up with this and have never witnessed a can explode and only heard one story of a can exploding and thats all
if u get a big pot of water where the water takes forever to boil out u wont need to babysit it as much 
as long as its covered in plenty of water its all good 
the one story happened during a teenage party when ppl became preoccupied with other things
also the longer it cooks the more we like it
its awesome for dipping apples

This is good but it is not caramel, it's dulce de leche.  You can also cook it in the pressure cooker in about 25 minutes instead of three hours.

This was great.  I didnt even bother turning the can.  When I opened the can, the sauce was super thick and rich.  I mixed with some milk and rum extract to make a "sauce" for breadpudding.

We used to make this on our hippy trip in the 70's!! We boiled it in the tin for an hour then scooped it into a graham wafer crust then covered the top with sliced bananas - yum! Thanks for the blast from the past!

I have to agree with Caroline C. I use this method every year for Caramel Apples on Halloween. The kids love it and I nor have they ever gotten sick from this. I grew up with my mother doing the same thing and I am still living.

Let me just say it is VERY dangerous to heat up ANYTHING in an unopened can! Curious to see what some were talking about, however, I decided to try this recipe.   While waiting the 3 HOURS for this "caramel sauce" to develop, it reminded me of when we were kids and we got the bright idea of heating up a can of Spagettios in this fashion.  To this day, we're still thanking our lucky stars that none of us were near the stove when the lid burst off of that can, shooting hot spaghetti all over the kitchen. It took a week to clean it all up, and 25 years later, we can still see the dent on Mama's ceiling from that flying lid as we stand there shaking our heads in amazement.
Based on the poor results I had with this recipe, I think 3 hours was a terrible waste of time and fuel for a few ounces of thin, gloppy "caramel sauce" that really can't be used for much.  I think I'll just continue buying my caramel sauce retail.

WOW! Made Grandma's apple bread pudding but I wasn't up for the vanilla sauce, so I made this. I make my bread pudding in the crock pot...takes about 3 hours on low, so this was perfect.  I also did 2 cans, but will do more next time!  I let it cool for about 30 minutes in cold water...was perfect temp to put on the warm pudding!

I thought this was a novel idea and found it because I had a partial can of condensed milk left from another recipe and didn't want to waste it.  It turned out okay, it just seems a little silly to babysit this thing for 3 hours when I can buy a jar of caramel sauce ready to go for less than $2, or make a faster version with just a few ingredients.  Besides all that, this caramel sauce is extremely sweet.

WARNING! Superb carmel pudding/sauce BUT do set your timer--and be sure to have a deep pot with plenty of water to cover the can. I put the kids to bed, (husband was out of town), put the sweetened condensed milk in a pot covered with water and settled down with a good book. I was lost in time until an explosion in the kitchen reminded me of what I was cooking. The can had exploded sending pudding ALL over the kitchen. I scrubbed the kitchen--floor to ceiling until 2 am. Set a timer if you cook this delicious treat.

I make caramel the same way to make banna caramel pie, except when I make the caramel I put a facecloth at the bottom of the pot so that the caramel dosen't burn when it's touching the can..  I also keep mine at a rolling boil  To make banna caramel pie you make a gram cracker crust, fill it with the caramel sauce from this recipe, then top with whip cream and a light dusting of cinamon..and wala :)

This is a really easy way to make arequipe or dulce de leche, the traditional way takes hours and hours of constant stirring, but with this, I only had to put more water in about twice. Tip: Since different brands of sweetened condensed milk have different densities, they'll need different cooking times; if the sweetened condensed milk is very dense and compact, it'll need a shorter cooking time. Obviously you can't open the can to check the density before cooking, so knowing your brand comes in handy. :) PS: didn't have any trouble with the unopened can.

This is how I make "Dulce De Leche" (after cooking I sprinkle in some Vanilla and Brandy). If in a rush I use one of other reviewers suggestion but putting the cans in a pressure cooker covers with water and cook up to 45 minute. If not in a rush, I use another reviewers suggestion and use a crock pot/slow cooker on high and cook for 3-3.5 hours (an hour less if you use boiling water), no need to worry about water running dry. You can put the very hot cans in a cold water bath to hasten cooling. Super easy & super good either way.

I made three cans of this last night.  I used a stock pot with a lid, never had to top it off.  I used PET milk and two generic cans from Wally world. I let them cool overnight and they turned out great!

I had high hopes when I made this, but when I opened the can it was not what I expected. It's not a sauce first of all, it's thick and custard like. And the tasts is very sharp, like a caramel concentrate. It didn't taste very good on anything.
 If you still want to make it I suggest using a metal strainer (like you would use to steam vegetables) in the bottom of a pot of water, that way the can is never directly exposed to the bottom of the pot, that's if you don't have a double boiler.
 All in all, it was easy to make, but not worth the time.

This caramel sauce turned out as said, however I did not like the taste of it. It reminded me of Cajeta with goats  milk. I will probably just buy store bought from now on.

This is very good.  My recipe says to boil it for four hours.  Very easy to do.   We slice the milk/caramel and top with ice cream.  Great spread on crackers too.

The country Peru has been doing this for a lifetime, all you have to do is put it in a pot of water with a lid and boil for 3-4 hours depending on how dark you want it

I have used this method several times without a problem. Once, however, I did it without thinking it through and opened the can before it had completely cooled with the result being a squirt of hot caramel coming out onto my face. Very painful! However, if you are careful to allow the can to cool completely before attempting to open you will have a very safe and delicious caramel sauce!

Use a crock pot on low for 8 hrs. Set it and forget it.

Just made this for the first time last night. It came out perfect. I will never buy carmel dip again. I used a 3 gallon stock pot with a lid so I never had to add water. Just dropped the cans in and walked away. After 3 hours I took it off the stove and let it cool. Tested it with an apple. Delicious!

This is the perfect way to make caramel, and is a great base for caramel pie (ala O'Charley's); however, follow the instructions carefully and, ideally, let your can cool for an hour before opening.

Made this to go on my cheesecake today & it is so easy.  Fantastic finish, great flavor and now I can't keep my husband out of it.  Almost too easy to be true.  The same caramel flavor that I remember as a kid.

This isn't a caramel sauce recipe. It's a recipe for something called Dulce De Leche, used by us hispanic people for cakes and pastries. Caramel sauce is a totally different thing. However, this is definitely a delicious recipe I've known since I was a child. You can even serve it with crackers, bread and-my favourite-PANCAKES!!!!
