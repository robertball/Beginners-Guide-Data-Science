I made this recipe as a side dish - it has great flavor but is a little wet.  I had to cook it about 10 minutes longer in order for it to dry out.

Not only was this the most complimented dish at my Thanksgiving table last year, it is the one dish that I can't stop thinking about for this year! It is so good, it even beats my own mother's recipe. I really love this dish. Totally worth the cost of the oysters! Yum!

Made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas last year and will be making it again this year. I had to double it because it went so fast.

The taste was there but it was runny and just didn't seem like a dressing. I thought it was a waste of expensive oysters. To salvage the dish I had to pull them out and put them in a seasoned batter and flash fry them.

This was soooo good! I'm making it again with roasted chicken four days after thanksgiving. I find that you must use eastern oysters, I made it with both pacific and eastern, the eastern made a huge difference

My paternal grandmother and then mom, made this every Christmas eve dinner since I was a little girl.  We didn't add Worcestershire sauce so I'll have to try that.   Sadly my mom passed away this year so I'll be carrying on the tradition.  After reading a few recipes here, I'm going to use this as the base and add, celery, onion and some poultry seasonings.

This is basically my scalloped oyster dressing that I have been making for 40 years or more.  My only change is to add a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the cream before pouring it over the oysters.  Not everyone likes them but that's alright with my son and law and myself - all the more for us.
