This cake is the best!  I read a lot of reviews and here is the advice I followed:  Do Not Over Mix the batter or it will fall apart!  Check cake 20 min. into baking, didn't take the 30 min. the recipe called for.  Make 1 1/2 amount of frosting.  Add more cornstarch to thicken up frosting or add instant Vanilla pudding.  I didn't add pudding, because I wasn't sure WHEN to add it in.  Frosting took approx. 30 min. to cook and longer to cool.  Plan on investing a good amount of time into it.  (But it is well worth it!)  Toast the coconut and pecans.  Something new I discovered while making this:  I must have over mixed because I had trouble getting the cake out of the pan.  The bottom layer began to crumble.  I stuck the other two pans in the freezer for approx. 1 hr?  To remove the frozen cake I placed a towel soaked in very hot water on the pan and it came right out!  The cake is easy to handle while frozen and thawed out in the time it took to me to frost it. (I took a good amount of time frosting it)  Freezing it didn't dry it out.  It tasted and looked amazing!  Hope this helps!

My son and I made this cake for a friend whose favorite cake is German Chocolate.  He's a great cook himself, and so is VERY fussy about his food.  This cake turned out GREAT, and my friend was very complimentary of it!  Since a mixer part was missing in action, we did all the mixing and beating by hand, and it still turned out just fine.  It was very moist, had great shape and texture, and looked beautiful after adding the chocolate drizzle. 

The next time I make it, though, I will ADD TWO EXTRA OUNCES OF CHOCOLATE TO THE CAKE MIXTURE, to make it just a touch chocolate-ier.  Also, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE ONE AND A HALF RECIPES OF THE FILLING/FROSTING. One recipe of it would not be enough, and 1 1/2 is just right.  Also, TOAST THE COCONUT AND PECANS.  That makes them much, much better.  Be careful about burning the coconut.  It toasts very quickly.  A great cake that we will probably make a lot!  Well worth the trouble.

This cake was awesome.  I had a profesional baker make my wife a german chocolate cake for her birthday.  This cake tasted so much better than that one.  My wife loves german chcolate cake and she said is was the best she has ever eaten.  I dobled the icing it looks like alot when you make it, but it turned out just right.  Also I used a little more chocolate on the top of the cake.  I had to turn the heat up to get the icing to start boiling, but it turned out great.  I recomend this cake very highly.

Upon researching for hours for a German Chocolate cake recipe worth the time to make and choosing this one, I bought the "Bakers" German sweet chocolate bar for use in this cake.  After opening the box of chocolate, there are recipes in there for frosting, cake and a few others using this chocolate.  Lo and behold the cake recipe they print is exactly the same as this one except this one says to use cake flour and 1/2 cup more of it.  Other than that it's exact.  I know this will be delicious as I've made this (the one off the box) years ago and it was awesome.  German Choc. cake is my all time favorite cake but is very time consuming to make by scratch so I don't make it often.  The frosting on the box is also worth the mention as there isn't one on this site that really stands out for such an exceptional cake.  It appears to resemble the Ger. Choc. cake frosting II on this site but it makes more which you would need for a proper 3 layer cake. I would suggest using the frosting recipe on the box and you won't be dissapointed. At least Dean knows his recipe for German Chocolate Cake!!

Great Cake! I read the reviews and agreed with these suggestions. It's a must to toast the coconut and pecans. A little salt to the icing would bring out the flavor better...so I added 1/4 teaspoon. I should mention that I mixed 1-1/2 times the icing recipe. I had no problem getting the icing to thicken, but it's important to bring your initial ingredients to a boil while stirring constantly. As soon as it starts to boil you can see it's thickening. Once it's cools and you add the coconut and pecans...it's plenty thick. I also put mine in the refrigerator to set up even better. The cake batter provides enough to more than fill 2- 9" pans. Make sure you use CAKE flour not all purpose flour, it does make a difference. If you can't find cake flour, try bulk bins or go to your instore bakeries and ask them to sell you some. I found that the recipe produces too much batter and the cake rose over the edges of the pan and got crispy. ( not what you want on a cake )This also increases your baking time which is also what you do not want because it will make your cake drier. Next time I will remove 1/4 to 1/3 cup of batter off each 9" pan, that should make it perfect. The cake rises high and beautiful, I was very impressed! Lastly, I agreed that the cake was much better the next day..it got even more moist.I would make this cake the day before a special event to maximize the pleasure of this moist cake. I now believe I can make a cake from scratch with the moistness of a "box" cake! ..

I decided to make this cake for our anniversary after my husband told me that this was his favorite cake. This cake was very good, light and moist. However, I did follow the advice of others and made more filling. I used 1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 3/4 cup butter, 4 slightly beated egg yolks, 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 2 1/3 cup coconut, 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans, and 2 tbsp. instant vanilla pudding. I followed the directions except I cooked on medium heat for about 12 minutes. The coconut and pecans were added after removing from heat.  This made enough filling/frosting for between the layers and on top. Next time I will double Dean's recipe (adding the vanilla pudding and cooking on medium heat) so that I can have enough to frost the cake and omit the chocolate drizzle. We were not too crazy about that part.

I have made this cake for the cafe and my family over a hundred times now. You can make it as is, and it is excellent, or you can deviate. First word of advice: DO NOT FROST THE SIDES OR TOP OF THIS CAKE. It has a wonderful rustic look if you frost ONLY the internal layers. The chocolate topping is made with FAR too few squares of chocolate. Add extra, and for each extra you add, add an additional 1/2 teaspoon of shortening. I like to create a ganache shell on top of my cake, so I pour chocolate there and spread it super thin, then drizzle chocolate down the size. It gives it a beautiful, rustic-artisan look. You can decorate the top of the cake by SPARINGLY sprinkling raw or toasted coconut (or chopped nuts) on top of the cake and then drizzling additional chocolate in a crisscross pattern over the top of that. Feel free to deviate in nuts you use - I often use hazelnuts along with pecans. I also often toast my coconut instead of using plain raw coconut. This will drastically change the flavors of the cake, but it's always fun to deviate once in a while. Also, when you make your layers, place parchment paper on the bottom of your pans. Put the pan, cake and all, in the freezer until frozen. Place the bottom of the pan in hot water for about 10 to 20 seconds. This will warm the bottom of the cake. Remove the layers, remove the parchment paper, and cut the bulb off the top of each layer to make a perfectly round, flat layer. This will increase presentability by 100%!

Let me tell you - FIVE stars doesn't do justice! This was the first time I made a cake so involved, but it was well worth it. I made this for my Grandmother's 71st birthday. My Grandma and Uncle fought over the last piece. I left with an empty cake platter and was told not to return without another cake! Just follow the recipe exactly! Also, I couldn't find 'German' chocolate at my market, So I used Ghirardelli's Bittersweet Chocolate and it was perfect!

The recipe for German Chocolate Cake is on the bar of the Bakers German Chocolate Bar.  Everything is the same except this recipe calls for 1/2 cup more flour(cake) and 1/4 teaspoon more salt.  This recipe was ok, not as moist, flavorful or buttery as the recipe calling for 2 cups of flour. I did use cake flour, recommended.  I was quite disappointed and everyone said that my old recipe was so much better.  i definitely agree.  The chocolate color was not as intense (lighter brown) and cake tasted dry.  I also toasted the pecans but I  like the non toasted taste better for this cake.  Will not try this recipe again but rather will stick by my old recipe.  It is so much better.  The frosting can be made the day before (used the recipe on the German chocolate bar).  It is delicious, ample enough to frost the entire cake.

Wonderful, and fairly easy to make, if a little time consuming.  Worth it, though.  I haven't actually tasted it yet, as I made it for a friend's birthday, but it looks great and the crumbly bits that fell off while I was transferring the cakes to the plate were nummy.  The frosting came out to a pretty good consistency, especially if you chill it.  I doubled the frosting recipe, too.  If you make more than the original amount of frosting, keep in mind you'll need a good half hour in front of the stove to get it to thicken.  I kept it at medium-low to medium to speed it up a bit, but I didn't want to burn it either.  

All in all, gorgeous cake, tastes great!

this was rather good. My husband loved this recipe in which I made for his birthday. I wouldn't change a thing. I made it to a T and the next time, I make this for him I will add chocolate frosting around the sides. But as is...it was delish. I had no problems with following the recipe what so ever.

German chocolate cake is my hubby's favorite, so for his birthday last week, I thought I'd suprise him with.  After having experimented with several different German chocolate cake recipes in the past few years, this one was my favorite in terms of taste.  However, I ended up having to make the cake twice.  I followed the recipe to a "T" the first time, but when it came time to remove the cakes from the pans, they were horribly stuck, despite my having greased and floured the pans well.  I managed to salvage most of the cakes, but they were terribly crumbly.  I figured I could hide the crumbled appearance with the frosting, but when I did, the whole thing literally fell into pieces.  It was beyond hope trying to fix it, so I had to throw the whole thing away (after, of course, enjoying a few pieces of crumbled, but heavenly tasting cake).  At this point, I felt bad for not having a birthday cake to present to my husband, so I decided to try it again.  I repeated everything, but this time, omitted the water when I melted the chocolate (I was always taught never to add water to chocolate when melting).  I also lined the bottom of the pans with parchment paper cut to size, and just greased the sides with Pam.  Finally, I had inadvertently run out of sugar when I started on the frosting, so I substituted brown sugar. (I also doubled the amount of frosting.) The second version came out better than the first -- the cake was springier, and less crumbly, did not stick at all, and the

I was a little worried about this recipe, because a few of the previous reviewers said it was dry.  But I thought I'd try it anyway, because it was the only one I could find that called for cake flour rather than all-purpose.Boy, am I glad I did  This was one of the lightest, moistest cakes I've made in 35 years of baking.


I only made a single batch of filling, but I stirred in about 1/2 cup more coconut and nuts than called for, and it ended up being exactly the right amount for the top and between the layers.

Difficulty wise, I'd place it around an intermediate level.  It is kind of time consuming, though.  It took me almost exactly 3 hours from the time I started till I finished the cleanup process.  BUT it took several more hours after that for the filling to cool enough to assemble the cake.  I ended up wrapping the cake layers in plastic so they wouldn't dry out before I could put the filling on them.  The next time I make this, I'll make the filling up the day before, so it's ready to go.  As another reviewer mentioned, it takes about 1/2 hour to actually make the filling, so just set that amount of time aside either the day before or several hours before you plan on making the cake, so it has time to cool, and you'll be fine.

If you're having trouble with getting "stuck" cakes out of the pans, try this:   Use non-stick spray to coat the pans.   Take a piece of parchment paper and cut it to fit the inside of the pan.   Your cakes will release with no trouble at all!    Remember to chill your cake rounds before frosting.  It will adhere better and you'll have less chance of the layers "sliding."
Here's another alternate to the frosting:
1 cup heavy cream or evaporated milk
2 cups or 1 1/2 bags individual caramel candies, unwrapped
2 1/2 cups chopped, toasted pecans
2 1/2 cups sweetened shredded coconut

Heat the cream un a medium saucepan over medium heat until it simmers; add the caramels and stir until it melts.  Bring the mixture to a boil and remove it from the heat.  Stir in the pecans and coconut.  Let cool slightly before icing cake.

This turned out great.  I am glad that I read some reviews first and took the cakes out at 20 min.  I didn't use the chocolate glaze, figured it was sweet enough!  I wished they would have given a time on the frosting as I finally stopped cooking after 30 minutes and a phone call to my mom!  So 30 minutes is more than enough.

This is the same recipe on the Germans Sweet Chocolate Box. I've been making it for a few years now, exactly as it is written, with no problems. Actually, the only time I had issues with the cake falling apart easily is when I used Cake flour. I began making this recipe using cake flour even though the original recipe called for all purpose flour. Once I decided to make it using all purpous flour it always comes out perfect.  I usually choose a recipe that has the highest rating but that's pretty pointless on this site because I ALWAYS find reviews where the reviewer is basically commenting on their own recipe! That is so annoying. Bake/Cook the recipe as is and then comment! How hard can that be? You can always post your own version as well. But the reviews are misleading when what we are reading is always somebody's version or the original recipe....wth is that about?!

This was an excellent cake - very moist yet the texture also had a lightness to it.    First of all,  after reading several reviews of this recipe and looking at the pictures posted by others, I decided to use the filling between the layers and on the top (instead of spreading it all over the sides of the cake)    I thought this made for a much prettier  presentation.  I made 1 1/2 the amount of filling - just to be safe and prepared it the day before making the cake and was glad that I did.  Do be prepared to babysit and stir the filling as it thickens for about 40 minutes.  I let it cool, added the pecans, coconut and kept it in the refrigerator overnight.  I then made sure I took it out early enough so that it came back up to room temperature before putting it on the cake.   The filling was perfect and the amount I made was more than enough to fill the layers and the top.  Instead of prepping the cake pans with the usual grease/flour combo,  I used butter, a bit of cooking spray and cocoa powder so that the sides of the cake wouldn't have that floury pasty look.  They were perfectly done at about 27 min and I let them cool for just the 10 minutes before trying to remove them.  These cakes are delicate and will crumble easily. I took a butter knive and circled around between the outside of the cakes and edges of the pans to make the removal a bit easier.  Only a tiny bit in the middle stuck to the bottom of the pans - nothing that couldn't be dealt with.

This is the recipe off the German's Chocolate box (except this one uses cake flour + 1/2 cup more).  Hmmmm...anyway. I tweaked and simplified this recipe a bit. For the batter, I used 1/4 cup cocoa instead of chocolate, added an extra 3 tablespoons of butter, and an extra 1/4 cup sugar.  I used 2 cups regular flour and didn't separate the eggs - I just beat the mix after adding each egg.  For the frosting, I subbed the 1 cup evaporated milk with 1 (14 oz.) can of sweetened condensed milk.  I skipped the drizzled chocolate step.  I didn't have 3 9-inch pans, so I used 2 8-inch springforms.  I baked them for almost an hour!  Good and moist!

That was a very, very good cake!  It did cost a bit because of all the special items (coconut, evaporated milk, german chocolate).  Very tasty.  I've never had an official German Chocolate cake, so I can't compare, but it tasted great.  I stuck the cakes in the freezer until they were stiff enough to deal with.  Hint:  The frosting has to cool A LOT before you can use it.  I had it in the fridge for an hour before it was stiff enough.

Fun to make and wonderful tasting, everyone loved it at a family party. Just follow the recipe and don’t over mix the batter! The cake will fall.

I am a professional baker and always follow a recipe as written the first time I bake it, and when I review it. I set timer for 20 minutes, and cake was burnt. My fault for not checking, but I have never cooked a cake that fast! So, I tried again, cake came out ok. I did 2 batches of the icing, the first I must have cooked for 45 minutes and it never got thick. I took it off the heat and it thickened enough to use. The second I upped the heat to medium low, and cooked longer, still never got thick. I made this for a friend, I am not a german chocolate fan. The cake was very light and had good texture, but was a bit dry even though not over cooked. The frosting was thin but had good flavor and soaked into the cake a bit to help with moisture. It definitely needs tweaking, so if you are going to make, use some of the advice given! It is close, but impo not there yet.

Incredible!!!! This was delicious and tasted straight out of a bakery. (I read previous reviews regarding the filling so I made 50 % more and added 2 tbls. of instant vanilla pudding - it was fantastic. Also, I ran the pecans through my salad shooter and then toasted them lightly on a cookie sheet before adding to the frosting.)The cake is light as a feather but so rich in taste and has a silky texture. It was gone in less than a day. *** It is not a fast recipe, but well worth the time & effort. (I have to add that my son asked why we were having "oatmeal cake" for dessert -  he thought the frosting was oatmeal!!)
They are already asking when I will make it again.

My daughter requested german chocolate cupcakes for her birthday and I found this recipe.  I halved it (which makes 12 large cupcakes or 48 mini-cupcakes) but followed everything else exactly. I was surprised that any of the batter found its way into the cupcake pan - best cake batter ever :)...  However everyone LOVED the cupcakes, even made someone who claimed they didn't like german chocolate cake ask for them for HIS birthday!  Best cake recipe I've found so far :)  thanks for sharing.  (for the mini-cupcakes i bake them for 18 min @ 350)

This is the best German Chocolate Cake I have ever made or for that matter tasted. I have never toasted the coconut before so I thought I would try it, it made all the difference instead of chewy stick in your teeth it was great flavor and never was chewy or got stuck in your teeth. Great Job Dean! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE!!!

This was a pretty good cake.  That said, next time I make it, I will do a few things differently.  
1. double the german chocolate (and yes, I did use a full 4 oz.).  I didn't care for the cake itself as much as I liked the frosting.  My brother, who lived in germany, said that germans don't like sweets, and find american cakes to  be too sweet, so this cake is true german chocolate cake.  
2. Nix the ganache....  the ganache made the cake more acceptable, but with a more chocolately cake, this wouldn't be necessary.
3. I did as others suggested and toasted the coconut and pecans.  I HIGHLY recommend everyone doing this.

A few suggestions on the frosting...
Mine WAS thin.  I cooked it on low for 20 minutes.  Then I added 2 tsp. of cornstarch.  It still didn't thicken.  Well, the starch has to boil before it can thicken, SO, after I let the frosting cook, I turned it up to high (this ensured that the egg cooked before I turned up the heat).  It thickened pretty good after that, and the coconut and pecans helped after that, but if I hadn't turned up the heat, It would not have thickened.

Ok, so I have made this cake about 10 times.  I love this cake. Add extra chocolate if you like but don't forget the baking soda(I opps one time). This is not an easy recipe (I use two mixers for it).  I found that if you make 1 1/2 the times the icing you have more than enough.  Also, once the icing is hot, I add the pecans in (it gives a great nutty flavor). And about the icing just stir alot and heat it up slow so that you don't end up with scrambled egg yolks and milk, yuck!! I made two cakes and took them to work. This taste like Grandma made it, not too sweet, but so wonderful!!

Got RAVED reviews at Thanksgiving today!!!  This cake is the exact recipe on the back of the Baker's german chocolate box, but this is the filling recipe on the back of the box.  I recommend you use it as it makes for more (quite enough) filling:  4 egg yolks 1 can  (12 oz.) evaporated milk 1-1/2 tsp. vanilla 1-1/2 cups  sugar 3/4 cup (1-1/2 sticks) butter or margarine 1 pkg.  (7 oz.) BAKER'S ANGEL FLAKE Coconut (about 2-2/3 cups) 1-1/2 cups PLANTERS Chopped Pecans

I found this same cake recipe (frosting is different) in our local newspaper's Sunday Living section about 30 years ago. Not sure where they got it, but it is a phenomenal cake...if done correctly...and yes, it is a labor intensive cake, but so worth it.
For those having difficulty, the common problems seem to be:
Cake flattening:  Gently fold *all* of the egg whites into the batter.  Otherwise, the cake has a tendency to flatten some as the egg whites are what gives the cake its lift.  The batter will have some streaks (not many) of white in it.  I'm not sure what the point is of first gently folding part in and then beating the daylights out of it when you add the rest.
Icing not sticking to sides:  You do not ice the side of a traditional GC cake, although some bakeries put a chocolate frosting on the sides (yuck).
Icing not thickening:  It wasn't cooked or possibly cooled enough.  It should be cooked until it has a golden color and you need to put it in a mixer (I use my kitchen aid with the flat blade) and slowly beat it until it cools completely.
Depth of chocolate flavor:  Pre-make cake mixes and bakeries have conditioned people to deep chocolate cake as german chocolate.  Sorry, but the original german chocolate cake was developed by a man who used a sweet german chocolate (which the baker's company named after him)...not semi-sweet, milk or any other type.  So if you want 'german' chocolate, this (or the recipe on the baker's box) is the original.

In all the years I've been using Allrecipes, this is the first rating I've ever given...and for good reason.  Even though this cake tasted ok, this was probably the worst cake I've ever made ... and I make a LOT of cakes.  I rarely cook w/ nuts, so when I was asked to make a German Chocolate cake, I decided to use a standard German Chocolate cake recipe as well ... BIG MISTAKE.  Even after reading the other reviews for a few handy tips, all three layers sunk while IN THE OVEN still... and when I took the layers out of the pans, they disintegrated.  I have some great chocolate cake recipes that would have been fabulous w/ a German Chocolate frosting recipe ... a huge amount of frustration.

Great recipe. My advice to you... -instead of 4oz of chocolate put 6oz (for chocolate lovers) - 1-1/2 on frosting (so that you can wrap around cake) -You do not need corn starch as some have advised for the frosting. Just allow it to boil and it will thicken. -slightly toast the pecans and coconut flakes. -You can skip the chocolate drizzle at the end or shave some chocolate and add it to the top to make it look like the ones you buy at stores. - ENJOY!

The cake itself was delicious, but not the best I've had. But it sure looked gorgeous!! I used whipped cream cream cheese frosting for the top decorated it with chocolate curls. The original idea was to frost the side, but it looked pretty as it is :). I didnt have any problems at all with thickening the filling, 12 minutes as other reviewer sugested was a bit too long. I think the problem might lay on the eggs, since egg is the thickener, it shouldn't curdle. To prevent that, I boiled the milk mixture without the eggs, switched it off when it boiled, added the eggs slowly, then switched the fire on again. I posted pictures of my filling on the Chantilly Frosting recipe (it's exactly the same except for the macadamia). In the end it was a bit lumpy (maybe I boiled it too hard?), so I used my hand blender to make it smooth and glossy again. I also replaced half sugar with brown sugar (after checking out other german chocolate cake recipes), and the taste blended nicely with coconut. This is definitely NOT a cake to make when you're in a hurry though!!

I didn't make the frosting (pecans are SO expensive, who knew?) but did make the cake. It was good, but for all the work.. I don't know. I wasn't super thrilled. Not too different from baking a simple cake-mix, but I'm sure the frosting really makes the cake, so maybe I'm not one to rate this. If I make it again I will def have to make the frosting recipe as well.

This cake turned out amazing! I made it with three layers and I froze the layers before frosting them. I needed to make extra frosting to have enough, so I did 1.5 times the suggested amount. There was just enough to put frosting in between each layer and cover the sides and top. I made chocolate garnishes for the top of the cake by melting chocolate onto the back of a cookie sheet and then using a flat edged spatula, i made chocolate curls. Also, I melted chocolate and poured it over the edges of the cake for a finished look.

I enjoyed making this cake, it was a fun project. I adjusted things based on some of the reviews. 1st I used wax paper to line the bottom of the pans. This really helped when removing them from the pans. The cake came out perfect, but I had to cook an extra 5 -10 minutes since I used three 8 1/2" pans. The frosting was a little tricky since, I keep waiting for it to thicken. I was used certain of the consistancy, never had made it before. I did used some cornstarch like suggested. When I put the coconut & pecans in, that seemed what bound it all together. I did make 1 1/2 times the recipe & that amount was perfect to frost the whole cake. I used coconut oil & chocolate for the drizzle. I brought is over to the superbowl party & it seemed to be a big hit.

Absolutley delicious. I have a cake business on the side and only make cakes from scratch. I toasted the coconut and pecans, I also doubled the icing recipe and made it a 4 layer cake. There is no need to add corn starch like someone else commented, just cook it a little longer. Beautiful...eye appealing and delicious!

I made this cake for my wife's birthday.  It turned out great!  The layers are very delicate, so be careful when handling.  The filling worked fine for me, but I turned up the heat and brought it to a gentle boil while stirring constantly and it thickened up fine!  My wife said it was the best cake she had ever tasted!

This recipe is AWESOME!  Set aside some preparation time, but every single minute
is well worth it - everyone is raving about this cake!  Each slice tastes like heaven
and I found myself left without any cake because everyone ate it in a flash.  I doubled the
frosting recipe which allowed my new baking fans to drizzle the extra over each individual
slice.  I recommend this amazing cake to everyone!

I made this for my Dad's birthday and he said I could make money selling it! The only thing is the frosting wouldn't stay put, it kept sliding down the side of the cake. Maybe I did something wrong. It didn't affect the taste of the cake though...Definitely a keeper!

Wow! I made the cake just as instructed but increased the frosting by 1/2 like other reviewers said to do. The cake alone was wonderful, it had the perfect moist, springy texture and the taste was so good. I did spray the cake pans with baking Pam and lined them with parchment paper and baked for 27 minutes. Perfect! The frosting was rich and buttery. I did toast the pecans and coconut before adding to the frosting. I used 1 1/2 cups sugar, a whole 12 oz. can of evaporated milk (1 1/2 cups), 3/4 cups butter, 4 beaten egg yolks, 1 1/2 cups flaked coconut and pecans. I started the frosting on low and gradually increased it to medium to boil, as to not scramble the eggs and put it back to low and stirred for about 20 minutes. Wonderful cake!

Made for my boss and she wanted to know where I purchased it!   Used the 6 oz of German Choc as someone else recommended.  Buttered and dusted the pans with cocoa.  Baking time of 25 minutes.  Toased the coconut and pecans for the icing.  Doubled the icing recipe althhough 1.5 times would have been fine if not doing the sides. 
Looked fab. and she said it was amazing!!

This was fabulous.  I lined my pans (just the bottom) with parchment paper because people had mentioned that they had a hard time with the cake crumbling.  I had no issues.  Also, I felt that there was more than enough icing if you are just putting it between the layers and on top.

A beautiful, tasty cake!

Tasted and looked like a masterpeice. I made 1 1/2 times the frosting recipe, lightly toasted the pecans, used fresh frozen coconut (Brids Eye about 10 oz, a little less than 2 packages), inadvertantly used 4 egg yolks in the batter rather than 3 and 2 0z of chocolate to drizzle on top.  The cake was lightly moist and tasty, just perfect really.  The frosting was just perfect as well, not overly.  Lightly toasting the pecans is a must imo.  My only issue was that the frosting didn't turn a golden brown while cooking and didn't seem to get very thick.  I thought I'd have runny frosting but it did set up and was a perfect consistency.  However it did take awhile to set, maybe an hour or longer so you need to take this in to account in planning.

wonderful! like many reviewers suggested, i made 1.5x the amount of frosting. i also added 2 tbsp of cornstarch mixed with 1/4 c of water and then brought it to a boil to thicken it up and refrigerated it a while before putting it on the cake.

Excellent recipe! I baked this cake for my husband, which comes from a family of bakers, and he absolutely loved it! I made 1.5x the required amount of filling as per the recommendations, but next time, I will double the amount.  Otherwise, the cake was perfect!

I am a professional baker and my client wanted a German Chocolate cake, which I have never made before, so I used this recipe...It was terrible!  It was too floury and not moist at all.  I never uses recipes for my cakes, but I know German Chocolate is different than a regular chocolate cake.  I will not be using this recipe again...I will just stick with my own dark chocolate cake and make my own icing to create a German Chocolate Cake.  I would rather use a box cake mix for this type of cake, rather than use this recipe:-(

Delicious!  Didn't change a thing.  This cake needs to set for at least a few hours before serving to let the frosting settle and the flavor come out.  I'd suggest making it a day ahead.

The recipe is excellent want many people may  not realize who are making the cake is that they mean total of 4 oz of German chocolate. The mean 4 pieces of German chocolate that are 1 oz. If the recipe is followed correctly it will be chocolatey enought

this was absolutely THE BEST german chocolate cake i had ever made or tasted.. hands down.

moist, tender, flavorful, perfect springy texture, yet dense in a most delicate way.. CAKE FLOUR is a must for the best results.. added 3 more squares of chocolate, per many of the reviews i read beforehand..and i also doubled the icing recipe, and had a bit too much, but it just made my cake that much more decadent because the icing is also fantastic.  will make again and again.

This cake was amazing, I followed the recipe exactly. The cake is very rich, and I like rich sweets, and I don't think it needed the extra filling at all. I made the cake for my dad's bday and everyone who tried it absolutely loved it, I will NEVER make german chocolate cake from a box again. This cake takes a little time, but sooo worth it.

My husband is a fan of German Chocolate cake so I made this for his birthday instead of the usual box variety. Without a doubt this recipe is the reason made from scratch cakes taste so much better!! I will tell you though that this recipe is time consuming! And maybe even more so if you are like me with little ones running around--but it will be worth it. I did not have cake flour so I went to "Martha's" website and found this conversion--For 1 cup of cake flour, you can substitute with 1 cup minus two tablespoons of all-purpose flour, which you should sift 3 or 4 times--And it worked out just fine. I also added more coconut, and pecans to the topping, and melted another ounce of chocolate to drizzle. MMMMMMMMMMM.....THE BEST!

I don't typically care for German Chocolate cake but my husband wanted one for his birthday.  After seeing the rave reviews I figured this was worth the effort.  

We both agree this is the best cake we have ever tasted, bar none.  It was gone in no time.  He's asked me (repeatedly) to be sure and save this one.

I made 1.5 x the icing that the recipe calls for, and had a bit left over.  I had no troubles getting the icing to "set" but it's not going to be a thick icing that you can spread on the sides of the cake, and you do have to cook it until it's well thickened and wait (and wait) for it to cool.

The texture is very smooth, almost like pound cake, but not heavy.  Velvety.

I doubled the chocolate drizzle (not necessary) and I would encourage everyone not to skip this last step.  It makes for a beautiful presentation.

I made this for my friend's birthday and we both absolutely loved it.  The cake is light and fluffy, with a very subtle flavor.  It is well worth the effort.  It's actually the best cake I've ever made (though I admit, that isn't many).  Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, it would be wise to make more frosting.  I used 8" cake pans and barely had enough.

This was a huge hit!  I took advice from other reviews.  I used 6 squares of german chocolate.  I used all-purpose flour instead of cake flour.  I heavily coated the pans with spray and used parchment paper.  I could tell this saved me a headache!  The frosting is amazing!!!  I did make 1 1/2 the amount.  It was plenty.  I did toast the nuts and coconut, which made a wonderful taste!  I hightly recommend you do this. I did everything recommended to get this to thicken, but it was hard. After about 35 mins of stirring I added about a tablespoon of vanila instant pudding.  Worked well.  This is such a rich cake that you can only have a small piece, but it is so good. It's something you would be thrilled with if a small piece was given to you at a restaurant.  I also kept it in the fridge and served it cold... it really adds to the taste, the frosting is like eating ice cream when cold.  So so good!

This is a great cake!  My family loved it! I listened to others and doubled the icing and toasted the pecans and coconut.  You definitely need to double the icing if you do a three layer cake and want to put icing on the entire cake!  It is well worth the time you put into it!

Very excellent cake.  Not your traditional heavy chocolate cake- it's a tender, light cake that carries the rich, nutty icing perfectly!  I toasted the coconut and pecans, and made 1.5 times the frosting, adding about 1 tbsp of dissolved cornstarch at the end of cooking it.  But I had plenty of frosting left over, too.  I think those who said it made too little were trying to ice the sides of the cake, which it doesn't need.  The look of the layers of cake, frosting, and chocolate drizzle is beautiful- leave the sides exposed! It also creates the perfect balance of cake and frosting in every bite. Worth every minute of effort.

Absolutely easy and fabulous recipe to follow. I made it for my fiance's birthday and he loved it. Its his favorite cake and now wants me to bake it quite often. The only thing I would do the frosting first and place in freezer to thicken up so when cake is completed you could put the frosting directly on the cake. :-)

Not a cake to try if you have less than a couple hours to kill. If I could re-write the recipe, I’d recommend making the filling a day ahead, especially if you toast the coconut & nuts as I did. Otherwise, I’d put chocolate-melting first, filling second, batter third. At room temp, the melted chocolate takes a while to cool before you can use it.  Make it first & set aside while you make the filling & do the first couple steps of the batter. If necessary, you can set it in the fridge for a bit. At room temp, the filling takes a VERY long time to cool, especially if you make extra. It took more than 4 hours for mine to cool completely. I waited overnight, just to be safe. 1.5X the filling = a little over 4 cups, so the original amount probably makes 2 to 3 cups. Maybe it thickens better with the original measurements, but at 1.5X, I had to use corn starch: about a tablespoon just enough cold water to liquefy, then stir slowly into hot mixture & cook till almost molasses-like before adding nuts & coconut. I used 2 extra ounces chocolate without increasing the water & melted it on the chocolate setting in the microwave, stirring halfway through. Otherwise made as directed, the cake is very good, & my husband has eaten twice as much as I have. I only wish it weren’t so crumbly. It’s not dry, just much more crumbly than any cake I’ve ever made from a mix. Since this is my first from-scratch cake, I don’t know if that’s normal. Hope this helps others.

Almost too sweet, made it a second time with half bittersweet chocolate and it was perfect.

Ok, so I cheated and used a mix for the cake!  This review is for the icing.  It is absolutely, incredibly delicious, and I am not a big fan of German chocolate!  Everyone absolutely loves it.  I use the suggestion in the reviews to lightly toast the coconut and pecans - it makes a huge difference.  You can smell the icing.  It tastes like pecan pie.  It's hard to tell if it's done or not, when it seems like it isn't going to thicken up anymore I take it off the heat and it comes out great.  You can do extra pecans or extra coconut, it turns out fine.  I put it on cupcakes so I worried about having gooey icing running all over the place but it isn't a problem!  It comes out so sticky that you just kinda pile a scoop on top and shape it down and it just sticks in place.  But I cook mine a long time, maybe 15-20 minutes, so if you like thinner icing you could do it that way too.  I'm glad I tried this.  I would recommend it to anyone.  It is very easy as long as you never stop stirring and don't turn the heat up too high.  Thanks for this recipe!!

I really enjoyed this frosting but it definitely calls for too many pecans, next time I will adjust to my taste. The cake was very moist and fluffy but I felt that it had an off flavor. It might have been the low quality 'Baker's German chocolate'...next time I will use a high quality chocolate and possibly increase it to 6 oz. This cake definitely had potential to be the best german chocolate cake ever! I also had a hard time getting the cake out of the pan but I think that is just because of all of the fluffy egg whites. It's manageable though. I made this cake with 2 layers and only used the frosting on the inside and top. I made 1.5 the frosting but next time will double because there just wasn't enough on the inside. I frosted the sides with chocolate buttercream and it was pretty as well as delicious. Although I didn't care for the cake flavor, everyone else liked it! I will try this recipe again and again until I made it perfect! Lots of work but well worth it!

This was the best German chocolate cake I've ever made.  I did double the chocolate drizzle and my husband asked if next time I could double the filling also.  I will do that next time and drizzle the chocolate between layers in addition to over the top

This is the best German chocolate cake I have ever tasted.  It is very light and balanced, with just the right amount of chocolate flavor.  The texture of this cake is actually superior to any boxed cake I have tried.  It is just as tender and moist, however it's not artificially fluffy and soft like box cakes.  For anyone familiar with dense and heavy homemade chocolate cakes, rest assured this is much better!      I used all purpose flour with a little added cornstarch in place of cake flour, which still worked wonderfully.  For all chocolate cakes, the chocolate flavor is dependent on the quality of chocolate you use.  I used trader joe's pound plus, and added a 1/4 cup less sugar, to balance out the sweetness of the chocolate.  It was excellent.    Don't use shortening to make the chocolate drizzle, it tastes much nicer with heavy cream, I poured on a little extra too, can't go wrong with cream and chocolate.!    Great recipe, really fantastic, thank you so much for sharing.

This was a crumbly mass of deliciousness.  I am an experienced baker, followed the instructions exactly and it fell apart upon cutting.  It is very moist so that isn't the problem.  Maybe it is the separating of the eggs.  I made 1 1/2 times the frosting, which is to die for!  I might try this again, but without separating the eggs.

This was the first cake I ever made from scratch, and it turned out excellent.  It was moist, rich and had good flavor.  Everyone who tried it loved it!  I followed the cake recipe exactly.  I added a package of vanilla pudding mixture to the icing when I took it off the heat, and it was great.  Highly recommended.

Made the cake but used a canned frosting, because I didn't have time to do both. The cake was absolutely STUNNING! Light, airy, moist, chocolatey, sweet but not too sweet, PERFECT! Lacking 3 pans, I crammed it into two and it worked out just fine. Cooking time was a bit longer is all. I will definitely make again, especially when I'm aiming to impress!

Excellent receipe. I prefer to use a disposable (13x9x2) pan for easy of transporting. This makes is very easy to spread icing, and serve. I place the disposable cake pan on a heavy duty cookie sheet while cooking.  It takes 40-45 minutes to cook using this pan but is moist.  I use 6 squares of the Baker's chocklet. (18 squares is 4 oz.)

I made this FANTASTIC cake for my son's 20th birthday. It was wonderful! The 3 layers were extremly impressive! I had never been happy with any of my previous attempts at a "from scratch" German Chocolate Cake, but this one turned out perfectly! I also followed the advice of reviewers and added 1 T. corn starch to the frosting ingredients and 1 cup more coconut. This yielded plenty of frosting for all three layers.

This cake turned out beautifully!  I followed the recipe exactly, and though there were a lot of steps involved, the end result was worth it.  Since there are three layers I found that there was plenty of topping for each serving and didn't need to make extra for the sides.  The cake is wonderfully light, so extreme care was taken when removing it from the pan.

i made this for my husband's birthday and he absolutely loved it! instead of using round cake pans, i used 2 rectangular pans to make a 2 layer cake. i also followed the other reviewer's comments and added more chocolate. i ended up putting in 7 squares of chocolate and it seemed to be the perfect amount. also, the recipe doesn't give you enough frosting so i would recommend doubling the frosting recipe. i also toasted the coconut and pecans as the other reviewers had. i also drizzled the cake with melted chocolate and that made it more visually appetizing. this cake was time consuming but very much worth the time! i will definitely make this again :)

Very good.   I doubled the filling as some reviews suggested but that seemed a bit too much.  Next time I will do 1 1/2 X the ingredients.  Plan on stirring the filling approx. 20 minutes to get it to thicken and make sure it is thoroughly cool before you try to spread it.  I recently updated my bakeware by purchasing dark anodized aluminum pans therefore baking these layers 30 minutes was too long and wished I would have checked them after 20 minutes.  I chose not to drizzle melted chocolate down the sides of the cake. Instead, I halved the recipe of the Creamy Chocolate Frosting on this site and frosted the sides of the cake. That made it more attractive looking.  The preparation of this cake took me much longer than the recipe stated but it was a very good cake and enjoyed by all.

Though it's a little time consuming to prepare, it's definetly well worth the time!  TIPS: You might want to add a little more coconut to the frosting to thicken it up a bit.  Also in the list of ingredients, incase you get confused with the amount of German Chocolate (like I did)- use all of the 4 ounces in the package.  Enjoy!

This receipe is awesome, I left out the vanilla extract by accident also i didnt fold the and whip the egg white at the end of the receipe, and this cake came out great. there is only room for 5 but this is a 10, it came out moist, and not to sweet just perfect. this is not quick and its not really eas because all of the steps , but it is definatly worth it. and not for kids to try, for a while. I WILL NEVER BUY A STORE MADE CAKE AGAIN, NOR WILL I BUY ANOTHER JUS ADD WATER CAKE.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the chocolate drizzle. I tripled that. The filling was a bit runny even cooled, but it wasn't bad at all. Will definitely be making it again. I may try adding pudding or cornstarch to thicken the filling but overall the family loves it!

Raving about this recipe. It's actually quite simple to make and is not all that labor intensive, honestly. As mentioned by other reviewers, you'll want to make 1.5 times the frosting,  add extra chocolate to the batter, toast the coconuts and pecans, and I made extra chocolate drizzle because I felt its taste really complemented the cake. My cake popped right out without problems, although it was a bit fragile and was done in about 20 minutes. Lastly, make sure to completely cool your frosting and your cake. The icing solidifies to a spreadable consistency once completely cooled. This cake is moist and decadent!

This was my first time making a German Chocolate cake from scratch and I was a bit nervous since it was for my husband's birthday. He absolutely loves German Chocolate cake. There is a lot to the recipe and it did take some time but it was well worth it. It was very moist and yummy, just as a cake should be. I think the cake flour makes all the difference. I did not use this recipe for the filling/frosting though. I took another reviewer's advice and used the recipe on the back of the Baker's German Chocolate box. It made more than enough to cover the top and fill the cake layers whereas some people indicated that this recipe didn't. I will definitely make this again for my husband's next birthday.

Made this for hubby's birthday.  he is a huge german chocolate cake fan, and i usually just use boxed cake mix.  NEVER AGAIN.  The first time I made this cake it was time consuming, but 100% worth it.  I read the previous reviews and followed them.
*  20 minutes only bake time
*  spray Pam and floured the entire non-stick pan, then added parchment to the bottom.  Never had any problems with sticking.
*  Doubled the icing recipe.
*  Icing recipe took 30 minutes on medium low/low to thicken.  Removed pan from heat, let rest for 20-30 minutes then added coconut and pecans which had been toasted.  I did not follow the exact amt of recommended coconut and pecans.  I added them until I achieved the consistence I desired.  

I wrapped the cakes in wax paper and refrigerated them overnight, along with the icing.  Brought them all to room temp (south florida room temp :) before icing the layers the next day.  

My kids loved this too.  Absolutely worth it.

Love this cake. Made it several times. Made it for Easter dinner. I bought sweetened condensed milk so used that without adding sugar for the frosting. Made a quicker and better colored frosting.

Such a moist velvety cake. Cuts beautifully and practically crumb free. The frosting is so yummy and put all together, not too sweet.

I love this recipe! I usually make this every Christmas. The only thing that I do different is I add more coconut and pecans to the frosting. I also make a chocolate frosting using powdered sugar, coco powder butter and pet milk to go around the sides. My family loves the recipe!

The cake itself has an awesome texture and turned out perfectly. However, as others suggested it needs more chocolate and should only bake for 20 minutes. The frosting on the other hand was not very good. After following the recipe it mostly tasted like evaporated milk. I added more coconut and melted some chocolate into the frosting which helped a little bit.

The chocolate cake is heavenly. The frosting was good, but I recommend toasting the pecans before adding them to the frosting.

I made this cake for a client's husband. He almost hurt himself eating this cake! The wife said this is the best German Cake they have ever had and from now on, I am their go to lady for cakes. I am sorry I did not get a change to taste the cake, but what's important is what the client thinks. I make many different kind of cake, but this cake has a long process, but worth the time. Thanks to the person who submitted this recipe.

This cake and the carrot cake III are what I made for a birthday party. This cake was nothing short of amazing. I mixed a few more ounces of semi-sweet chocolate to the drizzle. My advice, like other's is to toast the pecans and coconut.

This cake is very, very good!  My mom-in-law requested a German chocolate cake for her birthday, and I thought this one sounded the best. I made it as directed, and it was amazing...moist and rich, with a light chocolate flavor.  She gave it the highest praise ever, saying this cake is better than the one her mom made for her when she was a girl!  It is time consuming, and the filling is a bit thin; I couldn't get it to stay on the sides of the cake, even when fairly cool.  I ended up mixing it with some chocolate frosting (the recipe on the Hershey's can) to thicken it up, and used the mixture for the sides of the cake.  So yummy!

AWESOME CAKE! I did everything it said... even sifted the flour... I did use my electric mixer... Also, I mixed the cake batter a little longer which resulted in a creamy smooth cake. Surprisingly this cake is not as rich as I expected. I am making it again for my 15 year old's b'day! =)

OMG! I used the cake portion of this recipe, a rum syrup from a different recipe and the frosting recipe from the German Chocolate box(made recipe 1 1/2) plus 1 cup more coconut than what it called for to thicken it up. The rum syrup was way too much only needed 1/4 of it cause the cake was soo moist already! (Recipe is below) I used the frosting in between layers and the whole cake. Left a big circle on top in the middle for chocolate frosting that came from a pre made container to save time then piped it in with a star tip. I have never been a fan of German Chocolate cake even tho I love coconut but a friend requested for his birthday. We absolutely LOVED it! Thanks for sharing the recipe. Time consuming but SO worth it. OMG
For the rum syrup:(this can be cut in half or more)
1 cup water
¾ cup sugar
2 tbsp. dark rum

I made this as a sheet cake for a party and it was devoured!!  This was my first German Chocolate cake and I pulled it off easily.  This is a perfect recipe!  You may want to make extra coconut because toasted coconut is a delicious snack.  I used organic, unsweetened shaved or flaked coconut.

Interesting recipe and well worth the experience.  This cake recipe was very good, not even close to a box cake(thank goodness). This will be my # 1  German Chocolate Cake recipe. I followed the recipe as written and there are no need for any changes whatsoever.
Make this cake !!!

This cake was easy to make, although there were a lot of steps. There is not enough of the pecan and coconut to cover the sides, so I made a chocolate frosting to cover the three layers on the side. Also, the dark chocolate drizzle was sparse. Next time I would double that part of the recipe.  Yummy!

Yum!  Made this for my dad's birthday yesterday, and it was amazing!  I made the cakes the night before, and then frosted them the next morning, so it felt like it took a very long time to finish.  But it was worth it.  I was completely idiotic and almost ruined the frosting, but was able to save it, thank goodness!  I chose to make 1 1/2 batches of the frosting, and this cake DEFINITELY needs it.  Next time I will make a double recipe.  A single recipe won't cover the whole cake--only the layers and top.  1 1/2 recipes barely covers between the layers, the top, and the outsides.  A double batch would give you generous amounts of frosting between layers and then lots to fill in gaps on the outsides.  It's just a matter of preference.  Otherwise, though, this cake recipe is on point, and delicious!!

This was so good! I doubled the recipe for a birthday party, but don't think I needed to as it made 3 9x13 pans of cake. I had a little trouble with the cake sticking to the bottom of my pans, but I think I needed to grease and flour the pan a little more evenly and let the cake cool completely before trying to remove it. I had a hard time getting my frosting to thicken up even after cooking it on the stove top for 30 min and adding cornstarch. It got a little better once the coconut was in it and was placed in the fridge and I added some extra coconut. Very tasty! Next time I might try using more cornstarch from the very begining. All in all it was a hit and I will be making this again! Easy recipe though it does take some time, but well worth it.

Loved this cake; however, it did stick to the pans!!  The icing was sticky enough that I could icing the layers back together and no one knew the difference!  No need to change the recipe or add anything, but the icing does need to cool first, and give it at least an hour in the fridge. Do make an extra half recipe of icing and toast the coconut and pecans!  I do think that next time I will take the advice of others and put the can pans in the freezer for an hour before attempting to remove them from the pans since "it doesn't dry out the cake, and the layers will pop right out if you use a hot wet cloth on the bottom of the pans", so why not?  Delicious cake!!  Thank you, Dean!!

This was excellent! I make/or buy a german choc. cake for my husband's birthday every year and he said this was by far the best yet. He loved the frosting so much he requested an extra batch for "dipping" lol. Very moist, and dangerous, because it's not too rich for second helpings.

RED FLAG!!! This is a great German Chocolate Cake recipe, BUT just so you know, this is identical recipe from the Betty Crocker's cookbook! The only difference is the added chocolate drizzle at the end. I think that it is a shame that someone posted this as their own! Good cake though.

This is cake has become my most requested. It makes a moist, tender cake, not overpoweringly sweet. I really liked the icing, but it requires a little bit of patience to get it perfect. The first time I made it, I thought it was awful and then realized, duh! - you need to use granulated sugar not confectioners sugar for cooked icing. :) Delicious!

The BEST German chocolate cake recipe. Although, I did tweak it a bit. (After reading reviews.) I added 2 ounces more chocolate to the batter and 1 tsp cornstarch to the filling. It was to die for! The cake itself was so moist, and the filling thickened up quite nicely. Amazing recipe, will make again!

Takes longer than "30 min" prep time, but well worth the effort. My family loved it!

This cake was a big hit at my husband's birthday celebration. I made the following modifications to use the ingredients that I had on hand.  I substituted multi-purpose flour instead of cake flour as well as unsweetened baking powder with canola oil and melted 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of German chocolate baking squares.  I made one and a half portions of the frosting, which was enough to ice between the two layers and the top of the cake.  I used 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar instead of 2 c. white sugar. I toasted the coconut and omitted the nuts.  I melted two miniature chocolate bars into the chocolate sauce in order to thicken it after reheating (I made prepared and chilled the frosting and this glaze early to accommodate our schedule).  The two layers baked in twenty minutes, rather than thirty.  I had mixed the batter to prevent crumbly cakes.  This recipe is worth the work.

Everyone at work raven the cake. Roast coconut and pecan does make different, it is worth of your time.
Make sure to make double frosting. It is a best German Chocolate Cake.

LOVE this recipe. Makes a giant cake, so the 2nd time I made it, I halved the recipe and made cupcakes (made about 20 with half the recipe). Huge hit! :)

The best cake I've ever made.  Here are my suggestions - will try and keep brief:
1.follow cake recipe - no adjustments   needed - for cooking time - different ovens=varying temperatures - stick a toothpick in it - you'll know!
2.use icing recipe on dark choc. box: http://www.kraftfoods.com/BakersChocolate/main.aspx?s=recipe&m=recipe/knet_recipe_display&u1=keyword&u2=coconut%20pecan%20filling%20and%20frosting&u3=**3*4&wf=9&recipe_id=51053
3.one recipe of this icing is just enough  if you're not heavy handed with it - it's very rich so more would be overkill in my opinion
4.trust the icing recipe - once you stir in the coconut and pecans it WILL thicken - you'll be surprised - but i definitely toasted coconut and pecans before adding - letting it cool a little will also help it thicken
5. you can simply toast nuts and coconut on the stove top in a non-stick pan - fast and easy

This cake is 100% phenomenal!  I have become a little famous for it over the past year or so...but all the credit belongs to Dean, since I have followed his recipe word for word each time I've made it.  It always turns out moist, rich, and divine!

I do, however, always double the icing.  There wouldn't be near enough otherwise...this is a big cake, and needs lots of wonderful sweet icing!

I like this cake, the texture is very, very nice - melts in your mouth.  I just wish it had more depth of chocolate.  I felt like it was very much on the surface and nothing behind it.  I would make it with espresso instead of water next time and maybe even adding cocoa nibs or mini chips.  Edited to add - I also added about 1/2 t. salt to the icing.  That gave it a rich caramel flavor instead of just being sweet.

This cake is absolutely fabulous! Don't let the long list of "from scratch" ingredients scare you off - this cake is very easy to make!! I followed other reviewers' suggestions to make 1 1/2 the icing...I also doubled the chocolate topping as well. Otherwise, I made the cake exactly as is, and it is unbelievably delicious. 

I could not get the icing to thicken up very much, despite making it exactly as instructed (and even adding cornstarch). Next time, I will probably make the icing the day before and see if it will thicken up overnight in the fridge.

I have made this cake several times now and it is great.  I doubled the icing recipe to be able and cover the entire cake otherwise there isn't enough.  If you make the icing correctly it is plenty thick enough just let it sit in the fridge for awhile and get cool after cooking.  Best german chocolate cake I've ever had.

Made this recipe for a birthday.  I had a bit of trouble with the filling.  It never set, but the way it dripped down the sides of the cake was pretty lovely.  I garnished the top of the cake with chocolate whipped cream and chocolate flakes.  It was for a birthday.  People thought it came from the bakery.  Great tasting cake!

My daughter and I just made this cake for my husband's birthday.  I've made German Chocolate Cake for years and this is absolutely the best and worth the time to make.  We followed the cake recipe exactly but used 3 8" pie pans.  We also took the advice of someone's review and used the Coconut-Pecan Filling and Frosting recipe that makes 41/2 cups of delicious filling/frosting.  Beautiful, high, moist, and simply perfect results.  It was not too sweet or too rich for even our guests tastebuds.  :)

This really is better than bakery quality cake. I followed the recipe almost exactly, paying attention to the comments. I had planned on doubling the filling but it was way too much! This cake is rich enough as is! I did double the chocolate drizzle on the sides though. Perfect presentation. Also, definetely use cake flour- it gives it a light, airy feel. I will definetely keep this recipe!

Made this cake for my boyfriend's B-Day (which is also X-Mas Eve) and it was wonderful. I didn't have cake flour, so I sifted my flour many times before measuring and added baking powder. The cake turned out very light & moist. Frosting was wonderful, though I did increase the amounts a bit so there'd be more. I would suggest doubling the frosting if you want to cover the sides as well as the layers & top. As the cake has had time to sit & absorb some of the frosting, it's just getting better & better. I would suggest making this cake a day or two before serving. Will definitely make this one again!

One of the moistest german chocolate cakes I have ever had! I used Saco powdered buttermilk blend...I sifted the Saco w/ the flour & then used a cup of water when the buttermilk was called for. (Perfect for those of us who only rarely use buttermilk. You can find it w/ the powdered milk.) I added a bit more pecans to the frosting at my husband's request. Wonderful cake... hubby said it was better than Grandma's.

I got rave reviews for this cake, but it'll need to be a very, very special occasion before I'll ever go to that much trouble again. I love to bake, but this cake was ridiculous! The filling alone was an ordeal. It took forever. I followed the original recipe exactly, stirred the filling for about 20-25 minutes - it never thickened enough. So I started over and followed the sweetened condensed milk advice of others as opposed to evaporated milk called for in the recipe. After stirring for close to 40 minutes it finally thickened. Yes it was/is a very good cake, but way, way too much work for me!

This whole recipe was wonderful!  I made it for a friend, who loves German Chocolate Cake without any coconut.  I wasn't sure I'd still like it without coconut, but it was wonderful.  I went ahead and used the entire box of german chocolate, because I knew I wouldn't be using it for anything else!  Also, I just melted about 1/3 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips with 1 teaspoon of shortening to drizzle on the top and sides of the cake, so that I wouldn't have to buy squares of chocolate that I don't normally use.  It made a cake that was as beautiful to look at, as it was tasty to eat!

Absolutely delicious!  From the look of it I thought it would be dry so I made an extra 1/2 for the filling but I don't think it needed it.  It was worth the time (it took me a little longer because of my two very little helpers).

Iam finishing the baking of the cakes right now, made the frosting earlier, and oh goodness! It is wonderful! (had to test it ya know!) I had to actually bring the frosting part to a boil to help thicken it more, then took off the heat and finished it. It came out better than store bought frosting! Mmmm! I toasted the pecans and coconut too, it brings out thier flavors better.
I bet the cake is going to be great! We'll eat it after our early St. Patricks Day Dinner!

Yum, yum, yum!!!  This is THE BEST german chocolate cake.  Truly outstanding.  It is not easy to make, however- it is definately a cake to make for someone very special, or when you want to impress.  It is more than worth the effort.

I made this yesterday for the husband's birthday. Great recipe! So good! You definitely will need to make extra filling as suggested. I added 1/2 to filling ingredients, and it was perfect. Also I omitted the chocolate drizzle at the end. It worked beautifully without. I love this recipe and will be making it again and again.

This is my first time submitting a rating, and I have to say- there was no other option but to rate this a full 5 stars! I loved the recipe since this was my mother's favorite cake, I made it the day after Christmas since I wasn't so confident in myself of making such an involved cake, but it came out beautiful and moist!! My frosting did not ever really set even after cooking the butter mixture but I made some adjustments to add more coconut and pecans and it came out loose but still very delicious!! I'll keep playing around with this until I can get to my liking, of course I also could not find german chocolate in my grocery stores so I used semisweet chocolate instead.

I made this for my husband's birthday & for my first cake from scratch, it turned out great. I'd probably use 2oz. of the German chocolate next time but overall, the work is worth it!

I've used recipes from AllRecipes before and loved them all, this one was a challenge for me. I've baked all my life and the only recipes that never turned out right were the ones I used Splenda in... until now. I followed this recipe to a T an everything tastes great; but my cake stuck to the pan and puffed up then deflated, the cake has weird air bubble holes, and the frosting didn't thicken. I found a quick tip to fix teh frosting and the cake is fine as is, so over all I love it.

The reason this cake falls apart is because is you sift the cake flour again it makes the flour too fine and hard to work with. I have german chocolate cake crumbs. Another thing is I wouldn't flour it I would use butter instead of cooking spray. Thankfully I made it early so that I will have a cake for the birthday party!

Just made this for a co-worker's 50th birthday party.  Everyone went nuts (no pun intended).  Responses varied from "This is the best cake I've ever had" to "You can start a business with this".  Some even questioned whether or not I really made it because it looked and tasted so good.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was add 2 more semi-sweet bars to the cake batter after reading another review for a darker more chocolaty taste.  Also, instead of shortening I used butter to make the semi-sweet chocolate drizzle.  When it dried it was hard like candy, yummm.  My only critic is that it takes a lot of time to make but in the end it was well worth it!!

This is my go to German chocolate cake.  Very tasty and not too difficult to make especially for a newbie.  It's good as written but with minor changes, it's fantastic!  I bring everything to room temperature, increase the chocolate in the cake by 2 ounces, add half a package of French vanilla pudding to the evaporated milk mix, and toast half the coconut.  With these changes, I have converted more than one G.C.C. hater! :)

This is the recipe that I grew up with that was on the inside on the semi sweet squares box.  I make it religiously for my 26 year old daughter without the pecans as it is her favorite cake and seems that I am always the designated dessert maker for family functions and this is number one on the list.   I put my I frosting in the freezer to cool to cut down and it also makes it much thicker.  Just wanted to throw that in because according  to several reviews some there  were having a problem with thickness.  You can also add extra coconut.

This recipe turned out great, but with a couple of caveats. The instructions to melt the German chocolate in the beginning are confusing ("In a small saucepan, heat water and 4 ounces chocolate until melted. Remove from heat and allow to cool")--I usually melt chocolate in a double-boiler, but this seemed to suggest that I melt the chocolate IN the water, not separately, which is what I ultimately did.
Also, the amount of frosting made using the recipe (I didn't cut down anything) is barely enough to cover three layers of a cake, plus in between layers. Be prepared to make at least twice as much.
Flavor-wise, this recipe was right on point.

Perfect! I used a creamy chocolate frosting recipe instead of the drizzles chocolate sauce. It turned out great! The cake is very light and has great texture.

This was fantastic!  The only thing is that the icing doesn't thicken on low; heat it up to medium and stir constantly.  Otherwise phenomenal!

I read some responses citing layers falling apart; Interestingly, my experience may throw some new info out there.  Baking at my boyfriend's house where he had only two 9" pans, I bought a 3rd pan which was heavier/thicker than his two.  After 25 min bake time, the layer in the new, thicker pan was perfectly done, and after cooling 10 min., turned loose easily.  The other 2 didn't seem as fully cooked, since they had not completely pulled free of the pan edge.  I cooked them another 2 min.  Still not fully free of the edge, but fearful of overcooking, I took them out.  After 10 min, neither turned loose as well as the layer from the heavier pan.  One tore out a single chunk, while the other fell apart completely and was not salvageable for use as a "layer", but excellent for sampling.  Perhaps I should has given the 2 thinner pans a full 30 min bake time to 'crust up' the bottom and sides.  As for taste, fabulous!  Akin to quality choc ice cream.  Curiously smooth and creamy taste even before the frosting. Well worth the scratch effort!

The only thing I had to change was to turn the heat up to medium to get the frosting to thicken enough. However, from personal choice i turned the temperature down to 315F and added a few minutes of cooking time to lessen the amount it domes on top and gets crispy on the edges.  Everyone loved it though and it turned out absolutely amazing. I absolutely recommend trying this.

The cake part is great. The icing, however, is unusable. It is so runny it won't stay on the cake. Just drips off the top. I cooked it forever, and added cornstarch, and then in desperation I added 2 cups of confectioner's sugar. Still too runny. I've tried it three times with the same result. Next time I'll look for a different icing recipe.

I don't do a lot of scratch baking but this was requested for a special birthday. Agree with what's been written: it's a production and will take hours, but worth it. I did NOT add extra chocolate to the cake batter and stuck to the recipe. Had no trouble getting the cakes out of the pans, having made sure to grease & flour generously. The layers didn't rise as much as I expected, but they were respectable in size. I had no cake flour, nor could I find any in stores, so I substituted using 2 Tbs. cornstarch + just under a cup of all-purpose flour (found that online). For the frosting, I took advice of reviewers & made 1-1/2 times the amount. Can't imagine working with less than that. I toasted the coconut & the chopped pecans. Nice flavor. Careful not to burn the coconut-it browns quickly. Heating the frosting ingredients in a saucepan I had to raise the heat. If I'd kept it at low, as directed, I'd still be waiting for it to thicken. Boiling was absolutely necessary, stirring constantly, and it thickened nicely. Even more so after adding the coconut & pecans. I put it in the fridge to speed up the cooling, and because time was short, the frosting was still somewhat warm when I applied it to the cake but that was fine. The chocolate drizzle didn't work at all. It needs far more fat (I used butter, not shortening & needed at least 1-2 Tbsp plus another square of chocolate). Then I could drizzle it over the top of the cake but had trouble trying to drizzle down the sides.

Made this cake for my daughters birthday.  The whole family taste tested.  Even those who were not German chocolate cake fans have changed their ways.  I am the appointed birthday cake baker for our whole family.  Everyone has requested this cake for their birthday now!
I made no changes to the recipe.  
Best ever recipe!!!

This cake was excellent! The cake stuck just a bit to the pan after baking and cooling, so I will definitely use parchment paper the next time. Luckily, it is a tiered cake with frosting, so no one could tell. The frosting turned out almost perfect, I didn't stir CONSTANTLY like the recipe said, and I wound up picking out small lumps of egg yolk. Make sure to stir CONSTANTLY. I doubled the frosting recipe and had about 1 cup left over. I didn't do the chocolate drizzle as suggested. The cake was plenty rich enough without it. Everyone raved about the cake. I will make this cake again some time!

This went over so well at a friends birthday party. I made the recipe as is and added choc frosting to the sides of the cake and did a little decorative flower with choc icing around the top edges. I think the choc icing with the pecan icing goes well together.

Oh dear goodness. I made this for my boyfriend's birthday. It was AMAZING. Pretty easy to make, just time consuming. Definitely worth the time though because this cake gets an A+++. My bf pretty much worshiped me the rest of the evening! lol I followed the suggestions of the raters below as far as one and 1/2 recipes of icing.

I made this recipe for Father's Day because my dad loves german chocolate cake.  Instead of making it as a cake, I made cupcakes (so I wouldn't have to worry about the heavy topping and stacking layers).  They didn't rise much at all, and I was worried about how they would turn out, but they were absolutely fantastic!  I used 1 1/2 times the icing, like lots of people suggested.  This recipe made 42 standard cupcakes, and I could have used a bit more topping, but it still worked out fine.  

Modifications:
I increased the topping/filling recipe by 50% like lots of people suggested.  
I toasted the walnuts and coconut, which I think was a great suggestion from others.
I used 6 squares of chocolate instead of 4 (and would have been content to add even more for a real chocolatey taste).

This was the first scratch-made cake I have ever made, and it turned out great!  I did add the egg yolks to the topping too late on the stove and had to throw out my first batch of topping because of there were scrambled eggs pieces in the mix - yuck!  Be sure to bring all of the ingredients to boil together and keep on stirring in order to avoid this trouble.  For experienced bakers, that's a "no duh", but I didn't even think of it in my haste.

If you're hesitating as to whether or not to make this recipe - set aside a good bit of time and go for it!  It will be well worth it.  My family loooooved them - and it had nothing to do with my skills and everything to do with this great recipe!

I have been looking for the perfect German cake recipe. I was going to keep trying different recipes until I found the perfect one. Well, this is it. The cake was so moist and delicious. I would def. reccomend this recipe. There was no need to change anything. I followed the recipes exactly as written and it was delicious. A real keeper!

AWESOME!  This is the best German Chocolate cake I have ever had!  I made the 1 1/2 amount of icing as recommended in other reviews and that was the perfect amount.  I used 2/3 cup milk chocolate chips because that was what I had.  Used sweetened coconut (wasn't sure).  I let the cake rest overnight before icing it.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe.

This cake had all the flavor. It was light, fluffy, moist and the icing was good enough to eat all by itself. This recipe is a keeper but I believe it does need a few alterations. 

I would definitely double the icing next time. I had enough to barely cover the whole cake but would have loved more. The center layer was very skimpy. It was very crumbly, which made it hard enough to cut. Maybe adding more flour as some other reviewers suggested would help?

I also omitted the chocolate drizzle. It seems like overkill to me & I'd never had it on german chocolate cake before.

To prevent cakes from sticking to pan, grease pan and line bottom with parchment or wax paper.  i've done this for years and never had a cake stick to the pan.  Peel the paper off after the cake cools (out of pan on a rack).

This cake is AMAZING!!!  I followed the directions exactly, only in half.  This made 2 2''x6'' round cakes.  It was very moist.  For the frosting, I used sweetened condensed milk in place of the evaporated milk, and toasted both the pecans and the coconut before mixing in with the custard like base.  It was great!!  I am adding this recipe into the rotation!  It was firm enough I am going to use this recipe in an upcoming wedding cake!

YUM!  A lot of work, but very, very good.  The topping took a long time to get thick, but it eventually did and once I put the rest of the ingredients in it all came together.  There was no need to add cornstarch, you just have to be patient!  If anyone you know loves german chocolate cake, the work is worth it.

I halved the recipe to make 12 cupcakes and these taste amazing.  For a cupcake, the cake part is very light.  However, its so moist and melts in your mouth.  A tip for other cupcake makers.  This batter doesnt give you that mushroom top, so be careful to not overfill or the cake oozes over the sides and sticks to the muffin tin.  I will definitely be using this recipe again and its going into my recipe book.

I really enjoyed making this cake and was pleased with how it turned out.  I did not have cake flour, but found a substitution with a mixture of corn starch and flour.  I used the original recipe for the filling, although I did read reviews to use 1 1/2 times.  I did toast the coconut and pecans, and that added a great addition to the flavor of the filling.  My husband really liked it as it was the my first attempt at making the cake.  Great recipe!

First time making this, I did buy Betty Crocker German Choc. as backup.  Didn't need it, came out great. I did have some issues with the cake starting to crumble so I followed some of the previous tips on that.  My fiance loved it.

This is an amazing, downright incredible recipe. Few thoughts/recommendations: Definately make 1 1/2 times the filling Toast the coconut I had difficulty getting cakes out of pans easily despite grease/flour....so make sure to do this part extremely 'liberally' Cake took only 20-25 minutes max I would add more chocolate to the original cake recipe as it was very good yet extremely light on the chocolate taste. This is a keeper!

WOW. Took all day to make this. I don't recommend this if you have little kids or need to tend to anything else during the day. Haven't tried it yet. It better be good or I may blow a gasket. I'm back!! TOTALLY DELICIOUS after trying it!

When I made this cake it was a HUGE hit! I mean in size too! It comes out as a huge 3 layer cake. I was told that it was the best German Chocolate cake my family and friends ever had. I would highly recommend the cake as long as you're prepared to make a huge cake (and have enough people to eat it). I didn't add the chocolate drizzle on top but it didn't need it.

As others have warned DO NOT OVERBEAT.  The texture of the cake IMPROVES after a couple of days so I would make ahead and cover to keep moist and let it settle for a couple of days.  And make TWICE the frosting quantity.  I skipped the chocolate drizzle and rest assured-  no one will miss it.

AMAZING.  Worth all of the time and effort.  I cooked the frosting on low for *forty minutes* (yikes!!) to get it thick enough that I felt once the coconut and chopped pecans were added it would reach the right consistency.  And sure enough once it had been cooled down it was perfect.  10 stars from family!

I didn't have any trouble with the frosting, but my cake is rather dense and heavy, and I'm guessing it's due to using regular flour instead of cake flour (couldn't find cake flour at my grocery store).  The cake looks nice and tastes pretty good, but I have a feeling it was supposed to be fluffier than it turned out.  Anyway, the frosting and chocolate ganache is fantastic.  I cooked my frosting over medium heat for about 12 minutes before it started boiling in the center; once it did, it began to thicken up, and I poured it into a cool dish to add the pecans and coconut.  It thickened up very well after that and tasted great.

I'm no baker, and this turned out amazingly well. i followed the advice to be patient with the frosting, and to double it, and i had 1/4 cup leftover. i also fridged the cakes for awhile before removing them from the pans and they came out just barely losing a little from the bottom but totally intact. i can bake, apparently. my husband was thankful and proud to have a homemade version of his favorite dessert. i was just proud to get through it and not have to use the duncan hines back ups I bought when I went to the grocery to hunt down german chocolate and buttermilk. special occasion or the desire to feel like a rockstar? go for it!

Perfect recipe! I made this exactly as written, and it came out absolutely delicious. Each layer rose perfectly, even though I only had two 9-inch round pans, so some of the batter had to sit in the bowl for more than half an hour before I could bake it. The cake itself was tender, moist, and delicious, with a wonderful crumb and a delicate chocolate taste. I used the German Chocolate Cake Frosting II recipe from this site as a filling between the layers, as well as a topping for my cake. I garnished it with toasted pecan halves, and it was a big hit. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe...I'll be making it again!!!

I had never tasted a German Chocolate cake before I set out to make this cake for my bf's birthday! He and the entire party LOVED this cake! He even declared it the best ever! I only made two layers and used the leftovers for cup cakes that I took to work.   Reduce the amt of sugar in the cake to 1 and 1/2 cups (you won't notice it if you use the german frosting as it is very sweet), I added 2 oz of chocolate to the cake, and made sure to add a little cream of tarter to whip the whites (MUST DO THIS if you want stiff peaks). Do not overmix the batter, as it has a deliciously tender yet fragile crumb. Gingerly use a spatula and mix by folding the whites in from swiping the outer rim of the bowl. Yes, it takes a while. Yes, you will be rewarded.   I used the directions for the frosting on the box that was listed in one of the comments-more than enough. I put German frosting in the center (generously) and I frosted the cake in chocolate frosting. I than decorated the top with the German Frosting. Took me 3 days (letting the cake sit in the pans and cool overnight helps a ton during the unmolding as well as lining the bottom with greased parchment paper) and well worth the hard work! Stick with the cake recipe-it's much better than any box mix and my friend is actually now using that same recipe for the groom's cake! It's really that good!

For a PERFECT cake at ~5000 feet make these altitude adjustments in the cake batter: 1 3/4 c. plus 1 T white sugar, 1 c. plus 4 T buttermilk, 7/8 t. baking soda.  I left the frosting recipe as-is.  I read all the reviews as well and absolutely agree that you ought to: 1. Whip the butter first, THEN add sugar and blend 2. Double the frosting recipe and 3. Toast the coconuts and pecans.  It was a little crumbly but a total hit (especially for my 1st cake!) Speaking of, I think they need to change the prep time.  This took me and embarrassing 7(!!) hours to make...but EXACTLY 30 min to bake My friends laughed at me...til they took a bite!

This was so moist and delicious. I doubled the frosting and I had a little extra but I would rather have too much than not enough. The frosting was so much better than any canned version...not too sweet and perfect! I toasted the pecans and coconut. Don't forget about your coconut and broil it too long because it will catch on fire...haha.

Amazing!  Almost a week later this cake was still moist.  Good, old-fashioned recipe... reminds me of my Great Aunt Ruby's recipe. Thank you!

Wish the cake was a little bit sweeter. Next time I will add more sugar.

Best cake I've ever made. It's very moist and light. Careful, it falls easily in the oven.

This cake was amazing!  Like many others have said, make about double the icing recipe.  I did as the directions said and didn't spread the icing along the sides of the cake.  Next time I will cover the entire cake though as the icing is SO good.  Drizzling (sp?) the melted chocolate over the cake with a small spoon was a great aesthetic touch.

This recipe was absolutely divine.  I followed the cake part how it is given except I melted my chocolate without any water.  For the frosting, I doubled everything except the butter.  The frosting turned out to be a great consistancy and spread nicely onto the cake, not to mention that it was so good, I seriously thought of just eating it by the spoonful.  One hint for the frosting is to make it the day before the cake and leave in the fridge over night.  When you start mixing the cake together, take the frosting out to warm up.  It will then be firm, but not difficult to spread.

I made this recipe last night and served it today for my fathers birthday as German Chocolate cake is his absolute favorite.  This cake was awesome!  I did encounter a few issues that freaked me out a little but with some improv. we were fine:  the cakes didn't want to come out of the pans (I wiped all pans with a light coating of crisco and floured them using the cake flour) SO, I used a laminated index card to slide into the sides of the cake pan and under the cakes to loosen them and VOILA!  They came right out.  The icing was thinner than I wanted so I added double the coconut and and pecans as well as I added the chocolate that was to be drizzled over the cake into the icing and it was wonderful!  The cake is very soft and moist and so delicious!

The topping was fantastic (I am a great fan of coconut).  The cake was, while sufficiently moist, not as flavorful as I would have hoped.  I think I wanted a deep chocolate flavor and this was a light airy chocolate.

The cake itself wasn't quite as chocolately as I would have liked, but overall it turned out really well.  I covered the sides with chocolate buttercream and piped some on the top for decoration.

Marvelous, and scrumptious cake.  If I was getting married, and I needed a wedding cake.  I would  definitely use this recipe.  My aunt used to make my dad a delicious German Chocolate Cake.   When my Uncle tasted this scrumptious, and  very delicious cake he said, "You gave your Aunt Mish a run for her German Chocolate Cake.  I reccommend that everyone tries this cake.  It is a very dilectable, marvelous, scrumptious, and delicious cake.

Excellent and moist cake recipe. I got rave reviews and am now making the cake for someone else. Some reviewers suggested doubling the recipe for icing. The icing recipe on the box of german chocolate is the perfect amount. It's not quite double but a little more than the recipe stated here and just the right amount. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the best from scratch cake I've ever made.  SOOO tasty...my husband LOVED it.  I poured all the batter into two pans and the outside kind of burned by the time the inside was done, so if you only use two pans, use less batter.

My husband requested German chocolate cake for his birthday and this recipe delivered! I did follow other's suggestions of making 1 1/2 times the icing and toasting the coconut & pecans. Next year I will make it a day in advance because I think this tasted even better the 2nd day.

This recipe was fantastic.  I made it for my husband who has only had commericially made cakes or out of the container frosting.  This is worth the time and the going and getting the ingredients my husband loved it for his birthday cake we all couldn't wait till the next morning for a slice.  Absolutely wonderful

I made this for my Mother-in-law who LOVES German chocolate cake but is watching her sugar intake.  I made the cake with splenda instead of sugar and used mostly brown sugar in the filling (which I doubled).  No one guessed I'd substituded with splenda and the filling had an extra richness to it.  The cake was much better than any I've had from a store, even a specialty bakery.  The exra steps are well worth the results.

My first time baking a German Chocolate and it turned out wonderfully. Wasn't the easiest cake, but certainly worth the time. A classic frosting absorbed nicely in and complemented this well. A huge it among all. Absolutely addictive and delicious!

I made this for my dad's birthday.  We have had a German chocolate cake for him since I can remember.  Everyone loved this cake and said it was the best one that we've had.  I did not have any trouble with this cake or the icing at all.  I put parchment in the bottom of cake pans. I let them cool over night.  The next day I iced the cake.  I did add a little cornstarch and water to the frosting while I cooked it.  It thickened up nicely. It tasted great and was easy to work with.  I will say that this recipe is extremely similar to the one inside the Baker's German Chocolate box, which is the chocolate that I used.

I made this for my grandmother's 80th birthday and she loved it. It was VERY messy and VERY unstable though. I recommend 2 tiers and maybe turning the other 1/3 of the batter into a couple cupcakes for the kids or something...I was kind of sad about the look of the cake, but the taste is truly incredible.

Tasty, but abit too rich - couldn't eat more than a little slice. Guess being used to only the very best, it's hard for me to fall in love with just any recipe. Seriously, I wouldn't call this an 'awesome' cake. It's okay.

My son requested a German Chocolate cake for his 13th birthday.  This is one cake that I had never tried making from scratch.  After reviewing several recipes for the icing, I found one that stated that you needed to cook the filling for 12 minutes.  I started timing from the time it started boiling, turned down the heat and stirred for 12 minutes. It starts getting thick after about 3 minutes...but don't stop! After 12 min,  added the coconut and pecans...It turned out PERFECT!!! I let it cool a little before putting between layers and on top....iced the sides with chocolate buttercream icing.  SUPER!

This recipe was great, but I suggest making double the filling.  I did not have enough for the sides once I had frosted between the layers and the top of the cake. I went and bought a german frosting from the store for the sides so it was semi-homemade! :) I also added grated chocolate to the sides and garnished the cake with pecans. It was great!!

Germann Chocolate cake is my husband's favorite and I make one for his bday every year. I haven't found one that doesn't fall apart, including this one. I increased the chocolate to 6 oz per other reviews. The cake was delicious - he loved it. The only problem was that the layers cracked as soon as I assembled them, even though I let them cool for several hours first. The filling/topping was a little thin, but I was able to keep plenty of it on the top, even though a good amount slid down the sides and pooled at the bottom. 
Again, the cake tasted great - I just wish I could find a Germann Choc cake recipe that didn't fall apart. I don't have this problem with any other cake - including a 3 layer Italian Cream cake I make that also has egg whites in it...??

Ok, so I had SOOO much trouble with this recipe. For starters you cannot bake this as one cake. I have a huge springform pan which I thought might save me time and make icing it easier. Not so much, the cake never did really cook all he way in the middle, the edges were starting to burn so I had no choice but to take it out. Also the icing never thickened, I cooked and cooked and cooked and it WOULD NOT get any thicker. My cake looked awful because the nuts and coconut stuck to it, but the icing just pooled on the plate. I made this for my father-in-laws birthday, everyone ate it, but no one was too impressed. I might try again if I have time to spare and extra money to spend on ingredients.

I used a box cake mix, but made the frosting.  on an electric ceramic stove top at level 6, it took 18 minutes of stirring to achieve a thickness I was happy with.  I made a batch and a half and had a bit left over to put on vanilla ice cream.  EVERYONE at work loved it.  I will make this again just to put on any kind of dessert - abosolutely delicious and worth the effort.

A co-worker told me that he used to think his wife's german chocolate cake was a 10 but after having this cake he has down graded his wife's rating.  Frosting was a little runny but I doubled the recipe and drained off some of the extra liquid and it turned out perfect.  Great cake!

Drop dead delicious.  I helped my 10 year old girl make this and we made very few substitutions.  We soured some milk with vinigar for the butter milk, used all-purpose flour and semi-sweet chocolate with corn syrup.  It still came out great.  Very good recipe.

I made this for my step-dad's b-day and for his family.  Everyone LOVED IT.  I have only made about 5 cakes in my life, but I have never got such good feedback as this one.  The whole cake was gone in 2 days by 4 people.  The frosting was really liquidy but it just made the cake extra moist.  Looked beautiful too.

I made this based on the many glowing reviews. What a MAJOR disappointment. I followed instructions to the "T" and the cake not only stuck to the pan but fell into a big unattractive pile of crumbs during "slicing." It was just too airy with those whipped egg whites. Kudos to the frosting, it is excellent. But I shall never attempt this cake again.

As a previous reviewer noted, this recipe is almost exactly the same as the one on the Baker's german chocolate package, with the exception of the cake flour.  I only had 3 8.5 inch pans and it worked fine.  The cake itself was very good--moist and light.  I used the filling recipe on the Baker's chocolate because of the complaints that this one did not make enough (used evaporated milk like both recipes state, and it seemed to take forever to cook, but I didn't have any problems with the consistency or taste) and it actually made a little too much.  I ended up frosting the sides of the cake with it, which turned out to be a mistake---too rich and too much of a good thing!  I think a chocolate ganache would work much better and also help with the cake's overall appearance.  I toasted the pecans and coconut and aggree that this gives a better flavor.  Overall, I would say that this is the best German chocolate cake I've had and is much better than anything you would buy in a store.  Everyone loved it, even my mom who hates pecans---highly recommended.

I was very disappointed in this recipe, especially since I took a chance and made it the night before a relative's birthday.  I spent all evening and a lot of money, all for a cake that's too ugly and odd tasting to serve :(  The cake itself tastes OK, although not worth the time it requires to prepare.  But the filling is too runny, and has an underdone milky/eggy taste, even though I cooked it for a long time.  And back to the cake ... each cake section cooked differently!  One part had a single side that expanded to be twice as thick as the other side;  another cake section had one spot that would finish baking until 15 minutes after the other two sections were done.  I assume this is because of folding in the egg whites, maybe they weren't blended well enough?  Either way, the cakes were too fragile to shave, so I ended up with a very unattractive, lopsided, runny cake that we probably won't even eat.

This was an excellent cake, and easy to make.  I found it easier to use 1 (12oz) can of cond. milk (instead of 8 oz), 1.5 cups sugar (instead of 1 cup)and 4 egg yolks (instead of 3)for the frosting, I also added a bit more vanilla, coconut and pecans.  What a great cake!!

Bakers beware...there is a discrepancy between the list of ingredients and the instructions.  I was carefully following the written instructions when I made the filling.  It says to use a cup of milk, so I did.  I couldn't figure out why the filling didn't get as thick as I was expecting it to.  I made another batch, thinking I hadn't cooked it long enough, but it wasn't any thicker.  Finally, while assembling the layers and thinking, "this can't be right" I re-read the initial list of ingredients, which called for evaporated milk.  I ended up baking the extra moisture out of the rest of the filling and ended up with a wonderful cake (in spite of the soggy first layer!)

I made this cake for my sister's Birthday Party and it was Great. When ever I make a cake for the first time and it will leave my house,  I make a small loaf just so I can taste it and critique my work. Now, if I had not made a small loaf for tasting purposes,  I would not have known how good the cake really is. This cake left my sister's party very quickly. My sister did not get any of the cake but her husband said it was Wonderful. I got so many compliments on this cake I could not wait to get home to try it to see if it was as good as all of the compliments.  I wish I had read some of the reviews before I made the cake, then I would have known to make more filling.  As I was frosting my top layer I kept saying to myself, "I am not going to have enough filling to complete this cake".  I was Thankful to have more of the filling ingredients to make another batch.  I have to make this cake again next week for a special celebration for a friend so I will know to double my filling ingredients.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This cake took a lot of time to make but was worth it! It had great flavor and was a hit at Easter dinner! The icing is the BEST! I have used it on plain chocolate cup cakes. The cake was a tiny bit dry but I believe that it's normal for this type of cake. I would make again.

I made this recipe for my neices birthday.  Everyone loved it.  I even forgot to add the egg yolks to the cake and it still came out fine.  One thing about the filling.  I think you need to simmer it a little.  I read the other reviews about the problem with the filling and I let mine simmer a little and it was fine, thick enough for the center with a little drizzle over the sides.  Great recipe Dean.

I had the same problem with the icing. It would not thicken into frosting...I don't know what I did wrong! So I had to add powdered sugar and flour to the icing to make it more "frosting-like". The cake turned out beautifully. It's for my grandma's birthday tomorrow, so I'll let you know how it tastes!

I was making this cake for my boyfriend's birthday.  I left out so many steps due to his lack of supplies (why don't men have sifters?) but the cake turned out fabulous! I never got past the baking step, though, since my cakes stuck to the pans.  My own fault, I know.  But he tells me that the cake was the best he had ever eaten... out of the pans with his hands.

Loved this delicious and moist cake! First time frosting didn't work and was not fixable. Remade frosting with these changes: 1. Used 3 whole eggs instead of just yolks, 2. Used whole-milk evaporated milk instead of 2% (I used 2% the first time), 3. Made sure egg, milk, & sugar mixture came to a boil for 1-3 mins  before continuing with recipe. Awesome! Chocolate drizzle around edge makes this special.

I'm a wanna-be baker that wishes he had more time to bake and learn the art of cake baking.  So, the recipe was easy to follow, and fairly easy to make.  
Once I had all of the ingredients out and measured, it took about 30-40 mins to prep + cook time.

Frosting was good.
Cake very moist.  Kind of a sponge texture.
Held together well, but not tough (probably due to the cake flour.)

Good basic cake that would go well with a butter cream chocolate frosting.

Made it for my dad's 91st B-day.  Family loved it.

First of all I did not notice that it was three layers until I had the batter ready.  It turned out great with two layers!   It took a little longer to bake.  I cannot eat most cow dairy products but for some reason have no problem with butter.  I substituted coconut milk for the buttermilk and the evaporated milk.  One 13.5 ounce can of coconut milk (18% fat) was exactly the right amount for the cake and the topping.  I guessed that coconut milk would go great with this recipe and it did!  This was the best German Chocolate Cake that I have ever had and quite possibly the best cake I have ever had.  Besides that, it was beautiful!  I am looking for another special occasion so I can make it again.  Also, it goes great with my home-made ice cream made from coconut milk :)  I think it would be helpful if the ingredients were listed separately because I had to think about where the cake ended and where the topping started.

I've made this several times, and will be making it again this weekend for my husband's birthday. I used sifted all-purpose flour in place of cake flour, which lends to a cake that holds together more readily and is easier to handle coming out of the pans. A key to getting the filling to thicken -- do cook on medium-low for at least 10 minutes, stirring frequently. It will start getting thicker the longer it cooks. I use a quality pan deep enough to submerge the lower third into an ice-water bath after the 10 minute cooking time. Once placed in the bath stir occasionally and you'll find the filling thickens to a consistency that maintains its structure and can be spread on the cake without running.

This cake is absolutely delicious! I made it for my husband's birthday and he loved it. It does take quite a bit of time to make the cake and the filling, but was well worth the effort. I did add a tablespoon of instant vanilla pudding to the filling and the thickness turned out perfect.

I made the recipe BUT left out adding the whipped egg whites. I wanted a more dense cake made in a sheet pan as I needed 250 pieces for a school function. It did fall just a little but after adding the pecan coconut topping and drizzling chocolate on top it turned out just as planned. Delicious.

Wow! This was the first time I've made a German chocolate cake from scratch and it was awesome ! It takes quite a while to make but it's so worth it ! I made the full recipe and filled a 11x15 inch rectangle cake pan perfectly with it. I did two recipes to make two sheet cakes and then made the icing recipe times 1 1/2 as a filling. As some others suggested, I made sure to toast the coconut in a 350F oven for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally and then toasted the pecans for about 5 minutes. Then I made a German chocolate ganache and covered the cake with marshmallow fondant to decorate as requested by a friend. Everybody LOVED it! It was wonderfully moist and delicious! Thank you for this awesome recipe!

This recipe is a favorite in my house. I make it often. The only  recommendations I have are toasting the pecans and coconut before adding it because it will add an even more amazing taste. Also make sure you double the frosting portion.

I was looking for a recipe for home made German Chocolate Cake. After reading all the reviews I decided on this one for my husband's birthday last wk. My husband said this was the best German Chocolate Cake he has ever had, I'm making it again for Father's Day. The only thing I did different was double the frosting so I could have enough in between layers and to put over whole cake. Also when making the frosting make sure to bring your ingredients to a quick boil before going to the next step. Over All Very Wonderful Cake, I wish I could give more stars.

I made according to recipe.  Turned out perfect.  I've never written a review before but had to correct the many reviewers who added something to the filling to thicken it...DON'T DO IT.  The problem they were having is they weren't cooking it long enough.  It takes a long time (I didn't time it but it probably took close to a half hour at a slow boil).  It will thicken and change color.  I knew this because I have made caramel before.  Same idea.  I frosted the sides just so it would look better.

This was a lofty goal - my first cake from scratch.  It was amazing!  For the frosting, I used the German Choc. Cake Frosting in a separate recipe.  Likely due to my inexperience, it was pretty lopsided once I put the filling in.  So I made another batch of frosting to hide the imperfections and covered the whole cake (didn't use the drizzle).  It was a huge success and not bad looking with the pecans on the top.

This can be a 5-star cake, but for novice bakers it is a 3-star as written. Cake batter is great as written, but the frosting and overall timing is way off. First, for a good amount of frosting you should 1.5x the frosting as others have suggested. Plus, toasting the coconut and pecans takes the flavor to a 5-star level. Also, bringing the frosting to a boil is critical. Let it cool to thicken to proper consistency. This took at least an hour, plus I put it in the fridge to speed it up. The timing for this recipe is at least 2 hours for novices. BUT, THE CAKE IS A 5-star once the kinks are worked out for beginners.

I got rave reviews from my friends for this cake, but I personally didn't love it. The cake part was a little too dry for my taste, but maybe that's just what goes with the icing. I used 2 9-inch round pans and regular flour because that's what I had, baking around 40 minutes. The icing, though, was delicious. Per reviews, I made 1 1/2, toasting pecans and coconut. I skipped the shortening, microwaving the chocolate for 30 seconds at a time until melted, put in a plastic bag, cut a bit off the tip to drizzle a lattice on top. I couldn't get the icing to stick to the sides, so I just put it in between the tiers and then on top.

I just made this cake for my daughter's birthday.  For a basic baker I found this recipe delish!   My recommendation is to read the written ingredients, and follow the video provided.  The written directions miss out on pertinent information that you get from the video.  As far as twisted; it is not overbearingly sweet or chocolately.  Defiantly screams "I am homemade" My only tip is  for the very end, the small amount of chocolate you drizzle with, I used a ziplock snack bag.  I poured the entire amount in the directions, pour into the corner of the bag.  then snipped to corner and insto presto,  an icing bag'

I made this recipe gluten free, which does not change the flavor so much as the texture.  It has been over 10 years since I had a German chocolate cake and this recipe tastes nothing like it. The only flavor was that of sugar, which I guess should be expected from a recipe with 3 cups of straight sugar in it. Very disappointing. No chocolate flavor and the coconut was also lost against the sugar flavor. 

As far as making it GF, this recipe comes out dense, which you wouldn't expect since the egg whites are beat separately and then folded in. Then center also collapses when it is stacked. After reading other reviews, I see that those using white flour had the same problem (bad texture, sunken center).  **I would also like to add that the cake photo with this recipe is not a cake made from this recipe. This recipe calls for 3 cake layers (photo is two), the cake is a much paler shade of brown, the icing does not get that thick.**

I love this recipe. I made the icing first so once the cake finished baking I could ice it right away. I melted the butter in the milk on low and then added the stirred egg yolks. Brought it all to a rolling boil and noticed it started thickening right away. I stirred for a few minutes on rolling boil and then removed from heat and added the roasted pecans and coconut. I left it sitting on the stove while I made the cake and it was thick by the time I could ice the cake. The cake held together beautifully. I used a little less than 1/2 cup water to melt the chocolate. I used a spatula to fold in the flour and buttermilk so I wouldn't over mix it. Beat the egg whites til extremely stiff and folded that in. The batter almost had a glaze to it. It didn't crumble at all.
It took time to make this cake but with music and a rainy day it was fun to make. I will definitely do this again. :D

I followed the cake recipe to a T.  Even after greasing the pans my cakes stuck horribly.  One layer completely fell apart so I took another reviewers advice and froze the other two layers for about an hour.  Then I dunked the bottoms of the pans in hot water for about 20 seconds and they released from the pans just fine.  I accidentally lost my grip on one of the pans and my cake layer ended up with a water bath, but that was my fault.  I'd still say this is probably my worst caking experience to date - the cakes were very crumbly, more so than your average chocolate cake.  Very tasty and moist, but the moisture was almost to it's detriment.  Also took the advice of other reviewers and toasted the coconut and pecans and doubled the recipe, which was a blessing because I had enough to cover the boo-boos.  The frosting tasted amazing!  All in all, I think the recipe is a keeper.  Time consuming, but in the end worth it.  I would suggest perhaps omitting the water when melting the chocolate.  This cake is moist enough without the extra water.

P.S.  I also used aluminum foil greased in the shape of a circle at the bottom of the pan b/c I didn't have wax paper and I wanted the cake to just pop out on the bottom.  Very happy I did so because they plopped out just fine.

I have tasted the Cake and it was tasty. But I find it still funny that its called German Chocolate Cake, because normally in Germany Chocolate Cakes are like normal Chocolate Cakes. Dark Cake with Chocolate Cream or Chocolate Glaze. We don't make them like this recipe. But non the less its a great cake.

Did really good. Like others, didn't overmix, toasted the coconut and pecans, I agree another chocolate square or two would be a great idea. 
My insights: 
I made my own cake batter by simply adding cornstarch to the flour (two Tbsp per cup of flour). and sift them together 3-4 times. 
Then, I goofed and did one stick of butter, not 2, for the batter. not sure if any problems, but the cake was still moist 10 days out (only I was eating it). So I would omit the extra butter if I were you. Try it and you will be very happy because it must be healthier. I also added a pinch of chili powder, gives the chocolate an interesting kick.

This recipe is great! I've never had a cake behave better, absolutely no problems at all. It was very moist and came right out of the pan. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I took another reviewer's advice and cut the cooking time down to 20 minutes. I'm glad that I did, because that's really all it needed. The amount of filling was just enough to cover the top and between the layers, so if you wanted to put it on the entire cake, you're definitely going to need to make more. Otherwise, just follow everything as is.

My man has a tradition of German chocolate cake in his family, and he wanted it for his birthday. It's a complicated cake to make, but worth it. Everyone ate every bite, so I consider that a success.
I am not married to this recipe, but I will use it with modifications.
Next time, I hope to achieve a more moist and less crumbly cake. I'll double the topping too.

I cut the hole in the middle, so we could enjoy a fresh piece together, as his birthday party was the next night. I put a candle on it, and it was romantic.... still crumbly though.

I followed the cake recipe as is and it was very good, light and moist but rich at the same time. However, I did notice sticking with mine. The first one I tried to take out completely fell apart, which I have never experienced before with my pans. So mine ended up being a two tier cake as I let my other two cakes sit for another half hour and then painstakingly take out. As for the frosting, mine turned out extremely runny and had I had enough time to make more I would've thrown it out altogether. Listen to me and others when I say to bring it to a boil and then let it cool. I followed the directions and did mine on low for a solid 25 minutes and it was still almost unusable. Tasty, but way too runny. All in all, with a few tweaks I will definitely make again, if nothing else than for the awesome chocolate cake recipe.

This recipe is amazing. I made cupcakes instead of cake. Also, on a previous suggestion, I toasted the pecans and coconut. You really don't need double the frosting when making cupcakes so I had a ton of extra. I have never gotten so many compliments from one dessert before in my life! As my coworker put it: 
"WOW, now that's one righteous cupcake!  The flavor is rich and buttery and makes my taste buds dance an Irish jig in delight!  The cupcake top has the right amount of crunch to add contrast to the moist softness of the cake.    This is quite possibly the best German Chocolate cake recipe I've ever had!"

That about sums it up!

This takes awhile to make, but it is worth the effort!
Followed the recipe exactly.  I did make extra icing, as suggested though.  
Husband's birthday cake :-)

Made this cake for my husband's birthday. German Chocolate Cake is his favorite. I made chocolate buttercream to ice the cake and put the filling in between the layers and on top. Made Marzipan covered cherries dipped in ganache and almonds. He took it to work with him and it was a hit. No leftovers so I didn't get to taste the cake but I did taste the filling and the frosting. It was yummo! Thanks. =)

My husband said that I knocked it out of the park with this recipe!!!  His favorite cake is German Chocolate.  I have never made a homemade cake from scratch before, but wanted to, for his birthday. He absolutely loved it, and although I have never been a fan of German Chocolate before, now I love this cake!!!

Made this cake last night.  I'll be making this again and again.  It is fabulous.  Double the frosting and the chocolate drizzle is the only suggestion I can make.  Otherwise it's perfect.

Delicious!  I doubled the icing recipe and cooked the cake in a rectangular pan for 32minutes.  Once cooled I sliced the cake in half to create two layers.  

It took a really long time to thicken the icing so after 20minutes I turned the heat to medium while continuing to stir constantly.

My husband adores German Chocolate cake so this recipe is a keeper.

This recipe is great! It was the first German Chocolate cake I've ever made, and it was so rich and moist, and was so much better than going out and buying one at the store. I followed the advice from the reviews and my cake came out perfect! I increased the portions for my topping, added a little more chocolate to the batter, and threw in some corn starch to the filling to thicken it up. The final merengue added to the batter made the cake amazingly fluffy! Anyways, this is definitely a recipe to keep. Good luck to all you experimentalists out there!

I think the recipe is great. The baking time could be shortened though, I baked mine for 23 minutes and the sides were a little scorched.

This was my first time baking a German Chocolate Cake.  I followed the recipe to a T.  My cakes came out flat and dense.  Maybe I over mixed the batter, I'm not sure.  I took others advice regarding the frosting and made 1.5 the amount it called for.  I had enough for some between each layer and on top, but there was not enough frost the sides of the cake.  But it looked fine and was plenty sweet!  Speaking of sweet, I thought the cake called for a lot of sugar!  If I made this again I think I will omit some sugar and use more German Chocolate.  I would have liked it to be more chocolatey.  I used 2 ounces of chocolate for the drizzle.  Everyone said the cake was delicious, so I guess it's a winner!  ;-)

Loved this cake, it beat the box version I have been eating for years hands down so it was well worth the extra effort.  I like to make the cake the day before and decorate it the day I want it, it lets the cake rest and makes decorating so much easier.

Made this for my boyfriend's birthday yesterday and it was a huge hit! This was my first time making a cake from scratch and it turned out amazing. I had read a few reviews before making it and opted to make the frosting first which worked out great. Once the cakes were cool, I was ready to frost and finish. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and it turned out perfect!

Replace the 1/2 cup of water with strong coffee or expresso....you can't taste it..it simply makes the chocolate much richer.

Time consuming, but worth every moment!!!  Used cake flour substitute (flour + cornstarch) and subbed German chocolate (unsweetened chocolate + 4 t sugar per oz) to save money & use items I already had on hand.  Delicious, and the family RAVED about it!  Note, it does make a BIG cake!  Absolutely the best German chocolate cake I have ever had.  No need to look for another recipe - this is IT!

This is a great recipe if you are looking for a "scratch" cake batter.  Not difficult, but you will get a lot of bowls dirty.  Your friends will be impressed.  The flavor is great and the texture is moist.  That said, if you don't want to go to all this trouble, use a cake mix.  I wanted an frosting using sweetened condensed milk and I found one on this site called Coconut Pecan Frosting - really good.

Oh, Wow!  I made this cake for my father's birthday and it couldn't have come out better.  The light chocolate of the cake went fantastic with the rich topping, it looked gorgeous, and the chocolate drizzled over the top put it over the moon!  Excellent recipe that might easily become a yearly tradition.

I made this recipe without changing anything except increasing the heat when making the frosting to try to thicken it up more.  It seemed slightly thicker and wasn't sure if I should continue stirring longer but turned it off and added the coconut and pecans. Frosting turned out awesome and thickens when it cools off.  The cake in the bottom of two pans crumbled but I was able to make a slightly shorter three layer cake and it tasted wonderful! Even brought it to my German Club and it disappeared fast.

I didn't try any of this, I made it as a gift for someone. He absolutely loved it, though, and sent me a "Thank You" bear in the mail! The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that there wasn't quite enough filling/topping. If I made it again I would double the amount of filling made.

I was a little intimidated by this cake, I'm new to cooking and baking and was worried that I wouldn't be able to pull it off. But I did and it was absolutely amazing! I did have to let the icing cook for over 30 mins to get it thick enough, I also toasted the coconut. Can't wait to make this cake again!

Very good!  I doubled the frosting recipe and toasted the coconuts and walnuts (my sub for pecans).  It wasn't as moist as I hoped for but I'm sure that's because I did something wrong.  Be sure to allow the frosting to cool considerably before spreading.  I was getting frustrated because it kept falling off as I was trying to spread it but thats because I hadn't let it cool enough.  As it cooled it stayed up nicely.
Thank you for the recipe, this was my first time making a German Chocolate Cake and it was delicious!!

I made this recipe for my dad's birthday and it was great! But I did have to bake it for about 30 more minutes. Other than that, it was perfect!

Oh dear, please follow the advice given by a reviewer...DO NOT OVERmix. Unfortunately I read this too late after alllllll of my cakes stuck.Taste good, but due to the patching it was quite possibly the ugliest cake I have ever made. I question a cake that is so finicky even after throughly greasing the pans. Having made many cakes before, I found this cake not worth the extra work and trouble. Sorry.

My first time making this cake.... in fact its my first time even hearing about this cake. I've gotten many compliments and I was thrilled with the outcome. My parents, however, have heard of this kind of cake so they were my samplers. They LOVED it. Only thing... you must have patience, do not rush this and I promise you will be very happy with the outcome! Enjoy your cake! =)

This cake is absolutely delicious! I did as the other reviews suggested and toasted the pecans and coconut. I doubled the filling recipe just to make sure there would be enough and I had plenty with a little left over. I think 1 and 1/2 would be the perfect amount as others have suggested. Also, DO plan on the filling taking a good amount of time to thicken. It took mine about 35 minutes of constant stirring to begin to thicken enough. Just follow the instructions and the advice here in the reviews and you will enjoy a scrumptious cake! I will definitely bake this cake again!!!

The recipe is very good, the only thing is that the German Chocolate Cake is too sweet and heavy for my taste. It was moist, but I did use extra frosting/stuffing and served it with a scoop of java/chocolate chip ice cream.

My first time ever making a German Chocolate Cake. I wanted to surprise the designer of our company for his birthday. Also, for the first time in my life, the entire cake was eaten. Not a single piece was left. I was also told by two people, out of all the German Chocolate cakes they've had in their lives, this one was by far the best.

This is one of the best cakes we have ever made. We made it for our Sunday cheat dessert. I toasted the coconut and pecans. left overs got took to my wife's work and they all raved about how great it was. It took a while to make no doubt about it but it was well worth it in my opinion:)

Everyone loved it but it fell apart and was difficult to work with. Also, needed more chocolate drizzle than what the recipe made in order to achieve the look in the picture.

This cake is so good! My son is 15 today and this is his favorite cake (out of the box) So I am doing this for his birthday from scratch.  The list of ingredients was a little intimidating because I DO NOT BAKE at all and my husband is the cook.  BUT I DID IT. It took a little longer than the 30/30 but thats because I'm a newbie and a little slow.  Will absolutely make it again!!!

I am new to baking, and not very cooking-savvy, but I followed the directions, and this turned out absolutely delicious - way better then the store-bought german chocolate cakes we've had recently.  My boyfriend's favorite cake is German Chocolate, so I thought I'd make this for his birthday, and boy was he impressed - for one, that I actually baked something, and for two - that the cake turned out so wonderfully moist, fluffy, and delicious!   I made 1.5 the amount of frosting as some other reviews suggested, and that worked out fine.  My boyfriend's only suggestion was that I should have toasted the pecans before adding them to the frosting, but otherwise everything was absolutely delish!

Without a doubt the most complicated thing I've made in the kitchen, but it is definitely worth it!!!! I followed the suggestions of other reviews and added 2 more oz of chocolate to cake and did 1 1/2 of the filling.  Absolutely fabulous!!!!!

Great!  I made it in 2-10" pans because I didn't have 3-9" pans and it worked perfectly.  Also the icing recipe sets up just FINE, you just have to cook it long enough for the yolks to set up.  I stirred it until it was at the boiling point and its perfect.   Also with the 2 10" pans I had plenty of icing (one recipe) to fill the cake, top the cake, and put a thin layer to seal the outside of the cake.   Delicious!  This is a keeper.  I'm a picky baker and I also have a cake business and I'm definitely adding this to my special recipe binder.

My granddaughter wanted a German Chocolate Cake for her birthday and I made it from this recipe.  The cake was delicious. I agree with other reviewers that you need more frosting. I used all 4 egg yolks, the entire 12oz can of evap milk, 1 1/4 c sugar, 3/4 c butter, the entire small package of Bakers coconut, etc., and it worked great. The cake was very tender but I had no problem working with it.  I did use parchment paper in my pans to ensure it wouldn't stick (because of other reviews). I sprayed the pans, inserted the parchment paper and then sprayed again.  I would absolutely make this again.

This was the most difficult thing I have ever baked.  The first one fell, burned on the top and was not done in the middle.  I set out to do it again and just used all purpose flour the second time.  After 45 minutes I could tell it still was not going to be done so I lowered the oven to 275 and it took over 2 hours to bake.  I feared the worst but it finally was done and turned out amazing.  It is very moist but like others mentioned very delicate (almost breaking apart again.)  The frosting came out perfect (I doubled the recipe) and barely covered it all since I did 2 pans and split the layers for a 4 layer cake.  It is beautiful and delicious but way way WAY too much work!

Best German Chocolate cake ever! Definitely double the frosting recipe to cover the whole cake. Plan to spend a good amount of time at the stove to make the frosting (mine took 45 minutes or so). This cake does take awhile to make but the result is just the best!

This cake was exceptional in every way.  I made this for my wife's birthday and everyone was raving how delicious and moist it was.  I didn't make any substitutions as this was the first time I tried it.  I won't make any changes next time either!  It was perfect.

I make this cake once or twice a year for birthdays.  People always tell me how GREAT it tastes--some even say it is the best cake they've ever had.  Some don't believe that I baked it, but bought it at a high end bakery.  I get 16 slices of cake from it (not 12).  I follow the cake recipe to the letter, and I do not overmix when adding the flour (very key to a moist light cake).  I increase the filling by about 25%, otherwise you really have to stretch it.  Instead of drizzling chocolate on the sides, I frost the sides with a ganache frosting--1 cup butter and 1 cup semisweet choc. chips.

This cake/frosting is WONDERFUL!  Tip for the frosting: don't get discouraged if your frosting doesn't thicken right away.  BE PATIENT!  I doubled the frosting recipe and it took 20-25 minutes for it to thicken.  I also toasted the pecans and coconut-- it came out perfect!

This was the best German chocolate cake I've ever had, and people are begging me for the recipe. It's important to remember that this does NOT make enough frosting.  Use the frosting on the Baker's German Chocolate recipe card. The cake part is very similar, but a little different. The frosting is exactly the same, except the one on the card makes more, which is necessary for this cake. Also, if you like the semisweet chocolate, melt double the amount to drizzle on the top. This cake is worth all the trouble!

I made this for a friend's birthday.  It was a huge hit.  The cake is moist, but not too sweet.  I'm not a fan of coconut, but I have to say I enjoyed the cake.  I will be making this again.

i followed this recipe exactly as it reads, and it was absolutely fabulous. everything turned out great, and my coworkers raved about it! two things:the cakes are difficult to get out of the pan, and I will double to frosting next time as I did not have enough to cover the sides of the cake. other than that, perfect!

This was the first time I've made this type of cake. My fathers favorite so I gave it a swing. Absolutely perfect. I did take the advice of one person and add 2 more ounces of german chocolate. It was very moist and yummy. This one is a keeper for sure.

This cake is a wonderfully moist with a great chocolate taste.  Like others who reviewed before, I did have some problems removing the cakes from the cake pans.  I assume this could be solved by lining the pans with parchment paper.  However, since I did do this, and my cakes crumbled when I removed them from the pans, I turned it into a German Chocolate Trifle.  Using a large glass bowl, I cubed the cake and layered it just as the recipe said.  This turned out to be a spectacular revision!  I would also recommend serving it warm, right after you top it with the melted chocolate.

The batter is so good on this cake that you have to force yourself to even put it in the oven. I don't eat anything with coconut in it, but I cannot resist this cake!!!

My husband requested German chocolate cake for his birthday. I was a little nervous about making it, but I'm SO glad I used this recipe. The cake was fantastic. Everyone gushed over how moist it was. The icing was thin, but we really enjoyed it. It was almost more like a glaze than frosting. The only change I made to the original instructions was baking it for about 22 minutes instead of 30. I have a feeling I will be baking this one again - many times! Thanks. 

I didn't have cake flour, so I just mixed all purpose flour with cornstarch. Perfect.

Addition: I've now made this cake 5 times and every time it barely lasts the evening. It is SO popular, even with my husband's picky grandmother. Many people have commented that it's the most moist cake they've ever had, and I agree!  Follow the recipe exactly, with the exception of baking it for fewer than 30 minutes. It's top notch!

My husband asked for a German chocolate cake for his birthday so I found this recipe. Everyone was raving over it. But it was quite difficult, I will admit. It was worth it since it was for his birthday, but if you don't really have a lot of time to devote to all the steps or are not really good at following directions then just go buy a cake mix. This is definitely not for beginners.

This is a great recipe! I've never baked a cake before and I didn't find all the ingredients(used almonds instead of pecans and had to make my own buttermilk),but it turned out fantastic! Thanks for the recipe.

Loved this, followed the recipe to a T and it came out perfect.  I put very light layers of the frosting between the cakes and it was just enough with out being over sweet.

Very good, but I found it to be a bit dry. I made it exactly as intructed, so maybe next time I will add more liquid to give it some moisture. I did not make the icing though, instead I made German Chocolate Frosting II from this website. Overall I am pleased with this combination and noticed that it was even better the 2nd day.

Wow this cake surpassed my expectations!  I replaced half the butter with applesauce (to make the cake more moist) and poured the batter into a 9x13 pan.  To combat wateriness in the topping, I used half the amount of milk and added a tablespoon of tapioca.  I also toasted the pecans and coconut before adding.  I am impressed with the flavor and my family gave it 5 stars, so I will be making it again.

This was a fantastic fantastic cake, and as it was my first time baking a cake from scratch, it came out wonderfully. I made it for a birthday party for my husband, and I got many postive reviews from everyone who tried it. I used the frosting recipe on the german chocolate box, and that was the perfect amount to frost the whole thing. I left off the chocolate drizzle because I didn't have time, but it would have been really good.

This was the best cake I've ever made! It was phenominal! Yes, it's one of the more difficult cakes, but it was well worth it. By difficult, I mean that it took forever to completely finish baking it, because I only had ONE 9in round pan... 
Super good!

Great Cake! Be sure to toast the coconut and pecans- it adds a great flavor to the frosting. Also, I would definitely double the frosting recipe. It may seem like too much, but it's really just about right. You'll have just enought left over to enjoy licking off the spoon!

I made this cake exactly as listed.  It was a lot of work but turned out beautiful.  Ultimately though, it was so much work for something that tasted about the same as Betty Crocker (but much prettier) that I am not sure if I will make again.

I had never made a German Chocolate Cake before but my pastor requested one for his birthday this year so I went on a search for the best one out there. This one fit the bill perfectly. It was a huge hit at the party. I ended up doubling the topping recipe, which tasted great, but it was so heavy that the cake started cracking apart under the weight. So be careful when you top it. Best GCC recipe.

This is the best cake ever, really. Yes, it will take some time and dirty some dishes but it's worth it. The filling does need to be done at 1 1/2 servings like everyone mentioned, I also added another ounce or so of extra chocolate to the cake mix (Lindt's), but I didn't need extra thickening for the filling. I also roasted the pecans and coconut and it tasted better that way. I added a ganache made from Lindt's 70% chocolate bar, and used it around the edges of each cake to drip down the sides, for a little extra chocolate. The cake is so light and tastes perfect, the filling is great too. I recommend this highly.

this was amazing. my family, that is abnormally picky about desserts, absolutely loved this cake! i toasted the coconut and pecans before adding them which made a big difference. also, i only had 2 9 inch pans so i just made it 2 layers and used the leftover batter as cupcakes. doing that, there was more than enough frosting for the cake. i also added some cornstarch to the frosting because it took forever to thicken. but this was one of the best cakes i've ever made!

Excellent recipe....my first time making a cake from scratch and it was easy to follow and turned out perfectly.  I did take a few tips from the reviewers and added non-fat plain yogurt to the cake mix for moisture, used cornstarch in the icing and made 1 and 1/2 times the icing...Also, as mentioned by a couple of reviewers, I was also careful not to overmix so there was no crumbling.

This cake is fantastic. I made it this weekend for an Oktoberfest party for my family and friends. The cake was very substantial and was practically inhaled! This was after a full meal of German food. I took the advice of others and doubled the frosting. I am very happy I did because it was delicious!

Very good.  The only thing I did different was to add 6 oz. of baker's sweet german chocolate and increased the vanilla to 1 1/2 t.  I think it gives the cake more flavor.  I 1 1/2 times the coconut pecan frosting, and added about 1 t. sifted cornstarch for thickening purposes.  Overall, this came out delicious.  I made it for a 50th birthday party at work and had wonderful compliments.  Well worth the time.

This cake didn't really turn out for me, but I don't blame the cake...I am a newbie baker so I'm sure I did something wrong.  The cake was dry and fell apart and I couldn't get the filling to thicken.  But I did try the cake on it's own and the filling on it's own and they tasted great so I gave it 4 stars.  Maybe I will try again when I have my mom around to coach me.

This cake is huge and delicious.Made it for my husband's birthday.Best cake he ever ate.
I had enough frosting for the sides.So would not double the icing.
I might use darker chocolate for the cake mix next time, or  add fat free chocolate powder.
Time consuming to make, but well worth it.

I made my cake out of 2 8" layers and used the rest of the batter to make cupcakes. I've never tasted german chocolate cake before but this cake was pretty good. I personally would've like more of a chocolatey flavor since it is a chocolate cake...but it was very moist and I enjoyed the crunch in the icing. Definately do 1 1/2 x the recipe of the icing and toast the nuts and coconut.

I made this cake for my brother's birthday and it turned out "OK" considering how much time went into it.  The filling would get 5+ stars form me and the cake would get between a 2-3.  I did make a few changes after reading the reviews here.  For starters I made the filling first so it had lots of time to cool.  I used 7oz of chocolate in the cake.  For the filling I did 1 1/2 times the recipe.  And I used 1/2 condensed milk and 1/2 evaporated milk.  I used unsweetened coconut, both small pieces and large ribbons, 1/2 cup extra of it, and toasted both the coconut and chopped pecans.  The filling was OUT of this world.  So fantastic!  The cake was a little dry and blah I thought.

Cake texture was really light and fluffy.  Made this for my husband's Birthday and he loved it!  I will say it took me about an hour to put it all together but it was well worth it.  I did add the additional German chocolate as suggested.

This cake is very moist.  I fixed this for my husband because he loves german chocolate cake.  He always is so eminent about his aunt's german chocolate cake, but after tasting this he rated it on the same level as her.

Delicious!  I used six semisweet chocolate squares.  Nice, moist and light.  I made it for a birthday celebration and it disappeared in no time.  I made it one night and served it the next; the frosting mellowed well, and was a big spoonful of creamy goodness.

Thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely delicious recipe!  If you want a really moist cake, try layering it with the coconut mixture while the cake is still warm.  You can't see the coconut mixture as well this way (it's not as pretty), but it tastes amazing.

I made this cake and took it to the office for everyone to try before making it for my boyfriend's birthday.  While everyone said the frosting was delicious and the cake was good they also commented that it was dry.  I also made the frosting first so that it had time to cool while the cake cooked. Overall - great cake!  Can anyone tell me why it might have been dry?

I thought this recipe was very good.  However, I have been using the German Chocolate Cake recipe given in the Baker's german choc. squares package for years.  If you match ingredient for ingredient they are almost identical.  However, their frosting recipe comes out in better proportion to the cake (one recipe of this one is not enough to cover the cake --doubled is too much).  I did flour the pan with cocoa and flour like a previous viewer suggested and it worked fine, the Baker's recipe recommends lining the bottom with paper.  I also toasted the nuts as recommend by another viewer and I will continue to do that in the future, it tastes much better than raw nuts on top.  I have always used 1/2 condensed milk and 1/2 evaporated milk for the frosting.  I think if you try this you will have a richer tasting frosting that takes less time to cook and stays in place on the cake better as well.  Good recipe--but similar to what I had.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday -- he requested a German Chocolate cake (his favorite).  The recipe takes quite a bit of effort to make and is very expensive, but it is worth all of the time and money.  It was delicious!  I followed another reviewers suggestion of making a creamy chocolate frosting as a base for the coconut frosting.  Everyone commented that is was better than what you would buy in a bakery (and it was about the same price).

This cake is fantastic!  The other reviews are spot-on - make 1 1/2x's the frosting the recipe calls for to fill between layers as well as top the cake.  Also, I had a hard time getting it to thicken.  Next time, I may use condensed milk, as one other review suggested.  Also, instead of straight flour, I lightly dusted the pan with a cocoa/flour mixture and it did not stick at all.  With a gas oven, I only baked the cake for 20 minutes, but it came out entirely done (if I'd left it for the 30 the recipe called for, it would have been horribly dry and burned).  So make sure to check the cake while baking so it doesn't overcook.  Because the frosting sort of glooped off the cake, it looks a right mess, but it tastes heavenly!!

My first time making one from scratch and it got rave reviews from everyone at the party. I was panicked when the batter was more like a chocolate mousse than a cake batter, but it was perfect when baked. Make this cake!

This cake turned out fantastic, and was pretty easy to make as well.  Using cake flour is a must to make ensure a light and fluffy texture, although it does seem slightly dry because the cake is so airy.  It's easily a 3 layer cake, so be prepared for a big cake.  Also I used the recipe for the "Frosting for German Chocolate Cake" due to a suggestion in one of the reviews, and I absolutely agree 100%, and will again use that frosting recipe.  Also toast the pecans and/or coconut for an added depth of flavor.

I have baked this cake twice, and both results were excellent.  It seems time consuming initially, but it's well worth it. I was not very sucessful with the chocolate drizzle, so I omitted it the second time. I also replaced the evaporated milk for sweetened condensed milk. This made the frosting thicker and easier to spread.  This is definitely a keeper.

Absolutely the best!  A little work but well worth it!  Make sure you boil the pecan filling for a few minutes, stirring constantly.  It thickens up perfect then.  AND, to really add flavor, throw in a 1 ounce cube of the semi-sweeet chocolate into the filling when cooking.  Wow!  That just makes it even more perfect.  And like others suggested, you do need a double batch of the filling and the chocolate topping.  But beware!  Do not try to ice this cake with a thick frosting.  I tried the first time and the cake fell apart.  It's too moist for a regular frosting.  Last night I made it again but this time I made cupcakes and put the pecan filling on top of each one and drizzled the chocolate over that.  They're absolutely beautiful!

Wow!! I have two important dinners coming , so I will need something nice to finish them off.  So I thought that I would try and make this before hand for my boyfriend.  He has a sweet tooth...I had no problem with the cake, but the filling was very hard to work with. So I added vanilla pudding, and that thickened it up some...The cake itself is very moist so when I went to place the top layer on it split in two...So glad this was just the sample one...Now I know what to do and what not to do...had a little nibble... very pleased...I just have to wait for the real taste tester my boyfriend...I'm not worried this cake will be on both dinner menus...It's worth the extra effort.  Thanks.

Wonderful recipe, very moist and great texture.  Two things you need to be careful with.  Make sure you put a total of 4 oz of German chocolate in and when you want to double the icing/filing you need to cook it a good half of an hour to get it thick enough for spreading.

This is absolutely fabulous.  I have been through many german chocolate cake recipes (hubby's favorite) and this one blows away all others.  It's light and fluffy - not heavy and the chocolate on top not only makes a great presentation but adds a great flavor.  Excellent!

This is such a great recipe.  Be sure to give the frosting a good rolling boil for thickening.  A mistake I made early on.

This cake was fantastic!  I'd never had German chocolate cake and actually didn't know what it was- I'd seen those chocolate cakes with coconut stuff and maraschino cherries on them at the store, but didn't know they had a name.  Anyway, I baked it for my grandpa's 72nd birthday (took three people to light all the candles!) because that's what he requested.  I did it just like the recipe said except I doubled the filling and added a package of pudding to it like others suggested.  Even though I frosted the entire cake with the filling, I still had a lot left over so next time I'll do one and one half times as much filling.  The filling was awesome- I didn't expect homemade filling like that to be as good, but it really was!  The cake itself was wonderful and fluffy, just like the other reviewers said.  Everyone kept talking about how fluffy it was, before that I didn't know cake could be fluffy!  I'll use even just the chocolate cake with different frostings in the future, as well, with another square of chocolate mixed in.  My aunt was sticking her finger in the chocolate on the sides of the cake and licking her fingers because she liked it so much, and they froze half of it to eat for my uncle's birthday a couple weeks later.  They said it was excellent thawed, too.

Ok, ok, ok so maybe there are a few more steps and it takes a little time.  This recipe is fantastic.  The cake was most and frosting was perfect.  It weighs a ton.  I doubled the frosting recipe and toasted both the coconut and the pecans before adding them.  I served it at a birthday party for Twenty-somethings and it was a big hit!

WOW!!!!!  I made this cake for my dad's birthday yesterday.  He had told my mom that he wanted a German Chocolate cake like she "used" to make. I found this recipe and it turned out FABULOUS!!!!
The cake is so light and moist! The WHOLE family loved it. My mom even told me it tasted like what her mom used to make....and that was a HUGE compliment!! I did double the filling like others suggested and it turned out perfect!!! Thanks!!!!

I baked this cake for a birthday in my office and received many compliments on it.  One of the women requested that I bake it for her birthday.  Even though I don't usually like nuts, the filling was a nice blend of pecan flavor with the custard.

I was looking for a new german chocolate recipe.  I found it!!!  Cake was extremely moist and filling and icing was terrific too!  I too, increased the filling by half but I also four times the icing to ensure I had enough to create a unique drizzle design on finished cake.  It is absolutley scrumptious and mine is actually beautiful in presentation.  My husband and family loved it!!!  It will be my permanent GC recipe.  Thanks Dean!

I DO NOT like German Chocolate cake.  I only made this because it is my boyfriend's favorite and it was his birthday.  The cake is WONDERFUL!!  I couldn't believe it.  It is so rich.  Not something I would make every day, but well worth the effort.This was also the first cake I ever made from scratch and it was so EASY!

Great recipe although I doubled the amount of icing.  Otherwise there wouldn't have been enough to cover the cake and all three layers.  Very moist cake.

I had some problems with the filling on this, so I thought I'd warn future bakers of this cake. I couldn't get it to thicken.  Luckily, I had some instant vanilla pudding mix on hand (cornstarch would probably work, too, but I was out of it), and this solved the problem.  It definitely was NOT a beautiful cake, but it sure did taste good!  The secret is the whipped egg whites--they make it light, moist and fluffy.

Absolutely heavenly even though it is time consuming like it states here.  My family LOVED IT!  First G.Choc. I've made - no need to look for another!!! There was enough frosting for the sides although it was a little tight (daughter insisted on sides frosted).  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE!

I wish I would have read the reviews before making it. 30 minutes is definitely too long in the oven. It was a lot of work for it to turn out dry. It really needed a simple syrup to put moisture back into it. I would also recommend making twice the amount of chocolate dripping.

I have made it before, but in order for the cake layers to be higher you have to use the regular size pans, not the deep ones. You will have to adjust the recipe for the deep pans.

Turned out perfect! My husband loved it! Next time I’ll make 1 1/2 times the filling per hubbys request and a little more chocolate drizzle, but the filling was just sweet enough and the cake light and moist! I’d make it over and over!

This is the best cake I have ever made.  I've now made it three times and everytime I get compliments on how delicious and moist this cake is.  My husband doesn't like chocolate cake but will devour this one.  Also, the frosting is perfect and so much better than you will ever get from the jars.  My boys don't like frosting but also love this one with the great texture of coconut, pecans in a caramel base. I do double the frosting so that I have enough to put around the side to cover the entire cake.  One batch would not be enough.  I do not put the chocolate drizzle on top.  I don't think it needs it for us.  It is sweet and rich enough.  Yes.  This is now my go to recipe for German Chocolate Cake!

I make a German chocolate cake every year for my dad's birthday and this recipe was a huge hit! The cake was moist and the coconut-pecan filling was excellent - the best we've ever tasted.  Based on the reviews (and family preferences) here are the adaptations I made.  1) I lightly toasted the coconuts and pecans; 2) I used the coconut-pecan frosting to fill between layers and on the top of the cake but made a chocolate ganache frosting for the sides and some decorating; 3) I couldn't find German sweet chocolate, so I used semi-sweet and the cake tasted fine.  If I were going to frost the whole cake with the coconut-pecan filling, I would have doubled the batch.  I will definitely make this cake again!

This was so fun to make! Thanks to all of the previous bakers for your suggestions.I would say that doubling the frosting recipe would be even more appropriate than 1.5 times the original. I also agree that the look of the cake is really striking if frosting is omitted from the sides. With the double batch of frosting, more would’ve been spilling out the sides on mine which I would’ve liked.

Worst cake ever!  Where the baking powder?  It barely rose.  I ended up with two frisbee & soggy frosting. German chocolate is my favorite!  This was my birthday cake

Omg what an amazing cake.  Followed the instructions except made extra of the topping and added about 1/4 cornstarch because it wouldn’t set up. 

A lot of time but well worth the special occasion. 

Thanks Dean!

This cake was awesome! After reading many of the reviews the only change was to toast the coconut and peacans. I see why this was such a hit.  Wow!  we will make it again and again

When my husbands ex-wife said “Marge (my mother-in-law) would turn over in her grave, this is so good and better than hers!” Then, this size 2 woman ate 3 pieces, instead of her granddaughter’s birthday pie, I knew I had nailed it!

The only reason I am giving this cake two stars is because the frosting tasted delicious. The cake does not have enough chocolate in the recipe. I think it should have called for an entire bar (4oz) of sweet german chocolate, because the 1oz provided no chocolate flavor in the cake whatsoever when it was completed. Also, in terms of frosting, this did not yield enough for a true German chocolate cake. I will not be using this recipe again and I am pretty disappointed, even though the outcome was tasty :(

This was A LOT of work! I foolishly didn't read the reviews before and only made one batch of the icing. I didn't have enough to cover the layers and the top. I was so exhausted by the end of the process (and time had run out!), making another batch wasn't an option. I supplemented with some store-bought fudge icing in the layers. I'm quite baffled as to why it would recommend such a small amount when the picture shows the entire cake covered. I would definitely double - not 1.5 like some have suggested. Without enough icing, it was good but not great. The cake was light and fluffy. My husband loved the consistency. We just wanted more icing.

Never again - epic fail.  The filling is yummy - I did add 3 T corn syrup to the filling.  It was more than thick enough.  I did not use the chocolate icing  in the recipe so cant comment - made my own yummy chocolate frosting.  The problem was the cake itself.  Given all the prior comments, I lined the entire pan with parchment paper and had no problems with the cake sticking to pan.  Howeve, the cake is very dry and crumbly so I had problem spreading the filling and frosting on the cake because the cake crumbled as I spread the frosting.  Aside from being dry, the cake had little flavor.   In the future I will use the recipe for the filling with a chocolate box cake.

made per recipe, cakes come out very crumbly they fall apart as u try to frost them. taste was good. even heated up frosting to make it spread easier but just no way to keep these together very fragile also the frosting is not enough to frost 3 layers. maybe if u chopped pecans to very fine so as to make layer thinner. 
 overall due to the cakes not holding together it was a disaster .

I added 2oz more German Chocolate.  The cakes tasted good although they fell apart.  Next time I am going to try the tip I saw about freezing them.  Also I doubled the frosting but it never did thicken up and just slid off the top of the cake into a puddle.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very close to an old family recipe. My mom loves it and she is very picky about her german chocolate cake, since it is her favorite.  It takes awhile to make it but it is worth it! I would recommend doubling the frosting because you will need it.

Great cake recipe. Light. Airy. Did not use German Sweet Chocolate to keep sweetness down. Frosting recipe is right on and perfect. Did not use the chocolate drizzle to keep it more traditional.

Love this recipe! Ck the cake and do not over bake! I made a batch and a half of the frosting. I prefer frosting the whole cake.  I wasn't crazy about the chocolate "drippings." It was too thick. I would rather make a small batch of chocolate ganache. I'll do that next time. Maybe poke holes in the cake and run it down the cake itself before putting on the coconut frosting. It turned out beautiful.

I am so upset!!!! I cook on a daily basis, bake on a near daily basis. I bought 8 ounces of German Sweet chocolate for this recipe (thinking it called for only 4 oz I just wanted to be safe) when I went to bake it, the 4 (1 ounce) squares confused the mess out of me! I figured the cake just wasn't super chocolate-y because I've never had a German chocolate cake.

This is a yummy recipe! I've made it twice and no problem either time. If u like to cover the cake in frosting I'd recommend making more icing but it's just enough for layers and top and smudge a bit around the cake! My mum and brother love German chocolate cake and this is their fav when I make it!

This was my first time ever attempting a German Chocolate cake and it was a total flop. The cake stuck to the pans even though I followed the directions and greased/floured them.  It also took way longer than 30 minutes to bake. I think I  followed the directions to a T but it just didn't turn out. I'm really sad because my husband wanted this for his birthday and now I have to go find one already made.  I'm a sad panda.

I made this for a diabetic with changes and it is sooo good! Instead of white flour I used whole wheat flour. Instead of buttermilk I used unsweetened almond milk with 1 tsp cider vinegar. I also added  1 pkg sugar free butterscotch pudding. Instead of semi sweet chocolate I used 1/4 cup cocoa in 1/2 cup water with 2 tsp of stevia and 1/2 tbls butter and microwaved for 30 seconds. Instead of evaporated milk I used unsweetened almond milk with 2 tblsp of flour. I was out of corn starch.  It made 3 one layer cakes. I think at about 15 gms carbohydrates per piece. I froze one for later. I agree it only took me 15 minutes to cook the cake.

I made these into cupcakes since they're easier to share.

Notes:
- I halved this recipe and it made 16 normal, 1/4 cup cupcakes. 
- Halving the topping produced enough to top all 16 cupcakes. 
- DO NOT fill the cupcake liners more than 1/2 or they will overflow (learned the hard way). 
- At 4700 ft altitude, it took 21 minutes at 350.
- Garnished with the chocolate drizzle and strawberries.
- 2 hours total time.

My husband loves this cake he says it is the best German Chocolate he has ever had. I made a double batch of frosting so I could coat the whole cake in it. One batch will only frost the top and give you enough for the middle. The frosting is very hard to get to stick if you don't let it cool long enough so here is my trick. I make the frosting the night before and put it in the fridge. The day I am going to make the cake I set the frosting out on the counter in the morning to get to room temp. This process allows the frosting to set up and not be too hard to spread on the cake when you are ready, it comes out perfect.

I made this yesterday.  I increased the filling as suggested in other reviews. I made the cake as written and it was awesome! The other reviewers that recommended adding more chocolate are incorrect. " I do not think this means what you think it means"  German chocolate cake is not supposed to be overly chocolatey.  One other thing, I did not have cake flour on hand. I used all purpose flour, but decreased the amount to 2 1/4 cups to compensate. Fantastic.   I wanted German Chocolate cake but I didn't want to bother with decreasing my "professional recipe". I finished the cake with chocolate Italian Buttercream.

We loved this cake! However, the icing was not enough, and I had to add cornstarch to thicken it. Next time I will double the recipe for the icing as well as forget about the chocolate drizzle... it was totally unnecessary and seemed out of place once I did it. My husband commented that he would have rather had the cake itself be more "chocolatey", and I appreciate that info too. Next time I will look into how to accomplish that.

I made this cake for Christmas.  It was delicious and moist and everyone loved it! There are a few more steps, but the time should be taken to make this and not buy a boxed mix!!  I will keep this recipe, thank you for sharing!!

Note: I purchased a canned frosting.

Got comments of "best german  chocolate cake I've ever had"

Hint - double the icing recipe portion.  The coconut mixture was really only enough for the filling.

I made this for a friend's birthday  -  I had to hand beat it, and I think I used AP flour instead of cake flour, but it was AMAZING. So good that when her birthday came around the next year, I got requests to make the same cake. This one is a favorite!

Cake has good flavor but not nearly moist enough. And omg the icing has ruined my whole day. No indication as to how long to heat the icing or what consistency to look for before pulling it off the heat to cool. Not enough icing for the sides, which is just ugly, and I'm left with a runny mess coming from in between the layers. All over the place. Even after cooling in the fridge for over an hour. A few detail words go a long way. I won't make this again. Wasted time and money trying to make this for my father's birthday since my grandmother can't do it anymore and I'm just pissed about the flimsy icing and undetailed instructions.

We would have rated this as 10 stars if we could have.  This is the best German chocolate cake we've ever had - it's so moist.  We only had to bake ours for 25 minutes.  Thank you for this fantastic recipe.

Good flavour but way to dry . Do not use cake flour, keep to the original recipe Bakers German cake chocolate recipe and use regular flour.

I only made the frosting. It was such a flop for me. I'll admit probably my own fault as I must have had the heat on too high when cooking the frosting. My eggs cooked up into little clumps of yolk that I couldn't fish out and it never firmed up so I had to add tons of powdered sugar which then made it taste and look chalky and overly sweet.

I made this for a birthday cake, and it was worthy of a special occasion. It is fairly involved to make, but worth the time and effort. The only change I made was doubling the frosting and frosting the entire cake. The chocolate drizzle adds an extra hit of chocolate flavor, and looks nice as well. I'm not at all good at making cakes come out "pretty," but was happy with how this one looked. I'll definitely make it again.

Great recipe!! I also had runny icing before I read the reviews! I ended up turning up the heat so that the sugar could caramelize with the milk and it turned out perfectly!

5 stars isn't enough!  This cake is moist and will become any one's favorite cake!!!  I followed the directions exactly, I did start checking the cake at 20 minutes per several reviews and it was perfect.  All my family loves this cake!
I make extra icing for the sides of the cake 1 1/2 recipes, I didn't like the chocolate on the sides of the cake nearly as much as I loved the icing!!

Oh my...this cake is AMAZING.  I admit that when I was making the frosting, visually I was afraid that it would not be enough. I stuck with the recipe though, and even though it didn't LOOK like enough frosting, taste-wise, the ratio of cake to frosting was perfect!  Not only that, the cake itself was light, moist, and absolutely delicious.  I baked for 25 minutes in my oven, and after allowing about 45 minutes to cool, the cakes popped right out of the pans no problem. Love this recipe!

The whole recipe was wonderful and tasted delicious. I altered the recipe a little instead of adding a cup of Buttermilk I used half a cup of coconut milk and half a cup of buttermilk. The only thing that was disappointing is, it was not enough frosting. So you would need to make 1 1/2 or double the icing. Instead of making the drizzle I made a chocolate icing with butter, coconut milk, and semi sweet chocolate, melted, and powdered sugar.

I only made the cake portion of this recipe, so I can't speak to the frosting portion, but the cake was EXCELLENT!! Soft, moist, and flavorful--it will be made again! I used the frosting recipe on here named "German Chocolate Cake Frosting II."

The frosting was outstanding. The cake was just dry. Also, had to add more chocolate to get the batter to taste even remotely chocolate.

This is a fantastic cake!!  I have made 3 times and always a huge hit.  Everyone loved it .  I gave 4 instead of 5 stars, because I simply don't agree it takes only 30 min. prep and 30 min. bake and done in one hour.  It takes me 3 hours.  Maybe other people can cook faster faster, but I don't believe this done in one hour.  The cooking time should be changed.

A very sweet cake; too sticky and sweet for my preferences.  Topping is thin as well.

I toasted the pecans but not the coconut as I like the chewy texture of the untoasted coconut.

this is the second time I made it - love the cake part - the icing is making me crazy!! The first time I gave up on the icing thickening ever - bought a can of the stuff - this time it's the same story - it won't thicken enough to spread....guess I won't try it a third time.
I wish the recipe was clearer - it says heat over lo heat stirring constantly until it thickens - how thick should it be when you stop stirring??  approximately how long should you let it heat? I stirred over lo heat for 15 minutes an hour ago and it's still just sitting there cooling and still not thick enough to spread - HELP!!

This cake is great every time I make up! I have made it without changing any ingredients because it's great just the way it is all but two times.I forgot my buttermilk, so I went online and found out how to make homemade buttermilk, and it turned out great those times too! Everyone always asked me to make it every time I go to someone's house. Every holiday too.make sure you have enough time, there's a lot of steps. It is well worth all the steps and all the time! Here's the recipe I use for making homemade buttermilk – One cup of milk 4 1/2 teaspoons of lemon mix together and let stand for 15 minutes stir a couple of times within the 15 min you let it stand.

A very nice cake.  The recipe didn't mention what the shortening was for, so I didn't use it.  I also increased the amount of chocolate to 100g and omitted the water.  It was very light and the frosting was not too sweet.  I also had to convert all the measurements to UK weights....would have been nice to for the website to give the option of a conversion!

I made this for my sister's birthday upon her request for a German Chocolate Cake. This is by far the best cake of any kind I have ever made and the whole family raved about it. This is moist, fluffy and has wonderful flavor. So glad my sister requested it as German Chocolate Cake has never been my go to - but maybe now that I have found this recipe it will be!

I love baking cakes for friends birthdays. German Chocolate Cakes seem to be many people's favorite, so I have occasion to make them fairly often. They are quite a labor of love, but there is nothing like the feeling you have when people take a bite and proclaim it "the best xxxx they've ever eaten" (even if they are saying it out of kindness. I've tried about 5 different recipes.  All things being equal, this German Chocolate Cake, while definitely good, wasn't #1 in my book. In case you're wondering, I prefer the recipe from "Joy of Cooking" or America's Test Kitchen for texture/flavor.

Wonderful!   I have made this several times and living here in Germany there are many  a connoisseur of German cakes here and this cake has been a hit time and time again.
I do use organic raw sugar, Himalayan Salt, Irish butter and organic coconut . I do not use 'shorting' because is it known to shorten your life span.  ONLY real butter from grass fed cows for our family. :)
Also, I did not have 3 baking pans so I used my spring form and then cut the cake in half.  Did the job.

I made this recipe exactly to directions. I was a good flavor, not too sweet or unsweet. I just didn't find it to be anything special. I also felt something was off about it, I felt like it had too much of a floury taste. 

Here are some FYI's in relation to other peoples concerns or tips 
I didn't find it dry
I checked every 5 mins after the 15 min park and i ended up baking a total of 25 mins
I used pam flour baking spray so I had no issues with it sticking
I filled two 9 inch pans the regular amount and a pan with 6 cupcakes, but it still over flowed. There is definitely enough for 3 pans.
I had no problem with the chocolate melting with the water and I did use bakers chocolate brand.

made this yesterday for my mans b-day. Never made GCC before and this was amazing!! Should get 10 stars... super easy. The only thing to remember when making the frosting.. cook at least 10-12 minutes so the eggs cook. Mine was soupy and I added 1 tsp then another of corn starch- that did the trick! never tasted it... he said it was the best cake he ever had and even had a slice for breakfast..

Absolutely delicious! I toast my coconut and pecans and chop them into small pieces. I also use a gluten free flour mixture. Turns out great & you cannot tell it is GF. I also use this recipe and make as directed then mush it all together to make cake pops that are moist, delicious and out of this world!! This IS my go to recipe! Thanks for sharing it!

I made a couple of changes to this recipe: put in 6 oz of chocolate, toasted the coconut/nuts, and used gluten free flour. It is delicious!! Great recipe, I only toasted the nuts and coconut out of personal preference.

Perfect! I used a different filling recipe, however, the cake is perfect!! I make and decorate cakes. I have done the Bakers recipe and found it dry...although no one else noticed or said anything, I notice, I can't even stand box cake. I will never try another recipe, this one is it! Not dry at all, very fluffy.

This recipe looked intimidating since i am not a baker, but i followed the instructions exactly. the cake was incredible. rave reviews from adults and children including some very picky people. super moist with great flavor, still tasted very fresh the next day. the frosting took longer than 12 minutes, i would say about 20. once the mixture came to a boil i waited for it to thicken as it bubbled. then i added the coconut and pecans and let it cool completely before use.i will definitely use this again, especially the cake recipe and try different types of icing.

I am thrilled with the results of following most of this formula. This cake is an American classic, and so it comes with certain expectations.  I always expect a German's Chocolate Cake to be softer and sweeter, buttery and coconutty.  This formula delivers! 

Some adjustments I made: The cake I made exactly as instructed. I needed a six inch cake, so I had enough batter for three six inch layers, and one eight inch layer for my family to keep. I did not follow the frosting recipe at all. Instead, I used the one inside the box of chocolate squares. I toasted the nuts and half the coconut. I only added  the toasted coconut to the frosting, reserving the raw coconut for garnish. As for the chocolate sauce, I never use shortening in frosting or sauces. Butter has a lower melting point which results in better mouthfeel.  I melted the butter on low heat to keep it from scorching, chopped the chocolate into small bits, and after removing the melted butter from the heat, immediately added the chopped chocolate and stirred it after the chocolate was mostly melted. I used 1 oz. of chocolate and a tablespoon of butter. It turned out perfectly.

This cake was delicious! Here are my tips: you will need to double the frosting and it takes closer to an hour to thicken, I just played a movie on my phone while I was stirring :-) I also toasted the coconut and pecans, being careful not to burn them. I would recommend letting the bottom of the pan soak in hot water for a couple of minutes so that the cake comes out of the pan perfectly. Finally, they only took 20 minutes in my oven, so make sure you check them before 30 minutes! Enjoy :-)

The frosting was so thin, it poured like water. The flavor of the cake was good, but not for the amount of effort that went into it.

Did not like the texture using cake flour.  Will try again using AP flour.  Good flavor, not too sweet.

I made this for my mom as her Christmas present. My parents are pretty picky when it comes to desserts especially cakes! But they said this was the best German Chocolate cake they've had! (and they don't lie to make me feel special) This is despite my adjustments: I ran out of eggs and butter part way through, so my frosting didn't have any egg. I was only short 1/4 a cup of butter so i split it between the cake and the frosting. Turns out this was a good mistake! The cake is plenty buttery and my parents liked the frosting much more!
***IF YOU LIKE REALLY DENSE & MOIST CAKE*** use 2 pans instead of 3

This was my first time trying this recipe.   I was under a lot of pressure because my boyfriend's mother was notorious for making german chocolate cake. When she tried it she said it was moist and delicious.   A huge compliment to me and this recipe.  Will definitely keep and use this recipe again.

First time I made a homemade German Chocolate cake, so I thought with this many reviews that I would follow it exactly.  This was for my husbands birthday.  IT WAS EXCELLENT!!!!  Please people if you make this cake follow it exactly if you plan to review.  Now that I have made it once I do plan to add just a little more chocolate to the batter,  NOTHING else.  German Chocolate Cake is much lighter than other chocolate cakes and I personally want it a little more chocolatey.  It was very light.  Thank you for a beautiful recipe.  Oh and there are lots of hints on the web that tell you how to substitute all purpose flour for cake flour.  DON'T do IT!  There is a lot of work that goes into this cake to have it turn out more course!!!!  LOVE THIS RECIPE!!  Oh and my husband LOVED IT!!!

I made this for my step-dad's birthday today. It turned out great,  but that could be because I made a few modifications to the recipe! I changed the 1/2 cup of water to 1/2 cup of strong coffee. I usually do this for any chocolatey recipe that calls for water. I also added 2 more ounces of chocolate. The cakes in the photos didn't look chocolatey enough for me. I also lightly toasted the coconut and pecans for the frosting. 

The cake turned out great. The texture was almost silky. I had an issue getting the cake out of the pans, but that was my own fault. I left the cake layers in the pans too long, which causes condensation on the bottom. So I kind of ripped the bottom out of a couple of layers.

The frosting is another story. It tasted AMAZING. I don't even like German Chocolate cake and I LOVED it!!! However, it's so runny! I tried everything suggested in other reviews. I cooled it. I mixed vanilla pudding mix into it. Corn starch. Everything! It was just relentlessly runny. This sucked for several reasons. The obvious problem is my cake didn't look pretty. I made it for a birthday dinner, so I really wanted it to look nice. The other problem is the icing oozed out of the sides. So when I cut the cake, there wasn't much filling between layers. That really took away from the overall taste. 

So all in all, the cake was completely, totally perfect (with a few modifications). The frosting, although tasty, is impractical. I'll make it again, but use a different frosting.

I hadn't made a cake from scratch in 30 years, but I followed this recipe carefully and it was outstanding. Other reviewers said to double the frosting, so I did - but even with frosting the sides I ended up with too much. One and a half times the frosting amount would have been just right. It was still moist and tender several days later. It took me about 2 hours to make, though, including chopping/toasting the pecans and toasting the coconut. Next time I'll do that ahead of time. Highly recommend!

This was a great hit at my aunt's birthday party. I did make 1.5 amount of icing and I only did 2 layers instead of three because I was having problems getting it out of the pan. It I was super messy but worth it. I did get a decent workout from mixing everything by hand.

I have made German Chocolate cake several times. Compared to the recipe off the chocolate bar box, I like the box recipe better... I live at a very high altitude, so I increased the flour to 2 1/2 C like this recipe says too. I also turned the oven down to 325 and cook about 35 - 40 mins depending on cake pan size/depth. They turned out perfect! 1 hr prep time is not accurate though after prepping/making everything. It takes me roughly 2 1/2 hrs every time i make this cake....

I have my mom's recipe for german chocolate cake, which is fabulous, but was seeing what else was out there.  Based on the reviews for this cake I decided to compare it's ingredients to my mom's recipe to see how/why it was different.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it is EXACTLY the same recipe!  Except my mom's recipe for the frosting adds a bit more of each ingredient to allow for more frosting.  I think this is funny because in the reviews people said to make 1 1/2 recipes for the frosting because one isn't enough.  I guess my mom did know something afterall !  Thanks mom  :)

This was my first time making a german chocolate cake and it was for my husband's birthday. The batter tasted amazing lol we will see how it is when he gets home :) It was very easy and step by step. I was afraid that I would over cook the icing so I believe that I could have cooked it a little longer.

My husband and I had company one special Sunday evening. I had never made a scratch cake, but had experienced my mother's German Chocolate Cake every Thanksgiving and Christmas. I once had her recipe for the frosting, but no longer have it, and since she is gone, cannot get it from her. I typed German Chocolate Cake into my search engine, and up popped allrecipes.com, with the recipe for the cake. I was so excited!! One thing that really helped me was to have the video, since I am not familiar with all of the cooking terms. It helped me to see that my batter looked as it should. The cake was a huge success!! Everyone loved it. I called it the five hour cake because that is how long it took me to make it--this first time. I am sure that it will not take as long next time. I must agree, though, with the voice on the video: It is a very involved cake!!One couple who attendeded the special Sunday always invites people to Christmas dinner, where they have a spread of delicious food, including deserts. She even contributed her dressing one year to my dinner. Last Sunday, she told me that she still thought about the cake (about three Sundays later) and said that it tasted better than the German Chocolate that she had made; she asked about the recipe I used. I told her the website, and then was proud to say that I could contribute a German Chocolate cake to her dinner. It is a five-star recipe!

Excellent! It was, admittedly, more steps and work than I usually put into cake baking, but it was well worth it. Everyone agreed that it was exceptional.

I have baked German Chocolate Cakes for years.  As I sit here and watch the sides of the cake fall off I wish I had stuck to my recipe instead of trying this one using cake flour.  Now I know why the glaze on the sides is a must!

I made this cake as printed. I always want to give the chef who posted it the benefit of the doubt.  Glad I did, this cake is fabulous!  Unlike other posts, the filling was plentiful. Were they trying to use filling on the sides of the cake??
A couple of suggestions:
1.  If you only have one mixer, beat the egg whites first, transfer to a separate bowl, and then use the mixer bowl to prepare the yolk, buttermilk, etc. part of the recipe.  (No need to wash the mixer bowl between the two uses.)
2.  Years ago I purchased heat wraps for my cake tins. These are great for preventing the cake edges from drying out while the cake bakes. This is especially useful for cakes such as this one that is not iced on the sides.
3. Beware, we ate a slice of this cake as our supper in the evening and then a slice as our lunch the next day. It is that good!

I made this cake for my daughter's 16th birthday.  Let me say, it was the hit of the celebration.  My husband said it was the best German Chocolate Cake he had ever eaten!  I followed the original recipe and it was amazing.  The time spent was well worth it.

My husband loves German chocolate cake so I found this recipe to make for his birthday cake.  I have never had german chocolate cake before so I have nothing to compare it to but I loved this cake and more importantly my husband was in love with it.  So good!

delicious! Made this for Father's Day 2012 and everyone loved it!  I did double the icing recipe though, I believe... not enough otherwise.

Only made the cake and not the filling, and found cake to be wonderfully fluffy, moist and delicious.  My mother needed a cake to put under some peanut butter frosting she was dying to try, and this worked perfectly.  Mild/yummy enough for my mother who isnt a huge fan of chocolate, and enough flavor to complement the peanut butter!  Notes:  I was careful not to over mix, and because I only separated batter into 2 pans I did cook for about 45 min.

Made this cake for a birthday party with some very tough critics and they loved it. Followed the directions all the way except I shaved Hersheys chocolate on the top instead of melting and drizzling. (first time I made this cake I used All Purpose flour and it was not nearly as impressive as this time.)

Amazing cake, but the frosting gave me an immense amount of trouble. I just didnt know how thick it was supposed to get (without letting it burn). By reading from the other peoples' experiences, I can see that it took much longer to cook the frosting than was expected. I did let it set in the fridge and that helped, but once at room temp again, it got a bit runny. It still tastes great, but being the perfectionist I am, I am not happy with the presentation. I think I will look for a new frosting recipe next time, but the cake was fluffy and decadent.

The cake was delicious! I accidently bought mint chocolate... IT WAS AMAZING. I think it even tasted better the normal chocolate. I had a hard time with the icing but it turned out really great! It was a big hit with everyone of my family! Thank you for this great recipe.

This was a LOT of work (many steps, and Lord! so MANY dirty dishes), but while cutting and serving my GORGEOUS, THREE-TIERED MASTERPIECE, I was very proud of the results.  I did increase the chocolate to 6 squares as suggested by others, but that was my only deviation from the recipe as written.   Although I too would classify this as a "special occasions only" kind of recipe due to its complexity, I would definitely make it again.

This is pretty much the exact same recipe on the box of German chocolate I bought. There should be a disclaimer somewhere. That being said, it's a great recipe. VERY time consuming- something I'll save to make on special occasions.

This was the first time I made a German Chocolate Cake from scratch, and it was delicious! I made it for a Birthday at work and everyone loved it.  My boss said it was the best GCC he has tasted and he wasn't saying it just to be nice.

Wow, this was wonderful.  I followed the receipe exactly, just had to add some confectioners sugar and vanilla pudding to thicken the frosting.   Put the cake in the refrigerator before icing, and it kept it firm and easy to frost.  Major hit at the office.  Made it for a co-workers Birthday, and he said it was the best he's ever had.   Will definitely make again.

This was a great cake. Time consuming but really good. The icing took me about 1 hour to make in itself, but was my favorite part of this cake. My cake wasn't quite done all the way through, but that's my fault and not a fault in the recipe. I did toast the coconut before adding it to the icing mixture.

My family RAVED about this cake. It was fantastic. Some of the advise I followed was adding 6 oz chocalate to the cake mix. You need 1-1/2 portions for the frosting as others recommended.  Definatley brown the pecans and coconut.  I didn't know how "thickened" it should be while I cooked the frosting on the stove. I had to add powder sugar to it later to thicken it up. It was FANTASTIC frosting. This will be my "go to" recipe for German Chocolate Cake!!!!!

First off I do not lik german chocolate cake. I am not a fan of coconut or nuts. My boyfriend loves it though. since i got into baking I had not made him one yet and I decided to finally do it. I love the cake part of this recipe.It was amazing, and the frosting had a good tase to it(besides the things I dont like)I didnt get the frosting as thick as it needed to be too frost so it was kind of a mess next time I will boil longer. I also did the extra bit of frosting like mentioned in other reviews,and the cake does need it. I only gave four because of the things I dont like otherwise itis without a doubt a 5

excellent..bravo..superb recipe!!turned out great..couldnt help writing a review!i made some changes however..instead of using 3 9inch pans i used one big pan and horizontally cut the cake into two for the icing..couldnt find pecans used very few walnuts instead..and ironically couldnt find german chocolate used dairy milk instead!! ;p :p however hats off to this recipe got rave reviews everywhere!and one thing i recommend strongly..do not use a steel base saucepan for making the icing it will stick to the pan in no time and get burnt..i had to change pans to a non stick pan..was much easier..other than that had fun making the cake hope you enjoy it too!! =)

This cake was really fun to make! I made it for my Dad's 60th birthday and it's his favorite. I didn't cook the frosting long enough, so it's pretty runny, but still really good. I am chilling it right now to see if it will thicken at all. It still looks so good though. I doubt we have any problems eating it!

I followed this cake exactly and found it to be a bit on the dry side, of course it could have been the altitude. I also had a hard time whipping my egg whites to stiff peaks, I got to soft peaks at best and it stopped forming....hmmmm... so I ended up using the semi formed egg whites which may or may not have affected the texture of the cake. I also used a different recipe for the frosting, so that may have been why as well ( although the frosting I used was almost identical in ingredients just made more).. I think the substituting the buttermilk for plain full fat yogurt would have kept it moister. All in all, this cake was very decadent, and the frosting I used more than made up for the dryness.... It went over well for the birthday party I made it for... I will however try a different cake recipe next time if I decide to bake this again.

This wasn't an easy cake to make, but it was so much fun and EVERYONE loved it - even my brother who hates coconut and any strong flavor.  My german grandma even said it was delicious - and in our house, that takes A LOT!

This cake turned out light, fluffy, and moist.  I used the recipe for the filling on the box of Baker's Chocolate.  I also used the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe (found on this site) to ice the sides of the cake.  The presentation was very nice.

Very light and fluffy. The prep time wasn't quite accurate. The filling took quite a long time to thicken and also it wasn't nearly enough to go between both layers and also on the sides and top.  Make sure you stir continuously as stated otherwise you'll end up with bits of cooked egg in your filling.  It was delicious though and quite a hit at my dinner party!

As others have said this is the recipe on the German Chocolate box with the change in the flour (cake vs. regular and 1/2 cup more).  This recipe is delicious!  It is a favorite of my family.

Awesome, awesome cake!  It was soft and did crumble a bit, but wow was it good.  It was the best german chocolate I have ever had.  The icing did require a bit of corn starch to thicken up, but turned out great.  Make this cake, and you won't be sorry.

Made this cake exactly as directed and it came out amazing!  The frosting was a little frustrating because it just wouldn't thicken.  I was afraid to turn the heat up because I didn't want to burn the liquid.  I was able to thicken it with more coconut and pecans (and a little more heat from the stove).  It was great!  I was never a fan of german chocolate cake until I made this, now it is my favorite!  It is a cake that will impress, for sure!

This cake was to die for! It was well worth all of the effort. I messed up the filling the first time not letting it get thick enough. I salvaged it though by bringing it to a boil after I had added the coconut and pecans. I used that batch between the layers and made another batch which cooked on medium heat for about 14 minutes for the top and sides. I made it for my boyfriend for our 1 year anniversary and lets just say he is deffinately stickin around for more!

My son and I made this for Daddy's birthday, German Chocolate Cake is his favorite. He was very pleased and so was I. This cake is wonderful and moist. I did take the advice from the other reviewers and doubled the frosting and I'm glad I did. Wonderful recipe Dean, thanks for sharing!!

This was amazingly good.  I couldn't find any German Chocolate anywhere, so I used Ghiradelli instead.  I think I would use a little more next time, but it was still super great.  Make at least 1 1/2 times as much frosting as it says, if not twice as much, if you want to frost the sides, too.  Definitely toast the coconut and pecans.  It might not seem like it will make much of a difference, but it really will.

I personally don't like German chocolate cake (icky coconut) but my husband loves it and requested it as his birthday cake this year. I made two layers instead of three and I didn't put the chocolate glaze on at the end. I don't think it was needed and I was to tired by the time I was done making the cake and frosting it. It still turned out great. All my guests including my husband said it was the BEST German choc. cake they had ever tasted. It is labor intensive but I guess worth it because everyone loved it!!

First time I tried this recipe.  Came out great -- even the kids liked it. In error, I doubled the German Sweet Chocolate and it was still awesome.  Thanks for a great recipe!  This is a keeper!

Wow. I've never made German chocolate cake before, and while this recipe does take a little more time, it is TOTALLY worth it. I used bakers grease dusted with flour and had no problem removing the cakes each of the 3 or 4 times I've made this. I used the German Chocolate Cake Icing II instead of this one, and made sure to toast the coconut and pecans before I put them in. I doubled the chocolate on top (it gives such a nice extra something that more was definitely in order) and made a little more icing.   People who've had German chocolate cakes for years said this gave them a run for their money. Awesome.

My husband requested that I make a German Chocolate cake for his birthday, because his mother would always make it for him during his youth.  I had a birthday BBQ in honor of him, and it was a hit!!  His mother and father told me that it was the best they had ever had, and she was retiring from making hers!!  I am now the official German Chocolate Cake maker in the family!  Thanks for sharing your fabulous recipe!  I followed the recipe just as it was written.  I did however follow the suggestion of not "over mixing" - mine did not "fall apart."

My grandkids and I made this for my birthday this weekend and it was absolutely fantastic!  We followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out great.  The cake was moist and the coconut topping was excellent, we had a can of chocolate frosting and put that on the sides, it was as beautiful as any cake purchased at a bakery.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made this for my husband on Valentines day. He litterally ate the whole thing! I on the otherhand was not too impressed. I found that the frosting was really runny, it soaked through the middle of the cake and sort of made it soggy. I had to do something for the top layer so i through it back on the stove and added some extra coconut to thicken it. I will proabaly try a differnt icing next time. The actual cake was great though.

The cake was really good. Either my pans are deep or something didn't go right. I don't really like havng thin layers of cake and two of these fell apart. I left the filling on the stove for over 15 minutes and even put it in the fridge to thicken which it never did. The top layer of the filling was thick but the more I mixed it around before using it, it wasn't thick. I had to drain alot of the "juice" because it literally was a runny filling. I'll make the cake again but not the icing even though it was very good.

I made this cake for my work partner for her birthday. She LOVED it!! She took it home to her family and they all said it was the best german chocolate cake they had ever eaten. This was the first time I had made a german chocolate cake but it won't be the last. My partner at work and her family have ordered several more from me.

So good that when I made it for a friend's birthday someone stole it! True story! Substituted milk chocolate because the store didn't have any German chocolate. Also frosted the sides with a French Silk frosting.

I used this recipe in a bundt cake to create Choc Ness Monster. What a hit. My husband got some pvc rings (based on inner diameter of bundt ring) from home depot and sliced them in half to support the halves like it was Nessy rising from the deep. I used rice crispy treats to mold a head and tail. In the future frost the treats otherwise they dry out and crumble. Army guys for atmosphere.

I used coffee instead of water, 1.5 times the frosting, toasted the coconut and pecans.

This cake was too dry for my taste - which was a big disappointment after the effort that went into making it!  The icing is very yummy, but wouldn't stick to the sides of the cake very well.  This is the same recipe from the Baker's German Choc. Squares box, just with cake flour.  Upon someone else's review suggestion, I used the icing recipe from that same box, as it's the same as this one, just 1 1/2 times the recipe.  Perfect amount of icing!  I'll make the icing again, but not the cake.

I don't ever bake from scratch, so this was a challenge for me.  The cake came out great, but I screwed something up with the frosting.  I let it sit for 6 hours and it never got firm enough to really spread.  It made the cake moist when it soaked in though.  Overall, I really liked it and most importantly my husband enjoyed his birthday cake.

Yummy and rich! As suggested I added 1oz additional semi-sweet chocolate to the 4oz of German Chocolate to the cake mix and I made 1 1/2 portion of the frosting.  Perfect amount.  Everyone in the office loved it and suggested I become a baker as a second career.  Great recipe!

This was my first time making German chocolate cake and i think this recipe was worth the time.  The cake tasted good but I enjoyed the coconut pecan filling/frosting more.  I doubled the frosting and ended up with leftovers, so next time I will only make half more than required.  I wish that the cake layers rose some more (my own were so evenly flat that I didn't need to level them before layering).  A great recipe otherwise!

First cake I have ever made.  Don't let the list of ingredients scare you; it was even easy for a beginner. Just takes some time, as the good things in life usually do.  My family loved it and said they have never had a cake like it.  My husband and father fought over the leftovers ;)

Followed this recipe exactly except I toasted the pecans and coconut and made 1 1/2 times the frosting like other reviewer recommended. Cake turned out awesome. I made it for a friend's birthday who loves this kind of cake and she loved it, along with all of my coworkers. I will definitely make again.

This cake tasted great.  The cake itself was awesome...moist and good flavor.  It did tend to fall apart a little but other than that GREAT.  I did add 2 extra squares of chocolate but other than that followed the recipe exatly.  Now the frosting......what a disaster.  It tasted great but even after adding a little corn starch and refrigerating it it was too soft.  It worked ok to frost in between the layers but trying to frost the sides was impossible.  I ended up using canned chocolate frosting.  Next time I may try adding less evaporated milk and see if that helps.  I even tried hand molding the frosting to the sides of the cake.

Wow what a perfect German Chocolate Cake! I followed the recipe and it turned out to be the biggest and tastiest cake ever! It takes more time than most but it is so worth it. Be patient with the frosting and it will be the hit at your next celebration!

Although ultimately this cake turned out very well, I was disappointed that the cake was not very chocolately. The frosting matched the color of the cake, which really took away from the presentation of it.  If I made it again, I'd definitely use the entire 4 oz. bar of German Sweet Chocolate, rather than just 1 oz.  Everyone enjoyed it though.

I made this cake for my dad's birthday and it was a huge success. I've never made a German Chocolate cake before, so I was nervous. There are a lot of steps, but it was really easy to make.  A few people commented that the filling didn't thicken.  I tried to be patient and let it simmer at low heat, and after about 10 minutes, it thickened up enough that once I put the coconut and pecans in, it was ready to go.  Some guests also suggested making the 1 and 1/2 the times of the filling, which I didn't do - but it would have just added to the yummy factor! Would highly recommend this!

By following the list of ingredients... I found the cake came out a bit dry. I agree with other posters about adding more squares of German sweet chocolate. Hubby loved the cake!  But would add something like applesauce to make it moist?

This was my first time trying a german chocolate cake recipe.  The cake came out a little crumbly and not as chocolately as I might like; I, too, had a difficult time with the filling/frosting being too runny. Next time I will try the cornstarch as others have suggested.

Sooo delicious!  5 stars for taste, but 4 stars overall because of the filling.  Everyone that ate this cake couldn't stop raving about how great it was!

I made a two-layer cake instead of three but still made the same amount of batter.  It took each pan closer about 30 minutes in the oven.  Definitely wait for the cakes to completely cool before taking them out or else it will fall apart!

Used the suggestion of making cake flour: fill 1 cup with 2 tablespoons cornstarch and then fill the rest of the cup w/ flour (do 2.5 times).

I added cornstarch to the filling, but it still didn't solidify completely.  It was very soupy and kept spilling down the sides of the cake.  I ended up buying some chocolate frosting to frost the sides of the cake to make the presentation look cleaner.  Still so tasty though!  Will definitely make again!

I made this cake for my Dad (Father's Day Present) OH WOW!!!!  I got the best compliment in the world and he doesn't hand them out lightly. He said he had not had German Chocolate Cake that good sense he was in Germany (40 years ago!!!!) In addition, he will usually just eat cake; he at the whole thing in 24 hours. I followed the cake portion exactly as specified with the exception of cutting everything in half and using smaller pans, for a smaller cake. However, I did use the German Chocolate Cake Frosting Recipe- separate recipe on this site. Thanks So Much for this recipe!

It was an okay cake...I'm sure it would have turned out great had I used a better quality chocolate (here I can't find German chocolate), so I used semi-sweet chocolate. I also agree with the other reviewers that the filling was very liquidy. I chose not to add cornstarch, so, I used a strainer to take some of the liquid out and it was fine. Actually, everyone LOVED the filling more than the actual cake (again, prob. because the chocolate used wasn't the best).

This is a fantastic cake.  It was moist and tasty for days after.  I made it for my brother-in-law for his birthday and it was a hit.  I made a chocolate buttercream frosting for the sides, from this site, and it turned out great. Also, I only made 2 layers and made a generous amount of the coconut/pecan mixture and let a healthy portion drip dpwn the sides.  We really enjoyed it and I was so glad that it turned out so well considering I had never made it before.  Thanks!

The cake was wonderful except the frosting didn't thicken.  I cooked and stirred for about 20 minutes and then let it sit for several hours.  it got thick in the fridge, but then I iced the cake with it and it liquified again and puddled around the base.  Tasted fabulous though.  The cake was gone in 5 minutes!!  I would like to know what consistency the icing should be before you take it off the stove.  But that is all.  I wish there was a 4 and a half becuase the taste was so wonderful.  I am trying the recipe again today.

Love this cake! i have baked chocolate cakes but this is the best of all! the texture is moist chocolaty and very tasty! my husband loves walnuts so i used walnut instead of pecans for the topping. i only have one cake pan which is 3x13 so what i did is i just follow the instruction but pour it all in one pan. after it has been baked and cooled,i divided the cake in half to make it a 2 layer cake. then on the topping, yah it has a little problem getting thick so i just added 5 teaspoons full of cornstarch and came out nice and thick. the baking time of the cake takes 30 minutes longer but i think my oven is the problem but it did not overcooked...just right! my husband and big sis loves it... my husband is german and is proud of the cake and the baker! haha looking forward baking this cake again. thanks!

This turned out beautifully.  I baked the cake for 5 min less, and it was not dry at all.  For the filling, I started it on low and then gradually increased the heat to medium until it came to a boil, and   it was quite nicely thickened. I piped the melted semi-sweet chocolate on the top and some down the side, but next time it might be nice to do the sides with chocolate frosting.

Thought this cake was pretty and tasted good.  I also doubled the chocolate for top of cake.  I only gave it 4 stars because I didnt think it was "excellent."  My company liked it and I sent it home with them. Probably would not make again due to how much time it took to make and fat/calories.

After careful review of all the recipes for German Chocolate Cake, I chose this one due to all of the reviews. It was at the request of my boss, for her birthday. The cake is delicious, but it was too moist and after assembling all the layers, it fell completely apart into one big mess. I quickly got out my trifle bowl and made a layer of cake, a layer of cool whip, then another layer of cake, and topped if off with cool whip. This turned out really nice for such a big mess! Not sure why it fell to pieces but I did double the frosting recipe, like suggested by so many others. Taste wise, I give it a thumbs up!

I wish you had more than 5 stars because this recipe was off the charts!  Made this cake for a co-workers birthday and it was a HIT!!  Everyone said it's the moistest cake they'd ever eaten.  It disappeared.  Followed the recipe as written with no problems.  It was worth the extra work!!  Thank you!!!

Based on the lot of good recommendations by fellow reviewer, I: 1) also dusted the cake tins with cocoa (and I was able to fit all the batter quite easily into 2" deep 9" tins, but these are special-order stuff, not supermarket stuff) 2) increased chocolate from 4 to 6 oz. 3)German is a man, and Baker's chocolate isn't very good, so I did 50/50 milk and semi-sweet (elrey's, bulk) 4)made 1.5 recipes of the filling to cover outside, too 5) toasted the coconuts and pecans (do not use pre-sweetened coconut; I didn't, and the filling is SWEET ENOUGH) 6) exercised extraordinary patience in stirring the filling for about 50 minutes. It deepened in color and reduced, but didn't get as thick as I imagined it would.  The nuts and coconut thickened it more, though I had to work to get it to stick to the sides.
Everyone adored it, especially the b-day boy who requested it, but I have to say that while the cake is wonderfully tender, it is too bland and the filling is too sweet for my palate.

Great cake, although I only made 2 layers, and used the extra for cupcakes. I also used extra chocolate like others recommended

Great cake! I only made a couple alterations to the filling: I used 1/2 C. evaporated milk and 1/2 C. condensed milk - and used 1/2 C. brown sugar, 1/2 C. white sugar - AS AND AS A SUGGESTION - Try adding maraschino cherries cut into halves to put ontop of cake before drizzling chocolate over the top!  DELICIOUS!

Oh the cake was delicious, the filling was good as well but I took the advice by adding the pudding and 1 ounce chocolate to it and store it in the fridge to make it solid.  I didn't not like the icing and I think I would try the Frosting for German Chocolate Cake next time.

this cake was amazing!  I slaved over it for hubbie's birthday, and we enjoyed indulging in it together.  I only had 4 oz. german chocolate, so I added 2 oz. semi-sweet chocolate, which was adequate.  I left out a little bit of the milk in the frosting and mine turned out perfect.  Unfortunately, I failed to double the frosting recipe, and as a result I didn't have enough frosting for the sides.

Delicious!  I added 8 ounces of chocolate as recommended by other reviews.  Also, three layers was too much, so I only used two.  Finally, I the frosting was a bit runny, so I think I may have not cooked it long enough.  It was delicious either way, and I agree that it made for a great presentation too!  I will definitely make again!

This cake was AMAZING!  Made it for my sister's birthday at a local bar, and everyone loved it.  And it only got better tasting each day there was any left.  Do not scrimp on the flour....use the bakers flour,not all-purpose.  Also, might want to add a little extra coconut to the topping to make it a little less runny.  Otherwise....incredible!  You will be a hero if you make this for someone.

Excellent cake recipe and frosting.  I doubled the frosting recipe and omitted the chocolate drizzled on top.  I also added 6 oz of german chocolate as recommended by others.  i also added extra coconut to the frosting.  As the recipe stands, there is only enough frosting to top each layer and none for the sides.

I made this cake for my grandfather's 80th birthday...his favorite dessert is german chocolate cake.  While I didn't get much of a review from him, everyone else said that it was wonderful (I didn't have any).  The only complaint is that it was not chocolatey enough. I will be making this again, although I will be doubling all the chocolate, and using dark chocolate rather than the semisweet and german chocolates listed in the recipe.  By the way, I made the recipe using all diabetic-friendly sugar (xylitol) and it still came out wonderfully!

I used this recipe to make my first "made from scratch" cake.  I messed up the recipe a little, but it still came out wonderful.  My husband just loved it and he kept asking me was the icing really made from scratch or did I buy it.

I was very nervous about this cake, but it came out amazing.  It's my father-in-laws favorite.  I didn't have any trouble with dryness at all, but the other reviews were correct.  I worked on the filling for nearly 30 minutes (the whole time the cake was in the oven) and it never did thicken up.  It didn't matter though.  Was amazing.

This is the best recipe for German Chocolate cake I've ever had. I made the topping first so it could cool while making the cake. It was an absolute hit as a "Birthday Cake" for a very fussy man. I will definately keep it and make it again. Thanks so much for sharing it.

Very good recipe, I will make it again.  Next time I will halve it because our family of four didn't finish half of it, but for a party it is a good size.  I substituted 1 cup half and half plus 2 Tbs. lemon juice for the buttermilk because I didn't have any on hand, it turned out great.  Thanks!

This is a delicious, spectacular cake.  Like most of the best homemade cakes, it does take a long time to make.  I doubled the filling, and even though frosting is my favorite part of any cake, I think it was a little too much.  Next time I'm going to try 1 1/2x the filling.  I will also try thickening the  filling over a higher heat, stirring constantly of course.  It took me almost an hour on low heat.

Awesome tasting cake!  I made this for my husband's birthday.  Took me about 4 hours total.  The cake was so so moist, the filling...well it was runny.  I think using condensed milk would make it thicker.  I also melted 4 ounces of chocolate rather than what the recipe called for because I wanted to make the cake more attractive looking so I covered the top of the cake with chocolate as well as drizzled it along the sides.  This really helped and everyone LOVED it!  I will definitely make this again only I'll use condensed instead of evaporated milk for the filling.

Absolutely delicious.  The cake is very light and full of flavor while the topping was very goey and tasty.   I used dark chocolate ganach instead of the chocolate on this recipe.  The only problem I had was removing clean from pan.

This was a REALLY GOOD cake! I could not find cake flour, so I used regular, and I doubled the filling so I could get a thick layer on top. This cake is so good I've started making it for everybody's birthday just so I can get some too :)

I am so glad that I took the time to read the reviews and try your cake. I followed suggestions about doubling the filling ingredients and I must say that my cake turned out great!!! You must stay at the stove approx: 30-35 min stirring but it works so much better if you follow the 
receipe and do not take any short cuts. It is Thanksgiving Day 2004 and I have have my dad downstairs who is raving about this cake.(he always say I can not bake) but I proved I can follow instructions. Mrs. Dean you helped my first Thanksgiving dessert become a success. Thanks alot.

This cake is top notch...It lasted all of 10 minutes...I only have one suggestion...You should make a double batch of icing...

I agree with the description of spectacular!! It does take a little extra time, but seems like it is worth the effort! Adding the egg whites separately gives the cake a loft and airy-ness, while still keeping it moist. I do recommend this! After reading the reviews on it, I did make double the amount of filling/frosting though.  I also toasted the pecans - wow!  Make SURE to let the frosting cool quite a bit, or it will slide right off! I made that mistake! (again!) And - I didn't drizzle. Would be nice for a special event though!

This is now my most requested cake for birthdays. I had one co-worker's husband claim it was the best cake he'd ever eaten- and offered to pay me to make one just for him!

I don't like Coconut, but I made this cake and took it to work for people to try and they LOVEED it.  I now have 5 people asking that I make them one for Thanksgiving.  This weekend I made mini versions of the cake using small loaf pans they were a big hit for football tailgating.

Extaordinary!  Very Moist.  Everyone raved. This will be my new German Chocolate Recipe.  The drizzled chocolate adds a little extra and makes it look as good as it tastes.  I followed the suggestion of previous reviews and I doubled the frosting.  I will probably make a chocolate ganache for the sides next time.  Thanks for sharing your delicious recipe.

Made this cake by request for my husband's big 4-0. Made 1.5 the frosting recipe & 4 X the chocolate "drizzle".  Although it didn't "look like his mom's g-choc cake", he loved it.  Only drawback is that I can't seem to make this cake, or any g-choc cake, pretty.  The choc drizzle helped, with a design on top.

I agreed with the others and doubled the filling/frosting.  This cake not only looked good, tasted delicious.  I put the semi-sweet chocolate in a small ziplock bag, cut the tip and made a nice criss cross pattern on top, followed by a circle outline just on the top.  Looked great too!

Hmm.. yumm... I made the cake for my husband who loves chocolate cake. He loved it. The cake was very moist and soft. I was a bit apprehensive about the filling so i used a different recipe for the filling(homemade whipped cream), and topped it with a chocolate ganauche. Excellent. Definitely a keeper.

the cake is absolutely wonderful. moist, delicious, and easy to make with the recipe. the frosting was horrible and almost ruined the cake. it would not solidify. it had a good flavor, but would not spread at all after an hour's worth of effort. i would definitely make the cake again, but get a new recipe for the frosting!

I made this for a friend's birthday, and she absolutely loved it.  I did have to make some alterations since I didn't have all the ingredients.  I soured some milk with vinegar instead of using buttermilk, and I used all-purpose flour in lieu of the cake flour.  All in all, it was still a very moist cake and very tasty.

Without a doubt the best German Chocolate cake I have ever made.  However, not as "chocolately" as I expected, and will probably double the amount of chocolate (2 oz) I use next time.

Made this for my dad for his birthday.  It was terrific!  Everyone said it was the most moist chocolate cake ever!  I messed up on the frosting (didn't tell anyone I did), everyone still loved it.

I made this cake and I almost had to take it away from my grown daughter!!  I am on the Atkins Diet(but I do a lot of catering) so I naturally had to have someone taste test for me.  I made a small sampler loaf, let her try it and she loved it.  This cake almost didn't make it to the person who ordered it!  Of course, I'll have to make one for Thanksgiving dinner.

I am not usually a big fan of german chocolate cake because I don't like coconut.  However, I made this cake for my family and they loved it.  It was all gone in two days.  I used less coconut and more pecans to suit my taste better. I enjoyed a piece myself.  This will be my german chocolate cake recipe from now on.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Professionally MOIST!  Heirloom recipe.  I thought that the spread would get thicker but discovered that it was fine and soaked in a little.  I accidentally dropped an extra tablespoon of vanilla into the spread and it was still yummy (phew).  I tripled the chocolate and shortning at the end to get all the way around the cake.  I pre-measured out all the ingredients and it went fast and was fun even with 4 little interrupters.  I JUST NEED A WHITE CAKE THIS MOIST.

It was OK.  The flavor was good, I guess I wanted the cake itself to be more moist.
