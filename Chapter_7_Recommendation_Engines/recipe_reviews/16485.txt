This recipe was so easy and very good. I did change a couple things though. I used creamy poppy seed dressing (for the "creamy dressing"),honey roasted sunflower seeds,added raisens, and only used broccoli.  It turned out great!

This salad is very popular with my family.  I use bacon bits instead of frying bacon.  It's much easier and still good.  I use low fat mayo for the creamy salad dressing and follow the rest of the recipe to a tee.

I used frozen flowerettes, blanched slightly and rinsed in cold water. I was a little confused as to what exactly was creamy dressing (ranch, mayonnaise, etc.) so I ended up using cole slaw dressing. It went with us to a church pot luck and I saw lots of people head back for seconds. There were no leftovers! The sunflower seed and bacon really round it out.

This was a perfect way to get everyone to eat fresh cauliflower and broccoli.  I used 1/2 cup "light" salad dressing instead of 1 cup and eliminated bacon bits entirely for a healthier version.

This was a nice change of pace for using broccoli and cauliflower.  I halved the recipe and used a minced yellow sweet onion.  For the creamy dressing I used the Creamy Italian Dressing I recipe from this site.  I let this site over night before eating.  Tasted very good.  Next time I will put the seeds in right before serving.

Mmmmmm!  This recipe makes a lot of salad.  Even so, I took it to a pot luck and didn't come home with any leftovers.  I had run out of Miracle Whip, which I had intended to use, so I used Hellman's instead.  It was delicious, and I will go ahead and use Hellman's the next time I make this, which will be soon!

This was such a party pleaser.  I did substitute toasted pecan pieces for the sunflower seeds and rice wine vinegar for the white wine vinegar.  I used bottled coleslaw dressing for the creamy dressing.  What a hit!

Loved the salad!  A lot of people don't think they like Cauliflower, so this is a great way to showcase it and show them how delicious it can be.  The only thing I added was a handful of raisins.

Delicious!  I chopped everything in the food processor, even the bacon.  I had to substitute rice vinegar for the wine vinegar since I didn't have any and it was still delicious.  I used Marzetti's Original Slaw dressing.  Will be making this again! ETA-Don't omit the bacon!  Even though it's tempting to do so to make it healthier, the bacon adds a great flavor.  I did cut it by half and made the bits really small and it was still really good.  And add about a cup of golden raisins.  YUM!  This is my new favorite salad!

I made this exact only leaving out the sugar and adding some fresh ground pepper. Next time, I think I'd use half mayo/half sour cream and add in some fresh minced garlic. Other than that, it was good.

My wife always makess this salad when there will be ladies attending.   They says it fills you up not out. She omits the sugar & vinegar.  Makes her dressing of Miricle Whip Light & milk.  Or uses a ranch style dressing.   She will make it the night before sometimes.  Great as a leftover.   She serves at Christmas adding red pepper to round out the holiday colors.

Tried and true, sure to please!  I recommend adding 1/2 cup craisens (great sweetness) and for the "creamy salad dressing" my favorite mix is 1/2 cup Hellman's Mayo & 1/2 cup Miracle Whip.  MAJOR crowd pleaser!

The first time I ever ate this salad was several years ago at a bridal shower luncheon; the salad was made by the bride-to-be.  It was wonderful!

I made it a few weeks ago making only a few changes.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar, used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, eliminated the sunflower seeds and used coarsely chopped pecans.

Great recipe and very versatile!

I can't imagine a broccoli salad without caulilflower.  Not only a pretty presentation with the varied colors, but such a wonderful comibination.  The flavors excel in the mayonaise-based dressing.  I've made this recipe--just as it is--for many years and still have requests for it.

Husband kept saying how much he loved this recipe.  The 5 stars is based on how the recipe is written, but I now make it with about 1/8 cup of honey instead of sugar and a creamy cucumber vinaigrette dressing to cut the sugar and some of the fat.  Nobody notices the difference.

This is so good and is easy in that it tastes even better if made a day ahead.  I used very large heads of cauliflower and broccoli, and substituted craisins for the seeds. Made 50% more of the mayo dressing, so it was nice and creamy, and left everything else the same. Don't leave out the bacon; it makes the salad.  I brought it to a party and had two of the 6 women give me their email addresses so they could get the recipe.  It was the only dish brought to the gathering that was completely devoured.  Highly recommend.

This made a lot of salad. I used one head of cauliflower and a head of broccoli, like the recipe, but it made a lot more than I expected. I needed to chop them up more than I did. I also had to make a half a cup more of salad dressing. I used ranch to make the dressing. So, all in all, it tasted delicious, but be ready for a lot of salad and chop it up smaller and make more dressing. But, its good stuff!

A really good low calorie option especially if you use Greek yogurt and low fat sour cream.  My taste requires a little more flavor though.  Great recipe overall though!

This is a family favorite.  The only change I make is to add our favorite blend of shredded cheese - about 1 cup or so.  It is sooo good!

Fantastic recipe...easy and had all the ingredients on hand.  What a wonderful way to serve veggies, even the kids had seconds of this one! This will be a real keeper especially for 'pot luck' parties.  I did use bacon bits rather than real bacon and it worked out just fine - sunflower seeds gave it a 'nutty' flavor that impressed everyone.  Thanks for sharing.

Good.  I used Trader Joe's Poppy Seed dressing - sparingly.  And also added some feta cheese.

I was looking for a similar recipe that our local deli makes, so I made substitutions: I did not have sweet onion, so I substituted radishes.

This is a great mix of flavors.  I did make a few changes. I used 2 heads of broccoli to 1 head of cauliflower, also added cubed cheddar cheese. I didn't have ranch dressing, so I used 1/4 cup miracle whip + 3 Tbs sugar and fresh herbs.

I used 3 C each of broccoli and cauliflower, only 1/2 C seeds and then used 1/2 Mayo w/Olive Oil and 2 packs of Splenda mixed with 1 T balsamic vinegar.  For the bacon I used 4 T real bacon bits.  It was an awesome recipe....Thanks!

I could not stop eating this dish, I loved it so much!  This is a great base recipe because you can tailor it to your tastes and it will come out wonderful every time!  

I didn't have all the exact ingredients, so I made some substitutions and I also added some ingredients.  I made a cole-slaw dressing instead (light mayo, milk, sugar, red wine vinegar); I only had dried, chopped onions and onion powder; the bacon I had was "maple" flavored which added a great richness and sweetness to the flavor; I added honey-roasted almond slices and plumped raisins (just soak them in super hot tap water for 3-5 mins); also, I only had the frozen broccoli and cauliflower, so I steamed them first to get them soft, then chilled the whole dish. Lastly, we were curious about how the dish would taste warm so we heated up the last couple bites and it was even better! I'm making it hot next time, I can't wait!

This is my favorite 'Broccoli Salad' recipe; however, I omit the cauliflower, use a package of precooked bacon pieces and add about a 3/4 cup craisins... you have to try it with the craisins, the sweet/tart is so good with the rest of the ingredients (I use a different one for broccoli-cauliflower that has cheese in it as well.)

I took this to our family Thanksgiving dinner and it was a HUGE success with the adults.  I did make some changes.  I added a handful of golden raisins, a handful of sliced grapes, I used Lite Miracle Whip, and used turkey bacon. I made this a day early to let the flavors combine.  I WILL make this again, but might try it without the bacon.

My mom's been making this salad for years but she never put bacon in it... I like it!  I had to sub pistachio pieces for the sunflower nuts (it's what I had on hand. My mom does add 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire Sauce to the dressing.  Just a bit of zip!  Yummy!

I used a creamy caesar and precooked bacon to speed the preparation process. It was delicious, I will definately make again.  This is a great hot weather salad, it's fresh taste and crunch really satisfies.

I've made this several times and love it. There are never any leftovers. You can use almonds instead of sunflower seeds and I ALWAYS add seedless red grapes. Sounds odd, but it really makes it taste special. Great recipe!

I was able to greatly reduce the fat and calories by substituting an equal amount of Lite Creamy Parmesan dressing for the "creamy dressing", omitting the sunflower seeds, and using jarred Real Bacon pieces for the bacon.

It was very good.  I used three heads of broccoli because they were small.  I used Miracle Whip for the dressing and instead of bacon I used Baco's, because it was for a potluck and some of the guests were vegetarian.

I definitely liked the dish as did everyone else at Thanksgiving.  It was a nice cold dish to go along with the rest of the feast.  I did make a few changes.  I'm not a big fan of raw onions or sunflower seeds, so I left those out.  The mayonnaise taste was a little overpowering as well, so I added much more vinegar than the recipe called for.  It turned out great!

I always use this recipe.  It's a great summer salad.  I recently made it for our branding and everyone loved it!  This time I added a little bit of horseradish to the dressing and chopped up some green onion and red pepper that were just hanging out in my fridge.  I used balsamic vinegar as I didn't have any white on hand.  The color is different but the flavor was great! Usually I don't change a thing with this recipe.  It's tasty the way it is.

Excellent salad! I omitted the sunflower seed because I did not have them on hand. I took another reviewers suggestion and sprinkled in curry powder for some amazing flavor kick! I also put in a dash of garlic salt and black pepper to counter the sweet dressing. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe was very surprising to me! I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of using sweet yellow onion instead of red) and liked it a lot, but will probably make a couple of  changes next time. I felt the onion was a little overpowering (possibly due to me using a yellow onion) and will cut back a little. I will also probably blanch the vegetables very briefly, and cut back on the dressing a bit (I tasted the dressing more than the actual vegetables.)

Excellent Recipe. My husband loved it. I added more broccoli than cauliflower, just because of personal preference, I used the olive oil mayo for my dressing. Will make again!!

I followed suggestions from previous reveiws by making just half of the dressing, using Miracle Whip as the creamy dressing. Followed to a tee otherwise and this was a sure crowd pleaser.

This is a very good salad! It's really the only time I eat cauliflower. I use mayonnaise instead of the salad dressing. I've also had this with cubes of cheddar tossed in, which is pretty good too, but not necessary.

This will be the ONLY Broc-Cauli salad I ever make again.  I used light Mayo as the creamy dressing (don't use regular mayo, it has too many calories.  I think the light tastes better in this salad) and bacon bits instead of frying my own.  I kept the vegs and dressing seperate until just before serving.  I also used a little bit of salad toppings on it too.  Definitely a keeper.

I love this recipe. I too add raisins and have added diced apples before. I usually make a huge batch and 1/2 is gone before I take it to the event. I hate broccoli any other way!

I didn't think it was terrible, but my husband wouldn't even eat more than a bite.  The dressing was too sweet and that's after I halved the sugar.

exactly what I make except I haven't tried it with sunflower seeds (might have to try that). The dressing I make is ½ cup mayo,
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar,
1 teaspoon sugar & put the cheese in as you serve it so if you have left-overs the cheese doesn't get slimy.

Delicious! Other similar recipes add shredded cheese and I had a block of blue cheese marble that I shredded and added about 3/4 cup. Nice complement to the bacon.

I switched the sugar with stevia but it was a little too sweet, so next time I'll cut that amount in half. 

I roasted some slivered almonds and used those instead of sunflower nuts.  Same effect as sunflower nuts, just as good.

This was delicious.  It makes a very large quantity, which was great, because everyone loved it and I had no leftovers.  As suggested in a few comments, I made it the night before, reserving the seeds and bacon until just before serving.  I will be making it often.

DELICIOUS. To make this Keto friendly for our HFLC (high fat low carb) eating habits,  we omitted the sugar in the dressing...didn't miss it a bit! 
Awesome textures with the crunchy veggies and bacon and then the egg and cheese round out the dish perfectly! Could take as a meal on its own for lunch.
Adding this to our salad repertoire :)

5 stars for this recipe.  We served it to 40 people today in our Sr Ctr cafeteria and got raves all round. It's really easy.  I didn't use sunflower seeds, we used slivered almonds instead and dried cranberries.  Used purchased cooked, chopped bacon, and the salad dressing is so easy - basically using what's in the fridge. I liked it so much I'm making it for a potluck next weekend.  Thanks, Tom, for posting Barb's Broccoli and Cauliflower Salad

First, I THOUGHT I had bacon, but I didn't.  So, there's that.  Second, I had  HUGE red onion and half of that was way more than necessary, so I eyeballed what I mixed in with the broccoli and cauliflower.  This was just fabulous.  I plan on snacking on it all week and serving it to my husband with his marinated chicken thigh dinner tomorrow night (and take-to-work-lunch tomorrow).  I will try it with the bacon another time, as it would lend a different texture and level of flavor.  But, in my opinion, as a vegetarian dish, it needs nothing.

This salad was so delicious!!  I made it for a party and everyone loved it!  As others suggested I used poppy seed dressing for the "creamy dressing" and pecans instead of sunflower seeds as the recipe suggested.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent! Except that I used store bought bacon bits which I won't do again, this was a spectacular side salad for grilled pork chops. Or chicken.  Will be repeating this one several times over the summer.

Made it as written the first time.  Excellent.
Made it the second time using a broccoli slaw mixture in a bag.  Excellent.
Made it the third time using the a kale slaw mixture in a bag, added dried cranberries and pumpkin seeds.  Amazing.

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I chose to differently was to use apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar because we love apple cider vinegar and I added some dried cranberries!

I was a little hesitant to try this recipe since it was last minute and for a party, but it turned out amazing and I had several compliments on how delicious it was! I am an amateur cook and have never  made anything like this. It was so easy to make, and didn't take very long at all. I wasn't sure what kind of creamy dressing, so I used poppy-seed dressing like someone else said they did.  I also used pecans instead of sunflower seeds. The result was amazing and I absolutely loved it! I will definitely make this again!

My boyfriend absolutely loved it..in fact he had me make it twice in one week!!! 

I did add a little more of the dressing mix than it called for because I think I had some really large heads of broccoli and cauliflower.. (and added some diced cheddar)  but yuuuuuuuumy!

I liked this recipe. It is the start of a good recipe. I think other items can be added to it but I generally like the dressing. I used golden raisins and candy coated pecan pieces. I also made a little more dressing than called for. I have used Craisins in the past, also dried cherries. Just about anything works. Cheese is good too and I have even had grapes in this salad.

This was very good, but I did have to make a batch and a half of dressing to coat everything nicely. I added a few raisins,  1  1/2c of sharp shredded cheddar, and 6 hard boiled eggs to mine as well.  I didn't have white wine vinegar, so I just used cider vinegar instead. Everybody loved it. It's even better the next day.

I added red oinion this time and my personal preference is without. The onion is very overbearing and takes away the flavor of the dressing and veggies. I think the bacon bits are what is key in this dish!

I found purple and yellow cauliflower at the farmers market so I used 8 oz. each of purple, yellow, and white cauliflower and 8 oz. broccoli. I didn't have any bacon though, next time I will use it. Colorful and delicious!

For my creamy dressing I used Kraft lowfat creamy ceasar. For those that said this was to much dressing for the dish need to keep in mind the size head of your broccoli and Cauliflower. If they seem smaller than the rest of the pile at the store ..make a little less of the dressing...if they seem larger than the average in the pile...make a little more. Just use common sense and modify if necessary.  I used less vinegar than the recipe calls for because i know my creamy dressing had plenty in it already and didn't want it to be to over powering. So I used about 3/4T. I used  maybe 4 pieces of Turkey Bacon (baked till crispy in the oven prior). My husband loved it!

delicious. dressing amount is perfect if following the recipe correctly, I cut the veggies into bite size pieces as opposed to bigger pieces or putting them them through the ninja. I bet it makes a difference in how it incorporates with the dressing. I made sure to add equal amounts of broccoli and cauliflower. probably around 4 cups of each, give or take a little. used white instead of red onion, added a handful of Sargento shredded cheddar and went with it. awesome stuff and I think I'm going to throw in a small handful of dried cranberries or raisins.

Love this recipe. My sister in CA has a variation that I love too.  Instead of bacon she adds 1 cup of raisins, sliced scallions instead of onions. Her dressing is 3/4 c  mayonnaise, 1/3 c apple cider vinegar, 1 T sugar, 1/2 tsp each salt and pepper. Whisk and mix with salad. Trust me on the raisins!

So good! I used a few packages of stevia in place of sugar and used regular mayo in place of salad dressing. Will be making this one again for sure.

Love this recipe.  The only way there could've been too much dressing is if your head of broccoli and cauliflower were too small.  I had to use 1 1/4 head of cauliflower.  I used pecans but if you think anyone may have a nut allergy, you should use sunflower seeds.

This is such a great recipe to take to the picnic, potluck etc.  the key for our family is take your time to cut broccoli and culiflower to the bite sizes.  Looks better and easier to eat. You can certainly add golden raisins to this recipe.  It's yummy!!!

A perfect July 4 salad for the cookout! I subbed regular white vinegar merely as a personal preference.

Similar to a salad my Gamgam used to make. This salad is delicious. The second time around I mixed it up a bit, I used non fat Greek yogurt as the 'creamy dressing'. I didn't have cheese (whoops) so I threw in a handful of dried cranberries!!! I am not gonna lie, my 2 and 10 year old love it every time

Easy and delicious. I made this on Mother's Day and everyone loved it, even the kids & our dog. I used Miracle Whip for the creamy salad dressing, but I think I will try a creamy ranch next time.

I thought it was super good, and so did my guests. My 4-year old daughter likes her veggies unadorned, and wasn't a fan. I made it just as written.

We really liked this. Used reg. Mayo for Creamy Dressing and it reminded me of the Broccoli Salad my grandmother made. Served the Sunflower Seeds on the side to they wouldn't get soggy. Hubby thinks we should try Ranch next time. Thanks for sharing.

Very easy and delicious.  I didn't change anything and used light ranch salad dressing.  I brought this salad to a potluck and it went quickly.  I'll definitely make this again.

My uncle used to make something similar to this every Thanksgiving and it was always a hit and gone with in minutes. I omit the bacon, red onion, and sunflower seeds (his recipe didn't have them) and add bit sized chunks of cheddar cheese,after that its tastes exactly the same!

I thought this was a really great salad. I used poppy seed dressing per another reviewers suggestion, and added raisens and cheese. My only complaint was it didn't need a whole cup of dressing, more like 2/3 cup. Yum!

Good, but I would have preferred it without the broccoli. I used Marzetti Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing, and substituted halved cashews for the sunflower seeds. Not bad at all. Thanks!
