This recipe is indeed an old itilian recipe. MY mother in law is from Italy and  I have made one very similar for many years.  I will try this one for this Easter.  This kind of cheese pie is very different from a regular cheam cheese pie, I  think you have to  either hate it or love it.  We love it. We have it for Easter as a tradition .  It does have an eggy taste but thats what it is supposed to have.  Try it you will like it.

I made this recipe last Easter and was so happy to find it again on this web site (after misplacing it) that I signed up. I did not find it "eggy" at all. It came out just like the ricotta pies we had at Easter when I was a kid, delicious!

This recipe requires 16 eggs, 12 of which are in the filling....unfortunately, it tastes very "eggy" and was unappealing.  Otherwise, the pies look good and are somewhat tasty.

Based on the reviews of other, I cut back on the eggs and only used 10. I also added 4 pounds of ricotta instead of 3. This made the pies less custard like but they were too sweet. Otherwise, a very good recipe. Next time I will also cut back on the sugar.

Absolutely delicious. Probably the best pie I've ever had. I did cheat and use premade crust. Next I plan to try it with a little crushed pineapple.

This was absolutely delightful!  The flavor of this reminds me a lot of English custard, as well as in texture to a small degree.   My boyfriend and I made it for a dinner party with some of our friends and it was enjoyed ( and eaten right up) by everyone. The one downfall is the amount it makes.  We made one 9 inch and one 7 inch pie and still have enough mix to make probably two or possibly three more 9 inch pies.  So if your not looking to make pies for the masses, I would suggest halving it!!

I really liked this recipe.  My first time making pie crust from scratch.  Definitely chill the dough for an hour prior to rolling it out or it will be hard to work with.  The second time I made this I halved the recipe so that I didn't come out with three pies!  I added lemon zest along with the chocolate chips to the filling.  I think it's easier to use a cookie cutter to make cut outs for the top of the pie rather than the strips.  It is a must to chill the pie for a few hours before cutting it, or else it will fall apart. The recipe is also missing an essential finishing touch: Powdered sugar on top.  A big hit with my Italian in-laws for Christmas.

I only made half the recipe since it made so much! My husband loved it! I used splenda in place of the sugar and used pre-made pie crust. I also used the sugar free chocolate chips and chopped them up into smaller pieces before adding.

Crust was problematic. Here's how I solved it: it was difficult to stir in the egg mixture with the flour. So I used my hands to combine, then kneaded it lightly on the counter. After chilling as indicated, I couldn't roll it out, so I treated it like a pat-in-the-pan dough. I put the ball in the middle of the pie pan and slowly pressed it into place. It tasted good and worked fine. For those who end up with extra filling - you are probably not using a traditional Pyrex deep dish pan. The filling is perfect for 2 pies. However, the crust on top is not necessary and not even desirable. Cut the dough recipe in half and be done with it. I did have to raise temp to 350 degrees (my oven runs slightly cold) and baked for an extra 20 minutes. You can test like a cheesecake: insert a slender knife midway between edge and center. If it come out clean, it's done.

An interesting dish.  I made it for Easter.  It made far too much filling, it filled 2 deep dish pies and one regular.  Worth a try if you've never tried it before, but my family and I personally didn't care too much for it.  It tasted sort of like a custard pie.

This pie was excellent!  Now, I am a fanatical chocolate lover and think that chocolate is wonderful on anything.  However, both my boyfriend and I agreed that this recipe might be better WITHOUT the chocolate...however, it was still delicious.  I had a bit of difficulty with the crust.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I had a terrible time rolling it and getting it into the pan without it cracking and breaking...it just seemed dry when I was trying to roll it out.  But the taste of the crust was wonderful and different than pre-made crust, so I wouldn't substitute it.   It's actually sweeter than premade crust.

Amazing pie!  I love the soft sweet flavor until you bite into a chocolate chip.  Delicious!  All that I can recommend is not to make it as a deep dish pie because it take too long to cook and the crust either gets too stiff or it burns.

I made only the filling did not use any crust, used 5 extra large  eggs, 2/3 cup turbinado sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla, the zest of one medium orange, 1 and 1/2 lbs of low fat ricotta, and 1/2 cup of chocolate mini chips (ghirardelli). Poured into a large glass pie plate coated with coconut oil. Baked 1 hr at 325. My wife loved it!  (me too!). The original recipe is also delicious. Made again added zest of a lemon, even better!

This was absolutely amazing!! I did a test run this week since I am planning on making it for Thanksgiving. I bought really good ricotta from an Italian specialty store which makes a big difference. I did not add chocolate chips and added a little bit of orange zest instead of lemon since lemon can be overpowering..so so good!! Can't wait for my family to try it! Please note I did not use this crust recipe. I cheated and used graham cracker crust and it was still wonderful.

After having Italian friends and family from New York try this recipe and others, this recipe comes closest to what they are used to having. The strips along the top, or a top crust, is not authentic, at least not to the people I have asked, so they prefer the pie without it.

Great recipe -- loved the sweet taste, not as sweet as I thought.  The only problem was there was enough ingredients for 4 pies.. Next time I will cut in 1/2  (or pay attention to the number of Servings - lol)

This recipe is perfect just as it is - everyone raved about it.  I have had many variations of this, but by far this is the best. It does make a lot so you definitely have to use deep-dish pie pans or you will have too much.  It is very filling, so next time I may cut this in half.

Almost like my grandmother's.   Closest recipe I have ever found.  Just a few modifications:  the dough could be one large ball and one smaller.  I used a deep dish plate and needed slightly more dough.  The top doesn't need as much.  I also added 2 pounds of ricotta and then followed the same measurements ( I made a half recipe).  Baking time was nearly 40 minutes more but came out fantastic.  A real keeper!

Amazing, delicious, easy to make. I'd give it 10 stars if I could! The tip to getting the crust to stay in one piece is to FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. You must let it chill in the fridge. I had no trouble at all with the crust, and the homemade flavor really made the pie that much better. I cooked mine in a springform pan so it took a LOT longer (I think it cooked for about 2 hours, I kept checking on it and it wouldn't set right away) but it was well worth the time; it's got an amazing flavor. Served it to 2nd generation Italian guys, they couldn't stop raving about it. I'm not a professional cook/baker, but you'd never know it by the way this turned out!

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe. I've grown up with ricotta pie and now live far away from my hometown Italian bakeries, so I needed a recipe to make one myself. I'm guessing that recipes for ricotta pie vary from region to region in Italy, because this is not really similar to what I've grown up eating. 

I halved the recipe and the amounts ended up being fine for a spring-form pan. As others have noted, the dough was extremely dry and crumbly despite chilling. However, I fixed this easily by adding a bit more water to it and it was fine. I'd say that the taste of the crust is the best part of the recipe. 

I was surprised about the idea of having dough on top- I've never seen that before. Since I made this for Christmas, I played along with the idea and put some Christmas cookie shapes on top and it did look nice, although unusual in my experience.

The filling itself tastes extremely eggy, enough so that I won't make this recipe again. It's too much like a flan- too different from what I know to be ricotta pie. I realize in hindsight I really should have added the lemon zest- maybe that would have taken the edge off of the eggy flavor. 

I'm giving this 3 stars instead of 2 because I feel it's fair to cut the author some slack- maybe it tastes how it is supposed to for people from a certain area of Italy, but not where my family is from.

I followed the recipe exactly to make this for an Italian themed food club dinner and dessert. This pie was very good, but got better over the next few days in the fridge, in my opinion. My husband said it reminded him of a bread pudding.  Oh, and this was my first ever pie crust to make and it turned out great!!

Made this pie for a New Years Eve party, left out chocolate and added the lemon zest.  Was outstanding and it made just exactly two deep dish pies as recipe says. Thanks for the suggestion of leaving pie dough in fridg for an hour does work better.  Thanks for the recipe

I will make it again and again.  However I had to make two modifications and WILL make 2 others.  Dough was unworkable until I added a little water.  Had to bake 10 minutes longer for knife to come out clean, pie was so deep.  Next time I will bake in a shallow tarte pan and bake at lower temp, 350.  The flavor is terrific!  I added the lemon zest.

I've made this a few times in the past few years, and it's pretty close to what co-worker's family has made for 50 years.  I've added mini chocolate chips, and some Amaretta and it's great!

This recipe is almost perfect.  My Grandmother used to make this at Easter time.  Its a delicious treat, but a very small piece goes a long way.  Would I make it again?  Of course I would...my Grandmother's recipe is lost to us, so this one will make up for that loss and bring smiles to my family as they enjoy this springtime treat!

You guys, this is a 24 serving recipe.  This means it is for 2 pies.  For the reviews saying it's 'too eggy' and 'use less egss', it is because you used double the eggs!  Cut this in half if you're just making one pie  :)   I 'm going to try it with some strawberries instead of chocolate chips!

Great recipe!  I did the lemon zest instead of the chocolate chips and I would definitely do that again.  The only problem I had was it took a lot longer to cook than in the directions.  I think next time I will try putting foil over the whole pie and cooking for at least 30 min and then taking it off.  I'm hoping that will also help with the crust not being too dry.

I read reviews about this filling be much more than needed so I halved the recipe. I also didn't want to make my own crust so I bought a pre-baked 6oz graham cracker crust. Even with halving it I still had way too much filling. I only need 1/4 of this recipe for 1 pie. I topped it with caramel sauce and sea salt and it was delicious! I might look for caramel chips to put inside it next time.

My family said it was acceptable, so I saw the specter of my Grandma put down her rolling pin and go towards the light. I omitted the crust and added orange and lemon zest with a bit of the juice. I also made a small amount of rice  with cinnamon and vanilla and then dusted the top with cinnamon for the authentic experience. I also cooked it in a deep lasagna pan like Grandma did. It was freaking delicious.

The recipe made 2 deep dish pies, I didn’t use cover crust. I made one with chocolate chips and one without.
I thought this was a delicious desert as did my co workers. Nice and very rich, very much like custard I did have to increase cooking time by about 20 minutes. I’ll make it again.

I am a lover of Ricotta pie, but this one has way too many eggs and way to much sugar.  It did taste "eggy". Perhaps if I have used lemon rind and lemon juice it would have helped masking the eggy taste.

It was good. Worth making it. Half the recipe makes two regular pies without the top crust. I liked the chocolate chips in there, so I will probably put a fourth cup in next time. powdered sugar on top is also good.

I like this recipe. I agree that it is "eggy," but I like eggs. One thing I did was to add lemon AND vanilla, and sprinkled Special Dark chocolate chips liberally on the top rather than mixing them in.

I also made the crust, but I just used it as a bottom, pressed into a springform pan like a cheesecake. I used the entire amount of batter in the pan (it's a large one!), and it took about an hour or so to bake.

After a day in the refrigerator, the flavor is yummy, the texture as a ricotta pie should be, and the only negative I see is that it is a little too wet, even though I drained the ricotta.

Otherwise, it's a hit! I would make it again.

Found this same exact recipe by the Cake Boss (http://www.rachaelrayshow.com/recipe/14377_The_Cake_Boss_Ricotta_Pie/).  Not sure which one stole it from the other but I don't care, it's delicious either way!

My crust would not stay together. Just crumbled.  Resorted to frozen crust as I was pressed for time. Was looking forward to the sweet crust! Otherwise the filling was great.
