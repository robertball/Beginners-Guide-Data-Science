I cheated by using cake mix and it turned out great. Prepare 1 pkg. of yellow or butter recipe cake mix by using 4 eggs, 2/3 cup water, 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1/2 softened butter or margarine and add the chopped candy bars. Then follow the rest of the recipe. Apologies to the submitter, but I think this variation is just as good and a lot less time-consuming to make!

Extraordinarily good with the only downfall being the length of time it takes to make.  I suggest playing around with the recipe.  I actually made an almond joy cake instead substituting almond joys and almond butter for baby ruths and peanut butter.  It was fantastic.  I omitted the whipped cream for whipped chocolate frosting, which might be too sweet for some, but it was fine by me.  Overall, a good (even if tedious) recipe.

Though the end result of this recipe is a very deicious desert, I can't say that it's really worth the time and effort it takes to make it. There are probably recipes out there that are just as scrumptious but take a lot less work.

Took some time-- but worth it...
I would not ice the outside with whipped cream againg.  When refrigerated the filling and topping get too hard needs to be room temperature-- but you can't do it with the whip cream.

Great cake.  To really reflect a Baby Ruth candy bar it should have a chocolate filling/topping!  Leave out the coconut and put in chocolate chips!  leavint the whipped topping off until serving.  Angie

Just buy a German chocolate cake mix and top it with the the frosting from this recipe.  It is perfect, and a lot less effort!

DELICIOUS!!!  It took me almost all day to make this cake for a family get-together but it was worth it.  I won't put the whipped cream on the cake if I make it again I'll just put some on each slice when it's served.
