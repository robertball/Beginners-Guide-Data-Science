I liked this recipe because it was easy to throw together and had a good flavor. We like a more hearty soup, so we upped the ground beef to a pound and added a can of whole kernel corn. Also added an entire packet of mild taco seasoning. We'd definitely make this one again. It's great with crushed tortilla chips and melted Monterrey/Cheddar on top. A great recipe that you can customize to your own taste. We added some fresh cilantro as another review recommended - definitely will do that again.

This recipe got !Two Thumbs Up! from my entire family. I did make some modifications so I am not sure that it is fair to rate it. I used 93/7 ground turkey by Honeysuckle White 1lb, half an onion about 1/2c, a can of diced tomatoes, can of pinto beans, Taco Seasoning I (recipe from this site) instead of the package seasoning, a 4oz. can of chopped green chilies, 1c water and not the 1 1/2c that was suggested and Taco Flavored shredded cheese. I didn't use any avocado only because I didn't have any on hand. I bet that would have made it even better and I am not sure that is even possible. Thank You Darla for this great recipe. It will surely be put into rotation as one of our regular meals. oops almost forgot that also added a can of drained corn.

So so good!  I worried about the avocado-I love them but never eat them hot and they do get hot as the soup is, but no fear, they were heavenly.  Thanks for this recipe.  I finally found my ideal taco soup!  The only change I made was to use black beans as it was all I had on hand.

I had to make this stretch for lunches next week plus use what I had on hand. I used ground turkey, two medium yellow onions, organic canned tomatoes, organic canned kidney beans, and organic tomato sauce. I made my own taco seasoning mix. To make this more filling and to add a little more flavor, I did add in one can Mexi-corn, rinsed and drained, an additional can of organic black beans, also rinsed and drained and a couple cloves of minced garlic. After tasting it, I did add in more taco seasoning. This was okay--good enough for what I needed. I think it would have been better with broth instead of water but I was in a hurry. My husband says it's the avocado that really does it for this recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I've made this a few times with some changes & additions:  I don't like it real soupy, so I drain the beans and use only 1 cup of water. This makes it thick like chili. I use 1 lb of ground turkey, and add 2 tsp of minced garlic, 1 tsp crushed dried cilantro, and use homemade taco seasoning - 1 1/2 tbsp of which is plenty. I add about 3/4 cup of frozen corn, too. I think the tortilla chips & sour cream really make the dish, and the avocado really pulls it together! I sprinkle chopped green onions on top as well.

This recipe is perfect if you need something warm and comforting on a Friday night after a long work week.  I did make a few changes but am sure it's just as good as written.  I used ground turkey breast and 2 tbsp. McCormicks Chili-O seasoning packet.  I also added some black beans, only because I had some left-over.  I rinsed and drained the kidney beans and added extra water.  I don't care for the liquid in canned beans.  Easy yet delicious!

My husband and I both LOVE this recipe! We were going to have it on a camping trip, but decided to stay home.  The two of us at all of the Taco Soup by ourselves... GLADLY!  Our only regret was that our stomachs couldn't comfortably hold as much as we wanted to eat.  Very very good recipe.  A definite keeper!!

Sounded good, especially the comment of "taco in a bowl".  To me this was just chili, and not even good chili.  Won't be making this again.

Yummy!  My whole family really enjoyed this!  This was a last minute dinner idea and I'll be making this again.  Did increase the amount of taco seasoning to taste, other than that couldn't be easier!

This was a great recipe. It was quick and easy. I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used salsa instead, it gave it a really fresh flavor. I will make this again, my husband and kids loved it, especially with the blue corn chips!

Wow, I haven't made anything this easy in a LONG time.  This is a great weeknight meal.  I used a fresh serrano chile to spice it up.  I used a whole package of taco seasoning and a whole pound of ground beef.  I used black beans in place of kidney.  I added hominy.  I didn't have any avocado.  We topped with sliced green onions, cilantro, cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips.  It was awesome.  Served corn bread on the side.  It's definitely going in the rotation.

This is a wonderful recipe for a cold day. Really warms you up, tastes fabulous, is quick and easy, and is made from normal, everyday, pantry items. How great is that?

We loved this soup! This was so easy to put together and it looked just like chili except it didn't taste at all like chili. It did taste similar to a taco. Not exactly like a taco to me, but it's in the same family of flavors. I used 3/4 of lean beef( I did not drain the grease off), a really little (smaller than my fist) Texas Sweet onion, black beans, a 7 oz. can of mexican tomato sauce, "Homemade taco seasoning mix" (recipe here on AR) and chicken broth instead of water. My only addition was half a can of southwest corn which had diced poblano and red peppers in it. I did let this simmer for a couple of hours though as it seemed watery in taste and it needed some body after only 30 minutes. This benefited greatly from the longer simmer (with the lid off) and it was much richer and more flavorful after the longer cooking time. The next time I fix this I will use a full pound of meat and again, let it simmer for quite some time. I didn't have any avocado, but I did fry up some corn tortilla strips for garnish and this was so delicious! This yielded 4 servings, but this was so good we could have eaten a second portion. Thanks for sharing this wonderful soup with us! Total love for this dish at our house.

Excellent recipe, I only made a few minor changes, and that was I added three stalks celery, and a can of peas, a can of V8, tomato juice, and some red pepper flakes. Like other reviewers suggested, I added half a pkg of taco seasoning to the meat, the the other half the the soup. Everybody loved it, any my son keeps begging for more. This was a hit. Thank you!!

I made a few modifications as well: no avacado or sour cream, beef broth instead of water, and added corn.  So good!  I'll be making it again and again.  Two thumbs up!

I was kind of disappointed with this recipe. It had very little flavor even after adding an entire packet of taco seasoning. I followed the recipe to a "T" besides the seasoning. I think next time if I make it again I will add MUCH more spice and seasoning to give it some piazzas. Otherwise the idea is very good.

I love making this because it's quick and all in the same pot. I don't like anything super spicy, so this is just perfect for me (my husband would prefer spicier though). I do up the meat to 1 lb and use the whole packet of taco seasoning.

I'm giving this a three not because I didn't like it it was great for a day when I was pressed on time and energy, but it was really lacking in taste even after I added almost a whole package of taco seasoning (which didn't seem to do much but increase the saltiness). Overall I would make it again with some adjustments but won't be a recipe we'll eat often.

Anytime I can serve a dinner that my whole family likes, I call it GREAT! "Taco soup" is fun (chips), flavorful, and very fast and easy to prepare.  I did leave the onions out to suit my husband, though!

This recipe is mucho delicioso. I added pico de gallo after I plated and I have to say, it warms the bones.  I will definitely save this recipe.

This is good for a quick weeknight meal or a lazy Saturday night but nothing very unique.  Will make every now and then adding some minced garlic, more taco seasoning and use black beans.

I tried the recipe as is and disliked the avocado and sour cream in it. Luckily I had only put those 2 items in 1 bowl. Without them and adding corn it was fantastic.

Very very good.  Loved the avocado in this actually.  Before serving I always drop a dollop of sour cream & shred cheese on top and put Tortilla Chips around the edge of the bowl.  Love this!

I made this on the first day of winter and it really warmed us up! I used canned chili beans because we are not crazy about kidney beans. I tasted as it cooked and adjusted the spices and water as needed - I use "Tones Taco Seasoning" which is not as spicy as some. Also left out the avocado because I didn't have one on hand. Served with fritos, cheese and really don't need sour cream but it's good! Crusty French bread and butter tasted good with this too.

This is a great recipe.  We added a can of black beans and some cilantro for extra flavor.  Both additions really made the recipe even better.  We didn't use all of the water the recipe called form we added about 3/4 of a cup.

I make a vegetarian version using morning star soy crumbles. I don't always use the avocado but otherwise follow the recipe. It's very easy and very tasty. Nice flavor but not too spicy.

Nothing exceptional and I will not make this one again.  I used black beans instead of kidney.  Also, used the mexican tomatoes as another suggested to try & give it some umph.  Nothing to write home about though from our house.

Wow this was so easy and very good.  My husband woofed it down.  I used Mexican style stewed tomatoes, slightly pureed, ground sirloin and followed the recipe's amount for taco seasoning.  It was spicy and slighly hot.  I also drained my beans as someone else suggested, didn't rinse them.  Didn't have avocado but sprinkled cheese and crushed fritoes on top.  Yum.  Great on a cold raw night.  Susie

This is really good. I made some minor changes and the flavor is awesome. I substituted pinto beans for lima beans and a can of corn for hominy. I also added some chopped cilantro which makes all the difference in a dish like this one. My husband loved it.

I had this at a christmas party once and its exactly how I remembered it. I added some fresh cilantro and one small jalapeno for a little kick. I also used frittos for the corn chips and subed chilli beans for the kidney beans. I had my two kids help me It was so simple. My teen loved it and couldn't resist seconds. My 5 yr old didnt care for it but he dosnt like tacos either.

This was a great quick dinner on a very cold winter day.  I used turkey instead of beef & black beans instead of kidneys.  I also used the avocado as garnish along with the cheese, sour cream & chips.  The avocado was an excellent addition, but was afraid it would cause the soup to spoil if we didn't eat it all in one evening.

This recipe was good, but nothing special. I gave it 4 stars since it was quick and easy to put together. I left out the avacado since I didn't have one on hand, and it tasted fine without it. If I do use an avacado next time, I will probably use it as an embellishment like the cheese, sour cream and chips.

I made this for my family and we just loved it. It's great for chilly fall days. We left out the avocado because I didn't want to make a trip to the store.

I'll make this the next time we have a pot luck. It reminds me of the Chili that they use on the taco salads at Wendy's.

My husband spooned it over nacho chips and covered them with cheese and melted it in the microwave and said it was delish!

i left out the tomato sauce, because i thought that would bring it too close to being chili. absolutely delicious, and easy to adjust amounts to make enough for a crowd. i will definitely make this one of my regular recipes.

My take on this  yummy SOUPer Taco Soup... I use a whole pound of hamburg, two Vidalia onions, ( we loves onions),  petite diced reg. tomatoes, and a whole packet of Mild Taco Seasoning.  Black beans (rinsed) & the kidney beans,  plus i cup whole kernel corn.   I upped the water to 2 cups
 A half a diced Jalapeno pepper works well.   
My hubby likes it a bit spicier so he sprinkles a bit of cayenne pepper to his bowl.
What really makes it work is the grated cheddar cheese and the dollop of sour cream 

Note: Added Avacado later, as a garnish 
The great thing about this soup is you can dress it up or down .. depending on what is in the pantry .. and it's always a hit ! .

Really good starting point!  I use ground turkey (or leftover chicken breast if I have it), beef broth (or chicken) instead of the water, black beans instead of the kidney and add 1/2 a bag of frozen white corn.

Really easy and REALLY delish!!!

I LOVE this recipe with these changes: (1) use the whole packet of taco seasoning (2) black beans instead of kidney beans (3) mexican flavored stewed tomatoes (4) 1 lb ground turkey and thats it.

This is really easy and really good! I added a whole packet of taco seasoning for taste...without it, it wouldn't have had enough spice for my taste.

Really, really good!  It actually does taste like a taco in a bowl, very interesting with the tortilla chips, I have never tried something like this but the whole family enjoyed it!

It was a very good recipe.  I have been looking for a recipe similar to that for about 5 years.  So, it was nice to finally make it.  Definitly something good for potlucks, holidays and other events...very filling!!!

Even my pickiest child liked this one.  I added corn and a little extra liquid because it was too thick to call it soup at that point but otherwise followed the recipe.  And we really liked it!  My favorite part is how quickly it went together.  Thanks Darla!

Great recipe.  I used 3 chicken breasts instead of the ground beef, and used 1/2 cup water and 16 oz can of tomato sauce.  Avocados definitely added to the recipe, and with light sour cream made for a tasty soup.

Very good - but definitely do not skip out on topping it with shredded cheese, sour cream, and crushed tortilla chips (we used Doritos).  I left out the avocado because I do not like messing with them. Good comfort food for a cold winter's night!

Wow!  This is awesome.  Here are the changes I made.  Instead of Stewed tomatoes and tomatoe sauce I used 1/2 Large can of crushed tomatoes,  and upped the water to 3 or 4 cups. I also used the taco seasoning mix recipe from this site.  I spooned the hot soup over crushed tortilla chips and grated cheddar cheese, then topped with a dollop of sour cream. I omitted the avocado since I am not a huge avocado fan, but I do think a little guacamole on top would taste great too.

Wow! This dish was so quick and easy to prepare! I used the Taco Seasoning recipe on this site and it tasted delicous. I omited the onions cause I didn't have any and I will omit the avocado next time. The avocado didn't taste bad but it just didn't add any flavor, I thought. It tastes great with crunched tortilla chips on top! Thanks for a great-easy-any-day-of-the-week-warm-your-belly-up recipe!

I omitted the avocado and substituted white corn tortillas for the chips -- and it was quite good.  I'd prefer it with more spicy flavor, however.  Next time, I'll probably add more spices, in addition to the taco seasoning mix.
