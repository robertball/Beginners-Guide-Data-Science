Surprisingly easy, and wonderfully delicious.  I used the dark Karo syrup and the taste is outstanding.  It's as good as the popcorn I'd pay $30 for the same amount of here in Chicago. 

I think I only used about 3 quarts of popcorn which left a lot of caramel on each kernel just the way I like it.  I popped 1/3 cup of kernels if that helps. 

I used a disposable roasting pan, and just let the popcorn cool when it was ready; worked like a charm.  The add ins are so much fun - it really makes it festive.

This one was big hit in our house and all we made was the caramel corn. I don't think we will ever buy the "Name Brand" again.

I thought the caramel corn was absolutely delicious! I have never made it before, but I will definitely be making it again. Reese's pieces and peanuts make great stir-ins!

This caramel corn was very good and so muuch easier than making my usual popcorn balls...no burnt hands either..I do like the flavor of my Pop's molasses popcorn balls a bit better tho.
These were a big hit at my Halloween party.

There's just one word for this popcorn - YUM! I've made this three times within a week and can't get enough of it. I'm sure the phase will pass (or should I say I hope it does) but for now I'm enjoying myself! A lot of people like to use microwave popcorn but I popped my own on the stove and measured it in a wide mouth quart jar. The first time I made it I packed the jars pretty tight and there didn't seem to be enough caramel to cover it all well. My second batch was 4 quarts loosely packed and it was better but not quite covered like I would have liked it. So on my third batch I lightly packed it and used three quarts and I thought it was perfect. During the baking process I stirred it every 15 minutes and baked as directed but it was harder than I would have liked. I only baked the 3rd batch for right around 30 minutes. Using only three quarts of popcorn allowed the caramel to coat every piece. The last batch was my favorite, nicely coated and a didn't seem to be as hard as the other batches - a little easier on my teeth. I used a foil roasting pan and it worked out perfectly - clean up was a breeze so be sure to spray your foil/pan with cooking spray. Be sure when you stir it to keep the popcorn separated as best as you can and as flat as possible in your pan. It will make breaking it apart much easier. When it was done baking I kept stirring and breaking large clumps apart while it was cooling. This recipe is a keeper!

I used an air popper with a half cup of popcorn.  We thought the caramel corn was really good! Not too crunch but not so chewy that our jaws hurt. . . My husband and I do not eat a lot of sugar, and I really thought I would have to give most of this away at my work place or to my sister in law who lives in our basement.  But no, my husband said, as he was finishing off the last of it, "Too bad this caramel corn is so $%*& good!"  I am going to use this recipe as my staple caramel corn recipe, but I might use a bit less popcorn than my 1/2 cup - it was a little hard to coat all the popcorn.

What is better than addictive caramel corn? Caramel corn made with treats in it. This was a big hit among the kiddos. Made the recipe as written, it was easy peasy:)

Delicious, and much easier than I thought! My daughter and I added green food coloring to make "zombie boogers." Her favorite part was adding the baking soda ;) Very easy to reduce calories using light butter (or in our case, vegan) and light sugar.

This was great! My little guy had a blast mixing all of the different candies together w/ the popcorn. This would be very popular at any kind of party, by just adjusting the types of candy that you are using. The caramel corn part took me 2 tries to get right, but that was adjustments that I needed to make according to how my stove/oven works. I will def be keeping this idea in mind for the future! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious!  When making this I used the candy thermometer to see what temp the syrup came to after boiling for the alloted time - and it was at a hard crack - The corn was crispy and stayed that way.  Love this recipe!  So easy!

This is really delicious. I made it twice this month - once for the kids (OK, I'll admit, I ate a lot of that batch!) and again for treat bags for my little girl's birthday party. We added Autumn Mix, the mixed candy corn. I looked and looked for gummy worms to up the creep factor but couldn't find any! I'll make this again with other holiday and seasonal add-ins. The kids and I loved it. It stays crunchy for a long time in a sealed plastic bag.

I used 2 bags of microwave popcorn and found that it was too hard to evenly coat all that popcorn and spread it out on a baking tray, so next time I'll just do one bag at a time.....no fault of the recipe however; just not a well-thought out execution on the cook's part, ha! Since this was my practice run, I made up treat bags and sent to my daughter's daycare Halloweeen party. Add-ins I used were: candy corn, peanut butter M&Ms, and chocolate-covered pretzels. Tasty!

This Caramel Corn is ab fab.  I have made the non-treat bag version 3 times and this one once (the caramel corn recipes are the same, this just adds the suggestion to make treat bags with additional candy).  The kids had fun making the treat bags.  The candy I used was: M&M', Reeses's Pieces and Gummy Life Savers.  This treat can't go wrong, and I highly recommend you try it.

This caramel corn is perfect. Recipe is easy and tasty. It is important to keep the corn warm in the oven for about 5-10 mins. while you make the syrup. I usually just add some peanuts but this time we add candy corn, m&m's and a few more candies. The girls loved it for the Halloween party.

This was the first time I ever made caramel corn and I will not hesitate to do it again in the future!  I popped my own corn, one-half cup kernels yielded the 4 quarts needed for the recipe.  I used a disposable foil roaster that I sprayed with cooking spray and had no problems with anything sticking.  The amount of caramel covered the popcorn thoroughly.  I opted to add pretzels, dry roasted peanuts, chocolate covered raisins, Reese's Pieces, M&Ms, gummy worms, candy corn and little jelly pumpkins directly to the bowl of corn. It looked so cute sitting out on the table with all of the goodies in it!

Nothing shouts out 'fresh caramel corn' better than this Karo Syrup recipe. Easy and fun to make with the grand kids. Mixed with gummy worms, candy pumpkins and nuts for a Halloween treat.

This caramel corn was good. I made it for the Allrecipes Allstars October Halloween treats. For the popcorn, I used Allrecipes "Microwave Popcorn" recipe. I made 3 bags of it to have enough fully popped popcorn. The recipe works great in my low wattage microwave. On both sheets I lined them with thick foil before spraying which made for easy clean-up. As the full recipe is 16 cups of popcorn a full or commercial sized sheet pan is needed. Only issue I had was, just made it is nice and crispy. However, by the next day it takes on a more chewy texture. I wasn't sure the best way to store it to keep it crisp. I plan to test it with the add-ins tommorrow, but quite frankly I am happy with caramel corn as is.

This recipe is great. Super-quick (at least the pre-baking part), and really easy (especially if you have made coated popcorn before). I used 3 bags of microwaved popcorn (I'm not sure if that is a good conversion, but it gave a nice coverage for me). The caramel itself would make very tasty chewy candies too I think (what I peeled off the spatula was yummy). :)

I liked this recipe, it really helped me break in a movie theater style popper. I used the last quarter cup of dark corn syrup with the clear light. While the flavor was overall nice, it didn't stay crunchy very long. The longer it set in bowls on my buffet for a party, the softer it got...not understanding why when I followed it to a T (and thought I baked it too long) like I said, flavor was great. I used dried blueberries(oh my gosh good!), mini pretzels, sour gummie worms, assorted candy corn mix, gummy eyes, Reece's Pieces, and dry roasted peanuts. Gave that salty sweet flavor, yum. But no one complained on the caramel corn being too soft later in the evening(I'm just the one that noticed).

Turned out perfectly! I made a triple batch, cooking it in two batches. We ate almost too much the first night to enjoy anymore (but I'm sure by tonight we'll be ready to eat some!).

Decided to try this caramel popcorn out since it has been such a hit on AR! I think this might be the best caramel popcorn I've ever had! I was worried about not having enough caramel to cover the popcorn but once it started cooking it melted more and covered fine. My popcorn was ready to be taken out after just 30 minutes of cooking. My husband, son, and I couldn't stop eating it!

This was addictive.  One bite led to another, and another, and another...  I'm really glad I had some little orange bags to send the extra home with guests!  I decided to pre-mix with raisins, almonds and candy corn.  Great for kids and kids-at-heart!  I made this with the light syrup, but I believe it would be better with the dark syrup.

Such a great idea! I am a sucker for caramel popcorn and this recipe did not disappoint! And the kids had a fabulous time adding all their mix-ins.  It was a great activity for an early halloween party!

This was a fun one and it came out just sweet enough. I had trouble mixing the popcorn with the sauce but, my popcorn wasn't hot enough,I think. I added mixed nuts, candy corn, chocolate covered raisins and M&'s.

Delicious and great fun for the kids to mix their own goodies into the caramel corn.  I used some dried cranberries, blueberries and pineapple in addition to the candy.  Definitely worth the effort, good caramel corn.

Oh yum-yum-yummy! I really loved this stuff. The caramel was fabulous and it was a lot easier than I thought it would be. I used Dark Karo for this recipe. I made the popcorn using Microwave Popcorn (AR) because I couldn't seem to manage it on the stove :/ I added mixed nuts, candy corn and m&ms. This is actually pretty addictive I had to really convince myself to walk away. Family loved it too!

I've never particularly cared for caramel corn, but this was so good!
I made it for my daughter's Halloween party and the girls could not stop eating it. This is a great recipe. I can't wait to make it with some red & green candies in it for our Christmas party.

This caramel corn was so easy to throw together. I did my popcorn in the microwave. The caramel that went over the popcorn was delicious! My mom couldn't keep her fingers out of it. I will be making this often. Thank you Karo for pairing with the Allstars this month!

The first time I made this recipe, I cut down the caramel mixture by half.  It was really good, but the SECOND time I made it, I went all out!  It was fabulous and it was a big hit at our (early) Halloween party!  I would make this recipe again...and again...again...and not just for Halloween!

Such a great idea! First of all - I can't believe Caramel Corn is this easy!!! I'm kicking myself for all of the years I've spent "big bucks" on the tins of it! Adding all the extra treats made for game-day fun for the kiddos as well as the grown-ups. Hubby & Son then made their own little sacks to take to the deer stand. This is a winner!

Fresh caramel corn tastes so good and it's easy to make if you carefully follow the directions. In case anyone is wondering about  doubling the recipe... I had planned on doing three separate batches but ran out of time, so I took a risk and dumped in triple the ingredients for the caramel and it came out perfectly! As it was cooling, I added in a few bags of gummy worms, candy corn and m&m's. The 60 teenagers that got some declared it the 'best ever' and dubbed me 'the coolest chaperone ever'!

This recipe will give you delicious caramel corn!  I made my treats using the caramel corn, pretzels, salted peanuts, and assorted candies.  My kiddos will love this, I'm also looking forward to sharing it with friends.  Thanks!

This stuff is awesome!  Darling husband made popcorn this afternoon to eat while watching football so I snagged some for this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly and I feel like the caramel is just slightly burned.  I may cut down the baking time just a bit.  Thanks!

I love the ideas of how cute these are and we had a great time putting the bags together.  However, I'm not a big fan of working with the syrup and HFCS.

The caramel corn itself is delish!  I used the dark Karo syrup and popped a 1/2 cup of corn kernel in the air popper.  Next time I would pop just a little less though to get more coverage of the yummy caramel.  I don't even think it made 4 quarts, which seems like it would be entirely too much popcorn.  We didn't particularly care for candy with our caramel corn though.

The was AMAZING! One problem was keeping it crunchy. Will be trying out different methods of storing it to solve this problem. I was so glad my first time trying to make this turned out so good. I did spread the popcorn out on parchment paper instead of the sprayed foil. I also decreased the amount of popcorn as I saw I was running out of caramel to make sure it coated really well.
