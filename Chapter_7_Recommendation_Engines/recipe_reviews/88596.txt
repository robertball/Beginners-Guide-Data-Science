This is the first time I tried this receipe and indeed it was awesome. The only variation I used was freshly ground sea salt/freshly ground pepper blend, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to taste. In addition, I used flavored breads crumbs as opposed to the plain bread crumbs.  I used about a pound of scallops instead of the 16 as recommended in the recipe The dish was prepared and cooked in a 9 x 13 pyrex dish sprayed with a non-stick cooking spray.

These are better than awesome!  Other reviewers noted not to use all of the topping the recipe calls for - I disagree.  But instead of putting all of the topping on top of the scallops, I put a little dab on each scallop and scattered the rest of the topping around the scallops, allowing the topping to "soak up" the melted butter/garlic mix that I did not discard, but poured over and around scallops in the casserole dish - this came out crispy and delicious!  And easy??  This is the first time I've ever cooked scallops (was always afraid to) and this recipe made me a whiz at it!  Will be making this again!!

This recipe is awesome! I made this to the directions for my wife's 40th birthday party. The only problem is the guests wanted more! The only recommondation is you Must use Digby Scallops.

The bread crumb topping MADE this dish. My guests loved this recipe. Raved about it. Served with asparagus, orzo,  and another baked Lemon garlic Tilapia dish on this site. They both baked together in the oven side by side, which made it very easy.

This recipe is great AND simple. I placed lightly sauted asparagus and sliced mushrooms in the bottom of an individual serving dish and placed the scallops on top. My husband loved it.

Definitely a keeper! I reduced the serving to one since I mainly just cook for myself.  The only change I made was using chopped red onion since I did not have a shallot.  If sea scallops were cheaper, I would make this more often!

Very tasty recipe.  I cut down the garlic to two cloves and still felt it was too overpowering due to the short baking time.  Served with orzo pasta tossed with sauteed asparagus, mushrooms, garlic and parmesan cheese.

This recipe was horrible.  Way too much of the bread crumbs.  They didn't seem to match with the scallops.  The scallops were boring.  Will not make this again.

As the title says, this recipe is AWESOME!  Made this for my wife for Valentine's Day, and it was a huge hit.  The only changes I made were to cut the garlic to 1 clove, add 2 tsp Old Bay seasoning and 1 tsp grated parmesean cheese to the breadcrumb mixture, add 2 tsp Old Bay the to the scallop marinade, and then cook the whole thing in a preheated iron skillet instead of a baking dish.  The old bay added a wonderful undertone to the dish, and the iron skillet put a nice brown sear on the scallops

When I read a recipe, if it sounds good, I will go to the grocery store and buy the things I do not have just to follow it to exactly as is.  Then, after making it according to the recipe, I will make adjustments.  This one needed no adjustments (well, it really didn't need any salt at all).  In this case, I don't usually have shallots on hand and the ground nutmeg -- well it was sort of old.  And when you pay $10 for 4 sea scallops you want the ingredients to be the very best!  I LOVED this.  I used plain unseasoned panko bread crumbs.  When after 13 minutes they were brown enough I hit the broiler button -- perfecto!  Browned, beautiful, and bubbling!  I wish I had taken a picture!

I didn't think 11 to 14 minutes was long enough to get fresh breadcrumbs as crisp as I would like, so I used panko and toasted them in a non-stick skillet with 1 tablespoon of butter until they were golden brown.  After they were cool I mixed in some parmesan and used them to top the scallops.  Also I sauted the garlic and shallots in 1 tablespoon of butter (just to get rid of the raw taste), added a little white wine, let it reduce and then added the rest of the butter.  I'm not a big fan of nutmeg, so I just used one scant pinch and tossed in some tarragon.  This dish was delicious, and we enjoyed it very much.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  First time I made it I followed the directions exactly and loved it.  The second time I replaced the bread crumbs with  half the amount of panko and added fresh grated parmesan cheese.  I also topped with fresh lemon juice once cooked (parsley optional).  Have been cooking it this way ever since.  Delicious!

Everything about this recipe sounded great...the ingredients as well as the reviews, but I was a little disappointed (so was my family).  I doubled the amount of scallops, but left the remainder of the recipes as stated.  My only issue was that the garlic and shallots did not cook in the 11 to 15 minutes of baking.  The end result was so strong, it overpowered the scallops.  Next time I will saute the garlic and shallots in the butter until translucent before combining with the scallops.  I might also reduce the number of cloves of garlic...five seemed like too many.

I used a 12 oz bag of peruvian bay scallops i had in the freezer. I kept the butter, garlic, and onion amounts the same. I also lighlty seasoned with the nutmeg, salt, and pepper. I didn't use any parsley. And as other suggested, I sauteed the onions and garlic in the butter first. When I placed it all in the baking dish, I simply sprinkled bread crumbs on top by hand, probably only using 1/4c. Baked for about 10 min... Fantastic!! (I also learned something new: scallops shrink when you cook them! lol Definitely need to make MORE next time.)

Loved, loved, loved this recipe!  If you are looking for a quick, sure-fire scallop recipe this is the one.  I prepared exactly as directed, garlicky, flavorful, delish.  Next time I will put the finished product under the broiler for a few seconds to really crisp up the breadcrumbs.  Squirt a little lemon juice over before serving.  A winner!

very yummy!  I added a bit more butter and a tad less bread crumbs than the recipe called for...delicious!  I think even a sprinkle of mozz. cheese over them would be great too!  I served them with a light caesar salad.

Scallops are one of my favorite treats in restaurants, and I enjoyed trying this recipe. I will make again, with a couple of tweaks. The flavor was good, but I think I'm missing the zing of white wine in the sauce. I am not a big wine drinker or cook with it that often, but following the seasonings as directed I thought it was pleasant but unremarkable. 16 was slightly over a pound for me, and I thought there was wayyy too much butter for that amount. I tossed the butter with the scallops then actually drained some off and used that ~2.5 tbsp with ~1.5 tbsp oil for the crumb topping. And there was a lot of topping, I didn't use quite the whole amount but had a thick blanket, but as mentioned it does mix with the sauce and get crispy and good. For our tastes, I would have preferred a moist juicy layer of scallops topped with a few dollops of buttery breadcrumbs. I will use this recipe as a solid base in the future for my dream scallop dish, but as written it's very yummy too. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was awesome! I didn't have enough scallops for the full recipe and there were only 2 of us, so I tried to cut the measurements accordingly.  I added a splash of white wine to the mixture and I think the sugars in the wine helped to carmelize the mixture around the scallops.  I plan to make this again and add some lump crab meat. I didn't quite understand other's comments about having too much topping, what I didn't need on top of the scallops fell around the scallops and created this wonderful sauce; the shallots and butter and wine created this awesome sauce that I wish I had something to serve it on top of, like a pasta.  This is definitely a keeper.

We tried this for the first time the other night and will definitely be making again. It was absolutely outstanding! After reading other reviews I decided to use Italian bread crumbs instead of plain. I think it added a lot to the dish, but would also be good plain- just depends on the flavor you're looking for. Next time I will only use 3-4 Tbsp butter and only 1/2 cup bread crumbs. Also make sure you allow the scallops to rest in the butter mixture 5-10 minutes. It gives them more time to absorb everything. We served it with Orzo with Parmesan and Basil from this website and fresh cut green beans. Yum!

This was a disappointing dish.  I followed the recipe as is.  The shallots were too strong and competed with the delicate scallop flavor and the bread crumbs (I used "homemade" from farmer's market) were fairly tasteless and gritty, a lot like sand.  Should I try it again, I would saute the garlic and shallots first and season the bread crumbs and use butter instead of olive.

Very delicious! Next time I will use a sweet onion instead of shallots. Shallots are expensive & I can't tell any difference in the taste. The fumes were so strong I had to fan the area to keep from "crying." Also, you must use  "seasoned" bread crumbs, not plain, or the flavor just won't be there. I omitted the parsley & lemon. Very yummy! I added sides of rice pilaf, plus asparagus.

They are called awesome for a reason.  These are delicious!  The only change I made was using panko bread crumbs.  I served it with an orzo side dish that incorporated some of the same ingredients as the scallops, lemon, olive oil, parsley, garlic.  oh my!  The bread crumbs melded perfectly with the orzo.  I only wish I could have eaten it all, but had to share with my daughter, who loved it as well.  A keeper!

This was good as written but I think it could be much better.  After tasting these I added freshly grated parmesan cheese which drastically improved the flavor but it would have been better baked in with the breadcrumb mixture.  I also think adding some seasoning like Old Bay or something similar to the butter and garlic mixture would be excellent.  The cooking time was perfect so the texture of the scallops was great.

this recipe was awsome! I did, of course, taylor it a intsy bit, I simply sprinkled italian breadcrumbs on top with dots of butter, instead of using the whole cup. I also added a good splash of dry white wine to the butter sauce after sauteing the garlic and shallots. The last 3 or 4 min broil the scallops for a beautiful golden crust . Everybody loved it including my teenagers!

Vey good recipie... Served to my mom who really doen't care for scallops much but liked these. recipie scales well. My only changes were sprinkle a little paprika on top and, since I used frozen scallops, to soak the scallops in 50/50 water and skim milk to thaw them.(this works great on any frozen seafood to remove "fishiness"... rinse and pat them dry before proceeding) What impressed me most about the recipe is that even with strong seasonings the scallops retained thier delecate taste. Cheers!

I modified this recipe somewhat, because I thought that having ONLY scallops might be a little boring. So, I cut the scallop portion in 1/3, added 1/3 jumbo shrimp and 1/3 squid. I also added some chili pepper flakes. The result was fantastic.

Delicious & very easy.  Made it exactly as written & the boyfriend & I both loved it.  FYI-  If you aren't a big garlic fan, you will probably want to cut down on the number of cloves you use as this dish is quite garlic-y.

Absolutely FANTASTIC!  I don't think I used quite the amount of butter it called for , and I did not have nutmeg.  We made pasta and it was perfect and saucy enough to go over it, with asparagus and mushrooms.  We were loving life.

This was my first time cooking large sea scallops. I agree with many others that the breadcrumbs were way overpowering and reduced the flavor of the shallots, garlic and the scallops. At the same time, the recipe was very simple and quick. I served it on a bed of pasta with a light white wine and olive oil sauce with mushrooms, garlic, some greens and crumbled bacon, and the breadcrumbs soaked up the pasta sauce making the whole meal seem really dry. This recipe is way too bready, and especially over pasta. I think next time I will pan sear my scallops to serve with pasta, or just make enough breadcrumbs for this recipe to just cover the tops and serve it on a large serving of cooked greens without any pasta.

I've never made scallops before and was afraid of overcooking with this recipe cooked the scallops perfectly. The only thing I did differently was to saute the garlic and shallots in the melted butter just to soften them a little. My neighbor got the leftovers, I bought too much, and is still raving about them.

Very good! I followed the recipe as written, except I subbed green onions instead of the shallot (because I had it on hand), and used half panko breadcrumbs and half regular (I only had a 1/2 cup of each on hand), and it was excellent. My scallops were still a bit underdone after 14 minutes, we needed more like 18. Served with chive mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus.

Fantastic! But definitely not diet friendly - to make it a little healthier I cut back the butter to 2 1/2 TBS (I think the full amount would be way too much anyways). A cup of the breadcups also proved to be too much - I only used half for the 16 sea scallops I got to feed a party of two. The flavor was awesome and I will definitely use this recipe again!

Let me start by saying I don't like scallops. Well, now I do! These were incredible! I served them over linguine pasta. I didn't use near all the breadcrumbs and I added fresh grated Parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs. Just wish I had waited until Valentine's Day to make it because it was so pretty and perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!

DH and I had this last night and it was truly awsome.  My variations: 1) I melted the butter in the casserole dish in the microwave then cooked the chopped onions for 2 minutes more in the butter; 2) I added some mushrooms that needed to be used; 3) I used seasoned croutons smashed up for the topping; 4) Mine took closer to 30 minutes to cook (probably because my scallops were very large).  Definite keeper.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I loved this recipe.  The scallops came out soft, seasoned and perfectly cooked.  Oh, how I loved these scallops.
This is the first recipe I have used for scallops.  I will not be looking for another one. 

Quick, easy, yummy, what more could you want??

Thx for Sharing,
:@)

We made this recipe as published.  While in theory this is a good dish, in practice the scallops are overwhelmed by the volume of breadcrumbs.  Making it this way results in a "heavy" dish.
Do yourself a favor (in my humble opinion)- use one shallot, three cloves garlic, and cut the amount of breadcrumbs to 1/2 cup max for the same number of scallops.  The breadcrumbs should be an accent allowing the scallops to shine, not piled on top like a cherry crumb pie.

I made this for my fiance who is from New England. He loved it. I followed directions exactly for the scallops. I used extra virgin olive oil and Italian bread crumbs. I placed this on top of sautéed mushrooms, spinach and bacon bits and baked for 20 minutes as I had very large scallops. It was perfect bread crumbs and all.

This was really good! I used it as a jumping off point more than anything: I had bay scallops enough for 2 people who eat totally different things. DH got olive oil, salt, pepper and panko; I got coconut oil, pepper, lime juice and white wine. The cooking time was perfect (400' for 12 minutes) and both dishes of scallops came out great. Saving this one!

I absolutely love this recipe.  Everyone I've made it for says they are better than the restaurant's  baked scallops.  I really think that the nutmeg is vital to making this dish.  I am not a big fan of nutmeg, unless it is on a Brandy Alexander as a rule.  
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with everyone that is so kind.

I am also from Maine, and this scallop dish is far below my expectations.  There is way too much breading for my taste.  The scallop flavor is masked with the bread.  The only substitution I made was chopped onion for the shallots (didn't have them).  Definitely will go back to just lemon butter, salt, and pepper under the broiler.

This dish is fabulous!  I love scallops but really don't know how to cook them like they do in restaurants.  This was better than anything I had in a restaurant!  It's super easy and quick.  I didn't change anything.  We'll have this again and again!

I thought this was really good but next time I'll skip the bread crumbs and quickly sear them when I take them out of the oven.  The kids didn't like the bread crumbs although I did.  Great recipe, I'll use again.

Flavor wise this dish is one of my new favorites! The nutmeg is just subtle - the only things I changed were adding red pepper, using Vidalia instead of shallots, and garlic powder instead of fresh clove.   The cook time was way off! After 14 min the scallops in the center were barely cooked, so total cook time ended up around 20 min.   I also wasn't a fan of the olive oil in the topping - it just made it heavy & greasy. Next time I'll decrease the amount of olive oil & maybe add a little butter so it crisps.

Effortless way to get perfectly-done scallops.  My familly loved it--no leftovers, boo hoo.  Used only pinch of nutmeg.  Used homemade French bread chunks, and they were like mini garlic toasts. It was all so good that I wanted to lick the serving bowl before I washed it.

This IS an awesome dish.  I changed almost nothing. Did use Italian bread crumbs and 1 lb of small scallops tho.  I made for myself and my husband with orzo and asparagus.  Wow, what a great meal.  Will make again for sure!!

This recipe was awesome and so simple to prepare!  I added a dash of old bay seasoning and a splash of white wine to mine and it was great!  i also made it using shrimp instead of scallops and it was just as good.

Wonderfully easy tasty recipe. I just prepared this recipe for my husband and he almost ate them all himself. I made minor changes.  Used Panko Italian style all natural breadcrumbs and used three tablespoons of butter and two tablespoons of non-hydrogenated extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) buttery spread in an attempt to limit the cholesterol and to see if doing so would mar the delicious flavor.  It was scrumptious.  Next time I will try this recipe using only the EVOO spread and see if the flavor remains intact. I agree with another reviewer  with regard to using all the breadcrumbs.  I love garlic and used as written and used all the breadcrumbs within the dish.   I also found that I needed to broil the scallops for a short time to give them just the right look.

This is a very tasty, easy recipe. Perfect for company! I would recommend using a 9X13 pan so that the bread crumbs can brown on all sides of  each scallop.  For the dish to work the bread crumbs need to be brown and crunchy.  Delicious!

Made these for Christmas eve. Best Scallops I have had. I melted the butter in a pan put in garlic and onions then scallops cooked over medium about 5 minutes then placed in a casserole dish and put bread crumb mixture on top and baked as stated. Scallops came out just right. Loved it.

This was so simple, yet so good!  I usually pan sear scallops, but I wanted something different. I squeezed lemon juice in with the melted butter, used scallions instead of shallots, baked for 11 minutes and they came out perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I will not make this recipe again, as I thought it kind of bland.  Also, the bread crumbs only got crispy on the very top, and were mushy where they were in contact with the scallops.  I tried to cook it longer so they cooked more, and it was less runny, but then the scallops began to get rubbery.

Needed a recipe for a quick dinner, and this one was AWESOME..My boyfriend loves scallops and I have been hesitant to cook them, until this recipe jumped out at me! YUMMY! He loved them..I made the recipe as is, and it was perfect. A keeper for sure.

this recipe is awesome!! I only used 3 tbsp of butter bc that's all I had. Make sure you don't skimp on the ingredients. The breadcrumbs are really important so buy good quality kind. If you buy organic breadcrumbs like I do, make sure to add more salt. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. Before putting it into the (hot) oven, I lightly mixed the breadcrumbs with the scallops instead of just using it as a topping. Definitely a winner. I'd like to use shrimp or a mix of seafood with this recipe.

Awesome is right!  I'm from Maine too, but I used some super huge Russian sea scallops (dry) and they were fantastic.  I used Panko crumbs for extra crisp-ness   To save a dish I melted the butter right in a pyrex baker and tossed the scallops right in the pan.  The only addition I made was a little lemon pepper seasoning in the bread crumbs.  This is definately a keeper.

A little too much garlic for me, but I do tend to be somewhat heavy handed with garlic so it may have been me, but with a sprinkle of manuka smoked salt this dish was very good all the same.

Had this tonight & it was fantastic. Usually I try out the recipe as written; then make changes in subsequent times. I will not change a thing w/ this recipe. The broth from the scallops enhanced the flavor of the breadcrumbs. I did use Panko breadcrumbs, which are exceptionally tasty.

I divided the dish into boat ramekins and then drizzled a tablespoon of white wine over each one (I mean, what could be bad with that!)
 Also, for the breadcrumbs, I used crumbs from baguettes that I had frozen.  I think if you use those store-bought dried crumbs, you won't enjoy the results.  These "fresh" crumbs were fantastic.  They absorbed the flavours and browned beautifully, giving a nice crunch to the finished dish.  My husband felt there was too much butter, so I may cut it down a bit the next time.  Definitely a company dish!

Good flavor - I also add Old Bay and Smoked Paprika.  Next time I'd back for 18-20 minutes instead of 14 as they were barely cooked.  Of course this depends on the size of the scallops.

Made the recipe using the exact instructions.  I thought It was very good. My girlfriend didn't enjoy it but she doesn't like seafood.  The scallops seemed to cool off very quickly so eat fast. HA

WAY too much bread crumbs, and was a little too salty for me.  Also, too much butter.  I may try it again, but I will cut down on everything.

I haven't given up. This was VERY bland and I even doctored it according to the suggestions. I used large scallops so perhaps that made a difference. They really needed to be quickly pan seared first to get that carmelized flavour to them.

We really liked this dish but think next time I will leave out the nutmeg and add about 1/2 cup of 3 cheese deli mix to the bread crumbs.

I just finished making this recipe along with a steak and rice pilaf and acorn squash....absolutely perfect....my husband called the meal better than a restaurant....I changed only two things....I used two large garlic toes instead of 5 (it was just right for our tastes...and my husband is Italian) and used 1/2 an onion because I didn't have any scallions.....please try this...it's so nice to bake them instead of having to sear them and fuss with them. They are baked and delicious while you are preparing  the rest of the meal.  Thanks, Styin

I changed quite a few things when I tried this recipe, so this isn't really a review of this recipe, but more a suggestion of an alternate way to make it. I needed to make it gluten free for my family so I substituted crushed corn chex for the bread crumbs. I was really impressed; it really gave it an excellent flavor. I used bay scallops instead of sea scallops, green onions for the shallots, and I substituted butter for the olive oil. I also added a little minced fresh parsley into the crumbs. I kept the same baking instructions and served with fresh lemon (highly recommended). This was delicious! My husband wanted the scallops, which I'm not a fan of, but the breading tasted so good that I didn't even notice the scallops! Lol, that's either good or bad depending on how much you like scallops, but this variation was delicious and gluten free. Loved it!

Great tasty recipe!  I made this as is except only made 2 servings and added blanched broccoli in casserole dish.  I also put pats of butter on top of the panko bread crumb mixture.  Thank you for a keeper.

My wife made this recipe for Christmas guests and I did not care for it. I can eat almost anything and this wasn't something I could handle. I assume my wife did everything correctly but it's possible something was omitted. I wouldn't recommend this especially if you're having guests.

I made these scallops tonight for dinner and served them alongside some lemon spaghetti (Rachael Ray's recipe).  The end result was pretty darn good, but if I were to make them again, I would change a few things.  My DH over salted the scallops (which isn't the fault of the recipe), but I mention it as a point of caution because scallops are pretty briny to begin with (plus if you're using salted butter, this will add to it); so be careful of the amount of salt you use.  Secondly, we used panko instead of regular bread crumbs and we found that it was just too much bread crumb for the amount of scallops (1 lb which is about 16 medium/large scallops).  Next time, I would reduce the amount of panko to 2/3 cup.  Lastly, 5 Tbsp of butter is too much, you could easily cut this in half and still get the buttery flavor (especially considering the olive oil used on the bread crumbs).

i made this yummy dish as directed with the exception of omitting the parsley & lemon. we thought the scallops were very tasty however would've preferred the topping (i used panko bread crumbs) to have a drier texture. i reheated 4 leftover scallops the next day & found them to be just as good as when they were fresh baked. thanks christine!

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was very tasty! I must say though, I did not actually measure any of the ingredients out, but merely "eyed" it. However, I used about 12 scallops, but not nearly as much of the other ingredients. It still turned out full of flavor, and unfortunately, there were no leftovers. I usually just pan fry scallops scampi style, so this was a nice change.

This is a great recipe, but I would suggest one change: I find that  the breadcrumbs tend to get a little mushy, and I now use herb-seasoned stuffing (Pepperidge Farm does nicely).  The texture is a little rougher than breadcrumbs, and the seasoning goes well with the other ingredients.

This turned out great!!
a few adjustments.. but only because I was short on ingredients....
I only had Panko bread crumbs, which take forever to brown. I didnt want to overcook the scallops so I used finely crushed butter crackers. 
Also my garlic was green so I used garlic powder... I always use fresh, but this adjustment was just fine.

The flavor was nice and the prep was easy, but the recipe seems off.  I only used about half of the bread crumbs and the rest went to waste since I had already added the oil.  This recipe doesn't make enough sauce to cover pasta or rice so a separate side dish rounded out the meal.  Not quite the recipe I was hoping for, but still enjoyable.

I thought the dressing was wonderful, however, the scallops were overdone.  I will cook them for less time in the future.  Overall, a very good dish, thanks for the recipe!

I lightly sauteed the shallots and garlic before mixing everything together, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This was excellent served over whole wheat pasta. I would definitely make it again.

I was really excited about this recipe but was really disappointed in the end.  I thought the bread crumbs over powered the flavor of the scallops and it was way too much bread crumbs for what the recipe called for.  I might try it again and tweak a few things.

We loved this dish.  I followed one of the reviewers and added some Old Bay Spice, but will only use a sprinkling next time as it was a little too spicy but it was still excellent.  Will certainly make it again real soon.

Absolutely fantastic and oh so easy.  I made this for my family for Christmas Eve dinner.  Served it with roasted asparagus and orzo pasta.  A definite keeper for special occasions as it is very rich.

thought these turned out pretty bland. Wouldn't do as much panko, either. I added some compari tomatoes during the cooking to add some flavor, helped a bit. I would add the fresh lemon juice to it before cooking, or maybe some fresh oj.

EASY! I was out of butter and had to substitute with olive oil and it still came out wonderfully.  I agree with the reviewers who cut down on the topping.

I made this for Valentines Day and was not disappointed!  I did cut the recipe way down to just making 6 scallops but other than that I did not change a thing.  They were awesome and I will definately make them again.

Awesome!  My husband and I liked this dish, the scallops were so tender and flavorful.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I crushed up some croutons that I had in the cupboard.  I cooked for 14 minutes and it looked perfect, the breadcrumbs had browned perfectly and the butter and garlic were bubbling all around.  Yummy!  I used 3 cloves of garlic and I think next time I'll cut it down to 2.

I substituted salt and pepper with Old Bay.  The taste was great.  However, I thought there were too many bread crumbs.  We scraped most of them off.

Didn't change a thing.  Just right as it is written.  Thought all that garlic would be too strong, but surprisingly, it complimented the scallops, not overpowered them.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I made this recipe tonight, and made two dishes b/c it sounded so delicious...my family was not disappointed!  Even my picky 2-year old ate some.  I served mine with shell pasta and a siide of bread and it was perfect!  I love it when they ask for seconds! Thanks for a great recipe-this one's a keeper!

Scrumptious! I used fresh bread crumbs w/ butter (just whizz some bread in the food processor).It really made the dish I'll probably use more next time. I couldn't help but think how good it would be tossed with some angel hair pasta. Will make again.

Hubby loves scallops-me-not so much-made this last night and he loved it. a little too rich for me-I used more garlic and less butter and oil-4 TB butter and 3 TB oil-with panko breadcrumbs and a little bit of cheese in the topping.

This was very yummy and easy to make. I thought there were way to much bread crumbs though and they did not get very crunchy because alot of them fell to the bottom. I will probably add mushrooms next time and less bread crumbs.

Wonderful!  Used panko instead of regular breadcrumbs, and added the parsley to the mix, as well as a garnish.  This recipe is a keeper in our house.

I loved this recipe. The scallops were perfectly baked & super flavorful. Easy to make, too. I used panko bread crumbs & added 1/2 olive oil in place of more butter. Plus I added more crushed garlic for our taste. The crust turned out crunchy & the sauce in the dish was delicious. I will be making this dish again very soon!

Definitley half the topping.  It is delicious but the topping can overpower the taste of the scallops.  Also, don't use as much butter or olive oil.  You won't miss it.

Very easy, flavorful and quick. I would definitely cut the butter at least by half, and I didn't mix the crumbs with oil - I sprinkled the crumbs over the top then gave them a quick spray with Pam - tasted just fine and reduced the fat content.

Easy and Delicious. I enjoyed making this recipe. I didn't have shallots but used a plain white onion finely diced. I did take the suggestion about the Italian Bread crumbs and they really added to it. I will consider this recipe a keeper YUMMY!

Very good.  Our grocery store doesn't carry shallots so i used 3 extra garlic cloves & a small onion--because of that the onion/garlic overpowered.  I will try to find a store with shallots next time.

The flavor was good - but for a stronger fish.  It totally overpowered the delicate flavor of the scallops.

Fantastic!  Easy too.  I ended up getting 1lb of smaller bay scallops and this recipe was perfect.  I also sprinkled fresh parsley over the scallops before adding the bread crumbs (I also used Italian seasoned crumbs) and allowed the flavors to blend.  I'd never used shallot before so I'm assuming it was 2 sections of shallots not 2 whole; it was a little strong.  I'll definitely make this again!

This recipe has a nice flavor, but I agree about using less bread crumbs.  I also think you can use less butter.

I made this with my boyfriend on a regular friday night. We wanted something quick and easy. This fit the bill. We used frozen sea scallops. They were a little pricy, but a meal of scallops would cost you double the price for one portion only. I thought the scallops were delicious. We used italian flavored bread crumbs, but I think i'll use less bread crumbs the next time I make it. This would make a good meal or apetizer if you're having guests.

This was fantastic! I've lived in New England my entire life and I have never had scallops like this.  They were wicked good.  I cooked them for my fiance last night, and he said that we should make it again next time we're having people over.  Who would have thought such a simple recipe would have such delicious results!  Fantastic!

We used 2lb of small scallops and doubled almost everything in the recipe - except a little less butter and not as much bread crumb and oil topping.
The recipe was very easy and it turned out great - but very garlicky, so if you're not a fan of garlic you should use less, but we love garlic so that wasn't a problem.

My husband RAVED about this.  He kept saying, "This is so good, trust me, this could be served at a 5 star restaurant."  He is usually nice about my cooking, but this was over the top!  I used a little white wine too, and the garlic flavored bread crumbs.  The topping is certainly yummy.

I just finished eating with my husband.  We did enjoy the scallops.  However, I followed the recipe for 2 only and found that the scallops were overwhelmed by the breadcrumbs.  Next time I will cut back on the breadcrumbs.  The rice I served with this was blah.  It definitely needs a side dish with lots of flavor and moisture. I will try it again.

These tasted great! My husband and I ate all 16 scallops by ourselves !!! ha ha! I halved the bread crumb mixture and it was still plenty. I also increased the total baking time to about 20 min. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I've made this recipes several times so far. It's amazing! I've tried other scallop recipes and none have this one beat. I baked scallops that were a little frozen when I placed them in the oven, so I just baked them a little bit longer. I dropped in some shrimp to this dish, too.  Wonderful!

These were very good, especially from supermarket scallops that don't have the same excellent flavor you might get from a fishmonger.

awesome like the name says! i unfortunately did not have a baking dish, so i prepared everything minus the breadcrumbs and cooked them over a pan (flipping occasionally) until they were well cooked. transferred scallops with a baking pan, covered with breadcrumbs, and into an oven on broil. should take around 30-40 seconds on broil for the breadcrumbs to be nice and toasty. enjoy!

The scallops were perfect, tender and tasty.  Next time I'll use less bread crumbs and less butter.  I discovered after I made it that I didn't have a lemon, but I didn't miss it at all.

I didn't have parsley on hand, so I left it out. The garlic cloves I had were very large so I only used two instead of five.  If I had used five cloves it would have been too much.  This is definately a five star recipe and I'm looking forward to making it for company!

I really wanted to like this, but I thought it was not that great and my husband thought it was so-so.  I like garlic, but it was a bit much for me and I think there was too much of the bread crumb mixture.  I don't think that it was worth the expense. Sorry.

Delicious!  After reading reviews I made some changes.  I started with 21 jumbo scallops.  I used half the oil to marinate the scallops.it was plenty.   Added 1 T of minced garlic, a slight dusting of nutmeg, 3 grates of the nut.  Added a T of chopped sweet onion, juice of half a lemon and some Old Bay seasoning.  Tossed it and let it sit while I put 3 T of evoo in a small saucepan.  Heated it, added 2 T chopped sweet onion and 1 tsp minced garlic. Added some of the excess marinade, simmered about a minute.   Measured half a cup of plain breadcrumbs in a small dish, added to it 2 T grated Parmesan cheese and 1 and a half tsp of dried parsley.  Mixed that up, and dumped it into the warm oil mixture. Mixed thoroughly.  Arranged the scallops in a baking dish, poured the remaining marinade around them and put some of the breadcrumb mixture onto each scallop.  Baked as directed. They were fabulous.  Served with sweet corn.  Will make this again for sure!  Reading the reviews helps tweek recipes to make them better.

I used about 25 bay scallops in place of the sea scallops (which came to 1/2 lb) and felt the bread crumbs overwhelmed the scallop portion a bit.  I may have needed to compensate with more bay scallops to make up for this.  

Outside of substituting the type of scallops, I followed the recipe to a T and found it to be quite simple, and delicious.  Easy meal to prep and cook on a weeknight in a rush.  The most involved part is chopping the garlic and shallots.  Would most definitely make this again!

This was awesome!  We are visiting Maine and I wanted to try to cook something with the local caught seafood.  Gave this recipe a try and it did not disappoint!  Made exactly like the recipe called for and it was outstanding.  Made me look like I knew what I was doing (never cooked scallops before).  I guess I did make one change which was to use a pound of sea scallops instead of counting out 16.  Thanks!

Simple and delicious! Followed basic recipe, but didn't have shallots, so I sautéed finely minced red onion in the pan melting the butter. No nutmeg on hand and didn't miss it. Stirred in a couple of tablespoons of crumb mixture into scallops before covering with remainder of crumbs. Came out tender and juicy. Yum!!

Garlic and shallots are overwhelming and destroy the scallops. I thought I would like a lot of breadcrumbs but I was wrong.

One star. The scallops cooked perfectly but they were difficult to find due to their drowning in breadcrumbs and shallots.

I felt like the amount of breadcrumbs used was overkill, and my cooking time took about twice as long as it said for the scallops to be cooked. Other than that, they tasted great and were fairly easy to make!

Great recipe. I love that it is simple and the ingredients are readily available. I had to halve the recipe because only having half the amount of scallops and it still turned out great. I will be making it again in the future.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. It was not a hit with us. I would suggest searing the scallops first, add half the garlic, half the bread crumbs with 2 tbls melted butter instead of oil. Flavors were to powerful!

This was my first time making this dish for my family. Everyone loved it!!It was really easy and quick. I may try using bay scallops next time and some flavored bread brumbs and/or add some garlic and lemon...but this is definitely a keeper...as my kids would say.

I thought this recipe was good, but even with double the amount of all ingredients, and only two cloves of garlic, I found the garlic to be over powering. And I love  garlic and use it quite often in many other  dishes. But I will try this again with one clove and a splash or two of white wine.

The flavor of this dish was amazing... especially considering the "not so complex" ingredients. Next time, will serve with pasta mixed with fresh herbs and some sort of veggie. My husband "the foodie" raved!

Wow, these are truly awesome. I just made them and am in love. I had no shallots, so just sauted some vidalia onion in a little of the butter, then followed the directions. Dee-licious! I served them with some orzo mixed with baby peas, orange oil and seasonings. The orange oil brought out a little citrus-y flavor. I put the scallops right on top and the breadcrumb topping mixed in with the orzo. Yummy! Highly recommended.

Outstanding - minced 8 *large* cloves for this, so undoubtedly stronger than the original, but the smile on my wife's face was proof I'd made a good decision. This one goes in the "Heirloom" file - thanks for sharing!

My family didn't care for this recipe. I don't know if my scallops were just a lot smaller or what, but the dish was swimming in oil/butter and soggy bread crumbs. Also, way too much garlic. I might try again and reduce most ingredients.

Will say this was very good. 1st time making scallops ever so didn't really know what to expect never had them before either. This was simple and easy and tasted good to me. I did use seasoned bread crumbs so I didn't really add the other seasonings beside some garlic.

It was simple and tastey.  I used red onions instead os scallions. Also, I only use of fraction of the bread crumbs.  My daughter loved it. I am not a huge fan a scallops but loved it as well.

I didn't like this very much.  The topping overwhelmed the delicate taste of the scallops.  And the bread crumbs were so "bready"--thick, dry, and gummy.  I put the dish under the broiler to try to make the topping crispy, but it didn't work.  I don't think this is the best way to cook scallops.

I thought the scallop's flavor got lost in all the garlic.  I will use this topping with other things, though, like tilapia or some other bland fish.

The only variations I made to the recipes were that I added some parmesan cheese, increased the garlic an extra clove (since we love garlic), and used only 1 shallot. I think next time I would cut back on the bread crumbs to 1/2-3/4 C. Since I used frozen scallops that were quick thawed, I would probably cook it again on the longer side of the recipe. Overall, a tasty easy recipe that I would make again in a heartbeat!

This is good and easy to prepare.  I added shrimp and baked for 30 minutes.  The scallops were very tender.  I would suggest serving with a hearty vegetable to help balance the rich flavors.

I really like this recipie, but to add a different twist, I cut the scallops into halfs after they were cooked, and stuffed them into a mushroom cap and baked in the oven topped with mozzarella cheese...somewhat resembles the mushroom caps at the Olive Garden but with scallops instead of clams!

Absolutely one of the best Scallop recipes I have ever made. I will say you need to make more scallops than you planned for because they are so good they will disappear before you know it.

I used more breadcrumbs than called for and a little more garlic. Turned out to be just what I liked and we ate leftovers for 3 days!

I have never made scallops before so when I found scallops in the back of the freezer I knew I had to find a great recipe to go with them. Little did I know that this recipe packs a huge punch! Not only can a cook find all the ingrediants in an average kitchen but the recipe is simple to exicute. When the scallops came out I had one taste and just about died. They were SO good. I have yet to stop talking about the great scallops I made.

I will probably stick to pan-searing scallops or adding them to pasta. This just kind of covers up the scallop-ness. And I felt the garlic was too much.

This recipe was ok. My husband and I truly enjoy the delicious taste of scallops themselves and found the ingredients too overpowering. My husband actually said that he did not like this recipe at all, but I thought it was ok. I will not be making this again.

This dish was really good.  Due to other reviews, the only changes I made was to use 4T instead of 5T for the butter and I decreased the bread crumbs to 1/2 cup (used Italian Panko B/C) and 2T oil vs. 4T.  Will make again. YUM.....

having made this a couple times, i must say that my favorite way was when i didn't have bread crumbs. i took a bag of croutons and smashed 'em with the back of a pan, and used that instead. a lot of the croutons still kept their shape, and so when they baked in the oven, they became little crunchy pieces of caramelized, sauce-soaking-up toast topping. you don't get that toasty numminess if you just use bread crumbs.

Yummy!  I made my own bread crumbs with sourdough and these were amazing!  Also, I didnt have shallots so I substituted yellow onion in place of the shallots.  Next time Ill be sure to use shallots and I think these will turn out perfect!

I gave this recipe a try because of all the good reviews, but there was just too much butter and oil in it for us - it was more like a 'baked stuffed' dish - really, really rich, and it left us with that greasy feeling. I would suggest cutting way back on the butter, oil, garlic and  bread crumbs to lighten it up. The scallops were just lost in all that 'stuffing'.

This is a very good scallop recipe.  One change that I made was I substituted the butter with olive oil as others have done.  I also added 2 tablespoons of dry white wine.  I found that I only needed 1/2 cup of breading to coat the scallops generously, so next time I will probably reduce the amount of bread crumbs and olive oil for the breading mix.

i kept pretty true to the recipe except i didn't have shallots so just used onion and forgot to put in the nutmeg. for me, this recipe was just too heavy and fattening. i found the buttery/oily bread crumb mixture to be overbearing and felt that it overshadowed the scallops. wanted to try it because it sounded quick and easy and i had all the ingredients. it was easy, but it just seemed like a waste of the scallops. my husband, who loves scallops, hardly touched them.

I thought this was a good, quick recipe!  I pared it down for one person, and it made a great dinner tonight!  I agree with others in that the sauce and crumb topping is what gives any flavor to the scallops, but was very tasty and the scallops were perfectly cooked.  Now, I may need to figure out the best way to introduce just a little bacon to this recipe and it will be perfect!!  Thanks for sharing!  P

Very rich but delicious and it paired perfectly with the recommended wine.  I made this with a side salad & roasted asparagus.  Instead of chopping the garlic - I finely crushed it using a pestle & mortar to bring out the natural juice/flavor making it more pronounced & flavorful(I always do this instead of using chopped garlic).  Although I measured out 1 cup of crumbs, I agree with everyone else that says it's too much... I used only enough to fully cover the scallops (even though the extra tastes awesome with the juices)   I also increased the temp to 475 and broiled for the last 3 - 5 mins to get it to crust the way I wanted. Overall a great dish.. I loved it.

Truly awesome, & truly quick.  No complaints.  My cooking time, in a glass casserole, at 425 degrees, was 15 minutes.  Scallops came out fall-apart tender.  No problem with bread crumbs (used real crumbs, not commercial brand).  Left out the nutmeg, with no detrimental effect on flavor.  Truly awesome, & truly quick.

This was a wonderful recipe and simple to make.  The last 3 minutes I turned on the broiler to crisp up the breadcrumbs and also added a squeeze of lemon juice on top...forget just leaving that for garnish!  A keeper.

Really quick and easy to make. I made a white wine and tomato sauce to put over these, which helped balance out the power of the garlic. Without sauce, it might be a good idea to reduce the amount of garlic. The scallops baked very well. Definitely worth a try for those who are looking for a new way to cook scallops.

This was fantastic! I didn't have any bread crumbs, but I happened to have cornbread croutons. So, I smashed those up and used the croutons instead. It made for a great contrasting consistency between the smooth scallops and the grainier croutons. I will definitely make this again!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  However, I did have to bake the scallops covered for a while to cook them all the way through.  Next time, I may start off covering the casserole dish with foil, then broiling the top at the end to make it crispy.  May have had to do with the small size dish I used...scallops were kinda crowded.  Served with roasted asparagus and rice pilaf.

I followed some of the past reviewers and made a few changes 1. I used bay scallops - about 3/4 lb because there was just two of us, not to mention they were a whole lot cheaper. 2. Cut the breadcrumb stuff in half . . . at least! 3. Sauted the garlic/shallots in a little bit of butter and some white wine before I put them in with the scallops  Thanks everyone for your helpful tips!

So good.  I thought the breading was a little overkill.  I halved it and should have halved it again.  Delicious.  Will make it again.

I thought these turned out pretty well, but the bread crumbs ended up being a little overpowering.  The scallops themselves had a great flavor but everyone ended up scraping off most of the bread crumbs.

I was expecting to really love this recipe, but I think that overall I far prefer sauteed scallops. There wasnt enough flavorin the sauce, and think I would have preferred plain butter to the slight nutmeg taste. But the guests were happy with them, so that's what counts!

I tried this recipe for the first time over the weekend and it was delicious and very flavorful.  My friends and I really enjoyed it!  However- I did not even use the full amount of the bread crumbs mixture to cover the scallops and we still thought it was a little too heavy on the breadcrumbs.  I would recommend reducing the breadcrumbs.  Also, I used a bit of Old Bay seasoning in lieu of nutmeg.  But this was a great recipe overall!

My husband does not like seafood but when I made this he stole from everybody elses plate.  Was very easy and yummy.  Did take the suggestion to pour the left over butter over the top before baking.

This is a good recipe to expand from.  I added finely chopped pecans, Emeril essence and garlic powder to the bread crumbs.  I didn't use minced garlic or shallots.  My husband and I loved them this dish.  The scallops were better than any we have had in a restaurant.  It took a total of 25 minutes.

This dish was fine.  I decreased bread crumb topping like others suggested & agree it doesn't add much. I put under the broiler for five minutes to make it a little crunchier.  Probably won't make again because with the price of scallops, I want a little more than fine.

Simple, easy & delicious describes this dish. I would recommend using only 2 tbsp. of extra virgin olive oil & 1/2 cup of roasted garlic seasoned bread crumbs

This truly is an awesome Scallop dish.
  Loved the flavours, did not add the 5 cloves of garlic three were more than enough.
Will make this over and over again.
Changes would be a little white wine, a little more nutmeg.

Very easy recipes.  My first time making Scallops.  Made this with Jasmine rice and a side of Zuccini.  Added a splash of lemon juice to the entire dinner after it was plated...soo good!

I think there is a good base recipe here, but I felt there were some problems with this dish.  Frist, I would have doubled the garlic.  The amount of garlic called for was lost in the dish.  I also would have added the garlic to the bread crumbs OR just not used the bread crumbs.  I didn't think they added a thing to the dish and there was way to much.  If I did the crumbs it would be cutting them way back to 1/4 or 1/2 C and replacing the olive oil with butter and adding garlic salt and pepper.  It was easy and ready in a snap.  Thanks for sharing.

I've never cooked sea scallops before and this recipe looked good and easy to make. I must say that I was impressed at how delicious and simple it was. My family loved it. I will definitely make it again.

Great flavor!  I didn't use the parsley or the lemon.  I also think you could cut back the breadcrumbs to 3/4 cup.  I did use frozen scallops, but I used cold water to defrost and they weren't rubbery at all.  I would have liked some indicator of doneness besides the crumbs getting dark.  I'm more of a baker, so I need all the help I can get!

I just made these for dinner tonight, and all I can say is WOW!  Scallops have never been so easy and foolproof!  I halved the recipe, didn't use shallots or nutmeg and sprinkled with just a bit of the breadcrumb/olive oil mixture, and it still turned out fantastic.  This is definitely a dish that will impress...I can't wait for the opportunity to serve it to guests!

I was very hesitant to use the nutmeg, but it was the perfect compliment to the dish.  I made this for my husbands birthday dinner even though I don't care for scallops.  I am now a fan of scallops along with our two daughters.  It was delicious!

The scallops came out tender. I only left them in the oven for 9 minutes, 5 of which I put on broil. However, the breading was just way too much...it made them almost bitter.

Very easy to prepare.  I used half flavored and half plain breadcrumbs to add a little extra taste.  I think this recipe would be good with shrimp mixed in as a combo.  I added extra lemon to the scallops before they baked which gave it a nice extra flavor too.  Served with orzo and asparagus to finish out the meal.

These scallops are so tasty! The crispy texture was so light and perfect. My scallops weren't completely defrosted, so they took longer to bake (I make sure they are flaky, or else they taste "fishy" to me), but they still turned out fantastic. This would make a great Valentine's day meal.

I wasn't too hot on this recipe, but my guests liked it.  I thought the bread crumbs were an overload, needed just a handful.  I didn't even use 1/2 of what was called for.  But overall, a tasty dish.  I had planned on another recipe for scallops but after having a "sauce" issue this was my backup and it did the trick!

This was a very easy and good recipe. I liked the flavor combination. I did not have shallots, so I just left them out. I added a little fresh lemon juice to the breadcrumb mixture. Will repeat this one again.

These scallops lived up to their name.  I liked being able to put them in the oven and have the time to get everything else together.  I had a pound of scallops (10 large) for 2 people and with half the sauce and topping it made a very elegant meal.    This will definitely go in the 'do again' file.

My husband loves this dish! I didn't have shallots the first time, but it was still delicious. I add a little garlic powder to the butter mixture. I also add a few shakes of parmesean cheese to the bread crumbs. I made the recipe in a small ceramic baking dish with a single layer of scallops. The large sea scallops make it a great dish because each one has its own layer of crumb topping. Really fast, easy and delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!

The most tender and moist scallops I've ever had. Great delicate flavors. I used some dry french bread -- coursely crumbled -- for the bread crumbs. Served the dish with warm bread and brown butter broccoli...delicious and fast dinner!

Awesome is the correct title. I used the big frozen ones from Sam's and sliced them in half.  I used an oblong pyrex dish so they were evenly spaced.  Didn't have fresh parsly or lemon, but every bite was enjoyed by all present.

Delicious!  I halved the breadcrumbs (plain) and seasoned them with oregano, thyme, and parsley.  Sprinkled parmesan cheese on top before baking.  It's really important to rinse and dry the scallops before baking, and not to overcook them (they will be rubbery).

This recipe is true to it's name. It is Awesome!! Since I was only cooking for two,I halved the recipe and when we were finished eating it,we wished I hadn't! I squeezed a little lemon on the dish when it was finished baking and it was superb! I am looking forward to making it again-very soon.

04/30/07  Found this to be as good as described.  Used a little less breadcrumbs and added some Parmesan cheese.  Servings size was for 6 and the two of us ate most of it.

I gave it 5 stars but did change the recipe a bit.  I followed except did not add the breadcrumb topping.  After the time of cooking for the scallop mixture I added a drained can of asparagus, mixsed it all up, THAN added the crumb topping and baked it until it was browned, about 6 minutes.  It did not look that appealing when it came out but when served it on a small bed of rice and it was so light tasting!  Don't forget to use the extra sauce from the pan.  For me it was poured onto the rice.

Made for Valentine dinner... wow, it was very tasty. My husband really enjoyed this recipe. The only change I would make next time is to sauté the chopped shallots for a few minutes before combining them with the scallops. They were a little raw, which made their taste a little too strong.

Unfortunately, I was not impressed with this recipe. I've made other recipes that include a breadcrumb topping and I have always gotten a good results. The breadcrumbs were "gritty". I usually brown the breadcrumbs in olive oil before sprinkling them on top.

So also  from Maine, now living in FL...when a local fish market offered up Maine scallops, we were in on that! The only change I made was to add a 1/4 cup of white wine. The cook time is perfect for scallops, not raw, not overcooked, and we had some big ones!! Yummmm....

I've used this recipe as few times for what I call a seafood casserole using bay scallops and shrimp.  It's an excellent recipe and everyone loves it.  The only other thing I do different is add fresh squeezed lemon juice to the bread crumb mixture.

This dish was good however it needed a little something.  If you add a little shredded Swiss on top and sprinkle with paprika- it would make it a 5 star.  I don’t like Swiss but this gives the dish more taste.

Followed the recipe pretty closely. I used half of the garlic, and it was plenty. I also used butter in place of the olive oil.
These scallops were fantastic!

I made this recipe as a last minute thought.  Very easy prep  and clean up.  They were very tasty , even though I didn't have shallots on hand.
This will be one of my go to recipes.

What a wonderful recipe. Easy and the taste...marvelous. This is a keeper and will make again. This time because of the high temps in Lewes De we used the grill as an oven. My friend loved the smoky grilled overtones, I did not so much. So, next time I will use my toaster oven to cook at 425 degrees for the best scallops I've had in years. Thanks for the easy and marvelous recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly except only had one shallot on hand. Also, I didn't use all the bread crumbs - seemed a bit much. Paired it with spinach fettuccine and asparagus. It was so good!

Made this tonight  with fresh off of the boat scalllops. Delicious!,, We in the North East are very picky about our sea food. We like it fresh and without a lot of additions. I will cut down on the garlic next time....the crumbs and lemon  are perfect. It’s a keeper.

This was horrible.   
Bread crumbs served to act like a slightly softer yet fully annoying grit.  Scraping as much of everything off of the scallops as possible made them merely edible. 

Definitely not good eats.  The only fix was to pan-sear the rest of the scallops. _Those_ came out _amazing_!

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner, and found out after the fact, that I  had left the melted butter in the microwave.  Everyone still loved them...so if your cutting back on fats....the butter isnt necessary!

While not horrible I would change a few things. First the shallot and garlic were practically raw. Very chewy and strong tasting.  Cook them first in the butter either in the microwave or stove top and, while we are on it, that is way too much butter. Two to three tablespoons won't leave a greasy taste.

The shallots over powered everything, so I have to give the recipe 2 stars. If you cut the shallots, add red pepper flakes instead of nutmeg, and add more olive oil,  I’m sure it’s at least a 4.

This was so, so good! My only change would be to use about half of the bread crumbs next time. They overpowered the scallop flavor a little.

Delicious!!! Made this recipe as stated. Due to Gluten Free needs, I used plain gluten free bread crumbs and crumbled gluten free (ritz-like) crackers. GF bread and cracker crumbs can get gummy due to the rice in the bread crumbs. Next time I would only add 1/2 c. of GF cracker or bread crumbs and I want to spritz some lemon juice on the scallops after rinsing and drying them. Sorry, no photo!! We ate it right away : D

I'm a garlic lover but like other reviewers, the garlic and shallots overpowered the delicate scallops - not enough cooking time for the seasonings to mellow out. I would suggest sauteing them for a bit.  I reduced the butter to 3 Tbl, as well as the olive oil - just gave it a drizzle over the bread crumbs. Topping came out fine and crispy.

The measurements on the shallots and garlic are too high! I used one shallot and three cloves of garlic and it was overpowering. If I ever make this recipe again, I'm going to cook down the shallots and garlic first.

I didn't have any shallots so I didn't use. I also didn't use parsley.  I cut the recipe in half. Too many bread crumbs for me but not a problem The only problem I had was I cut all ingredients in half but forgot to cut the nutmeg in half.  Way to much as you know. I have been eating scallops all my life and although they were nutmeg heavy they were still good. I imagine they would be so much better with less.  I am giving this four stars because of my mistake with the nutmeg.

This was amazing!  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and measured 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg, and only used a half a cup of bread crumbs.  It made this delicious sauce, which I served over the scallops and brown rice.  I roasted Brussel sprouts to go with this dish...it was soo good!

I have made this Awesome Baked Scallops recipe numerous times and it's always delicious.  The secret is sautéing the onions and the shallots before you add them to the dish. I use Panko bread crumbs and add  Old Bay Seafood seasoning to the mix.  Great dish to serve for company.

I had to substitute some ingredients, so the poor outcome was mostly my fault, but also, the use of olive oil with the bread crumbs was weird on a mild seafoood like scallops. Use butter instead. And too many breadcrumbs! Also too much minced garlic, and I usually love garlic. The baking time wasn't long enough to soften and sweeten the garlic or even spread it's flavor into the liquids. Pan saute the garlic, shallots (or minced onion), and butter before adding it to the baking dish with the scallops.

This is a very good recipe.  I did make some changes:  I substituted two scallions for the shallots because that's what I had on hand.  I sprinkled a little Old Bay seasoning on top before I crushed a half sleeve of Ritz crackers to use in place of the bread crumbs.  After sprinkling the cracker crumbs over the scallops, I sprayed the top with butter cooking spray instead of olive oil.  It came out great!  One other suggestion:  Use one pound of sea scallops instead of a specific number since sea scallops vary in size.  I'll definitely make this again.

Five star flavor was with the following modifications:  (1) Add  juice of half a fresh lemon or lime to the scallop mix; (2)  substitute  packaged  dry turkey stuffing - ground into crumbs-
for ordinary bread crumbs.  Had no shallots so used two scallions; the recipe seems to forgive substitutions.  I experimented at home and it was so tasty it will be my next company dish.

We loved this recipe! The only change I made was to halved the bread crumbs and olive oil. One cup would be way too much. The butter, garlic and shallots made the taste. Couldn't taste the nutmeg.

This was the first time I attempted to make baked scallops and they turned out great!  I used Italian bread crumbs for a bit more flavor and sea salt, as previously recommended (only made sense).  Using freshly ground pepper also made the difference

So easy & delicious. I make this a few times monthly, usually a single serving so just cut recipe in half but only use just enough crumbs to cover the scallops. Always comes out great.

I really liked the crispy topping but it was bland.  Need more flavor/salt/something.. butter lemon?  I'd do it again but less bread crumb mixture and add a spice or something.  I did not taste the nutmeg at all.

Good recipe. Can tweak to personal taste.  I omitted nutmeg and onions (husband is a hater). I used fewer breadcrumbs and garlic but a little more olive oil.

Love it! A couple modifications, first seared in garlic butter until lightly browned (2minutes). Place scallops evenly spaced, into a glass casserole dish, and pour the pan contents over the scallops. Then, instead of breadcrumbs: buttered, crumbled Ritz Crackers sprinkled over the top, and a few shakes of Parmesan cheese. Bake at 425 for 4-7 minutes.....PERFECTION!!

It was very good. I was a little afraid of messing this up since sea scallops are so expensive. The crumbs could have been a little crisper so next time I'll broil a minute before hand. The scallops themselves were perfect! Very tasty and tender. This is a keeper.

This is the worst scallop recipe I have ever tried.  Too much garlic and shallot flavor and not sure if scallops were actually cooked enough.  Baked these in a 3 quart casserole dish and there was way too much breaded topping. We had to scrape off the breaded topping and sauté them quickly in melted butter to make sure they were cooked through and make them edible.  Will not try this recipe again.

I served this to ten people on Christmas. The scallops cooked perfectly and were not  overly buttery for my health conscience  friends.  I used a combination of bread crumbs and leftover  stuffing  bread for the top and it  was delicious.  Easy and quick to make.

I modified the recipe slightly.  I replaced salt, pepper, and nutmeg with a tsp and a half of old bay seasoning.  Then on the breadcrumbs I added 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.  OH YEAH!!!!!

I chose this recipe because it was very easy.  I never made scallops before.  My family and I did not care for the bread crumbs.  It masked the taste of the scallops.  I agree, the 11-14 minutes did not brown them enough,  I will try a different recipe next time.

By far the best baked scallops I have ever had! The only modifications I made were to add a little more garlic and I didn't use shallots!

I found this recipe to be terrible. The scallops were drowning, and the bread crumbs made it hard to find them. Huge disappointment.

I've made this recipe many times, and its always delicious. I have used traditional bread crumbs as well as panko. Both are good. I usually serve these over a cauliflower puree along with roasted asparagus.

5 stars! excellent! This recipe was so easy to make and so delicious we had it for both Christmas eve and New Year's. All the guests raved. I used a little less breadcrumbs and left out the nutmeg(as we didn't have any. That was in England, now I plan on making it at my daughters beach house in Wilmington, NC. I know it will be a hit!

Very good considering I used baby scallops. Didn't want to spring for the big ones. Did make allot of topping but did not have a problem getting it to brown. Made linguine and alfredo sauce to go with it. Very good dinner for just the two of us.

I put in 5 cloves of garlic, but used 36 scallops. Doubled everything except for the topping, which was pronounced at our table to be awesome. This is a definite keeper, both for ease and awesomeness :)

I loved this recipe! I have been searching for an easy and delicious way to prepare scallops.  To suit my husband's taste, I added a few pinches of Old Bay seasoning and reduced the amount of breadcumbs. I also used butter in place of olive oil.  Will be making this dish for years to come!

Really liked this quick recipe -- my husband is iffy on scallops but they were on sale and he knows I love them.  This preparation went over like gangbusters and he's agreed to have them every couple of months.  I used cippollini onions because I had them on hand -- I'm sure the shallots are great too.

This is an excellent recipe.  It is simple and quick and impresses every time.  I will often use crushed butter crackers mixed in with the bread crumbs and I also replace the nutmeg with Old Bay- just a personal preference.  This is one of those dishes that makes you look like an amazing cook - and all you have to do is follow the directions.

Just had a dinner party tonight. Served these scallops and they were a big hit! Easy to do and everyone loved them. Tender and delicious. Also made Pasta e Oilio and Marinated Pork Tenderloin. All complimented each other and with fresh green beans as veggie the plate looked beautiful.

This was delicious!  I used 2 or 3 shallots, a bit less butter, and Panko breadcrumbs.  Had lots of flat leaf parsley from the garden, so sprinkled that on generously. I'll definitely make them again.

These scallops were wonderful. I used less scallion but other than that followed the recipe perfectly and was so pleased. My dinner guests were pleased too. Make sure you use fresh scallops from a good market.

Fantastic, but didn't need the topping.  Will make again and again w/out the topping.  Had noodles w/white sauce on the side.  Of course, some people just put the scallops on top of the noodles/sauce and they were VERY happy people!

I made this recipe with scallops and it was good, but when I made it again with haddock it was so delicious.  For some reason it just enhanced the haddock much more than the scallops.  Very easy to throw together too.

I made this dish tonight just for me! My male friend wanted marinated pork tenderloin on the grill and I don't eat meat and he doesn't eat scallops...so...since there were scallops in the freezer that needed to be eaten I sacrificed myself (wink)... I have been eyeing your recipe in my recipe box for awhile)! Very easy and delicious. Followed it exactly except I cut the recipe in half and used crushed onion and garlic croutons since we didn't have any breadcrumbs-I used less than what was suggested due to my own preference. Thanks StylinCook! I've been wowed!

my husband doesn't even usually like scallops, but he loved this recipe.  I first made while on vacation & didn't have a lot of spices, etc. on hand--our whole group of friends loved it.

My Husband loved this recipe, but it was just OK for me.  I didnt have a shallot so I used an onion.  I thought it was a little "buttery" and that comes from someone who loves butter!

I'll make this dish again.  Very easy and tasty.  Since I made a change, I rated it as a 4 star recipe.  I used one large clove of garlic.  That was just enough to complement the scallops.  Five cloves would have been way too much.  I used crushed cracker crumbs since I didn't have any bread crumbs.  They are crunchier than bread crumbs and were the perfect topping.  This is an easy meal to make at the end of a work day.  So simple and tasty.

Absolutely one of the best scallop recipes that I have tried & so easy to prepare! The breading was great & you could skip the potato & serve with a salad; if your watching your carbs.  As always with scallops be very careful not to over-cook.

Good recipe, but my boyfriend and I both agreed that the breadcrumb topping overpowered the scallops (and I only used half the topping).  I may use this recipe to dress up chicken but won't use it again for scallops.

Pretty good but I think it needs a little more seasoning. I added some lemon juice and a splash of white wine. I was going to throw in a pinch of lemon pepper too but didn't (I will next time). Like other reviewers, I cut back on the breadcrumbs and also turned on the broiler for the last 3 or 4 minutes of cooking time. Served it with asparagus and boiled baby potatoes. Thanks!

Very, very good. I used one pound of bay scallops, but otherwise, I prepared this as written. Thought the amount of breadcrumbs was perfect. Served over thin spaghetti, and the butter/garlic/shallots mixture made a great sauce with the breadcrumbs. Cooked the scallops for about 11 minutes, and they came out well. Will make this again.

AWESOME indeed, however i took the advice of others and cut down the bread crumbs, Instead of nutmeg we used the market district seafood grinder...they were delicate and delicious, i think next time i may use only 3 or 4 tablespoons of butter...bravo

Sorry.... I think the recipe has potential but needs some major changes. The breading amount was huge!!! Not sure why. 1/4 cup of crumbs would have been sufficient. I also think the butter could be reduced by 2 tablespoons. Overall the flavor is pretty bland and could use some more spices to kick it up. It was very easy to make and scallops are a difficlut ingredient to get right. I may make it again and play with the recipe to try to perfect it... but I am not rushing out to buy more scallops.

Not bad - I ended up having a lot of the topping left over, so will have to cut that back next time.  It's something I'm going to have to tinker with if I make again. A good base.

This is great if you don't particularly like scallops.  It calls for way too many bread crumbs.  I couldn't taste the scallops.  If I ever do it again I will use a third or a fourth of the bread crumbs called for.

A little salty for my taste but a great way to have scallops.

Who would've thought that such an extremely simple recipe could pack in so much taste? These were divine.

Made this dish tonight as directed.  To many bread crumbs smothered the delicate taste of the scallops.  Next time I'll leave the bread crumbs out.

This was just okay. It wasn't what I was expecting. It was mushier than I thought.

It was okay but it was really overpowered by the garlic.  I love garlic so this really surprised me.  I reduced the breadcrumbs and olive oil by half and this was a good choice.  I think this would be a good way to prepare a plain white fish but was too much for the scallops

My Husband is one of the pickiest eaters ever, he likes very few recipes.  He absolutely LOVED this recipe! (I don't eat seafood).  He said, "It was one of the best Scallop dishes he's ever had!"  I didn't vary much from the recipe.  Only variations were some I had read from other reviews.  I used seasoned bread crumbs and used remaining "garlic marinade sauce" to put around the Scallops in the dish.  Like the recipe states, "SPRINKLE" bread crumbs on scallops.  Then took some of the remaining bread crumbs and put around scallops, took that from another review as well, worked perfect!  I still did not use all the bread crumbs, because I was afraid of it getting too "mushy".  One last thing, I  forget bread crumbs so the scallops did sit in the "garlic marinade" for about 15-20 min.  Don't know if that made a difference or not.  Easy to make and very good!!

I usually don't do this, but I did add just a couple things:  about 2 tsp. cajun seasoning and 1/3 cup cheese.  Delicious!  I served it over pasta.  Thank you!

I didn't care for this at all.  I love scallops, and had them fresh from Alaska.  The breading was mushy after baking.  I guess it tasted ok, but I won't use this recipe again.

I thought these were good, as did my husband.  Next time I probably will try seasoned bread crumbs.  I think it would be a good combo with shrimp too.

This was pretty good.  I thought that the flavors of the toppings kind of overwhelmed the flavor of the scallops.  I will definitely make it again-- my sons LOVE scallops-- but I'll reduce the amount of garlic and butter and bread crumbs.

I baked asparagus along side the scallops as suggested in the article, very tasty.  Next time I will decrease the amount of bread crumb mix though. Also don't use frozen scallops, I had to cook longer than suggested and some of them got rubbery.

This was an EXCELLENT recipe. I normally have not been a big scallops fan, but now, I absolutley love them. The only reason I did not give this recipe 5 stars is, as other reviewers have mentioned, the breadcrumbs, while excellent, should be halved. If you top this with just a bit of the breadcrumb mixture, you will be amazed at the simple yet delicious flavors of this recipe.

Not good at all.  I used half of the bread crumbs and husband still hated it... said it completely took away from the flavor of the scallops.  Next time, I'll just saute in a little garlic-butter.  It was worth a try.

bread crumbs a bit soggy and thick, but the scallops were wonderful!
