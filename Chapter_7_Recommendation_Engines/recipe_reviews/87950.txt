This was a big hit at our Christmas eve party - it was by far the most liked appetizer of the evening.  I had to make a few changes, for example, my Christmas budget didn't allow for paying $6 for the fresh herbs so I used fresh basil only which I'd bought for another recipe.  Also, I mxed the cheeses in with the tomatoes and let it all marinate for a few hours.  Lastly, I pre-toasted the bread so it didn't get soggy and then broiled the assembled bruschettas for about 3 or 4 minutes until the cheese just barely started to melt and the edges of the bread got nice and brown.  These are delicous and best of all even at room temp they are great.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I used fresh Italian bread instead of French bread only because that is what I happened to have in the house.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  I would certainly make it again!

I don't think I've had a better bruschetta! Originally, I went searching for a bruschetta recipe because my boyfriend had never tried it before. I made this and I was so impressed with it (so was he!) that I've made it numerous times for friends and family.  Everyone loves it!

Very good!  I've made it a few times and it is much better if you can let it sit overnight.  I also add an extra clove of garlic.

I needed something to make with my surplus of late season tomatoes for a gathering at my place and this caught my eye. I wish I could tell you how it was from personal experience. But my guests ate it up before I got to try any! It looked and smelled great and they were all raving about it! So I'll base my rating on their review!

it's a really good  basic bruschetta recipe, but it's a little bland. Sprinkling a little bit of black pepper over the cheese before baking would probably be a good addition

Made some changes because it is what I had on hand...used greek olives, chopped. Some were stuffed with feta cheese. Also had some roasted garlic cloves. Mixed all together and let sit in the fridge for about 6 hours. Mopped slices of french bread with olive oil and toasted in the oven for about 10 minutes before adding the topping. Then baked for 9 minutes. It was delicious. Served with spicey shrimp gumbo.

Had an Italian dinner night with a couple of high school kids and made this as an appetizer.  I used sun-dried tomatoes, diced, instead of fresh tomatoes.  Kids commented how delicious it was.  Of course, I tested the product myself, and it is a fabulous recipe!

I made this recipe as an appetizer for Thanksgiving. This is by far the best bruschetta I’ve ever tasted! One of my guests said, “This is restaurant quality.” I toasted by French bread a bit before added any ingredients and I used my mini-chopper to chop all the onions, garlic, and other spices. It was so easy to make and a great hit for the holiday. Will definitely be doing this recipe again for Christmas! Thanks so much for posting this one!

I liked the flavors , especially since I made the mixture ahead and let it sit to let them work together, but the feta cheese would not melt and the 1 tablespoon of olive oil drizzled over the top was not enough and even after adding more it was kind of dry and pretty messy to serve as the cheese just fell off. Next time I will use a shredded romano , maybe with a little shredded mozzarella mixed in.

Excellent Bruschetta and a big hit for Labor Day weekend.  Made according to recipe except I had no parsley and lightly toasted the bread. Made 24 thin slices.  A keeper.  Thanks!

This was awesome despite the small modification I had to make. The grocery store was out of sweet onions so I substituted the sweet onion for a yellow onion and sautéed the onion for a couple minutes. Delicious! Will definitely make again!

Good. Not the best I've had. I would saute the onions and let the ingredients sit in the fridge for at least an hour next time.

This was the most delicious bruschetta I have ever eaten!!! I made it for a party and everyone commented about how delish it was. The only thing I added was a little balsamic glaze drizzled on top at the end before putting it in the oven just because I had that on hand. Can't wait to have an excuse to make this again!

Little tip if you don't use parmesan. I kept waiting for the cheese to melt, until my boyfriend told me that feta doesn't melt. It got a bit dried out in my opinion but my sister showed up and said it was the best bruschetta shes ever had.

It was okay; not the best I've tasted. Followed the recipie exactly as stated, but for next time I would highly recommend buttering the bread slices and toasting it before putting all the ingredients on it.

Very delicious!  Perfect appetizer for my New Years Eve party.  I loved it so much I'm making another batch right now.  I used more garlic than the recipe calls for, but otherwise I follwed it exactly.  Best bruschetta I've ever had.

Color and texture was very nice, taste good but not great.  Also, this made the bread soggy in the middle.  Might depend on how juicy your tomatoes are, but I'd recommend putting this mixture into a strainer to take a lot of the liquid out.  Also might be a good idea to partially toast the bread before finishing it in the oven.

I found this recipe because I was trying to use up some feta and tomatoes before they went bad and it was fabulous!!! My husband and I ended up feasting on them!  I didn't use fresh herbs because I didn't have them on hand. I also didn't have sliced canned olives so I used Greek olives instead.

Delicious! I used "Jo's Rosemary Bread" from this site as the base, since I had made a loaf earlier in the week. This bruschetta was easy to make and had a lot of flavor. I took other reviewers' advice and let the tomato mixture marinate for a few hours. I will definitely make it again.

These were the hit of a recent dinner party.  I served the bruschetta as a side to grilled chicken and EVERYONE (even the picky kids) had seconds.

I served this at a party I was hosting and got rave reviews!  Good thing we all ate some though, this is heavy on the garlic.

Excellent!  The feta gives it just the right "twang"!

I made these for a light dinner for my husband & me.  We love them. Going to do a dinner for 75 people and these will be a wonderful appetizer!   Thanks Becca!

Excellent recipe Becca!  The only changes I made, switched onion for scallions and added 2 tsps of red wine vinegar. I brushed evoo on bread and Parmesan and toasted at 375 for about 10 minutes. Put mixture on top of bread added mozzarella and baked another 5 min. Could have made a meal of just that!!!

I made this as an international dish to have during the Rio De Janeiro Olympics opening ceremony. My whole family loved it! I toasted the bread for a minute before adding the tomato mixture, and I left out the parsley and added mozzerella, but it was still delicious. I would definitely make this again.

This recipe is both good and easy to prepare.   I made one minor change.   Instead of using diced fresh tomatoes as suggested, I sliced the tomatoes into eighths and then slow roasted them with thinly sliced garlic and olive oil in a 240F convection oven for three hours.   I assembled the bruschetta per the recipe omitting the garlic because the tomatoes were roasted with garlic and the fresh oregano because I did not have any.   The result was the best bruschetta that I have ever sampled.

Delicious!  I made this to accompany a light dish for supper.  The whole family loved it.  I drained some of the liquid before topping bread.  It came out perfect.  Thank you for sharing.

This is fabulous.  Fresh basil is a must, but I substituted dried for parsley and oregano.  I did bake a bit longer until the cheese melted and slightly browned.

Delicious!  I used olive bread from the bakery with a little bit of butter, and added fresh eggplant and a blend of 6 Italian cheeses!  I left out the basil, parsley, and feta.  My husband and I loved it!
