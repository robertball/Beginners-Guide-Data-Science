These are really delicious! And actually come together pretty quick too. I added extra jalapeno and salsa verde to the filling. For the sauce, I used extra salsa verde and only about 1/3 of a cup of sour cream (that was plenty for us). I made 14 enchiladas, and got them to all fit in a single 9 x 13" pan, and it took them about 35-40 minutes to bake. Would definitely make these again! Thank you for the recipe! Oh, and note to future self: 2 shredded chicken breasts is plenty of meat for this recipe!

While not traditional, this recipe is great. Most people use the verde sauce from the can which I love too but your sauce is really imaginative. We are a traditional Mexican family but I think I might sneak this recipe in. Yours is the first non traditional Mexican recipe that I have given 5 stars as written. Well done!

Great recipe! I made a half recipe and it turned out great! The only thing I changed is I added more green salsa to the green sauce- I just added a little at a time until it was the flavor I preferred.

I made one change.  I left out the chicken.  I don't prefer a lot of meat.  I thought it was a delicious vegetarian dish.

Delicious!  My family enjoyed it & has already requested that we make it again soon.  Very few leftovers -- I had halved the recipe, but won't make that mistake again! 

Overall, very simple to make.  We added a bit more cheese, but only because my teenagers always like extra.

No, I don't think I will make it unless something changes in that recipe.

Amazing. Made it twice. My Hispanic wife and kids love it (which says a lot!). I’m not sure about the quantity aspect, as any time I make this I never have enough filling (could be a “big” guy overstuffing his enchies... yo no se!

My family did not like this recipe.  The sauce was okay but the black olives didn't work well.  Not a keeper in this house.
