These turned out great ! Healthy and  carb-conscious. Fluffy and no weird "healthy food" bitter aftertaste...very convincing to the white flour and canola oil type of muffin maker.

I DID adjust the recipe only a wee bit, by using cardamom instead of the cinnamon, and placing the walnuts on top as a topping rather than in the batter. This is because I am serving a 1st grader who doesn't like walnuts. It didn't peel away very easily from the paper muffin liner; maybe next time I will hit the inside of the muffin papers with some coconut oil cooking spray. Anyway, highly recommended!

I made the recipe exactly as prescribed except I omitted the nuts and made 12 mini muffins instead of 6 bigger ones.  They were lighter than pictured and did not flatten out or rise, so they looked funny.  The smell and flavor was delicious, however, and they held together well.  I wished for more moisture--maybe next time I'll use a bigger banana and a little added liquid.
