It turned out on the dry side but pretty tasty. I will use twice the sauce next time

Made my own Alfredo sauce and I really liked this. The one thing I did not like was the bread crumb topping. Leave it out and you have 5 stars all the way!

My favorite macaroni and cheese recipe involves cream cheese milk cream and a lot of extra steps and clean up. I was surprised how much this easier version tastes like my "go to" recipe! I left out the Rotel since my daughter doesn't like that but definitely add the bread topping. My favorite is Trader Joes Garlic Croutons!
