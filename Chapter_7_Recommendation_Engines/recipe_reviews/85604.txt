I have to agree with Mamabear on this one. I don't pour my soup/milk mixture over the top when making a green bean casserole, so doing it with this recipe just didn't seem right. After cutting my onions I completely mixed them with the liquid and then layered. I hope the three star ratings do not deter anyone from making this, because with the additions of a few seasonings and using the chips it was absolutely delicious. A couple of modifications, and you've got at least a four star recipe. Thanks for a good start!

What's not to love, I thought -- onions, mushrooms and cheese.  I didn't have any potato chips and used Ritz crackers instead.  The dish tasted like, well, onions.  I love onions, but as a complete side dish, it seemed like it needed another flavor to balance it.  Perhaps the potato chips would have done that.  The soup mixture wasn't liquid enough to soak down through the layers and formed a hot layer of goo on top.  I'm interested enough to try this approach again with some tweaks.

I have been making this recipe for years and everytime I fix it folks want the recipe.  It easy and oh so good.  Plus it goes with about anything.  It is a great sidedish.

I made this, taking into account previous reviews. if you didn't know there were potato chips in this recipe, you'd never guess. after the onions were sliced, i mixed the soup and mlk in a separate bowl, then mixed it in with the onions. then i assembled it as 3 layers, 3X - onions/soup, then crushed lays plain chips, then cheese. (i had about 1 1/2cups chips) i sprinkled a generous amount of hot cayenne pepper, just before i put on the last layer of shredded cheese. it looked like too many onions for the casserole dish i used but when the onions cooked down it perfectly filled the dish. my daughter who will tolerate onions, but doesn't love them took the leftovers for lunch and she said it was better than the night before. we look forward to making this again. i think when i make it again i'll add some fresh rosemary

A wonderfull side dish! (I love onions!) I added a bit of red and green bell pepper for color. I didn't have potato chips so I used half tortilla chips and half leftover hush puppies crushed up; I think they added a good extra flavor.  Also didn't have enough cheddar so I used what I did have (cheddar, swiss, mozzerella).  Could probably use whatever cheese is at hand.
