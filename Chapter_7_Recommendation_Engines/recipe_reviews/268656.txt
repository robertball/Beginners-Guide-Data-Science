These were a huge hit at our New Year's Eve party.  I served them with extra carrots and celery for munching and extra buffalo sauce and ranch dressing for dipping.  Yum!  The only down side was the meat is very sticky, even with greased hands.  I had my daughter stand by with the cooking spray, so I didn't have to keep wiping off the mess just to respray. Totally worth the effort!

Did some of the changes that other reviewer suggest by put the carrot and celery in the meat and did more for the top.I also di more buffalo sauce because we like spicy . But I gave a 5 because I know without my little changes , would still be great.

These are terrific! I used blue cheese crumbles instead of feta to give a little extra flavor. I would recommend these for a crowd. Just double the recipe & enjoy the compliments you'll get.

I didn't have  any buffalo sauce, so I used hot sauce. Also, no feta cheese, so I used Parmesan and mozzarella instead. Still turned out great! My kids loved them! Really easy to make and very tasty!

I used bleu cheese instead of feta, and chopped up celery and carrots (finely) and added to meatballs.
SO GOOD
