I have had this recipe in my box for 3 years waiting to be made. I try to stick with the recipe as written the first time I make it, but I thought 5 cups of flour?  They were super crumbly, would not stick together to roll into logs, I pressed it into a pan and let it chill hoping that would help but alas the minute I tried to slice it the dough fell completely apart.
