These were great!  My whole family enjoyed them with a roast beef and salad for dinner.  Also, because the recipe makes so many, I froze a dozen of them to enjoy another day!  I love butternut squash any way you can make it, so this really hit the spot for me and this was the first time my six-year old actually enjoyed his squash.  He said, "Good job, Mommy!  You served me squash and I liked it!"  My only change was to substitute real brown sugar for the brown sugar replacement, in which case you need to double to amount of brown sugar to 1.5 cups.  Happy baking!  Thanks a lot for a great recipe!

I got a dozen regular sized muffins from this recipe. I've made these a number of times--changing ingredients from time to time. Here's a few tips that worked well--I made the squash like chunky mashed potatoes, added toasted pine nuts, used combo whole wheat flour/ soy flour for protein and fiber, switched out the splenda for 4 T agave syrup. Big thanks to the creators of this not too sweet, savory recipe

I followed the directions and they were very mushy. Not sure what happened.

These are SO good! I made them using regular sugar. There are super moist...almost like a baked pudding texture. Or at least that's what mine were like. But oh so yummy!

Just made these with a few changes due to what I had on hand. Instead of brown sugar substitute used honey, quinoa flakes instead of rolled oats. They didn't rise all that much but they taste great!! see picture, may want to use mini muffin tin next time.
