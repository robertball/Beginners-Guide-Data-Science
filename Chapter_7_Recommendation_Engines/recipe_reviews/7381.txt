I made this yesterday for my husband's birthday and he loved it.  Even though I cheated and used a pound cake mix, I still used this frosting recipe, cutting the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups.  The frosting was wonderful and would be great on any type of cake.

This is a moist and delicious cake. The recipe makes a big cake. If you love cherries you will love this cake.

Absolutely large, dense beautiful pound cake. I, also used butter flavored shortening. Other adjustments included increasing cherries to 1 1/4 c., substituting 1 1/2 t. vanilla and 1 t. almond extract in place of butternut extract. Since I wanted to display this cake I did not make the frosting. Will definately make again, although frosting would certainly be yummy it truly is not necessary. Watch cooking time, outside was tiny bit dry but everyone raved about taste, beauty and size.

This cake turned out excellent, moist, dense and yes it was a large cake so I took some to work and everyone loved it. I used Watkins doublem strength vanilla for the flavoring. Oh, and to the member who said it tasted like shortening and flour.... honey use butter flavored shortening, anyone who bakes much knows that!

Like another, I cheated and used a boxed pound cake mix.  Could not find butternut extract so I substituted 1 ts of vanilla and 1 ts of almond extract.  This was absolutely delicious!  Would make the original recipe if I needed a large number of servings.

I was not impressed, this cake tasted like flour and shortening with cherry pieces.  I love the idea of using maraschino cherries in a cake but this was disappointing.  Probably will not make again, it is a big cake most of which was wasted.

I have baked many pound cakes and this one is at the top. This is a very large cake with a heavy and moist texture. Makes a beautiful Valentine cake - just add a pinch of red food coloring paste to the icing along with a few well drained chopped cherries! BEAUTIFUL!!!

I can say anything but good good good! As a baker I usually test receipes out first to see how good they are.  I knew as soon as I read this receipe, it was going to be something wonderful!

This cake turned out very dry with very little flavor. I would not recommend it.

This was a really good cake. Like other reviewers noted, it's a really big cake. I made 2/3 the batter, put it in two 9x5 bread pans, and cooked it for 70 minutes. I didn't frost it and it was still really good.... I'd love to try the frosting next time!

Really good, really big cake!  I added slivered almonds to the cake and cherry juice to the frosting to thin it out a bit.  Instead of icing the sides, I let the frosting run over the sides.

I was really surprised by this cake. I had mixed feelings when I first started because one I had never made a pound cake without any butter at all in it before. Then I had to google replacements for butternut and found that by adding 1/3 tsp. butter flavoring, 1/3 tsp. vanilla ( i used vanilla bean paste, 1/3 tsp. almond extract.  I used butter flavor shortening, a full cup of cherries, and almond milk. This cake turned out great and my FH can not stop talking about it. It is going in the keeper file and making this for a upcoming holiday dinner.
