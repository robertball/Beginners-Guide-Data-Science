Very nice flavor.  My lemon pepper seasoning has salt in it so 3 Tablespoons along with the light soy sauce would be too much salt for us.  I just gently sprinkled each chop with lemon pepper seasoning and placed the chops in a freezer bag and allowed to marinate in the refrigerator all day.  Cooking to 145 is just perfect for tender juicy chops.

Just as the name implies, this is the best grilled pork chops.  They came out tasty and juicy.  I marinated them for 3 hours which imparted enough good flavor, but next time I may marinate it a little longer.  I also appreciate it when the cook adds the ideal internal temperature in their recipes to make it easier for the novice cook. Thanks for sharing!

These were fantastic!  I used a fry pan instead of a grill and marinaded them for about 2 hours and followed the recipe just as is and used Mrs. Dash lemon pepper seasoning and they were finger licking good chops!  Will use this marinade again for sure!!  Thank you!!

I made this recipe for my family.  They loved it.  The soy sauce and the lemon pepper seasoning was so good. I marinated the chops for 24 hours in the fridge and they took all of 7 minutes on the grill.  Highly recommend this recipe.  I give it 5 stars!

This was a wonderful recipe for grilled pork chops! My family said this is one for the recipe books! I did use 3 teaspoons of fresh minced garlic instead of 2. It was just perfect flavor. While marinading I flipped the chops about every half hour and spooned the marinade on top of the exposed side of meat and made sure the spices and garlic sat on the meat to really get in there. I also brushed the meat with the leftover marinade making sure to get the spices and garlic in the meat until the last couple flips. Adjust your grilling time depending on the thickness of your meat. Ours were really thick chops so it took much longer then the recipe stated. Using a digital meat thermometer set to 'Pork' Well Done' helps tremendously to make sure they are not only done (for safety reasons) but you get them off while they are still juicy and tender. These were so juicy and tender!!!! Thanks so much for sharing!  Carren

I marinated the pork for about 10hrs. I wondered how the combination of the flavors would taste together. Was disappointed when it, basically, only tasted like a meat marinated in soy sauce. I didn't taste any lemon pepper or garlic.Maybe it was because I didn't use "light" soy sauce. Won't make again.

Best grilled pork chops!!  I didn't have the lemon pepper seasoning so I substituted 1 Tbsp.lemon juice and 1/4 tsp. pepper.  I grilled the pork chops for 5 minutes on each side and they were done perfectly.  I will be making pork chops using this recipe again!!

Delicious and for the person who said 165 degrees, NO, the USAD RECOMMENDATION IS 145 for chops. Take them off at 135, let  them rest, and they will be fine. USDA inspected pork does not carry Trichinosis.

Loved the marinade.  I used toasted sesame oil instead of vegetable oil as I was making a sesame rice. Turned out great.

Pork chops were delicious.  I follow recipe to a T and baked on low 275 degrees for 2 hours.  Pork was falling off the bone!

Great basic marinade - have been using for years.  I really recommend bone-in pork chops, though.  So much more juicy and flavorful than boneless!  And I don't discard the marinade.  I brush it on while grilling.

I marinated theory chops and then baked them with a little extra marinade. They turned out great. I added a little of the juice from the pan to some brown rice, and it made a great side.

I am not a huge lover of pork, but we tried these and my whole family really liked them.  We use the thin boneless pork chops and they grill really fast.  

When I printed out my recipe it cut off the lemon pepper seasoning to two lines, so I accidentally read it as just lemon.  So I squirted a little lemon juice in them.  When I commented on my mistake, my husband said they were fantastic so keep doing it the way I did it.

I definitely notice they taste better the longer they marinade.  I have prepared them in the morning for that evening and while good, they are definitely better after 24 or more hours.  I think the absolute best we had them was when we prepared them for a camping trip on a sunday and ate them later in the week.   

We have them at least once a month.  Its one of the few things my picky kids will eat without complaining!

We've made this three times on the grill in the last month.  The marinade prep is really quick and because there's just the two of us I use the full marinade recipe for 4 chops.  Let it rest for about 3 hours in the fridge.  Have never grilled boneless pork because it gets so dry, but this was just perfect.  So flavorful and juicy.  Even the leftover meat was moist the next day.  Highly recommend.  Make sure you use the low sodium soy sauce and good quality lemon pepper.

These chops are terrific!  In fact, while we were eating I was asked to make them again. I didn't have lemon pepper, so I put the juice of a lemon in it and added a lot of ground black pepper.  Next time I go to the store I'm going to get the lemon pepper because I think it will taste even better.  I let them marinate for about 8 or 9 hours in a plastic storage bag, and kept turning it over about every hour or two. I didn't know what a teaspoon of garlic looked like, so I pressed four cloves in it.  You can really taste the garlic :)  My son grilled them, and they turned out perfectly. Very tender and fragrant. I made three chops - one for each of us.  Next time I'm going to double that so we have left overs {I THINK we'll have left overs}.  This would be good on a green salad. I'd like to try it with beef also. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...  well done!

Fantastic recipe!  I marinated them for about 3 hours and they were full of flavor, and super juicy.  We don't usually like pork leftovers, but these were just as tasty reheated for lunch the next day.

When I make pork chops this is my go to. I've made them about 5 or 6 times and they never disappoint. You know a recipe is good when you read the reviews and no one suggests any changes! Just make it as is and you are in for a treat. P.S. for all you reviewers out there that make all these changes when you a review a recipe... don't. If you don't like it the way it is write your own  recipe.

Tried the recipe on Father's Day. It was a hit! Marinated overnight and grilled next day. Chops were juicy, tender & so flavorful. A little salty with lemon-pepper seasoning & soy sauce, so could use less l.p. season.

I received this as the recipe of the day and thought it sounded good and boneless pork chops just happened to be on sale when I stopped in the grocery store an hour later, guess it was meant to be. It was excellent. I was a bit concerned about the amount of lemon pepper,but I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. Very juicy, light lemon flavor, glad I made enough for leftovers tomorrow!

Good but salty and I used low sodium soy, too.  We marinated them 24 hours - maybe that was it?  there's a lot of marinade.  I think it would do more than 8 porkies.

Unfortunately, we could not eat the chops.  They were extremely salty.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the soy sauce, and it was just too much for us. So whatever you do, do not use regular soy sauce. Not sure if light is any different, but I would suggest low sodium.

Delicious.  I was a little unsure of the 3 tbs of lemon pepper, but I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.   Everyone loved them,  even my very picky 12 year old.  This is my new favorite way to cook pork chops.  Will definitely be making these again.

These turned out so good! I also only had lemon pepper with salt in it so I just sprinkled some on each side before putting it in a bag with the other ingredients. I let it sit for a day in the fridge and occasionally turned the bag. grilled them and also grilled some onions, cooked corn on the cob. my husband and all 4 of my kids liked it! had leftovers for lunch the next day and it tasted great, didn't dry out by heating in the microwave:)

Ok I added about 50% more soy sauce plus 2 teaspoons of cumin and a teaspoon of salt. Then I mixed it in a resealable bag and let it set for about an hour and a half. Then marinaded it for about 2 hours.

Quite tasty. I tried to make this exactly as written, but my little local Asian market didn't have any "light soy sauce". I've never had any, and it seems I'd have to order it online - it's hard to get around here, I guess. I wound up using Aloha brand soy sauce (from Hawaii). Oh, and I used a countertop grill instead of an outdoor one, since it's winter. The first pork chops were marinated for just over 2 hours and were quite tasty - I usually find that marinades take a long time to "work" for me. Very nice - I'd never used lemon pepper in a marinade, and it was great here.

I prepared this recipe with the exact ingredients for 2 chops thus modified as directed.  While the chops were very tender, the taste was a bit bland.  I will not make this again.

Loved the flavor of this marinade. I also liked the fact that they only needed to marinade for two hours and the pork chops had lots of flavor. I added fresh garlic instead of the dried to enhance the garlic flavor but everything else was the same as the recipe. My family loved it!

Keeper! Used this last night and it was great. I substituted white wine for the water and as I watch sodium content I used Mrs Dash Lemon Pepper as suggested by others. Paired with http://allrecipes.com/recipe/quick-and-easy-grilled-potatoes/detail.aspx this was awesome. Like salad dressings, I plan to never buy a marinade again and this will be in my arsenal. Should be good for chicken also.

This really is THE best marinade for pork chops.   The blend of all the ingredients really, really pulls out the flavor of the meat.  I just made these for dinner and everyone commented on how good they were, even the kids.  All you heard was "mmmmm" and "oh my gosh..."  Thank you thank you for posting this recipe.  This couldn't have taken more than 5 minutes to prepare either.  I had regular soy sauce, not light.  It was superb.   I also used 1 tbs of garlic powder.  The marinade is amazing.   It's going into the regular rotation.   One quick note, I used sesame oil because it's what I had on hand.  The recipe still turned out amazing.  Don't be scared to substitute what you have on hand!

This is a great marinade! It's my go to now for grilled pork. I put it all together in a gallon freezer bag in the morning and by dinner time, it's perfect to put on the grill. I have some marinating right this second.

This is a go to for my boys, they love it.  I just substitute olive oil for vegetable oil and use Treader Joe's Reduced Sodium Soy Sauce. Usually try to marinate over night if I am planning ahead, but have only marinated for a few hours and still comes out great.

Really good recipe. I did make a few substitution since I wasn't too crazy about the lemon pepper seasoning I had in the pantry. Instead, I  added (bear with me, measurements approximate) 3 T's lemon juice, 2 teaspoons of honey, 2 teaspoons of black pepper, 1/2 t paprika, a crack of sea salt and a drip of hot sauce. Chops turned out great on the grill.

These are a-Mmmm-azing! I made these tonight for my family and followed the recipe exactly. My family and I loved them and will definitely be making them again. They had a wonderful flavor and grilled up tender and juicy.

These were excellent! They were a bit over done because I used bone in chops which were thin and I should have adjusted  the cooking time. Also, I forgot to tell my husband to discard the juice and he used it to brush on while they were cooking which I think gave them a flavor boost.

This was simple but with a lot if flavor.  I didn't have more than 90 minutes for it to marinade and it was still fantastic.

I ran out of soy sauce but had a few tablespoons of Teriyaki so added that to the marinade, I was out of lemon pepper, and used Olive Oil. It marinaded for 6hrs in the fridge. The chops came off the grill so tender we did not have to use knives. They were very tasty. I complimented the chops with a Quinoa Salad and grilled yellow squash. This recipe is a keeper.

Great flavor!  I had them in the marinade for just 2 hours and it was terrific.  Next time, I would reduce the lemon pepper to 2 tbls.

Absolutely fantastic marinade and cooking instructions! The soy sauce gives it a delicious teriyaki, but not too sweet or smokey, flavor. I'm typically not a fan of teriyaki in general, but these pork chops wow-ed not only me, but also my husband!

I hated pork chops, until I found this recipe. I make this once a week or so.

Recipe requires no tweaking. 
Though I may try substituting the soy sauce for coconut aminos.

I thought this would be way to much salt, but they tasted great!  Wife loved them!  Lean pork chops are one of the hardest meats not to dry out on the grill, but these turned out perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I made it just as the recipe say the first time and found it a little too lemony. Might be the lemon pepper I use, but I backed off to 2 TBS of lemon pepper, a little extra garlic, and about a TBS of honey. Good stuff!

A very good marinade that I will be trying for chicken this week. Just in case it wasn’t clear I think it is great for pork chops.

Very good,  I wouldn’t marinate it longer than 2 hours though, otherwise it would be too salty.

This recipe was easy and yummy. My husband commented on how delicious they were. I discovered this recipe because I wanted to use some pork chops I bought on sale and I wanted an easy meal to make after work. I followed the recipe exactly and marinated in a ziplock bag for 3 hours.

Very good simple recipe. I used white wine and a little Japanese sake instead of water, and I do recommend the change.

This was delicious! Marinated overnight because didnt have time to grill the same day and they were just the best. Not dry or tough, just delicious! I have the pickiest eater who hates trying new things and even he asked for seconds! Will use this recipe everytime.

I liked the concept of this recipe, but the marinade struck me as being potentially bland, thin, and possibly too salty with all the soy sauce.   I read other reviews and knowing my family's taste preferences (they like spicy foods), I decided to tweak the recipe a bit.  Instead of water, I used several glugs of olive oil; I reduced the soy sauce by about half and added a tablespoon of sriracha (a szechuan sauce would work well, too), and a few dashes of an Asian pepper blend.    For a better crust, I added a tablespoon of turbinado sugar.  The resulting marinade was thicker than the recipe's and yielded about half the amount of liquid but it adhered well to the pork.  I made sure to rub the marinade into the chops, too. The cut of pork chops I used were thin loin chops, so they grilled quickly (about 3 mins. per side on medium fire), and they emerged really juicy, tender, and bursting with flavor.  My family raved about them. So, 4 stars as written, and 5 with just a few tweaks to suit our tastes.

Great recipe.  I followed the recipe, only subbing 1 tsp lemon pepper Adobo and 1 tsp Mrs. Dash for the 3T lemon pepper. I only had time for a 1.5 hour marinade period.  I grilled the chops at ~425 for 6.5 minutes per side.  The chops were 1 1/4 inch thick. Turned out great. The marinade flavor was good and not overpowering, garlic flavor came through. This recipe could be used for chicken, too.

Followed the recipe to the letter and cooked them on my Treager grill. Cooked them to 140° and wrapped them in foil to get them in to the house. Perfectly done and very tasty.

I did not have lemon pepper so I added pepper and lemon juice. It was delicious. I have learned not to overcook pork. I grilled them for  only 3 minutes/side and they were juicy. Delicious!

Best pork chops ever!!  The key is grilling them for 4-5 minutes on the grill on medium heat.  Yummy!

My husband typically does not like pork chops in general. He says they are dry. So, because of the reviews I thought I would give this a try. They were the best pork chops I have ever eaten! Not kidding! My husband loved them too! So juicy and moist. I followed the recipe as written. i am making this again today! A must try!

Easy and good.  I will make again but maybe amp up the garlic and lemon pepper.    As another reviewer mentioned, they pretty much tasted like pork chops in soy sauce, didnt really taste the lemon pepper or garlic.

Didn't have lemon pepper seasoning so I substituted Montreal Steak seasoning.  Plan on making it again with the lemon pepper.

Still very good, I liked it but I suspect that the original recipe will be better.

Huge hit with the family!  Doubled the marinade as I had extra meat  to cook and marinated it for as long as I could (about an hour due to time constraints).  Came out juicy and flavorful that everyone enjoyed.

I have had pork chops that were a little tough so used this recipe and after marinating for 2 hours baked them in the sauce for about an hour at 350* and they were very flavoful and  .tender.  Filing this one under faves.

These were good. I used regular soy sauce and we didn't think they were too salty. My grand daughter loved them but I thought they were a little dry. I cooked them in a grill pan because it was snowing outside! Grilling on the regular grill might be better. I buy boneless pork loins when they are on sale and slice my own boneless chops. I put them in freezer bags with different marinades. Freezing really gets the marinades into the meat.

Great marinade just as it is. I may try more garlic just because I love garlic and I think I’ll try it on beef and chicken. Great, simple marinade that I’m sure to use again!

I generally don't like pork chops and this recipe made them taste awesome!  My husband says they are too spicy, so I have to not put in so much lemon pepper and garlic, but I like them the way the recipe is!

Great marinade!  I made 1/2 as I only had 2 bone-in chops.  I also used Penzey's minced garlic since I didn't have fresh.   Came off the grill tender and a ton of flavor!

Excellent! I used the lemon pepper as a rub to have more of it on the final product. Recipe is perfect.

Three kids ages 13 to 7 all dug in. Much better than shaking followed by baking. We'll have this many more times.

This is my go-to pork chop recipe. For the best flavor I use boneless chops of medium thickness, and marinate them for about 6 hours. I also use olive oil, as I’m not a huge fan of vegetable oil.

I marinated them all day while I was at work, then baked them at 350 degrees in the marinade until the internal temperature was 145 degrees.  I couldn't convince my mother that it was ok for pork to be a little pink in the middle, though, so we put it back in twice for short amounts of time.  After all that, it was still tender and tasty, but there was too much lemon pepper for our tastes - perhaps the brand I used?  I think it's the first time I've made pork chops that weren't dry, so this is a keeper and I will definitely make it again - flavors can always be adjusted.  Thanks for sharing!

Once again I'm a fan of Allrecipes ingredient search function. I had an old container of lemon pepper seasoning in the cupboard and found this easy recipe for using it. I made the marinade in the morning and let it sit for the flavors to blend until after lunch. I put the chops in the marinade at around 1:00 and left them in until 7:00 - so about 6 hours. I broiled the chops until just done - delicious!

Fantastic recipe for a marinade and a sauce. If you run out of lemon pepper seasoning just add fresh lemon juice and ground black pepper. If you don’t want lemon pepper at all substitute ginger, fresh or ground. I also double the recipe and use half as a marinade and half as a gravy/sauce. That was by far the BEST DECISION. My kids devoured this and they eat the four major food groups (chicken nuggets, pizza, ketchup and hot dogs). For the sauce, definitely use ginger and only 1-2 tsps of lemon pepper.  Add a tablespoon of corn starch to the cold liquid and whisk. Pour 3/4 of the sauce into a saucepan, simmer and whisk.  If it’s not thick enough, add more cornstarch (a tsp at a time) to the cold liquid whisking continually. Once it’s smooth, add to the saucepan and simmer. Continue whisking until you get that perfect gravy like consistency.  It’s going to be very acidic so add some brown sugar at 1/4 cup at a time until you get that perfect balance of sweet, sour, savory and salty.  If you like a little heat, add a few drops of Sriracha but keep it light handed so you can taste all of the flavor profiles. We made mashed potatoes and green beans and it was pretty close to perfect meal! Enjoy!!!

Used Yoshida Cooking sauce (a soy mix sauce from Costco) & 2 teaspoons chopped garlic. Marinated 1 1/2 hours. Grilled on Weber 5 minutes each side. Outstanding

I changed the vegetable oil to olive oil, and the lemon pepper  seasoning to real lemon and ground pepper. This was delicious, and I can see it being so tasty on any meat or fish!

Delicious! I used boneless pork chops and let it marinate for a few hours in the fridge. I didn’t have the full 1/3 of soya sauce so I topped that up with oyster sauce and it was delicious!

I usually read comments about a recipe I'm going to use but was in an unfortunate rush with this one.  Had I done so, I would've realized that theses can be on the salty side depending on what lemon pepper seasoning is used.  I don't ever use this seasoning and had no idea the first ingredient is SALT! :(  Needless to say, my grilled chops came out VERY VERY salty.  Thank god we don't have BP issues.  I guess I might try it again if I decide to buy a new unsalted variety, but not sure it's worth it.

Very simple to make and flavorful pork chops. Sometimes easy leads to one of the best pork chops. My husband couldn’t find the lemon pepper seasoning and used lemon juice and black pepper. Marinated for 2 hours and grilled until 145F, let rest, and served. Will try again with the lemon pepper seasoning as I would have liked some of that flavor to come through a bit more. Thanks for the recipe.

Saved and fav'd!  This will be my go-to recipe for pork on the grill.  I will say that the longer you can marinate the better, especially if the chops are thick.

This marinade is THE best.  The only addition I made was a Tablespoon of molasses to give it a little more depth.  I use it on both pork chops and chicken.  It is wonderful on both.  My daughter-n-law asked for the recipe because her three kids who are picky eaters loved it.  It leaves the chops tender and moist.

Very easy. I like to marinate as long as possible which seems to give it a bit more flavor. I also add more garlic than suggested but that's just my taste.

Excellent!  Didn't have a lot of time and only allowed the pork chops to marinade for 2 hours-still turned out great.  Used a thin cut, bone in pork chop.  Everyone loved it-even my picky eater that "hates" meat.  Served will grilled broccolini and grilled red bell peppers-easy clean up, great summer grill meal!

I used chicken broth in place of the water. Marinated for an hour, then brought to room temp for 20 minutes before grilling. Yum!

Excellent marinade.  Followed the directions with the exception of reducing the lemon pepper seasoning to 1/4 tsp. as mine has salt in it.  Also, marinaded the pork chops for 6 hours. Thank  you for sharing your recipe.

I made it exactly as the recipe said.   My husband loved it.   I felt it was salty, but  I had cooked some of the marinade and spooned some over my pork chop, that could be why mine seemed too salty.  I served it with parsley buttered potatoes and a portion of stir fried vegetables.  I gave it four stars because mine seemed too salty.  Next time I won’t spoon the marinade over the chop.  I will make it again.

My man was very happy with this marinade.  I didn’t add the water or as much lemon pepper.  I marinated it over a couple of nights because we went camping.  Turned out great.

By far the best pork chops ever! I let them marinade in the fridge for 8+ hours in all of these ingredients except for the lemon pepper seasoning, which I didn't have. Instead I used white pepper in the marinade and squeezed fresh lemon juice directly on the meat once it hit the grill. I will never cook my chops any other way! My kids and I give this recipe a solid TEN!

As directed, it's really heavy on the lemon pepper,  so I'll tweak it a little next time, but the pork chops turned out well. Two teen sons both went back for seconds, so it will definitely make it into the recipe box.

Was looking for a different way to make pork chops than our usual breaded version. I was able to prep it in just a few minutes and go back to hanging out with my family before grilling it. My family loved it! Good flavor and a healthy option.  Will definitely make again!

I've made this at least 20 times since I found this recipe and I think it's spectacular just as written.  I usually let it marinade overnight or 2 days if possible to increase the flavor.  A 2 hour marinade just doesn't infuse the flavor well enough, in my opinion.  I have even added the marinade and froze the chops in a Foodsaver bag for a few days and the flavor was wonderful.  We almost always grill the chops, but it works well baked too.

Delicious, a definite winner.  Didn't use water.  Just marinated on the counter with fresh garlic, soy sauce, lemon pepper and a little oil in a zip loc bag for about an hour.  As it warms it gets juicier. 
 Massaged into the meat a bit and grilled.  Hubby said the best pork chop he's ever had!

Only one slight change, marinated it overnight and just before grilling , added a few drops of liquid smoke. Plus, did not have a grill, so I made my own. Used 2 lasagna foil pans, a cookie sheet pan, heavy duty foil and the top part of a broiler pan.  
Line a lasagna pan with heavy duty foil, poke holes on sides of pan for air flow. Place onto cookie sheet and make sure you have it on a burn safe area.  (Of course, this was done outside) Place an even amount of charcoal in pan,  and light.   Line the broiler pan with foil,  slice where the holes would be. When coals are ready, Place on top of lasagna pan. Place pork chops on top.  Use the extra lasagna pan as a lid, again  poking some holes on top.  I cooked my chops for approx 20 minutes on each side.  DELICIOUS. plus my neighbors were impressed with my ingenuity. lol.

I just finished my Porkchop dinner tonight and this recipe is absolutely fantastic!  I didn’t have nor could I find any mesquite seasoning but I added some other seasoning that I had in its place.

Made this simple marinade due to a short time constraint. It was some of the best pork chops I've had! So good I decided to make them again the next night. This is definitely a keeper

I marinaded 24 hrs.  Very flavorful.  Little to salty, but very moist.  I will make them again trying to adjust the salt.

My husband grilled them over charcoal and thought they were great. Pork chops were very moist, even the next day.  I did add a bit more garlic.

Good flavor, was easy to make in a pinch and went with any side you could want.  Not giving it more stars because it was more of a easy no fuss type of recipe, not because there was anything wrong with it.  I am glad to have it in my easy meals file!

I used this recipe with fresh lemon thyme rather than lemon pepper (had none & don't like the extra sodium along with soy sauce). The chops were delicious, tender and flavorful.

06.20.17 ~ Wonderful pork chops!  The recipe is after all called 'Best Grilled Pork Chops'!  I cut the recipe down to two chops and let the marinade do its magic.  The chops soaked all day as I made up the marinade in the morning.   I like that the submitter not only told how long to grill on each side, but also the internal temp.   That made the grilling very easy on my husband.  We had this with grilled asparagus and grilled romaine salad.  Dinner was wonderful and clean up was a cinch since everything was cooked on the grill.  ~ I have since made this recipe an additional time and it came out perfect, again.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks, goodeats!

I made it; they loved it!  To speed up the marinade process, I put everything in a Ziploc bag; put ii  in the freezer and flipped the bag over every 10 minutes.  After 60 minutes it was ready.

Very good! Used with 6 large bone-in chops, gas grilled. The only thing I changed was using regular soy sauce, for us it wasn't too salty at all. Everything else was as directed and it turned out delicious. Will definitely be using this marinade again. ??

Made this with what we had on hand so we had some slight modifications.  I used the juice of a lemon and fresh fracked pepper instead of what the recipe called for.  The other modification was instead of soy sauce I used coconut aminos as we don't use soy sauce.

Very simple and tasty! I've tried to grill pork chops before and they always seem to come out dry. These were anything but. I marinated about 3 hours and grilled them 3 minutes on the first side and 4 minutes on the other.  I agree with other reviewers about checking the temperature with a quick read thermometer. I pulled them off right when they hit 140 degrees. 

Very tender and tasty. Definitely my go-to way to grill pork chops in the future!

Pops with flavor added a balsamic pineapple & apple chutney which paired nicely. The only thing I addd to the marinade was a little sriracha sauce...

I made this recipe exactly as it's listed.  Pork chops were juicy and had a mild flavor to them.  Great for kiddos as it's not overpowering.  Delicious!

This marinade gave the pork great flavor and was not too salty. I will try it on chicken too, I think. 
I marinaded it most of a day (8-9 hours) then grilled it on the BBQ grill.

These were easy to make. Used some thick Iowa chops. Did have much time in the marinade, so could have been more flavorful (not a fault of the recipe). I will probably make these again.

Very nice and easy recipe! I decided to whizz the mixture in the magic bullet to get a really smooth marinade and it worked very well. I put the while lot on a big zip lock bag and left it in the fridge all afternoon. The thing I don't like is the vegetable oil.... I dont like large quantities of it in any recipe but in this one it also caused flare-ups on the grill so I had to indirect grill the chops which threw my timing with the veg! Not a big deal when the result was so nice and it meant that the basting with the leftover mixture was better as well. Might try omitting or reducing the veg oil. Might try virgin olive oil in a smaller quantity but I'm worried it will be bitter..... Will let you know :)

Quick, simple, easy.  In order to reduce the amount of sodium, I cut the lemon pepper down to 1 tbl..  Let it marinate for 4 hours.  Used bone-in chops.   The end result was nice.

This is delicious. I actually forgot to add the oil and it was still wonderful! I used 4 bone in pork chops and ended marinating them for 3 days because our plans changed and then grilled them. Wonderful flavor!

Followed the recipe except for two steps.   Did not have a low sodium soy sauce on hand, so I used regular soy sauce.   Also marinated the pork chops overnight.    Result was very salty pork chops.   We did not discard them but diced and used them the following day in a pork stir fry dish.

Delicious recipe. I added diced onions and sauteed the garlic and onion in the oil it called for. I also added a half tablespoon of crushed red peppers to spice it up a bit. Just personal preference. All in all, very simple, yet delicious recipe!

Wonderful flavor! I used all ingredients in somewhat smaller portions, marinated less than an hour in a foil lined baking pan, turned twice during marinating, sprinkled the lemon pepper (McCormick) directly on the chops, and cooked in the "new wave"(indoor grill). I kept the chops in the marinade in the baking pan during cooking and turned the chops half way through. I believe a similar result would come from this method in the broiler. The chops were amazing! Very tender and flavorful. I also topped them with a mushroom soy sauce found on epicurious (soy, marsala, balsamic and cream of mushroom soup). All served over pasta. The dish was to die for!!!! I might try everything together in the Crock-Pot too. I will use this recipe again and again!!!

I loved how juicy and flavorful these pork chops were!  They were so easy and all stuff I had on hand.  I did not marinate them overnight, just did about 3 hours and they were still perfect!  I did as another reviewer recommended, and made sure my lemon pepper seasoning did not have salt in it.  It was still plenty salty, even for someone who likes salt.  Definitely recommend avoiding adding more salt due to the soy sauce.  You cannot go wrong with this marinade!

Very good marinade. Pork chops flavorful and juicy. I marinated 4 hrs as suggested in another review. Found that chops needed about 10 minutes total.

My family loves these pork chops! I have made them on multiple occasions. I sprinkle the lemon pepper directly onto both sides of the chops to make sure that it has the seasoning on it. I also let it set out at room temp for about 30 minutes before cooking. While cooking I drizzle the marinade over the chops

We all really liked it!  I marinated it for 2 days (forgot that I was going to make it two nights from the day that I put it together instead of the next night).  The pork did not get dry while cooking.  It was even moist after reheating the next day.  It had a bit of a strong lemon pepper taste, we all liked it but for some it may be too powerful and may need to use less.  I will definitely be making this again!

less is more with this marinade.  very simple and superb taste.  I prefer the 3-4 ingredient marinades vs the 15 step options.

Thanks Goodeats, Jen and Heather_Banzhaf,

Cheryl and I loved our dinner of Gilbert's Potatoes, Grilled Parmesan Asparagus and Best Grilled Pork Chops. I added garlic and shredded cheddar to the potatoes.  I grilled the asparagus for only ten minutes.  The pork chops were in the fabulous marinade for four hours.  As one of your suggested, I brushed the marinade on the  pork chops while grilling.   A huge success for this beginner.  Keep smiling, Jack

First time making this and it will be one of my favorites. Marinade is good. I took it out of the fridge 30 mins prior to let it get to room temperature before I cooked it. Got them up to 145degrees and they turned out wonderful.

Following nselph advice, I put the whole thing in a 350º oven for 50 minutes (turning halfway). It' heaven. My wife told me to quit my job and cook all day. Not a bad idea.

It was very good, but a little too salty. Next time, I will reduce the amount of soy sauce.

I was a bit disappointed in my  results, although my boyfriend says he thought it was good (4 stars). I did not have lemon pepper seasonings so used lemon zest and black pepper, otherwise I kept  to the recipe. It was bland. Maybe I needed to let it continue to marinade as the chops were thick and I only gave it about 3 hours.

Very good.  I made a mistake by not carefully measuring the soy sauce, so my chops were a bit salty.

Followed the recipe and it turned out way too salty for my taste with the soy sauce and lemon pepper having salt... I will try this again but buy unsalted lemon pepper and perhaps throw in something sweet like honey or brown sugar to sweeten it up a bit.

Super easy and really tasty marinade for the grill!  My hubby loved it both times I made it, which officially makes it a new favorite in our household! I added little extra garlic, though, as we are huge garlic fans :-)

Made exactly as posted and it turned out great!  Next time I will marinade for about 6 -8 hours rather than 2...I used low sodium soy and did not find them to be too salty and I am sensitive to salt.  Thanks for sharing!

We made this exactly as listed (except reducing quantities because there are only two of us). I only marinated for two hours and they were still wonderful. My husband cooked them perfectly on the grill. I am recommending  this recipe to anyone who will listen!

It was wonderful. The only thing is that I didn't have the lemon pepper seasoning so I used a little bit of lemon zest and juice and mostly black pepper to substitute. Also, I have a small tabletop grill so it took time to grill but other than that, it was good!

This will be my new grilled pork chop recipe.  Easy to marinate ahead, and the flavor was delicious.  The addition of lemon pepper is a must.  Mine turned out tender and flavorful.  Highly recommend you try it for summer grilling!

This was a hit for Mothers day! Mom, Sis and Wife all loved it. Although I didn't have lemon pepper but I did have lemons so I substituted and I grated a lemon peel (a good heaping tbsp) and half a tsp of fresh ground pepper following the rest of the recipe. Marinated 4 hours, turning over every half hour or so as reviewer recommended. Grilled with the bone towards the center of the burner for 3 minutes, rotated 30 degrees or so also as reviewer recommended then turned them over and drizzled the marinade on the chops as again recommended. Grilled for 2-1/2 and rotated as before then grilled 2 minutes then checked temperature. Turned out perfect.

This is the only recipe I will use for grilling my pork chops from now on!   It was sooo good!  The lemon pepper was the key.  Highly recommend!

I love this recipe and so did my guests!  Easy to do.  I mixed all the ingredients as shown, put them in a ziplock bag and marinated for two hours.  Turned out great.  Will make whenever we have pork chops.

Simple and delicious!   I subbed 1/2  tsp garlic for the minced garlic.  Before grilling them,  I sprinkled a little more lemon pepper on them.I used 1-inch thick pork chops (cut them from a pork loin) and cooked them over charcoal.   I only had time to marinate for about 2 -3 hours, and they were still incredibly tender and juicy.  My family loved them and asked that I make them again and often!

I keep looking for the a pork chop recipe that makes them tender enough for some of my family members.  This recipe came close. One grand child said it was too salty. I enjoyed it.

Very good. Out of necessity, I used sesame oil, so I sprinkled some sesame seed n grated orange peel to the mix. Started them on the stove and finished them in the oven. Delicious.

10/17 Update - followed recipe exactly but used it to slow cook boneless pork loin, awesome!

I will definitely make this again.  All ingredients are always in my pantry.  Very easy and delicious.  Used a whole loin, cut into chops and at the end of the meal 8 people made it disappear.  Not bad as the 3 yr. old twins were part of the 8.

I love this recipe - found it a few weeks ago for bone in pork chops. I didn't have lemon pepper, so I used lemon zest, pepper and regular soy sauce. Marinated a short time - it was delicious! Tonight I used the recipe again for boneless pork chops, which can be dry. I used the lemon zest and didn't marinate for that long a time - they were moist and delicious - everyone loved them. Don't think I will be using any other recipe for my grilled chops.

Excellent dish.  Hubby loved it and wanted seconds. I always add extra garlic but aside from that I made it as is. Easy to prep and easy to grill. Delicious meal.

Very nice recipe for grilled pork chops!  My thick chops marinated for 32 hours in the fridge.  My chops needed several minutes longer per side before they were cooked, but they still came out very moist and full of flavor.  Thanks for the recipe, goodeats!

This marinade is great on any meat!!! We have used it on chicken and lamb chops as well as pork. Added rosemary for the lamb! Imparts wonderful flavor and easily adapted with different spices for other meats!!!

Added a little basalmic vinegar & a few seasonings.  Let it marinade for 2 days.  Cooked the chops on charcoal.  No lie - these had to be the juiciest pork chops I have ever enjoyed.  Went back in the house twice to look at them under good lighting because I thought that they might not be done.  They were that tender/soft!  And believe me, I love chops and have cooked many in my 62 years.  Was totally blown away by how moist & tender this very simple marinade made the meat.

My family loved this recipe.  I used it with pork steaks - we thought it tasted better than a steak.  Pork steaks are also a bargain! I followed the recipe and let it marinate during the day and made it that evening.  I use a similar recipe to marinate beef steak and marinate it for a day or two and it is wonderful.

5-6 minutes per side for boneless pork chops was too much for my grill.  Next time more like 3-4 minutes per side. Otherwise tasted wonderful and I will definitely be keeping this as my go-to grilled pork recipe for the summer. Update: July 2016 - used bone in chops this week so decided to go with the 5 minutes per side. Really bad idea. So overdone I couldn't eat mine.  If you make this again, remember only 3 minutes per side on high grill.

Cooked them on the grill tonight.  Followed the recipe as is and they were delicious!  My daughter said she thought they were "a tad peppery"... I disagree!  Will definitely be using this recipe again!
