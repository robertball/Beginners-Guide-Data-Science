I tried this recipe for the first time,  it worked... I kinda thought it wouldn't work but have to say the breast meat was really moist!  I am going to try this on a Roast Chicken, which we have more than Turkey, my husband is not a Turkey fan.  Will come back and let you know how the chicken turns out..

Delicious! Sometimes, I add baby carrots as well! Doing it again this year. We also like rubbing on Tony Chachere's seasonings as well as parsley flakes.

I love this recipe.  The meat was so moist that it basically fell off.  Haven't found a better foundation for cooking a turkey, yet.

I turned the 12lb. bird upside down and flipped it twice more during cooking so i didnâ€™t need to baste. I used cooking bag. The apples disintegrated which kind of disappointed me.  Overall good recipe.
