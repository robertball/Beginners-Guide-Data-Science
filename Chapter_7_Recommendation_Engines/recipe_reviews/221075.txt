We must all have the same German grandma.  I have been eating this salad for years.  It is one of my favorites.  Grandma used chives instead of dill and she also smashed a clove of garlic and added it with the onions, cucumbers and salt.

This is the recipe that I have been looking for. My parents were stationed in Wiesbaden Germany years ago, and my mother who loves to cook befriended a local german woman and the soon exchanged recipes. THIS cucumber salad better known as Gurkensalat is the CLOSEST I have been able to come to recreating it.. THIS is a MOST LOVED dish.. I don't know if this is the exact way my mother and Petra made this wonderful dish, but if it isn't I couldn't tell. THANK you for posting this and taking me back to my days (years) in Germany with my mother and a wonderful lady named Petra. I STRONGLY ADVISE all who try this recipe to follow exactly DO NOT add or take away.. AND PLEASE let it chill overnight for best result. IF I could give more than 5 stars I WOULD.... I am huge fan of German food and this dish is spot on.

I enjoyed the flavor of the cucumbers very much ~ they were so different from most marinated cucumber salads I've tasted. However I found the texture to be oddly mushy. Followed the recipe to a T, squeezing out excess moisture from cukes and refrigerating overnight. Next day the onions were dismally limp 'strings' so much so that I just fished them all out. The cucmbers were just too mushy. I would really like to skip rating stars on this because it's probably unfair, given I haven't tasted German marinated cukes before and maybe this is how they're supposed to be.  However the AllRecipes system doesn't allow me to post comments without assigning stars, so trying my best to be fair I will rate this a 3 star recipe.

I am German, and this tastes very authentic. Thank you! Make sure to slice the cucumbers very thinly, for example, with a grater. If you want a German bean salad, all you have to do is substitute canned beans for the cucumbers, and add some onions. Tastes good, too.

Cucumber salads tend to be somewhat the same.  With this recipe I was interested in the impact the addition of paprika would have on the taste.  I made it per the instructions but left out the sugar because I don't like it sweet.  In spite of not adding the sugar it seemed the paprika did add some sweetness of its own. I enjoyed this immensely and would make it again.

The only adjustment this recipe and others with cucumbers and sour cream is:
Do Not Refrigerate Cucumbers in Sour Cream  Over Night.  Mix everything  together an hour or two before eating. Otherwise everything is mushy and ruined.

I liked this a lot!  I made it per the recipe and think it turned out pretty well.  After letting it marinate overnight I transferred it to a smaller bowl using a slotted spoon, so a lot of the runny liquid was left behind.  As another reviewer mentioned this was a bit sweet.  Next time I will reduce the sugar down to 1 1/2 TB.

This was a good basic recipe but was way sweeter than the gurkensalat my Bavarian mom would make.  Next time I'll cut back on the sugar.

This was really good.  There is a German restaurant close by that serves a salad similar to this.  I didn't alter the recipe at all.  I pressed the cucumbers with a paper towel after salting to remove the excess water and keep the dressing from thinning too much.

For Christmas dinner this year, I used my moms authentic German recipes, but she didn't have one for a cucumber salad. After reading the reviews on this one, it sounded like the most authentic, so I gave it a try and my family loved it. I've made other versions before, but never used sour cream or paprika in them.  I sliced the cukes very thin (on my mandolin), but might make them a tad thicker next time because they were a little limp, but not mushy. I loved how the onions turned out too. I hate raw onions, but because they were thin and marinated, they added great flavor without the harshness. I'm adding this as a permanent item to my German dinner menu.

This was so yummy. I honestly couldn't wait 8 hours to try it. It was amazing right after I fixed it. It might'vebeen better if I'd waited for the dukes and onions to soak up the flavor, but hey, they were still a bit crispy, which I really liked. ,
I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty. I do an experimental taste test after the salad rests for a couple of hours - just in case the amount of sugar and/or vinegar needs to be adjusted. Also, I mix the paprika into the salad, rather than garnish with it. I like the color it adds to the salad.

Delish! This is one of those dishes you can play around with as long as you stick to the basic proportions. Mine ended up sitting in the fridge for several days before eating and it was still crispy and creamy! The onions had completely mellowed out as well.

I used about half the paprika, so it wasn't quite so pink. I used dried onions, so I would get the flavor without my children complaining about me. Plus, some said the onions tended to get more soggy.  It was very good.

My grandparents were German and my grandmother used to make this salad with white vinegar, dill, sugar, a little water, salt and pepper and a tiny bit of vegetable oil.  It was delicious but this recipe is awesome.  From now on I will make this recipe, everyone loved it.

I made this with cucumbers from my garden and it was delicious!  I did not make any changes to the recipe, however I did double it since I made it for a potluck.  I would rate this as 4.5 stars because I wish I could have a better idea of how many cups of sliced cucumber "2 large" should yield.  I'm sure with a cucumber salad this doesn't need to be exact, but I just prefer to see recipes with ingredients written such as "2 cups sliced cucumber (about 2 large)." Long story short, reserve some of this awesome dressing on the side if you like thicker coverage and add it when ready.  For reference, mine turned out very tasty but I wish I had thicker dressing coverage for my personal taste. It may have been that my cuke/dressing ratio was off.  The cukes will continue to weep as this sits in the fridge.  Here is what I did: I picked my cucumbers at about 5-6 inches in length, and used six.  I sliced them on the next-to-thinnest setting on my mandolin, lightly salted them in layers, and let them sit for an hour before draining.  I rinsed them and patted them in layers of paper towels.  This is overkill but I did't want it too soupy and it was my first time making it.  I wouldn't go to these lengths again; I'd just let it sit salted for much longer then drain.  I reserved 1/2 cup of dressing just in case it souped-up which turned out to be a good idea.  The dressing is heavenly, and even with the salting and patting of cuke slices, it thinned out quite a bit as it sat overnight.  I

Very good and refreshing! I used white wine vinegar. My onions added their own touch of sweetness. I cut back on the paprika, but later noticed that by mistake I mixed it in instead of garnishing with it. Oh well, it was still good!

Love this recipe and I agree with shineah make sure to slice cucumber thinly. Also instead of white vinegar I've always used Heinz salad vinegar, my family likes the taste better than white vinegar.

It's pretty good, but WAY too much sugar.  I like it better with no sugar at all.  Add the sauce incrementally to the cukes -- not the other way around.  That way you don't end up with too much sauce and not enough cukes.

This dish was an absolute HIT at my German dinner party!  My brother-in-law, who doesn't like cucumber salads had thirds!  This salad is so fresh and light - wonderful any season!   I did what many recommended cut the sugar back to 1 Tablespoon and substituted apple vinegar since so many of my other dishes had white vinegar... and was perfect

Delicious cucumber salad! I would love to say this tastes like something my German grandma used to make, but she never made anything this good. ?? The onions add to the wonderful flavor, don't leave them out! I love the way you taste the sweetness first, then you get that vinegar kick.

It was too sweet for my taste. I ended up adding more sour cream and vinegar to cut the sweetness. I also used fresh dill, since I had it, which was good.

Ausgezeichnet! A very similar recipe has been used by my family for a couple of generations. Only major difference is they use white wine vinegar and omit the paprika.

Instead of using a platter I used a tea towel on the bottom and then used another towel on top when it was time to remove the excess moisture off the cucumbers and onions. Left this recipe exactly as it was. DH and I enjoyed, A thought it was ok, E and T did not like. No surprise.

I had started to make my what I thought was my moms old recipe and then looked here to finish it.  I started with a cut up cuke, 1 heaping Tbs miracle whip and then used this recipe without the sour cream and substituted vinegar with apple cider vinegar.  It was outstanding.  And thank you for this!!!

It was a little too sweet for my liking and not exactly how I remembered it from when I lived in Germany, nor how my Aunt Alice made it. I suppose I need to seek out her recipe from my cousins.  I think it would have been better with very little or no sugar.

Very good, refreshing salad. I did not make any substitutions,  but scallions would work as well. I also did cut down on the sugar adding just 1 tablespoon and there still was a sweet taste.

This is one of my favorite sides at a local German restaurant. This recipe taste just like theirs! I made it per the recipe except I used white balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar.

Easy peasy! Used fat-free Greek yogurt and Splenda in place is sour cream and sugar. Looks good. It is now marinating. Will have it for dinner.

Excellent, and I will use this recipe again and again.  Unbeknownst to me, the new lady friend of a friend who came to dinner I saw of German descent and it tasted just like her Oma’s!

Very good!  I will make it again.  I used a large English cucumber.  There was enough dressing that would have easily covered one and a half or two these cucumbers.

Only changes made was slightly less sugar and like other reviewers stated I forgot the paprika at first, but ultimately remembered. Very good, I was impressed!!! I made some pork schnitzel and home fries along with the gurkensalat and everything went together beautifully

It is so delicious! I used a Tbsp of fresh dill (chopped) in place of the tsp of dried and 1/2 tsp of salt plus 1/2 tsp of Nu-Salt, salt substitute to cut the sodium content. This combination worked just as well to flavor the cucumbers and pull out the excess water.

One of my favorite salads.  I made a few modifications, though:  don’t drain of the cucumber juice.  Use apple cider vinegar.  And use fresh dill.  Just like I used to have it at home!

I had to make this.  I haven't had this since I was a child.  Not that my Mother made it, but I do remember eating this and loving it.  So when I saw this I had to go all in.  I couldn't wait for the entire 8 hours, I dove in at 7.  It was midnight and I was in heaven.  All the memories came flooding back as the sweet, creamy sauce danced on my tongue.

I have been looking for this recipe for years (12 to be exact)! My husband and I, on our honeymoon in TN, had eaten lunch at a popular breakfast/lunch restaurant in the city. With out sandwiches, they served a small crock of a cucumber salad that I absolutely fell in love with. Since then I have been trying different recipes to recreate these, with no luck. Until this recipe. As soon as I tasted it, it brought me back to my honeymoon. This salad is absolutely delicious. I made no changes at all. My hubby agreed that these taste just like the ones from our honeymoon. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

Wonderful! 
After 54 years of making this from memory, I finally saw your recipe and learned how to get all that cucumber liquid out which always made my salad too liquid. Well, you have to drink that cucumber juice while finishing your salad! It is so good foryou!

This recipe is awesome. Only deviation I made was I added fresh dill from my garden and I omitted the paprika.
The most important thing to follow is the step to remove the water from the cucumber pieces and I also cut out the seeds.

My German grandmother made a similar dish but without the paprika.  I liked this version too.  We ate it after marinating for only 30- minutes and the cukes were still crispy which I liked a lot.  I don’t know how it could be much better.  Winner

A bit too sweet for my personal taste. So, next time I'd lower the sugar. This is a nice summer recipe for sure. My Ukrainian grandma used to make something similar. I've made this twice. The first was with white onion, the second time was with red onion and both are basically the same except for appearance. I made mine the day before and it wasn't soggy because I made sure to lay the cucumbers and onions out onto paper towel for 30 mins to lose some moisture. Then, I rolled them up in the paper towel and gave them a gentle squeeze to get any excess moisture out - if you don't, you'll get a watery salad the next day (you can drain it if you have to). I wouldn't cut the cucumber TOO thin or they'll end up floppy - just thinnish. Hehe! The paprika makes the dressing kind of orange which I don't prefer so I leave it out, it doesn't need it anyways - but you can use it if you like!

I added only half the sugar/parsley and used red wine vinegar. It was a huge hit at the BBQ!

This is much like the cucumber salad my mom made.  l used fresh herbs instead of dry straight from the Garden and  omitted the paprika.   Soooo good!

I would make it again; but add less sugar and not let it sit for more than an hour before I ate it. It continued to release water and made it too watery for my taste. I also added fresh thyme and basil and that was delicious!

My husband and I both love it.  I used mini-cucumbers (because they had been on sale) and subbed apple cider vinegar for white vinegar.   We are just eating it after a few hours marinating.  I bet the leftovers? will be even better tomorrow.  Sehr gut!

I really wanted to love these. I substituted chives for dill as I’m the only one in the house who cares for it. It was too creamy and felt slathered. If the flavor was more enhanced maybe I would t have minded the creaminess. I need more flavor so I sprinkled dill on after all and that didn’t give it the oomph I was looking for. This recipe looked so yummy, but I was left disappointed.

Turned out good.  I think it needs just a little more salt added to the dressing.  Otherwise was very good it taste like a salad that my mom made for us many years ago.

I made this for a party and it was commended! I left off the paprika as I didn't have any, no other ingredient changes.  I made the sour cream mixture and sliced the cucumbers a night in advance, but mixed it all together about an hour before the party to keep the cucumbers from becoming too soggy. Will make again!

We frequently eat sliced cucumber and vinegar as a quick and easy side. This takes a little more effort but is absolutely worth it. The sour cream lends a nice consistency and the subtle flavors are a big change-up from vinegar. A day or two in the fridge increases it's appeal. I slided the cuces about 1/8" thick, but I saw a recommendation to slice them very thin on a grater. I'm going to try that next time.

Followed exactly but it was a little too sweet. A couple sprinkles of white wine vinegar cured that. Went great with salmon tonite!

I grew up loving cucumber salad so tried this recipe for comparison.  And I'm even part German!  WAY TOO SWEET, and that's with just half the sugar called for.  Next time if I add sugar at all, maybe just half a teaspoon.

Thank you for the wonderful recipe. It was exactly what I was looking for. My changes were that I added some white vinegar  along with the salt before letting the cucumbers rest for 30 minutes, then drained.  I used fresh parsley and dill rather than dried and added a seeded and chopped tomato and one very small green pepper, finely sliced. Delicious! Hubby absolutely loved it and said to be sure and save the recipe.

This is a very good salad, and tasty, but not quite what I've had before in German restaurants. I only used half of the dressing as the water is drawn out of the cucumbers to make it a great dressing with a very good texture -- if I'd used all of it as recommended it would have been way too much.
The dill flavor is wonderful, the parsley compliments it, and the sour cream and salt are spot-on. I added 2 more tsp. white vinegar, and decreased the sugar by 2 tsp.to give it a little more tangy flavor and not so sweet. The paprika is something I could take or leave -- not usually in the recipes I've tried before. It is overall a tasty recipe, but not quite what the German ones are I've experienced before.

The only thing I didn't like about this recipe was it called for way to much sugar. Way to sweet for me, next time I will cut it in half. I also like using fresh dill & parsley, but dried works to.

This was a great side dish.  The only change i made was to use cilantro in place of dill which i did not have on hand.  I will definitely make it with Dill next time but the cilantro was fine.  I served with brats, roasted carrots and boiled potatoes.  Great dinner.  One piece of advice, make sure to salt and let cucumbers sit to draw moisture out.  I blotted several times with paper towels to absorb water but i guess i didnt get it all and so it got a little soupy after it sat in the fridge for a couple hours.  It was still great.

I made this last night and let it set for over 12 hours.  I followed the directions as written (aside from the sugar substitute) and this was exactly what I was hoping it would be, fantastic! I peeled the cukes and sliced them thinly with a mandolin and substituted the white sugar for splenda because I follow a low carb lifestyle and it was still beyond wonderful. I will definitely double the recipe next time because this was devoured so quickly by myself and my family.  I recommend this version of the recipe, hands down.  Thank you for posting this on AllRecipes!

Just like mom used to make! I used fresh cucumbers and purple onion from our garden, and only used 1/2 teaspoon of dill, and added 1/2 teaspoon chives. Make sure you let the favors meld overnight!

I will definitely be making this again. It is light and creamy. I made the salad following the recipe as published.

I made it exactly by the directions. Although it has potential, as is, it is very bland.  The cuke slices must be totally drained as much as possible. I did this and it was still very watery.  This may make a good starter but I would urge you to look at other recipes and tweak to your likeness.

I made it according  to the recipe. Very good and refreshing and another way to use the cucumbers from our garden. Easy peasy!

Was not a hit. I think the creaminess was too much for someone accustomed to the vinegar version.

Loved this. I made the mistake of stirring in the paprika.  Still tasted wonderful but presentation would have been prettier if I would have sprinkled on top.  Took to a party. Everyone loved it.

Wow my mom was German and I grew up on this!  So happy to find this recipe as it appears to be the one Mom used.  Really good and I agree that it is best if allowed to marinate a while.

I used baby cucumbers and green onions.  This had a weird texture to me.  I made this early in the day and at serving time, drained most of the liquid out before stirring.

This is kind of like what we serve at the German restaurant I work in.  I don't like the addition of paprika, and we let our cucumbers cure for quite a bit longer than half an hour.  I'll stick with our recipe.

I've never had this before, but made it for my daughter's class for their Germany Day event.  Overall, I don't think the kids liked it, but my husband and I enjoyed the leftovers.  I would definitely make this again in the summer when we have an abundance of cucumbers.

My review is just for the dressing (minus the parsley), which I cut down and used on a salad of lettuce and onion. It was the perfect thing to go with pork paprikash. Very tasty!
