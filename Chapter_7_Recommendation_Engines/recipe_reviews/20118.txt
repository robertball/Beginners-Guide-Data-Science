YUM!!!  I made these to take to a family whose daughter is recovering from surgery.  I'm not one who is afraid to try a new recipe on someone else! :)  These were just what I was looking for...sweet, but not too sweet, dense, hearty.  I made no changes other than using raw sugar (hate that white stuff!!).  I lined the pan w/foil and they lifted right out...made it easy to cut for transporting.  This one is definately a keeper.  May try half white/half whole wheat flour next time.  Thank you!

It took just a little longer than the recipe states to make them, but I think it will get easier as I keep making them.  And I LOVE to surprise people by having chocolate in a pumpkin bar recipe.  Tastes much better than it sounds!

In the future, I will put some kind of icing on them.  People are disappointed when you don't have the cream chese icing on pumpkin bars.

Overall, though, it is a good recipe and something worth making again!

I have to say, I was seriously doubting this recipe after I liked the batter after I mixed it all(choc chips included) and it was so bland I had wished I had left out the choc. chips and used cream cheese frosting.... Then I baked it for 35 min and oh my thank you for this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was awsome!! No need for frosting at all! And moist- you have no idea!! Keep it covered and it will stay that way. Excellent thanks for sharing!!

Really easy to make.  These were really good, my husband and kids really liked them.  Instead of chocolate chips, I used Craisins.  I'd make them again, a good alternative for snack time.
Thanks for the recipe.

Made them exactly how the recipe is written. Topped them w/cream cheese icing and it was yummi'licious. My daughter (13) said it reminded her of banana nut bread and she was glad that the pumpkin did not dominate the taste. Soon after we tried them (kids and I) we took some to my husband at work and shared w/his fellow Marines and they loved it. Will definitely make these again. thanks for sharing.

awesome!  the nuts and chocolate chips are NOT optional in this recipe.  It is what makes it so good.  Cream cheese frosting would have ruined them.

These are really good.  I did however, make some adjustments.  I added cloves to my recipe and left out the chocolate chips.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts (personal preference) and instead of mixing nuts into batter I spread them on top to give it a toasted flavor.  After baking I drizzled glaze icing on top. VERY, VERY GOOD.  In my oven it didn't take as long to cook so watch carefully.  I have made these twice now and everyone has loved them.  Will be making them again and again.

I've made these bars a few times now and top them with Cream Cheese Frosting II on this site.  I brought these to a party and everyone laughed how heavy the pan was!  They're so moist and the chocolate is a nice twist.

These were good!.. I liked the texture; they were not quite as firm as a bar and yet not as light as a cake... I had a 12 oz pkg.(1 1/2 cups) Ghirradeli semi-sweet chips and felt any more than that would have been too much!  For our personal taste they were slightly under sweet; we love sweets and since the chips are semi-sweet and the recipe doesn't have a lot of sugar, I would possibly switch to milk chocolate chips (mini's)!..

I did not have any chocolate chips to add to this recipe, but even without them, the bars were great!  Just used a simple vanilla glaze on them.  More of a cake consistency - maybe next time I'll add a bit more spice, as I personally like a little more -- thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great snack cake! The only changes I made to this recipe was cutting back on the nuts by 1 cup. Otherwise I followed it to a t. No need for icing either.

This recipe was fantasic.  Though I will say it is more like a cake than a bar.  I made it with a graham cracker crust and cream cheese icing.  Everyone loved it!

These were delicious and perfect for Canadian Thanksgiving! I've baked these three times. The first time I did not measure the pumpkin believing a large can must be 15oz and substituted spelt for 1/4 cup of the flour and they were very dense. The other times I followed the recipe exactly discovering I had added twice the pumpkin the first time and they were perfect! My guests raved and even took home a container after dinner!

I doubled this recipe.  I filled a large pampered chef large bar pan with batter(minus the nuts) and the rest in a small pampered chef bar pan (with pecans added to this pan).  The large pan went to my fifth graders class.  As I was walking out with it at the end of the day kids were begging me to have another! 
 
I was very unsure of taking them w/o frosting or even a dusting of powdered sugar, but they were a huge hit plain. I thought the smaller pan with nuts was even better!

This recipe was so easy to make and so well received! I didn't use the chocolate chips, only because I didn't have any, but will try it with them next time. There will Definitely be a next time.

I made this for a party and because I already had a bar cookie with chocolate in it, I omitted the chocolate chips in the pumpkin bar.  It was more like a bread than a cookie, but good nonetheless.  They tasted better the second day.  I'll make this again and use the chocolate chips next time.  Perhaps the sweetness of the chocolate will give it more of a cookie flavor.

Easy to make and everyone raved about it.  I don't care for cookies, bars or cakes myself so I have to depend on the ratings of others.  Everyone I served it to  says 5 STARS!!!  I didn't change one thing as I find that very rude unless you've made it following the recipe and THEN found a need to change it.  I thought the combo of chocolate chips with the pumpkin seemed off, but I was told it was a very nice surprise. Thanks for a great recipe!!!  I'm making it again this weekend for tailgating on Sunday!

I made this for a bake sale and it was perfect!  Followed the original recipe.  It was the first thing to sell out.  Cooked evenly. Rose nicely in the pan and could be cut without braking up.

Very good, quick and easy! I agree with another reviewer; the chocolate chips and nuts are not optional. That's what does make them so good. That being said, I did cut back on them both, using only a cup of each (My husband isn't big on chocolate). I did use sucanat, because I do not use white sugar for health reasons. And the baking time was right on at 35 minutes. These were very moist! Delish!

It was ok.  A little more cake like than I thought it would be.  My family didn't really eat it.  I will probably not make it again.

These are fantastic! Only thing I did different was use pecans instead of walnuts since I didn’t have any walnuts. I will absolutely make these again!

Trying to reduce my sugar intake so I only used 1/2 cup of white sugar. Then free formed a bit by adding some additional spices like nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice. Also, omitted the walnuts. Huge hit and easy enough for me to make on a work night or work morning. Thank you!

These are delish!  Just made them as per the recipe except-- I needed to make two recipes and didn't have quite enough chocolate chips or nuts-- I had about 2/3 of each.  Still they are so good they will be a new go to for me.  thank you for this recipe!

I have to say that I was disappointed with this recipe in the fact that there is nearly zero pumpkin flavor at all.  Conversely, there was an overwhelming amount of chocolate chips.  The whole thing made me wonder if there was any difference between the taste of these "pumpkin" bars and the classic Toll House pan bars?  My husband liked them, but I doubt if I would ever make these again.  I wanted something with a true pumpkin flavor with a side flavor of chocolate.

it was awesome!!! easy & tastes great. I'd suggest it witch cool whip on the side, goes great together! i did not put any walnuts. but i did do chocolate chips. i did half chocolate chips half plain and that was a great idea because people like different things. both were great though!!!

I make this recipe every fall for my family but without the walnuts (my kids don't care for them).  They are delicious!  So many pumpkin recipes can be overpowering with the variety and amounts of spices, but this recipe gets it just right.  The first time I made it I chose to try it without any kind of frosting (per the recipe) and was so pleased with how it turned out that I have yet to try topping them with anything because, frankly, they don't need it.  These also freeze beautifully--thaw at room temperature or, if you are impatient like me, defrost a bar in the microwave for about 20 seconds.

This is my 10th year making this recipe with yesterday being the latest and I still love, love, love it!  It's my go to recipe in the fall because it's so quick and easy to make, and the chocolate adds that extra something that you wouldn't think would.  TRY THESE, you will not be disappointed! :)

Can I give it 20 stars?! Amazing, amazing, amazing!! They are very thick and very rich in a 9x13 pan.  I may even try them on a cookie sheet or two to thin 'em out a bit.  Made it with the cream cheese frosting from this site....to die for.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

Delish. Used a simple glaze to sweeten up a bit. Used mini chips.

Great! I substituted white chocolate chips and left out the nuts. Very dense, moist cake. Got rave reviews from coworkers :)
