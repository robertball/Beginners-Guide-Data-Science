This cake was delicious! I didn't decorate it, I just made a plain almond cake and topped it with the glaze.  I added a little almond and vanilla extract to the glaze.  Since I read the review that said the cake was dry, I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I cooked it in a silcone bundt pan that I got for Christmas (the first time I used it), so it seemed to cook slower.  It needed the full hour but it browned nicely and was moist and delicious.  My guests loved it!!

Very pretty pound cake but it needed some more flavor.  Probably adding a teaspoon of salt and maybe some almond flavoring would help.

Pretty tasty. My sister (the taste tester) said it was more like cake not pound cake. but, what does she know. It was delish. Will make again, love the almond flavor!

This was okay. I Did not find the time required for forming marzipan leaves was justified on a simple pound cake. I will probably not make this again.

Delicious taste, but a little dry. I am going to try again possibly add sour cream or applesauce. If the changes work, I'll post them.

This cake was incredible!!!!  Everyone loved the marzipan holly leaves.  I even took a picture of it :)  I can see this being a holiday tradition for years to come.

I made this recipe without the marzipan, just as a simple pound cake.  It was really easy to put together, and I didn't cook it the full 60 minutes either.  Great for a fast pound cake!!

Sadly, I was disappointed. I think the 60 minute baking time was too long for me because my cake ended up very hard! The taste was good, and it was kind of moist in the very center, but otherwise it was pretty dull. I'll have to try again!

Very good but maybe a little heavy on the almond extract. 1 1/2 tsps. wopuld be enough.

Very Disappointed by the results. It's okay as a brittle but it definitely didn't have a "macaroon" consistency. It turned into a sesame snap after 6 minutes!

I haven't done the whole almond paste leaf thing, but this pound cake is usually a success on its own.  We like to have it with raspberry compote and whipped cream.  I usually add 1/2 a cup of sour cream to make it less dry.  I also bake it in 2 9 x 5 loaf pans.

I was looking for a recipe that used almond powder, and I found this; I replaced the almond extract by almond powder (I put a little less flour, about 1/4 cup less, and I put a quite large 1/4 cup of almond powder instead). It's yummy!! My family likes it a lot, but most especially my hubby who, however, doesn't have the biggest sweet tooth.

This was delicious! I think my boyfriend ate half of it in one sitting! I didn't have a bundt pan so I used two loaf pans and it turned out fine. So yummy!

I just made it as a pound cake and in a loaf pan, it was very good. The first time, it ran over and was a little too buttery, but the 2nd time it made 2 loaves and was perfect. I will definitely be making this again!

The first time I made these, I misread the instructions and added the almond paste into the batter. It was the creates mistake ever!! It tastes like an almond croissant in cake form.

Cake was very dry but flavor was good.  Next time I will use some sour cream to add moisture.

It has 5-star taste, but it takes way longer to bake than the recipe says it should.  Make it well ahead of time!

This cake was extremely dry.  The flavor was good (use "real" almond extract, not imitation). I didn't like the glaze - I would use something that's a little thicker and more obvious to see.
