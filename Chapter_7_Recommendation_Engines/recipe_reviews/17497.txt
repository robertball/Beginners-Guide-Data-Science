I really enjoyed the flavor of this soup. Only I added about a ton of vegetables because I have to have them in my tortilla soups. Really good!!

We just got back from Cancun and I made this for my husband - it was great!  The only change I would make would be less tomatoes.  Flavor was great.  I squeezed a whole lime into the soup and then sliced it up and put the slices into the soup also to cook.  Did I say it tasted great?

The lime juice really adds a great flavor to the soup.  I usually add extras of all the ingredients to make the soup more substantial and also add a can of corn for more vegetables.  Great base recipe for tortilla soup and very, very easy!!!
