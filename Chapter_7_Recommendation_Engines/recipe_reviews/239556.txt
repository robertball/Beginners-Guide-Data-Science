I made the recipe exactly as written and would not make these again. They were flat and crispy. After the 2 batchesI lowered the temperature to 360 and baked for the same amount of time. Those weren't quite as spread out but after they cooled they were thin and crispy too. If you like crispy cookies these are for you!
