I changed the recipe by using 1/2 cup of white sugar, 1/4 cup of spiced rum and added 2 cups mashed sweet potatoes (5 in total).  I also used regular white flour.  The rest I followed as instructed and WOW - what a hit!!!  I would DEFINITELY recommend this recipe for Thanksgiving you will NOT be disappointed!!!  The topping is sweet and crunchy!!!  Our family has been making it for the last 2 years and this year will be our 3rd...

I have made this recipe for a couple of years, with some adjustments.  Increase the amount of sweet potatos by 2 cups, cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, add 1/4 cup dark rum and 1/4 cup Grand Marnier.  We just love the flavor and texture of this recipe!

No one, and I mean no one, at Thanksgiving dinner had had a better sweet potato dish! I wonder if the people who think it was too sweet used canned, which is packed in syrup. Use 6 to 8 good sized sweet potatos, peel, quarter, and boil until tender. I used an electric beater to mash. Definately a keeper!

Excellent.  Doesn't have to be served for a holiday - I served it at dinner club last night and everyone raved.  I agree on the overpowering taste of rum though.  Next time will only do 1/4 cup. Also won't add melted butter to topping mixture either - was difficult to spread.  Omit melted butter for topping and you can sprinkle it on much easier.  Thanx for the recipe!!!

Excellent!  I used Capt. Morgan's spiced rum and reduced the amount to 1/4 cup.  This is a more sophisticated, complex tasting version of sweet potato casserole.  I will never make the marshmallow version again.  Thanks Casey for sharing this terrific recipe!

This is absolutely FANTASTIC.  I made it on Thanksgiving and now I am committed to forever bringing it for every holiday celebration.  It is very sweet and VERY heavy on the rum, so I'd cut back on the rum a little bit if you're not big on a rummy taste.  But my family ate the whole thing as is and couldn't get enough of it.  It's VERY good!  I keep kosher and made it with vanilla soymilk and margarine instead of butter, to make it dairy-free, and it was just as delicious!  (Leave the vanilla out if you use vanilla soymilk!)  This is definitely a 10-star recipe.  Thanks!

We have a favorite restaurant that makes an awesome sweet potato casserole and I thought I had found one that was close to it.  Well.... Now I know I hadn't found it until I tried this recipe!  This is an awesome recipe.  I made this last night to go with grilled salmon, broccoli, and a great bottle of chardonnay.  This is the best - the rum is what really gives this first prize!  The topping is quite good also.  My husband who thinks sweet potatoes are only "OK", ate 3 helpings of this and declared it fabulous!  It went especially well with the wine.  This recipe is my new favorite and will be on my holiday table!

I brought this to Thanksgiving dinner and got rave reviews from my nephew who is a picky eater. I made it without the rum substituted a cup of brown sugar for the white sugar. I also baked the  sweet potatoes in the microwave for about 12 minutes. I have been ordered to bring this to Christmas dinner - this recipe is a keeper!

Yummy Yum Yum...instead of rum I added amaretto and this gave the sweet potato a wonderful flavor. I also added a 1tsp of vanilla butternut extract to the batter also. This was Awesome and everyone loved it at a recent party and requested the recipe!

Great holiday recipe.  I chopped the pecans finely in a food processor and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of cinnamin to the topping for some extra holiday aroma and flavor.  Absolutely wonderful.  Thanks!!!

My sister brought this to Thanksgiving two years in a row and it was awesome! I needed a recipe last year for a Christmas party and it got rave reviews as the best dish. Everyone has already signed me up to bring this this year again!

This recipe tastes great!  However, I made one alteration to it and cut the amount of sugar in half.  It still tasted sweet, but not too sweet.

Absolutely delicious and very impressive. Definitely plan to use a baking dish that is at least a couple inches taller than the mixture when poured in, as the mixture and topping tend to bubble. Very tasty, though, and guests ask for it every year at Thanksgiving.

This was a little too sweet for my liking. I'd suggest cutting the sugar in half and reducing the rum to 1/4 cup. I think that the natural taste of sweet potatoes is just as nice as this dish, without all the extra calories. Makes a nice side dish, but is rather time-consuming. Next time I'll just steam and mash my sweet potatoes with a little milk for a healthier dish.

I made this recipe last year and my family loved it. I had to search for it this year because I didn't save it. I am so glad I found, I don't know what I would have done without it. When you are ready to say goodbye to the old marshmallow routine and ready for a more adult taste...try this recipe!!! KUDOS to the inventor!

Oh WOW!!!!  Very yummy!  I also used Myer's dark rum, and got a very intense rum flavor.  I would suggest either reducing the amount of rum, or using an amber or even light rum...just in case you think it might be too intense.  I left out the pecans since I don't care for them...and loved the brown sugar topping!  The best thing about this recipe is that it can be altered in so many ways to fit personal tastes!  Very easy to simply reduce the amount of sugar, brown sugar, rum, etc if needed.  All in all very good recipe!!

This is really wonderful - very rich and with great depth of flavor. Great for the holiday table - pretty in the serving dish and on the plate, and the recipe makes a lot! We are sweet potato casserole fans, and this one is the best I've tried.  Definitely will use it again. The rum (I used Meyer's dark rum) blends wonderfully with the other flavors. I used "real" sweet potatoes baked and mashed, but canned ones should be fine with this recipe and even easier!

This recipe was super easy to make.  I halved the sweet potato part, but kept the amount of topping the same.  I also broiled the casserole for 2 - 3 minutes to get  the topping extra crisp.  It was delicious.  I only gave it four stars because both my husband and I thought it lacked that "kick" of rum flavor.  You could barely taste it.  Could have been because of all the extra topping though.  Next time I make it I will keep the amound of rum the same for half the recipe.

After reading the reviews, I cut the sugar and rum in half.  It was perfect that way!  I've served this for the last two Thanksgivings and it has been a big hit.  My brother-in-law normally hates sweet potatoes, but he LOVED this dish!

Wow....either I missed the boat or the recipe was wrong.  I used the converter to make this dish for 25 people (because the 30 person conversion was not working properly).  When I made it, it seemed awfully soupy, but I figured it would set in oven.  Well, I ended up to what amounted to applesauce consistency.  It was incredibly too sweet and too much rum.  Due to all te great reviews I am sure it was the conversion and not the recipe itself.  Just a warning for anybody making larger quantities.

Outstanding!!!  I made this for an office Thanksgiving party and it was a BIG hit!  I used canned yams (drained and whipped in the food processor) and artificial rum flavoring because I couldn't find real rum.  The recipe is very easy, too.  Try this one!  You will NOT regret it!

YUM!! Huge success at Thanksgiving!
I don't like to drink rum, but it's to die for in this recipe. Some reviews state the rum was strong but I disagree. I followed the directions exactly and the taste was there but discreet. For example everyone asked what the flavoring was in the casserole that made it so good. I've tried other similar recipes but this one turned out the best. Easy and delicious.

Absolutely Awesome. I could live on this stuff. Was a real hit at our family Thanksgiving table. The rum flavor  was superb. I like one of the other readers used whole sweet potato's. Please do not used the cannned syrupy ones. Will keep this recipe forever, Thanks.

Not for those who actually LIKE sweet potatoes.  I thought this recipe sounded delicious and was pleased with the many wonderful reviews, so I made it for Thanksgiving last week.  It's still sitting in my frig with about 3 spoonfuls missing while the rest of the food is nearly gone.  I should have read more carefully all of the reviews that say things like "those who don't normally like sweet pototoes will love this" and "tastes more like a pie" --- it's a GREAT RECIPE for those who want something like that (just reduce the rum), but for those who like sweet potatoes and hearty flavorful healthy food, stick to a traditional recipe.  One plus - the struesel topping is great and I think in the future I may use that on my old recipe in place of marshmallows!

I like this dish. I think it is too sweet because of the sweetness of the rum combined with the cup of white sugar and cup of brown sugar.  I recommend reducing the white sugar to 1/2 cup, and use a dark rum.  The reason this dish is so good is the flavor of the dark rum.  Light or white rum will just add sweetness, and not as much flavor.

This was very good; I used spiced rum.  I also didn't have enough sweet potatoes so I used some butternut squash.  I did not melt the butter for the topping and it worked really well.  I will make this again.

This casserole was delicious.  I served it at Thanksgiving and found all my guests were asking for the recipe.  The rum adds a wonderful flavor.  I would highly recommend the recipe to anyone who is looking for a different way to prepare sweet potatoes.

I prepared this last year at Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  Even with a 16 year old picky teenager!   

I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg though for a little extra holiday flavor!

Looking forward to making it this year!

This recipe makes a pretty and delicious dish. I made the mashed sweet potatoes by baking them in the oven in syrup first making them very sweet so I cut the sugar in half. Oh it was yummy.  The flavor of the rum and the sweet potaoes go so well together.  Its a holiday recipe I will make again and again.

It's all a matter of preference of course…..but if you like sweet sweet potatoes, most likely you will enjoy this dish.  I like this dish a lot but my husband felt it was way too sweet.   He felt like he was eating dessert.  I used original spiced rum instead of dark rum.  I also used 1/2 cup sugar instead of a full cup.  Still it was very sweet.  When I make it next time, I will try using dark rum and cutting down the sugar to a few tablespoons in the sweet potatoes, since there is so much sugar in the topping.

I have made this recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas every year for the past 4 or 5 years and my family loves it! One time I put it in scooped out oranges. And ever since the year I forgot to get to the ABC store for rum, I have used rum extract. I modify the recipe to be dairy and gluten free by substituting soy milk and GF flour mix. And a few times when I was short on time I used canned sweet potatoes. Didn't really make much difference in the taste. The rum flavor is what elevates this recipe from ho-hum, been there done that. This is one of my "go to" recipes for holidays.

I've been making this for about 7 years now. Family insists! I always use Meyers Dark Rum and some extra sweet potatoes and follow the recipe otherwise. I usually half-bake the taters before adding the crumble topping so it doesn't dissolve so much with the moisture. This can be done the day before, making day of prep time much shorter. I just cut the brown sugar, nuts and flour with softened butter or mash it up in a zipper bag and leave it on the counter until ready to use, then pour on top of potatoes and gently spread around. YUM!!

When my husband and I tasted this we looked at each other and knew that I'd never have to search for ANY OTHER sweet potato casserole recipe ever. This is THE ONE.  I'm southern bred and I can say this one knocks all the other casseroles of the potluck (or turkey day) table.

WOW! This is a recipe that can be tailored to everyone.  Following others advise, I increased potatoes by 2+ cups, decreased sugar to 1/2c.  I tried different levels of rum, and ended up with 1/3 cup per recipe.  I like the rum, and with extra potatoes it wasn't too strong for me.  Biggest change was I didn't use any butter at all.  Eliminating butter in sweet potatoes and in topping as previously suggested saved 1300+ calories, and it was GREAT!  Thank you for such a yummy recipe.

This was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving dinner! I cut back on the rum slightly as I was afraid of overpowering the sweet potatoes. The pecan topping was fantastic! An outstanding dish - will definately make again next year!

Delicious; I think I used too many pecans though.  I will definitely make this again next Thanksgiving but I will cut back on the pecans some.  The rum really adds something special to the potatoes.

The pecan topping was great! I used Meyers's Dark Rum and thought 1/3 cup made it FAR too strong. I will use less rum next time I make these and I WILL make them again! Use canned sweet potatoes.

I tried the sweet potato recipe for a pot-luck dinner. I wouldn't consider myself too much of a cook, but this recipe was easy to follow and prepare and I looked pretty skilled with the outcome!  I am planning to also take it home for the holidays to impress my mom...

I've tried 3 or 4 different variations of this recipe and this one is our favorite!  I did use eggnog instead of milk since I had it on hand.
Wonderful!  My family says it should be classified as a dessert.

Fantastic!! This will definitely be one of my holiday potluck go-to's. I followed the recipe with only 2 minor changes: 1/2 cup of the rum (black spiced rum) and finely chopped walnuts instead of pecans. Everything fit perfectly into my 9" pie dish, so that's something to consider if you don't have an appropriately sized baking dish available.

Next go-round, I think I'll scale back the white sugar. The rum I used (Black Magic) was already pretty sweet, so I think I could get by on far less additional sugar.

I am the original author of this recipe. I came up with it when I was in college. I still make it every year...but my taste has become a little less on the sweet side since I was 20 :) I recommend mashing canned sweet potatoes/yams and make sure to drain all the syrup out. I usually use 2 large cans of Bruce's yams. I also recommend using 1/2 the amount of white sugar that the original recipe calls for.

So here's the deal with this recipe, unless you like the taste of alcohol which I do not , you won't enjoy this recipe. The rum is too over powering and literally kills the taste of the other ingredients. I had to throw it out, my family wouldn't even eat and usually will eat anything that I put in front of them.

I made a few subtle changes BUT I think they make this casserole even better. I used 4 fresh yams, not the canned kind, Using my Instant Pot, I steamed them then mashed them with butter and milk from the recipe. I think the can variety has a completely different taste and is too sweet, so I will never use them. I've also used true sweet potatoes, which are white and have a higher sugar content and its worked out very well.  Instead of dark rum I used Malibu rum with coconut liqueur.  You can barely taste the coconut, but I think the flavor brings out everything out in the dish.  I also omitted the pecans in the streusel topping.  My husband who hates sweet potato casseroles loved this one.  He's asked for it again, considering how adamant and picky he can get, that is a compliment!

We added 5 cups of sweet potatoes, doubled the milk, vanilla and put half a cup rum. It was so delicious!

This replaces all of my other sweet potato recipes.  Wow, what flavor.  I think the rum makes it (used a little less than the 1/3 cup).  Only change I made is I reduced the white sugar to 3/4 cup and brown sugar by a third because we like less sweet.  It was perfect.  It really sets up nicely and is so moist.  I used fresh sweet potatoes and boiled them.  They are so much better than canned.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a REQUIRED dish at all holiday dinners at my house. Only change is I only use brown sugar, and cut all sugar measurements in half, double the vanilla and the secret ingredient is to use Cruzan Black Strap rum. Rarely have any leftovers!

I make this recipe every year, and every year it's a hit.  I do make a few modifications, though.  Cut the sugar in half and use 1/4 cup of bourbon in place of rum.  Everyone always asks for the recipe and I've never thrown away any leftovers of this.  It's truly delicious!

DO NOT REDUCE THE RUM like the other reviews said!! I just made this and it was a perfect fit at Thanksgiving. Everyone raved about it. NEEDS the 1/3 cup of rum. Also, you HAVE to make sure you put the melted butter in the topping- someone wrote to delete it, but it has flour in it, so who wants to eat dried flour? Perfect the way it is- don't mess with it!

I am typically not a sweet potato eater, and I loved this cassarole!  It was so good and very flavorful--the rum gave it a great taste!  My only critique is that it was a little sweet and next time I make it I will reduce the sugar.  I will definitely be making this again for Thanksgiving!

I was looking for the mashed sweet potato recipe that uses marshmallows when I came across this one. I'm sooo glad I did.  I gave the recipe to my nephew and his mother helped him make it.  They used fresh sweet potatoes and Bacardi Dark rum.  Everyone loved this recipe, my nephew was very proud and promised to make it again.

I pulled up this recipe the day before Thanksgiving, and gave it a try. My in-laws are still calling me for the recipe! I thought it was much too sweet, but they thought it was fantastic! I made this in a 2Q round casserole and it still came out great...although I had to use the broiler to finish browning the top. Love the rum flavor (Mount Gay) and I used fresh, whole sweet potatoes.

This was a nice change.  I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Used 1/3 c. Myers dark rum and the rum flavor is pretty strong but we liked it.

I made this last year and it was a complete hit! If the rum is too strong for you, try substituting Bacardi Vanilla Rum. It has a great smooth flavor that blends in wonderfully.
