My boyfriend LOVES this recipe.  If the sauce is too greasy, I put the sauce in a container in the freezer while I'm shredding the beef.  The grease hardens on top, and you can skim it off.  Then you can return it to the slow cooker with the shredded beef.  Excellent!!!

A few tips for this great recipe.  I've been making it for a few years.  I actually sear my roast along with green peppers and onions.  I always prepare this a day ahead to let it refrigerate so I can remove the grease.  Another tip and this is for all crockpot recipes, unless you want thin gravy or sauce you need to allow additional time and cook for the last few hours on high without the lid.  I usually using the cooking time for low on all recipes with sauce.  I start out on high and as soon as the sauce is really hot I take the lid off the crock.  My family does not like a thin sauce.  This recipe freezes very well so I always triple the recipe.

Excellent. I made this just as indicated, except to avoid the fattiness people mentioned, I trimmed the excess fat off before cooking and then cooked it for a couple of hours without the sauce, drained the grease off, then added the sauce and finished cooking it for another 6 or 7 hours. Definately be making again.

Fantastic!  Don't like the way my crockpot cooks things so I put it in the oven... 350 for an hour, reduced heat to 225 and left it for 3 hours.  Shredded it, and put it back in for another hour.  Came out PERFECT!  Thanks!

Wow! This was soooo easy to make and absolutely delicious! I used a pork roast instead of a beef roast and it turned out fabulous! I shredded the meat and served it on toasted sesame seed buns with a dollop of coleslaw on top ~ YUMMY! The only thing I'd do different next time is cut the vinegar down to about 1/8 cup, as it had a stronger vinegar taste than I prefer, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing! My husband and I both loved this and I'll definitely be making it again real soon! Thanks for a truly delicious barbecue recipe, Corwynn! :)

I have made this dish using a beef chuck roast twice and a pork loin roast 3 times.  I personally like the pork better, but my family likes them both.  I serve on buns or over rice w/ a salad.  I usually reduce the vinegar just a bit for family preference.  Also, I trim the meat thorougly before cooking to eliminate fat in the BBQ sauce.  I tried the suggestion of making a second batch of BBQ sauce once, but found that I had trimmed the meat enough to eliminate most fat.  Plus, I liked the flavor of the BBQ sauce that had been cooking all day with the meat.  This dish is great for parties, family events, etc.  This recipe is a keeper!

My family loved this dish! Even my daughter who never tries anything liked it. Some other reviewers mentioned that the sauce had too much fat in it after cooking so long so I just cut my roast into chunks and cut off all the fat before I put it in the crock pot.  There was hardly any fat in the sauce when it was done, and it cut down on the cooking time.  It was great!

This recipe was great.  I used some BBQ sauce, some ketchup and no liquid smoke and it was fine.  If there's one piece of previous advice I would definitely say to take is to cut the meat into chunks and get rid of all the fat you can.  I did this and my sauce wasn't greasy at all.

I believe the ketchup mixture helped to keep the beef moist, however, I would not use this as a sauce to serve over the shredded meat, it ended up tasting like ketchup, and nothing else.  So, I discarded the ketchup mixture and then added a bottle of McClard's barbeque sauce and can of green chilies and it was wonderful!

Chuck roasts are well known to have a fair bit of fat.  If you cook the roast without all of the sauce you can remove the fat & oil, shred the meat and THEN add the sauce.  It tastes just as good, you don't get the black burned sauce ring around your crock pot & this way you cut down on the calories and don't bite into a big chunk of fat...yuck.

YUM!!!  I doubled the sauce and added it all to the pot.  This was very good.  You definitely need to shred the beef though.  I didn't feel like taking the time to do that but then found myself doing it anyway on my plate.  The sauce is excellent!  I'll definitely make this again.

This is EXCELLENT!! I browned the roast prior to placing in the crock pot. Also, I was pressed for time, so I cooked it on high for about 5 hours. Turned out perfectly moist and tender. I only added a few things that I thought would compliment it- 1 cup of diced sweet onion, 1 cup diced green pepper, 1/2 cup dark molasases, and about 2 tablespoons of beef boulion. One review stated the sauce was too thin, but after you shread the 4lbs of beef and add it back to the pot, turn it to high with the lid off for the final hour. This will help the sauce thicken. I served this on toasted buns, with Resturant style cole slaw II from this site. This was even better the next day!

This recipe is a winner! I did a few things differnt and it turned out perfect. First of all I didn't add any vinegar and I added a little more brown sugar because I do like a sweeter barbecue sauce. Second I just brushed the meat with the sauce and set the rest aside until the meat was done. Once the meat was done I drained off all the extra juice and shredded the meat and then added the rest of the sauce and it turned out perfect.Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is really outstanding.  I made a big pot of it for my fellow actors between performances, and they ate so much they could barely perform the next show!  I cooked the meat the day before, and as someone suggested, put the sauce in the refrigerator for awhile, which allowed the fat to harden on top.  It was then easily removed.  I found the sauce to be a little runny, plus I had mistakenly used mesquite flavored smoke instead of hickory, which I prefer.  So, I too made an extra batch of sauce, and ended up combining it with the sauce the meat was cooked in.  I put enough in the crock pot to coat the shredded meat, and served the rest on the side.  It was truly excellent.  I can't imagine throwing out the first batch of sauce, it had so much flavor from the meat.  It just needed a little boost.  Thanks!

This recipe works better if you cook the meat first, drain off the excess grease, shred the meat, then add the BBQ sauce and cook longer. Otherwise, the grease and meat juices mask the flavor of the BBQ sauce. The first time I made the sauce, it was absolutely delicious. The second time, it tasted too much like vinegar. The only difference was the second time I used a new bottle of Holland House brand vinegar, so maybe it depends on the brand and age of the vinegar. I would suggest using only half the amount of vinegar and adding more,  if needed, after everything is mixed together. I also increased the salt to 1 teaspoon and the pepper to over half a teaspoon because I thought it was a little bland.

This was fantastic!  I followed the directions for the most part.  I used a Beef round bottom roast and added 1 chopped onion and 1 diced green pepper which added lots of flavor.  I didn't have that smoked sause.  I also cut the meat into bite size cubes before I added it into the crock pot.  The cubes came out extremely tender and pulled apart as well.  If you take the lid off for the last two hours of cooking, you will find that the sause thickens and you don't need to make extra sause like others have said.  Mine turned out perfect.  I served this dish over rice for my children and my husband and I ate it on a Kieser roll.  Please try!

After shredding the beef I decided to try the sauce. It makes a great base, but I felt like it needed a little something more... I added chili powder, pepper, salt, onion powder and garlic salt. MMMMM!!!! Every one loved it! After shredding it I took the lid off and it helped the sauce to thicken.

Thought this was Delish!!! I made it to the "T".  I mean how else can you rate it otherwise. I didnt have any problem with to much sauce.  I cooked it for 10 hours on low in my crock and it had what I thought was perfect amount of sauce.  Yes, on the thin side, but once you started shreading the beef it started to blend in.  My daughter (7) who does not like to much beef (we made this for my son who does

Made this for tonights dinner, it was yummy! The entire family liked it. Some of us had it over rice, some had it on a bun and my youngest had it by itself. The sauce is a little greasy, but as my husband said, it's BBQ, it's supposed to be greasy. Actually, I fixed it by laying a couple slices of bread on top of the sauce when I had the meat out. It soaks the grease right up, then just toss 'em. I save the loaf heels for this.

Based on all the rave reviews for this recipe, I made it 2 days before my husbands b-day party. Because I needed a double amount I made one batch with beef and one with pork. I made the sauce as written but added about a cup of bottled BBQ sauce to each batch as I warmed the meat up in the crock pot the day of the party. What a success! Everyone loved BOTH versions. I couldn't get anyone to rate one meat better then the other!
My husband said it was the best BBQ sandwich he'd ever had, and my neighbor said he had cravings for it later that evening! It's a keeper!

So easy and delicious - the meat was tender and the sauce perfect!  I followed the suggestion of making a second batch of sauce - the original cooking sauce was much too greasy for me.  I simmered it on the stove about 15 minutes to thicken, before adding it back to the crockpot with the shredded beef.  Next time I will try this with a pork roast - yummmmmm!

Good base recipe. Definitely double the sauce. I also added far more seasonings than this called for (extra mustard, and little honey, cumin, and some Tabasco sauce). I also drained off the fat and added some corn starch at the end. 6-7 hours is plenty of time for this to cook.

Man-o-man was this good. It will knock your socks off. I scaled it down to serve six, used a 2 lb eye of round roast (no grease to worry about) and 1/2 cup chili sauce and 1/4 cup ketchup. Also, after I added the beef back to the crock, I also added another serving of the barbecue sauce so it would really juicy. I also made another batch of sauce and heated it on the stove to serve with the sandwich. Served it with corn, carrots and followed it up with watermelon for dessert. It was great. I highly recommend this recipe.

If you're really hard up for something barbecue-ish and different, give it a shot.  I didn't like it much and neither did my husband.  The sauce is hard to describe...it's sweet but has a kick.  I just did not like it, but I am a barbecue lover so to be fair maybe I should've known this wouldn't cut it for my family.

Awesome recipe!!  My 'BBQ Master' Husband went crazy for this recipe.  I had to substitute Peach balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar and I didn't add the liquid smoke, but did use a Hawaiian smoky seasoning salt we have.  It was delicious!!! :)

I skipped liquid smoke and replaced 3.5 LB bone-in pork shoulder for the chuck.  It still turns out great.  I will definitely make it again.

So easy and soooo good!! I have made this a few times already. I serve it on hoagie rolls, topped with coleslaw and the whole family loves it.  As others have suggested, I too trim the majority of the fat off the meat before I cook it and it comes out perfect. Thanks for sharing!

whew - i am stuffed! great recipe! the chuck roast i used was just over three pounds, but i followed the sauce recipe exactly. my husband said "if your going to review this recipe tell them i said it was kick*ss - really good". I cooked it on low for 8 hours, then when I returned the shredded beef back to the crock pot i cookd on medium for about 1/2 hour, uncovered. The meat was the most tender I have ever had. I barely had to poke with a fork for it to fall apart. I may experiment with differnt bbq sauce recipes next time to suit more to our personal tastes. I served with the "down home macaroni and cheese" recipe from this site.

Great recipe.  Take the advise regarding skimming the fat off the sauce.  I also added a packet of crushed hot peppers to spice it up a bit.  YUMMY!

Awesome!  It's gone every time I make it!  The cut of beef you choose will make a big difference. If you use a fatter cut, you should use a shallow spoon and spoon our all the oil before you shred the beef.  Otherwise, it will be too oily.  The sauce will be a bit runny, but add some cornstarch mixed with a bit of water, or flour or some other kind of thickener and it'll be just fine.  You may need to add some more spices at the end for your taste.  I use chili pepper flakes and a bit more sugar to round out the taste.

This is a wonderful Superbowl recipe! I always make it the day before and refrigerate it overnight so the fat will harden.  It's so easy, then, to scrape off the fat and heat it up in the same sauce.

This was delicious!!! The only changes I made was to reduce ketchup to one cup, and used 1/2 cup honey bbq sauce in lieu of the other 1/2 cup of ketchup. I left out the liquid smoke and that was that. It was perfect and we had leftovers as well :) My husband loved it and we both can't wait to make again. Great recipe!!

WOW!  I can see why this recipe got such rave reviews.  My family loved this so much.  It's so flavorful.  The first time I made it I didn't have any red wine vinegar so I used some red wine and a splash of vinegar to equal the amt needed and it still came out great but not so tangy.  Will make this again, and again.  Thanks so much Corwynn.

This is the best BBQ Beef recipe I have ever eaten. I put the ingredients in the crock pot and it was done in 10 hours.  After it had cooled enough to put in the refrigerator, I let it sit there overnight, then skimmed off the fat.

Wow - what a yummy BBQ sauce and great way to make an easy dinner.  I made this for the pumpkin carving party we had last night.  On Fri. evening I got out the Black Angus Chuck Roast and trimmed the fat then cubed it and placed it in the crock pot then poured over the sauce mixture.  I cooked in on low overnight for 12 hours.  Then on Sat. I used a spoon to shred the meat completely - it just easily fell apart and added a bit more garlic salt, pepper, poweder.  It cooked for a hour longer then I turned it off.  There was plenty of sauce but I only used 3 1/2 pounds of meat.  I actually laddled off some of the sauce and put in into a pouring dish so guests could use it to add more if they liked.  Just a hour before the party I turned the crock pot back on low and stirred the BBQ beef just to warm it up.  LOTS of rave review and no leftovers - definitely a great yummy dish!

This was really good!  My hard-to-please husband who believes that good things can only come from a Le Creuset pot or a Khuhn Pressure Cooker, even said in a surprised voice "Wow, Hon, this is really good."  The kids ate every bit too.  I used about 50% of the recipe sauce, 50% of a hickory smoke bottled BBQ sauce, and then added a bit more brown sugar.  I cut the meat into cubes, and cut out most of the fat, so there was no need to use "freshly made sauce" like some people suggested.  I will definitely make this again!

Great flavor!  Sear the meat and set it in the crock then saute some onions along with the garlic laying on top of the meat.  I enjoy adding a squirt or 2 of honey & reducing the brown sugar as well.  The best tip I can give is to shred the beef when ready then put it back in and leave the lid off your crock pot for about an hour.  The sauce will thicken beautifully & give the shredded meat an opportunity to soak up all that love.: )

Great recipe!!  The sauce is very tasty.  I followed the recipes ingredients to the T.  I did let the roast cook on slow for close to 11 hours and it turned out delicious!  I will make this over and over.  Thank you for the recipe!

I made this as per the recipe, EXCEPT that I cooked the roast for a few hours without the sauce so that I could eliminate the fat. That part worked great. I thought the sauce was a little to sweet, though, so will decrease the brown sugar next time. Maybe Heinz ketchup is sweet enough on its own?

Outstanding! Oh my gosh I couldn't get over how good this was... I switched it up slightly: I used fresh ground black pepper, sea salt & garlic powder to cover the meat. With the sauce, rather than using 1-1/2 c. ketchup, I used about 3/4 c. ketchup & a full cup of Kraft Original BBQ sauce (that's what I had in the fridge). Also, I didn't have any problem with the sauce being too thin - I attribute that to the use of the BBQ sauce... put the meat on toasted kaiser rolls with Garlic Parmesan potato wedges... a quick & super tasty summer meal - a definite keeper in my book!

This is an excellent recipe.  I really enjoyed it.  I know several other reviewers complained about ketchupy or vinegary tastes, I didn't find either taste over powering in mine, but I suspect that is a taste preference.  I do wish that there was more spice involved and when I make again I will increase the garlic power and probably add some hot sauce for kick.  As others suggested I put my sauce in the freezer while I shredded the meat and then just skimmed the fat off the top.  Everyone loved this and I will make it again for sure.  How much easier can you get?

This recipe was a hit at my house.  My 1 yr old couldn't get enough of it.  I ended up using Chuck Roast because that's all I had and it turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's the first time I've ever made barbeque.

This turned out great. The whole family loved it. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis. I used a 2 pound roast and I only had to cook it for 6 hours before it was falling apart. It needed more sauce, so I added some open pit thick and tangy barbecue sauce after it was done. It was yum yum good!

Excellent!  Will definitely use this recipe again.  Only suggestion would be to trim fat from meat before cooking, to make the sauce less greasy.

Very tasty!  However, it needed additional barbeque sauce after it finished cooking. What was still in the pot was great but there just wasn't enough of it.  It's important to cut up the roast into pieces and to remove as much of the fat as possible to make it easier to shred.

This was good, but the BBQ sauce was way too ketchupy. I added lots more garlic powder, some cayenne pepper, cumin, dry mustard, and black pepper to get it to a taste that I liked. It was still pretty ketchupy, but good.

When I made this recipe the barbecue sauce turned to water.  I ended up shredding the beef pouring out the watery sauce (lots of grease) and placing the shredded beer back in the crock-pot.  Then I made the barbecue sauce all over again.  I poured the sauce on the shredded beef.  Then I cooked the beef on high for 30 minutes.  The barbecued beef was delicious, but not to mention how much of the sauce I wasted the first time.  Next, time cook the beef for 8 to 10 hours without the sauce then put the sauce on after shredding the beef and cook for 30 minutes on high.

Very good Barbeque Beef.  Very easy.  I questioned the Red wine vinegar and the Dijon mustard, but followed the recipe to a "T" and my family thoroughly enjoyed it.  They even ate leftovers.  Thank you.

Great bbq!  Not too sweet, not too tangy, not too saucy.  I used london broirl and cooked it for over 10 hours and had none of the greasy issues noted by other reviewers.

I love this recipe. The sauce turns out perfect everytime as long as you cook for an hour uncovered. The liquid smoke is a matter of preference, if you want the sauce to have a more smokey flavor. I experimented with the amounts of brown sugar as I like a more tangy than sweet sauce. This is a family favorite and is a regular meal at my house.

Got great reviews on this recipe , made it for 30 people, no leftovers. I will say that  I went to my butcher for a trimmed chuck roast. ( I needed 8 lbs )I seared ALL sides with a generous  amount of salt pepper and garlic powder . After many hours on the slow cooker ( 12 for this size ) I placed most of the sauce in a container in the freezer to skim off the fat , if you get the chuck roast that is alot of fat. So this is a must in the taste. There was not one person who did not compliment me this holiday weekend, and there were lots of cooks, this recipe stood out. BTW it took an hour to shred  the beef and get rid of lots of fat in the chuck roast but it did not shrink much as I anticipated in the slow cooker.

L.O.V.E. this BBQ sauce. It thickens nicely in the slow cooker and goes well with just about any meat.. Chicken, short ribs, meatballs. Tangy and sweet. DEEEEElish!

This was only OK. The meat took a lot longer to truly get tender and the sauce was too vinegary for us.

I browned the meat before putting it into the slow cooker and I cooled the sauce in the freezer before serving to make skimming the fat easier.  This turned out delicious and I will be making it again!

I also added a little less vinegar than it says. I also only used 3/4 cup of ketchup (to avoid it tasting too much like it like other users said), and used 3/4 cup of bbq sauce. I trimmed & cubed the meat, and cooked it 2 hours before stirring on the sauce. Turned out great for bbq sandwiches!

Easy to throw together. But as others reviewed, the meat gives off a LOT of oil and the sauce was way too liquid.  After 7 hours on low I skimmed a good inch worth of grease off the top.  I then removed the roast from the pot, shredded it, and placed it back into the skimmed liquid.  I added a jar of store BBQ sauce and let it all simmer for another hour.  What a delight!  Served on warm buns with pickles and coleslaw on top. Keeper!

I give this a 2 star as written. I scaled this to 7 servings for the 2-1/4 pound roast I had. The vinegar in the sauce was on the strong side for my taste. I would either leaving that out or just use red wine in its place. Maybe I'm just not a huge "vinegar with my meat" fan.  I added LOTS more brown sugar to combat the vinegar flavor and even had to add a tad bit of my favorite BBQ sauce to help out. I defatted the roast as much as possible and cut it into large chunks prior to adding to the crockpot.  I put 2/3 of the sauce in with the meat and saved the rest to add after it cooked and I am glad I did. It ended up very watery in the crockpot but I took the meat out and put it in a fry pan and shredded it. I added the remaining sauce to the pan and added some of the juices from the crockpot also and warmed through.  It wasn't fatty at all so I had no need to refrigerate to defat like other reviewers mentioned. I served this on Kaiser rolls and it was very tasty. After the tweaks to suit our tastes I could upgrade my rating to 4-5 stars.  My 2-1/4 lb. roast made about 4 good sized sanwiches on the Kaiser rolls and would probably made about 6 with regular hamburger buns.

Oh, so divine!  I halved all the sauce ingredients as my chuck roast was only a bit over 2 pounds (there was plenty).  I did add about 1/2 an onion, chopped and used 3-4 garlic cloves.  After I got this going in the morning, I realized I had no buns to serve this on and we were in the middle of a terrible winter storm...I didn't want to go to the store.  Wracking my brain for an easy alternative without actually having to bake rolls...I made garlic cheddar biscuits to make the sandwiches THEY WERE INCREDIBLE!  I will always serve it this way...we had NO leftovers.

Best BBQ beef I have made! After shredding the beef, I put about 1/2 cup of sauce into a small sauce pan and added 1 T corn starch and made a rue then added it to the rest of the sauce in the crock pot, stirred it in, then added the beef back to the crock pot and continue cooking for an hour. The sauce seemed very thin and this helped to make it more hearty.

WOW!!! (notice the 3 exclamation points)
This was sooooo good, I added some BBQ sauce and a few big pieces of green pepper, and didn't add the dijon, it was fantastic.  I made sandwiches using "french bread rolls to die for" and it went very nicely together, will be making this again next week for a party.  Thank you for the deliciousness :)

Simply fantastic!  My husband is a BBQ connoisseur, but I am not a huge fan of most BBQ's.  They are usually too sweet.  This was the best I've ever had, and my husband says it is "by far" the best he's had.  Very easy to make.  I added a little extra salt at the end, and I didn't have any liquid smoke, and I made my 1/4 cup of sugar a scant cup (just a little shy), but otherwise followed it to the letter, and it was fantastic.  I trimmed my meat up first, and that made it less greasy and easier to shred in the end.  Don't hesitate to try this one - you won't be sorry!

Awesome!!  I used a smaller roast and it came out great.  For those of you having trouble with yours not being tender you will need to double the sauce mixture so there is more liquid to cover the roast while it cooks otherwise it will be tough b/c there isn't enough sauce for it to marinate in while cooking.  Try that or use a smaller roast.  If your worried about it being too greasey - just trim the roast b/4 cooking. This is the best BBQ I've ever had!!

My family loved the flavor of the sauce, but it was definitely too greasy for us-even after taking off hardened, congealed grease.  Next time, I will use a bottom round roast instead of chuck.

This was great!  I used two chicken breasts with this recipe instead of beef, and cut the sauce in half.  (Omitted the salt and liquid smoke, added tabasco sauce and onion powder).  The chicken was so tender and yummy!  I know it's great with beef too because my mom has used a recipe just like this for years.  Sometimes when I make her recipe I'll add a chopped onion.

I realized most of these ingredients were to make a standard BBQ sauce..so I cheated one day when I was in a HUGE hurry and just covered the beef with store bought sauce.  Turned out wonderfully!

Everyone gobbled this up.  And the enjoyment lasted all day because of the delicious smell emanating from the crockpot.  The kids begged for the leftovers.  I used brisket and cooked it the day before so I could skim the fat after refrigerating it.  I was quite glad I did.  It also allowed the sauce to soak into the beef a little more.  Next time I will start with a leaner cut of meat, but the sauce is what was so delicious, so I'm sure any meat will be just as good!  I will always do it a day in advance since it was even better the next day.

Great recipe!  I added extra Worcestershire and
some cayenne and cooked it "forever" in the crock
pot.  Only other thing I would change would be to
trim the meat, but the fat during cooking adds flavor.  Better alternative would be to refrigerate overnight and skim off any fat...but
now that we've tasted it, waiting another day is not an option :-)  Thank you!

Wow this recipe is fantastic, even better the next day.  I ended up having to add more ketchup, to get a sweeter taste, and had cut the vinegar by half, could even use a little less.  I have passed this recipe on 4 times.  I used pork roast - my favorite!  Great on a toasted bun and even a little mayo if you're daring.

I used a 4 lb. rump roast and it turned out great.  I made this one time before and I thought it had too much of a "ketchupy" taste so this time after I took the meat out to cut/shred I removed almost all of the liquid (about 3/4 of it) and added our favorite BBQ sauce.  So many people have different taste preferences when it comes to BBQ sauce that adding the kind you like to this recipe will will virtually guarantee you will like the taste.

I don't have a slow-cooker, and this still turned out fantastic!  My husband and picky toddler both loved it.  Following reviewers' advice, I added a dash of cayenne and made 1 1/2 the recipe of sauce.  Pays to take the time to trim off as much fat as possible from the meat.

Used this on a pork butt roast and it worked well too.I lightly salted and peppered the roast all over first. Be sure to make the full recipe of sauce, and remove the excess fat/juices before shredding.The meat was so tender after about 8 hours. Family loved it! Served with coleslaw~yum!

This was really good. I did use a higher grade of roast and trimmed some of the fat off to cut down on the grease. I did not make extra sauce because I wanted to use the sauce that had been blending for hours but I did use a couple tsp of Wondra to thicken it up. It clung perfectly to the meat! Excellent flavor and super easy, just thought it needed a little more zip. That can be added so will definitely make this again. 1/28- Just had the leftovers for lunch. They were excellent! I think next time I will make this the day before.

This was an awesome recipe! With our "brady bunch" like family; all the children having their own likes and dislikes I am always searching for something with "mass appeal".  This was a huge huge hit with the ENTIRE family!  I made a couple of alterations; I omitted the liquid smoke (couldn't find any in our area) and replaced it with hickory smoke bbq sauce (2 tbls)- I also used a honey dijon style mustard - fantastic!

This recipe is very easy, and tastes fantastic.  Like others, I made two batches of sauce and tossed the first have after the first part of the cooking - It does get a little greasy.  Doubling the sauce calls for 3 cups of ketchup - instead I used 2 cups ketchup and 1 cup chili sauce.  I cooked the meat for 10 hours, and it just about fell apart when I shredded it.  Will definitely make over and over!

Delicious. Family loves it! 
Put in slow cooker for 9 hours, shreaded it and drained all the grease, put the shreaded meat back in, along with a new batch of sauce, and cooked for an additional hour. Worked out just fine. 
Didn't use the liquid smoke
Will be making again!

Fantastic flavor!!  The sauce is great!  I agree with others about the grease, but think of the cut of meat that is used.  I'm thinkin that a sirloin tip roast would eliminate that issue.  I'll make this again for sure.  Thanks Corwynn!

Very yummy! Be sure to trim meat before cooking or it will lose the barbecue flavor to the meat juices from the fat.

Delicious!  I used a 2.5 lb roast and kept the sauce measurements as written, except for the liquid smoke.  Thought I had some but I didn't so I left it out.  I cooked in on high for 4 hours, shredded the beef, then put it back in the slow cooker on low for a few more hours with the lid off.  The sauce thickened up nicely.  My teenage son, a picky eater, asked if we could have it regularly!

I had high hopes for this recipe and boy did it deliver!  I used stew meat and it just fell apart so easily when shredding!   I also thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch before adding the meat back in.    A keeper for sure!

This was REALLY good.  I didn't have liquid smoke so figure it would be even better with that.  I also added about 1/2 C minced onions and 3 garlic cloves instead of powder.  Will be making this again!

Excellent.  Cooked with one batch of sauce, drained, shredded meat and froze. Defrosted, cooked in crockpot with second batch of sauce.  Couldn't have gotten any better!

I couldn't find liquid smoke in the grocery store,instead I added a chipotle chile.The hard part was keeping people away from the pot because it smelled so good. This was my first time trying a slow cooker and I am glad I tried it on this recipe.

This was great.  We have many roasts in the freezer (I made with chuck roasts) and this was a great way to prepare them.  I used balsamic vinegar - tasty.  Thought I would have enough to freeze - yah right.  The fam loved it!

Made as-is minus the liquid smoke.  My husband swears this is the best meal I've ever made.  Served on homemade hamburger buns from this site.  I guess it's a keeper!

Tasty and will make again.  Skipped liquid smoke and reduced vinegar to 1/8 cup. Per others, I removed most of the fat before cooking to reduce excess liquid fat on top.  I added a cornstarch slurry to thicken sauce after I removed meat to shred, replaced, and then simmered for 1/2 hour more. Served on rolls with sharp cheddar.

I followed the suggestion to trim off bigger chunks of fat, cook for about an hour and drain off, THEN add the sauce. I am one who is paranoid about leaving the crock pot on when away from the house, so I prepped this after dinner one night and cooked overnight. I got up a bit early for work the next morning, shredded the beef and put back in the pot for an hour, then 1/2 hour before I left I turned off the crock pot to cool down. I put the crock pot in the fridge on a towel, then after work I warmed on High for about 30 mins. 
This came out tangy and delicious and my boyfriend is still raving about it. I brought extras to work to share for lunch with a friend and she LOVED it. 
I am hoping I can play around with this base recipe a bit and make spicy just for fun some time!

YUM! I added a sliced onion to the top of the roast and cooked 4 hrs on high. It was deeeelish. My husband and I didn't want to to even add a bottled sauce to the sandwiches afterward in fear of degrading this sauce's fresh taste.

This recipe was absolutely sensational. I made a quarter of it, added a quarter cup of "Bone Suckin' Sauce", and I have to say - I was salivating for the last two hours at the smell.
Thank you so much!

I was a bit low on ketchup so tweaked it a little by making my own ketchup to add to the mix, and I sadly didn't have any liquid smoke, but all the same it turned out great!  The ratio for ingredients is perfect for give a good starting point to make a BBQ sauce that will suit anyone's tastes.  I served bread with it for my family to assemble as they like, but later had as a snack and can tell you it is amazing on Ritz ;)

In all my years cooking, I had only made BBQ beef once and it was so time comsuming, I never made it again.  That is until I came across this recipe.  This was so simple and perfect.  There are only two of us and it made enough for 3 meals.  The first night we had it over mashed potatoes for dinner and the next two days on buns with French fries for lunch.  My son was looking for more the next day!!  The only ingredient that I didn't have on hand was the vinegar so I used red wine instead.  I have chicken breasts in the crockpot while I am writing this along with the bbq sauce from this recipe.  I haven't been to the store to purchase another beef roast yet.  I can't wait to eat!!

This is probably the easiest thing to put together in a crockpot.  The only thing I did different is use Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, which lowered the calories.  I bought a 2 3/4 pound roast, but used the same amount of sauce. (We didn't need such a large roast).  We like lots of sauce.  I also changed my servings to 10 due to the smaller sized roast.  The smell is heavenly and I'm sure this will be a keeper.  Haven't actually eaten it yet, but the reviews are terrific.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I halved it and left out the liquid smoke but followed the recipe otherwise. I put in the crockpot on low for 10 hours, then when I got home I used a spoon to get off as much of the grease as I could (which was a LOT!!) I shredded the beef in the crockpot with 2 large plastic spoons then let it soak in the sauce for another another hour while I fixed my side dishes. I served these on French Bread Rolls to Die For. They were TERRIFIC together! :)

Great recipe.  I added some chopped yellow bell pepper and chopped onion, probably about 1/2 cup total.  Then I rubbed the roast with a BBQ seasoning mix and placed it on the chopped veggies in the pot.  Finally, I poured the sauce over and cooked as directed.  Very good.

This was good. I made to the recipe-- after reading other reviews- i cooked for 10 hours and then left lid off for 2 hours- i still had to drain some juice off my beef to make it thicker- flavor was good- I think next time I will cook my roast in crock-pot- remove, shred, add the sauce- I liked the sauce.

This is sooooo good!  I even had to leave out a couple of the ingredients and we still loved it.  I didn't have liquid smoke and I'm sensitive to some ingredients in the Worcestershire sauce, so I didn't use those.  It still came out so tender and flavorful!  If you can, use organic ketchup (it doesn't have high fructose corn syrup), which is a good idea since this recipe calls for so much ketchup.  This is a great recipe for summer - it doesn't heat up the kitchen and it goes great with summer side dishes, like corn on the cob and potato salad.

So easy to make and my whole family (even young kids) loved it.  We didn't have greasy sauce like some people commented about, but I always trim my roasts really well before cooking.  I don't typically like warm meat sandwiches and I loved it.  I sliced up some onion and put it on the bun also.  This recipe is definitely a keeper for us.  I also left out the 1/2 tsp. of salt because usually I find Crock-Pot recipes to be too salty for my liking.  This was just fine for me without the extra salt.

AWESOME! It was amazing! My fiance and I like our barbecue sauce a little sweeter so I added an extra 1/8 cup of brown sugar. I also didn't have any liquid smoke but we didn't miss it! It was great!

I was surprised at how good this turned out to be especially the second and third day.  I followed the recipe but did double the sauce.  I actually cooked the meat in one batch of sauce until the meat could be broken apart easily.  I noticed a lot of fat and the sauce seemed scorched so I poured out the sauce and used the remaining batch of sauce.  I cooked about 10 more minutes and it was great!

I somehow lost my login info to this site and could not find this recipe on the site the searching "bbq beef".  This recipe is soooooo good, however, that I spent almost an hour trying to login to get to my recipe box. Finally logged in and am so happy.  You cannot make this dish bad. It is simply the best, and probably will be your bf/hubby's fav meal.  No need to look for any other bbq recipe! I had better print it out this time!

This is one of the best recipes I have ever gotten off this site.  First of all, it is sooo easy to make.  Anyone that said that the sauce tastes too much like ketchup or to vinegary I have to disagree with.  I added a couple things, for no reason other than I just wanted to experiment.  I added some makers mark bourbon and some honey.  Seriously, make this now.  It is amazing!!!  Thanks for an awesome recipe.  Def will be a keeper.

Yep, this is good BBQ beef.  The meat is tender and flavorful, and very easy to shred.  My daughter gets especially excited when I make this dish (which makes me feel a little guilty because it's so easy)!  I make it as directed, but usually add 5 or 6 tablespoons of honey for a little background sweetness.  This beef freezes well, making it perfect for a quick/on-the-fly dinner or lunch.

My husband loves this recipe.  I always get good results.  I have also used pork and venison.  Both were awesome.  Yesterday I forgot to take the meat out of the freezer.  So I cooked the roast in beef broth for 4 hours on high then poured out all the broth.  Added the sauce and cooked for another 5 hours on low.  Turned out great.

Absolutely Fabulous!!!!  My family loves this dish.  I made it exactly as written with one small exception. Since I didn't have any "regular" dijon mustard on hand, I used Jack Daniels Southwestern spicy brown mustard and it had a perfect "bite" to it.  Also, spooned over home made toasted hamburger buns. DELICIOUS!

Fantastic recipe.  Very tasty...just like my mom makes and I could never get quite right on my own. Use smoked paprika instead of liquid smoke and it was perfect.  Also seared meat like pp's and deglazed pan with vinegar and added all into crock pot.  Will definetly make again. P.S.  Used the left overs to make Uglies a recipe on AR that uses canned bisquit dough to make cups filled with pulled beef and topped with melted cheese.  Yummy as well.

I never realized something so easy could be so wonderful. This is my third time making this and I wouldn't change a thing. I serve it with coleslaw on top. Leftovers are even better the next day.  Thanks Corwynn for a great go to recipe.

So easy and so good. Read the other reviewers comments about being a little greasy, so added a little cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce a bit and absorb some of the grease.

I have made this 3 times now and love the flavor of the sauce. As others have suggested, I used a pork loin to lessen the greasiness, cooked it for about 2-3 hours (high setting) and drained the fat. I added the sauce as per recipe at this point and continued cooking for another 2-3 hours (low setting) or until able to pull apart with a fork. My granny (the cook of all cooks) raved. 'Nuff said...

Really good!  After the meat was done, I put the sauce in my gravy separator to get the fat out then reduced it on the stovetop. After I shredded the beef I returned it to the crockpot and mixed the sauce in.  No need to cook for another hour and it didn't require any additional bbq sauce.  Delicious!  I served it over toast with cole slaw on the side.

I made 50 lbs of this recipe for a school fundraising function (for sandwiches) and it was WONDERFUL!!!  The longer you cook it on the lowest heat, the better!  I cooked it for 24 hrs on 250 degrees.  Thanks!

Made this last night for dinner. After reading the other reviews, I decided to adjust the recipe a little. To counteract the watery sauce problem, I waited until after the meat was shreded to add it. Also, to keep it from being sweet ketchup, double the liquid smoke, cut about 1/8 of the ketchup and cut back on the sugar by about 1/16 or so. Came out a little smokey but tasted like it was made with actual original flavor BBQ Sauce.

Oh so good! I halved the recipe and out of necessity had to use soy sauce instead of worcestershire so I reduced the salt. I also added a teaspoon of good old Australian Vegemite (concentrated yeast extract). Many Aussies use it on baked roast meats as it adds a real zing. This was great on fresh baguettes with fried onions, accompanied with potato salad and a tall pitcher of iced tea.

This is so good! I made the mistake of leaving it in the crockpot too long last time and it wasn't as good. No more than 6 hours! Also I added about an inch of water on the bottom of the crockpot to keep it from burning the sauce the first time I cooked it. It helps alot! The sauce it thick enough it stays on the roast anyway.

Put the sauce in the freezer while shredding the meat.  Scoop off the frozen fat and discard before adding back to the meat in the crock pot.

This turned out really  good!  I varied from the recipe just a little.  I cooked a  3lb roast in my slow cooker on low with a can of beef broth for about 5 hours.  I removed it from the slow cooker and poured out the liquid that was left.  I then shredded the beef (picking out any fatty pieces) and placed it back in the slow cooker. I combined the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl, omitting the liquid smoke and increasing the ketchup to 2 cups and the brown sugar to 3/4 cup in order to cut back on the tanginess and make it a little sweeter.  I then added the sauce to the beef and stirred to combine and cooked on high for 1 hour.  Delicious!  Thanks!

This is really good!  I also made double the sauce.  I used half ketchup and half chili sauce and it was perfect!

I seasoned (granulated garlic, white pepper, seasoned salt) and browned the roast before adding to the crock pot.  I cooked it on high for one hour (to get it "up to temp") then on low for 7 hours, then split up the meat, removed the lid, and cooked for an additional hour on high.  Perfect!

I served it on toasted buns.  YUM!

This recipe was very bland. The sauce had the consistency of a thin soup. The beef was very tender, but had very little flavor. I followed the exact recipe and ended up with a forgetable dish. If you like your barbecued beef to taste like barbecue, I highly recommend looking for a recipe using tangier ingredients.

Used 1c BBQ sauce + 1/2c ketchup instead of all ketchup, plus added a couple shakes of tabasco.  Sweet but tasty (I wish it had been spicier!).  I cooked it one day, put it in the fridge overnight and lifted the hardened layer of fat (yuck!) off the top the next day before shredding and re-warming.  This step definitely would fix the greasiness other reviewers mentioned.

I prepared this  for my cooking club and EVERYONE loved it! I made it the following week for hubby and the kids and there were NO leftovers! Like other reviewers I did make a few minor changes. I'm a real big fan of barbecue sauce so I also used 1 cup of barbecue sauce and 1/2 cup of ketchup instead of the 1 and 1/2 cups of ketchup the recipe calls for. We wanted the beef to be spicy, so I added 3-4 teaspoons of hot sauce as well. When serving on rolls, I spread a generous amount of barbecue sauce on each side of the roll and then filled them with the beef. Served with a side of potato salad, these sandwiches made us feel like we were at summer barbecue even though it's fall! This recipe is now a permanent part of my recipe collection!

Wowee!! This is the best BBQ I've ever had!  My husband 2nds that!  I used the chuck roast, but I cut off all the fat prior to cooking the meat. I put the raw meat and the sauce in the crock pot overnight and then put it onto cook before I left for work the next morning. I got home, shredded it, and returned it to an UNCOVERED crock pot for an hour. I had it in sandwiches with fries. YUMMY!:-)

Excellent!  My husband preferred this recipe over our favorite BBQ joint.  I used pork instead of beef and used 3/4 cup of our favorite BBQ sauce with 3/4 cup ketchup (since some reviews complained of too much of a ketchup flavor).  I did cut out all the fat that I could from the meat before putting it in the slow cooker.  I did not have any problems with my sauce being greasy.  My husband can't stop raving about how good it tastes.  These are leftovers that will definitely not be going to waste!

My husband is a fireman and pretty darn picky....he loves this recipe!  So did the guys at the fire station.  The only modification: We added 1/2 cup of Sonny's BBQ Sauce after shredding the meat - then allowed everything to crock for an additional 20-30 minutes.  We served this on french bread rolls topped with sharp cheddar cheese...SO GOOD!

I made it with brisket.  It was a hit, but next time I'll trim off the fat before cooking it to keep the sauce from being so greasy.

I love this recipe! It's so versetile. I made it with beef first and then tried pork. Both turned out great. It's good as a sandwich filling or just by itself. It's also very forgiving if you don't have the exact ingredients.

I didn't have a roast, but I did have about 4 pounds of ground beef.  So I browned the meat, drained it, and put it in the refrigerator until the next morning.  Then I combined the meat with the rest of the ingredients and left it all (plus about 1/2 cup water) in the crockpot on HI for about five hours.  It could have gone for 4 hours, probably.  It made wonderful Sloppy Joes for lunch after church.  It's going to be a staple around my house from now on!

This is the best!!!!!

I don't own a slow cooker so I cook it on the stove top. Slowest simmer for 5-7 hours. To do this I add one cup of beef stock and one cup of red wine. I also use cubed stewing beef. Don't have liquid smoke available in Australia (that I have found) and it doesn't appear to be missing anything.

I make this 3 or 4 times a month now.

Thanks for bringing a bit of the USA down under!!!

This is the first thing that I have made in my crockpot since getting it for christmas that has actually turned out well. My husband thought it was store bought. I have made it several times and even my children like it. The beef shredded beautifully and it was so easy to make. No fuss at all. I served it with cole slaw and corn on the cob. I didnt use the liquid smoke cause I did not have any on hand and several times when I have made it I left out the vinegar and it turned out fine. I used Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ Sauce. This is a keeper.

So easy!  I set my crockpot on low for about 10 hours while at work & came home to a wonderful smelling kitchen.  Only change I made was using half of the called for vinegar & added a little BBQ sauce to the ketchup.  My sauce was a little thin, made the buns a little soggy.  Next time i will add a little thickener before serving, but will defintely make again!

I found this recipe in the Tried and True Cookbook from allrecipes.com and love it for its taste and cooking method.  I would recommend using a roast instead of boneless beef ribs, as they seemed to be a little on the tough side.  I also cut back on the ketchup (only used 1 cup)as some members of my household are not fans of ketchup and the beef still tasted wonderful!

WOW!!!!!  I have to tell you I used this recipe for boneless beef ribs. I was so excited to 
try this recipe after reading all of the reviews.  They were not wrong.  Unfortunately when I
started making the sauce I realized that I did not have enough catchup.  So I used 3/4
of a cup of catchup and 3/4 of a cup of Kraft Mesquite Smoke BBQ sauce.  For 2 1/2 
pounds of ribs, I cooked them on low for 5 hours and then turned the crock pot to
warm for 3 more hours.  The flavor of the sauce was absorbed into the meat.  It was 
wonderful.  My kids even ate their meat and complimented me on it...that is a treat

This was wonderful! Next time I make it (which will be soon) I will add a bit more brown sugar and some cayenne, but it was good as is too. I doubled the sauce, but it was a little much so I will probably just go 1 1/2 times on the sauce next time. Thanks for a great recipe Corwynn

This went over well, but some who tried it felt it needed more of a sauce to it (they thought it was too dry), so they added some BBQ sauce to theirs.  Perhaps I used too much beef.

The next time I fire up my grill, I'll be sure to have a 4 pound chuck roast on hand.  I think that's the only way this recipe could be improved.  I think to authenticate the real barbecue flavor it would help to be put the roast over charcoal for a bit and then do the crockpot thing.  Trimming all the fat from the roast before beginning is well advised.  Great, simple recipe.  Will become a mainstay in our home.  Thanks.

To this day, I have never had beef barbecue this good!!!  I gave it to everyone in my family and they couldn't get enough.  I now make it at least once a week.  The only alternation I made was to double the brown sugar as we like a sweet barbeque sauce.  Definately a keeper!!  Thank you Corwynn!!!

This was excellent.  Went with other reviews and put it in the crockpot the  night before, was greasy but took care of that. Also, did make an extra batch of sauce, put a bit more in the shredded meat then the extra served on the side.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This recipe was fantastic! I was looking for recipes for my new slow cooker that I could put on before going to work and have ready when I got home.  I was skeptical about the barbecue sauce mix because it tasted 'ketchupy' when I first put it in the cooker, but by that evening, it was great and had blended well.  Even my kids loved it, and they are TREMENDOUSLY picky.  I'll be making it again definately!

Tasted great and easy to make, but the amount of grease after cooking all day was nauseating.  I know this is probably just the nature of the beast, but I had never made barb-q beef before and I was disgusted.  I drained as much as possible off the meat.  Next Time after shredding the beef I will dispose of all the sauce/grease mixture and start with a new batch of sauce.  Of course it was very tasty and I would make this recipe again.  Not very heart healthy.

This is so good. The flavor is perfect. I cooked the roast for a few hours, shredded it and then added the remaining ingredients.  It was a little less messy and everything blended just fine. Will make this often.

Although you have to wait (an agonizing wait when you smell the wonderful aroma!) 10 hours to let this recipe cook to a tantalizing, fall-apart consistency, it is the BEST barbequed beef recipe, as well as the easiest. 
About 15 minutes into cooking, I had to leave the house.  The smell of the cooking sauce was too tempting.  
One thing I will try next time is removing most of the sauce at the end of cooking and reducing it or thickening it to better "cling" to the shredded beef.  It was delectable the way it was, but a thicker sauce might even outdo it!
I'm off to the supermarket to stock up on chuck roast which is on a great special this week!

I found this to be very tangy and was very delicious on top of a bun.  I used an elk roast as it was nice and lean.  A nice change from ordinary roast!

This was amazing!!! I would say it the best bbq beef recipe I've ever had. I will try it with pork too. I did not change a thing. We do not like vinegar or mustard. I was concerned by some of the comments of being able to taste the vinegar. I couldn't and trust me, even a little hint and I'm done. My kids loved it!!! My husband loved it!!! It's a keeper for sure.

Was searching for a quick and yummy way to make the ground beef I had thawed and came across this recipe. I used ground beef instead of a roast so it definitely changed the nature of the recipe, but made a really quick and easy supper! Sauteed onion, browned meat, drained fat. Mixed sauce ingredients (didn't hav Worcestershire or liquid smoke so used bbq sauce and paprika) and then added to meat in skillet. Cooked a few more minutes and served with scoops of mashed potatoes. EXACTLY THE TASTE I WANTED!!! My husband loved it and so did my 2 year old! Scraped the pan clean. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe, but the main complaint I have seen is that there is a lot of fat sitting in the sauce. To avoid this, I did a salt, pepper, and garlic powder rub on the beef, then smoked it for 10 hours. After smoking, I tore up the meat a bit and put it in the slow cooker with the BBQ sauce (I added 8 cloves of fresh garlic and 1/2 tbs of pepper after tasting the sauce, but I love garlic and pepper) for another few hours. It takes a lot longer, but worth it for the flavor.

I made sloppy Joes using this recipe and it was so good. I used 1 pd of ground beef and cut the recipe in half to make it saucier. I only put in 1/8 cup of light brown sugar. Ketchup has plenty of sugar in it. I also added 1/4 cup of mixed diced red, yellow, and green peppers and used 2 large cloves of fresh garlic. WINNER!! Thanks for the recipe. I'm saving this one.

Let me tell you how delicious this is... I made this for my fiancé's work potluck, and it got rave reviews! Putting meat in a slow cooker is nothing new, but what makes this so good is the delicious homemade barbecue sauce! There were some complaints in reviews about the vinegary taste to the sauce, so I just left out the vinegar altogether instead of potentially ruining the whole batch. I added a little extra brown sugar, because I served them as sliders with sweet Hawaiian rolls (TOTALLY recommend you try it. SO good.) Taste the sauce before pouring it over to meat, and just adjust it to your taste, if necessary.

I was using a roast straight from the freezer, so I was not able to trim the excess fat before cooking, so to address the fat/grease issue, I put the roast in the crockpot by itself on high for about 2.5 hours. The meat had softened up to a point where I could trim trim the fat and drain whatever grease was in the bottom of the slow cooker. Then I poured the sauce over and cooked on low for about 8 hours. I took another reviewer's suggestion to pour the sauce into a bowl and let it sit in the freezer while shredding the meat. The fat rises to the top and you can just skim it off with a spoon before adding the sauce back to the pot. I did need to make a bit more sauce to add in at the end. It turned out amazing!

To prevent moisture from accumulating in a crock pot, fold four layers of paper towels and place under the lid.  The towels will absorb excess moisture.

I used a pork roast. I replaced half of the ketchup with my favorite prepared barbecue sauce (Famous Dave's Rich & Sassy), quadrupled the garlic, and used applewood liquid smoke. I halved the meat total but kept the full sauce quantity because I like my barbecue saucy. After it cooked, I tucked the meat into some jalapeno cornbread batter before baking. Yum!

This got rave reviews at my house.  Already stocked up on chuck roasts for the next time.  Did not change anything.  Perfect as it was.

I kept to the recipe, but used balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine because that was all I had.  easy and delicious!  Will definitely be making this again.

Very good BBQ beef!  I followed the recipe to a T and my family enjoyed it.  I used a boneless shoulder roast instead of a chuck roast.  It is a bit leaner, and although it didn't shred quite as easy as a chuck roast would have, it was not too fatty or greasy at all.  But still very tasty!

This was delicious, I made it using beef, because it was cheaper than a pork roast. But the next time I'd like to try it with Pork.

Great recipe as is. I have also smoked the meat on my webber for about 2 hours @ 250 then put it in the slow cooker and omitted the liquid smoke. Great either way.

Wow!  This was awesome!!!  I normally hate leftover meat of any kind (except for left over ground beef from spaghetti and meat sauce).  Not this stuff - it tasted just as good (if not better) the next day.  I used a cross-rib roast and trimmed all visible fat off of it before placing it in the slow cooker.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee!

I've made this  a few times  now and everyone LOVES it!  The sauce is fantastic and easy to prepare.  The only change I made was to use half the amount of liquid smoke as I'm not a huge fan of it.  Shredding the beef takes me a while as I really fuss to eliminate any fatty parts.  I have chilled it before shredding which makes it easy to remove the fat that cooked off.  Then it needs to be reheated to shred easily which is fine because it needs to cook a bit after shredding anyway.  It freezes and reheats to be just like freshly made!!!

Excellent!!!  Best BBQ beef I have ever made.  I didn't have red wine vinegar and used white wine vinegar instead.  And I used 1/2 tsp cajun seasoning in place of the salt and pepper.

I've tried a few barbeque beef recipes and this one is definitely the best! So much flavor, not too sweet or saucy, just right really. I did try to cut off most of the fat before cooking to keep it less greasy, then just followed the recipe as is. Will definitely make again, going in my special recipe box for sure!!!

This tasted fine and most people would probably really like, but you really have to like thick sauces covering your food.  That's not really our thing so it was a bit too thick and sweet and essentially covered the flavor of the meal.  My husband ate it, said it was good but didn't want me to make it again.  My son ate some of it, but while protesting.

SO good!  Everybody loves it!!!!  Have made it quite a few times now.   Here are my notes: reduce vinegar to 1/8 Trim roast can freeze sauce while shredding meat and skim off fat turn on high with lid off last hour to thicken sauce Definately a keeper!

This was awesome.  My family loved it at their beach house.  I forgot to mix in the red wine vinegar before I poured the sauce on the meat.  I just added some after and it still tasted great.  The sauce was awesome without it as well.  So if you don't have red win vinegar don't stress.

this was FANTASTIC. I didnt follow the measurements exactly, and added things to-taste, but wow-ee deelicious! I slow-cooked it together 8 hours while I was at work, then shredded the roast while pulling out all the fat. I also used a gravy separator to get the fat out of the sauce. Poured it all back into the pot for another hour, served w/mashed potatoes and broccoli. AMAZING leftover, too! Will be making this again!

This doesn't taste like real barbecue by any means.  The meat gets really tender and it has a decent flavor, but it's more of a tomato sauce flavor than a barbecue flavor.

It was good but missing that wow factor reaction.  I thought the sauce was a nice base.  I had 2lb chuck roast and cooked it for 5hr on high heat.  Next time I will simmer my own favorite bbq sauce seperately and add it to the meat after it's been shredded and the greasy sauce taken out.

Yum!!! This was the first time I used a crock pot, and it was so worth it! The only thing is there was a lot of grease on top, and I had to try to soak some up because there was just too much for my liking. Very good though!! I will definitely make again one day!

was very good and flavorful. Used real garlic and taragon vinegar since i didnt have red wine vinegar. Trimmed most of the fat off of the beef before cooking. Just dumped the ingredients in the crockpot stirred it up, tossed in the beef, rolled it around a bit to cover, put on the lid and a few hours later a delightful dinner emerged.

I tasted barbecued beef for the first time at a quilt show and decided to try it myself. This is the first recipe I found that seemed like it would taste like the one I had eaten. I wasn't disappointed at all; it was perfect. The only changes I made was using some thick round steaks I had in my freezer, and I didn't have liquid smoke and I omitted the salt (I don't like salty foods and generally don't cook with salt). Because I used round steak I did not have the grease problem some readers commented on.

I wish I could give this more stars.  I DO have to say that the meat was very tender.  literally fell apart.  however, the whole thing was literally too salty to eat.  maybe it was the liquid smoke.  I've never cooked with liquid smoke before, but my mother in law said that one whole teaspoon seemed like a lot.  especially considering I could only find a 2.8 lb roast.  it's the biggest one they had. I'd actually like to try this again since the meat was so tender. maybe next time I'll leave out the liquid smoke, and just add a pinch of salt.

I think this is one of the easiest and yummiest meals I made in crock pot. Since I didn't have the smoke flavoring and worcestershire sauce, I added 1 cup of bbq sauce with smoke flavor and I added more crushed black pepper because I like it spicier. Maybe I could add chili powder next time. And since I didn't like it too vinegary the first time I made it, I used 1 tb sp in the 2nd time I made. I also added some potatoes, carrots and celery and ate this meal with warm bread and butter.

Excellent!  I added BBQ sauce since I didn't have any liquid smoke.  I used white wine vinegar instead of red wine for the same reason.  I used steaks that I needed to get out of the freezer.  Probably due to the cut of meat, I had very little fat in the sauce.  This was very good and went especially well with the creamy coleslaw I found on this website.

This was so good!  Even better - my husband ate it up and liked it!  Easy and tasty.  I followed to a T.  When I tasted mid-point, I thought it might be a bit too mustard-y, but at the end, it was perfect!  I highly recommend!

This was great! Hubby liked it too. As other users stated, it IS sweet. I think next time I will cut back a bit on the brown sugar. I did not have 8-10 hours cook time so I cooked on high for 3 and low for the last 2 and it turned out perfect. EASY!!

So easy to make and there is never any leftovers. I've done it with either the sauce recipe or with bottled/store bought sauce and both comes out great.

I'm always skeptical about using my crock pot because food often come out tasting funny.  Not so with this recipe.  It was very good although somewhat sweet to me.  Next time I'll use less brown sugar. I used a 2 1/2 pound roast and this was done in 6 hours.  By letting it cook a few hours longer, the sauce got thicker and the meat had a more brown or oven cooked texture.  I served this over mashed potatoes and it was a hit with my family.

this was easy but i found the sauce to be boring.  needs a little more zip to make it more interesting.  i did add a spoonful of sweet restaurant slaw (also from this website) to the sandwich and that made it pretty tasty.  but alone it was kina boring.

Well,I made this out of a sirloin steak and I didn't have liquid smoke (I thought I did!) and I used honey mustard but it turned out great! My son had three bowls!My dad had two and my mother had one so I'm lucky I got anything when I got home from work, Thanks for the recipe!

I gave this only 4 stars because of the grease factor.  I came up with a great solution the second time I made this - I had the butcher cut 4 1lb thick sirloin steaks. with this modification, it is perfect!

i made this yesterday for dinner and it was a hit. I cooked it for 10 hours in the slow cooker and then shredded the beef and cooked it another 40 minutes on low. The only thing that really made it a 4 out of 5 was the amount of grease. I had read about it in other reviews so i trimmed as much as i could, but it still had plenty when it was finished. I think i am going to try a pork loin the next time and see if it is better. I am also going to add a little red pepper or hot sauce for more of a kick.

I have made this 5 times and it is a hit each time.  I make it for football and poker parties.  It makes the house smell great and the beef is SOO tender and delicious.

Thank you for this little diddy! My two picky sons each came back for more!! I reduced the amount of sugar (because I am trying to cut carbs) by using low-carb ketchup and Splenda brown sugar - also omitted the mustard due to an allergy. Even with these alterations, this recipe is a keeper.

So easy!
I used bbq sauce and a big squirt of ketchup. I added extra dijon mustard and wochestershire sauce. I also added some mexican spices. 
I reccomend cubing the meat, and cutting out the fat before hand.
I let it cook overnight, let it sit in the fridge while I'm at work during the day, skim the fat when I get home and get rid of the greasy sauce, then cook on high for another two hours with the rest of the sauce (I make a double batch of sauce.) 

YAY!

This recipe is Fabulous!!  As other posters suggested I did thicken sauce with a little cornstarch.  The suggestion by
another poster to put sauce in freezer
and skim off the grease was a great tip too! And don't leave out the liquid smoke..it really adds to the flavor. Thank you so much for the recipe.

I didn't think this was amazing. I think it definitely has potential though, so if I make it again I will play around with it a bit. I ended up with a lot of liquid and the barbecue taste was pretty mild. Next time I would drain it a bit, and add more sauce when I shred the beef.

I used a deer roast instead of beef. with this recipe you could  not tell it was deer meat. Very tasty. My guys liked it and requested more. I let it cook longer in the crock pot.  Then I transfered it to the oven for the last 1 hour. I am very please with the great taste.

This was a great hit.  I made it for the boys' football night.  I added an onion.  I used half bbq sauce and half ketchup. I left out the mustard and it still tasted great. I didn't find the sauce to runny at all.  It was perfect.  I put it in the croc-pot on high for 4 hours and it just fell apart.  I will definatly make this my permanent bbq beef recipe!

I love this recipe.  I follow it exactly, except for two things.  I usually have to add a bit of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it, before I pull apart the meat.  And second, if I'm using this to make barbecue sandwiches, I add a bit of mayo to the mix at the end.  Makes it very creamy. Yummm!

THE BEST!!! I have made this 4 times in the past 10 months or so and every time it has turned out EXCELLENT!! If the sauce is too thin, add a Tablespoon or 2 of cornstarch. I cook this at high altitude and it is AWESOME every time!!

This tasted good, but the sauce was like water.  I ended up draining the meat, shredding it and then added it to an entirely new batch of sauce.  I liked this recipe, so I think I will just cook the meat next time and add the sauce during the last 15 minutes or so.

This was fantastic!!! I made it for a bunch of guys on Sunday for football and they nearly inhaled it. One guy said he had a "foodgazm" it was that good. I definately reccomnend serving it on a hoagie with a large slice of cheddar cheese.

Great Recipe. I cut some of the fat off as suggested. I prefer savory BBQ versus sweet, so I substituted 1 can of manwhich bold sauce for ketchup, left out the brown sugar, and doubled the liquid smoke and added Lawry's

I have made this so many times over the years.  Everyone loves it!  Even my picky 3-year-old. The sauce does come out too thin, so I usually double the barbeque sauce and  add the other half after I shred the roast.

I saw the great reviews on this recipe and just had to try it, but it was terrible.  My whole family was disappointed.  I was so ketchupy and sweet.  I'm just going to stick with my own recipe next time.

Delicious! I added a tiny bit of flour towards the end to thicken up (had no cornstarch) and it was fabulous. I also omited liquid smoke and added about a half tsp of cumin.

Forget the negative you may have heard!!!  This recipe is AWESOME.  I made it for my family who ate every last bite.  Then I made it for poker night and 4 of the men took the recipe home to their wives.  It's a definate winner.

This was really good and easy. After about 7 hours of cooking I realized the top of the roast that wasn't in the liquid seemed to be kind of dry, so I flipped it over. Next time I will turn it more often and/or add some more sauce. (I made some extra sauce to put over the meat and the sauce is definately better when the meat is cooked in it, although it ends up being thin.)

This is a most delicious dish. I sliced the meat thinly  BEFORE I cooked it rather than try to shred it later (messy). It was wonderful and sooooo easy!  About halfway thru the cooking time, I gently separated some of the slices to allow the sauce to permeate.  Regular mustard is just as good as Dijon and with the mustard, ketchup & smoke flavoring, it really doesn't need any added salt. What a treat!

This was very good and very easy.  Everybody in my family liked it - even the dog because I made a bit of a mess shredding the beef that she was only too happy to clean up!  I'll definitely make this on a regular basis.

This recipe is perfect.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I was very surprised that another reviewer referred to this dish as bland.  It's not bland at all!  I would make the sauce by itself to use on other things because it is so good.  I'm going to try this recipe again with a pork roast next time.

I made this the first time for my husband and I, and have made it several times since, for parties and carry-ins.  It is wonderful!!  I follow the sauce recipe exactly.  I do recommend getting a well-marbled cut of meat because a really lean cut gets too chewy and stringy.  Plus, you pull the whole thing apart, so it's easy to get rid of most of the fat.  Great for leftovers, too!!

Delicious and very easy to make!!  I cooked it overnight for about 8 hours.  I then shredded the beef and stored it separate from sauce in refrig.  Later on I skimmed fat from sauce and then put both sauce and beef back in the crock pot for about an hour.  Served on mini kaiser rolls.

This recipe was very simple, yet very good!  We can't get BBQ where we live now, so it was fun to make it at home.  Next time, I think I'll try trimming the excess fat off of the meat.  Great recipe!

Even my picky in-laws ate twice as much as normal.  Easy recipe.  Delicious flavor.  I used half as much vinegar, but everything else the same and it was great!!!  Will definitely make it again.  Thanks.

I had put together two other barbeque sauce recipes before I tried this one (at midnight, for the crockpot, for dinner the next day!)  I was literally rinsing the other sauces off my shredded chuck roast in a colander because I thought the sauces all tasted so gross!  I was looking for a sweet and tangy recipe, a bbq beef recipe like I remember from my childhood in Texas.  This is it!  I'm so glad I rinsed the other ones off!  :)  Very tangy, very good.  Not for the vinegar haters-  But it is an authentic sweet vinegar texas barbeque.  The bbq-beef recipe I've been searching for!!  I cooked it in my crockpot with a shredded, leftover, cooked chuck roast, green pepper and onion for about 2 hours.  It was perfect on hard dinner rolls with cheddar cheese, mayo and red onions!

This makes very good sauce!  I had planned to put some of my favorite store bought sauce on before serving but I didn't need to the taste of the slow cooked sauce was so wonderful!  I cut the fat off a small to medium sized roast and had plenty of sauce for moist and delicious sandwiches.  My guest loved it and it was even better the next night!  Thanks for a great recipe! I highly recommend it!

This had a strong vinegary taste but I suspect it's the store brand ketchup which tasted very tart out of the bottle.  I tried compensating for it by adding extra brown sugar which helped but still not the best resulting taste it could have been.  Next time I'll buy Heinz!  I may also just try doing the same cooking method but just using a prepared commercial sauce like KC with liquid smoke and a few spices and see how that turns out.  Anyway, I LOVE barbeque food so I really appreciate this simple recipe!  Thanks for posting it Corwynn!

Followed this recipe exactly.  Wonderful...  I went to the local Italian bakery and bought some fresh semi-hard rolls.  Wow!!! My husband thought it was really great.  Tasted like an authentic Texas barbeque.  Really a keeper.  The only thing I want to try is using pork instead of beef next time.

Great recipe! As a vegetarian, I don't mind making meat dishes for my husband, but often haven't a clue as to what he might like.  This recipe had great reviews so I thought I would try it out.  I used half of the required meat and kept everything else the same.  My husband and our dogs were drooling while the meat cooked all day in the crockpot.  When it was done, he said not to change a thing!  Next time I might put it in a tortilla for him as a wrap.  Thanks again for such a good recipe!

This recipe is great! I received my first crock pot for the holidays and this was the first meal I made using it. My boyfriend said it was "heavenly." It was even better the next day. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

My boyfriend loved this, the only problem was that there was way too much sause left over.  I cooked it the last hour with the lid off to evaperate some of the sauce.

WE LOVED THIS!  There were no leftovers, it was so good.  We didn't change anything about the recipe, except a few lower fat modifications: cutting all the fat off the roast before putting it in the crockpot and, as others said, skimming the grease off the sauce before replacing the meat after shredding it.  This helped cut down the nauseating grease factor that other reviewers mentioned.  We served it on the rolls that we cheapest, but it didn't matter what they were, they were just vehicles for that amazing barbequed beef!  Next time, we will definitely start this the night before because, when it is smelling up the place, you can hardly wait to eat it! YUM!  YUM!  YUM!

Wow!  Great flavor and couldn't be easier. A true crowd pleaser! Make sure your roast is not frozen as it takes a long, long time to get tender in the crock pot (took almost 12 hours and roast was only partially frozen).

I tried this recipe some time ago and have made it several times. It was a wonderful recipe. It was so simple to make. The first time I made it I didn't have liquid smoke and it still turned out great. I have also made this recipe with a pork roast which my family seemed to like better. Make this recipe, you won't be disappointed. It smells fabulous as well.

Wonderful!! The only changes I made:  after the 10 hrs. of cooking in the crockpot, I skimmed off most of the original juices, then covered meat with a small bottle of Montgomery Inn BBQ sauce, then I cooked it for one more hour in the crock pot.  My husband brought it to a work potluck today and came back with a little bowl for me to try.  (yes, I sent it with him without even trying it!) Everyone loved it and some even asked for the recipe. Luckly, I sent a copy of the recipe with him.  Thanks for sharing Corwynn.

I read the reviews before I made this and started it in the crock pot before I went to bed. I planned on giving it extra time in case it was too juciy. I had never used liquid smoke before and was a bit leary, so I used 1/2 the amount but as I tasted it throughout the day I added the full about and it was wonderful. If you like barbecued beef you will love this recipe. I had alot of company over and this was a hit. I did add several stalks of chopped celery. A real keeper.

So, so, so delicious!  The sauce is out of this world.  I loved the taste the liquid smoke added.  I was worried about the grease as other reviewers mentioned, but it wasn't that bad, although I did make a new batch of sauce just in case.  My hubby and I both loved these!

YUMMY! Made this for grandparents day, it was a huge hit. 8 of us nearly devoured the entire pot.
Luckily there was enough to send home with granparents.
I served this with coleslaw, and a black bean salad, and homemade lemonade.
This is deffinately a keeper.

My family has been making this recipe for quite some time now and we love it!  We have served it to guests with wonderful reviews and the leftovers NEVER go to waste on this one!  The only time we had a problem eating it was when my husband substituted the kids green ketchup for red ketchup... it turned the meat green!  Nobody could stomach the green meat... despited the fact that it still tasted exactly the same!

YUMMY! My husband loved this sauce. I used it a couple days later on Pork Tenderloin and it was even better. I did not  have smoked seasoning and it was good without it.

Applause!!! Simple, delicious, and easy ! Highly recommended. Just remember to drain the excess grease, and if you want to add pizzaz, make 2 batches of the sauce, pour second batch on after you drain the grease.

Excellent served over rice, and great for leftovers the next day.  Add extra barbeque sauce for more tanginess.  Great served in fajitas.

Actually I was a bit disappointed....I have a recipe that I have used for years which entails baking the beef, cooling it, then slicing it with the grain, adding other ingredients (onion, green peppers, celery, vinegar, dry mustard) and then cooking 6-8 hours in crock pot.....I may have to go back to my 'tried and true'!

This is great...With so many positive reviews I felt I couldnt go wrong..My husband is Canadian,Im American, and he had never had any kind of BBQ beef..I was worried that here in Canada I wouldnt be able to find all the ingredients, but I was able to and so pleased with the results..The only thing I did different was to throw in some extra garlic powder and I also added a chooped onion to the sauce..I did not make an extra batch of sauce..I instead added about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch and it was perfect!!...The smell while it was cooking was wonderful...I served our sandwhiches on toasted onion buns with a slice of cheese...DELICIOUS!!!. My husband loved it and even said he thought next time we have people over for dinner I should make this..Thanks for a great recipe!!!

My husband and sons love this recipe! I have had better luck using sirlion or another type of leaner meat that I don't have to spend so much time getting rid of the fat. This is the best BBQ our family has ever had!

This was a really good recipe. I have tried many times to make homemade barbecue sauce and I really liked this one. I will probably make extra sauce next time to store in the refridgerator and use for other meals.  Everyone in my family enjoyed this dish. Thanks!

I made this when I was going to have a bunch of teenagers over after church. They LOVED it!!! Whenever the youth group is coming to my house they always are excited because the food is delicious - and this one is one of their favorites. Everyone in the family loved it and I'll make this recipe often!

Personally, I thought it was a tad bland - but it could have been MY OWN FAULT!  I cut the recipe in half since there was just the two of us, and maybe the sauce got watered down by being in the crockpot all day.  I also didn't take the suggestions that say to drain and make a new batch of sauce after shredding, and letting that sit awhile.  That probably would've made it more tasty.  I'll do that next time!

This recipe is delicious, quick and easy!  I'll definitely use it again!
I didn't make extra sauce like many recommended, but I had more than enough.  The sauce did get thin though.  I just added alittle cornstarch and it was perfect.

This was great, and my husband loved it!  The meat came out really tender.  However the sauce did thin down a lot by the end, so I dumped about 2/3 of the sauce it cooked in, made a half recipe of the sauce and mixed it in.

My husband LOVED this recipe!!  I would have liked a little thicker sauce.  I will solve that problem next time by making a second batch of the sauce to pour over the top of the sandwiches--and I WILL be making this recipe MANY more times.  Great flavor, and extremely yummy!!

I cooked the roast in the sauce and when it was time to shred the meat, I drained the sauce out and made a new batch, then coated the meat and heated through!! I served them on homemade Burger/Hot Dog buns that are also featured on this site!! Try it!  YUMMMMMMM

Difficult to give a "quickness" rating for a slow cook dish, but prep is minimal, and the outcome was delicious.  I had every ingredient in my cupboard, and it came out tasting restaurant good!

Overall it was a fair recipe.
The sauce was thick and wonderful
when I poured it over the beef.
When I opened the cover the next morning
the sauce was not thick and it seemed
to lack some more seasonings.
I think just cooking the meat in
the crock first than adding the sauce
later is still the best way.

This recipe was a huge success at a Potluck I took it to.  My family was disappointed that there wasn't any left to take home. It was a bit tangy for my daughter but she still ate it up

My first slow cooker recipe that I tried from this category and it was really tremendous.  The only problem was patience.  The kitchen smelled really good long before the cooking was finished.  I did this on Memorial Day along with other outdoor cooking but the barbeque beef seemed to be a real hit.  Thanks for the recipe.

Seriously, five star!  I'm amazed at how good this turned out!  I did the recipe to a "T", but I chose to listen to others reviews on halfing the red wine vinegar.  I have no idea if it would've been better to go with the recipe on that exactly, or not.  I really tried to go to the "T".  I also noticed some of what the other reviewers said that they had to shred and then continue cooking uncovered because the sauce was thin.  It was, but I'm not sure why, because I tried to trim all the fat before cooking.  I ended up throwing it shredded down into a pot on the stove on medium.  It evaporated nicely and quickly.  I'm going to choose in the future to do 4 roasts at a time and freeze 3/4ths of the recipe for 3 future dinners.  It's the same energy and time.  I'm glad I spotted this fantastic recipe!  My whole family raved about it!  Now, I have 4 dinners, one fresh and three frozen ahead, where it'll save me boatloads of time and not taste like a frozen dinner.  I did add one small, chopped bell pepper, and one, small chopped onion and through it into the mix, but I'm sure it didn't affect the flavors too much.

This was a very good recipe. I made it as the recipe stated except used a bit less vinegar. I made it the day before and let it sit in the refrigerator to let the fat harden.  Everyone enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again.

Started with this recipe and made some changes in cooking method and sauce ingredients.  I put garlic powder and pepper on the meat and wrapped it in foil.  I cooked the packet on low for @ 8-9 hours.  The meat was really tender, falling apart.  I carefully lifted the foil packet with the liquid and grease out of the crockpot and reserved it. (My thought was that my sauce might be a little too thin.  I ended up not adding of the liquid in.  I would keep this in mind if I had a larger cut of meat and needed more sauce.) 

Next, I pulled the meat apart, mixed sauce, combined with meat, and cooked on high for @ 1 hour.  I made sauce as follows:  1 1/2 c ketchup, 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/4 c red wine vinegar, 6 T mustard, 2 t Worcestershire sauce, 1 t chili powder, 1/2 t garlic powder and 1/4 t black pepper.

Great taste, but the sauce was very thin and soaked right through the buns, making a big mess.  Would add something to thicken the sauce next time.

I LOVE this recipe. It's in the crock pot now, as I write.  I'm headed to a party and thought that this would be a great addition to any BBQ menu.  I always trim the fat off the roast and cut it in smaller pieces.  I've never had any issues with fatty sauce.  Also, the mustard I use is a horseradish mustard and, after reading a couple of reviews, I will try to cut down on the ketchup and use honey instead.  I will continue to make this recipe as it's a hit with the husband, a a very picky eater.  Thank you, Corwynn - Sherricd

I made this recipe as directed minus the liquid smoke & I trimmed off all the fat before searing. I think the liquid smoke would have made the sauce more appropriate for beef, but without it (& maybe with it) we (5 adults) all agreed this sauce seems more suited for pork. Will definitely make again using a pork roast.

*You can taste the vinegar so reduce by half if you are not a vinegar fan.

*make sure you trim as much fat off as you can. I hacked up my roast into about 10 pieces trying to remove it all & the fat content came out just right.

The combination of ingredients that makes up the sauce is really good, it's just a matter of meat preference.  My whole family liked the flavor but didn't like it with beef.  I will probably try a similar sauce mixture and use pork next time.

Good, simple staple recipe. I didn't miss the liquid smoke and reduce the amount of vinegar. It was easy to double and triple since my roast was 3lbs. I added Bullseye BBQ in to the pot after I sliced it up. Made it thicker and oh so delish!

I made this recipe pretty much "as is" and it was awesome. I could only find a couple 2 lb roasts at the store so I used those and doubled the sauce.  I also placed the sauce in the freezer while I shredded the meat and then scooped off the grease.

I added celery and an onion.  Just eyeballed the ingredients.  Used stew meat instead of roast.  Cooked on high for 5 hours then switched to low since it was done.  Served on Kaiser rolls.  Fabulous!  Thanks.

I always make the recipes on here they way they are first so I can rate the actual recipe and not everyone's modifications. The flavor on this was good but it was really liquidy, we ended up having open faced sandwiches.

OMG! Is all i can say. My husband had purchased a 1/4 of a cow and have noticed the meat do not have a lot of fat during cooking process. I did not have a lot of fat to skim off the top as some of the reviewers did. I did take advice and seared the roast with peppers and onions. I also let my sauce cook in the dutch oven about 10 minutes before pouring in crock pot.

Just amazing!! I didn't get the roast out in time to thaw so I threw it in the microwave on defrost and then chucked in in the slow cooker on high for approximately 4 hours. This sauce amount was not enough because of the higher temperature, so after I shredded the beef, I ended up adding about a cup of our favourite BBQ sauce.  My husband ate about 3 helpings that night, and has taken it for the lunch the last couple of days as a sandwich filling. Everyone at our house loved, loved, LOVED this!

Oh this was really good.  I used chuck roast and followed the recipe exactly.  The sauces is really tasty!.  I cooked for 10 hours on low (overnight) and then removed the meat and shredded it.  I poured the sauce in a bowl and refrigerated it so I could skim off the fat.  I then heated the sauce in a pan to thicken it and served it over the beef on hamburger buns.  REALLY GOOD!!

I substituted my favorite bottled BBQ sauce for about half the ketchup and it turned out fantastic! I could hardly stop eating it. It made a lot of sauce, so if you're using a smaller roast, you may not want to stir all the sauce back in after shredding the beef - it could get a bit soupy. I also skimmed as much fat/oil as I could off the sauce before stirring it into the shredded beef. Bought some nice kaiser rolls from the store and had amazing BBQ beef sandwiches. It makes a lot and I live by myself, so I froze some of the leftovers. They thawed and reheated great a few weeks later. I will definitely make again!

Ok but not great.  Sauce is not that good - think it needs onion and maybe less vinegar.  This does work great on a baked potato.

This was fantastic! I cut most of the fat off my roast, so I didn't have any problem with it being too greasy. I served over homemade hamburger buns. Very quick and easy too, I had this going in the crockpot in less than 5 minutes.

Love this one! I added a rub o the beef, which was some pepper, garlic power and onion salt. You might need more sauce too. It will depend on what size beef chuck you get. I also added a little tabasco sauce to it for some kick! My husband loved it and will use it again.

Followed the recipe exactly except left out the liquid smoke because I didn't have it.  Very flavorful -- so quick and easy to make.  For those who says this is bland, they must have done something wrong!  I served these on rolled buns and ate them as sandwiches.  So good!

Great sauce recipe.  I am going to try brushing this on chicken over the grill this summer.  I used about 1/2 the liquid smoke the recipe called but that is the only change.  That change is personal preference so if you like it smoky add the full amount!

I wish I knew what all the fuss was with this recipe.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and was very disappointed with the bland flavor.  We ended up having to add Sweet Baby Ray BBQ sauce, which helped a little, but overall this recipe didn't work for us.

I made this exactly as directed.  After mixing the sauce I thought it might taste too ketchup-y, but it was delicious!!  (My boyfriend had four sandwiches) No need to brown the meat first.  I cooked it for about 9 hours, and then stirred it - the meat fell apart and blended with the sauce perfectly.  Next time I will definitely double the sauce.

This turned out really well! I think the liquid smoke really added something. The meat didn't take 8 hours, only about 6 hrs on low. I didn't want it to dry out so I took it out and shredded it then. I also trimmed it before putting it in the crockpot so there wasn't all that fat. It was a little sweet, but very tasty!

Another good idea...double the sauce ingredients, cook the meat as stated in the crock pot. Then brown a couple pounds of hamburger and add it along with the meat during the last hour or so of cooking. You can stretch this recipe to feed more like 20 and it's economical too!

I read all the reviews and was excited to make this.  There was a ton of grease.  I placed it in the freezer and skimmed the grease after a while.  I just was not really impressed with the flavor.  There was some odd after taste.  I followed the receipe but it could of been me since there was so many great reviews.

Definitely Five Stars - fabulous! I used inside round steak and didn't  have time to brown it first. I cut it into strips, put it in the slow cooker, and then poured the sauce over and let it cook on high for 4 1/2 hrs. I removed about 1 cup of sauce and added some cornstarch to it to thicken up the sauce & then added it back into the slow cooker. We all loved it - Thx Corwynn!!

My rating would be a 3.5-4 for flavor. 5 for ease. We all thought it was very ketchup-y & vinegar-y, which I'm finding with a lot of the bbq recipes I've tried from AR lately. Just can't seem to find that right balance in homemade sauces. It was a very easy recipe. I used some bottom round steaks I had bought super cheap, trimmed the fat & they worked perfectly. I think we all, as a family, found that we really prefer pulled pork to pulled beef. Thank you!

Great recipe - this is one of the best homemade BBQ sauces I've tasted.  I added a little more brown sugar to balance out the vinegar; since the sauce ends up very watery, I'll probably just cut out some of the vinegar next time.  I tried leaving the top off of the slow cooker for the last hour as was suggested in another review, but it didn't seem to make much of a difference.  Still, this recipe was a hit - even with my wife, who's from BBQ pork country!

The method is great, but once the sauce is cooked for hours doesn't turn out to be a nice BBQ sauce.  It is very watery and I didn't feel the flavor was that great.  You need to have a bottle or make some for adding to the meat at the end.  I prefer "Mijos Shredded Beef" recipe from this site.

This is a fabulous recipe!  I made it for the superbowl and just pulled some out of the freezer for dinner tonight - YUM!  This will definitely be my standard BBQ Beef recipe!  The only thing I did different was to trim the fat from the meat before cooking, and cut into smaller chunks.

this is a great recipe I made it with a large pork roast, cooked on low for 10 hours in crock pot.  Took it out cooling the sauce untill grease go hard then scooping the fat off reheating the sauce with the meat in it for another four hours on low.  The meat pulled apart and the flavor was great.  We use for pull pork sandwhich and tacos.  The only thing I did different is add more garlic because we like garlic.  It makes enough for 2 meals for a family of 5 with 2 teenage boys. I love this recipe.

Since I have only about 7 hours to cook a meal in my slow cooker and this once called for 8-10 on low... I have used other recipes that called for for 8-10 hours on low that give the equivalent of 6-7 hours on high.  I just cooked it today for about 6.5 hours on high and it was amazing!  I do agree with the fact that there is a lot of fatty/ runny liquid after cooking however, I just drained most of it, pulled most of the fat off the meat and added bbq sauce to the cooker.  I was afraid that the cut would turn out tough like other reviews stated but i must have did something right as this was by far the most tender piece of beef I have cooked with (I mostly use pork).  If someone doesnt have any bbq sauce on hand.. why not add a little flour to the liquid at the end?  Cant wait to make it again.. :)

I let this cook for 17 hours on low, and it came out great! Came apart with a fork, not too strong a ketchup-y flavor. I would go for more liquid smoke next time I make it!  I didn't want to make any changes the first time I tried it, but my husband, seeing the liquid level drop and scared it would burn, threw in a 10oz can of beer when the beef still had 12 hours to go. The gravy, obviously, was thinner, and I don't know how much the flavor was changed.

I loved it & it was very easy to make. I cooked it so long my sauce dried up & kind of burned towards the end but throughout the day I was tasting it & it was delicious. Will make again

I buttered my roll and then sprinkled a bit of garlic powder. I threw the rolls in the broiler... About 5-7 minutes later I added the shredded beef and added some hot sauce. Very delicious. I was skeptical at first because the smell of vinegar was OVERWHELMING but the key here is to let it cook for a very long time. At least 8-10 hours on high and if on low I would say at least 14-16 hours. The longer it cooked the better it tasted. I had a 2 lb roast so I adjusted the measurements accordingly.  The sauce basically dried up because I cooked it for so long so I also added about 1/4 cup of barbeque sauce in the end. My little ones especially loved this recipe. My hubby added hot sauce to it but then again he adds hot sauce to everything. ;)

I'd like to punch up the flavor a bit but it was easy, straightforward to cook and made my family happy. It's a 4.5 star but since I had to go 4 or 5 I went with 5 stars.

Good, but the original recipe did not make nearly enough sauce for our liking. I had to add more sauce ingredients as the meat was cooking.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day because the 4 stores near me were all out of corned beef & my husband opted for bbq beef as his 2nd choice.  Obviously I did not serve this with cabbage...  Delicious!  I'm not a huge bbq beef fan, but this was good.  My husband had THIRDS and was excited to take the leftovers to work for lunch.    I served it with lemon-almond-garlic green beans, salad & scalloped potatoes.

I have had this in my recipe box since 2002.  On the recipe exchange some one had asked what was the oldest item in your box that you haven't made?  This was it.  Not sure why I never made it.  I followed the recipe exactly and I was not impressed.  When making the sauce I thought to myself "this seems like the perfect bbq sauce" in the end it is fairly runny and has a very strong vinegar taste to it.  That caught me off guard because it only has 1/4 C in it. I also have to tell you that I'm very fond of vinegar.  I was a little disappointed that it didn't make a richer bbq sauce.  I'm hoping it might taste better after it sits.  I don't think I'll make this again.  Sorry to be the lone dissenter here.

We loved this recipe.  The only thing I had to do different was I used half ketchup and have Baby Ray BBQ sauce because I didn't have enough ketchup.

This recipe is one of my favorites on this site- and I have many! As other reviewers advised, I doubled up on the liquid smoke. I also added some hot sauce for an extra kick. Cooked it for about 7 hours before taking it out to shred. So amazing! Everyone loved it. Can't wait to make again!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great except the sauce is not sweet or spicy, which my family really likes, so next time i think i will add some sugar and cayenne pepper but for a general barbecued beef, it went over very well!

I am giving it 5 stars because it was good, just not exactly my idea of bbq. The ingredients keep it moist, but I prefer BBQ sauce. I like it saucier. Is that a word?

I used balsomic vinegar instead of red wine since that is what I had on hand.  Other than that, I made the recipe exactly as instructed.  It was delicious and the entire family loved it.  They said that it was much better than the local barbeque restaurant's sandwiches.  When I removed the meat to shred it, I also transfered the juice to a bowl and stuck it in the freezer for about an hour.  It let the fat cool on top and made it easy to scoop out.  I added the shredded beef and sauce back to the crock pot and heated back up.

Wow, this was wonderful!  My parents said it was the best BBQ they ever had.  I used a pork loin so it was nice and lean and I had no issues with greasiness.  I added a bit more worcestershire and liquid smoke (maybe 50% more) than it calls for to make it a little more flavorful.  Thanks for the recipe, this will be a regular meal in my house!

I made this for our Sunday nite Church group this past week and everyone loved it.  I thot it was gonna be runny but it wasnt. I liked the combo of sweet but needed more zip so Ill add some pepper sauce or somtin next time.  Was better after it sat in fridge overnight an all flavors soaked in.  Def. would let the sauce sit in fridge next time to get rid of the grease and let the flavors soak in.  But really good bbq tho.  Thanks

My whole family loved this recipe and that is very rare that the six of us agree on one thing.  I used a top round roast because the market didn't have rump or bottom, but it was still excellent.  I made another batch of the sauce the next day and used that for the sandwiches.  We were licking the sauce off the plates.  I also added a little cayanne pepper for a spicy kick.  It was so yummy that I was asked by my sister-in-law to bring this to her block party in a few weeks.  Delish!

Someone mentioned that this recipe was from a book that came with a crock pot.  I don't care where it came from, this recipe is delicious. Thank you for sharing it!

Great recipe, although it's an EXACT - ingredient for ingredient, amount for amount - copy from the Slow Cooker cookbook that comes with Crock Pots (or at least the one I bought several years ago)!

I've been making this for a few years and it's awesome!!!  The first time I made it I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used Balsamic and it was good so I just never tried it as written.  It also makes a great brisket!  Every time I make it people rave and ask for the recipe.  It's my go-to recipe for taking a meal to a new mom or someone who just needs a meal for whatever reason.  Best to do as others have suggested and refrigerate and pick off the grease after it's chilled if you aren't going to devour it right away.

This was so tasty and so easy to make. I cubed my meat rather than leaving it whole. Otherwise I followed the recipe. The aroma throughout the house was lovely and the taste was great. I served this with mashed potato, carrots and corn on the cob. A definite cook again.

This was great.  I cut as much of the fat off as I could before I cooked it, and I didn't have any to skim off the top once it was done.  I used someone's idea about using less vinegar (about half as much as the recipe said) and it was fabulous.  This was very good, and I will definitely make it again.

This was great!

I basically followed the recipe as is but substituted the beef with a pork butt roast, which is a bit cheaper. I also added 1 tbsp. of cornstarch to the sauce after I took the pork out to shred it.

After I skimmed the fat, this was good to go and it was a great change to the usual meals I make.

I've made this recipe SO many times, and it's a hit every time!  I usually use a bit less liquid smoke, but other that I wouldn't change a thing!  Excellent make-ahead dish to serve a crowd, and you can enjoy your guests!

This was a great easy & quick recipe.  I did add sliced potatoes and carrots first to the pot then put my beef ontop. The flavor from the sauce soaked into the pototatoes and carrots and was just perfect.  Usually you have a lot of sauce left that is why I added the veggies.!!

Amazing. This is way better than just tossing a roast in with a bottle of BBQ sauce. SOOOOOO good. It always disappears at potlucks.

Simply amazing.  I was stunned at how perfectly this turned out with so few ingredients, and wouldn't change a thing unless you like a different style BBQ sauce.

This is a recipe I make often.  It's one of our families favorites!!  WE LOVE IT!  I only change 2 small things:  Use an ARM ROAST.  They have less fat and they shred SO much easier.  We buy all our meat at an Amish meat market... so everything is fresh.  Which in my opinion, makes a big difference when you are making this recipe.  They even trim the fat for me!  Second thing is I leave out the liquid smoke.   This is SO easy to make and absolutely delicious.  We serve it with Hawaiian sweet rolls and it's wonderful!  Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe.

EXCELLENT !!!! I've made this recipe for my fam on many occasions and they love it.  I did use BBQ sauce (thick & spicy) one time in lieu of the ketchup  and it really made no difference, my husband had no idea.  So ketchup or BBQ sauce, either one tastes great.   Thanks again All Recipes.   YOU ROCK !!!

Wow wow and wow! I am not a big red meat eater, but this was really good. My daughter loved it. I read some of the other reviews, and opted for using BBQ sauce instead of the ketchup. I didn't have any problems with it being too runny at the end. I also used the tip of cooking it with the lid off for the last hour. It smelled wonderful, tasted wonderful. It's just me and my daughter, so I put one container in the freezer and we'll eat our way through the other one.

I've made this twice in the past 2 weeks (b/c my husband begged me to make it again) and we loved it both times.  However 1st time I made it I followed recommendations of reviewer "Ash" and cooked it in beef broth, then added the sauce later.  It was good, but I used approx 2 lbs London Broil and it definately needed to cook longer than the suggested 5 hours of her review.  Yesterday I made this again and followed the recipe EXACTLY (except again used 2 lbs London Broil) and this turned out wonderful. Oh, I didn't have any liquid smoke so omitted that as well.  It did cook for 8-9 hours and it was great.

The beef came out so tender and juicy.  My boyfriend loved it as is, but I thought the sauce was a little too "tomato-y".  I may opt to use a bottle of my favorite bbq sauce next time.  I did have to skim off some fat prior to serving, but not a hassel.  Thanks for the recipe.

Eeeeew.  Made this one in the slow cooker and had it cooking on low all day.  It smelled delicious, but tasted terrible.  The sauce was all watery (even after continued cooking with the lid off), and didn't really taste like BBQ to me - more like catsup with sugar.  Yuck.

Made these for my daughters graduation. Used deer roasts, lots of them, had a large cooker full and there was absolutly NONE left over to our dismay. Even those who wouldn't touch deer did because of all the raving. This is definantly a keeper. Only change was I had no mustard, otherwise followed the recipe. Thank you!! Would rate higher if I could.

Recipe would have been too greasy if I would have placed shredded roast back in sauce so I made up another bach of the sauce and stirred in the beef and placed in oven until warmed.  The flavor is so good that I've passed this recipes on to several others.

This recipe makes the best BBQ Sauce ever.  I have made it for several occasions and always get rave reviews!  One person told me it was better than a well know BBQ joint in our area.  I always make extra sauce to put on the sandwich after the meat cooks or just to keep in the fridge when I need a little extra.

This recipe makes excellent barbequed beef. I usually use a leaner cut than chuck. Always comes out great.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  It is easy and very good.  The flavor is nice and subtle.  I like that it heats up well in the microwave for fantastic leftovers.  I will be making this again and again.

Super easy, super delicious! I used 1c BBQ sauce and 1/2c ketchup. And I skipped the liquid smoke flavoring. It was still a big hit! Will definitely be making this in the future.

This recipe is really easy to make. I served it with some potato wedges. It tasted better the next day. I took some to work and the aroma after warming it up fill up the office and everybody wanted some. I gave the recipe to my mother to fix and she said it was so good that needed to fix it more often. This is a keeper

Boy does this smell wonderful while it's cooking, unfortunately we thought it smelled better than it tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used regular vinegar instead of the Red Wine vinegar that the recipe called for, because that's all I had on hand.  Don't get me wrong it wasn't awful but it wasn't great either, just OK.  My 13 year old liked it but I think it's because he likes just about anything that is sweet, and this is pretty sweet.  I guess too sweet for my husband and I.

Mmm Mmm Mmm! I have never made BBQ Beef before. I was looking for a recipe for my parent's 35th wedding anniversary party. I thought...what the heck. I made it the day before and just reheated it. Well let's just say...I couldn't even have licked the crock pot clean! I underestimated how much I needed, that's for sure! Thanks for such a yummy recipe!

I have used this recipe for years and it is by far the best BBQ around.  One slight modification:  I use 1 cup Gates BBQ sauce and 1/2 cup ketchup.  Many thanks Corwynn, for this and other fantastic recipes.

This is a family favorite for football games and pot lucks. Like other reviews have mentioned, I also discard the sauce that the beef cooks in and make a fresh batch to pour over the beef once it's shredded. (The sauce that the beef cooks in seems entirely too greasy in my opinion.)  Otherwise I follow the recipe exactly and it always comes out perfect.  
We're from North Carolina which is known for it's traditional vinegar-based barbeque and we enjoy the slight vinegar tang to the sauce.  However I've served it to guests who prefer a sweet barbeque sauce and they love it too.

This was an easy recipe. I used two 2 pound roasts and it was done in eight hours. I did trim ALOT of fat before cooking and even during the shredding. The sauce was very runny so I gave it four stars. What made it taste like a five star recipe was that We used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce on the sandwhiches after using tongs to dip up the meat. My family was impressed and dad said it was the best BBQ sandwich he's ever had and he's from the south. SO I will use this again! (servedon onion buns with texas toast,corn on the cob, onion rings and coleslaw)

as a fan of corwynn's recipes, i had a hunch this barbecued beef would taste great. we really liked the depth of the sauce & how tender the meat came out. no modifications needed in this one aside from using mesquite liquid smoke & trimming some of the fat from the beef ahead of time. thanks again, corwynn!

very good. However I didn't like the type of meat choice. It was a tough cut and very fatty. I will be trying this again. The only thing I will change is the cut of meat. Thanks!

I made this recipe using venison instead of beef. My family loved it!!! My mother would go hungry before she would eat deer meat. After hearing the kids raving about the meat, she decided to try it... and she ended up going back for seconds! One of my sons told me to never loose this recipe because he wanted it again and again. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!!

Excellent!  I used 3/4 cup ketchup and 3/4 cup barbecue sauce, and 1 Tablespoon Dijon mustard and 1 Tablespoon honey mustard.  I also used pork - 3 to 4 pounds of country-style pork ribs, which I put in a pressure cooker with 4 cups water.  Cook at full presure for 25 minutes.  Then make the sauce separately - bring to boil and simmer for 15 minutes.  Once the ribs are cool enough to handle, remove the bones, shred and add the sauce.  Speedy and tender every time!

I used 5 beef top round steaks, each ranging in size from 1/2 to 3/4's of a pound for this recipe.  I did not have liquid smoke but compromised by adding Kraft Smokey Barbeque Sauce after shredding the meat as directed.

When making this recipe next time, the only change that I will make concerns the fat content.  Next time after 4 - 5 hours of cooking time, I will skim off the visible fat, take the meat out of the crock pot and then remove the existing sauce.  I will then follow the recipe directions again for making a new batch of sauce.  This way the final dish will not include nearly as much fat and the cholesterol level will be reduced dramatically.

The recipe was delicious and I enjoyed this wonderful dish with my daughter who normally is not a meat eater but loved it!

I really liked this. It tasted almost like Lloyds BBQ Beef, the kind you get at the store. It had a great flavor. But, my husband was hoping for something a little spicier, and a thicker BBQ sauce. I may try to achieve those in the recipe, but I will definitely be making again.

This is a very nice basic bbq beef recipe; my only complaint was it was a bit sweet and not as complex/ spicy as I'd like. I think with a little tweaking this'll become my favorite bbq beef recipe. Don't get me wrong, though -- you won't be disappointed if you make it as is. It was mild and flavorful enough that my 2 year old enjoyed it as well.

This is a great and easy dish for a potluck! I especially like that you make your own bbq sauce (super easy). I brought it for a work potluck a few months ago and my coworkers insisted that I bring it again!

This beef was very easy to make and tasted really good.  The only change I made was adding more brown sugar and some honey BBQ sauce.  Nice and moist.

The sauce had the consistency of a thin, oily soup.  The beef had no flavor.  I followed the exact recipe and ended up with a forgetable dish.  I realize this may be a harsh review. I highly recommend looking for another barbecue beef recipe.

I hate to be a lone wolf on this but I wasn't all that impressed with this recipe.  The sauce was very runny.  Will not make again, sorry.

I did not like how oily the sauce was after taking out the roast to shred.  I added a little bit of Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and skimmed all the fat after it cooled.  This was delicous I will definitely make again.

To me this was just ok.  It smelled really good but I thought it was a little bland.  My family had it tonight as left over and I didn't even want to have any.  It needs improvement in my opinion.

I wasn't sure this because of the smell as I was mixing the sauce ingredients, but after a couple hours of cooking the house smelled wonderful.  I took it to a church potluck and everyone enjoyed it.  My kids (5,6) loved it too.  They were even asking me if we had leftovers to take some home.

This recipe was easy and delicious. I added some ground cumin for a little extra smoky flavor. I used stew meat and only cooked it for 8 hours. Our entire family loved it! Thanks!

This is the best recipe for slow cooker beef bbq I've ever tried, and I've tried quite a few.  The flavor was complex and smoky, and spicy enough but not overwhelming.  We ate it on onion buns with coleslaw on top.  Yum!

I found this to be simply OK. I was really expecting with all the reviews for this to be a really great bbq taste. Next time I think I will just choose a tasty bbq sauce as the marinade instead of all that ketchup, sort of makes it taste cheap.

Good, good, good!  I used a leaner cut of beef and cooked it in beef broth to remove some of the fat.  After shredding the beef, and saving the broth for soup, I added the remaining ingredients and cooked until the sauce was reduced.  My husband turned his nose up as he walked through the kitchen while I was shredding the beef.  He isn't fond of BBQ beef.  He loved it and had seconds!

This is a super easy crowd pleaser.  While shredding the beef, I added one small can of tomato paste to the sauce to thicken and it was perfect.

Made this twice with the pork and one time with the beef. Haven’t noticed much of a difference. Very tasty.However... I do recommend cutting way back on the vinegar as suggested. I double the sauce and only use 1/4 cup of the vinegar. 
To save time in the morning when I'm in a rush, I'll make the sauce and trim the meat the night before . The next day just put it in the pot and head off to work.

This bbq was so good!! I put my roast in the crockpot, sprinkled with some seasonings, put in an envie of Lipton's Beefy Onion dry soup mix, and added some water. Cooked on high for 5 hours and then shredded. After shredding, I added all of the sauce ingredients and cooked on low for an hour. To the sauce, I added some honey and used regular mustard rather than Dijon. Perfect!!!!!

My husband and I definitely really liked this recipe.  I added some more brown sugar and honey because we both like sweet bbq sauce.  I also made a much smaller batch and only needed to let it cook in the slow cooker for about 6 hours because after 8 almost half of it was totally burnt.  But once we got it all done it tasted great!

Fantastic!  The smoky, slightly sweet, tangy barbeque sauce is the best I've ever tasted.  And, boy, is it ever quick easy to make.  I can throw this together in just a few minutes before work in the morning, and come home to a delicious dinner.  The only downside (and it's very minor) is the shredding of the roast.  I use a large serving fork to make it go a little faster.  Thanks, Corwynn!  I've gotten a several good recipes from you!

This is sooooooooo good!  Changes I made:
I used a pork roast, not beef.
I didn't have dijon mustard, so I just used regular yellow.
After cooking the meat in the sauce and then removing it, I strained the sauce (to remove the meat stuff) and then skimmed off the top to remove any fat (after the sauce has cooled, it is easier).
I also thickened the sauce with some cornstarch.  After the sauce was ready, I just combined that and the pork.  Excellent recipe!  I will definitely use this again!

We absolutely loved this recipe!!  I made a few minor modifications to the recipe by adding 2 cloves of crushed garlic (along with the garlic powder), a tad bit more salt and I used a 3 lb roast because that's all I had.  This dish will definitely be on the regular rotation in our house, thanks Corwynn!

this was really good.  I added fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder and i also added some hot sauce to spice it up a little.  the husband and kids just loved it.  I used a 4 lb chuck roast and ended up having enough left over to freeze for a second meal.  goes great with cole slaw.

Best I've ever had and very easy to make.  I made no adjustments to the sauce at all and served on some leftover pork roast.  I can imagine that this would be great on all meats and on the grill.  I'm kissing goodbye to storebought sauces.  Thanks, Corwynn!

The day I made this recipe my husband and I had it for dinner and I didn't like it.  He thought it was ok. The next day I reheated the left overs for lunch and it was excellent! I think it needed to sit for the flavors to properly mix or something.  My husband agreed that this recipe was awesome, the next day!

This was a good recipe. The only thing I would change next time is the amount of liquis smoke. My husband and I thought it was a little over powering.

Incredible recipe.  We were out all day at soccer games...cool, brisk weather.  Came home to wonderful smells and beef that literally fell apart.  My kids couldn't get enough and they are 5 and 8.  Quite a feat.  This is a keeper.

This was the best bbq ever. I made sure to trim the meat well. I also browned the meat slightly.I heated the sauce in the microwave before adding it to the crockpot. I like to heat things up before adding them to the crockpot,it speeds things up. I cooked 1 hr on high and 5 on low. It was perfect.  THANKS GREAT RECIPE!!!

Believeeeeee me this is the best barbecue I have ever tasted. It was so easy to make. I followed the directions and the only thing I added was the corn starch. Only because I like a sauce that stays on the bun. Very impressive. Thank you thank you!!!

I used only 1/2 cup of ketchup & 1/2 cup tomato paste to reduce the sweetness. I absolutley loved this but my Fiance said it was too sweet and he wasn't all that fond of the smokey flavour. Next time will reduce the sugar to just 1 tablespoon & add just a few drops of liquid smoke so we both enjoy it. Thanks for a great recipe.

I just love this recipe, it is great for the winter & summer BBQ's - one thing to remember is to leave the lid to the slow cooker cracked a bit so the BBQ sauce can thicken up. May need to double the sauce mixture.

I took this to a church potluck....RAVE reviews!!!  I did use pork instead of beef though...yummmmm!  I chose hickory flavored liquid smoke in the sauce and added about 3/4 cup of hickory smoke bbq sauce to it as well.  
I did make another batch of sauce and bottled it in case anyone wanted any extra, but I thought it was just fine without it...and apparantely everyone else did too.  I used about 11 lbs of pork (scaled to serve 24) and there was only a forkful left.

Super easy, flexible, and delicious.  Since we're doing low-carb, I replaced the ketchup with tomato paste and the sugar with Splenda and just increased the amounts of vinegar, Splenda, and spices to compensate.  I use 3/4 to 1 whole cup of vinegar, not only to make up for the vinegar that would have been in the ketchup, but also because I'm in North Carolina and like my barbecue tangy!  Turns out great.  Excellent with pork as well.

Now I understand why this dish has over 300 reviews.  Its so good you just have to rave about it!  My husband liked it so much, he ate 4 sandwhiches and couldn't stop saying how good they were.  I took the advice of other reviewers and made extra sauce.  I made a batch and 1/2 and added it to my crockpot.  Perfect amount!  When done, I refrigerated the sauce while I shredded my meat.  Spooning the grease off never was easier.  Thanks for the tip!

WOW! This is the best recipe ever!  I took advice of other reviewers and made a complete seperate batch of the sauce.  After cooking in crockpot and shredding beef, I stirred into fresh sauce.  A FAVORITE RECIPE OF THE WHOLE FAMILY!!  They all keep asking when I am going to make again.  Thanks for sharing.

The best BBQ beef we have had since moving from North Carolina. Add some lightly sauted onions after the beef has been shredded for a nice kick.

I made this for my visiting relatives for lunch.  I used London broil that I bought on sale so there was absolutely no fat.  It was still juicy and delicious!  I put cole slaw on the buns with the meat like some restuarants do.  Everyone loved it!!!

Very good!  I trimmed the roast to cut down on the grease and added some cornstarch when shredding the beef because we like a thicker sauce. Other than that no changes.  Great recipe!

This is an easy no fuss dinner that tastes great.  As suggested by a few other reviewers, I made two batches of sauce. I cut the 7 lb. chuck roast in large chunks and cooked it with the first batch of sauce, then drained if off at the end of cooking.  I then shredded the beef and added another batch of sauce, then heated on high for 30 min.  I might have had too much beef for the amount of sauce, but next time I will make a third sauce to serve at the table. It's a great sauce to have on hand anyway.  This is the ideal meal for teenagers who are always hungry.  I used Kaiser Rolls for bread. Thanks a bunch Corwynn for submitting this wonderful dish.  :-)

Great recipe.  I do recommend trimming the meat to reduce on the grease.  I used half vinegar and half red wine.  Also, used a roux to thicken gravy.  Rave reviews.

These were not 'great', but they were good. Next time I may try less vinegar, as it was just a bit too much for my taste. The other half loved it, and I liked it. I just wasn't blown away by it. It just seemed to be missing something, & I followed the measurments exactly. The best part of this recipe is the simplicity of it. Good dinner, thanks Corwynn.

Turned out wonderful.  It's easy & good.  The house smelled great all day. I served this on hawaiian rolls and with creamed corn. The grown ups loved it ...the fussy children didnt so much.  But it was tender and great for a fun Friday night.

This was pretty good - except that the sauce basically disappears when you are done cooking the meat.  I used half the sauce while cooking, then added the other half when it was about done.  I also ended up adding 3 small bottles of barbecue sauce.  One reason this may not have worked so well for me was that I converted it to make 20 pounds of meat for a party - so that may explain some of my problems.  I'll try again with the smaller portions.

If there were a TDF (to die for) category instead of stars, this would be it!  I used only 2 lbs of meat and the same amount of sauce - perfect!  It tasted like traditional Texas barbeque, and I'm a native Texan, so I would know! Serve with 'Creamy Potato Salad,' also from this site.  Wow!  Thanks so much for the recipe - what a way to woo my friends!

The beef was tender enough, but was a bit bland for my taste (and my husband's).  It tasted more like sloppy joe sauce than Texas BBQ sauce.  A crockpot can't replace that mesquite smoked flavor that my husband I miss so much abroad!  But overall, it was ok.  Thanks!

Turned out great, but would be better using brisket instead of roast.  I think that's more of a Texas thing.  :)

MY OH MY, Corwynn! What a great cook you must be. I haven't yet tried a recipe of your that we didn't absolutely love. This was sooooo flavorful. It was totally enjoyed by all at our card party. Many went home with the recipe! Thanks much.

This dish was incredible.  My whole family enjoyed the beef. Also, the smell throughout the house was mouthwatering! I did trim the meat prior to cooking. I can't wait to try this with pork.  Thank you so much for a recipe I will use again and again!!

This is the best crock pot barbeque sauce recipe I've tried.  I do prefer to use pork loin or baby back ribs rather than the chuck roast, even though the barbecued beef was delicious.

Very easy to make and turned out great! I agree the original sauce is much too greasy, but just made a second batch for the last hour of cooking. I served it on toasted onion kaiser rolls with French's french fried onions for topping- this was a big hit!

I took this to work for the fourth of July and everyone loved it!!!  Meat is tender, seasoned very well.  Very easy to make.  I ended up adding a bottle of KC masterpiece after the meat was shredded and back in the crock pot.

What can I say- This is absolutely delish!!!  I had made extra sauce as recommended by others, but found it to be too much.  Next time I won't double the sauce.  Actually used extra sauce to make bbq pork next time around.  Fantastic!!!

A great recipe, will last a few days for sandwiches.  Put on toasted Kaisers with any toppings or as is and voila, instant meal.  It was easy to shred, moist, and flavorful.  Go easy on the liquid smoke though, it can quickly overpower (1 drop was all I used).

This was a very good recipe.  The beef shreds very easily with the forks.  My kids didn't care for it, but I will try this again when my husband gets home from Korea.  I know he will like this!!

This recipe is definately yummy .... with a few changes (at least to my family's taste).
I added more brown sugar than the recipe called for (I made the sauce and cooked the
meat per the original directions, but we found it too vinegary).  I added about another
1/4 cup or maybe a little over of brown sugar.  I also used apple flavored liquid smoke
instead of the plain .... and I used half that the recipe called for.  I also found that 
adding corn starch thickened up the sauce nicely (per other's suggestions).  All in all,
this recipe was easy to make, just mix up the sauce throw everything in the crockpot and
let it do it's work!  Would make again.

Wow!  This was awesome.  My husband attends training classes in the south and he said that this bbq sandwich tastes like the ones he pays big bucks for down there.  I drained off half the sauce at the end, added a little corn starch, then added another half recipe of the sauce.  It turned out really great.  We will make this again and again, I'm sure!

This is the best BBQ beef I've tasted in a long time!  I don't have a slow cooker so I baked it, covered, at 225 degrees for 7 hours.  Then shredded it and cooked an additional hour.  Delicious!

CORNSTARCH IS THE KEY!  This recipe is perfect with the help of a little cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce.  Wow.  We LOVED these.  My brother was over for dinner and had four sandwiches.  What a hit!

My whole family (including my very picky husband) loves these sandwiches.  I thicken the sauce with a can of tomato paste.  We have found that this freezes well, also.

This recipe was easy to prepare and I always love cooking in a crockpot.  The sauce was a little bland so I added some bottled barbecue sauce to spice it up a bit.  Overall, my family liked it and we will probably have it again.

OK...I made this twice.  The first time I dumped the cooking juice and substituted a new batch of sauce, as suggested by some other reviews.  The taste was a little more bland than I expected and the sauce was too thin.  The second time, I shredded the beef and put it back into the original sauce after I thickened it a bit with cornstarch.  This turned out much better!  The key for me was not to let the meat overcook after shredding and returning to the crock.  Great recipe.  Thanks Corwynne.

I use a pork loin instead of beef and it is fabulous!!!   I don't drain off the juice, I just chop up the meat and let it cook awhile longer.  Just perfect for sandwiches.

This was great. When I read this, I didn't have a roast, so I made it with drained ground chuck and added a chopped onion. It was very good. Thanks for an excellent recipe! The leftovers were even better.

Made this at a family reunion last summer and received raves over it. I did end up adding hot sauce and more worchestershire because we like it less sweet. I also recommend going with more time than less...9-10 hours if you have the time. This recipe didn't make it to a dozen because everyone wanted seconds and we only had 9 people. When I do it again (and I will), I'll double the batch for 12 people.

What can I say that hasn't been said before. This is the best recipe I have have found in my life! I also had a thicken agent to the gravy, I found it too water. We eat this on special occasions, and there are never ever any leftovers. If you can withstand the temptation, make a day ahead and let it sit, the longer it sits the better it tastes. Mouthwatering!

Excellent !  I also followed suggestions to make extra sauce.  Replaced 1/2 of the cooked sauce with fresh and saved the remainder for serving.  Also replaced the salt with "Accent".  Definite favorite!

This was excellent!  Served at a family gathering and everyone raved about it!  I did double the sauce (half for the cooking and half for afterwards).  It is not a very saucy BBQ...more like a marinade.  Despite the lack of "saucyness" it was very flavorful (it really didn't need to by saucy).  Of course it takes a while to cook and shred the beef but it was well worth it.  Great recipe Corwynn!

this is a simple, flavorfull recipe.  The sauce is very good without being overpowering or spicy. I'll be using this sauce in other dishes.  This is a great recipe for informal gatherings, all my friends can expect to have this at our next superbowl party.

I have been making this recipe now for over a year and I absolutely love it! I always make it the day before (it's one of those things that's better the second day). Also, my husband put hot peppers on his sandwich tonight with it and said it was a perfect compliment to the meat. I don't like hot peppers, but if you do, he recommends trying it.

Luckily, I read the ratings for this recipe before I made it and was able to follow some advice.  This recipe is really good if you make a second batch of the sauce.  Drain the first batch and let the second batch heat through for the last hour of cooking.  Really excellent recipe!!

Couldn't make it with Chuck Meat so used Brisket instead and as I was feeding  a lot of people I adjusted the recipe amounts accordingly.
At the 4 hour mark I increased the heat to high and then at the 9 hour mark I shredded the meat, replaced into the sauce (kept some aside for some of our visitors who don't like meat in the sauce) and kept warm for another 1 hour.
Was a winner with all who ate.
Next time I'll try with chuck meat to see the different texture in the meat.
Thanks

Made this for family get together and everyone loved it.  I loved the easy prep, but I did sear the beef in frying before putting into the slow cooker.   I thought it was a little salty so next time I will salt after I shredded the meat.

I made a few changes based on reviews and added a touch of my own.  I put the slow cooker on high and added a large thinly sliced onion while I prepared the rest.  Instead of the suggested seasonings I used 1 teaspoons Nature's Seasoning (a favorite, instead of all the different ones.)  I cut the meat into chunks to get rid of fat first, Added them to onions and poured sauce on top and stirred.  When sauce was simmering, I turned to low and cooked for 6 hours.  Then I took meat out and shredded it, replaced it, added 3 teaspoons honey, stirred well and then cooked 1-2 more hours to blend flavors and thicken sauce.  The honey took away the "ketchupy" taste, and the sauce thickened nicely with very little fat. Don't have buns in the house but may run out for them (this tastes that good!) or will serve over rice or noodles.  Will try to freeze some, if my husband doesn't insist on eating it tomorrow as well:-). Its a 5 star with my changes!

The liquid from the beef weakened the barbecue sauce as it cooked so I just poured it off when I forked the beef and added another batch of barbecue mixture. I did use 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/4 because I like a sweet barbecue!! SO DELICIOUS!!!

I doubled the recipe to serve a big group, and my crockpot wasn't big enough.   So I cut the roasts into smaller chunks, trimmed off most of the fat, and browned all the pieces in a skillet (as others suggested).  Then I put the chunks in a large Dutch oven (a fancy name for a big, old, brown and round, heavy, glass Pyrex dish with a lid my Mom handed down to me) with the sauce ingredients, covered with lid, and baked at 200 degrees for 10 hours overnight. We all survived the night, and the house didn't burn down.  So, in the morning, I shredded the beef, placed it back in the Dutch oven with the sauce, and put it back in the oven at 200 degrees until I was ready to serve it for lunch.  I cut down some on the vinegar too.  This is not your typical, sweet, thick "BBQ Beef" - it's more like "Sassy Beef" - thin and saucy with a kick .

Extremely easy, and tastes great.  Really love that this recipe isn’t just “dump bbq sauce on meat” and has a real nice balance of flavors to go with the meat. Had it on toasted rolls and I made a side of coleslaw to go with it. Will be making it for sure again and trying it with different meats!

Cutting the meat up first and relentless fat trimming took care of the fat issue. I plan to spice it up a bit the next time.

Great! It was a hit! Might make it again just by swapping having to make the sauce with just using a big bottle of Baby Ray’s or something, but simple and quick to make anyway!

Really good.  I don't normally keep dijon mustard in the house so I substituted it for ground mustard and a tablespoon of water.  Still came out excellent.  Will definitely be repeating.

The taste was good but next time I’ll cook the meat alone, drain the grease, then add the sauce in the last hour. As written it’s too greasy and the freezing trick didn’t work for me.

I followed the suggestions of making 1 day in advance and trimming off the fat before cooking. Other great suggestions: cook it on high at the end to make it more crisp and when putting it on a bun, add bbq sauce. I loved it in a salad -- bbq beef salad! yum. My family is asking for it again because it went too quickly when we had a staff party.

I used two pounds of meat and the sauce mix and it was yummy.    Easy to make and the whole family enjoyed it.  My brother said is the best BBQ  he has ever had. A definite make again.  It would be great for a potluck.

Loved this! Easy and flavorful. I cut the meat in chunks and removed all visible fat. I seared it before adding to slow cooker and I also added a chopped onion. As others suggested, I cut down on the red wine vinegar. This one will be in my favorites to make again and again.

Wow, very surprised at how good this turned out.  I've never made any kind of beef brisket or pot roast before.  I used a 1lb roast for my first attempt and reduced the recipe accordingly.  My crock pot low setting is very hot so after 6 hours I checked the roast and it was perfect.  So tender, it completely fell apart when I shredded it with a fork.  I toasted our burger buns and served with a side of 4 cheese macaroni.  This recipe will be in my regular rotation!

This was as great. I used Chuck. I put in bell peppers, fresh garlic, and jalepeno in the pot with the Chuck. I cooked it on low for 8 hours drained some of the juice, shredded it and put my favorite store bought bbq sauce on it and cooked it on high for two hours. it was awesome!

Even my little kids who are difficult to get to eat meat thoroughly enjoy this meat. It's become a family favourite.

Hickory BBQ sauce works if you don't have liquid smoke flavouring. I couldn't tell the difference between batches.

Very tasty and full of flavor.  I did make one minor change and that was to add 2 Tbsp of Sriracha to the  recipe.   Near the end of the cooking time (around 9 hours) it appeared a little soupy so I left it uncovered for the last hour.  Very easy, truly a set it and forget it recipe that will give you a very tasty BBQ beef sandwiches.  They are even better the next day!

This is my go-to recipe for crowd pleasing dishes.  Makes a lot of sandwiches and always gets compliments.  Any left-overs can be reheated and served on sandwich buns.

This was fantastic. It was really easy to make, and tasted delicious. I will definitely make this again. I paired it with sweet potato fries for that summer barbecue feel.

We thought this was delicious! After shredding the meat, I drained off as much of the grease as I could and mixed in a bit more BBQ sauce, which worked out great! Served on buns with homemade slaw and pickled jalapeno slices~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was an easy recipe to throw together. It had great flavor.  I did use apple cider vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar but only because I was out of it.   Great recipe.

As per some reviews I cooked the beef, chilled and then removed the excess fat. Added the sauce and reheated. Great flavor without all of the high fructose syrup.

Do yourself  a favor and follow some of the suggestions made by others.  Also add some extra seasoning on the meat because it is very bland.  Perhaps if I followed some of the suggestions it could have been better.  I don't think I will make this again

My husband hates ketchup so the only change I made in the sauce was that I only used one cup and doubled the liquid smoke. On some if the other reviews it was mentioned that it was greasy, so I just sliced off the fat and seared the outside before adding it to the crock. It came out juicy, super tender and not a bit of grease! I tried a bite and it's fantastic! Excited to destroy a beefy sammich w melty cheese on top! Yum!

Pretty good.  Not sure it's much better than doing the same thing with just a jar of store bought sauce.  Maybe healthier?  But I enjoyed it.

I roasted in a 275  oven for 2 hrs and drained the grease, then added the sauce and roasted another hour.  I will probably play around with this recipe as it was very tasty!

Very good, used leftovers for a barbequed beef pizza.  Next time maybe put the sauce in the freezer while shredding to remove the fat layer as someone mentioned, it was a little greasier than I would have liked-
Made again and removed the fat layer, just delish

1/16/2020: I only use 2 lbs beef tips for the amount of sauce, no liquid smoke.  I also liberally sprinkle meat with garlic powder, penzeys black pepper and penzeys BBQ 3000.  Topped with Velveeta Rotel dip. 1/2017: I was very surprised how delicious this is. I left out the liquid smoke and used beef tips. I served it over Beer Rolls with sesame seeds and vinaigrette Cole slaw.

I don't have a slow cooker so I made this in a baking bag in the oven, baked on high for about a half an hour and then low for 4 hours. It came out perfect. I cut into chunks and removed most of the fat, as other reviews suggested, I also used dry red wine instead of vinegar.

This was ok.  I used a rump roast because that was what I had handy, but it was kind of tough and didn't shred nicely like when I do pork roasts.  The flavor of the barbecue sauce was good, but I don't know that I would make it with beef again.  I think I would maybe try this with pork.

So easy yet so good (with changes suggested by other reviewers.   I cut excess fat off of Chuck roast before cooking. Agreed that sauce as written tasted too much like ketchup so I added more vinegar, worcestershire and yellow (not dijon) mustard.  My grown children loved this and even asked for the recioe!

It was delicious! My son, who normally doesn't enjoy eating all that much (I really don't know what happened - he may've been switched at birth), said that he loved the beef! I only had cubed beef chuck, roughly 1.5 lbs - so I cut all the ingredients in half, seared the beef first in pan, then put that, diced carrots, onions, and potatoes in my ricecooker and slow cooked it for about 10 hours (I didn't have a slow cooker), fork-tore the meat, then put it in a hamburger bun for my son, replete with broiled corn and mango juice. I did have to add some water in the rice cooker, just enough so everything is submerged. It was delicious and a perfect summery meal!

I made this exactly as written, flavor was great, the sauce was too watery... I served this on buns and they were soggy. If I make this again, I will have to drain the meat before serving.

I was looking for something other than pot roast to do with my chuck roast and I'm so glad I found this recipe! It was delicious! The only thing I did differently was cut the meat into chunks to remove some of the fat and added a little diced green peppers and onion. I'll definitely make this again.
Edit: I just made this again for a get together, except I used pork shoulder this time. It was even better! Everyone loved it! Thanks for the great recipe!

Doubled the meat ( about 7.5 lbs.), quadrupled the sauce (used 1 cup KC Masterpiece for equal amount called for catsup), used a little less Worcestershire sauce as I ran out).  Trimmed a lot of fat off roasts and cut in large chunks.

I followed recipe exactly and it came out wonderful! and, so easy!! I did take the lid off my crock pot the last 15 minutes of cook time, then turned the pot off and let the meat sit for another 10 minutes or so--' stirring the meat and sauce mixture occasionally.   This allowed the sauce to thicken and incorporate into the meat. The left overs were even better the next day.

Loved it, and the sauce was great (though I did cut the vinegar in half), and I used a London broil. Turned out perfectly. Just add a little water to the meat when its nearing completion. A-1 recipe.

Easy and yummy. The only thing I left out was the liquid smoke. To reduce the grease I skimmed some off when I got home from work and again as I shredded the meat. I cooked it on high with the lid off for an hour or two and the sauce consistency was good. Will make again!

1.13.16   Chuck roast is a flavorful cut of meat, but it also can be fatty. I was lucky enough to have a fairly lean one, but I still  trimmed as much of the fat off of the meat as I could which helped in keeping it from getting too greasy.   The sauce takes no time at all to mix up, and gives you a delicious BBQ sandwich.  It does take a long time to become tender, so get it into the slow cooker early in the day.  We liked it, and it was a nice break from all of the pulled pork that you see everywhere these days.

I used this with leftover pork roast.  Heated up leftover pork roast stovetop with a bit of water.  Steamed about 5 min or so to soften up enough to shred.  Threw all sauce ingredients in a container, hit with the immersion blender and poured into the pan with the shredded beef.  Simmered about 20 min.  Quick dinner and the sauce put a great twist on the previous nights left overs.   Simple,  good BBQ sauce.  I didn't think too vinegary, but I'm a big user of flavored vinegars too.

This was very good.  I took one reviewer's suggestion and cooked it in the oven.  I roasted it at 350 for 1 hour, removed it and poured out all of the fat that had accumulated.  I then added the sauce (I doubled the recipe, but wound up not using quite all of it) and continued roasting at 225 for another approximately 3 hours.  I kept checking it until I was able to pull the meat apart with two forks.  There was some fat in the sauce but not a significant amount.  I poured out nearly 2 cups after the first hour, though, so I think it is important to not add the sauce with the raw meat.  My cut was marbled so it was not easy to trim.  Delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was very bland.  Using chuck roast was a poor choice as it was fatty and tough.  I made it for a party, and it was very sub standard to the point of being embarrassing.  What a waste of money.

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe and only strayed from it by taking the tip to cook it for an hr with a lid off after it was shredded to thicken the sauce. The sauce was still a little thin but overall it was good and I'll probably make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly  ..Even measured each ingredient .  This is the second time I used this recipe and this time I had a frozen roast. I took it right from the freezer.  High temp for 5 hours,  low temp for 2 hours.  Absolutely delicious.

I made this with a 1/2-lb breakfast steak and 2 servings, for just myself. It came out WONDERFUL! I cut back on the vinegar, as some suggested, it was fine. I also added a small amount of olive oil to the mix. I will be making THIS.again!

I loved the ease and the unique taste of this Barbecued Beef recipe. Slow cooking a chuck roast for the alotted time was tender and  shredded just right for our sandwiches. Tangy, moist and alittle messey made this a hit for halftime football parties.  The only change was braising the chuck on the grill before slow cooking.

love! Husband and super picky toddler loved this beef. Only change I made to ingredients was the mustard,I only had stone ground mustard on hand. I followed a reviewers recommendation and poured the sauce into a bowl and froze it after cooking in order to remove some fat, was able to scrape it right off. I also wish I would have started the crock pot two hours earlier to make it more tender. I wasn't a huge fan of the fat on the roast, I think next time ill try a less fatty cut. This recipe is awesome, inexpensive and very delicious!

This was so delish!  Really, really good!  I did only two things different: 1) I slow cooked the beef; removed it from the pot when done; shredded it; dumped all the gunk and fat from the pot; returned the beef to the pot; then added the sauce.  2) Instead of garlic powder, I used fresh minced garlic.

was a major hit.  used top round london broil which was on sale.  cooked for a large crowd so made one batch in crock pot, second batch cooked overnight in oven at 285. delicious!  added a little water as a precaution - not necessary.  Meat released plenty of liquid.

I used a bottom round instead of the chuck roast and I cooked it as directed, overnight in a crockpot.  The meat was very tender and came apart easily while I was shredding it with a fork and it was not fatty at all (except for the fat on the bottom, which I removed before cooking).  However, when I tasted it, it did seem to be a bit grainy or mealy (not sure how to describe the texture).  Maybe it was the type of meat I used.  Also, the ketchup mixture was a bit too acidic for me, so after I shredded the beef, I added some more brown sugar to the mixture before returning the beef to the mixture for the last hour of cooking.  Hopefully, we won't notice the texture while eating it on the buns.  Overall, I like the process of cooking the meat with the mixture over it.

Recipe was a bit sweet for my taste, but was as easy and good as all of the comments had stated. Came out very tender, juicy and flavorful.

Really good, my family loved it.  I used cubed stew meat after reading that the chuck roast was a bit fatty.  It couldn't have been easier!

Good flavor, but cooked it for 9 hours and it was dry.  I'm beginning to think that my crock pot runs too hot because everything comes out too dry.

This is a keeper!   The meat just fell apart at the end and is so tender.  Flavor is superb, and everyone in the house was happy for a change.  And boy did the house smell good all day!

this was awesome, just the right amount of sauce for my 3 lb roast. Probably would make more sauce if I had found a 4 pound roast.  EXCELLENT and was devoured by all.

We absolutely loved the sauce.  I didn't find it to be too thin, possibly because I didn't use a slow cooker.  I cooked it in a dutch oven on the stovetop over low heat for about 6 hours.  I'm giving this five stars because it is a good recipe, but this would taste waaaaaaay better if you used the recipe for pork instead of beef.  I'll definitely keep this recipe for the sauce, but I'll only use it to cook pork.

This is my husband's all-time favorite dish that I make.  We've made this countless number of times, and I always double it so that we have leftovers.  The sauce is delicious.  Our advice is to toast your sandwich buns and then eat it quick before they can get soggy!

this was really good.  I used a rump roast because i couldnt find a chuck roast.  I also skimmed the fat oil off the top before i shredded the beef.  Then towards the end of cooking i added an onion.  I made yummy sandwiches out of it.

I cooked the meat with a few cups of vegetable stock and one chopped onion. I mixed the sauce separately, drained the onion/stock mixture and added the sauce to the meat for about a half hour before serving.  I wasn't a huge fan but my family raved about it and there were no leftovers!  The sauce is very tangy so if you prefer something a little sweeter or low key I'd suggest mixing in your favorite bottled bbq sauce. Overall the meat was very tender, the sauce was just a little overpowering for my taste.

I kept recipe as written but only made 2 1/4 lbs of beef.  Next time, I'd reduce the liquid.  The reason for only 4 stars?  It was too much vinegar!  I would cut it in half because it was too strong.  Otherwise, a nice quick meal.  :)

I am an experienced cook and I can tell you quite honestly that this was a complete waste of time.  Even with cooking the meet on low and slow it came out as tough as shoe leather.  Do not waste your hard earned money on making this dish.

This had a strong ketchup taste for me. I think next time I would reduce the ketchup and add more liquid smoke for a more bbq type flavor. It needs more onion and garlic. It was lacking in flavor and punch. the sauce was very greasy even fter trimming the beef of excess. It was also not very thick. Just to much tomato to be bbq in this Texans book... I would have been better off using bottled sauce and saving the trouble. Sorry it just did not work for me.

I doubled this recipe for a superbowl party and everyone loved it.  Needless to say there was not a drop left so it made cleanup extremely easy.  I had to use two slowcookers but once I shredded the beef and cleaned off some of the fat I was able to combine them into one crockpot for the last hour. I will DEFINITELY make this again!

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday and it was a hit. I had put this in the crock pot over night and it cooked for about 12 hours. In the morning I added flour to some of the sauce to thicken it up and it really helped. I also added a bottle of bbq sauce. This made the sauce too sweet for me but the guys loved it at the party. I also toasted the buns in the oven so they didn't get soggy.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I made up the sauce and poured it over a left over roast that I had shredded.....and cooked it on low for a couple of hours.  I substituted Curleys BBQ sauce for the ketchup.  The taste reminded me of the A & W Barbequed beef sandwiches that my Grandparents used to get for me many moons ago.  Thanks for the great recipe, it's a keeper at our house!!

This was my first time making barbecued beef.  Yum.  I used an (almost) 3 pound roast, but kept the liquid ingredients as the standard recipe stated.  So glad I did, or it would have dried out.  Will definitely make this again, the three people I made it for each had two sandwiches.  Thanks!

Here in Texas there is a place called Rudy's that serves the best brisket period. Just like Rudy’s this brisket falls apart and melts in you mouth with a hint of fiery spice and a smoky powerful flavor. I made one substation to this recipe and it was extremely close to the best I've had. I highly recommend adding 1 1/2 cup Heine’s Thick and Spicy barbeque sauce instead of the ketchup.

Really good, just like the beef you get at Sonny's.  I think next time i may double up on the liquid smoke.

This was great!  I especially loved the barbeque sauce.  Next time, I'm going to try a brisket or an arm roast.

Yuck this was horrible.  The sauce is runny, unless you have the whole 10 hours to cook this.

I have made this a few times for family gatherings and once for my son's birthday party and it has always been a huge hit and goes REALLY fast. We never have leftovers when I make this. The meat is moist and juicy and there's just the right amount of sauce. I think the ingredients are really great, but I prefer my BBQ sauce to have a little bit of a bite to it so I added 1/2 tp of chili molido powder to it.

This recipe is a keeper.  The only thing I did differently was add about 1/2 cup of bbq sauce.  The meat is so tender and tasty, and the sauce is delicious.  I'll definitely be making this one again.

Loved this recipe.  Hubby was very happy and looking forward to lunch today (he takes leftovers!).  Served this with my homemade macaroni salad and Baked Potato Wedges from this site.  Will definitely make again.  P.S.  Yes, the sauce is a little thin, but I think it's supposed to be that way.  We liked it that way, anyhow.

This was pretty good. I just shredded the beef right in the crockpot, mixed it with the sauce and put the lid back on for about 1/2 hour. I will try a few other recipes but may come back to this one.

Another keeper!  I thought it was great! 
I had bought some small chuck steaks in the reduced idle at the grocery store.  They were each about a pound, for $2.35.  I used both and it made plenty!  My husband and son had left overs the next day and we froze some.  Very easy to make, too.  TY!

This was amazing! I'm giving it a 4/5 because I did use 1 cup BBQ sauce and 1/2 cup ketchup instead of all ketchup, and I added half of a green pepper, chopped, near the end. I always try to throw some extra type of vegetable in, and the green pepper complimented the flavour of this dish very nicely! I will DEFINITELY be making this reegularly.

Really great, easy to make sandwiches. I agree with other reviewers that A mix of half ketchup, half bbq sauce should be used, but other than that we really enjoyed these.

The best BBQ Beef I have ever had! Followed the recipe exactly and the sauce is a little bit thin but soooo savory and bold! I will try adding a bit of flour to thicken it up a bit and a splash of hot sauce next time. DEFINATELY a new favorite! A 10 star dish! Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good!  I made this for a potluck and everyone raved about it.  After I took out the meat to shred it, I added flour to the sauce to take away the grease.  It turned out very nicely after I mixed in the shredded meat.  I will be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe.

So easy.  Very tender. Any fat on the roat was easily scraped off, then we
shredded the beef and served it on toasted buns as the recipe suggest.  The left over we are going to use for enchilads.

I had a piece of brisket that I bought on special offer, my husband was pulling faces and complaining that brisket is always tough. I cooked this as stated apart from adding 2tsp of cornstarch to the sauce when I put the shredded meat back in. When my husband ate it he said I can't believe how tender this is and after 2 more mouthfuls he said before you ask 6 stars. Thankyou.

Very good and very easy to make. Did follow another cooks advice and used the last hour to thicken sauce a bit by turning on high and leaving the lid off.

Pretty good - I used an arm roast as that's what I had.  On high for 5 hours, literally fell apart!  what I liked best about this recipe was that I had everything on hand!

Excellent recipe!!! Very good just as it reads. However, next time I would use a leaner cut of beef (spent a bunch of time scraping fat before I shredded the meat and I had to skim some fat from the top of the cooker). The only change I made was to double the smoke flavor stuff. I made this for guests and got rave reviews!! YUMMY!!!

I needed something to do with my beef ribs so I boiled them and then shredded them, took off as much fat as I could, and scaled this sauce down to what I had. I didn't have the wine vinegar nor the liquid smoke and it still turned out great. I had to add a little extra water to get the consistancy that I wanted and add a little more pepper to even out the salt. Served it on wheat buns and it was really good. Next time I will do as the recipe said, omitting the salt and the vinegar. If it was this good now, I will defenitely do this again with the right stuff. Thanks!

This was yummy! I used 1/2 cups of ketchup and 1 cup of barbecue sauce. I cooked it on high for 4 1/2 hours, and 1/2 hour after shredding the beef. I will definitely make it again, next time with pork.

Delicious!!! I only had 1/4 c. ketchup so used that and substituted the rest of it with chili sauce. The sauce was watery so after removing the meat to shred (and before placing it back in), I whisked in a mixture of 1/4 c. water and 2 tbsp cornstarch to thicken it. Thanks!

This beef turned out so tender and flavorful! I followed the recipe exactly, and served them straight from the slow-cooker to the bun, without adding any extra barbecue sauce. I'll definitely be making this again, I may try with pork next time.

This was great! I made it with stewing beef and browned it before putting it in the slow cooker. I had cut the recipe in half because thats how much beef I had on hand. Next time I will need to make the whole thing. My kids devoured it!! I increased the red wine vinegar a little. I also used Wasabi mustard. This was fantastic and will be making it again very soon!

This was a great recipe.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I used pork instead of beef.  It was great with pork as well.  However, I did find that I needed to cook on high for the amount of time called for instead of low like the recipe says.  Not sure if that was due to the type of meat or my crockpot. I also used regular mustard since I didn't have any dijon on hand.  Will definetely make again and this time try it with beef.

Wonderful.  Didn't stray at all from the instructions except mine was so tender after 8 hours I didn't need a fork to shred it.  Made for my visiting family to rave reviews!

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I used pork. The pork I bought fell into chunks after I opened the package(it was labeled for bbq use) that made it fit well into the sauce.. I occasionally sturred while it cooked on low and It never got a hard cooked "ring" around the side. The meat fell apart if I just poked it with my wooden spoon, so it was very easy to shred. I served it on hamburger buns. My two boys couldnt get enough! thankyou so much for this recipe!! the flavor is excellent! brisket is also good in this sauce. I've made the sauce alone for other bbq recipies.

This was great!  I didn't have liquid smoke flavouring and it was still good.  I added flour in the last 2 hours of cooking to thicken the sauce.  I will definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe but made just a few changes to it, One thing I did do differently is I used a 2lb chuck roast and added about a 1/4 cup more of brown sugar at the end. My family likes real saucy stuff and LOVED this recipe!!!! Thanks so much for a quick, wonderful smelling recipe. Yummyyy

I enjoyed this recipe - I found it pretty easy to make and it was great for a Sunday night supper during the winter.  My husband just said that it was just "okay", hence the 3 star rating.  I think I will try it again - maybe it will be better the second time around.

I have made this for years but mix beef and pork. Sometimes the pork gets a little dry but mixed with the beef you get an exra tasty BBQ sandwich.

This is a great recipe if you are serving a crowd! I doubled the amount of sauce and used about 2/3 of it to cook the meat in, and saved the other 1/3 to serve with the sandwiches. The meat turned out just right, with great flavor! Also, I used a rump roast instead of a chuck roast, and it turned out great.

This was Sooooooo good!! The house smelled wonderful, and the roast was as tender as could be. The only thing I would add is if you want a healthier meal, be sure to skim off any excess fat. It seemed that the bbq sauce didn't get to totally marinate the roast because of the excess fat. We had leftovers and there was a lot of fat, but we skimmed it off and it was still an EXCELLENT dinner! 

Thanks for sharing! We'll definately make this again!

YUM!  This recipe is incredible.  And it makes the house smell so good as it is cooking. I broiled rolls in the oven with swiss cheese on them and then added the bbq beef to them.  Everyone loved them and I will definitely make it again!

The was okay, but not the best BBQ Beef we've ever had.  We added additional bottled bbq sauce to it because we thought it was a little dry. I made it exactly as written.

This good BBQ!  If this took 3 minutes to prepare I'd be surprised.  Very simple yet the flavor is deliciously tangy and juicy!  Would go great with potato salad, cole slaw, chips.

This recipe was excellent!! I made the sauce the day before (to save time on a busy work/school morning). Served on potato rolls with cole slaw on top. The meat was so tender. Just a delicious BBQ beef recipe. Family loved it.....it was great leftover the next day! Thanks Corwynn!

Delicious! I cooked the Barbecued Meatballs from this website and wanted a homemade BBQ sauce instead of commercially made one on that recipe and this one was very easy and tasted perfect.  Next time I'll make it with the beef and I'm sure it will be just as good.

Very good, and very easy.  My instinct was to brown the beef first, but after looking at several similar recipes I decided to take the chance on not doing so. Turns out that the meat really doesn't need it.  So that's a big bonus for a busy morning!

Search no more! This is the BEST BBQ beef I've ever tasted! Easy to put together and tasty. The sauce was wonderful, we don't care for bottled sauce so I will be making this for other dishes. I served them on toasted sesame buns and onion slices. Family loved them!! Will make often. Thanks!

I made this for a huge amount of people. I doubled the recipe and made it in two different crockpots and then after it was cooked down and shredded I combined them and kept it warm in just one. Truthfully, it doesn't look that yummy but OH MY GOSH it tastes great! Everyone loved it and there was hardly any left. Shredding the beef is a little time consuming but not that bad. There is a reason this is rated so high! Make it for your next potluck, reunion, family event and you will be a hit!

This was very easy and the taste was very good.  The meat was tougher than I anticipated, but that could have been the cut of meat.  I will make again.

The recipe is awesome!  And the sauce, YUMMY!...no more bottled stuff for us!  My 6 year old kept eating it by the spoonful.  Made it exactly as written.  Next time I will make more of everything to store in the freezer.  Thanks for sharing!

This was OK, but I expected more from it's rave reviews.  I would use a brisket next time, as the meat was a little tough.  I did like the ease of the crock pot however, and the bbq sauce had a good flavor.

Excellent recipe!  Very easy to prepare and the house smelled great.  I also cut the liquid smoke to 1/4 tsp. and will do so again next time I make it.  The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars was because it was a tough sell to the kids.

All of the reviews are right, this is a great recipe!  The flavor was wonderful - I wouldn't change a thing.  I did thicken the sauce with a bit of cornstach and water during the last hour of cooking as several people suggested, but I'm not sure if that would have been necessary. Next time I will make it without thickening.

This was very good and easy.  Because my husband is not much of a beef eater, I had only planned to make this once.  After putting the sauce together, I threw the recipe in the trash.  When I served this the next day, he said it reminded him of a sandwich he had when he was a kid that he loved.  So, I had to print another copy and file it under "keeper"!

This is AMAZING!  It's so easy and great to make for large crowds.  I made a few "crock pots" full and froze ahead of time for a big party.  Everybody LOVED this and asked for the recipe.  So easy and so delicious!  The whole house smells good while cooking.  Thanks so much for a real "crowd pleaser"! ~Ruth

Great- used a 3 lb roast, make sure your roast is lean. I also used 1/2 c. brown sugar & cut all fat off- cutting roast in pieces if necessary.

Great recipe.  Don't change a thing.  You can use a pork shoulder or even chicken.  Thanks.

This recipe is always a winner at my house for kids and adults alike.  I usually use a 3-4 lb. pork shoulder instead of beef and it is great.  You do need to take the lid off the crock pot the last hour or so to let the sauce thicken up.  Thanks for a great recipe.

OMG!!! Soooo tasty and sooo tender!!! I was out of brown sugar so I used white sugar instead of the brown. I was also out of peper so nixed that AND I also ran short of Worsterchire so only 1 tbs made it in. Guess I need to keep better stock of my kitchen. LOL! Everyone loved this though and I expect that it will reheat nicely too. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

My son heard he and his brother were having roast beef for dinner..and wasn't pleased.  After it was made and put on a bun for him we went wild.  I didn't alter anything except used yellow mustard.  My husband and I would prefer it with more spice...but it was perfect for the teenagers.
Thank you so much for a great dinner to fix that they both loved!!

Yup, it's as good as all these folks say it is.  :)  I added just a little more brown sugar, some yellow mustard and then thickened with corn starch before I put the beef back in.  Ohmigosh, this was good!

It was good...and very easy to make but a little too much ketchup flavour.  I would try next time with 1/2 ketchup, 1/2 BBQ sauce.

Sloppy Joes are just too boring and bland...this was the best replacement.  I work full time and the hubby was home on disability, so I gave him the recipe and said "Have at it!".  It turned out GREAT...and he doesn't even know how to make macaroni and cheese from the blue box!  Thank you Corwynn for an awesome family recipe!

I've rated this before and had to come back and rate again. This is soooo delicious and has become a family favorite. I made the sauce last night, but used boneless beef short ribs instead of a chuck roast and cooked for 8 hours on low and they were soooo yummy. Be creative with this sauce, people, you won't regret it!

Much better than those expensive 'tubs' at the grocers! Wonderful with home made buns (if you have the time). I add minced onion to mine, more garlic, Cajun seasoning for kick, and a mix of Balsamic Vinegar and regular, instead of the wine vin. It's the only BBQ Beef we have anymore. Thank you soooo much!

My fam prefers to taste the meat first, so I omitted adding the sauce during the roasting and opted to serve it separately on the side.  (The meat was easier to clean since it was sauce-less.)I did use just a touch of the sauce to moisten the meat before serving.  With sauce on the side and a bowl of cold coleslaw, it made an easy and tasty dinner!

This was fabulous! Made it last night along with the restaurant style coleslaw from this site...which is the best and we all loved it. The only thing I found is after that many hours in the crockpot that....most of the sauce evaporated. Not a problem though because all I did after it was done was to....make more! After I made another batch of sauce....I poured it over the shredded meat and let it soak in until we were ready to eat dinner. Yummy, yummy!!!!

OMG!! I don't care that there were over 300 other reviews!! I had to say something--I will never, ever use another BBQ beef recipe again. This one is perfect! I made it as written and wouldn't change a thing! Thanks so much for making me the hit of my St. Patty's Day party.

This was great. I took the advice of others and cut most of the fat from my roast before putting in the crock pot. I also left out the liquid smoke. I don't think we missed it. I toasted some buns with garlic and herb butter and put the meat mixture in. My husband loved it, and was very happy to see leftovers go in the freezer. He kept going on about how he wanted to try it with venison, or add peppers and onions to it, or add potatoes and such to make a stew. Very quick, very easy, makes a bunch. I will make again. Thanks for a new way to cook a roast!

Wow!!! This is unbelievably delicious! I followed the recipe to the letter and I was delighted with the results. You can use any cut of meat because when you take it out to shred the meat, you can easliy remove all the excess fat. enjoy!!

I made this recipe in my crockpot exactly to specifications.  The meat was very tender, however it was very chewy.  It could have been the cut of chuck roast that I had.  My husband loved this.  I would try this again, but maybe with a different type of meat.

YUM!  Took this to what became the 1st ever Helpdesk tailgate pitch-ing (It's now an annual event!)  EVERYONE loved it.  I had people "complaining" that it was smelling up the entire office!  (I brought it in, still in the crock pot to keep warm.)  Followed suggestions in the reviews, and it was wonderful.  Will make again.

Really, really good.  I altered the recipe a bit by adding 1/2 c Heintz tabasco ketchup with the  regular ketchup (to spice it up a bit), 3 cloves of garlic instead of the powdered garlic, and an extra tsp. of liquid smoke.  This recipe can be played with and you still get excellent results.  I was a little worried because it looked so soupy.  But once the beef is shredded it all works out.  Next time I would make more sauce.

WOW!  This is one of the BEST bbq beef recipes I've ever had!  We made this for dinner, and the kids were scrambling to claim seconds for lunch the next day.  We made a bigger roast for a get together at our house, and the recipe was requested frequently.  I'm still emailing it to friends and family.  You can't go wrong on this one.

I didn't even need a sandwich to enjoy this. Sauce is thick. Meat breaks apart easily when it has cooked long enough (if you have difficulty separating it, it probably hasn't cooked long enough). Taste is incredible.

This is the greatest!  It's little fuss & it brings the best compliments to the chef.  I needed to make something for a home poker game and this was the perfect choice!  We liked it so much, I made it again for a small super bowl party.  Friends & family have asked for the recipe.  Thanks, Corwynn.

This barbeque was awesome!  We made another batch of the sauce to serve with the barbeque.  The sauce is great!  This is great for a busy Satuday of kids sports.  It was great to come home and have a wonderful meal instead of being tempted to eat out.

Awesome recipe, so easy and very tasty.  Got rave reviews from our guests.  I threw everything in my 18qt roaster (my roast was 11+ lbs) for over 12 hrs on low, super tender!

I love slow cooker recipes. Throw everything in the pot and come back 8 hours later. This was delicious. We put it on hamburger buns and gobbled it up. I loved the sauce. The bottled BBQ sauces are a little too strong for this kind of recipe. This was delicious!

This recipe is great!  We loved it.  I did make two batches of sauce.  I cooked the meat in one batch, removed it when I shredded the beef, added the new batch of sauce for the last hour and added some of the old sauce as needed.  It worked out really well.

This recipe was so easy and so flavorful.  My husband said "I out did myself" on this one.  I was afraid that 1 tsp of liquid smoke would be too strong as our family is not big into the smoky flavor but it turned out great.

I loved this recipe, it was very easy, and good as leftovers too. Next time I will try cutting the beef up into cubes before I cook it, so it will shred a little easier. Very nice while shredding because you can pick any tiny piece of fat out! (I'm picky lol).

Very Good. Double the sauce: Drain the meat and then add more sauce. I didn't cook it an extra hour. Maybe 15 minutes to 1/2 an hour. My husband did not like it, though.

The easiest barbecue beef ever! And the flavor is out of this world. I didn't add the liquid smoke and it still had plenty of flavor. The beef shreds easily and you can discard the fat.

This recipe was very easy, but I was disapointed w/ the flavor of the sauce.  It was too bland.  I added some store-bought barbeque sauce to zip it up a little.

My family and friends enjoyed this recipe for super bowl. The only change I made was to cook on high for 5 hrs. and then switch to low. Also, I made the double batch of sauce to mix after I shredded the beef throwing away the old.

WOW! Everyone has got to try this recipe.  It was so good and so easy.  I pre-made my sauce the night before and before going to work I through it all in the crock pot, when I got home it smelled so good and tasted even better.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

My family loved this bbq.  My husband, who is very picky about bbq, said it's the best he's ever had - including some hot bbq restaurants we've been to - THAT'S a compliment.  The kid-friendly rating is one star short of perfect, just b/c it's a liiiiitle spicy for little ones.  But aside from that - PERFECT!

This was amazing and I am weary of recipes i haven't tried before.  I halved it, used bottom round roase instead, and added a can of tomato paste.  I might add onions next time.

I only put in 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke...it was delicious!!!  If you're planning on trimming off excess fat before you start, you might want to get more than the 4 pounds.  I didn't get any extra, but after trimming off the fat, the finished product was very saucey.

I got a new crockpot for Christmas, so I tried it out with this recipe.  I thought it was pretty good when it came out of the pot. The next day I thought it was very good, and the third day I was in love!  I altered the recipe by adding about  half a recipe of sauce to the liquid before the last hour of simmering.  It tastes really great on a crusty bun with bread and butter pickles.  I will make this again, for my manly-man nephews.  But next time I'll add onions because they improve anything.

First I cut the recipe in half. Real mild taste. I used tomato sauce for half the ketchup and thick BBQ sauce for the rest of the ketchup. Family loved it. It made enough for 2 meals for this family of 3.

Seemed to be missing something... maybe tomato paste/sauce or some onions.  Seemed a little bland.

I added some BBQ sauce to the ingredients and browned the meat first-I used lean chuck steaks and it came out very tender and tasty.

Finally --a barbecue sauce my husband loved that he didn't make!!  He really was impressed  with the sandwiches. The following week I made it with pork but it wasn't quite as good. Knowing how good the sauce is, I don't even mind shredding the roast! If anyone likes great barbecue, give the one a try, you will love it!

This is the best barbecued beef my family & I have ever had.  The meat was tender & fell apart when shredding it.  The BBQ sauce was perfect & very easy to make.  My family loved it...especially my husband.

Made only the sauce the first time to use on leftover roast.  My husband loved it and he's hard to please when it comes to BBQ.  My 3-yr-old found it a bit spicy.

This was great.  My husband, who is from the South and knows BBQ, loved this!  I served this on onion kaiser rolls.  And so easy...I already had all the ingredients but the meat and the liquid smoke.

Best homemade BBQ sauce recipie I've found.  We're a small family, so I cut the recipie in half which worked fine (and didn't take as soon to cook).  Leftovers are great on baked potatoes.

This was so tender and wonderful. I didn't make the second batch of sauce because I prefer my sauce a little thinner. It was perfect!

My husband loved this dish. I didn't have the liquid smoke so I just left it out. I used chuck steak and it just fell apart. The sauce was great on mashed potatoes.

Excellent Recipe!
I will definately make this again!
My daughter(11) and son (4) enjoyed some on a bun and then asked for some on the side to eat with a fork.
This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!!

This was delicious and enjoyed by my whole family.  I followed the advice of others and made two batches of sauce.  One to cook in and be drained off and the other to be added to the cooked meat the last hour or so.  Great flavor!

This is a great recipe! I served it for a small dinner party and everyone loved it. We will definately have this over and over. May try pork next time. Also doubled sauce and poured extra 1/2 over beef after I shredded it.

My family LOVED this.  I put the meat on French rolls that I had buttered, garliced and toasted.  We all loved it (even a very picky 6 year old).My husband asked if we could have it again real soon, like next week!  What was nice is that it made enough for two meals for my family and so I just froze the meat in the sauce and I have a great dinner already made for next week!!

This recipie was so easy and tasted great.  My husband and I both loved it.  It has a much better flavor than our local barbeque stand and it was so easy!  I just mixed up the sauce and put everything in the crockpot before I left for work, and dinner was ready when I got home.  I'd recommend this to anyone, and in fact, already have sent the link to several people.

This was tasty. I didn't cook the meat long enough so the shredding was difficult, so be sure you leave it in there a long time.

All my guests enjoyed this recipe including my 3 year old.  I too made a double batch of the sauce, cooked it in half of it.  I then drained it and served it with the remaining half.  It was perfect.  This is a keeper!

Very Good.  The comments are right about not having enough sauce, so I just passed bottled sauce with the sandwiches at the table for those who wanted more sauce.

This is FANTASTIC!!!!! The longer it sits in the fridge, the better it gets!!! By day three 
we were in love. I made up an extra batch of sauce and added it to the crock pot about an hour before it 
was done, to thicken it up a bit, but I didn't remove any of the cooking sauce, it came out great and I will 
suggest it to everyone! Thank you so much for the great recipe!!

Oh my goodness!  This was soooo good.  I mixed two separate containers of sauce last night.  Put the roast in the crock along with one batch of sauce this morning.  I came home after work, and could believe how tender this was.  I agree the sauce does get a little thin.  I was glad I made the extra batch as you suggested.  I kept the "drained" sauce on the side for those who wanted it.  It was excellent.  Even though it had a hint of vinegar in it, my husband detected it.  He does not like vinegar.  Next time, I will try reducing the vinegar to maybe an 1/8 cup.  Highly recommend you try this.  You'll be glad you did.

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a big hit...even with my picky kids.  One word of advice is to pick a good chuck roast because I've had some bad luck with tough roasts that had to cook alot longer.  This recipe is a keeper and will be passed on!

Excellent flavor! The sauce does get very thin so I poured it out and let it cook in a new batch the last hour. I think you could actually cook the roast alone and then add the sauce the last hour. That's what I'm going to do next time so I don't waste ingredients. The whole family loved it.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!!...my husband is VERY picky, he askes for this recipe at lease once a week!  And if you prepare the sauce the night before it takes about 5min to prepare the next morning(big plus for this working mom!)  I did follow the advise of some of the other reviewers, which helped out alot.  Especially the info about making two batches of sauce.  After it cooked all day in the first batch, I shredded the beef and emptied the crockpot, then put in the second batch of sauce along with the shredded beef and let it cook for another hour or so.  My husband bought some store made BBQ beef the other day...he had to throw it out cause he didn't like it!  You should definetly try this recipe...you won't be disappoined!

The meat was not as tender as we would have liked, but will try it again since other reviewers had such good results. Flavor was good. Made extra sauce and added at the end after draining the meat as suggested. Good idea.

I thought this was great.  The sauce was a liitle thin for sandwiches, but was perfect for serving over rice.  I added extra brown sugar and used garlic red wine vinegar.

This is a very tasty recipe.  It is also
very easy to prepare as the meat does
not require browning before going into
the crockpot.  We enjoyed it over rice.
I really recommend this crockpot recipe.

Like one of your other patrons, I am a southern girl who moved north....and have yet to find good BBQ....until now!  This recipe was amazing!  Like some of the others, I made a double batch of sauce and discarded about half of what was left after most of the cooking; and after shredding added the rest for the last hour of cooking.  YUM!!!

I used a 2 lb roast and used half the marinade for cooking then drained it and used the other half and heated it thru. It was very tender but a bit tart.  I might try balsamic vinegar next time. A very easy recipe that cook while you work.

Incredible! I just fixed this for a party and everyone just raved about it.  The other reviews were right on with the advice, make extra sauce for the end!  Fantastic recipe!

This was the best. My mouth still waters just thinking about it! I did find it a little salty, though. So nest time I'll leave out the salt and let the salt in the other ingrediants suffice. Love it, love it, love it!!!!

Wonderful recipe!  Also used the sauce as a "gravy" for mashed potatoes!  Very good!
