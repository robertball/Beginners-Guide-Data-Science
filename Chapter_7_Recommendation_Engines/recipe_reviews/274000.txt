My husband really liked these! I put a little cinnamon/sugar on the crust, too.

This was a very simple and sweet treat. I added more cinnamon and nutmeg to the apple filling for taste. Will be making these again but will cut and use real apples instead of the can filling for a better taste.

7.5.19  Response to francesd@comcast.net:  the egg wash will give you a golden brown crisp crust.  ***7.5.19  Response to Bruce Yanoshek:  I have a 2.75 qt air fryer, so it is not huge.  Instructions say to use 2-1/4-inch cutter, so I can fry 3 or 4 at a time.  These are mini pies,  just a couple bites.
