So, you need to try this. Don't soak the beans overnight. Black eyed peas don't need to soak. I used pork blade steaks (2) and one piece of bacon. I browned the pork with salt and pepper. I added the meat to my six cups of chicken stock/water mix. I sauteed the onion (2 small ones), 2 carrots, tons of garlic, the red pepper, and jalapeño, cumin and cayenne in the oil from the pork. I added that to the broth. Then, I put in a tablespoon or so of honey! I put in the black eyed peas and cooked on high for one hour and then turned it down to low and cooked another 5 1/2 or so. The last hour, I added an entire bunch of coarsely chopped kale. Served it with cornbread and honey to top the cornbread. Normally, I like cornbread crumbled in my beans; however, this was such a good soup, I didn't want to change the flavor with the sweetness of the bread. So, I ate it on the side. Oh, this dish was heaven! I froze the leftovers for when our baby arrives in about 4 weeks.......but I really struggled with that! I wanted to eat it for lunch and dinner tomorrow!

There's a thin line between watery & brothy. I like my black-eyes brothy (thick). I soaked mine for 6 hrs. Cooked them on high 6 1/2 hours in the crock-pot. Used 1 can of chicken broth in place of the cube (don't like cubes). Walked out to my garden for 3 different kinds of hot peppers. Left out the salt, I don't believe you need it with both ham & bacon. Hubbie said "Best beans ever".

I absolutely loved this meal.  At the start of the year I found out I have extremely high cholesterol and came seeking healthy foods.  I switched out the four strips of bacon for a couple of extra slices of lean ham (same weight but with the big clobs of fat) otherwise I left the recipe alone.  It deserves to be cooked slowly over 6-8 hours rather than being cooked on high.  Comments on the quantity of fluid seem overblown, probably because soaking the quantity of beans required for this recipe actually takes more than the a cup of water ... if you do pre-soak the beans you'll need to remove quite a bit more, however over 6-8 hours this isn't an issue.   I'm not sure why anybody would pre-soak these beans in water, when you can have them soften up nicely in the flavorful slow cooker.  I divide this into about six meals and throw it over fresh greens.  Awesome.

Good recipe, but needs some fixing: use chicken broth (low sodium) instead of bouillon which is salty. Don't add more salt because the ham and bacon is already salty enough. Six cups water (broth) is too much for my slow cooker, but might be enough for others. I have found not all slow cookers are created equal so know your slow cooker before adding the liquid. Personally, I think the oval shaped slow cookers can take a bit more water than those that are crock pot shaped. The crock pot shaped ones stand taller. The oval ones tend to absorb liquid more than the tall ones. All of that said, it is a delicious recipe. Great for the traditional dish of black eyed peas served on New Years Day.

Great recipe for black eyed peas and one of the main reasons I love them is there is NO need to soak them.   Gathering the ingredients, I realized I didn't have everything on hand and as I couldn't face going to the grocery store on New Years Eve (what a madhouse) I improvised.....   I subbed low sodium chicken broth for the water and bouillon; no jalapeno, so I increased the cayenne to 1 tsp; no onion, so I subbed one packet of Lipton onion soup mixture; and no ham, so I subbed two country pork ribs, along with the bacon.  Added an extra clove of garlic, 1 tsp of liquid smoke and increased the cumin to 2 tsps.  Shredded the pork into the peas when finished....  Delicious!!!  Husband who dislikes black eyed peas had two bowls!  I realize I changed the recipe to fit what I had on hand, but I can only imagine the original was excellent as well.  Definitely 5 stars!

Since our 7&9-yr olds won't eat spicy foods, I onitted the cayenne and jalapenos (and the bell peppers 'cause we're not fond of them). I slow-cooked the peas the first 3 hours on High and the next 2 hours on Low, with a hambone from a honeybaked ham from Christmas. Due to other reviews I only added 5 cups water and the mixture was still soupy. However,  the results are WONDERFUL and the honebaked hambone added a slightly sweet flavor, but not too sweet, just enough to make you come back for more. Thanks for the post!

This will be the 2nd New Years Day I have made this recipe and have also prepared it many times for our backyard BBQ's.  I also use chicken broth and not so much liquid.  Black eyes don't absorb that much.  Really tasty recipe.  Going to go great with my grilled chickens and cornbread.

Had I felt led to give this recipe a lower rating I would not have posted since I feel it is unfair to give a low rating when you do not follow the recipe as posted.  However, this was a hit and even though I made a few adjustments I am still posting a solid 4 star rating.

What caught my attention was the slow cooker cooking method and not so much the spiciness.  Not being a fan of spicy, I omitted the jalapeno (and the red pepper).  I also used canned chicken broth instead of the bouillon.  Otherwise I stuck with the recipe and the preparation/cooking method and thought the peas turned out great!  The addition of the ham and cumin really gave a great smoky flavor.  These were a wonderful addition to my New Years Day meal.

I loved this and so did my husband!! It was delicious, although I must say I made a few changes. We are both in graduate school and on the tightest budget of our lives, so I tried to make it cheap, but full of flavor, as well as just a few taste preferences. First of all, I noticed others said they don't soak black eyed peas, which I didn't know, but at the same time I do like a little broth in my soup and I was making this to be like a soup, so I rinsed the peas and then soaked them for maybe an hour or 2 max. I don't like the flavor of regular bouillon cubes at all, I am hooked on "Better than Bouillon", so I just added a spoonful of that instead. Also, I left out the diced ham due to budgeting reasons and just used the bacon and it was still great! I didn't miss the ham at all. Also, to add flavor, I cut up the strips of bacon and browned them in a skillet, then removed the bacon and added the onion, garlic, bell pepper, and jalapeno to the bacon drippings and let them sweat and soften to improved the flavors before putting it all in the crock pot. I dumped it all in, added a little extra cayenne (my husband likes things spicy) and I also added a can of rotel tomatoes and green chiles. Anyways, this was delicious, thanks for the great recipe, it will be making a reappearance in our house!!

A 5 star recipe.  I made the following deviations.  First, I omitted the ham and bacon from the recipe.  Instead, I used one large smoked turkey drum stick.  The drum sticks are sold in pairs in the meat section at a grocery store for about $6 for 2 large drum sticks.  The smoked turkey drum stick is a healthier alternative and still has as much flavor as ham and bacon.  The second drum stick was placed in the freezer and will be used for a future soup dish.  I also had some carrots in the refrigerator which I pealed, diced and added to the mix.  Secondly, I added the diced bell peppers later on.  Unlike black eyed peas, the bell peppers are more tender and can get mushy if cooked too long.  Third, I did not pre-soak my black eyed peas.  Not necessary due to the slow cooking process.  Fourth, I added twice the amount of minced garlic.  Fifth, no salt was added.  Sixth, I added raw shredded kale, diced green onions, a small amount of lime zest and grated Parmesan cheese to each serving bowl.  The reason for the raw kale is to have the combination of soft cooked peas, carrots and peppers with the crunchy kale.  To make the shredded kale, I removed the large thick spines from the plant and then placed the remainder on a cutting board.  Then I took a sharp knife and sliced the kale as thin as possible.  Although I made a number of substitution and alterations to the original recipe, the result is a much more healthier and tastier recipe.   My wife loved, loved, loved this dish!

SOAK YOUR BEANS FIRST!! This is an excellent recipe, but I am concerned about all the comments regarding the suggestions to NOT soak the beans prior to cooking them.  No, you don't need to soak them before cooking to "soften" them but for more important reasons. Everyone needs to read the following article about the why soaking ALL beans is critical to releasing the anti-nutrients in them and enzyme inhibitors.  It has nothing to do with making the beans "softer" and easier to cook.  Article:  http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/why-you-must-soak-your-beans/    Besides, all it entails is putting your beans in some water overnight to soak before you cook them...how hard is that?

These were really good but waaaaaaaaaaay too spicy (and I like spicy).  I would cut the spicy spices in half or just serve cayenne or tabasco on the side.  I had to add apple juice and brown sugar to cut down on the spicy.  And don't worry if you think it's too watery--if you're adding greens in the last hr (like me & another reviewer) you'll need that extra broth.

I enjoy spice, but this was a little too spicy for my taste.  I will add less cayene pepper next time.  Used a can of chicken broth in place of bouillon and decreased the water by 2 cups.  I didn't soak my beans first and they were perfect.  I sauteed the bacon and all veggies first.  Added a few hanfuls of fresh spinach in the last 30 mins of cooking.  Served with warm cornbread.

very nice..i made a few changes. instead of just throwing everything in the pot, I fried up the bacon with onions, hamhock, celery, peppers and all of the seasonings..then once browned up, I added the chicken stock (3 cups), let that simmer for 20 mins ..placed the beans in a crock pot, poured the mixture over the beans and set on high for 3 hours. it was great.

everyone gave this 5 stars--I did make some slight changes.   Once I cut everything up (bacon,ham, garlic, onion, and peppers)  I sauted it in a frying pan for a few minutes to release the flavors then added all of the spices to to the frying pan and mixed well before putting into crock pot.  I did not soak the peas.  I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water in place of the boullion cube and water.  I used red pepper flakes in place of the cayenne pepper.  I cooked for the first hour on high and the next 5 on low.

Excellent- with a few changes. I originally omitted the salt for fear it would be salty enough with the ham and bacon, but when I tasted it it was bland. I added about a tablespoon of beef bullion powder and garlic salt, and that helped tremendously. I also added half a bunch of chopped kale and a squirt of honey to round out the spiciness. With these changes it went from good to awesome. Thanks for sharing.

FANTASTIC Black Eyed peas.  I did soak my peas first (just always do).  I used 2 fresh jalapenos, and decreased the ceyanne pepper.  Instead of bacon, I bought "salted pork".  It gave the beans a great pork flavor without the bacon smokiness.  No salt needed due to the salted pork. They were great and I'm still eating them!

Loved this, so easy! Was better the second day as leftovers, thicker. We like spicy foods, even added a little bit of hot sauce individually. Didn't add any extra salt; there was enough in the bouillon cube and the turkey ham I used.

This was a wonderful meal! Being from the south, I used smoked sausage and tasso, adding a bit more seasoning.  I always brown the meat and drain any grease before adding it to the slow cooker. About an hour before done, I use a potato masher- to make the peas and gravy a bit more creamy.  This recipe works for dried field peas and baby limas, too! I do use a bit less water than called for. Potatoes, added about an hour or so before done, are a good addition. VERY YUMMY!

First time I've ever made black-eyed peas of any kind and I will say I'll be making them again.  I'm only giving a 4-star because I feel there needs to be more flavor here, for us anyways.  Next time I'm going to add more of everything.

This is a keeper. I've already made it a few times. The first time, I left the jalepeno seeds in...too hot. As long as you remove the seeds, the beans are perfectly spicy with all the other spices. Use the cumin! It really adds a lot. I used all the water called for and a ham bone (instead of bacon). This is really a soup recipe, but if you're trying for thick beans, just cut back on the liquid. Don't add salt, because the ham and stock have plenty. It is great if you like soup or beans.

Usually, corned beef is the star of the meal for us on New Year's Day, but not this year!  Everyone raved over these!  

I used broth instead of cubes, no salt, and just let these cook on low all day long.  It was so good I was still eating it for lunch with corn bread the whole next week.

Great flavour, a tad runny, so I took 1/2 cup of the cooked Peas and mashed them. Added back to the pot to cook for the last hour - thickened up the peas to a nice consistency.

Made this for New Years Day.  Served it with hot, buttered, corn bread.  Wonderful!   I took other reviewers advice & replaced  the water & bouillon with chicken broth.  I used a ham hock, added 1 can of Rotel & omitted the cumin.  A keeper for sure.

I thought this was very good and easy. I was going to add carrots and celery but it didn't need it. I also didn't soak my beans and they ended up being the perfect consistency. A great recipe that doesn't require too many ingredients but still has plenty of flavor. My only suggestion would be to add something green to freshen it up a bit. If I would have had kale or mustard greens I would have added them. I ended up adding cilantro and it worked great.

Have used this recipe for the last few years in our New Year's celebrations.  This recipe is perfectly seasoned, no changes needed and it's so easy!  I think the jalapeno makes the dish.  The crockpot is a perfect way to cook this recipe, no pre-soak needed on the peas and 6-8 hours cooking is about right.  Used up leftover holiday ham and subsititute salt pork for bacon.  We like it served with white rice.  NOTE: After making this recipe for a number of times, I have determined that adding salt AFTER cooking produces better results and softer peas.

This came out very well.  I realized at the last second my ham had gone bad so I used all bacon and that worked just fine.  Also, I did not seed the jalapeno and still found that the beans needed hot sauce.

Really good!  Made this on New Year's Day as Black Eyed Peas bring you luck in the New Year per the southern tradition.  My husband who never eats them with me actually really liked this!  I didn't buy bacon for just the few slices this recipe called for and didn't miss them.  I wouldn't call this recipe spicy (added a lot of hot sauce to my bowl!) so don't shy away if you don't like spicy foold.  It's just plain yummy :)

I wanted to try something new for the HOLIDAY and stumbled upon this gem.  Wow!  The flavor in this recipe is all over the place and you will not be disappointed.  My husband, who normally eats a spoonful to keep up in tradition, ate this by the bowlful multiple times.  I prepared this as is, the only change is I used my pressure cooker!

I fixed this for New Years and it was the best!  I have made Black-Eyed Peas for years, but decided to try this recipe.  I won't go back to the old one. I used 3 cups of chicken broth and 3 cups of water in place of the bouillon cube. I also added about a cup of chopped cabbage.  It was delicious.

I moved to the south in 2010 and decided I'd better add black-eyed peas to my cooking repertoire.  The first 3 recipes I tried were not promising.  But we finally found a winner!  I'm enjoying next-day leftovers now.  I followed the advice of another reviewer who substituted low-sodium canned broth for the bouillon cube and it worked out great.  Instead of ham & bacon I used 10 oz. diced salt pork and omitted jalapeno (just didn't have it in the house) and the finished stew isn't missing a thing!  Everyone in my family enjoys it too and we'll definitely be having this again.  Thanks!

The only thing I did differently was the night before I boiled the left over ham and bone for about an hour.Strain the ham water through cheese cloth, refrigerated ham water. Next day skimed off the solid fat and used the ham water for my liquid. Yummy

Very tasty soup. Made 3 weeks ago. My other half is not especially fond of black eyed peas but he loved this and asked me this morning when was I going to make it again. He also told several of our friends how much he liked it. So I am making it today. The only change I made was I only used about half of the called for amount of cumin because I don't love the flavor of it.  A  little cumin goes a long way for my liking. I wish I could rate it a 4 &1/2 instead of 4. I try to save 5 stars for stuff that absolutely BLOWS me away. I will be making this again and again and again.

If you like peas you have to try this.  It has just the right amount of spice.  It's really a meal by itself.  Definitely a keeper.

I was told that this was the best black eyed peas that they have tasted-  (they were from the south)   It was tasty, but took a long time with the slow cooker.  I'm used to boiling in pot with hamhocks and links.  But I was satisfied.  Great recipe.

Not your typical black-eyes, but really good!  Followed recipe as stated, did not soak beans & they were plenty tender.

These turned out absolutely fantastic. I made some modifications though by omitting the tomatoes and adding finely diced onion, celery and carrots. I first seasoned and browned some neck bones in a cast iron skillet and then the onion, carrot mixture. I used one cup of chicken stock and 4 cups of water and threw it all in the crock pot. Started it out on high for and hour and then reduced it to low for another 3-4 hours. It was SO good and was just like my grandmother from Mississippi used to make. Served it over rice and my Italian hubby and 2 year old loved it.

Delicious! I left out the bacon and onion, but added a can of Rotel like another reviewer suggested. We love this on a cold winter evening!

This was excellent! I made a few changes based on reviews I read. I used two ham shanks, and left out the bacon and diced ham. I used 5 cups of water instead of 6, and I did not add salt. I also left out the jalapeño pepper. I will definitely make this again. The ham shanks gave it a great flavor, and it was plenty spicy without the jalapeño pepper.

I left out the spicy stuff and just used neck bones instead of ham.. added 5 slices of bacon and left everything else the same and everyone loved these. I'm not a fan of black eyed peas so I'll have to take their word for it.

Someone who works at my local grocery store told me that whenever I make BEPs to add in a can of unsweetened coconut milk and I won't be sorry.  I thought this sounded kinda crazy but I did it with this recipe and I was blown away.  I pretty much stayed true to the recipe except that I added a box of free range chicken broth with the coconut milk and 1 cup of water instead of what was called for in this recipe (water + bouillon).  Since I had one pablano pepper and not the jalopeno, I used that instead.  I also substituted 2 smoked ham hocks instead of the bacon because that ends up giving you less fat and the incredible smoked taste that is needed.

I GAVE THIS DISH  3 STARS - CAUSE ALL ARE GOOD - BUT THERES A LITTLE KNOWN FACT THAT IS OVER LOOKED IN ALMOST ALL BLACKEYED PEA DISHES - YOU ARE NOT TO USE HAM IN THEM - THE RUTTER IS THE PART YOUR SUPOSED TO USE ( NOSE OF THE PIG ) THE REASON IS SO YOU GO FORWARD THE COMMING NEW YEAR - NOT BACKWARD - HAVE A HAPPY NEW YEAR

These had a ton of flavor!  I thought they would have a mexican flavor with cumin, cayenne & peppers but it didn't at all, those spices just added depth.  I used 1/3 small can green chilis instead of jalapeno.  I didn't have to soak the peas which was great, they were plenty tender.  I baked a ham earlier this week so I used that bone with meat attached.  I used every tip suggested by "Ti" (top review) minus the kale, and will def. make these again!  Thank you for the recipe!

agreed; soaking these peas overnight is not necessary, as they cook up nice and soft during the 8 hours. I turn the crock pot on high the first hour, then down to low for another 6-8 hours (or however long you're gone for the day; they'll keep just fine!). I would recommend chicken stock rather than water and bouillon cubes. Also, I used smoked turkey drumsticks or wings to flavor mine, rather than ham; it's just lower in fat and still gives amazing flavor.

Easy recipe that tastes great.  We weren't fond of BEP's but we had always had canned.  Someone told me that they were better if they were made from dried beans, so I wanted to give it a try.  I picked this recipe because we like spicy foods.  It was a hit, even the leftovers were devoured a couple days later.

Fantastic!!  I omited the cumin, and subsituted smoked neck bones for the ham.  Added a bit of carrot and celery for oomph.  It was DELICIOUS!! I also didn't soak my beans, but it took longer on High to cook.

Made this almost as instructed and it was delicious! I soaked the peas overnight, replaced the water/bouillon with chicken broth, and used all bacon (no ham). Reduced the liquid a little as I like my peas thicker, threw it all in the crock pot on low, and it was done in about 5 hours.

We did NOT find it spicy though, so next time we'll double the jalapeno or cayenne, or maybe add andouille sausage in place of the ham. All bacon was a little too much bacon. 

Overall, delicious and easy!

Very nice. I served to vegetarian friends with children, so omitted the ham and hot stuff. I added some Morning Star vegetarian crumbles, a bay leaf, and a dash of McCormick's garam masala. I also used leeks instead of onions which I really liked. Served with squash, broccoli slaw salad and cornbread for a great meal.

Very good and versatile with the spices - meaning, you can adjust the "heat" level by adjusting or omitting altogether the cayenne.  My black eyed peas were getting boring and this recipe is just what I needed to pump up the flavor on an otherwise bland dish. The addition of cumin is really tasty - I would not have thought of adding that spice to this dish.  That's what does it for me.  One jalapeno, thoroughly seeded and minced does not add enough heat to notice, but does add to the overall flavor combo.  Glad I tried this for the New Year.  : )  *I did a quick soak as noted on the package and the crock pot on low was done in 6.5 hrs.

My new "go-to" black eyed peas recipe. I made half the recipe, used my homemade chicken stock instead of water and bouillon cube, kept the whole minced jalapeno and added a scant 1/8 tsp. cayenne. absolute perfection! We're at high altitude, so I soaked the peas for 18 hours and slow cooker 8 hours. They turned out nice and tender. Thanks so much!

This was the 1st ever time for me to make black-eyed peas and they were a hit!!  I made them per the recipe/instructions but omitted the jalapeno b/c I thought the cayenne pepper was all the heat it needed. We ate it as the main dish with buttermilk cornbread which was perfect. This is honestly the 1st dish I've made that my husband ate 3 servings of in the same day and he made sure to remind me that a tradition had been born so I'm now bound to make them every New Years. The only sad thing about making this is the fact that I only have one small bowl leftover for lunch tomorrow. ;) FIVE STARS!

wow - this is an awesome recipe!  I took advice from alot of the reviews on here: Used chicken broth instead of water, and pan-fried the bacon.  Then I used some of the leftover bacon grease to saute the onions, bell peppers, & garlic, before adding it to the crock pot.  I omitted the jalapeno because i didnt want it too picante.  Cooked for 4 hours on high, then for the last hour I added some collard greens.  Came out perfect! Just a hint of spice - boy was it good!

I did use 4 cans of black eyed peas, undrained, one can water, one heaping teaspoon chicken bouillian, three onions, chopped, two cloves garlic, crushed, one red & one green pepper, diced, one package pork neck bones, 1/8 teaspoon red pepper, 1-1/2 teaspoons cumin, 1/2 teaspoons black pepper, 2 Tablespoons honey, 2 teaspoons celery salt & one can tomato paste with Italian herbs.  Covered & cooked in crock pot & served with rice.

Quite good. and very New Years nutritious.  Used 12 slices turkey bacon and no ham, added some chopped tomatoes and more chicken broth as others suggested. Served over brown rice. All the kids ate it and some asked for 2nds.

This was absolutely delicious!  Everyone in our family, including kids and serious foodies, raved about it.   I fried the bacon and crumbled it and then used a small amount of the grease to saute the onion, red bell pepper, jalapeno, garlic, cumin, ground black pepper, and cayenne, before adding everything to the crock pot.  I used boxed chicken broth instead of boullion (4 cups plus 2 cups water), and the resulting thick soup was very flavorful with no additional salt needed.  Served with sweet, moist cornbread.  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!  I have been asked to make it often...!

Yummy!  I like to amp up the seasonings...more garlic, cumin, and I also add a handful of chopped cilantro.  Sliced smoked sausage is good in this, too. Really great served over rice, with a squeeze of fresh lime!  With a salad, it's a great meal. :-)

OUTSTANDING!!!  This was the BEST tasting "beans" I've ever eaten, with just a touch of spicy!  I made it for New Years Day (for good luck & wealth) - made a 1/2 batch.  I've already eaten 3 small bowls.  I made this exactly as the recipe said and would not change a thing.  Mmmmm.... going for another bowl!!!

Made exactly as recipe calls, and it's really good!  It is on the spicy side, but that could easily be adjusted.  Nice recipe!

I made these  leaving out the jalapeon pepper and the red bell pepper and it was excellent.  Every last drop was eaten.  Will be making again on New Year's day.

Wow! I grew up on Black  Eyed Peas as my mom is from Arkansas. I was never really fond of that dirt kind of taste. This is with out a doubt the best recipe I have ever tried. I did add some collard greens in the last hour, only took 5 hours on low in my slow cooker and as I do in all veggies because of my southern roots, added just a touch of sugar! Incredible!!!

This was phenomenal! Thanks to Ti for the reminder that black-eyed peas don't need soaking; I'm making another batch now. I used what meat I had, being turkey links & leftover bacon, 3X the garlic & cumin, a voila! I thought I had nothing for dinner & was pleasantly surprised. Very simple, not gourmet, but a humble 'Comfort Food' meal I'll memorize for anytime. Great for hiking/camping w/dried goods, too. For these, I give 5 Stars.

So fabulous!  I had made this for New Years Day and decided to add my collard greens to it.  Not only did it taste fabulous, but the presentation was amazing.  I served it with fresh hot cornbread!  Yum.  I also did not soak the black eyed peas and everything was fabulous

I love this recipe!! Made it just as written and it was awesome! Since I have made many times and have made some changes, broth instead of water and bouillon. And I add greens to it during the last hour or so of cooking on New Years for some extra good luck!!!

The beans are great.  I did make some changes.  I soaked the beans overnight and reduced the liquid to 1 qt low salt chicken broth.  I used 2 onions, 1 red pepper, 1 orange pepper and 3 ribs of celery all diced.  I used about 1 lb of chorizo sausage, browned well.  I then used the same pot to sautee the veggies.  I also used more garlic.  I increased the cumin to 2.5 tsp and instead of cayenne I used chipolte powder.  I did not add the jalepeno.  I also did not need to add salt.  I put everything in a slow cooker and let it go overnight on low.  I know I made a lot of changes, but the basic recipe is the same and I recomend it highly.

SO yummy! I used 5 cups chicken broth, added an extra jalapeno for some additional kick and added cooked shrimp for the last 30 minutes. My parents who have never had black eyed peas before thought this was fantastic! It was a little bit runny, but a half an hour cooking with the lid off took care of that not a problem.

These beans were so yummy! I made it with pintos instead of black eyed peas (because the store was out of black eyed peas on New Years Eve!) and it was still so good. I was afraid to put the full 1/2 t of cayenne because I thought it would be too hot, but it wasn't quite hot enough and I wished I had added the full amount! Will definitely make again and again.

I'm still making this so I will update how it tastes in a bit but I just wanted to say that I put this on HIGH in the slow cooker at 6:30 and at 10:50, I decided to put it in a pot on the stove, it would NEVER be done by in time to eat for lunch. My mother says the broth tastes good tho so I'll be making this again but I will not do it in a slow cooker.

The best!  I did take the advice of some of the comments & added a few other things.  I.E. crushed red pepper to taste; smoked neck bones (in place of ham); can of chicken; real bacon bits. Delicious!

This recipe was fantastic! I cooked it for new years (you know for good luck). I substituted the bacon for fat back and eliminated the cumin (just not a fan) and it was wonderful. Got compliments all around the table.

I had to make a few changes due to time constrains and lack of ingredients but nothing that would have altered the taste very much, so I can confidently give this recipe the 5 stars I think it deserves.  I cooked it on top of the stove in a cast iron pot on slow heat for a couple of hours.  The beans softened up just fine.  I didn't have the ham or bacon, but used a one and a half pound pork loin roast, cubed, and added a little liquid smoke.  I didn't have a fresh jalapeno, so substituted a can of salsa verde.  I only used about 4 cups of water though so that it would be thicker, like a stew.  Served over basmati rice...made a very nice meal.

Excellent!  I used 2 large shallots b/c I only had 1/2 an onion in the house.  Used a scant 1/2 teaspoon of the cayenne pepper and seeded the jalepeno before dicing.  Spiciness was just right -- spicy but not too hot.  Also, I microwaved the bacon for two minues before adding to remove some of the fat.  Per one of the suggestions, I added about 4 cups of chopped greeens (chard, etc.) and it was fabulous!  Both my husband and I agreed that the greens neither added nor took away, but it is a good way to get extra veggies in.  I will definitely make again.

I used Better Than Bouillon instead of the cube, 1 large onion, 5 cloves of garlic, 1 carrot, 2 stalks of celery, 1 red pepper, 2 jalapenos. I fried the bacon, then sauteed the veggies in the bacon grease just until softened, along with the cumin and 1/2 tsp cayenne. I added the ham, 1 Tbls of honey, and also added chopped kale for the last hour. Delicious! Best beans I've ever tasted. Thanks for the recipe.. and the tips!

I made these for New Years and they were wonderful.  I did not soak them.  The only change to the recipe was, I used chicken broth because I had no bouillon.  We like spicy food and did not find this recipe to be too spicy at all.  Very good!

Was reluctant to cook the beans without soaking, but based on the reviews took a chance.  It was great.  Used a smoked turkey wing instead of the ham and bacon.  Put it in the crockpot with water to cover & cooked on high for a couple of hours.  Makes a wonderful broth and the meat comes off the bone.  Added the rest of the ingredients, but no bouillon as you have the broth already, & cooked on low according to directions.  Added a touch of sugar near the end - calms the spicy a bit.  Will do this again.  One more tip - used a crockpot liner for the first time, makes cleanup a breeze.

I wasn't really impressed with this recipe as I found it to be missing something even after I doubled the red bell pepper, onion, black pepper, and garlic. Actually, I tripled the garlic and black pepper. I added 1/2 tsp more cumin, 3 large carrots, and used chicken stock instead of the 6 cups water and a bouillon cube, and I even put a huge ham bone in. The only thing that this recipe called for that I didn't use was the jalapeno which I substituted for a dried ancho chili because I wanted a more mild recipe that my little ones would be able to eat. My husband loved it, my toddlers liked the broth, but I was indifferent. I'm happy that I doubled everything. I'll probably make this recipe again, but with my additions. Maybe next time I'll add that jalapeno too because maybe I was missing that spicy kick.

This was really good.  I only used half of a jalapeno and I used 2 country style pork ribs, cut with fat trimmed off, instead of the ham and bacon.  Subbed 2 cans of broth and then used water to make up the 6 cups.  No buillion.  It turned out still spicy but not too much.  SO delicious!  Will definitely make again.

These were just amazing.  They did have a bit of a kick, but it you like dried beans, these were just outstanding.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was, no alterations.  We've had this twice now and I'm going to make it for our next church supper.

3 stars because the kids and DH didn't seem to thrilled.  I made it w/o the cheese though.  Also cut spices down a little and was still had a nice bite.  I froze the second half - we'll see if I can make it more appetizing next time.

wow.  amazing.  best black eyed dish yet!

Making for 5th year in a row- black eyed peas for good luck on new year.  Always turns out great.  I stopped adding the bacon since it would get kinda mushy on me, and I "guesstimate" the seasonings.  Have also used carrots.  Always a hit!

I had high hopes for this recipe since it was so highly rated.  Followed the recipe exactly, but unfortunately, no one in our family liked it.  We just don't like black-eyed peas no matter how hard we try, I guess.  This recipe sounded really really good, and is probably outstanding if you like those nasty black-eyed pea.  :)

These were phenominal!!!  i used stock instead of water and boullion.  I used 2 jalapeno's and about 5 garlic cloves and the whole ham steak.  Very flavorful and spicy!
This recipe even converted 3 black-eye-pea haters!!  way to go MJ46NY

After years of making black-eyed peas for New Years Day, this is the absolute best recipe!! I doubled everything for my large oval slow cooker, using 9 cups of water (including 1.5 cups with the 2 dissolved bouillon cubes.) No bacon, and just my ham bones leftover, with some added chunks of ham. I also used about 1/2 small can of jalapenos, as I had none fresh. It DOES thicken up when it cools, too. So yummy that I've now been appointed the official "bean cook" in the house. Big honor, here.

hoping to get lucky in 2012 with this recipe!  i rarely make things as-written, but needed no improvements.  i sauteed the garlic/onion/jalapeno/ham in bacon grease before adding to the slow cooker.  it all came out great.  i did leave out the cayenne hoping it wouldn't be too spicy for my one year old.  husband added tapatio to his -- baby and i had sour cream.  sticks to your ribs good.

I made this recipe for a New Years Eve party and it was a big hit!  I did make several changes to accomodate midwestern palates not accustomed to spice and friends who don't eat pork as well as adding collard greens for even more New Years luck (beans for coins, greens for bills I read) and carrots (personal preference) so I can't really rate original recipe but we really liked this version:
Recipe alterations: I used 2 c water & 4 c veg broth, omitted boullion & cayenne, used smoked turkey for ham and turkey bacon instead of regular, omitted salt, used 1/2 gr bell pepper in place of jalapeno, added 4-5 carrots, and added 1 bunch collard greens 1-2 hrs before completion. I did soak beans overnight in 2 c water, then rinsed them and added just the 4 cups veg broth before starting the crockpot in the a.m. Cooked on low for first 6 hr but beans still hard so high for last 2 hr. Great!

tastes great but has way to much sodium.  subsitute low sodium stock for bouillon cube and water and use low sodium bacon and this becomes a delicious, nutrious, heart healthy dish anyone from 6 to 60 can enjoy

Never been a fan of black-eyed peas, but since I was having a NYE party last year, felt obligated to make some.  Found this recipe and it was as awesome as it looked.  Addded some cilantro since I had some left over for a little extra kick.  Guests enjoyed it- very little ended up in the trash.  Getting ready to make some more this year.

I made this tonight & wow, this was yummy. I simmered it for 8 hours. I also was out of cayenne pepper and instead used a pinch of red pepper flakes and probably used about 1tsp of salt. Very yummy. This is the first time I made it and I was impressed. Great recipe.

Very good. I modified it quite a bit. My mother has cancer, so cannot tolerate anything spicy. I eliminated the jalapeno and cayenne then used only 1/2 tsp of pepper. I didn't have any ham, but I used pork neck bones. Because they're bones and bones make broth, I eliminated the broth and used plain water. Finally I put in a can of diced tomatoes and decreased the water to 5 1/2 cups and then followed everything else. Perfect! My family ate it all and loved every bit of it. For those who wanted spice, they used Frank's red hot sauce and said that was amazing. This is a keeper and I'll use neck bones from here on out.

I ended up doubling the recipe and used smoked beef sausage and turkey bacon instead of the ham and bacon.  We had a party at our house, so I started this about 5pm New Years Eve, and by about midnight it was done.  By 1am, there wasn't but a couple spoonfuls left.  Everyone loved it!  Even the ones who said they didn't like Black-Eyed Peas!  They all said they'd be back next year for another bowl-ful.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made it exactly as recipe called for. I don't think it needs anything else, the ham and bacon are perfect and add just the right amount of flavor so you still get the flavor of the Black-Eyed Peas. Gave some to my parents and they both said they are the best Black Eyed-Peas they ever had.

I never even thought to cook black-eyed peas in the slow cooker until I found this recipe last year. For that alone, it gets 5 stars! I don't add all the spices because I don't think they're necessary (jmo).

Excellent recipe.  I soaked my beans overnight, browned my bacon, sauted the onions and used ham hocks instead of chopped ham.  Served with jalapeno corn bread found on this site and it was an amazing meal!!  This one is a keeper.

This was lip-smacking good! My mother's beans were never this delicious and she can cook! My family was eating out of the slow cooker before I can serve them. I put them on shortly after the ball dropped on New Year's on low and when I woke up my hubby was telling me how good the beans were. My teen boys were also in the slow cooker "taste testing". I didn't even get a chance to taste and tweak it before everyone else tasted. I added a can of Rotel as per another reviewer and another jalapeno. Other than that, stayed true to the recipe. DELICIOUSO!!!  Another staple!

Delicious!!  They were supposed to be for dinner tonight, but I am already eating them.  The house smelled amazing while they were cooking.  Just the right amount of heat.  The only thing I may do differently next time is to render the bacon seperately, and maybe put them on top when serving.  Overall, this is really good, much better than the usual black eyed peas I have made for New Years.  Thanks!!

A little too much onion for my taste and I like onion.  Ended up diluting the batch of dried peas with a can of peas which helped tone down the onion a little. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it came out good.

My husband raved about these.  I used a few left over ribs from the end that cooked alittle much.  No bacon but alittle grease =).  Tendered them up nice.  I'll never boil ribs again yuck =(  Everything else was to recipe and I think black-eyed peas will be more than a new years dish.

I cooked this dish on stove top and it took about 2 hours.  I would cut the water down to 5 cups.  Flavor is very good for this dish.

This was a great way to use up leftover Christmas ham. Stores around here don't carry dried black eyed peas, so I used one can of those, as well as a can of kidney beans. I decreased the water to 5 cups and used a can of chicken broth in place of the bouillon. I omitted the peppers and bacon, and increased the ham to 10 oz. I also omitted the cayenne pepper and decreased the black pepper to 1/2 tsp. I added a chopped carrot, a tablespoon of honey, and a can of diced tomatoes. Unlike others, I definitely thought this needed some salt. This will be a keeper in our house. We really enjoyed it.

Yum!  The only change I made to the recipe was that I added a couple of cups of chopped kale.  I must admit that I've never really had black-eyed peas, but my friends have and said they were delicious.  I must add that I rarely ever make only one change to a recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

I bought fresh/organic black eyed peas in the produce section.  I used canadian bacon b/c I didn't have ham and didn't add the bell pepper.  I also used low sodium chicken broth from the carton.  I cooked on the stove for 6 hours on low/covered.  I uncovered in the middle of cooking and cooked on a higher heat to let some of the moisture evaporate for a more thick broth.  Very good flavor.  Best beans I ever made.

We love this recipe...I have made it for the last couple of years now.  I use 1 box (32 ounces) chicken broth with 2 cups water,  I use a garlic press for the garlic, I don't add the jalapeno chili, instead I do add a can of rotel (mostly drained).  Everything else I do is the same. This works for my family because we do have a toddler.   I serve with rice and cornbread.   It makes a great meal for anytime of the year.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

My husband really liked them although I did not know not to soak the beans overnight so it was sooo much water.  Recipe should be revised, it would have been a 5 had it come out right!

Changes I made: 4 cups water, 1 can chicken broth Turkey bacon / lean ham, didn't add any salt, 1 small can no salt tomato sauce that was added 1 hour before it was done. Recipe was so easy, inexpensive and tasty.  I ate it as a main dish with sliced avocado.

Wow, I've never done black eyed peas for New Year's but I did this year.  My neighbors were over for dinner and they have had that tradition.  But they said they had never had such tasty black eyed peas.  It's sure to be a great year.

Very good.  My boyfriend who said he didn't like black eyed peas, is now a fan.  I used chicken stock instead of water and a boulion cube.  Also added a splash of tabasco sauce and a pinch of crushed red peppers (we like spicy foods).  Made it in the crock pot before I went to bed for a yummy meal on New Year's Day.  Try it..you'll like it!  :-)

If you make this, DEFINITELY soak your peas. I cooked it for 8 hours and the peas were still not soft. The flavor was ok, nothing special. Canned black eyed peas with jalapenos are just as good. Not impressed with this one - I won't be making it again.

Great recipe, easy to assemble, but like others I had to make some tweaks. First I used broth instead of water, much improved. Also took about eight plus hours in the crook and the beans were still alittle hard. We liked this enough to make next year though.

Absolutely delicious, so flavorful and not watery.  Followed recipe exactly with few exceptions: Cooked in slow cooker on high for 5 hours instead of low. Did not have red pepper, but this would have added color.  Used lots of diced home smoked ham instead of the ham and bacon. Very, very good. Served with grilled chicken. I shared some the next day with a neighbor despite the protests of my greedy husband!

Followed this exact recipe except used 5 cups water and 1 can chicken broth (instead of the bouillon cube)  Absolutely delicious!  We love spicy food, and this was the perfect amount of spice!  Can't wait to make this again!

This is a great basic recipe, and you can do it on the stovetop or even in the pressure cooker instead of the slow cooker. I prefer to soak my peas all day and then simmer them on the stovetop, which only takes about 90 minutes if I've soaked them. We don't like bacon, so I put in smoked sausage near the end. I also add a couple of bay leaves during cooking. Another great add-in is green beans. It gives you the sensation of black-eyed peas with snaps. I make these on a regular basis. Thanks for the recipe!

These were really good! I’ve never made black eyed peas before. I took other reviewer’s advice and did not soak beforehand. I just threw everything in the crockpot. Only thing I didn’t like was the ham. Honestly didn’t even need it, the bacon gave it amazing flavor. Will make this again!

This was AWESOME!  Here's what I tweaked from the original recipe and the seasoning and heat were both perfect.
Added 1 heaping tsp salt, 1 heaping tsp chicken & tomato bullion. I omitted the jalapeno and cayenne completely; but added a small ( the really little cans) of diced chili peppers. I also used a can of chicken broth in place of the chicken bullion cube, and counted the liquid as part of the 6 cups of water.  Threw 2 large bay leaves in there too. I'll definitely make this again.

Delicious!! I didn’t soak. Followed the recipe exactly except as many suggested I subbed the bouillon for stock and left a cup out and it was the perfect amount. I also didn’t add additional salt. This recipe is a keeper!

I really like this recipe, I have made it multiple times. I've made it without the ham, without the red pepper, and it's still awesome. I could eat a big bowl of this as a meal. And it is so cheap and easy to make especially if you leave out the ham! This is a keeper that I will make time and time again!

I really love the spice of this dish.  The only change I made was the cooking time.   They were done in 4 hours on low.  6 hours would have disintergrated the peas.  I will rate this 4 star because of 6 hour cooking time listed, but the flavor is definitely a solid 5 star.

I followed the recipe just the way it was and it turned out great!  I like that you don't have to soak the peas and you just put everything in and set it!  I cooked mine for 6 hours and they came out great!  I cooked some brown rice and added shredded cheese!  My husband love it!  Trying it again tomorrow!

I made this recipe on New Year's Day for native Southerners. I'd never made black eyed peas before (I'm more of a corned beef & cabbage for NYD gal). To a person the response was, "these are the best black eyed peas I've ever had." However, I did change a few things. I did not soak the beans. I used leftover honey ham from Christmas. And I didn't add raw bacon. I cooked the bacon and drained it first. And I didn't use a crock pot.

Very tasty and will definitely make again. Used 2 ham hocks in place of bacon and ham. Also, used season salt instead of regular salt. Very very very tasty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Don't soak peas.

When I was younger, my family had a tradition of making black-eyed pea's on New Year's day for luck. I haven't done this in years because I didn't like the hassle of cooking the beans the usual way. I was really craving these beans however so I went looking and I stumbled across this slow cooker recipe.  These turned out perfectly. I followed the recipe to the letter; and had no problems whatsoever. Spicy and delicious!   I will definitely be making this again.

Added Kale an used 2 Serrano peppers instead of jalepeno for more mellow smoky heat. Used cooked country ham as well. Awesome! Cook this every year for New Year's Day. Serve with cornbread.

This is the third time making this wonderful dish.  I have tried Ham Hocks and Ham Shank instead of the chopped ham.  My favorite was the Ham Hocks.   I followed the recipe the way it was except I never added salt.  My family loved it.  The best part was the beans.  They where perfect.  I found that 7 hours in an oval cooker was perfect.  I just turned off the heat and let it set for another hour or so.

When I make this again, I'm going to let the peas soak in the chicken stock (probably with spices) the night before. It took me 6 hrs on low, then another 6 hrs on high to get them done enough. :/

Besides that, I thought the liquid ratio was good. I nixed the extra salt, and am glad I did! I like spicey things, and did not find it overwhelming like others had commented.

This was excellent! I cooked my bacon in a pan, carmelized the chopped veggies (extra onion and garlic!) in the drippings and added a dried Chipotle pepper to the crock pot. Let it cook on low for about 7 hoursn and then threw in a bag of frozen organic spinach at the end. Really great recipe...Thanks for sharing!

It was a tradition of my Mothers to make black eye peas on New Years Day. It blesses the new year with good luck. This version was very delicious. I will definitely make it again. I added an extra cup of water, more cayenne and garlic. I also added 1/2 lb of old fashioned cut bacon which I baked in the oven before adding it to the crockpot. Two thumbs up. I served it with cornbread with green chili's and added corn.

Earthy, smoky, super tasty.  Pairs well with long-grain/wild rice mix: serve beans on top of bed of rice.  Added: chipotle pepper flakes + red pepper flakes.  Cooked on high one hour before setting on low.  Prefer small dices of ham for mouth feel + cooked them in skillet to brown them a bit before adding to pot.  Solid add to your winter recipe list. (Used low-sodium liquid chicken broth, not the bullion cube.)

I love this recipe...I converted this recipe to Hoppin' John by adding mixed greens (collard, chard) and removing the bell pepper and stewed it overnight in my crock pot on low for 8 hours. I didn't have to add extra salt due to the ham and pork hocks and bacon.

I used chicken broth instead of water and skipped the bouillon cube. I used a smoked turkey leg as a substitute for all of the pork. It was delicious and very easy to make.

4.5 stars: This is a great way to make peas using the crock pot during the summer and when needing to save a stove burner.  I gave it 5, because I changed some things. I used a leftover ham bone, and did not use the bacon since it had a little fat.  I also left out the onion (used onion powder), red bell peppers and jalapeno for a child. Still, very good and ready in 5 hours on low.  I plan to make it with ALL of the ingredients sometime.

Made as written, except used season salt in lieu of table salt, and added a tsp of cayenne pepper powder for a little heat. Family loved! Super easy, inexpensive, and oh so yummy.

Totally awesome New Year's dish!

Being from the south, New Year's day demands that one have black-eyed peas.  Sadly, I have never been a fan of black-eyed peas.  Regardless, tradition dictated that this once a year ritual must be done.  I tired this recipe with no changes and loved it!  It was amazing how delicious this made those previously despised peas.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Best black-eyed pea recipe ever. Only adjustments I make are using chicken stock and adding one can of diced tomatoes. I use pepper bacon for an added kick. Fantastic with a little sour cream and cornbread. Yum.

Really good, super easy and will make again!  The beans do not need to be pre-soaked and thus the liquid content turned out perfect for us.  I only used one slice of bacon but otherwise made as directed and cooked in a slow cooker for 8 hours.  I won't pre-cook the red bell pepper next time as after 8 hours of additional cooking, they were pretty much pulverized and I would have liked them more intact.  I didn't salt the beans at all prior to cooking but felt it needed a little salt.  Also, this was not spicy enough for us so I added 3 or 4 squirts of tabasco and a few shakes of Tony Chachere's.

It was good. I wasn't sure about the dried beans at first, but it came out fine. Only thing is that next time I make it I would put it on High, so I can spend up the time.

Really, really good!! I agree with others in that you should use about a cup or two less water than suggested. I made a few changes... I used half chicken broth/water, I left out the red pepper and added diced tomatoes and a can of hot Rotel instead, and I also sautéed the onion, garlic, jalapeños, bacon and ham before putting them in the crockpot. I left out the cayenne because the jalapeños give it plenty of spice.

I changed very little with this, instead of water and a bouillon cube, I just used low-sodium chicken broth because I already had a box open and why not? Also, I didn't buy bacon, I had about 1/3 jar of real bacon bits that I threw in there. I didn't add any salt because I figured the ham and bacon would be enough and I was right. This was great!

This is so good... I only revised it very little. I did soak the black eyed peas overnight with some baking soda, because mine were old and I was worried if I didn't, they wouldn't get tender. I also used chicken broth in lieu of water and bouillon, and threw in a handful each of celery and carrots. You definitely don't need added salt if you use chicken broth. Being a Yankee, I didn't know what to expect, but I totally loved it. :-) Served cornbread muffins along side and bread pudding for dessert. Delish!

I did not like this, even though I followed the recipe exactly. Very boring and bland. Will not make again.

I make this recipe and freeze the leftovers.  When they're gone I make it again.  This is SO tasty.  The only thing I change is that I use one can chicken broth, 1 can veggie broth and 3 cups of water instead of the 6 cups of water.  My husband and I both love this!

I was disappointed. Eight hours was too long to cook the beans. The consistency was terrible. I didn't have a jalapeno and cayenne is all heat, so I used 1 tsp. Chipotle powder to replace both. I also used chicken broth and water to replace the bullion cube. It had no flavor except heat! When I reheated the leftovers, I added a can of diced tomatoes, chili powder and extra cumin. I then served it over brown rice to cut heat and improve the consistency. It tasted better. I just can't stand to waste food.

I had some fairly thick sliced sugar cured peppered bacon and it added an excellent taste. I also thought the recipe was a bit too spicy so I added frozen whole kernel corn, an extra cup of chicken bouillon, a can of cream of celery soup and a few other spices (like Nature's Seasoning, Accent, basil). Started out in a slow cooker but ran out of time and switched to a stockpot and cooked on the stove. Served over cornbread. Yum! I will definitely make this again. Had forgotten how much I like blackeyed peas. We ate this this for 3 nights, which is quite unusual...we are not big fans of leftovers. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Used fresh Mexican chorizo (1 pound; cut each sausage into thirds) in place of ham and bacon, the paprika in the chorizo did not distract from the wonderful taste.  Left out the cayenne as did not need that much heat. A great easy recipe.

We loved it!  I'm going to do again before next New Year's Day.  It was great, but ours was done in 5 to 5-1/2 hours on low.

I made this for our New Year's dinner and it was excellent.  The only thing I did differently was to use ham hocks (as that was what I had) instead of the ham, and also used only homemade chicken broth.  I added 16 oz. of Kale during the last hour of cooking for additional nutrition.  Hubby loved it!

This was good, I wish I would have been able to follow the recipe more, but I didn't have everything. I omitted the jalapeno because it would have been to spicy for my kids, I add diced chilies instead. Didn't have ham so I added salt pork.  It made the house smell great and everyone loved it.  All my kids and husband ate them.  This is a keeper!

As another reviewer said I, too, don't like to give 5 stars when I change the recipe.  But this is great the way it is.  (Albeit possibly too salty).  What did I change?  Chicken stock - no bullion.  Ham hock - no diced ham. Omitted the salt & the bell pepper.  I'm from Texas & have been growing then cooking my own peas for years.  This is an easy almost dead on Southern New Year's Eve/Day staple.  Will make again & again.  Thanks!

I found this recipe b/c I was trying to use up leftover Christmas ham.  I didn't know if my family would like black-eyed peas, as I had never served them before.  It was a hit.  I followed the recipe exactly, and served it with Trader Joe's corn bread (THE BEST!).  This was a good cold weather comfort meal!

Awesome recipe for black-eyed peas! I used 5 cups of chicken stock instead of water and boullion cube. Ham steak instead of bacon and increased garlic to 4 cloves. Also, added one bunch of collard greens 1.5 hours before end of cooking time. Cooked on high for 4 hours, then reduced to low for 2 hours.
Served with sour cream, green onions and cilantro...best black-eyed peas ever!

This recipe was great!! I am from Georgia, so this was perfect for our New Year's day good luck dish.  I added a bit more garlic and a few shakes of hot sauce, and it was very tasty.  My husabnd raved they were the best he's had.  Beans were perfectly cooked- although I did take the advice of another review and cook on high for the first hour.Yum!

Turned out great even though I had to make substitutions because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand.  No bouillon and only had one can of chicken broth, so I replaced 2 c. of water with a can of broth.  Subbed thickly sliced carrots for bell pepper.  I'm not sure the bell peppers would have made it through an overnight cooking anyway.  Subbed jarred jalapenos for fresh.   Used hog jowl instead of bacon. (I have never had hog jowl "on hand."  Someone told me it was part of the New Year's tradition.  Not sure what part of the pig it is, but it was tasty.) :)  Put that in the slow cooker on low the night before (beans were not pre-soaked) and had it for lunch the next day with cornbread.  Added several handfuls of chopped kale about 20 minutes before serving.  My husband added pepper vinegar because he likes things spicier than the rest of us.

First time I've cooked with dried peas. Usually open a can. This was a great recipe. I ommitted the pepper but the seasonings were dead on. Didn't soak beans and cooked in crock pot on high about 4 hours. Boiled peas on stove to thicken the broth. Loved it. Thanks.

Whoa...this turned out really good with only minor changes.  Chicken stock for water and bouillon, only had green pepper on hand, omitted jalapeno.  Use less cayenne if you like less spicy.  This gets better with each passing day! A definite winner!

First off I have to say when I told my family we were going to have this new years day they all turned up their noses. I told them they were going to eat it as we need all the good luck we could get. Needless to say they all liked this recipe and said we could have it again next year so I guess it passed inspection YEAAAA! the ONLY change I made was to cook it for 6 hrs. on low and with 5 cups of chicken broth as I didn't have chicken bouillon cubes. This really was good served with corn bread. I will make this yearly from now on.

Instead of the spices I subbed about 2-3 tsp. Tony"s Cajun Seasoning plus a can of Rotel tomatoes. I also used chicken stock instead of water and bouillon, and no bacon, jalapeno or bell pepper.  Hard to mess this one up really. Before serving I mashed some of the peas with a potato masher while still in the crockpot to thicken it up a bit. Served over rice for New Year's Day.

Awesome flavor with a few changes of my own and what others suggested: (1) omit salt, broth and meats add plenty of salt; (2) I used vegetable base in place of chicken cube and a tsp. of Vigo ham flavoring; (3) I substituted chipolte powder for cayenne for a smoky heat; (4) I added 2 chopped carrots and 1 stalk chopped celery for extra vegetables and fiber without much change to taste but pretty colors. (5) 1-2 hrs before finishing the 8 hrs on low in a crock pot, I added 1 bunch chopped collard greens; (5)

We loved this. A perfect New e Year's Day meal! I did not have a jalepeno - used some Tabasco sauce instead.  Otherwise, I reduced the water by one cup and got a nice thick dish.  Very tasty - I look forward to the leftovers.

I made these today for our traditional New Year's Day dinner with collard greens.  I left out the peppers since I didn't have them and added a few red pepper flakes for the jalapeno.  Mine were done in about 6 hours and I didn't soak them ahead of time.  I like the ease of preparation of these and the taste was good.

Great recipe. To give it an extra kick I took this recipe, upped it to 8 cups of water, 12oz of ham, 2 boullion cubes and then doubled all the spices. Just as a final customization I added a little fresh Cilantro. This got great reviews from friends at my party including from a couple of good ol' Southern Boys

I work 3rd shift. I made this recipe and brought it in for my co-workers on New Years. I returned home that morning with an empty bowl. This will be a New Years tradition in my family from now on.

This recipe was amazing! I used a ham hock instead of bacon and ham, added a little green bell pepper and used small sweet peppers in place of the red bell pepper (what I had on hand), used salt-free Tony's and a little Tabasco. I loved it, will make it again.

Like everyone else, we loved these. I modified the recipe by using 4 cups of low-sodium chicken broth and 1 cup of water. I did not add the bacon, but used a little more ham than called for. I think the next time I will decrease the cayenne to a quarter tsp. as I'm not a big fan of cayenne flavor. I would maybe add a little more jalapeno to make up the difference. I cooked them for a full 8 hours and they were nice and tender, tasty and filling. These will definitely go in a regular rotation in our house.

Had to cook the beans for twice as long in the slow cooker. After 8 hours the beans were aldente and were watery. The beans just had a peppery taste so I added 4 slices of turkey bacon after the first taste and more ham for flavor.

This is a great recipe! I have made this several times and it is always a winner! My friends beg me to make this for every gathering! There is no need to change anything, but sometimes I add a little more cayenne or jalepeno.

Great recipe, but I made some changes to make it healthier. Used canned chicken broth instead of water and bouillon. Left out the bacon and ham and used 1 lb of chicken andouille sausage. Left out the cayenne and chili. Added 4 cups of spinach and 2 carrots. Cooked for about 4 hours, came out delicious.

I can't say enough about how good this was. Not too spicy but it has spice. Not to smoky but certainly savory. I had two full bowls of this with cornbread and red beans and rice and it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time!

My husband (who does not care for black-eyed peas) loved this recipe. He actually asked me to make brown beans the exact same way. Considering this was my first attempt at b-e-p, I'd say it was a huge success.  Followed exact recipe.

There was nothing wrong with this recipe, it just wasn't particularly special to me.  I had halved it as it's just my husband and I.  Used 3 cups of homemade chicken broth instead of the cubes.  Left out the bell pepper as neither of us are fans of cooked bell pepper.  The end result was just too blah.  The jalapeno seemed to have been dulled by its time in the pot, the bacon, which had been crisped brown and beautiful before going in there, was flavorless.  I didn't soak the beans beforehand and they were perfectly cooked.  Wasn't wrong, it just wasn't right for us either.

Loved this! I used 16 oz. diced ham (next time will do bigger chunks) and 2 slices chopped bacon (or pre-packaged bacon pieces would be good too). Had to sub garlic powder because I didn't have any garlic on hand. Tasted great, and had a really nice spicy kick which could be adjusted to preference. I served this as a meal in itself. Similar to a chili or a ham/bean stew. If serving as a meal again I will use the chunked ham instead of diced just because it makes it feel a little heartier. But, great overall recipe and so easy to throw together in the crockpot.

yummy! I didn't have time to slow cook it so I added 2 extra cups of water and cooked it dry beans and all, covered, on the stove, simmering for a little over an hour. No jalapenos or bacon so I just increased the cayenne and added a few frozen chopped bell pepper, a few tbs. vegetable oil, and extra ham. I also added an extra boullion cube.

I LOVE Black eyed peas and normally just make it w/ salt, pepper, and pork side meat and its great! This was just OK to me. I did not soak my beans overnight which is what I normally do when I cook it on the stove. I did a quick boil (boil beans for 2 minutes and let sit covered for an hour) I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of water. Had I had more broth I would have used all broth but I ran out. I was using a 3 quart slow cooker so didn't have room to put a total of 6 cups as the recipe said but I'm glad because 5 was more then enough. I think 4 would be sufficient. I omitted the cayenne pepper because I thought 1 nice sized jalapeno would have been more then enough kick. It wasn't and will probably use 2 next time. I don't like things TOO spicy. I also omitted the cumin, bouillon and red bell pepper. Instead of bacon I used pork side meat. I did add additional salt too. I cooked on high for about 5 hours and it was still kinda soupy but the beans were done. I didn't want my beans to overcook and get mushy so I put it on warm overnight and it got to the right consistency. I thought this deserved at least a 4. Maybe I would have gotten that different taste that I was hoping for it I had not omitted the cayenne pepper, bell pepper and cumin. I will try this again, but will NOT do it in a slow cooker.

I decided to make this in the pressure cooker because I didn't have the time to wait.  I put in the beans with some onion and some beef chunks (we don't eat pork).  When the beans were soft, I just added the garlic and spices and let it cook on the stove top for a while.  We left out the peppers since we don't like spice.  The beans are really flavorful and soft.  I guess I found the shortcut method!

I love black-eyed peas but my wife does not.  This is the only recipe of them that she will eat (and she actually likes it).  The cumin gives it a bit of chili character and it has a nice spice (we are pepper heads so we add an extra jalapenos and hot sauce / cayanne.).

So yummy!   Taste's like something you would buy at a Southern restaurant.  I made this in a pot on the stove.  Did a quick soak on the beans, drained, then made the recipe in my pot and simmered for about 1 1/2-2 hours.    The recipe is great as written, but a I added a drained can of diced tomatoes, a can of chiles, and some spicy sausage, the second time around, and it added just a little more kick.

I don't really like black-eyed peas, but my husband loves them. This was the best black-eyed peas I've ever fixed. I changed some ingredients, added some things, and omitted the jalapeno and cumin. I used a package of bacon and a little left over ham from Christmas. I cut the bacon and ham in pieces and fried together until crispy. I then removed the bacon and ham, saving some of the bacon drippings to saute 1/2 a package of frozen tri-colored peppers and onions, one fresh onion, and about 2 teaspoons jarred minced garlic. Once the peppers, onions, and garlic were sauteed, I added 3 cans of black-eyed peas with liquid (instead of using dry peas). I added 3 beef bouillon (instead of 1 chicken bouillon), 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, one large can of chopped green chilis, and 1 package of crushed red peppers from a pizza restaurant. I then added 2 handfuls of brown sugar, mixed it all together and let it simmer about 45 minutes until all the liquid was absorbed. I will be making this for New Year's Day every year from now on! Served with corned beef and cabbage, this was the most amazing New Year's Day dinner we've ever had. It was beyond yummy and delicious!!!

This recipe is great.  Love the kick.  You don't have to soak black-eyed peas however doing so gives you that nice thick broth instead of watery like other reviewers were talking about.  Also I cut water to 5 cups.  I used a little ham base instead of ham to cut on fat and still get the ham flavor I also used turkey bacon.  This is a keeper.

I made changes all over the place just to be a little more like my Mama's.  I put no ham, but used 2 ham hocks.  I used ham bouillon, canned black-eyed peas and no cumin or pepper.  I never used the jalapeno before and loved it.  I generally don't like things too spicy and this was perfect....thanks!

I have made this twice and it was wonderful.  the first time I did not soak the beans and they where still firm after cooking all day.2nd time I soaked them first and added less water.Even my sons ate it and the only beans they will eat are chili beans. I used kielbasa and ham, added Kale in the beginning as it takes a while to soften the way I like it. You should definitely try this recipe!

Made this for new year's and really liked it.  I will definitely make it throughout the year.  Only change based on others suggestions was to sub a can of chicken broth for some of the water and leave out the bullion.  Loved having it in the crock pot while I worked on the rest of dinner!

I made these last night and they were excellent! I did sub out the ham with turkey kielbasa, and the bacon with turkey bacon (cheaper and lower fat). I also added a little bit of paprika. They have a nice little bit of spice to them. I cooked them in my pressure cooker rather than a slow cooker. 15 minutes at high pressure and they were cooked perfectly (I did not pre-soak).

My family and I loved this recipe ! I did omit bouillon for chicken broth.  I also did not add salt.  I think it is a matter of preference due to your likings.  It was plently flavored due to the other ingredients.

This recipe was truly fantastic. 
I made a couple of changes, simply because of what I had on-hand. I used turkey ham intead of pork, and vegetable bullion cubes instead of chicken. 
These beans were fantastic while hot and fresh, but I left them in the crockpot, turned off, overnight, and they were even better this morning! The sauce thickened up, so they're the texture of baked beans, with chunks of meat and fantastic flavor. Definitely making this super-simple recipe again!

This was delicious. I used organic low sodium chicken broth (in place of water and bullion cube) and excellent quality black eyed peas. Everyone loved it and I will make often.

I'm giving this recipe five stars because it really is very good.  However, I think the cooking time and/or temperature is a little off.  At least it was for my slow cooker.  After seven hours, covered, on low, the beans were not fully cooked and there was still alot of liquid (used chicken broth instead of water).  We put the beans in the microwave, covered, and cooked them for about 15 minutes.  After that, they were perfect!  Next time, I will know to adjust the time and temperature.

Good start to the new year!  Left out the diced ham, red pepper and jalapeno.  Replaced these with rotel, turkey sausage and red pepper flakes.  I also added in some kale the last hour.  Mine took about 7 hrs. on low, and the beans still had a bit of a crunch to them.

Ok, I made these again for New Years Day.  I added some Cajun spices, chopped the tops of two jalapenos off and put them in, and added a ham bone I left over in the freezer.  These came out sooo much better!!  Just season more if you like it spicey.


I didn't care for this receipe very much, and I was a little surprised because I love spices.  I am not sure if I did something wrong, but the peas didn't have much flave, only the broth.  My husband love it, so that is why I am giving it three stars

Excellent! We used a little more garlic than called for, and 2 slices of bacon and
some Black Forest ham slices, served with 
mixed southern greens, made a great meal.

My family ate this on New Years Day 2009 and we really enjoyed it! I used canned chicken broth rather than the cube, and added some cajun spices in place of the cayenne pepper, because I ran out and my store doesn't carry it.  Then we put cayenne pepper sauce on top before we ate it.  It's wonderful over white rice!

Loved this recipe!  I was searching for one that had a bolder flavor and finally found it.  I used 32 oz chicken stock, plus 1 cup of water, but followed the recipe as written after that.  I served it over hot cooked jasmine rice and it was delicious!

I was looking for something with a little more pizzaz than my usual black eyed peas. When I saw this one I knew it was too spicy for me; my body doesn't tolerate hot spicy well. I also don't own a crock pot, but know that black eyed peas don't really need to cook for hours. So I used this recipe and cut way back on the spices. The flavor was wonderful and my hubby loved it. He likes spicy so I'm sure he would have preferred the original recipe, but undersatnds I can't tolerate that. Thanks for a great new recipe I'll continue using. I don't wait until New years to cook black eyed peas. We have these at least once or twice a month in the winter. Of course must have Southern oven skillet cooked corn bread with it.

Happy New Year, one last time. Linda

Hubby took one bite and said, "Yeah, we're gonna have good luck this year!" Would have been great as written, but we like tomatoes and heat so added a small can diced tomatoes and an extra jalapeno and cut back the water by a half cup. Absolutely wonderful!

I thought this recipe was very easy to prepare. I used all chicken broth. I used ham and bacon. I followed the rest of the recipe as written, except no salt.  I served after midnight on New Year's Eve with cornbread. Everyone was super impressed. I will definitely make this again next year!!

A really tasty recipe --- IF you like Black-eyed peas!!! One bit of caution; don't cut back on the liquids. After 6 hours in a slow cooker it can easily dry out and the consistency turn to mush. I made it last night and will cut back on the jalapenos next time ... a TAD spicy for some folks.

Wonderful recipe!  Have never had much luck with boiled black eyed peas... but in the slow cooker... WOW... these were GREAT.  Doubled the recipe and made almost as written.  Instead of water, I used up the no sodium chicken stock I had in the freezer (will be making more broth this weekend and needed the room in the freezer!!)...and I still used the bouillon for the salt... I did not find the extra sodium from the ham or bacon to be overpowering.  Was getting a little concerned with the amount of "liquid" remaining in the pot... it seemed like a little much... so I turned up the crock and left the lid off for the last hour and 1/2 (so cooked for about 7 hours total).... and all of a sudden, everything kind of equalized... the peas took on the right amount of water (and "squish" as I call it)... and the liquid "thickened" up.... just perfectly.  The other spices were not overwhelming either... the jalapeno and onions mellowed with cooking...we all loved them... including our two crabby little kids.  Will definitely make this again next New Years... and would do it again BEFORE then!  Thanks for sharing!

Very delicious.  I substituted the ham with 1 lb. of sausage just because that is what we prefer.  Oh, I have used 4 cups chicken stock, 2 cups water instead of the water and bouillon cube - next time, would use only 3 cups stock. 4 hours in the slow cooker was plenty! UPDATE:  Made with pink eye peas, 2 bell peppers, 2 banana peppers, cherry tomatoes, sausage instead of ham, bacon, okra, and used only 4 cups water.  Cooked all but the peas and okra for about an hour in a large pot, then added the okra and peas for the last 30 minutes, simmering on low.  Added a small cornstarch slurry at the end to thicken.  Delicious, and quicker.  Like gumbo without the rice.

Average.  We thought that it needed more seasoning, maybe more jalepeno.  Totally turned out like soup, so we ate it over brown rice with hot sauce.

I soaked the beans overnight, added a can of diced tomatoes (probably added to the watery-ness) and cooked on high for 6 hours.

This is an easy and amazingly tasty recipe. There is no need to soak your peas. Just rinse and prepare to cook. I do recommend decreasing the amount of water used, as there was quite a bit of liquid remaining after my cook that I ladled off. I also chose to substitute Cajun sausage for the ham and bacon. If you’re not a fan of spicy food, use half the jalapeño or leave it out entirely. You’ll still have a knock out dish that all lovers of black eye peas will enjoy. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was amazing! The only thing I did differently is use 1 (32oz) Chicken Broth and 2 cups of water, (instead of the 6 cups of water and Chicken Bullion) and I used lean Boneless Ham Hocks. Flavor was fantastic. Made some Cornbread to go with it, and had a hard time not going back for thirds.

Wow! I didn’t know beans could be so good and flavorful. Didn’t have ham. I might use 2 slices of bacon next time as there was a decent amount of grease that hardened on top after being refrigerated. Great recipe! Not too spicy.

Hearty warm and healthy your soul kind of meal! Omitted black pepper. Added 1 can Rotel tomatoes and green chilies original for some extra kick and 2 stalks chopped celery along with leftover grilled smoked sausage links.

With mixed reviews on whether or not black eyed peas, need to soak, I sort of chose something in the middle.  I boiled some water, added the beans, covered, and let them sit while I prepared the other ingredients.  I did fry and drain the bacon before adding it, as well.  This is pretty fantastic but it is pretty soupy so be aware if you don't care for liquid in your beans, you might want to use a slotted spoon.

I made this almost as the recipe calls for.  The only changes I made was to reduce the cayenne by 1/2 and i added a can of diced tomatoes when the peas were almost done.   We loved it with cornbread.  The next time I will only make a half recipe as it is just my husband and myself.  We loved it and will definitely have it again.  It will be a good dish to take to a pot luck gathering.

This was a very simple and easy recipe.  I had cut everything up the day before, when I was getting my breakfast for work I threw it all in the slow cooker and viola! It had a very nice flavor, did add a little corn starch to thicken the sauce a bit. Made rice and cornbread to go with it.

Made this in the pressure cooker and delicious but needed a lot less water/broth...came out kind of like a soup.  Served it over rice.

Amazing recipe. I made a few changes: chicken stock instead of bouillon and water (I had chicken stock), no bell pepper and no jalapeño. There was spice, but not too spicy. Great flavor and very easy. Saved for next New Year.

Yes. Didn’t have Jalapeños so used a teaspoon of Tony’s 
I had a ham bone with a good bit of ham I first parboiled and used this broth and all the ham instead of chicken bouillon also added 1/2 stick butter. 
Wonderful flavor and didn’t need to presoak peas

Hubby loved it!! I made a few changes-added sliced carrots and celery and a can of diced tomatoes. I didn’t want it too spicy, so I omitted the cayenne, and used 1/2 tbsp of tony chachere’s seasoning. Didn’t pre-soak the beans. Didn’t have enough time to use the slow cooker, so put everything in the instant pot for 15 min at high pressure, then natural release. Delicious with corn muffins! Will definitely make it my standard New Years dinner!

best black eyed peas I've ever enjoyed, bar none; but please don't let my Grandmother know.  I love the little bit of heat packed into this dish and, yes, I used rotel in lieu of the red bell pepper.  This is by no means a "ho-hum" everyday recipe!  Love it!

I cut out  a lot of the spicy ingredients by less then half. It was delicious! You should add more water if you are gonna keep it in the crockpot for a few days until its gone. I keep my crockpot on warm over the weekend while we enjoyed it and on monday the little bit of beans that was left was dry.

I liked this recipe.  The only change I would make is cooking the bacon before adding it to the peas.  Otherwise, great tasting recipe with just enough spiciness and loads of flavor.

Big hit with the family--even the ones who are not fond of too much spicy heat. Will keep in the bean rotation.

My first time making black eyed peas and it was amazing.  This was always my mom’s specialty but I think I have her beat now with this amazing receptor!

This was delicious.  I didn't use the jalapenos because I'm not a big fan of spicy.  I also didn't use the bacon because that seemed like overkill.  I did add some kale per the other reviews to give it some greenery and it worked well in the dish.

I've always disliked black eyed-peas until now.
Cooked these on the stove top for New Year's and served over white rice with cornbread on the side.
I substituted hot smoked beef sausage for the ham since hobby don't eat pork and also left out the bacon.

The only change I made to this was to substitute one cup of chicken broth for one cup of water and skip the bouillon cube.  It was very good and my husband loved it.

This was very popular at a church dinner. I ended up using pork sausage instead of ham and bacon, cut the cayenne to 1/4 tsp, and a few other minor substitutions, but otherwise followed the recipe. It was just the right amount of spice and all the other flavors blended nicely.

Yummy, but not sure why it's in the healthy section.  We leave out the meats.  Broths make beans great by themselves.

The picture I took was only a few hours into cooking, but I tasted the broth and it was AMAZING! I can’t wait until it’s done. I did not pre soak the beans. And I cut the recipe down to 3 servings. Note I am not really the best cook (think contestant on America’s Worst Cooks) - this seems like a recipe that’s really hard to mess up and get wrong. You literally just chop the veggies up and dump everything at once into the crockpot and cook on low for 6-8 hrs.

Instead of bell pepper I diced up a poblano, and in place of the jalapeno, I de-seeded 2 seranos. It was delicious and I plan on making this again.

Just a few little tweaks. I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water for a richer flavor. Seeded and removed membrane on only 1/2 a jalapeño... it was just warn enough to not overwhelm the flavors. Didn’t have ham so I used a couple thin center cut loin chops. Sautéed bacon and pork added those to my slow cooker. Then the peas.Using the same pan, I sautéed all the veggies, including the half jalapeño and carrots, added the cumin at the end to let the flavor bloom.

I cooked these on the stove top.  They were pretty tasty & definitely had a kick to them.  I'm not a big fan of black eyes peas but they were good.

These turned out well. I sautéed the veggies ( added a  chopped celery stalk to help use it up ) with one chopped bacon slice. I added two chopped serrano and about a third more of cayenne and cumin. No other bacon because I was using the leftover ham bone with plenty of meat from Thanksgiving. Didn't add extra salt because I used mostly chicken broth and Better than Chicken paste to flavor the water used. The BF likes squishy beans so 7 hours on high  did the job. They had plenty of juice but that's what cornbread is for. There was spice to be noticed but nothing overwhelming or lingering. I will totally do these again!

Delicious!!  Left out the jalapenos as I didn't have any, but made the rest as written (except I cooked the bacon first then softened the onions in the bacon grease before adding them to the pot and used chicken broth instead of bouillon).   Whole family loved it.  Next time I would use 5 cups instead of 6 of broth as it was soupier than I wanted but the flavor was outstanding.

Never made black-eye peas before so I thought I would try it! What can  I say other than awesome! Ate 2 bowls and had to to just stop myself. Made it by the recipe but did'nt add the jalapeño because hubby can't handle hot. Did add a can of roasted tomatoes because I like tomatoes. Definitely a keeper and will be making enough to freeze for winter.

I used my instant pot pressure cooker and it was done in less than an hour. I wasn’t planning on writing a review so I didn’t pay much attention to the cooking time but I think I cooked it for 35 minutes on the beans setting. It was super spicy! My husband will love it but the kids won’t touch it! I think it will be great with cornbread!

This was very easy to make. I made it for my family Christmas dinner. I didn’t soak the beans. The beans were the right consistency and there wasn’t too much broth. It was great over rice.

I have made this for several years for New Year’s Day and always get rave reviews. I followed the recipe and others’ advice. I used a ham hock and about four slices of bacon. I also used about 3 cups of chicken stock with 3 cups of water. I used fresh peas the grocery store stocks at this time of year. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. It was awesome and didn’t last long!

Yum.  Southern comfort food, and just right for New Year's Day since black-eyed peas eaten on that day bring good fortune!  I upped the jalapeno's a little, and made sure that hot sauces were available on the table.   Perfect pair with cornbread!

I made this with a very few tweaks:  added a touch of liquid smoke and omitted the salt.  I should have soaked the beans because they were still too hard after 6 1/2 hours of cooking.   It was not too spicy, in fact, could have used a little more.  However, neither one of us liked this enough to have it again.   I think the real issue is that neither of us is crazy about  black eyed peas.

Yummy! I made few changes based on what I had at home and personal taste. Used ham, no bacon. Used Better than Bouillon (chicken) rather then the cube. No jalapeños so I threw in two dried ancho chilies and added two tablespoons of tomato paste concentrate because we like tomato-y sauce. I added salt but wouldn’t next time-plenty of salt from the ham and.Very easy recipe and a ton of flavor for the effort. Love being able to use my slow cooker while I was at work.

Great recipe for BE Peas...I used salt-free Chicken broth for my 6 cups of water, used a chili pepper instead of jalapeno, omitted the salt and added 1 stalk if diced celery. Cooked on med for 6 hrs and it was just the way we like it..Served with cornbread fritters and yum,yum,yum

The rule in our house is that we always make the recipe AS WRITTEN the very first time and then make any changes moving forward.  The ONLY change I made was to decrease the amount of cumin, since my husband isn't a cumin fan.  It is absolutely delicious . . . slightly smoky from the bacon and ham (I used pre-diced ham).  The flavors are perfect.  It's still hot in Phoenix (1st week of September, still in the 100s) and we're enjoying it hot or cold, but it will be even better in the winter.  Definitely a keeper!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I added a bay leaf and did 2 jalapenos otherwise followed exactly and we're making it for a second time now in 2 weeks. Served it over rice and loved every single bite.

Really tasty.  I cooked the bacon ahead of time to make it more crispy and it seemed to add extra flavor that way.  Yummy.

We love this recipe. I didn't have jalapeño but it's still spicy because of the cayenne. I also soaked the beans overnight  rinsed it before putting it in the slow cooker together with other ingredients. Finally I used ham broth. So good!

This was good. Plenty of heat, so I might pull back a bit on the cumin next time I make it. If I make this again, I would add another 1 oz of ham and a small green pepper. Just A LOT of beans in comparison to the vegetables. Also, be careful on the salt. My ham was salty enough, so the dish did not need any additional salt.

Really great black eyed peas dish. Turned out like a soup or stew. Great smoky flavor from the ham and the bacon, we loved it! I used canned black eyed peas (don't hate), and guesstimated 3 cans for the recipe. Also I dissolved the boullion with hot water before I put it in the slow cooker, and also threw in several cubes of frozen turkey stock. So good! I'll make it again!!

I have been searching for a good recipe for years, and I've finally found it! I made the recipe as stated, but didn't have a jalapeno, and it was still spicy enough for me. My husband just asked me to make more, so off to the store I go!

My grandmother is from the south, so we grew up with the tradition of serving black-eyed peas on New Year's Day for good luck all year long!  This year I decided to make this recipe because I wanted to see how we liked the addition of carrots, onions and bell pepper.  I made the recipe as is with the exception of omitting diced ham because I already had a pork loin roast I wanted to serve them with.  They turned out great.  We topped them with L/F Sour Cream, freshly chopped tomatoes and cilantro.  Will definitely make again.

I did this in my instant pot (pressure cooker)... cooked for ~ 20 minutes with natural (slow)  pressure release. First time making black-eyed peas and using instant pot. Followed the recipe; no changes. Fantastic. Easy. I'll make these again.

Due to a regional shortage of hog jowls in western NC near New Year's Eve, I used a half-pound or so of pig's neck.  This in place of both bacon and ham.  I sauted a bit to brown the neck bones.  I also deleted a half-cup of water and could easily omitted another half-cup.  Serving a certain number of wimps, I reduced the jalapeno by half and omitted the cayenne entirely.  On the other hand, I used a can of diced tomatoes and green chilis which brought a little heat to the game.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  Everyone liked the dish.  Even the wimps.

Very tasty and flavorful, but it is not very spicy.  If you want it spicier then consider adding another jalapeño and/or more cayenne pepper.   I followed the recipe, except I used smoked turkey sausage instead of pork.  The recipe is fine with 6 cups of water if you allow it to cook for 6 hours as instructed  Most of the  liquid will cook down.  I did add extra salt and black pepper at the end, based on my taste preference.

This is my new favorite.  Have made other recipes for black-eyed peas for decades, but this is the best.  I might add an extra jalapeno next time, as one gave it the flavor but it was not spicy hot.  Have never had so many compliments.

Wonderful recipe for the black eye pea novice! Made the following changes:

- 1 lb ham; no bacon
- 1/2 tsp chili powder; no cayenne
- used Pictsweet frozen onion & bell pepper mix
- used 4 cups chicken bone broth and 2 cups water; no boullion cube

Topped with sour cream, diced green onion, and halved cherry tomatoes and paired with some homemade honey corn bread....absolutely DELICIOUS!! Will definitely make again! ??

I never really liked black eyed peas, but always have them on New Years as a tradition.  This year, I wanted to spice them up a bit!  This recipe was AWESOME!  I did not have chicken stock or a bullion cube, so I just used water.  I did not add the jalapeño as I thought it might be too spicy.  I intend to make this recipe throughout the year, and definitely next year!  I have already shared it with several people, and my family was in awe!  GREAT RECIPE.

I changed the recipe up a bit! I used 5 cups of water, I can of Campbell's Chicken Broth and one tablespoon of loose chicken bullion rather than 6 cups of water. I added 6 drops of Tabasco and cooked it on low for 4 hours and on high for 2 hours. This was made as part of a New Years Day meal and shared with East Coast Family who had not had black eyed peas before! They were a hit guys! Thanks so much!

Loved this dish!  I was short on time, so I used canned black-eyed peas and it was no problem. I also added kale per another reviewer's suggestion. Not sure it added much other than the color green. Will definitely make it again!

This is a very good, very spicy dish. I used pork neck bones and diced, leftover ham (in lieu of bacon), but otherwise followed the recipe. The recipe is probably too spicy for most folks, so I served it over a bed of rice to tame it down. I'll make it again.

Amazing - Instant Pot tweaks follow. First off I quick-soaked my black-eyed peas. Also eliminated the ham, and diced 4 slices of Applegate Naturals Sunday Bacon. In the InstantPot, I sauteed the bacon bits until crispy and set aside to avoid salting the cooking beans much. Then I followed the recipe, but added some turmeric, a strip of kombu and a bay leaf. I used the Instant Pot slow cooker function for three hours, then kept it on warm with the lid off while cooking the rest of our dinner. Adjusted the seasonings with salt, pepper, and a few glugs of Coconut Secret Coco Aminos.  At first it seemed watery, but during the "keep warm" phase (uncovered) the pot liquor cooked down and rendered one positively addictive mess of black eyed peas!

Pretty good recipe. I made a few adjustments. No ham. I used 1/2 link smoked sausage and 1/2 smoked garlic sausage. Cumin scares me so I adjusted to just 1 tsp. I also used one can of chicken broth and reduced the water to 4 cups based on other reviews; could use 5 for more broth, but not an issue. Added 1 tsp of salt. No jalapeño and it's probably for the best. It was still plenty spicy. Recipe was right on time for New Year's dinner. Thanks!

It was ok, but using raw black eyed peas without soaking was a big mistake. The dish tasted good, but the beans were very firm and we did not care for the texture. If I were to do it again, I would soak the beans overnight and I am sure it would be fine. I don't know why anyone would have a recipe with non-soaked beans. I was an optimist.

Absolutely great recipe. I did 3 cups of water and 3 cups of low sodium chicken broth, I also did 12 ounces of cubed ham instead of bacon. I also soaked my peas for 3 hours and I cooked in crockpot for 8 hours to perfection. The best I've ever had.... and that's an understatement

Love this recipe, I always joke with people that I am a Polish girl from Detroit, and I know nothing about southern cooking.  Well I've made this recipe a few times now, it is my go to when I feel like making a nice "southern" Sunday dinner.

Was very good. I deviated slightly from the recipe.
- Used chicken sausage instead of ham and bacon
- Used green pepper instead of red
- Used 6 cups chicken stock
- Added 3 thai chiles

Had a small amount of heat but tasted really good. I'll definitely make it again

Very good and very easy to make.  I couldn't find dried black eyed peas at the store so I substituted dried pinto beans.  Excellent!  I would suggest cutting the spices in half, which I did based on a recommendation on here, and it still had plenty of kick.

We loved these and will definitely make again. My daughter is vegetarian so we eliminated all the meat and used Better than Bouillon vegetable base. To add flavor without the meat, we used all broth in place of the water.  We like spicy food and didn't find this too hot at all. As others suggested, we didn't soak the beans. They turned out beautifully - very hearty and satisfying.

It was yummy. 
I followed the recipe with two changes since I have vegans in the house and didn't want to eat the vat of beans alone.
I used vegetable bouillon cubes (you can buy them!) and Morningstar breakfast sausage patties in place of ham.
I did soak my blackened peas the night before to get them cleaner and remove extra stuff loosened in water.

Love this recipe, super easy and really delicious. I soaked the beans overnight, used left over ham bone with about 3/4 of a pound of meat, 4 strips of bacon, and I used four little hot peppers from our garden. The only thing I shouldn't have done is added extra salt, it was a little over salted with the ham and bacon, but otherwise simply delicious! Thank you!!!

This was great. The only changes I made was to cut the cayenne pepper in half. Will definitely be making this again. As other have stated this dish gets better after it sits for a day or two.

Stayed fairly close to the recipe and it was awesome. The only thing I did different was use a half-pack of bacon. Husband loved this, just the right amount of spice to give it a kick. Will definitely make this again.

Very good, I had never heard of black eyed peas before this recipe.  I didn't soaked them, just rinsed them and put them in the crock pot.  I used left over ham from Christmas, a good way to use it up.  Nice and spicy, but not too spicy.  I did use 4 cans of chicken broth and 2 cans of water.

Made it just as the recipe said, with one small exception. Did not have jalapeno so added red pepper flakes. My husband was over the moon, happy with this recipe. Served over cornbread, as someone else suggested. Easy,  and can't wait to try leftovers. (always better the second day)

First, I soaked my black-eyed peas overnight. I used 2 bouillon cubes instead of 1.
I used about 12 oz leftover Honey Baked Ham from Christmas and about 8 oz of bacon. I cooked the bacon and used the leftover bacon grease to sautée the onion and garlic. I would have sautéed the bell pepper as well but I didn't have one on hand, so the bell pepper was omitted. I served this dish with honey cornbread muffins (Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix with 1/4 cup honey added to the batter before baking).
Next time I will add some type of greens (mustard, kale, collard, turnip, etc.) during the last hour of cooking and I may mince the bell pepper and sautéed it  along  with the onion, garlic, and meats.
Either way, this recipe is fantastic and will be my go-to for black-eyed peas, ham, and greens for New Year Day.

I have made this with and without the ham.  It is great both ways.  I took the idea from another, using chicken stock and making it in a crock pot works great.  This is a great dish for tailgating.

This was a delicious combination. The few things I did differently is add a hambone, and some precooked pork Andouille sausage. I also used 4 cans of black Eyed Peas instead of dried peas.

Instead of ham and bacon I used about 1-1.5 pound smoked turkey wing. I boiled the turkey in enough water to cover the meat, them simmered with the lid on for 2 hours. Remove the meat and let it cool. Don't throw out the water, this is the broth instead of chicken broth the recipe calls for. Then remove the skin and bones, shredded the meat, and add back to the water. I added everything else to the crockpot with the meat and water. You may need to add more water, you want enough to cover the ingredients. Cook on low for 6 hours then add 1 T sugar and cook on low for one more hour.

This recipe is a keeper.  I made 1 mistake I won't make again.  To rinse the dry peas, I put them in a bowl of water to swirl them around and then got distracted for only a few minutes.  When I got back to the peas, they had soaked up almost all of the water.  I did not expect that, obviously.  I think that is why they weren't as spicy as expected and why they cooked way faster.  Also, I can't stand fatty pieces of meat so I don't know what I was thinking when I put the 4 pieces of uncooked bacon in it.  I had to pick them all out before I could eat it.  I am a southern girl so I understand the 'need' for bacon fat but next time I think I will cook the bacon and use the drippings.  None of that is the fault of the recipe, though.  And my husband loves beans and peas and spicy stuff so they were still a hit with him.

Absolutely fabulous and I am not a big fan of black eye peas! The whole crockpot was eaten by my co-workers.  I made a few adjust based on what I know my family like regarding the heat of the recipe and the previous reviews... I am a whimp and cannot tolerate spicy food. I read some of the reviews and they said not to use all 6 cups of water so I started with 5 cups of water. But, I must have had some thirsty beans because it was really thick after 6 hours of cooking. I added all 6 cups of water.The adjustment were:
-used "Better than Bouillon" since it has no MSG in it.
-did not add salt: bacon and ham added enough.
-left out the jalapenos
-1/8 cayenne pepper (did I mention how whimpy I   
  was...this allowed the perfect amount of heat)
-1 teaspoon of Allegro original marinade ( I read a 
  review where they used liquid smoke and this is the  
  closest thing I had).
-I cooked the bacon beforehand and used left over
 ham from x-mas (honey baked ham). I used my 
 ninja food processor to made these into little pieces
 and I feel it made a big difference since you had a 
 little in each bite.
-Most important step in my opinion: I sautéed the 
 garlic, onions, and bell pepper in olive oil until tender 
 before adding to crock pot.

Best black eyed pea soup recipe I've had. I added a cup of frozen corn and used pre-cooked bacon so there'd be less fat. Also used chicken broth instead of bullion and omitted the salt and used frozen black eyed peas. I made it in my crockpot on high for 4 hours. Very delicious but very spicy. I'm not sure the spice level is for everyone but was perfect for me on New Years Day!

I have been making this recipe for at least 5 yrs. It is wonderful! Our friends rave about my black eyed peas on New Year's. I always give credit to All Recipes. I have been leaving out the bacon the last few years as I have saved ham bones and cut the prices off for this recipe. Soo yummy!!!
Sometimes I cheat and use chicken broth if I have some on hand.
If you like black eyed peas, this recipe will not disappoint!!
If you like heat, tobassco is soooo good. I always add it on my plate so everyone can get the heat they want. It's not really spicy, but has enough to add flavor!

Great change for my New Years Black Eyed Peas!  Omitted 1 cup of water, omitted the red bell pepper & Jalapeno and added 1 can of original Rotel - Could have used  the spicier version but did not have on had.  Omitted the bacon and ham (did not have on hand) and used 1/2 pound of Fat Back (AKA Salt Pork)... with a small bit of the extra fat cut away.  GREAT!!!!!!  Cooked in crock pot on high for 2 hours and low for 1 1/2 hours....Everyone loved them.  Would give 5 stars but did not follow the original recipe so would not be fair.  Thanks for a great recipe that can be played with a bit!

Excellent peas! I followed the recipe other than using a little extra steak ham instead of the bacon and chicken  broth instead of water and bouillon cube ( I didn't have any).  Didn't soak the beans and cooked on low for 8 hours with 6 cups of liquid. This is now my go to for black eyed peas.

This recipe needs no fixing. It's perfect the way it's written  SO easy - I just throw everything into my Dutch oven and let it simmer for a few hours - not 6-8 as in the slow cooker; it's faster on the stove.  Best recipe ever!  I've made this several years in a row now and it never fails. Eating some right now for New Year's Day lunch.

Very good.  Used 2 bouillon cubes, about 12 oz smoked spiral ham and 6 slices bacon. Didn't add jalapeño, cayenne pepper, or cumin. I didn't want it spicy. It was a little juicy but tasted great. Great way to cook black eye peas for New Years.

Loved these beans even without the bacon and ham. I used chicken stock in place of the chicken bullion so there was no added MSG, and added a bit of Tony Chaceres creole seasoning.  I will be making this again!

Probably the best black eyed peas I have ever made! I pretty much followed the recipe (didn't have fresh jalapeno, so I used some from a jar), used a teaspoon or two of bacon grease (had no bacon), and no ham (I was serving chicken).  It still was delicious. Will definitely do again.

Great recipe.  The only change I made was to add some sweet sausage to it.  Can use this as part of a meal or as the meal.

This recipe is excellent. I used a breakfast ham steak & a hole small pack of bacon (diced). Also added 2 spoons of chicken base. I like hearty black eyed peas.

We enjoyed this served over brown rice.  I upped the heat by increasing the cayenne pepper and the jalapenos.  I also used chicken broth for half of the liquid instead of all water.

I didn't use a slow cooker, used 2 canned blacked peas, cooked bacon with onion,garlic, cumin and peppers. Then added broth and let simmer for a good while. Served with corn bread.  It has become a New Year's day tradition. Friends and family look forward to this meal.

We doubled the recipe with the following changes.  We used hog jowl instead of both the ham and bacon.  We halved the cumin.  Used only 1 onion.  Used 4 bags frozen (thawed in fridge overnight) black eye peas instead of dry ones.  We didn't add the cayenne pepper nor regular pepper.  Added 1 tsp salt.  The second time I made this, I added some andouille sausage that was fried in olive oil first.  Made in a 6 qt crockpot on high for just over 4 hrs.  I love this recipe.

I have made these numerous times with navy beans instead of Black eyed peas and they turn out just as good. Definitely 5 stars and always a party favorite.

A Really yummy spicy meal.   I Love it.   I followed the recipe as directed with minor alterations.  
I didn't have quite enough cumin left in my jar.    So I Added chili powder a shake of ginger.  A dash of Worcestershire sauce.  
With things like this you can play around with seasonings.  
 I didn't add any salt.  It was salty enough.  
I added a frozen block of chopped spinach.  
I used 6 cups of water total and I think that's fine.  It's  a chunky soup type consistency. That's what I wanted.  
I added a tablespoon of corn starch to thicken the soup up.   (I mix cornstarch with  a small amount of cold water first) then add. 
And I made some gluten free biscuits to go with the soup and wow what a fabulous meal.  Definitely a winner!

wonderful!! added pork roast leftovers to this dish- mmmm
revised 2-15: added pork chops to the top of the slow cooker over the beans instead of the ham and bacon. Also added 3 jalapeno's, 5 cloves of garlic chopped and a few stalks of celery and and a chopped carrot, and a splash of liquid smoke. Used a quart of home made chicken stock instead of the water and bouillon cube. Also doubled the cumin- so very, very good- a co-worker who is from Mississippi asked me for the recipe and said that she and her family love it! If I could rate it higher than 5 stars I would- I love dried beans and these are some of the very best in this recipe!
1-1-16- I make these about every month through the winter- This last time I added 4 boneless baby back ribs and a big spoonful of bacon grease- I use 1 T. of cumin and 3 chopped jalapenos- with seeds, and its perfect- we like spicy! I still use 1 qt. of home made chicken stock instead of water and do not soak the black eyed peas over night- just rinse, and dump everything in the crock pot and cook on low for 8-10 hours. STILL, the best beans ever!! highly recommend this inexpensive and nutritious meal! would be great over brown rice with a side of cornbread!

Outstanding! This will be a family favorite! My wife found it a bit too spicy so I will use half the pepper next time. Personally I thought it was perfect as is. Thanks for this wonderful dish.

Wasn't impressed when I made it last year. However, there were so much left over I packaged it for the freezer. Needed a starch for dinner this evening, so we heated it up in the microwave. Must say -- time improved it dramatically.

Excellent and easy! Followed recipe; didn't change a thing. Boyfriend who doesn't like black eyed peas, said this was the best bean dish he has ever had. For those who said their beans were still hard after cooking 6-8 hours, I believe, based on past experience, that beans do get old and don't soften when cooked properly.

The recipe is awesome! We loved the spiciness - not too hot but the perfect New Years side for ham!
 PS - I used the sodium free chicken bouillon & did not miss the salt at all!!!!

So easy- did not soak the peas!  Delicious!   Used chicken stock instead of water and chopped up a few grape tomatoes also- I just had them around.   Used green pepper instead of red cause that was in my fridge.  So yummy and delicious.  Did not use the hot pepper or cayenne cause I'm a wimp but my family can add hot sauce at the table!

This one of my "go to" recipes especially in the winter. It is flavorful and spicy. I make it vegetarian by leaving out the ham and bacon and using a veggie bullion cube. It is so good. I like it with homemade crusty bread or corn bread or just by itself. I make it often. No need to pre-soak the black eyed peas. I also make them on top of the stove, simmer for about an hour or until tender. They are even better the next day if they last that long.

Humdrum side dish. The leftover peas tasted better a day later, perhaps closing in on a 4* rating. Made as written which was a mistake. Almost always sub broth for a bouillon cube, and should have done so this time. The excessive water is intended to cover all the ingredients while slow cooking but has to be drained off unless wanting to have black-eyed pea soup. A lot of flavor is lost by draining it away. Doubt we will make this again.

What a great recipe! I made 1 slight change, I omitted the jalapeño and doubled the cayenne pepper only because I forgot the jalapeño. Still, it tasted amazing! I cooked on low and they were ready early at about  5 hours. Still, great recipe. Much better than eating the canned ones full of preservatives. Will make again soon!

Cooked it just as it was. I didn't change anything. Thought it was fantastic. I served it over brown rice.
Very easy and all the flavors were great. I'm making it again and putting it in the freezer so I can have quick meals on days i'm too lazy to cook.

We have made this recipe twice for good luck on New Year's Day. Because my husband is not fond of spicy, I omitted the jalapeno, but otherwise followed the recipe, except for using bacon instead of ham. The first time I soaked the beans, which worked out fine. This time, I took the advice of many reviewers and did not soak the beans. It was lucky that I had decided to prepare the recipe the night before, as it took over 12 hours to cook on low (raised to medium half-way through). Next time, I will play it safe and soak the beans!  Family loved it, and I will certainly make it again.

Great recipe for black eye peas.  Different from my norm.  Did not have the jalapeno pepper and did not miss it.  It was very spicy.  Did not use bacon, did not miss.  I used an 8 0z ham slice diced.  No need for salt at all.  Started them in the crock pot, but ran short for time and finished them on top of the stove.  If they turn out too juicy,just smash a few peas and stir, this will thicken the broth.  This pot of pea went faster than any I've cookd beause there were different.  Very tasty.  My daughter asked for the recipe.  She will probably add the jalapeno.  I can't take the fire - lols.  Using this recipe again tomorrow, but with pinto beans.

I changed the ingredients, and normally do not rate when I do that, but did anyway since this was the first time I have cooked black-eyes in a crock pot, but that is the only way I will cook them from now on.

I love this recipe! I just tone down the spice for the kids because otherwise it would be too spicy and I leave out the bell pepper because I'm not a fan of bell pepper. I use chicken broth instead of bouillon since I don't keep the cubes around, leave the salt out, like other reviewers say and serve it with cornbread! It's always better the next day too!

Made this on a spur-of-the-moment.  Didn't have ham,so used chicken. Also only had two cans of black eyed peas, so added those to the crock pot during last hour or so.  YUM! Will be making again!!

I made this on a whim because I like Blackeyed peas anything with a lot of spice. I was not expecting this to be as spicy as it was. Very warm and very good flavor. I will do this again. Thank you.

Excellent! Perfect blend of spices. Used a ham hock instead of ham/bacon, just becuase that's what I had on hand. For once, I made beans/peas and it was wiped clean.

I have made this twice.  I have followed the directions and only made slight changes. I put the marinade and drippings from my ham in with everything else. I omit the bacon and salt. I also just throw the whole jalapeno in and mash it up once it is pretty cooked.  Our kids are not yet accustomed to spicy, so we serve over rice with sour cream to mellow the spice.  My husband adds some kind of hot sauce to almost everything he eats and he doesn't add it to this! :)  (As you can tell I generally make this the day after a ham dinner!)  Freezes well...if there are leftovers.

My husband loved this recipe. I left out the jalapeño but will add it next time. I didn't use bacon as there was none in the house but I had a huge ham bone which flavored the beans quite nicely. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Delicious!!! And low fat too. Not too spicy for me- I would call this "medium". Next time I will fix cornbread to go with it. I chopped up everything the night before and threw it together in 10 minutes the next morning. My house smelled so good when I got home.

This recipe is perfect.  I didn't have fresh jalapeno so I used 1 tablespoon diced.  I also added a ham bone.  I will definately make this again.

This turned out even better than expected, and was even better on day 2 (after I combined it with the leftover collard greens). I'm definitely making this again!

Delicious!  I added an extra bouillon cube and didn't actually have ham so doubled the bacon. I also added a few handfuls of fresh spinach 30 minutes before it was done. I'll definitely be making it again!

This is a great recipe,I cooked two batches,since I liked the first one so much,I kept that one for us,and took the second one to work for NewYears Eve potluck,it was a hit.
I think for Dietary purposes,I will try to make it next time with Turkey Bacon and smoked Turkey Thighs.Just for New Years Eve I wanted to make it in the original version for Good Luck :) It was Yummmm

Fantastic recipe that I totally recommend for anyone.  I used chicken broth instead of the cube out of preference.  I also left out the jalapeno chile (for my son's mild taste buds) and the ham (I didn't have any so I just added a bit more bacon).  Everyone loved it.  Going to make again as a main course rather than side along with some cornbread.  Happy New Year!

Smelled great cooking all New Year's Day, and much easier than babysitting a pot of beans and a pot of greens on the stove for an hour.  Peppers gave it a nice kick!

I forgot the red bell pepper but it was still delicious!  It turned out more like soup, and was wonderful.  I didn't use a jalapeno since Iwas also serving my 2-yr old--instead I used 1/2 a yellow chili and 1/2 and anaheim chili.  It gave a nice kick but not overly spicy.  The recipe says "salt to taste" so I guessed and used 1 tsp of salt and it was perfect to me.  Also fyi, I did not pre-soak the beans and they were perfectly cooked after 6 hours on low.  Actually my husband couldn't wait and was eating them at 5 1/2 hrs!

This was incredible! I made it for New Year's Eve and everyone loved it! I wouldn't change a thing, other than it cooked faster than I thought. That is probably my slow cooker, however. I will cook them for 4 hours on low.

This was absolutely delicious!!  Just a little spicy, but perfectly so for us.  I used frozen peas so I don't think I would have needed the 6 cups of water, but all I did was remove it from my crockpot and put it in a dutch oven to cook down the liquid.  It was fantastic!  Definitely will be making again!

Great dish!  I've never really like black-eyed peas until I made this.  I did change it a bit: - Used one can of low-sodium chicken broth instead of the bouillon and changed the water to 5 cups - Used more cayenne and cumin that called for (at least a 1/4 teaspoon more) - No salt - 2 jalapenos and 2 med red peppers - Cooked on low for 8 hours and severed over cornbread.    Fantastic!  I'll be making this dish much more than once a year!

I always soak the peas overnight, and loved this recipe! The only think I did differently was use chicken stock instead of the bouillon.  Otherwise this is a keeper!

I have been making refried beans and after making this recipe my husband said he would rather have this instead! The only thing I did different was double the pieces of bacon because I had no ham on hand (tastes great without it!). I also didn't have the jalapeno so I substituted 3 anaheim peppers and left out the bell pepper. Will definatly make again!

Great dish, I made or with turkey ham and turkey bacon; we did not have a jalepeno so I used green chilies in the can.  It was so good!!!  Will definitely make again.

Made a few changes like added carrots and celery, no bacon, green chilis instead of jalepeno and jar of roasted peppers instead of fresh (what I had on hand) but sooo tasty. I will make this again and often!

Big hit served with white rice.  I will try with ham hocks next time to get a bit more of the salty ham flavor.

Just this side of O.K.  Not very spicy.  One little jalapeno pepper won't do it.  Also:  is it a soup?  A stew?  Too little liquid for soup (altho I used chicken broth) and too thin for stew.  I decided to drain it. Then I made it into a salad with the addition of chopped onion, celery, green pepper, a few jalapenos (out of a jar) and as little mayo as I could get away with.  I served it on a bed of soft lettuces and arugula.

My family loves black-eyed peas but I do not (at all). Making these what I called "southwest meets the south", allowed me as well my entire family  to enjoy them . I served them over plain white rice. Very spicey with a great twist. I can now eat black-eyed peas!! Thanks for a great recipe!!

Very good! I halved the recipe, used chicken broth instead of water, added a can of Rotel, and used both red and green bell pepper. Very tasty and filling. I was concerned that the bacon was going to be really limp and off-putting, but it wasn't at all. Thank you!

I also used chicken broth instead of water (5 C), didn't add salt and cooked on low for 6 or 7 hours.  (didn't soak beans) I was in a pinch for spices and used about 1T cajun seasing instead of the spices in this recipe.   They turned out perfect - verry good served with cornbread.

Awesome recipe!  I have made this twice with only a couple of substitutions...chopped green bell pepper instead of red and adding one can chopped tomatoes with green chillies drained.  The presentation colors and taste are wonderful.  Served it yesterday with raves all around...even from a 14-year old who said "This is the first time I have eaten black-eyed peas that didn't taste blah"!  Thanks for an amazing recipe that will remain a fav at our house.

Very heavy, thick dish that sits with you for awhile! It was a decent dish that filled us up (way up) with just one serving and had good complimentary flavors. However, on low, it took closer to nine hours before the peas were completely softened. I don't know if I'll make it again but it was a tasty recipe worth trying (if nothing else, it at least brought me good luck for the New Year!).

This was the best pot of black eye peas EVER!!! Everyone that ate them  loved them!  I made a double batch since I was having people over and wanted to make sure I had enough.  The only changes I made were to use two cans of chicken broth.  I didn't soak the beans and I actually wound up using about 13 cups of liquid (I did two bags of peas) and they were the perfect consistency...not watery or too thick!!!  GREAT recipe...I will be making this for many years to come!!!

This was wonderful!  The texture was very similar to red beans and rice and the flavor was wonderful (and I even left the bacon out due to fat content).  I will make this many, many more times.

GREAT RECIPE.  I USED CHICKEN BROTH INSTEAD OF CUBE.  I USED 1 CAN ROTEL AND LEFT OUT PEPPERS.  ALSO THREW IN A LITTLE THYME AND OREGANO. IT COOKED ON LOW FOR ABOUT 10 HOURS BEFORE BEANS WERE TENDER. I DID NOT SOAK BEANS. YOU COULD SOAK THEM TO SPEED UP TIME IF NEEDED.

I tried this recipe yesterday and it was GREAT!!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the additional salt and it is nice, spicy and flavorful.  I used it as a main dish served over rice.  Cooked it on low for about 7 1/2 hours.  I will definitely be making this again.  Wonderful comfort food for a cold winter night!!

I made it according to the recipe except for adding a chopped green pepper & 3 stalks of chopped celery.  It took less than 4 hours on low for the black-eyed peas to cook (without soaking the peas first).  Still it lacked something in flavor even on the second day.  I added two cans of fire-roasted, diced tomatoes and a tsp. of thyme.  It was delicious & tasted like a variation of Creole Jambalaya.

This was a great recipe. The only change I made was to add a little more bacon because I just love bacon! Had it on New Year's Day and then used leftovers the next day to make bean and cheese tacos. Delicious!

These were awesome!  I'm not a huge black eyed pea eater but my husband being from the south is.  He said it reminded him of being in North Carolina and talked about them all night.  I left out the meat and used chicken broth instead of water and served it over rice.  I did not soak the beans and ended up adding a little more water before they were done and they were perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would.  Absolutely delicisous.  It's like chili only more unique.  What a great new find.

The best Black Eyed Pea recipe I have ever tried. My family loves this! I have made it 5 times. Last week I could not find any fresh jalepeno peppers in my local store and I substituted one small can of diced green chillie peppers. It still came out great, but every one agreed that the original recipe was better.

This is a great recipe.  I used chicken broth instead of the buillon cube.  I also used green pepper instead of red pepper because that is what I had.  I also just used bacon.  I cooked it on low for four hours and turned it up to high for the last two hours.  They were delicious.

I MADE THESE PEAS YESTERDAY.  THEY WERE THE BEST.  I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE CHANGE RECIPES & THEN RATE THEM.  THE ONLY THING I CHANGED WAS THE AMOUNT OF LIQUID.  I DID 5 CUPS OF WATER BUT SOME OF THAT WAS A CAN OF CHICKEN BROTH.  USED A HAM HOCK TOO.  MY HUSBAND & I ATE ALOT OF THESE WITH CHICKEN & CORN BREAD.  GREAT RECIPE.  I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN.  THANKS.

Cooked it on low for six hours, then high for two more hours.  After eight hours total, the peas were still as hard as little buck shot.  Left it on all night on low, and it was really great for breakfast and lunch the next day.

The flavor was great.  I used well-rinsed salt pork and red pepper flakes in place of the ham, bacon and jalapeno.

These are the best black-eyed peas I've ever made!  Even members of my family who don't usually like black-eyed peas like these!  The only thing I changed was using canned chicken broth (2 cans) and no bouillon cube, and made up the rest of the volume with water.  I also used a honey-baked ham bone instead of diced ham and bacon.  They are scrumptious!

These were outstanding.  I added one more jalapeno, a little more ham, and used all chicken broth for liquid.

We all loved, loved, loved these! Great flavor.  But one caveat...I am finding that with my newer oval crockpot it takes less time to cook my dishes than the recipe usually states, as was the case with this recipe. My peas would have been done in 4 hours, but I left them on low while we went to the movies and they were definitely over-cooked and more like a thick stew when we got back :-(  Great taste nevertheless...but I sure do miss my old crockpot.

Definitely a keeper! I made this for New Year's Day and invited another couple for dinner. Everyone loved this dish. I didn't have bacon, but had two ham shank bones that I used instead. It was delicious and we had them for leftovers tonight with cornbread.

I made this soup today and can't stop eating it. I didn't have dried peas so I used canned. I'm not sure it made a difference in the taste since I've never made it before. I slow cooked everything and added the peas once the onions seemed cooked. When I make it next time I'll used canned peas again since everything cooked faster. I believe this would make a great chicken soup, also. Next time I'll leave out the bacon just didn't need the extra calories or flavor. I didn't have cayann either and my mouth is still burning.

Very good recipe.  Made exactly as listed, and my fiance loved it, although it is quite spicy!  Saltiness was definately not a problem even with the bacon and bouillon--I added seasoning salt.  Served with cornbread & honeybutter.  Make sure you have 40 minutes or so prep time--lots of chopping, but so easy once it's in the cooker.

great flavor. i also used chicken broth. in my crockpot at 5.5 hours on low the peas were still crunchy. turned it up to high for 2 hours, peas still a bit crisp, but it was time to eat. the broth was thin, that's fine with me. i did smash some peas to make it thicker.
nice spice level. loved it!

Just like many others this pot pleased even the guys in my house who've never liked Black-eyed peas. The only tip I'll make is if you are using thick-cut ham from the deli add it in the last 15-20 minutes...just enough to warm through. Otherwise you'll end up with tasteless cubes of ham in your beans. (I also added carrots, more bell pepper, thyme and used an immersion blender at the end to puree half of the mixture...my result was creamy, chunky and delicious! We ate it as a main course soup rather than a bean side.)

Use more cumin than suggested. Pretty good for New Years' 2009. Try Hoppin John next year.

I didn't really care for black eyed peas before this recipe.  The spicy is what intrigued me.  I'm a vegetarian so I used vegetable broth and omitted the chicken bouillon and meat. I added Kale towards the end as suggested by another reviewer.  Next time I will add the Kale two hours before time left instead of the one hour in order to make sure it's tender.  My meat eating friend enjoyed this spicy version better than her own!! I will cook this again!!

The peas were tasty, but they did not get done.  I cooked them on high for over 4 hrs and they were still crunchy.  I had to throw them into a pot on the stove and finish, but they got rave reviews.

I made a few changes- used chx stock instead of water- turkey bacon- added a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles- and this was AWESOME!!  My dh said he'd rather have this than crab cakes (which we had last night and he loved!)!!!  That's MAJOR praise from Mr. Picky!  Thanks so much for a great recipe!!!  YUM!!

This is an awesome dish! We made this for our New Year's Day black eyed peas. My mother in law HATES black eyed peas, but my father in law always makes her eat a big dish for good luck. She gobbled this dish up and raved and raved about how good it was. I love that its really easy to prepare - it took us about 15 minutes to chop everything up and add it to the crock pot. I used mesquite smoked ham from the deli cut on the thickest setting and also got the thick cut bacon from our deli. 

When I did a taste test when it was almost done my husband and I thought it was missing something, so I added a bit of chili powder and oregano. We both thought it was perfect afterwards. I didn't use the cayenne pepper the recipe called for because we used a huge jalapeno and didn't take the seeds out. I was spicy, but not unbearable. We like spice though! 

I think this will be a new year's day traditional dish for us now!

This is the best Black eyed peas recipe I have tried.  Its easy to prepare and the little kick of spice is a nice change from the typical black eyed peas dish.  With a side of greens and pan of cornbread you have yourself a meal.

This is by far the BEST slow cooker recipe for black eyed peas. The peas were soft but not mushy and the spicy taste was great!!
