This is SO easy and SO good. I used green olives. It was a great way to use up parsley that is exploding in my tiny herb garden.

WOW. Fantastic! I did add a tiny bit of salt, but that was my only change and my personal preference. This was awesome as a dip for pita chips, pretzels and crackers, but I could totally see using this on an Italian style sandwich or gourmet pizza, which I plan on trying both. Very simple to make with ingredients that I usually always have on hand. I will def be making this again and again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Yum. I didn't have walnuts so used sunflower seeds as a nutty replacement. The pesto still tasted very delicious.
