I wanted to make sure I rated to after making it to make up for the person who gave this 1 star without even having made it. They're really delicious. Sweet without being too sweet. Perfect afternoon pick up.

As written, this recipe didn't work. The consistency of the mix wasn't fine enough that they would roll into cohesive balls. Instead they just fell apart.. Once I ran it through a well-greased food processor, though, it worked perfectly. Most other energy bites I've made called for this step, so I was surprised this one didn't. The flavor is great. Just the right amount of cinnamon and I couldn't even taste the carrots which was perfect for me since I don't care for them. This recipe would lend itself to modifications well, since the flavors are relatively neutral. I might add chia seeds and play with the spices next time.

Big hit with the family which is always my criteria.  I increased coconut to 1.5C  and blended everything in processor.  it wasn't quite coming together so I added a teaspoon of coconut flavor skinny syrup.  can you tell I love coconut?

Nice, simple recipe. If the ingredients don't want to stick together, add a tablespoon of agave nectar or honey and be sure to really smash everything together when forming the balls. I suggest using rubber or plastic gloves so that it doesn't stick to your hands. I did not have to use a food processor, but this should work equally well.

This has too much cinnamon. I like  cinnamon but it was over powering.  I had to add more of all the other ingredients to try to tone the cinnamon down. I will not make them again.
