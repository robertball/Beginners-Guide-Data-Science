As far as the directions go, I'd give a technical score of 3 stars.  There are a few things I would like to add to the directions: Melt the chocolate (at 50% power in the microwave) and add 1 1/2 Tbl. butter in pieces, stirring to blend.  Pour the chocolate into the bottom of a 9" DEEP DISH pie crust, and refrigerate.  (If you want a more subtle chocolate taste, I suggest cutting it to 1 cup choc + 1T butter for a thin layer in the pie - I'll do this next time).  Then in a bowl, beat the sugar and butter first, then add the other things, pouring the corn syrup while you are mixing. Bake in a hot oven on a cookie sheet.  I preferred having a soft layering of chocolate under the pecan layer which would be easy to slice hot or cool. Baking: after 50 minutes, the crust was very brown but the center was not set, so I had to cover it with foil.  Then it cooked quickly. 
As far as taste: it was very rich, very sweet, and very good with vanilla ice cream!  I can't complain about the richness or sweetness, because what pecan pie isn't?  It got the taste test award after Thanksgiving dinner!  Artistic score: 5 stars  

So overall?  4 stars, but now that I know what to do, this will become a traditional pie for holidays worth 5 stars.

Gorgeous but I advise melting the chocolate and the butter before mixing. I added more pecan (twice the amount stated) and used ready rolled puff pastry. It came out absolutely gorgeous, gooey, sticky and heavenly! It was a real success. In all this is an extremely easy to do recipe.

Delicious!  I used chocolate chunks because that's what I had on hand and thought it was perfect... very chocolatey! I didn't have the problem of too much filling... I used a Mrs. Smith's frozen deep dish pie shell and every bit of the filling fit in to it and none ran over even though I put it on a cookie sheet just in case.

This is SOOOOO good.  I kind of disobeyed the directions and I layered the chocolate and then pecans instead of stirring it all together.  I put the chocolate on the crust and then put tons of pecans over it (I think pecan pies never have enough pecans) and then I poured the sugar-y mixture over the top - of course I had extra sugar mixture because I added too many pecans but it was well worth it.  Thanks for the delicious recipe.

I really think the chocolate chips should have been melted with the corn syrup and then mixed in with the nuts, etc.  The flavors would have blended much better if that had been instructed.

I've never had much success with baking...but this recipe looked so easy...and it was!  It turned out very well.  A tad too sweet for my taste (I still enjoyed it), and my husband went nuts over it.  He kept picking at it until I finally put it away!  Next time, I may cut back on the chocolate chips and add a little unsweetened cocoa powder.  Between the sugar and corn syrup it's sweet enough. And my advice to anyone trying this for the first time...make your own crust!  I used a store-bought refigerated pastry crust and was very disappointed.  It was hard and dry.  This pie needs a nice, delicate flaky crust. But overall, it was still very good and I will make it again...with a home-made crust!

Overall, it was a good recipe.  But it made way too much filling.  I used a frozen 9 inch pie crust and could have made two pies from one batch of filling.  Also it was very chocolaty.  If I make it again, I may experiment with different types of chocolate, like a bittersweet baking bar, to try and cut back on some of the sweetness.

I made this yesterday and followed the instructions almost exactly.  I took heed to other reviewers and reduced the chocolate chips to 1 cup and the light corn syrup to 3/4 cup.  But I mixed everything together just like it says to.  Baked 50 minutes then let it cool.  We ate it semi-warm and it was ok.  The next day, after the pie has chilled in the fridge all night, it was delicious!  Definitely make this a day ahead and chill it overnight before serving.  The chocolate chips stay whole and do not melt but, since it's a crunchy pecan pie, you don't seem to notice.  I also used 1 1/2 cups pecans... yum!

The taste was yummy. However, I followed recipe exactly and it overflowed while baking. Thank goodness it was on a cookie sheet, b/c it was alot of overflow. Also, the top got a little over done and I didn't even bake as long as reccomended. This pie is fabulous with vanilla ice cream!

This pie was fantastic.  I made it for Thankgiving and it was gone by the end of the day.  I was very rich but tastefully so.  I will be making this again very soon.  The filling was a little to much for the pie pan and I ended up leaving a bit out.  And I was fortunate for the cookie sheet underneath because it did run over. It took about 5-10 extra minutes to get the center to set and I ended up putting foil around the crust edges to prevent over browning/burning.  Thanks for the easy delicious recipe!

This pie was a hit at my first Thanksgiving!  It's so easy to make and the finished product tastes like you slaved over a hot oven for hours!  Would work well for any occasion.  Bring it to work and your coworkers will think you're the best.  Who are you to mention how easy it is!

i love this recipe. it's very easy and i've done it about five times. I usually put the chocolate chips in there the way they are, but one time i tried melting them first and mixing it with the filling. I think i prefer the whole chips in there.

This was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving this year, no one even noticed the pumpkin pie! The bad part was that I only got half of a piece myself, so I'm making it again for Christmas dinner!!

Loved this.  I don't bake a lot so like it to be easy and fool proof when I do. I did melt the chocolate chips with the butter and used a deep dish pie shell. Family loved it.

I followed the recipe exactly and this pie was excellent. After reading all the suggestions to melt the chocolate, I decided I didn't want to do that bc I wanted chunks of chocolate throughout, so I left the chips alone, like the recipe says. The only issue I faced was cooking time. The center was essentially still liquid after 50 min so I covered the pie in foil for another 15 min and it was done. I brought this to Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit with my family.

Excellent.  Melted the butter and chocolate prior to adding.  Baked at 350 for 50 minutes, then covered with foil at 375 for 15 minutes and was perfect.  This is very "chocolatey" and I would not change a thing in regards to proportion.

I definitely reccomend melting the chocolate chips and butter first. I just made it and it does not look fudgy and brown. It is light tan with chocolate throughout. I agree heavily about the deep dish pie crust. My pie is on the verge of overflowing! It is also taking FOREVER to cook through. The top is starting to burn but the center is still very wiggly. I am not sure I will make this again! That is what I get for not reading reviews first!

My family and I enjoyed this rich pie in small pieces.  I agree with others, though, that it had too many chocolate chips.  Next time I will use only 1 cup.

This pie is wonderful!  It was so easy to make and tasted like a little piece of chocolate heaven.  (On a side note however, I always have a hard time telling when they are done, so I ended up baking mine for about an hour and had no problems.)

I'd give this 10 stars if I could. A must for chocolate lovers. How can something so easy to make taste so good? I had a little trouble getting all my filling into the shell. Be sure to place a baking sheet under pie as some of the chocolate spilled over. I also cut my halved pecans in half again to make them bite sized.

First pecan pie I've made. Easy to make.  I melted the chocolate in the microwave and stirred in.  Based on reviews, I cut back the chocolate to 1C, and used a very bittersweet chocolate.  As well, I added 1T of bourbon, which you could taste the first day, but not later.  Delicious!  My mother-in-law requested the recipe and father-in-law ate 1.5 pieces, and he's a diabetic! :) Worth it! (I baked some sweet potatoes in the oven at the same time, and it worked great!)

This pie quickly started browning heavily for an almost-burnt appearance.  I lowered the heat a little and cooked the minimum amount of time to help but by the end, it looked like slightly-burnt meringue on top.  The one change I made was using butter instead of margarine.  It tasted decent but wasn't attractive.

Delish...this was so easy and good that next time I will make 2 as there wasn't any left. I made it just the way the recipe stated and I didn't have any trouble with the chocolate chips, everything cooked perfectly. I put it in to cook while we were eating our Thanksgiving dinner, when we got through eating and cleaning up it was ready. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream and it was so good! Thank you for the recipe, this will be one of my go to pies for many years to come!

I cooked pie for 65 minutes and it still didn't get done in the center. The edge of the pie was overcooking so I had to stop the baking process.  Ended up with a pie that was hard on the edges and runny in the middle.  The actual taste wasn't too bad though.  Just a little too sweet for my taste.  I melted my chocolate with the butter and maybe that's what messed the baking time up.   Also, it needs something other than store-bought pie crust.  It was just too overwhelming. Update: ok....after the pie sat overnight, it set up a bit more and the taste is fantastic.  I could eat it all before company arrives!

I followed the recipe word for word and ended up with chocolate CHIP pecan pie. Not what I was expecting, and not what I wanted.  Next time I will either melt the chocolate first or try a different recipe.

Simple easy recipe that my family loved. I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips because I was afraid it would be too sweet. I also had a little extra left over after I filled the pie crust, but I just spooned out the choc chips and pecans and poured out the remaining juice. All in all, good recipe.

Great tasting pie but too sweet for our liking. Next time, will definitely reduce the chocolate quantity to half or even just a handful. I've seen other recipes where they just add a handful of chocolate chips on the bottom of the pie and then pour the mixture. Thanks anyways!

This pie is amazing but definately for the chocolate lover! It is extremely rich and I thought the flavor got better after it sat for a few hours.

Great pie and easy to make!  I will definitly make this again.  Only thing I would do different next time is add 1c of chocolate chips rather than the 1.5c the recipe calls for.

I followed the recipe almost as written except I melted the chocolate chips and butter as suggested by a few reviewers. The chocolate overpowered the pecans. This is more of a chocolate pie with pecans. I may try this again and not melt the chocolate.

Omg.... this was everything I hoped for and more. I was craving chocolate AND pecans and this was just the thing I needed! However, I did use butter instead of margarine and I used the 70% cocoa chocolate bars I had instead of semi sweet chips. I also melted the chocolate and the butter together because I just thought it would be a smoother consistency in the end. It was just wow and I will definitely make it again.  Oh, and I live in a place where store bought pie crust is not available so a homemade butter crust was the absolute bomb as well

This was a big hit.  I would not melt chocolate chips as some have recommended if you want the chunks in the bottom once it's cooled.  Simplest is make a layer of chips per pan size and amount you want (between 1 & 1 1/2 c) Arrange pecans halves in a design to be fancy, Then pour blended liquid ingredients over, rearrange nuts, making sure they get flipped right side up.   Ya gotta use butter instead of margarine and the filling was plenty sweet with 1/4 c each brown and white sugar and 3/4 c corn syrup; that might help with the overflow problem some had; I also added 1 t vanilla.

My mom and I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. We altered the directions quite a bit and added more chocolate chips. First we melted butter and added chocolate chips. Then we added the remaining ingredients mixing with an electric mixer at eat addition. The pie was consistent throughout. We added pecan halves to the top of the pie to beautify it. Very good.

It overflowed and burnt, you need a deep dish pie shell. And it was waaay too sweet. I have an aversion to really sweet things, this made me nauseous. I would cut back on the sugar or corn syrup.

This is the chocolate pecan pie recipe I used this Thanksgiving. SO rich, SO delicious, it did not survive the first round. Highly recommend.  I upped the pecans to be equivalent to the chocolate chips, because I always think there should be more pecans. I did not melt the chocolate, and was pleased with the results.

Not what I expected. This was very very rich because you are eating mouthfuls of chocolate chips. As other reviewers mentioned, the chocolate chips did not melt at all & it was more like "chocolate chip pie with nuts". 
I was expecting more of a "pecan pie like filling along with some chocolate fudgy-ness". Maybe I will try it again & melt the chocolate first & then mix in the nuts -- before baking. Or else I may just try another recipe. On the fence.

This is pretty good but I've made/had better.  I just wanted a quick and easy recipe so I used this one. The chocolate chips don't melt and give a crunch, so melt them or don't depending on your preference. I only put half the chocolate chips this calls for (all I had) and there was plenty of chocolate and no filling overflow.

I used pre-made pie shells that were HEB's brand, and there was enough filling for two full pies!  Maybe those shells were especially shallow, but I'm glad they come in packages of two.  Not that I'm complaining - this college kid has plenty of hungry friends!
I might melt the chocolate first next time - it's more of a chocolate chip pecan pie, right now.

If you love rich desserts and chocolate this pie is for you.  I've used chocolate chunks as well as chips and both work great.

I used egg beaters for the eggs & I subbed white chocolate chips for the semi-sweet. Yummy! Because of reviews saying it was too sweet, I cut the sugar back to half a cup & decreased the chips to one cup. Used a homemade pie crust & garnished w/ a dollop of maple-flavored whipped cream & sprinkled that w/ some raw sugar. Fantastic pie...thanks Karin Christian!

I made this pie for my husband, who had never had pecan pie (from a different country), and he decided he didn't like pecan pie after that!  This recipe was way too sweet.  I made a regular pecan pie later, and my husband liked it.  If I make this again, I will reduce the amount of sugar and/or corn syrup and use dark chocolate or baking chocolate.

Delicious and FUDGY!  I add 1 TBS. of bourbon to give it extra flavor.  Serve with whipped cream or ice cream to cut the richness.
