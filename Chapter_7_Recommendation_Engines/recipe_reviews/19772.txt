Be sure to dip the zucchini in an egg & milk mixture first. I've been frying them for years and it works well to hold the coating on.

It does not work real well with cornmeal. You must use cornflake crumbs. Dip the zucchini slices in an egg/milk mix, cover with cornflake crumbs and then fry. This is the right way to do it. Trust me. Been doin' it for years.

Very healthy excellent taste. I found if zucchini is rinsed and wet the cornmeal sticks much better.

I'm only giving this four stars because the proportions are off on ingredients and I think that the preparation of these could be improved upon.

My mom has been making this for years but we always use an egg wash.  So I used one small zucchini (enough for me since nobody else was going to eat any) and cut it into round slices about 1/4" thick.  Then I dredged them in egg beaters (about 1/4 cup was plenty) then in about 1/2 cup cornmeal in which I added the salt, pepper and some garlic powder and onion powder.  I heated an even layer of olive oil in the frying pan until water drops sizzled and added the slices and kept an eye on them and turned them when they had browned on the first side, maybe about 4 to 5 minutes.  then I browned the other side and then put them on a cookie rack over paper towel to drain.  

They came out tender on the inside and flavorful and crunchy on the outside.  Ate them with some ranch dressing for dipping and they totally took care of my craving for fried zucchini.

I tried this and was pleasantly surprised. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used a "wash" with milk first before dipping the zucchini in the cornmeal. I also added flour to the cornmeal, which I think made for a better coating. Will try other suggestions next time but we all agreed this one was easy enough and pretty tasty.

Not a success. The cornmeal doesn't adhere and is very gritty all by itself on the zucchini. I enjoyed a recipe that used seasoned breadcrumbs as the breading and an egg wash dunk to get the breadcrumbs to stick better than this alternative.

I really loved this very simple recipe. It didn't take as long as it said it would, but I cooked the Zucchini on medium high heat.

Wasn't bad; although, I felt there was time-consuming work here.  Cornmeal did not want to stay on the zucchini, and they were difficult to brown.

The best way to fry zucchini and for that matter fried green tomatos, same way is to follow the directions Judy Sing gives but first cut your slices no thinner than a Quarter of an inch other wise they become dry during the cooking period. whip up a bowl of eggs 3 or 4 and first dip them in the egg. then put them in a bowl of 3 quarters corn meal and 1 quarter flour with salt and pepper. Cook at medium high heat until brown on both sides. It's nice to have at least a half inch of oil in pan while cooking. I'm 53 now and been cooking these veggies way since I was 12 years old, from my Grandma.

I have never made this with cornmeal or without milk and egg mixture. I always just use what's handy (some ritz crackers, or cornflakes crunched up) Turns out excellent every time!!!

This is a great base recipe. You can always add to the cornmeal to make it a little more spicy or a little more savory. The cornmeal breadding is meant to be light. If you want a thicker coating-dredge in egg.

I've never eaten zucchini other than in cakes, so I thought I'd try something different. I did end up dipping each slice in almond milk before coating them with cornmeal, and they turned are great!

I actually followed Jenelle D's suggested recipe, egg wash plus 1/2 c cornmeal with salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. I also added my own little twist of paprika to the mix, and it was delicious!!

Good recipe. I prefer to fry this in butter for alittle added taste but it's not as healthy as olive oil. Also i use flour as it sticks better than cornmeal but if you don't wash and leave alittle wet nothing is going to stick anyway.

I have always coated the sliced zucchini in half cornmeal/half flour (with lots of garlic powder, pepper and a little salt). That is how my grandma from Alabama always made it and it is so delicious!

I dredged freshly washed zucchini slices in cornmeal, and the cornmeal had no problem sticking. I fried in Earth Balance margarine and sprinkled crushed red pepper and a little sea salt on them as they were cooking. Yum!

My mother did zucchini like this all her life. She would slice it and put it in a single layer in a dish and sprinkle sugar on it to draw it's natural moisture.  She also mixed some flour into the cornmeal.  We liked it somewhat crunchy and sprinkle parmas. cheese on top.  We couldn't wait for her to put it on the drain/paper towel!!

Good and simple! The cornmeal wasn't sticking for me and I had used all my eggs on zucchini bread the day before. I found that adding salt to the cornmeal drew enough moisture out of the zucchini to get the cornmeal to stick. You might as well mix the pepper and any other spice right into the cornmeal. This is also great with Parmesan cheese.

The cornmeal did not stick and ended up sticking to the bottom of the pan, leaving a pan of oily zucchini. Next time I would follow other readers' advice and use some sort of "wash" to make the meal stick. Also, the flavor seemed very bland.

I added onion and garlic powder and dipped it in egg wash before coating it. It was yummy.

i really didnt like this fried zucchini recipe. i found that it did not cook well, though i followed the directions exactly, and that the cornmeal retained a grainy, unpleasant texture and taste. i even gave it a second try using an egg dip. but i will definitely not be trying it again.

Not bad... I actually liked the cornmeal rather than just plain flour.  I added diced onions as the variation, along with some garlic powder to help the flavor a bit.  I soaked the zucchini in water immediately before dipping in the cornmeal, so it stuck no problem.  :)

I used a mixture of half cornmeal and half flour. It still gave the crispiness of the cornmeal but without it being gritty. I would make this again.

This is good but I think (and the family agrees) that it is actually better without the cornmeal. Thank you for the recipe!!!

I've never had fried zuchini, so I don't have anything to compare it too, but I thought it turned out pretty decent.  I made it for just myself, so next time I will try it on someone else.  I used the milk wash and added a little flour to the cornmeal like others suggested, and didn't have any real problems with the process.  I do feel like it could use some more flovor in the breading but I haven't figured out what yet.

Didn't like this... the cornmeal never got soft - added a grainy texture that my husband and I found off-putting.  Next time, will try flour instead.

I've tried frying zucchini with a bread crumb coating (like with eggplant) and was never pleased with it, I hadn't thought of using cornmeal but thanks for this recipe because it turned out great! Makes a great snack.

Recipe was meant for a lighter version than the heavy flour /egg breading that absorbs a lot of oil...I rinsed my slices with water before dipping.
There are a lot of breaded zucchini recipes out there that cover up the zucchini flavor, this one does not..


My mother tried corn flakes, it basically drowns out the zucchini flavor...This would be fine if you trying to get kids to eat it

I dipped mine in egg before I put it in the cornmeal. It fried up crisp and tasted very good. I also fried in coconut oil.

Others claim dipping it in egg and milk. Milk absorbs fat. Water repels fat. So if you dont want them greasy..dont use milk.  if you want heavier coating..water and egg works but you lose that crispy crunch. Cooked this for years. Like the light texture.

The cornmeal doesn't stick to the zucchini very well, and they burn real quick. Also, if you don't eat them right away, they turn soggy and grainy from the cornmeal. If I do try this again, I'll modify it the way other reviews have suggested. Thanks for letting me try though.

this just didn't work right -- i'm not sure what i did wrong.  i probably won't try it again and stick to eating this in the restaurants.
