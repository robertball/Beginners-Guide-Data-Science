This salad was great! Love it! I don't have a spiral slicer, so I simply sliced the veggies into thin strips - worked fine.  The next time I make it, I'm going to add in some pasta for fun.

I will make this again, with some modifications.  First time, I didnâ€™t like it with only balsamic for dressing.  I added a little red wine vinegar and olive oil as well, and liked that better.  I may also try it with a citrus vinaigrette.

I Added balsamic reduction instead of just balsamic vinegar, it's a bit sweeter. 
This was a beautiful, fresh and easy recipe. The only effort was using the spiral. ( and a vegetable peeler would do the trick )

Great super easy salad to make. Husband was even pleasantly surprised with how good it was. Definitely a great way to use zucchini.
