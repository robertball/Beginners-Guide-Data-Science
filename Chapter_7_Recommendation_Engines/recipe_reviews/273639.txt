I have tried many versions of lentil soup and declare this the best. The secret ingredient separating it from other recipes is the lemon cashew butter. It's creamy and delicious. Also it is not difficult to make I just buzzed it up in my little bullet blender.

Tastes even better the next day. Wasn't sure if I'd like lemon soup, so I customized it with a few tweaks - added ginger and fenugreek in the beginning, but turns out coriander is the best flavor. I loved the cashew cream but also stirred in two tempered beaten egg yolks. I also used collard greens rather than spinach, which take longer to cook, so my lentils dissolved. This is a great kitchen sink soup, so next time I'll add sweet potato rather than the regular potato I tried.
