Frozen bananas is the trick!  I read the reviews about it being too runny so I ran to my freezer and got out my bag of frozen bananas.  I also just added the honey to taste.  There turned out thick and frothy.  The kids are sucking them down as we speak.

Quite runny, I froze mine for about 30 minutes and it was better.  It seems like it has too much honey for my liking, but if you love honey it is perfect for you.

This had too much honey for my taste and was too runny. I ended up adding a couple of tablespoons of ice-cream to thicken it up.

Very, very delicious! I looked at the other reviews and decided to half the honey. I added ice, and it was perfect! Very healthy, as well. I will make this again :)

This is a great basic recipe that you can experiment with and make better.  I think frozen bananas is the key.  I let bananas sit for about 10 minutes until they could be peeled easily.  I put them in the blender along with the remaining ingredients and 1 pkg. of  chocolate Carnation Instant Breakfast.  I only used about 1 Tbsp. of honey.  The drink was delicious, thick, and frothy.  My husband thought it had ice cream in it.

A good banana smoothie. I froze 2 medium ripe bananas that I cut into chunks last night, and I cut down on the amount of honey to 1/8 cup. I did not want it too sweet.  I used 1/2 tsp of banana extract in place of the vanilla extract called for in the recipe to give it more of a "banana-y" taste. I used 2 cups of skim milk. I blended it up and I could taste the banana flavor in the smoothie. However, I think the next time I would definitely reduce the amount of milk to 1 1/2 cup, or even 1 cup, since I like a thick, frothier smoothie. The 2 cups of milk with 2 ripe bananas gave the smoothie a "thinner" consistency. I threw in a handful of ice cubes to make it more cold and thicker to suit my tastes. This was easy to make, the banana flavor is there and a good morning starter!

I was wanting a nice, cold, refreshing drink after a long summer day. I knew I had bananas in the kitchen, and decided to make a smoothie. I tried this recipe, and wasn't very impressed. It was too foamy after I blended it, and the lack of ice cream resulted in a drink too warm for my taste.

I agree that it is a bit runnier than I'd prefer, but it was very delicious! I think next time I plan to have a smoothie, I'll freeze the bananas ahead of time to see if that does thicken this up, as others have suggested.

Good, but I have a version I like a little better.  For 1 serving, I did 2 heaping spoonfuls of plain yogurt (not the lowfat variety;  I'm a firm believer that whole foods such as milk, yogurt, butter, etc. are good fats as long as they are done in moderation), 1 cup whole milk, 1 medium banana, 1-2 tsp. of honey (depending on your preference), and 1-2 shakes of cinnamon (also depending on your preference).  I throw it all in the magic bullet and it whips together nicely (make sure to add the honey last so that it does not stick to the sides of the bowl/cup).
This is very good, and as far as I'm concerned, very healthy!

I made this today for my family and it was delicious! I made this with 3 frozen bananas instead of 2 and i added a little less honey. It was gone so fast that not everyone got some (I had 2 large glasses myself). I plan on making this again!

Mine came up with a consistency of soft-served ice cream. Reading previous reviews, I halfed the honey and used frozen bananas. I added 2/3 cup powdered nonfat milk, and substituted liquid milk with 2 cups full of crushed ice and vanilla almond milk. Tastes great. My sweet toothed son won't mind the extra honey called for in the original recipe though. Hmm...so nutritious!

This was the best smoothie I ever tasted.  I added about 6 ice cubes to make it a little thicker.  Since no one else in the family likes bananas, I had it all to myself lol...will definitely make again.

Is easy, but it is too sweet.  I do like the fact that it doesn't include any eggs in the recipe.  Don't know if I'll try it again, but if I do, I'll use much less honey.

I made a great smoothie in the end but only after I adjusted the reciepe. I used half the recommended amount of honey, and it was just the perfect amount of sweetness. If it had been anymore honey it would have been much too sweet. I put in three bananas to give my smoothie extra thickness, and I threw in four or so ice cubes as well. Came out delicious! I strongly recommend using my version of the reciepe, as  I'm pretty sure the smoothie would not have been wayyy too sweet with THAT much honey.

This banana smoothie was pretty good, although I didn't have enough milk so I ended up using only one cup. And I also advise using much less honey, because I only used two tbsp and it's really sweet, so 1/4 cup would have been rediculously too much.

It was more like banana milk than a smoothie.   I had to add 2 trays of ice cubes to thicken it up.   But it was still too sweet.

Excellent! I didn't make any changes except scaling the serving size down to one and using real vanilla instead of extract. It was amazing! It isn't thick, but it is a smoothie after all, not a milkshake. Looking forward to making it again.

Kids liked this. Added a little nutmeg and a couple tbsp. of flax seed. The ripeness of the bananas and using the honey was plenty sweet on it's own.

I just tried this following the recipe, but next trial, instead using vanilla extract, I use vanilla ice cream. it make the smoothie got thicker.. Then I minimize honey added a bit sweet condensed milk to get the sweet taste and thicker also one teaspoon lime juice to make a little surprise when you sip it..  *don't add too much lime juice, it make the milk separate from the mixture..*

Good basic banana smoothie. I did halve the honey and used real vanilla beans. My kids liked it and my husband said it was good. I used sliced up frozen bananas I had in a baggie in the freezer. It gave 2 large portions or 3 small.

This is a delicious smoothie.  I really enjoyed how quickly it went together.  Next time I will take some of the others advice and freeze the bananas. Today, I also added a kiwi and some frozen strawberries as I feel this recipe is a blank slate.

I really love this recipe! I always use frozen bananas that I keep in the fridge. It's great to freeze them just when they are ripe and pull them out whenever you're ready for a smoothie.

I even find that this recipe is great for breakfast and keeps me full until lunch. And, if you use raw honey, you get the extra added vitamins.

My kids and I thought these were delicious and they were so easy to make!  I read about it being too runny and sweet, so I made it with 3 frozen bananas, 2 cups milk, 1/2 tsp. vanilla and only 1/2 the amount of honey.  Turned out great!  We're freezing the mixture in cups to try it as popsicles right now.  I'll have to update when we try those!

It's thin. Exremely thin. Maybe finding a way and posting it to make it thicker may help. Havent tasted it yet though. Still in the process of thickening it. Thanks. :)
