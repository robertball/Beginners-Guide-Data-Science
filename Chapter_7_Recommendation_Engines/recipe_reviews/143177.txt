I needed a quick pasta sauce, and threw this together in a hurry!  I added some basil and oregano, and a few shakes of parmesian cheese, very yummy!

I only used 2 garlic cloves, and added Italian seasoning as others suggested. I also used a potato masher to break the tomatoes down into more of a saucy consistency. I added a little chicken broth and reduced the sauce to make it thicker, and threw in a little sugar because I like a sweeter sauce. It was delicious!

This is 5 stars for a SIMPLE, quick tomato sauce. I needed a quick sauce for meatball sandwiches and this worked really well. Next time, I'll try adding a little Italian seasoning. Try this recipe!

This was a quick and easy sauce.  Also very yummy.  I added a tablespoon of prepared pesto and it was delicious.  I will be using this recipe again.

Very easy and simple. I love that the ingredients are items I typically have in the cupboard.
Other than wishing I would have used the small diced tomatoes instead of the chunky ones, recipe was great.  Per other reviews, I added Italian Seasoning and Oregano for additional flavor - glad I did.

Very good sauce.  My husband loves making it and even more he loves eating it.  We always double the recipe because we both like lots of sauce on our pasta.

As others suggested, I added 1Tbsp of Italian seasoning and also used canned tomatoes that were seasoned with onions, garlic and basil. I would add some tomato paste next time and decrease the olive oil by half so that the sauce is thicker and sticks to the noodles. Nice recipe to play with. Would make this again.

I made this today and it was delicious! I used pureed tomato sauce instead of whole tomatoes (kids like it better); I used a garlic press rather than finely chopping the garlic; and I only  used 2 large cloves instead of 4. I serve this with buttered bow tie pasta and a couple of handfuls of grana padana. This was a great dish on hot a summer day! Thanks for the recipe, Lissa!

Very simple and what I liked about it.... no sugar!!! It is not suppose to be a desert and when I make mine, which is much more extensive, there is no sugar or any substitute for it. Sugar is unhealthy as we all know. Save it for the desert! Godknows most of us like desert! A touch of apple cider vinegar may improve the taste with a little more salt for this one.

I made this with Roma tomatoes from a friends garden, instead of the canned variety. It is an amazing base, and so easy and quick. I think you could really have this as is or make it your own with spices.

I made this as is and it tasted like canned diced tomatoes. No flavor at all. I looked at what other people did and took some of their suggestions. I added about a tablespoon of Italian seasoning, used four garlic cloves (minced), a sprinkling of crushed red pepper, salt and pepper. Also, I did not drain the tomatoes. I thought it came out pretty good. It was a thin sauce (which I like) and I was not up with heartburn all night. As written, I would give it one star.

Delicious! Needs a boost with seasonings, but an excellent base. Sautéed onion first, then followed recipe and added mushrooms and fresh spinach, as well as oregano and basil.

I've made this so many times! Its quick and easy! I added Italian herb seasoning as most had recommended along with fresh italian parsley and fresh basil. I leave it on the stove top on medium heat for about 10-15 minutes. I top it off with freshly grated pecorino romano. I'll never eat ready-made pasta sauce from the grocery ever again.

I have made this for years, using up tomatoes from the garden  fresh is best...so quick --  then if a big batch --  freeze in batches for a meal, good when you are on your own and quick.  good recipe
