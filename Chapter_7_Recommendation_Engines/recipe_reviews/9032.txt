oh boy this is a keeper! i threw this together in NO TIME (i mean less than 15 minutes!!) i did do a few changes...
1. i used frozen mixed veggies instead of mushrooms. i just added them with the soup and let it simmer to cook them thru.
2. i used much less than 1 cup milk because i wanted to sauce to be thicker.
3. i added diced red onion to the dish...cooked the onions down with the chicken so they'd be translucent and a bit sweet.
4. i baked up refridgerator biscuits to put the mixture on top of. 

overall it was absolutely delicious and what i loved best was just how easy it was to assemble. a quick and yummy dish for those nights when we're tired!

I double this recipe, add peas ( left over ones to clean out fridge works well), omit the fresh mushrooms, and add a small can of mushrooms, and omit the pimentos.  Add a  'bit' of garlic pwdr, use reg oil and extra chicken broth.and this is a wonderful FAST meal to work up after a hard day at work.  We love this on Buttered Crosaunts (sp?)

My kids loved it!  Definately something we'll have again!  My husband doesn't care for Creamy dishes, it worked great for nights my husband was working and used up my leftover Thanksgiving Turkey at the same time!

Fantastic! It looked easy, so I left it for my husband to make while I was occupied, and he thought it was VERY easy and tasty. We served it over garlic-cheese biscuits. Leftovers look wonderful, and this recipe will live forever in our household! Thank you!!!

This was very easy and very filling. I served it over white rice and followed another reviewers comment about adding a can of cream of mushroom vs. the cream of chicken. Very delicious. Will make again.

This was so easy to cook.  It took 20 minutes start to finish.  My husband loved it!!!  He had several helpings and took some for left overs.  I will make this on a regular basis. I put it over biscuits and even my picky toddler loved it.  I also added more veggies to it and gave it a bit more flavor.

Very simple recipe. I substituted cream of chicken with herb and added celery salt, peas and real onions. Lightly season the chicken before cooking because that will give it the kick it deserves.

I made this dish tonight, and it was great, and oh so simple to put together, after standing for 10 hours in the office!  I had it made in 15 minutes tops.  I did tweek it a bit though, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and about 2 tbsp of dried parsley, I also added about 1/3 cup of chopped onion, didn't have pimentos so I added peas and carrots (frozen) and served it over toast cut into cubes!  It was delicious!  Will make this again.  Thanks Jill!

I followed this recipe to a T and it was soooo good!  I used it for my Church home group and they all loved it and wanted the recipe, so, I told them to go to allrecipes.com!  The taste of this brought back some childhood memories of when my mother used to make it for us.  Thank you!

This was really delicious! My whole family loved it! I served mine with brown rice that I cooked in beef broth. I also added some fresh peas and an onion from my garden. It was delicious! This is a recipe that is very versatile. I love recipes like that. Thanks!

I thought this was great for what it is! I addeed asparagus and used cream instead of milk. I also BBQ the chicken like another reveiwer. I did not know what to expect but it was like a glorified biscuits and gravy. Very good!

The Boyfriend liked this dish - we didn't have potatoes to serve it over but we served it over toast and it was pleasant. I did not use a can of cream-of-chicken soup though. I went ahead and used flour and butter to thicken chicken stock instead.

The jury is still out.  (DH)  As I am cooking this right now, the sauce is wonderful.  I sauteed the chicken with fresh mushroom that needed to be used, I seasoned it all with s&p and driend onions and garlic.  I also added peas and corn.  Going to serve it over grands biscuits.  I halved the recipe since it's the first time around, but I will probably make a full one next time and freeze it.    ETA:  It was supberb!  And DH loved it.

I would give this 5 stars, but I tweaked it by adding peas, diced red and green pepper, and some friend onions, so in fairness I can't give a recipe 5 stars when I haven't cooked it as it is.

Not bad but not exceptional either. My boyfriend thought the sauce was too runny and a little bland as well.

I revised this one a bit for my picky-eater kids.  I left out the mushrooms.  I also used leftover chicken.  This meal was ready in a flash, perfect for a weeknight, and really tasty.  I'll be making this again.

Tasted like what it was - chicken and cream soup.  Not sure why I was expecting anything else.  :)  Probably won't make again but thanks for the recipe.

This is true comfort food.  I liked what one gal said how you can do anything to it.  I added peas, carrots, onion, and a can of corn.  I used about 3/4 can of half and half.  As one reviewer stated, I seasoned chicken before cooking with onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  It came out perfect.

My mom used to make this. I've just kind of forgotten about it untill AR. I didn't put mushrooms in it [didn't have it] or the peppers. I chopped a small onion in it, and used one chicken boullion. I had to have peas. Thanks for bringing back some great memories.

This was easy to prepare.  I added frozen peas and chopped turkey bacon which definitely gave it more flavor. I served it over brown rice.

I really like this recipe but I add a few more veggies and use less milk to make it thicker.  So instead of fresh mushrooms, grab a handful of organic frozen veggies that I quickly thaw in the microwave for 45 secs before adding to the sauce. A very quick and easy meal

This is my quick standby meal lately. I don't keep pimentos on hand but I often have bell peppers, so I throw those in. Other then that I make the recipe as is.

This was fantastic! I did follow some of the suggestions and made a few changes, but with these small changes you can have a delicious meal in almost no time.  I seasoned the chicken with generously with celery salt before cooking and diced some onion to add to cook with the chicken.  I also reduced the amount of milk to 3/4 cup.  I also left out the pimento peppers just because we don't like them. It was perfect. My husband raved over it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a breeze to whip up and tasted delicious over country style biscuits.  I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and some Italian seasonings to the chicken as it was browning as well as some orange bell pepper, onions, and broccoli florets.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is a wonderful "Keeper" recipe. I found that it works wellwith either cream chicken soup or mushroom. If using mushroom, I add fresh garlic to the cooking mushrooms and  1TB of brown spicy mustard to the sauce as it heas through. Its a delicious change. I use peas with the mushroom version and any frozen vege mix I happen to have on hand to the chicken version Delightful over bisquits or rice or even elbow mac!

Great recipe.  I added canned peas, because I didn't have frozen.  I also added about a teaspoon of paprika.  When I served it I put a dollop of sour cream on each serving.  I didn't have any refrigerator biscuits, so we served ours over Texas Toast.

The first time I made the dish it was a little bland, but it's easy.  Since then, I have added bell pepper instead of pimentos and Rotel while the chicken sautees.  At the end, I put in crushed tortilla chips to give a little crunch.  

Great base recipe...kick it up however you like.

Very good recipe.  Will definitely make again.  It was a bit runny and will make it thicker next time.

Great Recipe. Fairly easy. Not sure how many people keep pimentos laying around, but okay.  One thing I did find lacking was the organization of the recipe itsself. "Step 1" consisted of multiple steps. You can't just say it's a single step so that it fits in the "easy" category.

This was good! I used bell pepper and onions instead of pimento peppers. I also added extra chicken and a can of cream of mushroom. Served over brown rice with cheesy garlic bread...

This satisfying meal was  quick and easy to make with items on hand.  As suggested by other reviewers, I seasoned the chicken with a little salt and pepper prior to sauteeing it with chopped onions and celery.  I also used  frozen mixed vegetables in place of the mushrooms  (only because I didn't have any mushrooms at the time).  I also added a little poultry seasoning for a little more flavor.  Served over cooked noodles, it was both filling and delicious!  Two thumbs up!

I thought it needed a bit of something. Crushed a chicken bouillon in it. Added a few mixed veggies I had left over, served over rice. We liked it.

It was a great dish and fairly fast but I did tweet it a bit - substituted & I added a few things: I used a large leftover chicken Breast which I cut into cubes, added leftover chopped cooked carrots, 1 cup of frozen green beans, and 1/8 cup of freshly toasted pine nuts 1/2 cup of Zinfandel & 6 minced cherry tomatoes replaced the pimentos (my family doesn't like pimentos) took 25 minutes and man my family ate it up - didn't have the heart to tell them it was made with mostly leftovers!!

Definitely easy. I used fresh carrots and peas instead of the pimentos. Whipped up a fresh batch of biscuits, and the meal was done. Great worknight choice.

Quick to make, but somewhat bland, even after I added several more tablespoons of various spices recommended in other reviews.  It would probably be better with more salt.

I didnt use mushrooms since my husband isn't a big fan. I just threw in a frozen mix veggie bag and it turned out perfect! We made lots of leftovers for those nights where you just don't feel like cooking.

This was easy and quick but we felt it was way too bland to make again.  I added mixed frozen veggies and garlic, served over egg noodles but didn't help to pep it up enough.
