I used leftover smoked chicken so I skipped steps 1&2. Because I didn't  have the reserved water I used boxed chicken stock in its place.  Due to the pie taking an hour to bake, I think leftover seasoned chicken or a rotisserie chicken is a time saver here. What I liked best about this recipe is how you could use whatever veggie you had on hand. My potatoes, carrots, and onions were fresh but I was able to use frozen corn and lima beans from the freezer. I was afraid the fresh veggies would be hard and the frozen would turn to mush but they all turned out just right.  This was my first time cooking a pot pie and it did not disappoint!
