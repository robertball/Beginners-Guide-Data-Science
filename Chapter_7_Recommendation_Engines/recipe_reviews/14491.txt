Excellent recipe with a few changes. Cut the salt in half. Substitute half of the white sugar with brown sugar (how can you have a rub without brown sugar?) and add garlic powder to taste (start with one teaspoon).

THIS WAS SIMPLY FABULOUS! I did however add some personal touches and it was YUMMY! I added a few shakes of Adobo(w/o pepper),1tsp garlic powder,1/2 tsp dill(dry),1/2 tsp curry powder I also ruduced the salt just a tad.I used this rub on a 4 lb chix that I rotissed:) It created a fantastic sticky not too sweet coating that did not burn or melt off. I WILL make again and again!!(hubby and kids loved it!!!!!!!!)Thanks Sarah!!!!

The first time I made as written.  It was way too SALTY.  I think the recipe should read 4 teaspoons salt not 4 tablespoons.  I decreased it to 4 tsp. and it turned out great.  I used it on chicken and it turned out tender and juicy.

This is excellent!  Too salty, but if you cut the salt in half it's great.

I made a beautful ribeye roast for Christmas dinner.  I was looking for a new touch to the flavor.  This rub was just what I was looking for to bring out the flavor of the roast.  My children loved the roast (even my 10 year old who hates everything enjoyed the roast this time)

I cut down the amount of salt to 3 tsp. and used this on cornish hens that I fixed in the rotisserie.  While eating this, my husband said, "What is on this chicken!!?  Do you have any more?"  He loved it, and I did too.  Next I put it on boneless, skinless chicken breasts on the contact grill, but I thought it was too sugary that time.  From now on, I will use less sugar on smaller cuts of meat.

Very good tasting rub! However, a slight variation worked better with pork. I used half the required amount of salt and used sea salt instead of regular salt. I also took one half of a dried pasilla-ancho chile and processed it, added it to the rub. Amazing smokiness, plus a little kick! If you want more kick try different dried chiles.

This was a good starting point, but I changed / added the following:

4 tbs brown sugar ( instead of white)
1 tbs paprika
2 tbs ground mustard
pinch of oregano & thyme
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp cayanne pepper
Salt and Pepper to taste (way too much salt in the original recipie).

Thanks for the great idea :)

This was delicious!  I did take the advise of many reviews to cut the salt, I used 1tbsp. I also cut the sugar because DH is diabetic (diet controlled) so to minimize the sugar I used 1tbsp white sugar and 1tbsp brown sugar (so I used half the sugar and that was still very tasty). We all loved it - I used it on drumsticks that we partially baked then finished on the grill, they came out awesome!!

I cut this recipe in half. I bumped the oregano and thyme up to a half teaspoon and added a half teaspoon of sage. I only used a half teaspoon of salt, as we're watching our salt intake and I used 3 teaspoons of sugar. I used this to sprinkle on pork chops before frying. Husband thought it was great and my littlest who is the pickiest eater on the planet scarfed his helping and asked for more.

The rub was tasty but it made a real mess in the grill and the sugar carmelized and then burnt - adding a unique flavor to some of the meat.

I read the other reviews before I made this and followed the advice in those; I cut back to 3 tablespoons of salt and I cut half the sugar out and replaced it with brown sugar. I also added a half teaspoon of curry powder, as well. I used it for pork chops and it tasted fantastic.

This is the absolute best rub for roasted chicken!  I rub it all over a whole chicken, cut little slits in meatier areas and put it under the skin, and rub it all inside the cavity of the chicken.  Then I bake it in a Stoneware Bundt pan with the cavity of the chicken over the center of the bundt pan.  It's AMAZING!!!

This recipe was very good.  I used have white sugar and half brown.  Also I halved the salt per other's reviews.  I added Lawry's seasoning salt and all I can say is YUM!  It made a ton so I can use it again.  UPDATE: This time I made as is and it was wonderful.  I'm leaving the Lawry's out from now on.

Very good, I only used a tablespoon of salt, four seemed like it would be too much. I added garlic powder and used half white and half brown for the sugar. I also left out the ground mustard, opps. Very good anyway.

Absolutely awful. It was sooo salty. I probably should've saved the sugar and spices and just rolled it in salt. Perhaps lowering the salt in the recipe would make it edible.

--I tried this recipe with a dash of salt, and it was DELICIOUS

Too heavy on the paprika.  Our family of 5 agreed, we didn't *dislike* it, but neither did we particularly like it.

This was our first rub.  We grilled two t-bone steaks using this rub.  It was amazing. It really made the steak taste awesome.  After the rub we grilled the steaks on a fire of charcoal and red oak wood chips.  This was amazing!  The best steaks I have ever had.  The rub is truely what made the steaks amazing.

Excellent rub! I've used it several times on pork chops, and plan on trying it with chicken as well.

I used this on grilled chicken breasts for a friend who is allergic to garlic. (Everything I make has garlic in it!) He said it was delicious. I used more than a "pinch" of oregano and thyme. The sugar carmelized nicely.

Good rub but way too much salt for my taste.  If I make it again I will definitely cut the salt in half.

Even with recommended adjustments, I was not particularly fond of this rub. I cut the recipe in half to use on three boneless pork chops, and further cut the salt, but it was still too much for me. My boyfriend liked it alot, but I probably wouldn't make it again.

I've had better.  It sounded good.  I used it on top-of-the-line pork chops.  It was way too sugary for our tastes, and to me it made the pork chop taste like ham, and I don't like ham.

Recipie turned out really good.  I also felt 4 Tbsp of salt may be too much, so just used 3 tsp and the meat I put it on turned out very good.  (I used beef roast, by the way).

Used this last night on 2 rib eye steaks. Yum! Only used enough to rub into 2 steaks....have enough left for several uses.  Wonder if some reviewers used the whole batch for one recipe? May try using turbinado (raw) sugar next time around.

We cut the amt. of salt down, but it was still too salty for our tastes.  Might try again with some tweaking.

I really liked the flavor of the chicken and how moist it turned out on the bbq. My husband thought it was a bit too salty for his tastes but overall it was a winner!

It was great. I made a half batch 
and it worked for 2 different meals.
 A little goes a long way

Was so good! Used this on chicken drumsticks and took them to the next level! Only hangs I made was cautious the salt in half and added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder. This will definitely be a household staple!

I agree with other reviewers that salt needs to be decreased, and brown sugar instead of white.  With those changes, it made a quite nice rub that did well on the chicken breasts and made a great Mother's Day entree.

Good recipe, but TOO salty. Will cut salt in half next time. I added a little brown sugar for a hint of sweet. Great taste overall.
