Delicious of course.  However, I am wondering about the nutritional information listing that they are over 700 calories per stick.  Can this be true?

This was a big hit with the kids!  Even the adults around our Thanksgiving buffet spread enjoyed the crunch and the stringy cheese filling.  (Best served WARM).  One change I would make next time is to smear a bit of the pasta sauce into the egg roll wrapper before adding the other fillings.  Otherwise, these were great & I will make them again.

My kids loved this recipe.  I thought it was a little greasy. Maybe I'll bake them next time.

I made this for our Christmas party.  Read all the reviews before I made them,  and it went over so well.  We cut them in twos and they were gone so fast.  The only change was I added a sauce to the inside of them before I rolled them and fried.  We loved them.

These are really good.  I just bought mozzarella and cut it up myself.  I spayed them with olive oil and baked for about 12 minutes at 450 F.  I think they would have been better deep fried, but couldn't afford the extra calories.

So delicious! I added Italian seasoning to mine, and sliced black olives. No mushrooms or garlic, I dislike the former and was out of the latter. I too sliced the cheese in half, as a whole stick was a bit too big to wrap nicely. The end result was amazing; the bf devoured them. We dipped ours in arribiatta sauce from Trader Joe's. Yum~!

We loved these.  I brushed the egg roll wrapper with pizza sauce as well to add a bit of flavor.  We will make these again.

This is such a great recipe. I make it with the kids and they just gobble them up!  
I make a few small tweaks by using 2 wrappers for extra crunch and stability and by adding sliced ham, italian seasoning, and a bit of the pizza sauce in each roll. This makes them like mini pizzas and each to hold and dip.  

Definitely make them and enjoy!!

This was good, but not great. I would definately make again because it is a good "kid" snack.
