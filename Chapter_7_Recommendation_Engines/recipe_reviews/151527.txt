I didn't have any cream of celery so I tried cream of mushroom instead. I read the comment about lemon but decided to go a different route and added a good-sized dash of worcester sauce too. Mixed the mustard, soup, w sauce and pepper together in a cup before pouring it all over the chicken and simmering.
It was great!! Whole family loved it, including my two little boys. Easy and fast.

This was really easy and very good.  Nice Dijon flavor and it was very creamy. I will add lemon juice next time but that's it. I only cook for two so I saved the rest of the sauce for next time.

Turned out pretty good.  I did add the worchestershire sauce as suggested by other reviewers, but next time I think Ill double the dijon because the dijon flavor wasn't very strong.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I saw the comments of people adding lemon and/or worcestershire. I also saw that some thought the chicken was a little bland. I added about a half Tbsp of worcestershire and when browning the chicken I sprinkled it with a little seasonings. It was great! Will def make again!

I used chicken broth instead of water, spicy brown mustard instead of dijon.  I seasoned the breasts with Paula Deen's season salt and browned in butter.  There wasn't one drop left in the pan!  My family loved it!!!

I thought this was SO good for a quick and easy Monday night meal.  I sauteed 1/2 a chopped white onion with my cubed chicken and added about a 2 tsp of worcestshire (like others suggested)to the pan to deglaze.  Served with Brown Rice.

Substituted Cream of Chicken Soup; followed other reviewers suggestion to increase the Dijon Mustard - used 2 Tablespoons - could have easily used 3; and added a splash of white wine.  Very good, will definitely make again!

For so few ingredients, I think this is a very good, quickly made dinner.  Dijon mustard is a must and if you like this flavor I think you can add a little more.  I really like this with rice and a green vegetable.  I have served this for guests and they have no clue that I am using a soup can recipe.

Found it kind of bland, actually, and I use a good strong dijon. I modified the leftovers and found it a real improvement.  I melted some cheddar and mixed in an equal amount of dijon, then used this as a topping on the chicken.  The cheese-topped chicken over creamy rice (with the celery dijon sauce) with some asparagus on the side was a tasty treat.

This recipe seemed to be missing something.  Not that the flavor was bad, but I couldn't taste the mustard.  I even added extra mustard.   I followed recipe exactly except adding extra mustard and adding fresh carrots and broccoli.  I let it simmer a little longer to cook the veggies.  Maybe with the addition of some fresh herbs we could call this herbed chicken.

Decent meal for the time you put in.  Per the other reviews I added some worcestershire sauce, and my wife added soy sauce to her portion.

This was ok.  It can definitely be improved upon.  It did not come out creamy at all, it was actually runny.  Next time I will do the following:  Season the chicken breasts, use less water, and more dijon.  We'll see how that goes.  Otherwise, I loved how quick and easy it was.

I altered this recipe since I'm a vegetarian and used the Quorn chicken cutlets. It was a a great meal. I used more mustard than called for, and I would definitely put even more in when I make this again.

Too many good recipes on this site to waste your time on this one.  No one in the house liked it.

My husband loved this recipe. The only difference I made was I added some lemon juice to the chicken. I also served it with buttered rice mixed with chopped green onion. Very good combo. A+!!

This was ok. Didn't hate it but did love it. The sauce was not bad, but the chicken really didn't have any flavor. I think I would try it with chicken thighs. It was very easy to make, but needed a little something. Maybe marinate the breast for flavor.

It's a great base recipe. I browned my seasoned chicken breast in garlic powder season salt and oregano. Then I browned them in butter. In a bowl I mixed cream of mushroom (didn't have cream of celery) wishersire sauce and oregano with a splash of milk. Pour mixture over chicken simmer for 5 minutes. Then I placed the chicken and cream sauce over the rice and topped with asparagus spears.

Not an exciting dish, but a quick and easy dish.  I keep baked chicken breasts in the freezer which turned this into a super quick dish.  Not a dish I would serve to company, but I will make it again.
