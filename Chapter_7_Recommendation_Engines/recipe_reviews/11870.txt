An absolutely delicious way to use leftover turkey or chicken!  I made the Slow Cooker Turkey Breast from this site (wonderful recipe!).  After reading all of the reviews for this tetrazzini, this is what I did, and recommend: use any kind of pasta; increase butter amount to 3 tablespoons, increase onion to Â½ cup, increase garlic to two cloves, use any comibination of cream soups--I used 1 can mushroom and 1 can chicken, add 1 soup can of milk, use any type of shredded cheese or shredded cheese blend.  I actually put 2 cups of the cheese into the casserole.  A deep-sided 13 X 9 baking dish worked perfectly (spray with non-stick coating first).  Here is what I did for the topping:  after baking the foil-covered dish for 30 minutes, I sprinkled the remaining 1 cup of cheese, a handful of grated Parmesan, and some crumbled buttery crackers over the top.  The dish was returned to the oven uncovered for another 10 minutes.  What a delight!

I'm glad I read the reviews first because I did take a few peoples advice before cooking.First off I changed the spagetti to 1 pkg egg noodles,3 Tbls. garlic, 2 Tbls.veg. oil,Monteray Jack instead of American cheese.(Where can you find shredded American cheese anyway?I couldn't).Then I added 1/2 pkg. of mushrooms to the garlic and onions sauteed and 1 1/2 cups of milk.The milk is the trick.It will keep it from drying out when reheating.Enjoy.

Dinner was super yummy.  I exchanged the spaghetti with egg noodles and I sauteed onions, garlic, mushrooms, green pepper and pimentos (in a small amt of chicken broth) I cut out the butter and the oil.  I also went from 3 cups of cheese down to one cup which was plenty.   When I mixed the soup, broth etc-- I did add 1 cup of milk.  We sprinkled the top lightly with parmesan cheese!!  It was very creamy and delicious!! I will definitely make this again!  Thanks so much for a great start!!

I was looking for a different way to use up the leftover Thanksgiving turkey and this was a BIG hit at my house.  Adults & kids all liked it. I found some shredded american & chedder cheese at the grocery.  Either I've never noticed it before or it is a new product.  Either way, it was the perfect consistency for this dish.  We smoked our turkey this year and it did give this casserole a nice flavor.  I followed the recipe with just a few exceptions.  I wanted to make extra casseroles to freeze for later but I didn't just double the recipe.  I used about 18 oz of spaghetti, 6 cups of turkey, and a little more chicken broth, onion, & garlic than what the recipe calls for.  I also threw in some sliced mushrooms.  I was afraid that my kids would be turned off by the red bell pepper on top so I mixed it in the casserole.  Finally, I thought it needed something "crunchy" on top so I sprinkled some bread crumbs on top of the cheese before baking.  Next time I might try Ritz cracker crumbs.  I will be making this one again!  Thanks!

My family loves this recipe.  I substituted cheddar for the American cheese, and then sprinkled a combination of cheddar and parmesan cheese on the top.  Also, I added some green pepper too - makes it more festive for Christmas when you have both red and green pepper.

Easy and tasty recipe.  For best results I'd suggest a low-sodium cream of mushroom soup (or at least one that does not contain MSG).  I also undercooked the pasta (based on the package directions) and added a bit more chicken broth.  The broth gets absorbed by the pasta during the baking phase and the pasta ends up less mushy than if you had cooked it all they way in the boiling water.

I made it with turkey,and bowtie pasta.  For the season salt, I used some cajun seasoning that I had on hand. It was very cheesy and very good!  I will add more turkey next time I make it. I really don't think it matters what kind of cheese you use really, mine was a combo of American, Cheddar and Parmesano Reggiano.  It's a keeper, especially for leftover chicken or turkey!  yum.

Ok, first off. I hate reviewers that love it and totally change it. Thats what I did. lol  No chicken stock, I had plain yogurt in the fridge used that. And I upgraded the cheese...pick yours, all good. My wife cringed her nose when I said" turkey Tetrazzini". Her mom wasn't a good cook. She liked it. Didn't pack it for lunch, but liked it. She always packs her own lunch if it is great. I had to make her a turkey sandwich lol I liked it very much.

My kids, ages 7 & 9, rated this FIVE STARS and went back for seconds both nights we had it. I took the advice of another reviewer and added a can of milk to the 2 cans cream of mushroom soup. Used egg noodles instead of spaghetti. Used 1/2 wheel of quesadilla cheese and mixed in 2 slices of individually-wrapped American cheese. On the second night, I  crumbled six buttery round crackers over the top and baked it covered in foil for 30 mins...just right. This was creamy and delish. The extra milk made the dish a perfect consistency; without it's a little dry. I'll save this in my keeper file! Thanks for the post.

I found this recipe on allrecipes a few years ago, and I have to say it is our #1 favorite meal.  We smoke a turkey and use the leftovers for this dish...our friends love it, too!!!  Don't try to use whole wheat pasta; too dry.

took advice from previous reviewers - added 1 cup milk, used one cream of chicken & one cream of mushroom soup. Added cheddar & parm. cheeses to top and sprinkled with crushed ritz crackers. Also added in some frozen mixed veggies. Very good casserole! Can't imagine it without the extra milk - would not be saucy enough!

Excellent way to use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  I add a can of mushrooms and use a combination of cheddar/american cheese.  Can also use Cream of Chicken soup.  This one's a saver.

Very good recipe, except DON'T ruin it with American cheese.  Cheddar is great, as would be some other choices.  1 can chicken soup, 1 can cream of celery and about a can of mile was an awesome tip.  Thanks, folks!  Will make again and again.

I used some other reviewers suggestions.  I increased the margarine to 3 Tbs, increased the onion to 1/2 cup, increased garlic to 2 cloves, and used mozarralla cheese (2 cups in the casserole; 1 cup on top).  I didn't use any parsley or bell pepper.  I felt that there was too much margarine and too much cheese- it was too creamy.  It felt like it was yucky and bad for me.  I used the 97% fat free soup for 1 can and a regular can for the other (because a reviewer emphatically said to not use the fat free soup because the meal wasn't creamy enough).  If I try it again I would definetly do fat free soup for both and I would decrease the cheese to 2 cups.  I didn't have time but next time I would put mushrooms and peas in the dish.

This was a terrific base recipe that my sweetie used for our dinner last night. The few changes he made was using Pepper Jack and Parm cheeses in lieu of the American, added celery to the mix and garnished with green onion. He put this together while I was at work and was concerned that it was going to be too soupy. I assured him that the angel hair pasta would absorb much of the liquid and the cooking process would take care of the rest. That it did and I can honestly say that this was the BEST tetrazzini I'd ever eaten. I had two helpings last night and even had another bowl for lunch today. I can't get enough of this. Thank you so very much Corwynn!! YUM!!!!!!!!

Way too salty! Added the ritz cracker topping ( maybe that made it too salty) But overall was not good. No one liked it. I think if you add some milk to the recipe it may turn out better.

This is a great recipie.  I made the following changes:  My husband grilled the chicken (yum!), and I used Velveeta cheese for the casserole, and colby cheese to top it with.  I also added a can of sliced mushrooms.  This was a hit at my informal dinner party for four.  Very Good!  Thanks!

This is a perfect way to use left-over Thanksgiving turkey and is different enough not to seem like yesterday's dinner. The whole family loved it. I took the advice of several reviewers including sauteing the red pepper with the onion and including it in the casserole. I also sauteed some mushrooms with them. Pefecto. I used about one cup of cheese in the sauce -- quite adequate -- and one cup for sprinkling on top later. Plenty. I used broth not milk -- good because the spaghetti should be slightly under-cooked after boiling, and will sop up the broth. As another review recommended, I toasted up some panko crumbs and also used the toasted crumbs on top. The only butter I used in the recipe was in the toasted crumbs. I sauteed the veggies in olive oil. The only two cans of cream soup I had on hand was mushroom and asparagus. The combo turned out fabulous. I'll use the same thing next time!

Made this dish because I had left-over turkey from thanksgiving!  Let me say, WOW!  My husband and I really enjoyed this dish... Its a very good dish with I will make again forsure!  I did make a few changes though.  I did not have chicken broth so I took a wing and used beef broth.  It worked well!  I didn't have any red pepper so I used tomato and green pepper with parsley.  Oh ya, I used turkey instead of chicken.  Great recipe! Will definitely make it again! YUM!!

I made this with a leftover honey-baked smoked turkey breast.  I used one can mushroom soup and one can cream of celery soup, and I blended the pepper and onion into tiny bits (so my kids wouldn't know veggies were in it!).  I cooked the onion and pepper together.  I also used fat free cheddar cheese and a couple slices fat free american cheese. And finally I used the Dearfield spaghetti to lower the glycemic index.  It was very moist and creamy, but a little on the salty side.  I probably will cut back on the seasoned salt next time.  Great easy, weekday meal after a holiday turkey.

I made this tonight for company and it was a hit!.  I did add a cup of milk, and about 1/4 cup of sour cream, and wheat pasta.  I think it would have been dry if I didn't add the milk, but with it was perfect!

I followed the basic ideas ideas of this recipe. I wanted to make it more low carb so I used about 4 large chicken breasts and cooked them in oil with the onions and red peppers. Only cooked up 8 oz of noodles to cut back carbs. Did most everything the same - used 1 cup parm, 2 cups mozz cuz that's what I had. Sprinkled some parm and just a small handful of FF onion rings on top. Very good. I would probably use a combo of red and green peppers next time cuz it didn't taste as bell pepper-y as I would have liked. Oh yeah, and I omitted the mushroom. Overall, good basic recipe. My fam liked it.

I found like other reviewers that this was DRY!  I think I probably added approx 1 cup milk, and probably could have added a second.  I added extra garlic, cheddar cheese, herbes de provence and also opted to use a spiral pasta (which may have influenced the amount of liquid needed as well).  I was pleasantly surpised to find that it actually tasted better the next day.  I may try to make ahead and store overnight before baking?

Delicious!  Great way to use up leftover turkey or chicken.  We used cream of chicken soup as we aren't fond of mushroom and substituted cheddar cheese.

This recipe is a variation of so many of these simple pasta recipes except this one was good!
I used more garlic and it was delicious!  It also seemed like I worked really hard to put it otgether so my husband appreciated it even more!  Little does he know.

Delicious! Followed the advice of another reviewer and added 1 more tablespoon of butter, used egg noodles instead of sphaghetti and shredded parmesan cheese. Reviewer also advised using more cheese, consistency and taste was great. It  was very easy to make and the whole family enjoyed.

Made this last night. My husband and son said it was the best pasta dish I have done in years. I did have to make changes though. Added chopped celery and green pepper to the onion for about 1/2 c each. Used 16 oz pasta. Why leave a measley 4 oz. in the box? Used 1 can mushroom and 1 can crm chicken soup. Didn't have much cheese so I think it was only about 1 1/2 c cheese. I'd add another cup next time. I had a a bit of muenster on top. I did leave out salt, except what I used in the pasta water. The soups have plenty. Absolutely fantastic. They said they want that at least every 2 weeks.

We loved this recipe. I did make some changes.  I sauteed 1 onion a pack of mushrooms and a tablespoon crushed garlic in butter, salt and pepper.  Then I added a touch of red wine vinegar.  I like to use heavy cream instead of the soup. The rest of the recipe was the same. I did not put any cheese in the sauce, I sprinkled it on top. It melted while it cooked, then I broiled it for about five minutes to make the cheese crispy. OMG..yummy!!!

EXCELLENT! I made this on a whim. I had ground turkey and needed something simple to prep for the next day to make my life easier. I seasoned the ground turkey with onion sald and garlic salt. I ommited the 1/2tsp of salt. I used the onion salt and garlic salt insted of seasoning salt. It came out perfect, so perfect infact that we dug in as soon as it came out of the oven.

Used a rigatoni pasta, added more garlic and onion and sauteed both in fresh turkey broth. Kept the butter out and it was still a great meal! Will definitely make this again ;)

This was good.  Easy to make, freezes well, and I didn't have to make a special trip to the grocery store for ingredients.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Good for those cold nights you just want to stay home and enjoy comfort food.

I made this recipe 2 weeks ago. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the pasta and left over turkey...didn't have spaghetti on hand so I used elbows...no left over turkey so I cooked a turkey breast just to make this dish. Hubby thought it was delicious. It just didn't knock my socks off though.

I cooked the bellpeppers in with the sauce instead of adding it on the top and added mushrooms and frozen peas.  I also used 4 cups of cheese and added a few dashes of red pepper flakes.  This recipe is splendid!  The next time, I will use a 26 oz can of cream of mushroom soup.  I omitted the fresh parsley because I didn't have any.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Scaled down the recipe for 4 servings.  Added 1T of cooking sherry to the sauce and since I had sliced American cheese singles on hand, I cutup 8 slices, adding ALL of the cheese to the sauce mixture. As others recommended, I topped with bread crumbs and parm. cheese during the last 10 minutes of baking.  Although my family didn't care for it (they aren't all that into casseroles :( ), I thought it was tasty!  Good comfort food!

I almost followed the directions to the T but I scaled it down for 4 servings so I only used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and instead of the shredded cheese I used half a can of Campbells Cheddar Cheese soup and I omitted the red bell pepper and parsley just because I didnt have any on hand. I added some panko bread crumbs and grated parmasean cheese for the last few minutes of cooking. All in all I thought it was a good recipe but mine came out a little dry so next time I wont cook it for so long or I will add a little more soup or chicken broth. My husband LOVED it thoght :)

This is super duper yummo! My partner and I are gluten free, so I had to make some modifications as well.  I used rice spaghetti noodles, a whole onion, three cloves of garlic, gluten free chicken broth, a combination of cheddar/monteray jack and parmesan.  Because most of the cream soups are thickened with wheat flour, I had to use one can of Health Valley Cream of Mushroom soup.  It is not condensed, so the only extra liquid I added was the chicken broth.  This turned out absolutely delightful, I will definately be making this again!

Yummy!  I scaled the recipe to four servings.  I cut two chicken breasts into bite size pieces and sauteed them in olive oil until cooked through then removed them from the pan.  I used the same pan for the onions and garlic and loosened all of the brown bits left from the chicken from the bottom of the pan.  I added a half cup of milk as others suggested, used egg noodles and topped with cheese before baking instead of adding for the last two minutes.  I also used more onion than called for because we love onions!  Sprinkled with some bread crumbs before baking as well.  It was creamy and delish!  I was afraid it would have that canned soup taste, but it didn't.  Pleasant suprise.

Worst tetrazzini I've ever tasted. Way too salty! And bland.  Followed recipe exactly as written.

It was fine for leftover turkey, but I wouldn't make it just because I wanted turkey tetrazzini ... there are probably better recipes out there ... thanks, anyway ... :)

Great recipe - I make it every year w/Thanksgiving or Xmas leftovers, only I always make these adjustments: (1) I use an entire onion (2) I use an entire bell pepper (or sometimes two) -- half w/in the casserole, half sprinkled on top, at the end (3) I add a package of sliced mushrooms and (4) I replace American cheese with a pkg of shredded sharp cheddar (seems healthier this way)

I'd give it four and a half if I could. I used 1 lb ground turkey, can of cream of mushroom w/ roasted garlic, can of cream of broccoli, and a can of milk. The only reason I give it four is because it wasn't as creamy as I thought it would be. But the flavor was great.

Pretty good and very easy to put together.  I halved the recipe and added 1/2 c. of milk to the soup/broth mixture and used mozzarella cheese.  I also sprinkled Parmesean cheese and bread crumbs on top.  Instead of using diced red bell peppers, I added a few pinches of red pepper flakes.

It is a very good recipe.  It was a little salty the first time I made it, the second time I didn't add as much salt and added a little pepper instead.  I guess it's all in taste, I'm not a big salt person.  But overall, good recipe.

Super easy recipe.  I don't know if my sub'ing cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom soup made a difference, but we had no 'lack of flavor' complaints at my house - even my non-casserole picky hubby liked it.  I used canned chicken (like tuna) - one 15 oz can and added a can of peas and carrots and it came out great!

I enjoyed the recipe. I thought there was so much leftover though so I don't know if I used the right amount of noodles. My husband liked it, not loved.I used garlic powder since I didn't have real. I also never heard of or saw shredded american cheese so I used mild chedder instead. And used parmesean cheese on top instead of the parsley. Also didn't use the peppers.

This dish isn't even out of the oven
yet and I'm posting a review. I tried
the sauce before it went in to bake
and man is it awesome. Only changes
I made was to the soup and cheese. I substituted cream of celery for the cream of mushroom.And I ended up
using shredded mozzarella and provolone
cheese blend. The aroma in the house
is so good. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is awesome.  I did add  some mixed vegetables and added a good cup of milk to give it more liquid. I used a can of crm. of chicken along with a can of crm. of mushroom. I also used egg noodles instead.  This recipe is a keeper.  We all loved it.

I was looking for a Turkey Tetrazzini recipe that did not use cream soups, but after reading the reviews I thought I'd try this one anyway... Glad I did! I had to use one can cream of mushroom and one cream of celery, as well as a combination of shredded Havarti and cheddar since it was all I had, and it made a rich, flavourful casserole that the kids ate, hubby loved (and took the leftovers for lunch!) Thanks for sharing it, Corwynn!

This was a fabulous dish for  my leftover Christmas Turkey!  I made the following changes:  I substituted one can of Cream of Mushroom for a can of Condensed Chicken Verde (it's new by Campbell's. It has just a touch of green chiles)  I had to cut the turkey off of the bone early this morning so I could get it out in the trash, but I was worried that it would dry out so I put the 4 cups of diced turkey in a bowl and covered it with a full can of chicken broth and added garlic powder, crushed pepper and Italian seasoning and put it in the fridge until I was ready to assemble.  I used 4 tablespoons of butter to saute the onions and I crushed 2 cloves of cgarlic and added it to the onion.  As I assembled, I used the Classic Melts (America/Cheddar blend) shredded cheese plus a 1/4 Cup of Italian Blend and a few crumbles of Cranberry Stilton (YUM!!!).  I then blended it all with the angel hair pasta, put it in a casserole dish and topped it with more cheese and buttered Italian breadcrumbs.  It was a wonderful dish!

This recipe is sooo good! I used shredded leftover turkey, and my husband and I loved it. Instead of American cheese, I used shredded cheddar and colby jack. I used one clove of garlic, minced, which turned out to be plenty for us. It was perfect! I highly recommend this recipe.

My husbands favorite dish! I use the more exspensive deli cheese's & grate them. Baby Swiss is excellent. "GOOD" cheese
makes a big difference with this recipe. I also add fresh garlic.

very good, however, is there something wrong with my eye's?  In the directions I could swear it says sautee !GARLIC!, where in the ingredients does it call for any amount of garlic?  I used 2 cloves and sauteed fresh button mushroom in butter, before adding it to soup mixture.  I also added 1 1/2 cans of milk to mixture, as suggested from previous comments and used sharp cheddar cheese,  It is a warm comforting dinner.

I didn't change a thing about this recipe and it was DELICIOUS!  I seasoned boneless chicken breast and cooked in a little oil for this recipe. Like others, I didn't know where to find "american" shredded cheese, so I used cheddar, which was so good, but I will also experiment with other cheeses in the future. I had never had tetrazzini before, but my husband was craving this comfort food he had during his growing up years.  I really didn't know what recipe to use, but I must have picked the right one, because he said this one was better than the one he grew up with!  I didn't add any milk, and we had no problems with the dryness that others experienced and it was still moist the next day for leftovers.  Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe but next time we'll use diced onions and some green pepper and add a can of corn or frozen peas.  We also added a can and a half of milk (meaning we used the can from the soup to measure the milk).  It makes a LOT.

I omit the bell pepper simply because my husband does not like them, and he devours this recipe!  Every time a cold, rainy day comes around and I decide to make this the day doesn't seem as bad.  It is a wonderfully rich and filling recipe.  Great comfort food!

This was very good.  I did use jarred pimento instead of the red bell pepper. I used leftover honey-baked turkey which made it a little sweet - my husband liked it that way, but I think it would be even better with leftover "regular" turkey.

I have added this recipe to my rotation. The kids enjoyed ground turkey instead of chicken and 1/2 cup of sour cream is also a nice addition.

Tried this tonight. I added a cup of diced bell peppers, and a bag of broccoli florets to the sauce before mixing with the pasta. It was ok, but we all agreed that it needs more sauce and MUCH more cheese.

I reduced the fat by omitting the oil, used reduced fat and sodium mushroom soup. For the cheese, I used a little chunk of Velvetta in the "body" of the recipe and use a sprinkling on the top at the end of the recipe.  I also put crushed croutons on the top.  YUM... Enjoy!

I made some modifications to save calories:  No oil needed in boiling the noodles.  I omitted the cheddar cheese entirely and substituted about 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese in the sauce and about 1/4 cup on top.  I also used one cream of mushroom and one cream of celery, both low fat.  And I sauteed celery and green onion in butter instead of regular onion and garlic.  I didn't have the red pepper or parsley, but the celery flavor came out nicely.  This is a good recipe probably just as it is, but sometimes you have to work with what's in your pantry!

I thought this was really good and my husband said this is "a definate make again". I followed some of the other reviewers advice and used 1/2 a bar of fat-free cream cheese (I had it left over, fat-free cream of mushroom soup, a dash of red pepper flakes and topped it with parmesan cheese and crushed ritz crackers. The browned topping was delish!!

I liked this dish but, after reading the reviews, thought a little more flavor was called for.  I sauteed 1 medium diced onion, 1 chopped garlic clove and 2 diced celery ribs in the butter and proceeded as instructed.  I also added shredded Parmesean to the top.  Very yummy for the little preparation involved.

We really liked this dish. I used leftover turkey & followed the suggestions of previous reviewers & added ham, sour cream, & parmesan. I only had one can of mushroom soup, so I made a white sauce with cream cheese. I had to put this in a 12X18 pan because it made tons. After we stuffed ourselves, I froze 2 dinner-sized portions. It's a good recipe because you can do so much with it, plus it tasted great!

This is really good with leftover turkey.  I strongly recommend reducing the amount of cheese.  I used 3/4 cup cheddar mixed in with the sauce and 1/2 cup cheddar plus 1/4 cup parmesan for the topping.  I also used 1 can each cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup, increased the onion to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup warm milk to the sauce.  The whole family ate it, including 3 picky kids!

Excellent recipe!  We actually had a little leftover ham AND turkey from Thanksgiving so I threw them both in there with some sour cream and sharp cheddar.  I may make another turkey and ham just so we can have this dish again!

Corwynn I'm fast becoming a fan of your recipes, so I hope you'll forgive me for changing it a little. I used italian seasoning instead of the seasoned salt, added some black pepper and an extra clove of garlic and used mozzarella for the cheese. I also used red and green peppers on the top purely because my garden gave me a bumper crop of green peppers this year. I have no doubts that I will be making this to use up my Christmas turkey this year. Many thanks

Tasty! I changed some, used tuna, angel hair, cream of celery, cheddar, no garlic-(allergic). Sprinkled with red pepper flakes before baking to give a little color and flavor. I only used half of the cheese. I did not bother putting the rest on top. it doesn't need it and I don't need the calories. I also halved the recipe. Very easy and very good. Next time I will add veggies also.

This was one of the many recipes I tried with my leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  It was better than I would've thought, although it seemed like it was missing "something" - don't know quite what.  It did get gobbled up by my family of five - the kids really like it.

Excellent, the whole family loved it.  I used two turkey legs I had got on sale for the meat.  I roasted them early in the day then pulled the meat from the bone and followed the recipe.  I used one can cream of celery and one can cream of broccoli (that's just what happened to be in the pantry and we don't like mushrooms) and Mrs.Dash instead of season salt (I figured there is enough salt in the cheese, butter, broth, and soup.)  Also, egg noodles seemed the thing to use, and I had whole wheat ones on hand.  I used one 8oz package shredded cheddar, half in and half on, and it turned out perfectly.

Not great and Not bad, just OK.  I used one can each of 98% fat free cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup to cut the fat.  I also added mushrooms, broccoli and celery to get some vegetables in this for the kids.  I also cut back on the cheese..the amount mixed in was more than enough - no need for the layer on top.  'Nothing special' sums this up.

Very good.  I sauteed the pepper with the onion and garlic.  I used a Kraft shredded blend of American and cheddar.  I threw in a handful of frozen peas (thawed with the noodle water) in for good measure.  It made a lot - next time I will divide into 2 dishes and freeze one.

The picky eaters in my family really enjoyed this recipe, I did add about 4oz of chopped mushrooms and 1/2 cup chopped celery, sauted with the onion. The only thing I would change next time is add a little less cheese.

I tried this recipe on my family tonight and they loved it, even my picky husband who hates turkey ate it. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I made it with leftover thanksgiving turkey and it was awesome. I took the advice of some people and I sauteed my bell peppers with the onion and two medium cloves of chopped garlic. I also used colby jack instead of american cheese and I added a sprinkling of parmesan to the cheese on top. Oh and my last tweak to this recipe was I used cream of chicken/mushroom soup instead of plain mushroom. Enjoy everyone!

EXCELLENT!!!  I also added in a sm-med sized zucchini which was super yummy!  I didn't have bell pepper on hand so I left that out.  Next time I'll add a bit more onion and garlic (I used one largish clove)--- Oh I also substituted italian blend shredded cheeses and a little mexican blend for the american cheese- btw, I used left over turkey instead of chicken... A 5 Star Recipe for sure- yum yum!

This recipe was great!  I used leftover turkey breast and thin spaghetti.  I didn't see in the ingredients where it said to use garlic, but I chopped up one clove and sauted it with the onion and the red pepper (I used the red pepper in this step instead of at the end).  I used regular salt and I used the Velveta that comes shredded up in the shredded cheese section at the grocery store.  After the 30 minute cooking time I topped it with the leftover cheese and some melted butter and crackers, I omitted the parsley.  This was really good and I will make this again!

This recipe was most excellent.  My wife RAVED about it.  This one will become a regular at our house.  Note: Another review said the recipe did not say if spagetti should be cooked and that the it called for garlic, but did not have in the ingredients.  Right in the recipe, it says to cook the pasta according to the directions on the package.  And as far as the garlic, if you don't know by instinct, get the heck out of the kitchen!

All I can say is Deee-lish!!! Thanks so much for this great recipe- the whole family loved it!! I used 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder stirred in with the onions, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written! Will make again and again- this is most definitely a keeper!

Oh my! Where do I begin? This is soooo... good! I used leftover grilled chicken and co-jack cheese. And I added about 1/2-3/4 c. sour cream. "Mr. Picky" had seconds! I see so many possibilities for this recipe. It will be great for using up leftovers. And I made extra and froze it for a work night when I'm too tired to cook. Atta girl Corwynn...this one's a winner!

Texture was okay.  Too cheesy.  Needs more flavor.  Also, instructions call for garlic, but none listed in ingredient list.  Also, author did not indicate if spaghetti was to be cooked or uncooked.

We liked this.  The only thing I did different was to add about 1 teaspoon of Salt-Free Cavender's Greek seasoning to give it a little more flavor.

This was not a hit in my house.  My husband didn't like it & said it had way too much pasta.  Maybe 1/2 a lb. would have been better than 12 oz. of pasta.  I thought it was bland.  If you like tuna noodle casserole, you'll probably enjoy this recipe.  I did make some changes though.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup & 1 can of cream of chicken soup, used a mixture of shredded cheddar & jack cheese, & added some pimento and sliced fresh mushrooms.  I also topped the dish with some parmesan cheese (instead of more of the shredded cheddar/jack that had been mixed in with the dish) & some slivered almonds.

This turned out great!  I added a little less than a full can of extra milk, but I think I will add more next time to help the dryness when reheating. I was able to find shredded Velveeta at the grocery store and I used grated cheddar on top. I also put the red bell pepper in with the onion at the beginning instead of sprinkling on top and it gave it a great flavor.  Next time I think I will try the french onion topping idea.

I added the pasta slowly to the sauce to avoid "dryness."  I did have some left over pasta.  This dish is good but very rich.  Next time, I will make this with just one can of soup and use non-fat evaporated milk in lieu of the second can.

My family loved this one!  It was quick and easy.  I used some american cheese slices and shredded cheddar in the sauce and added canned french fried onions on top instead of more cheese.  It was delicious. I will make this again.
