Absolutely perfect, my husband fell in love with me all over again!! **UPDATE** I made these last night using Panko bread crumbs (which I pulsed in the food processor to make the crumbs super tiny), will never make any other way...not at all greasy with a fabulous crunch!  FOR NO MESS - I put the flour mix into a big resealable bag, throw all my onion slices in and shake really well until they're all coated. Then take the onions out, add the milk/egg to the bag and stir well. Add the onions a handful at a time, seal bag and mush the bag until all slices are coated, take out with tongs and put on wire rack over foil or wax paper...then put my Panko breadcrumbs into a big tupperware bowl, add the onions a handful at a time (with tongs), put the lid on and shake shake shake.  Put the onions from the bowl directly into the hot oil with clean tongs, woo-hoo no mess!!!

I chose to bake these instead of frying. I did drizzle a bit of olive oil onto the dish so they would get crispy and they turned out wonderful! I also added some tyme, basil and rosemary into the breadcrumbs. Not greasy and a lot of flavor! I also sprinkled with some parmesan/romano cheese hot out of the oven!  Yum! Thanks for the recipe...will be making again!

Delicious! Crispy on the outside and tender inside. I used brown onions. I floured them with an extra seasoning of garlic powder, paprika, battered them and then placed them in a shallow container with lots of crumbs. To save time I just placed the lid on the container and shook vigorously. It coated them in crumbs very well, alot better than using your fingers as all the places the breadcrumbs fall off because of your fingers weren't a problem. I mean I just don't have the time to coat one by one and this method worked great. I put them in the fridge ready for dinner and still have lots left uncooked which I will fry up tomorrow night.

With just a few tweeks this go from good to over the top grrreat.  After slicing onions put into a shallow bowl and cover with buttermilk, let sit for hour in fridge. Add flour to a bowl with 1/4 cup of corn starch(forget the baking powder)this lighten up the gluten. Add  1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/8  tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp garlic powder to flour.  Pour off buttermilk and add if needed to make one cup, set aside.  Dredge onion rings into flour and set on cookie rack, now add buttermilk to flour and 2 tablespoon of instant potatos.  Let mixture sit for 10 mins, the potatos will thicken batter. Dip onion rings in batter and then into Panko bread crumbs not reg, this makes them so incredibly crunchy you won't believe it.  Put onion rings on a cooling rack to dry for at least 10 mins.  Drying keeps the batter/Panko on better when cooked and less greasy.   Deep fry after oil has reached 350 degrees, flipping over after couple mins until golden brown.  Salt right after they come out of oil.  Do not salt batter as it makes the onions sweat and batter will fall off.

These are the best.  I read in a recent cooking publication to slide a skewer through the onion rings and hang them across a bowl to drip.  It works perfectly.  I lay a wire cooling rack across a baking dish and hold the cooked onion rings in a 225F oven, while frying the remaining rings.  This keeps them crispy.  I do not use any of the salt this recipe calls for.

I made these for the guys at the fire hall.  And I made a HUGE pile of them...not one was left!

A very good recipe...a little messy, but it's esay to do and worth it!

Some changes I made:

I found the onion to batter ratio was a little short on batter so I doubled the flour mixture.  It's always easier to throw out extra batter than not have enough.  I also added the following to the batter:  Garlic powder, dried parsley, a pinch of cayenne, black pepper, and some paprika.  Add these according to your taste.

I think you will like the results!

Excellent recipe! The flavor was good, texture was awesome! Thanks for the recipe! The only thing is that I ran out of the crumb stuff so, I would use more of that next time (might have been my super huge Walla Walla sweet onion though!). TIP: For any like me who don't have a fryer - just put oil in a deepish frying pan on medium high heat - preheat oil before frying. It worked perfect!

One of my all time favorite foods, and so much better than the typical battered rings. Breaded onion rings are so hard to find at restaurants now since there are so few old fashioned drive-ins left anymore. I will never have to lust after these again. A little putzy, but SO worth the effort! (Best, in my opinion, with a juicy cheeseburger and a thick chocolate malt!) Thanks for passing along the recipe for this nostalgic favorite of mine.

These onion rings turned out perfect. I used many of the tips that I found in these reviews.  I used a gallon ziploc to shake the onion slices with the flour mixture.   Next, I set wire racks over newspaper to put the rings after coating with the batter.   I used a covered pan for the breadcrumbs and shook the batter coated rings in there before laying them out on a piece of newspaper.   The fastest part was the actual frying - quick and easy in an electric skillet.  Served with the Blooming Onion Sauce from this site, there are a couple..we used the recipe that has mayonnaise as a base, but cut down on the horseradish by 1/2. Perfect companion to these excellent onion rings. Enjoy!  Edit - I made these again and they are still delicious. However, I got a new electric skillet and it didn't seem to get as hot as my old one so the onion rings took longer to cook. Next time I will do them on the stove. These are really excellent onion rings!

These were real yummy.  A good crispy onion ring.  Left overs are excellent re-heated due to the crisp factor.  I did add some garlic powder to the flour mixture and soaked the onions rings in water (this process of soaking takes the strong oniony flavor out of onions if that's what you prefer.  The water coating also helped the flour mixture to adhere better).  The only problem I had with this recipe was that after you coat the onion rings with flour mixture, it doesn't realy specify how much you flour mixture you are left with.  I had to make more flour mixture in order to have enough when adding egg mixture (maybe this was the case due to my decision to soak in water.  Overall these were realy GREAT and I'll def. make it again.  Thanks Jeanharmon:)

not the easiest recipe to make,  but well worth the effort. i made these with sweet vidalias, and they were the best onion rings we've ever had. i used cooling racks to drain the batter from the onions, and i put the racks in the sink. this helped with clean up.

These were AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!  The taste is spot on.  There is one thing that I would change.  In order to get the bread crumb to adhere perfectly, skip the part where you are supposed to allow the batter to drip off on wire racks.  Just give a little shake, shake for a moment and then coat.  Trust me... I did it both ways and there is a HUGE difference.  It is the difference between a perfect onion ring and one with the coating falling half off.  ALSO, it means less dishes!

This is by far the best onion ring recipe I have ever found. I do adjust it sometimes depending on what I am serving. such as adding garlic or italian seasoning to them. but the recipe it's self makes the perfect onion ring. This is also the only thing in my home I do deep fry, I use an olive oil/canola oil blend.
I make these in large batches, and freeze them. They reheat wonderfully in the oven, just as crispy as when they were first made. I reheat them at 375 for I would say 4 min per side (need to watch carefully).
Thank you so much for the recipe, my husband loves them!

Fantastic. Try BUTTERMILK instead of milk. Also baked them in the oven at 350 for 10 min, turned them and kept them in for another 10min.  The Blooming Onion Dipping Sauce from this site is a killer side.

Here's the deal.  I wanted to make these tonight for Father's day BBQ.  So, I get the flour mixture ready, Oil is heating, get my sheet pan ready with rack to drain... etc.  I have NO onions.  Seriously.  First of all, this never happens in my kitchen.  Second, I didn't want to waste ingredients or prep time already involved.  I realized I had an entire pound of fresh button mushrooms.  Wiped them clean, trimmed stems and quartered them.  Followed recipe to a "T" except I knew that the onions themselves would've had a ton more flavor than the mushrooms, so I added 1t onion powder, 1/2t black pepper 1/4t cayenne and 1/2t of garlic powder to the flour mixture.  Then just followed all the steps.  The batter stuck perfectly.  I've never fried mushrooms before, but husband, daughter and myself thought these were amazing!  Can't wait to try with actual onions!  Thank you for a wonderful method where the coating actually sticks to veggie involved!!  Saved this and will use for other "experiments".  Thanks, Jean Marie!!!!

This an excellent recipe.  A little trick is to drain rings on a brown paper bag and keep in low oven until all rings are ready to serve.

I LOVE onion rings but I can only eat sweet onions and most restaurants don't use sweet onions for their onion rings. With this recipe I get delicious restaurant style onion rings made the way I like them! The recipe is a little time consuming but the payoff makes it worth it! DELICIOUS!

Made these using panko crumbs whirled in the food processor till very fine.  Put the coatings in two different bags as others did and clean up was simple.  These were fantastic!

WOW! These are amazing!!  We made them as is and they were excellent!  We also tried them with Panko bread crumbs instead and they were also great but the bread crumbs were a little too big so we ground them up in a food processor and these were the best, better than regular bread crumbs or non ground Panko ones.  We also tried frying them and baking them.  Frying of course tasted the best but baking was a great alternative if you want low fat.  For those, I greased a baking sheet and baked them at 400 degrees for 20 min. They turned out light and crispy. Both the fried and baked onion rings were great left over.  I just put them on a cookie sheet in the oven at 400 degrees until they were heated.  They were just as crispy as the day they were made after being heated that way. To make the onion rings easier, I put the flour mixture in a large zip lock bag and tossed the onion rings around.  I then took them out and added the egg and milk to the flour mixture in the bag, stirred it and then added the onions and mushed them around until coated. I then followed the rest of the directions from there.

Fan-freakin'-tastic! Tripled the recipe for 9 servings.  Used sweet white onions and followed the directions exactly.  My 10 year old daughter did everything but fry them and they were the hit of our cookout!  Great recipe, clear directions, perfect end result.  You should try this one!

By far, the best recipe so far! Why not 5 stars then, Rich?? Because of my technique, which I will tweak a bit. When dredging in the flour/salt/baking powder mixture, give it a good shake or tap, as sometimes flour clings, causing the batter to fall off in a clump. It mentions the "tap" when removing from the breadcrumbs. Also, because this recipe does cause the breading to be rather thick, next time, I'll try double onion slices, as in ring inside of ring, trying to balance the onion:coating ratio a bit.

 I do believe I'll try this method with chicken!

The recipe as it is written is a very good basic recipe.  It's all about knowing what you are doing..... a deep fryer for this type of recipe is always best, but a good deep pot, with the proper oil temperature will work just fine as well!  I personally prefer panko, but done correctly regular bread crumbs work just fine!  I did find the batter to be a bit thick, so kept adding milk until it was smoother.  Draining the batter is essential as too much will, indeed, soak up too much oil and become soggy.  I added some cajun seasoning into the dry flour mixture, and ultimately the batter; just enough to give the rings a nice after bite on the spice but not overwhelm on the flavor.  This recipe calls for only one onion, I use 2 medium sweet onions and had batter left over.  I enjoyed this very much - this is the best onion ring recipe I have found to date!  Get creative and add your own twist if that's what you want - it's what cooking is all about!  Happy eating!!!

I would give this 10 stars if I could!!  OMG it was SOO good!  I do not even really care for onions, but wanted to make them for my husband.  They looked and smelled so good so I stole a couple off his plate, they were fantastic.  Not greasy at all, nice and crispy without being hard.  He has made sure I have the ingredients so I can make them again, I just passed the recipe to my mother as she loves onion rings as well.  The only thing I changed was I didn't use the seasoned salt.  I didn't have a deep fryer so just heated oil in a deep pan, turned the rings over once, worked just as well!

So... 5 stars because the recipe is a good one... I give my sister and myself 3 stars because... well... we had so many user errors it wasn't even funny... okay... it was pretty funny... anyway... they taste great :) ours aren't very pretty, and we foolishly tried to docker the batter because (I just now realized why) it wasn't sticking... tip... don't forget the baking powder... we also had a ton of extra batter so we mixed in some frozen corn and some chopped onion and made corn fritters  :)  All are yummy, dispite the blonde user errors! ;)

I dipped the rings in egg/milk, then in the flour mix, then in the egg/milk again, and finally in panko.  Then fried in a pan of oil on the stove top.  Let dry on paper towels on a cookie rack and sprinkled with a little seasoning salt.  Came out excellent!  Really enjoyed these, will make again for sure!

After looking for a recipe for onion rings on Allrecipes, I realized I had tried this before. It's great. I would give it 6 stars if I could. I followed the recipe 'til I got to the bread crumbs. I substituted potato flakes. Sooo crispy. And they stay crispy. I did the bread crumbs also. I liked both, preferred the potato flakes. Wonderful easy recipe. Thank you Jean Marie.

I tweaked this recipe and made it gluten free and slightly healthier (as fried foods go. I used Panko bread crumbs which fry up so crispy. I also fried these in a skillet on medium heat and used extra virgin olive oil which I think gives it a nice flavor. These go so fast. They are amazing!

Exceptionally light and crispy. Yes, they are a little bit of work, but they're worth it. I definitely will make these again. Tip: Absolutely dredge them in Panko, not ordinary (American) bread crumbs. That's one of the secrets to the light/crispiness.

Fabulous!!!! The batter stuck perfectly and I didnt even have any left floating in my pan!!
Update: used this on shrimp today, fabulous! ! Just add a sprinkle of old bay seasoning and make the batter a little thinner. To coat with bread crumbs I ended up just sprinkling them on. It was VERY messy and I'm sure with some thought I can make it less so but my attitude is; good food is worth the mess!

The best.  Will satisfy any onion ring craving, guaranteed.  Don't bother drip-drying the onions-time waster.

These were excellent! I baked them at 400 degrees on a wire rack, for 20 min flipping once. I also used panko bread crumbs for a crispy texture. The best part of this dish is the seasoning salt at the end. The people who commented that there is not enough flavor probably missed this step. Thanks for a great recipe!

It's really a shame that I found this recipe....It's too good and I'll be tempted to make them way too often.  I only had Italian bread crumbs so that's what I used and they were wonderful.  I don't have a deep fryer so I used a heavy pan and probably got them a little too brown.  We like thicker rings so I kept several of the rings of onions in one "ring".  Love these!!!!

FABULOUSLY DELICIOUS!!!! I have been eating, cooking, and baking for over 75 years, and have never tasted onion rings as good as these.  I followed another reviewers advice and put the rings on a skewer over a bowl to drain.  After frying, I placed them on a paper towel covered plate, and lightly salted them--it took two batches.  My only complaint is that by the time the second batch had finished, I had eaten three or four of the first batch of onion rings--so delicious.  Even after they had cooled, I couldn't stop munching on them.  Thank you Jean Marie for this excellent and delicous recipe.

These were awesome!!! The family LOVED it!  I did do a couple things different though.  I dipped the onion in the egg mixture first, then the flour, back to the egg and then to the bread crumbs.  I made for a better coating that stuck and stayed nicer than the first few following the recipe directions.  I also added a roasted garlic seasoning to the flour mix and a little garlic salt to the bread  crumb mix.

This is very good - I will definitely use again! One part on the instructions though; when you cover in bread crumbs, I would recommend using a mixing bowl and fork to swirl around - it doesn't work very well to use a shallow platter/plate and try to press the crumbs on. Thanks for the recipe!

Have a huge bag of onions I'm slowing working my way through and decided to try to make onions rings for the freezer (will update once we try *frozen* rings tonight).  I did test these, however, and was fairly pleased.  Personally, I guess I'm a batter ring gal, but difficult to freeze those.  For the coating, i thought was *okay* - I did decide after tasting to add to the breadcrumbs and turned it into a 50/50 flour/breadcrumb ratio.  This seemed to give them a little more *umphh* in the coating dept.  Thanks so much for recipe - will enjoy playing with it. UPDATE:  just fried up a batch of *frozen* rings and they were fanTAStic!  We did prefer the ones I had added additional flour to, so keeping at a 4* rating, but for anyone looking to make homemade frozen onion rings, these work great!  UPDATE X2:  Tried baking frozen rings - ehhh.  Not so good.  Deep frying definatly a should do.

This takes much longer than 18 minutes. I have attempted twice and both times have taken nearly an hour with all the steps. Also, without the help of many other spices this is merely a fried onion with a crisp layer.

My husband made an amazing pulled pork for Sunday dinner so I was trying to come up with something to make with it that was new. I have never tried homemade onion rings before this recipe. I decided to go with it because of the amount of reviews (700+) and it was highly rated with 5 stars. 

I have to say, these onion rings are AWESOME! They were super easy to make, and it didn't take much time to make them. I only had some small-ish yellow onions on hand, and they worked fine, although next time I will use a large sweet yellow onion. 

What I liked about these onion rings are they didn't really have a greasy texture/taste, the breading stayed on the onion as I was eating them, and they were crunchy - everything I would expect from a really good onion ring. Although they aren't the healthiest thing to eat, I plan on making these again this weekend because I liked them that much. Enjoy!!!

This is five stars, for a great base. I never tried making onion rings before but this made me want to try it. I also added parsley flakes and garlic powder to my flour mixture and had to double the flour mixture. So you want to double it fronm the start. Thanks so much. This made enough for 2 med onions. I used the yellow ones as I like the strong flavor.My husband said better than restaurant!

I live in a rural part of Korea, and onion rings are nowhere to be found.  These were great, and they look beautiful!  It was a fair amount of work, but soooo yummy.   I was wishing I had some sour cream to make ranch to dip them into, but I found a cajun creamy dressing at the grocers that was decent.  Now I have a lot left over....I'm wonderig how they will freeze?  Gonna give it a go.

Made these first time as stated and thought they needed tweaking. I used Tony's, few dashes of garlic powder and pepper in the flour. I also used half bread crumbs and half panko. They fry beautifully and were super delicious. Have used this on mushrooms and zucchini as well with great results. Thanks!

These are outstanding!!!  Just like the best onion rings you get in restaurants.  For the breadcrumbs, I used a mixture of real bread crumbs (simply rip up some real bread and process in a food processor) mixed with some panko crumbs to give them extra crunch.  I also used a mix of vegetable and peanut oils - I love the flavor peanut oil imparts to fried foods.  EXCELLENT recipe.

These were so good.  We don't like think onion rings real thick so I sliced them pretty thin. But they were so good and crispy. I used the same recipe for fish batter a few nights later and that turned out awesome too.

The bread crumb coating in the last step RUINED these otherwise tasty onion rings.  Plus all the extra work putting them on a wire rack?  Why? I wasted so much time and all for nothing.  I'm not sure why someone would suggest using a bread coating for this,  as fried breadcrumbs taste like nothing but the greasy fat they were fried in.

These were very good, and my mom thought that they were better than restaurant style. My only suggestion is that you don't need to add all of the flour mixture  to the egg mixture. I thought that adding all of the flour mixture made the breading too thick around the onion. I would only add 2/3 of the flour to the mixture. 

With that being said, my husband requested these two days in a row (Saturday and then again Sunday). They go great with sliders and meatball subs.

Maybe it was because of the kind of bread crumbs I used, but we didn't think these were all that great. They were REALLY greasy and not that crunchy. The coating didn't cover all the onion either... Not so great.

I make this all the time, and everyone loves it.  The only variation I make is to use season salt instead of regular in the flour mix.  I also add some season salt to the bread crumbs.  Great recipe!

I made this for dinner last night and though it was fairly labor intensive then end result was well worth it! These onion rings were some of the best I have ever had. My children and husband agree! However,  if this is your first time making these or you don't have all necessary cookware (like me) be prepared for a total prep and cook time of about an hour.

These were amazing!  We only had parmesan flavored bread crumbs, so we used those.  Extremely delicious and the batter held on well and was very crispy.

These onion rings were delicious! I made them for my little brother and he ate almost all of them! Although, after I dipped the onion rings in the batter and let them drip throught the wire rack, there was not much batter left on the onion rings. When I went to coat the onions in the bread crumbs, it did not come out as coated and thick as I had expected. Other than that, they were fabulous!

I made these onion rings exactly as the recipe calls for... absolutely delicious! I did have plenty of flour mixture and bread crumbs leftover, so I simply sliced another onion and repeated the process with the remaining mix. I still have leftover mixture, so I may try breading something else with it :) Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

The only reason I'm giving these a 3 is because of the mess and how tedious it was to make them.  Don't get me wrong, they were delicious and worth the effort, but I won't make them again.  I'll get them at a restaurant because they are just as good, if not better!

Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of doubling for 6 people and using Panko Bread Crumbs. These were better than any Onion Ring I have ever made or purchased anywhere. Honestly, these are perfect in every way...Super Crunchy (Panko)outside, tender inside, perfectly seasoned with Lawry's Season Salt and not greasy at all. All six people were so impressed with this recipe. This is the only way we will make onion rings from this point. Thank you so much for sharing!

SOOOO  GOOD!! There is a reason these have hundreds of  5 star ratings. This is a side dish that will impress your dinner company. They are a bit of work but the FLAVOR and CRUNCH is off the charts. I seasoned the flour mix with a  spice rub that has several ingredients recommended by other cooks and used panko bread crumbs. I had an onion that was close to a pound and I did run out of batter but the rings were so big, three were fine for a serving. My young sons rated them as "way better" than our previously favorite onion ring. Once you make these you'll always be disappointed by what you get from your neighborhood burger place. I only wish they weren't so fattening so they could be made more often.

These were absolutely perfect!  I chose to use a sweet onion but next time I'll go with the yellow, the sweet didn't pack quite enough onion flavor.  Also, for the bread crumbs I used Panko, those breadcrumbs can't be beat when it comes to frying, it's light and crunchy.  I like to dip mine in Ranch dressing.  Yum!

Oh my gosh. I thought I rated these yummy onion rings long ago. This recipe, however messy and time consuming, always turns out one of the best tasting (and textured) rings I've ever had. I added some additional spices, but nothing different than other reviewers here used. LOVE the crunch from these! Mine are fried in a large cast iron skillet starting at 360 degrees. Each batch takes exactly three minutes (turned once) and come out excellent every single time.

Thanks for such a wonderful un-soggy recipe!

AMAZING!! Love these rings!

I only had "Italian-style" bread crumbs in the house but used them anyway and they were great!! First few weren't quite salty enough but remedied that with adding about a teaspoon or so more salt to the breadcrumbs - didn't have to salt them after frying after that.

These were SO crispy and perfect. Thanks to the reviewer who said they battered in the bag and breadcrumbed in the container. Did both and had fantastic results. Also thanks to the skewer over the bowl draining trick!!

good recipe, but make sure you follow the other's recommeations for alot of extra spices along with extra salt and pepper.

And also, fyi, i don't own a deep fryer so i just used a big deep pot with veg oil nice and hot. Dont add too many rings at one time or else the temp of your oil will be brought down too much and the onions will have to fry longer b/c the heat will take more time to get back up to where it should be. 

also, less is more with the batter. shake em off real good before you fry them

Viola!

These were SO easy to do and fun to make.  My only change: The recipe says to slice the onion rings 1/4" thick.  These were too small and were overwhelmed by the batter.  When I make them the next time I will slice the onions at least 3/4" thick so they don't get lost.

awesome! The first time I made them I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand. The onion rings were okay, a bit soggy after 5 minutes. Then I made them again yesterday (with bread crumbs) and they were great! Make sure the batter isn't too thin, otherwise it wouldn't hold well on the onions. Also, I kept them in a 200 C preheated oven to keep them crispy while frying the rest of the onions. next time I'll soak the onions in buttermilk first (for about an hour) before coating them.

YOU HAVE GOT TO MAKE THESE!!! SOOO GOOD!!  I always use Japanese Panko bread crumbs rather than regular,  and these are better than eating out!! I make a "cajun ranch" dipping sauce with ranch dressing, mix in paprika, ground red pepper, garlic powder to taste. sooooo good!

This is the best Onion rings recipe I have ever made and I have tried a lot as husband loves restraunt onion rings.Most recipes batter turns out to be thick coated this one was just like the restraunts.He loved them so did rest of family.It is extra work but it is worth it.I read reviews and placed racks in sink, also sprinkled bread crumbs on rings when they were on racks in the sink, moved them to plate with bread crumbs and coated some more .Then fried them .Used my favorite spices .Thanks for this great recipe!!

Finally, the perfect recipe for breaded, deep-fried foods! I did alter the recipe a bit by adding 1.5 tsp seasoned salt to the flour instead of sprinkling it on afterwards (I didn't add any extra salt), and I used cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs. I dipped the onion pieces into the batter, tapped them off, and coated them in crackers. I also used the breading for zucchini rounds and mahi mahi fish! Everything came out EXCELLENT! We even had left overs, which we kept in the fridge overnight, and then baked in the oven at 450 until they started to singe a bit, and they were almost just as good as when we made them fresh. This recipe ROCKS, thank you!

I cut these in 1/2” slices because I wanted a nice thick onion ring.  Cutting them 1/4” as suggested yields more of a shoestring type onion ring.  They are very easy to make, but you do have to work somewhat quickly. If you let the egg batter drip too long, it dries and you cannot get the breading to stick.  It helps to work in small batches.

these are really good for a party. Very crispy. One amendment which made them even better was to put them into the egg mix, then to crumbs and then egg mix and crumbs again.

I was making pronto pups and onion rings with a deep frier.  This recipe did not work at all, it took forever to cook and just wouldn't work for me.   I ended up using the pronto pup batter to coat the onion rings instead.  Not pleased.

Panko is the way to go on these. Out of this world. After I fried them I kept them warm in the oven on a rack and they were perfect when served. Love these and worth the work.

Use only Panko Crumbs for super light & crispy rings & try Lipton Dry Onion Soup Mix added to your preferred seasonings. Delicious! Also, definitely use an electric skillet if you don't have a deep fryer & instead of boring thinner rings, try them at 1/2" to 3/4" cuts. Lastly, try making some Utah Fry Sauce instead of ketchup for dipping. 1/2 parts mayo to 1/2 parts ketchup. Tweak slightly to taste.

I used Panko as suggested and these turned out amazing, crispy and delicious. I also cut some zucchini into sticks and used the same batter to fry them, and they were tasty.

Excellent flavor!  The batter cooks well and isnt soggy.  I highly recommend Panko crumbs.

This recipe is very good. I didn't have any bread crumbs and I didn't feel like making any so I crushed some french fried onions and used those. When I ran out of that I used coconut shavings (it was a huge onion). Both ways tasted really good, but the coconut was the best. Also if you decide to half the recipe do not use a whole egg. The proportions will be bad and the batter will not stick as well to the onion. I threw in a little flour to counter that problem and it worked out all right.

These onion rings turned out fantastic! I made a large amount for a dinner party and held them in a warm oven for close to 30 minutes and they were still super crispy when we ate! Would defintely make this recipe again.

I wanted to like this, but I felt that the directions as written didn't come out the way I expected. Maybe I misunderstood something, but I read the recipe a million times to make sure, and I cook A LOT, so this is nothing new to me. I felt that the egg and milk dip was too thin and it didn't really look like any kind of coating to me at all, so I dipped back and forth twice. This made a thicker coating, but I was still underwhelmed. I made some the exact way the recipe was written and some with extra dipping. Not sure what I did wrong. I guess I'll keep looking for the right recipe for me.

5-star recipe!  I used panko and the coating was light and crispy.  A little labor intensive but just set everything up assembly line style while your oil is heating and things will go smoothly.

Crunchy and super tasty (I even forgot to put seasoned salt on them, they were just that good!)...a huge downside is how long these take to make. It's not even worth the effort to make more than 3 servings. I was not planning on feeding more than my boyfriend and self, and ended up having 3 more adults and a 5-year-old to feed as well, and it took us an hour to make all these. Dipping each ring 3 times is pretty time consuming! I admit it was worth it for the flavor and exquisite crunch, but I'll never make this for so many people again!

Very easy recipe to prepare.  
I omitted the breadcrumbs and they still turned out great.  
We enjoy them with mustard and a condiment, honey mustard is even better!

My family has attempted numerous recipes for onion rings as well as making some up and have not been satisfied.  This recipe is absolutely perfect!!!! My husband is a fantastic home cook and prides himself on his cooking ability and recipes that he makes up but when I made these he was impressed and told me they were the best onion rings he has ever had! If you knew my husband you'd know this is big!!!

I took one of the reviewers advise and used a 1 gallon ziploc bag to do all the mixing.  I'm all about less mess.  Used cornflake crumbs instead of bread crumbs and Pamela's Baking Flour in place of flour to make recipe gluten free.  Terrific!  No one would ever guess they were gluten free.  So crispy and not greasy at all.

Very tasty! The batter can get a bit thick as it stands, so either thin it out or cook a bit longer so you don't have doughy rings.

Followed the directions exactly, but cut rings 1/2" thick. The batter was more like peanut butter and did not "drain" well, resulting in 50/50 batter/onion taste. I prefer 2/3 batter/onion. Next time I make this I will add 1/4 cup milk to thin the batter out. Maybe some accessory seasoning as well to give a kick, like cayenne pepper.

These were very delicious. But I must admit I didn`t like the idea of coating in bread crumbs so much, so the next portion I dipped in flour. Very cheap and easy to make, thanks.

I loved this the batter/breading was the perfect amount.  I did as others suggested and used two bowls with lids to reduce the mess.  I used a mix of panko and italian bread crumbs.  Delish...better deep fried than baked though...I sprinkled with salt after they were cooked.

These were delicious. Most onion rings that I have made in the past did not stay crispy, but these sure did. These are a keeper. Loved them:)

The Best!!!!  Crunchy, Crispy. I used Panko instead of regular crumbs and they came out great.  Also season with creole seasoning. Very good

These are the best onion rings I've EVER eaten. Make only with sweet white or yellow onions! We tried both red and white and red doesn't work. My husband made these and if I make them again I'm going to "double dip" them in the batter before frying because the batter is so good.

These smelled wonderful frying up. They tasted okay but were better with ketchup. However, these were pretty soggy after a while. Eat these fast.

Pretty good!  I made it with panko crumbs instead of traditional bread crumbs.  The only thing I would change otherwise is to add more salt to the flour mixture.

Best onion rings I've ever had!!  I used Panko instead of bread crumbs.  Turned out nice and crispy.  I would suggest keeping the cooked ones in a warm until you have them all cooked.

These were so good!  I used Italian style breadcrumbs because that's all that I had.  Great side dish or snack.  They don't re-heat well, so eat them right away.

I wouldn't say this was anywhere near fast food onion rings, but they were still good. Very crunchy.
Made a HUGE mess though, and not sure the effort was worth the result.

I made these with Panko as a reviewer suggested.. Wow!  I ran the Panko through the chopper to make the crumbs smaller... Amazingly good.

I made these and my whole family LOVED it! For seasoning, I added a bit of paprika and garlic powder into the batter. I mixed the sliced onion into a bowl for quick covering, and into the breadcrumbs in a big Ziploc... The Ziploc didn't do a great job as the rings were rubbing together. So next time, I will put the bread crumbs into a dish. REALLY LOVED IT!!!

crunchy , golden and just delish!
to save time do like the first review states .;shake rings with ingredients in a Ziploc bag . accept the bread crumbs step . i dipped rings individually coz first time i shaked it all together . they were not coated well ,and so it  didnt form perfect crispy links . 
i say skip the wire rack step . it really doesn't do any difference at all just takes space and time ! 
i did the second time and saved 15 minutes !

Excellent!!! craving onion rings and these were just right. The only difference i will make in the future is to add some seasoning to the batter as it seemed a little bland to me. Probably some garlic powder and onion powder.

This recipe is the bomb!  It's pretty easy to make too.  I used panko bread crumbs which added a wonderful crunch.  I also used popcorn salt which the batter "holds onto" much better so you don't need much.  

One tip:  stir the batter about 1/2 way through coating the onion rings.  I worked in batches and I found that the latter batches seemed to lose their batter/breading.  When I discarded the batter I noticed that it was thicker on the bottom which led me to believe that the flour was settling to the bottomof the bowl.  

These reheat pretty well if you put them in the oven on a baking stone (a cookie sheet will likely work as well).  Enjoy!

As per the pics some peoples' turned out to have a thicker batter ...that's what happened to mine.  Since I've never made this I didn't know if this was normal or not.  I loved the thickness but there was NO flavour in this mix.  I realized this after the first batch and added garlic salt which helped...I found myself hand placing the thick dough to ensure I would still taste the onion underneath.  I cut the onion nice and thick which suits this dough.  Next time I'll maybe make it a beer batter to add some taste and I find sprinkling with sea salt when they come out of the fryer helps!

These onion rings turned out great! I used a large pot and a thermometer to monitor canola oil temp. Nice and crunchy. My only complaint is that 1/4 inch is too thin, so next time we'll be cutting these much closer to 3/4 - 1 inch thick.

I made these the other night and it was soooo good. I also added much more seasonings. I added garlic powder, black pepper, paprika and seasoning salt to the flour mixture. To make it simpler, I put all the onion in a ziploc bag with the flour, put them back on my chopping bag. After I added the flour to the batter, I just dropped a few hand fulls of onion at a time in the batter then in the breadcrumbs. Oh...and I also used half panko. It was delicious!

Perfect! I cut the rings too thin the first time, so you should make sure yours are the recommended 1/4 inch. They have a crunchy thick coating, if that's the kind of onion ring you like, these are for you.

I read some of the reviews that said the coating fell off and the rings were soggy. I think if you make sure the oil is hot enough before you put the rings in, then that should take care of it.

Absolutely amazing. I didn't have bread crumbs in the house, so I rolled regular salted crackers with a rolling pin in a ziplock bag until they were as fine as flour. Everyone loved them.

This was my 1st time making onion rings.  I don't own a deep fryer so I had to use a cast iron skillet to fry them and it turned out great!  I added seasoning to the batter to add flavor.  It was a hit with the kids. Will make them again!

This recipe was terrible! I read all the reviews & thought this was the one to use. The crumbs would not stick to the onions & once I placed them in the oil, the crumbs that did stick just fell off, so all I was left with was soggy fried onions!

Incredible -- probably the best I have ever eaten anywhere!  I did add 1/2 Tbsp of Paprika and 1 tsp of Garlic Pepper to the flour mix.  I used a rectangular glass baking dish with a plastic lid to toss the onion pieces in flour, then mixed the milk/egg mixture into the same dish for dredging.  I laid a cooling rack across one end of the baking dish so the batter dripping off the onion rings would fall right back into the baking dish -- saved a lot of mess.

These are fabulous onion rings - just like the       A & W Drive-thru! A great idea for dipping sauce is 1/4 cup mayo, 1 Tbsp. prepared mustard, 1 Tbsp. Honey, and 1/2 Tbsp. of Lemon juice. Mix well - serve dipping sauce cold or room temperature. Goes great with the rings!

Labor intensive, but worth it. I made these for two World cup football/soccer matches and I could hardly concentrate on the games because I was so into these rings. They are really good!  Only change I made was instead of 1 tsp salt I added 1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt.

Very good, not at all mushy or soggy. Onion was perfectly cooked and the outside was crispy.  I sprinkled garlic powder in the coating, and used italian bread crumbs. I also followed advice of others and put the bread crumbs in a resealable plastic bad and added the drained onions in.  Easy and very little clean up.

The picture looks like it's covered in coconut, don't let that fool you!These were delicious the first time (when hubby helped) and the second time when I made them myself. I didn't let them drip dry but they turned out just as good and crunchy. Better than the local pizza shop's onion rings. Not as good as onion straws. I recommend adding red cajun pepper for a little kick, and horseradish dip!

Everyone in my family loved it! I baked instead of fried, I set the oven for 400 F and put them on a baking pan and drizzled EVOO on them. After 10 minutes I flipped them. They took about 20 minutes (total) until they were just perfect! I also didn't have any all-purpose flour and I used whole wheat flour instead (I dont think it made any difference!). My sister's kids ate them right up, and even my picky eater of a dad loved it ( I put sea salt on his rather then seasoned salt). Will note it is quite time consuming as it is a whole process, but well worth it in the end.

THIS IS A WONDERFUL BASIC RECIPE. I TWEAKED IT BY SOAKING THE ONIONS IN MILK OVERNIGHT IN A ZIP LOCK BAG. THE ACID IN THE MILK HELPS TO TENDERIZE THE ONIONS. I TWEAKED THIS RECIPE MORE BY ELIMINATING THE BREAD CRUMBS, THIS LEAVES YOU WITH A BATTERED ONION RING. IF YOU USE THE MILK FROM THE ZIP LOCK BAG TO MAKE THE BATTER, THE FLAVOR OF THE ONION GOES ALL THROUGH THE MIXTURE.  TENDER AND FLAVORFUL ONION RINGS ARE THE RESULT

Fantastic! I made both onion rings and fried zucchini with this recipe. We really loved these. I used the tip from another reviewer and used plastic bags to do the coatings. I used Italian Seasoned bread crumbs. As I fried, I put them onto a rack in a 225 oven to drain and keep warm as I continued the batch. Came out just awesome! I used the sauce recipe from "Blooming Onion and Dipping Sauce" on this site. Delish!

Very very good! I shook a closed container to cover the onions with the flour mix. I also used panko bread crumbs. Very crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I used vidalia onions for this recipe. I made these with the 'Actually Delicious Turkey Burger' I found on this website. An awesome combination!

OMG--so good!!!  Reminded me somewhat of Sonic onion rings.  I was impressed by this recipe because I don't have much luck with deep frying things.  It is usually a huge mess and the coating doesn't stick, etc.  These were amazing!!

You are my hero!  The first onion rings ever to keep the batter on while frying.  Used sweet onions from Trader Joe's and these were to die for.  Used Italian bread crumbs cause that's what I had and added no other seasoning.  Will try Panko next time.  Also used the same flour/batter method for some crimini mushrooms and that was equally fantastic!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  UPDATE:  Made these tonight and breaded some frozen green beans, slightly thawed, with the same method, and they are great!

Awesome recipe.  I did add onion powder, garlic powder, savoury, black pepper and salt to the bread crumbs.  The idea of placing foil under the rack made it great for clean up.  It wasn't as messy as other onion ring recipes.  I used container for the flour mix and the bread crumbs to coat the rings as suggested by others.  It saved lots of time.  I will def be making these again!

Anyone who lives in Canada will know which drive thru you are talking about after trying these.  All I can say is I have tried a ton of copy-cat recipes and they are always close but not quite.  This isn't a copy cat recipe, this is the real thing!  So yummy and you have saved me lots of money.

These were the best onion rings ever. 
My sister and I made these and we (of course) made several modifications.
First, we used 1/2 rice flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour. The rice flour makes the crust much crunchier.
Instead of regular bread crumbs, we used the crumbs you use to make fish/shrimp fry.
Also, we didn't have a rack to let the onions drip the batter. We just put all the onions in the batter at once and take them out individually and bread them. We immediately fry them after that. Doing this gave the onion rings a wonderful taste and crunch.

I followed the recipe; EXCEPT I double dipped.  First time I made it I used skim milk, but dipped in flour *mixed with seasoned salt* then in milk again before dipping in bread crumbs and seasoned salt mixture.  The second time I made it I used half and half and an egg.  Still double dipped for this glorious thick outer coating.  No special ideas on how to make it neater-it's really messy.  But my hubby said, "These are the best darn onion rings I've ever had".  He admitted he wasn't a big fan of onion rings til I made these.  I used sweet yellow onions-which didn't make me cry.  
Pain in the butt to make-would be better made ahead of time-suggest thicker cream/milk; and double dip!
Thanks!

These take a lot of time to make and are messy but if you don't over cook them they are WONDERFUL!!! I prefer not to buy onion rings from fast food joints now.  I have also found that this recipe is ABSOLUTLY PERFECT for chicken strips.  Follow recipe as you would for the onion rings but you don't have to let the batter drip just dip in wet mixture and then bread and throw into a 335 degree fryer.  Cooking time really depends on size of chicken though.  Either way this is a recipe I will be using from now on!! THANKS

I thought these onion rings were very bland.  I even added some chili powder, paprika and garlic salt to the batter.  I won't be trying these again.

This makes great onion rings-- and just fyi, these turn out fantastic if you bake them instead of fry them! Seriously, they're a great way to enjoy onion rings w/o all that nasty grease!

I baked these instead of frying and they were awesome. I baked them for 25 minutes or so at 400 degrees on a baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray.  I also sprayed the onion rings and drizzled them with a little olive oil.  I used half bread crumbs and half panko.. and I needed about twice the amount that recipe called for. 
Served them with a honey mustard dipping sauce and they were devoured!

WOW!  These are awesome!  Thank you for sharing!  I added a touch of cayenne to the batter for a little kick.  I made these once again and added a 1/2 tsp of pepper to the batter. I also used the batter to fry up some shrimp.  YUM!

Fantastic! I made my own bread crumbs and then seasoned them with garlic powder, oregano, basil and thyme. (I was making the St. Louis Toasted Raviloi's as well). These were wonderful! Thanks! Will use this recipe from now on!

Can you say awesome?! My husband and I were eating them right off the paper towel. I just used regular salt to season as I don't use seasoning salt. Crunchy and nice golden colour on the outside and soft onion on the inside, we will be using this recipe again, thanks Jean!

A beautiful and tasty recipe. I used a pre-made mix of breadcrumbs with herbs and garlic. Very yummy. It is handy to make them ahead of time and keep them in the fridge, ready to be deep fried when dinner is nearly ready. They taste best when eaten straight away. I used enough oil to cover the bottom of a fry pan to cook the onions, turning when brown. They only took a minute and tasted delicious. This recipe is a tich fiddly, but is fantastic.

This is it!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I can finally stuff myself with awsome yummy onion rings at home.  I have tried for years to make onion rings at home and they always were a mess.  I made these according to the recipe except I used 1-1/4C. panko bread crumbs and they were to die for!  I would say I used 2 medium onions and still had batter and crumbs left in the bowl.  YUMMMMMY

The best recipe for homemade onion rings I have found yet! I much prefer a breaded onion ring as opposed to a battered one and the doubled coating worked great. These weren't greasy at all. A little more work but overall excellent!

I made this with a few adjustments.  I actually added several sprinkles of seasoned salt to the batter.  I think that made it perfectly seasoned.  I also put all of the onion into the batter (after dredging it with the flour) and then lifted the pieces out with a fork and put them into a bowl with the crumbs and tossed them to coat.  It would have taken forever if I had done them individually and made for more dishes. We both loved it that way as having a little extra batter on that left us with lots of thicker bits of crispy batter after frying it...it tasted great!

The best ever. I made them ahead and froze them on a cookie sheet c. I could then take out as many as I wanted and cooked them in my fryer, so I always had some on hand.

Oh what light through yonder window breaks?  It is my happy self after eating these perfect onion rings!!  And i've never tried to make onion rings before.  Are they messy to make?  Yup...and you should expect that with ANY fried food.  Are they worth five stars after 950+ reviews?  Yup!  I did the breading in three bowls for this...the dry, the wet, and Panko crumbs so I can sorta do this assembly-line fashion.  My wet batter was about as thick as heavy pancake syrup, because I just like a lot of breading on my rings.  To season the wet and dry breading parts, i threw in some pepper, some paprika, some onion flakes to both, and some freeze-dried garlic pieces to the wet part.  I used a 5qt cast iron dutch oven with about an inch of peanut oil to fry these.  It worked great although it was annoying regulating the stove temperature, but that's just how glassceramic stoves work as opposed to other kids of stove and not this recipe.  Don't fry any more than two or three pieces or the temp doesn't regulate well.  And just make these.  Really, GO and make them.  They are fabulous even without dipping sauce to go with them.  Make them, eat them, love them, make them again and again!

Throughout the years I've attempted to make onion rings at home, both with store purchased mix as well as from scratch mixtures.  This one blew me away!!  I couldn't have found a better recipe!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, aside from using the panko crumbs I had on hand, as well as 3tbs of regular seasoned bread crumbs.  Yes, it's a messy recipe to make (although the tips about the cooking rack were awesome!), it's completely worth it.  They looked fantastic before they went in the oil and they looked even better when they came out.  Not only was the onion cooked inside, but the outside was PERFECT!  Crispy, light and the flavor was spot on!  One of my daughters is fairly picky about onion rings and even she enjoyed them.  I will always, ALWAYS use this recipe!  I wish I could have given it ten stars!!

This recipe is the best recipe ever .... It is amazing ! I mean like it's crispy and I'm writing this in are family meal book !! It was a bit messy but it was worth it ! At first I didn't think it would come out great but I was proved REALLY WRONG ! But you need to let it drip all the batter and wait and then dip them in the bed crumbs or else they would make the bread crumbs join together ! But yea add some spices in the batter if you like it spicy and u have to play with it yourself like thickness and how wet it is the more flour you add but this recipe I will always make ! But if you don't let the batter go all down and dip it it also makes really good crispy onion rings !! THIS IS WORTH EVERY MINUTE !!

This was an outstanding recipe! I made it with BBQ chicken and potato salad. Everyone loved it! It did taste like the onion rings you get at restaurants!! I followed the recipe exact but I did choose to use Panko instead of plain bread crumbs. Coating was crunchy and onions were soft and delicious! This was my first time ever attempting to make homemade onion rings and now this is the ONLY recipe I will use!!! 10 Stars!! You will be so glad you chose this recipe, I promise! :)

This is a great recipe. I cut up 1 1/2 onions and still could have covered 1 more onion with this amount of ingredients. I added a 1/2 t cornstarch, and smoked paprika for flavor.  My hubby loved these so much! I used Panko breadcrumbs of course, why would anyone use any other kind. They give the best crunch on everything. Thanks to "Christina B" Jan 16, 2008 for her suggestion of using a plastic bag. WOW. No mess is correct. I will always use your method Christina...so easy. Delicious folks ! Give this recipe a try.

Look no further if you want onion rings that are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I used Italian Style Panko Bread Crumbs which proved to be a great choice. Using this batter on fresh striped bass made for an excellent fried piece of fish as well. Five Stars.

Absolutely fabulous, my boyfriend tries to hover and eat them as they come out of the pan!! I use brown onions, and I add about 1-2 tbs garlic powder and 1 tbs black pepper to the flour mix for extra flavor. I fry mine in about 1/2 inch EVOO in a pan on the stovetop and flip when the bottoms turn golden. Love christina b's suggestion for using resealable bags and lidded bowl with tongs, made making them and cleaning up so much easier! I also used Panko but did not make them smaller. Also I recommend starting with 3/4 cup milk instead of the full cup, its too runny.

I have also used this batter recipe on red bell pepper strips and fried them, and in place of beer batter mixes when I fry cod and catfish. Plan on trying this with okra soon too!

Perfect, these truly are the best onion rings around. The batter is thick, but does not come out oily. I was so impressed with this recipe, i used the batter to make deep fried zucchini as well as jalapeno poppers. This is now my go to recipe for all things battered and deep fried.

I baked these - I think they would have been better deep fried!  I guess if you are doing onion rings - go all the way!  They are not supposed to be healthy!  Will try again - but, only when I want junk food!

I never tried onion rings before. I really liked this recipe. I didn't have regular bread crumbs, so I used the Italian seasoned kind. It was still yummy and tasty.

I would give it five stars, but I had to modify the original recipe as follows: I used bags instead of bowls as someone suggested, and added garlic powder and parsley to the liquid batter.  In addition, instead of bread crumbs, I used panko crumbs, which resulted in a wonderful crunchy onion ring.  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe.

These were superb!  Turned out crispy and crunchy just like when we go out to places like TGI's.  We struggled to keep some for dinner as my husband and I kept eating the rings as they came out.

Some of the best onion rings I have ever tasted.  My wife and I were both blown away since this is the first homemade onion rings I've ever cooked.  I normally dip in ketchup, but these rings didn't need anything extra.  Went strictly by recipe.

These onion rings were great! Last night I made them to go with bugers. My family loved them and my friend who was over asked for the recipe. Since I didn't have any bread crumbs I used cracker crumbs instead. I trippled the recipe. There was nothing left. Thanks for the wonerful recipe!

These onion rings were better than restaurant quality- they stayed crispy even when cooled (as pulled out of the fryer put on a rack over a cookie sheet in a 300 degree oven to keep warm until they were all done).  We are a family of 5 and we tripled the recipe and had just a few left over, everyone raved about them.  I don't even usually like onion rings and I couldn't quit eating!  Made exactly as recipe written although had to double the panko amount.  It was a fun family activity, everybody chipped in and helped!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were fantastic.  So light and crispy!  I used all the same ingredients, but threw mine in a container with bread crumbs just 6 rings at a time and shook them around, the put them right into the oil.  I needed the oil at 350, otherwise they were a little too dark in about 30 seconds!  But they still tasted good.

I agree with others, they are better than any restaraunt. My family loved them, including my 2,4, and very picky 7 yr old. They are a bit of work, but worth it. I will make them often from now on.

I thought my husband was going to trip all over himself- he LOVED these (I wasn't to far behind). Although they are a little time consuming, they are SO way worth it. Awesome and so tasty!

Perfect onion rings - just what I was craving! I doubled the recipe and used christina b's method with the resealable bag and tongs, and I added the seasonings that REDKNIGHTPREZ recommended in the earlier reviews. They were delicious and appreciated all around.

I love these.  My husband loves these.  If you like onion rings you must try these.  Use the panko bread crumbs, add some garlic salt to the flour.  
You will love.  I made them yesterday for the first time and I'm gonna make them again tonight.

Made these for my husband the other night and he loved them. Even my 8 year old loved them and he is a rather picky eater and will only eat certain things ( onions are not one of those things) I will be making these again.

Wow.  We were eating these as fast as I could fry them!  I did as other reviewers suggested and mixed the flour in a zipper bag then added the egg/milk to that, then the onions and squished them around to coat.  I let each one drip off briefly on the way into the breadcrumb, which I put in a container.  Shook the whole works gently and then put them right into the hot oil.  I don't have a deep fryer but a sturdy pot with a candy thermometer did the trick (I used canola oil).  These were out-of-control good.

These things are awesome!!!  I only had seasoned bread crumbs, so I used those, and omitted the seasoned salt.  We had to make a whole nother batch cuz we ate the first ones as soon as they came out the oil.  They are awesome.

These were great. Next time I am going to add a little corn meal to the bread crumbs. I also used half panko. I want to try this recipe and technique with zucchini and mushrooms.

These are a little bit of a pain to prepare, but they are SOOO worth it. Fantastic. My family eats whatever's set in front of them (total non-foodies), so my cooking skills are wasted on them. This is the only thing I've ever made that really got their attention. They ask me to make them constantly. Coming from them, that's a true compliment. Once you have these, you'll never want frozen onion rings again.

These were great the only thing I changed (based on other reviews) was to use panko breading (which i always prefer over bread crumbs) and i think next time i would put seasoning salt directly into the batter to give a little more seasoning. but they were SO GOOD!

Absolutely amazing!!  This was my first time making onion rings and my husband and I both agree that these were by far the best onion rings we've ever had - better than any restaurant.  I used 1/2 c panko and 1/4 c  whole grain breadcrumbs, and fried them in canola oil.  They were light, crispy, delicious, and not greasy at all.  I had no problems with the breading - it stuck perfectly.  I added a touch of garlic powder and salt to the breadcrumbs otherwise followed it exactly. Will be making these again and again!

I made these for a superbowl party, not so great this  required alot of steps and was very messy, not worth all the effort. I made them exactly as recipe says. it did have amazing crunch but flavor and texture was not for me. For now on, I will always make the beer battered recipe also  from this site which calls for two whipped egg whites  mixed into the batter, makes the finished product light and airy and so yummy! I won't make this again.

only suggestion is to add more seasoning, batter slightly bland. Otherwise, perfection...Mmm (I used panko crumbs in lieu of bread crumbs)

AMAZING.  The only change I make is to add some cayenne to the flour mixture for a little kick, but they are also delicious as written.  My husband gets really excited when I tell him I am going to make these with dinner!

This is an amazing recipe and is every bit as good as the onion rings I have had at any park.  The only comment I have is that the nutritional calculations are inaccurate.  I was worried about this recipe being too carbohydrate heavy based on the nutritional levels provided but you will use very little of the batter in making the onion rings.

These are the best! We have tried other recipes but this is the one we will use from now on. I did use Panko crumbs in place of the bread crumbs.

These were really good. I used panko bread crumbs and these onion rings were very crispy and light. They didn't seem very greasy like most other onion rings I have tried. Besides being a little bland, overall my family and I did like them. Next time I will probably add some cayenne and paprika to the batter.

These where great even after I altered the ingredients to make it allergy friendly. I used Namaste brand gluten free biscuits mix and used egg relpacer. I also soured the milk with vinegar. And fried in canola oil. They turn out as good as any restaurant onion ring that is made with wheat.

The perfect recipe. I used vidalia onions, since they are the best onions and they're in season, but they might not be the best for this recipe. Vidalias are too sweet for onion rings in my opinion. Simple yellow would've been better. I also used a tsp of black pepper.

I am having a good chuckle writing this review. As per the recipe I bought a large (Spanish) onion (size of a soft ball) for this recipe (Vadalias not in season yet). Prep time was more than 15 mins. and cook time is 3 mins. PER BATCH!! I had about 6 servings but they were THE BEST onion rings ever! I used self rising flour and omitted the baking powder. Whenever I have something that needs to be tossed and/or coated I use a large pot with high sides, keeps everything inside and no cleaning up the counter or table.  I put the flour in the pot and tossed onions (took a few batches tho).  Added the milk and egg, tossed again.  While the onions were draining, washed and dried same pot and used for bread crumbs. These are best served with a main course that doesn't need a lot of watching. Will definitely be making again, thinking of using a flavored cracker crumb.

I used to own one of these drive-in concepts only much more recently in a freestanding building.  Our batter came in a bag though and mixed it up with water.  This was very labour intense and I sold upwards of 1000 orders a week. These are very close to the recipe and they are excellent, its too bad you cannot buy the onions already pre-cut and just have to pop out the middles as we did at the restaurant. Thanks for submitting.

OH man, what a mess is made to make these wonderfully delicious onion rings.  Because of the mess I don't make them very often, but they are a huge treat when I do.  My fiance LOVES them, as do I.

My daughter made these for dinner last night and WOW is all I can say.  They were light, crisp and delicious.  Not heavy and grease laden like some onion ring recipes we have tried.  Soft on the inside and crispy crunchy on the outside.  These are a close second to Sonic  Drive In Restaurant's onion rings, if you have ever eaten there.  So delicious.  These were even good cold, still held their crunch and non greasy to boot.  Thank you a million times for the yummy recipe Jean Marie.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I followed another reviewer's advice to use Tupperware to toss and coat the rings in the flour, batter, and the bread crumbs so there is less mess. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe. I made this for my boyfriend and his roomates and it was a HIT! They said they were the best onion rings, ever. Also, since my boyfriend is severely allergic to dairy, I used ricemilk instead of the cow milk and it worked great. These were the FIRST onion rings he had ever had since most restaurants use diary in their recipies ...again, I cannot thank you enough!

I just made these tonight, and decided to try baking them instead of frying.  They really turned  out great.  I did put some seasoned salt and paprika into the flour mixture, and I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, just because I had some that needed to be used up.  It didn't drip off the onions at all, so that was a benefit to using it.  I just put the o-rings on a plate after dunking into the milk mixture, and then did the bread crumbs. I poured about 1/2 cup of oil onto a large baking sheet and baked them at 400 for about 20 minutes, turning halfway through. They were crispy and I didn't have the mess of frying.  Yum!

These onion rings are AWESOME!!If I could give them a 10* rating, I would!! They taste even better than Burger King's onion rings ( in Australia, the same franchise is called Hungry Jack )cos we can actually taste the real onion flavor. I used PANKO breadcrumbs( blend finer with a food processor 1st ) becos it has a nicer golden color n more crunchy than if using normal dry breadcrumbs. For lesser mess during preparation and also faster preparation - I followed this really good tip from a previous reviewer ie dip the floured ( I did add some garlic powder/ paprika/ dr parsley into the flour mixture for better flavor )onion rings into the egg/ milk batter and then placed them onto a layer of panko breadcrumbs in a large rectangle tupperware box. Put the lid on the tupperware box and shake gently sideways so tht onion rings are evenly coated. Set aside on wire rack ( not too long though or else the onion rings wont be so crunchy after u fry them )or for best results - immediately fry the crumbed onion rings. Its easier and faster to do this if u can get help from ur teenaged daughter! I did!! :) U can keep the earlier batches crispy n warm while u fry more by putting in a very slow oven ie 160-200F. My kids n I were greedy - we ended up making too much!! So we kept the left overs in the fridge n heated it up in oven next day. Taste almost as good as day its made but still crispy n yummy!

These were really good!  I used the NW's amazing Walla-Walla Sweets and a combo of Panko and bread crumbs (needed more than the recipe called for and had to combine the two since I didn't have enough of each).  I will spice them up for my tastes (more salt, pepper...maybe some seasoning salt...will have to play with it)next time, but otherwise this is a keeper.

These were really good. I see why they tell you to put crumbs in plate. I tried to expedite things and do the shake-in-a-bag, and ended up with a lot of stuck-together crumbs at the end, but the rings that did get crumbs were terrific. Also, I baked them at 350 and flipped after 10 minutes and then left in another 15 minutes or so. My husband LOVED them. I will try the Panko next time. :)

I made these last night with our brats-on-the-grill... and they were AWESOME! I used the baggie trick... first flouring them in the bag, I then put them on a plate and added the milk/egg to the flour and smooshed it up.  I put all of the rings into the batter while I put a mix of panko and bread crumbs into the second bag (didn't have enough panko) then took the rings out of the batter, breaded them and into the deep fryer.  My only advice is to use only PART of the breading mix at the beginning because it got soggy before I was done with all the rings and I had to add more bread crumbs.  So, if you hold some back, that problem will be solved.  Also, since we like ONION flavor, I added about a tsp of toasted onion powder to the original flour mix, along with some Johnny's seasoning salt.  They were WONDERFUL... flavorful, crisp and onion-y!  This will be my go-to recipe for onion rings from now on!

My husband loved these! He said they are the best he's tasted...I think the breadcrumbs make the recipe! We used italian style breadcrumbs, they were delicious, and the kids loved them too! I ended up having to make a second batch.

Holey Moley!!! I have never tasted a better onion ring! I used the panko bread crumbs like others suggested and it really gave the rings a great crunch. 100% better then any onion ring at any restraunt.

great recipe!  I didn't have a rack to let the batter drip off of onions but I just used the side of my bowl to bang the batter off a bit.  Well, it still turned out great.  Will make again.

These are delicious and so fun to make! I like messy cooking once in a while. I worked at the fast food restaurant that makes these for 5 years, and this recipe is a perfect copy. Love them with a little extra seasoning salt. Mmmmmm!

These onion rings tasted great, but were very time consuming.  The three-step proccess combined with the quick frying made it impossible for me to keep up.  Even though I loved the end result, I will keep searching for an easier recipe.

OHMIGOSH ... these are delicious. They stay crunchy (not greasy) even after they cool off.  The only thing I changed was, I added some Cajun seasoning to the bread crumbs, because I'm from Louisiana, and that's what we do !  Try these, you will love them !

Be forewarned...if you make this your family most likely will put up a stink if you ever try to by frozen onion rings!!! These were absolutely amazing. I couldn't believe how good they were. My family loves onion rings and I've always settled for the frozen kind that I bake in the oven. You can't even compare it to the taste of these. I followed the recipe exactly, using only the suggestion to use the ziploc bags for coating. I will most definitely be making these again. Next time I'll try to take a picture...this time we just couldn't wait to attack the plate :)

Delicious, these taste just like restaurant onion rings.  Very easy when you use ziplock bags for flouring, coating and crumbing.  I used stuffing mix crushed up. Yum!

Thanks for the recipe! :)

I Made a big batch for my kids and they gobbled the onion rings up as fast as I could make them. I also added a pinch of pepper and seasoning salt to the batter and used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain. 

Next time I am going to try to bake them.

Update: I did bake them and they were good but so much better fried!!

It didn't work for me to dip the raw onion rings into the batter and fry them because the onions were raw and the breaded part was getting burnt. So I tried dipping all the onion rings in first just to get it slightly cooked and then dipped it again in the batter. This worked much better for me.

I used a mixture of panko bread crumbs and plain bread crumbs. I also spread them out on a plate and coated the rings there. I didn't try the bag option suggested by the other reviews.

Well, what more can I add to all those "5 star ratings"? These were primo, and I even messed them up (was too tired and not paying attention) even though I knew what the recipe said, I forgot to dust them first and then dip. However. Didn't matter all that much. I used a big fat Vadalia Onion, and man were they sweet ! Hubby said "there's no wild onion taste to these at all". We had them with steak on the grill and a couple of Coors lites. Hmmmmmm, mama. THANKS for the recipe.

Delicious! Do be sure to keep the oil temp up to about 375 so the rings don't soak up extra oil. I used panko crumbs for the bread crumbs. I ran out before I was finished with the batch so used cornmeal. Definitely not as good as the panko, but it was an acceptable substitute. Used the wet batter on mushrooms, too, with excellent results.

The changes I made: used whole wheat flour, seasoned whole wheat breadcrumbs, skim milk, no baking powder, and baked with Pam Cooking spray.  I baked for 30 minutes on 400 and the coating is crispy.  Awesome.  will make again.  Thank you.

The absolute best tasting onion rings ever!  Definitely worth the extra time to dip them more than one time.  Fried up beautifully, and delicious!!

This recipe is the best!  I have never made onion rings that didn't come out soggy.  I followed the recipe exactly except that my deep fryer was broken so used a fry pan - still totally awesome.  I've made them 3 times in 2 weeks - a keeper for sure!

These Onion Rings were absolutely one of the greatest recipes I've found recently!!! I spiced up the Bread Crumbs w/ Original Mrs. Dash and some Garlic and Herb Mrs. Dash and it was absolutely wonderful!!! I will definitely be making them again!

I made these exactly as the recipe stated and they turned out PERFECT!!!  We all loved them and my husband said he could eat them every day!  I will make these again, and again, and again...:)
***UPDATE: I was getting ready to make these tonight and realized I had no bread crumbs. I crushed Ritz crackers and used them instead.  The onion rings turned out crispier and tasted really great.  I think we may use the crackers from now on!

These were good, but we prefer a wet batter when we fry up our onion rings.  Nothing wrong with this recipe, we just didn't like the breadcrumb batter as much.  Thanks for the post.

Pretty  good if i say myself. Secret is to have a pan so you don't have to put the onion rings on top of each other. The combination of a battered onion ring with bread crumb crust was just right. These are as good as i have tried in any resteraunt. I did replace the milk with buttermilk. Some things to mix it up would maybe use beer or instead of bread crumbs use panko bread crumbs (i might try this next time).

I made this with bbq ribs last night and boy was it a hit. I used a mandolin to slice the onion.  I used a cooling rack set over a cookie sheet to put the rings on after dipping.  Easy clean up.

Worth to make. Crispy. Good point on using (optional) garlic powder and/or other ingredients to this. This is a keeper in my recipe box.

This recipe was great.  I used a giant red onion which I sliced with my meat slicer for good even cuts.  I had to make a double batch (6 servings), due to the size of the onion.  The cooking time that worked for me was about 2 1/2 Min.

These are the BEST I've ever tasted!  Per another reviewer, I made the dipping sauce from the Blooming Onion recipe to go with these, and it was incredible!  Note - I double the recipe, since I have a large family, and it was almost too much.  I used large, sweet vidalia onions.  Next time I will not double the recipe.

These were great! Crispy and crunchy. I added a little seasoned salt to the batter and next time I think I'll add a bit more. I made these in the afternoon and kept refrigerated until I was ready to fry them for dinner with our burgers. Came out great.

I served these to a couple of young men who were visiting our home. They couldn't keep their hands off of them! Long after one of them was finished with his meal, he kept munching these onion rings. I served it with some Vidalia brand Blossom Sauce for dipping. I got it at my local Walmart Supercenter. Awesome!

I made these tonight while my husband was making some cheeseburgers for supper.  Boy were these good.  I did not have time to lay them out on a wire rack and let the excess drip off.  I just shook them a little bit and then rolled them in the bread crumbs and fried them.  These are really good:)  Thanks for sharing your recipe:)

These onion rings were very good. They are very time consuming. However, they're a great family project for a Friday night at home. I sliced my onions very thin because that's the way I like them. Next time (and there WILL be a next time) I won't bother to keep the onions in perfect rings because I think they will be easier to handle.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

These were pretty good! The coating was really crispy but a little bit bland - I should have added more s&p, and maybe some garlic powder. They were incredibly messy to make, but the results were worth it. Thanks! (Yet again it should be pointed out that the calorific value given for this recipe includes the entire quart of oil used for frying. It's not as if you drink the oil... *rolls eyes*)

These were really crisp and tasty!  I actually didn't read the recipe carefully and later realized I made them a little different than it said. After coating with flour, I dipped the onions into the milk/egg mixture (no flour), then I coated them with bread crumbs. Next time I may try them as written but I'm not sure that I will like them as much!  My whole family loved them.

Usually I just buy the box of "mix" 
I searched through the recipes to find an easy one. This was GREAT.
SIDE NOTE- people that post comments with their tweeks and "this is how *I* do it" should just shut up and post their own self proclaimed amazing recipe... so 30 people can jump on and say how they did it better.
If you already know how to make the dish, then WHY are you searching for a recipe, except to throw in your "I did blah blah, and then blah blah and blah blah" comments.

Ok so, this is not a complicated recipe. Follow the directions exactly and you will have beautiful golden brown rings. The only thing I did differently was using Panko bread crumbs. Using Panko will ensure your rings have the same look and are the same texture as the rings pictured. These rings cook fast. You have to watch them. I also turn mine once. They only take about a minute or two to fully cook. The people I served them to were blown away. They told me they were the best onion rings they had ever eaten.

I used ground up panko instead of breadcrumbs. Delicious! Next time I will cut them wider to accommodate the very crunchy coating but a huge hit with the whole family. Thank you for my new go to recipe!

Perfect! The key here is to make sure your milk batter is thick like thick pancake batter, you don't want the batter to slide off while waiting for bread crumb coating. They were a slam dunk hit.

We loved this recipe and thought our onion rings were better than restaurant recipes.

Rather than mix the flour mixture in a bowl, I used a gallon-sized ziplock, which worked great. 

I didn't have season salt but I added some salt and Italian herbs to the bread crumbs.

I also pan fried them as I don't have a deep fryer, and they turned out perfectly. Served with horseradish sauce--- perfect!

Since becoming Gluten Free over a year ago I have been craving crispy onion rings. So happy I found this recipe. These were crunchy and tasty, just like the famous fast food restaurant. ;) I used gluten free flour, GF panko style and regular GF bread crumbs. Delish!! Even the reheated ones were crispy and tasty.

I made these with water instead of milk as my 5yr old and hubby are lactose intolerant. they turned out great and were pretty simple to make also. I barely got any as my kids kept coming in as I was cooking them for lunch and gobbling them up :)

I will definitely make these again, but next time I want the batter a little bit thicker and with more seasoning.  It was good but lacked flavour, something that should be easily remedied.

Great recipe!  Super crispy and tasty onion rings.   I add a little cayenne pepper and garlic to the wet mixture before dredging the onions, and I  use a mixture of panko and saltine crumbs.   Also, after breading I put the rings on a plate and into the freezer for about 5-10 minutes to help the breading to set.    I do this with anything I bread and it reallly makes a difference in how much comes off/stays on when frying.
I've made this twice, and the first time I think I made the wet mixture too thin and it didn't cling very well.   Second time I made it to the consistency of thick pancake batter and it clung to the rings very well and then the bread crumbs adhered perfectly.

Sorry, I didn't like the batter.  I'm not sure if it's because the only milk I had on hand was condensed, and only because of that I'm considering trying the recipe again, also it wasn't very flavorful so I'll try adding some seasoning to the flour mixture, otherwise it was easy to make. I'll re-rate later if it comes out better next time.

This review will undoubtedly be redundant with the plethora of other positive reviews; however, I made these tonight and they were divine!!  It took a little bit to get the flavoring/salt ratio set to give them flavor; I ended up putting some garlic salt in with the bread crumbs (I used panko) that I pulsed in the food processor.  That gave them something a little extra that I thought tasted pretty good.   The whole process was a little messy even though I used ziploc bags to do the coating.  That worked well for the flour, but I would probably use a bowl to do the dredging through the batter.  The bag just seemed a little too much of a mess, but yes, cleanup was easy that way.  Anyway, this recipe is a keeper!  It's a little time consuming but so worth it!

The onion rings were the best I ever made. It got real messy though. I might try these with out the bread crumbs because it just didn't seam that they needed it. The batter stuck really nice to the onion.

Oh my god, these are to die for. I made these exactly as-is and I could eat these all day, everyday. I made them with panko breadcrumbs. Although it took a bit longer to prep than I thought it would, I will still definitely be making them again....and again...

These were super, however we followed another reviewers suggestion and used Panko as our final crumb coating. Also, I decreased the salt to only 1 tsp, added 1/4 cup sugar to the egg mixture, and 1/2 tsp vanilla (similar to an old drive-in restaurant)and as modified, we will make these from here on out. Thanks for a great recipe!

I give it four stars not five stars because the first batch I made was a little bland. For the second batch, I sprinkled the raw onion rings with onion powder, garlic powder and salt. I then followed the recipe exactly from there. For a quick and easy dipping sauce, I mixed equal parts ketchup and mayo; perfect! Between my husband and my kids there wasn't a ring left. I used two ziploc bags to coat the rings so clean up was fast and easy.

Great basic recipe, Used panko in the food processor, seasoned with Cayenne pepper, Salt,smoked paprika .
After slicing onions I soaked them in milk for a few hrs.(Could go overnight) Helps everything stick to the onion.
4.5 stars b4 changes, 5 star after 
Happy Eats :)

these were amazing! my family loved it! i usually make desserts, so this was the first time making an appetizer. and it turned out just great! instead of coating each onion one by one, i dumped all of them in ziploc bag and shook 'em. then i added the egg and milk, stirred, then added few onions at a time and mushed the coating over them. i didnt do the whole wire rack thing, and they still turned out fine. and for the breadcrumbs, i put them in a plastic container with the onions and shook. and voila! wonderful onion rings. thank you so much for the recipie! will definitely make again.

My rings didn't come out fully coated after the frying, I think it was due to the dipping in the breadcrumbs. BUT they were still good the taste of the batter was great. Next time I will dip w/Out the breadcrumbs to see how they come out. All in all fantastic for my first try at this recipe.

Wonderful recipe. I added some garlic powder to the flour mix. I also used Panco instead of bread crumbs, I really think this made them ridiculously crunchy and yummy:) Everyone loved them

These were GREAT!! Due to lack of money to buy all ingredients as is, I had to make a few alterations, but I do believe I'm sticking to them! I used Gold Medal "better for bread" flour instead of all-purpose, I used evaporated milk instead of regular (whick comes in handy  for french toast  and other recipes when I'm out of milk, and it"s alot cheaper),  instead  of eggs  I used about 4 tbs. Helmans mayonnaise with olive oil,  and I used Italian bread crumbs instead of regular. I also added about  3/4 tsp. garlic powder to the flour mix.  I usually use the pancake batter  recipe  for onion rings, but these are so much crispier and less greasy.  I made these for me and my son when he got out of work, and we both agree that this ones a keeper!!  THANKS TO THE SUBMITTER!!!!!

Delicious Recipe!!! Exactly like what I used to get at the drive thru!! The batter is amazing, it stays crunchy and doesnt make the onions soggy.  The flavour was spot on, especially with the final sprinkle of salt at the end.  There is no need to look for other batter recipes, this is all you need! I just added a bit more flour to the wet ingredients to make it a bit thicker, but just the same, this recipe is Fantastic.

The batter had a weird ... stiff consistency that threw these onion rings off. Maybe two eggs are too many? Flavor was good but the batter was off.

Made this recipe!  LOVED how they turned out!  The only change I made was that I used equal parts of plain breadcrumbs and panko. The panko gave them a wonderful crunch. Great recipe!

Loved this recipe the first time I tried it! I have even used it for fried chicken multiple times (add spices like cajun or smoked paprika to the batter and bread crumbs), it is amazing!! It's the only way I cook onion rings and fried chicken now.

This was really tasty and restaurant quality. I used the reviewers tip to pulse panko crumbs in a processor for final dipping. I also added in some garlic powder an hungarian paprika to the batter. I also had extra buttermilk on hand so I used that and they fried up perfectly and ultra yummy. Thank You

Perfecto! This was my first time making onion rings and I couldn't have asked for a better recipe. I used a sweet wallawalla onion and panko crumbs. Next time I might add a bit of chili flake to spice them up, but as is you can't go wrong with this recipe.

We made these for dinner tonight and thought they were just ok. I used panko in place of the bread crumbs and although my husband liked the, the batter is rather thin and I prefer a thicker batter.

Totally 100% restaurant style, and very easy to follow directions with no second guessing. It worked great on the first try!!! I don't have a deep fryer, so I heated the oil in a pot in the stove at medium-high, and turned it down to medium when I added the onion rings. I also sprinkled some dried chives on them right after laying them out on a paper towel to drain.

These were delicious.  My 7 year old said these were by far the best onion rings he's ever had.  Everyone had a second serving.  I would usually not give something this messy to make any more than 4 stars (I am very mess averse), but these were worth the mess.  I did not use any of the season salt at the end.  They were great without it.

Can't believe I haven't reviewed these before.  They are amazing!!!!  Just sub in 1 cup beer for the one cup milk and you have the best of both worlds, beer battered rings with crispy coating.  Serve with Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing (recipe on this site).  To blue cheese dressing I add 2 TBSP minced onion, 1 TBSP minced garlic, 1 TBSP lemon juice, and 1 TBSP white wine vinegar.  Delicious!  Worth buying a deep fryer just to make these.

These are really good, crispy and tasty.  My husband likes them better than store-bought or restaurant onion rings!

MMM delicious!! We loved this recipe!! The only thing we did different was to use buttermilk (you can buy or make at home which we did - lots of recipes online for it!) - I found it made the batter stick better to the rings. Definatley worth a try!!!

I don't usually review if I make changes, but without this recipe I could not have done my own tweaking and made what I think is the seriously the ultimate onion ring - and I am an onion ring SNOB for sure :o)  My changes were:  cut the flour to 3/4 cup, add 3/4 cup yellow corn meal - then proceed as original recipe states.  But, after coating all of the rings in the batter, then coat them again.  For the bread crumbs, I used Panko (plain).  Deep fry a few at a time, but only for about a minute (turn if necessary to cook evenly).  I thank JeanieMomof2 for the original recipe (which is also delicious as she wrote it) - without your recipe I wouldn't have had a recipe to start with!

Yummy! we used 3 small onions instead (as that is what we have). Also, we used Panko bread crumbs instead but the 3/4 cups weren't enough and that was all we had, so we toasted some bread and crushed them up into crumbs. After that was finished, we still have some batter and rings left and we just dipped them in batter and fried them. 3 different kinds of onion rings with 1 recipe! My favourite was the one dipped in Panko Bread but my husband's favourite was the one dipped in batter only. We both loved them all though! Thank you for a great recipe!

I loved these, I did however make my own changes: instead of bread crumbs I used panko. In the batter I added seasoned salt and onion powder. To spice things up a bit use a little cayenne pepper. I have had to make these several times now because they are becoming popular among my friends and family.

This recipe is amazing.  These are among the best onion rings I have ever had!  And they really restored my confidence after utterly failing with a different onion ring recipe.  My one (minor) complaint: I ended up with waaaay more batter than I needed.

I'll give it 4 stars for the ease of
direction and the nice crispiness
of the rings.  I did find the coating
a touch bland and a little thick.
Any suggestions on how to 'flavor-up'
The batter?

These were wonderful. Coating stayed on during cooking. Easy to bite through, didn't pull the whole onion out which would drive me crazy. Def. tasted like its name.

YUM! My husband is the one who asked for onion rings and he said they were the best he ever had. I tweaked it some having only Italian spiced bread crumbs, plus I added a little cayenne and black pepper to the flour mixture (but not much).
I sure did make a big mess but it was worth it.

When all the onions were done I took the leftover dry flour droppings, the leftover breadcrumbs, the leftover batter both in the bowl and from the foil and mixed it all together with a little water. Since the oil was still hot I dropped in four big globs of batter. I fried them until nicely browned. I made doggie dumplings treats for our 2 big dogs, but these would probably have been delicious for us as well, but with all those onion rings, corn on the cob and grilled ribs we had plenty for us.
Thanks for this wonderful recipe that I will use whenever I make rings. I might experiment with some other spice arrangements like a spicy breadcrumb, etc. But the basic recipe really rocks!

turned out real good. however my batter was a lil thick and i got a thick coat on my rings. so the onions were kinda lost in the rings. next time i would keep it thin enough to have onions more. 5 star recipe.

Very easy to make and the BEST rings I've ever had.  It was my first time making them too.  I doubled the recipe and used italian bread crumbs and it was fine.  I never buy the plain ones.  But anyway, great recipe!! TRY IT!!

these were DELICIOUS! i added sugar (as needed) in the wet batter & about 3.5 tablespoons of powered sugar in the breadcrumbs, &let me tell you, it was the PERFECT touch! 
i didnt measure the ingred. at ALL so I  may have scarificed some of the crunchiness but it was worth it! super easy, super delicious, DEF making again!
(oh & i also used toothpicks to "skewer" the onions. makings breading 1000X easier!)
hope this helps!

I made these tonight to go with our grilled steaks.  Thank you Jean Marie!! The are fantastic!!  I took the advice of some others and added cayenne pepper to the flour and used panko crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs.  They are some of the best onion rings I have ever eaten.

Double coat them and they will be perfect!  I used a combo of Panko and Seasoned Bread Crumbs.  Yummy!!! Oh yes, let me also add that they hold up well to freezing.

These onion rings were so good.  Yes, they are a little time consuming but I think the 3 step process is what makes them so crispy and good. I did not have bread crumbs so I used Penko crumbs....very crispy.  We also added a litle garlic salt and Creole Seasoning for added flavor.

Utterly perfect. Crispy, light, simple flavour. I am gluten intolerant, so this was made with rice flour and gluten free home made bread crumbs. There is a reason this recipe has a great rating. Try it out, and spice it up if like different flavours.

I made this recipe this evening with one substitution - instead of bread crumbs I used crushed cornflakes.  I use the cornflakes instead of bread crumbs often, especially good on prok chops, and they went great on these onion rings.  Thanks for the flour and batter instructions.  Excellent

These were so good. My husband loves onion rings and he loved these! He said they were better than most restaurant's. They were also so easy to make. I followed it exactly except I didn't have much time to have them lay out on the wire rack (which I just laid them out on a wax paper because I don't have a wire rack).

OMG these are the best!  only a few changes In the batter I put some chipolte powder and corn starch for a bit more crunch!  I cut the onions very very thin and made hay stacks.  They cook extremely fast so have everything ready before start frying.  thanks for the recipe.

Awesome! I am currently eating these and they are delish and satisfying my craving for onion rings. They taste just like any restaurant quality ones and this is the first time I'm making onion rings in general.   I have saved this and will continue to use it. Only thing I did differently was add cayenne pepper to the batter, didn't let them drain on a rack (too many things to dirty), I just dipped them in the batter and shook off the excess then shook them around in a bag of breadcrumbs. Way less waiting and less dirty dishes that way.

These onion rings were very good. I used both white and red onions, making about half of the batch sweet. Still looking for a good dip for this, but otherwise they were very good!

I made these tonight and they were delicious!  I never made onion rings before and they turned out great, so great that my husband asked me to make another batch.  I used panko bread crumbs, and I also used the "Blooming Onion and Dipping Sauce" which is also on this site.  Great sauce.

OMG!!! My husband loves onion rings, if they are done right, and he LOVED these for sure!!!  I do NOT like them, but these are AWESOME!  I followed the recipe as written, but added a couple dashes of seasoned salt and cayenne pepper to the batter, and then seasoned salt to the bread crumbs.  Will DEFINITELY make these again!!!!! Oh, I used Vidalia onions, since we are partial to them in the deep south...

These tasted great, but mine didnt look so hot.  Next time, I am going make the slices thicker and not cook them as long. I used Vidalia onions and panko bread crumbs and they were very crunchy. I used the plastic bag/tupperware bowl method and it wasnt messy at all. Very good--although next time I will doctor up the flour mixture with seasonings and spices as other reviewers suggested. It needs it.

These are the best onion rings I've ever eaten! The batter is so yummy and doesn't fall off the oinion like most onion rings do.  It is time consuming but worth it! I added a tsp of cayenne pepper to the flour mix.  Next time I think I will try to make these a few hours ahead and put them in the fridge until I'm ready to fry them.

The picture looks like breaded not battered.  Would love that recipe.  The batter from this make a wonderful funnel cake with just a bit of buttermilk.

I don't know how you could screw these up unless you didn't add the baking powder and salt to your flour.  These came out exactly like the photo.  I didn't use Panko crumbs, but that is a good idea to try.  I used waxed paper under the wire racks instead of foil.  If some of the batter dripped off the ring, I just dipped the tiny exposed portion back in the batter and then in the crumbs.  They were really crisp and crunchy.  Next time I will dip half the rings and then put those in the crumbs and then do the other half.  Might also add 1/2 tsp chipotle chili powder to the flour mixture for the first dip into the flour.  Great recipe.

Easy to make. I put onions in brown bag and tossed them in the flour to make it easier then put in egg mixture and bread crumbs. The bread crumbs make them very crispy. Great recipe

These were terrific! Yes, a little time consuming, but not difficult to manage. I submitted buttermilk for reg milk b/c I had that on hand & wanted to use up- I used WW flour and added garlic, paprika & extra pepper to the flour mixture for a little more zing. I also used panko bread crumbs that I chopped further in a processor, added about 1/4 C of regular Italian bread crumbs to that as well. Coated rings in flour mixture in sealed bag & since I was only making for 2 people, I was able to hand dip each ring into the batter mixture & let drip on cooling racks. I had to fry daddy, so I just heated oil in large deep sided pot on oven. These came out great, nothing like a chain restaurant- these were tasty! I even made the bloomin onion dip from this site. will make again when I need some down home comfort food!

This was a great recipe.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs with romano cheese and they were delish.  The plastic bag method of flouring and drenching was awesome!  Didn't even use rings, but was able to use up some Vidalia onion halves I found in the fridge.  Yummmmm!

FCS/HOme Ec. Teacher in Illinois.  Again made recipe in foods class and the kids loved the onion rings.  Smelled up the entire school and we had many others students and teachers coming in to taste and received raving reviews.  Gave web address and recipe to many people.

I have always been afraid to make onion rings, because they just looked too difficult.  I was wrong.  This recipe is so easy and so delicious.  My family loved them.  They are crunchy on outside, soft on inside and great flavor.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I love onion rings but don't normally make them at home. That has changed now that I've found this recipe! I didn't have quite enough regular bread crumbs so I added some panko. These are crispy and not at all heavy. I didn't think they were that hard to make either.

These were great!  Thanks for the recipe.  I used panko crumbs for extra crunch and I would highly recommend to anyone.  I crushed them a little bit more so they were similar to the consistency of regular bread crumbs.  I also made them in a continuous process in batches of 6 rings.  After coating them all with flour, I dipped batches in the batter and then straight into the panko, shook a little, and then right into the frier.  Turned out perfect!

Excellent! Followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved the onion rings. The process is laborious and because I love onion rings I made too many. Spent a lot of time making onion rings that we never ate. As the reviewer before me wrote, "Makes many more onion rings than expected"! Will make again.....and soon, but next time will not use as many onions.

Very, very good! Prep is time-consuming, though I'd imagine having two people would speed it up significantly! I used italian bread crumbs. With them, you don't even need seasoning salt. Definitely some of the best onion rings I've ever had! (Also: One onion makes many more rings than I expected.)

i like onion ring, but i think it's more crunchy if you use no egg, just with water... also add pepper for the taste and eat with a dip lemon mayonnaise...

These were very good.  The only change I made was use panko crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs.  They were very crispy, and not greasy at all.  After making them I thought the batter could use some spices like garlic powder and paprika and cayenne just to give it a little more flavor.  Then I read some reviews and someone else suggested the same thing.  I haven't tried it yet but think that would do the trick.

Delicious! Took me a few tries to get the right oil temperature, but once I figured it out it was easy.

I was making hamburgers for dinner and I asked my husband what he wanted to go with them and he said onion rings.  I said ok let me see if I can find a good recipe to make them.  I found this recipe and made it exactly as stated.  These are delicious.  I have never tried making onion rings before.  I will be making these often.  My husband thought they were the best he has ever had.  There are some left over and I am going to heat them up for lunch tomorrow just to see if they stay crispy like others have said.  Thanks so much for this recipe.   I didn't find it all that time consuming or messy to make.  I put the flour and milk mixture in a flat bottomed bowl and it made it very easy to dip the onions using tongs.  I used a shallow container for the bread crumbs and found it easier to just shake it side to side to coat instead of using the lid and shaking.  It might have been my container too.

This is a good recipe if you like "fluffy" onion rings. I was hoping for a crispier, thinner breading, but I guess the egg (both the yolk and white) makes it thick and fluffy.  If you like tasting the onion and not just the breading, I'd find another recipe.

BEST EVER! I made tempura onion rings a few nights ago and was pretty bummed that the batter came off when I fried them. I look recipes up and seeing that this one had good reviews I decided to give it a go. I used freshly made breadcrumbs with my multi grain bread so it wasn't so dry. I also used like 3 medium onions. I yielded about 3-4 servings easy. Good stuff. This definitely will be going into my recipe collection.

Awesome onion rings!  They were quite time consuming but well worth it. I did have a problem with the batter sticking to some of the onions, but it was my first time making onion rings so I blame it on that.  Thanks Jean for the great recipe!

Pretty darned good. Next time I'll make the onion slices larger so they better balance the breading.

This is a good recipe and made this 3 times already. I used 3 large onions without adding more on the ingredients. I used Italian Bread Crumbs instead of plain. It was really good better than the one at fast food.

These are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, but only with half an onion since it was only for two people. I did end up having to re-dip some of the rings in the batter before coating with crumbs, but the result was onion rings that my DH said were the "best he's ever had."

These are the best onion rings I have ever had. The two times I have made these I used Vidalia Onions. I don't think I will ever try this recipe with regular onions. Set oven to 225 and  keep a pan in the oven with paper towel on it.  When a batch comes out of the oil put it in the oven. It keeps the rings warm and crisp.

These were very, very good.  I didn't have any seasoned bread crumbs so I used some shake and bake instead.  I'm sure they didn't have that "authentic flavor" everyone else posted about, but they were still really yummy!  Next time I'll make sure I have the bread crumbs AND I'll make 2 batches!  I tried making these with the giant freezer bag method like other reviewers, but it didn't work well for me.  The rings just didn't get as coated as I would've liked.  Next time I'll use the method listed in the recipe.

I have never rated a recipe after all the years of using this site but this one needed another set of 5 stars.  All I can say it is worth the extra effort because the onion rings were the best I've ever had.  My husband who is a onion ring snob LOVED them.  Thanks!

These are very good. I used previous suggestions and did the first two steps in a gallon zip bag. I also used Panko bread crumbs which made the most difference I think. They had wonderful crunch, and I did 2 medium onions. The kids even loved them.

WOW. Made these last night and LOVED them.  I've always wanted to use Panko crumbs, but never remembered to pick them up.  I was craving onion rings yesterday and read so many reviews about using the Panko crumbs, so I picked some up on my way home.  I'll always keep Panko crumbs on hand. What a difference they make!  These rings were wonderful.  Husband ate his first one and just kept nodding his head and chewing - nodding and chewing :-)  They were a little time consuming, but worth well worth the effort.  If I make any changes, it would be to add something, maybe a little to give it a little more kick.Thanks for another keeper!

I have made this recipe a bunch of times now, and it always gets rave reviews. I have been asked for the recipe several times too. I follow the recipe exactly, but instead of frying them, I just stick them on a pan, drizzle with some oil and bake them in my oven... soooo delicious!

Best onion rings ever!  Followed recipe to a "T".  It is a little time consuming, but well worth the effort.  I am going to make up a batch ahead of time, and flash freeze them without cooking them so that they will be ready to go next time.  Will let you know how that goes!

Delicious! This recipe was a big hit at our Super Bowl party. I didn't have "1 large onion", but I had a bag of yellow onions that were medium-sized. I used 2 of those onions and there was just enough batter. I cut them slightly thicker than 1/4 inch. We served them with Ken's Steak House Honey Mustard Dressing. The breading stayed on the onions, and was crunchy and delicious. This recipe is a keeper!

OMG! Fabulous recipe! I used Panko crumbs as someone suggested and a sweet white onion. I kept cooked rings in the oven at 250 degrees after each batch. The result was beautifully golden brown rings, crispy on the outside with soft onion on the inside. My hubby was very impressed! This one goes in the recipe book. Thanks!

Excellent dish! I'm a deep fryer novice and I found this an easy-to follow recipe. For a little extra heat, I added some cayenne pepper and tabasco sauce to the mixture.

Best Onion Rings EVER!  I have used this exact recipe and alter it from time to time to compliment the dish I am making.  Bread crumbs make all the difference to me, but other do no like them.  Either way they make a great onion ring.

"These are the best onion rings I've ever had!  Waaaay better than Sonic!" - My husband :)  

So yummy!  I dipped the onions in the egg/milk mixture, then in the flour, like another user said.  The breading stuck very very well!  

I didn't have regular bread crumbs, so I substituted Italian.  I added garlic salt and pepper to the crumbs as well.  They were so yummy!  Plus, they were really pretty, with all the little parsley flecks in them!  :)

Thanks for the great recipe!

These onion rings rock! I honestly didn't find them all that time consuming or difficult to make. I took the one reviewer's advice of doing the flour/batter part in a ziploc bag, and that worked great, really cut down on the messiness! I didn't use the deep fryer, just heated about 1/4" oil in my cast iron skillet. Thanks, I'll be making these again!

These onion rings are very, very good. I've made this recipe many times before and with only a few small alterations to the original recipe - those alterations being: adding about 3/4 teaspoon of garlic powder to the flour mixture, for extra flavor, and omitting the seasoned salt. Next time I make these, I'm going to add some onion powder to the flour mixture, too. I'm tempted to give this recipe four stars, as it's kind of a hassle to make, even when using bags and containers instead of bowls, but the onion rings are worth it enough for me not to. One last note: if you're thinking about baking these instead of frying, I recommend you NOT do this. I tried to once; the rings turned out very dry and funny tasting.

Wow. These are amazing. I'm a huge onion ring fan, and now when I get a hankering I will just make these. Yes, they are a lot of work, messy and time consuming - but worth it. I keep trying to refine the process (I've made them twice now) and have tried the ziploc bag and container w/ lid method - both are messy. Anyway, delicious - especially with the bloomin' onion dipping sauce from this site. I used panko which are delicious - I've also used seasoned Italian breadcrumbs. The panko are expensive, but delicious. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Simply the BEST!! Awesome results :) almost ate all of them. I did follow one of the reviews and placed the bread crumbs with the rings in a closed pan and it saved me a ton of time. Very crispy and the batter didnt fall off!! Ive tried a couple other recipes for them on here and nothing compares to the quality!!

wonderful!, and not THAT messy as I thought it would be, I was lazy and skipped the draining part, I just remove excess batter by shaking each one a little before putting  in the breadcrumbs   :D

Wow! I've made onion rings for years but never like these! Replaced half the milk with beer and used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs. Didn't even need any ketchup!

ok, it was a bit messy. The batter ratio seemed fine if anything could use more bread crumbs. I felt a lot of batter dripped off. Half the rings I also added the following spices: paprika, garlic salt, parlsley. They were in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes. Because of taste and appearance they were good, not great. If I had fried it would have been 5 stars it is just too unhealthy.

I had this recipie in my "recipie box" for a long time and finally made it. Step by step. Man, this is the best O-rings I ever made.
 The only problem was that I had no one else to share them with. 
 I may next time I make this is to add a splash of beer in the egg wash. Not sure what ,if any, difference it'll make.
 But be sure this summer when I smoke a dry rubbed beef brisket. This will be a garnish when served.

Just made these for the first time last night.  result was very good.  Only minor issue I had was by the time I got to coating the last of the rings with the bread crumbs, they had absorbed moisture from the earlier rings (and my fingers)and clumped up.  I also followed earlier recommendations and added some seasoning to the crumbs.  Overall - Yummy!

Very excellent tasting onion rings.  Made them tonight for the first time and I can say that without a doubt we'll be making them again.  Really easy to make.  Next time I may "jazz" them up a little with some seasonings, but they are awesome as the recipe is made to.

These were okay.  I was a little disappointed.  I was looking for a WOW onion ring recipe.  But thank you for the opportunity to try yours.
I tweaked the recipe a little.  I added tequila & 1 squeezed lime to the egg mixture.  To the bread crumb mixture I added dried cilantro & then fried.  Very tasty this way.  Tasted like Chi-Chi's tequila lime onion rings.

Whoah!! this one was off the chart.  And I think I know which "popular drive-in" it was...because I love their onion rings..Sonic.  Anyway, I'm an onion ring connoisseur and these exceeded my expectations. I'm in south Korea, had to use soybean oil and didn't have a thermometer, made my own breadcrumbs by toasting a crumbled hamburger bun then toasting and crushing it... And they were STILL amazing.  I like flavorful food too...but I can't see how anyone can think this is bland.  They taste like ONION RINGS.  For me....just a little salt lets the flavor of the onion come through. Ohh..I dip them in ketchup but that's just personal preference.  This will be given a special place in my cookbook.  I want to try the same coating with fish.  Thanks so much!!

These are the best onion rings I have ever had!  They are so easy to make and are absolutely delicious.  
I seasoned the flour with some "Essence" (Emeril's spice mixture with paprika, onion powder, garlic powder etc).  Also, I used the Italian style bread crumbs.  They were eaten quicker than I could make them! Finally, I served them with Ranch dressing - DELICIOUS!

Wow. Truly the best, most amazing homemade onion rings ever. Super crispy and flavorful. I recommend deep frying for 3 minutes until deep golden brown for the yummy texture (that actually enhances the taste)!

YUM!  They are very tasty.  They're fairly easy to make, but make sure you do follow the instructions when it comes to letting the batter drip off the onions.  This is important.  VERY GOOD!

4 stars for taste but 3 stars for the work involved.  I added a bit of garlic and extra salt for more flavor.  There wasn't one ring left, my family really enjoyed these and are requesting them already.  However, I dont know if I did something wrong but when frying I lost some of the batter/breading on the rings.  I drained the batter on racks and then coated rings in a covered container to help speed up the tedious process of coating the bread crumbs so that may have been the problem.  I did shake off excess fairly well.  Maybe I drained the onions too well first??  I am willing to make these again when I have plenty of time free.

I made these last night and they are very good.  I used Panko (Japanese) breadcrumbs for an extra crunch.  Didn't have time to let them drip over a rack so let them drip a little over the bowl then right into the crumbs and they were great.  Only thing I would do different next time is to season the flour mixture with some spices like garlic powder, salt, cayenne etc.  This recipe is a keeper!

Delightfull. I placed sliced onions in ice cold water to make them sweeter for an 1 hour and then dried them a little. I added no salt seasoning in with the flour with salt and cayenne pepper. Then I followed the directions of the recipe.

This may be partially my fault because I tried baking these instead of frying them.  It was just weird and too dry.  Also, I had some trouble getting the breading to stick.  They just weren't very good.

These were AWESOME!  I doubled the batter, which I'm glad I did because I would have ran out...I had a little extra, but I'd rather throw some away than not have enough!  It was a messy process, but SOOOOOO worth it and can't wait to make them again!

We loved these onion rings!  I added extra spices - garlic, paprika and cayenne pepper to both the flour and the bread crumbs.  The bread crumbs were homemade from the sweet Amish bread recipe from this site.  After I battered the onion rings, I let them drip on a metal skewer over a cookie sheet covered in aluminum foil - about 6 at a time.  From there I put them in the bread crumbs and one by one right into the fryer.  They turned out beautifully and were delicious.  Time consuming, but worth it.  Great recipe!

Wow!  Little ringlets of heaven!!!  As most of the previous reviews noted, these are both time and labor intensive...but well worth the time and effort!!!  Light, wonderful texture, not greasy at all.  Thank goodness for deep fry machines that regulate the temperature!  (To a previous reviewer, if your rings are greasy then either your oil temp wasn't high enough to start with or you overloaded the pan and brought the temp down too much.  Even in my fry machine I only did max of 6 at a time.)

Just a couple of comments.  A) I battered all of the rings first, put them on racks and THEN went back to breadcrumb them and lo and behold...the batter had started to dry and the breadcrumbs wouldn't stick.  Redipping in the batter solved the problem however.  These really need to be battered and breaded at the same time, although the breaded product held up well while waiting to fry up.  B) The flour/batter itself could use a touch more seasoning.  C) Through trial and error found that they only took 60 seconds in my fry machine.

You can be sure that I will be making these again...and again...and again...  My teenage son and I thank you, Jean!

Very nice,and I like the texture.Good looking food.

As seasoning I added a bit of turmeric,say 1/4 tsp,(good for health,adds colour & flavour),about 1/4 tsp of crushed red chilli Asflakes,some black cumin,and crushed garlic.
Went without seasoned salt.

I liked this, I really did, it's a good base for onion rings. A little bland but that is easily remedied. I like onion rings with a little more batter but figured out how to fix that after a few batches.

These were great. :D If you're careful, its not too messy to make. I didn't have any plain bread crumbs, so i used seasoned bread crumbs and omitted the salt. Also: just cook these until they're golden brown, so the onions are cooked but arent too soft and still have a taste.

One other thing I did:  I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand, so I whizzed some garlic-ranch croutons up in the food processor, instead.  Croutons are often a delicious substitute if you don't have breadcrumbs around.

This were pretty good although very time consuming and messy. I don't normally eat onion rings but these rings were actually good. I would recommend trying it.

I am not real fond of onion rings as they always tend to be far too greasy and heavy for me.But, I went out and bought a new Fry Daddy and made these for my fiance and other family members. They were crazy about this recipe and every piece was gone in no time flat. They were begging for more! I even thought they were excellent. Will make more tonight to stop the whining!

YUMMY ~ This Onion Ring Recipe is definetly a keeper.  I have made several onion ring recipes over the past year and this one definetly is Number One in my book.  I followed the directions exactly and they turned out wonderful. I cooked them in my Fry Daddy and they only took about 1 minute until they were golden brown.  Next time, I might add a pinch of pepper and little bit more salt, but other than that, the recipe was great!

Yum! These are far better than any onion rings I have ever tasted! I used italian bread crumbs since that was all I had on hand, and I served these with the bloomin' onion sauce found on this site. A fantastic combination, and well worth all of the effort.

I added a little cayenne pepper to the recipe to give it a little kick. The only suggestion I will make is that instead of coating individual rings I will separate the sliced onion into two to three rings per onion ring and then coat. This will give a little more onion taste. Very tasty the way it is!

Outstanding, they never made it to the table.  My wife and kids ate them faster than I could cook them. Put the foil under the rack or you could spend more time cleaning than cooking and eating.

A++ my daughter ate them as they were coming out of the fryer!! I used cornflake crumbs but no seasoned salt and they were still delicious. We even tried baking a few with cooking spray. We over cooked them a little so they were very crispy but but still yummy. I may try eggbeaters instead of egg next time to cut down on some fat.I was looking for a good onion ring recipe. A definite do again recipe. Thanks

These onion rings turned out very good!  Not greasy and they so much better than frozen onion rings from the grocer. Have the battered rings ready to go because they fry up quick!

Made these last night. They were everything an onion ring is supposed to be: crunchy with beautifully cooked onion. They also didn't fall apart when we ate them! We took perfect crunchy bites.

I used the full two cups of whole milk, choose to use panko bread crumbs instead of regular, and used coarse kosher salt. I also seasoned with Penzeys' Arizona Dreaming seasoning and Smoked Spanish Paprika, which gave them a stunning color and a really lovely flavor.

I am so happy with these. The process recommended here works so well. I'm really, really pleased with the outcome.

Followed Recipe to the letter,, PERFECT! Onion Rings, Yes it is a little bit of work, But that's what it takes to have Great Food! The Trick is to Drop in 4 or 5 rings(Depending on your fryer size, Don't crowd)  and when it stops sizzling,, flip the rings over for another 30-45 sec's. Golden Brown ,

Perfection! This was my first-ever attempt at onion rings. Couldn't have asked for a better starter recipe--won't try any other. (Due to our dietary preferences, I did substitute Bob's Red Mill all-purpose gluten-free flour and vanilla-flavored 2% reduced fat lactose-free milk.) I also mixed regular bread crumbs with panko to give them a bit more texture. Forgot to use the recommended seasoning--just salted lightly while hot--but will try seasoning next time for sure! For just the two of us, we only used just over half of a red (purple) onion and could barely gobble down half the bounty, so I let the rest cool completely and stored in a freezer bag with a paper towel to absorb any extra oil. The next night, we preheated the oven to 400 degrees, arranged the frozen onion rings in a single layer on a cookie sheet lined with foil, and popped them in the oven for about 5-8 minutes--didn't even have to flip them. The rings were even crispier and tastier than the first night. Glad they froze well--can make up a whole batch and freeze for future as well as keep leftovers longer! Thank you for  sharing.

Best Onion rings ever.  when I buy them at a restaurant I usually cannot eat more than 3 or 4 because of the grease but these were so crunchy and sweet that I kept eating and did not feel bad afterward.  definitely a keeper.

Made exactly as written. I found it a bit bland for my taste but the crispy coating was excellent. The next time I make this, I will try adding some onion powder or smoked paprika to the batter .

I made this as directed, except used an air fryer instead of deep frying. The breading didn't want to stick to the rings. I spritzed them with vegetable oil and they were tasty, but a lot of work. Probably won't make again because of that.

To die for!!  I made these for dinner tonight for my husband and me.  It's a bit messy, but so worth it!  

Okay, okay, I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I don't have bread crumbs, so I ground up a sleeve of townhouse crackers in the blender.  I also don't have a deep-fat fryer, so I used a cast-iron skillet and flipped them over to cook both sides.

But they're so GOOD!!

These turned out excellent. I only needed more bread crumbs. I did not drain off the batter on the rack, as I was trying to save time and mess. Next time I will drain them though. These onion rings are perfect texturally and to dip in your favorite sauce or ketchup. I used 1/2 of a white onion and 1/3 red onion already in the fridge. I used a skillet, turned up to 6 of 10 on my gas burner, and they browned beautifully within a minute on each side. Be ready to quickly pluck them out when done.

Best ever. The onion cooked all the way through and stayed crispy even when they got cold. I used a cajun seasoning instead of salt. They came out perfect. Onion did not separate from the batter at all. Definitely one I will keep using.

Delicious! Awesome comment replacement of 1/4 cup cornstarch instead of baking powder worked very well! The cornstarch made it more comfort-food like. Yum! M

You will need, at least, 2 feet of counter space. If those feet are consecutive, then you will be in great shape. Otherwise, maybe reconsider making this. Or, if you have an excellent sue chef in your tiny kitchen, maybe... but I probably won’t make it again.  Absolutely delicious, tho

I made these rings as the directions say minus the breadcrumbs and they came out great! crunchy onion rings just like I had a taste for all these days. Only problem is the baking powder makes it a lil more doughy than I'd like. nevertheless great recipe!

I did make some changes based on some advice by another reviewer but my husband said (and I agreed) they are the best onion rings we’ve ever had. I added some spices (garlic, white pepper, and cayenne) to my flour mixture as well as 1/4 cup potato starch. The starch really helped the mixture adhere to the onion rings.  We didn’t have a single ring that was separating from the breading - HUGE WIN. Also, I always soak my onions in buttermilk before dredging and frying so that was a no-brainer. Finally - panko for the win (again)!

Delish.  Didn't really measure anything but followed the technique without the baking powder.  Replaced spices with old bay and black pepper since I had some left over from another recipe.  Used panko because that's what I had.  Will make again.

5 star for giving us access to this recipe!! We live onion rings and I always make them gluten free. So I used all-purpose gluten free flour to replace the all- purpose flour. For the breadcrumbs, I finely chopped gluten free pretzels in my blender and they worked great. I don’t have seasoning salt on hand so I simply added the flavors I wanted. Garlic powder, cayenne pepper and smoked paprika.

I misread the recipe and I used 2 eggs so mine were slightly eggy tasting but super delicious. They would have been amazing if I read it correctly. I used avocado oil. 5 stars

I made these today for lunch and they were delicious.  I used panko bread crumbs as suggested by another reviewer.  I doubled the amount but It still wasn’t quite enough and I added some bread crumbs because I had used all the panko I had.  I also used two cups of buttermilk instead of milk.  In my deep fryer, they took about a minute and a half to cook but I didn’t load the basket up too full.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I am not sure about the high reviews for this. I made it exactly how the recipe says and none of my breading stuck to the onion ring. I used 1% milk maybe that was the issue? However the cook time was on point. I’m very disappointed

I only made little changes: my milk was expired so i just exchaged that to sparkling cider, and i only put like 3/4 tsp of salt. It was so good and crunchy. I will for sure make it again soon!

This is the second time I've made these delicious rings.  The first time they were perfect.  The second time, I was distracted and waited too long to dip in the bread crumbs to fry after dipping in the milk/egg mixture.  The crumbs didn't stick very well.  Don't wait more than a couple minutes!  Otherwise, they're crunchy, crispy, wonderful onion rings.  This is my go to recipe from now on.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it was perfect! I used yellow onions, panko bread crumbs, and finished them with salt and old bay seasoning. They tasted exactly like A&W onion rings, my favourite!

This was a bit messy, but they turned out delicious! I was in a rush, and we cooked approx half of ours without pressing them into any bread crumbs. Haha.. the second half just got those sprinkled on both sides prior to frying. But even with my last minute fix, they turned out so good..(All of them). Thanks for this recipe. It was far better than any kind of store bought onion rings.

Even better than restaurants if you season them the way you want and take your making each one count.

I used Panko bread crumbs on some, seasoned Italian bread crumbs on some, and homemade wheat bread crumbs on the rest. I put Lawry's seasoned salt on some and regular table salt on others. They were all very good. My wife and son and I polished them off in no time flat.

These onion rings are SO MUCH BETTER than the frozen onion rings  you buy in the store, and so much cheaper.  Yes, they are a little messy to make and a little time consuming to fry, but one onion makes a HUGE PLATE of onion rings and people will want to snatch them up and eat them before they get to the table.  Perfect with fry sauce (half mayo, half catsup).

amazing! they taste just like Burger King. pro tip: freeze the Onion slices before battering, to make them super soft, and not pull away from the breading when you bite in.

I have to say "I don't care for onions much, but these are so good!"  We also have replaced the onion in this recipe with okra and squash, those also turned out really good.

We absolutely love & crave these. I cook a lot & really enjoy entertaining. These are addictive. They are a fiddle but so worth it! I just make sure I have enough time to enjoy the completion of each stage. I did not change a thing regards the recipe. I did heed another reviewers suggestion and use a skewer to put the rings on and let it drip over a bowl, great idea & less clean up! Thank you JeanieMomof3 for this stellar recipe! I’m 62, mom of three & grandma of five...still learning.

Had a bunch of leftover onion slices from a bbq so made these on a whim. Made them as written except  I added extra seasoning to the flour and breadcrumbs & shallow fried in about 3/4 of an inch of peanut oil in a deep stockpot to minimize the mess. Hubby and I gobbled them up, didn't even need any ketchup or sauce.

This is my first time making onion rings. I didn't know what to expect. However, I was pleasantly surprised! The onion rings were crispy, and delicious. Something I may change next time is to add some spicier seasonings to the mix to give them a little kick!

The recipe is easy to follow and doesn't call for ingredients you'll spend all day hunting for.  The prep was a bit messy because batter but the end result is so worth it!  I didn't alter the recipe in order to get a good baseline.  After tasting the final product the only thing I will change next time is using Adobo All Purpose Seasoning instead of salt.  I will definitely make these again!

I changed a few things. I used the Italian breadcrumbs. I skipped dredging the onion in flour and instead of letting the rings drip after dredging them in the batter, I immediately dredge them in the breadcrumbs and then throw them into the fryer. The breading on them seems to be thicker this way. At the end I mix the leftover batter with the breadcrumbs to form 1-2inch round dough balls then fry them. My son LOVES the dough balls.

This is so good and, maybe, the best onion rings I've ever had. I used panko bread crumbs (because they were the cheapest bread crumbs at the grocery store) and Goya Adobo hot salt. I also added some fresh ground black & white pepper. They were amazing. I food allergies to some processed foods, so I take a gamble every time I eat out or buy frozen foods. These will be the only onion rings I eat from now on, since I know what's in them.

It was easy to make and delicious! Everyone at home liked it! Unfortunately, since I didn't have seasoned salt,  I ruined the first batch by using homemade seasoned salt from a recipe I found here, it was sweet and I failed to tasted it before I put it on my onion rings. Next time, if I don't have seasoned salt, I will leave them without it, they really don't need it.

Followed how one reviewer used Panko. Only I bought the fine extra crunchy Panko. Instead using blender. This is a great recipe. We all loved the onion rings

Instead of panko crumbs, I just dipped mine in flour again...

I use this base recipe for all  breaded fried foods...fish, shrimp, mozarella (yes I cubed actual mozeralla and breaded then fried it, it was amazing!),  its so good on anything!

AWESOME...  I used panko...  used the bags.... I did the egg, then flour, then egg, then panko steps....  

BEST OF ALL...   USE LARD !!  Seriously... 
  The ONLY oils in my kitchen are Olive Oil, and Sesame Oil...  for flavor... NOT TO FRY IN ....  I'll Occasionally buy Peanut Oil,  but NEVER Veg/Corn/Canola ..Causes Huge health problems

LARD is actually Healthier for you.  Makes food taste AMAZING like when we were kids in the 60's... French fries.. YUM... and it keeps better when you strain / refrigerate / reuse in a Deep Fryer...

GRANDMA WAS RIGHT ABOUT THIS ONE!!!!

I made little changes to spices, I added some garlic powder and black peper to the flour mixture.  Other than that it was great . Crispy and it doesn't go soft after cooling.

We followed the recipe exactly, but we did 2 onions and had enough batter for both. Next time we will add the seasoned salt to the bread crumbs. Definitely plan to use this recipe again!

I made this with gluten-free flour, vegan egg substitute, and lactose free creamer in place of milk (I have a lot of dietary restrictions due to health issues) and my onion rings came out perfect! I seasoned lightly with salt and pepper and got the onion rings I had been craving! I fried about 1/2 of mine and froze the rest to use later this week. I am in love with this recipe though, they were flavorful, crispy, and delicious! and the recipe was messy, but pretty easy

This is a great recipe. We've tried several others for onion rings and this one is the absolute best.

Wow, these are the best onion rings ever. I did make 2 substitutions though.  I used buttermilk for the milk and panko for the regular bread crumbs.  Followed all directions as written. I will never even think of trying another recipe because this one is a keeper! Even my daughter who does not like onion rings devoured them!

These were delicious!  I had spare batter, so I coated cauliflower as well.  I used regular bread crumbs this time, and next time I will try the Panko style.   These have a shelf life of about 30 minutes, so try to make them immediately before serving .

Made these for Memorial Day.  My thought was that is a lot of onions rings for three people.  I guess they were good because there was not a crumb left.  Looks like I am making them for the July 4th BBQ too.

These turned out delicious! I had a hard time stopping myself from eating them as soon as they came out of the fryer. I used Italian style bread crumbs. When i first followed the recipe as is I felt the flavor in the breading was a little bland. I just added a little garlic powder and more salt/pepper and they came out great. Will definitely be making these again!

I have made this a few times, usually following the recipe to a T. Most recently for Father's Day and so I just today decided to rate it because it is really worth a try if someone is on the edge of picking this over another. This particular time I didn't use the bread crumbs. The batter came out as a perfect puffed up coating. I also didn't use the fryer, I used a dutch oven and a thermometer. All the onions came out wonderfully, and then I put in the fish to fry using the same batter. The first few fish pieces came out well, but I didn't bring the oil back up to the temp, so my error, usually this recipe works for a fish fry too.

Definitely going to make these again. I had some extra Panko crumbs so I eyeballed some into the four mixutrue. I didn't pulse them in a blender or food processor like another review suggested. I also added a considerable about of pepper into the egg dip because I like them peppery.

Everything went exactly according to plan with these, and my family absolutely could not stop eating them. The word "perfect" was used, and they thought they were better than restaurant quality. It's a fantastic recipe that could easily be tweaked here or there to personal preference,

Put a ring on it!   This recipe is defiantly a keeper.   Use a Vidalia onion or some other sweet onion...its defiantly worth it.  I also put some garlic powder, onion powder, pinch of salt and fresh ground black pepper in the flour before coating them.  I also put a  table spoon of Parmesan in the bread crumbs.   VOLA!

Absolutely delicious!  Amazing crunch,  perfect amount of salt,  and love that it's perfectly seasoned without being overpowered by other seasonings so the onion flavor isn't lost. My husband loved these and we devoured them pretty quickly! I'd definitely make these over and over and over again!

These were messy and labor intensive (next time, I'm gonna use the ideas from Christina B), but they taste fantastic! Very crunchy. We used sweet onions, which worked well. We will definitely make them again.

Awesome recipe! Just like you order at restaurants. First time made as written; second time skipped the step of "letting rings drip". I just went from egg/milk mixture to breadcrumbs. Hung them from
chopsticks laid across bowl and fried as directed. One of best recipes from this site!

Perfect! Made one batch with bread crumbs. That was great. Made another batch with Panko. That was spectacular. And then made another batch with the leftover batter and that was equally just as spectacular!

Yep, these are just like the 'drive in'! The only thing I will add next time is a little sugar. They need that little sweetness. I had to salt them pretty heavily after frying. And you probably need more than a cup of milk. The batter was really thick! I only had planko bread crumbs, so I crushed them really well before using.

My wife loved these, but I think I've come to the conclusion that I just don't care for onion rings.
1. Love onions, check...
2. Love crunchy things, check...
3. Love onion rings, not so much...
 I've tried tons of recipes and this one seems close to what I want onion rings to be, but there is just not enough onion flavor. I even tried adding 2 tsp of onion powder to the flour/batter. I might try this coating on something else, maybe mushrooms.

We put the sliced sweet onions in milk  for about 4 hours because of something my wife had read. Also used panko as the final coating as some of the other reviews suggested. These were the best onion rings we have ever made or eaten at any restaurant, hands down! Crispy and not greasy. Can't wait to have them again and again!

Oh man!! These were awesome. I had thought making onion rings would take a lot of steps and be challenging to get just right, but these was a simple and delicious recipe!

I added cajun spice to a few rings to spice 'em up!

The best onion rings to make at home.  They come out just as good in a skillet as they do in a deep fryer.  My family likes to match them with "bloomin onion" dipping sauce.  I used Panko bread crumbs for the crunch.  They worked perfectly.

This recipe was amazing!  Easy to do, perfect result.  Only thing I changed was to use buttermilk since it's what I had on hand.

Delicious, of course.  I've made the decision to use this recipe for pancakes! (LOL)  Followed the recipe precisely -- the batches with fewer pieces seem to have fried more evenly -- no surprise.  We will make these again, in five years, after we've worn off the effects of this evening!

I made it for my friends and they liked it a lot. I used panko instead of bread crumbs. It was hard to get the panko to stick on, so next time I will probably crush them some more before using it. I added some garlic powder and paprika for extra seasoning.

So easy. I also added some paprika to the batter. I was too impatient to let them drip dry, so mines looked a little more gnarly but still delicious - I actually liked those crispy, irregular parts. Thank you for sharing.

Really loved the recipe. The texture of the batter and it's perfect crispness made it a hit here:  For a little added flavor I added 1/2 packet of Italian Seasoning  salad dressing mix from Good Seasons.

Wow. These were SO crunchy and good! The bread crumbs help the salt stick after being fried. The smoother onion ring just don't hold the salt as well. I'll definitely be making these again. AND I'm always surprised by how many rings one onion makes. :)

OMG these were fantastic! they do take some 'prep' work but within 10 minutes i was enjoying what i had just made. I added a product called 'the mix' into the batter instead of just plain salt, and added to my crumb mix made from bread in a food processor  as it only takes a minute and i had no other crumbs, some 'Salt Bird' Salt and Spice mix . My wife even enjoyed these and she does not typically eat this sort of food. Highly recommend this recipe for great taste and texture with the perfect crunch with each bite.

CHEFS/COOKS BEWARE!  Before making these please keep in mind these will become an obsession with everyone that tries them and you will forever be required to make them!  
YES THEY ARE THAT GOOD!  Even though they are deep fried, they dont taste heavy.  For some reason, they have a light airy taste.  I do used panko bread crumbs instead of the finer ones which gives them an extra crispyness.  I do recommend using those big juicy red onions as they turn out so flavorful and sweet.

Probably one of the Better onion ring recipes I've had. With that being said the batter needs something to jazz up the flavor. I will make these again for sure but I'm going to be tweaking it to make them more desirable to me and my family.

First time ever making home made onion rings and they were amazing.  Took some tips from here and they came out spot on.  They were so fresh and crunchy.  I used panko bread crumbs blitzed until fine, added garlic powder and paprika to the batter, sat the onions rings in ice water 1 hour prior to starting and used the skewer over the bowl tip to save mess.  Thank you so much!

These onion rings were so delicious.  They cooked up crispy and light.  This, like most foods that require multiple breading, was messy but worth it.

Very, very good. I highly recommend it. The bread crumbs make it a little messy but, we're cooks, that's what we do. I only gave it a four because the best onion rings I have ever had were made by my father. But, these are still fantastic.

Used the recommendation and soaked onions in ice water before the first coat of flour so breaking adheres better. Also added the two tablespoons of instant mashed potato mix to the batter after adding the eggs and milk to thicken the batter. Used Italian breadcrumbs and ground them smaller in a food processor to make the coating finer. Added personal spices to the breadcrumbs to taste.

Kudos! This recipe is a winner. 
Other than soaking the sliced onion in water for 15-20 minutes and using other reviewers’ suggestion of using a zip-lock bag for the flour coating I followed the directions and ingredient list as given.  The results were a perfect light golden crust that stayed on the rings perfectly. 
Thank you for the recipe!

These were delicious!  They came out even better than our favorite seafood restaurant.  We used large yellow onions.  The recipe was easy to prepare and the results absolutely scrumptious!   This is all we had for lunch and every bite was savored.  I used Panko bread crumbs.  They were light and crunchy.

I just made these. They turned out great ! I didn't have any milk so I used cream and water . I used self rising flour instead of all purpose. Made my own bread crumbs. I will definitely be making these again.

Perfect onion rings! I recommend soaking the onion rings in cold water (preferably in the fridge) for at least an hour before you batter them. This will keep the onion in the batter ring when you take a bite.

This recipe is wonderful.  Everybody loved them.  I have celiacs so I substituted Pamela's Pancake and Baking Mix for the all-purpose flour.  I did add some parsley and pepper.  I used 4c gluten free plain bread crumbs.  My boyfriend says their better than a Bloomin Onion and my son says not quite. Lol.  This is a bit messy, but worth it!

So darned good! Made these for the first time tonight to have with my Buffalo Shrimp and they were a BIG hit with the family. The only change I made to was to a mixture of Panko and regular breadcrumbs. The Panko made them nice and crunchy. These will definitely be  going into my dinner rotation!

Excellent and so easy. I used italian seasoned  panko because it's all i had (I'm not a fan of regular breadcrumbs) and they were delicious. Don't add salt if you decide to used seasoned crumbs otherwise it over powers the flavor. My husband loved these with the fish n' chips i made.

Love this recipe. The best onion rings I ever had. Love the fact that they are breaded. One thing: You really need to add more flavor to the rings, otherwise they are too bland.

These onion rings tasted great. My mother really loved them. The preparing part was a little messy but the ingredients are really simple and the recipe was easy to make. It's better to add milk first to the flour mixture and mix and then later add egg to it. This way there won't be any lumps present. Because I did the opposite but it still tasted great. I made them for lunch and not a single piece was left uneaten.

Delish!  First attempt at onion rings and so happy with the results!  Important to keep the temp as close as possible to 365 degrees.  And no need to let drip on the rack - just dip, let drip back into batter bowl, dip in the breadcrumbs and into the oil.  Perfect, like restaurant good!

I made these for the first time last night. Best O-rings I've ever made and if I've ever had any in a restaurant that were better I don't remember. I'll make these again and again. The extra steps are worth it.  Make sure to dip the rings in bread crumbs one at a time and brush crumbs over them. I tried short cutting and just rubbing them around in the crumbs. I ended up with no coating areas where my hand touched the rings. they were still great though. They were even great at room temperature where other recipes lose their appeal when they cool down.

Love this recipe. It was simple and very easy. The onion rings had good crunch and the family loved them. I used Lawry's Seasoned Salt on some but not all. Either way they were delicious. Been asked to make again

Loved this method! Onion rings turned out better than ever. I altered the recipe just slightly. I used panko bread crumbs and seasoned my flour with additional seasonings, such as, paprika, pepper, BBQ seasoning, garlic powder and a few others that I can't remember. I also let them set on wax paper for 15 minutes before cooking. Everything else I did the same, and they were perfect. Super crispy, and held the batter amazingly!!!

Love this recipe! Just wish I had a few extra arms. I only made one change, I used panko bread crumbs instead of what the recipe calls for and they came out amazing. Family loved them. Will defiantly be making again

I love these onion rings and have made them several times over the last few years after finding this recipe. They are very messy to make and can be time consuming, but the end result is excellent. I do add seasonings beyond what is in the recipe. It's versatile so I change it all the time. Garlic powder, seasoned salt, pepper, sometimes a little cayenne, parsley, or anything really. I add to both the flower mixture and the breadcrumbs. Tonight, after not having made them for awhile due to the mess factor AND how time consuming they are, I followed the directions in one of the reviews for the "no mess" method. Not only was it "no mess", but it was SO fast! I had 30-40 rings ready to go in the fryer within 20 minutes or less. I'll always make them this way now, and probably much more often now that I can have the prep done so quickly.

Extremely easy to make, i dont have a fryer and didnt want to use a lot of oil for deep frying..........i simply coated one onion ring at a time in flour without adding salt, dipped it in egg and milk, coated in bread crumbs and repeated the whole process again to make an even thicker coat, i took a small tea boiling pot, so small but deep that it could hold only one to 2 cups of water at a time, added very little oil but due to the shape and size it became good enough to deep fry, and the onion rings turned out delicious!!!!!!!! No oiliness at all

This is literally the best onion ring recipe I have ever tried. I substituted milk for almond milk. I dipped the rings in the milk and egg batter then flour then in the milk batter again and then the flour batter again. Then I fried them. I will be using this recipe forever!

Came out great! I love thin crispy onion rings and this recipe gave me that. My boyfriend loves them and said they were way better than any onion ring you get at fast food or even sit down places. I do mix the crumbs and flour mixture all together to save time and mix onions in all together. Simple recipe but comes out great!

Placed all the dry ingredients in a zip lock bag, and tossed the onion rings in it. Added all the wet ingredients into a bowl and whisked them together. Added all the wet ingredients into the ziplock bag and mixed. In a separate plate added panko bread crumbs and placed the O rings in it one by one and set them aside in a cookie rack. Added a little extra pepper, paprika  and salt. Came out great, perfect golden brown. Fried them 1 min on each side on med high.

They were good. A bit doughy sometimes but that may have been because I didn't put them on a rack to drip! Would def do again!  P.s. I did not bread crumb them.

Good recipe, but without any seasoning, a bit bland.  I added onion powder and black pepper to the second batch.  A significant improvement!

I found this recipe a while back. I had been in search of a crunchy onion ring recipe. I had to look no further because I had found what I was looking for in this recipe. Although, I don't season my onion rings with seasoning salt but that is mostly a family preference more than anything. My family loves these onion rings!

I too made a few modifications - out of necessity when I ran out of panko crumbs mid way, and I thought I had regular bread crumbs, but could not find them.  I used Matzo meal, as I've done before when making my "Jew Fried Chicken."  I added some garlic salt to liven it up.  They came out much better than the panko version, and the matzo really stuck well to the coating.  Nice, light and crisp, with a LOT of flavor.

I used Walla Wallas which were great with this!

Delicious!  I used Italian flavor breadcrumbs (that's all I had) and these rings turned out incredibly well.  The saltiness of the breading complimented the sweet Vidalia onion.  I was impressed.

This recipe is beyond brilliant! I have spent my entire childhood looking for an onion rings recipe which would yield such crunchy goodness and this recipe just trumps it all! Perfectly crunchy on the outside and caramel-y sweetness on the inside; just simply brilliant. The best dip for the rings is the combination of mustard+ketchup+mayo in the exact same amount. Do give it a try!

Thank you so much for this brilliant recipe!


UPDATE: In case your onion is too zingy or 'spicy', just soak the raw onion rings in ice cold water for about 30 minutes and work the magic!

I loved these onion rings and made them pop just that little bit by adding some dried ranch dressing to the flour mix.  Loved the tip about putting the battered rings on a cooling tray.  Clean up took less than two mins while the burgers were cooking.  They were super crisp and the onion was sweet and delicious.  I am watching carbs but could not resist a couple of these.  I used panko and did not add egg to the batter - just a little milk.  They were perfect and hubbby was thrilled with them.

I followed the easy clean up advice from Christina B and that helped a lot. I used the panko breadcrumbs only because it was all I had on hand. I actually loved the panko crumbs better than regular breadcrumbs.  This recipe is delicious! !

Best onion rings ever!  Occasionally, rather than grilling burgers, I'll pan fry them.  These onion rings are the perfect complement to the burger.  There never seems to be enough.  My only complaint is that they take a lot longer than 18 minutes to cook.  But the end result is worth the time.

The best one I have ever tried! It fluffs up nicely and covers your onions well (or anything you want to deep fry) As a fan of Paprika spice I added some and mmmm .

I actually made a mistake when mixing the batter up. I was just looking at the ingredients and so I mixed everything together! It was soooo thick, so I read the instructions and realized what I'd done wrong. Anyway, I just added about a cup more milk and made a batter that I coated the onion rings in before deep frying! Wow were they ever good! My kids were eating them faster then I could keep up! These are my favorite onion rings ever! I think I'll make the mixing mistake again because it made it so much easier for me. One less step.

These were good but a little tricky to make without a deep fryer since I didn't have any way to know the temperature of the oil.  The first one I had my stove set at 8 and it started to burn too fast so I turned it down to 4 and they didn't cook so probably around 6-7 is good.  If you let the onions sit too long to drip then the bread crumbs do not stick so well and the whole breading starts to come off in the oil.  I am sure it all takes practice to get it down right.

Very yummy homemade onion rings! This recipe was my first attempt at making them and they turned out really good. I did add some rosemary, thyme and oregano as one person suggested.  This added just a little extra oomph.  Will definitely make these again, but maybe bake instead to make them a bit "healthier".

Excellent! Restaurant quality onion rings at home.  These were crunchy not filled with grease and looked beautiful.  Will never buy freezer onion rings again, these are 1000x better!

I'm not sure how anyone could mess these up.  These were the best onion rings we've ever made and my husband said they were the best he's had.  I fine-ground up dried out homemade bread for the crumbs and used half and half instead of milk because I was out of milk and didn't realize it until we had gotten everything else ready.  They were light and airy and perfectly crisp.  I loved the idea of letting them sit on a rack so that they wouldn't get all doughy.  Next time I might try to add some seasonings just to try something different.  I think it's a fantastic recipe!

Awesome!!  I fried with vegetable oil on the stove, I didn't check the temperature or anything, I just waited until it was hot and threw them in.  To get the flour coating to stick I had to wet the onions first.  One suggestion would be to season the rings first or they are a bit bland.  I would put seasoning salt and pepper in with the bread crumbs.  Oh, and instead of bread crumbs, I used panko that was pulverized in my Magic Bullet blender.

I was craving something fried, and these definitely hit the spot! I used canola oil for frying, panko bread crumbs, and half and half instead of milk. They came out crispy, rich, and absolutely perfect! I definitely recommend these to everyone.

I listened to a few of the other reviewers and made some changes. I soaked the rings in buttermilk for an hour first. Then, i added spices like garlic and old bay to the flour mix. I didn't want to use any egg, so i substituted a teaspoon of baking soda mixed in with some water and vinegar--this lets batter rise without egg.  It is important to let the battered pieces rest on a rack for a bit prior to frying. I used a regular pan with oil. These are some Killer Rings now!!

Oh wow, these were really good. Just perfect. I used seasoning salt and a little pinch of cayenne pepper, garlic salt and some pepper to season the flour before coating. These were AWESOME. Once you eat these, you will never eat a frozen onion ring again. These were perfect.

yum yum yum, the only thing I did different was cornflakes instead of bread crumbs, cuz that's all I had. Buttermilk instead of regular milk. Oh and adding garlic, onion, salt, pepper, & cayene.

I followed the directions exactly and these are the BEST onion rings I have ever had.  Even my husband who is not crazy over onion rings loved them.  I did not find them greasy at all.  They are a little time consuming but well worth it if you want a fantastic onion ring.

These were perfect!  Wonderfully crunchy.

I used cornflake crumbs because we can't use bread.  I also added some spices - onion powder, garlic powder, and smoked paprika.  

For those who had trouble with the batter sticking - I'm betting your batter was too thin.  Mine was very thick and pasty and I had no problems getting it to stick.

I read the directions, and then followed them pretty casually. Used beer instead of milk (beer-battered?), and then added some powdered potatoes to the batter. I didn't know how thick the batter should be, so I went with "the thicker the better- more gunk!". I later learned that the thinner batter works better- lighter, crispier, more delicious onion! While I think my rings were pretty successful, making them was such a terrifying experience. When someone else prepares fried foods you don't realize the scope of how unhealthy it is, just deliciousness. I love my occasional share of junk food, though after a few onion rings I just felt really disgusting. Probably good for sharing with many people, though a large serving is just sickening.

I have never made onion rings at home before until I tried this recipe.  They turned out great.  I don't know why I never thought of making these at home.  They so beat the cold onion rings it seems that I get in a restaurant.  My husband really liked them too.  Instead of having hamburgers and fries, I think I will rotate with the onion rings.

Best onion rings I ever made.
I don't know why this recipe has some bad reviews.This came so well crispy not greasy. I had done breading each single onion slices so took longer but ok.
I used Progresso Bread crumbs (Plain) if it helps you.

I loved it! I used Panko instead of the bread crumbs and added seasoning to the panko.  The Panko helped to make them super crispy! This recipe is a keeper.

I made these Onion Rings one day for my family but instead of using 1 onion I used 2 because I thought 1 just wouldn't be enough. HUGE mistake!  1 onion would have been plenty. I also used Panko bread crumbs for that incredible crunch. Absolutely delicious and way better than any Onion Ring you order in any restaurant.

Pretty foolproof recipe, but a little messy and the ratio of batter to onion to breadcrumbs was off. I needed at least twice as many breadcrumbs to get through an entire large onion, and there was leftover batter. With panko crumbs, these come out impeccably crunchy. I fried them in a skillet with about 1/2 inch of oil and flipped them once as I don't have a deep fryer - works great.

My first time making onion ring. I wanted a more fluffy yet crispy breading.SO I did tweaked it a bit. I made bread crumbs from bread slices baked 10-15 mins in oven, then crumbled in blender. I added the bread crumbs to the batter and dipped rings and immediately dip rings in oil cooking for about 2 mins. They were fantastic!

This recipe is a great one and I forgot the last step...I forgot to coat in bread crumbs. My husband still raved how great they were and we are now going to try boneless chicken pieces in the batter (minus the bread crumbs). We made a great dip which is an Applebee's copy cat recipe for the blooming onion sauce.
Next time I make these I will remember the bread crumbs and I'm sure they will be even better! I can't wait! So easy and delicious!!
Thanks for a great batter!

I thought it was great for what it was fried onion rings, the only change I made was I used panko crumbs instead definitely makes them restaurant quality crunchy for a fraction of the cost.  I also skipped the drip dry step and threw em in the oil after panko coating I just made sure to shake off excess batter as much as I could.  Hubby said,"they were the best he's ever had!"  We don't usually eat fried food so because of that we had an extra serving I'd say there were 4-5 servings worth not 3.

Incredible recipe with one change . . . use Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs.  I would also double dip re once in flour and then once in batter, then repeat.

Our whole family loves these.  Add additional seasonings to the coating to suit you taste.  We like using the Panko breadcrumbs for a crunchy outiside.

Delicious! Very cripsy too! I tend to like only the beer battered type of onion rings, but these were delicious and the extra breading keeps them so crispy. Definitely try these!

Made these today and they were so good! Like many, I used Panko breadcrumbs and the rings had a great texture. Did them in batches and held the ready ones in a 225 oven and they stayed hot and crunchy. Served them with spicy ketchup (3 parts ketchup and 1 part Sriracha sauce) YUM!

These were awesome! Did the zip-lock bag way, it was still a little messy but easier. I used a medium sized onion and it seemed like it was just enough. Would think you would have to double the recipe for anything more. I would add a little more salt or some kind of spice to add a little to the flavour. Will save and definitely make them again. There were no leftovers!

This was my first time making onion rings and I followed the recipe exactly except I only had panko bread crumbs so that was what I used. I don't think I will even try it with regular breadcrumbs next time. They were so crunchy and light! Husband loved them!

This is the first time I have ever made a breaded recipe that works! The magic must be in the dipping process. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect!!!!! So excited when a recipe tastes as good as it claims to.

I made this recipe tonight and it was the best. A lot of the recipes for onion rings are really greasy/soggy but these were crunchy and tasted wonderful. The only thing I changed with the recipe was I used wheat Ritz crackers instead of the bread crumbs. I will be making these again!!

Fantastic! We made these as the inaugural use of our deep fryer. It was the PERFECT way to start our deep fry fascination! The kids declared them, "Just like a restaurant!" I predict we'll be making these often (hopefully not too often or we'll have to be rolled out doorways). Thanks for the recipe!

I've made other onion ring recipes and some were a disaster. The coating just fell off and they were soggy. Last night I made this recipe and the onion rings were absolutely fantastic! Flavorful and wonderfully crunchy! Thank you for sharing it!

This was awesome!  At the suggestion of another reviewer, I used ziploc bags instead of bowls and it wasn't too terribly messy.  I had to make my own bread crumbs by using a toaster to get the bread super crispy and then ground it up in a food processor.  I added some Cajun seasoning, crushed black peppercorn, cayenne pepper and chili powder  to the bread crumbs, then shook it up really well to incorporate.  I generally prefer olive oil for health reasons, but was out so I used vegetable oil.  These turned out very well.

So delicious!  I have no deep fryer, so I just used a deep pan.  I used a mixture of panko crumbs and regular bread crumbs.  Also added chilli powder, curry powder, onion powder, ginger, dried sweet basil, cumin, a tiny bit of nutmeg, salt, and pepper.  Very flavorful, with a nice crunch!  Would definitely make again and again.

The only thing I did different in making this recipe is I used Bread Crumbs with Italian Seasoning instead of just plain bread crumbs. I made the change due to not having plain bread crumbs, but it was Really good, that I didn't even use ketchup to eat them as I normally do! They were only 'lightly' flavored & came out PERFECT! This is a GREAT Recipe that has made my ~personal~ Recipe Box!:-)

I love good onion rings and these were better than good! They were excellent - crunchy outside and the onions didn't slip away from the breading when you bite into them. Five stars and more if possible.

I dominated my boyfriend in a Bobby Flay style Onion Ring throwdown using this recipe.  My onion rings won hands down against a panel of college guys with experienced bar-food palettes.  The batter holds really well to the onion leaving a light and crisp coating that's not too heavy.

These are excellent!  They were not too greasy and very flavourful and not heavy on the breading.  Even my kids ate them and they do not usually like onion rings.  Will definately make again!  We also used Italian Bread Crumbs which made them even better!!

Pretty good! Messy to make, but well worth it. The coating comes out thick and crunchy without being greasy. I used panko bread crumbs but I think I'll try seasoned breadcrumbs next time.

Fabulous! I used a generic Shake and Bake as my bread crumbs (but omitted the salt required in the recipe). Still left them a little salty. Next time I think I'll mix a few bread crumbs with the Shake and Bake.  Other than that, which was my own fault, they were amazing. 

The family went crazy for them - Myself included! 

I am looking at the mushrooms, zucchini, and anything else that can be battered to try this on. 

Delicious!

I realize onion sizes vary greatly, but I would suggest doubling the batter/coating recipes if your onion is anywhere near LARGE... I ran out and it was a total pain to make more during the cooking process.  I did 2 batches, "plain" and "seasoned," and everyone agreed the seasoned ones were MUCH better.  Lots of reviewers said this was "missing something," and I'm pretty sure it's seasoning.  I used 1 ts cayenne, 1 ts paprika, 1 ts onion powder, 1 ts salt mixed in to the bread crumbs (Panko!).  Also subbed beer for milk in the 2nd batch and this added a bit more flavor as well.  I will use this batter again for frying, which I don't do often, but with some seasoning it is quite good... might make good fried chicken, fish or shrimp as well.

IMO this needed more seasoning. I even added 1 tsp each of cayenne, garlic powder, and pepper.  Used panko instead of bread crumbs.  And I also baked in a 400° oven for 15-20 minutes (I didn't have oil).  When I try this again I'll fry as instructed and see if it's any better.

Prep can be a bit messy but the end result is well worth it. Crispiest recipe I've been able to find and way yummy. I think next time I may try the petal shape to see if it cuts down on the messy factor.

I didn't have bread crumbs or panko so I used Matso Meal instead.  I would not suggest using this as they came out a little heavy.  The flavor was great, the texture was fine.  I used the baggie method, so making them was easy and clean up was easier.  Deep fried them for about 3 minutes and they looked great.  Will make them again when I have bread crumbs.

I've been meaning to try this recipe out for the longest time, and I finally got around to doing it the other night...and let me tell you, this is the BEST HOMEMADE ONION RING recipe that I've tried yet! It's got a great crunch and tastes just like what you would get in a restaurant :) Now, it's not mentioned what kind of consistency the batter should have, so I just went for a batter that was slightly thicker than pancake batter - and it worked. The breading didn't take long to turn golden brown, which concerned me a bit because I didn't want raw onion rings, but the onions cooked up pretty quick and were perfect :) This will be my go-to recipe for onion rings from now on - no more beer battered :D

This is a good recipe. I didn't have flour so I used bisquick, omitted the salt and baking powder and used panko bread crumbs.  It turned out light and very crispy just like I like it.

I made these last night for our camping group and everyone loved them.  I did mess up with the directions and they still turned out great.  (I forgot to put the milk/egg mixture into the flour mixture...I only dipped them into the flour, then the milk/egg mixture and then bread crumbs).  Will definitely make again doing it the proper way this time.

Based on taste alone I would probably give this recipe a 5.  I gave it a 4 because it is a little messy and uses a lot of dishes to make! Although, I guess that is expected with any onion ring recipe.  I did follow the first review and used a bag though. But, other than that the recipe has to be followed exactly to get that perfect look. And, they will, unlike many other onion ring recipes. I heated the oil on the stove on med. to the correct temp. with a thermometer. And, I used one x-lg vidalia onion which suprisingly also made 4 side servings!

These are sooo Good! I've made them twice now. The first time was spur of the moment and I didn't have time to dip it in the breading so I mixed the breadcrumbs into the batter and they were really tasty but not crunchy. Second time I gave myself lots of time and did each step and included a lot more spices like garlic powder, paprika ,  cayenne pepper and they were so crunchy and spicy and De-Lish! Just as good , if not better than I've had in restaurants.

I have to say that I have never had a crispier onion ring.  I used the Panko bread crumbs and I am sure that made the difference.  There was not enough flavor, though.  The next time I make these I will add 2-3 teaspoons of seasoned salt into the flour.  I think it will give more even flavor than sprinkling it on after.  All-in-all a great recipe.

***I have looked and looked for a good "CRISPY" batter/bread coating. This one is great. Made the onion rings & zucchini strips with hamburgers last night. Not too greasy as well. The only recommendation I would make is to add a little bit of seasoning without extra salt. :)

We have a local restaurant which my husband loves to visit just for their onion rings! They are made without the bread crumbs and they don't drain the batter off the onion rings....greasy but delicious with a big fat cheeseburger!

Fab! Absolutely delicious! Made them to the recipe and they turned out perfect. My boyfriend also loved them and suggested putting cajun spice into the flour mixture so I will try that next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you so much.  A japanese restaurant served onion rings like these and when they went out of business, I couldn't find them anywhere else.  We use Panko breading and these are our all time favorite onion rings.  It's become a frequent staple at our house.

The crust was very crispy while the inside was soft but the best part was that it was not oily like most onion rings :) very delicious and easy to make.  Thank you.

These are really good; but they take longer to prepare and make then suggested.  Also I usually end up using double the bread crumbs which I make by putting the heels of a loaf of bread into the small food processor.   Add some spices in that mix and yum!  We really enjoy these ...   Even my (super-picky)sister-in-law who is insisting on an invite the next time these are on the menu

This is by far the best onion ring recipe i have come across. I loved the texture but they could of used a little more salt and some garlic powder. I also prefer more onion in mine so I used two pieces of onion in each ring instead of just one..    Other than that, perfect...  Its a little messy but well worth it.

After adjusting the temp they came out well. We used a white wheat flour and it still turned out extremely delicious! This was our first time frying and I used a deep pan on the stove. We are planning to perfect these and try other veggies too!

A good recipe - I think the key is making good bread crumbs ahead of time (I forgot).  We did one batch with old corn bread and another with white bread.  Also, I need to figure out a way to spice them up.

I didn't have an egg or the bread crumbs, but my boyfriend really REALLY wanted onion rings...so I went ahead anyways. I also added about 2 tsp of Hungarian paprika and some fresh gound black pepper and they were DELICIOUS!

There is a serious problem with the recipe, if you make it for other people you will not be able to stop snacking on them yourself before you are done. They are so good! I spiced mine up a bit, they had rave reviews.  They were a nice balance of crispy and doughy.

These were great. I didn't change anything, maybe next time I'll take some of the advice from the other reviewers but "as is" its perfect and doesn't even need anything else.   I made them today...and yesterday. lol. I used regular bread crumbs and one SMALL onion goes a long way (at least for me, I only cook for 2 people) But we still ate them all.   I couldn't find my wire rack so I just used paper towerls and it worked perfect, in my opinion. Easy clean up.

I loved them! They were crisp and crunchy and perfect!!! My family loved them too! It sort of took a long time to make, but I say that it was well worth it! It was not greasy and light. I used sweet onions and plain bread crumbs. Although they were fantastic, I found that when rolling the wet onion rings in the bread crumbs, there were parts of the ring that was missing bread crumbs. But that was not a big set back. I loved them!!!! :)

These are sooo good!! A little bit time consuming but definitely worth it, I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs because that's all I had here so I didn't bother with the seasoned salt but they were awesome!!

So crunchy!  I used panko.  Definitely make sure you season the breadcrumbs really well.  Seasoning the buttermilk isn't a bad idea either.

As the poster of this recipe, I'm very pleased with all of the comments and suggestions made over the years. I especially like all the time saving tips such as using a bag to coat the rings and a tupperware for the crumbs. I also tried baking them as suggested, but I prefer them fried. Thanks everyone for trying this recipe!

Great recipe!! Used panko crumbs as some suggested and turned out great--really crispy and delicious. Yes, onion rings were a bit messy but worth it in the end. Serve very hot and with ranch dressing dipping sauce.

This was great. I double breaded the onion rings because I love the extra crunch. Next time I'll try the recipe as is or maybe with panko bread crumbs. Served with "Cheddar Bacon Hamburgers" with "Belles Hamburger Buns," "Pineapple Carrot Salad," and "Mom's Coleslaw."

My step father had a craving for onion rings, I found this recipe, and figured I would give it a shot.  They came out pretty good for it being my first time making them.  The taste was spot on, but the coating didnt stay on too well.  I will be trying these again!

Very nice. I did make one mistake, I used panko bread crumbs and got them wet from the batter. Because of that the bread crumbs didn't stick. Next time, I'll have to take more time, and only do a few at a time instead of rushing it. Also, I would like to bake them too just to see.

The best recipe for onion rings, hands down. I made the recipe exactly as described and they stayed crispy even after cooling down. Never got soggy. A little salt sprinkled on them after coming out of the oil and yum!

This was very authentic to the restaurant/pub style onion ring.  They were a bit bland though.  Next time I will add some spices.  I also used the plastic bag technique, but the coating didn't adhere very well.  They need to sit a bit for the coating to stick.

I will NEVER eat onion rings out again!  These are SO much better than my fave at a national drive in chain.  I used vidalia onions.  I think I may add a smidge of vanilla next time to the batter to give it a sweeter taste.

It's a messy endeavor but well worth it! I loved how quickly they fried up -- I'd recommend battering & breading them ALL before you start frying.  My guests oohed & aahed and thought they were better than any restaurant they'd had, saying:  1. light & crispy,  2. held up well even after they cooled,  3. the onion never slipped out of the breading.  I will definitely make these again. Rave reviews!

Cut ours to 1/2" wide. The crunch and texture were great! I do however agree with some other reviewers, some additional spice/flavor in the batter would be good. We cooked ours outside. Used a rack from the oven held up by beer cans on the deck to do the flouring and battering. When done, hose off deck, worked great, no mess.

These are very good.  I used buttermilk (it took a little more than a cup because of the thickness), plus added garlic powder and paprika to the flour.  I was very pleased with how the batter stuck to the onion, even when it went into the oil (I used others' suggestions of cutting them thicker.  1/2 inch worked great for me).  I do have a hard time with waste, so instead of letting the rings sit while batter drips off them, I held them up with a fork and just scraped excess off back into the bowl.  The kids raved about them.  We even have some left for lunch tomorrow.  I'll probably warm them in the oven to make them crispy again.

I followed some advice in another review and used panko crumbs that I had put through a small food processor. I served them with a copy cat recipe for outback dipping sauce...and they were a HUGE hit with my family!

I absolutely love onion rings, I live on an island and I haven't had Sonic's onion rings for 3 years. OMG these were so good and they do taste a lot like Sonic's onion rings. I bought plain bread crumbs to make these with I made them a couple of times. With the last batch I accidently used parmesan flavored crumbs they were so delicious. Thanks for sharing.

I made these for Father's Day lunch and my husband loved them. I used the Panko bread crumbs, and seasoning salt, rather than regular salt. Everyone loved them and I got nothing but compliments. I also used buttermilk rather than regular milk, it is thicker and the batter holds on better. The only suggestion I have is to buy more breadcrumbs. We had more onion rings and ran out of the crumbs.

Excellent!!!!  I just finish making them.  The only problem that I had was that I kept eating them as they came out.  I am going to make another batch in a bit to serve with dinner tonight. I also made the blooming onion dipping sauce from this site which was great.

So crunchy and yummy!  We didn't have any bread crumbs, so we pulverized pretzels in the blender and sifted to remove coarse and large pieces.  The "pretzel powder" stuck to the onion rings well and fried up super crunchy and delicious.  We also decreased the salt in the recipe by half, since we used salted pretzels.  Love the results!

These were great. There the way I like them if I get them out. I used all the ingredients, followed the steps of dipping, but I didn't measure. Just put the ingredients in three different pie plates. Then seasoned them. Will be making again.

I don't usually eat onion rings. But I was craving them so I came upon this recipe and I made it. IT WAS AMAZING! It was soooo good. I couldn't stop. I soaked the onions in ice water to get rid of the strong oniony taste. I used Itailian style bread crumbs. They were amazing i'm definately trying this recipe again

Finally, my search for the best onion ring recipe is over!  These were just fantastic- I served it with the Blooming Onion dipping sauce from this site, and it was a match made in heaven! I'll be trying this with Vidalia onions next time and bet it will be even better, if that's possible!

This is the way I remember Onion Rings from when I was a kid.  These are not the same ole Pub Grub that comes out of the bottom of a box on the floor of a freezer somewhere...these are the real deal!  Crunchy, delicious!

These were fabulous!! I've never made onion rings at home like this! I didn't have a deep fryer, so I just put 2" or so of oil in my pot and used my digital probe thermometer to test the temp of the oil on the stove top. Crisp and crunchy and well worth the effort! :)

If I could give more stars I would.  The kids LOVED this recipe, as did I.  I wouldn't change a thing about it, but I did substitute because I didn't have bread crumbs, so I crushed up Ritz crackers and used them instead.  They were very good.

These rings were awesome!!  I added some season salt and garlic pepper to my bread crumbs for a little extra.  I like that this batter didn't cover up the taste of the onion. These are also not as greasy as a thick batter that asorbs all of the grease.

I am soooo glad that I found this recipe.  My sons and I are having a deep fried day.  These are the best onion rings I have ever had.  They are well worth the time and effort it takes to make them.  We liked the inner rings best.  I left the inner 3 rings intact and they were almost juicy.  Yummy!!!!

This is the best onion ring recipe I have ever tasted.  The only ingredient I chose to alter it with is using Panko (Japanese-style) breadcrumbs.

These are the best onion rings in the world! YUM! Well worth that hell of a mess they made. I didn't have enough bread crumbs so I combined them with pretzels. And also added cayenne pepper and garlic powder. Fantastic!

TERRIFIC! Thank you so much for this recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I used with other veggies as well and found them to be just as delicious. Can't wait to serve these at the next football party.

OMG these were AWESOME! Even my 14 year old nephew who HATES onions tried these and loved them.  They were a bit messy but having read the other reviews (should have done that first I guess, LOL) I will use the suggegsted shortcuts the next time I make these.  Oh and i didn't have seasoned salt so I added a bit of paprika and chili powder to the flour mix.  Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe!!

Very easy and very, very good!  If anyone doesn't like this, they had to do something wrong.

Making your own bread crumbs is as easy as putting a few slices of bread into a food processor.  Add very little season salt because it takes very little or your onion rings could end up salty.

Why buy onion rings when you can make them for cheap!  And, better tasting!!

This onion rings are awesome. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and instead of frying them I baked them in the oven on 350 for like 30 minutes. I just sprayed a lot of pam on them. Also I didn't have baking powder so I just left it out and they were great without it. Can't wait to make them again. Was well worth the effort

Yummy!  I added Tony Chachere's creole seasoning to the mix, it added a little zip!  My husband loved them, they may be in the weekly rotation.  As others suggested I used ziplock bags-made it a little less messy.

This is an excellent recipe for onion rings.  They came out very crisp-which was exactly what I was looking for.  Next time I will add spices to the flour and maybe beer instead of milk, as one reviewer said.

A huge hit with my family!  I only had Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, and no seasoned salt, and these were still wonderful.  The texture was great, and the cooking time and temperature was perfect.

Excellent recipe. These were easy to make and had great flavor. I used "french fry seasoning" for the salt in both the flour and the breadcrumb mixture. I will definitely be making these again! Thanks for the great recipe!

These take quite a bit of work and time, but they're worth it. I've made these a few times now. I don't have a wire rack, so I just lay them on aluminum foil. Mine aren't as pretty as the ones with a wire rack probably would be, but they're tasty just the same. This is one of few recipes I make exactly as written, simply because I can't think of anything that would improve the existing recipe :)

Outstanding onion rings, will be making them again, and again. I added 2 tsp of baking powder as a current recipe for them quite similiar in local paper called for more. I had some left over and just left them on a plate on the table overnight, they, amazingly enough were great cold.  Have invited nieces over for an onion ring pigout.

Although it is time consuming, these were great.  My husband was surprised at how well they turned out.  We seasoned them with cajun seasoning, seasoned salt, garlic salt, salt and pepper.  Very, very good.

this is probabally the best recipie out there for fried onion rings. it is great the way it is, but for some added flavor, i crush garlic begal rounds, their already toasted, come in these really big bags, anyway, and layry's seasonsalt, thats always a good choice for seasonings!..also another note if you are deep frying them it helps to turn them so its golden and crunchie on both sides! but either way these are some great onion rings!

I am looking for a flakier texture, I am not big into bread crumb coating, but these were reaaly good.  What makes them so good is the flavor, lots of it.  I have tried a few onion ring recipes from this site and so far this beats them all.  Thank you!

Excellent recipe, and even a medium-sized onion makes a LOT.  I par-fried these before giving them a final frying, as I usually do with fried foods, but won't be doing that again--the onions were cooked perfectly and the breading had a light, crisp texture after the first fry.  The only change I would advise making is to add a LOT more spice to the batter. I added the teaspoon of salt  and a total of another couple of tablespoons of spices (parsley and oregano, onion and garlic powder, cayenne, paprika, and black pepper), but I felt that the flavor of the rings was pretty bland.  After frying the rings, I sprinkled another couple of tablespoons of the spices on the onion rings.  My husband doesn't usually care much about food, but he loved these.

I made these last week and I was so proud of myself.  This was my first time deep frying something and they turned out beautiful.  The only thing I didn't have was the baking powder, but obviously that didn't matter.  I served them with crab cake po-boys.  Yummy!!

Awesome.  Just what I was looking for, definitely restaurant quality.  Time consuming and messy, but worth it! Followed recipe exactly, don't feel it needs any extra seasoning. Served with homemade Honey Mustard Dressing from this site.

I love this recipe. I use sweet onions and cut into petals instead of rings. To add kick to these I put jalepeno slices in the batter and deep fry those at the same time.

I have made these twice in the past week.  We are now into football season so I am always looking for new things to make.  These take a little longer to make but are worth every minute!  I adjust the spices a bit...I put in paprika, garlic salt and use Italian bread crumbs. Thanks for a great recipe!

The breading didn't stick as well as other said it would.  Was it my fat free milk?  I'll try again.  Either way, what did stick, ended up really good.

I used Italian bread crumbs and added some parmesan cheese to them. Yum!

Wow! They taste like Burger King onion rings. Coworkers could hardly believe they were homemade! Thanks Jean!

this is the most amazing onion ring recipe i have ever eaten. normally when you make onion rings after you finish frying them there are bare spots but not with this recipe, you have crust all away around.

Recipe was easy, not too messy and delicious!!  Added just a little more milk to the batter to thin and to save time I didn't drain them on a rack. I just went from the batter to the bread crumbs to the fryer and they turned out great! Adding a little dried Quaker Oats to the bread crumbs was a good touch as well.  Served them with homemade hidden valley ranch which is a favorite in our house.  I will definitely make these again, everyone loved them!

These were great and really easy to make. I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour and I didn't use bread crumbs. It seemed to balance out well, the batter was a little thick, but a little extra milk fixed that problem.

This is EXACTLY like that drive in restaurant your talking about up in Canada! I live in the states now and have missed these onion rings. I can't believe I can have them when I want to! 
It is alot of prep work but it is worth it in the end. Like another reviewer, I only had seasoned bread crumbs but it turned out great! AWESOME recipe! Thanks soooo much for sharing, I'm grateful!

Takes some time and makes quite a mess, but the results are really very good! Super crunchy. I tried it with zucchini, too! I would add some extra salt and garlic for future zucchini batches. Definitely a keeper!

Wow,these were really good. Messy, but well worth it. Used garlic and herb breadcrumbs instead of plain. Kept everything else the same.

These onion rings were so easy to put together!  I had to turn the heat down a little to keep them from burning before they were done on the inside.  I also dusted with garlic powder in addition to the seasoning salt for a little more flavor.  I think that next time I will use a stronger tasting onion or leave two rings together on each one (as someone else suggested)to get more onion flavor coming through.

Great recipe.  Thanks.  I changed a few things, not major, but I didn't let the onions drain on a rack before dunking them in the bread crumbs.  I also seasoned my bread crumbs very well with whatever I felt like, garlic powder, pepper, season salt.  I tasted the crumb mixture before I started dunking the rings, but it was delicious and I didn't have to season them after the fry.

This recipe was great. We made perfect onion rings at home.  The only drawback was that it took a little more time than I thought, it has alot of steps.  The results were delicious though!
