These waffles were delicious!  Just a little crunch from the cornmeal and chia seeds and  a subtle cornmeal flavor.  I just got a new waffle iron, so this was its test run, and it was a successful one.  I could totally see folding some crisp bacon into this recipe's batter.  I did half a recipe, and the servings was spot on, four.  If you're a fan of the Southern favorite, Chicken and Waffles, this would be the perfect waffle!  Thanks darthotto for sharing your recipe.

These waffles were good. I substituted coconut oil for canola and used coconut milk instead of milk. I used a little milk at the end to get the right consistency for the mixture.

The cornmeal is a great crunch addition. To reduce the calorie count further, I replaced the oil with vanilla Greek yogurt and reduced the milk slightly to compensate for the extra moisture yogurt would bring. I didn't separate the eggs but instead added a pinch of cream of tarter when I whisked the whole egg in hopes that would retain the fluffiness. Both substitutions worked beautifully, and definitely a keeper recipe!!

Excellent waffles, but I learned that it is not necessary to separate the egg whites. I just add whole eggs to the liquid ingredients. Came out fine.
