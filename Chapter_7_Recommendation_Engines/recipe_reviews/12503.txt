All I can say is WOW!!!  I made this recipe for Purim.  One of the traditions for the celebration is to eat lots of beans, seeds, and nuts to represent the vegetarian diet Queen Esther may have eaten while in the palace, as meat would not have been prepared properly for her consumption.  I was looking for a new bean recipe to serve during the celebration and came across this.  I was extremely interested in this strange recipe, so tried it.  I told the family it was pie suprise.  It was devoured.  Even the children loved it; and when I told everyone what it was they thought it was they were amazed.  Very tastey (tastes sorta-kinda like pecan pie.  Go figure!) and so easy to make.  Note: I do not beleive this recipe is Kosher per se, but with minor adjustment to the ingredients it could  become so.  Since initially trying this my children have requested it twice!!!  It is definately a keeper.

Wow, I'm not sure how to rate this recipe.  It was so different from anything I've ever cooked.  I used leftover beans which wasn't a good idea because they had been seasoned and you could taste that seasoning in the pie.  We had a blast laughing at everyone trying to guess the "secret" ingredient.  No one even came close to guessing there were beans in it.  My grandmother was the only one who really liked the pie, everyone else was hung up on the fact that it was made with pinto beans.  But I may actually make this again someday with fresh UNSEASONED beans.  But overall, the pie was very pretty, set up nice, and looked a lot like a pecan pie.  I sprinkled pecans on the top of mine before I baked it.  I really think using my leftover beans is what made my pie taste strange.  Thanks for sharing such an interesting recipe.  So, I give it 4 stars for looks, fun, and the hope that unseasoned beans will make all the difference in the taste!

Way too sweet, and an unappealing color.  My family didn't like this, and they didn't even know there were beans in it. If you cannot resist trying this recipe, please cut the ingredients  in half to make only one pie and sample it in small doses. I did like that it was made with on hand ingredients.

The flavor was good but the texture was lacking. Too gooey not solid enough.

This definitely has the appeal of a pecan pie. Delicious! Mine made a pretty custardy crust on top. The recipe was not quite enough to fill up my two 9" pie dishes, though. I will likely make this again, adding a bit more mashed beans for filler.

Too much sugar.  The taste was pretty good. Liked the use of beans. The texture is not all that appealing. Iwill make this pie again...  I would cut the portions of sugar, slightly reduce the amount of butter and coconut. Did add a little bit of molasses for more flavor.
