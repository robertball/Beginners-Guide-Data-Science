My family loves this recipe.  I added more garlic and I diced the prosciutto. I also used diced tomatos and added some sugar to cut the acidity. I add diced onions for addition favour.  I simmered the dish  after adding the tomato products for 2 hours before adding the cream and this blended the flavours better.

This was pretty bad.  I didn't add the prosciutto, but I can't imagine that it would help.  It seems like a tad bit much vodka in this recipe, most others only use 1/4 or 1/3 cup vodka.

This is a really good sauce to play with, and add or take away what you like.  I used Fire roasted diced tomato and garlic. (new from Hunts) reduced the vodka to 1/2 c. did NOT add water, and fresh grated parm.  Also, I served it over 3 cheese tortellini. OMG! Delicious.

Shame on you, NDULAK! You leave out the KEY ingredient, prosciutto, and complain about how bad it was! That's like leaving the tomatoes out of tomato soup and complaining that the soup is awful. Please people, prepare the recipe as written the first time. THEN write your review. THEN go ahead and make your changes. You then can submit it as a new recipe. So often here, the reviews are so drastically different from the original recipe that there is virtually no resemblance to the original. Again, shame on you, NDULAK!

I tried this recipe without the prosciutto, because it's too salty for my taste.  The sauce was delicious!!  The alcohol evaporated well enough that we couldn't taste it, but it still enhanced the flavors of the other ingredients.  I think next time I'll use less water to keep the sauce thicker.

Delicious! I used pancetta instead of prosciutto because I already had it. I also left out the water and used 2 28 oz. cans of crushed San Marzano tomatoes and let it reduce a bit. The biggest change I made was to use 1 can of evaporated milk instead of cream and add in 3/4 cup of grated Romano cheese at the end. Yum!

We are going to play with this a little more, but, as a basic, its terrific.
I changed it to 2 servings, and it made ......3.  I used fresh Romano cheese, and my wife wished I'd have used dry parm....  I blended it in the pan to smooth it a little, used no water and 15 oz tomato sauce to 15 oz, diced tomatoes. Added a smidge of sugar.
I had this sauce recently in a las vegas hotel and it was so smooth...... and in denver, its very chunky.  we likw the smooth texture a
lot better.

LOVED this recipe!  i didn't add the can of water, I like the sauce a little thicker.  I did add some parmesan on the plate, and that was a great addition.  I like it spicy, so 1/2 tsp pepper flakes was great, but if you're serving this for a crowd, maybe cut back the pepper flakes a little.  Roma tomatoes do make a big difference.  I didn't use fresh herbs, wonder how much better that would have been?? Terrific sauce, went awesome with penne.  Mangia!

Grade A+ sauce. The amount of prosciutto makes this a costly recipe though. It's well worth the cash for a special treat.

Absolutely wonderful, make sure you use a good vodka for it. If you want to skip the soaking your vodka in red peppers you can certainly get away with using a pepper vodka.

I made this as the sauce and served with grilled scallops for the first night, then over pasta the second night, and as a dipping sauce with bread the third night.  My husband loves it so much he thinks I should can this sauce and give away as gift!  I skipped the prosciutto and garlic and followed the rest of the recipe.  This recipe is delicious!

I love vodka sauce and was excited to try this. I did not care for it! All I could taste was vodka. I added more of my homemade sauce and a ton of pancetta to make it  palatable. Next time, I'll halve the vodka.

This was delicious and very easy.  I omit the roma tomatoes, I use to cans of tomato sauce. The prosciutto adds flavor without "chunks" (a concern for my kids).

A good start, but needs some tweaks. Poster was not kidding when he said it would be spicy. Also, the prosciutto overpowered a lot of the flavors. When I make it again, I'm going to cut the amount of prosciutto and red pepper in half and add a 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese after the cream.

This is a great basic vodka sauce recipe.  I change it up a little bit to add some more flavor- mainly, I use italian sausage instead of pancetta or some sort of ham product, which adds an extra spicy kick, which i sauteed with some diced onion before adding all the other ingredients.    I also use whole peeled tomatoes and crush them for a chunkier sauce.

I thought this recipe was outstanding.  I used 1/2 pound of proscuitto and it was plenty.  My only addition was about 1/2 cup of finely minced onion sauteed with the proscuitto.  I was tempted to increase the amount of red pepper flakes as my family enjoys spicy food.  I'm glad I didn't.  Pefect as is!  So much tastier than many vodka sauce recipes.  A definite keeper!

Made this about 5 times. Always a big hit with my family. I personally add a little grated parmesan cheese into the sauce while it's heating up. It adds a nice little flavor.

Great recipe.  Although it needs to cook longer than 15 minutes to thicken up.  I cook it about an hour then add the cream.  Enjoy

Wow!! Easy and good!  I used all the vodka and all the pepper flakes.  I did not have any heavy cream but I used whole milk and non-dairy creamer.  OMG faux-paux but it worked.  I can't wait until I have real cream..YUM I served it over meat stuffed shells.

I have used this recipe about 4 times now, and it is consistently excellent. I always use the proccuitto because it provides the rich, deep flavor. The chili flakes in the vodka add just the right amount of spice. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good sauce! I didn't have tomato paste, so I didn't add the water, and the consistency was pretty good. I used Muir Glen fire-roasted diced, and I liked the texture, but pureeing it would have been good, too. I skipped the prosciutto, and 1 tsp pepper would have been a bit much; 3/4 was just right for us, with a 4 y.o.

I REALLY liked this, especially the way it made the whole house smell while cooking.  It was a bit salty though, so do NOT season with any extra.

I took the advice of others, I used less cream.  I added more garlic and prosciutto to the mix. I let the vodka reduce a little then added the sauce. It came out terrific.

Like many others, I did not follow this recipe exactly. But, I stuck as close to it as I could given the ingredients in my pantry & fridge. I actually didn't have any tomato sauce, so I just used a large can of crushed tomatoes, and I thought it still turned out great! I also subbed bacon (just a few diced slices) for the prosciutto because I already had it :) Either way - this recipe was so good, I was already planning the next time that I'd make it for friends & family.

Made this tonight and didn't have crushed red pepper but used black pepper instead.  This was another wonderful recipe. But NOTE the vodka pepper mix is supposed to sit for 1 HOUR.  This is not mentioned in the prep time so FYI start with this first so you can let it sit.  We obviously didn't let it sit more than about 15 minutes and only had black pepper in it anyway.  We also had cheap McCormick vodka would love to try with Grey Goose or another better vodka next time around.  I was a bit worried about the amount of vodka but it was not overwhelming in the sauce by any means.  Loved it and had plenty leftover as there was only the two of us for dinner, froze the rest for next time.

This sauce is delicious!  I don't like spicy food, so I omitted the red pepper flakes.  I doubled the can of roma tomatoes, omitted the water, used grey goose, and simmered for an hour.  YUM!

Really excellent!  I'd had vodka sauce at Italian restaurants, but never tried making it myself.  The recipe was simple and accurate.  It was a hit - we also seared some steak to put on top of the pasta and sauce.  A delicious, and decadant, treat.

Fantastic! Was a little worried about the prosciutto, but it was great in the sauce! Made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it! We like spicy in our house so I used the Absolute Peppar Vodka and added a little more crused red pepper. Definitely will make again. Delicious!

This sauce is awesome!  I had never made a real sauce from scratch before, so I was a little scarred.  But it is easy and comes out delicious.  The first time I made this I used chicken instead of the prosciutto.  It was delicious the night I made it, but the chicken did not keep well and after the first day, it was not as good.  I made it again now this time with the prosciutto.  I didn't have chopped, so i got the sliced meat from the deli and just cut it up.  I ended up using about a half a pound tho, and that was more than plenty.  Other changes, I wasn't able to find fresh parsley or basil last minute, so I used dried, and that worked fine as well.  I did not use quite as much tho....  probably about a little more than one table spoon.  And the red pepper flakes, I only used a half a teaspoon and it was still plenty spicy.  I also used a bit more garlic than the recipe called for, but I like things garlicky. One more thing.  I let it cook much longer than the recipe said.  I had it going for probably 2 and a half hours.  I like the sauce nice and thick so I let it reduce down a lot before adding the cream.  It came out much better the longer I had it on.  2 and a half was plenty long enough. This sauce went off great with everyone I gave it to.  I even gave some to a friend who has his own pizza joint/Italian food place(and this is in Brooklyn) and he LOVED it.  So, if i have the Pizza Guy's approval, its probably a good thing. I certainly recommend this recipe!

I'm only giving this 4 stars because of the changes I made: using light cream (crème légère) and chorizo - which is already very spicy - in place of the proscuitto. But otherwise it was an excellent base recipe that I would definitely use again!

This was delicious!! The only thing I did differently was add more garlic and also some onions.  I also left out the water to make the sauce a little thicker.  It was sooooo good my family loved it, definitley a new favorite! UPDATE: This recipe has become a favorite I make it about once every 2 weeks.. we always devour the leftovers the next day! One of the best recipes!

This was delicious!  I didn't have roma tomatoes, so I used 1 lrg can of crushed tomatoes and a 1/2 can of diced.  I added a lot more garlic and a few teaspoons of sugar.  My 2-year-old asked for more and I can't wait for leftovers tomorrow for lunch!!  (UPDATE:  I made this again without the vodka.....it was still good, but the vodka definitely adds some great flavor!!)

Taste was excellent, however the prosciutto was too much... would cut in half next time. Might be too spicy for some. Would also lessen red pepper by 1/4.

Excellent vodka sauce!  I have tried other recipes and we like this one the best.  It does start out a bit watery but once you cook it down it is a very nice consistency and not too thick when you reheat it.

This dish is simple and fantastic! I used all the vodka and reduce the red pepper flakes by half. My husband is a very fussy eater and he can't stop eating it. I served it over mini penne pasta and it really captured the sauce perfectly.

The family enjoyed this recipe immensly.  I also added a bit of sweetex to counteract the acidity and didnt have fresh herbs, so used dried. Chopped some mushrooms and added those for bulk.  Substituted the cream with low fat creme freche.

This turned out very spicy. I only soaked the red pepper flakes for 15 minutes so maybe that was why? I liked it but my husband couldn’t eat it because it was too spicy for him.

Best vodka sauce recipe by far. We’ve compared it to bottled sauces and even high end Italian restaurants and it’s better in my opinion.  We like spice, so we added extra garlic and red pepper flakes.

This recipe is one of our favorites. We don't really like ham and we certainly can't afford prosciutto so I blacken mushrooms with Montreal seasoning. Also, can't figure out what that cup of water is for so I don't add it. Turns out perfect every time.

So I absolutely cannot IMAGINE adding an 8oz can of water to this sauce. It is SO good without and very thin without! The consistency was like soup. That being said, I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use the 3/4lb of prosciutto. I used a 3oz package of prosciutto and then about 1/4lb of bacon. NO WAY could I afford to use nearly a pound of prosciutto! Pancetta would be a good sub too. Prosciutto is a cured meat similar to salame so it's a strange addition (usually eaten "uncooked" since it's cured) but it was super tasty. To the fool who didn't add the prosciutto, YES that was your problem. Did you just pour 1c of vodka into a cold pan? Or did you sautéed chopped parsley, Basil, and garlic by itself? Lol!! When you sautée the prosciutto and basil, parsley, etc together, the pan will then be "hot", and when you add the vodka, it will sizzle and VERY quickly reduce. I probably had 1/4 to 1/3c remaining liquids after the 10 minutes was up. Most of the vodka will evaporate off! I added slightly less red pepper flakes because kids were eating it, and I did purée the whole tomatoes in the blender after the first one I hand crushed splattered all over my clean stove. So my sauce was very thin. ANYWAY. This was delish! Oh yea and I used the cheapest vodka in a plastic bottle :)

I did half a tsp of red pepper flakes, so the kick wasn't white as strong, added a little less than half of a small white onion, and used thinly sliced ham instead of prociuto (our store didn't have any). We also cooked chicken and mixed it into the sauce. This is better than any vodka sauce recipe from any restaurant, and certainly better than the jarred stuff. We have four children and they ALL ate this up! Only complaint (not bad enough to take a star away!) is that the sauce was somewhat thinner than desired. Next time we won't add the cup of water when we put the sauce in.

Great tasting recipe.  I would usggest to add a chopped onion and skip the cup of water at the end to make sauce slightly thicker.

Great starter recipe. Made it twice second time made changes. Didn't add water because I like thicker sauces. Did not use full amount of prosciutto seemed like a lot but did dice it up. And will add onions next time had in another recipe I tried n liked it.

Excellent recipe!  Don't listen to the people that negatively rate this, especially ones that don't add a major component (prosciutto).  I find it essential to use the whole plum tomatoes and crush them right before adding them to the pot.  It changes the consistency of the sauce.  I saute half an onion before I add the prosciutto, and add about 2 cloves of garlic to the recipe. I also let it reduce for about 30-40 mins on a slow simmer to intensify the flavors.  After I cook the pasta to al dente, stain, etc.... I put the pasta back in the vessel I cooked it in, add the sauce, and let the sauce and pasta combine on low heat for about 10 minutes stirring regularly to keep it from sticking.  It's delicious, and everyone I've made it for is either really nice, or loves it.  I'm going with the latter, because they always ask for the recipe....

Very good sauce.  Instead of prosciutto, I added 1-2 t. of bittersweet smoked paprika.  The basil and Italian parsley were from my garden.  I also added about 1/2 c. of grated parmesan while cooking.  My husband also loved it.  This sauce could easily be poured over chicken or other meats or vegetables and baked.  I'll be making it again.

This is my go to Vodka sauce, I've been making it for years. I wont even get it anywhere else because it just isn't as good. I throw the prosciutto, garlic, parsley, basil, salt and pepper into the food processor to break everything up nice and small and use a can of crushed tomatoes instead of doing it myself. I also leave out the 8oz of water. It's got the perfect amount of spice! I LOVE IT!

I love this recipe, my only complaint is that as my first try at them, it has ruined me for other vodka sauces! It's the prosciutto. This is easy and delicious, and the recipe makes a lot, I'd say 6-8 servings and I eat plentiful portions!

Awesome sauce, all will love it, use a good vodka and let sit over night with crushed red pepper flakes, I strain that out prior to adding.

Unless you want to drink your sauce you need to add more tomatoes and less water.  This is like a tomato juice.  It does have very good flavor though.. Needs to be thickened up badly and it will be great.

This ia a terrific sauce. The prosciutto makes the difference, giving a rich meaty flavor. I keep the pepper flakes and vodka at the same level, but skip the salt altogether since the prosciutto brings in enough by itself. I also run it through a blender at the end to smooth it out.

This is fabulous! I doubled it, thinking 4 servings might not be enough. Eight servings left us with enough for two more meals. I didn't use quite as much Prosciutto, just six ounces and about 4 ounces of bacon. My picky 18 year old daughter LOVED it! Saving this recipe to do again.

Great recipe.  Followed the recipe except left out the Prosciutto because my husband gobbled it up before I could use it.  No worries though, the sauce was delicious.  I will be making this again for sure.

I REALLY like this sauce!!  I changed it just a bit due to what I had on hand though.  I used fresh romas from my garden that had been blanched and peeled.  I had like 3 pounds and was gonna do 2 sauces but decided I was too lazy so crushed them all and put them all in this sauce.  equaled 2 28oz cans I believe.  Then I let it simmer and reduce for 2 hours instead of the 15 min the recipe called for then stirred in the cream.  since I used so many tomatoes there wasn;t much heat in this sauce but it still had lots of flavor.  Definitely a special occasion sauce I will make again.

Racquelle, This recipe is absolutely wonderful!!!  I made it just the way you instructed.  We don't like spicy so I just didn't add the crushed pepper.  I am from Italian heritage and it is "tradition" that you let your sauce cook for hours....so that's what I did. (about 3 hours for this sauce)
The aroma filled my entire house!  
Unfortunately, this first pot was for a catering job my husband was doing and so we couldn't eat it!!  But my 5 year old daughter and I were "tasting" it a lot and she loved it so much she wanted me to fill a bowl with it so she could eat it with a spoon!  Needless to say, Today I'm making another batch for us to eat!!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It is easy and very tasty.  If anyone is having trouble with this recipe, I think cooking it longer will enhance the wonderful flavors!  
Racqelle, your recipe was a big hit for the party we catered also!

I love this!  Didn't have any prosciutto so I didn't bother with that. I also didn't put in the water because I thought it would make it too thin.   After it was finished I felt I wanted to add a little sugar to cut the acidity.    Otherwise I made it as written and I love it.  I do not think it is all that spicey and I can't taste the alcohol at all.  After you simmer it for 10 minutes it is reduced dramatically anyway.  This is very easy with ingredients that I had on hand.  What is better than that?

You really can't go wrong with this one. Quick, easy and very tasty! I substituted the prosciutto with pancetta and simmered the vodka 3-4 minutes and the tomatoes about 3 minutes, didn't add the water and cream. It was delicious!

LOVED this recipe and have made it 4 or 5 times now.  I used a little less prosciutto and a little more garlic than called for and 'let the flavours marry' for a few hours.  Delicious.  One of my new staples.

I used an extra large jar of Prego from Sam's club instead of the tomato sauce and can of roma tomatoes along with chopped baby bella mushrooms.  I plan to use half for dinner this week and freeze half for another meal.  Delicious!!!!

VERY good. I substituted diced Italian seasoned tomatoes for the roma tomatoes and added bit bit more garlic.  I also omitted the water and added about 1/4 cup grated romano cheese to the sauce. Serve over penne or your favorite pasta. Delish! This makes a lot, but the recipe is easily halved.

Love it! My family and its picky eaters sat quietly, licking their lips and complementing it all night. I skipped on the water, used evaporated milk rather than the heavy cream as someone suggested, and added about a tablespoon of Adobo and 2 tablespoons of grated romano at the end. I will be making this again but maybe add a bit more romano!

I give this an 11 on a scale of 10!! FAST DISH, easy to make. I added fresh oregano, and 1 shallot minced, and only 1/2 of red pepper flakes. I thought I had enough for leftovers...NOT. I will have to make a double batch next time.

My son loves this pasta sauce. I always make a double batch and freeze half for a quick meal. Has always turned out great.

I substituted ham and salami for prosciutto and it worked wonderfully (not that prosciutto wouldn't be great, but I don't believe it's necessary).  Fantastic recipe overall - definitely a part of my repertoire now.

This sauce never fails me.  I used ham instead and it was so amazing.  Next time I will double the recipe and freeze some for a rainy day.

Yummy!! I used this over rolled up lasagna with sweet italian sausage. very good. Thank you for a great recipe! I may cut back the vodka to 1/2 cup next time as the taste was pretty strong.
