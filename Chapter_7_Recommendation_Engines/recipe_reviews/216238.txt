Made this tohight- great recipe!  Too good to be called meatloaf.  I didn't have any thin deli ham, but used leftover baked ham sliced thin and was delicious.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This recipe was AWESOME (and I don't even like meatloaf)!  Just make sure to put the seam down on your meatloaf roll so it doesn't come apart in the oven like mine.

This is an awesome recipe. Ive never been a big fan of meatloaf. But I gave this a try and fixed it just as described with the following changes: I had no ham so used pepperoni instead. ANd i  added sliced olives. Everyone loved it. I cant wait to try it again.

This was a huge hit. I used homemade bread crumbs, homemade MSG-free onion soup mix, and I added a teaspoon of homemade italian seasoning and half of one chopped yellow onion.  We all liked this a huge deal BUT the topping for us just was too sweet. If I were to make this again, I would leave off the topping. I'm thinking using part pasta/marinara sauce in the meatloaf mix and some served over the top would be good. Or just plain would be good, too. Even with the topping, there were no leftovers. We just ate around the topping.

The meatloaf was moist and delicious!  My husband didn't like the sauce on the top, but he usually doesn't go for "sweet meat" anyways.  Will definitely make it again!

Whoa! This was super rich. I could not abide the combination of beef and ham flavors.  I didn't even finish eating it, and that is unusual for me. Finally, I doubled the topping sauce because the original amount seemed a bit paltry.

Crusty on the outside but tender on the inside. My husband loved the surprise of finding ham and swiss cheese inside the loaf.

Hubby LOVED it! He ate 3/4 of the loaf himself at dinner. Personally, I thought it was a tad salty, so next time I am only going to use half the pouch of onion soup mix, but everything else was great!

This meatloaf was a huge hit! Following some of the suggestions, and lacking swiss cheese, I topped the "meat square" with about 1/3 cup of marinara sauce, pepperoni, and mozzarella cheese, then rolled it up. After baking 45 minutes, I spread marinara sauce on top and finished baking. It was great :) I made oven-roasted red skinned potatoes with it, and they came out of the oven at about the same time. Perfect combination for an easy and delicious dinner!

Loved this juicy, tasty meatloaf!  I had to substitute mozzarella cheese and fresh chopped onion instead of the onion soup mix but it turned out great.  Thanks

Wow. It's been a while since I've found such a solid 5-star recipe!  It tasted amazing despite the fact that I didn't use a brand-name soup mix and chose a so-so quality deli-ham.  I can't wait to make it again with premium ingredients.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I followed reviewer Sarah Jo's advice and substituted plain marinara for the brown-sugar sauce - because I like my meatloaf savoury.
Also, after rolling it up, I also compressed the ends so it would fit into my 1.5qt Pyrex.  Funnily enough I think it benefited from that.

I've made this many times and LOVE it!  There are a few changes i've made such as using 2 lbs of beef or either less of the onion soup mix to reduce sodium.  I suggest using more soy sauce if you find the topping too sweet.  Try with other cheeses such as provolone and meats (bacon, turkey).  Enjoy!!

I don't often make recipes that require a soup packet for seasoning but today I did and this wasn't bad. I didn't use the ketchup topping, finishing the loaf with 8 cut slices of swiss cheese and I'm glad I did  that because a lot of the cheese in the loaf didn't make it despite being very well sealed.

This is a HUGE hit in my house. My family never liked meatloaf until I made this. This is requested at least 2x a month in my house.  My extended family always requests that I make/bring it to parties, etc. (I have made large meatballs using this recipe for appetizers and they were a huge hit)!

Fabulous recipe. Not terribly easy to make, but worth it.
I made it exactly as written. Actually, for the package of onion soup mix, I used another recipe from this site that is supposed to be equivalent to it. This is somewhat decadent, and not very healthy, but tastes wonderful. Even the ketchup-based sauce/glaze on top is different from a run-of-the-mill meatloaf. I highly recommend this recipe.

Amazing!!! My husband and I have been married for seven years and he had yet to like any meatloaf I've tried to make.. until now. Recipe is easy to make and tastes like you have spent hours on it. I didn't have any swiss so I replaced it with Parmesan which worked great and made it a little more true as a Sicilian dish. I was worried about it being too sweet like some of the reviews said, so I carefully brushed the sauce on as a light glaze which my husband said it was the perfect amount of sauce. He told me this is a must have and a new staple. Yay, I finally have a go to meatloaf recipe! Thank you for sharing!

Very tasty. The "Boss" gave me the all clear to make this again. She said it was very tasty. I thought it was tasty. I never like things like this that I make.

Tried the recipe as written and found it to be quite good. With a few changes, however, my family enjoyed it even more. Substituted 6 slices of crumbled bacon for the ham and 4 cheese Italian mix for the Swiss. Added an extra clove of garlic and 1-2 tsps of Italian Seasoning. Also chopped some fresh onion in place of the onion soup. This recipe's been a big hit for me and thanks for posting it.

I just made this tonight I took some of the advice from other reviews, I used real breadcrumbs, I used ground turkey, bacon, and cheddar.  It was really good. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best ever meatloaf. I didn’t have ham but used thinly sliced smoked meat. I also added sliced green olives but will probably try sliced black olives the next time.

Easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly. I had a lot of deli ham left over from when we had people out and looked for a way to use it up. I would make this again.

my mom used to make this when we were kids, but instead of using swiss cheese she used mozzarella cheese with the deli ham and italian seasonings mixed into the meat, topped with slices of Mozzarella cheese triangles. it was and is delicious to  this day.

We made this recipe for 100 people at our local soup kitchen. We used a 1/2 cup scoop and baked them for 25 mins.  We added the sauce to the meat mixture (because someone didn’t read the recipe) and it was delicious. We received many compliments from the clients.

This is really good however I'm not sure of the name, definitely not sicilian. I will make again substituting with prosciutto, provolone, roasted red peppers, and spinach inside and homemade marinara on the top. Great recipe and can be made with many variations.

First,  I used a steak rub and refrigerated my steak.  After reading the reviews, I decided to brush the oil on to the steaks. Then I dragged the steaks through the parmesan (fresh) and the bread crumbs. I skipped the seasoning because of the rub I used. I warmed the broiler pan before putting the steaks on them. 
 They turned out very tasty. I would use the recipe again.

Made this today and it went well. Stayed together perfectly.  I had a large package of ground beef so I made two loaves in order to freeze one. My son loves linguine so I gave it to him over linguine with tomato sauce. He even ate his veggies. A little slice is more than enough for me. Wasnt near as labor intensive as I thought it would be. Love my ninja to mix the meat (using the dough setting).

Sadly my husband and I did not like this at all. I have tried many meatloaf from this site and so far this was our least favorite. The ham only detracted from the flavor and the topping was too sweet. I made as written. Sorry wasnt for us. We threw most of it away.

Holy cow this was delicious!  I split the 1 1/2 lbs of meat into part beef and part Italian sausage. .. other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Can't wait to make it again!
