This recipe ROCKS!!  I made it for out office as an alternative to coffee.  There are 7 of us and the recipe will  fill a large crock pot, the oval kind you can fit ribs in.  Well the 7 of us killed off the 35 servings the straight recipe will produce.  (NOTE: put in the cloves LAST.  Cloves when steeping have a time limit.  When they steep for too long they'll make the wassail, or whatever they're steeping in, bitter!!)

Move over mulled cider. This has taken its place at our annual Christmas party. I used cider instead of apple juice, and used just 1 cup of lemon juice so it would be a little sweeter. It was a hit, and fun to serve something "steeped" in tradition. :)

This will be my third year to make this recipe and it receives the best compliments ever.  We just love it.  I originally found the recipe to make for a warm Holiday punch to sell at a Christmas High School Band Concert, I must admit most people did not know what Wassail was but it has caught on rapidly -- people now ask if we are going to have it.

The best! Try adding red wine... after this was finished simmering I put 1/2 in a pitcher for the kids, and added a whole bottle of cabernet sauvignon to the rest for the adults. A real treat!

This is a great recipe for the holidays.

If you want to add a little pizazz to the presentation, add a few sliced oranges, lemons and limes to the serving bowl.  I insert whole cloves into an apple and let that float as well.

Excellent!  It was a big hit with guests at our open house.  It was very sweet so I may reduce the sugar next time.

I've been making a version of this recipe for the last 3 years & it's always a favorite.  I play around with the juice proportions a bit & now add 2 C of pineapple juice & only 1 C of lemon juice.

Our family and friends really enjoyed this - I had never tried wassail but wanted to.  One comment was made that it tasted just like a holiday drink in Germany.  I kept it warm in a crock pot - well, actaully it needed several!  Lion House recipes really are good!

Excellent Wassail. A friend of mine made some awesome Wassail last year and This beat it!. I left out the Ginger Root and it was fantastic. We let everyone spike it with Rum themselves. Great easy recipe.

This recipe was pretty good.  You can make it alittle easier, by wrapping the spices in cheese cloth before adding them.  You won't have to strain the recipe before serving.  Other than that, follow the recipe as given.  It's good, but it's sweet.

We love this for the holiday season.  We like to add 1oz+ of Maker's Mark bourbon to a mug of it.  The flavors blend perfectly, and it's that much warmer :-)

Excellent Wassail!  I made this for about 30 people and they all raved about it!  We dipped biscotti in it and it was to die for!

My favoite recipe so far.  I did not have the allspice berries or the whole cloves on hand so I substitued 2 tblspn of pumpkin pie spice.  It tasted wonderful.  Oh, I also put a shot of spiced rum in it sometimes!

Very good recipe. I left out the ginger root and used Splenda instead of sugar...plus a little spiced rum made it just a little bit better! :)

I love this so much, I serve it year-round!  My changes:  add 1/2 T balsamic vinegar, 1/4 c brown sugar (no white), 2 c water [or more], 1 L. cinnamon stick-broken up, minced ginger root, 3 T lime juice, 1 c peach juice, apple cider [Organic 946 ml is awesome] instead of apple juice, 3 T honey, a bunch of orange zest, more allspice, more cloves, 2 oranges juiced into the pot and add the empty halves, quartered-squeezed-scored lemons; it's different every time...  at Christmas, mandarin oranges, halved, squeezed and deeply scored go in ,too.  The floating fruit makes it more festive, and the daring can sip it unstrained to get luscious bits of pulp.

This Wassail recipe was delicious, but if you'd like a stronger spicy cinnamon flavor I add "Hot Tamales or Red Hots" which are hard candy that will dissolve in the mix as you boil. The result is great and you can substitute the sugar and cinnamon measurement with this candy, two in one. Enjoy!

Yes, this recipe is very sweet, but a hot sweet drink really hits the spot after a heavy holiday dinner. If you want less sweet, add a little less sugar and a tad more ginger root, leaving the ingredients (cinnamon, etc) to simmer a bit longer and release more flavor. It gives the drink some extra kick; however, I prefer the original recipe. Happy Holidays, everyone!

This is a good start - I add a lot more spices than it calls for - even punch a whole orange with whole cloves and throw it in the pot.  A slow cooker on low is the perfect place to let the flavors come alive.

This recipe is WAAAAAAAY sweet.  It reminded me of Jolly Rancher candies.  If you can envision drinking Jolly Ranchers in liquid form, and you think you would like it, then you would like this recipe.  VERY SWEET and VERY TART.

I made this for a group this weekend. It is excellent. Received many compliments.
 I also have had 4 people call me for the recipe -since because they want to serve it. 
It is sweet--but that is what  many liked instead of being  very tart as many spiced ciders are.

Very good.  I added a couple of things.  A small can of mandrin oranges add a wonderful flavor and I also dissolve 1/8 cup of cinnamon imperials.  This adds a beautiful red color and a slight spicy taste to it.  This is one the kids love to help with because they can pour all the ingrdients in before you add to the heat.  I also cut back on the cloves as I added plenty of spice with the candies. 

Great for any winter night!

Way too sour!! I steeped the water, sugar and spices together for an hour, then added rest of ingredients into a crock pot. It smelled good, but the taste is way off. I would not add any lemon juice (or just a 1/2 cup) if I make again. I ended up taking out 4 cups of the liquid and replacing it with 4 cups of warmed apple cider. It was still just OK and company didn't drink much.

This has been a hit every time I make it. I skip the orange juice and use half the lemon juice and add 4 cups of cranberry raspberry cocktail instead. I use a little less of everything to fit it in my large crockpot and I just pour the sugar/spice syrup in there and then add all the other juices and a little water to make it less potent. Then I float some cinnamon sticks and orange and lemon slices in it to make it look festive!

This was yummy!  I usually cut this recipie in half, as that is enough for my family of four.  I have made it twice using apple cider both times and I also leave out the ginger.  Love it.  This will become a holiday staple!

I made this and the only change was letting the spice bag steep after adding the juices. Be sure to remove the bag after about a quarter of the wassail is consumed, or the spices become overwhelming. (We fixed it by adding more apple and lemon juice.) It was so well liked at Christmas Eve I made it again for New Year's.

I added only about 1 3/4 cup of sugar (instead of the over 2 cups called for) and this was PERFECT.   Also, I used candied ginger (about a half tablespoon) I chopped up instead of ginger root.

I love this wassail! Perfect combination of flavors. I didn't have ginger root so I used 1/4 tsp of ground ginger.

Very good and traditional tasting. Had a bit of a problem with the "lemon juice" though. Is that lemon juice or lemonade? Big difference. My first batch could burn a hole in a dirty toilet bowl with the aggressive acidity.

I made this for Christmas. It was FABULOUS! I made it in a crockpot and kept it warm all that day. It made the house smell great! Try his recipe, you will be pleased. Even if it not exactly what you want to start off it is so easy to tweak this recipe. Very, very good. Thanks for submitting.

A big hit with all who have tried it! I like to make a half recipe for just me. I also like to add a little more spice than it calls for--the sweetness of the juice can be a bit much.
