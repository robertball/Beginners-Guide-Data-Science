Excellent marinade! My husband and I loved it! I didn't have tahini, so I subbed 2 Tbsp. of sesame oil which worked great. I also used 1/4 cup of Splenda for the white sugar and low sodium soy sauce. I cut the chicken into chunks for kabobs and let it marinate about 8 hours. Boy, was this ever good! It has a sweet, oriental flair to it and is "Absolutely Addictive". It's great paired with steamed broccoli, carrots, baby corn and rice.

My word, what a magnificent flavor this marinade did bring to my grilled vegetables on the Fourth of July. I made the marinade in a big bowl, tossed in peppers, onions, broccoli, etc., and allowed them to marinate for about 4 hours. Then I placed the vegetables and some of the marinade in a foil packet and put them onto the grill. The only fireworks display nicer than the one in the sky was the one this marinade brought to my tastebuds. God bless America!

The best I've ever had.  If you don't have Tahini (Sesame paste), Sesame oil works well too.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This was an excellent marinade with a sweet taste.  Best meat I ever had.  My friends and I made it for a cookout at school.  Those of you wondering what tahini is, it's ground up sesame seed, also known as sesame butter.  You can't find it at a normal grocery store, so try the local import store - it's a Middle Eastern thing (or if you're feeling bold, grind up some sesame seeds).  Dehydrated onions work fine for the onions.  The tahini smells nasty, just make sure that the marinade smells somewhat sweet and your meat will taste sweet.  We also added a pinch of oregano.  Excellent!

I was planning on using this recipe for my daughters birthday party but being the skeptic that I am I wanted to taste test it first. It was great! Even my five year old commented how good it was. I used the marinade for london broil and heated up the reserved marinade and poured over the meat with sauteed mushrooms. Surprisingly I found the tahini in the kosher section of the supermarket. I am definitely making this for the party!

This marinade was the perfect change to our family's boring ones.  Not only is the resulting taste really good, but it makes meat very soft.  It works well with beef fajita and beef sirloin steaks, meats that matter the most when they're tender.  Don't marinate for more than a day, though, or the meat doesn't come out as juicy or soft. Even the pickiest members of the family liked this marinade (myself included)!

Another WOWWWWW!! I marinated both Chicken Breasts and Eye of Round Steak.  Both were fantastic!  I am sure the leftovers will taste good for sandwiches.   I didn't have tahini - so I just used about 2 tablespoons of sesame oil.  I thought the flavor was like the very best teriyaki I could imagine.  I heated up the extra marinade and we served it over the meat.  We all oooood and awed.

We really enjoyed this marinade for something different.  I did, however, make a few changes (due to what I had on hand):  left out the green onions, used chunky peanut butter instead of tahini, and added a heaping tablespoon of chile garlic paste.  I marinated tri-tip steak in it for about 8 hours and grilled it.  Also took the remaining marinade, boiled it, and used it as a sauce for the cooked steak.  Thanks for the recipe!

I approached this recipe with a "why not?" attitude: I had some chicken breasts to marinate and was looking for something new. This did not disappoint! What a wonderful and unique blend of flavours! Perfect, perfect, perfect! I grilled these and then cut them into strips to serve over a mesclun salad drizzled with olive oil, a splash of balsamic vinegar and then mixed with paper-thin slices of red onion, cucumber, cherry tomatoes. I served slices of grilled bread on the side. So refreshing!

A great and easy marinade!  We used this marinade on chicken, then cooked on the grill.  A unique flavor, and super taste.  We found tahini in the ethnic foods section of the grocery store with no problems.  Tonight we are going to marinade salmon for the grill!

*Just wanted to add, we used it on salmon.  Substituted Splenda for the sugar called for and it turned out fantastic!   Even non-salmon eaters had seconds!

This was great! I used thinly sliced strips of sirloin steak, marinated for 4 hours. Then I dumped the entire thing, marinade and all, into my wok and stir fried the whole thing. We served it with stir fried veggies and basimati rice.

Absolutely fantastic!!  My chicken only marinaded for about 3 hours (didn't decide early enough in the day!!), but nonetheless, this marinade did not disappoint!  The addition of the sesame seeds and tahini gave an incredible flavour and the chicken was super moist!  Served this alongside a salad dressed with 'Trishie's Chinese-Style Salad Dressing' and it was a great meal!

A winner! Tried the recipe on chicken breasts. Loved the flavor. Made some potstickers and broccoli and made a dipping sauce of tahini, soy, honey, ginger, garlic, hoisin and a dab of water. I look forward to trying this on steak or london broil, as others have suggested. 3/11 update: Made this with filet mignons, and it was even better than on the chicken. Boiled the leftover marinade to use as steak sauce. Awesome!

Unfortunately, I did not care for this at all! And I usually love tahini-based foods. There was something - well, disgusting about the aftertaste of this marinade! It was almost like my veggie skewers had been soaking in glue for hours. It will take a lot for me to try this again.

I was not really sure about how the combo of these ingredients was going to work. I am so glad I tried! The only change I made was to use honey instead of white sugar and baked in the oven at 375 instead of grilling. It came out really delicious, easy and a great way to use up my tahini sauce in a different way than I usually do. Thanks for the recipe, tasted really good, we all loved it!

If this had 6 stars, i'd give it 7!  This was an Awesome marinade/dipping sauce.  I used it on Sirloin Strips and it was SO good.  As someone suggested, I used Peanut Butter since I didn't have Tahini and I also reserved about 1/4 or a little more to dip my steak in.  YUMM!!!  Thanks for this recipe! It will be a regular in my home!

This is incredible!  I tried it with steak, and marinated all day and the flavor was perfect.  I would reserve some of the sauce to warm and add to the meat when it's done cooking.  I can't wait to try with chicken - thanks for an excellent marinade / sauce!

Sorry to be a dissenting vote. I tried this on chicken, and nobody liked it. I thought I would try it again because of the rave reviews. Again, not a 'hit'. Perhaps it would taste better on beef.

Great marinade that's a little different! I always use light soy sauce with less salt.  We use this for chicken breasts and venison chops.  The leftover grilled chicken is great the next day, sliced thin on a salad.

It makes a tasty chicken but there was a lot of marinade leftover and that was even after I used the marinade to baste the chicken while it grilled. I hated wasting so much sesame seed.

I've been using this recipe for years (even though I just officially joined allrecipes).  It's the best marinade I've ever used.  We always use it on kabobs with green peppers and onions, and they turn out fantastic!

This was a great marinade for pork loin too but it needs some more flavor. The pork turned out very moist (baked 2 lb loin at 350 for 1hr covered with all of the marinade). It was sweet but not too much. Adding some oregano and thyme would help. I will be keeping this one.

Wow.  I used this on ribeye steak without the soy sauce (my kids don't like soy) and subbed 1/4 lemon juice.  I also left out the sugar.  Who would have guessed that tahini in a marinade.  The best.  My 13 year old son had TWO whole steaks.  I used a hand held blender to mix it all up and I think it would make a fantastic salad dressing, too.

My family loved this marinade on chicken breasts. The only change I made was to add a little vegetable oil to the marinade.  I do not have an outdoor grill so I used the George Foreman grill. the sugar carmelized and stuck to it really bad, and it also came out a little dry.  Next time I will try putting it in under the broiler.

This wasn't a bad marinade but I was hoping for more of the sesame flavor to come through between the seeds and the tahini.  I found the flavor good but not great.

Absolutely delicious.  I used half white and half brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, and 1 tbsp of garlic powder and 1 tsp dried chives in place of the fresh.  I also added 1 tbsp of olive oil.  Love it!

Really good marinade.  Used it on boneless, skinless chicken breast and marinated for about 8 hours then grilled.  Didn't have green onions on hand so I used a few shakes on onion powder in place on the onions.  Also, used apple cider vinegar in place of red wine vinegar because that is what I had on hand.  My family said it was delicious and something that made chicken taste different than "just chicken".

Definetly a keeper!Took a few low cuts of steak and made them very tender and flavorfull.I compared the ingredients in this recipe to a store bought teriyaki with basically the same ingredients and its way cheaper and healthier to make this recipe.Could not find the tahini but i will search.Will try it on chicken next!

This marinade is awesome. I made it for chicken skewers. When you addred onion, red yellow and green bell pepper skewers chunks it makes it that much better.

I marinaded some chicken breast strips in this for about 4 hours.  We cooked them up and made a fantastic sandwich on sesame bread.  I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.  We will definitely be using this one again.

This was absolutely great. The 1st time I made it I could not find tahini, so I just used a dark soy sauce. I was really good. The 2nd time I had a friend send me some tahini from Missouri. It was AWESOME! A keeper.

My family loved this marinade.  I made pleanty and poured it into zip-lock bags with chicken breasts and pork chops, then I froze them.  We had the pork last night and it got rave reviews.  I had no tahini, so I used extra roasted sesame seeds and put them into the food processor.  I used red wine plus a little vinegar since I had no red wine vinegar.  The pork was juicy and delicious.  Can't wait to try the chicken!

I used this marinade beef kabobs (beef, onions, peppers, and mushrooms on bamboo skewers.)  It was really tasty.  I was concerned that I might be marinating them too long.  I marinated the kabobs for about 8 hours which was long enough.  I probably could have marinated them longer without any problems.  I agree with a previous reviewer that the marinade didn't smell very good, but everything turned out just yummy.  This one's a keeper!

I used a homemade tahini recipe because I had lots of sesame seeds and wasn't going to buy a jar. I also doubled a recipe, used it on a whole cut up chicken (except the wings), and put everything under the broiler. It was delicious and I'll have to try it again.

This was abolutely wonderful!!  I had tahini paste to use and found this recipe on a search.  I used it on boneless, skinless, chicken thighs and breasts (large chunks) and grilled it.  I served over the Chilled Noodles (Chinese Mie) with Tahini Dressing recipe from this site and it was a great mix.  I ate the noodles cold and the chicken hot, but the rest of the family heated the noodles.

I used the marinade with bone-in chicken thighs.  Only had two hours to marinate meat and baked/basted in oven.  Still was FANTASTIC!  The family really enjoyed it, too.  Pan drippings were great over rice.  I followed the recipe to a "t" and probably will next time as well.  Thanks for a great "keeper" recipe!

Yum! I used this to marinate chicken thighs overnight and it is fantastic! Can't wait for leftovers tonight. I didn't have tahini, so I added a few extra sesame seeds and some olive oil.

A bit too sweet for me. Would cut on sugar next time.

This is my absolute favorite marinade for chicken!! I have been making it since 2002 and the only change I make is to substitute sesame oil for tahini, if I don't have any on hand!

I blend all of the ingredients except the onions. It is our favorite and almost everyone asks for the recipe. Our favorite meat to use is skinless, boneless thighs.

The BEST marinade of all time - I've used it in Stan, chicken, even tofu. It's amazing.

Update: Tried this again, adding ginger, cilantro, and Sriracha sauce. Much better, but still 4 stars. Previous review: Great recipe. We were looking for something a little more distinctive, as this was close to what our family already does when we "throw something Asian together" in a pinch without a recipe, but then that's pretty good. We did add some Sriracha sauce to give it a little kick--and still felt it "needed something."
