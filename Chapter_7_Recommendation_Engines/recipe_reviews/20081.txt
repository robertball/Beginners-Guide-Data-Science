I used to eat this as a child at Seventh Day Adventist potlucks.  It was always one of my favorite things.  My husband says it tastes like the bologny spread he used to eat as a kid.  I made it today and it is good.  I bought a can of Linketts and a can of Vega-Links to see which one I liked better.  I think that the Vega-Links have better color for this recipe and they also mash a lot easier.

I thought this was EXCELLENT! My husband and I love the Worthington brand Big Franks and they work great for this recipe (so do the Veja-links). I will definitely use this recipe often!

This is wonderful. I used Morningstar Farms frozen veggie dogs (my new fav). Thawed and cubed them, threw them in a frying pan with the onions for just a sec. to make sure the dogs were cooked. Not sure if they needed to be. Then threw the dogs, onion and relish into the food processor. Let them cool then added some Miracle Whip. Yum! Reminds me of the canned deviled ham sandwich spread I used to eat as a child. Great on a bagel!

I had some problems with this recipe. I couldn't find a can of vegetarian hot dogs, so I bought the packaged kind. They don't mash up easily even when put in the blender. After adding the other ingredients I still had a chunky spread that did not adhere to my bread. The taste is good, though. It's not smooth enough for my baby to eat, so I can't rate it kid-friendly.

I LOVE these sandwiches. We ate them growing up and my Mom always called them “Smooshed Weiner Sandwiches” Haha. We use Worthington brand Veja Links and regular relish. They are super  fast, delicious and the mixture keeps in the fridge for a long time too. I have never added the onion but now might have to try it.

Two out of three kids would eat it so this is definitely a keeper. I used Linkettes and dill relish instead of the sweet. Very good even I ate it two days in a row!

I've been making this for years! My recipe uses dill pickles and we prefer Loma Linda Big Franks (regular or low-fat). This tastes great on whole-grain bread with crisp lettuce. You can also make the spread in a food processor for a smoother texture.

I use Worthington Vega-links (I'm not abot a shameless plug), but I had to use only 1/2 cup of the relish the second time around...   yes, I agree. Emphasis on CANNED vegetarian hotdogs.

OMG, this is fantastic! My family has been inching toward vegetarianism for several years, and the hangup is always what to have for lunch. We had tried the frozen veg hotdogs and they were worse than awful. Tried this with just veja-links and mayo (didn't have pickle relish, and forgot about the onion) and my hubby and I loved it. We'll find out when the kids get in from school whether it's kid-friendly.

I grew up eating this kind of stuff and this recipe in particular!  I always loved it.  I agree the Loma Linda Big Franks are the best to use in this recipe.

Good with Linkette's or Big Franks (both canned). And my favorite is using dill pickles vs. sweet. If you're a dill kind of person, don't use sweet in these, bottom line. Onions are good, but optional. Overall very good!

I just made this recipe and it was very good. I served it on a slice of bread with a slice of cheese and sliced tomatoes.  Excellent!

I really love this. I loved deviled ham as a kid so I am predisposed to like meat spreads. I can't find canned veggie hot dogs, so I used Lifeline. I do the hot dogs first. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a very healthy recipe and so easy to make. A great change from the usual sandwich spreads. I made this using Bush's beans. Their cans are just 16 ounces. I always buy low sodium. I left out the celery because I just don't care for it in sandwiches. I added the dill which makes all the difference and a few dashes of Tabisco and green onions. I did not have any lemon juice so I added lime juice.  Served on whole wheat bread it was superb. I will definitely make this again. I'm always looking for healthy recipes. Thank you very much for submitting this one.
