This is very popular in Puerto Rico. Goes very well with roast pork. Dipping sauce can also be made with pressed garlic and melted butter.

Just the way I remember them! Mayoketchup is the best!! Just like she said, find the balance between mayo and ketchup that will work best for you. I don't measure it, just add and test until it is right for me. I love garlic so I add lots of it. Thank you, LatinaCook!

Wow so delicious. The first time I made it perfectly. The second time I didn't have the oil hot enough. Make sure you do otherwise the oil soaks into the plantains and you've got nasty moosh.

Where have these been all my life? I love them! My wife, who doesn't like the taste or texture of banana loved them too. I made a chipotle yogurt sauce for them, so I can comment on the Mayoketchup with these, but I do like it with french fries. Bravo!

I grew up eating these, they're so delicious! you have to eat them soon after frying and when they're nice and crunchy.  I make my mayo/ketchup dipping sauce with more oomph to it, adding Sriracha hot sauce and red pepper flakes for a nice spicy kick!

This is fabulous!  My Jamaican side is ashamed that I din't know about this recipe before!  I've made it several times now.  I'm completely addicted.

This recipe is simple to make and delicious as written. I did not have garlic salt but enjoyed the Tostones with sea salt. Thank you for the recipe!

Just like my mom made.  Except I'll forgo to mayo dipping sauce.  Otherwise these were just perfect!

Love, love these with fried chicken.  I've never used the mayo/ketchup sauce, will definitely try it.
