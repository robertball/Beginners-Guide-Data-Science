I followed the recipe to a T. They were simple quick and very chocolatey! I think the next time I make them though I will try baking them in a lightly filled cupcake pan and make mini cupcakes with them. Overall these we very good.

This was an easy recipe. I checked the reviews first and made some in a muffin tin and some as directed. Both versions came out but I did have to vary the cooking time and I found that filling the muffin tins too much was a problem that resulted in brownie like rocks. I personally was not impressed but my roommate just loves them. Fiddle with the bake time as you see fit. Worthy of Five stars overall for ease and taste.

My first batch didn't turn out too well...not sure what I did wrong. Changed to s stoneware baking sheet for next batch and they were better. Very sweet cookie.

This is for the serious chocoholic. It's easily made with items readily available in your pantry. I screwed up (what a surprise) and melted all the chocolate bits but I can't say I'm sorry. It was a chocolate explosion in every bite.
