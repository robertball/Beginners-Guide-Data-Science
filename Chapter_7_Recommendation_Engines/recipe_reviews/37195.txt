i marinated my steak for 24 hours, and it came out tender (well, as tender as a flank steak can be!). i omitted the orange juice like others mentioned, and didn't miss it at all. i used too much ginger which over-powered the other flavors, but it was still good. this dish was incredibly easy to put together and took no time at all to cook. i grilled it on my george foreman for about 8-10 minutes, checking to make sure it was cooked through and not burning. turned out great.

I found that the orange juice made the flank steak somewhat mushy on the outside.  The fibers inside were okay, but the texture was lacking. Next time I would omit the citrus.

This recipe was very delicious and flavorful. My family really enjoyed it! It was a great change of pace. I added a drizzle of sesame oil to the original recipe.

This recipe was great after I changed the 1/4 cup vegetable oil to 2 Tbs. olive oil and 2 Tbs. sesame oil. The sesame oil made all the difference, adds a great scent and flavor!

Terrific!  I made it for myself the first night.  Theyh were two steaks.  The first steak reached 145 internal temperature before I took it off the grill.  It was slightly pink in the middle when I shared it with my work mates the next day.  The second steak reached 130 before I took it off the grill... much more juicy and flavorful. My work mates and I greedily sliced the second steak, and froze it to use in fajittas next week.

I loved the sauce... but after tasting it, added a tablespoon of peanut butter to temper the flavors for a surprising bouquet.

This is a quick 'n easy recipe. Throw the steak in the marinade in the morning, chill it, then it is ready to go in the evening. The flavor is amazing and flank steak is so tender. Omit the citrus for non-mushyness.

This was awesome!!!!!  Thd flavor was perfect and the marinade made it perfect tin tenderness.  I did not add the orange juice because of what the other viewrs said and I am glad I left it out because the texture was just like I wanted it.  I also did not have green onions and did not miss that either.  Thankyou for a great recipe, it will be a family favorite.

THIS IS THE BEST RECIPE FOR FLANK STEAK I'VE EVER TASTED! BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER, I COULD NOT GRILL IN 24 HOURS AS THE RECIPE CALLS FOR, SO THE STEAK ENDED UP MARINATING FOR 72 HOURS. IT WAS PERFECT!! IT HAD A DISTINCTLY SWEET ASIAN FLAVOR THAT MY HUSBAND JUST LOVED. EVEN MY PICKY KIDS LIKED IT. *I DID NOT USE THE LEFTOVER MARINADE FOR SAUCE...I JUST MADE A FRESH BATCH WITH FRESH SCALLIONS AND GINGER, ETC. AND IT MADE THE PERFECT POUR OVER SAUCE. ALSO, THE RECIPE CALLS FOR "SCORING" THE MEAT, I SCORED IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH - LEAVING THE ENDS ATTATCHED SO THAT IT STILL REMAINED ONE PIECE OF STEAK, BUT WITH THE ABILITY TO LET THE MARINADE GET ALL THE WAY THROUGH. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE MORE! YOU'LL LOVE IT!! A+ A+ A+

WONDERFUL! I made this twice. I used on pound of flank and cut it in half and used one half that night (I just added a bit more soy sauce and some salt) and marinated the second half and both turned out tasting yum!

Absolutely delicious! Easy to modify the ingredients if you don't have everything on hand too. The fresh ginger and garlic are the essentials.

This was really good. I only had time to marinate it for 5 hours, but the meat was still tender and flavorful.  I also ran out of cornstarch so substituted flour, and the sauce turned out fine.  It has kind of a "sweet and sour" taste that you'd find in a Chinese restaurant.  I served it with steamed rice, grilled veggies, and an Asian salad - a very good main dish!

Good flavor.  I added a tablespoon on hoisin sauce to the sauce mixture once it reduced.  It gave the sauce more of an asian flavor. I wish this could be done with a more tender cut of meat.

Very Tasty. Will definitely keep on file. I am tired of the high price of Flank Steak so i used a nice piece of London Broil on sale. Marinated for about 8 hrs. Sliced it thin on a slant and it melted in our mouths. Nice idea thickening the left over marinade to use as a sauce. no waste here. Delicious.

it was edible, but that's about it. the honey and orange mixed in made the steak taste too sweet and kind of had a bad aftertaste.

This was the first time I made flank steak and I guess I thought it would be really tender.  My husband says it was for a flank steak.  We cooked ours medium rare, maybe it would have been more tender if cooked more well.  It was very good however.

This steak wasn't bad - we marinated it for 24 hours.  I only gave it three stars because DH and I use the recipe "Barbequed Marinated Flank Steak" (also on this site) tastes much better, but uses a lot less ingredients in the marinade.  There was nothing wrong with this dish, I just prefer the other recipe more. :)

All I can say is WOW!!!  I did not have flank steak so I substituted top sirloin.  I marinated this for 48 hours.  Dh grilled it on the barbecue.  Our middle son is not a meat-eater but he asked for seconds!!  This is definitely a keeper for us.

Very easy and delicious. Made without any changes, the sauce was tasty but next time I will add something to 'fire it up' a bit. Served with steamed rice and broccoli.   We all enjoyed this dinner.

Delicious!  I have never cooked flank steak for my family, and I was a bit apprehensive because of the tough reputation of this cut of meat.  To everyone's delight, it came out tender and super juicy.  I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe....it's yummy!

We all enjoyed this recipe very much and liked the flavor a lot, but even after marinating nearly 36 hrs., the flank steak was not very tender, and was actually still chewy.  I will definitely make this recipe again but with a different cut of meat.  Any suggestions?  Thanks.

Very easy and delicious meal.  The reduced marinade was a bit more tangy than I had expected, but nummy all the same.  Fussy husband loved it and took leftovers to work the next day (always a sign of him really likeing something).  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks

Nice marinade.  Served with "Crunchy Lettuce" salad recipe from this site.  Sauce didn't stay mixed but it was tasty.  Maybe next time I'll let the oil separate and try to skim some of it off before boiling the marinade.

This was really delicious.  Even my pickiest eater liked it.  The only thing I would change would be to try to find a bigger cut of meat, because 1 1/4 pounds just wasn't enough for my family of five.

This turned out beautifully.  I didn't have the ginger on hand and substituted a few red pepper flakes instead.  Very tender and juicy even though I used an indoor electric grill (it's snowing outside here).  My Korean husband prefers Americanized Asian dishes and this was a keeper.
