Thie recipe was amazing. The only things I would suggest are 1. buying Hunt's tomatoes - don't substitute with a generic brand. 2. draining the tomatoes, unless you like a really runny salsa. 3. only blending on pulse a few times - I'm talking seconds. The first batch I made was very runny, but the second one was AMAZING, and I got so many compliments on it!! :) Thanks!

I loved this but I don't like uncooked canned tomatoes so I used fresh Roma, my garden is full in summer so I make this as often as I can. Always a hit at get together's. Try the fresh tomatoes you won't be sorry.

Wonderful tasting salsa.  I did do a few changes in the recipe.  I used Mexican stewed tomatoes, fresh jalapeno's, lemon juice in place of lime, lots of cilantro and added about a teaspoon of chili powder to mine.  All our favorite Mexican restaurants tell us to use the chili powder.  Thanks for the recipe.

Words cannot describe how I feel about this recipe. It's soooo good. I was skeptical that it could really taste fresh with canned tomatoes, but it truly does. I didn't change a thing and it was mild and flavorful. When you originally chop your onions, leave them a little on the big side, that way when you blend them, they won't be puried and be overpowering. Also, don't over blend the salsa. After reading reviews, it seems some have complained about the consistency, that it's too runny. I didn't drain my tomatoes, but only pulsed my blender a few times. The consistency was perfect. I've eaten chips and salsa for lunch 2 days in a row now. I'm addicted and will make this regularly. Thanks so much!

Good as it is, but if you're looking for more of a homemade, less sweet taste try using fresh cut Mexican style canned tomatoes in lieu of the stewed tomatoes.  I also added a jalapeno to give it more flavor, and added green onions for less of a "canned" taste.  Wonderful!  Tastes just like the salsa at our favorite Mexican restaurant.

[I rated this recipe once before.  I do NOT blend the tomatoes, because I like chunky sauce. Everyone is SO impressed with the recipe!] Original review: "A KEEPER! - and also to share!  Anyone who objects to canned, and/or Ro-Tel tomatoes should remember that purchased salsa has been cooked and processed.  This recipe has the additional fresh ingredients which takes it FAR above the average purchased salsa (and much cheaper than store prices).  Thanks so VERY much for sharing!"  [If you want "chunky salsa" do NOT use the blender].

This is a quick and easy recipe for delicious salsa-the key is to blend the ingredients for a few seconds.  Tastes even better the second day.

This is an absolutely fantastic recipe. I make it for all the parties that we go to - and continue to get lots of requests for it! It is very important to remember to drain the tomatoes - otherwise it is too runny.

This has joined my recipe book as one of my 'regulars'.

Wow! Now, this is some really good salsa! No wonder the word "famous" is in the title! I've been searching for a really good salsa recipe and I think I've finally come across some really good stuff. I cut the recipe in half and used a 14.5 oz. can of fire roasted tomatoes. Instead of green chiles I opted to used 1 Tbsp. of jalepeno as that's what I had on hand. I added 2 tsp. of apple cider vinegar, 2 tsp. of minced garlic from the jar, and 1/2 tsp. of sugar. I put this into my mini food processor and let it go.... I put it in the fridge for a couple of hours to let the flavors blend and this is now my "go to" salsa recipe. Perfect with warm tortilla chips!

Excellant recipe!

In addition to the base, I used an additional  1/4 of an onion, 12oz of jalapeno's, a teaspoon of red pepper, a teaspoon of cayenne and a dash of chives.

I made this months ago and forgot to rate it. It is one of the best homemade salsa's that I have ever had! I do not use stewed tomato's...I used a large can of diced tomato's with the chili's already added. A little extra lime juice, cilantro and a few dashes of hot sauces and it is wonderful! I even make my own tortilla chips for an added treat. Just use plain tortilla's...cut up into triangles....brush a little oil...a little salt and add spices of your liking and put in the oven at about 300 degrees for about 7-8 minutes. Try this salsa and make your own chips and I can promise...you will not be dissapointed.

IMHO this is THE way to make salsa.  I've been making it this way for a couple of years now, as this is how a Mexican lady I used to work with told me she made hers.  This is great as is.  Some additions I've made at times include adding tomatillas to the food processor, or after the pulsing adding chilli powder, cumin, chipotle powder or chipotle sauce from the can, or corn and black beans, drained.  Also, I do usually drain the tomatoes, and instead of fresh onions I often throw into the food processor either frozen diced onions or a frozen "fajita" blend of sliced bell peppers and onions (a staple in my freezer.)  I pulse the frozen food first with the garlic and cilantro, then add the chiles, then the tomatoes for a quick pulse.  I like using the frozen peppers and onions b/c it's quick and easy, which works out great b/c I'm lazy.  Also, it has the added benefit of chilling the salsa immediately, and if you let it sit in the fridge it doesn't seem to take as long for the flavors to really marry.  I keep these ingredients on hand and can whip up a batch of this in under five minutes, seriously, I've timed myself, and I'm spoiled for other salsas.  This salsa makes Old El Paso seem like chunky ketchup was boiled with onion powder, then pasteurized and bottled.  And even some so-called "fresh" salsas made with chopped fresh tomatoes can be so bland.   This recipe alone makes it worth buying a food processor, or, as I call it, a "salsa machine."

I was really disappointed with this recipe after all the wonderful reviews.  It just didn't have much of a taste to it and I followed the recipe exactly.  Blending it was a big mistake also, it gives it a watery consistency.

Mmm, mmm good! I have been looking for a great recipe for homemade salsa for years, and finally found one! I accidentally bought canned whole tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes, but the result was wonderful. It could have used more chiles for more spice, but was great anyway. My husband and I really like lime, so we added some extra lime juice as well as some small pieces of lime. I love cilantro, and the amount called for in the recipe suited my taste just fine. Excellent recipe, and definitely a keeper!

Use the reipe as an excellent base and then add more ingreients to taste. I added twice as many green chiles and also used vinegar, cayenne pepper and chili powder to taste, couple teaspoons each gve it a little kick...very bland without.I was also fortunate enough to use fresh tomatoes...end masterpiece was 5-stars. Family was very impressed. Better than half the restaurant salsas.

This recipe was excellent and went over well with family and friends.  One modification I always do when making homemade salsa is to saute the onions and jalapeno first.  I also followed some advice of other reviewers (added some fresh tomatoes, used Mexican Style stewed tomatoes, added green onions and more cilantro).  It gives the salsa a really nice mellow taste without sacrificing any flavor.  Would definitely make this again.

Very good.  I doubled the recipe and cooked it for 30 minutes, decanted it into several jars and froze it.  We eat TONS of this stuff and it's useful in lots of recipes.  Only difference was the addition of a couple of tablespoons of white vinegar.  Didn't use the food processor but a potato masher (after it was cooked) to make the pieces of tomato smaller and more consistant in size.  It makes good gifts and I always get blue ribbon reports!

Delicious!  I made sure to drain the tomatoes well and did not use a food processor.  I simply chopped everything finely and mixed together.  This salsa tastes just like my favorite restraunt salsa, I will be sharing it with my family for sure!

I've made this a few times now and its really good. I've used roma tomatoes, hunts stewed, and store brand stewed tomatoes..The hunts stewed were by far the best. And also make sure to drain the tomatoes first or it will be a little too runny :)

Love this salsa! I throw all the ingredients in a food processor and have fresh salsa in minutes. I have played with the ingredients a little. More garlic and more jalapeno pepper and less cilantro suits our palates a little better.

This salsa turned out very well.  My only complaint is the watery-ness.  Next time, I think I will only use one can of tomatoes (and drain it well) and add a nice fresh tomato to the salsa.  I may have also over-blended...  I'll ease that up next time as well.  This is a great recipe that everyone loved.  It is also good warm!

I made this as an appetizer on Thanksgiving day and my family and friends loved it.  My husband said it was perfectly hot enough (I used 1/2 a can of green chilis) and it was really very easy to make. I used two cans of Hunt's fire-roasted diced tomatoes. Heed others' advice and don't over blend in the blender!

Excellent salsa recipe! The only things that I did differently were that I added some extra cilantro and used 1 can of tomatoes and then used fresh Roma tomatoes instead of the other can. My family has gobbled up almost all of the salsa in one dinner sitting and the recipe makes a decent amount of salsa. I went to go get the salsa out of the fridge to eat it this evening and caught my mom eating it in her room. She said "this is so good!" That's all I needed to hear.

Delish~  First time making home made salsa and I think I now know what everyone will be getting for Christmas this year!  I followed the original recipe for the most part.  Changes that I made include:  only 1 TBS of cilantro because I don't really like the stuff (but how can you completely leave it out of salsa?!?!), 3 lg cloves of garlic, italian flavored stewed tomatoes, lime juice & lemon juice (not sure how much, I just started squirting), 4oz can of chopped green chili, my usual seasoning that I pretty much put in everything (garlic powder, onion powder, Tony Chachere's Original seasoning, pepper, parsley,& oregano) and now that I think about it I think I accidentally used a whole onion??  I was a also hesitant to blend it all up since I like mine chunky, but the hubby convinced me too and it was great!  I did add some corn at the end and a some of the chopped onion that I had set aside in order to give it a little texture.  I also would have tossed some black beans in at the end if I had them, but I was that lucky ;o)  Mmmm~  SO~O~O GOOD!

Delicious!  Incredible!  A keeper!  Made a couple of additions, which I would recommend.  Add 4-6 slices of jalepeno peppers (from jar) and 3 teaspoons jalepeno juice (from jar).  I took the advice of other reviews and chopped the onion (larger pieces - not too small). Don't have a food processor.  Used a blender - "Pulsed" for 5 seconds.  FABULOUS recipe!  Thanks!

I used one can of Mexican style stewed tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes (with no salt added). I added a dash of chili powder and only 1/2 a teaspoon of salt because I felt that there would be enough from the stewed tomatoes. I used 1/2 of one fresh jalapeno (with the seeds), and this provided the perfect amount of heat. I, personally, could handle more but this amount makes it enjoyable for everyone. I used a food processor and used the pulse button only a few times to get the right consistency! Excellent recipe!

Awesome!  Very easy, very yummie.  I was doubtful at first since I'd never heard of using canned stewed tomatoes for salsa, but this recipe made a believer out of me!  I make this all the time now and love using lots of extra lime.  I also drain the tomatoes for a thicker salsa.  Great.

Great!  Add a splash of Worcestershire sauce and one minced chipotle pepper in adobo sauce for a little kick.  Makes enough for an army, so cut in half if you're not feeding a crowd.

It's a little sweet for my husband and I. I might add some jalapenos and use a different stewed tomato next time.

I have finally found the perfect salsa recipe!  I used lemon instead of lime because I didn't have a lime.  I think it is important to use Hunt's stewed tomatoes, not just any tomatoes.  Also, drain them like previous posters have suggested.  We prefer about 1/2 the cilantro because once in the fridge, it gets very strong.  Great recipe though!

I like this recipe, but I'd suggest using actual cheap fresh jalapeños rather than the massively, ridiculously mega-overpriced canned version. They're $3.29 for a tiny can here while fresh jalapenos are 49 cents a pound.

This is a delicious salsa.  I made it almost exactly as written, except I added one minced jalapeno, seeded and ribs removed.  I did drain the tomatoes, reserved the liquid, but didn’t end up using any.  I placed all the ingredients in the blender, stirred it a bit with a big spoon, and then blended it, literally, for 2-3 seconds.  It was perfect.  Not too chunky, not too smooth/runny.  Better than any of the jarred salsas by far and too easy not to make your own.

Altho I liked the salsa, I wasn't really blown away by it.  Here are my reasons:

1.  You can't control the consistancy. My recommendation is that if you don't want your salsa to be more like a smooth gazpacho, then, chop everything separately and do the tomatoes last and very carefully. Otherwise, you'll end up with a smooth "paste" like I did. 

2.  The flavor was bland. There wasn't much kick at all.  I recommend roasting the garlic, adding something else to it to give it some flavor. Maybe roasted red peppers? I even added jalepenos but got little results. it was okay, but really not what I would rate as famous or special. Very average.

So, my recommendations are more flair to the flavor and processing each ingredient separately so you can keep a more salsa like consistancy.

This is a good option when you're craving salsa in the winter time. I agree with the others, though; make sure you buy quality canned tomatoes.

pretty good. it tastes a little too much like plain stewed tomatoes, though. don't know how to improve it . . . perhaps some additional onion and cilantro.

My brother-in-law made this for a get-together and we LOVED it. Great with jalapenos and/or green chiles, depending on how spicy your audience likes it. Great fresh and within the first 3-4 days.

Love this!!  Just because of preference, I used diced tomoates instead of Stewed and lemon juice instead of lime.  We even put this on hamburgers and pepperjack cheese and call them Pico Burgers - HUGE YUMMO!!

I made this recipe in an attempt to replicate the salsa at the best Mexican Diner in our area - Jr. Salsa's. After my first time there, I claimed the salsa "Made my taste buds sing!" It was SO delicious and fresh-tasting; who needed dinner? I was shocked when the proprietor told me he used canned tomatoes! So, I needed salsa for a slow-cooker steak fajita recipe I was making, but Jr.'s is closed on Sundays and Mondays (and I refuse to buy canned/jarred), so I tried this recipe. I used a large can of diced tomatoes and, per the Jr. Salsa proprietor's suggestion, I used a white onion. For personal taste, I used two large cloves of garlic, minced. Word of advice: This salsa cannot be enjoyed immediately. IT MUST BE REFRIGERATED AT LEAST 24 HOURS! This takes away that 'canned' tomato taste, and the fresh ingredients (onion, garlic, cilantro, lime juice) infuse the tomatoes with a lovely, deliciously crisp flavor. Thanks D! Absolutely delicious AND it's time and budget friendly!

Excellent Salsa, I followed the advice of some of others by using Mexican Stewed Tomatoes and a Fresh Jalepeno.  I did not drain the tomatoes, but was very careful not to overdo blending everything in the food processor.  The consistancy was perfect, not watery at all, but saucy like a salsa should be.  One jalepeno (with seeds) was the perfect amount of heat for me.  To get the most flavor out of this salsa, make a day ahead of serving and refrigerate for 24 hours.

Easy to make and delicious. I don't have a fancy food processor, but used a blender on low pulse - worked great! Awesome with serono chiles: 1 = mild, 2 = just right, 3 = kind of hot, 4 = really hot.

As written, it's pretty good, but I prefer to make a couple of changes. I like to add some roasted Serrano peppers instead of the green chiles, and little salt  . My husband can't get enough of it. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a little watery, but very nice and fresh tasting.  Don’t overblend.  Maybe add some whole tomatoes for thicker consistency.

Excellent!  I sauted the onion slightly after chopping because I don't really like that "raw" onion taste in my salsa.  Especially good after it's been in the fridge for a few days.

Sorry, but I think I may be the only person giving this recipe a bad review. I had to give it one star. I had high hopes for it based on the reviews. I made this salsa for a BBQ dinner and absolutely no one touched it. Followed the directions exactly too. I was expecting something better but just don't think the texture went over well with the guests. I guess we just appreciate using fresh chopped tomatoes and chilis versus stewed can. It definitely was not as fresh.

My first time making this. I will NEVER buy store bought salsa again. This was easy! I added a little extra garlic and salt plus fresh chiles instead of canned. Next time I will add a jalapeno pepper in place of a chile, and a little chili powder to make it spicier. This recipe is fairly mild.

This salsa is great!  Easy to make.  My husband loved it.  I added an extra jalepeno pepper to give it just a little more heat.  Will make this all the time.  Thanks.

I liked this, and so did my husband. It had a really fresh taste. I loved that it wasn't spicy. My husband added a few things to make his really hot, and he absolutely loved it.

Really easy and tastes great.  I make it as described, but I do drain the tomatoes because I personally like chunky and not watery salsa.

very good salsa.  And a perfect combination of flavors.  I suggest following the recipe to a T, except, add more garlic.  1tsp was not near enough for my tastes.

This is great, but does need some modifications. Fresh jalapeno instead of canned chiles. More lime for an authentic flavor, a bit of salt, and a splash of vinegar.  Also better with extra cilantro.  Best if allowed to sit in the refrigerator for at least 4 or 5 hours, preferably overnight.

The first time I made this recipe I made it exactly as advertised, but I'm going to add a few things that make it even better. Add in the tomatoes, salt, cilantro, garlic, lime into the food processor. Now add half a teaspoon of ground cumin. 

I substitute real jalapenos in this recipe as well, so I chop them up and use the seeds (where the heat is!). One jalapeno will get you a medium salsa, two will get you hot. I add the seeds into the food processor along with the ingredients above and run the food processor until it's very well mixed. It should be watery.

Now, add in the onions and chopped jalapeno that you diced up and pulse the food processor one or two times ONLY. This way when you pull your salsa out, you'll have chunks of onion and jalapeno with a nicely mixed salsa.

Refrigerate before serving for a few hours. Hope that helps!

My husband made this salsa for a BBQ we hosted recently and it was delicious. The only change he made was the addition of a jalapeno pepper and he used fresh tomatoes rather than canned.  Yummy!

this was ok alone. we tried it after making it and decided it was missing something. scouring the site for other salsa recipes led us to add a bit more salt, some vinegar, some red pepper, and some chili powder. it was great with the additions, but not so great on its own.

This has to be the best salsa ever! I don't know why I waited so long to give this one a try.  I did use fresh tomatoes, because I had to use them up, but I'm sure that it would be just as good with the canned tomatoes. The flavors were spot on with just the right balance of all the ingredients involved.  This is definitely going to be my go-to recipe.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Very good salsa recipe! I doubled the tomatoes but left the amounts of all the other ingredients the same. I also used 2 whole serrano peppers, seeds and all, in place of the chiles

The only thing I did different was I used 2 habaneros and 2 jaleponos instead of the chilies. I also took the advice of one of the other reviews and used the Mexican style stewed tomatoes. It turned out awesome. I took it to work and in less than an hour everyone was remarking about how good my salse was. It's simple to make and taste better than anything I've ever bought. (Has anyone tryied to can this and if so how did you do it?)

I just made this and it is AMAZING!!!! I have never made salsa before and this was so easy and tastes so good. I will never buy salsa again. I did buy the mexican style stewed tomatoes that have jalapenos, garlic, and cumin. I love cilantro, so I used more. Other than that, I followed it exactly. I can't wait til Monday night football parties!!! Thank you so much for such a great recipe!!! This is a must at my house now!!!!

This is a fabulous recipe! I made it for my Dad's Spanish dinner as the appetizer piece of the meal. I used the basic salsa receipe, and then added a list of ingredients everyone made suggestions on. I took that salsa and then spooned out some into small bowls, and added jalapenos to one, banana peppers to another, and then serranos to the last. This way you had different flavors (sweet, medium, and hot) in the same recipe.

Well, this is great in a pinch. Although I am going to agree with some other reviewers and say that is tastes VERY CANNED. Its like a store bought Salsa. I am very used to homemade (roasting the tomatoes,jalepenos,etc.). And its like going from Fresh Homemade Mashed Potatoes to Dried Spuds. Thank you for the recipe,it was fine, a three star for me.

This salsa was so fast and easy to make and my husband and kids couldn't get enough of it.  It's not a hot or spicy salsa, so if you like the heat, you need to add more of the green chiles or some hot sauce.

I did this recipe exactly as shown and it won rave reviews. I changed the regular stewed tomatoes for Mexican stewed tomatoes and it was gone in a flash. This one is a real hit no matter how you do it! Thank you Denise!

This is delicious. I love salsa and this one rates pretty high. Even my husband, who never eats salsa, said it was good. If you aren't fond of "hot" then reduce the chili peppers a bit.

Definitely a keeper! My husband loved this.  Only next time I will use 1 tbsp of cilantro instead of 3 and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic instead of 1. I also added a heaping 1/4 cup of jalapenos. Have to give it a little fire!

Great recipe.  A little too much cilantro in my opinion.

AWESOME salsa recipe.  It's great all year-round since it calls only for canned tomatoes instead of fresh and it's SOOO easy.  I tried it with tomatillos also, which was a good variation.  I made it when my mother was visiting and she took some home with her along with the recipe!

My son found this recips and has made it for his friends who raved about it.  One thing he did change, he used Mexican Stewed Tomatoes which he drained in a colander along with the green chilies. Also he did not chop the ingredients before placing in the food processor.  This 
made the salsa more "chunky".  All in all it was a hit!

No matter what kind of chili you use, this salsa
is delicious!  I have been looking for a quick
and easy salsa recipe, and this is it.  It suits
my taste fine, although I wouldn't be shy about adding a hotter pepper.  I appreciate recipes which are milder and give suggestions for hotter
methods, rather than burning my tongue off the first time I try it!  Thanks for sharing.

Well, I just want to say THANK YOU!  What a wonderful recipe!  I used canned diced tomatoes w/roasted garlic and omitted the fresh garlic (uncooked garlic makes me disagreeable to be around!) and also added some pickled jalapenos.  I made it after I came home from work and we ate it right away.  Can't wait to try it tomorrow after the flavors have had time to meld.  (I also omitted the salt because my chips were salted.)  All you salsa lovers, this one's for you!

This recipe is great.  I added 1 can of Mexican style stewed tomatoes and I can of diced tomatoes(with added green chiles), about 2 tablespoons of green onions, about 3 tablespoons of canned jalapenos, and 1 teaspoon of chille powder.  I thought the 3 tablespoons of cilantro was a bit much but that's probably my personal preference.  I pulsed it in the blender for about 3 seconds 3 times and it came out perfect.  Great recipe and I'll definitely be making this again.

This is a great salsa recipe!  Every one of our friends that has tried it has asked for the recipe. I've tried several ways of spicing it up and have found that canned, chopped jalapenos work best.  I use 1/2 of a small can per batch of salsa.  You can adjust for your heat tolerance.

This is a GREAT recipe!  I roasted two jalapeno peppers first and added them chopped instead of the green chiles (this made it a medium heat salsa).  Only one word of caution - be careful when using the blender the stewed tomatoes get chopped up very quickly, pulse just a few times if you don't want to end up with salsa soup!

This was OK.....but I needed to add a few more cloves of garlic and more cilantro and I added a whole jalenpeno pepper to make it a little on the hot side......but that's how we like it!   This was pretty good but there is nothing like fresh, summer tomatoes in it!

Take this review with a grain of salt.  I didn't have cilantro which I know would have made a big difference, but I didn't care for this at all.  It tasted a lot like stewed tomatoes.  I think I will try it again with the cilantro and maybe canned diced tomatoes instead.  Or even tomato sauce.  I think my downfall was the brand of stewed tomatoes (DelMonte) and the lack of cilantro.

This turned out fantastic. Due to heart failure, I'm on a sodium restrictive diet, so I'm always looking for ways to make my own of the high sodium foods I enjoy like soup, salsa, spaghetti sauce, taco season, etc. I followed the recipe exactly except I halved the recipe since it was my first batch. Used a can of no salt added diced tomato with garlic, basil and oregano - drained. 3/4 white onion, 1/2 lime juiced, 3 tbsp green chilis, 1/4 tsp table salt and 1/4 tsp no salt substitute and 1.5 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro. Threw everything in the blender and pulsed a few times to my desired consistency. Chilled for a couple hours and WOW, the natural taste of homemade salsa was awesome!! I now have a very, very low sodium salsa I can eat with my no salt tortilla chips, eggs, meatloaf, etc.  Wonderful!! Will be making again and again.

Made this last night for a Mexican themed football night. Can't begin to explain how good it was. Everyone loved it. I made it as is. Didn't change anything and it was amazing. We're having some as we speak and is even better today. Will definitely be making this regularly

Love this recipe, have made it many, many times over the years. Lately I have scaled it down since I discovered Rotel tomatoes. The mild or hot comes with green chilis, so I don't add extra and now they have a new "Mexican" one which comes with lime & cilantro. 
I just use one can mild or hot and one can of the Mexican, add the onion, garlic & salt from the recipe & BAM I'm done!

D's Famous Salsa Haiku: "Wow, big thanks to 'D', Crazy easy to make this. Eaten up real fast!" Not much else to say other than 5-stars as written, no changes, pulsed mine longer for a smoother salsa, and it was unreal how good this was. I wouldn't have minded a jalapeno (or several) thrown in for a kick, but I served this at a party w/ some younger palates in attendance, and every age devoured it w/ zeal.

Wow! I am addicted. So delicious and fresh tasting. I ,like some other reviewers, was hesitant because of the canned tomatoes but it was delicious. A keeper for our family. Once the summer months come I will use fresh tomatoes. I also didn't drain the juices out of the tomatoes made it just like the recipe said and it wasn't too wet for us. Thank you!

Great Salsa!!We add a little more to make it a bit hotter, but this has been a great hit everywhere we have taken it. We have had a jar in the house ever since we made the first batch. I am done getting salsa from the store. and it really is super easy to make.

I made some alterations based on what I had on hand. I drained the tomatoes to avoid a salsa that is excessively loose. I also used frozen cilantro cubes instead of fresh. I had no lime or lemon juice so I used grapefruit juice and didn't really notice a difference. I also used an entire onion because it was on the smaller side. Plus I added a wee bit of ground pepper. 

This was pretty good and I'll make it again sometime. I think the garlic is part of what makes it SO good. I'd like to try it with roasted tomatoes and roasted garlic next time to see how that changes the flavor. 

I bet with fresh cilantro and fresh chili peppers it would be even better!

Lived in Texas, California and Colorado, so I know my salsas.  :)  This one is REALLY good. I followed the recipe except I used green chili POWDER and about 1/2 tsp of sugar.  YUM.  And the original poster is right--I like my salsa chunky, too, but this really tastes best when blended.  Maybe you could add some diced tomatoes and onions after blending?

Warning! VERY addicting salsa!  Excellent flavor & spice and so simple to make.  Had to make a second batch before I put everything away! If you find the salsa a little runny for your liking, just add a tbsp or two of tomato sauce with a pinch of sugar...just perfect!! I also add a few shakes of chili powder as another recommended. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This salsa is my favorite!! I make it all the time and even my boss (who doesn't like salsa, mind you) loves it! I use the mexican style stewed tomatoes and add a pinch of cayenne pepper for a little extra spice. I add fresh, diced jalapeno's when I want to spice it up more.

It is a good base to start from.  I added a lot more onion, cilantro, and lime juice than the recipe called for.  I also added jalapenos and instead of using regular salt I added garlic salt.

Good basic start for a recipe. If you like your salsa extra hot & spicy, then you will have to experiment with other peppers.

My friends ask me to make this for them as birthday gifts... super health and fantastically flavourful.  Add corn and black beans to add a mexican twist.

Very good!  After reading the reviews, I was tempted to use real tomatoes, but decided to try it with the mexican canned first.  I thought it was really good!  Next time I will try with the fresh tomatoes just to see if there is a huge difference.  Great recipe!

This was GREAT.. I used roma tomatos instead of stewed and  I also added 1tsp of chili powder as well as 1 tsp of cumin. Loved the texture and fresh flavors!

I would have given this 10 stars if I could.  ABSOLUTELY the best salsa I've ever had.  I was just hoping for close to the salsa from my favorite restaurant but it was better.  I used the Mexican stewed tomatoes, as suggested, but will probably add a chile to it next time for just a little heat!  The flavor was stupendous.  Thanks so much. I'll be sharing this with everyone I know!

When I first saw this recipe, I wasn't really sure why this simple recipe with common ingredients can be "so good."  But because of its simplicity and many reviewers said it'll only takes a few pressing of a pulse button, I've decided to try this.  I've got everything except my grocery store was completely out of limes because of Cinco de Mayo so I had to substitute it with lemon.  I also got fresh chili peppers just in case and was very tempted to use those instead of canned peppers because I was worried about the canned stewed tomatoes and canned peppers might make the taste of this salsa like a store bought jarred salsa which I really hate but I decided to give the canned pepper a try.  I only made half of what's written and it was super quick to make.  From the gathering of ingredients to pour the salsa into a bowl, it took less than 5 minutes.  But because it was just for me, I thought it still made a plenty of salsa, probably good for at least 2-4 people.  Well, that was only 15 minutes ago and my salsa is... GONE!  Yes, I finished 2/3 of the salsa while I was standing next to the blender, and finally sat down to enjoy the rest.  Did I read someone did the same thing somewhere?!  Well, anyways, I don't even have much chips left but I'm debating if I should just make another batch!  It was delicious for sure.  Thank you!  I guess I can stop buying salsa from the Mexican restaurant now.

GREAT Salsa! So easy to make. I used mexican stewed tomatoes like others suggested. And added extra cilantro just because I like it so much.  Will be making this again. No more store bought salsa for me.

I like chunky salsa so I dont blend it. I also add jalapenos and banana pepper rings diced up and some of the juice. I use fresh tomatoes if I have them on hand. Last time I made it i added a chopped avocado and let it meld a little and used as a topping for carne asada tacos. My husband started eating the tortillas with just the salsa.

This is a really great base for a salsa.  It's really very similar to a fabulous salsa we get at local restaurant that I have been trying to copy.  I've made it three times now, and each time, I seem to get different results.  I usually add a little more garlic, a little more onion, and much more cilantro!

I love this recipe.  I think that the recipe, when followed exactly, is a little sweet but I add more salt, chiles and lime juice to make it less sweet and it is wonderful.  I get compliments every time I make it.  To me, it tastes just like the Mexican restaurant salsa!

Unless I need to put salsa into another recipe, I don't buy it anymore -- I make this one.  Ingredients are easy to keep on hand for impromptu guests, too. Be sure to pulse the processor very quickly. If you've reasonably chopped, hardly any processing is needed.  I use a slotted spoon to fill my serving container & drain away excess liquid if necessary.

I must say this is the best salsa recipe I have ever made in my life.  I had a friend once who made a salsa that was similar to this one, and I have been searching for 12 years to find a similar recipe. Well, here it is!!!  The tomatoes are what make this recipe.  Like another commenter stated; and I will too, “you must use Hunt Stewed Tomatoes” or else you might as well forget it.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated. The only thing I did different was that I use a hand cranked food processor (which I bought at the swap meet) instead of a blender.  Using a blender may blend the salsa too much making it runny and watery.  I like the hand cranked food processor better because you can more easily control the chopping of the ingredients.  There is virtually no way to over chop the ingredients with the hand cranked food processor.  As well you can crank it backward to mix the ingredients, and then forward again to chop them.  This helps in getting the perfect consistency.  It is also a good idea to strain the juice from the tomatoes before putting them into the hand cranked food processor, if not it may come out to watery.  There is enough water in the tomatoes and the green chilies to make it consistent enough, but not too watery.  I drained the green chilies as well before adding them to the mix.  Also for those who may not have access to or do not wish to use a real lime, I used a table spoon of lime juice instead of the juice from half of a lime.

This recipe is closest to the base I use, so I decided to share my changes and ratings here. First, I can my own tomatoes, so I simply use a quart of those (if you have a quart that didn't seal properly, then you have an immediate volunteer!) - but best to drain first. Next, I use 4-5 cloves of garlic, 1 jalapeño pepper, 1 Hungarian hot wax pepper, 1 tbl red wine vinegar, 1/2 of a red onion chopped, 1/3 cup fresh chopped cilantro, 1/2 lemon juiced and about 1/2 tsp salt. In less than 10 minutes, you have the best tasting salsa ever!

I was going to make a different salsa from this site for a party and accidently got the wrong chiles. I decided to do this recipe instead since I had all of the ingredients. Very good standard salsa - thanks!

This was killer! I was so hesitant on using canned tomatoes. I like the really fresh taste of using all fresh ingredients but this had such rave reviews so I tried it. And boy am I glad I did. I am a garlic-aholic and I actually forgot to put the garlic in and it was DELICIOUS without so I'm sure it would taste even better with it. I didn't add any salt either. I did throw in some green onions. I made one batch like that and then I did another identical batch and threw in a jalapeno and that was yummy. I will probably do 2 jalapenos next time. Another note... I used 1 can of regular tomatoes and 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes... YUMMY! Thanks for sharing your simple yet tasty recipe :-)

Didn't change a thing!  My husband was so in love with this salsa that he practically licked the bowl clean.  Both he and I would agree with other reviewers in that this should be made about a day to two days in advance of when you play to eat it as it doesn't taste very good the first day.  The best was about 2 days later.  All the flavors melded together and it was fabulous!  So easy to make too.

I can't believe how fresh this tasted considering the tomatoes were canned! Took some of the other reviewers suggestions and used one can of rotel drained and 1 can of Mexican stewed tomatoes drained while omitting the can of green chiles.  Will be making many more times -- thanks for a great recipe!

Need more than 5 stars to describe this recipe - it was a 10!  I never knew a salsa as good as some of the good Mexican restaurants I've been to could be this easy.  I used a can of diced jalepenos instead of chilis because we like it hot, and this was the freshest tasting (with canned tomatoes!), most awesome salsa I have ever had.  Will never by store bought again!  
Thanks for sharing!

This was my first attempt at making salsa, and it turned out great. I followed the advice of previous reviews and drained the liquid from the tomatoes before using. I made a double batch, and used 3 cans of stewed tomatoes and 1 can of petite diced tomatoes. I processed the stewed tomatoes with the other ingreadients, then added the diced tomatoes to give it more texture, but I still didn't think it was chunky enough. Next time I will just process 2 cans of stewed tomatoes then add 2 cans of diced to give it more texture. I doubled the garlic because I love garlic, but will probably use what the recipe calls for the next time. It was too garlicky for some people. I will also probably add the onion after processing the tomoatoes. The onion flavor is strong because it gets so fine. I love onions just like garlic, but it is too strong for some people.

This is the best salsa EVER!!!!  The ONLY thing I changed was instead of using stewed tomatoes was that I diced up fresh tomatoes..you can also use canned petite diced tomatoes.   I took this salsa to a mexican potluck at work and it was a hit!!! I will definately make this time and time again.

I decided to make homemade salsa this morning to go along with our soft tacos we are having for dinner.  I added a fresh tomato, for the flavor and because it is all I had, I used some jarred jalepenoes instead of the chilis and lemon juice instead of lime.  I have now been "taste testing" for 10 min and I am afraid there won't be enough for dinner!

This was an excellent salsa with the ingredients easily on hand.  I made a second batch that suited our local flavor (Oklahoma Salsa Lovers Version)  with the following modifications:  1 can of green chilis, 1/2 teaspoon brown sugar, 2 teaspoons minced garlic.  The brown sugar almost adds a roasted quality to the salsa.
Excellent Recipe!

Delicious!  Used Rotel in place of stewed tomatoes and also used some Key lime juice in place of regular.  Got rave reviews from my kids and husband!

Great salsa!  The first time I made it I used the exact recipe.  The next time I used canned diced tomatoes with spicy peppers already in them and used green onions with tops instead of regular onion and it was terrific.  I plan to keep these ingredients on hand.  Everyone loved this salsa.  It is especially good with lime flavored tortilla chips.

There should be ten stars on this recipe! Denise, this is amazing salsa. I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I added 5 garlic cloves instead of 1 (I love garlic), and added 1/2 t or so of chili powder for an additional kick. This was a fantastic hit at a Halloween party last night. Everyone loved it. Make sure you make it in advance and chill it for a wonderful, cool taste. Will definitely become a regular salsa go-to recipe. Thanks, Denise!

I like many others was a little doubtful when I read this recipe and saw it called for canned tomatoes and chilis. But I trusted the other reviewers who said it was so good, and guess what? It is GREAT!! I actually only had one can of tomatoes (used mexican-style), but i kept the other ingredients in the same quantities (except I doubled the lime juice). I only pulsed the tomatoes in the blender for a moment, and the other ingredients i added after (didn't blend them at all) b/c I like a chunky salsa. 
I have served this at 2 dinner parties now and people RAVE over it. And the best part it is so easy and you almost always have the ingredients on hand. I may never make "fresh" salsa again.....
thank you Denise!

I had doubts while I was making this that it would turn out as good as the reviews stated.  I was wrong, it is delicious!! I used less cilantro than suggested (just to  my taste) put everything except tomatoes in food processor and chopped, put in a bowl and than added the diced tomatoes as recommended by another review mixed it all in the bowl and put back in processor and mixed it really fine (again to my taste).  Very happy with result.  I will definately make again and probably make some more changes but this is an excellent base recipe for salsa.

Really good!  I've found it be better with only 2 tbs of cilantro and the whole 4oz can of green chilis.  Add 1 tsp of sugar, and you'll be eating this days!

VERY GOOD!!  I've never made salsa so I really didn't know what to expect. However, next time I might like it a bit thicker so I'll buy a can of diced tomatoes instead of one can of stewed and add them after blending. I also used bottled key lime juice and it was very flavorful!

I haven't made this, but I just wanted to note...
My dad makes salsa that sounds just like this, only with about triple the cilantro and double the lime, and he uses plain old Pace instead of the stewed tomatoes, and it is DELICIOUS.  So, maybe... play with the lime and cilantro, to taste?

Yummy...I won a salsa contest at work with this.  Minor changes.  I used 1 can diced tomatoes, 2 cans Rotel tomatoes with chilies.  Both drained. Added 4 hand diced, seeded roma tomatoes.  Also diced onions by hand...less onion-y, not as overpowering
 Handful of cilantro in the food processor and 1 whole lime squeezed.  First time my salsa tasted just right.  Thanks, Denise!

Excellent salsa, not watery, chunky, or full of some silly fruity flavor...this is classic salsa, very similar to what's served at the famous Ted's Cafe Escondido in Oklahoma City where folks flock in from out of state and wait in line for hours to get the best Tex-Mex in the world.

I agree with other reviewers in that this tasted very canned.  There was no "kick" to it and I don't think just adding jalepeno's would take away the canned taste.

First time making salsa and it was great!  Not too spicey, so I added three serrano chilies, next time I'll add five.  The salsa was sweet, so I added about two tablespoons of vinegar as suggested by another user.  It took no time at all - I'll definitely make again!!

This was the best salsa I have ever eaten! Being a new cook, I decided to make my parents a Mexican meal one night to give them a break from the kitchen... and this went over VERY well! I recommend this to anyone looking for a tasty salsa. It was perfect the way it is written!

Am I missing something? This salsa was WAY too tomatoey in my opinion. I don't know if I did something wrong, but I felt like I was dipping my chips in tomato puree. Yuck!

All I can say is "THE BOMB"! My friends and I are HUGE mexican freaks and I have never made salsa before so I thought it would be fun for a small get together. I made this and added about 1/4 cup of japlapinos to it and this stuff was so good. We ate the whole thing!! We all thought that it tasted better then most mexican restaurant salsa. My only advice is dont blend for longer then a  couple of seconds. This is a winner!!!!!!

Awesome!!! I just couldn't get enough of this.  I did add just a hint of tabasco, but not too much.  There was a cool taste, nice texture, and an awesome taste.  I highly recommend and I will be making this again.  Others at my party loved it too.

I made this salsa and served it to guests for the first time today!  EVERYONE  loved it.  I added one jalapeno pepper to 'jazz' it up, but it was wonderful without it also.  This is a must keep recipe.  I will make this one over and over again!  Terrific salsa!!!!!

This was the first time I ever made homemade salsa and it was a success!  Very easy.  I am not a huge thick and chunky salsa fan, so this was perfect for me (I may have blended it too much though..my fault!)  I added a little more fresh lime juice.  Everyone loved it!  A keeper!

This is a wonderful recipe! When I show people how to make it they are always surprised by how easy it is. I use half of a large fresh jalapeno (chopped) and I probably go heavier on the cilantro. What makes it so nice is that you can customize it to your own taste so easily and because of the simple ingredients you can add other items like black beans or corn. Super!

This is the freshest, most delicious Salsa I have ever made. I added extra chillies and served it chilled. Thanks for a great recipe.

LOVED this Salsa! I'm not usually a big salsa fan, but this was great. I added some freshly cut tomatoes at the end to make it chunkier. Thank you so much for this quick delicious salsa.

Maybe a little less cilantro?

Drain tomatoes to make a thicker salsa.

PERFECT!!!! I followed the recipe exactly and this salsa is better than my fave salsa at my fave Mexican restaurant. My family likes the not-so-chunky salsas so I like using the blender for this. So fresh tasting, no more store-bought salsa for this girl!

I think I made this in less than 10 minutes. It could not be quicker or easier and has a nice freshness that you won't find in jarred salsas due to the onions, garlic and cilantro. I added a bit of Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce to get it up to the heat level I like.

Whether you are using canned or fresh tomatoes, you simply can't go wrong with D's recipe. I've been using it and the family is like "Where'd you buy that salsa?" LOL. If you're using fresh tomatoes I'd go with either beefsteak or roma, but then you have to do the whole skin/seeds/water removal. Just keep in mind, there's something about a stewed tomato that is all about flavor enhancement. Way to go, D, it's a winner!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I had never made salsa before, and this was easy and delicious.  It's very mild, so I will play with the heat by adding some fresh jalapenos next time.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very good!  No changes.  Not spicy due to us using mild chiles...might do medium or hot chiles next time.

I made this for a bunch of Germans at a New Year's Eve party and everyone loved it! I couldn't find the canned, sliced green chilis, but wound up finding a jar of mashed green chilis, so I used just a few spoonfuls of that. It had a great heat and I will definitely make it again.

I was super excited to make this recipe for football Saturday because of the great reviews. I'll tell you that this recipe needs a lot of "doctoring" if you make it as called for. The ingredients have the potential, yet the canned tomato taste is very apparent. Fresh versus canned...there's a reason why chefs use fresh ingredients. The only way I can imagine giving this as a gift is if your friends are bachelors or your family lives on Lean Cuisines.

5 out of 5 stars! The salsa came out EXCELLENT! Jamee suggested Hunt's tomatoes, but I could not find any at my local grocery store so I used Del Monte's. 

Although the salsa came out flawless, I used the wrong canned chilies that came sliced with no seeds. It was not a bad thing because I have family members who can't eat spicy food anymore. Again, thanks for the great recipe!

WOW!  What a great salsa recipe!  The only changes I made were I added half a jalapeno with the seeds which gave it a "medium" spice, which is perfect for my family's taste.  So simple and after it chills for a couple hours it is DELICIOUS!  Thank You!

This is a solid Salsa Recipe to have. Good flavor, not difficult to make at all. I usually use Jalapeno Peppers instead of Green Chiles.

Tried this recipe twice and made a couple of modifications the second time with tastier results. What I did different was drain the stewed tomatoes before putting them in the blender, and I added 3 fresh jalapenos instead of the canned green chiles... this gave it a nice little kick. I would suggest preparing the salsa and letting it sit overnight in the fridge or at least a few hours before you plan on serving it...well worth the wait.

I love that I can quickly make homemade salsa with items that I usually have on hand.  It's also great that I don't have to sit there and dice up a slew of tomatoes. On that note: I used canned diced tomatoes (one Rotel and one Hunts petite diced), drained, and I mixed everything by hand rather than using the blender because I prefer a thicker, chunkier salsa. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this last night for the Super Bowl, and it was AWESOME! Way better than anything I ever bought in the store.

I bought the Del Monte Italian brand of tomatoes (not sure if this made a difference) and drained them first (I think this definitely made a difference).

I also went ahead and used the pulse option in my food processor to keep a tiny bit of onion chunks in there (I did not dice them first but just cut the onion up into "smaller" pieces).

Totally recommend! Will never buy store salsa again!

Wonderful!  Just like our favorite Mexican Restaurant makes.  The only thing I added per the suggestion of one of the other reviewers was 1 teaspoon chili powder.  We'll definitely make this one again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have been using my own version of this recipe for years! I use the Rotel or 1 can of tomatoes with green chiles instead of stewed tomatoes. I also enjoy a Jalepeno (seeded or not), if you enjoy the Tex- Mex. 

 Taste. I enjoy this recipe so much,  that I never buy store bought any more! Tacos, & any Mexican dish taste better with a fresher Salsa.

The second time I tried this I still felt like 'something' was missing. I read where someone suggested using a little chili powder, so I tried it and it helped a LOT!! I also used fresh tomatoes (no substitute for this if you want fresh tasting salsa) and one fresh jalapeno finely diced. I didn't put all of the tomatoes in the blender so I had control over still having some tomatoe chunks :)

as written its only 4 stars. i made it with fresh tomatos from the garden and then followed the recipe exact except i used bottled lime juice instead of fresh lime juice. its extremely mild and took a lot of tinkering around with to get it spicy enough but not too spicy.  i ended up adding 4 seeded jalapenos and 2 whole (seeds and all) some chili powder, cayenne pepper and a little bit of cumin just for a little extra flavor. after 3 days of simmering in the fridge, its now perfect.

Tastes pretty good. I did drain the tomatoes as suggested by other users and I blended mine a lot, because I hate chunky salsa. My only complaint is that it gives me a wicked bad taste in my mouth for an entire day after eating it!! Not sure why this homemade salsa is worse than store bought, but it definitely is not something I'd eat before a date or interview!!

This is my go-to recipe for easy salsa. I really have a hard time buying it from the grocery store shelf anymore after making this recipe many times. It's so fast to make in my Vitamix (just pulse it a few times) and there isn't a lot of chopping to do at all like there is for many homemade salsa recipes. I use Mexican stewed tomatoes to give a little more flavor. If you don't have canned green chiles on hand, I've used chili powder for heat, but it doesn't taste as good as when I've used the green chiles.

I made this with fresh garden tomatoes first and boiled them. Had to add a lot of extra seaoning since it seemed a little bit flat. Still thought it tasted great.

Great salsa!  Make sure to buy a good brand of tomatoes.  I did not use the store brand but another Italian brand and was not satisfied with the taste of the tomatoes.  I also added green onions, an extra clove of garlic, cumin and a little chili powder, a sprinkle of sugar.  So good!

This was absolutely fantastic!! I couldn't believe it- I followed the recipe exactly (my stewed tomatoes were plain wrap brand Italian style) and blended it with a hand food processor to my liking. It was SOOOOO good. This is the real deal- you must try this and don't change anything!!!

I love this recipe! Tastes like fresh salsa from a mexican restaurant. However, I change it up a bit. I personally love cilantro, so I add about half a bunch instead of 3 TB. Also, I buy sliced jalapenos in a jar and add about 7 slices with a tiny bit of juice. It gives it a little extra flavor, but doesn't make it too spicy( i'm not a spicy lover). I make this recipe about 4 times a year and everyone that has tried it loves it and wants the recipe!

This is the best homemade salsa I've ever had.  The only change I made was to use one can of regular Rotel tomatoes and one can of the stewed tomatoes. I like my salsa chunky so I pulsed all the ingredients minus the tomatoes first in my food processor and then drained the canned tomatoes really well before adding them to the mixture.  I pulsed it 3 more times and I had the best salsa.  I love that when you taste it, you taste the tomatoes first, then the cilantro and then the heat shows up.  I received compliments all night at our mexican theme party.  Thanks!

I have been making a salsa similar to this for years and it's the best! The only thing I do different is add 1 serano pepper that has been finely diced for some added heat. I always get compliments and is disappears in a flash even with a double batch.

Very good salsa. I had homemade not to long ago and decided it was WAY better than in the stores, so I looked for a recipe to make it myself.  I also found it to be runny, but I used fresh tomatoes (and probably not the most quality), and I'm pretty new to cooking. Nevertheless, it tasted delicious! I roasted 2 jalapenos and added those, as well as an extra clove of garlic. My boyfriend is his brothers all love it, so this is a keeper!! =]

Delicious!  I made a few modifications, and it came out perfect.  I used 1 can of stewed tomatoes, 1 can of Rotel Mexican Lime & Cilantro blend, and 1 vine ripe tomato.  Then instead of green chiles, I used about a tablespoon of chopped jarred jalapeno peppers.  I'm also certain more garlic and cilantro than the recipe calls for made into my salsa!  Tastes just like my favorite Mexican restaurant!

I didn't have green chiles so I used a whole jalapeno, half seeded.  I love cilantro so added 1/2 cup.  I also added a tsp of chili powder because it was definitely missing something without it.  We liked it at this point, but my teenage son said he thought it still needed Hatch's diced tomatoes and chiles, so I added a heaping TBS of that.  It was really good even before we doctored it to our tastes.  Thanks!

VERY VERY VERY bland. I had to alter the recipe (after following it exactly, then trying other's changes) so much that its not really the same recipe any more! I'd look around for a different recipe before making this one!!

This is very similar to my recipe.  Instead of the green chiles I use 2 fresh jalapenos, threw in some cayenne, chili powder, and red pepper flakes for spice.  The only real problem with this was the cilantro.  I'm not a big fan of it anyway, but 3 tbsp is way too much.  Every bite was overwhelmingly cilantro.  I would suggest 1.5 tbsp max to not drown out the other flavors.  Also - if you experiment with ingredients like I do, don't chop the onion too small otherwise with each pulse of the food processor they get smaller and smaller.  Overall, an excellent recipe!

Long time Allrecipes.com user, first time poster. This recipe deserved me to create an account so I could comment.  I live in Germany, and getting cilantro is really hard. But this week I finally found it and I was so excited! Then I had to search for plain tortilla chips (also very rare here) and when I succeeded, I went directly to Allrecipes.com for a salsa recipe. This recipe seemed good, and it really is.  I LOVE IT!  (Now if only I could get the Germans to be brave enough to try it.)  Thanks so much,  °lytha

The consistency is good, as is the color, but even using Hunts tomatoes (as was rec'd), cumin, and chili powder, it was still too tomato tasting for my taste. It needs something more ... lots more. I ended up adding balsamic vinegar, a lot of cumin and chili powder, some onion powder, garlic powder, and a couple of chilies in adobo sauce before getting it to taste like anything other than "just tomatoes". I'm not sure what the rave reviews are all about. Without all the doctoring I did, this was  plain.

I love this salsa!!  I made a few minor changes however.  First of all I halved the recipe.  I used 1 can of Fire Roasted tomatoes, 1/2 cup white onion, 3 garlic cloves, 2 serranos in addition to the canned green chiles, about 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, 3/4 tsp. kosher salt and probably about 3 Tablespoons cilantro.  I used my food processor: I pulsed the garlic by itself, next I added the 2 serranos (each cut in 4 pieces, and pulsed that, I then added the rest of the ingredients and pulsed until smooth, about 30 seconds.  It was not runny, it was perfect.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner :-)

This salsa is amazing.  So easy, but so good.  I have stopped buying salsa in the store now, and I make this once a week.  I usually use two cans mexican rotello tomatoes and a jalapeno for some kick, omit the garlic, then stick to the recipe.  Pulse for a few quick seconds...done!

This recipe is wonderful! I've made this recipe so many times and it always comes out a little different. I halve the recipe for my hubby and I, and this is my preferred way to make it: I like to use fresh garlic (as opposed to pre-minced) and add a 1/2 jalapeno without seeds, and leave out the diced green chiles (you can sub either one for the other). I always add a 1/2 tsp cumin. A tip: make sure you throw the onion and garlic (and and jalapeno if you like) in the food processor first and chop them up before adding the partially drained tomatoes. That will prevent the extra chunkiness some have had trouble with.

I have had soooooo many compliments on this. EVERYONE wants it! :-) I use DelMonte Mexical flavored stewed tomatoes, 1/2 the garlic, replace the onions with scallions, and add some Jalapenos for spice! Can not seem to make enough! Thank you!

This turns to mush in a blender, USE A FOOD PROCESSOR.  Add extra garlic, a whole lime and hot sauce and this is excellent.  Fire roasted totamoes can be added for extra flavor, too.

Like some of the other reviewers I don't like store bought salsa.  Since this called for canned ingredients, I was very skeptical.  But it turned out great.  Maybe just a little too salty for my taste but over all delicious!  Great cilantro flavor!  I plan on trying it out on my friends who claim to be "salsa experts"! :)

This recipe is awesome. It is my base for salsa experiments. It is great as written here but really lends itself to experimentation, even by a rookie in the kitchen like myself. 
Adding 1/8 cup of sugar with just half of a jalepeno adds a lot of extra zip, I've found. My husband likes it spicier, with no sugar and a whole jalepeno, or even 2. We both agree that a whole lime instead of half and a little extra garlic is a nice variation.
My kids like it. Coworkers like it. I love it. It's a sure thing.

I thought this recipe was really pretty bland, even after I'd added jalapenos, cumin, and chili powder as other reviewers had suggested.  I tried making it two different times with fresh tomatoes and again with the mexican stewed tomatoes as in the recipe.  It actually tasted better with the stewed than the fresh.  I won't be making this again.

This salsa was delicious.  The only modification I made was to use diced tomatos instead of stewed tomatoes.  I have made this in double batches, because I have used it in several other recipes I obtained from this web-site (e.g., Black Bean and Salsa Soup).

Thanks Denise!

I made this about a month ago and did what DONNAINNC did by using the diced tomatoes with the jalapenos already in them, which worked great.  To make it even milder, you could use the one with the green chilies in it instead.  We love cilantro and actually added a little extra.  I used this for tacos and with the extra used it in a beef soup (replacing tomato sauce in the recipe I used) which gave the soup a little mexican twist.  Very tasty.

My husband and I loved this recipe! It tasted so fresh and delicious, I make a batch every week and share it with friends. I was amazed at how easy it is to make. I added a little fresh chopped chile as well as the canned for a little more flavor and that was great too. Thank you D!

Excellent recipe!  I cut out one step and used 2 cans of Rotel instead of the separate cans of tomatoes and chilis.  I also drained the tomatoes for about 10 mins. before I made the salsa.  I never knew canned tomatoes could taste this good!

I loved this salsa!!! I played around with the ingredients a bit, but overall I followed the recipe.  For chips and salsa, don't use the blender too much, because this salsa is a bit liquidy.  The chunky version would be much easier to work with : )

great recipe...i couldnt find fresh cilantro and the grocery store where i shop so i bought a can of rotel with cilantro and added that. i didnt blend the salsa long at all because i like my salsa a little chunky. everyone at a little get together last night thought this salsa was very tasty.

This is an easy and fast salsa to make.  I've always wanted to try making my own (it's now referred to as My Famous Salsa)salsa.  I used one can of Ro-Tel Original Tomatoes (with the juice) and one can of stewed tomatoes (drained) and added a fresh roasted jalepano pepper.

This salsa is so easy to make and tastes wonderful. I've made it 3 times now. The last time I made it I left the cilantro out and used fresh basil instead and added a jalapeno pepper.Everyone loved it.

This was the 1st time I made salsa from scratch so I had an issue with using the canned stewed tomatoes..it seemed like cheating. Well, tough!! It turned out great! I also used a can of plain stewed and a can of Mexican style tomatoes, and 1/2 a can of diced jalapenos and extra cilantro. ALso a few peeled, diced/seeded roma tomatoes to make me feel better. It's a wonderful recipe; thanks for sharing it!

Worked well on the first try.  The amount of cillantro really changes the flavor of the recipe so use it with discretion - more is not always better!  Will make this again.

I never buy salsa anymore.  I just whip up a batch of this every other week!  I do lots of alterations, though.  I blend together onion, garlic, lime juice, salt, cilantro, and added jalepenos in a blender.  Then I pulse chiles and diced tomatoes for a nice chunky taste.  I love that I can make it just the way hubby likes it!

My husband couldn't get enough of this.  He ate the whole recipe by himself.  I had really strong white onions and I think a red onion might be a bit milder next time.  He's said it's better than store bought and it tastes similar to the salsa from a mexican food place here.

Fantabulous recipe!  Very easy and quick to mix up.  I made it for my Housewarming Party and everyone wanted the recipe.  The flavor is wonderful and I loved the consistency.  Some wanted it hotter, so I may add more jalepenos next time.  Definitely recommend!

This is a great recipe!  A blender produced the mos satisfying texture.  Very easy and tasty.  If you have been looking for a great tasting salsa that does not require fresh tomatoes, this is the one.  One batch is enough for a small party.

This salsa is NUMMY!  I think it would be good with fresh jalepenos, too, but it's nice to keep the peppers in a can for anytime.  Very easy to make, and nice & easy to adjust to taste.

This was pretty good. I was worried that it might be a bit bland so I used Mexican stewed tomatoes (with jalapeños, garlic and chili’s), I added a bit less onion and a bit more cilantro, salt and garlic. Delicious. My only complaint is it did taste a bit canned instead of fresh so next time I might do 1/2 canned tomatoes and 1/2 fresh.

I've made this recipe with some modifications and I love it! Very simple to make especially if you use a food processor. 

I substituted a few of the ingredients:

Green Chilies - Replaced with sliced jalapeño peppers
1/2 lime - 1 tbsp of lemon juice OR 1/2 lime juiced (turned out great both ways)
Stewed Tomatoes - Used canned diced tomatoes.

I used the canned tomatoes because I have quite a few cans that are supposedly past the "best by" date and it has worked out great. When I run out of those I will try it with the stew tomatoes and see how I like it. But fantastic recipe!

Love this salsa or to be exact my son and daughter-in-law loved it.  Unfortunately I made it entirely too hot for me and my husband.  Next time I'll go a bit lighter on the jalapenos but the flavor was great. I had made a half recipe, which is still quite a bit and my son had consumed it all within six days.

I did make one minor change as I used organic garlic paste versus chopped as I liked that better.  And, yes I also did NOT use a generic brand as that is the MOST important ingredient!  I also did not use all the liquid drained and added back to determine thickness as I like it more chunky.  Was delicious and I did use ground celery seed instead of salt.  Was perfect!

I've made this several times.  I got the best results with Muir Glen San Marzano style fire roasted tomatoes and Hatch green chiles.  I used one medium Vidalia onion, two cans (4 oz. each) of the chiles and the juice of one small lime.  Plus the garlic, salt and cilantro as specified.  I pulse the onion, garlic and cilantro until they are the consistency I like.  Then I add the other ingredients (I do not drain the tomatoes) and pulse just until blended.   I have to process slightly longer with whole tomatoes than diced - but it has never been runny.

But this was delicious even with regular tomatoes and green chiles.   My husband prefers this with regular not fire roasted tomatoes.

I used jalapeños instead of green chiles and used a blender. Best salsa I've had in a long time.

Used 1 jalapeno and 1 can of diced tomatoes.... Yummy - To make it spicier, use more jalapenos or another spicier chili pepper.

There's something missing here. I don't know whether the lime drowned out some of the spice. Probably won't try again.

Really good. I've never made salsa before, but know what I like in a salsa. I used a 28 oz. box of finely chopped tomatoes, which I drained as some had recommended, but now I wish I hadn't, as the salsa came out thicker than I expected. And, I didn't have chiles, so I used one fresh jalepeno (next time I will just use half of one).  Other than that, I followed to the letter, and am very happy with it.

I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, but the fresh tomatoes just don't have enough tomato flavor. I might try to go half and half next time... 1 can of diced tomatoes and the rest as fresh diced. It is a good recipe, not great... needs a bit more zip to it. Maybe some hot sauce?

Just like everyone else said, it was great, simple, easy and quick! I blended half of it and gave it a try, after doing so I added a bit more lime, salt, and garlic. Then also added some crushed red pepper, and sliced jalapenos to give it a little more kick. Then blended the whole batch together and it is just great! It is similar to my favorite local mexican restaurants salsa as well.

This salsa is incredible! I used ingredients that I had on hand so I modified slightly. I used my tomatoes that I had canned last summer and garlic in a jar. I didn't have any green chile's but I did have a can of Rotel so I added that. Taste was so amazing.

Amazing!  And the more lime the better. I had 2 cups left over and used it as the base for mexican rice.  I added a tbsp of knorr chicken bullion. Sauteed 1 cup white rice in 1 tsp vegetable oil, then added the salsa and cooked until it was boiling. Then tossed the lid on and threw it in a 300 degree oven for 1 hour.  It was amazing.  Served it to an owner of a mexican restaurant and he was impressed!

I thought this was a very good and easy recipe. I had to leave out the green chiles because I was with people who don't like any heat. I will be sure to add it the next time I make this.

Great and simple salsa recipe. I strained my tomatoes of as much of the juice as I could to avoid a runny salsa. I added half a jalapeno to mine and per other review recommendations, used non-generic canned stewed tomatoes.  Make sure you check for seasoning after you mix the ingredients, mine needed a bit more salt. This recipe is a keeper.

Great recipe that I made a few tweaks to. After making the salsa I add one 14.5oz can of corn, drain it completely, then stir it in. It adds some texture and crunch. I've also started adding 1/4 cup of Tequila to the salsa, getting good reviews on this tweak from family and friends. Add it in after as well, mix it very thoroughly. Note, this will make the salsa more "soupy" so I drain some of the liquid from the tomatoes before adding them.

Also to save time, I just throw everything but the tomatoes in the processor first, give it a few pulses to dice up the cilantro and onion, then add tomatoes. No reason to dice them up first, let the machine do the work. A great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I think the consistency of this salsa was perfect.  After reading other posts, I drained only one can of tomatoes, and I don't even think I needed to.  Also, someone else suggested adding sugar.  I'm so glad I didn't follow that advice.  This salsa is already too sweet for my taste, which is why I didn't give it a 5. I love cilantro, so I would definitely add more.  I'm still on my search for the perfect salsa, so I probably won't make this again.

Made this for my 10 year old. He wanted it smooth! It tasted great. I used fresh 9 Roma's and gutted them to make the salsa less runny for the smooth blending. I used my hand held blender, at the end, to get it the right consistency.

This is an excellent salsa recipe. I have made it several different ways, and it is honestly hard to mess up.    Our favorite version uses A. fresh, summer tomatoes from the garden, but if those are not available, I use Mexican seasoned canned tomatoes-name brand only. B. I also add about 1/2 cup of green onions for a fresher taste, and C. 1/4-1/2 cup of canned jalapenos, or two fresh ones-for a little kick. D. Then I add about 1 tsp of cumin and E. 1 tsp of sugar. We like ours a little chunky so I only pulse in the food processor for about 5 seconds. Absolutely perfect Texas salsa.   Thank you, Denise, for sharing with all of us!!

Delicious!  I used fresh tomatoes rather than canned and no chilies because my family does not like anything hot, and it was wonderful!

As written, I'm giving this recipe 3 out of 5 stars. It's a good base recipe but not very spicy or flavorful. We used this recipe a second time but added 1 tsp each of chili powder and cumin. Also substituted 4 jalapenos (two whole and two seeded) for the green chiles and squeezed in the juice of a whole lime. These changes jazzed it up somewhat but we may experiment with different types of peppers next time.

Surprisingly good for mostly canned ingredients! I also added a few dashes of Tabasco and some chile powder.

Used regular canned plum tomatoes, 1 fresh jalapeno, and happened to have some homemade marinated jalapenos as well.  Everything else according to the recipe, except I didn't have cilantro, so I used parsley (I know it's a sacrilege).  Overall very very good even at first taste.  Can't wait to see how it is after sitting in the fridge for a while.

This is a bland, mild base recipe from which to juggle ingredients to your particular taste. Plan on using the entire onion, a lot more garlic, most of the bunch of cilantro, more lime juice (or vinegar, but why not have the vitamin C), and if you want heat, lots more peppers. And use fresh peppers, they're terrific, have no salt, and make the flavor pop. If you're trying for restaurant-style salsa, do plan on adding the cilantro, and lots of it. I used the entire bunch in mine (which is why it's so green - if you want the cilantro flavor but not the color, use the stems instead of the leaves.) Thanks for the recipe!

Great salsa! A suggestion: I did not blend the ENTIRE batch. I blended half of it, and left the other half as it was. Turned out GREAT...still nice and chunky, but with enough 'juice' to make it go further and add a bit more depth to the salsa.       I also used fresh (peeled and seeded) tomatoes, but come wintertime, I will used canned ones. I did have to substitute dried cilantro...sadly. It was delicious, but fresh cilantro is phenomenal.  Great recipe!

Really good!!! Yay for not having to cut up fresh tomates. I always end up making such a mess when I have to. I used rotel instead of the green chiles and tomatoes. I also added a bit of sugar and cumin (personal preference). I like to pulse the cilantro, garlic, and lime juice first. Then I add the chopped onions and rotel and pulse more and season to taste. To me this yields the perfect consistency.

Wow, just finished making this and I was surprised at just how great it was. I just wanted to taste it to check the seasoning before I put it in the fridge to chill but I had a hard time stopping the "tasting" b/c it is soooo good. All this from a girl who thought she would only ever make fresh salsa with fresh tomatoes! I was so wrong! The stewed tomatoes are great in this salsa. I added extra fresh cilantro, garlic, and a teaspoon of chili powder. SO GOOD! It may be better than my favorite Mexican restaurant. Can't wait to have more at dinner. Thanks!

Really great and so easy recipe.  Not quite enough heat for me.  I'm going to add canned jalapenos next time, rather than the chiles.  I also added the whole bunch of cilantro.  I don't like chunky salsa, so this is perfect.  It came together in about five minutes and tasted better after a day or two in the fridge.  I think I'll make up another batch for Father's Day.  Thanks for sharing.

I made the recipe EXACTLY as described.  I didn't add any personal twists to it, as then it wouldn't be the featured recipe.  OH MY GOODNESS!  This is so amazingly delicious and inexpensive to make for any event or eating daily.  I say daily because you will find ways to incorporate this fresh taste into any dish.  I wouldn't change a thing...the recipe is perfect as is.  There's an old saying - if it's not broke, don't fix it.  This doesn't need fixed at all.  It's absolutely delicious and incredibly fresh tasting.  My all time favorite!

UPDATE: MY FIANCE AND I SNACKED ON TORTILLA CHIPS AND LEFTOVER SALSA FOR DINNER LAST NIGHT (WE WERE HUNGRY, BUT NOT FOR A FULL MEAL). I MUST ADMIT, I LIKE THIS BETTER NOW THAN I DID BEFORE. IT'S STILL SOMEWHAT SWEET, BUT NOT NEARLY AS SWEET AS I REMEMBER. IT ALSO THICKENED UP A BIT. I really enjoyed this. A little tomatoey-sweet (my fiance's #1 gripe), but good nonetheless. I'm not a super spicy salsa fan, but I do like some heat. D's salsa is VERY mild (that's a good thing if you're feeding kiddos, I guess...). Oh well, I'll just be sure to up the heat factor next time! I have been making a similar salsa recipe for years. It calls for 2 (14.5 oz.) cans of chunky pasta-style tomatoes (i.e. Hunt's), a couple of green onions instead of a yellow one, lemon instead of lime juice, a little more cilanto (1/4 c.), an entire 4 oz. can of (diced) green chiles (as opposed to 1/4 c. worth) and a tad of pepper instead of salt. My stand-by recipe doesn't call for pureeing though - it's meant to be a "chunky" salsa. I like both versions and will continue to use each one depending on my mood. :) Note: There is no need to chop anything before adding it to your food processor or blender. Just quarter (or halve if it's small) your onion and toss your cilantro leaves (sans the stems) in with your tomatoes, etc. and let your appliance do the work for you! That's what it's for anyways, right?!!?!? Thank you, for sharing, Denise. I'm very happy to have stumbled upon your recipe! :-)

This is the easiest, best tasting salsa ever.  I have been using it for years since I bought and Allrecipe.com cookbook that it was in.  I do add jalapenos to taste, a whole onion and don't measure anything since I've made it so much.

This so good and so easy!! I've made it many times and I love it.  I use hot sliced jalapeño peppers (from a jar) instead of green chilies. Tastes as good or better than our local mexican resturant. I'll never buy salsa again!

2015 update: years later and still using this recipe. The only addition is to stir in cilantro after blending. I was right, I never have bought salsa again since finding this recipe. Thanks D.

***UPDATE - Changed from 3 starts to 5. The HuGE difference was to use canned whole tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes. My husband said this is now perfect! Wooo hooo!*** 
I followed recipe exactly. I am a sugar aholic but this was way to sweet even for me. I then looked at other reviewers and added 1 tsp chili powder and 1 tsp garlic powder. It was better but decided to try 1 tsp cumin- big mistake. Very strong cumin flavor so added another 1 tsp chili powder. Overall this is still super sweet. I think this could be a very good recipe with some tweaking. Thank goodness all of the ingredients combined didn't cost but a few dollars.

Pretty good. I used a higher end canned tomato that I think was too sweet for this recipe, and I needed to add quite a bit of hot sauce to spice things up. Still, a good recipe to play around with.

This salsa is fantastic! I made a few modifications. I used 2 med. sized jalepenos instead of the canned green chiles, about a 1/2 c. cilantro, dehydrated minced garlic, and I ommited the lime juice since I don't like the flavor it adds.  It tastes wonderfully fresh!

This was one of the easiest homemade salsas I've ever made. I drained the cans of tomatoes and used 2 fresh jalapenos instead of the chiles. I also used a little more onion than it called for. Just pulsed it 3 or 4 times and it was a perfect consitency! It definitely tastes like restaurant salsa (not sure if that is a good or bad thing) but I got a ton of complements on it when I served it at my superbowl party.

Love this salsa! I was nervous about using the canned stewed tomatoes b/c I have always used fresh but it turned out wonderful! I used Hunts tomatoes bc someone said store brand didn't turn out as well. I did follow some other users advice and added a jalepeno, garlic and only put it in the food processor for a few seconds. Sooooo yummy! I also drained the tomatoes.

**I've made this a few times now. Last time I used diced tomatoes instead of the stewed and it was very very bland. Ended up throwing half of it away. Use the stewed tomatoes and you won't be dissapointed!**

Very good but very mild. Next time I will roast a few jalapenos and throw them in.

we have been making this recipe for years and i have not written a review yet(not good)    this recipe for salsa in our all time favorites.  i have used fresh and canned toms depending on what we have on hand. we dont think it makes that big of a taste differance. i use a small food processer to do the work.  we always use extra cilantro, onion, garlic, and salt.  its best if you let it set overnight for the best flavor.  it seems to keep for a long time as well.  try the salsa chicken from allrecipes.com with this salsa and serve it with the spanish rice II and you got yourself a yummy meal.  be prepared for lots on great comments.   thanks for sharing .

I followed the recipe and used 7-10 fresh salsa tomatoes.  The only thing I changed (which gave it just the right kick) was using 1/2 poblano pepper and 1 whole serano pepper choppped in it.  Delicious!

I made this salsa yesterday. I did alter it a bit. I used 2 cans diced tomatoes. I left out the cilantro. Instead of green chiles, I used 1 jalapeno and 2 serrano chiles. The recipe didn't say what kind of onion so I used a red onion. It was sooo good.

This is a GREAT salsa recipe- canned chiles are good, but try it with two (or more) fresh jalapenos instead!

I followed the directions and the stewed tomato's were really over powering and it was awful. I ended up throwing it out and making regular salsa with fresh tomato's.

Sooo Easy! But Do Add extra Cilantro And 1 Or 2 Fresh Chilis. I Strained Off Some Juice (Good Idea but save it)I Will Not Buy "Store Bought" Ever again. -Hornblower ..... PS - Add More Diced Fresh Tomato And Onion After Blending For A Chunkier Salsa !!

I've now made this recipe too many times to count and everyone still loves it. I think it tastes exactly like the salsa you get at restaurants, maybe even better! For the most part I follow the recipe and I did like the other reviewers said and I strained out some of the excess juice from the tomatoes because for some people it's a bit too much. Occasionally I'll add a jalapeno because my boyfriend loves them and I find it gives it a nice and fresh spicy flavor. It goes great with any type of Mexican or Spanish dish. I'll be using this recipe for a very long time, thanks for such a great post!

I used fresh Roma tomatoes instead of stewed, upped the garlic, reduced the onion by a little (the proportion of onion to tomato seemed too high), and took pounds of this salsa to a beach trip for 10 women.  It was a huge hit and disappeared the first day.  I also kept it chunky instead of blending and drained some of the liquid, since the fresh tomatoes were very juicy.  All the changes worked well.

This recipe was amazing.  We had an office contest for best salsa and I won with this recipe!  It was so easy.  I tweaked it a bit and used 2 small cans of diced tomatoes with green chilis already in them and about 1/3 of a large can of diced tomatoes roasted with garlic.  I also put a tablespoon of sugar in it.  Everyone at my office raved about how good it was...restaurant style.

The best salsa.  I have a lady that I work with, who is Mexican.  She always brings in homemade salsa and I have tried to duplicate it, but never can.  I also think she doesnt give us the full recipe details for a reason, haha. Anyway, this is so so super close!  Hubby said dont change a THING he loved it, perfect.  I did use the Hunts Stewed tomatoes, and did drain them, I reserved some liquid, but didnt need it at all.  Other than that I followed the recipe exceot sub'd a whole, large, jalapeno for the can of chilies.  It was HOT but so good!  Probably never buy store bought again either! Thanks D!

This salsa was great and so easy to make! I must admit I was a little leery about using canned tomatoes. I have made the full-on version (blanching and peeling tomatoes, etc.) but decided to give this recipe a whirl after reading the reviews. It actually tasted better than the recipe that took an hour and a half to make. I'm making it again this weekend for a get-together.

Quick easy and fresh tasting. I added a 1/2 tsp of sugar and would taste even better using fresh tomatoes rather than canned, but this is quick!

I have made this recipe twice within the last two days. My family loves it.  Instead of the green chiles, I use one jalapeno pepper (seeds and all) to spice it up.  This one is a keeper.

Wow! I use this site on a weekly basis but have never written a review before. This salsa was so good, I just had to write something! I too was skeptical as I have tried many different salsa recipes using fresh tomatoes and have never had success. I would often just break down and buy the Whole Foods brand. No more!  This salsa was so simple and inexpensive to prepare and it tastes so fresh that there is no need to shell out $6 for a small container of salsa again. I didn't alter the ingredients in the recipe - but did drain the tomatoes, dumped everything into a bowl and used my immersion blender to mix - no mess. I also let it sit in the fridge overnight so the flavors could meld. Try this one. You won't regret it!

Great - I use 1/2 red onion though, add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, 1 fresh chilli minced finely, only 1 can of tomatoes and a little less the cilantro - add freshly ground black pepper too.  I don't put it in the food processor either - just mix it up 'cause I like my salsa chunky!

A great base salsa! However, I did modify slightly...I used fresh tomatoes from the garden, 3 cloves fresh minced garlic, skipped the green chilis and added a chopped jalepeno, red onion as well as a vidalia and used fresh corn (right off the cob!). I also used a whole lime instead of 1/2 and added a bit more fresh cilantro then the recipe called for. I ended up making 2 batches, one with corn and one without! GREAT recipe, thank you!!

This salsa was a little too sweet tasting for me.  Maybe it was the stewed tomatoes I used...not sure.  I tried just adding more jalapeno and ended up with the whole spicy sweet flavor.  Tasted a little too much like picante sauce.

I love how easy it is to make!  Its also great having a recipe that uses ingredients that you already have.  I did leave out the peppers (since I didn't have any)and added more garlic, and it still turned out great.  I do want to try it sometime with fresh tomatoes as well!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I followed others suggestions and used mexican stewed tomatoes and added a fresh jalapino.  It was a bit "chipotle" sweet for me but it did have a kick to it.  Next time I think I'll try usuing whole tomatoes.  UPDATE:  Not great for my tastes as written with the stewed tom but used fresh garden tomatoes, blanched, peeled and crushed, then add the other ingredients = YUM!!  My "go to" recipe to use up all my summer tomatoes!!  bumping up the rating to 4 with these changes!

Great salsa recipe!!  I used fresh tomatoes from the garden (so added a pinch of sugar) and doubled the garlic and cilantro.  I also used a whole pablano pepper in place of the green chilis.  It was quick, delish and so easy!  Thank you!

I love this salsa -hard to believe it's made from canned tomatoes.  I must say that you really need to make it at least several hours before you want to use it (and even better to make the day before).  I tried it right after I made it last time and thought it tasted terrible but within a few hours tasted wonderful.

This is the easiest salsa I have ever made.  It is very delicious exactly as recipe suggests.  My second batch was made with lemon instead of lime and I think I like that even better.

Very easy to put together, always a plus! It turned out sweet so I added 2 serrano peppers and 1 jalapeno. I have made this many times. Since the tomatoes are stewed it always comes out a little too sweet. I always use pretty much the whole bunch of cilantro and add some cumin. So much better than salsa from the jar!

I assembled this in the morning, so it can sit in the fridge during the day. I tried it already, and it's fabulous.I didn't run it through the blender because we like our salsa chunky. 
I'm not buying salsa mix again. This is perfect.
EDITED: I now use one can small diced tomatoes and one regular. I run the regular tomatoes through the blender for a rough chop with half the onion, cilantro, garlic, lime juice and a tbsp. of brown sugar. I then fold that into the reserved small dice tomatoes. It's got the perfect consistancy. I will NEVER buy salsa again.

Absolutely wonderful!  I double the batch and use twice as much lime as called for.  Someone mentioned not to blend for too long - I agree.  About 30 seconds is almost too long.  WONDERFUL recipe!

When I tried this salsa the day I prepared it, I was extremely disappointed. I certainly didn't want it to go to waste, so I threw it in the refrigerator for somebody else to eat. Days later when I ran out of my "fancy" store-bought salsa, I reluctantly went back to this recipe - I was absolutely astonished by the improvement in taste. This salsa really is phenomenal. The lesson here: let it chill for a few days before you judge it.

This is the 3rd time I have made this.  No more chopping and dicing for this girl.  Hubby loves it, the neighbors love it and I can make it in 1/4 the time as my old recipe.  My changes no chilies, 2 fresh jalapenos, 1 Tbs chili powder.  We'll see how my gfs like it later today.

Agreed this is a fabulous recipe! However I agree with other users there are a few modifications that are a must! 
Add fresh tomatoes along with the canned tomatoes. Buy Mexican canned tomatoes versus regular (you may or may not need the jalapanos depending how hot you want it).  I added 1/2 cup of cucumbers - makes it very fresh. The sugar is nice way to cut down on the acid of the tomatoes, I also added a splash of red wine. Either way wonderful recipe!

Was good but could use a little more spice- maybe some jalepenos. Liked it though and served it with fish.

This recipe deserves 10 stars...absolutly delicious! I am eating it as we speak and it is better the next day. The only modification I made is I used 1 can stewed and 1 can diced tomatoes. I also added two jalapenos without seeds and omitted the canned green chilies. I will be making this all the time and thank you so much for sharing.

I made two batches of this salsa, one using the canned tomatoes and one using fresh roma tomatoes, and suprisingly the canned tomato salsa tasted better!  I also added chili powder and a fresh jalepeno without the seeds.  I also layered the salsa in the blender so that when I blended for only a few seconds, all the ingredients would be blended evenly without certain items being too blended or others not blended at all.  Will make again soon!

This was great for a quick and easy salsa!  I did add some chopped jalapenos in it to give it a little heat.  This is a keeper for when Im craving some fresh salsa and dont want to have to put a lot of work into it.

What a hit...followed the recipe exactly, except added extra cilantro and garlic.  Make sure you dice the onion extra small.  Awesome flavor, better than any store bought I've ever had.  Worthy of 6 stars!

This was delicious! I doubled the recipe and used two cans stewed and two cans diced tomatoes. I added chili powder and a couple of fresh roma tomatoes. Next time I will add a couple of jalapenos for more kick but this recipe is great as is for a party since it wasn't too spicy. Amazing fresh taste - will definitely be making this again and again!

Famous it is- fantastic salsa and everyone loved it.  I ended up throwing it into a medium-sized pot and cooking it on low for about 45 minutes to better blend the flavors and it was amazing!!! I would also just add some chili pepper to taste.

This recipe was awesome! I took the advise of switching to lemon juice, adding 1 tsp chilli powder and cut up 2 chille peppers and left overnight. I will never buy salsa again! thanks for the tips. Dana

This is such good salsa.  Completely restaurant quality.  If you're a cilantro lover like myself, I recommend adding a bunch of cilantro in there (the way you buy it at the store), along w/extra minced garlic.  So good, and so easy to prepare.  Received rave reviews from partygoers at my niece's graduation party!

First I would like to thank Denise for posting this recipe and all the reviews that gave some GREAT suggestions.  I tripled almost everything except for the tomatoes and green chilis.  Tripled = garlic, lime juice, cilantro, onion, and added 1 tsp cayenne pepper and 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper.  CAN'T WAIT TO MAKE IT AGAIN!!

LOVE this salsa! It's perfect. I've made it several times already. Can't get enough. I'd been looking for a salsa similar to my fave restaurants, because I hate jarred salsa but wanted good stuff at home. 

When I make this, I made according to recipe, but add several chopped fresh jalapeno's and a few fresh tomatos in addition. I love fresh and spicy.

This was excellent! I used whole canned tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes.  I made a spicy and a mild version, and both were good.  For the spicy version, I used 5 fresh habeneros, seeds and all, which made it as intensely spicy (you have been warned) but still enjoyable (in other words, I didn't have to stop after two chips).  For the mild version, I used 2 or 3 fresh jalepenos, seeds and white parts removed, which turned out to be incredibly mild to me, but to my mom, who can't tolerate much spice, it was about as much as she would want.  

Good basic recipe; I'd recommend experimenting with different kinds of fresh hot peppers (not canned) until you get it as spicy as you like it.  Wear gloves when working with the peppers, though.  You do not want to find out what it feels like to get pepper residue in your eye, and I'm told that washing your hands won't necessarily get the pepper off...

Next time I'm going to make double or triple batches and freeze some.  This was really good stuff; I can't ever find salsa that's as spicy as I like it, and this stuff hapens to taste a million times better than the stuff you buy in the store, too.

Great recipe.  I used fresh tomatoes.  Also, I found adding 1 tbsp. of tomato paste adds that hearty tomato flavor you're used to with prepared salsa.

A really great basic recipe that you can adjust to your personal preference.  I used one can reg stewed tomatoes, one mexican stewed tom. and added green onion. It was a big hit.

This salsa is great! I get compliments every time I make it. So fast and easy!
Hint---leave in fridge for at least 5 hours to meld the flavors and get the best taste!

Best salsa ever!  It's fresh and has great depth.  I used two cans of petite diced tomatoes (slightly drained) and diced one jalapeno pepper instead of the canned chiles.  Instead of chips 'n salsa, it was salsa and anything we could find to dip in it. For best results, refrigerate overnight. Yum!

this recipe was good, but i prefer the taste of fresh tomatoes or even just canned ones (non stewed). i added jalepeno's to give it some kick, but then ended up with too much "green" chili factor, so i'd cut back on the chilis next time.

AMAZING!  It's so good I even had it for breakfast one day.  I made this recipe for around 100 teens and college age students and they couldn't get enough of it!  Since then I've made three more super size batches.  Now friends are so excited we they see it's part of the menu.  Thanks D.  You made me a great cook!
I did add a jalapeno to give it a little kick.

This is a really good, easy recipe. I've made several times.  But I had to take out the canned green chilies, too bland, it needed some kick, so add 2 jalapenos to the processor. This salsa lasts longer than most fresh salsas because of the canned tomatoes. It's still just as good a day or 2 later.

Delicious! I didn't have canned chili peppers so I threw in some green pepper and some canned jalepenos. This added the little kick of heat I was looking for! I also added about a 1/2 tsp of brown sugar at the end, which brings out the flavours even better.  Can't wait for my hubby to try this...I know he's going to love it. Thanks D!

This is a great salsa recipe. I used scallions instead of onion. Everyone loved it. Then I added some of the salsa to a mashed avacado plus some lemon and lime juice. Awsome guacamole!

I took this salsa to a Christmas party, and it was a hit.  Everyone kept asking me for the recipe.  And the best part about it was that it was so easy to make.  The only constructive comments that I received was that it was not spicy enough.  I thought it was great for my taste, but the crowd that was there liked really spicy things.  This can easily be adjusted in the recipe.  Overall, it was great!

I have always wanted to find a great salsa recipe that is easy and tastes as much like authentic Mexican salsa as possible.  I certainly found it here.  This surpassed my expectations, and I'd suggest to anyone that you try it.  Very easy to make and tastes MUCH better than any store-bought salsa you'll find.

This was my first homemade salsa attempt, and it is yummy!  Based on other reviews I  1) added 3 fresh roma tomatos - ok, made it taste REALLY tomato-y 2) only used 1 tbsp cilantro - good, still has a strong cilantro flavor 3) added half a jalepeno and a bit of chili powder - good, but should have added more 4) drained the stewed tomatos - good, it still turned out a bit runny.  Altogether, good tasting salsa and easy.

This is a great salsa as is. I think it can be made better with some personal touches, but it is GREAT for doing just that! Add whatever you like that you have enjoyed in other salsas (minced carrot for example, adds a slightly sweet, crunchy quality). But having said that, I repeat; this really IS a great salsa as is.

Wow! Quick and easy, and it really does taste great! Made precisely as the recipe is written (I did pour the extra juice off the tomatoes before adding them), I would consider the salsa mild. I added a whole finely diced habanero pepper to it and wham! Nice and spicey.

This was quite good.  Company enjoyed it.  I think next time though, I'll use fresh tomatoes.  I also added jalepeno peppers for extra zip.

Greetings fellow salsa enthusists!  This recipie is wonderful.  I have used fresh from my garden tomatoes as well as stewed.  I canned 19 pints about 8 weeks ago and I am down to 8 pints.  Everyone I give them to comes back for more.  We love it!  Thanks for sharing Denise.

This recipe was amazing!  I made it for a Mexican dinner party 2 nights ago and my guests loved it...there was nothing left and they were cleaning the bowl.  No wonder this is famous D! I will make this again and again...

Really great recipe!!  I also used Del Monte mexican style stewed tomatoes and increased the cilantro to 1/2 a bunch- no need to snip off leaves- just throw all in the blender.  Pour into a quart jar- I have given out as gifts- everyone loves them and I live in TX also. Thanks for a really good and easy recipe!!

Really good salsa...better than what comes out of a jar for sure!  I used an entire small can of chopped green chilies...the recipe wasn't spicy enough.  I will make this again.

Good, mild salsa.  Not a spectacular salsa (I eat a lot of salsa), but it was easy to make.

this deserves A MILLION STARS!! This is wonderful!!! I usually make homeade salsa from my mother, and thought I would venture out and boy did i pick a winner! I loved this! Used mexican stewed tomatoes.  I have tried many salsa's living in Texas and this is by far the best!!! Put in blender on low and I kept an eye on it so it was chunky! Thanks so much denise!

I liked how fast it was but using the ingredients listed I thought it tasted very canned.  So I added, two whole tomatoes, another tsp of garlic, salt and pepper and two fresh jalapanos with the seeds.  This made it a lot "fresher" tasting.

Wonderful recipe! I'm overwhelmed with tomatoes from my garden so started looking on this site for salsa. Great for canning too. I took the advice of some other reviews and didn't process but a few seconds.  Great salsa!

My husband and I adore this salsa, as does our 2-year-old daughter! It is very similar to the kind of salsa served at local Mexican cafes, but it's fun to make at home! Wonderful snack, or you can do what we like to at our house--- devour a bowl with a big bag of Tostitos, and call it dinner. YUM-MY!

So easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except I added 1/2 cup of chilis.  Next time I will add some jalapeno peppers to give it a bit more of a kick!  Thanks!!!

Very tasty salsa. I did it 3 times already. Last time I gave my boyfriend a huge jar, so he can have salsa whenever he wants. Still so good after a week in the fridge.

Easy enough to make but I must have done something wrong because I thought the taste was pretty bad and I have never tasted a bad salsa before.  My husband took a bowl of it to work with him and most of it came back.  I will not make this again

I really enjoyed this salsa.  I am a salsa addict and now I know that making my own can be soooo easy!  I added jalepeno's instead of the chiles and that added extra kick.  Thank you for the recipe!

Have been making this recipe forever.  Made a change however.....I add one jar of Pace medium picante to the recipe.  It provides that slow roasted pepper flavor that I love and don't often get with fresh homemade salsa.

Salsa was good although I prefer alot more chunk.  Next time I will probably add peppers, corn, black beans, etc. after I blend the base ingredients together.  My husband, on the other hand, loved the consistency.

This is very good.  Needs a few jalapenos.  We added a little chili powder as one reviewer did, but it overpowered the salsa taste.  Overall, recommended!

ab fab!  this was so easy and even better than restaurant salsa and i am a strict salsa judge!  fresh cilantro MUST be used (i usually add more).  1/2 can (6 oz)of chiles makes this recipe easier.  i add recommended lime juice but usually add more after i taste test it!

This recipe is great!  I much rather this method than the time consuming boiling routine.  I used diced tomatoes w/ out spice and added extra garlic.  I also added extra jalapenos by popular demand.

I loved this recipe except I tweaked it a little.  I used only one can of stewed tomatoes, blended those and chopped up 1 reg tomato and left everything else chopped up and chunky.  This recipe had all the right blend of everything.  Even my 3 yo loved it.

Fantastic!!!  I made this for gifts and kept a jar for my family as well!  Everyone loved it and we're picky salsa folks.  The only alteration I made was to add some jalapeno pepper (to taste).  The cilantro was definitely what made all the difference!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I loved this salsa and it was very easy.  I made it for Xmas.  Everyone enjoyed it - however, some people wanted more spice.  Next time I will split the recipe and add more spices in half of the salsa.

I was very skeptical... Couldn’t imagine how this would be successful with canned tomatoes. But it was delicious, rave reviews from all and my Texan husband has requested that I make it weekly?.

I read the reviews before making & I'm glad I did. I cut the recipe in half since I only had one can of whole tomatoes and drained them as suggested by another reviewer. I also put in one diced boiled jalapeno & Serrano pepper, this salsa Is delicious.  This salsa has the right amount of heat, I can't stop eating it..

Great base. I used the Publix brand diced tomatoes with chilies. Minced garlic from jar, half onion, chili powder and a little fresh lemon and lime juice as recommended from other reviewers. Would definitely recommend to drain the canned tomatoes. Great recipe will definitely be making again and again.

I was very excited to make this considering all of the positive reviews, but was very disappointed by the outcome. Using canned stewed tomatoes made it grossly sweet and the lack of spices ensured it to be bland. Also blending stewed tomatoes resulted in a watery mess. 
I had to add plentiful amounts of cayenne pepper, chili powder, black pepper, cumin and jalapenos in order to get my family to even come near it. I honestly have ZERO idea how this recipe is not only called "famous" but has sooo many 5 star reviews.

Super quick and easy!! It tastes way better than store bought.  It makes quite a bit for under 5 bucks.(I did already have garlic and lime juice on hand however)!  Thanks for sharing!

I used whole canned tomatoes instead, and with an immersion blender I was able to get the right consistency. Very tasty and is not so salty as store-bought salsas! Thank you.

I made this with one large can of tomatoes. I added an entire Serrano pepper and half a jalapeno pepper, using half the seeds/veins from the Serrano. I added more garlic (I always do). It came our great. 4 stars for canned peppers... fresh is better.

I would say 3 stars as is, 4 stars with the substitutions that I made and still a little room for improvement. I will show my substitutions below along with what I will also change the next time to improve it more.

1. I used a Mexican (medium heat) tomato sauce in place of the stewed tomatoes. Next time I will use fresh Roma tomatoes to add a more fresh garden flavor
2. I used 1 fresh garlic clove in place of minced garlic, I may add a bit more garlic next time.
3. I used 1/2 jalapeno (seeds in) in place of canned green chiles (i hate canned chiles). This gave it a mild spice which works for my wife and kids. I am going to make a more spicy one next time with 2 jalapenos or maybe Serrano peppers for me. 
4. I used a food processor instead of blender as I like my salsa thick and chunky as opposed to pureed. I threw everything in the food processor, pulsed it a few times to the consistency that I wanted.
5. I am considering adding some spices but not sure which ones, maybe chile power and a small amount of cumin.

This recipe leaves a runny and bland salsa, I am pretty concerned about those who tried it without some extra steps. But you can make this recipe good, by draining your canned tomatoes with a colander and adding some cumin and a pinch of garam masala

Loved it! I cut the recipe way down, only using 1/2 a can tomato with green chilies so adjusted other ingredients for that amount. I did use extra cilantro and garlic and added chili powder. Will definitely do again!

I made this recipe for a Special Language class, I was learning Spanish and decided to go with classic salsa, other teachers came to the class to try the foods, everyone loved it! It was gone by the end of the class. No leftovers :( I love this salsa and whenever I choose to make salsa again I will pull up All Recipes and find this recipe!!!

The recipe is pretty good, but it did require some tweaking. I ended up adding some more lemon juice as well as garlic salt. texas pete hot sauce also really helps with adding much needed flavor and heat.Overall it was a good recipe and will definitely make this again.

Excellent! Everyone loves this. Depending on the stewed tomatoes I happen to open, I may/may not add a touch of sugar to balance the acid a bit. But, again, this totally depends on the tomatoes as some are sweeter than others.

First attempt at salsa. I added yellow peppers & two varieties of hot peppers that my co-worker had given me from her garden.  Used four tomatoes, fresh cilantro & lemon juice instead because that's what I had on hand. Added a can of black beans and one ear of cut white corn. Great texture, lot's of heat, but lacking something in flavor, I think. Overall though, I like it.

Restaurant yummy.  I used diced tomatoes and did not pour in the liquids from the can to avoid the watery-ness of too much liquid, added salt to taste, juice  from 2/3 of a lemon (what I had on hand) roasted a fresh poblano pepper and processed each ingredient separately before adding tomatoes so everything stayed 'chunky'.   I only pulsed for a couple of seconds. I like the restaurant freshness

This was a great and simple salsa.    I used juice from only one can of stewed tomatoes (I used Progresso) and used chives and extra minced onion instead of cilantro.    Pulse it only once or twice.  I like it with chips but have used it with celery .

This was excellent our first attempt at salsa ever.   We used Mexican stewed tomatoes and per personal taste we added jalapenos from a jar and more salt a bit of Cayenne pepper.  Awesome!  4 stars only cuz we made changes

I made this two times and added one fresh tomato. I made it with green onions one time and sweet onions another time. I preferred it with the green onions. This is very good surprisingly with a lot of canned gradients. Great recipe thank you

I used canned Cento Roma Tomatoes from Italy! Turned out great, but next time I will use a medium heat Green Chile peppers for a little more flavor! Great recipe!

I used 5 very ripe tomatoes from my garden. I chopped them first and put in a strainer to drain then  halved the recipe. I put all the rest of ingredients in my small bowl of the food processor and pulsed them and put them in a bowl. Next I added the chopped, drained tomatoes.  I didn't put the tomatoes in the food processor because I prefer them in larger chunks-yummy! In the winter I plan to make this recipe with stewed tomatoes. But then again I would drain the tomatoes first. Thanks Denise

I love this recipe! The stewed tomatoes are the key I think with all the extra flavor they bring with them. I just added extra lime juice and garlic since we're huge garlic fans. Watching the video does show pulsing just a few times which does keep the tomatoes and onion from getting over worked. Thanks so much for sharing! I have also added a picture. My husband said, "Do you know what this needs?......NOTHING!"

Yummy yet weirdly sweet. Would be a great option for someone that can't handle spice. Next time add two cans of chiles.
Ed likes nachos in the oven at 350 for ten minutes with this salsa as a dip.

Delicious! However, I recommend you drain the tomatoes. I used chili powder in place of salt for a spicier taste. Lime chips compliment this salsa very well.

Very bland as written and not spicy at all, but a good start to great salsa.   To make this recipe better, I used a whole can (4.5 oz) of chiles, which is about double what the recipe called for.   I also added in one jalapeno pepper, an eighth teaspoon black pepper, an eighth teaspoon of cayenne pepper, an eighth of cumin and a quarter teaspoon of chili powder.   I let it sit for an hour and it came out quite good.

I used a whole lime, some chili flakes (no chili peppers or jalapeños on-hand), an entire bunch of cilantro, and maybe a T of salt (to taste), in addition to the tomatoes, onion, and garlic. Very fresh-tasting! I might use a bit less onion next time-- I like my salsa thin, and the onion is pretty pungent.

Definitely a keeper!! Made as written but would suggest leaving out the salt.  It was only slightly salty but probably because the canned tomatoes have salt in them.

I made this salsa for a gathering of 10 people thinking I would have enough left over to snack on throughout the week. NOPE! Gone in an hour! Everyone RAVED about it and was so surprised it used canned tomatoes. The only change I made was to use one large fresh jalapeño (2 smaller ones could also work. The one i had was HUGE), instead of the canned green chiles. No one said it was too spicy, even after leaving the seeds in. I would rate it as "Medium" heat in comparison to jarred salsas. Put the jalapeño in the food processor before the other ingredients so it has a chance to get chopped up. The other ingredients need only to be pulsed maybe 5-6 times. Wonderful, cheap and easy recipe!

Delicious! Have made three times already this week. Good as written or with plain old Hunts diced tomatoes. To make it easy: a half batch is one can tomatoes, 1/4 cup finely diced onion, 1 large clove garlic finely diced, 1 1/2 tsp dried cilantro when fresh isn't handy, 1/2 TB lime juice. Our preference is to drain tomatoes (just drink the juice!) and use hand mixer only on tomatoes. Everything else is finely chopped and mixed in. Boiling the jalapeños for ten minutes, cooling and dicing works great! Thanks for a keeper!

This turned out great! I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and mixed canned serranos with a fresh jalapeno. I used a blender and it came out a creamy sauce, which I prefer. Highly recommend!

Only change I made was adding "cowboy candy" which is sweet pickled jalapeños.  Not so much a need to finely chop onion and cilantro since it goes into the food processor anyway. I found it tastes similar to chili's salsa which I love (but that has more of a tang.. Maybe more lime juice??) this salsa  is great.

This is a pretty solid base recipe. But it definitely isn't too spicy. I think next time I will toss in a few jalapenos. This recipe made 2 pint size mason jars worth so hopefully it keeps.

Way better than bottled and a lot of the restaurants. I've used the dried cilantro when the fresh is unavailable.

No peppers, what to do? Add some " Kick'n" hot sauce and it was good to go!  - Quick easy and tasted great!

Made it exactly as recipe stated.  Pulsed it in my Vitamix until correct consistency.  I thought I would add some additional green onion - man, was it "onion-y!"  Don't forget that the flavors really intensify if you're letting it set overnight.  I wish I hadn't added extra green onion...  Next time I will omit!  The cilantro really adds to this recipe and loved the lime juice.  Just remember if you're making it ahead for a party and it's going to sit overnight, cool it on the onions.... lol.     I think it's better the 2nd day.  :)

I made this using a can of Rotel, added some pickled jalapeños and blended it all up.  It was delicious!  I also halfed the amount of the remaining ingredients to match the size of the Rotel can.

Excellent!!!  However, if I could make a couple of recommendations it would be to definitely drain the tomatoes and if you can stand the heat, substitute the canned green chiles for Serrano peppers. This will turn up the heat factor but it adds more flavor and will spice it up quite a bit.

This recipe is great but I made it better with 2 substitutions. I 
ALWAYS buy San Marzano canned tomatoes. They are so much better than anything else like Hunt's. Next, use Hatch chili's and it'll add much more flavor.

I use Hunt's Fire roasted tomatoes, DRAINED. Also add: 1 tsp of red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp of cayenne & a light sprinkle of chives, also @tsp of chili powder. (Our favorite Mexican restaurant tells us to use the chili powder.)  AFTER THE PULSING, I  then add all of the spices: chili powder, cumin, chipolte powder or chipotle sauce from the can for added flavor.  Taste & decide what and how much of the spices you & your guests like in your salsa. Also If I have fresh Roma tomatoes, I will sub for the canned tomatoes. We prefer it @half chunky/half smooth.

Crazy good salsa.  Did tweak it due to having certain things on hand.  Made with fresh tomatoes, added a jalapeno and one can of hot green chilies.  Also added one tablespoon chili powder.  Delicious.  Will make again.

This salsa is amazing! I have tried so many salsa recipes and this has been the best, and certainly the closest to a restaurant style salsa I've ever made. I loved it and plan on making some more soon to give to my family.

Wow I did not expect this to be as good as it was. I used dried minced onions (about 3 TBS) since I didn't have fresh ones, I used a bit of lemon juice since I didn't have a lime, and I skipped the canned green chilies and just used a bit of cayenne (a nice pinch). I used fresh cilantro from the garden. I had fresh tomatoes on hand, but I went ahead and just used the canned stewed tomatoes as written because I figured they would add a lot to the flavor. Super easy and delicious. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This reminded me of the first time I made spaghetti sauce  years ago and couldn't believe I had ever used the stuff in a jar. I used one can of Hunts stewed tomatoes drained, one can of Rotel with lime and cilantro undrained, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written. I saved 1/2 of the chopped white onion to stir in after blending just to make sure there were some chunks in case I over-blended. I only pulsed twice for about 2 seconds each time and it was perfect. I've only tasted it warm and finally had to walk away so there would be enough left for guests tonight. Not too hot, not too mild, just right. Thanks so much. I will never go back.

This recipe just replaced any processed salsa jar in our household permanently. If I had known it was this easy, I would have made my own salsa a long time ago. Thank you for teaching me how to make salsa! In the future I'm going to experiment a little too, fresh tomatoes and such. Only change I made to this recipe was to drain the canned tomatoes even though it wasn't mentioned. I think if I didn't, this might have been too runny.

Oh my gosh this stuff is good!!!!! I didn't measure the ingredients and left out the extra salt and it turned out amazing. Like the stuff at our local Mexican restaurant but better. And this makes a TON for just a couple bucks.

Tried this and loved it.  Very easy and delicious.  The 1/2 batch I made (using 1 can Mexican stewed tomatoes as someone else suggested) didn't last the family through even half a bag of chips - that's the sign of good salsa, when it's getting scooped up rather than just dipped in!

I made 8 servings. The canned tomato taste was too prominent. And I realized after I made this I like a lot of seasonings a lot of spice. So after tasting it as the recipe was written I threw in one beautiful vine ripe tomato, half a jalapeño with seeds, fresh garlic, extra lime, cilantro and salt and at that point I would give it a four stars.

Perfect!!  The only change I will make next time is add jalapeno to kick up the heat.  This is close to my favorite restaurants.  I will try with different types of canned tomoatoes as well.

This is very similar to the salsa I make at home.  I love cilantro so I make two batches, one with tons of it for me and one with none for my roommate.  I do blend it because I like it the consistency of applesauce. I also add jalapeno or serrano peppers.  We use it almost every day - on eggs, sandwiches, salads, chips, quesadillas.  Love this stuff.

I use this recipe too for a fast salsa but I use garlic salt instead of salt and add a few drops of tobasco for heat!!

I thought this recipe was very average and was missing something. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and the quality of tomatoes may have made a difference. However, other reviews said they used fresh with good results so I don't feel like that was the deciding factor. This recipe is basic and it's not bad at all, but it's far from amazing and I was a little disappointed with it.

Great salsa to start as a base. I used 7 real tomatoes instead of canned. Added a jar of sun dried tomatoes, some tobasco and a little pepper and it was amazing!

5 starts.  This is the recipe that got me started on allrecipes many many years ago.  I was harassed to make this salsa constantly, until finally my dad got frustrated and just started making it himself.  I've always skipped the canned chiles and used fresh jalapeño instead.  Also, if you don't want it too watery, add all ingredients to a blender, then throw the canned stewed tomatoes in last and turn the blender on just long enough so everything mixes.  You can also drain a little bit of liquid out of the stewed tomatoes before dumping it in to get it a little chunkier still.

A-ok. Liked it just fine. I would like a little more kick, so will try hot sauce and spices next time. Did it in the food processor and didn't chop anything first, so it is easy.

Perhaps my blender is not that good, but I just got a soupy salsa that tasted average.  My advice would be not to use a blender whatsoever and chop/dice everything.

I guess I am not a cilantro fan. I haven't cooked with it before and I really couldn't taste anything but the cilantro once I tasted this salsa. I did try to let it sit overnight hoping it would taste better but no luck. I'll still give 3 stars because if I had left the cilantro out I have a feeling this would have been OK, though nothing special.

I love that you can utilize this recipe to your liking. I used fresh tomatoes, corn, lime and garlic. Only items I used in my food processor were the onions, green peppers and garlic. For just a few seconds.
Tomatoes and corn were added and along with seasonings and it came out great.
My recommendation would be to leave the tomatoes out of the blender.

Note: I think this recipe would be even better if I had all the right ingredients.  However, I only had one can of stewed tomatoes, no fresh anything and a can of Rotel (lime and cilantro variety).  I used 1 can stewed tomatoes, 1 can rotel (green chiles with lime and cilantro variety), 1 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, and 1 tsp lime juice.  Even with these inferior ingredients, this salsa is great.  Just like a fresh mexican restaurant salsa. I drained all my tomatoes and the salsa was still pretty wet.  This salsa recipe is good enough to get me to buy fresh onion, garlic and cilantro - not things normally seen in my kitchen.

This is a good basic recipe.  The only thing I would change is maybe chopping the tomatoes by hand.  I pulsed them in the food processor for only seconds, but they still got too juicy for my taste.

Yummy.  Used beefsteak tomatoes and a can of green chiles and lots of cilantro with the rest of the ingredients.  Didn't have lime so I used lemon.  Will add more cilantro and maybe a tiny piece of jalapeno.  Pretty good and I think my 2 and 4 year olds will eat it since it's not too spicy.  :P

LOVE this!!!  Now that we've been eating more healthy, this hits the spot! I Let it sit overnight in fridge, stirred right before smoothing over a whole grain wrap, add veggies, low-fat mozzerela and baked at 350ish for 10 minutes.... My husband LOVES it too! Reminds me of the home made pizza sauce mom and dad made when we were growing up... "Pizza Night at Mar-Dan's!"

This recipe was so quick! I needed some salsa for my husband's lunch (he loves salsa on his salads).  I used 2 cans of Rotel, about 3 or 4 T of green onion, 2 big garlic cloves, 2t of lime juice from a bottle, and about 1T of dried cilantro. Since I used Rotel, I omitted the green chiles.  I'm sure it would have been better with the fresh, but with 10 min. to make salsa, I pretty much subbed everything.  I loved that it was so quick and easy, and tasty too. The Rotel gave it a nice kick.  Thank you so much for the idea!

Quick and easy the only thing I would change would be the sweetness of it.  I will look for "no sugar" added tomatoes.  Other than that, delish!

Very good!  I think next time I won't mix it in the blender as much, and I might add more pepper so that it is a little spicier.  My kids loved it though!  It wasn't too hot for them.

gonna add my two cents! I made it this afternoon, followed recipe (other than using jalapenos instead of chiles cause it was what I had on hand)!! It is for a graduation pig roast tomorrow! I tasted it about 10 min. after making and it was great, so I can only assume that by tomorrow it will be perfect!

Definitely let this salsa chill in the refrigerator!!!!  I HATED it at first and thought it had awful flavor, extremely disappointed.  Then I read others reviews who stated to let it chill or it tasted better the next day.  They were not lying.  This salsa is great.  I think I'll omit the green chiles and replace them with jalapenos or sorranos next time... but that's just personal preference.  Thanks!  Very authentic!

Very good salsa -- very restaurant like. I definitely will make this again, but will probably add some more heat.

This salsa was great! Very simple to make. I cut the recipe in half which I wish I had not done as it was so good!  I left out the cilantro which is the only thing I will do differently next time and left out the chiles as I am one who likes all my food very mild. Will definitely try this one again most likely with home canned tomatoes though.

Excellent salsa base. The one comment I get again and again is how fresh this salsa tastes and it really does. It does not taste like it came out of a bunch of cans. I usually make it just as directed, adding only a bunch of chili powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and a couple of jalepenos. I also use the Hunt's brand Mexican stewed tomatoes when I can find them.

This is a good, quick recipe for salsa which gets better the next day.  The only change I made was the addition of 1/2 tsp of chili powder.  Otherwise, thanks Denise!

tasted fresh, made it for my vegetarian friends, they knew right away i didn't buy this salsa and compliment me on it, made no changes, turned out great, if you want to add some diced fresh tomatoes go ahead. I would recommend this.

A wonderful recipe. I had to tweak a bit since I was missing some ingredients. I used 1 can of no salt diced tomatoes, and 4 diced roma tomatoes. A whole onion since we love onion, and 1 tbls of garlic. I also had to use lemon since I had no lime, 1 jalepeno, 1 serano half seeded, and a splash of prepared habanero hot sauce. Once blended my husband still thought it needed something, so I added a pinch each of dark red chili powder, green chili powder, and cumin. I can't wait to try the recipe as is, but even with my variations this is fantastic.

I love this recipe!  I've made it twice now, and the only change I made the second time was to add just about a tablespoon of diced jalapenos.  It was great as written, but I wanted to make it just a little more spicy.  I was surprised it doesn't taste like canned tomatoes at all.   This is fairly simple to make and tastes MUCH better than the jarred salsa from the store.  I will be making this often!

After reading other comments I used fresh Roma tomatoes. The first batch I made was a little mild. It was good but you could tell something was missing. The second batch I made two days later, I roasted some jalapenos and cut up before blending. That was it!

I am making salsa for Thanksgiving and was looking at a lot of different recipes to get ideas to make mine a little better. I saw this one and decided to try it out (salsa is pretty cheap to make and this is really easy). WONDERFUL! I didn't add extra green chilies b/c I'm from a small town, store didn't have them. :) I thought there was a little too much onion for me (I hate them, but I love salsa!), but I wouldn't decrease the amount that much. As for the BLENDER (all I have), I put in on STIR for about 8-10 seconds then pulsed it until it was my desired consistency. I like it thinner, like you would find at a lot of Mexican restaurants around here (I LOVE Chili's salsa, that's about as thick as I'll eat it though!). So if you like it chunkier, I'd pulse it a few times. Thanks for sharing your awesome recipe! :)

I was looking for a salsa recipe that would taste similar to my favorite authentic Mexican restaurant, and this one makes a great base.  The first time I made it, I followed directions exactly, and it was very good.  Then, I made a few changes to try to get it to match my favorite restaurant's.  I had to use dried cilantro, because I didn't have any fresh available.  I used about 1 1/2 Tbsp.  And, I used about 3 Tbsp of lime juice.  I also added a little black pepper.  With these changes, I was extremely happy with the results.  My husband said, "That's better than you can buy in the store!" :)

This salsa was awesome.  It tasted just like my local Mexican Restaurant.  Next time I will add a little sliced jalapeno for more spice.

I used fresh tomatoes and it was the best salsa I've ever had. My husband wanted it spicy, so he added pico de gallo spice to his and it was exactly what both of us were looking for.

Do not use canned stewed tomotoes if you want the home made mexican salsa taste. I used Hunts canned stwed tomatoes and it was too sweet for my taste. But I like the idea of using green chillis so thanks for giving me that idea.

I make mine really spicy using 1/2-3/4 cup of diced jalapenos and prefer to use whole peeled canned tomatoes.  I also like the salsa a little thicker so I drain the canned tomatoes and add a small can of tomato paste.  Great recipe, I always get compliments when I make it.

Pretty good recipe.  The first time i made this, it was a little bland for my taste (i like spicy salsa) and a little runnier than i like.  This time when ni made it, i used canned diced tomatoes with chilis and onions (drained them before adding to my food processor).  i also used a lot more cilantro, more garlic (about 3 cloves instead of only 2), more chilis (about 1/3 cup instead of 1/4)  and more lime juice.  It was much more flavorful this time.  still, this recips is a great starting place if you like salsa more on the mild side.

Very good!  I used a 28 oz. can petite diced tomatoes, one sweet onion, two cloves garlic, juice of one lime and one bunch cilantro.  Made about almost 6 cups.  Will definitely make again, may try with crushed tomatoes next time.

Everyone loves this salsa. I like my salsa a little more chunky so I drain the canned tomatoes and green chiles. Note that I use 2 cans of green chiles (old el paso brand). And for spice I add Cholula, about 2 Tbsps. Or use whichever hot sauce is in your pantry.

Wonderful salsa.  Definite keeper!  We've changed the recipe up a bit here and there, but this is a great base recipe, great by itself or with more added ingredients!  Thanks for the awesome recipe.  Now we'll never buy store bought again.  Seriously.

I always get tons of compliments on this - I load up on the cilantro, adding most of a "bunch".  I leave out the chilies and if I want to spice it up, use a little fresh jalapeno.  Always disappears quickly anywhere we go!

Yummy! I love this recipe.  I used fresh Jalapeno's but otherwise went by the recipe.  It was so easy to make.  I'll be making it again and again.

This was a great authentic tasting salsa!  I made it for my boyfriend who is extremely picky and he loved it.  The salsa was gone within 2 days...and only he and I ate it.

So tasty and so easy.  I use fresh tomatoes and jalapenos from my garden.  If I don't have fresh I also use diced petite tomatoes with jalapenos already in the can.  Easy as can be and always gets rave reviews.

The whole family loved it and ate it in one sitting with cocktails in hand! FANTASTIC! I found Hunt's tomatoes with jalapenos and that made it extra awesome! Followed the recipe as written and is our new fave. I will not buy any more crappy jar salsa. Thanks!

I've been looking for a good salsa recipe for years. This one is SO easy and SO good. It tastes really fresh and can easily tolerate shortcuts (like canned tomatoes in winter). Super!

wonderful!! Added 1 Serrano pepper along with the chilis. Also added a bit more cilantro as I really like it.  Pureed it all so it was just a tiny bit chunky.  Served over the 20 dollar burger - OH MY!!!

This is pretty tasty salsa....but if you prefer it at all chunky, I would recommend either not using the blender at all, or using fresh, chopped tomatoes. With the canned tomatoes and their liquid, then blended (just a little), it was too soupy. I drained it through a sieve (the runoff juice will make delicious bloody mary mix!), and then the consistency was just right. I also used one fresh chili pepper instead of the jarred kind, and added about a tsp of herb salt and a bit more onion, as I found it a bit bland. I think it will taste much better after chilling for a day or so.....

Great salsa.  Can't wait to try with fresh tomatoes, but until then this one is a great and QUICK salsa recipe.  I usually throw in 3 jalapenos (with seeds) if I am gong to serve only adults with this one.  Add a dash or two of chili pepper and it is perfect for me.

I REALLY LIKED THIS SALSA. When the tomatoes start coming, I would like to make this with some fresh garden tomatoes rather than canned tomatoes.

Love it.  I used 2 cans of petite diced tomatos and fresh cilantro.  I omitted the jalapanos-too hot for me but did add chili powder.  Just right!

I made this earlier tonight because my daughter's father had a few friends coming over and I wanted to whip up a quick snack for them to munch on while he grilled.  I followed the recipe loosely, just getting the base down.  I chopped half a large onion in big chunks, threw it in the food processor and diced them further, and added two cans of Rotel, mostly drained, and garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder and salt to taste.  I had a taste and it was delicious.  I will try using fresh tomatoes and garlic and play around with it a bit more next time, when I'm not in a big rush.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great starter recipe. I'm going to be playing with it to make it perfect. I just made it a second time and added,  chopped fresh tomato and a 1/2 tsp sugar and 1 tsp chili powder and it is definitely a 5 star. EDIT - I have had SOOOO many compliments on this salsa. I have had a few people ask me where to buy it. I love salsa as a snack, and this is always in our fridge. So much better than you can buy in stores.

I did not care for this recipe. Sorry... Fresh tomatoes would be better than the stewed ones. (I did use the Hunt's). I'll stick with my own that I make with plum tomatoes & roasted red peppers.

This is the salsa I always dreamed of making.  And the best part is how it's soooo easy to make!  Instead of a can of green chiles I diced a jalepeno.  And I blended mine really good because I don't like chunky salsa.  Perfecto!

This made a fanastic salsa and was a great base for me.  First of all, this is NOT a spicy salsa.  Changes: 1. Used a 28oz can of Diced Tomatos (did not drain) 2. Used fresh garlic 3. Extra cilantro 4. Several jarred jalapeno slices 5. Added ground red pepper and ground cumin (next time I will go VERY liberl with it.) The salsa is not too runny, just be careful no to over process. With all if that being said the salsa is WONDEFUL, just not very spicy.

Oh my gosh!!  That was THE BEST salsa I have ever had.  I added some diced jalapanos.  I forgot the garlic and it was really good without it so I left it out.  I could eat it ALL day.  I just wish that chips weren't SOOO bad for you.  ;)

This is the best salsa recipe I have ever made!  Everyone loves it & always wants the recipe and they never believe how easy it is when I tell them.  I often use fresh jalapenos instead of the chilis.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

The first time I made this recipe, I tried to use fresh tomatoes. I added the cilantro first, and I had added way too much! I learned quickly that a little goes a loooong way! I tried to add some sugar and more tomatoes to compensate for this error, but it did not work and resulted in an overly sweet, cilantro mess! Well, I tried this again, using the canned tomatoes, and VERY light cilantro. MUCH better. I will keep trying to make this without canned tomatoes, I think this will be PERFECT salsa. Thanks!

Amongst the best salsa I have ever had. Personally I like my salsa well chopped and liquid. No chunks for me, thanks. This salsa is just that. Blend it like the recipes says and you will get a nice, non-chunky, mix.

Have been making this once a week for the last 3 months. Excellent recipe that tast authentic. I do take it easy on the salt and use kosher salt. Also add 2 jal. to add some kick. A little chili powder and cumin to taste does not hurt. Hope you enjoy this as much as I do.

I made this for the Super Bowl and got rave reviews for it!  I made a double batch and it was almost all gone!  Great recipe the only thing that I did different was drain the tomatos, (I like a thicker salsa not runny) didn't add the salt, and added about a teaspoon (remember double batch)of garlic powder.  Amazing recipe thanks!

This is so good! I also used green onions instead of white, yellow or red.  Wonderful fresh tasting salsa!  It's going to be a hit with my friends!

while incredible as it stands, I use white onion instead of a yellow onion and jalepeno peppers to bring up the heat factor.  This has become a birthday/Christmas request in my circle of friends.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I made this for a contest at work and won!!  It is a fantastic recipe!  I didn't put so much tomatos and I added a little more lime juice / cilantro.  I also used fresh jalapenos which gives it an extra kick!  I will forever make this now!  Thank you!

This salsa is very yummy, and is SO easy! I love using the stewed tomatoes for this salsa, it makes for an awesome flavor! I did use Mexican stewed tomatoes, and I added extra garlic and cilantro...I also love red onion in any salsa, it makes the flavor a bit sweeter. This is a wonderful mild salsa, but I think I will add a roasted jalapeno next time! : )

BOMB BAY!! I used half a jalapeno for more spice instead. Other than that followed recipe completely. Going to enter it in the county fair next year. Might make it for Christmas gifts too. Thanks for another great one!

This is my first attempt at making a salsa, since a recipe I was using called for salsa and I didn't have any. It turned out pretty good! I used my blender instead of a food processor, and I think it came out ok. Will try again!

this is some great stuff. The best part is that you can modify it to taste of who you are making for. If you want it hot then use fresh jalapeno instead of chilies. One time a made it with the chilies and one jalapeno just so you could get the favor of the jalapeno but not that hot. You can also use almost any kind of  stewed, diced flavor tomatoes as they will be blended anyway.

Pretty good salsa! I used fresh jalapeno's rather than green chiles, 3 teaspoons fresh minced garlic and used dried cilantro (next time I'll be sure to make with fresh...much better flavor). I'll definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

POSSIBLY THE BEST SALSA EVER! I followed the recipe except for a few modifications (but i would feel confident using the original recipe, this is just what i had on hand)...instead of 2 cans stewed tomatoes, i had one can of stewed tomatoes with celery, onion, green peppers already in it, and for the second can i used diced tomatoes with green chili's in it - therefor I omited the green chili's in the recipe. I think I may have added just about double what it called for cilantro, bc I have an affair with cilantro, but when I make this again for friends who are not big cilantro fans, I will follow the recipe exactly. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS SALSA YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! And YES, it DOES taste fresh even though you use canned tomatoes - don't know how, but its FANTASTIC!!!

Great salsa!  We used the recipe more as a jumping off point and didn't really follow the recipe.  We modified it slightly by using fresh tomatoes and fresh jalepenos.  We didn't have any cilantro, so we added cumin and chili powder to taste, along with more salt than the recipe called for.  Finally, since we didn't have any lime, we put in a shot of lime flavored gin. The salsa turned out great with these modifications.  I'd say that any salsa recipe is more a matter of individual taste than recipe following, and this recipe allowed us to put together a batch of salsa we really liked.

This is a great recipe! Fresh tomatoes are easily swapped out for the canned ones.  I would recommend making a large amount because the flavor on day 2 is even better than that of day 1 and you may not have any left over!

This is great!! I think next time I will drain the tomatoes and add some chili powder as other reviewers suggested-- still great though. I'm looking forward to tasting again in a few more days, as I'm sure it'll taste even better! Thanks!

Fantastic! And so easy to whip up! I did drain the tomatoes, didn't cut the onions too small as someone else had mentioned and I did add in some chili powder. I used a whole 4 oz can of chopped green chilis too. Not too hot at all. The consistency is beautiful - just pulsed a few times. I will make this again! I may try adding in liquid smoke next time, I love a smokey salsa, but this is a 10 just as it is!!! =)

I didn't have all the ingredients, so I made few changes. It still turned out really good. I'm sure if I had followed the recipe more closely it would have been even better.

This salsa is out of this world! I am a born and raised Texan, so I have had my fair share of salsa. I made this recipe without any mods and I used a generic brand of stewed tomatoes (No Hunts here). My husband is a true salsa snob and likes his fresh salsa from Whole Foods. After trying this recipes he hasn't touched his old salsa.

I added some jalapeno slices and 4 oz. of tomato sauce.  I also drained one of the cans of stewed tomatoes so it wouldn't have such a watery taste.  This only gets better as it sits!

This turned out great!  I followed the recipe exactly although next time I might drain the tomatoes a little bit because it was a little juicy.  Personally the BF and I like it juicy instead of chunky anyway.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is a good recipe to start with. I'm from Texas and without any peppers this was like eating tomatoes chopped up. I added more cilantro, the whole can of green chilies for taste (it has no heat), and Serrano peppers for heat. It does only get better with time. I recommend making it 24-hours in advance to any party your having. With the changes it is very good.

I used lemon instead of lime since none was available in my fridge. I added nearly all a 4 oz can of green chiles. I eyed the amount of cilantro to taste. For a bit of spice, b/c I had no red chili peppers, I added dashes of cayenne pepper.

Very, very tasty!  I love the extra kick from the cilantro.  The only part of the recipe I did differently was the lime juice - I just used about 1 tablespoon of lime juice from a bottle we already had, instead of purchasing a lime to squeeze.  The recipe makes a lot of salsa, and it only gets better with time!  We're going to make up another batch of this to take with us on vacation, but we might have to double or triple the recipe because it won't last long!

Wasn't to sure about using canned tomatoes, but this actually was quite good! I did tweak a bit. Doubling the green chili', lime juice and cilantro. I normally grill my tomatoes and jalapeno's first, so this is a good recipe when you are short on time!

It's not bad, but I had to put a lot of salt and pepper and hot sauce to get the flavor.  It turned out well, pretty good for parties.

This is great salsa!  I followed other recommendations and partially drained the tomatoes and added 1 tsp of chili powder.  Immediately after it was made it tasted great, so I can only imagine how good it's going to be after the flavors set.  As a personal preference, next time I'm going to use a bit more onion, but otherwise this was hands down better then  the Trader Joe's salsa that I had earlier today.

Wow.  Very delicious.  I could eat the whole  bowl.  I followed Auntie June's recommendations and added some chili powder.  I also added a teensy bit of cumin powder.  What I did... drained 2 cans of Mexican Stewed tomatoes added the garlic , put in a small onion chopped in large pieces.  I added alot of cilantro since I love it.  A bit more than it called for.  Added the lime juice, salt, cumin and chili powder and jalapeno wheels.  I pulsed a few times and found Salsa Heaven.  Thanks !!!

I was all ready with extra spices and seasonings because it didn't seem like this recipe would be enough.  I decided to mix it up as directed first to see.  And I was pleasantly surprised!  It was very flavorful with a little bite to it.  I did use green onions instead of white (b/c that's all I had) and I threw in a little bit of extra green chiles but it was really delicious!!!!

I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes because I accidently bought Italian stewed tomaotes. This made it very bland but the consistancy and look was excellent. I added more salt and more garlic. I will for sure make this again, with the right tomatoes!! I couldn't add jalepenos and cilantro because they are pulled from our shelves for the ecoli scare. I used dried cilantro. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great salsa! Quick and easy to make and great flavor. I kept mine chunky because that is the way we like it. I did add 1/2 t. red and black pepper to give it more heat! I made this again and decided to run it through the blender and it was really good that way too. Great flavor for canned tomato salsa. I bet it is even better with fresh tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This salsa recipe is fool proof. I have made it exactly by recipe, as well as using canned diced tomatoes with habenero peppers (to make it a little spicier). I use lime juice instead of fresh lime, and a little heavy on the onion. This is the best salsa ever, and I can't see why I will ever pick up a can of salsa again! My husband takes it to work and the guys eat it before he can! It goes perfect with some lime tortilla chips.... MUY BIEN!

I have been looking for an easy salsa recipe for a long time and this turned out pretty good.  I was amazed at the fresh taste.  It was a little on the bland side for our tastebuds so I would add a jalapeno next time.  But, I will definitely make this again.

Great base! For a quick smokey flavor add one chilpotle pepper cut up in small pieces and some adobo sauce. Be careful though, this really adds some heat.

Good stuff!  I'm not a fan of spice so I left out the chiles but wouldn't do that again.  It needs that little kick, and I think the recipe exactly as written is perfect!  Agreed with another reviewer that if you like a thicker salsa, be sure to drain the tomatoes before adding.

this recipe was really good. I didnt have onions so I substituted for onion powder. Also I used I can stewed tomatos and one can diced. I also used an umeasurably amount of cilantro. Could of still been a little more spicier. I'll play around more next time, but overall it was a very fast a yummy recipe!

Fabulous, fast and easy (and I'll never buy salsa again). I used 24 oz can of whole peeled tomatoes (didn't have stewed ones), 14 oz diced tomatoes, 1 can of mild green chilies, chili podwer, 1 small onion, 1 lime, salt and added 1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce for nice, smoky flavor...didn't have any cilantro but I'll add it next time. This was still SO good eventhough I was missing some ingredients.
I also made my own tortilla chips to go with it, here's how: brush soft (flour)tortillas with some canola oil on both sides,cut into 6 triangles, bake on a cookie sheet at 400F for 5 min, flip, and another 4-5 min. I prefer (Mission)flour tortillas because they get fluffy and oh so good, not too crispy. Thanks D!

I cannot believe how fresh this salsa from canned tomatoes tastes!  I made this for a party (full of Texans by the way) and was shocked that we ran out.  Cannot imagine an easier, more cost-effective, and more widely pleasing than recipe!

It doesn't get better than this! I've never liked the taste and consistancy of store bought salsa, and just made this tonight.  WOW!  I can't believe how easy this is to make and you can adjust the spices to your liking.  I will never buy salsa again now that I've found this recipe! (Also, I didn't really measure the ingredients - just tossed in everything and it came out perfect!)  Enjoy :)

Extreamly fast and good tasting salsa. Will replace the canned stuff I have been buying for our mexican nights. 

Be really careful with the amount of water on the salsa as it comes easily way too watery.

Love this! It's so easy to tailor it to your tastes. I don't blend mine because I like chunky salsa, but maybe I'll try blending some and and mixing it with the unblended salsa the next time I make it. Which should be this weekend. :)

I am always looking for new salsa recipes and this one was great! I did alter it slightly, for the sake of convenience and my slight dislike of onions. I used 2-14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes with green chilis, 1/3 of an onion, 2 cloves garlic, juice of half a lime, dash of salt, and an unmeasured amount of fresh cilantro. Put it in a blender for just a few seconds. I am a salsa freak and this is the best I have ever made! Thank you!!

Talk about addictive. I make alot of differant fresh salsa's but I will have to say this is absolutely the best ever. Great job D ! I made it for a baby shower and everyone loved it I was even asked to make it for a wedding, even though they had someone else scheduled to bring salsa... sorry they want to cancel the other salsa. It was so addicting we couldnt stop. I had to hide some for my husband. I followed the recipe to a 'T' with fresh jalapenos for that extra kick and I made it a day in advance. Two days later it was that much better. This is it, stop looking! 10 STARS for this!!!

This is delicious!  Better than the "fresh" store brand salsa.  I thought it was okay the first day - definitely better on the 2nd.  Like many other reviewers, I recommend making this the day before.  I would also spice it up a bit.

What a fantastic and easy to make recipe. Fresh salsa in a snap. I won't be purchasing  store bought salsa anymore. I highly recommend it. I added a chopped jalapeno pepper (without the seeds) for a little more zip. This is not a runny salsa....it will stay on the chip. I had made it for a card party and was asked for copy's. They loved it.

I must say this recipe is quick and easy to make and not to hot. I made it this evening reducing it in half and used 1 tbsp lemon juice instead of lime. I also added a little hot sauce to spice it up.  I like the flexibility to spice it up to my liking.  Delicious!

Everyone enjoyed this!  Followed the recipe, but added a couple of chilis in adobo sauce.  Gave it a good roasted flavor.  Not a bite left!

My family loves this recipe. Everyone asks for the recipe! I would recommend draining some of the liquid off the tomatoes so it doesn't get to watery. Gets better the longer it sits.

This was my first time making homemade salsa and I did incorporate a couple changes that have been suggested here (I used the petite diced tomatoes w/ jalapenos). Overall, pretty good but I think I'll try another recipe next time.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I added more cilantro because I love the taste of it, and also a little ground red pepper to add a little more heat.  So easy and so delicious! And even better the next day! I will definitely make this again!

This is my new go-to salsa recipe.  The only change I made is to add a can of rotel tomatoes with green chiles instead of just the can of chiles.  I also add more cilantro, since I LOVE cilantro. This salsa is SO easy to make that I keep some in the fridge all the time now, and will never buy store bought salsa again!

AMAZING! This is the first recipe I've found on this site that literally made me moan with delight upon tasting it!  I made some changes in which tomatoes to use, but other than that - stuck to the recipe.  I used 1 can of crushed tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes.  This made a lot of salsa with the other ingredients! I would say around 6-8 cups.  The family really enjoyed this, and I certainly won't ever buy salsa if I can at all help it at the store again.  Thanks so much for sharing! ~One little side note: This was a bit spicy for my kiddie, so I added some ketchup to their portion (about 1/4 cup to 1 cup of the original), and this addition toned down the spice enough for her~

This gets 5 stars for taste and how easy it is to make! I make a half batch just for myself about once a week. The first time I made this, I tasted it the first day and thought, "it's not that good" the second day I thought "this is the best salsa I ever made!"

This salsa is incredibly easy and outstanding for parties.  Easy to make, quick, and it leaves enough room for you to modify and experiment to suit people's special tastes (those who love cilantro and those who think it is a vile weed from hell)

This is the only salsa recipe I use and I have made it again and again. The only things I do differently: I use the juice from a whole lime, add lots more cilantro, add a bit of cumin, omit the green chiles and use 1 can of stewed tomatoes and 1 can of diced tomatoes w/green chiles. My husband can't eat things that are too spicy so this is just the right amount of heat for us. I also use this salsa to make enchilada sauce and spanish rice, and it really does taste even better if you let it sit in the fridge overnight. Kudos, Denise!

I used one can of diced tomatoes with green chilis and one can of stewed tomatoes.  I drained the tomatoes before pulsing in the food processor which really helped.  I also did not have the cilantro to add, so I left it out.  I wouldn't say this tasted really "homemade", but it was pretty good.  Didn't knock my socks off like I was hoping.  **UPDATE** I tried this recipe again and used fresh tomatoes this time with the cilantro.  The result was a much better taste - worthy of 4 stars!

Oh, so yummy, yummy!  Everyone at my party LOVED it!!  I used petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes, but everything else was the same!

I've been making salsa for awhile now, but have to say that this was AWESOME!  I did follow some suggestions from others and added 2 diced roma's, 1 can of reg tomatoes, and 1 can of mexican tomatoes.  I also added way more cilantro (I love it)... Thanks for the recipe- My Husband loved it :)

Great recipe!  My family does like their salsa a bit spicier, but it was so easy to just tweak this recipe to suit one's own taste!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a good basic recipe. Much too mild for my family but it has a great texture. I'll try a can of tomato paste too next time. I added Chalula, Tabasco,Black Pepper and more salt to make it spicier. Will definately make again!

My family loves this salsa.  I add two roma tomatoes to the mixture, as I like the flavor that they give.  It is simple to make, and everyone that has tried it raves!

Loved the taste and so easy to make.  Took others' advice and draied the tomatoes and only blended on pulse for a few seconds so it was not watery at all.  Thank you!  This is now a staple at our house.

Used a hand food chopper. Didn't have lime juice & cilantro (which would make this 5 1/2 stars). I used lemon juice and subbed jalap. for grn. chilies (prefer).  Used fresh, very ripe garden toms w/o skin. Tastes just like fave restaurant...can't wait to eat again after all the flavors have a chance to meld together more. Thanks D, for a low-fat treat I'm sure to keep!

Pretty good, but we prefer a little spicier salsa. This one was a little bland so will add fresh hot peppers next time and cut down on the canned green chilies.

Good base for a salsa. My husband used it as a guidline and added what he likes for personal taste. The canned tomatoes work great. We made a real chunky salsa.

This is good! I will never buy salsa in a jar again. I took the advice of adding some brown sugar and added to that a tbsp of ground cumin and it was delish! A definite keeper.

Because i used mexican style stewed tomatoes i didn't add the green chiles. This sauce was very good, i served it with tortillas and on top of my chicken quesadillas.

Thanks for the recipe!  Per other reviews, I let my imagination run wild with the "extras" since the base for this salsa is here.  We love to include a variety of peppers (green, banana, etc.) and just a half a spoonful of sugar, plus good ol' salt and fine ground pepper.  I would agree with another review--good bye store-bought salsa!

I love this recipe! I use fresh tomatoes for a summery fresh taste and I let it sit in the fridge for a couple hours to let the flavours soak in.

This salsa was out of this world.  I made 4 cups of it from the recipe.  I added pepper flakes and a ton of cilantro which I love a lot and it was the best salsa I ever had.  I threw all the ingredients in the food processor and in a few seconds it was done and ready to serve.  Thanks!  I will make this over and over again!

This was a really good salsa. Made it last night for a party and we all liked it very much.I used jalepenos instead of green chiles. It gave it more spice.

We thought this was an okay recipe.  I thought it had too much lime juice in it and it would have been better with fresh tomatoes instead of the canned ones.

Very good taste, I love cilantro.  I doubled the green chiles, but they still didn't seem to add any spice to it.

This recipe is wonderful!  My entire family just loved it.  I added a can of diced tomatoes after it had been blended and just stirred them in as we like a chunkier consistency.  It is really good and we have plenty to last us for awhile.  I plan on making this for the next pitch-in.

I have been trying for three years now to make the perfect salsa and now I have found the recipe!!  I took the advice of the previous reviews and used fresh tomatoes and added sugar.  I also left out the green chiles and used a spicey green pepper instead.  This recipe is so easy and so tastey.  I have never had a sweet salsa before.  The tablespoon of sugar makes all the difference in the world.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!

Everyone that tries this salsa LOVES it.  It is one of the required items and our annual block party...and the best part is IT'S SO EASY!  My only modification is, I use diced tomatoes instead of stewed (only because I seem to always have those on hand).

This was incredibly easy, but has a very cann-y taste.  I would probably dice a fresh tomato or two instead of using stewed tomatoes.  However, this was a great starting point as my first attempt at fresh salsa.  Thanks for submitting!

Pretty good salsa - I prefer fresh tomatoes, but this will keep longer.  I did add a couple of minced jalapenos and some more garlic.  A good starting point especially if you don't care for cilantro.

This is great! I added a little extra cilantro and garlic to mine. Also added 1 fresh tomato and all of one can of chopped green chilies.
This is very mild, but overall it has a nice flavor.
Thanks!

This was out of sight!!!  I have never made salsa before and EVERYBODY wanted this recipe.  The only addition I made to this fantastic recipe was I used the entire can of green chiles instead of 1/4 cup.  D -- thank you for sharing this recipe.  Kudos to you!!!

I've made this salsa several times, but I've made some alterations.  I added bell peppers - green and yellow for color.  I also split the batch in half and added 2 habenero peppers to make a spicy version - people ended up mixing the mild and spicy to get a medium version.

I've never made salsa before, and this was super easy, and tasted delicious. Some members of my family tolerate only a little spiciness, and they liked this recipe.  I added a little tobasco to the rest of the batch for myself and others, and it was superb.  I will definately make this again.

I loved this! I did use the Mexican stewed tomatoes and then also some Mexican diced tomatoes. I also chopped everything by hand instead of blending. I tend to like chunkier salsas. I brought it to a friend's and everyone raved over it.

Yummy!  I loved this recipe.  I followed it exactly!
My husband thought it was too much like spaghetti sauce, but it tasted nothing like spaghetti sauce, but did have that consistency.
I especially like to eat it with the Hint of Lime Chips -- YUM!  I WILL be making this again!  Thanks Denise!

I hope this recipe gets 100 GREAT ratings because it is excellent!  You cannot tell that anything is canned and I surprised many guests when I told them how I made it.  Spice it up a notch with canned jalapeno's or a little more green chiles. (Dicing your own jalapenos will increase the heat 10 fold, be careful)

This recipe was easy & delicious.  I added 1 diced jalapeno chili to make it a little spicier.

perfect salsa! i don't have a food processer, so I use my blender which makes it come out a little watery, so I often only blend the salsa with one can of tomatoes and add the second can once it's done to make it chunkier. Still a rather watery sauce, but I prefer it that way... I can't tell you the last time I bought salsa!

Excellent!  Fast & easy to make with the right amount of all flavors.  Puts some restaurant salsas to shame... almost as good as my nana's! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Amazing & so fresh!!  I add a little more onion, cilantro & chiles for an extra kick.  I also add salt & pepper.  The good thing is, you can modify to your taste as you go.  I'll never buy salsa again!!
