This was REALLY good! Very unique & flavorful.  Totally different then any chili I've ever had.  This is a great recipe, I pretty much made it as is, I just used the entire bottle of Negro Modelo & cooked it for 2 hours.  Thanks for sharing!!

I make this chili with elk and it is absolutely fantastic.  I add corn to it for a little extra texture and flavor.  Best chili my family and friends have ate not to mention folks that don't typically enjoy wild game rave over it.

Certainly one of the more interesting chili recipes I've tried.  At first it tastes like tomato or vegetable soup and then there is this burst of sweet heat on the finish that is really different.

This is the secret of my chili cook-off win. I improvised a little and gave it a better title. It's a perfect blend of sweet and spicy. This is the first recipe I've been proud of. Thank you!
