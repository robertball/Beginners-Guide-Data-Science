I rated this 5 stars because my husband said it was the best pumpkin pie he's ever had.  I reduced the milk to 1 cup, and also made my own pumpkin puree - not hard, ladies!  Get a pie pumpkin, remove the seeds, cut it up into 6 or 8 chunks, place it in a pan with 1/2" of water, cover with foil and bake at 375 degress for about an hour, or until a knife slides easily into the flesh.  Let cool, and scrape the pumpkin away from the rind.  Mash it up as best you can, then take other's advice and put the puree into a colander and let it drip into a bowl (cover the whole thing with plastic wrap and set it in the frig overnight). This should help avoid having such a watery pie like many have encountered.  Also, once I combined the pie filling ingredients, I ran it all through my blender to smooth it out.  The end result was an incredibly silky texture... This is not a dense, orange pie like you get from a can. Much lighter in color and more delicate. (A little more spice probably wouldn't hurt.) Consider decreasing your oven temp by 15 degrees & baking a little longer till the center sets up. Your crust will thank you.

I made this recipe for my in-laws, My father in law is an old fashion pie lover.  His Mother used to make the best pies (so I have been told)!  Well No one has ever been able to recreate that twinkle in his eye like his mom used to get when he hate her pies, Until now!  He loved it so much that he requested I make more so he can take them home and keep them in the freezer so he can have a taste whenever he wants!  He said it was just like how mom used to make, with tears in his eyes!!  VERY WELL DONE RECIPE!!!! VERY MUCH ENJOYED, will use again!

This recipe has become a favorite for my family and friends.  I make about 30 pies between October and November as friend from pumpkin patches send white pumpkins my way!!!  I think I finally perfected it this year...this recipe does make 2 pies and the secret in using fresh pumpkin is in how that is prepared.  After making the puree put it in a collender lined with coffee filters set in a bowl and wrapped with plastic wrap for 24 hours before attempting to make pie.  This will keep pie from becoming soggy and will cook in the time given in the recipe.

ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE!!!! I made this pie today for mother's day and my mom went nuts! She said it tastes just like the one my grandma used to make for her when she was a little girl! I did change a few things though. I added one teaspoon of cinnamon instead of 1/2 a teaspoon, I only put in 1/2 cup of 1% milk instead of 1 1/2 cups, and I bought only the regular whipping cream, not the "heavy" whipping cream.  I added about three TBL extra of whipping cream before I poured it in the pie shell because it looked like it needed a little more liquid. I also added one full 15 ounce can of pumpkin and then another 1/2 cup from another can... I baked it according to the time given in the directions, let it set at room temp for a few hours, then refrigerated it for a few hours and it was DELICIOUS!!!! I couldn't stop eating it!!!! Will definately make again!

Quite delicious but needed a few changes. I also made my pumpkin puree from scratch (baked and pureed pumpkin the day before and drained it overnight in the fridge). I also reduced the milk to 1 cup, and even with adding about 1.5x the spices listed, it still seemed like it needed a little more. Next time I'll definitely at least double the spices, but this recipe makes a very good base to start with to temper to your own tastes. Highly recommended with the butter crust off of this site!

I followed the recipe exactly and my whole family loved it. I used fresh pumpkin puree. I cut pie pumpkins in half and scoop out the seeds and goop with a grapefruit spoon - that seems to work out pretty well. Then place on a foil lined baking sheet and place the pumpkins cut side down. (I use a little bit of Pam so they don't stick). Then I completely cover the pumpkin with foil and put in a 350 degree oven for about an hour. However, some people say they can get two cups of puree from one pumpkin but I seem to only get one, so I have to do two pie pumpkins. After they have roasted, I scoop the pumpkin out of the shell and then throw them in the food processor to make the puree smooth and creamy. I've found out after experimenting I don't need to strain it, I think the roasting keeps the pumpkin from being too watery, as opposed to steaming which I think makes for the watery pies I've heard people complain of. But thanks for the recipe, this one is a keeper!

I made this and several other pumpkin pie recipes for Thanksgiving, this one was declared the favorite.  My original feeling about it was that it was a little too sweet, but I was voted down.  I might cut the white sugar by half next time, though.  I would also make sure you either have an extra crust or some oven-proof bowls, it was way too much filling for even my 9" deep dish crust.
*Used this recipe again this year, and followed it exactly.  Either I didn't do it right last year or my tastes have changed, it's delicious!  It still makes enough for two pies from each batch, but everyone loved them, so they disappeared VERY quickly!

This pie was amazing. I've been making pies from a can since I was a kid, and I had a pumpkin leftover from Halloween and had guests coming over for dinner, so I thought, what the heck, and made the pumpkin puree myself. 

One thing to keep in mind is that it the filling made with homemade pureed pumpkin is much more watery than a canned pumpkin pie, so don't be surprised when you put it into the pie crust. I accidentally spilled a good portion of it out of the shell, but that ended up being a good thing since it took awhile to cook. I would suggest making a thinner pie, rather than deep-dish with this recipe so that the crust won't burn by the time the filling sets up (took about an hour with filling that was maybe 1 1/2 inches thick) and the filling will rise a bit so it won't be thin in the end. I did have maybe 1/3 of the filling leftover after I filled my crust, so I threw it in a loaf pan and baked it separately to make a pumpkin custard.

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and drained the puree in a colander lined with coffee filters overnight, which yielded at least a cup of water, which would have made the pie soggy, so I'm glad I did that and would suggest it to another who wants to make this pie from scratch.


The end result was the absolute best pumpkin pie that I've ever had. Wasn't difficult, but was time-consuming, but definitely worth the effort.

With all the positive reviews, I was disappointed with the end product. Used homemade pumpkin puree. Sorry to say it was a waste of time. The pie was edible, but NOT as a pumpkin pie. Very little pumpkin taste and too many spices. Filling is very runny (even after I used less liquid.....), however it did thicken up nicely. I have to mention the color: not very inviting.  I won't be using this recipe again.

This pumpkin pie recipe is awesome!  The only thing I changed is I used 2 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of all of the seperate spices it asks for and added some finely grated orange zest.

This is a great recipe! Super simple to prepare. I did follow the advice of some of the other reviewers: reduced milk to 1 cup, and added an extra 1/4tsp more of each spice item; I might try reducing the milk/cream more the next time for a denser consistency. I also found it tasted better after refrigeration.   This recipe does make 2 pies! The more the merrier!

I thought this was a fantastic pumpkin pie. I followed the directions with a small exception of adding just a tad less milk, probably didn't make a difference anyways. I has no problems with mine being watery or not setting up as some people mention in previous reviews. I loved that this recipe uses a lot of spice. I will make this recipe again. In the end, I used a deep dish and had extra mixture, like 1 1/2 cups leftover that I ended up tossing.

Great flavor and texture. I only used 2% milk instead of milk and cream.  I pre-baked my pie crust so I wouldn't have a mushy bottom. I will be saving this recipe to make again in the future.

Excellent recipe!  This is my first attempt at a pumpkin pie using REAL pumpkin (not pumpkin-in-a-can).  The taste was delicious.  My only "complaint" is that the pureed pumpkin separated from the liquid during baking and floated to the top.  My boyfriend thought that I had incorporated the pumpkin "layers" into the pie on purpose (and of course I took credit for it!).  Perhaps blanching the raw pumpking prior to pureeing would be helpful?  Otherwise, EXCELLENT recipe.  
P.S.  I used "No Roll Pie Crust I" recipe (also from allrecipes.com) for my crust.

Very good basic recipe, not enough spices (personal preference).  I changed the amounts as follows: 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp ground cloves, 1/2 tsp salt ad used 1 cup of milk rather than the 1 1/2 called for.  I will be making this again.

You CAN'T screw this one up! If you follow the directions exactly it will turn out perfectly I promise you. Tastes good, too of course! For even better results I recommend baking the pie shell for about 5-8 minutes by itself at 400 degrees F. Then turn oven down to 350 and bake entire pie for around 45 minutes. I substituted nutmeg/ginger/cloves with Pumpkin Pie Spice and it tasted even better! Let pie cool in the oven.

My mom and dad love Chudleigh's pumpkin pie. I was unable to get that pie for Thanksgiving this year, so I went on the search for a reasonable facsimile, and this worked out perfectly! It is enough for two pies. I just bought the frozen pie crusts and they were really good. The other thing I did was buy canned pumpkin puree. It really is unnecessary to puree the pumpkin yourself. Instead of using four different spices, I used 2 1/2 teaspoons of Pumpkin Pie Spice and it was really good. This will save you money, since spices are expensive. All in all, I am really pleased with the recipe and found that you can do a very semi - homemade version that is cheaper and just as tasty as Chudleigh's!

Incredibly delicious pumpkin pie recipe! I made the following changes:
1. Increase all spices by at least 50% (I am doubling mine next time)
2. Decrease oven temp by 25 degrees--your crust will love you for it!
3. USE A PIE CRUST SHIELD!!! I absolutely swear by them! I bought mine at Bed Bath & Beyond but I know I've seen them elsewhere. Your crust will come out golden and perfect EVERY TIME--not the least bit burnt! Under $5.00 apiece!

I made this pie using my already pureed, frozen, WHITE pumpkin.  I slightly increased the cinnamon and the nutmeg (as I love these spices) and this was the hit at Thanksgiving dinner at my future in-laws!  Even my fiancee (who HATES pumpkin pie) had 2 HELPINGS!  I highly recommend this recipe!  It's flavor is not as strong as the canned pumpkin and I will never use anything but fresh again!

The flavor of this pie is excellent.At first I thought the cloves would be too powerful but all the spices worked together so wonderfully.I'm not good at pie crusts so I tried a shortbread pie crust and it tasted fantastic together.Thanks for the recipe.

This is the recipe I use every year.  It isn't as sweet as most and has great flavor.  I use home cooked pumpkin when I can but preheating and then cooling the canned really does remove the tinny taste and makes it almost as good as homemade.

Not the worst pumpkin pie I've ever had.  Even after adding more spices it still lacked flavour...probably because there is not enough sugar in the recipe either. Sugar to pumpkin should be somewhere around a 1:1 ratio for my tastes for a pie. Should have called mom for her recipe.

This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever had. This recipe adds a new element of flavor to the pie while still retaining that classic pumpkin pie taste. The new element of taste is almost egg custard-like and the texture of the pie is more fluffy. I made two pies, and in the second one, added approximately 1 additional cup of Pumpkin Puree. This reduced the egg custard-flavor and brought the pumpkin flavor to the forefront while still maintaining the fluffy texture.

I like this recipe.  This was my first attempt at baking pie!  Since we had received several pie pumpkins from our local farm CSA, I wanted to try a pumpkin pie using fresh pumpkin puree.  I've since made my third pumpkin pie, learning a few tips and making a couple slight modifications.  1. I use four whole eggs (why waste an egg white?). 2. I replaced the spices with 1.5 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice I got on the cheap (I don't like cloves anyway). 3. It helps to cook off some of the pumpkin puree water first, to keep the mixture from being too diluted and taking too long to bake.  4. Put an extra cookie sheet under the pie's rack in the oven and carefully pour the mixture into the pie crust in the oven, as it will be very full.  The first time, I managed to carry it to the oven full without spilling, but it can be challenging.  5. Use your leftover heavy cream to make whipped cream (add powdered sugar and beat until fluffy).  6. Pie will be jiggly when finished, but the skin will show you it's not liquid. Be careful removing it from the oven, cool it at room temp, and be sure to plan on refrigerating it overnight (cover with plastic wrap) for best results.  Add your homemade whipped cream and enjoy breakfast!

I made a pumpkin pie for Christmas dinner from the America's test kitchen site which was almost exactly like this one.  I agree with many others, the flavor and consistency is good but the bake time is way off.  I did one pie, which turned out to be very deep and took forever to cook, much longer than the stated time and I have an oven thermometer so I know it was not my oven.  The next time, I will make two pies.

Must use a 9" DEEP dish pie pan to hold all of the filling ingredients!  Texture was less than perfect, would not make this again.

FANTASTIC! Just to see if it was worth the effort, I made this pie with fresh pumpkin puree as well as one using canned pumpkin.  My family raved about the fresh pumpkin version-even my 5 year old begged for more.  I followed another reviewers advice on making the puree and it was super easy (cut up a pie pumkin, baked it in a few inches of water for 40 min. at 325 then ran it through the processor).  It was simple to make and looked beautiful-a deep nutmeg-pumpkin color instead of that orangey look the canned one had.  Tasted devine! You will not be disappointed!

Very good. It's a little spicy, but very delicious and has a nice thick consistancy. However, don't make this pie with canned pumpkin. When I did it was incredibly watery and the crust didn't bake.

I am not sure what went wrong, but the filling never set, the exposed crust was well done (a little burnt)
after leaving the pie in 10 minutes longer than suggested.  Oven temperature verfied.  I feel the  liquid (milk and heavy cream) was 1/2 cup too much perhaps.

I really hate to give bad reviews but I have to tell the truth. This pie had a horrible texture, I baked it for a lot longer than it calls for and it was still mushy and somewhat watery. I would've given it more stars if it at least tasted right but it didn't. it leaves an odd after taste in the mouth. :(

I don't know if I did something wrong, but this seemed to be runny. I wasn't thrilled with the texture, and my guests thought the spices were a bit much. I am not a huge pumpkin pie fan anyway, but I think I've tasted better.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was fabulous!  I doubled the spices based on other reviews and, for me, this was a mistake.  I should have probably just made the recipe "as is" the first time.  Even with the overloaded spices, it was the best pie I've had in a long, long time.  I made homemade crust but used canned pumpkin.  Today I'm making it again with my own baked pumpkin and I'm sure it will be even better!

To make it extra rich, I use half and  half for all the liquid.  I don't bother straining my homemade pumpkin puree for lumps.  The texture adds to the homemade quality.

Giid base wwwwaaaaaayyyyyyy to many spices, I like pumpkin pies that have a subtle amount of spices so they dont over power the pallet, I dont know if my taste buds are just really sensitive or what but it is a good base and play with the rest until its just right.

This is a great receipe, I used sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin, which we like just as well. I have also have used butternut squash which makes a better pie than anything else. I have my oven at 350 instead of 425. Bake for an hour & I use a 10 inch pie pan.

This is my 'go to' pumpkin pie recipe. I usually up the spices a little bit, just because I like having that much flavour. I'm a hardcore whipped cream and chilled pumpkin pie person - but this pie is so delicious, I can just eat it plain and room temperature! Most times I can't wait for it to cool off, I want to eat it right away.  Goes great as tarts too, try putting pecans in (yum!).

Good flavor, but not the best texture...more souffle than anything.  I decreased the milk to 1 cup and the pie still took like an extra 30 minutes to bake.  At the end of it, it was still very wet and runny.  I may try another recipe with the same mix of spices though, since I think that this was the best I've had yet.

This is an awesome recipe!  I can't believe how easy it was to make.  I used a pre-made pie crust and had it in the oven in about 10 minutes!   I took the advice of others and used 1 cup of milk and all I had was half-and-half instead of heavy cream.  It was a bit of a bummer because with a deep dish pie shell, it still was too much filling - I ended up throwing about a half cup of the filling away.  I think if I used a 9" deep dish pie plate it would have fit perfectly, so next time I'll give that a try.  Honestly, the taste of this pie is right on the mark!  Perfection!

This pie is delicious. I also make my own pumpkin puree using fresh pumpkin. The spices and sweetness of the pie are perfect. My family ate this up soon after it came out of the oven. Thank you for a great recipe.

Just what I needed!  A 'store cupboard' recipe to use up the pumpkin puree from our jack-o-lanters.

A hit with 5/5 in our house, which is quite an achievement.

Wow, this was a wonderful, tasty recipe. Like other reviewers I found that using canned pumpkin made for a very liquid pie that had to be cooked longer. Next time I'll use less milk if I use the canned pumpkin. Really wonderful recipe.

This was my first time making a pumpkin pie from scratch and it was FABULOUS!! Make this recipe!! Ok, so my adjustments were: reducing the sugar to a 1/4 cup (both white & brown - I used the dark kind) and adding a 1/2 cup of warmed honey. If you're using fresh SUGAR pumpkin, I suggest cutting it into chunks and steaming them flesh side down for 25 mins, then mashing them up. I used a food processor and it works wonderfully, too. It is time consuming, but the payoff is worth it! Thanks Jim (and Mom, too). ;)

I doubled this recipe to make two deep dish Thanksgiving pies.  One was sold for charity and the buyer came back later and gave them double the price saying it was THE best pumpkin pie he'd ever had.  I did have to cook it 2 hours, putting aluminum foil over it for 30 min. at a time so the crust wouldn't scorch.  I have also made it with only 1 c. milk at 375 for only 30 min--much faster.  This recipe is a winner!

Great Pie.  I used Pure pumpkin from a can, used a 15 oz can, so i guess it was not the full 2 cups that the recipe called for, but it worked.  Has a great texture and Fabulous flavor.  My husband loves it.  I bought prepared pie crusts, 9" deep dish and I filled both pie crusts!  Very Easy Recipe!  Thanks!

Good simple pie, it was enough for two. Not sweet enough for me but with some whipped cream it was pretty good.

This is a really good version of the traditional pumpkin pie.  It's a little lighter than most.  I wish, however, I had read the reviews ahead of time because I had a REALLY FULL 9" pie with a little batter to spare.  I could have easily made 2 pies.  I must add that out of 5 pies at the Thanksgiving meal, including a pecan and a pumpkin cheesecake, this one was gone first before the others were even half eaten!  A definite keeper!!  Thanks Jim!

After years of serving store-bought pumpkin pies, I finally decided to make my own...so glad I chose this recipe because my family still thanks me for it!!  One review from the pumpkin pie experts in the family, "Now THIS is a real pumpkin pie!"  Filling does make enough for two, but I made a deep dish gingersnap crust and doubled the bake time.  This has become an instant family favorite.  Serve with homemade spiced whipped cream and you'll be loved forever!

The taste of the pie was excellent.  I made a graham cracker crust and used it with this pie.  I baked it in a 9" x 1 1/2" glass dish and the ingredients nearly overflowed when I poured it in.  I had to be very caareful getting it into the oven.  The baking time was double what was actually called for.

I just made this yesterday for our Thanksgiving feast!  WOW!  Better than any pumpkin pie I have made before!  It was the first pie to go this year( usually pumkin is the last in our family)!  I used a deep dish crust and had just a little extra filling left, but you would be able to get two regular pies out of this recipe.  I did have to double the cooking time for the deep dish but it was well worth the wait!

I made a few changes.  Doubled the spices. It would have been way to bland otherwise.  I also cut the milk to 1 cup.  I use a quiche pan and it just fit!  I cooked it the 45 min then added an extra 9 minutes of cooking time.  It could gave used a couple of more minutes still.

This is a great recipe, and very simple! It's got lots of flavor, but you can also add 1/2 teas. or more of Pumpkin Pie Spice. I will definitely make this again!

Made this for my coworkers and it turned out great! Like a previous reader did, I added a few more dashes of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of pumpkin spice. I made one batch as directed and it filled two deep pie plates. I bought them to work and I made one for my old team before I transferred departments and gave the other to my new team the next day. Needless to say, both pies were gone by the end of each day! I got great reviews and one coworker even asked me if I'd make a whole for myself after I told he he couldn't take one home LOL

I got a lot of Acorn Squash and some butternut squash from my CSA. So I pureed that and added an equal amount of Pumpkin Pie Spice as the other spices and it turned out very good.

I did a pumpkin pie comparison (2 different pies) and this was a clear winner. It didn't seem to fare well when kept for more than a day or two, but really good, even with a good couple of inches depth of filling.

It was the very first pumpkin pie I have ever made. It was FANTASTIC. I don't like pumpkin pie very much, but I like this one. My husband loved it.I will make this recipe over and over again. I needs to cook longer by like 15 to 20 min. Plus it makes 2 pies already not 1.

Great texture - set up absolutely beautifully with a 40-minute bake time.  I used canned pumpkin, so that might account for it not being runny like some have said.  I took user advice and added a little more spice (1/2t allspice plus a bit more cinnamon and ginger), but I'd just use the recommended amounts in the future.  It was plenty spicy for my tastes.  Really pleased with my first pumpkin pie!

Not too many people ate the pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving.  Not sure if it was because this was my first pumpkin pie or because everyone was too full.  I don't care for pumpkin pie, I made it for everyone else.  Probably wouldn't make this again (easier just to buy one).

This pie was sooo easy to make and super-yummy! I didn't have any cloves so I omitted those. Turned out perfect. Also, I ended up baking for 60 min. instead of the recommended 40-45. Everyone's oven is different so just keep a close eye on it! Will be using this recipe from now on.

This pie tasted amazing!! the only downside was that I doubled the recipe, then followed it to the "T" and it made WAY more then 2 pies: it made 5. i don't know what was different, but i won't ever be changing the quantity again.

I loved this recipe!!! I really don't care for pumpkin pie, but my 4 year old son asked for it so I decided to try this recipe. It was REALLY good. He loves it. I made mini pies, much to my regret, since he is the only one that like pumpkin pie. I will be making this again.

I made this recipe exactly as stated except I used one cup of milk as other reviewers advised. The taste was wonderful but I caution you to use the pie rings right from the beginning as the crust started to burn right from the get-go. Also, I tried to make two pies out of the filling but was only able to make one 9" and one 8".

I am very disappointed... I decided to give this pie a try before Thanksgiving - thank goodness I did.  It will not be on the table for T-day!  I followed suggestions from other reviews, bought sugar pumpkins, baked them and pureed the pumpkin.  I decreased the milk slightly.  The pie has very little pumpkin flavor.  I'm willing to admit it might be the pumpkins I used, but I'm not sure how to solve that problem.  Plus, it is a unappetizing brown color.  It took an additional 25 minutes to bake.  Sorry Jim, but I am going back to my own mother's pumpkin pie recipe.

Excellent pie! This is really good. I like my pie a bit sweeter and a bit spicier so I aded 1/4 cup sugar and did not use sugar in my crust, and doubled the spices. It set really well and I didn't add the third cup of pumpkin puree like some bakers said to do. It is not watery and tastes even better when eaten cold the next day. So good, thanks so much for the recipe!

I liked this pie.  Since I usually have 1% milk on hand I sub.  half of the milk for evaporated milk with is thicker.  I ended up being able to use 2/3 of the batter and quickly made some tart shells for the rest of the batter.  It took  about 55 minutes for the pie to set. I think this pie can be reduced or simply divided up into two pie shells. I served it with fresh whipped cream- it was nice.

This recipe is great. I added 1 T of molasses and 1 T of bourbon for a deeper richer pumpkin pie.

This was a really good pumpkin pie filling.  Take the other reviewers advice about using fresh pumpkin vs. canned.  I'd never done it before, but their instructions worked perfectly.  It's not particularly time consuming either, in fact, you shoul prep the pumpkin the night before and let it "dry out" a bit in the fridge overnight (use the collander w/ a coffee filter method).  I also increased the spices on this, because I love pumpkin pie spice.  Otherwise, this is excellent!

LOOOOOVE this recipe!  I follow the directions to a T and it turns out great everytime.  I doubled the recipe and made 3 9" deep dish pies, cooking each for 10 minutes longer because it was still a little liquidy on top.  Served cold with whipped cream.  

We kept one, I sent one to a co-worker's family and one to work.  EVERYONE devoured it.  Even three people who generally do not like pumpkin pie had seconds and raved about the recipe!  My boyfriend had two peices everyday until it was gone, and he never eats sweets.  A WONDERFUL recipe, and I'm already being asked to make more.

Very good, easy to make in a hurry. The recipe made enough filling for two pies though, so cut it in half, or have two crusts ready!

This pie was a big hit -- the ginger really brings out the flavour. If you let it settle for a few days before you eat it, it's even better.

I make this recipe every Thanksgiving and Christmas, with RAVE reviews.  One year I made six different recipes for pumpkin pie, and this one was the unanimous winner (we had 17 people over, that year). Thank you, Jim, for sharing Mom's recipe with all of us!

Yum! A delicious spicy pie. I had to use canned pumpkin so I reduced the salt a bit, and I only used 1 cup of milk. There weren't enough leftovers so I'm making another one today!!

I read the reviews stating how there was almost enough for two pies.  I made a deep dish pie and the amount was perfect.  I did cover the crust half way through and cooked it about 10 minutes longer, but it was perfect.  I would also suggest serving this chilled.

This was the first pie I ever made and it was a great choice. The filling is moist, cramy, and very flavorful. Plus, it is easy to make. Definitely a new tradition for the holidays at my house.

Wonderful!  Everyone who tried it said it was the Best or one of the best they've ever tasted.  Great compliment for this newer cook.  After the other reviews I made this in a 10-inch pie pan and it fit perfectly.  Refrigerate overnight.  Turned out beautifully!  Thank you!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was gone before the 
end of the day!  I used whipped cream spiced with cinnamom
and ginger which was perfect.  It is too much for just one pie --
make sure to buy 2 pies shells or better yet, 
some ready made tartlett shells and make 
additional mini-pies.

I also found this made two pies. I made
it for Thanksgiving, and everyone raved
about them! (I used fresh pumpkin puree)
This recipe was also a tad on the sweet
side, so next time, I'll reduce the sugars.
It's a keeper!

Quite runny, should have used less milk. Love the spice taste, which was perfect. The recipe says 9" pie, we had a 9" store bought shell and we had enough mixture for two pies (but only one shell). Ended up cooking the rest of the mixture in a dish, served it like pudding. I think as a deep dish pie the quantity would have been right, but i'm not sure if it would have been cooked in the middle. We'll probably pick a different recipe next time or modify this one.

Delicious! The spices were great. I made the filling to a tee but it was super runny so I added more pumpkin and doubles the spices and it still took forever to bake. I'll double spices and cut the milk at least in half next times

Loved this recipe - my husband said it was the best pumpkin pie he's ever had. I used home made pumpkin puree, and I doubled up the cinnamon and nutmeg, and it was amazing. Even better the next day! Will be keeping this recipe for all the pumpkin pies from now on.

My family loves this recipe. This is the recipe that I adjusted the spices for personal taste, as I always do.  Every time I make it people love the taste of the pumpkin. I have made this recipes for 3 years and the only complaint I had was when I under cooked the pumpkin and it was still crunchy lol! Tip. I find it better if you cook your pumpkin in the oven instead of steaming it. If you have too much liquid this is most likely the cause you'll need to adjust the liquid. Well done!

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving. I double the spices like a few reviews had stated, but I think I would leave out or reduce the amount of clove and ginger. It overpowered the pumpkin pie flavor for me

Definitely should make this into 2 pies.  As I filled one pastry shell, it almost overflowed and I thought to myself, this is going to take forever to bake.  I was right - it took forever, and ended up burning around the edges.  After an hour and 10 minutes, the middle was still pure mush.  The flavor was okay, but couldn't really tell because it was so mushy.  I may try it again, but will make 2 pies.

WOW! I thought regular Libby's pumpkin pie recipe was good, this was SO much more flavorful and decadent! My goodness. You have never had pumpkin pie like this! Try it! Only thing I changed was that I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk, and I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of allspice. Oh, and I didn't use fresh pumpkin, I used 1 regular sized can of Libby's 100% Pure Pumpkin. This made 2 Pet Ritz deep dish pies (baked together on a cookie sheet, important!)and it got RAVE reviews!

This was really good. I followed the recipe to a T. Thanks to Luv2cook, I got two pie pumpkins and steamed them to make my pumpkin puree. I doubled the cinnamon. Next time I will follow the oven temp, because it took too long in my microwave/convection oven and the bottom crust got too done.

The only reason I didn't give this a better rating is because I haven't tasted it yet. It's in the oven now and my house smells amazing! It looks delicious and I can't wait. It did make way more than enough so I just put the remainder in a loaf pan and it's in the oven as well. This pie is also much more presentable than a "pie-in-a-can" pie. I just checked it and hated that I had to stick a knife in the middle of it! My pies usually crack but not this one!  EDIT:I'm making this pie for a second time today because the first one was that amazing. I'm making this one for a friend (we're trading a pumpkin roll for a pumpkin pie) and I'm making another one for my family tonight. It's fantastic! The only thing I didn't enjoy last time was that the pumpkin layer was too thin (my crust was just way too thick). Also instead of using ginger and cloves I used 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and a whole teaspoon of cinnamon. FABULOUS!

I made the pie exactly as written. It was very good, and the only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is because it wasn't the absolute BEST pumpkin pie I've ever had - but it was good and I would recommend it. :O)

I always thought pumpkin pie was boring, so I made this one for my husband as it's his favorite and it's not in the boring category anymore! Thanks!

I make this pie in my Pampered Chef stone pie plate.  All the filling fits perfect, and it bakes up to the absolute best pumpkin pie ever!!!  If there was a 10 star, I would give it :)

This came out to be VERY custard-like. It took a long time for the middle to settle as well. I had to bake it for about 15 minutes more with the crust covered.   I also didn't follow this recipe wholly. I didn't add the extra egg yolk, used a bit less white sugar, and only 1/2 c. whole milk 'cause it looked too watery.   I also didn't have ground ginger nor nutmeg on hand so... it didn't taste like a traditional pumpkin pie, haha. Will probably use this recipe again.

I've made this pie during the holidays for 4 years. Always with rave reviews. As others have said, the filling is always enough for two pies. Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy!!! I made mini pumpkin pies with the Cream Cheese Tart Shell recipe also on this site. I was scared cause my mom has always made the pumpkin pies and this was my first time trying to do it on my own- had to introduce my Australian friends to the deliciousness of pumpkin pie! This recipe is huge! I halved it and it still made 24 full size tarts (I used a regular size muffin tin). I also live in Australia and discovered that they don't have canned pumpkin here, so I was brave and used a real pumpkin! Not difficult at all, and delicious flavor!

Doubled the recipe..thinking Id get three pies..ended up with 4.  Which was a very good thing..they were basically inhaled.  I used real pumpkin puree and followed others' advice as to draining overnight.  The pies were very light and velvety. A must next year!

This is definitely the best pumpkin pie I've ever tasted (or made).  Pumpkin pie is my favorite kind of pie, but even non-pumpkin pie lovers in my extended family raved about this one.  
I did end up with a little too much filling, so I just greased a loaf pan and poured the extra into it, baked it along with the pie, and ate it when it came out!  YUMMY!

I took "luv2cook"s advice posted on 10/02/06 and used real pumpkin for the first time.  Super easy to make.  This pie made two deep dishes.  Followed the directions exactly (except sub'd the real pumpkin for the puree).  I was the new "Betty Crocker" at the holiday gathering.  This is now saved in my recipe box and will be a standard for Thanksgiving & Christmas.  NO MORE PUMPKIN PUREE!

This was my first time baking pumpkin pie and I think it went pretty well. Considering it was also the first time I ate pumpkin pie, it is quite difficult to know how to rate it. All I know is that I enjoyed baking and eating it, and my bf, who isn't a pumpkin pie beginner, thought it was great. Thanks!

Turned out very well.  First time I made a pie without using the good old canned stuff.  My mom said it was the best part of the Thanksgiving dinner!  I did as others suggested and strained the pruee over night, added more spice then the recipe called for, and baked it longer at a lower temp.

It was a perfect blend of spices.  I used a cheese pumpkin, roasted and pureed.  If the pie makes it to a second day it tastes even better.

I cut this recipe in half as suggested and had plenty for one pie. The taste of the pie was great but will definitely cook a bit longer next time - a bit too soggy.

I made this the other night for company and it was a hit.  My husband asked me to make this our usual pumpkin pie from now on.  The only thing I did different was add 1 1/2 cup cream to 1/2 cup milk just because we were out of milk.  It was very rich and tasty!

I have been baking this pie every Thanksgiving for five years, and everyone LOVES it- even those who don't normally care for pumpkin pie. I follow the recipe exactly and have great results. It's creamy with just the right balance of spices.

This was wonderful.  I doubled the recipe and it made 3 regular pies.  I cooked it about 10 minutes longer than recipe calls for.  It does rise up and it made me nervous, but it turned out great.  We loved it cooled in the fridge.  The spices were just right (I think the cloves make all the difference...).  This will be my one and only pumpkin pie recipe!

my buddy and i made four pies after doubling the recipe using disposable pie pans. they were very yummy and easy to make especially since this was both our first made-from-scratch pies. one friend said she liked the light and fluffy texture cos it made it less rich than other pies. i don't even like to eat pumpkin pie but i admit that was pretty darn good.

I made this pie, and it never did "thicken up."  Also, the flavor was a bit strange.  I think it may be a bit too spicy.

Good - nothing outstanding or unique.  Just your normal pumpkin pie.

This was a really yummy pie! I made it for thanksgiving.  However, not all of the filling would fit into the crust, and I had to extend the baking time about twenty minutes.  First, the filling puffed up really high, but eventually fell back down, and tasted great!

This was so quick and easy. I guess you could sub pumpkin pie spice for all of the others, but I really liked adding each individual spice. And it was one of the best pumpkin pies I've ever eaten. Took one to work and got lots of compliments! Thanks!!

I used 1/2 cup less milk and a little over on pumpkin puree’.
Measured heavy w spices.
Used one pie crust and filled full. Had 1 ramekin of filling left over to bake and taste test. It was good!

I stayed true to the recipe and the pie is fantastic.  This recipe easily makes 2 deep dish pies.  If I try to use regular pie crusts I end up with leftover filling.  Even with the regular pie crust size this has always taken much longer to bake than 45 minutes.  I usually start there and recheck every 10-15 minutes until it sets.  I love thebalance of spices and this recipe is so easy it has ruined store bought pumpkin pie for my family.  This is the tried and true recipe I return to year after year.

I took out all of the spices (salt, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, ground ginger, and ground cloves) for 2.75 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice.  I also used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar. We had a pan with just the filling and it was just sooo good.

I will make it again but will add more spices to it. That is a personal preference. It was light and creamy in texture and no complaints from my crew which means it was a winner!

This was an "ok" pie but the reviews from my family was "not as good your other.  My husband didn't ask for more which tells me it's not a "winner".  He loves pumpkin pie but this apparently wasn't a favorite.

This pie was delicious! The only thing I would suggest is to  use a deep dish pie plate. Too much mixture for a regular 9" plate. Therefore I had to cook it much longer for it to set.

Too sweet and eggy tasting.  Could be because my homemade pumpkin purée was already sweet tasting and I used 1 cup of half and half  instead of liquid called for. Doubled the spices and still couldn’t taste much spice.

I wanted to try a new recipe this year and made one with my old stand by and made this one as well. Both were devoured, and wonderful things said about each.  So, I think we just love pumpkin pie, but, seriously, this one is great.

Yummy!  Hubby is a real connoisseur of pumpkin pie and he gave it a BIG thumbs up!  Only issue I had was it was too much filling for the Crust!  Next time will make two pies out of it!!

I always have made pumpkin pie from the recipe on back of pumpkin can using evaporated milk. No more. This is the best. I made it exactly as recipe called for except I doubled the cinnamon. My husband rated it a 9.5 on 10 point scale only because I forgot the whipped cream! Will definitely make again. I don't know how some people got two pies. This made one full 9" pie.  I may reduce milk to 1 cup  next.  I made two and brought one to work. People are loving it wanting recipe.  Thank you for posting.

The pie tasted good but it was weird how it baked. It made about 2 cups extra and was very runny. I had to bake it almost 20 minutes longer than it called for. Definitely reduce the milk.

This pie was AMAZING.  So glad I used this recipe.  I did alter a few things.  I used 1 cup of whipping cream and 1/2 cup milk (not 2 full cups of liquid). I also used 1 slightly heaping teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and ginger, and 1/8 tsp of cloves.  I may go a PINCH heavier on the nutmeg and ginger next time.  I also made my own pumpkin puree.  This pie is now absolutely my go-to pumpkin pie recipe.  Thank you for sharing it!

I made a profile just to review this pie. I have been baking it for twice the amount of time recommended, checking every five minutes, and it WILL NOT SET UP. I trusted the overwhelmingly positive reviews, but I was wrong.

I misread the directions and forgot to buy heavy whipping cream. I used extra milk, thinking it would be okay. It looks fine, but I had to bake it an extra 25 minutes before I could pull out a clean toothpick. It seems very...jiggly(?) so I'm going to let it cool and hope it keeps its shape once I cut into it. It looks beautiful and smells great.

The changes I made: Doubled the amount of cinnamon, ginger, cloves, but not the nutmeg. Reduced the milk to 1 cup. Used unsweetened 100% pumpkin puree from can. Blind baked the pie crust for 7 minutes @ 425 degrees F. May take longer than 55 mins to bake. Once cooled it had a large crack in center, but the taste was very delicious!

Unfortunately I will not make this again. It was way too liquidy and it never fully cooked. 

If you make this, it would be helpful to bake the crust first. The crust never cooked-it was cooked through but it was soggy. The flavor of the pumpkin pie was ok. I would add a little more cinnamon and nutmeg.

So I decided to make this pie for the first time. I usually buy organic pumpkin puree and make my own crust.  This time we went pumpkin picking. At first it came out way too watery, so I add a whole mason jar full of homemade puree.  Plus I took longer than the suggested time to actually cook.  I did 10 minutes at 425, then 65 minutes at 325, came out perfect.  Not an overwhelming taste which i prefer. Would try again with less liquid.

Tasty but the recipe calls to make only for one 9" pie and I had enough to make 2 pies and plus it was too liquidy and took too long to bake.

Made this as is except that I omitted 1 whole egg and used 1 can of evaporated milk for the liquid and used all brown sugar. The pumpkin filling was very creamy and rich in flavor. I will be using this recipe as my go to recipe in the future with these  modifications. I made these modifications after reading other reviews.

Substituted the milk ingredients for non-dairy creamer and left out the cloves. Came out very creamy and almost had a cheesecake-like consistency. Made it about 4 times around Halloween/Thanksgiving season and my friends devoured it all!  Definitely will be making it on a yearly basis.

The flavors of the pumpkin were great to my taste, I would say it was mild in spices. The pie took a lot longer than the suggested time. I cranked up the oven to  375  for 20 additional minutes then on convection for 10 more minutes at 350.

I didn't have ground clove so I added a 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and a 1/4 tsp of maple extract. I'm not really a pumpkin pie fan, but I liked this one.

I cooked it extra long because it would NOT set. I thought I had it ready but when it cooled and I cut into the pie it was runny and flavorless. Glad I made an extra to try before taking it to church.

This is as good as it gets!  Just like store bought pie.  The only thing I did differently was to use a can of evaporated milk instead of the milk and cream as I didn't have any and it worked out brilliantly.   This will be my go-to recipe from now on

My pie was filled to the brim and I still had some filling left. After cooking for an hour I took the pie out of the oven. I thought it would set more as it cooled, but nope. But my house smelled delicious.

I wish I had read through all the reviews before I followed the recipe. The pie was extremely runny and needed more than double the time to cook. I covered the pie crust with foil after the first 50 minutes of baking at 350, after baking for 10 minutes at 425, and I baked the pie for another 40 minutes. I added 1.5 times the spices and am hoping I am able to serve it tomorrow for Thanksgiving.

It's great and easy. I use my Cuisinart, any food processor will do. 1) make sure fresh puree has sufficiently drained 2)combine and blend ALL ingredients and mix WELL before adding pumpkin. 3) I use pumpkin spice plus cinnamon. Its easier than a tsp of this and that. Don't forget to increase the pumpkin spice for each separate spice you replace. Or spice or sweeten to taste. It's easy to alter. Firms well. Pretty much fool proof.

This recipe is great. Needed to tweek it a little. More spice and less milk. Still seems a little too wet. But I also use fresh pumpkin. Everyone seems to love it!

This makes a huge amount of filling so make sure that your crust is really 9 inches. Also many of us used our own home made pumpkin puree which is usually much thinner than the canned stuff. I added a tbsp of flour as well as using half the milk /cream. This was not my favourite but like most kitchen creations the result is subjective.

This was the first pie I ever made, and it was a huge success despite the fact that I screwed up the recipe a little on accident! (I accidentally did a whole 4th egg instead of just the yolk). I even used store-bought pie crust. Everyone loved it, including myself.

I like the recipe, however when I make it again, I will increase the spice mix by half as this ratio is a little on the bland side.

So good!! I love that it's all fresh ingredients, no canned milk or pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice etc. I roasted my pumpkin and then pureed in the blender. I think I may cut down on the milk a tad and add a little extra spice, but as is, it's still a 5 star recipe. To do this recipe justice I made pie crust and whipped cream from scratch too! I think I can get 2 pies from this, as I filled the shell to the top and had a lot left over! I'm impressed and can't wait to show off my new skills this season :-)

Delicious. I got two pies out of the one recipe. I was happy that this didn't take evaporated milk because I was out and didn't want to make a trip out to the store. I added extra spices because we like our pumpkin pie a little spicy. Served with some homemade whipped cream. Yum!

I doubled this recipe b/c I wanted to make 2 pies, but found that I had enough filling for more then 3 pies.  I baked 2 pies in my shells and just baked the rest in a casserole dish...made a yummy custard! It set up very well, pies baked for ten min. @ 425° then nearly an hour at 350°...came out perfect.  So I wish the recipe was labeled as is for 2 small pies...and I agree w/ some reviewers  that 1 cup of milk is probably plenty.  Spiciness was just right, it also depends on the age/potency of your spices...they don't keep forever!  Good recipe.

This was my first time making pumpkin pie from scratch and it came out amazing. I think my only complaint is that somehow I ended up with enough filling for two store bought deep-dish pie crusts, instead of just one pie. No matter, cause it was so good we ate both of them anyway.

A-mazing!  And very easy.  Most pumpkin pie recipes make too much of the filling for one pie, including this one.  No problem, just have two pie shells ready!  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this recipe! We made these pies for thanksgiving and they were the best pumpkin pies ever. We did have to bake them a lot longer than the recipe said. About 45 min longer. I will use this one again! I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1/2 tsp. Also we added 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice to it just to make sure. It was perfect!

My sister-in-law in New Zealand had never heard of pumpkin pie. So while I was visiting her and my brother, I pulled up this recipe for her. Her first ever pumpkin pie turned out flawless!!! We surprised my brother with it when he came home from work, and he made "yummy" sounds with every bite! This recipe was quick and easy, and tasted incredible. Thanks!

I misread the recipe & did 2 cans of pumpkin rather than 2 cups of pumpkin puree.  I was worried it wouldn't come out & I think it tasted great!  Cooked for quite a bit over the time it said.  that's when I realized what I had done!  Anyways, great pumpkin pie flavor!  This recipe is a keeper!

very light tasting and delicious but somehow I ended up with enough filling for 2 pie crusts (with filling 3/4 to the top).  Bonus I guess cos now I get 2 pies out of 1 recipe!

I made this pumpkin pie a few years ago for Thanksgiving. Ever since that day I have been voluntold (volunteered/told) to make pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving AND Christmas dinners. This recipe is easy to make and has a WONDERFUL taste. The brown sugar adds to the wonderful flavor of this pie. I look forward to Thanksgiving even more now. Family, football, great food and GREAT pie.

very good.  I didn't have cream, so I used the French vanilla non-dairy creamer I had on hand.  It worked!  The pie took a lot longer to cook for me.  It had an egg-ier taste than I'm used to, but I like that!  I'd recommend it.  And my family liked it, too.

This recipe was phenomenal!! I recently moved from the US to Australia where you cannot buy canned pumpkin so I took the liberty of buying a pumpkin, cooking and pureeing it.  It turned out fabulous. I am a bit disappointed I didn't take pictures because the pies, which actually yielded 2 9 inch pies for me, was beautiful!! I would recommend a tab bit more nutmeg - to make it like grandma's, however, this was fab!! Thanks!!

We don't get canned pumpkin here in Sweden, so I use raw shredded pumpkin, and it is just wonderful!

Fantastic!  This was incredibly easy to make and tasted absolutely delicious.  As other recommended, I increased the spices and only used 1 cup of milk.  Turned out perfectly!

This recipe was a huge hit on Thanksgiving!  Everybody loved it.  In Fact, I got a few "it's the best pumpkin pie I've ever had" reviews!  I didn't chang anything but I would reccommend that you make two crusts because there is enough filling for two whole pies!

This recipe was great! I added an extra cup of pumpkin as recommended by others.  The recipe was easy to make dairy free - I used 1 cup soy milk  in place of the milk, and 1/2 cup Silk Soy Creamer in place of the heavy cream and it turned out FANTASTIC!

If you like traditionally flavored pumpkin pie, this is an excellent choice with a great balance of spices.  However, I was disappointed with a couple of things.  First, the uncooked pie filling is very soupy (not the thickness you expect from a pumpkin pie).  It took over an hour to set in my oven at the temperature called for in the instructions.  The other drawback is that the recipe, as measured, makes much more pie than can fit in a pie crust.  I ended up pouring a lot of it down the drain.

I cooked this for my Irish boyfriend's family as part of a Thanksgiving meal. Because I'm in Ireland and can't find canned pumpkin puree, I used real pumpkin.  It was very easy to do, but because I only bought a section of the pumpkin (already de-seeded), I didn't have quite enough for 2 full cups.  I read in other reviews to let it drain overnight, but I had to settle for letting it drain for several hours and then squeezing out the excess liquid. The mixture looked very watery before I baked it, but the eggs made it thicken up, and it turned out to be a really nice pie.  I'll definitely use the recipe again. I used the no-roll pie crust found on this website, and that went well with it, too.

My husband is a huge pumpkin pie fan, so I've been looking for a great recipe, and unfortunatley, this is not it. First off, it took a lot longer than expected for the center to set, and by that time my crust was browner than I would have liked. Secondly, the spices in the filling just weren't right. There were too many spice flavors, perhaps it was the clove. Oh well, I guess I will continue to search.

I don't know why this pie didn't turn out well, but it was very bland.  I made two pumpkin pie recipes for Thanksgiving, and this one was definitely not as good as the other.  There wasn't much pumpkin taste to the pie.

Perfect!  I was looking for a custardy, as opposed to dense, pumpkin pie, with exactly the right amount of seasonings, and this was it.  If any of you remember the pumpkin pies made by the Plush Pippin restaurant chain, this is very similar.  Instead of cream, I used canned non-fat milk.    This will definitely be replacing the Libby's pumpkin pie recipe that always left me dreaming of a more custard-like recipe.  Yum!

I was very satisfied with this recipe. This was the first time I made a pumpkin pie from scratch. I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have ground cloves. I did have whole cloves, so I crushed enough to equal 1/2 teaspoon. It worked out fine. I definitely recommend this recipe. Thanks.

This pie was just okay - nothing to write home about.  I used a deep dish pie crust and had enough filling leftover to make part of another pie, so I mixed up another 1/4 of a batch of filling to make a second pie - didn't want to waste it.  Also, I too, had to bake this pie almost 1 hour longer than the recipe noted.  Overall, I found this recipe to be somewhat inconvenient and not worth the trouble.

This pie was wonderful. I made enough for 32 serving for the first time.  Everyone loved it. Especially my husband who hates pumpkin pie. Depending on the crust you use there may be enough filling for a couple extra pies. Also this pie was great served with spiced whipped topping or regular whipped topping. Depends on your taste buds!

Mmmmm, this was excellent. I chose to use this one because it didn't need evaporated milk and I didn't fancy another trip to the supermarket today! But it's the best pumpkin pie I've had. (not that my experience of pumpkin pie is very great, having only had it on holiday to the US).

I agree with the other reviewers who said that (1) this produced more than enough liquid for one pie - I may make two pies with the recipe next time or reduce the milk. Also (2) it took WAY longer than the suggested bake time. Mine also puffed up like a souffle and then settled when I took it out of the oven. However, after all of that, this recipe produced a pie with a very nice flavor. And I like using fresh milk and cream, rather than condensed, so that appealed to me!

It needs a little more spice & less milk. The mix was too watery and didn't bake well. Maybe just try evaporated milk instead of both heavy cream & milk.

I made this pie yesterday and I am very disappointed with it.  It is bland and it has a strange eggy texture.  It took 2 hours to bake, even my tarts took 45 minutes.  If you must try this recipe, I would suggest adding more spices (maybe even add a couple of spoons of molasses), and maybe reducing the milk.  It was very runny, and while it did eventually firm up, it took hours.  
As with other reviewers, I found it made much too much filling.

Outstanding. I used a deep dish glass bake dish. I did need to cook it a little longer, 10 min. or so but that could have been my oven. All and all we loved it. Very light and delicious!! I tested this recipe to make in a few weeks for Thanksgiving and it definitely will be served!!!

This is a great recipe. I will say the best pumpkin pie I have ever ate. I used fresh pumpkin and needed to cook the pie slightly longer than in the recipe.

Delicious! When I was making it, the filling was SO liquid I though it would be a desaster! But while cooking, it started rising like a soufflé, and after cooling it an hour or 2, it was just perfect! I added more cinnamon, and didn't add cloves. I sprinkled some of the topping in  Brown Family's Favorite Pumpkin Pie, and used Grandma's Secret Pie Crust.

My Dad doesn't like pumpkin pie, but he ate 3 huge slices of this last Thanksgiving, and I'm glad I found the recipe again cause this is going to be my permanent recipe!!  I bake it in the pie shell recipe from Apple Pie by Grandma Ople and it' fantastic!!  put some fresh whipped cream (not from the can) on a warm slice and it'll have people's toes curling!!  So yummy!

Very tasty and creamy pie. I used homemade pumpkin puree, doubled the cinnamon, and eliminated the cloves. Like others, I found this recipe made 2 pies. I guess it would make one deep dish pie. This recipe is much creamier than the one on the can of pumpkin. Great pie!!!!

Definitely the best pumpkin pie recipe I've ever used.  There was plenty of filling for two nine inch pie crusts and they set up beautifully.  The heavy cream makes all the difference.  I just bought pumpkin pie spice instead of all the individual spices and the flavor was perfect.  I made 6 pies for Thanksgiving and my family demanded 6 more for Christmas.

This is the only pumpkin pie recipe I ever use. It has just the right amount of spices. The filling is enough to fill 2 frozen pie crusts or one deep dish pyrex-type pie dish.

It was too much liquid so the cooking time had to be almost doubled.  If I had read the other reviews first I would have seen that it in fact was enough for two pies.  In the end it tasted OK, but too rich for my tast.

My family all loves pumpkin pie & this pie received the highest reviews at the last gathering.
