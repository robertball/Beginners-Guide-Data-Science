I have made these cookies several times and have tried several different cake mixes.  Each cake mix results in a different texture and flavor.  So it's important to know that the dough may not be easily workable, but if that is the case just make a bar cookie instead of the individual cookies.  The following cake mixes worked well: (just remember to refrigrate over night) -Lemon Cake Mix (nice dough)(use lemon extract instead of vanilla) and if you would like make a lemon glaze and drizzle over cookie when cooled.  (These got a lot of rave reviews when I made them). - Cherry Chip cake mix (nice dough) got rave reviews, devils food cake mix (sticky dough)good taste, german chocolate (nice dough), Carmel cake mix (forget it, very sticky dough- is workable to some degree you just wont get as many cookies. Next I want try carrot cake mix, strawberry cake mix, and spice cake mix.  
I did discover that it's better to refrigrate over night and use a small cookie scoop,  My scoop is big so once I scoop a cookie out of the dough I cut it in half, roll it and then shake it in a baggy with powdered sugar.   In my oven 12 min. exact is the cooking time any longer these cookies get a crispy burnt bottom.
I hope everyone enjoys trying these other cake mixes as well as my family, neighbors and friends have.
:)
(update)  Strawberry cake was pretty good.  But our newest favorite rave review cake choice is Orange. I just made lemon cookies and orange cookies for a church social and then again

I suggest instead of using Yellow cake mix use Yellow Butter Cake Mix.  The yellow butter cake mix give the cookie a texture that closer resemble the gooey butter cake.

Another St. Louis favorite!!  These are just like the ones I get at Dierbergs when I go back home...took them to work and they were gone in minutes.  Key is to not overbake.  Super easy to make...now I just need an Imos pizza with provel cheese...ohhh a girl can dream!

These cookies are incredibly delicious! I made them for a bake sale, and although they appeared kind of plain at first, once people tasted them, they came back for more! I cannot wait to try this recipe with different flavors of cake mix next time. If you are lucky enough to have any left, they taste even better a few hours after they come out of the oven. One warning, though: It may seem as though the baking time may be off, but DO NOT OVERBAKE. It is just about right. The cookies will continue to cook a bit once they are out of the oven. They are soft and just melt in your mouth. The last thing you want is a burned cookie. Definitely try this one. Mmm mmm good.

Folks just love these cookies. "Like a little bit of heaven in your mouth".  A few notes that would make this cookie dough easier to handle.
One dough is made, put in fridge for 2 hours or overnight.  This will make it easier to work with. 
Also, when rolling the dough I will put a light spray of Pam or Mazola cooking spray on my hands which keeps it from sticking.

Some of my “finds” on this site are only as a result of my using the ingredient search for ideas when I have something in particular I need to use – in this case it was cream cheese.  If it wasn’t for that necessity I don’t know that I would have actively chosen this recipe, which in the end happily proved to be one of those “finds.”  The dough is difficult to work with because it’s sticky and mushy and gooey.  The cookie isn’t gooey, as its title describes, but the dough sure is.  If I wasn’t so impatient I would have chilled it until good and firm, but who knows – maybe it would have made this a different cookie.  I used a French Vanilla cake mix, the flavor of which I believe is far superior to either a white or yellow cake mix (but especially the yellow).  I had recently purchased raspberry baking tidbits from Amazon.com and knew this would be a good time to use them – I added just shy of a cup.  Because the dough was so soft it was kind of a pain to roll the little mush balls in the powdered sugar, and in hindsight I wouldn’t bother with that step because you couldn’t really see it on the finished cookie anyway. Needless to say, with a stick of butter and an 8-ounce package of cream cheese, these are very rich, soft cookies, but oh are they good, particularly, I think, because of the addition of the raspberry baking tidbits - not sure I’d like these just plain.  I think mini chocolate chips as well as any number of other additions would also work well in this cookie.

"Best Chocolate Chip Cookie Ever" - a direct quote from my boyfriend. These were super simple and super delicious. I sprinkled powdered sugar over half of the baked cookies and added chocolate chips to the other half. I highly recomend adding the chocolate chips. : ) 
Don't bother with refrigerating the dough and rolling it into balls. Just treat it as normal cookie dough and use a cookie scoop. This worked perfect for me. Super simple!!!

These cookies are the best! You can subsitute a chocolate cake mix for a delicious chocolate version. My dad doesn't like sweets but he couldn't stop eating these. He wants these for his birthday instead of a cake. Also make sure you chill the dough for about 30 min before rolling in the powdered sugar.

These cookies are DELICIOUS!  I have served them three different times in one month.  My suggestions - 1) make them about half the suggested size since they're so rich, 2) cook them for longer than suggested, about 17 minutes even for the smaller size, 3) ENJOY!

I had no trouble whatsoever molding these cookies.  I just used my cookie scoop and dropped them into the powdered sugar, then rolled them around a bit.  I started with the l T. scoop, which makes l inch cookies, then changed to the 2 T. scoop.  Also had to adjust the timing.  Micky

These are so so yummy. Only change was to add a full tsp  vanilla, and 1/2 tsp. rum extract.  The dough is wonderful to work with, didn't refrigerate at all. First batch was rolled in 10x sugar before baking and it didn't leave much on the cookie out of the oven so the rest I just rolled in sugar after out of the oven, and did some with holiday sprinkles before baking. So buttery, rich, and love the texture. almost tastes like a rich cheesecake. They stay nice and soft too. thanks for this very versatile recipe with lots of combinations of cake mixes and additions of nuts, chips, etc.

Good and easy. Use a quality cake mix though. I also thought the 350 degree was a bit high. 325 more like it. I used silpat liners and mine still browned on the bottom and I know my oven temp is spot on. Because they hold their shape if you drop them from a cookie scoop you could flatten a bit with a spatula for example and they may cook quicker and then 350 might be ok. I didn't roll in powdered sugar but frosted and dipped in sprikles and color sugar for festive Christmas cookies. The dough is sticky though so best to chill for at least two hours. They hold their shape and don't spread. Must use full fat cream cheese and real butter!

These cookies are FANTASTIC!  I added 1/4 tsp of Almond extract in addition to the vanilla and used a small ice cream scoop to make my balls because handling them was way too messy.  I have made these twice in the last two weeks because my husband ate almost all of the cookies the first round!

These cookies were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. They were the first to disappear from my Christmas cookie trays; I am now on my fourth batch. Daughter and Husband can't get enough of these little gems. Just refrigerate overnight and they're a breeze to handle. Thanks so much for this recipe... it's a major keeper!

I followed this recipe almost exactly.  I didn't have powdered suger so I used regular sugar.  Also, half of the batch was made to the recipe.  The other half, I added 1/4 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  The butter cookies were good, but a bit too gooey (almost doughy) to me.  I would cook that a few minutes longer in the future, but the taste was really good.

The batch with the choc chips and pecans was by far the best though.  It added much more texture and flavor and was delish!  

I am eager to try this recipe again with Chocolate cake and peanut butter chips ... or macadamia nuts and white chocolate chips ... combinations are endless.  

Thanks for the great recipe!

I used a Butter Recipe Yellow cake mix because that is what I had in the house. I made the batter, very easy to do, and refrigerated it overnight. Lined my cookie sheet with parchment paper and used a small Pampered Chef cookie scoop which worked great. Can't wait to try different flavored cake mixes. It made 5 dozen cookies.

This is a go-to staple for cookies.  I've made with yellow butter cake (we like that better than just yellow cake), devil's food, red velvet, spice and pineapple upside down cake mixes.  For the spice cake version, I roll in cinnamon sugar.  For the pineapple upside down version, I add in shredded coconut and use rum instead of vanilla.  They taste just like pina coladas!

Before rolling out, I also find it helpful to refrigerate the mix for at least an hour. Then I remove my rings and spray my hands with cooking spray.  The batter melts as you are rolling it and can get very sticky.

Sad to say, but these were not anything speical.  They were okay.  I would not bother to make them again.  I would use the cake mix for a cake and could make much better use of cream cheese.  They were easy.

I just made these cookies for the first time.  They are very delicious!  They're so easy to make.  I read the reviews before making these and it seemed like there were a lot of complaints about the dough being hard to work with because it's sticky.  A lot of reviewers mentioned refrigerating the dough before forming into balls.  I made the cookie dough and yes it's pretty sticky.  I put it in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.  When I took it out it was still sticky.  I scooped out the dough with my cookie scooper (it looks like a mini ice cream scooper) and dropped the dough balls from the scooper straight into the powdered sugar.  The dough scooped up well and came out of the cookie scooper easily.  Once the cookie dough balls got coated with the powdered sugar they were no longer sticky.  I made the recipe exactly as directed (aside from refrigerating).  I wouldn't change anything.  These are very good as is.  This is definitely a keeper for my family.  Everyone loved them!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Sooo good! I'm from St Louis, and it tastes just like the gooey butter cake here. I love these. I think if people were having too many problems with sticky dough they need to make sure not to melt the butter when you are making them. I microwaved the butter just a couple seconds so it wouldn't be so frozen, but don't melt it at all or you will have dough that is too sticky. Mine came out perfectly. I was concerned when I didn't add any powdered sugar to the batter cause all the gooey butter cake recipes I've read do that, but it does not need it! Just rolling them in it is enough, and these are some RICH cookies. But so is gooey butter cake. If you don't like rich, don't make them. I baked them 11 minutes and they came out perfectly. I agree.. don't overbake or they won't be just slightly gooey.. and that's what makes them great!

These were good, but not as good as the gooey butter cake. I found that dropping the dough by spoonfuls into a small bowl of powdered sugar, then rolling into balls, made the process less messy. Chilling the dough slightly helped also.

I just took these out of the oven!!! OMG They are heavenly!! And to think I started to trash them cause I thought they would be too cake-like. And so did my daughter. Dont let the recipe fool you, and MOST OF ALL do not over cook!! They will be a little gooey when you first take them out but dont worry they will be fine...YUM

Pretty good.  I made them with chocolate cake mix.  The batter was pretty stiff but sticky so I put it in the fridge for an hour or two.  I got just over 3 dozen cookies out of this batch with a tablespoon sized scoop.

Just made these for the first time last night.  Very good yellow cake flavor - I don't know if I'd call it "buttery" flavor - but that's okay becuase they are still tasty.  I don't know how "gooey" they really are, they are more soft-centered than gooey.  But everyone seemed to enjoy them at our potluck and I'd definitely make them again.  Thank you!

This is exactly the recipe for which I was looking! I love the butter cookies in STL- surprised that there was only one that I found on this site. I followed the recipe exactly- perfecto! In my gas oven a cooking time of 13 minutes gave the perfect consistency. They were still totally soft and cakey, but not doughy or runny. I finished my cookies by sifting even more powdered white sugar all over them making them even more mouth watering looking and tasting! Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies taste exactly like the cake.  Yes, they are soft, but that is exactly like the cake!  It helps to refridgerate the dough before handling.  These cookies were so easy my 9 year old made them and loved taking all the credit!

I love this recipe, i make them every year around the holidays, its a great recipe for me because my 3 year old can help roll them in the powdered sugar and she has a blast, but i usually put these in a tupperware container and put them in the freezer overnight before having them at any parties or what not, my little brother said "They are like cake and ice cream mixed together in a little cookie, these are heavenly!!!!" They are good warm or cold!

I've made these cookies several times now. They're easy to make, and everyone loves them! My boyfriend has brought them to work, and his coworkers won't stop asking him to bring more. A few notes on the recipe: I bake them using Butter Cake Mix instead of Yellow Cake Mix. Last time I baked them, I put the dough in the fridge for about 15 minutes before shaping it into balls. This made the dough easier to work with. If you don't refrigerate it, it can be pretty gooey. So I'd recommend refrigerating it for at least 15-20 minutes (if not longer) if time allows.

My husband is a strict chocolate chip cookie fan.  He looks so disappointed when he finds out I'm "trying a new recipe".  I'm happy to report that he's excited when he finds out I'm making these instead of chocolate chip. A few tips - You don't need to refridgerate the dough before rolling in powdered sugar, just be gentle.  I use a cookie disher and drop the dough into a small bowl of powdered sugar, tossing them lightly then fishing them out with a fork or my fingers.  They come out perfect everytime.

These are great!  Try using a pineapple cake mix and chopping up maraschino cherries and adding to the batter.  Roll in brown sugar.  Pineapple upside down cookies. YUM

Lovely, soft bites. Good, but not what I'd ever call great. Very respectable, however, for a "hurry up" treat. Only 4 stars, because I could still taste the cake mix artificial flavor, although it was much slighter than with other cake mix cookie recipes. The cream cheese helps to mask it.  Perhaps adding some lemon zest or toasted nuts would help further. I did not find them to be objectionably sweet, and I have a low sweetness tolerance. Be advised that these do not spread, not even a little. I used a small scoop, and got small dome-shaped cookies. Nothing wrong with that, per se, but if you're looking for more substantial size, either use a bigger scoop (mine holds a little over a tablespoon) and bake longer, or flatten them somewhat with your fingers before baking. Ten minutes seems just right for a very soft (but not "gooey") cookie. I could see making these again if I'm pressed for time, but because they taste like you used a convenience product, they'll never be a first choice for me.

These tasted like miniature cakes, and while they were good, they didn't taste gooey, or anything like the ooey gooey cake i've had.  I think they need some frosting on them or sandwiched between 2 cookies.  After people complained about the lack of taste, i added 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 T of vanilla.  I also added another egg to help with the batter consistency (all my other recipes take 2).  I tried 16 min, 12 min, and 10 min in the oven to see the various changes.  The 16 min held together better, but were almost like dry cake.  The 12 min ones were much more moist, but still not gooey.  And even the 10 min ones didn't end up goey.  I also used a cookie scoop and ended up with close to 48 cookies rather than 2 dozen.  If you want a portable cake, this is your pick.  If you are looking for a cookie that tastes like Ooey cake, this isn't it.

My entire family loves these cookies.  Light and tasty! They are a quick and easy cookie for when you are pressed for time.  I also bake them for a neighbor who is a little particular about what she likes (she usually buys from a bakery), and her family loves them too.  Try them!

I just made these today. I thought I would try a new kind of cookie to give out with others for Christmas. I thought they were just okay. It tasted a lot like yellow cake mix and was pretty much the consistency of cake. They tasted fine but nothing special. Don't think I'd bother making these again.

I am a "cook by recipe only" baker, so I followed the recipe exactly, and these turned out just perfectly. Just like Gooey Cake in a bite size version. I had to put them in the freezer to keep us from eating the entire batch in one evening!

These are so wonderful. Light and good tasting. A precious cookie that I would love to bring to a tea party. Putting dough in fridge for a bit did help the stickiness. I didn't think they were too sweet at all. Came out of oven on the minute mark of 12. Too soon they would fall apart more easily. Big hit at my husbands work and they are mostly all men.

Made these exactly per recipe.  Baked some plain, some with mini chocolate chips some with Butterscotch chips and finally others with butterscotch chips with crushed almonds.  The ones with butterscotch and almonds was by far the best.  Baed at 325 (convection oven) for 12 minutes and they were perfect.  Definitely will make again and looking forward to using orange cake mix per another review.

SOOOO GOOOOOD!  I made them for my family, they practically ate them all right away (so you must double it!) and then my oldest went to the store to buy the ingredients on the way to her home.  Great! Super soft.  Not too doughy.  The powdered sugar is a great added touch.  I didn't change a thing!  Thanks!!

Got RAVE reviews on these cookies.  These were so good.  and like everyone says, don't cook too long, take out when you think they're still kinda doughy.  I made yellow cake and spice cake.  both delicious.  I also used the plastic gloves to help roll them, that helped tremendously.  Very good!

Certified DELICIOUS! :) 

I found the dough to be wonderfully easy to work with. I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spread instead of softened butter and also used whipped frosting. It made a wonderfully play-dough textured dough really easy to work with. It's also fun rolling in cake sprinkles :)

Also, the 10-13 baking time is rather correct or else the bottoms will burn which you don't want

This cookie doesn't spread very much when it bakes. Instead it puffs up so you can easily put a bunch of them on the baking sheet at a time. Also, when I made it, the amount was much more than 2 dozen. Made about 30 cute little puffy cookies.

Living in St. Louis, if you have a great Gooey Butter cake recipe you always need to find a great Gooey Butter cookie recipe too. I made these for my sister after she gave birth to my niece and she said she (and her fiance) couldn't stop eating them...I couldn't either! It was a good thing I doubled the recipe because I don't know how many I ate just out of the oven! Thanks for sharing!

Made a version of these using strawberry cake mix for my boyfriend's birthday. They were really pretty good. I put one batch in the fridge to keep and one in the freezer. The ones in the fridge got kind of mushy and I had to throw them out, but the one's in the freezer are keeping really well and to me actually taste great frozen! I frosted half of them, but honestly I think that these cookies stand alone better without frosting! Thanks for the recipe :)

Yummy! I just made these with a couple of additions & changes and they are delicious! I used some lemon extract instead of vanilla. I added dried cranberries and white chocolate chips and didn't bother chilling or rolling in powdered sugar. I just scooped them onto the baking tray and about a minute before they were done, I opened the oven and flattened a bit with a fork. We loved these & will make again. I think next time I will make the same way, but maybe also add some chopped nuts and roll them in shredded coconut.

These cookies are very rich. I'm now a weight watchers flunky. It didn't help that I added a handful each of white, milk, and semisweet chocolate chips and used butter pecan cake mix. I just dropped them on a cookie sheet with a small cookie scoop instead of chilling & rolling into balls. They came out perfect. Should go over well on Christmas.

I had to give these 5 stars because they are good and so easy to make.  I did chill the dough for about 30 minutes, but it probably wasn't necessary because after you roll them in powdered sugar they are easy to handle.  My oven baked them perfectly at 11 minutes.  I will be adding this recipe to my other Christmas cookies!

These cookies are absolutely fabulous!  We took these to a club dance, and they were a hit... many asked for the recipe. I made these very small, and they came out exactly like the cake.  If you bake them until they are just starting to brown on top, they should come out soft but holding together.

Nobody mentioned how messy these cookies are to make.  I think next time I will try using a cookie gun or pastry bag (couldn't be messier).  Cookies smelled delicious, but lacked something in flavor. I sprinkled decorative crystals on my second batch as they cooled...a little better.  Worth trying...just be prepared to adjust the recipe a tad.

Yum!  I would agree with another reviewer - it would be best to let the dough sit in the fridge or even overnight.  It can be VERY hard to handle - even when I greased my hands!
The end result was quite delicious!

Excellent cookies.  The cream cheese adds a nice touch.  The cookies are just a tad too sweet so I think I would hold off rolling them in icing sugar next time.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Family loved these cookies.  Super buttery without being too sweet.  Will make these again and after reading some of the other reivews, I will definitely try other types of cake mix.  I too didn't refrigerate the dough before I made the cookies (then again, I forgot to roll them & made them sort of a thick, flat cookie) and they came out great. Once I had the powdered sugar on them, they were very easy to work with.  I look forward to making these again.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!!

I made these the other day on a whim being that I had extra cream cheese.  I was expecting more of what the name implies so I was a bit disappointed.  But my husband and his friend looved them, as did the kids not, knowing what they are called.  They agreed they should be called "cake bites." They taste just like a cake-cookie, simple and good. They were good, but in no way "Gooey or buttery." (and I used the yellow butter cake mix) Oh, in making with multiple sugars, the rainbow sprinkles were every ones favorite with the crunchy texture and also being that they are the cutest!

Very easy to cook.

They weren't MY favorite, but everyone else loved them and I had to make more because they went before Christmas even got here!!!   They do stay nice and soft and are VERY fast and easy to make!!      I will be making some more very soon!

Notes:  These took much longer than the 11-13 minutes and they also made a little over 3 dozen, which is a good thing!!   We also put powdered sugar on them "after" baking them to add a little more flavor!!

These cookies are delicious! I gave it 4 stars simply because it says gooey I thought they would be kinda creamy on the inside. Maybe I did something wrong, but either way I will definitely be making them again and switching up the cake mixes. I can't wait to try strawberry.

Awesome cookies.  I tried them as the recipe said, they are great.
I tried them with Orange Cake Mix and Dark Choc. Chips, regular choc chip cookies will never be the same.
Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Divine! Right out of the oven you think your in heaven! They are still great later too. 
The only thing I'd do, if I had time, is to maybe chill the dough a little so it's not quite so sticky to deal with. It's still a great easy recipe just the way it is. I will have to try it with different cake mixes.

I didn't care for these cookies at all.  Good butter cakes are gooey, these cookies are soft.  The batter was way to sticky to roll into balls and roll in powered sugar, so I just blobbed them onto the cookie sheet.  They taste like boxed yellow cake cookies.  They don't taste bad they just aren't ANYTHING like butter cake.

I made these for quite a few people and everyone liked them but several people LOVED them and couldn't get enough.  I thought they were delicious and enjoyed having a very different cookie - I have never had a cookie that tasted anything like this.  And as a bonus they were very easy to make!

So good.  I tasted the dough and wasn't sure, but my husband liked it, so I didn't alter the recipe at all.  Rolled it in powdered sugar and popped it in the oven, and it comes out tasting decadent without being overly sweet.  It was a great balance for the sweet items on the goodie trays I made for my kids' teachers.

Wow.  I'm in love.  Used chocolate fudge cake mix, added 1 tea vanilla, didn't roll in powdered sugar, just dropped the dough by teaspoon and baked.  Definately must put them in the fridge when the cool and enjoy them after they've sat for a bit.  Just like Gooey Butter Cake here in the 'Lou!!  Gooey and cake like...that's how's it's supposed to be.  YUM!

These were very yummy, but a little too gooey.  I'm not sure if that was something I did, or because of the batter. Husband really enjoyed them.

These cookies are amazing!  Every time I make them, everyone asks for the recipe.   I use french vanilla cake mix instead for a bit more vanilla taste.  Otherwise, these directions are perfect!

Absolutely delicious, do not overcook, take out at suggested time no matter what they look like. Allow to cool fully before moving. The more you overcook them the less they taste like gooey butter and more like a regular cookie.

These are always a big hit!  Be sure to use an UNGREASED cookie sheet, because the dough has a lot of butter in it.  If you use a golden butter cake mix instead of a yellow cake mix, the cookies turn out flatter.  (I learned that one from experience.)  =)  Enjoy...and try not to eat all of the raw dough!

I chill the dough for 2 hours before shaping and baking. I used anise flavoring instead of the vanilla to make an Italian version.

These are pretty good.  Definitely need the powdered sugar or else they are kind of bland, which could be just a personal taste thing.  They are chewy and bake up well.

These are truly decadent and I believe they would be very versatile.  I added chocolate chips to mine and they are heavenly!  I looked at the reviews of others who recommend refrigerating the dough for a few hours or overnight and I don't see any benefit to this other than possibly making the dough easier to handle.  I'm way too impatient for this sort of thing and I didn't have any problems using the dough immediately.  Especially since these are sort of an ugly cookie, by the time you roll them in the powdered sugar they are easy to handle anyway (which by the way, next time I will eliminate this step as the cookie is already very sweet).  I also didn't necessarily agree with those who said to not over bake. I don't think 13 minutes is quite enough actually.  I think more like 15 minutes is perfect.  The outside is kind of crispy and the inside still gooey.  ;o) Yummm!

I was looking for Christmas cookie recipes and I will be adding this one to the cookie plates! I used Red Velvet cake mix and the cookies came out so beautiful! Christmas red with the white snowy powdered sugar. Perfect. And delicious!  The dough was very sticky. I only refrigerated for about an hour. Next time I will try overnight.  I love the versatility of this recipe. :)

I made these last night for a quick gift for two gentlemen at my daughters school that helped me get my car unlocked after I locked both sets of keys in it during a basketball game. My husband loved them!  The yellowcake mix I had on hand had the pudding in the mix, which did not hurt it one bit.  I followed directions and stirred in some toffee bits into the dough!  They are very addicting!  Will be making these again, and will also try different cake flavors!  Lemon will be next!  Thanks for the easy recipe!  I did notice that when I used my pampered chef round stone, they spread a little more than on regular pizza pans, which I liked better on the stone.

I like these cookies. They are a little sweet for me but my husband has a serious love for cake mix cookies. I thought these baked up much nicer than other "plain" cake mix cookie recipes I've tried. I only make decadent cookies like this during the holidays. Next time I think I will use different mixes or try coating the cookies in red and green sugar mixed with the powdered sugar. Everyone loved these cookies. Thanks so much for giving us a more travel worthy version of one of my family's favorite desserts!

This recipe ALWAYS gets rave reviews!  I have found that the "butter recipe" cake mixes work the best.  They are messy to make, so make sure your dough is chilled thoroughly.

Guess I'm in the minority on this one... Honestly, I'd prefer the cake over these cookies.  Added in mini M&M's.   DH & Kids seemed to dig these, but they just weren't my bag.  Glad I tried 'em, but won't make again.

These were so good!  The texture was so smooth, they stayed moist, and they tasted buttery and wonderful.  I was trying to figure out a way to use a cake mix and pre-made frosting a friend gave me without actually turning it into a cake (I am not a cake-lover at all), and this was perfect!  Maybe I'll have to actually buy cake mixes just for this recipe.  By the way, I used a party confetti cake mix, put a maraschino cherry in the middle after baking, and frosted with cherry-flavored frosting.  They didn't really need the frosting, but I was just trying to use it up.  They were good without it.

My boyfriend called right after I taste-tested one of these cookies. I told him that they were devil cookies - positively sinfully yummy. I rolled them in red decorator's sugar instead of powdered sugar, because I wanted them to be festive. I plan on making lemon ones rolled in green sugar at some point too. Since they are cake-like cookies, I tested for doneness the old fashioned way - with a toothpick. It worked for me, since my oven is a bit tempermental.

I wasn't sure about these cookies at first because I had tried the gooey butter cake before and it was a little too exotic for my taste. But I love the cookie version! Especially if you add some m&m's to the mix. These are my new favorite cookies.

I used Duncan Hines' "Butter Recipie Golden" and I have gotten rave reviews!

I mixed the dough and let it rest in the refrigerator until the next day.  Then I rolled them into small (smaller than a walnut) balls then rolled them in 10x sugar to coat them.  About half of the cookies I baked in the ball shape.  The other half I formed into the ball, rolled in the sugar, then flattened them a bit by pressing them down onto the cookie sheet.  I think that they were better WITHOUT flattening them.

Either way, they took almost the full 13 minutes to bake.

I cannot wait to try another flavor of cake mix!

I made these cookies and took them to school to share for my friend's 17th birthday. They were all gone before lunch! I used a chocolate cake mix and added in some chocolate chips and then I dusted the tops with powedered sugar. They looked and tasted great! Plus they stay soft which is how I like my cookies. This recipe is so easy for anyone to make and it seems like a great base to experiment with. have fun!

I have made these for years. Everyone loves them! I usually chill the dough while the oven heats, makes it a little easier to work with. Try using a chocolate cake mix and add a cup of chocolate chips to the dough to make a really sinful double chocolate cookie.

I decided to make these after a really bad day at work and they were just what I needed! They were BEYOND AMAZING! I made them exactly as the recipe says and they were perfect! I might just have to make these on a regular occasion...even though they'll be a killer on my waist line!

this is the only cookie i've ever made that i don't want warm from the oven.  there is some strange phenomenon that causes these cookies to taste MUCH MUCH better the day AFTER you bake them.  i made them a second time to see if it was just in my head, and my husband agrees with me.  the texture is a little denser and moister... but maybe that's only because i live in indiana and it's so incredibly humid all summer long... anyway, if you make these and aren't too crazy about them, don't give up right away.  i also added a few chocolate chips this time, because, hey, what isn't better with chocolate? thanks, kim!

This recipes is great! It is simple and very versatile.  I tried it with devil's food cake over the holidays and they were a huge hit - especially with the kids. Tonight I am going to try addin mini dark chocolate chips and dried tart cherries to the devil's food mix.  I can't wait to try them!

This recipe is great. Everywhere I take them, they get rave reviews.  I don't know what people mean when they say to put them in the fridge for a while before rolling them in the sugar.  I never had too.  Thanks for the recipe.  They are wonderful!

I am constantly trying new recipes and using my coworkers for critics.  Brought these to work and everyone LOVED them!  They were gone within 30 minutes of putting them out!  I sprinkled additional powdered sugar on top after the cookies had cooled...Yum. I can't wait to try them with a lemon cake mix.  Thank so much!

I’m from St. Louis and was raised on gooey butter cake as a special treat some weekends.  These cookies are very close to the real thing, except you can eat them with your hands and not get too messy!
I made a slight variation by blending about 2 Tbs of confectioners sugar into the batter.  True gooey butter cake style.  Then topped with a pecan piece and sprinkled with confectioners sugar.  
My husband took them to work and the cookies were called “illegally good”.

Family loves loves loves gooey butter cake, but these do not taste much like the cake at all. We will not make these again.  The cookie is ok- but as another stated, you can certainly tasted the cake mix.  I made exactly as recipe stated and they are pretty and quick, but not memorable.

We're gluten free due to my husband's Celiac disease so I'm always looking for recipes that can be easily adapted.  This one fit the bill to a T!  I used gluten free yellow cake mix and added white chocolate chips.  I didn't have confectioner's sugar, so just skipped that part.  They were great!  Easy, everyone liked it, can be adjusted to what you have on hand - definitely a keeper!

Delicious cookies. I found the recipe first on Betty Crocker and then saw it here also. I made them with funfetti cake make so it gave the cookies a little color. I look forward to trying other flavor cakes. Highly recommended! Enjoy!

I call them plain Jane's - they look meh & are hiding the fact they really are Delicious, very rich, soft easy to make cookies in disguise. Used butter yellow cake mix from Betty Crocker which seemed less sticky than other brands.  I sprinkle with colored sugar after baking.  An easy Christmas cookie if you are looking to bring something for an exchange.

If you have ever had St. Louis Oooey Gooey Butter cake this is as close as you can get in a cookie.  They are amazing, but don't try to mail them, they don't hold up well.  If you want them for picnicking, make sure they go into the cooler, they don't like heat.  I have tried all different flavors of cake mix and they are all great, our favorite is butter recipe yellow and butter recipe chocolate.  Enjoy!

I think this recipe is good, but not to die for.  I did dress up 1/2 the batch for Christmas by rolling them in a combination of finely chopped walnuts and plain sugar.  This was a nice touch.

These were nice and soft. The powdered sugar made a nice gloss "crust" to the cookie. I also used a butter cake box mix for mine to add the extra butter flavor. I decided to stir in toffee pieces too to make a butter toffee cookie, but I can see how you could change the cake mix or stir ins easily. They were simple, fast, and yummy. My kind of cookie!

Made these with my 2 youngest munchkins and added color to the mix they loved rolling the dough balls in the powdered sugar and once they were all baked everyone loved eating them. These cookies did not last they were gone with a quickness. Can't wait to try some of the suggestions others have written. But just as is these are super yummy.

Amazing cookies!!! I would have thought that with the cream cheese and butter that the cookies would have been dense, but they are soo light and just melt in your mouth! They are sooo good, I will definitely be making these again. I can't wait to try more variations... I saw one with a chocolate cake mix with a rolo in the center.... mmmmmm, so many possibilities!!

This is my go to cookie recipe!  My favorite is Duncan Hines Golden Butter Cake mix with lemon extract!  It is best to slightly under bake the cookies to maintain the fluffy deliciousness.  I love adding sprinkles to the batter to amp up the festiveness for the various seasons.

Super easy! I didn't chill dough, but with these tips, it was easy: Put your powdered sugar in a shallow dish. Using a small melon ball scoop or spoon, scoop up enough for a 1 in ball. Using your thumb, push the dough into the powdered sugar. That one thumb will be messy, but you can wipe/lick it when you're through! ;) After you've dropped the balls (you may have to do this in batches), gently roll them in the powdered sugar. Voila! You can now easily roll them into balls and place on cookie sheet. Bake them until they test golden on the bottom when carefully lifting to check with a spatula. They're just the right size to put in mini muffin liners to match any color/party/holiday theme!

These are very good, do not over bake. Our favorite is the chocolate cake mix version. To the chocolate I added a half bag of semi sweet chips and rolled the dough in powder sugar mixed with a quality brand cocoa powder pre-bake. I did make a version with yellow cake mix, butterscotch chips and slivered almonds. My grown kids and youngest kids liked them, just a little too sweet for me. Those chocolate ones though! woo hew! Tasted like brownies,darn fine tasting brownies at that!

i found these cookies to be just ok! disaapointing :( i can't really describe what was wrong with them, but they were just pretty plain and lackluster for me.  perhaps making them with chocolate cake mix would amp up the flavor??

I usually add a teaspoon of almond extract and another teaspoon of butter extract to brighten the flavor a little.  Just keep in mind that if you have a low quality mixer you can burn out the motor while mixing these (I did it twice before getting a high quality stand mixer) and end up mixing by hand.  If you do have to mix by hand, just keep in mind these cookies are worth it.

This is a really easy cookie! Tasted even better the second day. I made the cherry chip cookies. First batch I over cooked just a tad. My oven is hot so I was much closer to the 10 min. mark. Second batch I added chocolate chips.  This was great and I think I'm going to do a pumpkin/spice one next!

these were pretty tastey! i had to use gluten free yellow cake mix because im gluten intolorant but they were still pretty darn good.  i might have to add a bit of oil next time cuz they were a tiny bit dry which is probably due to the cake mix i bought, but other than that they were very addicting

when baking gooey butter cookies you need to make sure that the cookies stay gooey after they come out of the oven. Instead of baking for 10 - 13min. back for 5 min. so they don't turn hard.

We found Gooey Butter Cake on a family vacation to St. Louis several years ago and loved it.  When I came across this recipe, I was excited and not all at once.  I am what one might call a snob, I won't buy cake mixes.  As a general rule it doesn't really save any time and scratch tastes 100 times better.  So seeing that this recipe calls for a cake mix I was concerned at the least, but really couldn't figure out how to make it scratch without the mix, so I went to the grocery and bought a mix...my husband laughing the entire time.  He said my face had a look of someone smelling a hog farm!  Needless to say, I tried this recipe, and was pleasantly surprised that it really did taste like the real Gooey Butter Cake from St. Louis! Is one of my husband's favorites and he asks for them several times a month!  Thank you Soap for this fabulous and unique recipe!

I made 3 versions using chocolate, spice, & lemon cake mixes.  I used a whole tsp of vanilla extract in the chocolate and spice batches and a tsp of lemon extract in the lemon batch.  Also, I added chopped pecans to the spiced batch.  All were delicious but the lemon was definitely a hit!  Scooped out 2tbs size and baked for 15 mins.  Delicious and EASY!

My friend shared this recipe with me a couple years ago, and these cookies are so yummy!  I am afraid to make them, because the first time I did, I ended up eating the whole batch!  They aren't quite gooey like the gooey butter cake, but they are delicious!  Now I share, but very sparingly. haha.  Others who I've shared with ask for the recipe too.

These are a Paula Deen staple in my house and my go-to cookies whenever I need something in a pinch - Plus, it's so easy to remember that we usually will make a couple batches when we're on vacation (Five 1's = 1 egg, 1 block cream cheese, 1 stick butter, 1 box cake mix, 1 tsp vanilla).  I've actually never used yellow cake mix, though - I've always used chocolate - but speaking from trying different chocolate cake mixes, DEFINITELY go with a chocolate fudge cake mix over milk chocolate. Promise. You won't regret it! Plus, the dough is so good that it often gets nibbled on while we're rolling them! Deeelish!

These were awesome!  It was like bite size gooey butter cake!  Very dangerous for the waistline!!! :)  I didn't have any problems with the dough being sticky like others mentioned.  The key is to make sure both butter and cream cheese are at room temperature, so they can be thoroughly mixed, then add ingredients as recipe states.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect!!!!!  Thanks for an amazing recipe!!!!

So yumm! I used the yellow butter cake mix. They turned out so light and fluffy and were gone really quickly. My husband proclaimed that they were his new favorite and is already asking me to make more.

Very yummy and easy to make.  I did devils food mix, and did not roll in powdered sugar, just sprinkled it on right out of the oven.  The middle school kids gobbled them up.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks for a delicious variation on the ever classic cake mix cookies!

Great cake mix cookie recipe!  My husband LOVES soft cookies and the texture of these is fantastic, they are really light, fluffy, moist and delicious.  I used a lemon cake mix, lemon extract instead of vanilla, added about a tablespoon of poppyseeds, and zest of two lemons.  Lovely lemon flavor but not overpowering.  They also do not spread everywhere like some cake mix recipes. *I did not refrigerate the dough or roll it into balls.  I poured about a cup of powdered sugar into a mound in the middle of a shallow bowl, then used a teaspoon to scoop.  The dough is very sticky and will stick to the spoon.  I dipped the dough, while still on the spoon, into the sugar, then slid them off the spoon onto cookie sheets lined with parchment paper.  Worked like a charm and much faster.   I also had to cook mine quite a lot longer, as another reviewer said, 14 mins was perfect for mine.  While you don't want to overcook, undercooking is just as bad.  Of the three batches I made from this recipe, one was undercooked, I removed it at 11 mins, and while tasty, they have a funky aftertaste.  With regular cookie dough you can get away with a lot more under doneness, the flavor and texture with cake mix is kind of gross.  The second batch was 14 minutes and was perfect.  The last batch was just a few stragglers, and I promptly forgot about them.  They cooked for about 16 mins.  They were very dark golden brown, but actually quite good.  The texture was more like a scone.

3 words: OH MY GOOOOOOOSH!!!!!!!!  These cookies are unbelievable, rich, decadent, melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  They are so moist, even days later, when packed in wax paper.  I want to play around with them and try a drop of fruit preserves or pie filling in the middle.  I can imagine it would taste almost like a fruit cheesecake-cookie.  A definite keeper!!!  No one will ever believe how quick and simple this recipe is.

These are soooo yummy!  I don't like cake, but I loved these.  And they are surprisingly easy, my 2 (almost 3) year old helped.  I would say they are up there with donuts!!!  I always use 1 tsp of extract.
New favorite combo and most requested is white cake mix with 1 tsp almond in place of vanilla.

These are wonderful!  I made mine with French Vanilla cake mix, Red Velvet cake mix (added 1 cup chopped pecans) and Chocolate cake mix (changed vanilla to almond flavoring).  Delicious!!!

I use the Butter Recipe Yellow Cake mix. I tried just a yellow cake mix and the cookies did not come out as moist or fluffy. These do not last long in my house; they are light, fluffy and not so sweet that you can only eat just one. I store in a zip lock bag with a little bit of powered sugar to cover.

My bf and I both said this is our new favorite cookie. So soft and gooey! Half I did plain and half I put chocolate chips in. Delicious either way. I baked mine for the full 13 minutes. UPDATE: This year I used confetti cake mix. They are so pretty. Look great on my Christmas cookie tray.

I made these and they did not even compare to the Chocolate Gooey Butter Cookies... same exact recipe except use chocolate cake mix. Everyone at the party loved the, but I know had they tried the chocolate version it would have blown the normal ones out of the water!

Great cookie! My only change was to not add the powdered sugar..they're already sweet as it is. Other reviewers mentioned that the cookie is more like a cake texture and they're right. The only time it's gooey is straight out of the oven. Letting the cookie cool for five minutes after taking it out of the oven really enhances the flavors. The baking time is just perfect.

This were good but not what I was expecting.  I was hoping it would be more gooey but instead they were really cakey.  I tried 13, 12 and 11 minutes all ending with the same results: cakey.

This is such an EASY recipe and by simply switching out the cake flavors, you can create a huge variety of different cookie creations - all of them soft, chewy and incredibly delicious!  

A few tips:  
Make sure the cream cheese and butter have completely softened to room temperature before mixing.  Refrigerate the dough for AT LEAST one hour for better handling when rolling into balls.  I typically roll mine to about 1 1/2 - 2 inches in diameter, and this yields about 18 large cookies.

These cookies tend to bake up like cupcakes, so I bake them for 6 min. and then go in and gently flatten them with a spatula and cook for another 5 min.  DO NOT OVERBAKE!  I found that 11 min. was truly perfect, even for the slightly larger cookies I chose to make.  I also like to add just a bit more powdered sugar to the tops of the cookies right after I take them out of the oven.  

I have used both yellow and chocolate cake mixes, and both flavors were incredibly delicious - My co-workers just couldn't get enough of them!  I plan to try this with spice cake mix next and roll them in cinnamon sugar to make a delicious snickerdoodle-type creation.   

I will upload some pictures soon!  Enjoy!

These turned out wonderfully! I made the dough last night, then let it sit in the fridge overnight to firm up. It's been warm here for the last week and I know that would have caused the dough to spread. This really helped keep the cookies together. I didn't change anything about this recipe. My husband flipped for these cookies. I make Paula's Pumpkin Gooey Butter Cake for Thanksgiving every year and he always eats half the pan, at least. This is why the recipe appealed to me in the first place. So, yeah. These were perfect. I would SO make these again.

I thought these were pretty good but I give it 5 stars for the number of people that were cursing me because these were so good and they were trying to diet!  Mine did not flatten so there were kind of cakey, but good.  I added 1/4 cup of sweetened cocoa powder to the powdered sugar.  The cookies look like snikerdoodles but do not taste like it.  Very good, easy cookie.  Batter is kinda gooey but if you refrigerate it makes it much easier to handle.

These are definitely better after cooling down.  They're supersoft.  I added mini chocolate chips and that added just the right extra thing.

Gooey Butter Cake has been one of my favorite recipes for years.  These cookies are just as good...if not better...since they don't have the gooey topping that can get too rich after awhile.  Guess that gives me an excuse to eat more cookies!

What a fabulous and easy recipe! The cookies DID taste like Gooey Butter Cakes. I'm going to make these for Christmas gifts and sprinkle them with more powdered sugar and call them "Snowdrops" or something like that.

****HINT:  To be easy on your mixer, let the butter and cream cheese sit out until room temperature, then you will have no problems mixing.  I'm a cookie nut but these weren't the best I've had.  They were good, but not great.  I usually get rave reviews when I bring cookies to picnics but I didn't really get any comments on these.  They are nice and moist but bland.  **Update: they are awesome using chocolate cake and 1 tsp vanilla.

Everyone raves when I make these cookies and they're even easier than the recipe suggests. Rather than refrigerating the dough, using a cookie scoop or rolling the dough into balls, and shaking the dough in a bag of powder sugar, try this method:

After mixing the dough, use a teaspoon to drop half-spoonfuls onto the cookie sheet. Then after the cookies cool, use a sifter to sprinkle powder sugar on them. Delicious!

Very moist cookies.  It tastes like you're eating a "mini" piece of very moist cake.  I made them exactly like the recipe said and then I added chocolate chips and chopped macadamia nuts to another batch.  I think it would be better to add the choco chips and nuts to a chocolate cake mix instead of the yellow cake mix.  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies tasted good, but too much work to make. The batter is sticky and really difficult to stir. You should use a shorter cooking time for chocolate cake mix. 

I won't be making these again. The prep time just takes too long.

So delicious!!!  I used lemon cake mix and lemon extract and what a tasty yummy cookie. Made as a part of my holiday baking this year and will continue to make these and try different cake mixes as well. Thanks for a totally different cookie!!

These cookies are awesome.  Make them smaller and they will be an even tastier treat.  Add a box of vanilla pudding to the recipe to make them even more moist.  The recipe is also fab with devil's food cake mix = chocolate gooey butter cookies.

Unless you want a different flavor, try a Butter Recipe cake mix.(they're made to be used with butter and not oil like most mixes) I think there's only 2 flavors, fudge and yellow. Both make great cookies!

PERFECT RECIPE!  Follow recipe as is & bake for exactly 10 minutes.  Let them rest for 5 minutes after pulling out of oven.  They are beautiful little cookies that are just so rich and buttery!

I followed the recipe (using a chocolate cake mix). These are absolutely wonderful!  Moist, chewy, and not too gooey.    I also baked them for an additional 4 mins.  I had no problem rolling these, even though they are a little sticky, and the powdered sugar helps with that.  They taste a lot like the namesake cake and even my picky 5 year old loved these!

Cookies were very flat.  Other recipes I found were for 1 stick of butter not 1/2 cup and you must refrigerate for two hours before you roll them into bars.  The refrigeration is important.

These cookies were wonderful!! The trick to rolling them out is to not let your butter and cream cheese get to soft before using them.  If it is too stick just refridgerate it for a while until they harden up.

These were excellent a day later not as good out of the oven. We had only a 15oz cake mix so the dough was really wet. I put it in the fridge for awhile and it made it easier to work with.

I could only find 15.25 oz cake mix boxes at my local grocery store, which I knew meant I would have to add something to it or it would be too runny. I found adding about 6 T of Bisquick worked ok but I should have added more vanilla to offset the change to the flavor. I used this same recipe but with chocolate cake mix and I added 1 T of cocoa powder with the 6 T of Bisquick and those turned out great.

The mixture was extremely gooey when done. I refrigerated it for over an hour and it was still sticky. I used the powdered sugar to help it stick together better. I also used gloves because it was so sticky. Next time I make them I will try mixing powdered sugar in with the mixer to take some of the stickiness away.

H ave made these several times, and they turn out awesome. They do turn out better if you make sure your ingredients are at room temperature before you start mixing.  Then I turn the oven down half way through baking and let them bake a little longer for softer melt in your mouth cookies. My kids (adults) love them!!!

Made for school cookie exchange. Doubled. Cake mixes were 15.25 Oz and it turned out fine. Added green food coloring for the perfect grinch cookies.  I wanted a recipe that used butter, cream cheese and the cake mix.  Not too sweet.  Success!

Followed directions to the T. No matter how long I chilled this mess, it would not roll into a ball. Needed it today for Halloween party. What a waste of time, money and ingredients, plus no cookies for party. UHG!

They are very good cookies. I used butter pecan cake mix instead of yellow but everything else was the same. They are not overly sweet, just a nice amount of sweetness. I will be making them again with different flavors.

Followed the directions exactly, but my cookies were not gooey nor did they taste buttery. Cake mix no longer comes in 18.25 ounce boxes, so I had to buy two boxes and use only a portion of the second box to get the 18.25 ounces. I am glad I tried the recipe, but I will not be making it again.

Great recipe!  I was looking for recipes to use my box of fresh from the farm peaches.  I added fresh peaches, very small dice and used a scoop instead of rolling them into balls.    I didn't roll in powdered sugar.  I let them cool completely and made a glaze with fresh peach juice and powdered sugar.  Brushed the cooled cookies with the peach glaze.  Huge hit with my family and at work.  :)

This was one if the easiest cookie recipes I've ever made, pretty much fool proof. I baked them for 12 min at 350 and the were buttery puffy and perfection. Soooooo good. I will definitely make these again..

Although I slipped up on a step (mixing in the confectioners' sugar), my family really enjoyed the cookies. They may not have looked like the other pictures shown but we enjoyed sitting down and eating the cookies with milk.

Didn't care for it.  Way too soft and stuck to the pan.  Won't even try it again.  I guess I just like a firmer cookie.

Quick, easy, cheese-cakey cookies.  Would be easy to make them snazzier with lemon or orange zest... or chopped pistachios... or lavender buds... Tons of possibilities!

My 11 y.o.  daughter has made these twice.  My family loves them.  We made them once with yellow cake mix and the second time with chocolate cake mix.  Both were yummy!
We set the butter and cream cheese out for a while to soften to make mixing easier.  Also,  my daughter sprayed her hands with Pam to prevent the dough from sticking to her hands.  We made sure to get plenty of powdered sugar on the cookie balls.  They look very pretty with the cracks and some of the powdered sugar still visible on them.

I made the recipe exactly as written, except I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, because that's what I had on hand. I used Butter Recipe Golden cake mix. They came out almost exactly like biscuits. They weren't sweet and they weren't gooey. They were cakey and bland. Maybe using full fat cream cheese would have fixed everything,  but that doesn't seem likely. Very disappointing.

I made these today while baking for Christmas. I used a Butter Pecan cake  mix. Wow! They are amazing.! My husbands response after eating  one was, "Oh my God those are good, they taste like a cinnamon roll or something. You don't need to make any other kind of cookies because those are awesome!"

super moist. I mis-read the instructions and added confectioner sugar directly into the dough - and didn't turn out too sweet at all.  used lemon cake mix- my hubs fav.
I used a scooper to get the dough on sheet- didn't even bother to roll.  turn heat down to 325 degrees.

I have made and will continue to make this recipe exactly as it is. It's great to just have with coffee. A little fresh fruit is a wonderful addition.  The ladies at The Great Banquet request this delicious cookie twice a year. I love that I can make my contribution in serving these wonderful women.

Love these cookies. Have made several times.
I make with chocolate cake mix as well as strawberry.
Dough can be sticky I suggest refrigerating for 1/2 hour before forming the cookies.

Really easy and pretty darned good. Has a cake type flavor due to cake mix I'm sure (duh). I found the batter very gooey which I'm thinking is where name came  from. Husband and I really liked them.

I used to make a similar cookie from scratch and I can't find my recipe! I hate baking a recipe that calls for packaged ingredients :(... if anyone has a good from-scratch version of this please share! I am still looking.

11.15.16 ~ A good cookie that is easy to make.  I made these as a 'test cookie' for our 2016 cookie exchange.  We thought they were good, my testers really liked them.  With a cake mix as the base and a few other ingredients, this recipe can be made pretty quickly.

I made these as directed, and they came out yummy! One reviewer suggested a lower temperature of 325 for 17 minutes. I took the first pan out at around 15.5 minutes. They seems to be just fine. I'll let the 2nd pan go the full time and see if there is any difference. I had no real issues working with the dough. Yes, it was sticky. I dropped the teaspoonfuls into the powdered sugar, picked them up, rolled them in my hands, then powdered sugar. Put a thumbprint in the middle of them so they would be flatter. I will make these again with my children.
UPDATE: The minute and a half difference made no difference except a tiny bit of color on the bottom. Otherwise, no difference!

These are very good cookies. My only suggestion is to chill the dough before baking. I chilled it over night. Made it much easier to work with.

Not that great. Rolled them in powdered sugar after and made them so much better. Guess i was expecting more of a gooey cookie. These were cake like. I did use a strawberry cake...maybe that was the issue...

12 minutes,  these were perfect! Putting them in the fridge helped. I used the smallest cookie scoop and didn't bother to roll them between my hands, I just rolled them around in the sugar. Great for a quick batch of cookies for school purposes.

I've made these cookies for years having had my roots in St. Louis where the Gooey Butter Cakes originated. These cookies are best when the "Butter Recipe" Yellow Cake Mix is used. The flavors are much more heightened with this cake mix!

Always a family favorite! I've made these so many times and they never get old. The only complaint I have is the mix is so sticky when you roll out the balls.

These were pretty good.  They were very cakey, which is expected from them being mostly cake mix.  I may of overcooked them a bit more than they should of been also.  I will try again another time and cook them less to see if I get the more gooey texture that I was looking for in them.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, no problems. I used a butter yellow cake and scooped the dough into the powder sugar.  It was great, and I glazed with a lemon glaze.  Amazing!!

I am a beginner baker of 2 weeks...these were delicious and easy. The only trouble I had was forming the balls. The dough was too gooey and just kept sticking to my hands. I was thinking maybe I was not supposed to mix the ingrdients together with the mixer???

I've made these several times and can't get enough! I chill the dough for an hour before I roll them, makes them easier to handle.

** Update ** Substituted with triple chocolate fudge cake mix.  Absolutely heavenly.

I'm not a huge fan of cake mix cookies, but the name intrigued me so I figured I would try them although I was skeptical. They tasted exactly like I thought they would, which to me was just ok. Instead of gooey butter taste, I had gooey yellow cake and cream cheese taste. However, my family did enjoy them.

I'm not sure if it was the brand of cake mix I used, but I could definitely taste the cake mix in the cookie.  It had that artificial cake mix taste instead of a creamy buttery homemade taste.

Everyone loved them, they went quick. Super easy to make. Put the dough in the fridge for 2 hours before dropping on pan. Cooked 13 minutes. Delicious!

These are so wonderful!  My daughter loves to make them for holidays and family events.  I recommend chilling the dough for a couple of hours prior to rolling into balls and coating with powdered sugar.  I also use Duncan Hines butter recipe cake mix.  Easy and there are never any left!

Oh my word.  I was up until 10 making and eating these cookies.  I was looking for something new to bake, and I have found it.  They are very addicting.  They were all gone before we went to bed.  And there is only 2 of us in the house.  If I make it again, I will use gloves cause you have to roll them into a ball.  It gets messy.

I personally thought these cookies were just ok. I took them and two other kinds of cookies to work thinking the other two would be the favorite (white chocolate orange, yum!). These cookies got rave reviews; everyone was begging for the recipe and asking me to make more.

I don't even have to eat gluten-free, but try to whenever possible. I took reviewer's suggestion and used gluten-free yellow cake mix. Terrific!  Satisfies the cooky craving, yummy and gluten-free!  Plan to add MINI choc chips next time.

these came through work and I wasn't able to try them (had to resist the tempations) I decided to come home and make them a week later. I used the Pillsbury golden butter mix and followed the rest of the ingredients of this recipe as is. they are amazing! totally yummy and even better hours and days later.

Just ok. Looks plain and they are plain. I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband loves butter flavored anything. Dough was sticky. I read the reviews and did as they suggested I put the dough in the fridge overnight. Was so excited to make them next day. But dough still super sticky. Only made two cookies sheets worth and threw the rest out. My husband did eat a few but he wasn't raving about them. Another thing this recipe makes a lot.... like five of my cookie sheets.I put 12 cookies on each sheet. Disappointed.

I didn't care for using the cake mix. They didn't turn out as expected, more cake-like than cookie. Gooey butter cookies isn't the proper name for these. I believe that children would love these with a little tweaking of the recipe but as an adult who loves desserts particularly cookies and cake these weren't worth the hype. Will not make again!

This was a super easy cookie, and so yummy. My husband is already making plans for all the different verisons he wants me to make.  For my first one I used the the Yellow Butter cake mix & chilled the dough for 2 hours before baking. They were not too sweet either which I was a bit worried about. I am looking forward to trying different flavors.

I've made this with both a yellow cake mix and a strawberry cake mix... both were great and the cookies absolutely melt in your mouth! I went ahead and softened both the butter and cream cheese to make it easier to stir...

These were delicious, especially after they sat for a couple hours. I made the first tray plain, and for the second, added a few milk chocolate chips, pecans and coconut.

This is one of our favorite recipes for quick and easy cookies.  My husband loves gooey butter cake, so these cookies are a perfect substitute when I want to make a treat in a rush.  I've used white and yellow cake mixes so far, and plan to try it with chocolate soon....yum!

I love these cookies! Made it on a whim because I was craving something different and sweet, and oh boy did I get it! I've made it two times and have used the yellow butter batter instead of just yellow. It makes the dough very unstable, but still a -O.M.G- cookie. I will say however that this will have to be my special holiday cookie. It has to be at least five pounds gained per bite. BUT SOOO GOOD!!

I soooo love this recipe! I used the confetti cake mix instead since that is what I had in my pantry and add some sprinkles to it. I don`t know if the cooking temp and time was correct on here or maybe it was just my oven, but I had to up the cooking temp. to 375 and bake it to about 18 minutes since we do like our edges to be a little golden. Over all this is the best recipe for cookies that I`ve ever come across so far.

My optometrist first clued me in on a gooey cookie.  I found this recipe and decided to try it.  The process is a bit messy and sticky (I did not refridgerate my dough), and to offset the sweetness my doctor warned me of, added 1 cup of chopped cranberries.  The final product was definitely gooey and the tartness of the cranberries was perfect.  I like my cookies a bit heavier but my husband LOVED these.  I think I would like to try a differnt cake mix as some reviewers have noted.  I used yellow butter, the french vanilla sounds interesting.

I made this recipe using a chocolate butter flavored cake mix,using 1/2 tsp. vanilla, at the request of my teen-and wow, was it good! In fact,the dough tasted so good that it was difficult to save enough to bake! However, this makes a very soft,sticky dough, and I found refrigerating before rolling it into balls was a MUST. I chilled it while the oven preheated, and that wasn't long enough. I think 1/2hour would be the minimum. The chocolate dough makes it difficult to gauge the doneness, so check for edges that are firm to the touch, and trust carryover heat to do the rest. To replicate that gooey butter cake look (and separate these from similar looking chocolate crinkles or crackles) give them a generous dusting of powdered sugar before plating. These are so easy to make in any flavor that I think I'll include both the original and chocolate versions on my cookie trays for gift giving.

Awesome recipe! Have made a dozen times with various flavors and all were good. (Lemon and Butter Pecan are favs) TIP: Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls in to powdered sugar, roll to coat and THEN lightly shape into balls, shaking off the excess.  I usually get around 3 doz.

I didn't like the cream cheese taste to these. They are very very rich, we called them cake cookies. They took a few tries before we decided if we liked them or not. They are much much better with chocolate chips added in.

Perfectly lovely and simple version of a St. Louis classic.  I made a double batch which actually ended up being a triple batch thanks to my little helper's size ideas!

I really want to love these cookies, I really do.  My husband and my daugher really like them.  I find the box-cake taste overwhelming and the texture odd.  I put them in the refrigerator hoping they firm up but they haven't.  I think they're a bit too cream-cheesy.. shoulda been named Gooey Cream Cheese Cookies  .

I'm not sure why I didn't think about the fact that these would end up tasting like cake mix, but I didn't. Nonetheless, they were very good. So good that I couldn't stop eating them. I used a dark chocolate cake mix and it filled the chocolate craving I was attacked with. Next time I think I will add some chocolate chips and walnuts just to add some defferent texture.

Followed the directions and they came out perfectly. I used a yellow butter cake mix rather than just plain yellow cake. They turn out better if you follow the directions, so don't bother chilling the dough. They baked evenly and are very light. They're plain looking, but oh so good!!

I just made these and got mixed reviews.  My daughter and I both thought they were good but nothing special my husband & son loved them.  They were sort of like a glorified sugar cookie... , very moist, a bit lemony and tasted more like a cake than a cookie.  After baking I sprinkled again with powdered sugar. They were very easy to make and I had all the required ingredients on hand.  This would be a great recipe for those last minute situations when your child signs you up to bake for school but forgets to tell you until the night before they are need.... I'm sure all you mom's out there can relate to this!

My husband absolutely loves these. I've done both chocolate and yellow butter cake. My hubby preferred the chocolate as he's a chocoholic. I thought the cookies made using the yellow butter cake mix tasted less cakey and liked them the best.

In a lame attempt to lower the fat I used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese.  I baked them 5 minutes longer than the max (18min total). Otherwise I followed the recipe to a "T".  May I say, these are now my favorite cookies...to die for.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

These cookies are to die for. I hate getting my hands dirty so what I do is I roll the dough in plastic wrap into about a 1 1/2 inch diameter log and put into the freezer for an hour or so.  Then I use a adjustable cheese slicer to cut them on the largest thickness.   Makes the perfect cookie.  Chocolate cake mix and Butter Pecan are delicious also...I also make a version of this recipe for Brownies..  Absolutely fabulous.  I will submit the brownie recipe.

Just made these, and LOVE them. Followed the recipe 100% (except i accidentally put in extra vanilla), used Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe yellow cake mix.  First batch i did exactly as it was written (rolled in powdered sugar), then for the remaining dough i dipped the bottom in powdered sugar and rolled the rest in colored sugar, cocoa powder, or sprinkles (to make them a bit prettier).. For a few of them, i stuck a chocolate chip in the center (i made my cookies on the smaller side, so the single chocolate chip was JUST the right amount of chocolate).  these came out SO good and were SO easy to make!   One hint: refrigerating the dough definitely makes it easier to handle! It's very sticky dough.

These are best with a Butter Recipe Yellow cake mix.  I tried making them with a German Chocolate mix and almond extract, too.  They were good, but more cakelike than the ones with the butter recipe yellow cake mix.  These are very, very sweet!  I recommend chilling the dough before rolling it into balls.  If you like gooey butter cake/Neiman Marcus cake, you will enjoy these!

These are really great. I didn't change a thing! Only thing mine made 48 cookies not 24.  This was my first time making gooey butter cookies. I'm vey ahppy with this recipe! Other reviewers had trouble with moistness of the cake mix. I used a "moist ix with pudding in it" Super moist and tastey. Thanks!

I made these last year and put a few of them in the cookie tins I gave away.  They are what everyone is requesting this year so I guess I'll need to triple the recipe!  Great Christmas treats!

Just made these cookies... I thought they were good but not great.  Definitely quick and easy but I thought the texture was off a little bit.  Just a little to cakey for me.  Probably won't make again; will try a different recipe.

Did NOT taste anything like Gooey Butter Cake to me!  The recipe was pretty dry in mixing, like REALLY couldn't get it all mixed together.  They tasted fine but weren't amazing.

These were super yummmy. I used lemon cake mix and lemon extract. I also made the dough the night before and then baked them. Although I did this because I was short on time :)

These cookies were very good, and gooey. When I lived back in Jersey we had friends who made the best gooey butter cakes. These cookies take me right back. I put in a little more vanilla extract just because I like the flavor, but other then that this recipe was delicious.

These cookies are delicious- I've been using this recipe for a while- and have only tried making it using Devil's food cake mix.  This recipe yields aprox. 4 dozen deecent sized cookies.  I make a crisco-butter filling and make these cookies into little sandwiches.  The end-result is absolutely delectable.  Highly recommended!

Incredibly easy to make. The kids couldn't stop eating them, and neither could I! Chocolate chips are a great addition, or make them plain, either way you can't go wrong with these cookies.

They fall apart, gooey mess - not a cookie at all - either you cook them till they are crispy burnt or they are a gooey gloop floop....my kids didn't even eat to the bottom of the cookie jar and they will eat anything sweet.  I did it because of the high ratings...I won't be trying this again - I guess call me a 30 something old fashioned Betty Crocker!

This recipe is SO GOOD and SO easy.  I made a few changes: (1) I used a cookie scoop instead of rolling the cookies in balls - they still turned our good; (2) I sprinkled the tops lightly with regular sugar as I did not have powdered sugar on hand (still turned out good; and (3) stirred in some extras on my last batch - white chocolate chips, cinnamon chips, and sliced almonds - YUM!  I would like to try this with other cake flavors or maybe brownie mix.  Thanks for a great recipe!

OK. I guess they taste like butter cake, but just didn't like them that much. Gooey butter cake is better.

I was pleasantly surprised with the oh so easy cookies! They are easy to make and perfect if you are in a bind because they take very few ingredients.The only draw back for me was that they are a little dry, and are actually more moist the longer they sit. But i will make these again regardless of that...they are still good and easy cookies. :)

I like this recipe.  I'm a big fan of cake like cookies, so this appealed to me.  My husband liked them, as well.  They were a snap to make!  I didn't wait for the dough to get stiff in the fridge, though.  I just dropped spoonfuls of it into the bowl of confectioner sugar and once it was coated fairly well I was able to roll it into a ball with minimal mess.  Also, I used Lemon Cake mix and Lemon extract, which was very yummy!

These cookies taste much better after sitting for a couple of hours - or even a day. If you eat them when they're hot out of the oven, they're just way too sugary and doughy tasting.  But give them a bit, and they're delicious.

These were just okay. Mainly, they seemed like small, crispy cakes more than cookies. You could definitely tell these came from a box. When you are desperate for a cookie, you should make these, but not any other time.

This is absolutely delicious! They are requested at every carry-in.  I use a butter recipe cake mix (usually Dunken Hines).  But I will certainly try the suggestion to use a chocolate cake mix. 
Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

Really delicious.I also made these with butter pecan cake mix and lemon cake mix.. the regular yellow cake mix was by far my favorite. It actually tastes like a gooey butter cake.

After these cooled, I must say, they were so wonderful! Did not have much flavor, at first, but after I had them on the wire racks for about 45 minutes, they filled out so nicely and contained a perfect butter flavor. I also followed the recipe exactly. Loved the ease of preparation, but I think that if I added chocolate chips, it may make these little guys that much better!

I made these tonight to take to our big belated Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow.. I made them with yellow cake mix and also with devil food cake mix... They are both very good... Yellow cake is one of my favorite treats, so I think I like those better, but I'm sure they will be a hit! (i just am trying to not eat them all so that i will have some to take!!!) I also did not roll in powdered sugar, but I did sift a very small amount on top of the cookies once they cooled... 
Oh, and as many reviewers mentioned, these are very messy to make, but chilling the dough before rolling into balls REALLY helps...

Very good!  I made one recipe chocolate and another one pineapple.  The chocolate got the best remarks, but the pineapple was great too!

Good and fairly easy to make. My one complaint is how  messy they are. Getting the dough off my hands and on to the sheet was quite a task.  I didnt bother to roll the dough in sugar.
With that being said Im going to give them 4 stars cause I felt like they were almost more trouble than they were worth.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I SAW IT ON THE PAULA DEEN SHOW....BUT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT 1( SHE USED DEVILS FOOD CAKE......2( AFTER SHE BLENDED ALL THE INGREDIENTS SHE STUCK IN THE REFRIDGE FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS,,,THIS MAKES IT MUCH EASIER TO ROLL OUT THEN ROLL IN POWDER SUGAR! BUT STILL BOTH ARE SUPER GREAT!

These are very, very yummy. However, they are not especially unique and they're SUPER rich. I think I will experiment with other flavors of cake mix in the future to get the maximum personality out of these cookies.

I originally started making these cookies a year ago after seeing them on the Food Network, and they are a favorite with my stepsons.  I go back and forth between doing them with chocolate and yellow cake mix.  They are fantastic with cold milk or soymilk.  Thanks for posting this one!

For me, they were just ok.  I'll give 4 stars, because the kids loved them, especially after I added the M&M's to the second batch.  Oh well, the good news is I'll stay out of them!

This recipe is so easy - great when you need a nice treat and you don't feel like getting tons of ingredients together.  I used a lemon cake mix and everyone in my family loves them.  These cookies are really moist and they don't dry out and get hard like most cookies!

these cookies are very tasty, but as many other reviewers stated, a variation on the cake mix flavor or addition of chocolate chips or icing would make them even better!

Simple, my 4 year old helped me make these! And VERY delicious! I baked them at the full 13 minutes because I don't care for really gooey cookies. The texture was perfect and they were a big hit. Next time, chocolate cake mix!

Super sweet and chewy.  I used a chocolate cake mix and added pastel M&M's (it was Easter).  The got rave reviews at the dinner we went to.  I didn't rate it a 5 because for me, they were almost too sweet.

These were wonderful=)I did have to follow the suggestions of deloreschl, by refrigerating overnight and using a cookie scoop. They were easy and my son loved them. I have another recipe for cake mix cookies that is similar to this one, but my cookies always turned out flat with it. I had to bake for about 12 minutes, but the cookies turned out perfect. Thanks so much for a great recipe and thanks to deloreschl for all of the helpful suggestions. My picky 2 year old son, ate 4 and a half of these before bed tonight, so they are a keeper for my family=)

I also tried rolling these in: brown sugar, white granule sugar, large granule sugar, colored granule sugar--All turned out lovely. I did not have a cake mix, so I made my own, and I used whole wheat flour --Worked extremely well. These cookies are extremely gooey, and I love them to death (their deaths).

A wonderful, flexible recipe! You can mold it to anyone's taste. I agree that it's better than the original Gooey Butter Cake which is very sweet. Thanks to all who left how they experimented with this recipe!

I love this cookie recipe, I have tried it with the confettti cake mix and it is wonderful.  I have tried both refrigerating it for about two hours and using right away and it's sticky right away and a little easier to put into balls after you refrigerate but it still tastes just as good either way.

I made these cookies tonight. My kids gobbled them up, however my brother and I weren't as crazy about them. I was excited when I read the recipe, thinking that the addition of the cream cheese and real butter would be really tasty. They are attractive looking, nice consistency, very moist and soft. However, I thought they tasted as though I was eating a spoonful of cake batter. I would not use a yellow cake mix again.  I will try a chocolate cake mix next time. I think they may have a better flavor.

Wow.  These were awesome!  My mom thought I bought them at an upscale bakery.  They are easy to make, not time consuming at all.  I used a cookie baller and it took me maybe 10 minutes to ball, roll in sugar, and place 2 dozen cookies.  Top notch.

These are so soft and gooey - Sometimes I add just a touch of lemon juice for a little different flavor.

Good, but very rich.  I bypassed rolling them in powdered sugar.  Didn't think they needed it and didn't want to bother with it.  I will make these again.

SO so so good. Gooey and not flat. The recipe is perfect exactly the way it's writen. However, I added a bag of mini chocolate chips to my second batch, and it was still so good, if not better.

These bake up very well.  Good consistency. But they taste like you're sucking a big spoonful of butter. I know they are "butter" cookies, but woa...

OH Good Lord are these good!  I've made a double batch for Christmas, and added some food coloring for fun, they look SO nice!  I kept them small, which helped keep them together.  They are very soft and SOOOO good.  I used a "vanilla" cake mix.  Fabulous.  Thanks, Kim!

Easy and yummy. Both the butter and the lemon were good. Can be a bit messy when forming balls though, which is why I only gave 4 stars. But it's an easy recipe and a quick and easy cleanup!

I cooked these cookies twice this weekend.  Everyone loved them. The cookies are soft and not too sweet which was a hit.  People could not stop eating them.

Use parchment paper to bake these cookies for easy clean up.  I had a problem with a little sticking to the pan.

I thought these were alright, but nothing special.  Others that tried them, however, loved them...and they're picky eaters.  They even asked for the recipe.

Yet another fantastic cookie recipe from Allrecipes.com... add some of your favorite jam to the center of these cookies and you're good to go! Don't worry about the handling problems. I had a paper towel with a little oil on it and just rubbed it on my hands once in a while.

These cookies were good, but I had to rate them lower since I had an awful time making them.  Even though I chilled the dough overnight, I had a terrible time rolling them into balls.  Also, after I had baked the amount of time indicated, the cookies were still so gooey they completely fell apart when I tried to take them off the cookie sheet.  Although they're yummy, I think I'll try the cake next time.
