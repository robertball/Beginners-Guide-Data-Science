Very good recipe on two levels:  1) very tasty (added more cheese), and 2) very easy to make, i.e. not a whole lot of prep time required.  Definitely going into the personal cookbook!

Made it exactly as indicated in the recipe.  Loved it.  Absolutely divine.   We are on a diet so we cut it into ten pieces, froze it and had breakfast for five days.  Going to make it again.  Also sent recipe to a friend whose kids and grandkids are coming to visit.  This is a real nummy num recipe.  I give it a 10
