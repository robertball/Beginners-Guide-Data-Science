Thanks for this recipe! I added a few things into it, like 1/2 tsp of Vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp of Almond extract, just to give it a little more zing to the flavor. Oh, I also added some macadamia nuts into the batch, and it came out Marvelous!   Two thumbs up!

I just made these cookies last night for my familly's oath of citizenship celebratrion and to take to work to share my joy there as well!    It was difficult to find dried blueberries, I don't shop at the right stores apparently, so I used blueberry juice infused cranberries (store-bought).  The color pattern was not red-white- blue like I anticipated.  For my cookies the color scheme looked like a typical golden brown of a sugar cookie wiht the dark read of the cranberries coming through... the white chocolate was kinda small to see. I did add the 1/2 tsp of vanilla as suggested before.  Overall the coookies tasted great!!  The juice from berries kept the cookies very moist and aromatic.  The dough was easy to handle and I even mixed it my hand.  The cookies once cooled just slide off the cookie sheets.  The cookies are very filling and tasty. The cookie consistency was kind of flakey which made for an interesting texture contrast compared to the fruit not like a typical hard shortbread cookie.   I don't have much experience baking, as this was only my 4th batch and 4th recipe to try, but I would make these again.

Only made 1/2 a batch and then used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  The colors are great for any patriotic holiday.  I made these for Memorial Day and they were a huge hit at the party.  The did flatten out a little bit as they baked, but that may have been because of the butter that I used.

This cookie recipe was the best!  I modified the recipe slightly after reading the reviews.  I used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of crisco and added 1 tsp of vanilla and they came out great!

The husband and I LOVED these.  Used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening (since I didn't have butter-flavored shortening, I added 1/4 t. of butter flavoring), and I added 1 t. vanilla.  The cookies came out moist and delicious--more people need to find this recipe!

I made this for a 4th of July get-together and it was a HUGE hit! The batch makes a ton of cookies and not a single cookie had to be thrown away. I highly recommend these! It was so memorable that a guest at our house for Halloween mentioned she was a little disappointed we hadn't made them again. ^_^  Now we know what to put on future menus!

I made the cookies exactly according to the recipe.  The cookies have a very soft texture but are far too sweet for my tatse.  I would make them again, but reduce the amounts of both sugars and white chocolate chip chips.  Otherwise, the blend of cranberries, white chocoalte and blueberries is a very nice flavor combination.

The colors are fun for July 4th picnics.  The flavors of the berries and chips were yummy.  The cookie base isn't anything spectacular - just a regualr cookie base.  I cut the recipe in half and used half butter and half crisco (butter flavor).

These are simply the most delicious chewy cookies.  I just love the combination of white chocolate, Blueberries and Cranberries.  These really are bakery quality and I will certainly be using this recipe again.  The guys are in for such a treat tonight when I take these cookies into work!

Very good!!  From having used my grandma's recipe for years and years that everyone absolutely LOVES, and knowing the ratio of ingredients in it, I actually used margarine, and I only used 3 sticks (1 1/2 cups) of it instead of 4 sticks; I also used 1 TBSP vanilla--who makes cookies without vanilla?!  Also, I felt that the amount of fruit and white chips in it was going to be way too much, so I used the whole 12 ounces of white chips, but then only used about 3/4 cup each of the blueberries and cranberries.  They're delicious!!

I gave these 4 stars because I made two changes.  I know, I hate when people do that too.  Instead of shortening, I used butter and added a tsp. of almond extract.  If I make it again, I will reduce the almond extract to 1/2 tsp and add 1/2 tsp of vanilla as per Blufoxie's suggestion.  My son who hates dried fruit LOVED these cookies and ate 6 of them in one sitting.  I too thought they were very good.  Can't wait to find out what the rest of the family thinks of them at the 4th of July picnic.

These are delicious! They melt in your mouth when they are right out of the oven. I substituted macadamia notes for the white chocolate chips because I'm shipping these overseas. Yum!

Wonderful recipe!  The only adjustment I had to make was an additional egg (total of 3 eggs), as my dough was very powdery and dry at the bottom of my mixing bowl.

Used this recipe twice to finish up some dried berries. Relatively easy and very yummy results. I would use less dried berries and more chocolate though as it was a bit too chewy with all the berries.

Delicious cookies that disappeared quickly.  My dough seemed too dry to form the cookies so I added a tablespoon or two of milk and they came out beautifully.  As someone else stated, the juice in the fruits keeps them nice and moist.  Will definitely be making again.
