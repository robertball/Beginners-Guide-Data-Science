This is simply divine! I make this in the crockpot.  I leave out the water and lightly saute the onions/peppers before adding to the mix.  Put in on high or low and you're good to go.  I also add a red pepper and onion packet to the mix.  I've also made this exactly 'as is' (except I still added the red pepper and onion mix) and it tastes the same as doing it in the crockpot.   I've also used this in my tamales!  You can make this in a variety of ways and it's still great!  Two thumbs up! ** Edited**  I am editing this from my original review from mid-August 2007, because I've made this several times since and have done it various ways.  I've now decided that the best way and the only way I'll make it is this way.  Put the meat in the crockpot and fill it with water.  Slice up an onion and add the entire jar of green salsa.  (That means I purchase two jars of green salsa, because the second jar I use later.)  Cover and cook for 8 hours/low.  A hour before I'm ready for dinner, I'll cut up and saute the peppers/onions.  When that's finished or near the end, I'll drain the water out of the crockpot and shred the meat in the crockpot.  Then I add the sauted peppers/onions, a jar of green salsa, I even add a bit of red salsa (it tastes good with a bit of it added), and the onion mix.  That's how I'll make it from now on, because somehow it just tastes better this way. Delicious!

Pay no attention to the negative review, this is EXCELLENT and very much reminded me of machaca! Although this isn't a "traditional" form of the recipe, it's an adapted version, which is pretty much a shredded beef filling (and what you're most likely to see in restaurants). Anyway, I did the first part of this in the crockpot and when it came to putting everything together on the stove, I used pimientos instead of the bell pepper. Can't wait to try the leftovers with eggs (another common method of cooking this). Thanks!

I have been making this recipe for years. I use a pound of green chilies instead of adding the green pepper, add a packet of onion soup, leave out the water and let it cook all day in a slow cooker. We eat it as a fiiling for flour tortilla's. It's just wonderful!

My family loves this as a filling for burritos.  I do use red salsa instead of green as that is what I usually have on hand. The recipe freezes well and there are always enough for two dinners (family of 6).  Pass the shredded cheese, additional salsa, sour cream, beans and rice, guacamole or anything else you like in your burritos.  Yum

I used my crock pot to cook this.  Took the same amount of time, but I was able to walk away from my kitchen.  Awesomely tender meat!

Really liked this recipe, even the kids liked it.  Added both Kosher and Garlic Salts to water while boiling. Substituted can of green chiles for green pepper. Used regular red salsa instead of the green, and I skipped the cilantro because I forgot at the store, but think it would be a nice addition. Really tasty.

This was very flavorful.  The meat didn't get as tender as I expected, but I think I'll try cooking it in the slow cooker next time to remedy that.  Also, depending on the salsa you use, you might need to add salt.  I think the key is using a quality salsa verde.  I used a local (Texas) fire-roasted salsa verde, and it gave it a great flavor.  If you use a cheap salsa, the result will be terrible.  Since you're not adding any other seasonings, it's key.  The cilantro adds brightness, which we all enjoyed.  Will make again.

Almost like my mom use to make.  Very tender and juicy.  A great filling for shells, wraps or nachos.

I made this for a family reunion so there would be something available when people wandered in at all hours and wanted breakfast or lunch or a snack.  It is easy and delicious.  It's great with scrambled eggs in a burrito.

I made this a little different than the recipe, using my crockpot, but otherwise stuck to the basic recipe and it was delicious! My dad is a retired firefighter and this was something I thought I'd serve him and the rest of the family while he was here visiting. He had to have the recipe! This is wonderful!

I like the mild flavor and the tomatillo/cilantro combo.  Of course, I had to add additional seasonings to the boiling water.  I just cannot boil meat in water with just onion.....

This is the best!!!  Used this as stuffing for quesadillas at a party and everyone wanted the recipe.  Versatile too.  You can use any kind of meat you wish with the same great result.  Hubby can't get enough of it.

Great beef filling for tacos, quesadillas, burritos, etc.  I substituted fresh homemade tomato salsa for the green salsa, jalepenos, and cilantro (there was plenty of jalepenos and cilantro in the salsa).  It turned out great.  Make sure to add a little salt at the end of cooking to taste.  Will be making this again.

Give this recipe a try, it is so good with sour cream, Sylvia Eccles Mexican Rice, and beans.  My husband loved Machaca burritos when we lived on the border and spent a fortune on them.  He almost died when I started making this recipe 2 years ago--he was so happy.  We have them almost every Sunday instead of the traditional roast and potatos and carrots.

Really good.  A great change from our typical taco fillings.  I used a whole jalapeno (about 2tbsp.), but I still thought it could have used a bit more spice.  Next time I'll season the beef with some salt, pepper and garic powder and add some cayenne after shredding the meat.

this taco filling is so wonderful and delightfully spicy. I don't think I'll ever go back to "normal" taco beef after making this filling.

Oh my ... this was a waste of a roast.  I invited company over and thank goodness they cancelled.  Edible, but wouldn't think of trying this again.  We ate it doctored up with a bunch of stuff in the fridge.  Didn't throw it away so it avoided 1 star.

This was good but not outstanding, perhaps because I had red salsa and not green like the recipe indicated. I couldn't get mine to shred either so I popped it into the food processor. Made a lot but think it could have used some other flavor like salt, garlic etc.

I made this Saturday. Made it mostly as the recipe directed. When I braise beef I always add a clove or two of garlic and instead of all water I used one can of low sodium chicken broth and water. While the meat was cooling I cooked down the cooking broth to concentrate the flavors. This made for some good tacos. With some added cheese, Avocado and Pico Pica hot sauce.

Yum yum yum. Any time all three of my kids and my husband like dinner it's a hit. 
I had to cook the meat about 3 hours and add more water after about 2 hours to get the meat to get tender.  I still couldn't break it apart with a fork so I pulled it apart.  I let it simmer with the cooked onions and green pepper, etc. for about a half hour. It was delicious! Thanks!

I found it a bit bland so I added a bit of taco seasoning, liquid smoke, and chipotle.
