It was so good!! I made as directed, and it was delicious... I made it for my parents, my niece and myself, everybody loved it! I did add canned chicken, and on the side I cooked up some jalapenos and onions, that I didnt mix with the pasta. I like spice but not everybody does, so i just added the onions and jalapenos on mine. So good!! Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make again. Maybe I'll add some mushrooms next time.

I doubled it so I could use a full box of pasta, the broth I brought up to four cup, or one box of stock, the other ingredients I doubled as well......turned out great.  Had more stock on hand if I needed it, but this time I didn’t.  Will do that again so I’ll have leftovers.

This was awesomely tasty! We barely had any leftovers. I broke the pasta in half, so it would fit in my skillet better. I ended up using the entire standard size carton of chicken broth, and probably only half the amount of salt and pepper. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Served with Italian seasoned baked chicken and some green veggies. Family says this recipe is a keeper!

I doubled the recipe.  I used a lg 49oz can of chicken broth, whole pint of heavy cream, 2c parm cheese, and  used angel hair instead.  It was very good.  Next time, I would use less Parmesan cheese and maybe a a thicker pasta, like maybe linguini fini.  I don’t care for spaghetti and I think fettuccine would be too thick.  It was very quick and easy to make.  I loved the “one” pot recipe, not a lot of clean-up.  I would make this again. Thank  you

I have made this several time as written and it's perfect every single time.  It's so easy to throw together on those busy work week nights.  Pour a glass of red wine and enjoy.

The taste is sublime, but very very rich. I added king prawns to finish and a salad on the side, which was delicious together with the pasta!
next time I will drain the remaining stock from the pasta before adding the cream and cheese, as the sauce was extremely thin and didn't stick to the pasta.

Used a full package of angel hair pasta split in half, 4 cups of broth and all other ingredients increased by about a third. The angel hair pasta took slightly less time to cook. Loved it. Will definitely do it again.

This turned out well. I used 2% instead of cream and it worked. I will add more garlic next time.

KEEPER!  Easy but tasty and elegant enough for company.  Kids were fighting over the leftovers.  I added scallops that I seared in the butter garlic and then took out of the pan.  Added them back into the creamy spaghetti.  So many ways to dress up or eat as directions call. Very good.

I added shrimp, lemon juice and the rind of a lemon… Always good choices in my mind! I think it was much more flavourful as a result.

Great recipe! I made a few minor changes, like using veggie broth instead of chicken broth and substituting 1/4 of a pkg of cream.cheese for the cream.  Then, I added shrimp scampi to it.

This dish is always good, and today I added some chicken (from the Penne w/chicken recipe!) along with some asparagus - I steamed it;  (it was frozen from Aldi's and it's always good, too). This dish is a winner no matter what you do.  A nice salad, garlic bread and of course a nice glass of wine makes an awesome dinner for everyone.

Pretty easy to make and tasty! I use whole wheat pasta and add peas and shrimp. I use the whole container of chicken broth and skip the extra salt.

Excellent! Made exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. I have never been a big fan of alfredo sauce but my husband loves it. I had seconds, which is a first for me and alfredo.

It lacked flavor. I added so extra seasoning to it my daughter called it garlic bread pasta. I added probably 7 or so more seasonings and I still thought it bland. Green top onions would've been a nice addition to it.

My family’s current favorite dish I’ve made. I used the entire standard chicken broth box & added some cream cheese to make it a little more creamy. Also served with precooked small shrimp. I would definitely recommend this recipe!

I doubled the recipe and used angel hair pasta for this. I also used grilled chicken and it was delicious. I was impressed that I was able to do this all in one T-Fal skillet, so it made cleanup very easy. I foresee this being at least a once a month meal in my home!

This was so easy and so good.  I will definitely be making it again!!  I used 1/2 and 1/2 in place of the heavy cream, otherwise, made it exactly as directed.  Just trying to make it a little more healthy.  Served it with grilled chicken and broccoli.   Can't wait for the leftovers.

Made it as written an served with some broccoli and garlic bread.  My husband and I both liked it, but I think it was actually a bit too much cheese, and I LOVE cheese.  I think I could leave out at least 1/4 (maybe 1/2) of the cheese next time, and it would still be good but cut down some of the calorie/fat content.

We will most assuredly make it again. My mom is sensitive to tomato based dishes (burns her mouth). She loved this one. We used angel hair pasta. Next time I am using spaghetti squash for the pasta.

Followed the recipe and it was delicious. I did use fresh parsley instead of dried and I add some pancetta and sautéed cipollini onions in at the end. Would make again.

I served fresh, seared scallops on top, adding crushed red pepper to spice it up. It was incredibly delicious and decadent. It is not a low calorie dinner but a fabulous comfort meal that got raves from everyone. I will definitely make it again, next time with chicken, shrimp, sausage or salmon.

I used half & half instead of heavy cream and I think I could have used a half cup plus a 1/4 cup of milk instead. It was plenty rich enough for our taste.  I also added leftover roast chicken. This is a very versatile recipe!

Loved this recipe. I was a bit skeptical not letting the pasta soak up the broth then adding the cream and Parmesan. The pasta was done perfectly and it was just creamy enough . I added a handful of spinach instead of the parsley , my husband almost licked the plate.

One can add any sort of extras like mushrooms, leftover meats, etc. I actually used cream cheese instead of the cream and added more broth to loosen the sauce. Quite tasty.
