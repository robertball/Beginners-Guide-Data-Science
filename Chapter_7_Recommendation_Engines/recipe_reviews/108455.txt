This was, as billed: easy, delicious and classic. I omitted the chopped chili for the younger members of the family and left it simmering on low for the afternoon and it was delicious. Perfect for a rainy Seattle fall day. Not that it rains here...

Awesome starter chili recipe!  I love to use this recipe as a base and then change it up!  

For example, change out a pound of the ground beef for a pound of ground spicy or sweet italian sausage (without casings)
 
I also love to mix up the type of beans used to give the chili some character.  I made this for an event and used one can of butter beans, one can of kidney beans and one can of pinto beans (same sized cans).  It was a hit!  

Don't be afraid to make small changes to this great base!

I've never been a fan of chili but this was amazing.  I did need to make a few alterations out of necessity.  I substituted the jalapenos for 3 hot cherry peppers and only used 3T. of chili powder.  This was a great half time meal for my family/guests

I won't say this is the BEST chili recipe but it certainly is easy to make and requires little effort for a nice end product. I browned my meat and threw everything into the slow cooker while I was making holiday cookies and it was a nice warm treat when I was finished with my baking. This goes great with some cheese and sour cream on top!

I thought this chili was OK. My husband and the people at his job really loved it, but I wasn't that big of a fan. Maybe because I made my own beans first and then followed the recipe. I'd make it again but skip making my own beans...and add some more spice to it! :-)

Very good starting point! I don't claim to be a chili expert but I know what I like, so in addition to what's on this recipe, here is what I would add or take away. Also, I used a pressure cooker!

This time around I didn't put any beans (Yes, I know, I know that beans make it less authentic but I don't care, I generally like it in my chili).

I used minced garlic from a jar instead of garlic powder. In addition to the chili powder, I also added paprika, cayenne powder, cumin, ancho chile powder, chipotle chili powder. I added those spices while I was cooking the onions and bell pepper to "wake up" the spices.

I also added a 6 ounce can of tomato paste to thicken it, and a can of medium to heavy body beer (don't use something lame like Miller Lite).

And to me, here is the most important part: I bought mixed ground meat from the supermarket which consists of beef, pork, and veal as well as a pound of Italian sausage. Again, authenticity is great but trust me, the Italian sausage and mixture of ground meats makes the flavor really tasty as opposed to JUST using ground beef.

Also, I used stew beef (beef round chunks) and a pressure cooker: cook for only 20 minutes! Of course, you only start counting once that doohickey starts rocking back and forth from the steam.

Phew! That's a lot of changes!

I made this recipe including two seeded and diced jalapeños, and two small cans of tomato paste. (The tomato paste was really unnecessary but I have tons of it and needed to get rid of some of it.) Also, I don't keep ground beef so I used 90/10 Bison meat instead. This recipe made a full pot for me, so I was able to can 3 large Ball jars and still have enough for dinner for two. I simmered for 3 hours. I'm a fan of spice, and this recipe had just enough IMO. Also, I like a little bean variety so I did a can of pinto, black, and kidney.

It sounds yummy and will make it tonight. (I had red kidney beans in a chili I really liked made by my bro in law-a native Texan. So I think I'll use those instead) I don't think the authenticity matters as much as the taste and this sounds great! Have a bag of Frederiksburg Tx. Campfire cornbread mix to go with-yeehaw! Thank you very much for sharing.

This is seriously hot chili, and that's a good thing. Since the recipe doesn't specify color, I used a red bell pepper. I can't stand the texture of cooked tomatoes, so used paste and water. I like the heat, used all the jalepeno, browned with the red pepper for extra dimension. I can't wait to see how it tastes tomorrow. Thanks for a most excellent recipe.  It's a keeper!

Loved this recipe!!! So easy to make. I substituted ground turkey for the beef (used a little vegetable oil to brown) and I cut the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp. Turned out perfect! Goes great with some sweet corn bread.

This was an excellent chili.  I did make a few changes.  I used two cans of Bush's Chili beans.  I also added 4 cloves of garlic, diced potatoes, small elbow macaroni, and some oregano.  A half cup of chili powder seemed excessive to me so I only added a quarter cup and it was plenty hot enough.  Nice recipe.

This makes some great chili, but I wanted it to be meatless so I left the ground beef out and used a mexican tomato sauce and Pace Hot Picante sauce, the beans had a nice kick to them. I did use the jalapenos, but I used pickled ones. I took it to work for a mexican carry in and everyone loved it. I served the leftovers with Chilaquiles II from this site, went very well together.

This turned out really good as a starter recipe.  I added more tomato sauce (twice as much), stew meat instead of ground meat, small pastas called  Ditalini (hand full), and cumin to taste. Yum!

Good easy Texas chili! Medium sweat, not too spicy for hubby, not too bland for me (I love spicy!). This turned out a nice tomatoey chili pepper taste. I used dried minced onion, frozen diced green pepper, minced garlic, and diced jalapeno in the jar. I used ranch style beans, semi drained, as it was the closest thing I had to pintos that weren't refried in my pantry. I simmered this 1 hour covered. Very good chili, Roger, Thanks for sharing this.

Came out watery for some reason.  We had to cook it much longer than it calls for.  My family is not big on spice, so we left that out.. made this a little bland.  Added some worchestire sauce and a little bit of cumin.  Once we topped with cheddar and put some saltines on the side, it was pretty good!

Good chili, but not should not be called Texas chili.  A real Texan would never, ever put beans in their chili.

This was WAY too spicy.  Was it a typo asking for 1/2 cup of chili powder?  I didn't even use the jalapeños peppers and no one could eat it.  I made it for 10 adults (some love spicy food) and they all agreed that it was way too spicy and that it should have been 3-4 teaspoons of chili powder, not 1/2 cup! ….Niki

Good, true in Texas there are no beans in the chili but they were sure good in there. I drained and rinsed the beans before I added them.

This chili was good.  I first made as is, except for the jalapenos, and let simmer, then tasted.  I felt like I needed to spice it, so I added some cumin and oregano.  It was really good.  Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good standard chili recipe what would work well for many things!  I had to use kidney beans (all I had).  Served over baked potatoes, talk about comfort food.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing!

I followed this recipe to the letter right down to the 3 jalapenos. I cooked it on the stove top for an hour. I love spicy food and this is spicy but there is no depth of flavor. Would I recommend it? No. Will I make it again? Probably not.

My husband is picky---and HE LOVES THIS CHILI!  He asks for it all the time.  I cut the chili powder down by about half, added about a half lb. more ground beef and only two cans of the pinto beans.  I have never written a review before, but this one warrants five stars!

LOVED THIS CHILI!!!  DH said it was the best I'd ever made.  Only changes I made was to cut recipe to half (only the 2 of us) but did use 2 lbs. meat.  Used 1 can chopped tomatoes, 1 can Ro-Tel Mexican tomatoes and 1 14 oz can tomato sauce.  Cooked in slow cooker on high for 1 hour and on low for 5-6 hrs.  Will made this my main chili recipe.

4.5 stars. Very good but not quite amazing. I used diced tomatoes from my garden instead of the canned. I also used 2.5 lbs ground turkey instead of the beef and fresh garlic. Everything else was pretty much as written. USE A VERY LARGE POT. My largest pot is only about 5 qts and I had to transfer some of the chili to another pan because it was overflowing. The leftovers are still simmering on my stove and I will freeze them for later meals (Way cheaper, healthier, and better tasting than canned chili!). Ideas for additions to make it amazing: celery, corn, bacon, cumin, cocoa powder, cinnamon.

I was looking for a simple recipe for chili, as I am just learning how to cook. I cannot imagine this recipe tasting any better.  People have been calling this a base recipe, but I think it is fine just the way it is. I omitted the jalapenos, and the amount of chili pepper was absolutely perfect. I will be using this recipe again, thank you for posting this!

Fantastic chili! Left out the jalapeno and have tried less chili powder on occasion.  Actually won 3 of 4 chili cook-off competitions in last 4 years in my church from this recipe, and I never cooked chili before I tried this recipe! Try it out!

My family and I really enjoyed this!  I did make small changes, like just 1 TBS of chopped jalapeno, cutting back the chili powder to 1/4 cup, and adding 1 TBS of cumin and 1 TBS of paprika.  It had a really nice kick to it, without it being to hot for kids.  Definitely a keeper!

This chili recipe made me famous!  Everyone begs me to make it in the fall/winter.  I did change a couple minor things:  I use 3lbs of ground beef and one 2 cans of pinto beans.  I also use an additional can of tomato sauce and a little more of the spices.  The major change I made is using one 2 TBSP of chili powder.  1/2c was way too spicy for me!  I also only use 1 jalapeno.  These changes still give it a little kick without being too spicy and hot for us to handle.  This recipe is easy enough to adjust to whatever taste you prefer.

I made this recipe exactly as written except I cut down on the chili powder.  Excellent recipe---a keeper!!  I found it a bit spicy--I am in my last trimester of pregnancy and am dealing with indigestion, and this recipe had me running for the antacids.  Husband thought it was perfect though.  I froze half of it for after baby is here and I can really enjoy it!

My husband loved this recipe!  I added a jar of medium salsa and a can of jalapeno salsa (in the Mexican food section) to spice it up bit more.  It was too much for me so I added extra sour cream and cheese, but my husband ate 3 bowls. =)

This is good stuff! I made the following modifications: used only 1/2 of an onion, 1/2 of a green pepper, omitted the beans, and used one 32 oz can each of crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce, and cut the chili powder down to 1/4 cup. I browned the meat, onion, and pepper, then mixed everything up in the slow cooker and let it simmer all day. It was great. I'll be using leftovers tomorrow night to make Frito chili pies!

Just threw it together in the crock pot with very few changes.  I used fresh garlic, & only 2 cans of beans.  Instead of regular pinto beans I used 1 can flavored with slab bacon and 1 can of chili beans. The flavor is already wonderful.  Have a feeling this will be amazing come tomorrow.  Might need to add more heat then. Might be too thick.  *Next day afted on low all night in crockpot.  This chili is just right in texture and thickness.  Added about 1-1/2 tsp sugar to take away some acidity and added about 1 tsp smoked paprika.  This chili is AWESOME!!!  Ate it for breakfast cuz I couldn't wait. LOL

I ate the whole pot! ...over a period of time. Its not very hot so I used less bell pepper and more jalepeno. Next time I think I will use fresh garlic. I simmered it for a good hour, let it sit for about a day in the fridge and then divided it into 2 cup containers to freeze. Wonderful low cal yet filling lunch.

I used ground sausage rather then ground beef (one pack mild, one pack hot) and changed the green pepper to an orange one for a bit of sweetness. I took out the hot peppers and added a few teaspoons of chili powder. This made a sweeter chili that is just the right heat for younger ones. Good recipe :)

Instead of pinto beans I added kidney beans and made it with Turkey meat. This hearty dish is quick and easy to make. Each time that I have made it, it has been scraped clean.

Very good.  I did make some changes.  I did not brown the ground beef first; I put it in the chili raw.  I swear it cooks and the ground beef tastes so much better. (Don't be afraid to try this!) I brought it to a boil and then turned it down to simmer for 1-1/2 hours (90 minutes).  The other changes I made is 2 cans of kidney beans instead of pinto, left out the jalapeno peppers (personal choice), 1/4 c chili powder and 1 tsp crushed cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes.  And I did saute the onion and bell pepper before I added them to the chili. I made corn muffins and put a corn muffin in the bottom of the chili bowl, and put the chili on top.  Top the chili with shredded mexican cheese and sour cream.  Mmmm, mmmm!!

Way too spicy and not enough flavor. I used less than the recommended amount of spices and it was still way too spicy. All we could taste way the spice, will not make again.

Really spicy!  I wish there was more flavor to add besides having the spice overpower your mouth...but this was still a crowd pleaser.

This is a great recipe!  I did want to use my slow cooker for about half the portion (10 servings) so I browned the meat, drained it and put it in the slow cooker.  Everything else was cut up as instructed and went right into the slow cooker.  I did use a large clove of fresh garlic, finely chopped, instead of the garlic powder.  I also added cumin and oregano.  I always put a fresh tomato (along with the canned tomatoes) cut into quarters, into my chili  as I love the flavors that are absorbed!

Ok all of you die hard Texans (me included) this is pretty awesome chili WITH beans.  I made as is and we loved it.  Really good with a side of Mexican Cornbread or over fritos smothered with cheese and onions.  Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty good. I let it simmer for probably 2 1/2-3 hours, and it was nice and thick. I used 2 cans of chili beans and a can of kidney beans. I had to sub crushed tomatoes for the tomato sauce, since that's what I had. Next time I might add a little cumin, since we normally like that in our chili. Thanks for a good recipe.

This was a great recipe to start with! I substituted the pinto beans with kidney beans, added cumin to the spices and pretty much tripled everything to feed everyone. Everyone said it was one of the best chili they've had! We will definitely be using this recipe again!

This recipe is great. I have made it twice now and my boyfriend and I loved it both times. It's isn't anything fancy, so some people might want to add to it I suppose. But the flavor is awesome, definitely spicy but that can be adjusted. I didn't have cumin but agree it would be good, I did add paprika and cayenne pepper. I used ground turkey instead of beef. Otherwise didn't change a thing. Easy to make on a weeknight and freezes really well.

I've made this 3 times now and feel like I owe it a review. I've stayed pretty true to the recipe but have tried a different variety of beans each time I've made it and have settled on these improvements. Those changes being: I use only 2 cans of beans, 1 regular pintos and the other pintos with jalapeños( still trying to get used to beans in my chili). I also use the 3 jalapeños, 2 seeded and deveined and one whole seeds and all. The 2 cans of diced tomatoes, (i use one regular and one mexican blend) I run through a blender and purée them as much as possible otherwise my family picks them out. I've tried not to "change" anything for this recipe, rather just enhance the instructions. It's a great chili recipe and all of my friends now ask me to make it for all the games. Will keep it as my go to recipe from now on. Thanks!!

This was very good chili! I am a newlywed and I am trying to gather recipies that will be easy and delicious for me to make. I used less meat and instead of kidney beans I used black beans. I poured the chili in large soup mugs and sprinkled cheese in the middle. I surounded the cheese with Fritos scoops and made it look like a flower. I call it "Chili Flower"

This chili is delicious! I've never made chili before--I'm a kinda new cook.  But I used rotel in the place of diced tomatoes and added brown sugar and other spices.  MM mm spicy and tastey.

Best chili I've had in a long time! It was very good. I recommend adding 2 cloves of fresh garlic. I only used 2 cans of pinto beans to cut down on excess calories. Wonderful chili.

My boyfriend and I are living in Japan and had a craving for some chili, so we decided to try this recipe. A friend just sent us some tortilla chips, so we added a cup of sour cream and about half a block of cheddar cheese to make a dip. It was fantastic! We'll have leftovers for ages!

Yummy!  This chili was spicy :)  Maybe too spicy for my 11-year old though.  We used half ground beef, and half ground chicken, and substituted kidney beans.  I also added some cocoa powder as other recipes call for this ingredient and I was intrigued.  My husband raved about the leftovers the next day.  And it IS very easy - just like the name says.  Enjoy!

This was Awesome. I only adjusted it a tiny bit, with 1 teaspoon sugar and 1 teaspoon cocoa powder. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! I thought the 1/4 cup of chili powder would be too much. I added to taste, and probably added a 1/4 cup after all was said and done. My hubby gobbled this up! Quick, easy, and delicious. Was great with some cheddar and sour cream on top.

This is a perfectly lovely easy and basic traditional type of chili but please re-name this dish.  Calling anything with beans a "Texas Chili" is almost as big of an insult as saying "Bless your heart" in Texas.

I slow cooked this in the crockpot.  I have made this recipe dozens of times.  my family loves it and I never have left overs for more than a day.  I recomend the crockpot bc I've tried it both ways and it just comes out better in the crockpot.

This is an excellent recipe. But I never add beans to the chili. If someone wants pintos, I have a pot sitting on the side along with queso fresco, onions and jalapenos. If someone puts kidney beans in their chili, I call the fire department and declare a disaster.

Get those beans out of there and you got some decent chili. Ingredients seem ok and it is a flavorful pot.......just don't put beans in it and it's ok

So easy and really good. It is a basic recipe that you can change to your specific taste. I used all the ingedents it called for but in small amounts. I added some chicken broth as it was too thick. It smells so good. It is not quite done but I've tasted it a few times and YUM! I can't wait to have it for dinner. As others suggested I'm pair it wil cheese and fritos. It reminds me of chili my grandma use to make.

This is a good starter recipe.  I omitted the peppers and replaced them with crushed white pepper, 2 cloves minced garlic, and also added 2 tbsp butter and 4 tbsp brown sugar.  I made enough for about 12 servings, so you may need more if you are making 7 quarts of chili or more.  My chili turned out pretty tasty, but if you like it more mild I suggest leaving out the white pepper, and less brown sugar (mainly used it to counter the heat)

This is how my husband remembers his mom's chili tasting.  We only wanted a small batch, so we cut most ingredients in half (we stayed with 2 lbs of ground beef and 2 jalapenos but only used one can of beans).  It was spicy but not overwhelmingly so.  We topped it with sour cream, onions and cheese, and it was fantastic; even our 3-year old ate it right up!

I LOVE this recipe!  It's the best chili recipe I've found yet.  However, I substitute the green pepper with a red pepper and I also add a little water (about 1 cup) to it to make it a little less thick.  I also rinse the pinto beans before adding them, this makes the flatulence effect more bearable. lol.  One more change...I use petite diced tomatoes.  That's just a preference.

This is nothing special, but it is a good starter chili.  I had to more chili powder, cumin and sugar to get it to taste anything like chili.
