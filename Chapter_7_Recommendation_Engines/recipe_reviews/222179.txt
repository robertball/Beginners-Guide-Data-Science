This was a good curry. I followed the recipe exactly and I feel like it needed something more - maybe some vegetables besides onion.

I made this for the first time & we enjoyed it very much! I took the advice of another reviewer & added some green peppers, mushrooms & even 2 parsnips to the potatos. We didn't have the hot curry powder on hand, just the regular curry spice, so we added some oriental hot sauce in a pinch & it all worked out great. I'll make it again for sure.

Just made this, with the following changes:

I added more hot curry than the recipe calls for, and left out the mild curry, which I substituted for garam masala. (1/4 c.). I also added some turmeric and one finely chopped jalepeno pepper. I also added a little bit of fresh and finely chopped ginger. I did not add any more vegetables, and feel like this is a definite keeper for the fall and winter months, and will be great with rice or naan! I didn't make a side for this because of the starches in the potatoes, but it went over really well, and I am told, has a very authentic taste.

This is a great recipe! And I'm so grateful I found it and was able to build off it to suit my personal taste! I did use a few suggestions from other reviewers. Like adding fresh minced ginger and Garam Masala  (it's crazy how I just happened to HAVE that on hand!) 

Ok so here's what I did. I changed the serving to just 2 and didn't measure anything. I just tasted as I went. 

Boiled 1 breast in some chicken broth and while I prepared some jasmine rice in the rice cooker and sautéed the garlic, minced ginger, onions with a little cumin sprinkled on top. (I like the flavor of carmalized cumin onions!) Then I cut up some carrots and threw in the 2 russet potato I peeled and cubed. Sautéed a few mins then added Garam Masala, Curry, Tumeric, and a dash of Cayenne as well as salt and pepper to taste. I poured a small amount of water out of the pot of boiling chicken (so it wouldn't be too soupy) and tossed the sautéed mixture into the chicken and broth and boiled with one bay leaf. I kept adding the spices mentioned above as I went and tasted frequently. I mixed a little cornstarch with cold water and added that to thicken this up just a little and Toward the end, I added a splash of lemon juice and mixed in a dollop of Greek yougurt. I finished it off by tossing in some thinnly sliced fresh green onion and served with a side of rice and steamed brocolli. So yummy!
Even my picky 3 year old is eating it, which is LITERALLY a miracle! I didn't even offer him any because I thought h

I made this as a base for wrap sandwiches. I simmered whole boneless thighs in a small amount of water. The rest of the recipe was prepared as directed adding only a bit of garam masala to the curries. After cutting chicken and adding to curry mix, I added just enough water from boiling pot to ease mixing. Spread on a bed of dressing and spinach leaves in a tortilla wrap, was delicious.

Pretty good but I overcooked my potatoes so they kind of mushed when I stirred everything together.

I often crave this dish and my mother can never give me an exact recipe.  I was so happy to find this.  It's delicious! 

PS, I'm Assyrian too!

I love that you can reduce the fat by boiling the chicken (I also boiled potatoes), and no loss of flavor.
Thanks for a great and healthy recipe!!

Delish!  I made it without the hot curry and it was fine.  I did add slivered almonds to the mixture and topped it off with coconut.  i made jasmine rice steamed in coconut milk, water and a little sugar.  end result was fabulous.  only drawback was that my house smelled like an indian buffet!

No--I was not too impressed with this recipe because it seemed to not have enough spices in it.  I added Tumeric and ginger and more hot curry and some cayenne.  Also, salt measurement is unclear.  You do want to not skimp on salt!  Tastes better the next day.  I will add cauliflower for interest if I try this recipe again!

This was a perfect curry! Only change was I scaled it down to 2 servings. Was easy to make but was so flavorful used normal curry powder and vindaloo curry powder for the hot one. Served over rice with pita bread and was a wonderful satisfying meal!

I would add a little less water the next time, it turned out a little too soupy for my taste. I added coconut, bell peppers, and mushroom to mine :)

It was so good and easy to follow. I made it more than once and each time it was just as delicious.
