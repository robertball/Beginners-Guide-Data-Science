Followed recipe very closely except used frozen OJ and about 2x the annatto.  I made this for three people and cooked it on a river rafting trip.  The pork marinaded longer 8-36 hours (cooked it twice) and it was great both times.  Grilled it on a gas grill once and a grill pan on the stove top the other.  Both were excellent.

This was different and really good on the grill.  We had with rice and a salad tonight.  Tomorrow I will shred the left overs for tacos. I did add a tablespoon of sugar because my juices tasted too sour for me.  But I think a little more would have been fine. I will go with 2 tablespoons in the future, depending on the sweetness of my juices.  Otherwise, I made it according to directions.  A cilantro sprinkling was a great idea.  I didn't go with the cabbage, but will try it next time. Thanks for a unique flavor, Chef John!

Absolutely delicious! Tangy, spicy, juicy, awesome! Kept with the recipe except for cayenne and substituted 2 tsp adobo sauce and onions (from a can of chilies in adobo) since I didn't have any dried chipotle peppers. The only problem I had was getting it to cook through since i rarely bbq pork. I overcooked it and it was still amazing! Will perfect and make a part of my regular dinner arsenal!

I used tumeric rather than annatto but otherwise followed the ingredient list.  I was using a new BBQ grill that didn't leave very good markings, so don't judge this photo of mine too harshly.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks once again, Chef John!

This was amazing and incredibly simple. I made no changes other than ommitting the anneto because I couldn't find any. It was so good that I remade the marinade and tried it with chicken the following night and it too was fantastic. Bravo, sir.

I followed the recipe except I added more cayanne by accident. I got my ground annetto from amazon.com. This recipe was really good. You should try this soon. I may try this with a large top round steak for fajitas.

It needed to marinade longer than the 4 hours but i was short on time. Very good! Just watch the cooking time as not to over cook it. 

I did cut back on the cayenne pepper a bit as i dont like thinks that are too spicey, but i think next time i may make it unmodified and marinade overnight. 

I would make it again for sure!

I used this recipe for the flavor profile. I did an ingredient search for pork and oranges, having leftover pork roast and oranges to use up. I made the marinade, poured it over the pork roast in a skillet, and warmed the roast up slowly, covered. Served it atop a veggie-forward pasta primavera. Yum!

Made pork tacos, was amazing. I saved out a half pint of marinade and cooked it down with some brown sugar and glazed the meat on the grill.  Then after slicing we stirred the rest of the glaze into the meat.

This recipe was wonderful! Sliced the meat very thin for use as pork tacos and topped individually with Grilled Pineapple Salsa and Pico de Gallo (both recipes from this site). The only changes made was substituting annatto with smoked paprika and reduced the cayenne by half. Flavors of the pork really came through and reminded us of being back in Mexico. Topped with pineapple salsa made us think of the Al Pastor we used to get. Thank you for this easy and delicious recipe, Chef John!

I made the marinade as advertised. It was fantastic. I did not have any pork tenderloins so I used chicken breasts instead. They worked perfect. 

Thank you.

Okay--I'll be back to edit later but just want to say that so far,  the marinade tastes delicious.  I can't wait to try this!  Didn't have Annatto on hand but will be finding some for the future.

We loved this one. The flavors rocked!  The Grilling instructions were helpful too. I served it with mango salsa and made tacos with it.  It was delicious and husband was impressed with my grilling too. I will make this again.

Loved this marinade! I thought I had chipotle powder but I didn't so I had to sub with regular chili powder, but it was still fabulous! Also, I halved the recipe and used pork chops because that's what I had on hand. I grilled them for 4 minutes per side and they were perfect! Totally making this again.

We don't like spicy food so I cut out the chipotle and cayenne pepper.  I did not have any annotto powder.  It was too cold to Grill so I cut the recipe amounts in half and put my pork in the crock pot.  Came out really well.  Next time I'll leave out the cumin as well but will try this recipe again.

Super flavorful recipe!! We ended up using pork chops and cooking this on the stove (seared the meat and then simmered in the marinade). Definitely going to try this on the grill, might save the marinade and boil it to make a sauce on the side. Great recipe and easy too! Would work well with chicken or fish too!
