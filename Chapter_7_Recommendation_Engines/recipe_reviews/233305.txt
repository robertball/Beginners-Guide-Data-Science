This was easy to make, and a real crowd pleaser! Also - very pretty. I made it twice, serving to different friends, and it was a solid hit. Letting it sit out before serving for - maybe 10 minutes - makes slicing pieces and serving much easier. 
I'm ready to branch out with different flavors of ice cream, perhaps Moose Tracks. Or - Mint Chip? My imagination is running wild, and I'm starting to drool in anticipation! LOL
