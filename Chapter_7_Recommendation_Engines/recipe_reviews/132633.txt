I made this Cheesecake today just because and WOW, Phenomenal Cheesecake, I bumped up the recipe to 15 servings because I was using a 10" Springform instead of a 9", I reduced the butter in the crust to 3T, and added a little of the eggnog to the crust mixture. I also added about 3T of Southern Comfort to the recipe as my family loves Eggnog and SoCo. I baked it at 275, for 2:45, and cooled it in the oven for about 2:30, and then stuck it in the fridge. DELICIOUS, I'll be making it again SOON.

Excellent cheesecake, prbably one of he best recipes I tried...and I bake A LOT of chessecakes.... but baking for 3.25 hours at 200 didn't cause it to set enough...I had to bake it for another hour for a total of 4.25 hours.  It was so creamy and smooth it justed melted in you mouth!

Made this for the holidays and it was FANTASTIC.  Best consistency of any cheescake I've ever baked and a super easy method as well.  I poured slightly less than a cup of eggnog and added approximately 1/4 cup of Kahlua.  For the crust I used ginger snap cookies and chopped pecans.  Next time I will garnish with french vanilla whip cream and toasted pecan halves.

Used 2 pre-made graham cracker crusts instead.  With another 1/2 cup of eggnog, I had enough to fill 2 pie crusts.

Easy to make and very tasty! Made this for Christmas and everyone loved it. I did use a ginger snap crust instead of plain vanilla and I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the cheesecake mixture.

Made this for New Year's Eve party.  Likely the best cheesecake I've ever made.  And no cracks!  Had to bake it a wee bit longer than in the recipe, but it was absolutely perfect!  

I whipped whipping cream with a whisk by hand (yes it takes longer, but it doesn't break down and turn back into watery weird stuff and lasts for days) and used a piping bag to decorate the top and then grated a wee bit of fresh nutmeg on top of the whipped cream.  

To die for!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a new years party and got rave reviews.  I was told by a person who is obsessed with finding the best cheesecake in the world that this was it.  The texture was amazing, the balance of flavours was great.  The flavour of the eggnog was subtle enough that even people not crazy about it would still love the cake.  The only adjustments I made was that I did not do a water bath, I put a pan of water underneath.  I also increased the temperature of the oven to 300 in the last hour because I needed it to cook faster.  I think at 200 it would have taken at least 4.5 hours to cook.  I turned the oven off when the middle was still very wobbly, but left the oven closed for 2 hours.  It cooked right through and wasn't overcooked.  FANTASTIC!! Thank you so much Kim (BRIMAT143) for this excellent recipe!

I made this cheesecake for Christmas and it was perfect! I do not care for eggnog so I was worried the flavor would be too strong, but it wasn't. Even the picky children LOVED it!!! Maybe next time I will add Khalua like someone else stated earlier. Wonderful in every way!!

I like it with the graham crust and with the ginger snap crust as well.  Always a big hit around the holidays.  The water bath in the instructions along with cooking it slow really helps yield a super creamy cheesecake.

Sorry, but that was the worst cheesecake i've ever made. After baking for 3hrs, it came out the same way it went in. So, i baked it an add'l hour at 350, and it was finally cooked. Very disappointing.

OH....MY....GAWD!!!!! This was amazing! I used ginger snap cookies (recipe found on this site) for the crust and added some nutmeg and cinnamon to it. I also used homemade eggnog (amazingly good egg nog recipe from this site) but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. For a topping, I whipped up some whipping cream with a touch of egg nog and cinnamon to give it some extra flavour. Topped with Baileys Irish Cream and some raspberries. I don't even want to know how many calories were in this, but it was quite possibly the absolute best cheesecake that I have ever eaten. SO creamy. My cheesecake did crack, but I haven't perfected that yet....it'll come with time. I can't even begin to describe how absolutely fantastic this was.

Made exactly as stated except used a water bath as some other suggested. I also let it sit in the oven, after turning off, overnight.  I never opened the oven door the entire time.  Absolutely perfect, no cracking!  I also used spiked egg nog for an extra kick, it was exactly as I wanted it to turn out.

So easy, just follow the directions.  I used French Vanilla Pirouette wafers to line the outside edge. What a wonderfully smooth, rich taste this cheesecake has.  The Eggnog is a beautiful fit and very mild. Rich and wonderful!

This is my favorite cheesecake recipe, and not only that; I've adapted this slow-bake method to every cheesecake I make. Sure, it takes a lot of time, but every one I bake this way turns out super-creamy, and NEVER cracks. For the eggnog cheesecake, I like to cut a stencil of a holly and berries and stencil them on to the cheesecake using green and red colored sugar. Then grate some fresh nutmeg on top, and pipe some whipped cream around the edge. I also like to use vanilla wafers instead of graham crackers in the crust. Probably a good thing I can only make this recipe about three months out of the year, or I'd explode!

This was the creamiest cheesecake I have ever had.  It is a slow process, but it is worth it.  This is the first cheesecake I have successfully made without a crack in it!  I served it at Christmas and it got rave reviews from everyone...even the non-eggnog lovers!  Yum!

The best cheesecake I have ever made! Honestly well worth the time, and turns out super moist and full of flavor. I have made this for Thanksgiving as well as Christmas and everyone has commented on how it tasted professional and the most amazing cheesecake they have ever had! Seriously try this cheesecake out for a party or just a family event and you wont be sorry!! 

I also added a layer to the top of the finished cheesecake consisting of coolwhip mixed with cinnamon, which made the very creamy mixture that complimented the cheesecake very nicely!

Came out creamy without any cracks.  But flavor was too mild for my taste.  I tried to dress it up with a rum sauce and candied pecans but I don't plan on making this again.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  The cheesecake is moist, sweet, perfect texture.  I have made many New York Cheesecakes, this one is just as good!  Just a hint of eggnog taste. Worth the time.

I didn't care for this cheesecake- it was very blah and had very little flavor. I ended up throwing half of it away. I won't be making it again!

Good flavor and consistency. I agree with most posters that the time recommended isn't enough. I ended up doing an additional half-hour at 350 on top of the 3 hr at 200

Actually this was excellent if not for the fact it caved in and collapsed while being served.  Up until then it was fine.  Maybe if I used more flour.  I'm afraid to make again due to it ending up like a soup bowl.  If anyone has any suggestions please let me know :(  I did do a water bath using the method of a pan within a pan. Which is where you put the cheesecake pan in another pan which than goes into a pan of water in the oven.  I'm wondering if this is preventing it from cooking all the way through.  Any body have any ideas???  please.   The taste is supreme

One of the smoothest, creamiest cheesecakes I've ever made.  I was very skeptical about the cooking temperature, but followed exactly & it came out perfectly!  Highly recommend trying if your a cheesecake fan.

In a word?....WOW! I was tasked with the "main dessert" for Christmas Eve. No pressure, but I knew I wanted to make eggnog cheesecake (even though I'd never made one before).  So, I hunted for recipes and rolled the dice on this one. Needless to say, it paid off big time! Honestly, I don't usually take time to do reviews, but this recipe rocked and deserves accolades. I topped the cake with fresh whipped cream piped on the rim with dashes of nutmeg, then I popped on some fresh raspberries. HUGE HIT, and all Christmas Eve desserts will be measured against EC2014. (Eggnog cheesecake 2014) All I can say is that you have to be patient and honor the slow bake process. Yes....it takes about 4+ hours to bake, then 2-3 hours to cool off in the oven....then hours chilling in the fridge.  But the silky, tasty payoff is worth every tick-tock of the clock.

This was my very first cheesecake.  It looked good and was delicious.  To top it off, I made a brown sugar bourbon glaze. ...Suzanne

I made this with a graham cracker and gingersnap crust.  It was a hit.
