I modify this to make my own version of Wendy's Mandarin Chicken salad. I add chicken and a half cup of almonds, and omit the onion and olives. This is my favorite salad by far.

Very good! Didn't use olives or onions because I didn't have any.  I think I'd add onions next time if I had them, but not the olives.  It's great how we had it!  Added almonds.  Will definitely make this again.

Very good and quite easy.  I added some toasted pecans for crunch.  I rated it 4/5 instead of 5/5 only because I think the success of this recipe is almost entirely dependent on the quality of dressing you use.  If you have a balsamic vinaigrette that you love, then you'll probably love this recipe, but if you experiment and get a dressing you don't like, it won't matter how good everything else is.  Overall great salad, I'll definitely make it again!

Good salad.  My husband said it was one of the best salads he's ever had so of course it's 5 stars and a keeper for me!

This is our favorite salad recipe ever!!  We make it at least twice a week.  I'm always on the look out for a recipe that's as good as this, just to have some variety, but can't find any.  But where's the MUSTARD??  The recipe on the mandarin oranges can adds mustard as well.  Anyway...this recipe made mandarin oranges a staple in our house.

Believe it or not, this was good!  My boyfriend never tried raw spinach because he didn't think he would like it- he loved it!
I used green olives and they added a good flavor- next time I'll try black.  But the tart olives and vinaigrette mixed with bitter spinach and sweet oranges was wonderful.

Surprisingly EXCELLENT!  I have to admit, I typically stay away from recipes that are submitted by brand names.  However this one was great!  I did grill some salmon and laid on top of the salad.  I also added pecan pieces.  This would be an excellent meal to serve to guests when you are on a short notice.  Tres Bien!

Great salad. Wasn't sure whether to add green or black olives so I bumped up the picture size and saw that black olives were used. That's what I did. This is a great salad. I am very used to the mandarin orange/red onion/blue cheese kind of salad and was expecting it to taste like that. Wrong. It was totally different but equally as enjoyable. Went great with Campus Oaks Zinfindal, though you should really never drink any wine with salad because of the acid levels from dressings can change the taste of the wine dramatically. This was a great exception to the rule.

A fantastic salad that's easy to make and tastes "gourmet" compared to a typical iceberg or romaine lettuce salad.  I do not like olives so I exclude and I usually add cherry tomatoes and crushed walnuts.  I've made several times and always take the leftovers with me for lunch the next day!

Nice change of pace salad. I did what other reviewers did and added chicken and almonds. I used green olives instead of black because I dont like them. I absolutely love green olives in salads. Great recipe to make variations as seasons change. Will make again and add cherry tomatoes from the garden when they are ready.
