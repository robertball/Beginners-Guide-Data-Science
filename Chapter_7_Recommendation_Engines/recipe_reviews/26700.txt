Going to make this tomorrow!  Just a hint about dicing avacados...I saw a chef slice an unpeeled avacado in half length-wise, remove the pit, then use a sharp knife to slice the avacado (while UNPEELED) and removed the fruit from the skin by scooping it out with a rubber spatula.  It works like a charm!

Just like everyone else, I received raves and requests for this recipe. I accidentally added too many olives, but no one noticed. My suggestion is to use frozen WHITE corn as it is sweeter and has a nice crisp pop. And, I would add more avocado (the ones I used were too small) otherwise it looks more like a corn salsa instead of avocado salsa. Per other suggestions here, I added a minced jalapeno (take out seeds and veins if you don't like the heat), chopped cilantro and sliced green onion. It makes this recipe just perfect! Thanks a bunch, people!

I took the suggestion of making a wrap with this for an easy dinner. I grilled a couple of chicken breasts, sliced them up, and folded them into flour tortillas with about 2/3 cup of the salsa in each.  I also used, instead if the oregano, about 1/2 cup fresh chopped cilantro, and added in 1 tsp groung cumin. Very good.

Wonderful!! I have made this twice, the second time using fresh chopped cilantro in place of the oregano.  Both got rave reviews by everyone.  Personally, I preferd the cilantro over the oregano, it gave the salsa a fresher taste.  Also added more salt as others suggested and a little finely chopped serrano pepper to spice it up just a bit.  Add some grilled chicken to leftovers for a great wrap.

A lot of reviewers rated this recipe high but with some pretty big modifications.  I made it as written and I didn't like it very much.  I thought the balance of ingredients was off (too much corn for the amount of avocado) and the oregano just wasn't right for it.  I would definitely follow the advice of others and use cilantro instead.  I also think the addition of tomato and black beans might make it tastier.  Green onions would probably be a nice substitue for the regular onion.  I recommend the recipe called Black Bean And Corn Salad II on this site.  I found it much better.

Absolutely delicious! This tastes wonderfully fresh and light. I added a can of rinsed black beans and 2 chopped Roma tomatoes as well. I used Kalamata olives in red wine vinegar and 1/2 of a small red onion and left out the red pepper. I also substituted fresh lime juice for the lemon because I like lime with avocado.

Excellent salsa. I have made this at least 10 or 12 times in the last 1-1/2 years and it is still a big hit. We are having a Cinco de Mayo lunch at work on 5-5-03 and all of the women in the department are begging me to bring it already. I use cilantro in place of the oregano and before I bring it to work I dice the avocado and mix in about 6 hours before lunch. The mixture does marinate overnight however. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

I loved this recipe, I did take out the corn and olives--my boys don't like them--and it was just great.  Everyone who had this loved it and I was proud to serve it.

I love this! I add cilantro as well as the oregano, and it is definitely spice-up-able with green chiles or jalapenos. A friend of mine loves it so much, he brings over all the ingredients occasionally as well as a bottle of wine, so I will make this for him. Of course I could give him the recipe, since it's simple enough for even a super-mega-bachelor, but, come on--he pays me with wine!

I took this to a small dinner party (7 adults) thinking that there would be WAY too much for the crowd, but there was hardly any left over at the end of the evening.  Received great reviews!

This was so yummy!  We had friends over and everyone really liked it; it's addictive!  I will be keeping this as a favorite to make for parties.  The recipe makes quite a bit, so reduce the size if you are just making it for your family.

I have made this recipe three times already and always get compliments! Someone told me it was the bomb.com haha. I like to add a can of black beans and also tomatoes for that red pop of color! Also I used the Fiesta Canned Corn that already has the red/green bell peppers integrated into it! I have used this salsa with chips and also with my tacos. Absolutely delectable :)

I brought this to an appetizer party, and out of everything, it was the first to go.  It is delicious-everybody raved about it-and insist I bring it with me to every gathering.  I found it was rather easy, I made it the night before, and simply cut the avacados when I arrived at the party.  A must try!

Everyone loved it!  I was impressed myself!
 A few changes:
Instead of cider vinegar I used red wine vinegar!
Instead of oregano I used cilentro, lots more then a teaspoon!
I squeezed some lime juice in before i served it!
And i did not use olives, not a fan!  
I will be making this for every bbq!!

This is my summertime appetizer.  I bring it to so many parties and everyone raves about it.  The only change I made was I use canned corn rather than frozen.

Excellent.  So many people asked for the receipe.  It is such a change from other appetizers.  I did find the amount of avocado could vary according to their size.  It was hands down WONDERFUL!

Love, Love Love this! Even my young niece and nephews can't get enough of this yummy salsa.  It's easy to make and I'm always asked to bring it to summer parties.  I serve it with Scoops nacho chips.

This is so good. I took it to bunco last night where it went over well. I'm always telling them i'm not a great cook but i get great recipes from this site. I added fresh cilantro and a seeded and choppped jalepeno. Very good and great to eat just as a salad.

Excellent! It seemed like it made a LOT, but I didn't have much left after serving to a family gathering (12 adults). AND three people asked for the recipe. This was easy to make and delish!

This is delicious! I made it as a snack with tortilla chips for movie night. The leftovers actually kept well in the fridge overnight, so I used the remainder in  grilled chicken wraps the next day.

I scaled the recipe down to 8 servings and made it nearly as directed except used dried cilantro (instead of oregano) and some cumin.  We LOVED it!  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! I made a smaller portion and added tomatoes. I wasn't patient enough to let it chill for 8 hours and ate it right away and it was still good. Will make this one again! Next time I will add cilantro in place of the oregano and jalapeno peppers.

Are you kidding me? I think this is the BEST food I've ever put in my mouth. I adore kalamata olives so adding them to this recipe brought me joy! I left out the corn because I don't really like it and the red pepper because I didn't have one. Instead of cider vinegar, I used balsamic. Hooooooolllly Cow! Delicious! Thank You!

This recipe is wonderful. My husband requests it all the time. I took it to a party and several people asked for the recipe. It tastes great and the colors make a wonderful presentation. The only change I made was that I used cilantro instead of oregano and I left out the olives.

I thought this was very good, but next time will reduce the garlic some what and you can get away with 3 good size avacados and a can of corn.  Also, recommend adding jalapeno and cilantro to the mix.  Mine came out great.

Delicious and very easy. I used my food processor to chop the onion, garlic, and red pepper -- which got them down to a nice small shape. This was the 'hit' of my SuperBowl party this year.

though i am not the biggest avacado fan, i had a couple of avacados lying around and decided to make this up for my co-workers. according to one of them it was "the best thing [he'd] ever tasted in his life".. so i would say it went over very well. only problem now is that they want me to make and bring in more food!

Outstanding. I did doctor it a bit as per other reviewer's suggestions. I omitted the oregano and went with fresh cilantro, a few more cloves of garlic and most of a 375 ml. can of sliced black olives,  added a cup of black beans, a jalapeno,  2 diced roma tomatoes and an extra avocado.  Bloody fabulous. :)

So good! I love this recipe. Made it exactly as written minus the olives. The kick was strong without being overpowering. I added the salsa to my salad and it was delish. The next day I mixed with pasta, also amazing. Will be adding this to my favorites.

Love this!!  We do like to make it mexican style by substituting cilantro, black beans, and jalapenos for the oregano, olives, and red peppers.  Delicious on an omelette.  Thanks so much for a really terrific recipe!

This was a great recipe.  I will cut back slightly on the oil next time because it was a little too oily for me.  If you love avocados like I do, then you must try this recipe.

To quote my 13 year old daugher, "Oh my gosh Mom, rate this as many stars as you can.  It was GOOD!"  I did think it needed a touch more salt, but I like a lot of salt in most things. The amount of avocado in this recipe was a BIG hit!!!

Everybody who has tasted this salsa says it is wonderful.  I serve it as a salad with fish.  It doesn't get a 5 on "really" easy because avocados are difficult to dice but this unique recipe is well worth it.

This is an outstanding recipe!  I altered slightly, but only by using half the oil and corn, I used red onion and adding two tomatoes  This will definitely continue to be a go to salsa recipe for me.

Excellent and healthy!!  I used a 15 ounce can of olives because I love them and just used canned corn as well (rinsed them both to rid some salt).  I used regular vinegar since I didn't have cider.  Ate this over a couple days as a wrap.  So good.

LOVE this recipe!  It's fabulous!  It was a hit at my family party.  I ended up giving the recipe to my mom, sister and sister in law!  I might try adding a can of drained black beans next time, and see how that turns out.

Got great reactions to this at work!  I halved the recipe and used only 1 1/2 cloves of garlic and still kept the vampires away all day.  Also added a roasted jalapeno and used lime instead of lemon since that's all I had.  So glad I was lazy to go to the store and added oregano as the recipe stated instead of fresh cilantro.  Ate this with my leftover beef barley soup (also from this website) - oh yum!

This recipe was as close as I could find to a replica a friend made. This salsa is best with some sweetness. Add a 1/4 cup of sugar and use a tablesoon less vinegar. Next time I will try it with red onions and cilantro. Serve with a hint of lime chips. Yum!!

I forgot to make this ahead of time, but people went crazy for it anyway.   I put the onions and red peppers in my food processor for a few seconds, then added the olives, garlic and a handful of cilantro and processed until it was finely chopped.  It was super easy to make this way.

This is a great salsa!  I omitted the black olives and used 2 cans of drained, rinsed black beans instead.  I also used a jar of chopped, roasted sweet red peppers instead of fresh.  This salsa was a HIT with my guests!

Oh... my... So good!  I did add a minced fresh jalepeno, and used only 3 good size cloves of garlic and less oil (light olive oil).  After mixing the dressing, I wasn't sure I was going to make through the marination period it smelled so good.  Definitely recommend.

Salsa had a nice flavor. I used canned corn and left out the olives. I also substituted cilantro for the oregano. Very colorful. Next time I might add in some diced tomatoes too.

Good but not great, missed the mark as far as top notch flavor for us. I tasted it and had to spice it up some more. Did like it afterwards and will use it again.

Absolutely delicious! I love the marinated veggies with the freshness of the avocado.  I'm not a huge olive fan so I substituted 1/2 a can of black beans for the 2nd can of olives. Letting the salsa marinate is key!

A friend sent me the link to this recipe.  It just so happened I needed an appetizer for a get together I was going to, so I made this.  WOW!  It was a big hit, everyone wanted the recipe.  Great fresh taste, good enough to just eat by itself...forget the chips and use as a little side salad..or top your burger, chicken, wrap or use your imagination.  I did use chopped fresh cilantro instead of the oregano.  Just a personal preference as I'm a huge fan of cilantro.  You can't go wrong with this one!

Everyone raves about this recipe when I make it and I get lots of requests for the recipe.  The only change I make is to add a can of rinsed black beans and I add lots of cilantro.  So Yummy!

What a great salsa. I think I will try half of the lemon juice and half lime for a stronger citrus flavor. Wonderful summer recipe that is light and tasty!

I've taken this recipe to gatherings twice, and it's always a big hit!

I make the following adjustments:

Substitute 1/3 c. fresh cilantro chopped for the oregano

Add one serrano pepper

Add 1 t. cumin

Add a full t. of salt

Fantastic!

This is one of the freshest "summery" salsas I've ever made!  My family finished it off in no time and asked for it again the following weekend!  I've traded out 1/2 the red bell pepper for 1/2 of an orange one for more of a festive look, and it's still great.

SUPER GOOD AND FANCY! I made it for Thankgiving to eat before dinner, everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. Like others suggested I used 2/3 can drained canned corn, cilantro instead of oregno, and half the olives. Watch the serving count-I made way too much (32 servings) but not a drop wasted :)

Yum! I used one can of corn, no olives, half a can of black beans, a healthy dash of cumin, and just a dash of salt. You definitely need to let it marinate in the fridge for a little while...but the wait is worth it!

Just awesome! I sliced up cherry tomatoes in place of the red pepper, added some fresh lime juice and also used fresh cilantro in place of oregano. The second time I made it I let it marinate for a full 24 hours and it brought the flavors out even more. My family just raves about this one!

An appetizing and colorful recipe, and a great alternative to regular tomato-based salsas! I made a lot of the suggested adjustments to this salsa (added diced tomatoes, subbed drained black beans for olives, subbed cilantro for oregano, lime juice for lemon [it was all I had]) and it was quite good. The guy loved it w/ tortilla chips. Oh, except for the fact that it made my fridge smell like a million onions had rained down on it. I'll use less of those next time.

I made this for an Easter picnic and it was a SMASH hit!  I personally thought it could have used a little less olive oil.  Also, since I don't do red bell pepper, I chopped roma tomato for the red element.  The stuff was gone quick!  The prep time was well worth the rave reviews I got.

I love this avocado salsa.  It is tangy, refreshing and provides an interesting melange of flavours and textures.  The avocado is the binding element of the recipe.  It seems to balance the tanginess from the other ingredients and provides a counter smoothness to the salsa. Great party food.

Excellent dish. I made this recipe three times so far and every time it is just delicious. I use double the amount of black olives because I love them. I also buy whole olives & slice them myself (they taste better this way). The raw onion can be a bit overpowering, in my opinion, so i use less than the recipe says. I also chop the onion very small.

Really delicious! I used canned, organic corn, and added chopped, organic chives and organic cilantro instead of the garlic and onions. I also added a chopped, fresh jalapeno and a chopped serrano pepper. I also added half of a squeezed lime. I also served 2% fat Greek yogurt with it, on the side, and dolloped on top of the tortilla chips loaded with the salsa! It was a big hit, and very easy to prepare! Recommend highly!

Made half a recipe and my husband and I killed the entire batch!  Used green olives and only had one avocado so I added some black beans to boost the protein.  Also omitted the vinegar by mistake and was AWESOME.  Serve with a yummy margarita for a low key Friday night EASY dinner.

So good - I made this for my cousin and husband, they really enjoyed it as did I.  I did have to add more salt and pepper and I omitted the olives.  Not a big olive fan.  This was very tasty.

I made this for a starter at thanksgiving and it got several rave reviews!!  I did use half the amount of corn it called for and used fresh cilantro inplace of the oregeno and added a couple extra avacados (my family loves avacados!)  But again... Great recipe!!  I definately will be using it again!

I love this recipe, although, I do add a dash or two of hot sauce to kick it up a bit.   I also add a can of black beans and a little more salt.  This recipe makes a huge bowl and I've never had leftovers!

This was awesome and super easy to make. My avocados weren't ready but I'd already mixed up the rest so the rest of the mix sat in the fridge for a few days and it made the flavors blend together really nicely. I cut out the olives because my husband doesn't like them, but I'd love to try them with the olives in it. Also, I think I may have added too much onion, bc my husband and I were tasting it for hours afterwards, but overall this was fantastic and I will definitely make this again.

OH YUM!  I wondered about this at first, but decided to try it out to take to a Tripoly party.  I'm so glad I did!  I scaled it back to 24 servings since I only had 3 avocadoes.  I let all the ingredients, minus the avocado, marinate all day.  The veggies soaked up a lot of the juice, so I added about 1/4 of the total of juice again, and it made it just right.  It also seemed to be missing something, and the oregano flavor had toned down considerably since first mixing the juice, so I added about 1 Tbsp of ground cumin and that made it perfect!  There was about half left after the party and my husband and I were so glad because we got to finish it at home!  This is going to be my new "potluck" recipe - so easy and tasty!  Oh, and I used one can of corn instead of frozen, and it was fine.

I made this for an Easter brunch.  I accidently bought chopped black olives instead of sliced and used fresh cilantro instead of oregano.  Otherwise kept everything else the same.  It was the ultimate hit!  Everyone just parked themselves around the bowl and did not get up until it was all gone.  Everyone wanted the recipe!  Thank you for such a great recipe!

I followed the recipe with one minor change(used canned corn) and one addition (Jalapeno's!)  Everyone loved it on Cinco de Mayo and requested the recipe.  I will be making this for all my summer functions!

I love this recipe! I have made it several times for family/friend parties and it is always a big hit. A few modifications that I make:

1. Use 1 can of corn instead of frozen
2. 2 avocados seem to be plenty
3. I leave out the peppers because I am not a big fan
4. My husband does not like olives, so I buy them whole and just slice them in half so he can get around them.

Thank you Barbara for a great recipe!

flavorful & fresh tasting - suggest using cilantro rather than oregano - great as a side salad also.

I love this salsa - I don't even need the tortilla chips.  We eat it with a bowl and spoon.  I do make a few changes.  I use a little less salt and add 1-2 Tbsps lime juice with the lemon juice.  I also use 2 cans of corn instead of frozen corn.

I love avocados so this recipe was a natural for me.  Per previous reviews, I reduced the amount of oil to 1/4 cup and leaned toward making it more 
"Southwestern."  I used tomatoes instead of red pepper, seasoned salt instead of plain, some diced jalapenos and chopped cilantro instead of oregano, plus a small can of green chiles. I like also using more avocado, probably 6 minimum!  People always ask for the recipe, thanks for sharing it.

This was a very chunky salsa, so I added about a 1/2 c of italian dressing with the avacados.  Everyone at our little Superbowl party really liked it.

Everybody who tries this salsa asks for the recipe.  The only changes I make are to omit the red pepper and substitute chopped roma tomatoes.  I also chop bottled jalapeno slices and add a little of the juice.  Great recipe!

My entire family loved this recipe.  I made a few substitutions to cater to my husband's and my tastes.  I omitted the olives, red pepper, and oregano, and added tomato, a can of pinto beans, and fresh cilantro.  It was very good.

Watch out!  This stuff is dangerous!  I ate it ALL in one sitting...by myself...with tortilla 
chips. I think it's best when the avocados are soft enough to mash.

This was not that great, maybe I was expecting more of a Mexican type flavor .  I added Ro-Tel tomatoes to give it some spice.  Would I make this again...probably not.

This is the first "all recipes" recipe I have tried and it was good pickins!  I made the salsa to serve with tortillas, but also with fresh prawns.  The flavours work perfectly together!  I also added some serrano chile to add some kick. Leftover plans include adding some chicken and rolling it up in a tortilla. Awesome!

This salsa was a hit at the 2003 Super Bowl party we attended.  4 of 5 couples there asked for the recipe and asked to take some of it home. It makes a colorful statement and tastes heavenly!

This is such an excellent recipe for adding or substituting different ingredients.  I didn't have cider vinegar or oregano so I used red wine vinegar and cumin instead. I also added a can of black beans to give it some protein. Delicious.

First time and it was yum.  I don't like the strong flavor of onions so I rinsed my chopped onions and then added to the dish.  I would make this again.  Thank you for sharing.

This is everyone's favorite dip. I traded oregano and lemon juice for cilantro and lime juice. I also added a can of black beans, a couple roma tomatoes, and a jalepeno. I also omitted the bell pepper.

I have made this several times and it always goes over well.  I substitute 2 diced roma tomatoes (seeds removed) for the bell pepper and white vinegar for the cider vinegar (never have cider on hand).  I also add fresh, chopped cilantro leaves to taste and 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of ground cumin.  I made this yesterday and didn't have oregano.  Italian seasoning worked just as well!  I serve it with large tortilla scoop chips.

I used avocado oil, fresh chopped cilantro, fresh red basil (also know as spicy basil vs sweet basil) with the lemon juice and cider vinegar for the base dressing.  I also  added a can of black beans and a can of red kidney beans.  I recommend mixing in the avocados a few minutes before you serve it.  Makes an excellent side salad, or can be used with tortillas to make a vegetarian wrap.

Absolutely delicious and we couldn't let it chill because it was all gone within 20 minutes! Used regular vinegar, added cilantro and lime, and left out the olives and olive oil. My husband couldn't get enough of it (:

I made this recipe using lime juice instead of lemon.  Also I used fresh cilantro instead of oregano and added a teaspoon of cumin.  Add the avacados just before serving.  It was a big hit at my work place. A few of my co-workers wanted the recipe.  I will make this again.

This is a fantastic recipe.  Every gathering my family requests this, even those who don't like avocados eat this. I only omit the olives as some of the family members don't like them. We have added a few chopped jalapenos and a can of black beans.  It is great on any meat, poultry or fish. Great for any gathering. Wonderfully delicious!

This is so very very good.  I have made this numerous times since I found the recipe.  Everyone loves it and I am asked for the recipe constantly.  I make the night before and add the avocados right before serving.  Taking it to a party this weekend!  Thanks, Barbara!

We loved this!  I added an extra splash or two of lemon juice and salted to taste.  I made this as a starter before enchiladas and it was so refreshing we kept going back for more throughout the meal.  I'd suggest chopping the onion into small pieces so you avoid biting into a large chunk which can be unpleasant.

This was really great salsa.. it was gone right away. The only thing I would caution people about is to use barely under-ripe avocadoes. If you use the nice soft ones, this dish will go to mush right away. The avocado I used, because it was still firm-ish (not rock hard though! ew!) maintained it's integrity and was a great addition. I wound up cutting this recipe in half for a group of 4 dedicated salsa/guacamole eaters. Thanks so much!

I thought this was more like a relish than a salsa...
It was good and we ate it, but I probably won't make it again.  It tasted better on quesadillas than tacos.

I thought this was really good, but not many people ate it.  I made it for Superbowl and there was a lot of other foods, so I think that might be why.  I used tomatos instead of bell pepper and cilantro instead of oregano like others suggested.  I also cut the oil and it was plenty.  It had a nice flavor and was very appealing to the eye.  The only problem I had was the avacados were too mushy and as the night went on, it started to look like chunky guacamole.  I will buy much less ripe avacado's next time and use while they are still green.

Really good.  Makes a huge bowlful, but it was devoured.  Everyone parked around the bowl and pretty much inhaled it.  I also used roasted red bell pepper instead of raw, red onion, subbed olives w/black beans and used cilantro w/a little oregano.  Served with tortilla chips.

I made a double batch of this salsa for our company office party and there wasn't one morsel left and I ended up giving out 21 copies of this recipe!  It was a definite hit!  Since then I have made it for get togethers with friends but cut the recipe in half and it was plenty of food.

This tasted okay, but didn't look so great.  Not many people trid it.  My husband liked it, and ended up eating it all himself.  I added Roma tomatoes, cilantro instead of oregano, reduced garlic from 5 to 4 (still very garlicy), cut back oil and added a chopped jalepeno.

Sooo great after I added more salt.  I also have made this with some tobasco to kick it up a notch.  Sometimes I will also add some lime juice if I have it.  Everytime I've made the crowds go wild!

This salsa is where I first discovered I like avacodos!  Very good.  Needs more salt.  Also if you have leftovers the avacodos tend to deteriorate to solve this problem...  make sure you don't leave any leftovers!!!

Made this for a party and have made it several times since.  I love it and so did they.  I made no changes.  My family wouldn't eat it as it has avacado but I bring it to parties whenever I can and it disappears.

For a mild, refreshing take on salsa, this was good.  I believe the addition of some chopped jalapeno and cilantro would bring this recipe to five stars for me personally.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I made a lot of changes just based on the ingred I had on hand.  I used fresh corn on the cob that I cooked in husk in microwave for 2 min.  I left out olives because we don't like them.  I also left out the oregano because we do not like it.  This was super easy and everyone loved it.

I about doubled the vinegar and added lime juice as well as lemon juice. I have a reaction to avocados and the acid helps lessen that reaction. I also use frozen corn and bell peppers and onions, so I mix everything together and then microwave it for ten seconds at a time, stirring in between microwaving. That melts the frozen things and helps the ingredients marry without having to wait hours. Because by the time I smell it, I’m late for eating it. 10/10 do recommend, SO SO GOOD.

This was a delicious recipe! I did make a few tweaks though. I didn't use olives because I thought they would be too overpowering. I added 2 cans of black beans and one medium tomato. I also thought it was a little bland (Probably because I added all those black beans) so I used a whole lemon, an extra tbsp of vinegar, 1/4 extra tsp oregano, and 1 tsp cilantro.

If you have leftovers, just make some white rice and grilled chicken and add your leftovers to the rice for a delicious Santa Fe bowl. Or wrap them up in tortillas! Yum!

Idk what this is, honestly. Authentic Mexican salsa doesn't have olive oil in it. I was shocked at the lack of flavor in this even as there are tons of five star reviews (what drew me to the recipe in the first place). I was misled because many of these reviewers raved about how amazing this recipe was, yet they added a ton of ingredients. If this is the case, then this is not a good recipe by itself. I myself instinctually threw in a 1/4 cup of cilantro, 1 tbsp of cumin, and 1 tbsp of cayenne pepper because from the list of ingredients I knew it wouldn't be spicy...which is the whole point of salsa. This seems to be yet another overhyped wipipo recipe ??

Absolutely love this recipe! As some have mentioned, it takes some time to chop and put together, as well as doing it the day before, but it’s worth it. It makes a lot, too,  so great for a party.

Made it for my vegan and vegetarian children for our family Christmas gathering. Such a refreshing,  bright dish. I served it as a salad, not as a dip. Everyone , vegan/ vegetarian and not, LOVED!

This is one of the best appetizers ever!  Even people who dont like avocados like this.  Its fresh and light and delicious with chips, as a salsa on tacos, or just with a spoon!  I give it 5 stars as is.  I will note that I have made several variations.  I've used one can of black beans and one can of olives, tomatoes instead of red peppers, or combinations of all of the above.  My favorite is using lime juice and fresh cilantro instead of lemon juice and dried oregano, but you can't go wrong with this recipe!

I made this to go with chipotle turkey burgers and it was so refreshing and tasty!  I added a smal chopped tomato for color because I didn't have red pepper.  I used a light green pepper instead.

I added a rinsed can of black beans, instead of frozen corn I grilled 3 fresh corn and cut of the cobb.  I only used 1 can of black olives.  I used 1/2 green, yellow & red peppers.  Red & green onions and a cup of Cilantro.  It was so colorful and delicious!  Added Avocado before serving.  My son recommended next time to add Feta cheese!

It's nice to have a variety for avocado salad.  Modified the recipe  using quinoa instead of corn and added sliced tomatoes. Exchanging the oregano for cilantro would be nice. Overall, it was a good salad. I used it for topping on my beef soft taco and it was delicious.

I love this recipe. I am on a low sodium diet so I do leave the salt out. It is the perfect mixture to pour over any of the vegetables you love. I have even added low sodium black beans.

I made this just like it says to. It was outstanding!  I had company coming for the weekend so I whipped it up the day before.  We put it on scrabble eggs, chicken  tacos and chips. My son liked it so much he asked for a spoon to eat the whole bowl! Lol!  I will be making this again.

I added some fritos, and that really upped the appeal. I followed other readers' advice and subbed cilantro for oregano. I also chopped up some roasted red red peppers from a jar since I didn't have any fresh ones, and they were added a little smoky flavor. Yum!

I've made this recipe several times now and it always gets rave reviews.  Usually I make it as written with just one substitution -- I use chopped fresh cilantro in place of the oregano (about 2-3 tablespoons).  I've also made it omitting the olives and adding an extra avocado -- for my son who does not like black olives.  It was delicious.  I've found that it's just as good after marinating for just a few hours.

My two youngest (7 & 9) and I whipped this up in no time.  They even ate it.  Fantastic flavor, super easy to make, and as made, it's kid friendly (meaning NOT spicy).  We dug into it right away, but I know the overnight time will make the flavors even more yummy. This is a must make.

Left out the olives (don't like them) and used red onion.  Used Lime juice instead of lemon as I typically like lime in my guacamole better.  Tis was outstanding!  We had it just about 3 hours after I made it.  I added the avocado in the beginning and may do the same but if letting sitting overnight- may as well add them in them later.  We had this with tortilla chips- the new artisan black bean kind is great- but this would also be really good as a burger topping or just a salad.  Also tried without the corn and it's still good!  Usually add a bunch of fresh cilantro.

This stuff is GREAT! I actually made it as a salad when I had company and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. It is really important to let it marinate in the juices or else it just won't be right.

Great recipe!  I didn't have cider vinegar so used balsamic instead and some of the guests have issues with raw peppers onions and garlic so I roasted all of them in a little olive oil and salt and pepper before adding them to the recipe.  The flavors were great together though the recipe without these changes would have been more visually appealing.  Very tasty!  Thanks very much for sharing!

This was a big hit in my house.  I've had a few requests for the recipe.  If you love avocados and are looking for a twist on salsa, this will not disappoint.

This was good.  Made for a dinner party and it was well received.  Only thing I would say is that it wasn't terribly "juciy", but tasted great.

I've made this recipe twice now, exactly as the recipe is written. People loved it and two people have asked me for the recipe. One of these people doesn't like avocados and the other runs a catering service. Need I say more?

Absolutely loved this recipe!  Great in a chicken wrap, with chips or just by itself.  Added bacon, cilantro rather than oregano and lime instead of lemon with 1/2 t. Cumin.

This salsa is one of the most delicious things I have ever fixed and eaten.  I've been asked for this recipe by several people.  Nice because it's a little different and the presentation is perfect because of all the different colors.

I was really pumped to try this recipe. I wanted something that used a lot of avocado as I had a surplus and recently discovered that my son loves them. I modified the recipe with the cilantro and jalapeno as reviews suggested. I also used lime as opposed to lemon. My only mistake was tossing an entire lime (skin and all) in my Ninja blender. We could taste the rind. I till wouldn't make this again though. I gave some away and eaten on lime tortilla chips the rest will get finished up. My daughter though it was very good on her baked potato. In short it is a salsa so I wouldn't expect to eat it as a salad. I like the concept and will try something similar until I find something that everyone at MY house can rave about. I did use the rest of my avocados to make Avocado Ice cream with was amazing. It's now my new favorite. Everyone was amazed at the taste of the ice cream so I will look for a recipe here or write one myself.

I made this today and it is SO good! (Used about a tablespoon of chopped fresh cilantro instead of oregano like others suggested).  I'm entering it in our annual salsa contest tomorrow at the school where I work.  Tastes like a winner to me!

Made this for a snack for the family this evening. Was very easy to prepare, had all the ingredients on hand, but we felt it needed a bit more of a zing in terms of flavor so I added more cider vinegar,garlic, lemon juice, oregano and salt. Will definitely make it again. Very colorful and can be used as an appetizer, side salad,or snack with tortillas or any cracker.

I made this last night, taste good. However, I'm a bit confused as the picture posted with this recipe shows tomatoes in the dish yet there is no mention of this in the ingredient list. I guess I'll try adding that next time - it will surely change the taste.

I made this for a party and everyone LOVED it and asked for the recipe.   Just make sure to give the sales time to sit and absorb the flavors.  Yum. And thank you for the recipe.  I used trader Joe's fire roasted corn cuz that's what I had on hand.
