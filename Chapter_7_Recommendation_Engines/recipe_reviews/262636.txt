It was easy to make and came out the way you’d hope it look. Taste was a little lacking for me so I would add more cinnamon and probably a bit of honey for sweetness. I make again with some modifications.

Easy to make recipe. Just like making muffins. Not too sweet. Will definitely make these again. Didn’t last long enough to freeze. But I’m sure they would freeze well.

This is a fantastic option to have in the freezer for a quick breakfast and my toddler loves them.  I've made it a couple times and at least double the quantities to freeze them. I used a whole egg instead of just the whites. I also mixed in chopped apple instead of putting it on top. I made one batch with cupcake wrappers- terrible idea.

Second time around was a charm. Used the recommended oats (first time I grabbed what was in my pantry!), plus added raisins & a little extra brown sugar. I also let the mixture sit over night in the baking pan, prior to baking the next AM. Delic!!
