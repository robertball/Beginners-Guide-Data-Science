I love recipes like this that people think they will hate but end up raving about. Who would think things like cabbage, pineapple, cherry yogurt and Dijon would go together so perfectly? This salad is great! It's light but still filling. It's great with grilled meat, fish or chicken but it's complex enough to have on it's own.  Try it!

Fantastic Recipe! Wonderful flavour and beautiful mix of colors! I followed the recipe exactly, my husband said it was his favorite salad. I served it  with the key west chicken from this site.

I hate to say this but, I really did not care for this! Thought maybe it was just me so i had my daughter taste it ( she usually likes different things) her reaction was the same.  Its easy enough to make so I dont think i messed it up, it just was not a winner at our house..... I would rate a zero if possible
