Easy, wonderful soup! I added another zucchini to mine, and used fat-free milk. Thanks for the recipe!

Great chowder--though I sauteed the onions, celery and garlic in butter first, then added heavy whipping cream instead of evaporated milk.  I also used sweet white corn instead of creamed corn and seasoned the chowder with a bit of thyme, cayenne pepper and fresh cracked pepper.

I've made this a lot over the past few years.  It's great!  A few times, when I wanted a little bit more thickness, I made a roux with butter and flour, then added milk and cooked until thick and added it to the chikcken broth/veggie mixture.  It was a lot more thick and hearty this way and more delicious!  I've even used skim milk.  I've made it with fresh and canned salmon, both ways are good.  I buy the cans of boneless salmon, that way I don't have to deal with the bones.  I usually leave out the zucchini.

Very good!  I used fresh salmon which I steamed while I chopped the vegetables.  Then I melted a couple of tablespoons of butter with a touch of oil in a dutch oven and added the garlic (2)and spices and stirred for a couple of minutes and then sauteed the chopped up vegetables.  I removed the skin and bones from the salmon and then cooked all the bones and skin in the steaming water for a few more minutes.  I drained this and dissolved a chicken bouillon in the water and then added it to the vegetables.  I thought the seasoned salt was essential and I added a half teaspoon of salt and a pinch of cayenne.  Very simple recipe.  Really delicious.

Not only delicious but the colors made this chowder really special. I took the advise of previous reviewers and cut back on the creamed corn, also only used about half of the canned milk and used regular milk for the remaining. It was plenty rich enough. Great flavor and texture! This one goes to the top of my favorite list!!

Yum!  Great recipe.  This was very easy.  I used salmon that comes in a pouch (it is skinless & boneless).  I used 2 pouches.  I also used non-fat evaporated milk.  I omitted the zucchini and used red bell pepper instead of green.  I estimate this recipe to be 4.5 points on the Weight Watchers plan.  Great taste for such low fat!!

I didn't have any potatoes handy so I put in mashed potato flakes at the end of cooking...it worked well.  I opted for celery salt since I had no celery on hand, either.  Not bad!

I thought the creamed corn was pretty overpowering.  Perhaps with more milk or a flour thickener and frozen corn it would be better.  Removing the bones from the canned salmon I used was a nightmare.  If I make it again I'll use frozen corn and fresh salmon.

UPDATE: Tried it again, with fresh salmon and frozen corn--sauteed the salmon for a minute on each side and let it cook the rest of the way in the chowder, added a teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning and ended up with a fantastic soup.  Better than any fish chowder I've had in a restaurant.

This was AWESOME!  I made it after church one Sunday and it was very tasty, filling and kept for great leftovers.  I recommend using the fresh salmon if you have the time to prepare it, the canned is good (I have made it both ways) but the fresh is better.  THANKS!!

Very good. I used skim milk instead of canned since that is what I had on hand. I would like to try with whole corn instead of creamed next time just to see which is better.

THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  I MADE IT SPECIFICALLY FOR MY BROTHER, WHO HAD JUST RETURNED HOME FROM HAVING BY-PASS SURGERY.  I USED THE LOW SALT METHOD AND HE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT.  THEN I MADE IT A WEEK LATER FOR MY HUSBAND AND I WITH THE ORIGINAL INGREDIENTS INCLUDING THE CHICKEN BROTH THAT HAD MORE SALT IN IT.  BOTH TIMES IT WAS A HIT.  IT'S A MEAL ALL BY ITSELF.  I SERVE CHALLAH BREAD WITH IT AND THAT IS ALL THAT IS NEEDED.  GREAT DISH.

This soup is WONDERFUL!!! We practice low fat and sugar so I altered it slightly, like using fat free condensed milk and eliminating the potatoes (I couldn't give up the corn, tho). It's sweet and creamy.... mmmmmmm! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very hearty chowder and smells wonderful while cooking. Only thing was that it was a little too sweet for my taste so next time I will use regular corn or use something less sweet than the evaporated milk. I added Tabasco and it made it taste much better. Also, you can substitute with any vegetables you have on hand.

We really liked this recipe.  It hit the spot on a cold winter night after being out all day.  You really don't taste the salmon as much as I thought you would.  Next time I'll try using fresh flaked baked salmon to see if there is a difference than the canned.  It is tasty!

It looked great and smelled great but it was kinda bland..I did sautee the celery, peppers, and onions in butter before adding the broth.  What really helped alot was adding dry red chili pepper flakes.  I would make it again.

Wow!  I added mushrooms and red peppers and 2% milk.  I also used 2 packets of salmon so I didn't have to bother with picking out the bones. The soup was amazing.  My husband said it was better than any 5 star restaurants' soup.  We had this soup 2 nights in a row and it was even better the second night.  I served it with corn bread and a strawberry, kiwi, spinach salad (recipe on this site).  The whole meal looked so elegant and it was so easy.  Next time I will add fresh scallops with the salmon.

Boy, this is delicious chowder.  I did make a few changes based on what was in the house and other reviewers comments.  Frozen corn, no zucchini, thyme instead of dill (I am not fond of dill), whole milk, a dash of hot pepper, and a half teaspoon of old bay seasoning along with the seasoned salt. This is one of the easiest soups I have ever made and my husband and I loved it.

I made the soup as directed except instead of using already cooked or canned salmon I put raw fresh salmon into the soup and let it simmer until cooked.  It gave it a super rich flavor that my husband and I totally loved. The creamed corn sweetens and thickens this chowder so you can use 2% milk to help cut some of the fat.  EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Terrific. A great way to get really healthful food into the family's diet. I served it with fresh multigrain rolls and it was a hit, even with my choosey three year old.  I'm not a dill fan so I substituted a teaspoon of 'Mrs. Dash' and made it with one can of salmon and one grilled salmon steak which I grilled while the veggies were cooking.

This was a delicious chowder.  I used reduced-sodium chicken broth, reduced the amount of seasoned salt & dill (not a big fan of dill, but the whole amount probably would have been fine; couldn't taste it).  Steamed some sockeye salmon I had thawed, and also used one can of deboned, skinless salmon; tossed in about 1/2c corn leftover from a cornbread recipe.  Like reviewer, What a Dish!, I made a roux of butter & flour and added it to the broth to thicken and flavor it a bit.  Also added a splash of sherry which was a really nice touch and I'd do again.  Served with cornbread and broccoli rabe.

Very Good!
Substituted red pepper for green pepper and I thought it was a little to thick at first so I added a little more broth than the recipe called for. But it turned out wonderful I thought since this was my first time making chowder. Goes really well with ritz wheat crakers and crushed coriander seed.

This soup is so delicious, so easy and so versatile.  I've made it now for the past three Fridays and haven't once had any leftovers.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time, doubled it the second, and used half-n-half instead of evaporated milk the third time around.  My children like it, and my husband has had seconds each time despite not typically liking salmon.

I'm not sure what the exact taste was that I didn't like.  I'm guessing that the evaporated milk may have given it some kind of sweetness that wasn't my cup of tea.  I also had a bit of a problem getting all the bones out of the canned salmon.  Maybe I would have liked this better with clams & a different milk substitute.

I used leftover salmon from the Maple Salmon recipe (didn't want to just nuke the fillets for a meal).  I didn't have green pepper or zucchini, so I substituted canned green beans.  I also used 1% milk rather than evaporated milk.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The creamed corn is a nice addition.

Mediocre at best.  I recommend the Fish Chowder recipe submitted by Amy The.  You could substitute the salmon for the cod and have something far better than this.  I will not make this again.

Yum Yummy Yumminess 
I did not have canned milk so used a combo. of half n half and milk.  Mixed half red bell with half green bell..
sauted the vegies in a bit of butter before adding the broth..used salt free Spike and a bit of salt for lack of Seasoned Salt.. oh.. and my salmon was fresh/steamed  and Wowzer..
even my most finicky eater who removes allll traces of bells and onions from every dish known to woman-kind.. could not believe it when she realized she had just eaten two bowlsfull containing both! :)
BTW.. I served this soup in the heat of August and they still raved and asked for more.  I can't remember right now why we have EVER eaten canned soup! 
Thanks for posting.. this one is a KEEPER!

Excellent! We used one pint heavy whipping cream instead of evaporated milk and sweet white corn (suggested by someone else) Fresh thyme and 3/4 tsp dill and the seasoned salt and just a few flakes of crushed red pepper. Used the red salmon in a can and a little of the liquid for flavor.

Really delicious! I omitted the zucchini and used fresh milk, put in a dash of tabasco. This one is a keeper!

I tried this recipe to use up some frozen salmon filets.  It was a hit with the family at dinnertime.  I used a can of chopped green chiles instead of the green pepper.  Also, I added a small yellow squash in addition to the zucchini.  It came out hearty and delicious.

A tasty, hearty soup.  I liked it alot and will make it again.  The only alternations that I made were (1) I steamed fresh salmon in the microwave and used it with its juices in the soup, and (2) I added quite abit more seasoning which it truly needed.

This is really tasty, reminds me of my mom's chowder. Instead of chicken broth I made my own fish stock from salmon head that I bought in grocery store and boiled with some vegies. My husband loved it so much he had two helpings.

This is great. I tried it with canned salmon, but that wasn't good.
Then I made it with fresh sockeye, that was amazing.  The creamed corn is a great addition.

This chowder was amazing!  I used fat-free sodium reduced chicken broth and nothing was lacking as far as flavor was concerned.  It was simply delicious.

My family LOVED this soup!  I was really impressed with how well it came out -- better than a local chef's salmon chowder!  I like that it's made with fairly low-fat ingredients, too.  It's nice to see that you don't need cream or half-and-half to make a creamy soup!

WONDERFUL! DELICIOUS! My hubby said I have to double the recipe next time. I didn't have enough carrots, so I just added more potatoes. Very filling. Thank you.

Loved it! I used fresh fish which I steamed in the microwave first. Instead of salmon, I used some fresh steelhead trout. It is very similar to salmon, only milder. I think the salmon would have been a bit more overpowering and I highly recommend the stealhead trout if you can find it! I skipped the green pepper and used skim milk. It was wonderful! As one of the other reviewers suggested, I served it with a strawberry spinach salad and corn muffins. I will be making this again! Thanks!

Delicious!  I used canned salmon but I bet it's even better with fresh cooked.  I'll make this often.

Yummy!  Next time I'll use more salmon and more potates, and maybe I'll try cream/milk instead of evaporated milk.

This soup was absolutley delicious. The only exception I made was cooking all of the veggies in jowl bacon fat, and adding bacon fat throughout the process. My friends loved it so much I ended up taking goody packages of it up to my favorite bartenders in town.

Very good. We used smoked packaged salmon and no green pepper, otherwise followed it pretty much as listed. Will definitely make it again. Considering half and half or cream in place of the milk and smoked trout or some other smoked fish.
