Phenomenal!  I've been looking for this recipe for a while.  This is the closest one I have found thus far-- it's like going to the Safeway deli in Kailua and picking it up!

Excellent fresh flavor.  Didn't have the seaweed so I crumbled up a little nori instead.  The tuna is easier to dice if you partially freeze it first.  I put in a little wasabi as well.

This came out really well. I lived on Oahu for 5 years and have been craving Poke ever since I left. Was just about to give up and admit defeat till I found this recipe. I left out the macadamia nuts and added a LITTLE soy to the finished product.

Excellent poke.  I followed the instructions and the only change was adding a teaspoon or two of soy sauce.

Really tasty!  I agree the macadamia nuts add crunch, the sesame seeds a nuttiness and the soy sauce adds needed saltiness.  We served with pickled ginger and wasabi on the side.  We made this  for a dinner party and there wasn’t a morsel left.  Thanks for the tip of slightly freezing the tuna.  Very helpful!

Oh my, how fabulous is this  Ahi Tuna.  I made it tonight, just for me. :)
I didn't have macadamia nuts, so I used toasted some sesame seeds.  I added just a kiss of wasabi and soy.
I served with greens, pickled red onion, fresh avocado and rice.  
My belly is happily content.

Guests said it was the best poke they’d ever had. Good fish made it genome album.
