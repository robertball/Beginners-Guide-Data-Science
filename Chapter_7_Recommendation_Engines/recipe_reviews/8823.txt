My family really liked this recipe.  I did however make several alterations to keep it from being a bit bland. I like dishes with plenty of flavor and of course garlic is a must of me.  Here are some changes that I made and it worked out great. I pounded out the chicken to an even thickness.  Added 2 cloves crushed garlic to the green onions and butter.  I grated probably 3/4 of a cup of fresh parm.  Added salt and pepper along with the italian seasoning to the fresh grated parm cheese mixture. Instead of 1/2 C milk, I did 1 C of a milk and sour cream mixed. I mixed with more sour cream than milk just as long as it totalled 1 Cup.  I added a pinch of cayanne pepper and salt to the milk mixture during the simmering phase.  I put the whole 10oz pkg of frozen spinach and I also added to that a whole package of sauteed mushrooms that I had sauteed in butter and salted.  I also substituted the pimentoes for roasted red peppers as did someone else in the reviews.  I ended up putting in about 1/2 cup of chopped roasted red peppers in with the spinach and mushrooms.  Because there was plenty of vegetables in the mixture, I didn't serve with a side dish of veggies, just a side of herb roated potato pieces.  Yum.

This was delicious!!  I added some breadcrumbs to the parmesan cheese coating mixture and sauteed some garlic in with the butter for the sauce and added some salt & pepper as well.  I omitted the onions (we don't like them) and the pimentos (didn't have any).  I also pounded the chicken out to about 3/4 inch so it was uniform in thickness.  I baked the chicken alone for 15 minutes and then put the spinach mixture on top for the last 15 minutes so it wouldn't dry out.  That worked very well.  I will definitely make this again!

I liked this. I used the original recipe for inspiration but changed a few things. I pounded the chicken, dusted it in flour and browned it for 3-4 minutes per side. I chopped up some fresh baby spinach (instead of the frozen) and sauteed it in the water left on the leaves from washing, then drained and set aside until I was ready to add it to the sauce as instructed. I used real grated parmesan (bought a block and grated it). mmmmm ... and cooked fettucine on the side. I put some butter/garlic/basil on the fettucine, then added the leftover sauce once I took the chicken out of the baking dish. YUM!

This was really good.  I sauted regular onions in the butter first and before I added the flour I added some garlic and some red pepper flakes. I used fresh spinach because I had some that need to be used.  I always brine my chiken and pork.  I keep a container with half salt and half sugar and before I cook a I place my chicken or pork in a zip lock bag with a few tablespoons of the mixture and then add water.  I let it sit at least an hour.  If you do this you will never have dried out pork or chicken again. Most brine recipes are more complex that this but it works perfectly.

This was delicious! I used bone in chicken breasts and substituted regular onions and red pepper flakes for green onion and pimentoes because those were not available. It still came out beautifully. I also used fresh chopped spinach which I had on hand and I added minced garlic to the sauteeing onions. It smelled incredible while it was baking and the chicken was unbelievably tender and moist. Would definitely make again.

This is simple and easy.  The spinach needs to be well drained, mine got watery in the oven.

This recipe was delicious. I marinated the chicken overnight in italian dressing which kept the chicken itself juicy and flavorful. I added lots of fresh garlic to the spinach mix - maybe 4 or 5 cloves. And instead of pimentos, I used fire roasted red peppers because they were easily available and inexpensive. Turned out delicious and pretty! I'll make again.

This is a great way to add more spinach to your diet.  I doubled the butter, flour, milk, and spinach to make more sauce.  Using freshly grated parmesan cheese makes a big difference in the flavor.

Everyone in my family loves this!  I make double the spinach mixture to have enough as a side dish.  I also add garlic, per other reviewers' comments.  It is so rich and creamy.  The family cheers when this one comes out of the oven!

I made this recipe once and thought it somewhat bland and in need of tweeking.  So, on make #2, I used 4 large chicken breasts and cut "pockets" in them.  Took the well drained 10 ounces of spinach and mixed it with 6 ounces of softened cream cheese and 2 teaspoons of Montreal Steak Seasoning.  This mixture I stuffed into the pockets I had prepared in the chicken breast.  I then coated each breast with the cheese and spice mixture, spiked with another 2 teaspoons of Montreal Steak Seasoning.  Placed in a shallow baking dish.  Garnished with the chopped green onions and pimento, leaving out the sauce all togethter.  I baked them for 1 hour until slightly golden and juices ran clear.  Served them with a side of fettuccini with broccoli alfredo sauce...WOW!!!  What a hit with everyone.  Thanks for the good base recipe and the ability to tweek it to your own special taste!

after reading the reviews I decided to add my own touch to this recipe/
I used pecorina romano cheese and fresh basil to dip the chicken in

 I added garlic and mushrooms to the butter and onion(I used Vadalia)
I also used half and half instead of skim milk added more spinach than required and added fresh grated nutmeg to the spinach.
the smell while it was cooking was AWESOME!! It tasted AWESOME too.
It is such a simple quick recipe but tasted like a gourmet meal!!

Thanks for sharing this recipe I wll be making this on a regular basis.

I don't know why other reviewers thought this was bland, I thought it was great! I used the whole 10 oz of spinach and ate the rest on the side.  Next time, I will double the sauce, add a tiny bit of lemon juice, and maybe sprinkle some mozzarella on top.

5 stars with my alterations, which were inspired by previous reviews.  I added 1/2c sour cream to the sauce, another 1/4 c of milk, and used an entire bag of fresh spinach.  Also, the sauce would be really bland without seasoning.  I added minched garlic, salt, pepper and a dash of red pepper.  The sauce turned out creamy and decadent.

This was good!  My kids devoured it and requested that I "make this all the time"!  I followed a few suggestions in other reviews.  I pounded the chicken breasts, floured them and pan cooked them for a few minutes on each side.  I then sauteed fresh spinach, onions, garlic, and mushrooms in olive oil.  Added the flour and then equal parts heavy cream and milk.  In a baking dish I first placed chicken then layered on the spinach cream sauce then covered with parmesan cheese and panko bread crumbs.  Served with angel hair pasta.  What a surprise for just wanting to use up some spinach and mushrooms that were going to go bad soon!

I read reviews before making this and there was 1  less-than-4or 5 -star that said it was watery and kind of bland. I honestly thought maybe that cook didn't drain the spinach enough... which would result in watery sauce. But I followed exactly and drained my spinach very well and the result was still watery, bland, although very moist, chicken . Many of the higher  star reviews adjusted the recipe. And, that is just what I would have to do, if I make again. I would add fresh garlic,more spices and use fresh chopped spinach instead, at minimum.

This was pretty good, but still a bit bland. The chicken was really good, and moist, but make sure you follow other reviewers ideas i.e: double the sauce, add cajunseasoning to cheese mixture, pund chicken thin, and add salt to the sauce before you put in on the chicken. I used some yelow onions with the green onions, and it worked great.

Great combination of flavors...  I too pounded the chicken breasts to an even thickness and pre-baked the parmesan coated chicken breasts for 20 minutes.  

I sauted the onions and fresh spinach in the oil that my sun dried tomatoes came in and used the choped tomatoes in the sauce instead of the pimentos.  

To make extra creamy sauce I doubled the milk and added 4 oz cream cheese and simmered until the cheese melted.  Topped with mozarella und baked.  Perfection :)

loved it... my changes were for my family, but the idea came from this recipe.  I use frozen chicken tenders, I drench them in egg, then in a 1 cup parmesan with 1 cup italian seasonings mixture.  place all in baking pan.  cook for 15 minutes.  prepare the spinach, double the milk, double the spinach, full sweet onion chopped and cooked in butter with garlic powder.  add 2 tbs flour and then top chicken  and cook for 15 minutes more.  All from frozen chicken, (not thawed)   amazing.. a favorite for the 10 year old boy, and the 15 yr old boy.  easy to cook, easy to serve.  thanks so much.

This was so good! My tweaks were minimal, but truly made this a memorable dish that will surely make an appearance on our dining room table again. I marinated the chicken (cut into strips) in a zip-lock of Italian Seasoning, red wine vinegar, and EVOO for the afternoon, then browned it b4 putting it in the baking dish. Sauteed white onions w/ garlic in the butter, & used the full package of spinach, as well as roasted red peppers, as opposed to pimento. I HEART the creaminess of the spinach when this came out of the oven and am anxious to make it again!

My entire family loved this! This is a great way to sneak a little spinach into my kids' food! I doubled the recipe, and made a few minor changes. I didn't have green onions so used about 1/3 cup minced onion, and didn't have pimentos so used capers. I also sprinkled a little salt and lemon pepper on the chicken breasts, and sauteed 3 cloves of garlic with the onion. This was really good with linguine which I tossed with about 1 tbs butter (not much), the liquid from the cooked chicken/spinach, and sprinkled with a little garlic salt. We also had a tossed salad and garlic bread. I cut the kids' chicken up and mixed it with the linguine. This was actually a pretty fast recipe, and is now one of our very favorites!

Oh wow, we loved this!  Because some reviewers found this to be bland, I started by seasoning the chicken with garlic salt and pepper.  I didn’t think there was enough of the parmesan/Italian seasoning mixture to roll the chicken in, so I just sprinkled half over the chicken in the baking dish, and reserved half to sprinkle over the top of the creamed spinach.   I roughly chopped fresh spinach and wilted it in boiling water.  I drained it and allowed it to cool before squeezing out the excess moisture.  I added a minced clove of garlic while sautéing the green onions.  Again I made sure to season the creamed spinach mixture with salt and pepper.  I assembled this in the afternoon, covered and refrigerated it until dinnertime.   With some added seasoning this is a great recipe!  UPDATE 4/28/16:  I made this again as before.  I baked it for 35 minutes and then popped it under the broiler to add a bit of color to the top.  The pimentos weren't really visible, so next time I'll garnish with a few extras on top just before serving.

I feel like this dish could have used some seasonings. I like the general idea of it, but it was just bland. I should have considered that when I was making it, but since I rarely salt things anyway, I didn't even consider it. It definitely needed both salt and pepper an even some garlic.

My family loved this recipe.  I had been looking for something with chicken and spinach (very abundent in our garden) and this was just the dish!  I omitted the green onions as I didn't have any, we don't eat pimentos, so didn't add those.  I took another reader's suggestion and roasted up some mushrooms and added those in....voila - so delicious.  I served with roasted potatoe wedges, but think next time I make this - it will be with a pasta!  Thanks for the recipe!

Even tho I did tweak this quite a bit, the recipe has good bones, hence the reason for the four star rating. Being that Parmesan cheese is in the title, one would think it would play a more important part other than a mere 1/3 cup for six chicken breasts. I also wasn't sure what the purpose was of just sprinkling that small amount onto the chicken. You might as well just put it in the sauce itself. I wanted this dish to stand out, so I placed at least a good cup of parm onto a plate and added some seasonings. Each piece of chicken got an egg bath, was then was coated with the cheese, went into a skillet with a bit of butter and canola oil to fry to a nice crusty and golden brown. I replaced the pimentos with mushrooms, quadrupled the sauce to which I added more seasonings and used fresh spinach that I ran thru my food processor. Any leftover parm was melted right into the sauce. The end result was fabulous and my family raved. Thank you so much for a really terrific start!

This is a really good recipe, but like other foodies, I altered it a bit.  I pounded the chicken, flavored it with Tony Chachere's, salt and pepper.  Dredged it in Parmesan, Ittalian bread crumbs, equal amounts and Italian seasonings, then sauteed the chicken in olive oil until brown.  Sauteed fresh mushrooms, fresh spinach, garlic and onions in olive oil in a separate skillet (2 handfuls of spinach, 1/2 onion chopped, 2 cloves garlic, about 6 mushrooms sliced).  Mixed 1/2 cup of milk, 1 tbls. of flour and 1/2 cup of sour cream in bowl and mixed with spinach mix , add red pepper and cooked to boiling.  Then I placed chicken in pyrex dish and topped with spinach mixture and topped that with sliced roasted red peppers (about 2).  Mixed about 1/3 cup each of Italian bread crumbs and mozzarella cheese and topped the chicken spinach mixture with this.  OMG so tasty, if you don't like alot of flavor this is not for you.  Served with white rice or whatever your starch preference is.  Delicious!!!

This is great!  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and sauted it with the green onion.  I did not have the pimento peppers, but it was excellent without it.

Very delicious way to get your spinach in!  I added panko breadcrumbs to the remaining parmesan cheese mixture, and topped the spinach with that, to give it a little crunch.  I had pounded the chicken to even it out a little, and it was very moist...will make again!

This was just ok. I agree that it was bland. If made again, I'd mix in 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper with the parmesan for a little kick. I doubled the sauce and much of it ended up down the drain. Better the next day, though!!

OMG!  This recipe was so delicious.  I can't believe how moist and tender the chicken was and the flavor was perfect.  I did make a few changes but nothing that really changed the basic recipe.  I added more Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning.  I only had 4 chix breasts, I used a whole regular onion, chopped, two T. butter, 1 cup milk, fresh spinach and no pimentos.  I also added a package of fresh mushrooms and some minced garlic.  Thanks for the great recipe, will be making it again.

This was absolutely wonderful!  I used fresh spinach along with 1/4 cup chopped mushrooms and chopped onion.  Wow!  I also used some whipping cream in place of the milk...can't go wrong!  I then added a little extra parm cheese.  I served it over brown rice from the rice cooker and drizzled the juice over the entire meal.  My family loved it!

Didn't care for it.  Sorry.  Look at ingredients before you try it folks.  This had no flavor.  Very bland with a bunch of spinich on top (and I love spinich).  Some garlic and a bunch of seasoning might improve it.  And maybe cream the spinich so that it's not this big heavy glob of green on your chicken.  Season! Season! Season!

This was very good. I needed more than 1/3 cup parmesan cheese. I also used 1 ten ounce of box of spinach and added about 3/4 cup milk. I also added a little bit of nutmeg with the spinach a la Rachael Ray.
You also definitely need a bigger pan about 9x13.

I didn't have pimentos, and I coated the chicken with egg, followed by the cheese/Italian mixture and quickly browned strips of boneless skinless chicken in EVOO.  I used fresh spinach and topped off the dish with shredded Montery Jack before baking.  I served this over egg noodles tossed in EVOO and garlic salt, it was YUMMMMM!!

Excellent and tender! Followed the directions EXCEPT I pounded the chicken first, used bread crumbs with the parm, doubled the sauce,and added the spinach halfway through the cooking. Served over basil and parmesan orzo also from this site. Seriously, people, all six of my children ate their chicken AND their spinach without one word of complaint. Yum! Thanks for a great recipe, KM Smokey!

This was sooo good, but needs a few mandatory changes and it is spectacular.  Like another reviewer I cut my breasts in about 3rds then rolled in the cheese mixture and fried in butter/oil. Then put in the oven.  Made at least twice as much sauce ( don't really measure), also put a chicken boullion cube in the sauce and a little white wine and red pepper flakes.  I used fresh spinach and sauted it (in the same pan I browned the chicken in) with the onions and some fresh garlic (or put garlic in the sauce.).  Just before serving put the spinach on the chicken and top with sauce.  I would highly recommend using fresh spinach with this method, rather than frozen.  And definitely make more sauce than called for!

This was a quick and tasty meal that used items I commonly have on hand.  I used some of the suggestions from others, added garlic, mushrooms, used a mix and frozen spinach (which is what I had) and add a dollop of sour cream.  I also added some breadcrumbs to the chicken coating, but did think a lot of the coating fell off...maybe cooking it quickly in a frying pan first would help as others said.  No onions or pimiento used here, and I thought it was fine!

My family loved this.  I did make extra sauce, and used Southern Style Mustard greens, which gave it a lot of kick.  Of course I also used garlic, and fresh grated Parm cheese.  This is something so good, no one suspects it's healthy.  Not even my two small kids!!!

This was really good and really easy and quick.  I added about 1/2 c. sour cream as suggested by someone else and it does make it better.  I also never keep pimento in the house, so I oven roasted some red bell pepper and it was great.  The other night I made this again and didn't have bell pepper so I cut up some black olives in it instead and that was good too.

It took me maybe 5 minutes to prepare the ingredients and chicken, 2 minutes to prepare the spinach concotion on my gas stove. This is a very easy recipe that got rave reviews from my kids. Even my 14 year-old who hates spinach loved this one!

This really has potential and we enjoyed it, however the amount of sauce/spinach would not cover 6 chicken breasts. We had 3 breasts and the amount of spinach on each was very little after cooking. Like everyone else, I changed this up some because of what I had on hand (red onions, no green and no peppers) and talored for our likes (added about 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning, salt, pepper and a bit of garlic).  The chicken on its own was very bland (but moist and tender) but when combined with the spinach mixture, it had more flavor.  This is a great base recipe and easy to change for your family's preferences.  Just a note - adjust the cooking time based on the size of your chicken breasts.  Mine were larger (~ 1.5 lbs for 3) and it took about 45 minutes in the oven.

a very yummy way to combine chicken and spinach!  i found it a bit bland, which had i read the other reviews, i would have seen as a theme and decided to spice it up a bit.  but alas, i did not, so it was lacking a little in flavor but wass till very good.  i think next time just some garlic will give it enough "oomph".  my 5 year old really liked this, though my 3 year old spent most of dinner tonight making gagging noises from her booster sit.  you win some, you lose some.  i thought it was a very easy, wholesome and yummy meal - thanks!

My family loved this recipe. I had been looking for something with chicken and spinach (very abundent in our garden) and this was just the dish! I omitted the green onions as I didn't have any, we don't eat pimentos, so didn't add those. I took another reader's suggestion and roasted up some mushrooms and added those in....voila - so delicious. I served with roasted potatoe wedges, but think next time I make this - it will be with a pasta! Thanks for the recipe!

Not a keeper. I didn't mind the taste so much but I would suggest not using packaged parmesan as it seemed to just get hard and not meld into the spinach enough on the top which gave it a weird texture.

There just wasn't enough flavor for me so perhaps I'll make some adjustments and come back and re-review.

This was very good, but I wonder how people fit 6 chicken breasts in an 8 x8 pan. I used a larger pan. Also, I used a whole package of spinach and doubled the milk. I also wonder how you can dip 6 breasts in a 1/3 cup of cheese and still have any lft over to put on top. It was tasty and I wiill make again. My husband thought it came from a restaurant!

Loved this! I made a few adjustments though (because I didn't have some of the ingredients). Used yellow onion instead of green onion, omitted the pimento peppers altogether, sauteed in olive oil instead of butter and added 1/3 cup of oat bran to the Parm mixture to add a bit more fiber. It tasted really fresh and healthy. This will become a weekly meal in my house.

Just made this for the family(husband, 2.5 yo, myself) and it is AMAZING!!!! I made some adjustments such as adding chicken broth, garlic, sour cream, and cherry tomatoes to the sauce.  I took other suggestions and cooked the chicken for 15 minutes before adding the sauce.  I also set aside some of the sauce for after cooking.  I put it all over egg noodles and made steamed broccoli and asparagus.  It was the perfect meal for our family and we ALL loved it! Easy, tasty, and easily changed to suite a families tastes!

Good, solid recipe, but not special enough to warrant a 5 rating. I'm pregnant and trying to get greens in my diet anywhere I can. 1 of my 2 kids happily ate it.   Not sure if I will make again or not.

Great dish! Loved it and so did the jaded boyfriend! Added sour cream to the milk, used roasted red peppers instead of pimentos, sauteed fresh spinach with garlic instead of frozen, added crushed fiber one original to the parm mix used to roll chicken in. Served with whole wheat pasta tossed with pesto! A keeper!

This was OUTSTANDING - it deserves five stars with changes: cut chicken into smallish pieces, used an extra 1/3 c parmesan, LOTS of extra homemade Italian seasoning (including extra crushed red pepper flakes), an extra 1/4 c white onions, left out pimento peppers. It was so juicy and delicious, but these changes must be made!

I only used three breasts and still had way too much chicken for only three people. But, it was good and everyone enjoyed it. I added some panko bread crumbs to the cheese mixture, otherwise I kept the recipe as it was written. Will eat again, thanks!

Very tasty.  I took others' suggestions and added some minced garlic with the green onions and butter, then threw in some crushed red pepper, it turned out quite good.  Served with some angel hair pasta and the goo as the topping.  I will definitely make again.

Seriously sastisfying! I pounded the chicken, seasoned with garlic salt and browned on both sides for a couple of minutes before rolling in cheese and seasoning. I used fresh spinach and fresh garlic for the sauce. After a full day it's nice to sit around the table with family and have a tasty meal.

Sorry, but this recipe was not good. It was watery and not very flavorful. Maybe it needed more spices. I did add some garlic, like other people did, also salt and pepper. My husband did not like it and neither did I. I should just stick to my own cooking.

Wonderful recipe that we all enjoyed!  I did not have pimento peppers, so I did not add them.  Next time I will definitely double the spinach sauce, because it was SO yummy!  I did take the suggestions of other reviewers and added S&P to the chicken coating, and I added garlic to the sauce.  There were NO leftovers!

This recipie was delicious!! I was missing the green onion and the pepper so it turned out a little bland. I tried to make up for it with some fresh garlic and and a little crushed red pepper but it did not quite do the trick. I topped it off with some blue cheese crumbles and then OMG it was the greatest thing EVER!!!!

Great!  Also added a tablespoon of Italian-style bread crumbs to the cheese-seasoning mix, used fresh spinach instead of frozen, and topped the spinach-chicken with sautéed sliced white mushrooms before baking.  Additionally, I tossed some mini farfalle with fresh basil, marinara, and alfredo sauce, then placed the baked chicken breasts on top.

My hubby and I really enjoyed this, and I only made a few modifications to the recipe. I added garlic powder, used half of a sweet onion since green onions weren't available, and used two whole chopped pimientos. Next time, I might add some marinated artichokes. I'll definitely double the amount of topping. I also like the idea of adding some breadcrumbs; I didn't think to do that while I was making it. The chicken turned out very tender and moist. I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could, just because I had to make those few simple modifications to give it a little more flavor.

We just finished eating this recipe, and the family wants more!! I doubled the spinach recipe, and instead of using milk, I used 1/4c heavy whipping cream, 1/4 cup chicken broth (equal to 1/2 cup skim milk). We didn't use the pimentos, but we added extra italian seasonings, plus garlic and fresh grated parm, instead of the shakeable stuff! Since we didn't have anything that wouldn't melt, we baked chicken and spinach without the cheese topping, but added it at the end til' bubbly! This was great, thanks!

I'll make again with some additions. I served it over a small bed of wheat pasta and a side of squash.  It was a little bland made as is.  I'll add garlic, and other preferred seasonings, maybe even a little red pepper flakes as another noted.  Was a little try so will increase the rue sauce I’d like to have more juices.

People complained of bland. So I read all the reviews and this was one great dish. I pounded and marinaded chicken in no fat zesty Italian dressing. I sauted regular onions and garlic in butter and added a lb. of sliced mushrooms and sauted down. Added flour, milk, and spinach,did not increase flour or milk as there was juices from mushrooms. Took half of the breading material and dredged the chicken. Cook 15 mins and then added the spinach mixture and the other half of breading mixture and baked. With the mushrooms added, it was a nice solid mixture over top of breasts.  Great, will make again.

Fantastic!  The flavor is lovely- I doubled the recipe and added creole seasoning.  A new favorite.

This was delicious. My husband didn't like the sound of it, but when he smelt it cooking and  tasted it he loved it! I did make some additions to the recipe in fear of not enough flavor. I added chopped white onion along with the green onion and added garlic powder while I sauteed. I also added dry italin dressing seasonings  to the cheese mixture. The chicken  was very juicy and flavorful. I also took the advice of reviewers to double the sauce. That was excellent advice! Thanks for sharing!

My family devoured this meal. It was a great dinner because it wasn't heavy and was healthy. The original recipe was great but like others I made changes.  I added garlic and mushrooms to the sauce and bread crumbs to the coating.  I also used sundried tomatoes instead of pimentos. The chicken was extremely tender and juicy.

followed this recipe step by step until the pimento part, left those out.  I didn't seem to mind it.  It is low in calories, and a good way to get your vegetables in.  The ideas of adding garlic and bread crumbs sounded good, but I figured I had to follow the recipe as described to have the actual nutritional values that are given.  I over all enjoyed it, and will have it again.  I did use a thinner cut of chicken breast also, about a 4oz piece.

It's rare to find a low fat, low carb recipe that tastes this good!  I'll be making this again soon.  I think I'll add some extra peppers since I like things spicy, but I sure have no complaints about this dish as is.  Thank you, Kathy, for the great recipe!

Am giving this 4 stars, since I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  Used other reviewers suggestions, and added salt, pepper, garlic powder and a few bread crumbs to cheese.  Also, doubled the sauce adding salt, pepper, a little more garlic and a small pinch of nutmeg,and used capers instead of pimiento.  Chicken was super moist, and sauce was very tasty. Will definitely make again.

I added some garlic to the spinich to give it more flavor because I had read that the meal was a little bland and added some cayenne pepper and italian bread crumbs to the parmesan cheese mixture.  Very good.  Still need to salt to taste.

Awesome! Needed a high iron recipe and this dish was a huge hit.  Modified the ingredients to include capers (more iron) instead of pimento peppers, and added bread crumbs to the chicken coating. Used yellow onion, and added garlic.  Served over fresh spinach with cubed oranges on the side (helps absorb the iron.)  Husband claimed that it was high-end restaurant quality.  My family can't wait for me to make it again.

Delicious and beautiful dish. I used what I had on hand: pecorino romano, fresh spinach, roasted red peppers (in a jar), fresh garlic and red onion in place of the green onion. Also increased the amount of sauce slightly. I served it with spaghetti tossed with olive oil, garlic and basil, but could have served with plain pasta as there was plenty of sauce. My family loves it.

This had wonderful flavor and was really quick and easy to put together. The sauce as prepared in the recipe was a little thick, so I thinned it with some chicken broth. Other than that...fabulous!

This was super easy and was great for a last minute meal.  I had everything on hand which is one reason why this recipe is so good.  It's fast, healthy and I always have the ingredients on hand. The only changes I made was to add garlic and I used tomatoes from my garden instead of the peppers.  Will for sure make this again.

The chicken was really bland, even though we doubled the seasoning.  As for 6 breasts fitting in an 8x8 pan, those would have to be some tiny chickens!  We had 3 good sized breast halves and they just fit in an 11x9 dish.  For the spinach, we used 5oz of fresh spinach and cooked it with the green onions and a clove of garlic; didn't have the pimento, so left it out, but I'm sure that would have been good. Our chicken took almost and hour to cook through.  It was a good meal.

Really good and easy!
I used thin slices of chicken Brest, and roasted red peppers instead of pimento, used lots of garlic and lots of cheese.
Next time will brown the chicken first and use fresh spinach.

For these ingredients, I expected more flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly and it is a great concept, but seriously bland.  Even heart healthy entrees need flavor.  In addition, my chicken wasn't done, even after 40 minutes.

Heart Smart would best describe this dish.  Take note that this recipe is low in fat and uses mostly sodium free ingredients with NO added salt—a.k.a. bland.  With that in mind, I would agree with others that it is in need of additional seasonings.  Can’t say that I liked the Italian seasoning, but definitely some garlic and pepper wouldn’t hurt.  If you have dietary restrictions or just looking for healthier, creative options, this one is definitely worth tweaking to suit your taste.

This was good, I liked the flavor.  It was a little bland for my taste, though I didn't add the pimentos because I didn't have any, and that may have helped.  I added garlic powder to the mix, but next time I'll add more spices.  I used only two breasts but kept the sauce the same and I'm glad I did.  I used fresh spinach and put it on top of the chicken then added the sauce.  The pan needs to be covered to wilt the spinach, then remove the cover to brown up the topping.  Overall, very good, quick and easy!

I was looking for a recipe to use what I had leftover from a previous recipe and hit the jack pot! I used challot instead of green onion because it's what I had available. I also put a dash of red pepper sauce in the spinach mixture along with two cloves chopped garlic. I ditched the pimento peppers and used fresh spinach instead on frozen which I think eliminates the runnyness. I used italian bread crumbs in the cheese mixture alone with salt and pepper. Served with peas and brown rice. Delicious!

Thia was fabulous but I did change it a bit; I pounded the chicken breast as suggested and dipped them into a beaten egg and then rolled it in the cheese mixture which I added bread crumbs to. I then browned the chicken breast in a little olive oil and then followed the rest of the recipe. My husband really liked it a lot.  KMSMOKEY  your recipe is really good following your directions also. Thank you

I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce, which was a great idea. I wilted fresh spinach and omitted the pimento peppers because I didn't have any, but other than that I followed the recipe. The chicken came it SO moist and delicious, plus it looked great. The only bad thing was it required several steps to make it and it did take a little while to get it all done. Other than that, it was great!!

This is my new favorite! I serve it over a little pasta. It looks dry going into the oven, and I thought it might stick. But when it comes out it's juicy and wonderful! I love the spinach and regularly use fresh. I just use one big bunch of spinach for this recipe, and omit the pimentos because I didn't have any. The green onions are a must!! They make the dish so flavorful. Thank you for the great recipe.

The recipe turned out great and the sauce was very good, but the spinach overpowered the dish. I may make it again with less spinach and more sauce.

It was great ! I think the only thing missing was some garlic. I'll try adding some the next time I make this - which will probably be very soon !

I made this for my visiting sister and friend. We all loved it and completely polished it off! I didn't use pimento peppers but it was still fantastic. I definitely recommend!

This was really good. I changed it slightly and added garlic salt and pepper for more seasoning. I also used raw spinach and added mushrooms as someone else had done which tasted great. I paired it with the pasta shells as suggested and it was really good! Will definately make this again.

This dish is amazing with a couple adjustments. I used white onion, garlic & mushrooms instead of just the green onion. Would give it 4.5 stars the way it is (if I could). 5 stars with these adjustments. The sauce is sooooo good! Next time I'm going to add a little bread crumbs to cheese & spice mixture. Awesome!

Very yummy! I didn't use the pimentos and I added some Asiago cheese on top. I also used fresh spinach. Great with a small side of pasta or a salad.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written and we really enjoyed it.     Why it wasn't a 5:  - the resulting dish came out of the oven looking dry, green - I mixed things around to make the topping look creamy - I could have used a little more flavor - garlic, salt, freshly ground pepper  chicken was moist - flavor was great!

Made this for the first time tonight. Was awesome.   We added pressed garlic (2 cloves), crushed red pepper, salt and pepper to dry mixture, and doubled the recipe for the sauce. When the chicken was finished baking I also added some mozzerella cheese to the top and baked it.  Crazy additions but it was wonderful and the aroma was awesome!  Definetly will make this again.

I really liked this recipe!  Just made a few additions that I had read from previous reviews.  Added Italian Breadcrumbs and garlic powder to the cheese mixture.  Used fresh spinach and added a clove of garlic, chopped, to the spinach and green onions while cooking.  Also added about 1/2 t. red pepper flakes.  Served with whole wheat penne pasta with butter and onion  salt and coarse ground black pepper.  Fantastic meal...will do this one again and again!

This was awesome!!  I added some fresh basil and garlic to the spinach mixture.  Used fresh spinach instead of frozen and didn't even bother with teh pimento peppers.  Also used more parm cheese.  It was soooooo good.

Delicious - what there was of it.  Should have read the reviews first and made extra.  Would double the milk/spinach mixture.  Served with pasta.  Would definitely make it again.

I made this tonight and did some alternatives as well. I used fresh spinach and sauteed in garlic and oil. Then drained. I sprinkled garlic powder and parmesan cheese on chicken breast. Layed spinach on top and cut up roasted peppers. I rolled it and put breadcrumbs on top with chicken gravy. I put it in the oven at 350 for 15-20 mins. I use thin sliced chicken so 15 mins should be fine. The only thing I think it was missing was a provolone wrapped around it or proscuitto. It was very tasty. I also cooked the rotini tri color pasta and marinated it in italian dressing and kept in refrigerator until meal was ready.

This was excellent with my adjustments and two of the suggestions of others as well. I am among those that find many recipes bland as well as I greatly appreciate how the quality of ingredients used makes a HUGE difference and so I upgrade whenever I can. As for parmesan, I never use anything but Reggiano (would any self-respecting cook or foodie? :-)) Okay: Pounded chicken breasts to even and marinated for a short time in garlic-italian salad dressing. Used Reggiano and added basil, oregano (dry) and white pepper to a 1 tsp of Italian seasoning. Substituted the following because they were on hand: combination onion & shallots for green onions and more than recipe calls for; several cloves of garlic minced; 1/2 can of fire-roasted tomatoes in lieu of peppers (though would like to try the peppers next time.) Added salt to wilted spinach; used a big Costco container of fresh baby spinach. Served over whole-wheat spaghattini which I added garlic powder (ran of time!) and olive oil to. I am so glad I used more spinach, it would have been more like a garnish otherwise. The moisture from all the spinach is probably why I didn't miss using more milk, though note that as others have said it is definitely not a sauce for pasta, it is a "saucy" topping. It was delicious.

Really good. I add some spices to amp up the flavor, which I do with most recipes anyway. Just season to taste and you'll be fine. I doubled the spinach/sauce to serve over whole wheat spaghetti.

My husband, who could care less about food, says that this is one of the best things I have ever made. I did do a bit less butter, and I actually added about 1/2 cup of shredded skim chedder cheese to the sauce. Next time I need to make some more sauce to put on pasta! YUM!!

Great starter!  Needs to have some igredients added for more of a kick!  I added onion powder and garlic salt along with pepper to the parmesan for the chicken crust.  I also added garlic and roasted red peppers to the spinach mixture along with some red pepper flakes.  With these changes the recipe was absolutely outstanding!

This is an easy recipe, as long as you have all the ingredients on hand.  I made some modifications, like many other reviewers.  I added mushrooms to the spinach mixture...and, I added the spinach mixture half way through the cooking process.  I added a different hard cheese because that is what I had at home.  Instead of using green onions, I used white ones.  This is a flavorful and great meal for the winter months.

Very good!!  I added italian bread crumbs to the parm cheese, then coated both sides of the chicken with it and baked it for 15 minutes without the spinach mixture and then 20 minutes with the spinach mixture.  I also added salt, pepper and garlic to the butter mixture.  A keeper!

This was pretty good - but not what I expected.  The only change I made was adding bread crumbs and garlic.

This was excellent.  I took another rater's advice and added 2 cloves garlic when I sauteed the (white) onion and followed her other suggestions as well including increasing the parmesan, adding (Italian) bread crumbs, sour cream, extra spinach, mushrooms, roasted red pepper and red pepper flakes.  Really good!

What a hit! And that includes raves from four teenage boys - all jocks. I made a few changes per other suggestions. I pounded the chicken to get a uniform thickness. I used more fresh parmesan than called for and added some breadcrumbs because I like a nice crust. I used the whole box of spinach, 4 oz. of pimento for the topping. I added several cloves of garlic with the onion and a little olive oil. So all I really did was take up a few flavor notches. I served it with simple pasta with olive oil and garlic and steamed brocolli. We'll be having this again!

This was great!  I took the suggestions from a few of the other reviewers' and, added some of my own!  The sour cream tip was fantastic--thanks to the previous reviewer!  I used half and half instead of low fat milk--extra calories, I know, but worth it ( I used a non fat sour cream though!).  I also added garlic and sea salt to the cream sauce.  I, too, dipped the Chicken in egg first, then, added fresh Basil to my Parmesan mixture--I used the shredded and fine grated.  I served this with Bow Tie pasta lightly coated with Olive Oil and topped with alot of fresh Italian Parsley!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe, I will DEFINATLY make this again!

This was absolutely delicious.  I incorporated many of the suggestions from previous reviews. First, I pounded chicken to even thickness.  I dipped in egg, then Italian breadcrumbs, and gave it a quick pan fry to brown the outside.  Added 5 cloves of minced garlic to the green onion.  Used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup sour cream.  Used entire package of spinach. Finally, used 1/4 cup chopped roasted red peppers instead of pimentos.  Flavor was fantastic! Try this recipe.  You won't be disappointed.

Tasted a little bland. I will use more seasoning next time. I will also use fresh spinach. The frozen spinach just held too much water no matter how much I drained it.

Husband and I really liked this. But followed advice of some of the other reviewers: Added 1-2 cloves of minced garlic to the sautee. Sprinkled lemon pepper on chicken before coating in Parmesan. Also used all 10oz of spinach - may want to add just a touch more milk if you do.

I did not like this dish at all.  The chicken breasts wind up sitting in liquid & the breasts were soft and not flavorful at all.  We thought the the only good thing was the creamed spinach.

In the words of Rachel Ray YUMOO!!! This was so very good.  ALWAYS read the reviews before making a dish...the suggestions are great.  I added garlic and the roasted red peppers to the sauce, which I doubled. Make sure you season your chicken...I used kosher salt, white pepper, a little crushed red pepper and garlic (can you tell we like garlic).  This would be a great sauce by itself.  I may pan fry the chicken next time, using the sauce to put over some pasta.

This turned out great, but I think it was mainly due to my doctoring it. I used yellow onion instead of green. I also added some cream cheese, cheddar cheese, lots of garlic, a little white wine, and some nutmeg to the spinach mixture. Yum! :)

Pretty good, but seriously lacking flavor. The only thing I changed was only using 2 chicken breasts and adding red pepper flakes to the cheese mixture. If I were to make this again, I'd add lots of garlic to the spinach mixture, and would use diced yellow onion rather than green onion.

Myhusband who does not like chicken even liked this dish!  We made a few substitions like red roasted peppers for the pimentos, added mushrooms, used the whole package of spinach which I think kept the chicken extra moist.  This one is a keeper in our house!

We love this, I've made it multiple times already.  You do need to salt the chicken to taste, but I take that as a given with all recipes.  I add milk to make more sauce because it's so good, but other than that I don't change anything.  Looks and tastes great!  You can get away with less Parmesan.

This recipe is the first with an overall rating of 5 stars that I think should only have 1 star. Although the spinach itself had good flavor(I used fresh spinach), the  chicken was quite bland. I doubled the sauce as suggested by other reviewers, but overall there was not much flavor.

very good and easy to make.  i threw in some pork chops along with the chicken breasts because that's what i had.  turned out pretty good.  i also doubled the sauce ingredients and made it in a large casserole dish.  cooked it just about 45 minutes, wonderful.  even my 2 year old ate it!

Reall yreally good...My chicken for once came out really moist since it was covered with the delicious sauce!  I put lots of spinach in mine - almost a cup and a half for just one breast.  I threw in some garlic with the butter and the milk thickened beautifully with the flour mixture.  I also added a tiny pinch of nutmeg with the spinach, and tons of garlic to coat the chicken with.  The result was like chicken with delicious creamed spinach.  Took no time to throw together either.

Sooooo yummy, quick, and easy! You don't have to make a 'grocery run' to make this dish. AND it's not unhealthy! P.S. it's just as good using chopped yellow onion instead of green onion, and also good without the pimentos.

Just made it for SUPER BOWL. Was excellent!!  Tripled the recipe and added 8 oz cream cheese to the sauce. Also added Italian bread crumbs to the cheese mixture. Covered and baked 35 min then removed cover and baked 15 min more.  Needed salt and pepper. YUMMY !!!!

Really great - I used fresh diced tomatoes instead of the pimento and served it over spinach linguini.

I added a few things and it turned out quite well. We don't have weight in ounces here so I used just over 2 cups of frozen spinach. Next time I make this (and that will be soon) I will double all the sauce, use 1 red and 1 yellow pepper, 3 cloves of garlic, 1\2 large onion, salt, pepper, and twice as much cheese. We didn't have italian seasoning here either, so I just put 1\4 tsp each basil and oregano in the cheese mixture, and another 1\4 tsp each sprinkled on top of the chicken before adding the spinach. Quick and easy dish and quite alot of flavour despite the low fat part. We're looking forward to trying it again with these new additions. Thanks!

Definitely add fresh garlic.  I added more milk so it would have more sauce to serve over brown rice.  Very easy and delicious.

This recipe was Super!!!!  Great flavor.  I added 3 cloves of minced garlic after cooking the onions for a few minutes.  My husband who is not a big parmesan cheese fan, loved it and has asked if I can make it again.  Even the kids loved it!  This recipe it just loaded with flavor.  Highly recommend you try it!

This was great! I followed one of the other reviewer's advice and added Swiss cheese on top of the chicken before Spinach mixture and added some seasoned breadcrumbs. Overall a great recipe - even for those who won't normally eat spinach!

This receipe was very easy to cook.  I do not eat meat and so it was great to hear my partner say that it was fantastic !!  Could not get Pimento peppers so used a small red pepper and charred over a flame to remove the skin.

I haven’t tied this yet, but sounds like something we’d love.  Doesn’t anyone ever make the recipes just like they’re written?  I do appreciate the ideas, but I think we should try them as written before we give an opinion.

Great recipe rated at a three because it is very bland, definitely had to follower other users suggestions and sautéed garlic with onions and added cayenne pepper.  Also added salt & pepper to cheese.

I made this tonight because I needed a quick dinner and did not want to shop for ingredients. I only had a little Parmesan so I made do with some shredded cheddar-jack and it was fine. I only had milk that had gone sour, and that worked too! I also used 1 1/2 tsp seasoning and it could have used more. I used the entire package of spinach and that worked fine. (I didn't want a leftover half-package.) I added salt and pepper to the creamed mixture, and over dinner my daughter suggested some garlic would have been good as well. This is a very good base recipe for what amounts to creamed spinach and chicken. It is friendly to adjustments so I loved that. Only one caution though - 6 quartered chicken breasts filled an 8 x 12 pan, so I cannot see how an 8 x 8 would ever do.

I really loved the idea behind this recipe but it was just a little under flavored for me. I picked it b/c there wasn't any breading and i'm trying to stay down on my carbs but I felt like something was missing. i'm going to read other reviews and keep trying it though! thanks

As I was making this I knew I had to add other seasonings. So I added fresh minced garlic to the onion mixture and seasoned it with cracked pepper, garlic powder and Lawry's Seasoned Salt. I also seasoned the cheese mixture with more Italian Seasoning, salt and pepper. It turned out pretty good with these add-ons.

My family loved it!  Like others, the recipe looked a bit bland so I pumped it up.  1st, I used a half wedge of fresh Asiago, ground sage, Rosemary, basil, a little salt, and cracked black pepper.  I brought the sautee up with olive oil, a cup of chopped green onion and plenty of garlic.  I then added a 10oz bag of baby spinach leaves, 1/2 cup of roasted red pepper and reduced it under cover.  I added 3/4 cup of whole milk and flour to make the creamy spinach sauce.  I placed the dish in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes then cut the heat and let it coast for 5.  I served the chicken over a bed of Linguine Olio.  Turned out fabulous! Next time I will take pictures :-)

I figured I'd like this recipe, but I actually ended up enjoying it more than I had anticipated I would. Simple AND delicious! 

I did make a few additions just to prevent the dish from coming out too bland - I added garlic, salt and pepper to the cooked spinach mixture.

Next time I'm going to use tomatoes rather than the peppers, as I love tomatoes with spinach and I didn't find that the peppers added all that much to the dish.

This dish came out great!  I only had creamed spinach so I didn't use any flour, and added only about 3 tablespoons of milk.  I also only had chicken tenderloin.  I used advice from other reviews and added minced garlic and red pepper flakes during the simmering process.

This was a creamy flavorful chicken dish which uses a clever way to utilize spinach. A couple changes were made to the original recipe that must be mentioned. I wanted a creamier result so a doubled the sauce and cheese ingredients. Didn’t have green onions or pimento peppers so I substituted red onion and red pepper which worked out beautifully. Adding ½ tsp salt, ¼ tsp pepper, and 1 Tbs lemon juice to the spinach mixture helped resolve any issues with blandness that other reviewers mentioned. The whole 10 oz. package of spinach was used (make sure to press any excess liquid out.)   Great and filling recipe!

I only used 4 chicken breasts but doubled the spinach topping using a full 16oz. package of frozen spinach, which I thoroughly squeezed the moisture from it. Sauteed garlic along with the gr. onion and added more more/other seasoning in addition to what the recipe called for. Good enough to make again, mainly because it is easy and quick. Next time I will add more pimentos.

My family loved this one.  Used fresh spinach (always do) added garlic with the onions and since I lactose intolerant, I used lactose free milk and only put the cheese on some of the chicken, but mine tasted great without any cheese.  I followed the advice about the brine 1/2 sugar and 1/2 salt.. and just coated the chicken with the mixture and put in a bowl with water in the fridge for an hour before cooking.  I could not believe the difference.  Never had chicken so moist.. thanks  to whoever mentioned that.  Oh.. one more thing.. I only used 3 large chicken breasts, so I think that for 6 I would want to double everything else, as we ate all the spinach and sauce.  I served with rice.  Djortner

Good, but not exciting. My husband said it wasn't very flavorful. I think I liked it better than him. It is a healthy recipe, but somewhat lacks in flavor.

Excellent....my family loved it....and I even used very thin pork scallopine instead of the chicken since it was what I had on hand. I used roasted red peppers and omitted the butter and used a bit of olive oil to sautee the spinach and added some garlic as well. I did top everything with some shredded mozzarella. Thanks!

After reading what others wrote once again i decided to go with the majority. I added about 2 T prepared chopped garlic with the butter and used both green onion s and yellow onions. I seasoned with chicken with the Italian spices, garlic salt, kosher salt, and fresh ground pepper. After sauteing  i removed from pan and added a teaspoon of butter and olive oil Pam. I tossed my pounded out seasoned  chicken breast with extra parm and about 3 T seasoned bread crumbs. Seared them in the pan a couple minutes each side, removed from pan and added garlic onion mix and proceeded to the sauce. I did double the sauce and used all the spinach, you have to squeeze the heck outta the spinach as the frozen holds allot of liquid. I will try it with fresh wilted next time. I placed the chicken on the bottom. As the sauce begin to bubble i removed from heat, i added about 1/4 c more of the skim milk and about the same of Parmesan, i used fresh shredded for the recipe , added a dash or two of caynne pepper and a dash of nutmeg. spooned over the 4 large breasts, sprinkled with a little more parm, and tossed about 1/2 c panko bread crumbs all over baked at 350 about 32 mins, then put on broil about 5 mins it gave the panko and parm topping a little crumb crunch. IT WAS AMAZING! i served it with garlic mashed potatoes and the extra spinach. This is the second spinach dish i've tried in as many nights, and my family thinks the new menu rocks! Thank you KMSMOKEY!

Very easy and inexpensive to prepare and very good! A great busy mom meal. I added some marinated artichoke hearts and minced garlic on top while it was baking. I served with herb pasta. Yum.

This was a pleasant surprise.  I used fresh spinach and sauteed it in the butter/flour with some garlic before adding the milk.  I also topped the cheese mixture with some shredded mozza and chunky/crispy bacon pcs.  The sauce was really good and I used it on the rice & green bean sides.

My parents like this recipe, they ate it right up :) I made a lot of substitutions though and they found it to be moist and tasty. They could still taste the spinach it was not to overbearing, it can be if you use too much. Some of the substitutions were I used regular onions, seasoned bread crumbs, and I used cheddar and mozz. cheese. I also used SOY MILK and it came out GREAT!! I used powdered garlic as well and it gave it an extra kick. Yummy! A keeper and it was super easy :)

Oh my goodness, I love this.  I only had yellow onions and I put a clove of garlic in with it.  I used some seasoned bread crumbs in the cheese (i like the extra crunch) I used chicken tenders.  I did increase the amount of sauce and spinach.  I don't even really like spinach, but went for seconds!  Ok, leftovers are just as good!

This was just ok, in my opinion.  It was fine for a weeknight, but we actually thought that it was a little lacking in flavor.  I probably won't make this again.

Really excellent, moist chicken. There's so much to do with this recipe to suit personal taste!   I didn't have parm, so I added some mozz and Italian breadcrumbs to the cheese mixture, and eyeballed the milk to the consistency I wanted. Also, I added about 1/2t garlic salt to the sauteed green onions.

This is a five star recipe for adding    spinach to a meal in such a  flavorful way but definitely needs more spices. I added, mushrooms, garlic and Tastefully  Simple seasonings I had in my cupboard. Thanks for sharing a great basic recipe.

I used a few suggestions - pounded out the chicken breast and added 3 cloves of garlic.  I also used shredded (not grated) parmesan, which I enjoyed.  The chicken was moist and I loved it, but it was admittedly bland.  I'd recommend using more italian seasoning, salt, and pepper, if not adding your own twist.  But definitely a good recipe to play with.

This was good.  Adding bread crumbs to the parmesan made the crust of the chicken gave good texture...a nice crunch. Also why use frozen produce when fresh is best?  I bought fresh spinach chopped it up and added it to green onion during last minute of cooking and continued cooking spinach until it was almost limp.  Delicious.

The italian seasoning mixed with the cheese had a wonderful aroma, however once the dish was assembled and eaten it seemed to be lacking something in flavor.  I found it really just bland.  I think bacon might add a nice contrast.  If I make this again I will add bacon.

I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, and was terribly nervous about it until enough stirring finally wilted the spinach and made the sauce the right consistency. So it can be done. Although it says to lightly coat with flour, my advice would be to make sure the coat is even, and to let it brown nicely. The recipe is a little bland without the peppers, so if you omit them, make sure you use a good substitute.

This recipe is amazing! I made it for the first time when my 9 year old daughter had a friend over. I was worried since I wasn't sure how the younger kids would like it. Well, they loved it! My daughter's friend asked for seconds! My one year old loved it too! As did my picky-eating husband! 

I'm making it again tonight and I cannot wait. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It is delicious, easy, and a crowd pleaser!

This was just okay.  I followed the recipe exactly, other than adding a little garlic, and if I make it again, would only do so with some modifications.  If I make again, I will pound the breasts and add some bread crumbs to the coating.  I'd also add more seasoning as it was a little bland and make more of the spinach mixture.

This one just didn't do it for me, we all ate it but I won't be making again.  The only change I made was to put all the cheese and seasoning in the sauce instead of rolling the chicken in it.  Just seemed like and unnessecary step.  Also, I've come to the conclusion I dislike oregano except in a red sauce.

This is a good basic recipe, but since I had no green onions on hand, I sauteed about 3 cups of diced eggplant, 1/2 cup of mushrooms, and some fresh spinach instead.   To do this, I used more butter/margarine since the quantity of vegetables was larger,  and finished by baking as called for.  I also used chicken breast cutlets in place of the chicken breasts, much thinner and taster. Making is this way turns it into a one-dish meal, with vegetables and meat combined.

We love creamed spinach in our house so this was a perfect recipe to try.  The only additions I made were to add garlic to the spinach mixture and I topped each piece of chicken with a slice of provel cheese before spooning on the spinach and baking.  Will definitely make again.

Very tasty!  After reading the reviews I added 2 minced garlic cloves to the green onions sauteed in butter.  I also mixed panko crumbs with the freshly grated parmesan.  Used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Pounded the chicken breasts a little to make them just a tiny bit thinner.  Splashed white wine into the sauce to thin it a bit.  It was absolutely delicious!  Great recipe-easy to prepare and was enjoyed by all.

The first time I made this there wasn't enough spinach so I doubled it the next time and it was perfect. Very good chicken.

Loved this recipe. We did not think this was too bland at all.  However,  we added a clove of minced garlic to the green onions.  Other than that followed the recipe.  Will make again though using fresh spinach I think would be better for us.  Just not too fond of the texture of frozen.  That aside, we loved the flavor.

This recipe is great, I added about 4 cloves of fresh chopped garlic to the onions when they were cooking. My husband LOVED it.  This was easy to cook and easy clean up. Will be something we have on a regular basis.

WONDERFUL !!!  This recipe was outstanding.  I don't know where the "bland" reviews came from, my family thought it was very tastey.  None of us like spinach very much, in fact we never eat it, but this recipe makes it very good.   I served it with angel hair pasta and put some of the extra sauce on top.  I did double the recipe, and added garlic and hot pepper flakes as some other reviewers had done.  I will make this again, may even try it some time with shrimp or pork chops !!  Thanks for the recipe.

Loved it. Put chicken in oven for 15 min before topping with spinach mixture as already suggested. Sprayed chicken with olive oil. Added sliced mushrooms, reg onion, nutmeg, garlic, salt and pepper to sauce.  Used 16 oz bag of spinach and one pint whipping cream thickened with 2 tbls flour mixed in quarter cup of water. High calorie but worth it for a special occasion.

This was delicious!!! I used a yellow onion instead of green onions, and also added two cloves of garlic along with the onion. Instead of butter I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Light. This tasted like it was a very fattening dish, yet with the skim milk and the ICBINB I think it was pretty healthy. I was also concerned with the chicken drying out, but it was very moist and juicy. Definitely a keeper.

I doubled the recipe for three people because I wanted leftovers for lunch but everyone loved it so much that I don't have anything left today.  I added garlic to the spinach mixture like other reviews suggested and instead of skim milk I used plain soymilk - other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing!!!

I made this for some friends we had over, and doubled the recipe.  It wasn't enough.  Everyone raved about it, and asked for seconds.  It is very simple to prepare, and I like that it is a tasty way to add some greens to my children's diet!

I made this exactly as directed for a family holiday gathering and it was a major, major hit.  The other competing dish was "World's Best Lasagna" (also on Allrecipes) and this was an easy tie in popularity.  I personally thought it was a little bland, but the dinner company couldn't stop raving (mabye I just couldn't taste it because I had been smelling it in the kitchen).  Anyway, great recipe and will probably make again at some point.

I loved this recipe! I didn't have Italian seasoning so instead I added 3/4 teaspoon each of marjoram, rosemary, thyme, basil, oregeno, and parsley. I like a lot of spices, and it kept it from being bland, as I noticed in some of the other reviews. I also used more Parmesan than was called for. I will definitely be making this again!

The flavor of the chicken was bland but if I could only rate the spinach, I'd give that 5 stars!  The spinach was fabulous!!!   I also added garlic to the spinach and doubled it.  It was nice with the chicken but the chicken itself, was missing something, hence the 3 stars.

OK, I hate it when people change the original recipe on the first try and comment on it but I have to admit I just commited the crime I hate most - I followed the recipe to the T but then at the very end, had a bottle of white wine opened and thought to myself I bet that would really enhance the flavors a little - now I did not add much, just a few drops on each side of the chicken - not on top and yes, it WAS VERY GOOD!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a really good recipe! I loved the creamy spinach, but I might add a little feta to it next time. The only thing I noticed was that it took much longer to bake than the recipe called for. Maybe from all stuff on top? Wasn't sure.

I have to say that I've tried many recipes from this site, usually with good results.  This was not one of them.   I followed the recipe exactly. anyways... the chicken was bland, and the spinach was not much better.  It  definitely needed something, maybe garlic, I don't know. won't make again!!

Delicious. Smells great while you're cooking it. I used fresh instead of frozen spinach and that worked very well. Based on other reviewer's comments I added salt to the parmesan mix and the sauce to add some flavor. If you think of it far enough in advance you could also marinate the chicken in Itallian dressing for a few hours or more beforehand and that would add a lot of flavor.

I really enjoyed this recipe even though I screwed it up. Instead of using 1/2 of the 10 oz of frozen chopped spinach I used the whole box. To save it, I double the sauce. It still turn ed out to taste very good. I got to try this recipe again.

This was delicious! The chicken was so juicy (chicken almost always turns out dry when I cook). Only change I made was adding about 1/2 T garlic salt. Next time I'll add mushrooms like some of the other reviews suggest.

Great, simple dish. I changed it up a bit and fried the chicken on each side before I baked it -- it reduces the baking time and adds a nice crust to the chicken. I also breaded it a bit. The parmesan-spinach sauce works well, especially with a bit of garlic added to it. My recommendation is to serve this chicken over spaghetti, with an ample amount of the spinach sauce to put onto the spaghetti as well. This recipe goes well with Caesar salad and garlic bread.

This is great if you follow all the other reviewers’ suggestions...double the sauce and add fresh garlic and plenty of spices, and mix in some bread crumbs with the parmesan cheese mixture.  I skipped the green onion and used yellow onion instead.  It isn't pretty, but it sure is tasty.

This was absolutely delicious, and my kids ate it too!  The only change I made was to use fresh baby spinach instead of frozen.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this last night for my gf and a friend. They absolutely loved it! Only change I made was to double the sauce and add some salt, pepper and garlic as others had suggested. A friend said, "it's the best tasting healthy dish I've ever had"

I really like this dish.   I do agree with other reviewers that the chicken is bland by itself but if you leave the spinach on the chicken and eat them together to get the full flavor combo it is wonderful.   Very easy to put together.

I was so excited to try this recipe since so many people liked it and it was a good way to get in some good vitamins!  I doubled the sauce part, but didn't have parmesan cheese, so rolled the breasts in italian seasoned bread crumbs.  The consistency of the sauce was fine, but the dish was quite BLAND.  I don't know if it was b/c of the cheese substitution or not, so instead of giving it 1 or 2 stars I'll give it 3.

This is one of my favorite meals off all-recipes.  It was so easy and delicious.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I didn't have green onions or pimento on hand, so i used regular onion and red pepper.  Turned out delicious.  My company also raved about it and requested i print her out the recipe too.

I made some minor changes based on what I had on hand.  Used yellow onion instead of green, fresh spinach, and roasted red peppers in place of the pimento.  My husband loved it!  Served with mashed red potatoes.  It was really easy and good!

Excellent recipe and so easy to make.  I used the Italian Seasonings (that you use to make Italian dressing in a cruet) and I thought that it was perfect.  I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen.

I changed this recipe a little, but the result was wonderful!  I doubled the sauce and put it over noodles, and I used fresh spinach as others suggested.  Then I added garlic, salad supreme seasoning, salt, pepper and 1 T of white wine to the sauce.  My husband doesn't even like spinach, but he thought this was delicious!  My daughter loved the chicken, but was turned off by the spinach.  I'll be making this again anyway for sure!  Thanks for the great recipe Kathy!

I used about 4 chicken breast tenderlions and doubled the flour, milk, spinach, and used fresh chives instead of the pimento peppers (didn't have any).  I served it over brown rice.  We prefer more vegetables than meat.  We really liked the recipe.

Although I added garlic, as one person suggested, this recipe didn't have a lot of taste.  I was thinking that nutmeg might be a spice to add to the spinach mixture.  My husband suggested using a swiss cheese instead of parmesan.  I liked the textures and the ease or preparation so will probably try it again -- but with some variations.

This is a fantastic, low-fat, lots of flavor recipe!  In fact, you won't even know it's low fat!  The only thing I added was garlic salt and I used shallots instead of green onions.   I also omitted the pimento peppers and it didn't taste like it was missing anything.  My husband gives this recipe 5 STARS!  : )

This is a delicious chicken dish.  I made the recipe pretty much as it directed.  I cut the 3 chicken breasts in half and pounded them a little thinner because they were very large.  I also used fresh spinach and just dumped it in with the sauce.  It wilted down right away.  I didn't have pimentos but I used roasted red peppers instead.

So yummy!   I made a couple of substitutions.  I used heavy whipping cream and a sweet red pepper instead of skim milk and pimentos.  Used more fresh Parmesan cheese and I used fresh cut spinach.  So delicious!  Family loved it!

This was an excellent meal with a few tweaks to increase flavor!  I added a little salt and a 1/2 cup of shredded Parmesan cheese to the spinach mixture while it was cooking.  I also sprinkled in a little salt to the cheese mixture that is used for the chicken coating.  It wasn’t to make it “salty” it was to help those flavors come together and pop!!!!  I used ALOT of the spinach mix on top of the chicken so we had a substantial amount of veggies with each bite.  MY HUSBAND LOVED IT :)

I added garlic powder to the Italian seasonings & Parmesan for more flavor.  Also I caramelized the onions for more flavor and half way through baking I added slices of Provalone cheese.  This was a great dish!  Oh yeah, 6 chicken breasts won't fit into an 8x8" pan so just use a 9x13".

This is now my favorite meal to make. Well to eat because to make takes a lot of time but so worth it. First, I've never used pimentos. Not sure if they're for flavor or color but I use red bell pepper instead. I took the suggestion and sauteed fresh garlic in the rue and added fresh mushrooms. I doubled the milk and flour.  Put in 9x13 covered for 30, uncovered for 30. The chicken comes out so juicy and delicious. Huge hit.

I made this tonight--my half chicken, my husband's (who is a vegetarian) tofu.  I is really tasty.  Basically, it its creamed spinach baked over chicken/tofu.  I did sprinkle with extra parmesan.  I would do just the spinach portion as a side dish.

The spinach parmesan on top was a great idea, but it is missing some pizazz.  We added salt while eating which helped, but it was still missing something.  I will not make it again.

This was not as good as it could be with more seasoning. The chicken was moist and tender but it just needs more flavor. Not near enough Italian seasoning for 6 large chicken breasts.

Had high hopes for this, but definitely will not be making again. The skim milk did not make the spinach creamy enough and the taste overall was bland.

I used fresh spinach instead of frozen for better flavor. I wilted it in a sauce pan first. Otherwise followed directions as listed. Very flavorful and healthy.

I made a few changes so can't give this recipe five star.  These are the changes I made:
Only used two large breasts 
Didn't have grated parmesan but did have shredded so I put some thru my mini chopper, it came out crumbly.
Used more Italian seasoning after reading some reviews. 
Didn't have pimento so I used chopped pickled red peppers (homemade).
Doubled the sauce amount.
End result was very good.  Will make again.

This came out ssooo good! Yes with a few alterations such as there's no WAY it was fitting in an 8x8. We made it in 10x13 and substituted red bell pepper for the pimentos. We also added sauteed fresh garlic and mushrooms to the spinach mix like others suggested. It was baked at 350 for 30 min covered 30 min uncovered. The chicken came out SO MOIST AND DELICIOUS. WOW GOOD!!

I made a mistake an put the raw chicken in the pan before dredging in the coating.  So I just sprinkled it on top and continued with the rest of the recipe as written.  I also used fresh spinach, which I just chopped up a bit.  This turned out very good!  A mild flavor, but not boring.  I put a little more parmesan cheese on top.   I'll make it again.  Thank you!

This was fabulous! I used the suggestions of adding sour cream to the milk, using fresh instead of frozen spinach, adding garlic to the butter and green onions, and brining the chicken breasts first for an hour. Moist, tender, and flavorful!

This was very tasty and moist.  I did make more sauce  since I used 9 chicken breasts.  Some people really liked it and some people thought it was to much spinach.  I guess you really have to like spinach to eat this.  I followed the recipe but I did add garlic to the butter and onion.  Also more italian seasoning.  I would make it again.

Very tasty spin on chicken. The portions were very off for my chicken breasts. I tripled the recipe and it coated 3 breasts, but only covered 2. I substituted pulverized crispy rice cereal for the flour and red onions instead of white onions and pimentos. I also added garlic and onion powder to coating for taste. Definitely will make it again.

I didn't  have skim milk so I used almond milk and fresh spinach instead of frozen. It was juicy, tender and full of flavor. I was impressed how much flavor the Italian seasoning added.  Yummy!! It's going in the rotation!

This is a very tasty chicken dish. I did tweak it a little bit. The cheese mixture didn't look like enough to coat the chicken, so I saved it and put all of it on top of the dish before putting it in the oven. I sprinkled salt, pepper and additional Italian seasoning over the chicken. I doubled the sauce because I really like spinach. I also added fresh garlic to the sauce because garlic is wonderful. Served with a quinoa/brown rice mix. Yummy!

This is very good.  I used thighs rather than chicken breast and I used fresh spinach rather than frozen.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  I was pleasantly surprised with how easy and how good this was.

This was so good, that I made it two nights in a row! I added 2 cloves of garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper to the saute . Very easy to make, but looks like a dish you spent some time on. I'm going to try this topping on portabello mushrooms. The topping alone would be a great side dish. Good day!

This was a delicious way to serve chicken. I doubled the sauce and I also used Swiss Chard that I blanched from my garden this fall. I will make it again for sure.

This was amazing - we did not have spinach so i used frozen kale instead.. i was scared it would be bitter but it was creamy and had a little nutty taste.. amazing!!

i also used roasted red peppers instead of pimento peppers.. 

loved it!

I did make changes. I added a few bread crumbs to the coating and started the chicken in the oven while I made the sauce.  I used fresh spinach and sauteed it with a small onion and some garlic.  I set it aside and made the white sauce with a little Parmesan and  double the recipe. Added the spinach to the sauce and poured over the chicken. I baked for 15 mins. more. Delicious.

We enjoyed this dish.  As with other review, I made a few alteration in the recipe to avoid bland chicken and I added sour cream with the mild in the spinach.

I liked the idea adding spinach, the sauce is a basic white sauce so I already knew how to make that.  I always cut up my chicken into chunks, makes it wayyyy easier to cook (unless you want to be fancy and keep em whole, lol).  I did not have pimento so that was not added.  I also added fresh basil from my plant.

We  have made this 2 times. We used fresh spinach each time  and cooked it in oil in the wok before mixing in the onion/flour mixture. Used about 2/3 of a 1 lb. package of fresh baby spinach. Served over herbed brown rice. Fantastic!

Super easy.  I used the whole box of spinach and added a little more cheese- we love cheese!  I ran out of it.

OMG this is really good.  I used the breasts still attached to the bone and seared it in hot olive oil after dredging in bread crumbs that I added onion powder and Italian seasoning to.  Then I put a layer of parmesan cheese on top and baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  Add butter to the chicken pan and sauté the onion and 2 cloves chopped garlic.  Throw in the flour AND any remaining bread crumbs, add  a combination of milk and sour cream to equal milk requirement, and then add fresh,  wilted and drained (10 oz for 3 breasts) spinach and stir.  Pile spinach on top of breasts and coat generously with more Parma.  Return to oven and cook for 15-20 minutes.   Adding the chicken drippings and seasoned breadcrumbs to the spinach really puts it over the top. Really delishious!!

Surprisingly delicious for how simple it is.  I did make minor changes: double the parmesan and seasoning, one-third cup is not enough for 6 chicken breasts... maybe I wasn't supposed to coat both sides.  I added garlic and 1/4 t. of crushed red pepper as others suggested.  I used 8 oz. of spinach, and I had leftover heavy cream which I used in place of the milk... maybe the cream is why the dish was so delicious.  Baked for 40 minutes.  Will make again.

Per some reviews I added some garlic, additional italian spices and pounded the chicken to an even thickness first.  I really liked this.  It was  just a little fancy, got some much needed spinach into our meal, and was a nice change from the normal baked chicken breasts.  However my family disagreed :(
They were not fans at all.

I made this for dinner with few friends ! was absolutely fantastic!...The only step ill change is to stir the flour in the milk before stirring it in the saucepan or else it can create little balls of flour! not pleasant...otherwise its a favourite

Definitely needed to boost the sauce ingredients. Used 1 1/2 times the amounts of all items except the chicken, and twice the amount of spice. Added 2 cloves of garlic, minced, and a few sliced crimini mushrooms for flavour. Took closer to 45 minutes to get the breasts cooked through. Last but not least, there was no way I could get 6 full breasts of chicken into a little 8x8 as suggested. There must be a breed of chicken I am not familiar with, lol :).

My family really enjoyed this.  I added 1/2 T minced garlic and used fresh spinach.  Served over pasta.  When I make it again, I will use more spinach and double the sauce.

I made this last night, taking into account the first reviewers suggestions and it was OMG Delicious.  My husband raved about it.  ANd the chicken stays so moist.  I did cook the chicken ahead of time in the oven (not all the way) and THEN added the spinach topping and cooked some more. This was very, very good.  It really needs the addition of garlic and sour cream.

After reading the other reviews I made 3 alterations to this recipe. I added salt & pepper to the sauce, used 4 cups of fresh spinach and before coating the pounded chicken breasts in the cheese mix I dipped it in bottled Italian salad dressing. The result was very  good but it loses a star because of the alterations.

added garlic to the spinach.  used sundried tomatoes instead of the pimento.  easily quadrupled the Italian herb blend.  served with garden tomatoes with fresh basil and olive oil, and crusty bread.  will be making this again!

Excellent! My husband loved this.  I doubled everything but the chicken breast. Breasts I had came 3/package.  I sliced them into 6 thin pieces.  Used italian breadcrumbs w/the cheese to coat the chix.  Dipped them in egg w/a bit of s&p and italian seasoning & milk before coating.  Browned them.  Steamed 10 oz fresh spinach to use.  Added pinch cayenne.  Used same cast iron deep pan to steam spinach (then set aside), brown chix and put everything in oven.  (Used other saucepan to make sauce - flour/milk doesn't work in cast iron.) added approx 2 clove garlic to onions and 1 pkge fresh baby bella mushrooms and then sauteed. Added about 1/4+ cup peppers instead of tablespoons.  Used more onion than called for too.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe, but I knew it would need extra seasoning for my tastes, especially as I wasn’t using any pimento.  I added a chopped garlic clove and minced red onion that I needed to use.  I had a package of shredded Italian cheeses so I used that instead of just parmesan.  Also, is always my habit, I cut the chicken breasts into medallions, pounded them to a half inch thick, and then brined them for one hour to make sure they didn’t dry out during baking.  They came out perfect.  This is one dish that will be on my regular rotation.  Added note:  I’ve also made this with the swiss chard from my garden.  I simply chopped it and added it to the milk mixture until wilted.  Delicious!

Fantastic chicken recipe!  Easy to make, and turned out great.  I added a couple of cloves of garlic, and used about a half cup of sour cream with a half cup of milk.  Thanks for a great recipe, with ingredients we keep on hand!

The chicken was very moist, but I agree with other reviewers, it is lacking something.  I added garlic, but I wasn't quite satisfied.  If someone comes up with something, please share!  I served with rice, but will serve with pasta next time.

This was good. I had to use thighs, I just browned them and grated the cheese on top before putting the spinach mixture on top. I ended up using more cheese than was called for and also added garlic. The cooking time had to be adjusted for me but it turned out good.

This recipe was great...fast and easy to prepare, looked awesome and tasted even better!  I added extra spices to the parmesan and white sauce...italian seasonings, garlic, soy sauce, salt and pepper...just kept tasting and throwing stuff in until it tasted right.  Threw in some mushrooms and used fresh spinach leaves.  Used a combo of green and white onions.  Added some panko breadcrumbs to the parmesan mixture...liked the crunchiness it added.  Will definitely make again!

OMG this was awesome. The only thing I did was add bread crumbs to the parmesan mixture, which is a must. It gave the spinach this nice crunchy texture.

Was looking for something delicious and low-calorie to make.  This definetely hit the spot.  I excluded the green onions and pimientos because i didnt have them on hand, it was still good.

This is a new favorite in my house --even with my "Chicken again??" husband. I add some sour cream to the milk and up the red pepper and garlic factors as well. Last time we tried it with goat cheese instead of parm -- EXCELLENT!!

My family loved this. Not only delicious, but a nice presentation as well. The only change I made was to add some salt, pepper, & garlic to the spinach mixture for a little more flavor.  I also substituted chopped red pepper for the pimentos which I sauteed w/ the onion. Thanks for a great recipe. I can't wait to have company over and serve this for dinner!

This was a great recipe. Family really enjoyed it, even those who don't like spinach. It was a bit bland though, I'd add more onion and garlic powder to the spinach mixture next time.

Excellent recipe with some tweaks.  I followed the advice on one of the other postings and sauteed mushrooms, bell pepper with the green onion.  Also added some cayenne pepper and salt/pepper and garlic as well.  Very good!

This was really good.  I was worried at first with how it looked, but it came together quite well.  Amazingly enough the kids didn't hate it either.  I think that next time I make it I will add a bit more cheese to it.  Maybe also some breadcrumbs.

This recipe was very easy and it was also pretty yummy. I didn't have spinich in the house, so I left it out, but I did had a handful of cooked cripsy bacon to the butter & scallions and it gave the mix a nice taste. Before baking the chicken I topped each chicken breast with a little fresh shredded parm cheese & some red pepper flakes. It came out really well. I will be making this recipe again for sure.

Excellent recipe!  I breaded and browned the chicken before baking it.  I also added finely chopped celery to the spinach.  This was a delicious, healthy meal.  My family requested that it be added to my regular dishes!

I loved this recipe!  I have a husband who is a very picky eater.  He thought this was good, too and that's saying a lot.  Since I didn't have boneless chicken, I used bone-in breast and thighs.  I didn't have the pimentos so I left those out altogether.  I did add mushrooms to the spinach and sauce.  I also used fresh, baby spinach instead of the frozen spinach.    I made couscous to serve as a side with the chicken which worked out very nicely . . . good combination.  The only thing I will do next time I make this recipe is to double the spinach and sauce so as to have enough to use over the couscous.  Thanks for such a tasty and easy recipe!

I did some tweaks to this recipe and still didn't like it much.  If I were to make it again (and didn't have tons of other recipes to try), I'd use fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I couldn't stand it with frozen, and thus our leftovers sit...

Delicious!  I added my own seasonings, used 2 packs of spinach, and substituted sun dried tomatoes for the pimento. I served it with brown rice on the side.   Thanks for the great recipe, everyone loved it!

I'd give it 5 stars, but my kids didn't like it (too much spinach).  This was a SUPER EASY weeknight recipe.  I served it with wild rice. For leftovers, I cut up the chicken & mixed it with the rice. The only thing I would add next time is garlic, as suggested earlier. A definite keeper!

I added all the extras people suggested, but found the chicken to be bland.
  Maybe put the chicken on top of the spinach mixture so the chicken can keep it's spice and cheese?
  Not my favorite.

My husband and I loved this dish.  I did make a few changes to suit my family's tastebuds though.  I didn't use green onions but added some onion flakes. I also doubled the sauce amount and added some sour cream, garlic, seasoning salt, and cayenne pepper.

I made this for dinner last night for my husband and kids (three of the pickiest eaters on the planet) and braced myself for complaints.  You know what?  They all LOVED it!  It's easy & fast enough to make for a weeknight family dinner, and fancy & impressive enough to serve to company. Thanks so much for this delicious recipe, I will make it again and again.
P.S. I served along side spaghetti & sauce. The marinara was a great compliment to the chicken.

I was disappointed with the results even after I doctored it up based on the suggestions of other reviewers. It was still bland even after adding salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the cheese mixture, as well as 2 minced garlic cloves in with the onions. I doubled the sauce, but I think what's missing is some salt and maybe garlic in the sauce. We still have some left over, so I might add capers to give it some life.

Tried this exactly as described and was not impressed with results.  It was VERY bland.  Might be quick, but needs SOMETHING.  It's a good base, but you'll need to spice it up.

This was good.  I thought it was good,  but not a "5" star good. Thank you for your recipe.

This is a good recipes, but it needs a little tweaking.  Next time I will definatley put much more seasonging on the chicken and in the sauce.  It has a lot of potential, but is bland if you make as is.

This is a really good way to eat spinach if you don't care for it by itself.  Thanks for the recipe. I didn't have any pimentos but it still was delicious.

This was good....especially for being a "light" dish. I didn't have green onions so I used yellow onions and doubled the sauce. I also didn't have pimentos so I used chopped black olives instead. I rated this four stars because the chicken was a bit bland for me, even though I seasoned them with salt and pepper before coating them with the cheese mixture. I might experiment with seasonings the next time I make this but this one is definitly going into my recipe box. Oh, the sauce is also good when served over steamed broccoli, cauliflower & carrot mix.

After reading all the great reviews I was really excited to try this recipe.  I made the mistake of using the whole box of spinach instead of just half.  It wasn't bad but overpowered the sauce a little.  The chicken itself was very bland.  If I make this again, the chicken will need doctoring and the sauce will need something else to give it some oomph, maybe garlic salt.

Wonderful dish- me and my husband both loved it. I used one whole package of spinach and increased the milk and cheese. Sometimes baked chicken can be a bit dry- but this was very juicy! I will definitely make this again.

Really great dish.  I used fresh greens (steamed first)--the chicken was very moist!  I gave it a 5 star; my boys gave it a 3-4 rating.  I will make it again to be sure!

My family and I loved this recipe.  It was so good and seemed to be very healthy.  I would make this recipe again.  But I'd add more parmesan cheese to the recipe; probably double the amount listed in the recipe.

This recipe was great! My boyfriend and I aren't very big spinach lovers but this was awesome! I followed the others' comments; more milk, mushrooms, pepper, and salt. The chicken I used were breasts that are pre-packaged in italian marinade, which defiently fit so well with this recipe. I give this 5 stars and my boyfriend gives it 'Simply Gourment!'

This recipe is in my favorites section. I also prefer thin breasts and I omit the pimento. Absolutely delicious. (For me, the green onions are a must!)

This recipe is pretty good, but a full sized chicken breast is a little thick for me.  I tried it the second time with thin sliced breasts and it was fantastic!

I am a student so I don't have much time to cook. This recipe was excellent though! It was quick, tasty and the ingredients are common, so it doesn't require that much money at the grocery store :). I used cayenne pepper and garlic powder in the chicken seasoning (like others suggested) and omitted the pimento peppers; it was very good! I will make this often.

Bland.  Bland.  Bland.  Very dissappointing!  My husband gives it 3 stars and I give it 1 star.  He's not one for spinach but he liked it in this dish.  The only changes I made was I doubled the sauce as one of the reviews suggested and I added mozzarella cheese on top.

Easy, delicious and looks great too!  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen (which worked great) and the only other change I would make would be to double the sauce/spinach because it was so good and I wished there were more.  Great find!

My parents came over for dinner and were impressed by this version of chicken parm. I love spinach. It really made the recipe rich; almost too rich. I may cut the spinach down a bit next time.

Excellent! My family really enjoyed it-especially my 9yr old son! Next time I might try using more Italian seasoning(I used the dry Italian salad seasoning you mix in a cruet jar). Next thing I would do is double the recipe so my husband can bring leftovers to work!

Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe! I also used fresh spinach and left out the peppers (didn't have any)and it was still terrific. The only thing I didn't like was the dish came out really watery (maybe bc of the fresh spinach) so I made some more of the milk/flour/butter/green onion sauce on the stove and poured it over the top with some more parm and salt/pepper. Yum!

Delicious! The only thing I changed was using fresh spinach instead of frozen, and I used red pepper instead of pimentos (dont have any). Everyone loves this recipe, have made it several times over the past couple of months and no one is sick of it yet!

This was awesome- made it for my roommates and everyone loved it! I made 4 pieces of chicken, doubled the spinach mixture and used red pepper, garlic, and green onions-no italian seasoning, so used a "classic blend" and basil! Definitely will make again! We couldn't believe it was so healthy!

Tasty.  I quartered three breasts (1lb) and flattened them a little bit before pressing them in the seasoned parmesan.  I didn't know if the spinach mixture would keep the chicken moist enough, so I added a half cup of broth to the baking dish.  Served with red potatoes and french cut green beans.

Even got my daughter to eat the spinach.  But my son wouldn't try it.  I loved it, the spinach has great flavor.  And it's very easy to make.

We really enjoyed this recipe!  My husband isn't a big spinach fan, but he said this recipe was a keeper!  I used a meat thermometer, and the chicken turned out perfect.  Will definitely make again!

Wow!  Awesome change of pace for baked chicken!  Everyone in the family rated it 5 stars!  I used fresh spinach, steamed and chopped (because I had it leftover from making salad) and left out the pimento (didn't have any on hand.)  Served with fettucini I served up with garlic butter and parm. cheese.  Thanks Kathy - terrific recipe!!!

I prepared this for my wife after one of her aerobic workouts.  She loved it!  After bragging to the ladies at the tupperware party a couple of nights later, I have a very high rating.  Easy, delicious, and the leftovers were excellent.

Very tasty!  I've been trying to find a way to get more leafy greens in our diet and this did the trick.  My husband said this one is defintely a "keeper"!
