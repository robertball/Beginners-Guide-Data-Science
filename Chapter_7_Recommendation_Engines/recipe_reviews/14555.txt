Excellent side dish for lots of different entres!  I substituted green bell peppers for the eggplant and used one white and one red onion, but everyting else by the recepe. I used a grilling basket on my BBQ so the the smaller pieces didn't fall through the grate.  Rave reviews from dinner guests.  Now I crave this veggie dish all the time.

I tried this recipe last night on my charcoal grill accompanied by grilled chicken. I placed the vegetable pieces on skewers and slowly cooked them on the grill, basting frequently with teriyaki sauce. The taste was delicious! We will definetly try this again!

I have made these several times now.  They are very good.  We vary the vegetables based on what is in season.

Fantastic! I didn't have all the vegetables listed, but it doesn't matter.  I added a couple of hot peppers from the garden and this gave it a little more kick.  The combination of smoking and the terryaki sauce really brings out the flavor.
