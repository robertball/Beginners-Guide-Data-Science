I m.ade the recipe exactly like it told me to but my first batch was very flat and runny so I added more flour and i turned my oven down to 325 degrees. The cookies did take longer to bake but they were the right kind of chewy cookies you would love. Definitely the perfect cookie for the peanut butter chocolate fans!! A big hit in our house

Mmmmm...I made these this afternoon to bring to a Bible study. I live about 6,000 ft. above sea level, so the high altitude directions were really helpful and accurate. These were delicious and I came home with an empty pan! The only changes I made were to add a little more vanilla and chocolate and peanut butter chips. I also melted creamy peanut butter and extra chocolate chips to make a quick, decadent frosting. I will definitely be keeping this one!
