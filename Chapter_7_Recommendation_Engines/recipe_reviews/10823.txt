I love these! I did find them a little bit flat, so as suggested, I replaced ALL of the soda with powder and the results were amazing! Tablespoon sezed cookies work, I think, the best. And their small size does add to their "poofy-ness".

These cookies came out absolutely amazing!  Were easy and quick, a good classical chocolate chip cookie.  I read a previous person's suggestion to replace the baking soda with baking powder to avoid flatness, and decided to use 1 t baking soda and only 1/2 t baking powder, to make the cookies rise just a little.  Came out perfect!  When I didn't burn the sheet ;-)

I've been making these cookies for several years. Everyone LOVES my cookies. I love to see the look on my friends faces when they take the first bite.  These taste nothing like the usual toll house cookie recipe.  The dough freezes very well and my kids make these all of the time.  You can also replace the chocolate chips with toffee bits, (the kind without chocolate)  they are to die for.

I just finish making these and they turned out great. The only thing I changed was baking powder instead of baking soda as recommended by other reviewers. The only thing that didn't come out right was the the amount I got. The recipe says it will make about 48 tsp size cookies, well I got over 200 using a tsp. Not that I am complaining though cause these will disappear faster then it took to make them lol.

I have made this recipe as a Christmas gift to a co-worker for the past couple of years.  This year, I decided to try Cooks Illustrated "Crisp Chocolate Chip Cookies," thinking they would be better.  Guess what?  Not so much.  Not at all, in fact.  She was disappointed and would rather have had The Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookie (baked for 13 minutes, crisp).  Just thought you'd like to know!

I was very happy with this cookie! The chips melted awsome and it had just a little bit of a nice shortbread taste. The only thing I could say is that after a few days they become compleate rocks so better eat them fast..... Its hard not to though!

After being a bit disappointed with the recipe on the bag of chocolate chips that I used last time, I tried this one which was actually easier.  I was worried about this whole "flat cookie" issue, so after halving the recipe (which still made over 3 dozen regular sized cookies), I used 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda - don't ask me why those measurements, I apparently misread the recipe - and they turned out great!  I also used soy milk and unsalted butter since that's what I had.  They certainly weren't "too flat" or even noticeably flatter than any other cookie I've made.   The whole "flat cookie" thing was really a non-issue for me with this recipe.  They are great even without the chocolate chips, since my last scrape around the bowl yielded a chip-less cookie.  EDIT:  Three days later, the cookies were still moist and yummy!

Very good!  The cookies were a little flat for my liking, but the consistency was nice.

This is my first review on this site but felt it was necessary since I am so happy with these cookies.  The next day they are still that chewy soft yumminess that I have been searching for and crispy edges my husband always asks for.  They are thin but I like that about them too.  I did use butter instead of shortening and 1/2 cup white sugar instead of the full amount of brown but that is just what I had.  Definitely a keeper!

These cookies had absolutely wonderful flavor, but even with switching half of the baking soda to baking powder still came out very flat. Will definitely keep this recipe to try to tweak it a little to make cookies not so flat. If you like flat cookies this recipe would be wonderful.

I didn't like this recipe as it was originally written. I thought they were greasy and they came out flat. I tried it again using butter softened at room temp (not in the micowave, it makes it too soft!) rather than shortening and I sifted the dry ingredients before adding. They came out sooooo much better!

Not good. Not the worst I've ever had but close. The dough tastes like shortening & chocolate chips.

Great recipe - very easy to make too. Cookies were chewy even after a couple of days.  I made them nut-free. They were a huge hit with the family - I can see these being a lunchbox favourite!!  Thanks for sharing...

These cookies were absolutely delicious!!!!  EXACTLY what I have been searching for!  I have them in the oven now, I almost ate the whole first pan before the second pan was even out of the oven!  I followed everybody else's suggestion and used baking powder instead of soda.  They are perfect, I am copying this recipe into my binder right now!

I made these the other night.  Even after reading the other reviews I stayed true to the recipe.  Baked them for 8 minutes and they turned out AWESOME.  I made two batches; one with chocolate chips and pecan pieces and the other with white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts.  They were exactly like two entirely different cookie recipes.  But they were freaking awesome.  Still are.  Not as chewy as they were when they were warm but they are still soft.  One thing I found that helped was keep the dough as chilled as possible while you are baking them.  My dough was never runny nor did my cookies come out flat so I don't know what everyone else did wrong.  Great recipe.. even my husband said they were awesome and he is not so easily impressed.  :-)

It's true, this is an excellent recipe.  These are probably the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made (just in time to give them with milk to Santa!).  I didn't substitute baking soda with powder as many others did, but I DID use self-rising flour instead of all purpose.  This kept them cookie-like but nice and thick.  Bravo to the Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookie!  You live up to your name!

i first made these cookies last year for christmas with my son. it makes a large amount so i ended up freezing some of it, but they were absolutely delicious. when we thawed the left overs it seemed as if they tasted even better than the originals. needless to say we will be making these for santa again this year.

Love this have used it many times. I do use all baking powder than they soda they come out fluffy instead of flat. Makes alot of cookies. The only down side is if they sit for more than a few days they get hard. Also i cook them about 7 mins for the chewy cookies.

i loved and so did the party i served it to. although rather than all brown sugar did half the amount white sugar as well as an extra egg and did leave the batter in the fridge for about 30mins and they didnt have any troubles with sticking to the pan. they were excellent.

I was looking for a new CCC recipe and I found it.  This will make a ton of cookies so I halved the recipe and used real butter. These were moist and yummy. I followed other suggestions and did equal parts baking powder and baking soda. These are really really good.

Excellent - I found my new chocolate chip cookie recipe.  These came out fluffly, chewy and not too sweet.  Chocolate chip is not my favorite, so for me to say it is good...it is really good.

These are BY FAR the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made. My mom made them for co-workers, and I made them to include in Christmas gift bags.  I can't get over how good they are.  My mom followed the recipe exactly, and even though flat, we both agreed they were the most delicious cookies. I'm baking them today, and I used 1/2 t. baking powder and 1 t baking soda.  Although still kinda' flat, who needs 'poofy' when you can have chewy and delicious?!

This recipe was a HUGE disappointment!  I only wanted a few cookies, so I reduced the recipe.  I made the dough, and it smelled and tasted great.  I then started to bake them, and they browned very quickly, but didn't cookie the inside.  Getting them off the cookies sheet was my worst nightmare.  This is by far, the worst chocolate chip cookie recipe ever, and you are MUCH better off using Nestle dough that comes in a tub.  They are much tastier, and less work.  TERRIBLE RECIPE, I'M SORRY!!

I subbed baking powder for baking soda, allergen free margarine for the shortening and halved the recipe. They TASTE GREAT, but they looked exactly the same when they came out of the oven as they did when I dropped them on the pan. I think that's due to the margarine sub.

Great cookie and I loved that the recipe calls for only brown sugar.  I forgot to add salt, and regretted it.

Living in Montana, baking up there can be difficult.  I found that by adding an extra 1/2 cup of flour and omitting the soda and adding the powder will make the cookies softer.

I've used this recipe since I was a teenager, and they always come out so tasty. I saw that some people posted about using baking powder instead of soda because they come out flatter with the powder. Another way to make them fluffy without substituting is to put the cookie dough in the fridge for half an hour before baking, and they come out perfect every time.

Well I baked this and i give them definitely five stars. chewy and crispy probably the best ccc cookie I've made.  I did use 1/2 whole wheat flour, to add more whole grain.  also I did not use 2 T of vanilla I cut it to 2 t., most recipes don't use more than that.  Thank You for the great cookie grams....

Light in texture and delicious. Hubby really liked them. I used butter instead of shortening - didn't want to use partially hydrogenated stuff (not that butter is any healthier...) I read one comment that the cookie seemed rather salty and 2 tsp of salt did seem a bit much, plus baking soda is salty. So I used 1 1/2 tsp. of salt, 1 tsp. of baking powder, and 1/2 tsp. of baking soda. Tasted fine.

This is a great recipe if you like soft, chewy, and sweet. Not the puffed cake like cookie. I love these cookies. I only used 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp baking soda and it worked great. I also only used 1 1/2 Cups brown sugar and 1/2 C white. Next time I make these I will used a little less sugar. Overall I would say these are a good recipe to have on hand.

The texture was chewy and nice. I used a little less sugar than called for--a touch more than 2 cupe, loosely packed. However, I think something went a bit wrong with the salt. I used 2 tspns, but the cookies were strangely salty.

My wife and I baked this cookie and cooked for 12 min. and they came out EXACTLY the way we like them, thin and crispy.  We just tried baking again and this time they came out thick and cakey?  We added extra minutes to no avail; they would not spread out and get thin and crispy as before.  We changed absolutely nothing about this recipe.

When the cookies first came out of the oven, they were so soft and chewy.  After about 20 minutes they became crispy and flat.  I think this was a good cookie but I want to find a thicker chwier cookie.  THanks anyway.

VERY good! I like them soft or crunchy!  I added a tad bit more flour though so they did not run, and used all butter instead of shortning.   These will now be my go to chocolate chip cookies.

These cookies are really yummy! I substituted baking powder for soda like others suggested, and  I also used chocolate chunks instead of chips. Honestly, if they turned out really flat, you probably did something wrong. They did seem a little salty so I will probably use less salt next time. And they need to COMPLETELY cool before you mess with them. They will seem like they aren't done until they are cool and more solid. (I don't mind doughy cookies though!) The texture did seem different, but they still tasted great. Also, use a little less vanilla than the recipe calls for if you don't like vanilla flavoring very much. Overall, great recipe, but you just have to tweak it to your own preferences.

This is an okay recipe.  It is the "Butter Flavor Criso Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookie" recipe doubled.  I made this cookie recipe 20 years ago or so when Butter Flavor Crisco printed it.  It is too strong, as it calls for too much vanilla.  I'm giving 1 star because of lack of originality  and outright plagiarism.

I could taste the baking soda. I hate that. So, I didn't have any eggs. I made the cookies anyway, and they were good. What do eggs provide? I did pick up some eggs. I divided the dough in half and added 1 egg to 1 half of the dough. I cooked 6 cookies. I found that the cookies without the eggs weren't flat in appearance. The cookies with the egg went flat. I felt that I could taste the baking soda more in the batch with egg, than the batch without. I may leave the egg out all the time! I won't make these cookies again. I will try making another recipe, only without the eggs.

This is by FAR the GREATEST recipe !!!!! I used butter instead of the shortening and I used 1 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of baking soda. The cookies were wonderfully soft and had just the right amount of rise in them. I used half the batch with toffee brittle and used the other half with chocolate chips and white chocolate chips. The whole batch made about 60 tablespoon sized cookies. I FINALLY FOUND MY COOKIE DOUGH !!!! Thanks !!!!

This recipe was pretty good. It was a huge temptation to leave the dough alone and not eat it. I usually have to tell her not to sneak little bits of it on her finger, eat it, and then repeat, but the dough was so good she had to keep ME from sneaking the dough!LOL! But somehow me and my daughter managed to get it in the oven without eating it all.

I have made this recipe my own to rave reviews by cookie experts!  I now bake these beauties with from memory and with only a 1/2C measure, a tablespoon and a mixer.  Our favorite variation is to omit the chips!  The texture and flavor of the plain cooked dough alone is divine!

Chocolate chip cookies are comfort food to me, and this recipe delivers a perfect tradtional cookie to satisfy those cravings.  I really like that is relies heavily on brown sugar and shortening (no white sugar in the recipe), to me those two ingredients really make the real chocolate chip cookie taste. This recipe is a keeper!

I am making these right now...probably made close to 4 dozen like recipe says. They are great. The only thing I changed was I used 1 tsp baking powder to 1/2 tsp baking soda because I like my cookies to rise. These are great. My kids and I sampled them a little bit ago. Thumbs up all around. Mine ended up cooking for about 14-16 to so as not be mushy. I'm sure they'll be a hit with the recipients.
Thanks.

This is the worst chocolate chip recipe that I've ever made.  It has way too much flour.  I made a double batch, (we like chocolate chip cookies), but we couldn't eat them.

I brought these cookies to a neighborhood BBQ. Kids & Adults LOVED them. cookies were very moist. I didn't have any nuts, shortening or vanilla. I used butter instead of shortening. In place of vanilla i put 1 Tbsp of hot chocolate mix. Apparently gave the cookies a marshmellow  taste.

Really, really great recipe. I did what was suggested by someone and I used 1 Tsp of baking powder, and 1/2 a Tsp of baking soda instead of just using baking soda, and they turned out perfect.

So not what I expected. I would never make them again. They are flat even after the suggested changes to the baking soda and powder. I even went back and reduced the sugar and added more flour. They have a weird texture that I do not like my cookies to have. I bake all the time and this cookie I would never try again!

A little heavy on the vanilla.  I'd probably cut it to 1 tablespoon.  I used 1 t baking powder and 1/2 t baking soda to end with a great consistency/texture.  Very good!

These didn't really taste that great. The vanilla is overpowering and I like vanilla. There is also an after-taste that I can't really pinpoint either. I'm going to still with other cookie recipes from here.

Have been making these for years and they are my families favorite. I use pecans instead of walnuts just because I love them. They are just as good made without the nuts, which I sometimes do, in case of allergies.

These were awesome! My family doesn't like the cookies on the back of nestle chocolate chips, but they love these! To prevent the flatness,  I just popped the whole cookie sheet (dough and all) in the freeze for about 5 minutes before baking. Wonderful! 9 minutes was perfect!

Great recipe! I tried for the first time today and loved it! I will make this my recipe now.  I was a little surprised that it is made only with brown sugar and then with milk but boy did it prove itself! (I made it this time without nuts but I will try next time. Must get even better with them)

These were really great cookies!  The first time I used the recipe exactly as written (except with Butter) and they didn't 'melt' in the oven and were a little crispy.  Second time I used margarine instead of real butter, only used 3 cups of flour, and used half of the soda and replaced the other half with powder as someone suggested. The second time was a charm- they were perfect and had MANY requests for the recipe! The trick is getting them out of the oven at the perfect time and letting them cool COMPLETELY before trying to handle them.

Though I did not put eggs in mine (I am allergic) these turned out nice and crispy, and my sister looved them. She keeps bugging me to make more, so I must say they are a hit!

This is the recipe doubled from the back of the Butter Crisco tub. Ding-dang do I love it--have used it for years and years, and is the only thing I can say I really bake as "my thing." I *totally* agree that you have to add more flour. The strength of this cookie is that it's more substantial than the Toll House version, which is way too flat and thin for me. The Ultimate cookie is fluffy without being muffin-like. I add flour and sometimes I add even more brown sugar. I also sub M&M candy for the chips. And I add in tons since I don't use the nuts. If the recipe calls for 2 cups of chips and 2 cups of nuts, I just use 4 cups of M&Ms (and no nuts). It's very gourmet looking and tasting. I get rave reviews every time I make it.

Very tasty.  I made a half batch which yielded 3.5 dozen cookies.  I also added milk chocolate toffee bits and milk chocolate candy bar chunks in the place of some of the semisweet chips.  Mmm mmm.

This was a great, easy recipe! I saw a lot of people saying that the cookies came out flat, so I used baking powder instead of baking soda, and they poofed up pretty well. :-)

I like them a lot. The reason I only give 4 stars and not five because I wasn't too pleased with the shortening taste, I could taste it a lot. :( I wonder if I can replace the shortening for something else and If I could I think they would be amazingly good.

I found this cookie recipe today and decided to give it a try based on the other reviews. I, too, used powder instead of soda. Where someone mentioned that the cookie gets rock hard after a couple days, I added something from another cc cookie recipe I use often where they stay moist and chewy for days...a box if vanilla instant pudding. It adds a nice flavor to it too! Great recipe, thanks for posting it!

Nice flavor, but they don't hold up very well.  I followed the recipe exactly but they turned out very flat!  the chocolate chips were twice the height as the rest of the cookie!  Also the butter was separating from the flour because this recipe has so much butter and sugar in it.  I added some cake flour to the rest of the dough I had after first few batches tanked.  This improved the cookies to 100%!  Cake flour is made to support more sugar and fat content than other flours.  These cookies were AMAZING with the extra cake flour!  Next time I make them I think instead of the 3 1/2 cups AP flour I will try 2 c. AP and 2 c. cake flour.  If the batter is still too thin I'll add more cake.  Hope this helps!

Excellent cookie! Better than the recipe on the chocolate chip packaging! The only thing I changed was to add baking powder (part baking soda and part baking powder) as suggested by other reviewers and they turned out great!

My husband is very fussy about his chocolate chip cookies and he said  these were the best he's ever had! I also did as others suggested and substituted baking powder for the soda and the cookies came out perfect. I baked them for 10 minutes for the soft version. My husband made me promise to never lose this recipe!!

I was disappointed in the results, very flat and made a mess getting them off the cookie sheet. I wish I had read the other reviews first and adjusted the recipe accordingly. I probably won't make these again. I'd rather have a tried-and-true recipe I don't have to mess with to get it right.

I cut this down to a single serving size to make a single cookie, haha. It was pretty good considering it's kind of hard to cream together anything in that small of a measurement. I decided to just skip the 1/24th of an egg, haha. It still turned out well.  My only regret is that I didn't make two :(

This is an excellent cookie if you (as others have noted here) use 3/4 tsp baking soda and 3/4 tsp baking powder instead of solely baking soda.  Is it the ultimate chocolate chip cookie? Pretty close!

I was surprised that recipe called only for brown sugar. Usually, the cookies I make require both brown and white sugars. I forged ahead regardless and the cookie centers were mushy no matter how long they were baked for and they ended up like molasses cookies with chocolate chips. I spent all day making these as a gift for someone that I couldn't give. I followed the recipe to a T and was very disappointed with the outcome. Try another recipe.

Flat? I don't know what y'all are talking about because mine just stayed in the same shape and did not "melt" into a shape of a cookie at all. They were kinda dry ,and did not seems to cook evenly ,however they did smell REALLY good and filled my house with that great cookie aroma.

These cookies were horrible. The dough looked like fluff not like cookie dough when I was done mixing everything, and the cookies deflated the longer they were out of the oven, and the inside was like it wasnt even cooked even though I put it back in twice. I only used this cause I forgot my usual recipe b/c I hadnt used it in a while. I found a copy of it after these cookies were done though, so if you have tried this or were going to, I suggest trying this recipe instead: 1/2 cup shortening, 6 tablespoons brown sugar, 6 tablespoons sugar, 1 egg, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 1 1/8 cups all purpose flour, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon salt, few drosp hot water, 1/2 cups chopped nuts (optional), 6 oz chocolate chips; 1.Heat oven to 375, cream together shortening and sugars until fluffy, beat in egg and vanilla. 2. sift together flour, soda, and salt. add flour to mixture, add a few drops of hot water and mix until well blended. Stir in nuts and chocolate. 3.Drop by spoonfulls onto greased baking sheet. Bake 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Makes 4 dozen

This cookie came out looking good... I like cookies to be a little bit sweeter though... it also tasted a tad bit too salty even though I gave way less than what the recipe called for.  I might add some white sugar next time or use a different recipie.

pretty darn ultimate!  I substituted applesauce for the shortening and used 1 part whole wheat/1 part white flour to make a slightly healthier version-- still very delicious & moist!

I found this to be a great recipe as well.  I also used baking powder instead of baking salt.  I also cut down the sugar to about 2/3rds of the original as they were too sweet for my family's taste.  Great cookie.  Cheers.

The first time using this recipe, I made it exactly as written, minus nuts.  These took slightly longer to bake in my crappy oven, but this is the best recipe I've ever had for cc cookies.  I made them again, but this time I changed things slightly to see how they'd turn out; I used unsalted butter instead of butter flavored shortening, and I browned 2/3 of the butter first.  I let it cool, added the last stick of soft butter to the cooled liquid butter, and made the recipe as listed (minus nuts).  The browned butter gives it a deeper butter taste.  Fantastic recipe!!

This recipe was delicious, we used half to make regular cookies and the other half to make a pizookie (giant cookie with toppings). Only thing we changed about the recipe was that we used butter in place of the shortening.

I had to adjust the heat to 385 and kept them in for 8 minutes, then let them rest for 2 after pulling them out of the oven.  They turned out great!

These were absolutely delicious. But! I didn’t understand that the serving size was TWO per person, not ONE per person. So, four dozen cookies turned into eight dozen cookies! It was the gift that kept on giving... literally! Just keep this in mind if you want to make this recipe.

These are probably the very best chocolate chip cookies ever. Very chewy but crispy on the edges. Flattened out nicely to use for ice cream sandwiches. I've had the receipe in my  recipe box for years but haven't made it in a while so I forgot how wonderful it is.  Will be making them again for sure.

I didn’t follow the recipe exactly, so I can’t judge it as written.  I changed it based on what I had in my pantry.  I used 1 cup of butter flavored shortening and then half a cup of unsalted butter.  And I used all chocolate chips because I didn’t have walnuts.   And based on other reviews I used 1 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  They were still flat, but so delicious that I don’t mind!   I was going to bring them to school, but I really just want to eat them all!   Also, using a cookie scoop it made closer to 6 dozen!

Now for the 3 rd time.  The cookies turned out perfect, soft and scwishy when warm. Crisper the next day. I will make this with baking powder every time now.

These have will be my go to cookies. I took the advice from the reviews and did 1 teaspoon of soda and 1/2 teaspoon baking powder.  Then I took 1/2 cup of the flour and mixed it with the chocolate chips. Baked the cookies for a full 10 mintues.  Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Baked about 60 cookies. The family loved them.

Followed it to the letter. I didn't like the batter. It made for a rather tasteless flat cookie.  All I could taste were the chocolate chips.  The cookie was bland.  I really prefer using real butter because it gives the cookie itself more flavor.  My family wasn't impressed at all, but we've been testing different recipes.  This one rated lowest overall. Sorry.

Like other reviews, I did the baking soda/B powder switch. This recipe is a total keeper. Still alittle flat, only baked up 2 at first to see if I needed to add more flour, I did add another 1/2 cup flour. The flavor is better than the Toll house cookie, makes a nice LARGE batch of dough, it freezes great to.

New FAVORITE chocolate chip cookie recipe!!  Absolutely perfect!!  Followed the suggestions of other reviewers and switched the baking soda for baking powder.  I used a Tablespoon to scoop perfectly sized drops of dough.  They took about 10 min and were perfect!

Delicious! The only adjustments I made were adding buttermilk instead of regular milk, and adding a 1/2 cup of white sugar and 2 cups brown sugar instead of 2 1/2 cups brown...It turned out fabulous. I definitely will make these again. So much better than toll house, thanks!

This is the recipe that came with Butter Flavored Crisco and this is the recipe I've used for years. I don't usually add the nuts though so I just add more chocolate chips. I've tried all different kinds of chocolate chips and also M&M's, and toffee bits. I have found that for me, substituting half of the baking soda for baking powder works the best.

I love this recipe from Butter Flavored Crisco, but I stopped making them YEARS ago after learning how horrible the partially hydrogenated oils in shortening are for you (raises the bad levels of cholesterol while lowering the good cholesterol).  Today I substituted 1 cup of organic, unrefined, coconut oil and 1/2 cup of butter for the 1 1/2 cups of butter flavored shortening, and voila!  It tastes just as good as the original recipe AND I'm getting my essential medium chain fatty acids!  My family loved it because the cookies remained soft, unlike when I only use butter in chocolate chip cookies.

My boyfriend is a chocolate chip cookie fanatic.  I usually cut the recipe in half though as it makes so many cookies.  This is by far, the BEST recipe I've found for chocolate chip cookies!!!  I took the advice on using 1/2 powder and 1/2 soda...perfect!  Also, I ran had to use butter this time, and I have to say, I almost like them better with real butter verses the shortning.
