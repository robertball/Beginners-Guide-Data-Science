I was skeptical... I really was.  I mean, the recipe only had 2 reviews and I usually like to try more "proven" ones.  Plus I usually dislike cottage cheese in recipes.

But this was AWESOME.  I follow a basic low-carb way of eating, and this is great.  I can't wait to see how they do with freezing and reheating- it'll give me a way to have a breakfast on the go.

I can easily see replacing the bacon with diced ham or sausage crumbles.  Everything else, I'd keep the same.  My husband wants me to try making it without the green chiles, but they are so good if you are using salsa on top!

One hint- USE paper muffin cups... even with a well greased muffin pan, the egginess doesn't allow them to come out easily.  The paper cups would be the answer....

These were fabulous (with a few modifications)! I did not mix these up the night before - I don't know what the advantage would be. This is a quick breakfast dish already. First, 1/4 cup of butter is all that is needed. Secondly, 2 cups of shredded cheddar/monterey jack cheese is a better amount. I can't imagine this with more cheese than that. I used diced ham and sprinkled some freeze dried chives on the tops before baking for extra flavor & color. A note on pans - for one tray, I used my Pampered Chef stoneware muffin pan (still sprayed with Pam) and they puffed up beautifully & came out perfect. My other pan, an old non-stick sprayed with Pam - didn't come out as puffy, or as easily. I will buy a 2nd stoneware pan now! Thanks for the yummy breakfast!

These are great for an easy breakfast for company or yourself! They feeze great and can be thawed in the fridge overnight and just popped in the microwave for easy warming. They are so versitile and easy to make to your liking. I usually use ham to make it even easier and add whatever veggies and cheese I have on hand. Yummy....also the butter is NOT needed!!

No doubt this is worth 5 stars!!!  The green chilis were what made it - don't leave them out.  I will though make it a little less fattening next time by substituting ham for bacon, use fat free cottage cheese, and much less butter!  Thanks for a great recipe!

OH MY GOODNESS!  This rec. is easy to make and impressed those who sampled it!  YUM!  I preapred it for the first time this morning, and though I typically burn anything I bake/cook in muffin pans, these puffs cooked to perfection!  I forgot to include the butter, but they still came out really nice -- an I suppose we saved ourselves needless calories and fat!  :)  The extra puffs are in my freezer ... I 'll have to let you know if they thawed/microwaved well as leftovers.
Try this; you'll love it!  And think of all the modifications you can make to it!

This is my husband's favorite breakfast treat. I've shared it with others for fabulous potlucks and even a Christmas brunch. Always popular and super-easy to make!  I've never had a problem with them sticking, which is odd given that so many people have complained of sticking. I do use butter-flavored cooking spray to lightly grease my non-stick muffin pans, though. And I use a spoon to sort of edge around each puff to loosen it from the pan edges.  If you want a little green but don't care for the canned chiles, you can use chopped fresh baby spinach or parsley. I also substitute diced ham for the bacon most times. I use 8 oz of shredded Mexican blend cheese in the mix and then about another 4 oz on top. After accidentally forgetting to add the melted butter once, I've now omitted butter from the recipe altogether. It doesn't need it.   You could probably add anything you would throw into an omelette to tailor these to your liking. Just make sure you dice or shred pretty small. Anything too big or heavy will sink to the bottom and not mix properly while baking.

Awesome!  Highly recommended recipe!  I loved that it could be mixed up the night before.  I didn't use as much cheese as called for, but used sharp cheddar for flavor.  This would be great with sausage also.  These reheat nicely in the microwave the next day.  Thanks Karen!!

Delicious!  I brought these to work and everyone asked for the recipe.  They are like miniature crustless quiches.  I will definitely make these again!

I love this recipe!  I added extra cheese and just a pinch of chopped onion to the milk and egg mix and it came out fabulous!  I ate it with cold sour cream, just a suggestion.

I have had this recipe for about 6 years and been using it. We love it, I just had to join to write a review. I take these to work sometimes and people mug me for them! Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe, though I consider it 'mine' now, hope you don't mind! LOL (;

Very good.  Quick and easy.  I too left out the butter and it wasn't missed.  Also, I skipped the refrigerating overnight part.  These are quite rich, but tasty.

Have used this again and again to rave reviews.  This also cooks up great in a 9x13 pan: slice and serve!

These aren't anything gourmet or fancy but they are a "make again and again" kind of recipe.  I have made them as written and I've also made them with spinach and feta, pre-cooked well-chopped chard, and today I made them with sweet Italian sausage and my husband loved them.  I cut down the amount of cheese but I've found that the cottage cheese is a must to have a nice creamy texture.  I agree with other reviewers that the butter is not necessary.  There is plenty of fat available in the other ingredients to get the right consistency.  Thanks for such and easy, versatile, and portable food recipe!

These are great - and very appealing to 20 & 30-something single men!  At least once a week someone from work will hand me grocery money to bring a batch in.  I always use pepper jack and leave out the chiles.  Don't go full fat on the cheese - makes 'em way too greasy and gross - but don't go no fat either (i.e. egg substitute, low-fat turkey bacon) - those are rubbery, don't brown, and are impossible to get out of the pans (they don't even come out of paper liners easily). These little treats are perfect for sandwiching between toasted English muffins halves or chunking into a tortilla.

Yes, I changed it up a little -- I used a 12oz package of center cut bacon -- which was plenty of bacon. Used 2 cups of reduced fat cheddar and fat free cottage cheese and halved the butter. I didn't have the chile peppers but sprinkled the tops with green onion -- they were really delicious. The only thing I wish I didn't do was use cupcake liners, half the puff sticks to the paper what a waste! Next time I would probably use canadian bacon to cut down on the cooking time and the fat/calories.***UPDATE*** Made these a second time, used Ham in place of the bacon, pepppers and onions and fat free cottage cheese, reduced the butter and used 2 cups of reduced fat cheddar -- NO CUPCAKE LINERS -- they popped right out of the pan -- and everyone said they liked these BETTER than the original ones -- great breakfast!

Good stuff!  Made it exactly as printed with addition of tabasco.  Basically this is a crustless quiche and could be a vehicle for artichoke hearts with feta cheese or mushrooms and roasted red pepper with brie which I plan to try next. The sky is the limit with this basic recipe! Thank you!!

These got such rave reviews... I'm really surprised, but I just didn't like them. I used muffin liners as some people suggested, but they were really hard to peel off the puffs.  The chile peppers give this a weird taste. If I were ever to make these again, I would substitute onions and peppers or even spinach.  Also the amount of cheese is ridiculous, and I don't know what the point of the melted butter is.  I halved the amount of monterey jack and halved the amount of butter and these were still horribly greasy.  When I took them out of the muffin pan there were little pools of oil left behind.  Ugh. I can't imagine what it would have been like had I used the amounts stated in the recipe.  I was hoping these would make a great breakfast-on-the-go option, but they just weren't for me.  I'll keep looking.

I just made these for fathers day BIG HIT!!  I used 1 c of mild salsa instead of the chilis I also used sausage 2 8 oz bags of extra sharp cheddar with taco seasoning and a 16 oz sour cream instead of cottage cheese  i decreased the butter to compensate for the salsa liquid. I also added 5 minutes to the baking time my husband likes dry eggs I sprayed my muffin tins with butter cooking spray no problem popping them right out yum yum

We loved these!  I made just half a batch (there are only 2 of us) and used lots of healthy options, like egg beaters, fat-free cottage cheese, fat free cheddar, no meat, no butter, no salt, whole wheat flour.  I also had some fresh green chiles so I used those instead of canned, and I added sliced olives. They did stick a little to the muffin cups, even though I sprayed them, so I think next time I'd just bake them in the muffin pan so I could run the knife around the edge and not waste as much.  I don't want to miss a bite!  We had them for dinner, but we'll be having them for breakfast the rest of the week.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  Fast, easy, and best of all, TASTY!  Thanks :)

These are amazing!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!  For those that need - you can substitute 1/2 cup of gluten free flour along with 1/8 teaspoon of xantham gum.  The gluten free version tasted wonderful!!  :0)

I cut this in half to make twelve and cut the "crust" recipe down by another half to make six servings. I used "trim" cottage cheese. I made six with the crust and six without. I liked these because they were filling and low in fat/carbs. My kids liked them because they liked the handheld eggs. I'd like to make these again but I'd add some garlic, onion and probably red pepper.

These were amazing!  I mixed them up the night before (which was perfect because I had little to do with them the next day while getting two kids ready for school!), and I did make a few changes to them because of what I had on hand.  I used turkey bacon rather than pork to cut some of the fat and calories; I also used a chopped up jalapeno in place of the diced green chilis (since I didn't have any) and added to it also about a T of chopped cilantro and about 3 chopped green onions.  I used the reccommended amount of cottage cheese but halved the amount of monterey jack.  The result was delicious and full of flavor, great topped with homemade pico de gallo, and I will be making these again sometime!

These were great and very easy. I needed to make something for my daughter's school breakfast holiday party. I loved that I could do half of the work the night before. I used chopped ham and 2 8oz bags of finely shredded cheese, half colby/jack and half sharp cheddar. I omitted the chilis since they were for 8-year-olds, but next time I make this for the family, I'll divide the batter and make some w/the chilis, perhaps also sauteed onions. Also would be great with sausage and very well-cooked crumbled bacon. After reading some of the reviews, I invested in 24 silocone baking cups -- not the pans but re-usable liners for muffin pans. These things are amazing! The puffs just popped right out after they'd cooled a bit and absolutely no mess. I can't recommend them enough. Overall, this is a great recipe that can be made kid-friendly, but also adapted in so many ways for more adult tastes.

I've made this twice now, but I didn't exactly follow the recipe!  First, and most important I think, is that the melted butter is absolutely unnecessary.  I do LOVE butter, but you don't need it in these.  I made these with a pound of bacon, about 8 oz of garlic Monterey Jack (from Beechwood Cheese Co.), 8 oz of sharp cheddar instead of just cheddar, and added one bunch of chopped spring onions.  I didn't use the chiles so this didn't have the Southwest flavor of the original recipe, but I loved my version!  I did follow the recipe otherwise, so this is a good one to alter to fit your family's tastes.  Also, I used aluminum muffin cups in my muffin tins, and sprayed them well with non-stick spray, and the puffs come right out, no sticking!

I give this recipe 5 Stars with these Modifications, I used Real Crumbled bacon bits instead of cooking bacon, Its easier. Next i used only 5 eggs.(I was not sure how it was going to turn out due to mixed reviews did not want to waste food!) I used 3oz of Jalepenos instead of green chile's. This makes it have a REAL Kick! I also used 1 Cup of flour. I added pepper to taste, Cut out the Butter and Salt all together. I also added diced ham. I cooked in a Muffin pan that was greased pretty well! I let the batter sit in the fridge about 10 minutes and then baked. No need to let it sit over night. I baked at 325* ( i use dark pans) for about 25 minutes and they were PERFECT! No sticking at all! My husband says this is a must have weekly! Also NOTE: With the modifications i made it made 10 Muffins. So adjust accordingly if making a larger batch.

Yum! I'll be honest, I like these best without the bacon, chilies, and salsa. I undercook them a bit for one of the easiest, healthiest, most delectable cheese souffles you've ever tasted. I'm pretty sure that wasn't the intent of the recipe, but I'm super glad you've shared it, anyway. I've made it 3 times, now. Delish!

OMG!  Super easy and delicious!!!  I don't know why but, just like others here, I forgot to add the butter!!  They were just as good.  I love that they're already individually portioned off in the muffin liners.  Will definitely be making these again.

Loved it! I am on a health kick right now so I used turkey bacon, egg whites, fat free cottage cheese, low fat cheddar cheese and whole-wheat flour. I omitted salt and you couldn't tell the difference. The turkey bacon adds so much more flavour to eat. I wil definately be making this again and again and again...

I also took a hint from a review and did this in muffin papers.  WRONG!!  Lost about half of the goodies in the paper.  Next time, I'll spray the muffin tins and take my chances.  The recipe itself is a delight.  I got 5 stars when I served it.  One comment was, "You should have used edible muffin papers"!

i have to say this recipe surprised me. Not only is it simple to make but yummy as well. 
The only thing that I adjusted was the flour- i used an low carb alternative. I would definitely use this recipe again and again. The only thing i wasn't fond of was the saltyness- i think this could be changed by using low sodium bacon and not adding any salt to the recipe.
I did have a problem with the little suckers sticking to the muffin cups- not sure what to do about that tho.
Anyways, high marks for the great recipe- hope to see more from you in the future ;)

FANTASTIC!! So incredible yummy! Made it according to recipe and everyone loved it. I read previous reviews that said it was too much cheese, I didn't find that true at all. Only thing I will do differently is use aluminum baking cups to keep muffin pan cleanup a bit easier. This will become a staple in our low-carb household!

I would have rated this a 4 because I think they taste okay but my husband LOVED the cr4p out of them so I'm bumping it up to a 5. ALTERATIONS: 2T butter; used mixed cheeses (Monterrey Jack, Cheddar, Asagio, etc.); 10 oz can diced green chili peppers mixed with tomatoes; added pepper. I made two batches, one that I only left in the fridge for an hour (not overnight per instructions) and it came out fine. The other batch I left in the fridge for a couple of days and they definitely came out puffier; but if you're in a hurry they still taste good if you don't have time to refrigerate them overnight. I would like to add that once these are cooked they freeze very well - just wrap them individually and pop them in the micro when you get hungry!

Very easy and super tasty - though they do stick quite a bit to the muffin wrappers.  Excellent with salsa.  I used lowfat cottage cheese and sharp cheddar.  Yum!

This recipe is amazing! I made a few substitutions/modifications: I substituted ham for bacon, and used 1/2 lb swiss/1/2 lb jack cheese, added green onions, freshly ground pepper for one batch. The other batch I added spinach, parmesan cheese and sauteed mushrooms and WOW!! Delish!!

I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again and again!

This probably has potential if you tweak it a lot.  We did not care for it the way I made it.  I did cut back on the cheese a little bit, but even with the full amount, I'm not sure we would like it more.  The problem for us was the strange texture of the eggs.  It was easy, but that's about all I liked about it.

These are AMAZING!!! They are also VERY easy to make. I cut the recipe in half and they were gone in 2 days. I'm making them again this weekend but I'm leaving out the bacon this time and going to use some veggies. Thanks so much for a great/easy recipe!!

I love these! They are such a hit at my church and with my weekly mom's group. I made just a few adjustments though: I only used 12 ounces of turkey bacon (it's all I had) and I only used 2 T of melted butter. The first time I made them I used 1/2 cup butter and when they came out of the oven they were swimming in butter, so I cut it back the second time around and they were perfect! I also made them in my silicone brownie bite pans instead of muffin pans. They don't stick at all and I like that size better because it makes it easier to serve/share with a large group of people. And the bite-size leftovers freeze and reheat really well! This recipe is a keeper!

Sooo YUMMY! and such a flexible recipe. I sauteed fine chopped green bell pepper, minced garlic, and fine sliced green onions in a tiny bit of bacon grease and added it to the egg mixture (once cooled a little, of course). Someone suggested using cupcake papers to ease removing the egg puffs from the pan, but I just found them to stick to the paper pretty bad. We made due with scrapping the papers on our teeth - yes, it's THAT good - to get the stuck eggs off. Next time I'll just spray Pam on my non-stick pan. I omitted the melted butter, so maybe the butter is the key to get 'em to slide out of the cups (?). I also only used about 2 scant cups of fresh fine-shredded Colby Jack cheese (not the packaged pre-shredded kind!).  I think the fine shred melts into the egg mixture better while baking than the normal/bigger sized shred does. Plus, anymore cheese than that might overtake the rest of the flavors. Absolutely DON'T skip the chiles! They are vital to the yummyness!! All in all, this is a super budget friendly & very tasty & very quick meal!! I just made these for dinner and froze the leftovers for quick & easy breakfasts on the go!! Thank you!! P.S. I didn't refrigerate the egg/cheese mixture. I just mixed it all together & baked!

Have been making this recipe for years. It's the easiest, tasty puff ever. Great for brunches, buffets, potlucks. Instead of bacon I use sautéed, cut up breakfast sausage. YUM!

These were really good, but kind of greasy. I even cut the butter down to 1/4 cup. I think it could be omitted possibly. I used paper cups as suggested by another reviewer and the eggs stuck to them. I think it would be easier without. Also, I think diced ham would be better than bacon. Only used half the cheese and I thought it turned out just fine.

Yum.. these were a hit at breakfast today. The only thing I did differently was I halved the recipe and I didn't put it the chile peppers (I don't care for them) Next time though I might add a dash of Tabasco or some red pepper flakes. I have a feeling I might memorize this recipe. :)

I love this recipe I use the ground sausage instead of the bacon and I add a little fennel seed to the sausage while cooking it. I also completely leave out the butter.  I only use about 1 cup of the grated cheese in the mixed up eggs and then sprinkle a little on top after they are cooked and the heat melts the cheese.  When complete I use a little green salsa on the top and these are a wonderful low carb breakfast that I zap in the microwave for less than a minute and breakfast is ready...

I made these with egg substitute and lowfat cottage cheese.  I did bake them in paper muffin liners.  I would recommend baking them without liners or with aluminum liners, and I would spray the liners with cooking spray next time so the egg doesn't stick to them.  The liners softened too much and couldn't support the puffs.

I make these about 3x a year....I use jalapenos instead of chiles, chorizo sausage in place of pork sausage, white queso cheese in place of monterey jack and I too left out the butter. YUMMY! Great for breakfast, brunch or an appetizer (I make them in mini muffin pans and serve as an appetizer with sothwestern flavored sour cream...too good!)! I have made these as written too and they are equally good!
Those that complain about fat, you can modify this SOOOO easily (no butter, ham, fat free cottage cheese, 2% ched cheese, etc..I've made this way too) and it becomes a pretty healthy dish. These aren't for everyday breakfasts/snacks anyways! :)

These are AWESOME - perfect for little breakfasts at work for the hubby and I (25 seconds in the microwave!). A ton of good flavors in here. I used pepperjack b/c that's what I had on hand and ham instead of bacon but I can't wait to try the bacon next time. Very moist, bursting with flavor. Delish! Going to test the freezing now, wish me luck!  Oh, and I used cupcake liners since everyone said it was so hard to get out of the pan, but wish I hadn't now, it sticks like glue to that paper. I will try spraying the heck out of those trays next time.  Update: made this with cheese, spinach and feta and it was delicious but seems excessive on the amount of cheese (4 cups is a ton!) - I might cut down the shredded cheese by half next time.  I also agree that the butter is completely not needed.

I was disappointed.  I used ground pork sausage but it still wasn't flavorful enough.  Plus, they didn't rise at all (maybe cottage cheese too heavy?).  Although I used paper liners and sprayed as well, much of the puffs stuck.  Might try again but kick up with seasonings (thyme,pepper,sage,garlic) and use less cottage cheese.

great recipe for people who only have time to warm something up before they leave for work.  I omitted the butter (made it a little sticky in the muffin liner, but didn't change the taste) and 4oz of shredded cheese.  Other than that, a huge hit

I made these for a retirement brunch at work and everyone raved about them.  They taste like a crustless mexican quiche.  The cupcake liners were a great suggestion.  The ones I made without the liners didn't make it out of the pan!

11/17 To  lighten it a bit, I used 10 egg whites and 5 whole eggs; 8 ozs of cheese is enough for our taste; and I skip the butter and salt. I like the idea of muffin cups, but eggs will stick to the tin and muffin liners. So I placed slices of ham in the muffin cups and pour the egg mixture inside. (And I skipped the bacon this time.) Worked like a charm! To make mini cups, spray generously with Pam and bake for about 12 minutes. Update 7/18 used my air fryer and silicone muffin tins, 330 degrees for 12 minuets.

Taste is but with recipe modifications...hence 4 stars. Half the cheese is sufficient and butter isn't needed at all. Muffin cups, as suggested by reviewer,...horrible idea. They stuck terribly. Will be greasing muffin tin next time. Also...I didn't get much "puffing" effect. Not sure if that's on me.

This sounded so good and turned out to be awful. It was tough and heavy and had a bad after-taste.

Easy and delicious.  Made with ham to cut down on the fat.  Have taken to several gatherings, and never have leftovers.  Nice for potlucks because they're already portioned out.

For myself I would give these a 3 for taste. A little to cheesy and greasy for my taste, BUT my kids and husband LOVE them and they are super easy to make so therefore any recipe they like that is easy gets an automatic 5. I followed the recipe as written, but I sprayed the pan instead of using paper cups. Tonight I am making them for a third time, but I am not going to leave them overnight. I hope they turn out ok, according to other reviews this hasn't made a big difference.

These were great. I used Canadian bacon, because I could buy it precooked. The only thing I would say to someone who is about to make this for the first time is that you should grease the pan (as the recipe indicates) and not use muffin papers (like many reviewers did). The papers really stick.

Yum!  These are delicious.  I followed the recipe to the letter except I used bacon bits (not Bacos, higher quality ones) in place of frying bacon and they turned out delcious.  Don't be scared of these even if you don't like cottage cheese, I hate cottage cheese but loved these.

This is almost exactly like a recipe my mom has been making for years.  It calls for a dozen eggs, not 10.  Mixing it up and letting it sit is unnecessary, and a whole pound of bacon seems a little excessive.  We just crumble some on top before baking.  Delicious with spinach added.

These are awesome.  I ended up using about 8 oz monterey jack cheese, and 2 oz cheddar. I used a full package of morningstar breakfast "sausage" patties (8) instead of bacon, and cut the butter to 1/4 cup.  I used the foil muffin cups as others suggested, then when the were cool enough to handle, I took them out of the liners to fully cool before freezing.  They came out beautifully and taste great reheated in the microwave.  I wasn't sure how they would be in the freezer, but they do quite well.  I think they would be fine without butter.  Yum.  What a great little recipe!  Hard to stop eating...
Latest riff on this:
Replaced half the eggs with silken tofu, used 8 oz feta, 10 oz frozen spinach, mushrooms, and onions along with my morningstar patties.  I know, it's nothing like the original, but I love to riff on the basic recipe of eggs, cottage cheese, flour, and baking powder...

These are wonderful!  You can adjust the recipe to be just about whatever you want it to be.  I hate making breakfast (and even eating it) but know it is so important.  I made a batch of these substituting thawed, squeezed, chopped spinach and sauteed onions.  They are perfect!  They don't come out of the papers well, even though I sprayed the papers with non-stick cooking spray.  Next time I will try making them in a well-seasoned stoneware muffin pan (without papers) and see if that helps.

Very good and easy to make.  I used about half the called for butter, but will also leave it out next time.  I think they will be better and not as moist without the butter.

I used green peppers and ham as substitutes.

I made a half-recipe of this last night.  The husband rated it 5-stars, but I'm going to give it 4 because of modifications I will make.  

In an attempt to make the recipe a wee bit healthier, I substituted a few egg whites for some of the whole eggs.  I used 2% cheese.  I reduced both the salt and amount of bacon.  Due to picky child, I omitted the peppers, but added a sprinkle of garlic powder for some extra flavor.  

Both my husband and daughter REALLY enjoyed it!  I thought it was good, too, but will use less of the butter (Smart Balance for us!) and further reduce the salt next time.  My husband enjoys sausage, so I might try that next time.  And we both think the peppers would be yummy in it, so I'll probably make a few without (for the child), and then add the peppers to the remaining batter for us.  

I used silicone cups with a little spray of Smart Balance.  They popped right out no problem at all.  Thanks so much for the yummy recipe!

These are sooo cute and sooo yummy!  I made them for a baby shower and they were gone before I could get any--good thing I saved a few for me first!  I also used turkey bacon and some extra onion.  They did stick to my pan, but I have an old crappy pan, as another reviewer noted.  Hey, it gives me a good reason to get a new one! Great to freeze and reheat for a quick breakfast on the go!

Hit! My husband said they were awesome and my two-year old who won't eat eggs gobbled them up (as pieces) too - we called them "cheesy puffs" so he'd try them. Really, there is more cheese than egg anyway. I followed the original recipe and the other suggestions to use muffin cups. I sprayed with olive oil and the puffs slid right out of the foil liners but still stuck to the paper liners. Next time I'll probably just use the EVOO spray on the pan and skip the liners.

I wasn't sure how I would feel about this recipe since I really do not like Cottage cheese!  But I was pleasantly surprised!  A few modicfications - I sauted the butter and flour to make a paste so you can't taste clumps of flour!  I also used low fat cottage cheese, Jimmy Dean Maple sausage, colby/monterey/mozzarella cheese mix and green onions(no need to saute)... Bake in cupcake liners and these are tasty!  Perfect for a quick breakfast - rather then making eggs every morning, since we are on a low carb diet!  Thanks!

Delicious but I made some changes..   I used turkey bacon instead of pig bacon and I added sautéed onions, green peppers and mushrooms (about 1/2 cup of each).  I also used almond flour for a gluten free meal.  My additions yielded 36.   I can’t imagine these tasting any better.  This will be a definite repeat!!

This is what I make every 4th Sunday for our churches "Coffee Shop" I have been making these AT LEAST once a month for over a year now. People love them and always want the recipe. Now when I bring in the puffs, I always bring a few copies of the recipe. The ONLY changes I made was,instead of making bacon crumbles from scratch, I buy the REAL BACON CRUMBLES in the crouton section of the store. (Much faster!) and I use the Chedder/Monterey Jack mix (Called Fiesta blend)  I always make way more than is needed for the Coffee Shop so I have a few the rest of the week for breakfast! Make sure though when you make them, to put them in spray coated aluminum cupcake liners in the muffin pans. DON'T PUT THEM IN THE PAPER. You'll never get them out without a struggle.

Wow, this was greasy! I used bacon and all the butter the recipe called for. I wish I'd read a few reviews and used ham and less to no butter instead. They also came out really salty. Probably because of the bacon-butter combo. I'm glad I only made 1/2 batch though the thought of eating all 12 grease bombs is making me a little queasy.

With minor variations, this has been THE holiday or guest breakfast in my family for many many years.  Was published in a cookbook done by the Cleveland Symphony back in the 70s.  I have never yet met one single person who did not love it.  We call it Chile Egg Puff.  I make it - usually before I go to bed the night before or even a whole day before -  in a 9x13 well greased glass pan, and leave out the meat.  That's it. Bake till all of the top is slightly brown and eggs in the center are set (35 min?) Cut it into squares and enjoy.  The edges are really good so you can make this in one of those divided brownie pans for extra edge.  And FREEZE the leftovers, in serving sizes wrapped in plastic wrap.  1 minute in the micro and you have a delicious hot breakfast.

These are fantastic. I made a few modifications.
-substituted breakfast sausage for the bacon
-sauteed onion and green pepper with the sausage
-used 22oz cottage cheese instead of 16 (i didn't realize the container was that big!)
-added a little extra flour to compensate for the extra cottage cheese
-added salt and pepper to taste
-omitted the butter, there was plenty of grease left from the sausage
-poured it all in a 9x13 pan and baked for close to 40 minutes. Pulled it out when the bottom was turning brown and a fork came out clean from the middle
-I cut it into squares and will freeze whatever isn't eaten before it cools!

It was good. I made it exactly as listed but I did bake it in a 9x13 pan. I was disappointed in how much the chiles overwhelmed the taste of the bacon and cheese. I will make it again but will try it with sausage or leave out the chiles and use the bacon again.

Love them! I didn't have any Monterey Jack cheese but I had some mozzarella and some Colby/jack cheese so I used that. I had 3 dozen fresh eggs from my chickens and wanted to use up quick. It's almost like quiche without the crust and will make some great high protein breakfasts for my husband all week. Making some English Muffin bread to go with it now :)

As per reviews, used 1/4 cup butter, only 2 cups(8oz) of cheese, and low fat cottage cheese. Used diced tomatoes and green chilis can since i could not find only green chilis. Used 1 tsp of cornstarch, because I did not having baking soda. Used cooked ham steaks (I diced them) as I prefer ham over bacon.

I only had 12 muffin cups, and I used to the diced tmt and sprinkled on top of each muffin. 

The remaining mix and "salsa" I put in a smaller metal pan and baked at the same time.

I LIKE both the muffins and the scrambled eggs but I like the flavoring of the "salsa" mixed in the egg much more. 

Would make again in a casserole dish. And stir in the end to make salsa scrambled eggs.

I prepared this for Christmas Day breakfast and it was a hit.  I did not prepare and refrigerate overnight and it was just fine, although next time I will know that I have that option!  I am also going to reduce the butter as some readers suggested.

These were AWESOME! My 3 year old loved them, too! Great way to get her egg and cottage cheese intake, since she won't eat either! I substituted the green chile peppers with a tsp of cajun seasoning and added a sprinkle of paprika and parsley flakes on top for decoration! I would recommend the tin foil baking cups vs. paper cups... they pealed away perfectly from the foil cups, but stuck to the paper cups. Looking forward to trying these without the butter and substituting the bacon with either turkey bacon or sausage for a healthier version! This will definitely be a new family fav!

Yum, yum, YUM! We don't like chili peppers, so I diced red and green bell peppers, which also made for a colorful touch. And I even added a bit of broccoli so that it wouldn't go to waste. Instead of bacon, I used sausage. I'm not a believer in deviating too much from the recipe, but it was great for our tastes and what happened to be in the fridge. What it showed to me is that this recipe is perfect for customization. Maybe a different cheese, meat, veg, whatever is all it takes to make it perfect for you and your family. I knew when my husband moaned throughout eating them that I'd found another keeper! And it's also low-carb, which is our lifestyle. Thank you for sharing, Karen.

These taste great, and it's so easy to adjust them to your own personal taste.  The only change that I personally make is to use pepper jack cheese in place of the jack cheese, and omit the diced green chiles.  My son hates eggs of any kind, but he loves these!

Followed the recipe, with two exceptions: omitted the butter and the salt. Still, these were much too salty for my taste.

These were really great!   Only thing I did different was used a 4 oz. can of green chile peppers (I had one in the pantry so I just used that instead of buying another, larger can.)   It gave just a hint of the pepper flavor, which was good for my kids since they don't care for super spicy, but I'm sure with the larger can they'd still be just as good!

These were great. My wife and I loved them I used cheddar because that's what I had, everything else I used according to the recipe. We froze the rest for MRE's.

These are great and super easy! I only made a few changes. I used half ricotta and half cottage cheeses because I had some ricotta on hand that I needed to use up. I also only used about 4oz of shredded mild cheddar cheese because that is all I had. Omitted the peppers also. I plan on making these some other time with sausage. Huge hit with my 4 year old!

Hmm...not really sure. If you like quiche, you'll love this.  My family was not interested at all. My husband tasted and didn't like. I think they are okay, but if I do them again, I might do green onions instead of diced green chilis and I will add salt and pepper. I did cut the recipe in half too, which turned out just fine.

These are wonderful! I stuck to the recipe except I halved the melted butter, splitting the difference between the recipe and the reviews that suggested eliminating it altogether. I sprayed my muffin pan with Crisco butter flavored cooking spray and had no problem at all getting the puffs out of the pan. I think next time I will cook the bacon in the microwave since frying the bacon in the skillet was the messiest and most time consuming part of the process for me. Great recipe!!!

I will give this a 5, because I made changes that affected the outcome, so that is on me, not the recipe, and since this is the first time I made it, I cant really say it needed the changes.  Okay, so my changes were - less of most everything except the eggs.  I had 11 so I used them.  I also used a baking mix that I made from this site so that made up extra butter flavor.  I also added too much of the mix by accident.  So they were more biscuity for this reason, so that was my bad.  Not a bad flavor or texture, just different.  I also made them green for the kids using food coloring, and omitted the chiles but added dried red pepper and onion pepper seasoning, and dried cilantro.  The kids liked them.  I will try them with less baking mix next time :-)  Thanks for sharing.

These are quite good right out of the oven. 
I changed the recipe to suite my own tastes, which is why I didn't rate it 5 of 5 stars.
I added about 2 cups of fresh spinach to the cooked bacon, along with about 1/2 cup of sauteed red onion. I did not add the butter, as previous readers suggested, and I used less than 1 pound of cheese, which was a mix of mild cheddar and colby jack. I also sprinkled in some paprika for color.
Next time I would like to add more spices, use sausage instead of bacon, and add some other vegetables like sauteed tomato or zucchini. It's quite possible to make many variations of this recipe.

Very good base recipe!  I halved the amounts (just 2 of us).  I didn't have any green chilies, so I added about a cup of chopped and sauteed onion (with garlic).  Added 2ish cups of chopped spinach.  I baked them in silicone baking cups, sprayed with Pam first and they popped right out!  So light and fluffy.. yum!

This recipe is excellent! I followed some of the other recommendations, and omitted the butter and cut the shredded cheese back to about 2 cups. I didn't have chilis, and I wanted more vegetables in mine, so I added a box of thawed chopped kale, and a bag of frozen corn, in addition to the bacon. I also used 12 eggs instead of 10. With those changes, my recipe made 31 puffs, which I'm happy about because they're delicious!!!! I put a dozen in the fridge and froze the rest, and both my husband and I will get many, many quick, portable, relatively healthy breakfasts out of this recipe!

We made these for a group breakfast this morning.  They were delicious and popular with kids and adults.  We subbed cheddar cheese for the monterrey jack cheese to add color and we added a diced, sauteed medium yellow onion in place of meat.

just took these out of the oven. awesome!!!!!! u could add just about anything u want two these as far as veggies or meat. So good with salsa and sour cream. Did not use muffin papers, just sprayed muffin pans heavily with butter spray. Run a knife around the edges and out they came. Butter spray might be the the the trick 2 all the sticking problems everyone is having. Try these!!! u won't be disappointed.

Excellent!  My husband called them delightful.  I didn't use paper cups, just a lot of cooking spray.  They came out fine with a little help from a spoon.  We used some leftover ham instead of the bacon.

Great little recipe!  I added some chopped green onion and a couple of shots of tabasco.  I omitted the butter but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  They turned out beautifully - I got 32 instead of 24.  Put them in the freezer.  Take 2 out and microwave them.  Scrape them into a tortilla, smush them up and toss in a spoonful of salsa.  Breakfast to go - great!

Substituted sour cream for cottage cheese and real bacon bits for the bacon since that's all I had, and I added onion.  Very good and easy.

What a great and easy breakfast that looked just like little baby quiches! I learned from everyone else and didn't use the paper but sprayed my non stick muffin pan and with a gentle swirl around the edge with a knife, they popped right out. I used good old New Jersey Taylor Ham instead of the bacon and for an Italian twist I made some using pepperoni, provolone cheese and topped them off with brushetta. Yum and thank you so much Karen!!

These are very good.  I've made them twice now and will make them many more times.  I made them in muffin tins the first time, this time in a 9X13 pan.  I prefer the pan method.  It's just easier and I can cut them into whatever size portions I like.  I also add sauted onions, green peppers and garlic.  So good and so convenient to freeze for a nice breakfast to take to work.

These were great!  Everyone wanted the recipe!  I followed the suggestion of only adding 1/4 cup of butter and it was almost too greasy.  May decrease even more next time.

WOW! I gotta say this was an easy and great tasting meal. I used Jimmy Dean All Natural spicy ROLL sausage. I browned the sausage on a skillet in a little olive oil then drained and lightly rinse the excess oil. I added 1/2 cup shredded cheddar and 1 1/2 cup shredded jack cheese. I didn't put any butter in the first batch and it turned out just as great as the second batch WITH butter. I suggest not using the paper cups (food stuck to cup no matter what I did). Excellent with the green chiles!! Even better topped with good salsa!! Next time I will try adding chopped portabella mushrooms or chopped spinach or chopped sauted sweet bellpeppers... the list goes on! What a fun recipe!

Quite good!!  In my ongoing attempt to sneak in veggies where I can, I added some finely diced broccoli crowns (saying it was spices), and replaced the chilis with finely sliced green onions.  I also substituted the bacon with veggie bacon, used half the butter and half the shredded cheese, and whole wheat flour in place of regular, and it was all a wonderful combination! I made a mix in a regular muffin tin and a mini-muffin tin, and the mini-muffins were everyone's favorite.  I will definitely make this again - all as minis, and play around with various mix-ins.

Hmm!  I made this for breakfast this morning.  I made a few changes and it still turned out great (I plan on buying the correct ingredients and making a full batch to freeze).  First off I made 1/4 batch, because it's just me.  Second, I didn't have cottage cheese so I used plain yogurt and shredded parmesean (recipe called for 1/2 cup so I used 1/2 cup of each).  Then I cubed up some feta cheese and threw that in too.  I also don't like spicy, so instead of the peppers I used San Francisco mixed veggies (green beans, peppers, onions, broccoli).  Finally I used whole wheat flour and I didn't have muffin tins so I made it as a loaf.  It turned out great, fluffy and delicious, I can't wait to try it with cottage cheese!

I've made this several times since I found the recipe and it is always a hit.  My favorite was in a 13x9 baking pan instead of the muffin cups. I omit the salt, use 3/4 of the butter and turkey bacon to lighten it up.

This is a great recipe. I first made it for Christmas morning last year. I am not fond of green chilis so I just grate some onion instead to zip up the flavor. I have done it both with the chilis as well as using ham or other meat. It is always good. I also play with the cheese, everything from cheddar to cut up small chunks of cream cheese instead of cottage cheese. Always comes out great!

These were a little too "heavy," according to my husband.  I made them for him to have something quick to grab for breakfast.  He's not used to eating so much fat (bacon) and butter.  They tasted pretty good, but kind of greasy.  And they stuck to the paper muffin cup liners... so next time I would use just the aluminum foil liners, perhaps sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.

I brought these into the office for a co-workers birthday breakfast, and they went like hotcakes! I substituted turkey bacon, and topped off each puff with chopped scallions before baking. I found that they needed slightly more cooking time than recommended in the recipe - about 35 minutes to brown on top. My only complaint was that between the bacon, the cheese and the extra salt, they got a little TOO salty. Next time I'll only add a dusting, not the full 1/2 tsp.

Great recipe. My kids loved it. It makes a good quick heat and eat for the kids before they get on the bus early in the morning (of course if you make them ahead of time and put them in the fridge and just reheat. I left out the chili peppers but otherwise I made them following the recipe.

These little puffs are delicious and everyone at our Easter church breakfast enjoyed them.  I did change it up a bit to suit my low cholesterol diet.  I used canadian bacon, egg substitute, lowfat cheese and wheat flour.  My pot of chives are looking great right now so I also added a handful of chopped chives which gave them a good flavor.  I used mini muffin pans which are teflon coated and I also sprayed each tin with canola but they still didn't want to come out of the pans so that was a bit time consuming.  After the first 3 pans I decided to use paper liners in the next 3 pans.  These are the ones I took to the breakfast.  They were very pretty but you had to did them out of the paper liners which wasn't the idea I had in mind.  Oh well, they were still mouth watering.

delicious. Omitted the butter and did use only half the amount of cheese listed. Also used shredded gouda, cause i didnt have the other cheese at hand. I kept eating them for both lunch and breakfast. they were a bit too salty tho, will use a bit less bacon next time.
I also used a silicone pan for them. No sticking and cleans up easily.

I made this for a brunch cooking club addition.  It was a big hit!  We're going to try it again with sausage added instead though since I suck at cooking bacon.

These are great for breakfast, especially if you are "on the go".  I have put all kinds of stuff in these- ham, sausage, mushrooms, cheddar cheese- or anything else that I have a small amount of in the fridge.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought these were terrific and they re-heated well.  I keep them in the freezer and pop in the microwave for a couple of minutes when I need a quick breakfast.  I think next time I make them I will try using lower fat cheeses, egg beaters and reduced fat bacon.  Because of all the great flavor going on here I don't think cutting back on the fat will cut down on the flavor. My family and friends loved these.  This will definitely go in my keeper file

I almost didn't make these after reading the reviews about the puffs sticking in the pan but decided to give it a try anyway.  I have 2 muffin pans, one new and the other quite used.  The puffs slid right out of the newer pan but stuck in the older one leaving me to believe the pan might be the cause of the issue of their sticking.  I would also use only 1/4 c of butter next time.

Made a half-recipe, used Morningstar vegetarian Sausage Crumbles instead of bacon, no chiles, and low-fat cheddar and parmesan for cheese.  Perfect for a ladies' cabin weekend brunch dish.  Reheat like a dream.

These were good, but I didn't love them.  However, three of my seven guests requested the recipe, so they were a hit in that regard!  They do tend to stick.  I tried them with foil liners and with a lightly greased muffin pan and both methods had sticking problems.  I'd suggest using liners and spraying them with non-stick spray. The muffin pan was a pain to wash..save yourself the grief.

Was looking for something different for my annual Mother's day brunch. I tried them a few times ahead and liked them so much I went out and bought the silicone 12 muffin pan which make sticking NO problem. I did change the recipe somewhat because they seemed a little dry. I sprinkled cooked crumbled sausage on the bottom, then added the egg mixture with some 1/2 and 1/2 milk added for fluffiness, a dash of hot pepper sauce and left out the butter because I added more cheese.  They were awesome. So many options to add (asparagus, green pepper, onions, etc.). Now, can't wait to see how my 14 guests will like them. Thanks

Pretty good.  I like to make a breakfast thing that we can eat on the run all week.  This gives us something we can get hot and a change from bread-based items.  I will leave out the chilis next time and maybe sub with onions and peppers sauted.  The chilis gave it a funny taste I thought.

I made these for a ladies church breakfast and they tasted really good.  I completely forgot all the butter (I'm not even blond!) but it still came out tasting and looking pretty good.  No one noticed.  They are really good for a brunch dish.  The chiles tasted good too, but I think it would be better with a sausage instead of bacon.

I thought this recipe sounded good, so I made them for a baby shower brunch.  The only thing I wasn't so sure about was the green chiles,but they tasted even better than I expected and everyone else loved them as well.  I will definitely make these again.

We love this recipe. I make it for my husband who leaves early for work every day. It definitely makes a difference to cook these in better muffin pans. I actually use my popover pan, it’s really heavy duty and non-stick.

I love the option that AllRecipes has to reduce the serving size and immediately have the recipe recalculated. That being said, I cut the recipe in half and it was amazing. I didn't have chilies so I briefly sautéed baby spinach and chopped the cooked spinach. For this smaller recipe I sautéed about 1  cup of spinach and it added a bit of flavor. It was a hit with my visiting sister and the remaining muffins were frozen. I will let you know how that turns out. I also used Pam (olive oil) and well used muffin pans and they came out easily. I actually allowed my muffins to brown a bit more than the recipe called for and that may have attributed to the easy removal (?).

I omitted the extra stuff like cottage cheese and chiles, just stuck to making the batter and added sausage. The fluffiness was really nice, close to bread consistency. The flavor, great. However, I must echo what others have said about the greasiness. I'm going to try a half stick of butter next time instead of the full stick.
This is better than the frittatta recipes that just use half n half, because the texture is closer to bread if you're looking for muffin type results.

I make these so I can have an easy breakfast before work on busy mornings. These freeze great, and they give me a protein packed breakfast.  I have made a couple changes to the recipe including not adding the butter and not leaving them in the fridge over night. Also, I cook my bacon in the oven to reduce some of the fat content. (Place bacon on a baking sheet, place in a cold oven, preheat oven to 400 degrees, and set the timer for about 20 minutes). DO NOT USE THE PAPER LINERS. They stick and you lose half of your egg puff.

Very delicious.  My friend that gave me this recipe suggested using foil muffin cups and removing them before heating the egg cups in the microwave.

Great easy breakfast on the run or for little fingers to grab and hold. Made a few without green chile for the little ones. Next time I will add a few more spices maybe even some Rotell, for extra zing.

Made these in a silicone muffin pan. No problems with sticking. Made with sausage instead of bacon. These were good, but a little salty. I watch my sodium so others may think it's ok. Next time I'm going to add cooled and drained broccoli. And cut flour back to 1/4 cup. Will try freezing leftovers.

These turned out well. I followed the advice in some of the reviews and used muffin liners. I used less than 2 cups of sharp cheddar, skipped the green chilis and used deli ham. These have a nice flavor and are great for getting breakfast on the run. They would also be good with a little sour cream and salsa or as filling for a breakfast burrito. Next time I will experiment by adding garlic & onion, will try them with sausage and some with bacon. Like others, will use 1/4 cup butter.

I have been making these for a while now and have made a few changes. Omit the salt - it's really not necessary with all the cheese and bacon. I use oat flour to keep these puffs gluten free. And I really watch the time! If you cook them long enough to stay puffy(30+ minutes) they'll also be dry. I prefer them cooked slightly less (25ish minutes) so they're nice an moist although they "sink" slightly. They're a hit everywhere I take them. About 15 grams of protein per puff. Also, use a silicon muffin pan for best results!

This was a big hit!!  I of course read all of the reviews and made a few changes.  I used 12 eggs instead of 10.  I did not use any butter and did not add any extra salt.  I put ham, spinach and feta in mine and only use cheddar cheese.  Everybody loved them.  Also did not add the peppers.

The key to baking is a silicone muffin pan!! I've scrubbed and scrubbed a metal pan after making these, used a foil pan, and baking liners, but the silicone is by far the best; they pop right out and easily wipe clean. I replace the bacon and chilis with canadian bacon/ham and onions, and 1/2 the butter. Mix the entire recipe (no waiting overnight), bake and freeze. 1 minute in the microwave while an english muffin is in the toaster for a quick breakfast.

I wasn't sure I would like these, so I did a half batch (still 12 puffs) with no meat, veggies, or butter. I did not like them at all!! Mine were also greasy and stuck like glue to the liners, even though I also sprayed them. I actually didn't half the flour, but I still felt like there wasn't as much of a solid texture and taste as I wanted. I wrapped a puff in a slice of ham and that helped a little, but the puffs, even after cooking for 35 min, were still really wet. I'm going to try eating some of the leftovers crumbled onto a sub roll with ham and tossing it in the toaster oven. I won't waste the leftovers, but I'll never make this again!!

I really liked these.  Took them to church and everyone wanted the recipe.  I will say that I did not use cupcake liners.  by using a well greased cupcake pan you get crunchy on all sides.  It is a little tricky getting them clean out of the pan, but mostly they were fine.  I had more batter than cupcake tins so used a small square pan.  they cut up nice and were just as easy to pick up and eat.  they freeze well too!

Wow!  Had some cottage cheese, the texture of which was questionable so found this recipe to use it in.  Very pleasantly surprised.  Easy to prepare (next time will probably use bagged bacon crumbles, that was messy and people kept swiping bacon), low carb, and it's delicious.  Made more than 24 muffins though - got 12 full-size muffins, 24 mini muffins, and a 9 x 9 pan full.  Will be freezing some for later.  As written, did not need liners and they did not stick in pan.

These are delicious and perfect for on the go! My husband loves eggs and loved these! I followed the recipe except I used half the amount of butter, half with just egg whites, and used turkey bacon. I will be making these again. :)

I left out the butter and cut the cheese in half.  I used Pepper Jack and Canadian Bacon.  Everyone loved it.  My only problem was that it was more work to clean the pans than it was to make the recipe.  I oiled the tins really well.  Any suggestions?

This is one of those recipes that does NOT turn out right without modifications. Tastes great... Once you figure out how to actually change the ratio and properly prepare the cups. I currently have an amazing tasting DISASTER of some food in my kitchen..... :(

I did like many others and omitted the butter, and used half the cheese (2c). I used a silicon flexible muffin pan sprayed lightly with Pam, no sticking problems at all. Ok recipe if you really like eggs then this is for you, my daughter loved them but it's a little too much like ciche for me.

delicious!  I made it gluten free by using Pamela's Pancake and Baking Mix and it was wonderful, even though I forgot to add the butter.  Had trouble getting them out of an older muffin pan even with Pam.

Yum, love this recipe. Made it to take on a camping trip. I do agree, the butter is not needed, they were a little greasy in the pans, but I used cupcake papers. If you didn't, I can see where the butter would be quite beneficial. Will definitely make again.

These were very good...as well they probably should be considering all of the fat in them.  I actually felt a little guilty eating them considering there was 2 lbs of cheese, 1 lb of bacon, and 1/4 lb of butter in them!  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't have too much trouble removing them from the pan...I just ran a knife around them first and pulled up gently.  I'm assuming that the people that had a really hard time getting them out probably left out the butter which I'm sure would contribute to the sticking.

I made these in mini muffin cups for a baby shower and they were great!  I followed it without changes and didn't think the butter made it too greasy and they came right out of the pan just great.  Thanks for such a great entertaining idea!

I pooled a couple of recipes to doctor this one. Basically I had some leftover seasoned, cooked ground lamb from the Gyroll recipe on this site; I used that for the meat in this recipe and I really think all the seasoning made this a very nice, savory breakfast food. I don't have the lamb on hand all the time, though, so I'm not sure what I would use the next time I would make this (we don't eat sausage or bacon). The downside was that the lamb made it extra-greasy. Overall good basic recipe, though - and who would've thought the cottage cheese would work - but it did!

WOW! This recipe is beyond words! SO GOOD! Like a quiche without the crust! I could eat these everyday!  I followed the recipe exactly except I halved it to make less and omitted the chile peppers because i dont like them. They were so good. I served them at a mothers day brunch.  I'llbe adding this recipe to my personal cookbook of favorite reciepes!

I omit the sausage and the peppers because my 8 year old wouldn't eat them, but this is a big favorite in our family!  I use 12 eggs, 24oz cottage cheese and whatever shredded cheese I happen to have.  I freeze them and take one out each morning and microwave for 40 seconds for a fantastic lean protein source for my kids' breakfast.  They are delicious, portable, easy and full of protein - perfect!  And I love it when they don't come out of the muffin containers entirely so I have an excuse to eat the broken pieces!  Definitely 5 stars from our family!

These are so easy to make and everyone, including my two small kids, devour these each time I make them. The flavor is delicious and the texture is great! Definitely reduce the cheese and butter by half, but keep everything else the same.

Very good recipe.  A lot of reviews talked about the puff sticking to the pan or paper.  I used my Bakers Best Bar Pan (non stick) and sprayed it with the butter flavored Pam and they came out with no effort.  I used the butter in the recipe, I don't know if that has anything to do with the non-stick factor as well.  I substituted 1/3 cup green onions and 3 small jalepenos (no seeds) for the chiles and it turned out fabulous.  I made this for our Sunday School class and it was a hit.  This is definitely a keeper!

I used Velveeta cheese that has 30% less fat instead of jack cheese and did not add in the can peppers. These were delicious! Very fluffy! I only wish they did not stick to the muffin paper.

Fantastic recipe!  I took this to work and everybody loved it. Living in the Southwest I served the puffs with salsa on the side. A winner!!! Also great for RV camping as they heat up well in the microwave.

Definitely 5 stars.  I omitted the butter but general sprayed my muffin pans and they came out perfect.  And the flavor possibilities are endless!  Next time I'm going to try some ground beef, cumin, and cilantro for a little mexican flare!

These puffs were wonderful!  I didn't like that we had trouble getting them unwrapped from the muffin papers, but I brought it to work and everyone loved them!!  I used pre-cooked bacon which made prep work go that much faster.

These were darn good!  I added Smoked Chipolte powder and some sauteed onion and garlic to the mix.  My only complaint: I followed a few reviews and used muffin papers that I sprayed and they still stuck!!!  But I will keep the recipe and try again.

These were really easy and are great to freeze and heat for a quick low carb breakfast or lunch.  One thing I noted is alot of people said to cut back on the cheese, I think this depends on taste.  I used full amount recipe called for and loved it.  I could see omitting the butter next time though, it is really greasy.

These are awesome, although next time I will leave out the salt.  But, I will DEFINITELY make this recipe again!! Great for low-carb plan because they are flavorful and satisfying.  Great with guacamole.

Loved it!  I had to use bell peppers as my boyfriend doesn't like spicy stuff too much.  I also used sage seasoned sausage which would've gone really well with the onions I discovered after I was done.  Um, I'm going to cut the butter down the next time.  I didn't bake it in muffin form.  I cooked it in a glass casserole dish for about 60 minutes the night before and so far it has turned out really well in the mornings.  Will add mushrooms and onions the next go around and maybe play with different types of cheeses too.

This was really good.  I used Southwestern flavored Eggbeaters in lieu of the eggs.  In the end, the flavor was superb but the eggbeaters stuck to my muffin papers and then later sunk.  I don't know if the Eggbeaters caused this problem or not but I will make again without using the muffin paper.

These are AWESOME!  We found this recipe a few years ago when planning a grandparents day breakfast.  It's now what we make for that occasion each year + christmas morning breakfast + any other special a.m. occasion -- all in the family (from father in law to kids) love these!!  You will not regret making these!!

This wasn't quite to my expectations.  It really stuck to the muffin papers and sank almost as soon as they were out of the oven.  I might try this recipe again in an 11x7 dish, but it seemed strange to be eating them like muffins.  The flavor was pretty good though.  Our guests liked them, but I was on the fence.  Thanks for the recipe.

Originally only made this recipe to use up the cottage cheese in my fridge.  I was surprised at how good they were.  My 5 and 6 year old couldnt stop gobbling them up.  Only thing I will do different next time is to leave out the chilies.  They picked them out.  Otherwise, great recipe and freezes well for on the go breakfasts.

This recipe makes for one of the best "egg bakes" I've ever had!  I added some leftover chopped jalapeno pepper slices (from a jar), and baked the entire "puff" in a 13x9 pan.  I'm not sure if it's the addition of the cottage cheese that makes this so flavorful, but we all loved this; it bakes up very rich-tasting.  This would be great for a quick weeknight dinner as well.  Thanks for posting this recipe; it will be a regular for us.

I left out the butter and bacon, and used only about a cup and a half of cheddar cheese. The recipe made 24 puffs even with less ingredients, and they cooked in about 15 minutes. I had no trouble getting them out of greased silicone cupcake pans. Best of all, they taste really good! I'm pleased that I'll now have a quick breakfast or lunch in the freezer that I can take to work.

Took this tailgating and all 30 people loved it.  I used an 8 ounce bag of shredded cheedar cheese and added onions.  I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and used a greased 9 x 13 pan.  I served with salsa sauce and sour cream.  I had to cook it for 60 minutes.  I precooked it the day before and reheated it.  It is a perfect cook ahead dish.  I am taking it again next weekend.  Thanks Karen for a wonderful receipe.

These were awesome, I made them for a baby shower and I had none left over!! everyone was asking me for the recipe.  It is a little greasy, next time i will Omit the butter, and use half the cheese as it was a little too much.  as another healthy substitution i will use half whole eggs and half egg whites.  So great and I will definitely be making again.

I made this recipe for brunch one day. We enjoyed it, but I would change a few things if I were to make it again. First of all, I would use paper muffin cups to line the pan because, even with greasing, these were fairly difficult to remove from the pan. I would also use a cheese with a little more kick, like a sharp cheddar or even a chipotle cheddar. I would also replace the peppers with jalapenos or something spicier. However this is all just personal preference. While good, it was a bit bland for my tastes.

Great recipe!  I was looking for something to make ahead for a group of people to take with me on a trip.  I made the egg mixture complete with the flour mixture and cooked it the day before in a muffin tin (i did not use muffin cups).  The next morning I put a dozen on a baking sheet at 350 for about 15 minutes and they were great!  Everyone loved them.  Next time I will add the onion for sure.  A perfect portion controlled breakfast.  Thank you!

I made this for a potluck at work and everyone loved it, even if the paper cups stuck to the E&C Puffs.  I heeded the advice given about leaving out the butter, only put in 2 cups of cheese and used Fat free cottage cheese.  Everyone loved them!

Man these things are good but you can tell by looking at them that they are not good for you!  Can't even tell the cottage cheese-which surprised me.  These are rich, and you can see the grease.  I followed the recipe.  They did stick some and I even coated the pan-which surprised me.  If you can look beyond the unhealthful factor-these are tastey!

Delicious!  Made them for Christmas brunch and everyone came back for more.  The 2nd time I made them, however, I completely eliminated the butter and actually preferred them that way--they seemed fluffier and less greasy (and obviously were slightly healthier).  Will make these again and again!

These were Okay.  Reduced the cheese and butter in an attempt to cut some fat.  The taste was good but they did stick on the bottom.  Probably will not make again.  If I am going to eat this much fat, I'd rather eat cheesecake.

I got this recipe ages ago off this site, and this is by far my most frequently requested breakfast treat I've ever brought to work!  I leave out the chiles and just use pepper jack instead of plain monterey, and (depending on who I'm making them for) may toss in a pinch of cayenne.  They're not health food by any means - they kind of "unpuff" and seem to get greasy as they cool - but the guys in my office just smash 'em in a biscuit or english muffin and plow them down one after another!  A real hit!!!

I made mini and regular sized puffs.  While something a little different for breakfast they weren't espeially 'amazing' as I expected from the reviews and I would only make it for my family.  Thanks but I'll have to search for the 'keepers' to serve to guests.

These are excellent.  I debated on whether to add the green chiles but I did and its the only way to go!  They were awesome!  I've also made them w/ham and sausage and just can't stop eating them!  Definitely a keeper receipe!

This recipe was so very good!  I followed the recipe to the T, except for the green chiles because I did not have any.  I did not have any trouble getting these out of my new muffin tin, but a little bit of trouble getting them out of my old muffin tin.  Definitely you must spray the muffin tin!  Thank you for a great recipe!

These little guys are great!  Baco's work just as well as real bacon, if you want to cut the prep time.

I didn't care for these much. How can they be soooo greasy and yet stick to the pan? Nothing puffy about them!

These came out great...I motified the recipe and used sour cream, salsa and cheddar cheese like someone suggested. I would definalty use the non stick muffin pans the presentation is much nicer.

YUM-YUM!!!  I used a silicone muffin pan and had no sticking at all...push up from the bottom and they popped right out.  I made these because my husband has decided to try going low carb for a while to see how it works.  I made a half recipe.  I didn't use cottage cheese because we didn't have any, instead I added some sour cream.  I reduced the amount of flour (carbs) to just about a tablespoon.  Next time I will also reduce some of the butter.  My husband says they taste great and the convenience is a definite plus.  Just pop a few in the microwave and then he is out the door.  Great Recipe!!!

These are great, and SO easy to make! I used egg beaters, low fat cottage cheese and turkey bacon, and they were delicious! I had no problems getting them out of the pan... they popped right out (I used Pam). This recipe will be a staple for brunches!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Huge hit and will make these again and again.  The leftover ones heated up in the microwave great too.  If my kids were still at home, I would have made these for quick breakfasts before school.

I served these puffs with salsa for my husband and my two brothers in law and they enjoyed them a lot. Since we do not use much salt I felt like they could be less salty, but it might have been also because I used bacon bits instead of real bacon. Overall great recipe, thanks.
