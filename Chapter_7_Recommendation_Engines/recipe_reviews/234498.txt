My family loved it.  Our nine year old daughter couldn't get enough!!!  I added a can of corn and a can of green chilies.  Next time I will substitute chicken for the beef.

We both liked this!  We added home canned bananna peppers.  We could not find ranch beans and it was fine.  In our bowls we topped the soup with sharp cheddar cheese and sour cream and had nachos on the side.  Yum!

We thought this was great! I made it as is first, then after tasting it added the other spices suggested by others and this will easily be a go to recipe in a pinch. It was quick and easy to make and I didn't even have to defrost the chicken. Next time I will top with lime and cilantro.

great but did modify it by reducing amount of beans. Used zesty pinto and seasoned black and northern white beans, and reg pinto beans. Added diced tomatoes and can of tomato sauce
substituted about 2TB chili seasoning mix instead of taco seasoning mix in recepie

this was so good.  I made it for the whole office (approx. 10-15 people).  I omitted 1 can of beans because it wouldn't all fit in the crock pot.  Will definitely be making this again

This is the second time I have made this great soup for a cold winter day. This time I didn't have any taco seasoning so made my own, Taco Seasoning 1, also from this site. My hubby liked it better than the first soup and he's been asking for it again.

Great recipe.  I used ground chicken instead of beef and added a little habanero spice  to give it an extra kick.  It certainly worked.  I served it with tortilla chips and added a dollop of sour cream.  Delicious!!!

Excellent and easy.  I did not have all of the beans listed, but the recipe does say "Use any combination of beans you like" and it turned out very well.

I doubled it thinking 1 lb of hamburger wouldn't feed my family of 4, then i actually had too much and wasn't able to put double of the beans.  Its enough.  Was very good and looking for the cold weather to hit so i can make it again.

Easy to make, tastes great without having to doctor up the ingredients ... what more could you ask for? Will definitely be making again.
