I'm Brazilian and I think this is a great Americanized version of this dish. Feijoada in Brazil is notorious for the "throw away" cuts of meat such as pig ears, tail and foot (my personal favorites) but I recognize that this probably wouldn't be a crowd pleaser in the U.S. Make sure you make a caipirinha to go with your feijoada ;-)

I'm Brazilian and I have to agree with the other Brazilian's review, this is definitely a great Americanized version of feijoada! However I'm gonna suggest cilantro instead of parsley, at least in north of Brazil where I come from it's how we do it!
 Congrats

I rarely make recipes "as is" from this site, but I did with this one. I was not disappointed! I am not Brazilian, and have no idea what the authentic version should taste like, but whatever this version is, it is absolutely delicious. Thanks, Chef John, for another amazing dish to add to my repertoire.

Just made this for my Brazilian husband and received rave reviews! He did say my chunks weren’t chunky enough - bigger bits of meat are preferred so you can choose your protein when serving. The cook time took less than 4 hours. After an overnight soak, the first step took about 1:15 and step 2 took a out 1:30. The bacon and sausage rendered a lot of fat, so I ended up pouring off most and adding back what I needed to cook the onion and garlic. Also, rather than using water to top off when needed, I used chicken broth left over from the night before to add a little more flavor. Lastly, make sure to stir regularly during the last stage as it can stick to the bottom as it reduces; also, don’t be afraid to mash some of the beans as you do to help thicken and add body. I served it with couve (chiffonade collard greens sautéed in some of the reserved fat with onion, garlic, a pinch of crushed red pepper, and salt and pepper to taste), rice and orange slices. This is definitely getting added to my regular rotation.

In our house we call this Meat Stew, which is much easier to pronounce than feijoada, and it is much loved by all. We have never been able to find the linguica sausage so we use andouille instead. It is a winter time staple and better the day after. The orange zest bread crumbs are not to be dismissed as garnish! So delicious!

Excellent!  This may be Americanized but the taste is close (if not better than) authentic feijoada.  I am adding this to my repertoire for sure.  Uma delicia!

I made this exactly as directed and it was well worth the effort.  My family thoroughly enjoyed this flavorful dish.  In fact, we have never been disappointed by any of Chef John's fabulous recipes!

This is very close to my grandmother's traditional Brazilian recipe.  I'm not sure how available they are but instead of breadcrumbs she used fadoffa and instead of beef jerky she used a salted, sundried corned beef called carne secca (sp?).

Great except I accidentally ate the "do not eat" packet in the beef jerky before I got to that portion of the video. It really did disguise itself well. Note to self watch the full video before prepping the ingredients to avoid these mishaps.

Phenomenal flavours and both the kids, hubs and I give this two very high thumbs up!  I used organic canned black beans to cut down on the cooking time to make this in time for the Olympics!  :)

I am only giving this a 4 because it is such a long cook time.  Also, Linguista is super hard to find apparently.  I substituted Andouille sausage instead and it was still super delicious.

I did make a couple edits. The meats I used included: smoked pork sausage, andouille, pork sirloin, pork tasso, beef jerky. The recipe turned out beautifully - the flavor was outstanding. I took to work for a potluck and had leftover so also shared with family and neighbors - everyone raved about how delicious this was! I barely used any salt - the variety of meat added plenty of flavor. I also doubled the coriander and cumin.  I will be making this again! It's addictive!

Very good, got too hungry and didn't let it cook down all the way so it wasn't very stew like.

I love this in the winter time... BTW this is the easier way which works fine but...

Nothing beats it when you use a pressure cooker with nothing but smoked meats on low heat for couple hours..

Another tip is dice tomato and onion with some parsley and toss it in a small bowl add some black bean liquid with just a few beans not too much and vinegar to taste.

this creates a side dish that is used to go with the feijoada that is famous in Brazil, it helps when eating that much fat I guess.

They put hot pepper in it also but that's up to you, it's  called malagueta but it can be hard to find depending on where you live.

Really superb flavor.  Takes a while to make, but worth the effort.  I gave some to a Brazilian friend of mine, who said she'd never made it before. She said it tasted just like her mom used to make for special occasions--the fresh-squeezed orange juice over the top is a must for authentic flavor!

Very versatile recipe to use any kind of pork. I used what I had on hand, which was bacon, beef kielbasa, pork riblets, and chorizo. Added 2 hatch peppers, and at the end, red and green peppers and only cooked until done, not mushy.  Did not make topping. A delicious dish.
