I've come to a point where this dish has become a regular meal in my house. Over time, the outcome of the recipe has turned out better and better. I like to brown the chicken pieces quite a bit before adding the broth mixture. Also, I add some onion powder for more flavor. I like to make this with rice or potatoes. I give this recipe 5 stars! It's excellent.

Easy to make. For healthier eating use the EVOO, although one table. of vegetable oil and one of butter isn't going to kill a person. The recipe says to add the roux to the hot mixture. That will cause lumps. Heat the broth first, then add the flour. When it thickens add to the hot mixture. Fixing gravy this way will always prevent lumps. Flour has to be cooked a bit before adding to a hot mixture. Cornstarch doesn't.

Excellent recipie I will definitly add this to my box. I doubled the gravy and added onions,green beans,and carrots to the mix. Cooking it like a stew with very thick gravy. Came out so good. Thanks to this web site I am becoming a better cook. Or at least that is what my family is telling me, ha ha ha.

i made this last minute with chicken i had thawed the night before.  it didn't look special but i needed something quick.  oh my god!!  this recipe was out of this world!  it took no time at all and was delicious.  i added a splash of white wine, just because i like the depth of flavor it gives.   i   made the recipe with stuffing and could have eaten the whole lb. of chicken it was so good.  if the sauce gets too thick add more broth.  one of the best things i've made off this site.

This was quite good made as is! I added a little Italian seasoning to the chicken with the salt, pepper and flour, and although I made it scaled it to one, i minced a whole clove of garlic. (okay, not exactly made as the recipe said). If you added lemon juice, it would be close to chicken piccata! It was easy, and had that rich taste that I think chicken broth brings. Next time i will flour the chicken more, so it browns more, and serve it over rice. And yes, i used more flour than the recipe called for. All in all, i really liked it, and i will make it again for sure!

woke up feeling achy and depleted.  I am a northern girl not a big gravy fan.  Somehow this intrigued me.  Boy is it good!!! Perked me right up.  Made it as directed.  Spooned it over hot biscuits (from the can) and added some steamed frozen peas.  I will make it again and again I am sure. Creamy, tasty, satisfying and comforting.  Thanks for sharing

This is a GREAT recipe! I just whipped it up (it's that easy) to raves from the family! On it's own it is delicious, and the addition of lime juice and some capers made it another kind of special!  This recipe could be tweaked with other spices and sides for a plethora of goodness... I'm going to make it with turkey leftovers next week. Thanks!  "Try it, you'll like it!"

Really tasty!!! I used a little bit more flour than the recipe called for to get a thicker gravy. I also used garlic powder in the flour mixture to add a little more flavor. My husband LOVED it!

Pretty bland.  Chicken breasts don't yield much flavor for a gravy.  I can think of better ways to use chicken breasts.  I think the picture gives a good idea of what it will taste like.

i made this today for dinner on 2/9/11 and well considering i have a horrible cold and was sick of making chicken noodle soup i gave this a try and it was really good i had to add a lil more garlic to it to my taste and added onion powder to it and no salt seasoning they sell in the dollar store for a buck...and i would recommend making a roux of flour water paste then adding to thicken just don't go over board with the flour water paste or it will taste more like flour so i just added a bit more broth with butter added to the broth while was heating up and go easy on the salt cause the broth has enough salt in it. a very good starter recipe i served it with instant mash potatoes and green beans.

My husband and I both agree this would be a great pot pie base. As a dinner it is alright,lacking in flavor but the chicken was very moist. I will make again but with some tweeking.

We really enjoyed this.  Nothing fancy, but a good weeknight meal.  I doubled the amount of gravy, and still didn't think that was enough, so I might triple it next time.  I served it over rice with a side of green beans, and it was a nice change of pace.  I'll make it again.

Very Easy and good!  I used EVOO and a little more broth and flour as I like a lot of gravy.  It was a little bland so I also added about 1/2 a jar of store bought alfredo sauce.  Holy cow did that make a wonderful difference.  Served over instant mashed potatoes.  I'm sure I'll make again when I'm crunched for time.

I did not care for this recipe.  There was not a lot of flavor.  However, my husband loved it and finished the leftovers the same night.  I paired it with white rice.

Really super easy to make! The fam loves it over mashed potatoes.  The only thing that I do differently is I add some chicken soup base (1 tsp) in with the flour when making the gravy. I have made this a few times now and it is always delish:)

This is great!  Like John I added peas, carrots, onions, and celery and more gravy.  But then I put it in a casserole dish and baked a can of biscuits on the top for an easy and delicious pot pie!

This was great!  I read the reviews before making it and was surprised that there were complaints of it being bland or salty, since the recipe says to taste it and then season to taste.  You could have a lot of fun with this recipe by changing the seasonings.  I put the chicken, spices and flour in a ziplock bag and tossed it.  It made it easy to coat.  I would suggest lowering the heat when adding the roue to the pan.  Mine clumped up.  I ended up pouring the gravy into a bowl and using an immersion blender to get rid of the lumps.  I then returned it to the pan to complete the recipe.  My son had two helpings of mashed potatoes with the gravy on top, and ate all of the chicken except for the last three pieces.  Then he said, "this is bland."  I tapped a little seasoned salt on top and he scarfed the rest down.  To each his own.  P.S.  I think this would be fantastic with a little white wine in the gravy.

This was pretty darn good.  Only change we made was to use EVOO in place of the vegetable oil and added some crushed pepper flakes for a little kick. Thanks so much for the post.

Threw this together one night because I had all the ingredients on hand.  Both of my "boys" like it, even my 7 year-old food snob!

My kids and I all enjoy this recipe.  My boyfriend, not so much.  We have it with mashed potatoes and I double the gravy ingredients to make sure we have enough for the potatoes!

This was soo good. It doesn't look beautiful but it is delicious. I ate it with noodles and I loved it. I'm sure it is great with stuffing or mashed potatoes too. 
My gravy turned out a little lumpy so I probably did something wrong but it still tasted great. I will make this again for sure!

I did not make the recipe how I was supposed to. I basically made homemade chicken nuggets using this recipe and didn't make the gravy. But the chicken nuggets were good. My 2 year old son ate them!

Made this  cajun style but with cut up boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  I used my home blend cajun seasoning in the dustiing flour, and browned off the chicken well. Added a touch of Olive oil and the flour and cooked the flour  to get rid of the raw taste. I added celery, onion and red bell pepper, sauteed for a few minutes then added the broth and stirred till the gravy came together. Added back the chicken and covered and cooked till done . Checked for cajun seasoning and served with rice and green salad.

Think of this as easy to make chicken and gravy. I wouldn't have it every week, but I'll be making it again. We ate it with mashed potatoes, and I took the leftovers for lunch the next day. It's a good recipe for to use to get rid of those boneless skinless chicken breasts that you got on sale at the supermarket and are taking up space in your fridge.

This a great "base" dish that just begs for creativity.  I added poultry seasoning and tarragon to the spices and sautéed mushrooms and onions with the chicken.  Served over rice and it was delicious!  Family is already wanting to know when the leftovers are going to be served!

I really took this recipe and ran with it! I basically followed the steps, but then added pasta (I used elbow macaroni, but any bite size kind would probably work), bacon, and broccoli for a well-rounded dish. It came out great!

May not be anything extraordinary,  but a wonderful, inexpensive, family meal.  We serve it over mashed sweet potatoes.
