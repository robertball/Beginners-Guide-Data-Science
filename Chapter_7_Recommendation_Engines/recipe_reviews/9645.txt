USE PISTACHIOs is the key to a more original baklava (according to my Turkish hubby). Walnuts are cheaper but pistachios definately make the baklava tastes better.  Skip all those cloves and cinnamon, that stuff is for the Americanized taste. Taste the nut, butter and the good syrup.
Here is my syrup: purified water 1 3/4 cup, a small rectangular 2 inch cinnamon bark, 2 thin slice of ginger, 2 inches lemon peel (yellow part only), a touch (approx 1 tsp) of lemon juice. Let all those things boiled and simmer until the liquid reduce to 1 cup. Add  3/4 cup sugar and stir until dissolve, 1/2 tsp pure vanilla, 1 tbsp orange juice (no pulp)and turn the heat off. Add 1/2 cup of honey.  The syrup should be a light touch of golden color, and if you like you can put a 1/2 tsp of rose water or jasmine water.
Just make sure the temperature of the Baklava and the syrup is not the same, one have to be cooler than the other or you will get some very soggy baklava.

Some of the other reviews should definitely be consulted. I poured hot syrup on hot baklava and got a big moushy mess... I'll try it again with one or the other cold...

This is a great recipe! walnuts are better than pecans. to add flavor, you can take grounded pistachios and sprinkle them. take the advice and dont use cloves or cinnamon. you might want to add more syrup. remember not to pour hot syrup on hot baklava; one has to be cold, the other warm. you can switch the layers. for example i put seven layers of dough then walnuts then 7 more then butter, and then 7  more. then the butter and the pistachios. this is a great recipe though i think the syrup is too sweet. enjoy!

I added less water, simmered longer, and didn't add all the syrup I made...only adding syrup until the phylo dough was saturated. I used walnuts becasue they are cheaper. Pistachios would be too Lebanese, not Greek, so I would stick with the pecans or walnuts. This recipe has been a favorite at all my holiday parties, and even for small sweet snacks

Its great and easy to make this. I use Almonds instead of the recommended nut.I add orange blossom water and rose water as well to make it smells nice.With the syrup i add few tsp of the lemon juice and zest of lemon as well.My husband and his algerian friend loves it.My son loves it too.

I sent this to my mum, shes not such a good cook but she did enjoy making this. However she found that the phillo needs to be cool before you pour the mix onto it or you get some very hard baklava!

Cut the baklava before you bake it or it will just get all crushed.

I have been making Baklava for a very long time  but couldn’t find my own recipe.  I decided to use this one for the honey mixture. Although baklava is very simple to make  because the recipe is very standard, what separates one from another are the nuts and spices that are added. My only comment is, there is way too much honey mixture to put on the baklava and I can’t stand the waste.

The sauce could do with a little thickening, but the taste was definitely there! Sweet, yet somehow it tastes more natural than usual. I definitely approve of using pistachios, even if it's not "authentic".  Went without cloves, but it was still tasty! Definitely go with a hot sauce and cold, refridgerated cake. It's definitely a wonderful contrast.

It's really good!!! I made it twice so far, but the second time I made twice the amount of syrup to make it more mouth watering! The first time the liquid soaked into about half the baklava and left the top a little chewy. Doubling the syrup,made the whole baklava soft but still held together nicely. I am going to double the strip from now on just because that's how I like it. Keep in mind it will obviously be sweeter because your eating more syrup.

I use a mixture of pecans and walnuts and I toast them lightly in a frypan before making. Also, I  added a bit of lemon peel to the final syrup. Finally, I let my baklava cool completely overnight (loosely covered with foil) beforre adding the syrup.  This dessert does take two days to make, but it is worth the wait.
