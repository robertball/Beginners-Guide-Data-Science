One of my "go to" cakes.  The recipe is right - the batter is thin, but it bakes up perfectly. Two additions -- one teaspoon dry coffee added to the boiling water and about a 1/2 cup (+ or -) of Hersheys Chocolate Chips.  If you want to make this into a great poke cake, use a 13 x9 pan.  While cake is baking,  melt a bag of salted caramel chips from Hersheys and combine with a can of sweetened condensed milk.   After cake comes out of oven and cools slightly, poke holes with a wooden spoon in the cake and pour the  salted caramel topping over the top of the warm cake.

This is the gold standard of chocolate cakes!  I've been making this for years.. Excellent as the recipe is written.   Over the years I've make a couple of changes  I use 1 stick (1/2 cup) of melted butter instead of the oil and I add a heaping spoonful of instant coffee to the boiling water.  My family loves this cake.

We loved this cake.  It tasted so chocolatey.  Super moist.  So moist that it created a suction to the pan after cooling.  I used a silicone spatula to get it to break the suction.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This is one of the best cakes that I've had in a long time.  The layers are tender and the frosting spreads like butter. I love the intense chocolate flavor from the Special Dark Cocoa.

MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!  This is my absolute favorite chocolate cake.   My mother had made it for me years ago and I just had to have the recipe.  She found it on the back of a can of Hershey's cocoa powder.  I have been making it ever since.

While this cake seemed to be lovely, make sure you prepare your pans better than I did. I only used cooking spray and they stuck horribly to both pans. And I was even using fancy Williams Sonoma pans. Also the recipe says to let sit in pan for 10 minutes before turning out to cooling rack. I did not and that may be part of the problem of the cake sticking. Otherwise, the cake looks lovely!

Followed the cake recipe exactly and came out great! I used a vanilla frosting so I can't speak to the frosting. I had planned to make cupcakes but when seeing how thin the batter really was I realized that was not a good option and went with the cake. Definitely not a dry cake, but not the chocolate-iest chocolate cake either so if you're looking for fudgy chocolate cake this isn't it, but if you're looking for a quick and easy chocolate cake, go for it!

I wanted to give cake baking a try. I've never done it before. This recipe is super easy to follow and the results are amazing. I embellished my final creation with some strawberries and raspberries.

it was fantastic, for a first timer, with the kids helping, we were curious to see how it would turn out with the thin batter and all. 
we were happy to see it turn out so moist and yummy. 
The frosting is perhaps a little too sweet, but apart from that , it s great and we will making this cake again!!
Thank you for the recipe.

I've been baking this cake for years and don't change a thing. I was concerned the first time because the batter is not like normal cake batter; it is very thin and you will be positive it isn't going to work, but work it does. Excellent cake.  I've made it with the chocolate frosting but since my husband's favorite is chocolate cake with white frosting, I often substitute.  Either way, the cake is great!

The flavor was great, and the texture was good the day I made it. However, I made the cake a couple of days in advance, and the my cake was extremely crumbly the day I served it. I doubt I will make it again.

I chose to make the cake recipe into cupcakes, and I used a marshmallow filling for them (recipe from Sally's Addiction blog).  I took them to my daughter's school for the teachers, and they were a hit.  I wish I'd not put the marshmallows on top, but that made them more like S'Mores.  Good recipe!  Thanks, Hershey's Kitchens!
