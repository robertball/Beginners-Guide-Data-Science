I just made this recipe to try out for a breakfast item for a tailgating football event we are going to.  It is awesome!  I had the same issue as others where I fried them and then finished them off in the oven at 400Â° for about a 1/2 hour. I only had panko on hand and that worked great. I also used one pound hot and one pound of regular breakfast sausage to add some kick & doubled the recipe ingredients (except for pepper).  Using two pounds of sausage, I was able to make 11 scotch eggs.  Next time I will probably be able to squeeze out about 14.

Fantastic...just like I remember in an old english pub! I did try to "stretch" the recipe and used 6 egss instead of just the 4--perfectly fine.  Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box!!

I had these at a Renaissance Festival.  SO wonderful!  I was actually craving them days later and found this recipe.  The ones I'd had didn't have the bread crumb coating.  It makes them taste even better!!!  Baking them (turning once) on a broiling pan helps get rid of some of the fats.  Spicy brown mustard or sweet jams are good for dipping depending on your personal tastes.  

Great for brunches.

Love this recipe! I've made a few batches of this for family and friends. In some batches, I've used half pork sausage and half turkey sausage, and in others, I've used all turkey sausage and they both turn out great. I like to add about a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 1/4 tsp of additional sage, and 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes to kick up the flavor of the sausage. It's really easy to boil the eggs and prepare the sausage mixture the night before, then put together and broil in the oven the next morning for breakfast. Great recipe, thanks UKLAINE!

I have made these ever since my grandmother in law from Haddington Scotland taught me how. Only difference in recipe is, I use 1/2 original and 1/2 hot sausage.

Thanks for the delicious recipe.  These are a great idea for breakfast, brunch or even dinner.  

Since I had maple sausage on hand, I used that and omitted the Worstershire sauce. I also browned lightly and then baked them the rest of the way.  Served these for Christmas breakfast and they were a big hit with the family.

These were delicious!  I used 12oz of sausage and 6 eggs and it was the perfect amount.  I also followed suggesstions of baking them at 450 degrees for 45 minutes.  They turned out perfect!  Served them with a smoky horseradish sauce.

We'd had friends visit from England and recommend scotch eggs, these did not disappoint! Very tasty and pretty quick to whip together. We baked them at 425 for 45min turning once and served with spicy mustard. Excellent!

Excellent recipe, as good as I remember from New Zealand.  As per another reviewer, the outside cooked too quickly, leaving a couple of pink spots by the egg.  Had to microwave a couple of minutes.  Served with sliced tomatoes and colcannon from this site, for a nice light dinner.

This was an excellent breakfast at our lodge and a huge hit. Our hunters and fishermen alike loved that we could put these in a small cooler hot and they could have a warm breakfast in their duck blinds.

This was good, too greasy for me, but my boyfriend likes to experience food from my heritage! Although, Scotland is not known for spectacular cuisine! I would recommend that, if you are not much for greasy food you try the baked version.

I used Maple Sausage from a bag because I had it already and needed to use it - but it was really good.  The sausage was for me wasy to form around the hard cooked eggs.  I served it for dinner - but to me - it would make a better breakfast meal.  It deserves a special occasion - I will probably make them again

These didn't cook right in the time alotted but that was probably my error. They were too brown on the outside and were raw around the egg..I ended up putting them in the oven to finish, but they really tasted good!

I wanted to make these for years.  I cant believe how easy these are! I didn't use any more seasonings since I used Jimmy Dean sausage. I also used italian bread crumbs.  Kinda our own spin on this recipe.  I baked them for 45 minutes . The crust is nice and crunch. Just wait about 5 minutes after cutting them open.  Really hot! I am going to make some kind of dip/sauce next time.

This is a great base recipe! Everything cooked perfectly.  The only complaint that I have was that the breadcrumb coating was a little bit bland.  I will add more spices next time and it will be perfect!

I made these a while back, with 2 kinds of scones, to take to a  meeting my boy was having before his big trip to the British Isles.  We followed the directions, mostly, but did use a lb each of spicy and regular pork sausage.(we doubled the recipe) and skipped the W. sauce and flour after looking at a few other recipes.  Everyone in the group was hesitant but they ended up loving these and I shared the recipe with most of the mothers.  He rolled them all, and I fried them. (he is 12)

I used 5 eggs, but next time will do 6. Liked the recipe and was pretty simple. I used hot sausage, but will do half turkey, half sausage like others suggested next time. I baked them and they came out nice and crip.

This was fantastic and easy to make.   With the flour in sausage, the sausage held good form and stuck together really well.   I had used a seasoned breakfast sausage, so this did get to be a bit salty with the additional seasonings called for in my recipe, but that was my error.  The only thing that I think was off in the recipe was the cooking time.   I think about 3 1/2 or 4 minutes would have been better.

We lived in Ireland for 3 yrs and ate Scotch Eggs often. I was thrilled the first time we went to a Renaissance Faire and they were selling them. Well I made these last night  for the first time. I took the advise of browning them in the skillet first and then placed the skillet in the oven. I turned them half way through. My daughter who is one of those people who was born to cook., as she makes up her own recipes and very rarely fails, told me ..I "NAILED" it. Thank you Uklaine! I know now I will be making these often!

This is a good, reliable recipe for Scotch Eggs.  Simple and straightforward.   Kids with some experience in the kitchen could do this one!  However, I HATE to deep fry things, so I do like my mom always did with her Scotch eggs and I bake them at 375 for about 30 min.  Let them cool a bit before eating so you don't burn your tongue!

These were so good!  I will definitely make again.  I was able to make four eggs out of a 1/2 roll of sausage.  I baked for 40 minutes at 325 as per a previous post.

We made this project for my son's school project.  It was easy and we enjoyed making it together.  I definitely echo drying the eggs and dusting them in flour before wrapping with the sausage mixture.

I prepped the meat beforehand with hand sized amounts of meat (1/4 inch think) and departed them with plastic wrap.  Made building the scotch egg much easier.

We wrapped these bad boys in Bacon before frying.  I can hear our arteries clogging as we eat! We fried the whole thing for about four minutes the into a 350 oven for about 20 minutes.

These were fantastic! I used the suggestions from some of the reviews and mixed regular pork sausage with hot pork sausage.

Not an overly complicated dish to cook, and my family absolutely enjoy them every time I make 'em. Great for a quick breakfast if cooked prior, they make a great picnic snack. I would recommend them for any function.

I made the recipe as directed and they turned out well.  I also tried a few variations with panko and baked.  Baked at 400 degree for 40 minute!  Turned out well.  For a guten free option, used rice chex instead of bread crumbs and baked!  

Sometime, I eat it with white rice for breakfast.

I will be making it again, it is one  of my family favorites and mine I did have a recipe but lost so I thought I would look it up on here and was very when I found one but very disappointed when all they are is fried . Bake is the way to go with this. 350* I did for 25 minutes but will probably go longer next time. maybe 30 min.

Nice recipe.  Deep fried and then baked in oven at 350 for about 30 minutes.  Rolls were too big. Could probably get 6-8 eggs out of it next time.  Also gonna try substituting 1 pound hot Italian sausage next time.  Made a spicy Bearnaise sauce for dipping.

We absolutely loved these! Perfect snack. I serve with some HP Sauce and English mustard on the side to choose from for dipping.  Our local English Pub makes these and this recipe was right on par.

As I live alone I make several serving to freeze. I added 3 cloves of garlic, jalapeno chilies,  sprinkle of Worcestershire sauce and varieties of cooked veggies to containers prior to freezing.

I used Panko bread crumbs - this made them even better I believe. I knew they'd be good, but these were amazing.

I'm not sure what I may have done wrong.  The pork mixture came apart.. I followed the recipe exactly as it was posted.  I hope they taste better than they look....
THESE WERE DELICIOUS, AND I'LL DEFINITELY MAKE THEM AGAIN... I think my problem was that I used extra large eggs... next time, I will try smaller eggs...

These are excellent.  I've been making them for years and they taste great.  They're one of those things that taste better cold the next day. They only problem is they are just so darn messy to make.  But they taste wonderful and look amazing.  I always get requests for them at pot lucks, holidays and special occasions.
