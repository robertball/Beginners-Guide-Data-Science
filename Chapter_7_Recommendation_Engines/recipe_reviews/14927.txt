USE REAL BACON BITS! :) I made one with the pecans and one with real bacon bits and the bacon one was way better and was gone much faster. I also suggest NOT using the Chicken in a Biscuit crackers that others suggested. After I read the reviews I got them and they were way too salty with this already salty cheese  ball. Luckily I got those big round wheat crackers too and it was great with those. Will make again and again!

I have made this several times now since finding the recipe.  I personally like it better the first day when it still has a strong flavor, but we like a lot of flavor in the South!  It was better when I made it with Extra Sharp Cheddar, and I threw in a splash of worcheshire and chives. Also, I shaped it by putting saran wrap on top and forming it into a half cirlcle. It is also easier to eat that way.  Soooo Good!!!

This is such a pleasant surprise!  A perfect, easy appetizer that travels well.  Great for big parties!  Take NOTE:  This recipe is supremely better when served the next day (I've done both).  Any reviews regarding "too much" seasoning were probably served the same day.  When allowed to set overnight, the flavors really blend together wonderfully.

This was an outstanding cheese ball. The ingredients are simple and few. Preparation is easy and quick. I fixed it for our New Year Eve's party and it was a big hit! I followed the basic recipe, using extra sharp cheddar cheese, throwing in a few bacon bits, and rolling it in slivered almonds. However, the taste of the cheese ball with the ranch mix was superb. It went quite well on Triscuits. I think MOST everyone who tries this recipe will be well pleased.

This is very popular each time I make it.  Like other reviewers said, make it in advance to allow the seasoning mix to really seep into the cheese.  Otherwise, it will be too salty.  Also, all ranch seasoning mixes are not the same.  I recommend Hidden Valley Ranch.  I like to add crisp, crumbled bacon (NOT bacon bits!) if I have time.  It's great with sharp cheddar, too.

I ended up using 1/2 oz of the ranch dressing. Any more would be too strong and salty for me. I used up to 3 1/2 c of cheddar cheese also and added chopped green onions, then rolled in chopped walnuts.  Made two cheese balls, ate one and froze the other. I made the recipe the day before so the flavors could mingle. Thanks for the recipe!

3 stars as is. This is far too salty/tangy with the whole packet of ranch dressing mix. I put in 1 extra block of cream cheese and it improved this dish tenfold! So instead of using 2 (8 oz) blocks of cream cheese, use 3 and the recipe is perfect!

This has become a family favorite.  It is simple to prepare and everyone loves it.  It is great rolled in bacon bits.  Make sure you use the salad dressing mix and not the dip mix.  The high sodium content in the dip mix is shocking and would make the final product too salty.

Absolutely yummy and easy to make!  Tastes better the second day.  I used pistachios for the nuts and they made a beautiful and delicious shell.

This is the best cheese ball recipe I know of, I even gave some to my picky husband who also fell in love with it.  I did make a few changes...I soften both cheeses in my oven until warm and used sharp cheddar cheese. By doing this, made it a lot easier to mix, after mixing I covered it with plastic and placed the whole bowl in the refridge. for about 30 min or so.  I than took the bowl out and it was cold enough to form a ball, I took the advice from another reviewer by rolling it in real bacon bits instead of pecans, Eureka! Sooooo soooo good, OH! I almost forgot I made this the night before so all of the flavors had a chance to marry together.  Just Perfect!

Made this for a Christmas Eve party. It was awesome. Bought the twin pack of ranch dressing mix, almost added one whole packet and realized that it was a two ounce bag, not one ounce. Using one ounce made a perfect cheese ball! My family loved it, as did my guests. Thanks for sharing a great and easy recipe!
Update:have made it several times, it shapes really well. I have used it to make an igloo shape (cute with the cream cheese penguins), a snowman, and a mouse. It always works, and is always eaten quickly! Thanks for this recipe!

This is the easiest and yummiest cheese ball ever. My hubby loves it when I make it and friends and family rave about it when i make it for them too!
I however do it the "lazy" way and just mix the bacon bits and all the cheddar cheese into the mixture instead of rolling it on the outside... still just as yummy with a little less work when you are in a hurry!

I'm not a fan of cream cheese so I had to run a taste test before our Thanksgiving feast. It was a HIT!! I followed the recipe but used a fine shredded Wisconsin white cheddar as it's what I had on hand.  I also went easier on the pecans and chopped them finely for the coating.  This made 2 decent sized cheeseballs.  I've been asked to make them again for a party that's coming up! I used small round bowls and placed saran wrap in them and filled with the cheese and closed the end to shape properly and get out any air bubbles.  I refridgerated for a day, before serving I rolled the cheeseball in the pecans.  Both were polished off quickly!  Unless you have a food processor you're going to have to get your hands in there to mix well!!  Remember to use ranch mix and not dips, there is a 100mg sodium difference!

These were awesome ... I added chives, and had to use less ranch because I had the seasoning mix and not the dressing mix.  If I had used the full amount it definitely would've been too salty.  I will be making these again!

This cheese ball was a huge hit and was devoured in no time at all.  It was super simple to make and made a nice presentation.  Be careful to use ranch dressing mix and NOT the dip mix or you will find it to be very salty.  Next time I plan to make it with pepper jack cheese and maybe a little horseradish to add a little more zip.

I tried this recipe at a few gatherings. EVERYONE loves this cheese ball.They think it is very difficult to make, if they only knew.  My mother-in-law, who is the best at everything, asked ME for the recipe!! The 2nd time I tried this with slivered almonds and I like this much better. A sure hit for any party.
For an added kick, I chop a celery stalk and 1/2 an onion. I saute that in 2 TBSP of butter, let cool and mix with the rest of the ingredients.
If you cut the recipe in half you get a cheese ball the size of a large orange or a small grapefruit, I find that is plenty.

THIS IS A HIT!!!!!!!

Super easy and super yummy! I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I made mine into individual serving size balls, rolled them in pecans and added a pretzel "stem" and cilantro leaves to make them look like little pumpkins. They were a hit!

Great recipe.  I added 6 strips of crumbled bacon and about 3 green onions and it came out perfect.  Without those additions the flavor may have been a little bland for my taste.  I made it for Halloween so instead of rolling it in pecans I rolled it in crushed doritos, cut up black olives as a Jack o Lantern face, and added celery as a stem.  I plated it on kale and it was a huge hit!

Easy to make!  We use the "dressing mix" and not the "dip mix".  My 10 year old has adopted this as her specialty to take to family parties.  Good on butter crackers or wheat thins.  We make the recipe and divide in 1/2 so that one can have nuts and the other is plain (for those who don't like nuts).  I press each 1/2 into a small bowl lined with wax paper so that each has a semi-circle shape.  Then I serve them side by side surrounded by crackers.  Yum!

Made this for a family bar-b-q last week-end.  Everyone thought it was delicious, next time I think I will use the finely shredded cheese, as it was kind of hard to spread on the crackers.  Rolling the ball in real bacon bits is a brilliant idea. I also threw in some minced onion & Mrs. Dash.

I have made this cheese ball several times.  I like to use Fiesta Ranch instead of the plain Ranch dressing mix.  It gives it an extra kick.  Only use about 1/4 of the package.  I also use sliced almonds or cracker crumbs to roll the cheese ball in.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was pretty good, but I thought it was a little dry.  Could it have been because I used low-fat cream cheese?  Since it was so easy to make, I may try it again with regular cream cheese to see if that makes a difference.

This wasn't bad. I cut the recipe in half and am glad I did it makes alot. I added more cheese and substituted chopped Walnuts for pecans since that was all I had. I did notice that the cheese ball was a little strong due to the ranch dip mix and I can see it being Salty. Maybe I will try this again using an Onion dip mix instead.

My mom has been making this cheese ball for years, it is so good.  She finally gave me the recipe and I found it here!!  There is a minor change - she only uses 2 cups of chedddar cheese.  This is good with the ranch dressing mix but try it with the Italian Garlic & Herb dressing if you like Garlic as much as we do.  We also make 3 cheese balls instead of 1.  That way you can put one out and leave the others in the fridge until needed.  IF there is any leftover someone can take home a pretty chese ball, rather than a partially eaten one.

I used (1) 8 oz block of cream cheese & (1) 8 oz container of chive and onion flavored cream cheese-this added some great flavor!! Blended them together thoroughly. Added only (1) rounded tablespoon of dry ranch dressing mix--not entire package. Added finely grated sharp cheddar cheese to taste. Also had some finely grated Parmesan cheese so added some of that also. No measurements- just eyeballed it. Added a splash of Worstershire sauce and about (1/2) teaspoon of garlic powder. Mixed thoroughly. Formed (2) cheese balls from this mixture and chilled for about 2 hours. I toasted my pecans then chopped them. After the cheese balls had chilled, then rolled in chopped pecans. Very tasty and pretty!! Giving one as a Christmas gift.

This was terrific. I used low-fat cheese with no problem, and rolled mine in Hormel real bacon bits due to a guest with diverticulosis. Came out great, thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe for my daughter's 2nd birthday party. I must say that I didnt actually try it because I was so busy doing other things. But here is my oppinion on making it. This makes a HUGE cheeseball. I had 35 people and I had half leftover at the end. But anyways. I must stress that the cream cheese MUST be softened. I didnt have time to let it sit out of the fridge. And let me tell you my arm just about broke. My hubby and I had to take turns stirring. But aside from that I believe this was a good recipe. Everone seemed to love it. And my dad and aunt were fighting over who got to take home the leftovers! Thanks!!!

This is a great recipe. I don't use a full package of the Ranch, I just mix to taste. I add chopped green onions, fresh cooked bacon (have used Oscar Meyer bits, when in a pinch, too), about 4 slices of bacon, chopped. Then follow the rest of the recipe. You can also added diced sweet peppers, pineapple as well as other creative add ins. I did chose to roll mine in nuts, but only because I added the bacon inside. Otherwise, I would have rolled in bacon. Great recipe, and base for a recipe!

The title says it all - EASY! I made a more complicated one a few years ago that involved spinach and a few other ingredients, and this one was literally ready after a few minutes. I do suggest letting it sit in the fridge for a few hours or even days and let the flavors blend together.

I'm a huge fan of cream cheese dips, and this one was not very good.  Maybe it needed a few more ingredients.  After tasting it, I added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, which helped some.  My daughter, who is crazy for ranch dip and cream cheese, liked it a lot.

This was easy to make and an absolute hit at my annual Christmas party!  I was already asked to make this cheese ball for a New Years party!  This makes a very large cheese ball.  I actually made two, smaller cheese balls with this recipe.

made this for Christmas Eve.  personally, make this about 8 hrs. ahead of time and roll in pecans right before serving.  after waiting those 8 hrs., it's definitely not as salty and it's much easier to handle when rolling in nuts because it's alot more firm.  already planning on making this again for new years eve!

Okay everyone, here's the trick to take this cheese ball from good to superior... get a jar of dried beef to chop and add to the mix. BUT, be sure to allow enough time for this to sit in the fridge over night. It seems to make such a huge difference by allowing 12-24 hours for the flavors to meld together. Every time I make this, people ask for the recipe and they usually ask, "what's that added flavor, can't quite figure it out"? Dried beef..... ah! Keeps 'em guessing all the time.

It was delicious.I can't stop eating it. I made it the day before. I can see it might be strong for some but I liked it the way it was. For those who want a milder flavor, just use half a package of the dressing.

This is a great base recipe... you can add meat(s), cheese(s) and veggie(s) of your choice and I've made this w/Italian dressing mix as well (w/pepperoni, olives & green pepper bits! My favorite is making a cheese-ball snowman, using black olives for eyes, a ready-cut mini carrot as the nose and a green or red pepper scarf... buttons are optional like everything else!!!

This recipe was very easy and delicious! I added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce, a small spoon of horseradish, and a few finely chopped chives. I buy the ranch mix in a large canister, which didn't give the equivalent for the package-i had a hard time finding it on the internet--so if you need it, it's apx. 2 1/2 T. ( I heard 2, then i heard 3?) I am planning to roll them in crisp bacon pieces-only concern I have is how the bacon will hold up because I am freezing them, I hope it doesn't end up soggy?

This is a great and simple cheese ball.  I only had colby jack cheese on hand and walnuts instead of pecans.  The flavor is delicious!  I will make this again and again.  I know some have complained about there being too much ranch, but just add it to taste and problem solved!

Per other reviews, we added green onion and rolled in bacon bits instead of pecans.  Next time I would add some kick too. My daughter decorated it like a turkey (pecans and townhouse crackers for the feathers, red bell pepper for the head) and everyone loved it!

Nothing exceptional at all. Tasted just like a big wad of cream cheese with ranch dressing. Will not be making again.

This cheeseball is AWESOME! The only thing I did differently was added real bacon bits to the outside of the cheeseball as opposed to nuts. This cheeseball is huge! It was a hit at our party! VERY easy to make! Thanks for sharing!!

The ranch dressing mix really makes this cheese ball taste great.  Our dinner party of 13 practically ate the whole thing before dinner was served.  They loved it and the little that was left over was ate by my kids before bed.

I made this recipe today for Thanksgiving at a friends house.  I made it exactly as the recipe says and it was perfect, everyone raved about it.  I mashed the cream cheese with a potato masher and mixed in the cheese and ranch dressing with my hands.  It was not salty or too strong for us at all.  I can't belive how easy such a delicious recipe was to make.

My first cheeseball.  I was scared because I didn't know what to expect.  I was making it for a potluck at work.  They tried to tell me to buy some sort of tubbed cheese and this and that and worcheshire sauce(spell that on the fly, I dare you) and I was confused.  So I searched.  Went to giant eagle with a print out of the ingredients.  Bought the best(hidden valley, Sargento, and philly) and put it all together.  Was kinda hard to mix.  Guess I should've let the cream cheese soften like it says, but was short on time. I took the ball to work, and the work chef asked for the recipe.  Needless to say, there were 9 people eating.  The cheese ball doesn't exist anymore and it was a success(and super easy)  Note:  I bought triscuits and wheat thins.  another girl bought Townhouse crackers.  The townhouse crackers are gone.  I still have a box of triscuits and wheat thins.  Buy ritz or townhouse crackers.  people don't like wheat apparently. Oh, and I didn't use pecans.  Giant Eagle was charging too much for them.  So I used sliced almonds.  Oh, and I tried rolling it after balling it.  Didn't work, then I stuck it in the freezer for about 10 minutes and it rolled just fine.  Oh, and leave it sit over night, tried some after prep(shh, don't tell the girls at work) it was very ranchy.  Next day, was great.

This cheeseball is really nice!!  It went over very well at a get together.  I did not have a ranch seasoning packet so I used the dry ingredients to the "Ranch DressingII" recipe found on  the salads recipe page.  I also recommend you use the toasted slivered almonds.  They really make it something special.

This was excellent. Of course I added some things as I like depth of flavors.  1 tsp roasted garlic, 1 tbsp. worcestershire, and 1 tbsp. franks red hot. I wasn't sure about rolling in pecans as although I like them, I didn't think they would be good with the creamy cheese, but they were great! It got rave reviews.

Made this for "Girls Night"...everyone LOVED it! This is a great basic recipe that can take on many different flavor variations: I used only HALF of the ranch dressing mix; added dill, bacon bits, chopped green onions, finely chopped parsley and used sharp cheddar cheese. So many things one can do with this recipe, it's endless! (And makes a BIG cheese ball)...:o)

Very nice; made 2 med sized balls...I added real bacon bits since there are peanut allergies in the family, a few dashes of hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. I made it the day before so the flavours could meld together, and rolled them in smoked paprika to serve. I will be making this again..thanks for the recipe!

This was so good and so easy! We used a little lest ranch mix then it called for because I only had two small packets but it was so good! We mixed some nuts in the cheeseball and coated them on top and really enjoyed it.

Everyone loved this cheese ball which is not always the case when serving cheese balls.  I made sure I used Hidden Ranch original dressing mix.  This is so easy and so good!! It's a keeper.

This cheese ball recipe is very easy to make and tastes great!  I gave 6 away as gifts last year for Christmas and every one loved them.   I am making some right now for my family, it's become a nice tradition and it is just as good or better than Hickory Farms cheese balls.

I made the recipe with ingredients as listed.  I made sure I used the powdered ranch dressing, as opposed to dip, as other suggested.  The only change I made was in technique - I toasted the pecans for a few minutes in the oven.  Served it with wheat thin crackers and it was a big hit at Thanksgiving!

Very yummy and easy to make! I've never made a cheese ball before so I wasn't sure how it would turn out. I substituted a "fiesta" cheese blend for the cheddar and it turned out very well!

The nurses at my hubby's work were absolutely falling over their chairs for this, as was I from the comfort of my home :) with the one I saved for us!  Went awesome with wheat thins, and rolled in crushed almonds.

This recipe is great but I alter mine quite a bit. I do not roll mine in pecan or add cheese into the cheese ball. I do 2 packages of cream cheese, ranch dressing, 1 teaspoon tabasco sauce and 1 teaspoon of horseradish. It gives it a little zing. Then I roll my cheese ball in the shredded cheese. Serve chilled. I made this for thanksgiving and it was gone in 6 minutes. I couldn't believe it! It wasn't spicy but had a little zing to it and I couldn't stop eating it along with everyone else. My great grandma said that it was the best that she's ever eaten and she's 94 years old so that says a lot. Try this and you'll love it!!! It sounds kind of gross but it's not and I can't handle spicy foods, they kill my belly. Good luck and thanks for the recipe!!

As written, this recipe is way too salty. I know other people had this issue too. It was okay for the first few bites, but after that it was just too much. I did let it rest in the fridge and it didn't help much.

Followed the recipe exactly as stated. This was fantastic! Made a couple cheese balls for my sister's baby shower. Everyone thought they were the Hickory Farms cheese balls (for taste & appearance). Will be using this recipe a lot!

I love this cheese ball recipe.  I use it every year at Thanksgiving and turn it into  a turkey by putting sliced almonds all over it for the feathers, wooden skewers in the back with cheese blocks, grapes and other colorful food for the plumes and a slice of cheese for the gobbler.  It's always a big hit!

Yum! I used sharp cheddar cheese and added some chipotle Tabasco sauce - great for those of us who like a little zing - and it was wonderful!

A hit with our crowd. I used sun-dried tomato cream cheese and made two smaller cheese balls - one rolled in pecans and the other in bacon. About half of the pecan cheese ball was leftover, but the one with bacon was devoured.

Outstanding appetizer! I caused a party back-up with this great, fast recipe. Nobody would leave the table. Girls begging for the recipe too.   I used one light cream cheese, one regular cream cheese, 2 1/2 cups of pre-shredded 2% milk cheese, plus the ranch dressing mix. Then, rolled in Hormel real bacon bits. Also, I made the night before which helped flavors marry.

This is 5 stars all the way! So easy and soooo good. I'll never BUY another cheese ball again! Changes I made were: I added a splash of worchestershire sauce and I rolled it in slivered almonds. I have made this 5 times since I found the recipe 2 weeks ago for different event! VERY, very good! You must use the Ranch dressing mix and NOT the dip mix. Don't forget!

We really like this easy cheese ball, and it is pretty easy to keep the ingredients around for last-minute gatherings.   We tried using taco seasoning instead of ranch dressing mix and that is really good, too. We plan on trying chili seasoning, as well as onion soup mix, to see how they turn out.

Great recipe! I toasted the pecans first (be sure to let them cool) and they gave that extra rich flavor and crunch to the cheeseball. Also, this recipe makes a huge ball and seemed to serve twice as many people as indicated. The next time, I made two medium/large ones and it worked out great.

I made a different cheese ball for years, but came across this one and decided to try it. YUM! I changed it a little. I used sharp cheddar and added tabasco sauce, worcestershire sauce, left out the dill, added green onions. We will make this again and again. Thanks

Hard to believe that this cheeseball is so great and only uses 4 ingredients.  Definitely make a day ahead, cheeseballs always taste better the next day after the flavors have time to sit together.  Everyone always loves this recipe!!!

Easy this certainly was.  But I didn't find anything special about it.  I rolled it in sliced almonds.  Was ok, but needs more to it to make it worth making again.  Maybe a stronger cheese like blue cheese or feta?  (I guess I just prefer stronger flavours) Other reviewers are quite correct about leaving it overnight in the fridge before serving as it is very salty at first.

This recipe was wonderful!!  I did not change anything about it.  If you taste the cheese ball the same day you make it, it's very salty.  If you serve it the next day, it's perfect.

This was soooooo good! It was very salty, but I like food that way. If you don't, I would definetly cut back the ranch mix. I will definetly make this again and again!

I'm making this again for our Thanksgiving family get together.  It is quick, can be made the day before, and is DELISH!  I've made the original recipe and sometimes I've added green onions, sometimes red peppers, sometimes both.  It's a very versatile recipe that can be changed based on your mood or what you have on hand.  Thanks again for a great recipe!

Delicious and Easy! I had never made a cheese ball and this was very easy to make. I used slivered almonds which I toasted, and kept the other ingredients the same. However, I felt it made a huge ball and would either make it into 2 balls or 1/2 the recipe. I served it with a variety of wheat and water crackers. It went over well.

This was a real hit at Christmas and I had multiple requests for the recipe. I made a double batch of this and used some of it to make a ball exactly as written for my vegetarian guests. They loved it! I divided the rest into smaller balls with crispy bacon bits (the real thing). The bacon version flew off the table and I had to replace with another ball after only 20 minutes! Some of my guests were also spreading this on celery sticks from my veggie tray. I'm glad I made extra!

Great recipe as is and is a fantastic base recipe for additional ingredients. I plan to experiment with fillings and coatings. Thanks!

For such a simple thing, this was delicious! I took the advice of others and only used about 3/4 of the dressing packet, and I also prepared several hours in advance so that the flavors had time to meld together. I also roasted the pecans before I coated the ball, which sort of made it a little more special. Served at Christmas as an appetizer for about 20 people, and it was GONE by the night's end! So yummy and easy!

I used REAL BACON BITS instead of the pecans and it was awesome. I did cut the recipe in half as the full would have been to much for what I needed it for. I highly recommend the recipe and it's easy to make for parties.. Enjoy!

This recipe was OK.  The taste was pretty good.  My main complaint was that after chilling it was very hard, not spreadable at all.  I guess it needs to be brought to AT LEAST room temperature before serving.

I didn't have Ranch Dressing mix so I added my own spices like Cayenne pepper, garlic, basil, and added a little fetta cheese. I made this for my Halloween party and it was gone in no time!!! Everybody was telling me my cheese ball was the bomb! I chopped a few onions added them in and I did bacon bits inside as well as on the outside w/ crushed pecans. YUM, YUM, gonna make this for Thanksgiving and Christmas!!

Really good.....but VERY salty, even after 2-3 days in the fridge.  Would love to know how to cut the salt without cutting the ranch flavor.

The only things I added were: finely chopped chives, real bacon bits, and a bit of worchershire sauce.  I wrapped it up after making it and let it sit in the refrigerator for several hours.  When served at our Christmas party, it was a huge hit!  My father-in-law just called and said it was so good that he ate the leftovers with a fork (no crackers) because it was so good!  And my in-laws are EXTREMELY picky eaters.  So I think this is a 5 star recipe!

Is it simple? Absolutely! Is it the best cheese ball we've had?  No. The ranch is a bit too tangy and salty.  Thanks for the simplicity though.

I thought the ranch flavor was too strong, but I let it sit over night like everyone suggested and it was still too much for me, but my husband loved it.

I made this dish exactly as given and it was awesome.  It was too thick to use a cracker to "dip" so I sliced off pieces.

This is easy, but so is Hamburger Helper. It tastes very artificial, no freshness whatsoever, and even after sitting overnight in the fridge, it is still way too salty. The flavor combination is very boring. There is too much cheddar cheese. Overall, not good.  There are way too many cheese ball recipes out there to try to "fix" this one with adjustments.

SO good.  Everyone at the party thought I bought it.  It looks very impressive.  I doubled the recipe, I had about 16 people attend, and one cheeseball would have been plenty.  I used Townhouse crackers and it tasted de-lish!!  It was also SO SIMPLE to make.  I didn't change the recipe at all. Highly recommend!

This recipe has been around forever because it is so tried and true.  My momma and my momma's momma all used to make this recipe all the way back since they started making powdered Ranch dressing and processed cream cheese.  It is the easiest thing to throw together, and for some reason everytime I take it anywhere people just rave about what secret ingredients must be in it!  They always guess garlic or something fancy, and they never believe me when I tell them how easy it is!  Recently I discovered a new cracker that absolutely makes this cheeseball, and I haven't been able to go back!  Ritz came out with these new half-pretzel, half-Ritz crackers, and they are FANTASTIC with this cheeseball.  They make a great thing even better--try it out!  Our family also always serves this with summer sausage cut into little triangles to go on the regular Ritz or Triscuit crackers with the cheese.  The summer sausage adds something I think.  Also, I have made this with regular cream cheese, 1/3 fat and fat free, and I find the 1/3 fat is a good middle ground for a healthier choice.  The fat free tends to not stand up as well as a "ball".  Although the fat free does make for a decent stiff cheese dip.  Great recipe!!

This is a simple recipe and it was a good recipe to make in a hurry because I had all the ingredients on hand.  It was especially easy because I used a mixer to blend and a mini food chopper to coarsely chop the pecans.

This cheese ball was good, but I thought a full packet of ranch dressing mix was too much.  There was just too much of a tang and it didn't hit my taste buds the way I would've wanted, so I added about 1 c. more cheese and about 4 oz. more cream cheese.  I wish I had some bacon bits because I know that would've been delicious, but I didn't so I thought I would try to offset some of the tang from the ranch and I threw in about 1/2 of a small can of pineapple chunks and some juice for a little bit of sweet.  I also added a couple squirts of lemon.  The pecans I used were so good and I did not toast them like some reviewers suggested...I don't think that it's necessary.

I will definitely make this again because this one turned out pretty good with my little adjustments.  Next time, I will follow the recipe exactly, except that I will not us the whole packet of ranch and I will make sure that I have some bacon bits and maybe some chives to throw in.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first cheese ball, and it was an easy success! Other than adding bacon (as asked by my boyfriend), I followed the recipe to a T. My cream cheese wasn't very soft after sitting out for a bit, so I threw it in the microwave for 30-40 seconds. It still wasn't extremely soft but manageable. While I was chopping the pecans, I decided to throw some into the Magic Bullet to see how that would work out. I ended up with a pecan "paste" (really finely chopped), so I hand chopped the rest of the pecans. I crumbled up bacon instead of using bacon bits. I threw the bacon, the chopped pecans, and the pecan "paste" into a baggy and shook it to thoroughly mix the 3. I poured some out a little at a time and rolled my cheese ball in it. The "paste" really helped "glue" everything together, so I will do it again next time. The flavors of the ranch dressing are really strong the first day (but still good), but becomes milder by the next day and incorporates into the cheese (which I like better). I brought some to my boyfriend's work last night, and his coworkers all raved about it! All in all, a very simple and delicious recipe that I will be using over and over again!

I needed a quick cheese ball  for company and thought I would give this a try.  Everyone loved it.  I will be using this recipe often.  Thanks for sharing!  UPDATE:  I have made this many times now and I use one package (2 cups mild cheddar) and add 3 green onions, chopped.

Hands down the BEST cheese ball i've ever had, and VERY easy to make!  however you MUST let it sit for 12-24 hours in the fridge for the seasoning to blend.

I made this as a test run before the holiday parties.  I always test something new before taking it to a party.  This made a huge cheese ball, I sampled the day I made it and it was VERY strong and salty.  So much so that I could only handle a few bites on crackers.  Once it sits it does get better and you're able to eat more.  I plan on making this again for a Christmas Eve and Christmas party.  I will make 2 cheese balls and add green onion, bacon and whatever else I can think of before then.

I did make a few changes, but the result was incredible! I've made it several times this holiday season already!

First of all, Cheese Balls aren't meant to be healthy, so I took NO short cuts!

My recipe includes the cream cheese and the ranch dressing mix as called for. From this point on, I improvised, using many suggestions from previous reviews.

I used FOUR cups of cheese! Two cups of Sharp Cheddar and Two cups of Salsa Jack. YUM!

I added a packets of pre-packaged bacon bits... real bacon, and chives ( I didn't measure ).

Finally, I added about six dashes of Habanero Sauce. This gave it a very slight kick. Trust me, it was not hot at all, just added some wonderful flavor.

As mentioned before, it is very hard to mix. I use, as recommended in the reviews, a potato masher after making sure the cheese is room temperature.

Then, after mixing as good as possible, I put the mixture in the oven at 170 degrees for 10 minutes. After that, the cheese mixes beautifully and easily molds into a ball, which I then covered with pecans.

Yep..... it's good!!

Great!  Easy to make and very tasty.  

Note:  Make sure you let it sit at least overnight.  The ranch is very strong at first, but after sitting dies out.

We brought this cheeseball to a Superbowl party, and everyone raved about it!  I actually felt a little guilty since it got more attention that the other, more time-consuming treats that other people brought!  I have also made it for Thanksgiving and a work party, and it always disappears with many compliments!  It is the easiest and cheapest appetizer I've found.

I just snuck away from my Christmas party to post this reveiw. I have one word for this chesseball,UNBELIEVABLE! And for how simple it was to make (maybe 5 mins from beginning to end) I would never buy one from the store again. Its recipies like this that build a reputation. Every one thinks Im a culinary genious (and if you knew me, you would know why this is so amazing!!!).

This recipe was absolutely simple but yet delicious!  I made a few adjustments to it but that's the beauty of this simple recipe - it's a great "base" to work off of and it tastes great either by itself "as is" or when you add a few items to it.  I used (1) pkg regular cream cheese and (1) pkg of low-fat cream cheese, added 1/2 of a green bell pepper (minced), some green onions, and only added 2 c. of shredded cheddar cheese (it was all I had on hand).  And it came out great!  I loved it!  My husband, who doesn't care for "too much cheese", gobbled up most of it!  Thanks for a wonderful cheese ball recipe.  I have family coming from CA for Christmas so I'll definitely be making more for them!

My family loved this cheese ball!! How very simple it was to make. I added chopped green onions and a little garlic powder and it was perfect. I think the key to this being easy is to make sure your cream cheese is softened before trying to stir it. I am going to make these as christmas gifts. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was excellent.  I halved the recipe and the size was perfect for our gathering of 7 people. In fact, I have some left over and I have to say on the third day this was much better tha it had been, so if you make this, give the flavors at least 3 days to marry in the fridge.  Great recipe!

This is an AMAZINGLY simple recipe that can be used at the most ELEGANT occassions!  It's simply delicious!  I have made it twice, and it was a hit both times.  I usually make 2 balls, and roll one in bacon, and one in pecans.  The bacon one dissappears fastest!

Absolutely wonderful!  It's even better if you let it refrigerate for at least 8 hours before serving, giving all the flavors time to infuse.  I covered mine in sliced almonds and everyone loved it!

I made this for a Christmas Eve buffet.  Everyone actually thought it was "store bought".  It was so easy to make.  I ran out of pecans so I chopped up some honey roasted peanuts, mixed them in with the chopped pecans and it was very good.

I really expected more from this cheese ball, based on the reviews, but quite honestly, it didn't impress either me or my guests.  I made the Dried Beef Cheese Ball and this one, and the dried beef ball defintely was a bigger hit.

We loved this!!!  Someone brought this to our Thanksgiving party, minus the pecans and it was great.  There was very little left and we finished it off that evening.  The ranch makes it even better.  Great cheeseball!!

I had never made a cheeseball before, so I thought that for a New Year's appetizer I would make a couple.  I made this one and two others from the list.  I set all 3 on the table and before I got back with the rest of the appetizers, this one was half gone!!!  I guess that speaks for itself...I will definitely be making this again...thanks for sharing...it is definitely easy and EXCELLENT!!!

I found this recipe last year around Christmas time and used my friends as guinea pigs during our yearly gift exchange. It was gone long before any of the other more complicated recipes I'd tried. This has become a staple for me to take to gatherings and EVERYONE loves it. My husband can't get enough of it and always asks me to make an extra one to eat at home. GREAT recipe! SO easy too!

This cheese ball was really good and EASY! I made it for Thanksgiving. Everyone asked for the recipe.  I used toasted-slivered almonds for the nuts, just because I happened to have them on hand. This recipe's a definite keeper.

Easy and good. I divided this into 2 balls and froze one for this upcoming weekend. Definitely would suggest letting it sit overnight. The day it was made before rolling it up I tried a tiny bite and wowza it was powerful, but after sitting all night it was mellowed out some. Next time I think I will cut back on the ranch as it was just a bit to much. Other than that won't change anything. Thanks for the easy recipe.

Very good!  Dressing mix....picked up dip mix by mistake but read reviews and used about half a packet....had mild cheddar cheese and it was just too mild so I added:  Sharp shredded cheddar cheese and about 8 ounces of crushed pineapple.  Rolled in chopped pecans.  When I tried it last night it  seemed like nothing special BUT today the flavors had mingled and it is superb!!!  Not much left after a morning Advent gathering.  Thanks for sharing!

I always make this recipe a day ahead and refrigerate overnight.  It's big enough that I sometimes split it into two cheese balls.  Everyone loves it!

Fantastic recipe!  I make this for every party and it always disappears.  It makes two medium sized cheese balls.  I think it is best when made the day before and refrigerated overnight.  Usually I add Worcestershire Sauce to taste (1-2 tbls) to give it a nice smoky kick.  This is a must try recipe!

I served this with vegetable wheat thins and it was AMAZING!  What a great recipe!  I had never made a cheese ball before and learned to put it in a metal bowl in the fridge for a few hours before you roll in pecans.

Pretty tasty recipe. You can add chopped green onions for extra flavor, and if you don't have pecans, walnuts can be substituted by adding a little Splenda to sweeten them up.

Since I was doing SO much cooking Christmas Eve, I needed an appetizer to throw together in a pinch that was more than just sliced cheese and crackers.  This turned out to be a BIG hit.  I'm sure the recipe is fine as is.  However, I tweaked it a bit. I always keep freeze dried chives in the fridge, so I threw a palm full of those in, and added an extra cup of shredded cheese.  Took another AR cohorts suggestion of rolling it in real bacon bits.  The recipe made enough for two cheese wheels.  This is a good, basic recipe you can embellish.

I read the review that suggested adding more cream cheese, so had an extra block on hand.  As written, it was too strong for my taste.  With the extra block of cream cheese, it was perfect.  I also added some green onions.  I might try adding 1 Tbsp. of worcestershire sauce next time.  Delicious!  The whole family loved it.

Yummy!  Kinda reminds me of beer dip, which is also delicious.  
This was super easy to make.  
Per other reviewers suggestions I did get Real Bacon Bits.  I suggest using half bacon/half pecans.  That combo is amazing, you wouldn't expect pecans and bacon to go together, but they compliment each other perfectly.
I also used extra sharp cheddar and toasted the pecans.

I made this for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews from my family!  I accidentally picked up glazed pecans but the sweetness, oddly enough, meshed well with the ranch flavor.  It was very easy to make and everyone loved it!

This was a tasty recipe! Half was plenty for a small gathering (8-10 people). I rolled it in chopped bacon as opposed to pecans, using all but 4 slices of a regular-sized pack of bacon.

This wasa huge hit at a halloween I attended. I used spicy ranch and added 1/8 cup of real bacon bits. I used a form to shape my cheese into a face and wrapped it in proscuitto rather than roll in nuts. The proscuitto was wonderful with the cheese. This has been added to one of my favorites.

Super easy and delicious. You can easily substitute pecans for chopped almonds and other flavored powdered mixes instead of ranch dressing (I used a sun-dried tomato mix).

This was delicious! I cut the recipe in half and I still had leftovers. I added 2 tbsp of bacon bits and used the kraft already shredded Monterey jack,mozzarella, and cheddar mix. Next time I will add some green onions and some pepper flakes for some spice

Great recipe -- easy and doesn't require many ingredients.  I added a few dashes of Worchestershire  to mine.  This recipe makes an excellent base and you could add many different things to change it up, or it's great as is.  I'll definitely make this again.

The people complaining of the cheese ball being too salty probably did one of two things.....bought the dip mix instead of the DRESSING mix or used less han 16 oz of cream cheese.  I just made it accorsing to instructions (plus added green onions) and it is perfect.  There is no way that you can say this cheese ball is salty if you followed the recipe.

I just made this cheeseball and it took less than 10 minutes. It tastes very good. I am taking it to a staff get together tomorrow and I know it will be a hit. Very easy to make! I served it with Keebler type crackers.
UPDATE: I was told by fellow teachers that anytime we have a potluck or get together that this cheeseball is what I should bring!

I would definitely suggest cutting the recipe in half (or at least only serving half at a time) because it is a BIG cheeseball!!  It was VERY yummy.... my brother even asked to take what little was left home with him on Thanksgiving!  Have tried it with bacon added, and that makes it extra yummy!!!

I recently made 12 pounds of this cheese ball for my daughter's wedding.  Although I had to much, it was very well received and keeps well for a long time in the refrigerator.  Be sure you use ranch dressing mix and not ranch dip mix.  The dip mix is much saltier.

Great!  I added real bacon pieces and chopped green onions, as others have suggested.  You must let this sit overnight, at least, if not make it two days before.  The longer the flavors have to relax, the better it is!  1 recipe made 3 good-sized servings for me, and I rolled 1 in pecans, 1 in parsley, and 1 in almonds.  Can't wait to make it again!

Great cheeseball! I usually add some chopped dried beef or bacon bits. Also I have made them into little bite size balls for a little something different.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!! I was looking for something simple to snack on and I had all of the ingredients on hand.

I must admit I though the ingredients without the pecans were a bit salty which concerned me, but after I rolled the pecans on the ball it was GREAT!

I do recommend letting the cheese balls "set" in the fridge for at least a day because it tastes much better.

I will definitely serve this the next time I entertain. Thank you!!

I love this cheese ball!  The ranch mix definitely gives it a great flavor too!  I made this exactly as the recipe reads (letting it sit overnight in the fridge), and took it to my Mom and Dad's for Thanksgiving this year.  Mom made me leave it there when we left that night!

The only thing I might do differently next time, is make two smaller balls out of the mixture instead of one huge ball.

Easy easy easy to make.  I needed to whip up something quick for guests and chose this recipe.  I have never made a cheese ball before, but this one seemed simple.  I used a mixer to mix the ingredients together then used saran wrap to help form the ball shape so that I didn't get to dirty. I put it in the fridge for a couple of hours.  My guests gobbled it up. Everyone was asking where I bought it and no one could believe it only took me a few minutes to make.  Will be making this one over and over again! Thanks!

This is a great cheese ball.  I do, however, add to it.  It is SO easy to make it even better.  I just use some chives, real bacon bits, and tabasco and it turns out really well!  Also, use the fine shredded cheese b/c it makes a big difference.  I also toast the almonds.  Even if you use pecans, toast them and it makes it taste really good.

I made only half a recipe, the cheese ball was the same size as a premade cheese ball from the store.  I took some others advice and rolled it in Real bacon bits (Hormel, in a jar).  Everyone really like it!  I felt that it was a bit too salty for me... may try a diffrent recipe next time.  But, this one was VERY easy and got good reviews from everyone at the party.  Hint:  try microwaving the cream cheese  for only a few seconds (15-20) then mix in the ranch dressing then the cheddar cheese.  Mine mixed great.  I then formed the ball in the mixing bowl with my spoon and dropped the cheese ball onto a plate that had bacon bits already on it.  Use the bacon bits that are on the plate (and not under the cheese ball) to sprinkly on top and around the cheese ball.  This will be much easier to handle and there won't be a sticky mess trying to roll the cheese ball in bacon bits or nuts.  I made mine the night before our party, it does harden up alot.  I would recommend using a cheese knife, otherwise your crackers will break if trying to scoop it up with them.

I made this for Christmas Day and my family loved it. I made a few changes by adding fresh chives & parsley, hot sauce, a couple splashes of worcestershire and I rolled it in almonds. My family said it was the best cheese ball they'd ever had.

What a hit at my party last night!!!  I made one following the directions to a T and then made an additional one with a mozzarella/provolone cheese mixture rolled in slivered almonds.  BOTH were a major hit and will definitely be served again and again in this household!!!

A good recipe.  Not mind blowing like some other reviews have stated.  I made this for a party, used extra sharp cheddar and a dash of worchestershire sauce, let it sit overnight and made it into two cheeseballs...one of which I brought to the party.  I had 3/4 of it left to bring home.  We've been snacking on it and it's good, but nothing earthshattering.  I might make it again and try to jazz it up with some other spices or veggies.  It would be easy to add to.

I make this every holiday season, using sharp cheddar, and I blend the cheeses and spices together in the food processor to get a consistent texture.  Always a hit wherever I go - SO MUCH better than a store-bought cheese ball.

This is an old recipe I've used for years now...I make it for my husband to take to work on holidays and it is the first thing to go!  Everyone loves it and everyone asks for the recipe.  They can't believe how easy it is to make!  The flavor is luscious, just perfect.

Love this Ranch Cheese Ball recipe! My family is hooked!! The ranch flavor gives it a real kick. Two cream cheese makes it easy to spread on crackers also. Very quick easy recipe!! I roll mine in chopped walnuts instead.

I really didn't enjoy the flavor of this cheese ball - it seemed too salty, and the ranch flavor overrode the cheese taste. I would perhaps try using less of the dressing mix next time, because it was really simple to make... Plus I'm giving it 4 stars because I took this to a work function and it DISSAPPEARED, so someone must like it. :)

Love this recipe! I made it last year for the holidays and will making it again this year. My kids couldnt get enough of it. I didn't have nuts on hand so I rolled mine in unsalted sunflower seeds for that nutty taste. Yummy!

THIS WAS A BIG HIT THANKSGIVING DAY WITH 30 HUNGRY PEOPLE.IT WAS SO EASY TO WHIP UP.MAYBE THE NEXT BATCH I'LL REMOVE A SMALL AMOUNT AND ADD A LITTLE FRESH GARLIC AND A SPLASH OF HOT SAUCE JUST TO SEE IF THAT WOULD ADD SOMETHING TO IT..(I JUST CAN'T LEAVE A RECIPE ALONE!!)DON'T GET ME WRONG, IT IS A GREAT RECIPE AS IS! THINK I'LL DOUBLE THE BATCH FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS FOR MY GAL PALS.I'LL USE THE PADDLE ATTACHMENT ON MY MIXER TO MIX THE BIG BATCH. THANKS A BUNCH.

I made this ball for all my British friends who had never seen a cheese ball before. It was a massive success. So easy to make. I tend to put finely chopped pieces of green onion in and leave it for awhile to get it a bit of a kick.

After reading such great reviews I was surprised when I took this to a housewarming and it was barely touched. I didn't care for it and the other guests didn't go back after trying it. I think the 1 oz of dry mix was too strong. Maybe half would be better but I don't plan to make it again.

I can not believe how easy this was! It turned out great! 
I used walnuts instead of pecans, just because I had them. This recipe made a very big cheeseball; I'll probably cut the recipe in half next time. I'm so glad that I found this. Thanks for posting it!

This cheeseball was so easy to make! I used walnuts instead of pecans and it was great. I also used some of the nuts inside of the cheeseball as well as on the outside.

I use a similar recipe that omits the cheddar cheese and includes cayenne pepper (amount depends on your taste).  I rated it a 4 for kids because they might not like the hotness. Definitely a winner at parties!!!

This is a recipe that I've been making for several years and everyone just LOVES it. When I give out the recipe (from memory, of course) no one can believe how easy it is! I always double the amount when I take it to parties because it goes so quickly.  My husband can eat a full recipe by himself!

A little late reviewing but using this recipe again for New Year's.  I first used it at Halloween instead of pecans I covered it in crushed Doritos and put a celery stick on the top for an adorable and tasty pumpkin. EVERYONE loved it!

A big hit! As suggested. I used bacon bits instead of pecans and found spicy ranch dressing mix. Everyone loved it. Definitely a keeper.

First time  cheese ball maker! Only four stars being as I tweaked it. This recipe is super simple and very tasty! I followed other reviewers advice right off that bat because it sounded like it would fit our tastes a little better. I only used 3/4pk of dry Ranch dressing mix and rolled the chilled cheese ball in real bacon bits vs nuts (because everything's better w/bacon right?). Everyone was impressed and I've been writing down the four ingredient recipe and handing it out left and right. This will definitely be on the appetizer table this Thanksgiving (w/Ritz crackers) and many get togethers to come. Thanks!

I just made my first cheese ball, which was way easier than I ever imagined. I used a cup and a half sharp cheddar (preshredded) and a cup a cup or so shredded pepper jack (block). I cut and cooked 6 slices of thick cut cherrywood bacon and added it to the cheese mixture along with a splash or two of Worcestershire sauce and Louisiana hot sauce and the whole package of ranch mix. Follow a few others recommendations, I'll be rolling it after it sits for a bit, in some chopped pecans. Can't wait!

This is the First cheese ball that I ever made and it turned out great.  The only change was to leave out 1 tbsp of the Ranch dsg and added one green onion per other viewers suggestions.
Also, I only needed two cups of shredded Cheddar cheese.
I actually got Two cheese balls out of this recipe.  I will make it again.  Thanks!

I split the cheese mixture into 2 portions. One I added more herbs and rolled in basil for the vegetarians and the other I added 1/4 cup of bacon and rolled it in bacon. Both were hits! :)
Oh... I also wore nitrile gloves so I could really mix it together without loosing any under my nails! :)

Its ok... I only used less than half pack of ranch after reading the reviews and whew! Its way too ... "Ranchy"??  Unless that's your aim, I would only use a teaspoon of the ranch, two tops.
I also added yellow and green onions.

This was a very simple yet pretty tasty cheese ball!  I fixed it per the recipe but as others have mentioned, make it beforehand and let sit in the fridge.   I tasted it right after I made it and wow.... All I tasted was the Ranch seasoning mix.  Bleh. However,   I made it a day before my party and its amazing how much better it tasted the next day.  The seasoning mix disappaited and was absorbed into the cream cheese so it was much milder.  My party guests really enjoyed it!

This simple cheese ball is a party favorite in my family.  I combine the cheeses/ranch mix the day before and let it rest in the refrigerator overnight.  The next day, I roast the chopped pecans (makes a huge difference in the flavor profile) and roll the cheese ball in the nuts shortly before serving.  (This way, the flavors of the cheese ball have a chance to meld, but the nuts stay crunchy and crisp.)  Hint:  Bring your cheese ball to room temperature before you roll it in the nuts (the cheese will become a little tacky and help the nuts stick to the ball).

I carried this to work, and it was a hit. Several asked for the recipe. I did follow someone's review and rolled the cheese ball in bacon bits. It was a nice change over the usual pecans.

Delicious cheese ball and easy to make. I did use about 1/4 stick extra of cream cheese because I was worried about several remarks regarding the saltiness. I refrigerated it overnight in an airtight container and then pressed the chopped pecans onto it just before serving.

I make this all the time and my friends LOVE it... I have made several alterations... I add smoked paprika to give the base cheese a smokey flavor... then remove 1/2 of the mixture set aside. To the remaining 1/2 I add jalapeños, banana peppers, cayenne, chipotle in adobe, habaneros... whatever pepper you like - my friends like it hot. 

To the original batch I add additional smoked paprika to the nuts (and I usually use smoked almonds because I buy them in bulk)... for the Hot pepper version I add chipotle chili powder to the nut mixture. YUM!!!

I also form more of a log so you get more nuts/smokey flavor in each bite.

So easy and so good.  I've made this a couple times now.  I only use 2 cups of cheese (because I buy the pre shredded and they come in pkgs of 2 cups).   This is a good base for additional add ons.  I've also made it with bacon and green onions.  I've also used a Mexican style cheese.  This is definitely a keeper.

This cheeseballs is amazing!  I tripled the recipe for a wedding, and it yielded 10 mid-sized cheeseballs!  They were so good, I bought more ingredients to make for my husband and I to enjoy with some wine.  Will definitely be making again!!

I made this for New Year's Eve.  It was amazing - everyone loved it.  I did add 6 strips of cooked, crumbled bacon bccause my husband loves bacon and I skipped the pecans because he is not so fond of them.   But I am sure it would be just as amazing made as directed.

I used cheddar cheese and 1/2 of a ranch dip packet.  I will try this next time using a ranch dressing (not dip) packet.  I liked it, but the seasoning/salt flavour was pretty intense, even the next day.

6 years ago I found this recipe. I wanted to make a cheese ball for my appetizer table at Christmas.  My family loved it! It's now a Christmas favorite and a tradition. The only change that I make is that I use real bacon pieces instead of pecans (thanks to another reviewer's suggestion).  I also use only half of all of the ingredients because I need a smaller ball.  But other than those two changes, I follow the recipe exaxtly as is and it's perfect!

Amazeballs! Everyone loved this! I made this one day ahead of time and used Monterey Jack instead of cheddar and nuefchatel instead of cream cheese. Hidden Valley Ranch for the seasoning packet. No problems with too salty or tangy as reported by another reviewer.

This cheese ball was a hit at my holiday party! I did not have any pecans so I rolled the cheese ball in bacon bits (who doesn't love bacon) which was such an incredible addition! The rich cheese, ranch taste and smoky bacon on buttery crackers was so great that my family requested that I make it for every party. Thanks for the recipe!

This was yummy and got lots of compliments!  I rolled it in fresh crumbled bacon instead of pecans as other reviewers suggested.  My only qualm was that it was a little stiff, which made it roll into a ball easily, but it was a little difficult to scoop with a cracker.

Delicious and so easy!  I added a little bit of Bacon Salt (surprisingly vegan) to give the bacon flavor but still leaving the work vegetarians able to eat the dish. I used sharp cheddar in the ball but rolled it in mild cheddar.  I shaped it into a pumpkin as it was for a Halloween potluck and used a green pepper stem to give it the final touch.

I'm wondering if the people complaining this being to salty used Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix and NOT the dip mix. Big difference between the two. I use my food processor to blend all the ingredients together. Incorporates the shredded cheese better into the cream cheese.

This always goes fast at a party served at room temp.

I made this for a Halloween party this weekend and it was a hit! I threw the cream cheese, ranch mix and 3/4 bag (2 oz.) of sharp cheddar into my Ninja. After it was mixed, I rolled it into a ball on a piece of wax paper and put it in the fridge for 30 min to harden up. Then I rolled it in a mixture of bacon bits and the remainder of the cheese. I added a face using black olives, and a celery stick for the stem. Served it with Ritz crackers. Everyone thought it was clever, and most importantly, tasty! I will definitely use this as my go-to cheese ball recipe in the future!

Rating this as it's written, I'm giving it just 3 stars because it's WAY too salty (and I love salt). Cut the dressing mix amount in half, and this goes up to 4 or even 5 stars, depending on the cheeses selected. I rolled the leftovers into small 'tubes', wrapped individually in plastic wrap, and put them in the freezer for stuffing into chicken breasts. They were FANTASTIC and a great way to avoid waste.

I was invited to a dinner party and was asked to bring an appetizer.  Hmmmm....I'm not a big cook with only a handful of appetizer recipes, mostly ones you serve hot. I needed something easy which would travel well as the party was 30m away.  Although I had never made a cheese ball before, I thought it would fit the bill.  I began searching the Internet and found this one.  I halved it since the party was for less than 10 people.  As per other recommendations in the reviews I read, I toasted the pecans before chopping and made it 24 hours ahead so the favors would be well-blended.  The ranch flavor made this recipe and was NOT too strong making it ahead.  I brought Ritz crackers to serve with the cheese.  Everyone raved about i!  It was gone before dinner.  This is going to be my "go-to" appetizer recipe from now on.

I added bacon and green onion.   I think that as is, it would be a 4 star recipe, with bacon and green onion... 4 1/2 - 5.

It was okay. It was a little strong in smell and taste, and I cut back on the amount of shredded cheese used.
This is a HUGE ball and can EASILY be halved and still be a good size.

This was super easy to make, and next time I'll just be using pecan 'pieces' or at least pieces smaller than what I did use.

I made this for Christmas and shaped it like a snowman. I added some of the white cheddar cheese to the mix but also rolled it in the grated cheese to make it look like snow. I used chocolate chips to make eyes and buttons and mini chocolate chips to make the mouth. I used a piece of candy corn for the nose, but it bled after being put in the refrigerator for a few hours. I forgot the snowman's scarf, which I was going to make out of a carrot using a potato peeler to slice off a long sliver. The hat was a sociable cracker with a Rolo on top.

Oh My Stars! 
I was asked to make a cheese ball for an office pot luck. I had never made (or even really ate one) before so I searched and came up with this recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe called for except cutting down the pecans to 1 cup. I made it a day ahead of time and it was a HUGE hit! Everyone loved it, including me. I will definitely make this again.

first time I made this I didn't have nuts in the house so just made it as a cheese spread & now make this all the time as my daughter and husband love it. I use extra sharp cheddar, & add a dash of worcestershire sauce. blend it well then pack it into small glass bowls with covers. Simple, fast and always well received.  Better the next day but very, very good even when freshly made. great on crackers and as filling for celery.

This recipe made 2 orange-sized balls... rolled one in walnuts, one in "real" bacon bits.  Use your hands to mix this, much easier, and you can roll it in a ball this way as well.  Make sure to leave your cream cheese on the countertop for a few minutes before beginning or else it will be impossible to blend or to shape... has to be soft.  Was skeptical about the ranch dressing packet, sampled the stuff left in the bowl after I was finished and was satisfied with the end result, however, I do think they will be even better after being chilled so the ingredients can simmer in themselves.  Good recipe, my first cheese ball ever made.

Easy & very good describes this well!  Make sure you buy the ranch DRESSING mix... maybe why some reviewers said it was too salty.  Added finely chopped green onions & made 2 balls (one rolled in chopped pecans other in crumbled bacon bits).  Made the day before & turned out great!

I love this recipe.  I  have made it countless times over the years and it is always a hit.  I don't like pecans though so I roll it in some extra cheddar cheese instead.

This was super easy and everyone loved it.  I made it for a Superbowl party and shaped it to look like a football.  I cut some american cheese into strips to form the laces.  The tiny amount that was leftover tasted even better the following day.  Next time I will make it the day before.

I fried my own bacon and crumbled it for bacon bits. I only added half the package for ranch mix and that was more than plenty. I think with the added bacon it made the cheese plenty salty. Also keep in mind that most crackers you'll buy also are salted! My family ate part of the cheese ball immediately (it was great!) and some the next day. A reviewer mentioned they liked it the next day but I can say I liked it the same on both days!!!

It was VERY simple, but tasted like I was on Iron Chef!  This is a five star appeal with just a few ingredients!   I made it and then halfed the recipe (two cheese balls).  I had one for a party, and saved the other for the family!  They loved it!  It's also easy on the budget (wallet)!!  Awesome for a tight income family!

I made this for New Years Eve and it was a huge hit. It's a big cheeseball and it was gone. A few changes: I chopped up 4-5 green onions, added 1/4-1/2 tsp garlic powder, mixed in some bacon bits and then rolled it in bacon bits instead of pecans. I got RAVE reviews. Thanks!!!

My sister made this for Christmas. She skipped the pecans, shaped the "ball" into a tree and rolled it in chopped fresh parsley. Also added a ring of dried cranberries and slivered almonds for tree decorations! So very cute and tasted great!

SUPER salty! I didn't even use the whole pkg. of ranch and it was super over powering. I did add onions and bacon. Next time I won't even use 1/2 a pack of ranch and I'm sure it will be much better. But worth a 2nd try with alterations!

Why have I waited so long to try this recipe?!  It is super easy and sooo good.  The only change I made was to use less pecans, I found that 1.5 cups was too much.  I can't wait to make this again!

So super easy! I've never made a cheese ball, but needed something quick for Christmas appetizer. I rolled it in crumbled bacon and crushed pecans. It turned out WONDERFUL. Everyone loved it. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this for a Christmas party and all my guests loved it!  I bought a small "festive" bowl to place the cheese ball in, so this recipe ended up yielding two small balls instead of one large ball for me!  Yummy!

Very Good! I don't like pecans so I followed the advice of other reviewers and I cooked some bacon and chopped it in the food processor and rolled the cheese ball in it. It was awesome! I got requests for the recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and I will make another for Xmas.  To those who said it was too salty, did you follow the recipe exactly? For some reason I assumed it was made with 1 block of cream cheese, and didnt notice until I started making it that it calls for 2.  This makes a lot, so i tend to make two cheese "logs" instead of one. This time around i am doing what others have suggested, and making one with pecans and another with bacon.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Easy is right, and so good! I made this as the bottom half of a snowman for my Christmas party (a smaller ball with jalapenos for the top) and my guests couldnt stop picking at it. Served with lightly salted pita chips, yum!

This was a big hit at our Thanksgiving party. Very easy to make. I made it a day ahead of time because of the posts that it was better the second day. I will keep this to make often.

This cheese ball is delicious!  I actually got the recipe from my cousin several years ago and loved it.  I made it for my in-law's and now I'm famous in their little town for that cheese ball.  I prefer to make this by shredding my own cheese.  It doesn't really affect the taste, it's just a personal preference.

I LOVE this cheese ball. Who needs anything more involved when this tastes this good? Try to find the low sodium dry ranch mix if you can!

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family was so impressed. They thought it was store bought, it looked so good. I made one with pecans and the other with green onions and bacon, the bacon one went quicker. I also used 3/4 of the ranch dressing based on other reviews. I am having a small Thanksgiving dinner again tomorrow night because my pregnant sister wanted more turkey and had to make the cheese balls again due to popular demand. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Tasty and very easy to make.  Next time I think I might add some chopped green onions to enhance the flavor a little bit more.

I'm not a big cheese person so my opinion didn't really count but my husband LOVED it when I made it last year so I made it again this year. We had guests this year and they loved it, too. I love how easy it is to make and it's gone fairly quickly. I'll be making this every year as hubby requested. :)

I have made a cheese ball similar to this for years. But I also add 1/4 c. chopped onion and 1/2 c. chopped green onion. Adds fabulously to the flavor.

it turned out awesome!  I made two changes though.  I only used 2 cups of cheddar.  After I dumped the 2c bag it looked like plenty so I didn't add more.  The second change was to layer it like a parfait to have nuts with each serving.  It was a hit! (and super easy)

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I changed was putting real chopped bacon, about four slices, into it. I used wheat crackers and pretzel crackers. The wheat was better but they are both good! I would suggest letting this sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before serving since it's really hard when it comes out of the refrigerator. Thanks for the recipe. I will make this again and again.

I was actually going to try a new cheese ball recipe this year, but for some reason, it felt all wrong to me. I am sticking with this recipe!  It's by far the best recipe, and my family looks forward to having this on the table.  I will probably double it and give as gifts this year. I was even thinking about adding some bacon and chives to half of the recipe, just out of curiosity.  Although, why mess with perfection?

This cheeseball is so easy to make and very good.  Every time my husband has a potluck or some kind of celebration at work he asks me to make this cheeseball.  He gets requests for it all the time by his co-workers.  It needs to be refridgerated for at least a few hours prior to serving or it can be a bit salty.  I cover mine in finely shredded cheese rather than nuts because my family does not like nuts.  The cheese works just as well.

Loved it! This was a HUGE hit at both cookouts I took it to. The first time I made individual size balls and the second time I made one giant cheese ball. Both times, there was none left. I minced up some corned beef and onion and added it to mine for a little more substance. HUGE success, I also only use 1/2 package of Ranch dressing mix. Very herby and wonderful!

A good basic cheese ball.. made it  for a grad party and added about a tsp or so of Franks Red Hot Buffalo WIng sauce  ( and left out the pecans since I was not sure how they would blend with the Buffalo Wing flavor..) Did need a bit of extra cheddar since it was a bit 'wetter' to mold. The kids loved it. Awesome!

Exceptional! I followed the recipe exactly - except I used Sharp Cheddar and I only used two cups just because that is the way it was packaged. It would have been great either way! I will make this again. It was my first cheese ball and it was very easy!

I had never made a cheese ball before, so I chose this recipe since it looked like it would be super easy for a novice.  It was a breeze to make, the ingredient list was brief, and best of all it tastes absolutely delicious.  I made it for my daughter's birthday party tomorrow, but I have feeling that after tasting just a little of it while I was making it, that my husand is going to request that I make another one that we can eat tonight.  Yes, it's THAT good!  The only thing was that I ended up needing less pecans than the recipe called for ... perhaps because I used pecan chips which were in smaller pieces.  Great recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing it, it's a keeper!

So easy and taste great. I made it for my family Halloween party, and I made one change. Instead of any nuts, I shaped it into pumpkin (chill overnight) and covered it with crushed gold fish crackers. A thin slice of a green pepper to top it and it was perfect. I had to make two more by request the following week. The ranch was perfect, not too much at all.

I realized too late that I mixed the wrong proportions of ingredients, and it came out a little dry and crumbly, but it was still super good! I doubled the recipe and used only 2 blocks of cream cheese, 3 cups of sharp cheddar, 2 cups of pepper jack, 1 package of Hidden Valley Fiesta Dip Ranch Mix, and added some thinly sliced green onion. It was rolled in chopped pecans, of course. The cheese ball was huge! Had to make two, otherwise it would've been a basketball. It smelled like a cool ranch Dorito, but it tasted less processed.

I  also added a little bit of garlic powder and dried onion flakes.  This is a very good recipe. To give it alittle zing, I also tried just a tad of tabisco sauce and was also good especially with a beer.

I made this cheese ball for Superbowl Sunday. It was not creamy at all. The shredded cheese made it hard to spread and it didnt have alot of flavor.  My family didnt like it at all.

Thank you for this easy and timeless recipe. Such a simple yet tasty base and so easily adapted to personal tastes/ ingredients on hand. I like adding a few drops of hot sauce, some chives and roasting the nuts. I imagine bacon would be fabulous... where is bacon not fabulous???  But haven't trend into that indulgence yet!  ;-)  sigh.. like cream cheese and nuts are not in the same arena!  Thanks again!

I made this cheese ball to try and I took it to school.  It was a hit; everyone loved it.  I used 2 cups of shredded cheese and rolled it in real bacon bits.  It is a great recipe for a easy cheese ball.

delicious! great basic cheeseball - i loved it! i served with Ritz Toppers Garlic and Herb flavor (as a mistake) - and it turned out to be a great combo

(big portion - could just as easily half the recipe and still get a good sized portion)

I thought the original recipe was a too cream cheesy so I doubled the cheddar cheese, added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  Toast the pecans before you chop them, it gives it more depth.  I made 2 cheese balls from this.  Definitely better the next day

At first I didn't think much of it.  I ate a slice the night I made it and stuck it in the fridge thinking it was just average.  But then all the next day I couldn't stop thinking about it when I was at work, and couldn't wait to eat it when I got home.  GOOD RECIPE!

I made this for a work potluck-- I had serveral people ask me for the recipe!  I was shocked because it's so easy!  I used light cream cheese, sharp cheddar cheese, added real bacon bits, and used slivered almonds instead of the pecans.  It looked pretty and tasted great!  I too left it in the fridge over night to set.

This recipe is wonderful! If you are looking for an EASY and DELICIOUS cheese ball to make, look no further! This was great! Family and friends ate this one up and asked for more. The recipe made up 2 cheese balls, which I wrapped up and put in the fridge and served the next day. By then the balls had hardened a bit and the flavors had sunk in nicely. This is a simple, delicious recipe that I have shared with friends and family. Just writing about it makes me want to make some up... it's that good! Enjoy

I made two balls with this recipe: one with chopped walnuts and the other with bacon pieces rather than the pecans.  I also made my own ranch dressing mix.  This is a very yummy appetizer and perfect to have in the fridge for unexpected guests!

This is an easy and delicious cheeseball.  I followed the directions to a T and it was perfect. I allowed it too set for 24 hrs in fridge before serving and it was great! Next time, I think I will try the ole bacon and see what happens. Bacon makes the world go round! ha

It is a decent recipe for a cheese ball. Probably the best on this website. I would be sure to use a Sharp Cheddar cheese. Served with Triscuts and Club crackers.

Delicious cheese balls, but only if you love cream cheese.  Make sure that the balls are small so it won't be too cheesy. They are epecially good the next day!

Very easy and very good.  It makes 2 cheese balls so I made one for now and froze one for later.  I got great reviews from everyone.  The ranch adds great flavor to any recipie including this one.  It was a pleasant surprise.

This made two large cheese balls and they had a really nice sharp flavor. I used extra sharp cheddar in mine. This was really easy and very tasty too. I didn't have enough pecans for both, so I rolled the second one in tosted slivered almonds instead. These were a huge hit here and all my guests loved them. I made these a couple of days ahead so the flavors would have time to blend. This would be a great filling to pipe into celery sticks. Thanks Danielle for the great recipe!

So easy to make. I let the cream cheese sit out to warm up for easy mixing. Then I actually lined a glass pitcher/mixing bowl with plastic wrap and dumped the mixture into this; then closed the wrap around it to help form the ball (sometime I would refrigerate for an hour to firm up), this made it easier to handle when rolling in nuts.  I used walnuts one time and pecans another.  EVERYONE AT MULTIPLE PARTIES RAVED AND WANTED THE RECIPE.

This is a great recipe because you can adjust many things and it is still tasty. I forgot the dressing mix and didn't want to go back to the store, so I chopped some herbs (rosemary, thyme & sage) and mixed the them with the nuts and rolled the cheese ball in that. It was a big hit!

Good hearty cheeseball.  Actually- this recipe made 3 bigger than baseball size cheeseballs.  I almost doubled the recipe until I realized this.  Used Sharp Chedder cheese, which allowed me to used 1/3 less fat cream cheese- still very rich.

I've made this on many occasions.  It's great and easy, easy, easy.  It does taste much better, after it's "marinated" overnight.  I've also rolled the ball in ground black and red pepper, for a little kick.  Just another variation.  Try it!

First I have to say that I am not a huge fan of cheese balls or logs but I hosted Thanksgiving last year and I needed something besides sliced cheeses so I tried this but instead of using nuts on the outside I rolled the ball in sliced green onions.

EVERYONE raved on this cheese ball!!!!  I couldn't stop eating it either.

Hands down the easiest, tastiest cheese ball I have ever had

So quick, so easy and so delicious! Everyone devoured this cheeseball. If you need a spur-of-the-moment appetizer, this is it.

I made two cheese balls out of this recipe for my daughters birthday party.  I rolled one in nuts and the other in chives. I added some garlic and minced onion also.  They looked really good and tasted okay but I found the cheese a little tough to spread.  Maybe I did something wrong.  They didn't earn many rants and raves from the guests either. They were barely touched.

Wow!  I am shocked at the 5 stars for this.  I followed this recipe exactly and it was terrible.  It tasted very artificial.   I think it is because of the ranch mix.   I used good seasons.

This was a hit at our Christmas Eve family gathering!  Super easy to make, and very tasty!  Because we had a lot of kids, I opted to skip the nuts, and roll the ball in more grated cheddar cheese.

This was really good and I got quite a few compliments on it. I did not use the pecans in the recipe. I was going to put bacon bits in to see how that was, but had some vegetarians coming, so I decided not to. I did also add a bit of garlic and onion powder for some extra pizazz, and that was really good. Also, this makes a HUGE cheeseball! You could easily half the recipe and still have a decent-sized cheese ball. All in all, a super easy appetizer to make and I would most likely make it again.

Just ok...it let in set over night but it was still just ok.  I took it to a neighborhood party, most people just nibbled at it and most was left at the end of the night.  I will keep looking for another cheese ball recipe.

This is a wonderfully easy recipe.  I halved the recipe and found that it was MORE than enough - it was twice as large as the cheese balls you buy in the market.

This is a great cheese ball. My husband took one to work and they loved it.  I thought it was a little salty. I will try using a little less ranch dressing mix next time.  I did add some hot sauce and worcesterhire sauce as some one else had suggested.  I will definitly make this cheese ball again.

I made this cheese ball for the football game tonight and it was a huge hit.   Even though it makes a big ball, I only had about a 1/3 left over.  The men went crazy for it and so did I.   I used a little less than 2 cups of the shredded cheese and it was plenty.  I will definately make it again, it is now in my recipe box for future gatherings!

I made this for Christmas, and couldn't believe how easy and good it was.  All the men were fighting over it.  My dad said he wanted one for his birthday.
=-)
The only change I made was to use about 3/4 pkg of ranch instead of the whole thing. I was worried it would be overpowering. Mine turned out perfect. Thank you!

I would say that this recipe was all right.  Not great,  but people certainly weren't fighting over it at our Christmas party.  I don't think the ingredients need to be changed because it delivers what it promises, an easy ranch-flavored cheese ball, but we just weren't crazy about it.  Also, this makes a HUGE ball.  If you're having a relatively small gathering and plan on having other appetizers, then I would recommend cutting the recipe in half, which would make a cheese ball about the size of a ready-made one at the store.  Next year, I will probably make a different one.  Thank you!

For the most part this was a delicious cheeseball , I ended up adding some hormel bacon to it but only a little bit . I think next time I will cut down on the ranch dip mix only because I thought it was a bit salty ( before I put in bacon) . but it was still good.

Yum!  I made this for my guests at our Thanksgiving party and it got rave reviews.  I also divided it into two cheeseballs, as others have suggested, and they were the perfect size.  And that way we had one left over to enjoy after the party!  I Will definitely be making this again.

This recipe should be renamed "Easy MSG and Cheese Ball" because that's basically what it is. I didn't have a lot of time to prepare appetizers at my last party so I used this as a last resort. After mixing, I cut in half to make two normal-sized balls and served with Wheat Thins and red grapes. Note: Don't make one BIG ball as the recipe sugguests or you'll probably get some strange looks.

I had never made a cheese ball before and this one was a winner.  My company loved it.  I followed the advice of others and added some bacon bits.  Next time I might try adding a little green onion as well.  Even my kids liked it.

This was such a great appetizer. So easy to make and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding 3 cups of cheddar cheese, and I made 2 good size cheese balls. Definitely a keeper.

I made this for my family for Christmas. It was a hit! I used fiesta ranch dip mix to add some zip. Thanks for sharing this easy recipe. It makes enough to make into 2 balls.(so you can keep one for yourself!)

This was good but I think it could have been more flavorful. I did add a couple of splashes of Worcestershire sauce as some of the reviews suggested but maybe next time add a bit more-or even more Ranch mix. I divided it into 2 cheese balls and froze one for another use. I also mixed with a hand beater because I wasn’t getting anywhere trying to blend everything by hand. I also toasted the pecans first.

Easy & Crowd Pleaser!
Based on other reviews I used premade ranch salad dressing and made it a day ahead.  I also used crumbled bacon instead of pecans.  Wow!!

I added 3 pieces of crumbled bacon as another reviewer suggested and made it a day ahead.  Taste was fabulous!  Also, since this was made for a woodland themed baby shower, the cheeseball was made into the shape of a hedgehog and decorated with sliced almonds and peppercorns for the eyes and nose.

Excellent, however I did substitute onion and garlic powder since I didn't have ranch dressing mix. Was delicious and not too salty since the powders did not have salt.

I made this according to the recipe. It makes a HUGE ball. It is so easy to prepare a day or two ahead. I will make this again, but I might cut the ingredients in half, depending on the crowd.

This is a salt bomb. No way can you eat anything salty with it or even put bacon in it. I only used 1/2 of the ranch dip with 2 blocks of cream cheese, and 1 cup of cheddar.. I am going to serve it with raw veggies to try and salvage it. Yuk

This tasted good, and was easy to make - but was way too stiff even after sitting out at the party.  I agree with other reviews that you don't need the entire package of ranch, it is very salty.  I used half to 3/4 of it, and made it the night before so flavors could meld. Make sure to use sturdy crackers!

I made this with Hidden Valley ranch mix and substituted bacon bits for the nuts. It was easy to make and a hit at the party. It really makes a lot though, I will cut it in half next time.

Quick, easy and delicious!  Made this for Christmas Eve and it was a showstopper!  The ranch adds a tangy flavor that doesn’t overwhelm the cheese.  I used freshly grated sharp cheddar and it was delicious!

Super easy + many compliments  = a great recipe. 
Made as listed but added 1 extra C cream cheese to tone down the saltiness of the ranch dressing. Added a handful of chopped green onion.  I mixed everything by hand didn't even need the mixer. This yielded three cheese balls. Took one to two different parties and froze one. Served it with pretzel crisps and sliced apples.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

Turned out great made two one with real bacon bits and one with budding ham chopped. The one with bacon I added a tablespoon of bacon grease added to the favor

As others have said,  it is very salty.  And yes, it did sit overnight in the fridge.  Unfortunately, ended up throwing most of it out.

This was a really good cheese ball and my guests all enjoyed it immensely.  The only thing I omitted was the nuts, as I was making this into an igloo to use with the olive penguins.  I "iced" the igloo with leftover whipped cream cheese used in the penguins.

I tried this recipe for the first time earlier this month. I served it at a party and it was a hit. It was easy to make too, so I made it for another party a few days later and hit the jack pot once again! A couple of weeks later, I made it for Christmas Eve and have now decided that this is my new "go-to" party contribution. The ingredients are few and inexpensive and the prep is easy! This cheese ball pairs well with Triscuit Thin Crisps. I highly recommend this recipe!

This recipe is so simple and the cheese ball has excellent flavor. I made this for a company potluck.  Everyone loved it!! The only thing I did different was roll the cheese ball over sliced almonds instead of pecans. Will definitely be making this again.

I make this all the time. I never have left overs and everyone loves it. Even the people who say they don't like cheese balls. The only change I make is, I use Colby Jack instead of Cheddar. I have had people request I bring it to their events.  Super simple and absolutely delicious!

I used the Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix and it was just too strong. I've had much better tasting cheese balls. Gave it two stars because it was quick and easy.

Yes I would make it again but I would use Gourmet DipKits Cheezy Bleu Cheeze Spices instead of the Ranch stuff which is way too salty. Gourmet DipKits can be ordered from www.GourmetDipKits.com.

Love, love, love this cheese ball.  I make it every year during the holidays for my neighbors a nice change from sweets. We do like it best rolled in bacon and I add a few dashes of Worcestershire and sometimes some chili flakes for the neighbors that can take a little heat

I made this last night for our work Christmas snack day! It was delicious and a huge hit by all. I did cut back on the amount of Ranch Dressing mix, I added about 3/4 of the packet. And instead of rolling the ball in pecans I used real bits of bacon. I'll definitely make this again!!

This received a high five at my Christmas gathering with friends. Made a few minor additions/changes: only used half of the 1 oz. ranch packet, added 3 tblsps of goat cheese, added 2 tblsps of honey (of offset the strong salty favors). I will definitely make this again!

This is wonderfully flavorful and easy to make.  I mixed a few different cheeses that I had on hand but mostly sharp cheddar.  Had to give recipe to friends.

Well this recipe started out with me not softening the cream cheese, but that's ok i read the directions about how to soften in the microwave.  What I noticed that I should have definitely done was mix the cream cheese till it got to a whipped texture and then add the ranch dressing , I just dumped the package on top of the cream cheese and then started stirring and it did not mix well.  Then I noticed that i should shredded my own cheese and not used the pre shredded kind it does not mix well.

Everyone loved it! I didn't have ranch mix so instead I added about a teaspoon dried chives, teaspoon dried parsley, 3/4 t. onion powder, ground black pepper and a dash of cayenne and some chopped green onion. Used Kraft triple cheddar shredded cheese. Rolled in both roasted pecan bits and cripsy bacon. Made two cheeseballs. Each feeds 8-10 for an appetizer.

This lived up to its name.  Easy and cheesy.  I actually substituted flavored whipped cream cheese for the regular cream cheese and dressing mix.  It was super easy to put together that way, and I don't have to worry about the flavors being distributed evenly.

Such an easy thing to make and you can change it up with what you have. I've cut up ham or turkey before and added that into it, and used several different types of nuts on the outside. I prefer crushed peanuts than the pecans.

The boy helped me make this for a potluck at work and I happen to work at the high school he attends.  He was a big fan of our test samples and managed to stop by a couple of times during passing period and at lunch to "sample" some more.  This was a big hit with my co-workers, some of them stating it was the best cheeseball they'd ever had...I certainly didn't come home with any leftovers!  I followed the super-easy recipe as written and I am looking forward to making this for my family at our Christmas Eve party.  Delish!!

I used the lower fat cream cheese and rolled it in turkey and regular baron I had chopped, fried and drained really well. We have family with nut allergies. Everyone raved and couldn't believe how simple it was. Makes a lot.

Made this into mini-cheeseballs using pretzel sticks stuck in them to eat individually.  Used both bacon pieces and nuts.  Guests loved them both equally.  This recipe is a keeper!!

Just a little bit too salty with the whole package of ranch seasoning- next time I will try just a half pack of seasoning or another block of cream cheese. Over all good and easy though.

This is easy to make. I used chili powder instead of ranch and smoked cheddar (I smoked myself). Covered with crushed honey roasted nuts.

In my experience in working with Ranch packets before- I've found them overpowering/salty.  Therefore- I decided to use ½ the packet for this recipe.  I ended up having to add an extra block of cream cheese because it was still too salty- for my taste.  I prepared this the night before for a co-worker’s baby shower, and it’s true- the flavors completely combine and it’s a really good combination of flavors.  This recipe was a hit at the party, and everyone gave me good feedback.

Great recipe as is! I've made it several times and it's always good. Definitely let it sit overnight. I make my own dry ranch dressing mix to cut out MSG and decrease salt.  I added about 1/4 tsp of smoked paprika and some cayenne pepper and it tasted just like my favorite Hickory Farms cheese ball. For Christmas, I made it for my gluten-free, MSG allergic sister and the rest of my family ate hers up. I ended up making everyone their own personal cheese ball.

I made this recipe using the handy dandy recipe multiplier (for a church function) and it was a huge hit!  I used "hint of salt" Ritz crackers.  I just had someone call me for the recipe.  lol  Based on one of the reviews, I did make it the day before and was glad I did.  I could see where the taste would be stronger if eaten the same day (I tried it while I was making it).  That is also why I decided to use the lower salt crackers (based on a review), but Ritz crackers are too flaky.  You need a more substantial surface to spread or dip into the cheese.  But this is just excellent!  The next time I make it, however, I may add an extra 4 oz. of cream cheese.  Has anyone ever frozen it?  I had enough to make a small cheese ball and wondered if it could be frozen.

I love cheese balls but this one just didnt' do it for me.  I made it one evening and refrigerated it over night.  It never really softened up and it seemed a bit dry.  A little texture may have helped like some choppped onions or water chestnuts.

Great tang added with the ranch. If you want a little more crunch on the inside finely dice some red and yellow peppers. It gives it a great flavor as well.

A big disappointment. It tasted just like its ingredients: ranch, cheddar, cream cheese. Big whoop. No one had more than one bite, and half of it was leftover.

So easy and delicious.  I've made this several times and found it's best made the day before you want it - the flavours have more time to infuse.  I coat mine in slivvered almonds.

Made this recently for a baby shower. Very easy! I used a 3rd (8oz) pkg of cream cheese to "frost" cheese ball pink (did not use nuts at all). Shaped it to look like a square gift box, tinted it pink & put white polka dots (Wilton, pearls) all over and white bow (not able to be eaten). It looked really cute, almost cake-like. Very easy, and good tasting! Have tried several ones, but this is easy and tasty!

We were hosting a baseball party at our house and I needed to come up with a quick and easy appetizer.  This was amazing and everyone said that they could not get enough of it!  I used bacon bits as well - amazing how something so simple turned out to be the hit of the night!!!

So easy to make and tastes fantastic! I didn't use pecans because I don't like them but it still came out great. I made it into the shape of a football for the Superbowl! :)

I have made this 4 or 5 times now for holidays and get togethers. It is incredibly simple to make and everyone loves it. When I say everyone, I mean everyone - from the picky/cranky dad of a friend to my husband who doesn't eat cream cheese.  I'm guessing I'll be making this recipe several times a year for the rest of my life.

This is the first cheese ball I have made, and it was defiantly quick, easy, and tasty. Much better than the ones I had purchased in the grocery store deli.

I made this cheese ball for New Year's Eve.  It was a tremendous hit.  Took another one out of freezer and have that one for about a week now.   Still tastes yummy.  It lasts quite a long time in refrigerator.  I will certainly make this again.

This is a great recipe for a cheese ball.  The ranch dressing made it taste a bit too salty for my taste, but everyone else loved it.  Thank you for sharing a great recipe.  I may halve the ranch dressing mix next time, but will be making this again!

YUM! So easy!! Very tasty with the ranch packet. I accidentally bought walnuts instead of pecans, so I used those and it was very good. I think any nuts would work. I might leave it out more ahead of time next time, cause it is pretty hard when it's cold. Wonderfully easy, and addicting!! :)

Quick & easy appetizer to make for company. I cut this recipe in half, but I think next time I will do the full recipe, divide into 2 balls & freeze one portion.

I mix 1/2 cup of the pecans into the cream cheese mixture and roll the ball in the remaining 1 cup of pecans....then you get a taste of pecans in every bite..yum!

This was an easy recipe and a big hit at the Christmas party we went to.  I made it into two balls and rolled one in chopped pecans and the other in real bacon bits.  They were both really good.  I think next time I might try mixing the bacon bits into the cheese ball and rolling it in the pecans to get the best of both worlds!  And it does taste better the next day as suggested by many people.  This is something I'll make again.

This was pretty good.  I HIGHLY recommend to make this and let it sit overnight.  When I first made it and tasted it was like a ball of salt.  It sat for about 48 hrs and tasted much better when I served it.  I did use colby jack because that is what I had on hand. I would use less ranch packet next time.  But over all an easy appetizer.

Recipe as is would have been WAY to much ranch for our taste.  I was going to half the recipe so I started with 1 block of cream cheese, half a pack of ranc dressing and the cheddar.  The ranch was overpowering for me and dh.  I ended up adding another block of cream cheese and real bacon bits and it turned out great

Best cheese ball I've ever made. The flavor is wonderful and I did take the advise of several other reviewers and made it the day before.  If I did change anything at all it would be to use only two cups of sharp cheddar instead of two and a half cups.

I really liked this cheese Ball.  This was my first attempt at making one and I thought it turned out well.  I doubled this recipe and made two.  Instead of pecans, I used slivered almonds for one and whole almonds for the other.  I shaped them in the shape of a pine cone and arranged the almonds to look like a pine cone.  I saw a pic of this somewhere and thought I would try it.  I love ranch dressing and ranch flavored anything, so needless to say, I loved the flavor!

This is a good recipe for an audience that doesn't like unusual flavors.  Kids are sure to love ranch, cheddar, and bacon bits.  The recipe was too salty for my taste, even though I added only 3/4 packet of ranch dressing mix.  I had candied walnuts from another recipe which accompanied well.  It got good reviews from the gathering I brought it to.

Better than 5 Stars!  My husband does not eat cheese balls.....TILL NOW.  I left this at my mom's after Thanksgiving and he had me call my sister so she could drop it by our house!  HE LOVED IT.  The only thing I did different was to add REAL bacon pieces to the toasted pecans and then rolled it in that mixture.  The bacon gave it such a wonderful flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe! Next time I'll set it out about 45 minutes - 1 hour before company arrives, to make sure it softens a bit before serving.

I've made this quite a few times over the past two years, my brother has made me promise I'll make it for him every Christmas he loved it so much! I changed it up a little the last time I made it, I used Hidden Valley Ranch Fiesta Ranch mix instead of the regular ranch.  It made is so zippy!  Also, I put about half the amount of cheddar cheese in mine, and I use cheddar jack instead of just plain cheddar. Always a big hit!!!

I made this for my daughter's birthday party and people seemed to like it. We ate the leftovers ourselves. Yum yum. Also nice if accidentally microwaved until warm and squishy. :) I love how easy it was to make. I disagree with the reviewer who says it should be made with bacon bits, not pecans. I'm vegetarian and I love pecans, whereas bacon sounds disgusting to me. Everyone has different tastes. I do agree that it is too salty, even after it has sat for a day or two. If I make it again I would definitely put less of the dressing mix. Thanks!

I made this for a teacher function and it was a bit salty. Next time I won't put in so much ranch mix. Maybe 3/4.

This is a super easy cheese ball and very tasty, but I too found it a little too salty for my taste even after being refrigerated overnight. I will definitely make it again and just decrease the ranch dressing mix.

As you can imagine, this makes a LOT of cheese ball. It was very tasty, but be sure to make it in advance. Take it out 30-60 minutes before you eat it, otherwise it's a cheese rock. Made my cheese ball, ranch-loving brother very happy for his birthday dinner!

I was excited about this recipe since there were so many great reviews and comments!  However, I thought this cheese ball just had an overpowering ranch taste.  I took it to a BBQ and let's just say the majority of it came back with me! :(

I've never made this before but decided to add the bacon as others have suggested. I also only made one ball and added a little mayo and Worcestershire sauce. I put in the whole packet of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing.  It only had 6 hrs before the party but it tasted great.

This cheeseball has been a hit at many parties since I discovered it last December. I get requests for it whenever we go to friends' houses for potluck. The recipe has a large yield and I usually shape a big cheeseball for the party and a little one for us to enjoy the next day at home, since there are never leftovers!

Very easy. If you need something to take to a gathering, this is it. Just a normal dip, nothing spectacular. I left off the nuts, just because i don't care for nuts.

OH my WORD- this cheese ball was a big hit with dear hubby! ;) I did take everyone's advice and added bacon, but my man doesn't care for bacon so he would have rather had it without. Maybe next time I'll try grated cheese, green pepppers, and onions to roll in it. This recipe definitely tastes better once it is set, so I would recommend making it the night before. I also added some sour cream to give it a better texture, not too much...just enough for it to stick together- it was a bit crumbly! I also added diced onion, which gave it a little oomph! We don't like nuts, but I'm sure it tastes good for people who do! This truly is the best cheese ball!

Yummy! Make sure it is chilled overnight to mix the flavors. Made this cheese ball for Fat Tuesday party at work.  Everyone asked for the recipe and were shocked at how easy and few ingredients there were.  Great easy recipe!

A HIT with our friends who came over.  It was gone!  I had on hand a southwest Ranch packet, so I used that and threw in a handful of bacon with it. I also only had almonds on hand, so I chopped them up and used them.  It was sooooo yummy!  Next time I will try the recipe as it, but it is very versatile and I like that!  Thanks!

excellent i didn't have any pecans so i used walnuts.  i didn't have any cheddar so i used colby jack and added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper.  i take it the people who called it salty didn't wait until it "married" together or didn't add nuts.  i wasn't sure at 1st about the nuts until i tried a little.  oh yea and i added 1 tsp dill weed ( i love dill)  if you forget to have the cream cheese at room temp then zap it in the microwave for 30 sec.

Made this for Xmas. I used a Hidden Valley Ranch Salad Dressing packet. Everyone liked it. I made one change and that was to add real bacon bits as suggested by other reviewers. This makes alot but my hubby managed to eat the rest the next day.

This was excellent!! Just a note, I think this was intended to make two or three smaller cheese balls--I didn't realize that and made one huge one. Still excellent, but smaller ones would have a better ratio of cheese stuff to pecan crusting.

This was really good! The ball was huge so next time I will make two balls or cut the recipe in half.  
I used whipped cream cheese and it was great.

This recipe worked out great!  It's so easy.  I did change it up a little though.  Instead of the ranch dressing mix I used Lipton Onion Soup mix.  I just put it through a sifter to sift out the onion flakes.  I also added bacon bits.  I did what others had suggested and let it set in the refrigerator overnight.  The ladies in my office loved it!

Made this for an office potluck. It was gone in about an hour - everyone loved it. It is definitely better if it sits in the fridge overnight (even longer would be better).

Very good recipe!  This makes an impressive looking cheese ball. The ranch was a little on the strong side, so next time I think I will leave a little of the packet unused.  Super good and easy recipe though!  I read a review that you had to use full fat cream cheese because the lowfat was too runny.  Not true!  I used 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese and it was still yummy.  I also used 2% sharp shredded cheese.  You may need to heat up the cream cheese a little so it is workable.  I left it out at toom temperature for an hour and it was still hard to mash.

This was a very good recipe.  The flavor was great. I made it the night before.  My only complaint was that it was a little hard even after It sat out for a while. Next time I may try adding a little laughing cow cheese or sour cream to try and soften it up a little.

I like this cheese ball a lot.  I roll it in crushed cracker crumbs instead of the nuts.  It's definitely better the longer it sits.  If you have time, make it the night before you serve it.

Made this for a holiday party and it was a hit however I made it the night before and kept it in the fridge over night. It needed a little time to "thaw" so that people could get their crackers and chips into it. All and all great recipe!

This turned out good.  People who don't normally enjoy cheese balls did enjoy this one.  I made it the night before the event and i think that helped the flavors sit.

This is super easy and super tastey!  My fave cheese ball!  I made these for some friends one night and people stood over the table inhaling it.  I left the bacon out of one of them for my vegetarian friend and it was just as delicious as the one with bacon.  I had pals asking me if I had put all these particular spices in it and I was like, "Nope, just ranch dressing mix."  They were shocked.

This is a pretty good recipe, but I used parmesan cheese mixed with cheddar, and it was a bit potent.  Definately only use cheddar cheese.

I loved this recipe. I made in for Christmas. It is a large recipe, so I made it into 4 cheeseballs and froze until needed. It freezes well. The only change I made was substituting the grated cheddar cheese with a container of Imperial sharp cheese. I found the cheeseball to be very addictive. I didn't find it at all salty like some of the other reviews. I served with a variety of crackers, but my favourite were Christies Topables. They are very light and crispy and don't have any discernable flavour so they don't compete with any topping. This recipe will become an appetizer standby.

This recipe was just okay.  It didn't seem like anything special but maybe I was expecting too much from all the rave reviews.  It was easy to make and easy to transport so it had that going for it. The taste was fine, just nothing that anyone raved about.

I made this for my family at Christmas and they loved it! Very easy and fast to make. I have a small family so I halved the recipe and used one 8oz. package of cream cheese, 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and a half packet of ranch dressing. I also rolled it in real bacon bits instead of peacans. Fantastic. It's best to leave it overnight in the refrigerator before serving. That way the flavors blend and mellow.

You know, I wanted to love this, I really did.  And it wasn't bad, but I felt like I had to tweak it enough that I'm inclined to try a different recipe next time.  I used roughly half of the ranch dressing mix, and thought that was plenty - any more would have made it too salty.  (And yes, it was dressing mix, and not dip mix.)  It still needed a kick, though, and since I didn't have any worcestershire, I added some cayenne and some chili sauce.  The cheese ball firmed up really nicely, and looked great after I rolled it in pistachios, but - I don't know.  Maybe cheese balls just aren't as good as I remember them being.  Thanks anyway, though!

Super easy to make. I reduced the ranch dressing to a half packet. I prefer a milder flavor. Even my very picky eaters loved this cheese ball. Will use again and again.

Easy and pleasing. I did find that the taste of the cheese ball was better the second day for some reason - I am thinking because the ranch mix had time to flavor the cheese nicely and didn't taste gritty. The recipe was huge so I made two balls, rolling one in slivered almonds and one in chopped green onions. Yum!

I made this for Christmas. Everyone loved it. Make sure to let it sit overnight or it will taste to salty. Also make sure to use a ranch dressing mix, not a dip mix...I also added garlic, even better!

I love this recipe. I've made it for the last 4 Christmases and it is always a big hit. It is very simple to make, yet is full of flavor. If you are looking for an easy but flavorful cheeseball, this recipe is for you!

I made this to serve at my son's 8th birthday party and although the kids did not touch it the adults raved about it.  This recipe made three baseball size cheeseballs which I served with assorted crackers and toast rounds.  Fabulous, will definately make again.

I tried this cheese ball recipe for Thanksgiving, I did add a little milk and butter to it as it was very hard to mix together, needles to say it was not a hit, and due to all the leftovers this incredibly large recipe calls for my husband and I were stuck with the leftovers that were incredibly bland an BORING!  I will stick to my Better Homes and Gardens recipie that has always been a huge hit!

Simple, tasty and easy to make.  I halved the recipe (since I have a jar of bulk ranch mix).  Like I said, easy to make and very tasty after sitting for a bit.

So these were really tasty, but I didn't get the rave reviews like I was hoping. Nobody said anything about them. But I thought they were tasty. I made them for a party, but instead of making one big cheese ball, I rolled them into quarter size balls, so they were like these individual cheese balls. Thinking it was kind of creative. I stuck a toothpick in them and arranged the crackers all fancy. Some people took them but most people weren't sure what they were. So I think that making individual cheese balls is a bad idea. So I had a ton left over and have been snacking on them throughout the day the last couple of days. Oh, and I did make them the day before, because of the previous reviews saying it was kind of salty. And so I guess it helped because they didn't seem too salty to me. So don't make individual cheese balls, people won't know what they are so they probably won't eat them.

This recipe is great i've made it 3 times.  I divide it up to make 2 cheese ball.  I add worshister sauce in both and only 1 2 cup pkg of cheese. I also put a can of chipped beef in one and hot sauce in the other.  They always go fast and I get asked for the recipes. Great keeper.

With a nut allergy in the house, we rolled the ball in crushed pretzles right before serving (to ensure they did not get soggy).  Recipe made two good size balls.  Kept well in frige over night before serving them the next day.  Easy to make, very tasty, will make again.

For a first time cheese ball chef, this was perfect!  The hardest part is stirring the cream cheese.  The flavor was great and it was a hit at the Bunko party I served it at.  It does make a rather large ball though.  Might half it next time.

Just made this for our Thanksgiving get-together tomorrow.  Took all of about 10 minutes to put the ingredients together, mix, shape, and viola'!   Had a taste test and it is truly delicious.  I bet it will be even better tomorrow after the flavors get a chance to intermingle.  Excellent recipe and extremely easy!

This is SO easy and just as good as others I have made that use more ingredients and take more time!

This truly is an easy cheese ball and quite tasty to boot!  Easily makes two good-sized cheese balls.

This is really good, but I cut down on the ranch dressing mix.

Great recipe…everyone LOVED this cheese ball. I reduced the amount of ranch dressing as recommended and it tasted wonderful. Was REALLY easy to make too.

I substituted low-fat cream cheese.  Rolled the ball in sliced almonds.  This is a nice change of pace from plain sliced cheese with crackers.

I made this for a baby shower.  It is good although I have made better cheeseballs.  It is a little plain tasting.
