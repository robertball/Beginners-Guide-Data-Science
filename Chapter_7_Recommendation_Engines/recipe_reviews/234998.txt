These are exactly like my Mom used to buy!  But it was so cool that I could make them myself!

Iâ€™ve made these cookies for my husband for over 30 years. I found this recipe last year and he told me these ones finally taste like he remembers from childhood.

Great recipe...thanks guys! I lost a favorite vintage cookbook.  I tried two other springerle recipes and threw out the dough. This one is the best!
