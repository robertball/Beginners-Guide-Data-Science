I changed a few things. I soaked green lentils and then add turmeric and boiled them. Took only 15 minutes till done and it used all the water.  No draining necessary. I caramelized the onions in two tablespoons olive oil this took about 15 minutes.  The cardamom I didn’t have so I looked up a replacement and found cardamom is half nutmeg and half cinnamon so I did that.  I used jarred garlic and ginger spice (not fresh).  I added this to the cooked onions while they were hot and then scraped all into the lentils.  I let cool and purée in my food processor.    It is good!   Next time I’ll add more onion and garlic.

This is really good. I cut down on the garlic. Boiling lentils with turmeric is pure genius! Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent!  I used red lentils just because they are what I had in the cupboard.  No cilantro, some buillion.  Really yummy healthy dip!
