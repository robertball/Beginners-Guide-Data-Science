I had a recipe for meatloaf that was on a raisin box, very similar to this, several years ago. Because my husband had a distaste for raisins, I put them in the blender with some of the moisture. He loved the meatloaf. He never knew for several years. I feel confident that this recipes will will be equally good and am looking forward to these burgers. I will respond after I make these. Thanks

didn't hold together well enough to grill. But flavor was excellent.  Maybe a few bread crumbs and freezing before grilling would do it

This was a great burger full of flavor and I loved every bite! I used ground sirloin and scaled this down to half a serving (1/4 lb. beef). I cooked it in a skillet and served it on a sandwich thin bread/bun topped with a slice of provolone cheese. It didn't need any condiments or toppings, this was great all by itself. I think garlic mayo would be great with this burger though. The raisins plumped up and weren't chewy at all and worked well in this recipe. Sounds weird, tastes great. I'm glad I tried this. Thanks Chef LaMama.

Juicy, but lacking in flavour. The boys couldn't get past the idea of raisins in a burger so I soaked them in hot water until plump then tossed them in a food processor along with the onion and 3 cloves of garlic. Instead of S&P I used a tsp. each of steak seasoning and Italian seasoning (for this much meat you'd have to use much more, at least 2-3 tsps. of each) and switched the Worcestershire for Dijon mustard. Topped my burger with provolone (as per recommendations) and steak sauce (Kikkoman's, which has an applesauce base that went well with the raisins- Not sure if most other brands would work equally well but thought I'd throw this out there for us folk that like sauce on a burger). This needs a 'crunch' factor, like a traditional burger gets from tomato or pickles. I see alot of potential for this (pickled apple slices, anyone?) and will play around with this in the future. Served this with "Waldorf Salad with Walnut Oil Vinaigrette" from AR.

I made these as sliders for a holiday cookout & everyone really enjoyed them.  I used ground turkey & low-fat Swiss cheese & served them on grilled "pretzel buns." I topped them with a mixture of sauteed onions, mushrooms & Worcestershire sauce...YUM!  I'll definitely be making these again....next time, I might add a few raisins to the sauce...
