One little hint when cooking with curry powder.  Always, always, always COOK your curry powder before adding it as an ingredient.  This releases the flavor of the curry.  Just put a couple of tablespoons of oil in a medium/high pan and cook the curry powder for a couple of minutes.  You'll be surprised at how much more flavor is released!

These are really good - a great idea. Not enough curry for us, so I doubled it. I sent my onions through the food processor to get them super-fine and I think it made for a really moist burger - which was a plus since I used almost half ground turkey which can be dry. We had these on red quinoa rolls that I made with sliced tomato, cucumber and mushrooms. Happy family. :) Thanks for the recipe!

I love garlic so I loved this recipe.  The curry was mild enough that it just complimented the burger.  I placed the buns between whole wheat pita bread and it gave it an even more upscale burger taste.

I also upped the curry a bit and cut the onion and garlic in half.  I made sliders and they were sooo good on little onion rolls with a dollop of mango chutney to bring out the flavor!  Certainly more interesting than a plain burger!! Yum!!

This is basically a falafel using meat instead of chickpeas.  It takes too many adjustments to rate higher.  For added flavor make a classic tsazziki sauce to top it.

This was very good! I served it on a pita with hummus, tomato, and cucumber.

Made them per instructions and these were fantastic. The curry and the garlic work perfectly together. FIL asked that I make them again for a weekend BBQ. Mouth is watering just thinking about them.

Curry flavor was mild, so next time I might add a little more. I used ground lamb instead and it was very tasty!

This was a delicious change from the boring-old onion soup mix burger that you see everywhere. I love the taste of curry so I would add more than 1T next time. This had just a hint of curry, so if that's how you like it, this is for you.

Not bad, but not really astounding.  I prefer to mix  3/4 c. barbeque sauce, hot sauce, onion, and tons of garlic into the meat before patty-making, then baste with more barbeque sauce and top with sharp cheddar when it's on the grill.  Mmmmmmm......

Really great flavors!  I used ground turkey, A1 instead of the steak seasoning, and no evaporated milk and some how went very wrong with this combination.  The burger meat was so runny that I had to transfer to a grilling skillet instead of the grill.  Maybe the ground turkey is just wetter than ground beef.  Still, the flavor was great and a nice change from the norm!

I doubled up the curry powder and garlic, and it was still really mild. We enjoyed these, but it isn't something I'd make again. Thanks anyway!

i enjoyed these.. i think it depends on what kind of steak seasoning one uses.. i used montreal steak seasoning.. left out the egg and evaporated milk.. only put onions in bf's burgers.. very garlic-y.. didn't taste the curry much but i also did not cook it.. either way it was good.. ty for the recipe ~~UPDATE: i made this again and decided to further play around with the ingredients/ingredient amounts.. i subbed the fresh onion with 3/4 tsp onion powder.. i left out the egg and milk again.. i cut the garlic down to 2 cloves and cut the steak seasoning in half.. the curry was finally able to shine.. i am SO satisfied with the final product.. ty again for the recipe

Awesome!  Adjusted amount and type of curry depending on who's eating them!
