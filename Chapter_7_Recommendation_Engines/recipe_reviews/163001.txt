Made it for a party. Some of the comments I heard besides "delicious" were "This is definately a two plater" I did make my own version. After slow cooking 10 pounds for 14 hours, I

I just made this recipe today and it is definitely a "keeper"! My husband even said it is better than his mother's - and he's never said that before! I followed the recipe exactly except that I used a 7 pound pork shoulder (instead of 4 pounds)and the ratio of pork to sauce was perfect. (If I had used only a 4-lb. pork I'm sure it would have been swimming in sauce.) I cooked the shoulder for 6-1/2 hours, then 'pulled' it, then cooked it for another hour and a half. The mango sweetens it a bit and the chipolte chile pepper gives it a nice kick! Absolutely fabulous - thanks for sharing!

OMG!OMG! I have been on a roll- every recipe ive tried has been great lately. Ths was no exception. This looked unusual but delish so I decided to try it. It WAS unusual but in a very good way. I ended up using more BBQ sauce than called for but thats cuz I like em saucy. Actually, I used 2 different BBQ sauces. I used 2 regular bottles of Kraft bbq sauce, and I also used part of a raspberry-chipolte bbq sauce I had in the pantry. WOW. Iam sure it would have been fine without the touch of raspberry, but MAN, it made it so good and slightly sweet. Still spicy though. I cant wait to make this again, I am running out of good things to say about it. Just give it a try, you will not be sorry!!

Oh my oh my, this is without a doubt the best pulled pork I have ever had, bar none!  Anyone that makes this for the first time and tastes the juice before it's pored off, it is super spicy, but IT DOES NOT remain in the meat, just a subtle spicy zing with sweet BQ sauce. I use honey BQ sauce, it's great in this. I serve mine on a Kaiser roll with the classic spears of dill pickle. TO DIE FOR! I'm not much of a drinker and had no bourbon in the house so I went down to my local  liquor store and bought a little airline size bottle of bourbon for a buck fifty and it was just perfect. If you're on the fence with this one, get off! you'll love it, I promise.

This was my first time making pulled pork and this was a nice, easy, and very delicious introduction.  I did listen to other reviewers and made the following changes: I mixed the salt, pepper and chipotle together and then rubbed the mix on the meat. After cooking, I trimmed the fat. I added only half of the sauce to the meat, and then added a bit more it to suit my preference for how saucy the pork should be.  The extra sauce on the side was a nice addition.  One note to those new to making this type of dish: if you can't shred the pork with two forks, it needs to cook more.  When it's done, it should only take a few minutes to break it all up. Happy eating!

This was very good. I had an 8 pound piece of meat so of course I doubled everything. I thought the amount of barbeque sauce was too much so I added a total of 36 ounces instead of the 48 ounces that would be required if the recipe was doubled. The meat was very tender and I am glad I did not add the full amount of barbeque sauce it would have masked the chipotle flavor and mangos. I have never been able to find chipotle chili powder so I pureed about half a can of chipotles in adobo with the mangos. If I made it again I would probably add more mangos and chipotle chilis and less barbeque sauce!

A few comments and questions to answer here:  I prefer chipotle because it adds a smoky flavor I prefer in my pulled pork. When you are using a crock pot instead of a low, slow bbq, you have to catch that flavor somewhere.  I use whatever bbq sauce is on sale--but only fairly plain jane flavors. Using some crazy honey-hickory-papaya sauce is just overkill to me.   Very glad you all like this recipe. I honed it over several years until I was satisfied.

mm mmm mmm  I adapted to what I had on hand but used this as my base! I had a bourbon "marinade" rub on hand and only one mango...but a gob of mango salsa from Costco did the trick for the rest. I also had no honey (what?!) so I used Agave necter.  My BBQ sauce of choice was 16 oz Jack Daniels Honey and I used hot mexican chilli powder and Mrs. Dash's chipoltle seasoning.   This was NOT too hot, but definately flavorful.   I know I totally played outside the lines here, but I think I captured the essence of the sauce.  SO GOOD.  BTW I kept the au Ju from the pork and will make a nice pasole or something! The 5th star was for EASY.  I served this with "roasted" butternut squash and red potatoes that I ALSO did in the crock pot!! GET OUT!! Yes, a crock pot!!  cut 'em, coat 'em in olive oil, your favorite italian seasonings & Kosher salt...heat 'em 4 hrs on high stirring occaisionally til done.

All the liquid had boiled off long before I checked on mine after 7 hours on low.  I also only needed to cook it an additional 30 minutes instead of 1-2 hours after making the sauce.  It still turned out delicious, but next time I will reduce the cooking time in the first step.

The BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's honey chipotle) completely overwhelmed the other flavors. It was good, but I'm not sure it would have tasted any different had we skipped the mango, chipotle powder, etc. and just soaked pork in BBQ sauce.

This was a fantastic recipe, easy to make and lasts a looooong time. (Maybe that's because it's only my boyfriend and I) I of course made a few changes to the recipe. I could not find any ripe mangoes on such short notice, so I cheated. I bought a can of mangoes and poured the juice from the can into the slow cooker instead. I also did not measure the water but poured it in after the ingredients till it covered the pork. I estimate that was about an extra cup. Also like many others I just used regular chili powder. Happy cooking and good luck!

This recipe is really good if you leave it sit overnight in the fridge, it seems to mellow out the strong bourbon flavor. I wouldn't have believed  it was the same recipe if I didn't know better! The only change I would make next time is I would use peaches in place of the mangos just because of the high price of mangos and I don't think the flavor was that prominent.  Will make this one again, the family really enjoyed..thank you

Good pulled pork recipe. The mango adds a wonderful flavor. I made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe to the letter and the second time I added brown suger and teriyaki sauce. Both ways are good.

This is AMAZING! So easy, so yummy. I could go on and on about it.  The first time I made this I used pork loin, it came out OK but not anywhere near as good as the second time I made it, using the shoulder/butt cut.  My second time I doubled the recipe and froze the leftovers, they are getting better and better!!  Try this you won't be disappointed.

I've made this recipe three times now, and it's great!  Besides the fact that it's just fun to tell your friends you've made "Bourbon-Mango Pulled Pork" and watch them salivate, it's a very easy recipe that I've haven't been able to mess up yet!  I've made it with pork shoulders from 4 to 5.5 lbs, different brands of BBQ sauce (though my favorite so far is "NOH Hawaiian Bar-B-Q Sauce". Delicious and no HFCS!), I've slow cooked the pork on low from 5-8 hours and did the second half on high from 1-3 hours.  It always turns out delicious.  Last night the mangos I used turned out to be a little out of season (sour) so I added a couple extra Tbls each of honey and brown sugar and it came out great. Thanks for the terrific recipe!

I made this for an office pot luck and it was definitely the hit of the lunch.  The biggest modification I made was substitute the chipotle powder with real chiles.  I used 1/2 of a small can of chipotle chiles in adobo sauce in the crock pot (coursely chopped).  I used the other half when I pureed the mangos for the sauce.  I also doubled the honey and bourbon.

SERIOUSLY. Best Pulled Pork I have ever made...and I have tried many versions. I needed it for Sunday early afternoon so cooked the pork Friday/Friday night and shredded it. Put it in the fridge and on Saturday made the "dressing". Mixed it in, cold, and left it until Sunday am and heated it for the 2 hours. I find, sometimes, that too much "heating" causes it to cake and carmelize so was trying to aviod that. It was unbelievable. I have printed this recipe for 7 people at my party. Nice work! I used Sweet Baby Rays original for my BBQ sauce base.

This was very good! Make sure you like spicy if you're gonna add the full amount of chipotle powder to the sauce. I think next time I'm gonna go w/ 1/2 the amount. I also agree that 2 bottles of bbq sauce is waaaay too much...I used 1 bottle and still had a good bit left. This had great flavor and was a nice change from the usual. I served this w/ cole slaw on top and that was tasty! I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Excellent flavor! I used a 6 lb roast & it was still very saucy. Could not find chipotle chili powder so used reg chili powder & 1 bottle of chipotle bbq + 1 bottle of reg Sweet Baby Rays. We all liked it-I had to stop my son from making a fourth, yes-fourth!, sandwich. The great thing is, it made a ton so I have some in the freezer now for a couple more meals! Thank you!

Excellent. I made for my family and kept all the spiced as written and we all loved it, even though it was a little spicy. I'm planning to make it for a crowd, so will reduce the pepper.

I Loved it! I just used a little sample bottle or bourbon. I didn't taste it at all and I didn't miss it. I recommend this, it's juicy, sweet, and spicy. I used a hearty toasted wheat bun and it stood up well to the rather messy filling.

*edit: I've made this numerous times and the only time it wasn't great was when I slacked on getting the pork into the slow cooker and was forced to cook it on high. It was too dry and not worth the mess and bother. Definitely get your butt in gear and start it early or rethink your dinner menu!

This wasn't bad, but i was a little dissappointed because i couldn't taste the mango/burbon flavor i was hoping for, so i ended up adding my own touches, such as brown sugar, liquid smoke, chili powder, to make it more to my liking.

Delicious! I did decrease the bbq sauce as others mentioned...but I could have used a bit more actually...I love pulled pork with a lot of sauce. A great combo of sweet, smokey and spicy. Thanks for sharing!

Works equally well with country ribs. Incredibly tender and the sauce was perfection. Other than changing the cut of meat all else was the same. Beautiful presentation over couscous with pine nuts and asparagus bundles as a side.

Great pulled pork ~ I followed the recipe exactly other than using vegetable stock in place of the water.  Even my kids loved this recipe, will certainly be making this again...

Too much of many things... Sweet, spicy and saucy that resulted in a dish no one wanted seconds of. The flavour combination seemed spot-on, but it didn't suit our tastes at all. Only slight change was an additional shot of whiskey.

Simple and easy. Do not think the mango pit added anything though. I just pureed some and mixed in for flavor. Delicious!!!

This is crazy delicious.  I used pork loin instead of shoulder and molasses instead of honey.  Other than that no changes.  Even the cooking broth is tasty!  I'm tempted to use it with ramen noodles!  But the finished product, with the mango/barbecue/fine Kentucky bourbon we have, is just amazing.  Thank you RuggerDucky!

This was easy and yummy!  My husband had me send some to his parents he loved it soo much!  Looks like I will be making this again and again.  I didn't use the chipotle chile powder and it was still yummy! This wasn't a messy pulled pork either!

I love this pulled pork. I used old Crow borubon which is cheap and taste great in it. The only things I changed was to the honey to one teaspoon not two. Also the last time it cooks I cooked it at medium since on high it burnt the bottom. Simple changes

Love this recipe! I make mine as is but I substitute pineapple for the mango. I find that mango gets lost in the sauce where as the pineapple balances the smokiness of the dish a little better. I also serve it with a green apple coleslaw! Definitely a family favourite.

I used this recipe as inspiration for the pulled pork I made for a friend's wedding. It was a hit with the 150 guests! I used a rub of paprika, chili powder, thyme, salt and pepper on the pork in the fridge overnight before cooking it. I cooked it in the oven for about 8 hours at very low temp. We pulled the pork the night before the wedding and made the sauce and warmed everything through the morning of. It was worth all the prep work!

As ande2994 pointed out already, this recipe just tastes like whatever BBQ sauce you use.  Anticipating this, I only used half of the BBQ sauce suggested.  I added a third mango, more honey, and more bourbon.  Still, the BBQ sauce is pretty dominant.  Not sure why this recipe warranted a video.  It's just cook pork, dump sauce on it.  All other labor and flavor wasted.

These were awesome! I couldn't find the chipotle powder so I used some in a can.  Just a warning, they pack a lot of heat.  But everyone loved them. Would definitely make again.

I dont know why I bothered to try a different pulled pork recipe.. I usually use the 'bbq pork 2 ways' from this site as a base to work off of, and always get fantastic reviews (from southerners who've had tons of bbq in their lives) This sounded neat with the mango, so I followed to recipe exactly.. and it was TERRIBLE. the mango ended up separating from the rest of the mixture and just looked gross and the taste was just odd to me. The boyfriend still ate some for lunch and insisted he liked it.. but I think he was just being nice..

My husband is not a fan of pork at all and usually I use my pulled "pork" with shredded turkey or chicken but I thought I would give this recipe as is. I followed it to a T and it was delicious! I loved it, my daughter loved it and even *gasp* my husband! Even froze the leftovers for a quick and easy dinner later on! It thawed out great and was just as good the second time around!

Awesome! Very very good. And pretty easy. I mistakenly added the BBQ sauce to the mango mixture immediately but it still worked well. I served with fried okra and cheesey hashbrown casserole.

My family and I love this recipe. After looking for a different kind of pulled pork recipe, this was perfect. I've got many favorites but I got bored. This hit the spot. I did forget the salt, I just noticed, but this is great. Thx for sharing RuggerDucky. Outstanding! If you're a BBQ junky like me, you and your family will just love it.

Good, but not great.  Too sweet for my taste and I like sweet stuff.  I will make this again but will eliminate the honey and reduce the amount of sauce to one bottle while adding more chipotle powder.

Was delicious! My boyfriend loved it and told his whole family how good it was so thank you, I wasnt cooking at home so I bought all the stuff only to find no slow cooker was available to me. i cooked the meat for 6 hours at 275. Turned out so good, just like a slow cooker would have done it to my pleasant surprise! Also had chili powder so i used a smoky bbq sauce to make up for the lack of chipotle.

I made this recipe with fresh peaches, a sweet BBQ rub, and a pork butt roast instead of the mangos, salt/pepper and shoulder roast. I like to use what I have on hand, so I am a consummate substitution cook in the kitchen. This was great. Highly recommend for a casual dinner.

Made this while I was in China and really missing non-Chinese BBQ.  Because of my location, I couldn't find a few of the ingredients.  I used Chinese vinegar in the liquid and tossed in a quartered onion and a head of crushed garlic.  I also added 1/2 cup of bourbon to the cooking liquid along with two cups of chicken broth, instead of water.  Instead of chipotle peppers, I used some tiny Chinese peppers that I found in the veggie market and chopped them up really tiny and added them to the liquid as the pork cooked for a bit of spice.  For the sauce I made a honey bbq sauce and added the mango chunks, bourbon and regular chile powder in a blender, then simmered it for about 10 minutes and added it to the pulled pork, minus the liquid, mango pits and onion.   I didn't leave them together in the slow cooker for 1-2 hours...everything was already cooked.  Just until the sauce is basically absorbed.

wow, this was exceptional-- although I made a few slight changes due to what I had on hand-- to my dismay I only had about 1 t chipolte pepper in the cupboard but had a 1/2 a can in adobo sauce in the fridge.  I added about 1/3 c mango nectar to the cooking liquid as I was using frozen mango from Trader Joes, added a sprinkle of smoked spanish paprika to my 6 1/2 lb pork butt to add to the smokiness  of the chipolte.  I used Sweet Baby Rays Chipolte and honey BBQ sauce and some cheap kraft hickory smoke sauce, I was impressed with the final product.  Did not cook for the 1-2 hours at the end, felt it did not need that-- did bout 45 minutes on low and it was just fine.  All in all used about 18oz BBQ sauce, 24 oz would have been too much, but served extra on the side for those that wanted more sauce.

Wow this was fantastic--even tho I didn't have mangos and subbed peaches. Wish I would have thought of the frozen oh well. Will certainly make again with the mangos. My family raved and raved about it. Delicious.

This is very good. Watch the chipotle if you are using a spicy barbecue sauce (I was). This calls for a LOT of sauce, so unless you like your pork *really* swimming in it, you'll want to cut back to 1 bottle of bbq sauce - which will also jack the mango flavor up quite a bit. I'll definitely make this again with those modifications. Thanks!

Really good!! I make pulled pork in the crock pot a lot but I've always used regular BBQ sauce with it.  The mango really added a good flavor!  The BBQ sauce almost over-powers the mango flavor though (I used Sweet Baby Ray's), next time I'll add less.

This recipe is excellent.  I've got it simmer now, for diner tonite.  I made a few simple changes, just because of what I had on hand.  Firstly, I used regular chili powder, just as others have said.  Also, I don't drink bourbon, so I used tequilla instead.  Seems to have added an interesting flavor of its very own.  Thirdly, I made my own bbq sauce, so I blended up the mango directly in my bbq sauce while it was cooking.  And lastly, instead of pork roast, I used boneless pork ribs.  I see a lot of people saying they're having too much sauce.  My comment to that would be, are you using boneless pork.  The bone DOES carry weight, and means there's less meat to absorb the sauce.  I actually ended up making a little bit extra sauce just because there WAS no bone waste due to my use of boneless ribs.  I am quite pleased with this recipe and will be making it again, many times.  I may even experiment a bit and give it a few personalized changes.  Thanks for such a great addition to my recipe book!

6 stars- This is the absolute best pulled pork you will EVER try. My boyfriend made this and can be described as nothing less that perfect. He couldn't find chipotle powder but he added two serrano chiles instead, and it was not too spice sooooo good. He also added two jiggers of Bourbon which seemed to me the perfect amount, anything  less and you would not get the essence of the bourbon. A MUST TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Wow, what a great recipe. The flavor was amazing. I used honey BBQ sauce and regular BBQ sauce and regular chili powder instead of chipotle and it turned out really well. Everyone asked for seconds! Serving it again tonight with cornbread!

I made this for a family dinner. I don't know what I did wrong, but my pork would not shred. At all. We ended up having sliced pork sandwiches instead of pulled pork. The flavor was ok, but honestly after all that effort, I could have thrown a bucket of Lloyd's bbq in front of them and they would have never known.

I have been making mine and my boyfriend's fave pulled pork recipe from on here for years. I wanted to try something new and different and came upon this recipe. Not only did my boyfriend like this recipe better, I did too. It took a lot longer to prepare but worth every bite. In fact it was so good that I deleted the other recipe... Oh, I added shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese on top of the meat and it was so tasty. Definitely worth a 5 star rating.

I'm certainly no chef, and I've been to some very reputable BBQ joints. This is the best pulled pork I've ever had! Used a 2 lb loin and one big mango. Reduced everything else by half. Cooked on low for 6 hrs. Then 45 min on high in sauce after pulling. Didn't have any balsamic so I used apple cider vinegar.

This is the first time I made this recipe, I made it exactly as the recipe said. My husband, 2 sons, and I loved it.  After 4 hours of cooking, it wasn't tender enough, so I sliced in thin pieces.  Next time, I think I will use a pork tenderloin because it shreds much easier and does not have as much fat as the shoulder does.  Thank you for this recipe, it is a keeper.

Made this for a pot luck and was enjoyed by everyone.  One word of caution, when you pull the pork make it pretty big strings as it will break down further during the final warming phase from the stirring.  If you shred it too small (or just right) it will all turn into mush during that time.  That was the mistake I made the first time with it.  It tasted great but it looked horrible.  Much better the second time.

This recipe has been hangin' out in my recipe box since July 2011 - finally got around to making it.  I did halve the recipe as I only had a small pork loin rather than a shoulder.  I served this on  baked potatoes rather than a bun and it was very well received by my family.  The sauce had a nice sweetness from mango and the honey that paired nicely with the chipotle chile powder.  Because I halved the recipe, I should have used 12 oz. bbq sauce. I didn't, I just poured it in until I got the consistency I was looking for.  This is a great way to fix pulled pork, a recipe that I will be using again.

Absolutely incredible!  Used the bourbon whiskey barbecue sauce from allrecipes.com for the sauce, and it was to die for!  We froze the leftover pulled pork and used it for bourbon mango pulled pork soft tacos (sharp cheddar, pulled pork, shredded red cabbage, avocado slices, cilantro, and dip in cilantro sour cream) and it was by far the best meal of the year!

This was excellent! I used Garland Jack's BBQ Sauce, it has replaced Sweet Baby Rays as my favorite. Depending on the sauce you use the flavors for this dish can widely vary. I loved the sauce so much I have halved the recipe and used it for BBQ chicken, pork chops and anywhere else it can be used.

I used bone -in chicken breast (we don't eat pork)and cooked about 31/2 hours, then added some mushrooms to the pulled meat and homemade apple-bourbon bbq sauce.  Then stuffed the result in red bell peppers and baked.  AWESOME!  Instant hit in our house.  Well worth the time it took to make.

This is a great start recipe and I followed it almost exactly.  The reason for only 3 stars is bottled barbeque sauce is just yuck.  I highly suggest making your own sauce and using that to mix with the mango mixture.  I make my own BBQ sauce (both ketchup and mustard base) and have only tried this with the ketchup base sauce.  I've made this twice so far and the second time I ran low on Balsamic vinegar so used half Balsamic and half White Wine vinegar and it was still really good.  This second time, I also added a bunch of chopped red onion to the pork while cooking which turned out to be a delicious addition as well.

Absolutely fantastic!  A bunch of us made different pulled pork recipes at work for a bbq, and this was the absolute favorite!  I used a travel-size Wild Turkey for the bourbon.  A friend of mine has never like pulled pork and he swears I'm the best cook in the world after tasting this!

I only give it 4 stars because I've had better BBQ... OUT. This the best BBQ I've ever eaten in anybodies home. I fixed it EXACTLY like the recipe called for. Then I put some butter on a hoagie bun fried the inside on a pan and enjoyed.

This is the most awesome pulled pork I have made.  I followed the recipe to the T and have made it twice with rave reviews.  I gave the recipe to a friend as well and she loved it!  We use honey BBQ sauce and it turns out great.

Outstanding! I got lots of compliments today. It goes great on a toasted bun with a creamy slaw or on a tortilia with a little sour cream, black bean salsa. shredded monteray jack and a tangy slaw.I cooked a 6.5 lb shoulder overninght in a slow cooker about 7.5 hours, came out fine. Try it, you'll like it!

Wow this recipe is amazing and so versatile.  I changed the honey to brown sugar and used a pork loin and it was so amazing.  I also topped it with avocado and mango pico di gio Oh my gosh this was a hit.

My husband and I both work full-time, so we did the first part of prep the night before and put it in the slow cooker overnight. Then, we added the mango puree and slow cooked another 4 hours (then on warm) while we were at work. We came home to ultra-succulent pork with just the right hints of sweetness and heat. Definitely recommend it!

I made this for the first time tonight and it was fabulous!! I read a lot of the reviews and followed what a lot of others wrote....I used a 5 pound pork shoulder and did not have ripe fresh mangos and my local grocery store only had canned ones.  I put the juice from the can in with the water and balsamic vinegar and cooked it for 6.5 hours on low in a crock pot.  I only used 12 oz of bbq sauce and pureed both cans of mangos.  I added a touch of brown sugar for sweetness as well.  I only cooked the pork for an additional 30 minutes after putting the sauce on it and only used half of the sauce and saved the rest for later. Definitely a keeper!!!

Although I did modify a bit (more Bourbon & only 1 BBQ sauce) this was fabulous! I can't wait to make this again.

I didn't have pork shoulder, I had a pork loin roast in the freezer which was a little too dry, even after being in the slow cooker. I liked it, but the sauce was a little too sweet for my tastes so I probably will not make again.

Yummy!! This was so good. I will make this recipe again for sure. I followed the recipe exactly how it was written. This has a very tangy and depending on what kind of B.B.Q. sauce you prefer, can be very spicey. If you want to tone down the spiciness, I suggest a regular B.B.Q. sauce, such as Kraft. I ended up useing a sauce that already had a "kick" to it, but what can I say, I love the spice!!

W O W!  I held back one of the tspn's of Chili powder as we had young kids also eating this, and used jarred Mango from the produce sectcion. Since I didn't have any pits to add, I substituted some of the juice from the mango's for the water in the cooking of the pork.  The flavor was absolutely incredible! I served it with a Mango Coleslaw recipe from CookingLight.com, and it was a meal to remember! I had to stop my husband & son from eating it all so we would have leftovers for lunch.

This is my first review (since it's the first recipe I've made without additions/substitutions), and it was GREAT.  I made it for a party we hosted last night, and it disappeared fast.  So many compliments.  I also made a relish with fresh mango, red onion, lime juice, jalapenos, and cilantro to accompany the pork.  Very good, and very simple to prepare.

I've made this twice and will definitely be making it many more times in the future.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was terrific.  The second time I halved the recipe and only changed the meat to two teriyaki basted pork tenderloins because it is what I had on hand.  My family said the second version was sweeter but that wasn't a bad thing.  Overall definitely a keeper recipe!  Best on potato rolls too!

This was good. I thought it was pretty simple to put toghether and did not take me a lot of time to fuss over! My husband LOVED this a lot!! I did cut the black pepper down and added more mango to my reduction, but that is my personal choice. Thanks for a great recipe.

Um.  This was good.  But for the amount of work it took and extra shopping for mangos, I might try looking for a mango infused BBQ sauce or marinade instead.  Thanks, though.

Tastes great with a lovely sweet of the mango plus heat of the chipotle chili powder make for a tangy and surprising flavor.   Made this pretty much to the letter except I took guidance from some others and boosted the booze level. Added two serious glugs of cheap bourbon. I told myself this was to bring out the Umami of the tomatoes in the BBQ sauce. I think it worked ;)  Served on some serious rolls that could handle the ooey gooey shredded pork.

I thought this was good, but I would change a few things next time.  I think the sauce was a bit too sweet, and I didn't even use sweet BBQ sauce, so I would probably elimate the honey, unless the mango was not as ripe as it should be. Or just use the jarred mango in the refridge section, as they are always sweet. I would also mix in just part of the sauce to simmer with the pork at the end, because the whole amount seemed to overpower the pork to the point that all you could taste was the sauce.  That way when it is served, each person can determine how much sauce they want to add.  With these changes I would make it again, since it is cheap, easy and feed a large crowd!  On another note, you can get Chipotle Powder at Penzey's Spices.  If you don't have one where you live, you can mail order it through their catalog.

YUM!  This recipe was simple and so easy!  However it does take some time to pull the pork!  Everyone asked for seconds and thirds and huge hit with the kids!

I made this recipe last week.  It was absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly except I cooked it for about 12 hours.  (I had an eight pound, bone in, Boston Butt).  Next time I will purchase a boneless piece.  For my family I would not change a thing but if your family isn't into hot and spicy I'd cut down on the pepper a bit.  Will make this again and again.  Have not had a better pulled pork sandwich.

I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it!  I used a pork shoulder blade, but next time I would use a loin/tenderloin just because it was really fatty and greasy. I also couldn't find chipolte powder, so I used whole chipolte peppers (found canned in mexican area of grocery store), and pureed them with the mango.  I used bulls eye chipolte BBQ sauce and Kraft chicken and Rib.

There are no words to truly describe how incredibly good this stuff is.  The sweet spicy tartness is perfect.  I could eat this stuff all day.  Safeway makes these wonderful crusty kaiser rolls - we put it on those and wowzer!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This was absolutely delicious. Unfortunately I had to use regular chili powder as I failed to purchase the chipotle chili powder.  It was still amazing. My roast was 6 pounds so I increased the other ingredients by I 1/2 times to compensate for the larger piece of meat as well as cooking longer.   I did cook for the full 2 hours after adding the sauce to the shredded pork at the end. Yum yum. It is a keeper. Next time I will be sure to purchase the correct chili powder.  I forgot to mention that I made the absolutely awesome barbecue sauce to use in this recipe also from this website, but following another reviewers suggestion used bourbon instead of rum.

This was good. I did not do it as suggested. I did the smokey Applewood Grill Mates for the seasoning. I did do the two Mango seeds at the bottom. I did 1/2 cup of water and not 2 cups by mistake. I put at 8 hours in the slow cooker and came out great!  I think 2 cups would have been too much. Only used on bottle of BBQ sauce. That was plenty.

Love this dish! Had it for lunch at work, people tried to steal it! For fun, the second time I made it, I added a bit of crushed pineapple and its juice to the puréed mango. It added just a bit sweetness and tartness and made it even yummier!

I did a 7 lb bone-in shoulder and glad I did as others recommended and used just one 18 oz. bottle of barbecue sauce instead of two. Came out great using a Carolina sweet mustard BBQ sauce with Red Stag's Black Cherry bourbon whiskey. I would add a touch more Chipotle pepper next time, I felt it came out a bit on the milder side. If you're using cayenne don't increase those amounts.

Everyone agreed this was the best pulled pork recipe ever! I was a bit worried it may be too spicy for the children with 2 tablespoons of ground black pepper and a teaspoon of chipotle powder in the rub, so I didn’t add the last teaspoon of chipotle powder to the sauce, but it wasn’t spicy at all and I will add it next time I make it. For the bottled barbeque sauce I used Sweet Baby Ray's Barbecue Sauce. I think the barbeque sauce would be excellent on grilled chicken too.

No changes. Just a hint. If you own a nutri bullet, add half the bourbon to half if the mangos. It blends a lot easier. Do the same with the other half. I never do less than an 8 to 9 lb. pork shoulder.

Great take on pulled pork. Did a coleslaw with pineapple in it and they paired perfectly. I Usually save a shoulder for smoking, but this was incredible! Hard to get a shoulder as small as four pounds so just had to increase ingredients a little. But a go to when mangos are available. Threw my roommates for a loop when I paired it with a wild rice mix, made the kudos even better.

This was excellent!! It was the first time I made pulled pork, I was looking for a recipe for all the mangoes my tree is producing. If your mangoes are sweet, you really don't need the honey.

I made this with shredded chicken instead of pork and I used frozen mango.  The flavor is so good!  Served with an unsweet coleslaw to top on small buns.  It was GONE!  Have made this twice, both times for party/crowds.

Made it exactly as recipe stated. Way too spicy for our liking. If made again, would cut pepper in half, but doubt if will make again as like my own recipe much better.

Best pulled pork I've ever made.  I think the liquid really helped keep the meat moist - the roast pulled so easily!  And the sauce was a hit for both my sweet tooth and my BF's spicy cravings.

I rarely make recipes exactly as they are, but I did follow this one exactly and it was perfect. My company loved it and many people have asked me for the recipe. I used Weber original and honey barbeque sauce together. No msg or high fructose corn syrup in Weber.

I recently made this for my hubby and  his friends for a pot lock lunch.   My hubby said it was the first thing to go.  I am planning on making this, this weekend for the Super Bowl.  It is very easy to make and tastes great.  Thanks for a great recipe.  It is a keeper in my rotation.

This was really good! Used a 7 pound bone-in pork roast and Sweet Baby Ray's regular bbq (2 containers). Prepped the night before and threw it in the cooker the next day. Pulled it out after about 7 1/2 hours to tear the pork off the bone, then cooked with the sauce mixture for another hour and a half. The only thing is that it didn't really have too much of a smokey or bourbon-ish taste, may add more bourbon next time and/or a tiny bit of liquid smoke or something. The mango gives it a great sweetness with the chili powder. Good stuff!

Amazing flavor. I chose to use a super tangy barbecue sauce for this and it turned out great. I didn't worry about the pork absorbing the sauce once it was finished. I let it cook for the suggested time, but I'm not sure how much was actually absorbed.

I made it! My husband and mom loved it! I only used one bottle of BBQ sauce though. Two bottles would have definitely been too much. Now I'm being forced to make it for thanksgiving. Thanks for the recipe!

Came out just like the picture! Delicious! I used frozen mango chunks and it tasted great. The only problem was I paid $10 for a bottle of bourbon and couldn't taste it, maybe double the bourbon next time.

This came out phenomenal.  My local grocer didn't have mangos this week so I picked up the chopped frozen kind.  I also couldn't find chipotle chili POWDER so I bought crushed chipotle and pulsed it into a powder in the blender.    Everything else is as written in the recipe.  Leftovers are even better. This has such a nice smokey sweet bite.

Oh my gosh!! I work at BevMo in Seattle. When an elderly lady comes in to buy 2 mini bottles of bourbon at 10am, of course I will ask "whatcha cookin?" She tells me this recipe 
!! So of course I had to give it a try. Beyond great and easy! I am making for the 4th time Saturday for a neighbor family who's Dad is on hospice. Even the patient is excited. Thank you for such a yummy recipe!!

It's certainly good as is. However, I jazz it up a bit with one small minced onion and 4 finely chopped garlic cloves.

This is absolutely  amazing. I had a 6lb butt roast, so it was too big for my slow cooker. Instead I put it in a dutch oven in the oven at 300 degrees for 5 hours. It was full flavored and fall apart when I took it out. I also used 3 mangoes rather than 2, and it was the right call. My BBQ sauce was Stubbs Smokey Mesquite, and once again, it was the correct choice. I only used 1 bottle though, as any more would have been too much, and overwhelmed the mango. 

My wife, who isn't a huge pork fan, went nuts when I let her taste it. This is my new go-to pulled pork recipe. Thank you!

Made this for a Super Bowl gathering. Spot on amazing recipe. Made it exactly, except I doubled it. Absolute hit. I will be making this again. In fact my buddy wants me to make it for an upcoming UFC party he's having. Good thing I enjoy cooking. #digin

This was a great dish. Easy to make. The chipotle powder gave it a nice subtle spice. Where it didn't burn your mouth but after a bit you notice you're a bit warm!  The reason I only gave it three stars is I expected it to be a little sweeter, the mangoes did not come through as much as I wanted. I will definitely make it again just with more mango.

Great starter recipe!  However, I don't care for mangos, so I substituted peaches instead.  I used four medium peaches, cut and pureed for the sauce, along with the bourbon.  I didn't use nearly as much bbq sauce as the recipe called for.  Definitely not needed, unless  you like soupy pulled pork.  I also created a rub of chili powder, garlic powder and crushed red pepper and put in on the pork to sit overnight in the fridge.  In the morning, I put in  the slow cooker with balsamic vinegar mixture, along with juice from canned peaches.  The canned peaches were added to the fresh puree at the end.  Delicious!

This recipe is always a hit at parties, and it being in a slow cooker makes it even easier to prepare! I did have one minor "cheat": I added two cans of mango baby food to the sauce after it was done since the flavor isn't that prominent when using only mangoes, and it definitely kicked up the flavor a bit!

I have made this recipe twice now. The first time I used my slow cooker and added some spice. I thought it was a tad bit sweet but really good. This time, I used my pressure cooker for the meat on high for 55 minutes and than added the sauce and cooked on high for 25 minutes. I added an extra mango, and removed the honey. I added some red pepper and tabasco and it came out awesome! I also use pork sirloin. Yum!

After pulling from the slow cooker, I let it sit for a couple of hours covered with foil, then put it in my smoker for about an hour and half at about 225 - 250.  Pulled it straight from smoker and double wrapped tightly in foil and let sit for 4 hours before shredding.

I just made this for the previous weekend. It was fantabulous! I used a larger pork shoulder, closer to 10 lbs, so I doubled the chili powder, black pepper and salt, also I used it as a rub and let it sit in the fridge for  8-10 hours before putting it in the slow cooker. I made this for my son and I. I like the spicy stuff, he does not, so I used a honey BBQ sauce to sweeten and somewhat mask the chipotle chili powder. It had just a hint of heat, enough to notice, but not enough to stop my son from eating it! When I make it for myself, I will probably spice it up more and cut back on the sauce a little bit.

I have made this recipe several times and I get such good reviews! It is such a good recipe! I am Hispanic and like things with a little kick so I do add some paprika, cayenne pepper and cut up some jalapeño peppers :-) the mango adds a sweetness so it is a good combination :-)

I used a pork butt and pressure cooker for this recipe, which only took about one hour for the pork to cook and become very tender. I then let the pork simmer in the sauce for about 20 minutes. I only added about 9 ounces of Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce, and that was plenty. I also used regular chili powder instead of chipotle. My picky eating husband loved it. He even brought some to work for his co-worker, who really enjoyed it as well.

This recipe was good, but not any better than the other pulled pork recipes I've tried. The pork after cooking with balsamic vinegar and chili powder tasted very good, but I don't think the mango/honey/bourbon combination improved the barbecue sauce any. If you have mangoes that you need to use, it doesn't hurt to throw them in, but it also does not contribute in any memorable way.

A little strange, but good. Created a rub before I put the pork in the crock pot. Added a little brown sugar with the rub. Added a little more bourbon for taste. Will make again.

I used one 18oz bottle of BBQ sauce (cheap generic brand) and made a rub of the salt, pepper and chili powder as some one else suggested.  Otherwise I followed the directions, so yummy!!

Wow, this is the best pulled pork recipe I have ever had! My guests and hubby agree! The only changes I made, was I used Raspberry Balsamic Vinegar, only becuase I didnt have the regular in the house ( I plan to use regular next time though) and did about a quarter of a TSP. less of the Chipotle powder. I will be making this throughout the summer!

very good, tender, juicy.  I was worried that the liquor would overwhelm the sauce but it was perfect!  I used 4 smallish mango's sicne I had on hand and needed to use up.  Will make again!

OK, but there are many more recipes for pulled pork on this site that are better. Gave it a 2 star because it was edible. Made exactly as stated except only used 1 T of pepper because we thought that was a lot. It was because before we added the mango/BBQ sauce the pepper is all you tasted. We didn't use all the BBQ sauce either because just with what we used that is all you could taste when we did serve it. Guess we thought there would be more mango flavor, which we like.

My family and I absolutely love this recipe!  I've cooked it twice and have used different flavors of barbeque sauce and it always come out wonderfully.  This is a staple in my household from this point forward.

The recipe is outstanding.  Make sure that you cook the pork shoulder on the long side of 5-8 hours (I'd recommend more like 8-10 hours so it's much easier to pull.  The only problem with this recipe is that every time I've made it, I haven't ended up with any leftovers, only very full and happy friends.

Fabu! This is the best saucy pulled pork ever.  The family Loves the mango sauce!  Followed the recipe to the letter and I wouldn't change a thing.

Very good!  The usual few adjustments and I thought the amount of bbq sauce was too much.  I will use less next time, it drowned the other flavours.  I'm posting because I did NOT discard the cooking liquid, I kept it, cooled and then put in the fridge.  After the fat congealed I removed it, and used the broth.  I used it in a pork loin chop casserole with onions, garlic, tomatoes and mushrooms (and a bit of extra salt) and it was delicious.  I imagine it would be good with just about any dish.

first time making this and turned out great! used regular chili powder and plenty spicy for me. could always add hot sauce for those with cast iron stomachs. mine came out very moist almost like sloppy joe so if you like it drier cut back on added sauce and provide rest at table. very easy to make.

I'll never use another pulled pork recipe again!! Omg... it'll literally lay you out, crying for another sammy!! I poop you not!! The only thing I did different was add onions to the final cooking time. When you serve, throw some of your favorite cole slaw on it or next to it. Such a beautiful recipe. And it'll make your kitchen smell great, too! Way to go Rugger Ducky!! 
Anyone having problems with BBQ sauce, let me offer a tidbit. I use Sweet Baby Rays. My daughter puts that on her scrambled eggs. It's good stuff and accentuated the pork beautifully.

I made this last week and it was wonderful!  I had a 7 pound pork shoulder, but used the same amounts of everything else in the recipe.  Also used original Open Pit bbq sauce.  It had a nice kick, just perfect.  Will make this again soon (like tomorrow!)

This was a great pulled pork recipe.  It's not your usual run of the mill pulled pork sandwich ....  But OH so GOOD!  My family rated it as restaurant quality!!  I never get compliments like that on a new recipe.  THANKS for posting.

I have made this recipe several times and it turns out great each time. Always get raves from company about it! 
Unlike many other recipes I come across, this one does not really need adjusting or added ingredients. Although, honestly, I do not measure when I am putting together the BBQ sauce :-) Also, I use "Kinders BBQ sauce"; depending on the crowd as to whether I use their mild or hot, or a mixture of the two. I noticed when I pickup my last bottles they have an extra hot...can't wait to try this recipe with that! MMM!

Yum! A little messy work with the mangos. Also, I had to grind dried chipotle myself because I can't find chipotle chile powder already prepared anywhere. A little more work than I wanted to do for a slow cooker recipe but when I took one bite, everything was alright.  It is delicious.  I topped the pulled pork with cole slaw and served on a French roll.  Yummmmmy!!

The best pulled pork we have ever made, and I stayed true to the recipe for once.  We have tried a number of the pulled pork recipes here as well as our own, but this is the best yet.  The mango flavor comes through but is subtle.  We may add red pepper next time for some kick, but that is nit picking.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's regular BBQ sauce from Costco.

Made this for a bachelorette party and it was a huge success! I halfed the chili powder and used my home made BBQ sauce. The result was sweet and tangy and disappeared very quickly. Will make this one again!

I have traveled all over the country, and I have had pulled pork in at least 6 states. This is by far the best I have ever had! I followed the recipe exactly. AMAZING! I was "ordered" by the family to make this again :-)

I used chicken breast in place of the pork and it was great!  I just emailed this to several friends who attended a party at my house this weekend.  It was all women and I made this on dinner rolls to have "slider" portions.  I made 36 sandwiches and they all went! It was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  My 2 & 4 year old kids loved it...and my picky eating nieces gobbled them up too :) I did use the chipolte peppers in a can along with chili powder because that was all I could find.  The only other slight variation I did was about a 1/3 cup of brown sugar sprinkled over the chicken just before pouring the sauce.  This is a keeper! Thanks!

I was hesitant to make this recipe, but after reading all the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  It was definitely worth it!  This pork turned out incredible!!  My roommate said it's her new favorite recipe of mine.  Everyone at school is jealous when I reheat some left overs.  Like someone said before, if you are on the fence about making this, DO it!

I only use the chili powder to season the pork.  I find it you put it in the BBQ sauce as well it makes it too spicy for my kids.  But other than that it's delicious!

Rave reviews from guests on this. Was a little bit too spicy so I need to adjust next time. I think I used too much of the chili powder in combination with Stubb's spicy sauce. Otherwise, followed recipe exactly. Yummy - thanks!

I followed the recipe and the next time I make it I will lighten up on the amount of ground pepper and also cut back on the bbq sauce.  I had a 5lb pork shoulder and it seemed that there was still too much pepper and too much bbq sauce.  Those 2 flavors seemed to overpower the pork.  It still was very tasty.

Yum...this was awesome! I had to use frozen mango chunks because my grocery store was out of fresh mangoes...and it was still so good! Per some of the other reviews, I used only one bottle of BBQ sauce and thought it was perfect. I will make this over and over again!

Great recipe.  Didn't have chipotle peppers, so I got a can of chiles in adobo and used that.  My wife was concerned about it being too spicy, so I only used one pepper from the can - we couldn't taste it at all!  Next time I'll use the whole can; the pork absorbs a lot of flavor as it cooks.  We ended up mixing in some ground cayenne pepper when we served it.  Next time I'll avoid the messy hassle of peeling mangoes by buying frozen mango chunks; they would work fine in this recipe.  Speaking of frozen, this pulled pork freezes really well; a smallish Gladware of this is just the right amount for two adults' dinner.

I am not a huge pulled pork fan, but this recipe has made me a huge fan!!!  It does not last long in our house.  Our friends and family love this, it's just the right amount of everything!  I followed the recipe to a "T", thanks so much RuggerDucky :)

Nice! My fiance and I enjoyed our dinner quite a bit :) We especially enjoyed the slightly sweet, subtly spicy sauce (yum-o!). Altough I like RuggerDucky's recipe, I still prefer BBQ Pork for Sandwiches submitted by KMB233 for the simple fact that it is waaay more economical (only calls for BBQ sauce and beef broth) and a tad simpler to prepare (no stovetop step is required - just slow cook, shred and mix with your favorite sauce). I couldn't detect the bourbon in this at all, so I am not sure that it is necessary - but maybe omitting it would change the recipe entirely... who knows!??!!?!?. In an attempt to make this more "economical," I purchased a 2.25 lb. package of country style pork ribs at my local Italian market. My butcher suggested that I use the cheapest cut of meat available (this week it was ribs); he said that it is not necessary to buy more expensive cuts of meat for slow cooking purposes (even the toughest cuts of meat will "tenderize" when cooked for a long period of time), but I already knew that... lol! I cooked my meat for 8 hours on low, added almost an entire 18 oz. bottle of Baby Ray's sweet vidalia onion BBQ sauce and then cooked for another hour (we were HUNGRY!!!). I served heaping mounds of meat on fresh sesame kaiser rolls along with a side of homemade potato chips, compliments of my AWESOME fiance! Thanks for sharing your recipe with us, RuggerDucky :) I'll be freezing leftovers for a quick future meal!

The pork itself was very, VERY good! I liked the sauce, but i think next time i will keep it on the side rather than mixing it all together, or keeping a portion of the pork seperate because after having leftovers twice i was sort of over the mango-bourbon sauce. The sauce was delicious, don't get me wrong, I just like to vary what I eat!  Pretty easy to do and it was my first time making pulled pork.

This had a great flavor and was not too difficult to prepare, but it was wayyyyy too spicy for me.  My husband said it was just right for him, but I will cut way back on the chipotle next time.

Super delish!  The smallest piece of pork shoulder available at our grocery store was 7.25 lbs, so I increased the cooking liquid by half which was plenty.  I removed the excess fat from the pork after it was done cooking.  I kept the sauce the same, and they came out saucy enough.  VERY tasty!  Only recommendation - get a crusty roll that can hold up to the sauciness of the pulled pork.  We had soft rolls that were nearly falling apart by the time we were finishing our sandwiches.

this was a lot of work, but the two of us ate it for 4 nights. very tasty. I used mangos in a jar also. chipolte pepper from a can - just one pepper. Before I put it back in crock pot with sauce, I pulled off all fat. Made a big difference. thanks for the tip to buy a little bottle of bourbon. only 1.50 at liquor store.

I  found out that the smell and taste of cooked mango isn't my favorite. However, I can tell that this is good nonetheless, and my boyfriend loves it. I got the jarred mangoes and just used the liquid from that to cook the meat in, along with the water. I also just used the chili powder, works fine. I used a honey chipolte bbq sauce.  I shall be making this again for friends and family.

This was an awesome recipe. I used Big Al's KC BBQ Sauce also from the site (24 servings and both mangos, however, otherwise I scaled the recipe to half. Being from NC and having wonderful pit cooked BBQ always at our disposal I am spoiled and this was good, but it definitely wasn't pit cooked. However, for a slowcooker pork and the NO FUSS recipe it deserves 4 stars in my opinion and is definitely worth a try. The mango does add a wonderful "new" flavor. I'll make this again!

This is a great recipe. I couldn't find fresh mango so I used canned. I cooked the pork in the juice (and added water to equal two cups of liquid) and used the rest for the sauce. I also added one canned chipotle pepper to the blender.

I had high hopes for this recipe but unfortunately the family didn't like the robust and "strange" flavor of the sauce. The recipe was followed exactly however there was no mention of a specific brand of bbq sauce. I used Kraft original since it was a BOGO and the recipe called for 2 bottles. Perhaps the flavor would have been better with a different brand.

This recipe is awesome! After eating a lot of BBQ on a recent cross country trip, I was anxious to experiment with various recipes at home in my new slow cooker. I prepared the pork exactly as described and would not change a thing.I did have two different BBQ sauce flavors on hand, one hickory smoke flavor, and the other, believe it or not, a bourbon flavor. Together they really enhanced the flavor to that which I remembered from somewhere on the road. It was even better the next day. I'll look forward to serving this often at summer BBQ's.

I made this for my work Christmas party and it was a smashing success.  I doubled the pork and left the sauce alone.  I used 1 bottle of honey chipotle sauce and 1 bottle of raspberry chipotle sauce, exchanged the fresh mangoes for jarred ones (I can never tell when they are ripe), and substituted Southern Comfort for the whiskey because that's what I had.  Still came out great.

This was incredible! When I went to the grocery store to get the pork, they didn't have enough left of what I needed so I had to scale down the recipe a bit, but it turned out great. My one suggestion is to make this during mango season. In the middle of winter, mangoes aren't the best, but even with that, the recipe turned out great. I can't wait to try this again in summer!

This was simple and easy to make...a hit with kids and adults alike! It will be a recipe which will be made several times over the next year.
