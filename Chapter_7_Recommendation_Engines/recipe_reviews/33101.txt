Notes: Tasty! For easier prep I added 1 egg to the batter (thinner pancakes--no slicing necessary) and used 1/4 cup less milk in the almond topping (5min less time in oven). Try 1/3 cup batter per pancake--roll pan to spread batter for large, thin 6-8" diameter crepe-like pancake. 1/8-1/4 cup applesauce filling per pancake. I added a few drops of almond extract into the applesauce filling since I had no almonds on hand, and a touch of cinnamon. Served with maple syrup for a deeply flavored breakfast that is not too rich. The crispy edges on the pancakes and puffy, juicy insides make an exotic, almost French cooking-esque contrast in your mouth. Wow.

The batter was too thick and hence the rolls were too thick.Some guidance on consistency would have been helpful. Also the directions on how to slice the rolls were unclear and not even sure the purpose of it.  The remaining batter poured over the cakes held everything together. First time "builder" of German pancakes.
BTW, in spite of thickness, they were still very yummie.

I really loved this recipe, I added cinnamon and fresh nutmeg, because I love them. and left out the applesauce and raisins. I used hot maple surup with a small bit of bacon fat. Wonderful

This was not what I expected. My husband said it wasn't anything special and,y son said it had an odd taste. I confused at how this was supposed to turn out. The pancakes were small and thick and didn't stay rolled and everything was runny when I went to put it on the place. I gave it two stars because at least my husband ate all the food in his plate.

I'm disappointed I spent the time making this.
