This is nearly identical to an old family recipe I inherited from my husband's Finnish auntie.  The major difference is that I make the dressing - mayo, sugar, freshly grated Parmesan all mixed well - ahead of time and set aside. I then layer chopped lettuce, chopped cauliflower, extra crispy bacon, and diced red onion and repeat before "sealing" the whole thing with the dressing spread over the top.   Then, just as the recipe says, I toss the entire thing just before serving so the veggies are fresh and crisp and the dressing ingredients have had time to marry well.  I usually make this a couple hours ahead of time, but never overnight.  It's a great salad and goes wonderfully with ham.  Definitely give this one a go!

I didn't plan ahead so when I found this recipe, there wasn't time to layer and refrigerate overnite.  I just assembled all of the salad ingredients, mixed the mayo, sugar & parmesan and then tossed together.  I used green peas and the lettuce I had on hand included carrots and purple cabbage - so they added some extra "layers."  This is high up on my list of favorite salads and a taste I haven't had for quite a while.

This is a wonderful salad that I have been preparing for years.  I have never used sugar in this salad, just one cup of salad dressing (Miracle Whip) which I find sweet enough.  In my recipe I do use 3/4 cup of parmesan; one medium red onion and 1 lb. of cooked bacon, crumbled.   My one caution is make sure the lettuce and cauliflower are throughly dry before layering the salad.  If the lettuce isn't dry, it makes the salad too watery.

This recipe was so good however I made a few changes: instead of iceberg I used Romaine and mixed the mayonnaise and sugar together.

I made this for the first time for our family's Christmas holiday.  It was a huge hit and disappeared before anything else.  Everyone loved it, including my husband who's sometimes hard to please.  It's definately a "keeper"!  Followed the recipe as it appears...very easy and will make it over and over again!

Very similar to a family recipe that I have though we don't use peas but I may now in the future. I also use romain instead of head lettuce and miracle whip instead of mayo.

I don't think I've ever had a layered salad so it was very interesting.  I combined all the dressing ingredients plus onion and bacon in a container a night before.  I was worried about the amount of sugar but I made it as it's said.  It was pretty sweet but surprisingly it didn't bother me too much.  I only used a half amount of sugar the second time I made it and it was great.

I first sampled this at a grocery store demo years ago and loved it.  Every time I make this I always get rave reviews.  Even people who don't like cauliflower eat this salad.

I brought this to my boyfriends family's house for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit for all but the diabetics who tasted the sugar right away. I think it's a great holiday salad..

After I put this in the fridge to chill, I thought how it would be good with peas in it. I just noticed that the photo shows it with peas. Why it's not listed in the ingredients, I don't know, but I think it would be 5-stars with peas and maybe purple cabbage in it. I made a much smaller batch for two people and it turned out very good. The only bad thing is, leftovers are not feasible. It gets very wet & soggy after it's been tossed. I will try mixing mayo & sugar, then tossing it and the bacon in before serving, just for the amount I need.

Made this for Easter and everyone loved it.  I also added sunflower seeds and raisins.  And a little white vinegar to the dressing and just tossed with the dressing right before serving.

Wow! Fantastic!  I made this as a side dish for a cook out for my very picky teenager daughter & her friends.  It was a huge hit -- They finished every delicious bite.  Totally gone.  I added only frozen peas to the basic recipe.  Delicious.

We had this at a family dinner over the weekend and it was as delish as i remember it always being. I knew this as "iced salad," b/c of the dressing being spread over the top to sit awhile before serving, but whatever it's called, this is simply one of the best salads! Of course, anything with bacon is gonna be good. ;O)  Over the years i've adjusted the amount of sugar to fit with how we eat now, but the lower amt of sugar hasn't affected how popular it is around here. Thanks, Denise!

My family loves this.  To increase the nutrition, I use kale instead of iceberg, drop the bacon to 6 pcs, and put in a little less sugar.  You can also add other random veggies, such as red cabbage, shredded carrots, edamame, or peas.  Healthy summer side dish, great for a cookout.
