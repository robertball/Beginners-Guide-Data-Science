Made this for company; received rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I did double the ground pepper in the rub, but left the salt as per the recipe. Next time I would reduce the salt, as I found this a bit salty for my tastes; my guests had mixed opinions on that account - so I guess it depends on personal taste.

I made this last night for my husband and son. I followed the recipe as written and we had quite the feast! The meat was so tender and had a wonderful taste. The fennel was perfect without being overwhelming. I liked it so much that I plan to make it again for a party I'm having.

I made this dish for dinner last night and it was a big hit.  It was very easy to make.  I ended up making 2 flank steaks (they only had double packages) and doubled the amount of marinade and rub. Due to how late I had to work the meat marinated overnight instead of 2 hours.  It was extremely flavorful and amazing.
