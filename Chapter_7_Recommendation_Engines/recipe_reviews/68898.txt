Very good!  The potatoes are much better if you use leftover baked from the night before.  Also, try beating the egg yolks and whites separately (beating the whites until they form soft peaks)...then mix the two together until combined.  The eggs get really fluffy that way (a trick I learned from a chef I used to work with at a fine restaurant).  Good luck!

I used the Ore Ida frozen hash browns - the cubed kind - and it came out great.  It was a big time and mess saver as well.  I added an extra egg and mixed in some monteray jack cheese with the cheddar, and it was deliccious.

A good place to start, but very bland as written. I seasoned my eggs with garlic and onion powders, black pepper and Mexican spices. This is a great dish to make when you want to clean out your fridge because almost anything goes. I also threw in broccoli, zucchini, green bell peppers and grape tomatoes. Used pepper jack cheese with this to give it a kick. End result was delicious. Thanks so much!

This IS a great recipe. I altered it slightly by using the Ore-Ida hashbrowns (the shredded kind) and sprinkling diced tomatoes and green onions just before adding the cheese and gave it great color. I also used 6 eggs for volume and whisked them separately as in the other review. The result was a thicker and fluffier frittata that made a great main course for breakfast. You could also add sliced black olives and a dollop of sour cream for a lunch or dinner dish. The only thing I would change is reduce the first baking time to 7 minutes and once you put the tomatoes, green onion, and cheese on, the cheese takes longer to get all bubbly, so I had to bake it for another 7-8 minutes in addition to the first 10 and it made the eggs kind of dry. Next time I make it, I will try it with the Ore-Ida cubed potatoes.

This was great.  The only changes I made were to add some diced ham before adding the eggs and I used diced potatoes rather than shredded.  This is a great basic recipe that would be fun to play around with!

Mine turned out great, because I followed other reviewers and added oregano, thyme, parmesan. I also chopped some bacon and fried it, then fried my finely diced potates in the same pan. Not the healthiest way, but yummy. I only gave 3 stars because this would have been super bland had I not made these changes.

This recipe is so good and so easy!  I made it exactly like the recipe but I did increase the eggs by 2....my super finicky 17 year old son went back for seconds!  This one is a keeper!  Thanks!

Had a difficult time making this.  Potatoes kept sticking to my pot (guess I need a new pot)and so I added extra oil.  End result was a big greasy gloppy mess.

This is a fantastic recipe. If your potatoes are sticking,  please consider the source to be your pan and/or cooking technique as opposed to the recipe. I used a well-seasoned cast iron pan with a bit of butter and grapeseed oil, and had delicious crispy potatoes and well-cooked eggs. Use your own discretion for seasoning: if you like a lot of flavor, add seasonings and salt and hot sauce for a kick...don't blame a simple recipe for not being seasoned enough for your tates...like onion? Add onion, like more cheese, add it...5 stars for simplicity, cost, and ease.

The trick is getting the hash browns right!  I finally discovered the secret after countless failures.  Shred the hash potatoes and squeeze all the water out.  Over the heated oil, put all the hash browns in a thin layer.  Cook for 7 minutes and flip to cook another 7 or 8.  I'm a bad flipper so I use a plate to help.  You can add anything to this!  I've used the recipe as stated, added and used garlic, paprika, Parmesan cheese mixed in w/ the eggs and always add turkey sausage on top.  After I do the hash browns, I move to a shallow pie dish and dump the 6 eggs over it.  The recipe is amazing, you just have to know how to do the hash browns right!

Use more oil than specified.  The potatoes stick to EVERYTHING if you don't.  If the pan hadn't been salvageable I'd have taken another star.  Beyond that, not bad.  Not bad at all.  I plan to make it again, but slight differences:  1) I'm going to fry some bacon in the pan first, use that oil, and crumble the bacon on top before I put the egg on.   2) I'm going to add some peppers, maybe even a bit of cilantro.

Delicious!  I added some broccoli, a 1/2 tsp garlic powder and touch of oregano.  I also used 1 large potato and 6 eggs.  I don't eat dairy so I used Daiya cheddar and it was fantastic!

Finally, what I've been looking for.  I added more eggs and mixed the cheese up in the egg before I poured it over the potatoes.  Also added leftover broccoli & cauliflower - yum.  Sprinkled garlic powder and Everglades seasoning in addition to salt and pepper.  Deeeee LISH!

This recipe was great!  It allowed clean up time which is important to me.  With most breakfasts, Im racing around the kitchen creating a greasy mess.   I made a couple changes and added some left over kabassa meat.  Instead of using baked potatoes, I shreaded some with a grater and fryed them with onion and chive.  I also added fresh parsley and it was FANTASTIC!

This was the first frittata I have made.  It was simple and tasty, although it could use a little kick.  Green peppers and more onion perhaps.  Also I think next time I will add some seasoning salt to the potatoes while they are frying.

THIS WAS VERY GOOD.  MY POTATOES GOT A LITTLE MUSHY INSTEAD OF CRISPY BUT THEY BAKED UP NICELY IN THE OVEN.  I ADDED GREEN PEAS AND ACTUALLY USED 5 EGGS INSTEAD OF 4 AND TWICE AS MUCH CHEESE.  WOULD BE GOOD WITH A LITTLE CRUMBLED BACON OR HAM, TOO.

Oh dear. This is, quite easily, the worst thing I have made in a long time. The problem was the potatoes - I fried them for about 15 mins as stated, and they didn't get crispy or golden. Instead, they formed a big nasty sticky gloopy mess. I added the onions, and it was still awful. The egg and cheese topping was nice enough, but, hey, I really like omelet. For me, this was a real waste of time and ingredients. Sorry.

I liked this dish.  I have never made, nor had a frittata before.  This was good.  I did add some green onions for color and some mushrooms.  We used this for a sandwich on some toasted french bread.  It turned out to be a very good brunch recipe.  Thanks for the post.

I made this dish this morning and my family liked it. As someone suggested, I aqueezed the water out after grating the potatoes for crispiness. Instead of cheddard cheese, I used pepper jack for more spicy flavor!I'll make it again for sure.

made this for my family of four tonight and i should have made MORE because everyone wanted seconds!  didnt shred the potatoes, but sliced them, very thin. added to oil and spice in pan, but  instead of cooking stovetop, i baked them in the oven for about 10 min.  then back to the stovetop where i added the eggs.  put back in oven for recommended time and then added cheese.  served with sour cream and salsa!!!  delicious!!!!

this was really yummy! Okay to make it so much simpler just bake some potatos and let them cool then peel them. Cut that up and use it and just use a baking dish.

This recipe was good, but a little dry. I might have cooked it for a tad too long. I tripled the recipe for a party and ended up cooking it in a 2-inch deep baking dish instead of a skillet. Worked perfectly. Added some garlic and seasoned salt to the mix. I would have added some spinach, but didn't have any on hand. It needed a bit more cheese than the recipe called for, but overall, I think I will definitely be making this again.

What a great basic recipe!  You start with this and add what you like.  For me, it's bacon!  I fried bacon to crispy, cooked the frozen hashbrowns in the fat, and when I poured the eggs in topped with the crumbled bacon.  Yummm!  Would also be good with red bell pepper and/or mushrooms.  Must try that.  I've made this several times and like it more each time.  Thamks

So very good.  I did make a couple adjustments.  First, I used some baby red potatoes and pre-cooked them in the microwave for 5 minutes then chopped them.  I added ground pepper, paprika, 1/4 chopped onion to the potatoes and sautéed for about 5 minutes.   I then topped the potatoes mixture with some chopped sausage and finally the egg mixture.  I cooked the rest of this according to the recipe.  Even my four year old thought this was great!!  I might recommend adding a few more eggs if you are looking for of that consistency!   Otherwise, great recipe, that could have many different variations!!

2 tablespoons isn't enough oil to fry these potatoes, nor are 4 eggs enough to fill a 12 inch skillet.  Either use a 10 inch or up to 6 eggs.  It is also rather bland as is, but that just leaves the recipe open to interpretation.

Simple, quick and delicious! 

I slice the potatoes thinly instead of shredding them, and I add a little cooked bacon between the potatoes and eggs before baking. Otherwise, I made no other changes and this is delicious!

A great Sunday morning treat. Thanks!

Mine turned out to be more of a potato dish than a frittata.  I wanted more egg and cheese.  Next time, I'll double the eggs and cheese.

I have made this for breakfast 2 days in a row. The dish wasn't as moist as I expected it would be, but it came out as a very good meal. Probably should have added more salt with the potatoes, but I liked it anyway.

This recipe was very simple and delicious. I thinly sliced 2 Yucon Gold potatoes instead of shredding them. I like the way the finished product looked with the sliced potato. I also used a cup of cheese with 1/2 mixed in with the eggs and 1/2 added to the top as the recipe called for. I didn't find this bland at all. I think the other reviewers who described it as bland didn't add enough salt and pepper to the recipe. I served this with Salsa Verde for an extra kick.

Good base recipe for a fritatta. Went over well at our holiday brunch. We added some extra spices such as garlic powder, onion powder, and parsley to make it a bit more to our tastes, but it was nice and easy to make! Thanks :)

The inside tasted pretty good, but the outside inch and a half or so got kind of weird and rubbery.  Also, reheated very poorly I thought.

I was tempted to make this recipe as it was written but logic told me it needed more.  Isimply added garlic and much more it the way of spices.  Also, I used a picante on the side for dipping.  This would have earned it close to 5 stars.

This dish turned out well for the most part, made this for Mothers Day brunch and it was very much enjoyed.  I added two more egg whites and did as another reviewer suggested, whisked the egg whites and yolks separately, and what a great tip!  Very fluffy! I also added some thyme and sage for some added flavor.  I will definitely use this again in the future!

Good recipe!  I made it with the Ore-Ida hash brown and did not cook the onion with the potatoes.  I carmelized the onion separately and added both later, so that I got a sweeter taste.  I also whipped the eggs whites (as suggested by someone) and folded in the yolks.  I got a great fluffy frittata that was a hit!

My son and I have made this several times.  I decided to  adjust the recipe to fill the skillet a little thicker. I used 4 or 5 potatoes, diced and 9 or 10 eggs.  We use different spices and different cheeses every time we make this.  We also have used bacon once and sausage another time.  We have to bake it at 350 degrees because of my skillet's temperature restrictions, for about 12 to 15 minutes.  Then top with lots of cheese and return to just melt the cheese.  This makes enough for us to eat all day and maybe even for the next morning.  My aunt had never had one and she loved it also.  Thanks for sharing this great basic recipe.

Brilliant base recipe! This went down a treat in our house tonight. Added an extra egg (all beaten with an electric beater- nice & fluffy!), a red onion, peas, parsley, basil & tumeric. Will definitely make again.

Great tips from the others. I diced the potatoes, fried it, mixed it with fried onions, garlic and leek. Sprinkled chopped tomatoes, spring onions and fried bacon on top. Poured in the beaten eggs (white and yolks beaten separately). Served it with fruit. Excellent !

I read through reviews before making, and followed the following tips: I cubed my potatoes, added bacon, 6 eggs, mushrooms,a few types of cheeses and used seasoning salt too. I am not a huge fan of eggs, but I was able to enjoy. My husband thought it was very good!

This was very good, but next time I think I will cube the potatoes.  I found that they didn't crisp up like I would have liked.   I also added bacon to it as well which I will do again

It was good especially since I am not really an egg eater. I added some garlic, parmesan cheese and mushrooms. The only problem I had was frying up the potatoes. It was a gloopy messy. Next time I will buy pre-made hash browns.

Fast and easy!  The kids loved it (I scaled it to feed 6) and they wanted more.  Next time I will double it.  I whipped the egg whites as mentioned in one of the reviews, other than that I made it as directed and it came out great!

My daughter loves this dish! I add crumbled breakfast sausage and a diced orange pepper (I saute it with the onion) so that there is more veggies.

I liked recipe and will make again with probably some small changes. It didn't have much taste, even with the onions I felt it was a little bland. I think adding some breakfast sausage or bell peppers would add flavor.... But overall I thought it was a great breakfast dish.

I too use frozen shredded hash browns.  This recipe is so easy to make and was a great hit with my husband.  It could be a brunch or dinner meal.  Mix it up with scallions, monteray jack with jalepenos, etc.;whatever suites your fancy.

Big disappointment.  I fried my shredded potatoes for a good 30 mins. & they just never got past the gooey phase.  I gave the recipe the benefit of the doubt & piled on the rest of the ingredients & tossed it all into the oven.  The end result:  nasty, gooey & it just wall went into the trash.

This was good, but I made a few changes and next time I will make some additional changes.  I followed other's suggestions and increased the number of eggs to 6 and added garlic and additional spices -- dried oregano and a multi-purpose seasoning blend.  I did not bake the frittata, but cooked it on the stovetop and then finished it under the broiler.  I also added some crumbled bacon under the cheese.
The next time I make it, I will probably use frozen shredded hash browns.  The fresh potatoes did not get as crispy as I would have liked, maybe too much moisture?  I will also add the onions either before or with the potatoes rather than after.  All in all, pretty tasty.

Yum!  Took advice of other reviewers and upped the eggs to 6 and added other seasonings (garlic, italian seasoning).  Will use frozen hash browns next time for convenience, but it was still so easy!

Yes, a good start, but bland unless you add some more goodies and spices.  I added bacon and black olives and would've added more spices, but knew my kids wouldn't like it spiced up.  This is a great quick meal that is healthy and a good way to clean out the fridge.

I took advice from a number of reviewers: sliced the potatoes instead of shredded them, added a couple of eggs and seasonings (season salt & garlic powder) and I thought this turned out just dandy.  I can't say for sure how long I fried the potatoes, but I think 15 minutes on medium-high is about right.  I mixed the cheese in with the beaten eggs and baked at 400 for about 13 minutes.  The eggs were set and not too brown.  Topped with some chives and this, my first frittata was quite yummy.

This was good but very heavy.  Also shredding the potatoes is a hassle. If you make it I suggest using frozen hash browns.

This is a great base recipe and should be followed for the technique but you've got to add some spices and additional ingredients.  I recommend using the packaged refrigerated hash browns or frozen to save a step. I opted to add some diced red bell pepper along with the onion (both diced very finely).  I also added some cooked, chopped turkey breakfast sausage, about 1/8 cup shredded parmesan, 1 tsp. oregano and 1 tsp thyme. The result was great with these modifications. Good with sour cream on the side.

I give this recipe 2 stars because I want to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I want to feel like perhaps some of my disappointment with this recipe is an error on my part - realistically I know I followed the directions to the letter.  The potatoes didn't cook in the instructed about of time, as I knew they would not, so I cooked them a bit longer.  The recipe just really didn't have alot of flavor in my opinion.  It was simple, but simple isn't everything.  I would have enjoyed scrambled eggs with hash browns on the side much more.

This was excellent.  I cubed the potatos into bite size pieces because I don't have a shredder, but other than that I followed the recipe.  This was absolutely delicious!!!  I will definitely be making this again.

This is so easy! I cooked it in a copper baking pan and it slid out without any problem. I recomment a little tomato and sour cream as a garnish. It could easily be adapted to include other ingredients.

Good, quick starter recipe that you can add more ingredients that your family enjoys: i.e. mushrooms, garlic, spices, bacon, et. al. I appreciated Patty Crocker's recommendation to make a merengue (by separating egg whites from egg yolks, beating them separately and achieving stiff peaks with the egg whites and folding back into the blended egg yolks). I also par boiled the potatoes in salt water with baking soda -- the baking soda reduces is a great little trick that makes for much better baked or fried potatoes. Thank you for posting!

I doubled the recipe and used red onion.  used 15" cast iron skillet.  Next time I would add 2 more eggs to make it slightly thicker.  really great for a quick meal that can easily be customized to your taste.

One of the most versatile recipes I've seen in years!  I actually tweaked it a bit the second time I made it and used frozen hash browns, added real bacon bits and frozen spinach (I like spinach) to make it a more complete dinner and the entire thing was done and on the table in under 30 minutes.

Thanks for the idea!  I was feeling particularly lazy so used what was left of a bag of Jimmy Dean sausage skillet (has potatos, onion and peppers).  Made as written and topped with some Tabasco. May actually use less cheese next time but really easy and good.

Recipe is good place to start. I used leftover roasted potatoes and sweet potatoes, sautéed mushrooms, onions and red pepper. Seasoned with salt, pepper bit of garlic powder, onion powder, added a touch of thyme and my favourite herb  with eggs tarragon. When I put in the casserole pan the beaten eggs didn't quite cover so added another 2 eggs baked for 10 mins added grated balder son cheddar cheese, baked another 7 mins. Served with sliced ripe tomatoes. Nice enough for company and easier than doing omelettes..

Needs a lot of salt. Instead of shredding the potatoes, I diced them and it gave it more of a "southern home cooked" feel (: This is a good recipe and it's super easy

This recipe is a bit bland as written but could serve as a good base. I may try it again with some additional herbs and vegetables because it's a substantial, wheat-free vegetarian option.

Good & Easy!  I modified the recipe based on what was in the fridge. I used cooked red potatoes from another night. Sliced them thin. Also, I added finely chopped one garlic clove and red & yellow bell peppers cooked until soft in olive oil.  Then, I did a sprinkling of chiffonade of spinach.  Delicious!

Yummy!  What a great way to use our cast iron skillet!  This was my first time making frittata and I'm glad I picked the perfect recipe! 

Everyone in our family loved it!  Their only critiques were, too much potato and that it needs more egg and meat.  I'll definitely try making it with sausage next time.  We'll be making this potato and cheese frittata again!

First time frittata maker. Turned out better than expected. I used sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes and broccoli. Used 4 eggs, too dry...kind of looked like, I dunno, damp bread crumbs. Moved frittata from the skillet to a small glass baking pan, sprinkled on spices including jerk pepper sauce. Put it in oven for 7 mins, then added a fifth egg on top, put it back in oven, then added grated cheddar cheese. Definitely making again!

This was delightful! I added some smoked sausage and some tomato slices and I love cheese so I added A LOT of it, my mother-in-law and daughter loved it. Mom was talking about how we need to make it more often and even make it for dinner and make some french toast or pancakes to go with it! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I tried this recipe today, and it was delicious! I cubed the potatoes, and added 1/2 of crumbled bacon to it; I just love that nice smoky flavor of bacon! :) I also tried the trick with beating the white part of the egg and yolk separately, and then combining them - it worked! They turned out to be very fluffy! Quick and easy! Now, Fritatta is one of my favorite breakfast dishes! :) Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This is a MUST try dish!  I made this last night and is now one of my favourite recipes and I will be making it many more times.  I diced the poatoes not shredded them. Added chopped red and organe bell peppers.  Mixed some of the cheese into the dish before baking then added the last 1/4 of it to the top to brown before serving.  I love this recipe site and love this dish!

A good start, but would be bland without some additions based on previous reviews.  Added garlic with the onion, shredded Parmesan with the egg, mushrooms, spinach, and cayenne. Great topped with sour cream!

I used Southwestern Style Simply Potatoes (found by eggs in grocery store) added diced tomato and ham. It was delicious!!! The Simply Potatoes made this recipe even easier. My family actually thought I bought the frittata pre-made from the store.

I baked tater tots and used those in place of the potatoes. I also chopped up and fried bacon with the onions, for my 12" cast iron skillet I increased the eggs to 9 and that gave it the volume I am use to in a frittata. It was great! Thanks.

I made this exactly as stated, but used EggBeaters instead of real eggs. It turned out very delicious:-) It is a nice quick, easy recipe to put together after a long day at work and provided leftovers for the next day for the two of us.

took forever to cook the shredded potatoes -they didn't crisp up. Used a wrought iron pan - after addding th eggs and cooking in the oven, it was very thin, because of the size of the pan. Tasted ok....

Great basic recipe to customize. I added chopped red bell peppers. fresh basil, and chopped garlic to the potatoes and mixed ground cayenne, curry powder, milk and wheat germ into the eggs before adding to the potato mix. Topped it with grated medium cheddar. Was wonderful! Boyfriend loved it too!

Hi new to the board but I use this website all the time. This was really easy bto do. I added the different cheeses and the bacon bits on the top like
suggested, as well as seasoning the potatoes while frying. My boyfriend who can live off of instant noodles loved it.
Thanks for this!

I made this using one potato and 7 eggs and a combo of butter & olive oil. I used dried onions and onion powder instead of an onion and sprinkled parmesan, mozzarella & colby-jack cheese on top. Made a very nice dinner with homemade toasted bread & a jello salad.

Very yummy. I added a little garlic for flavor. It was still a little bland. Next time I will use frozen hash browns for convenience and add jalapenos for zip.

This was super yummy, and allowed clean up time.  I added ham and 2 more eggs.  I also used shredded hash browns (mine were frozen in a block which was a pain, but with some patience finally broke up).  Next time I will definitely add some more spices to liven up the flavor just a bit OR, will probably use the southwestern style potatoes that are in the refridgerator section at the grocery store.  Def a keeper!

This was very good. My potatoes browned and crisped, unlike a few people's reviews I read. Maybe the medium-high on my stove is hotter than others. I did add a little more onion. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I see the recommendation to use some crumbled sausage. I think I'll try that next time.

A great basic frittata recipe. I made this for brunch with buttered toast and it was great. Next time I make this, I think I'll add cooked, crumbled sausage. The spinach idea sounds yummy too. Thanks for the recipe DonsSweety!
