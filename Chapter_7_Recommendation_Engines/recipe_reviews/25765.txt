We've made this recipe twice in the past week and have made a few changes but received rave reviews.  We used all crispy rice cereal and substituted the peanuts for shredded coconut.  We used half chocolate and half white chocolate chips and my grandmother added a stick of maragarine to the corn syrup mixture.  These were devoured in less than 24 hours.  Thanks

This was a very good, somewhat healthy, easy recipe.  The oat cereal, peanuts and peanut butter add nutrients and that is a plus in my book.  I used more cereal and less chocolate.  I also added 1/2 stick of butter to the corn syrup and used 1/2 cup less peanut butter.  I think this made it easier to mix.  The end result was a very good cereal bar.

I don't know what I did wrong, but it does not seem that 1 cup of corn syrup is enough; the mix did not glue together into bars!!  I created a trail mix instead!

Forget the kids, I thought these were yummy!! I would have liked to see them stick together a little better. Still made a nice bake sale item.

Delicious, but they don't stick together well at all!  Fortunately I don't mind the tendency to fall apart, but it makes them less than ideal for traveling (a bit too messy for a packed lunch).  Instead of 2 cups of peanuts I used half peanuts and half raisins.  And I didn't have any candy-coated chocolates, so I just used plain old chocolate chips.

I followed the recipe exactly and it give it 3 stars, but it has 5 star potential. I think it could be improved by reducing the amount of sugar and corn syrup and increasing the peanut butter. It is a fun and easy dessert.

This is the one recipe that I can count on when entertaining and children are expected. They love it, and so do the adults for that matter! It is easy and attractive. I use cheerios and M&M's. Thanks for the recipe!

Used half o cereal and half rice cereal. I used half amount of peanuts and substituted butterscotch and milk chocolate chips.  I substituted almond butter for the peanut butter to make it healthier. I left out the vanilla because why waste a good vanilla. Yummy for pot lucks and versatile too. Very forgiving.

These were delicious! The whole family loved them. Some things that I did differently: I added 3/4 stick of butter (other reviewers recommmeded addinga half or full stick, so I tried in between), and I let it chill in the fridge for a few minutes which seemed to help it set nice and firmly.

Very disappointed that the picture does not match the recipe at all! It shows a cookie made with oatmeal, which looks like a recipe I loved but lost. This recipe is a bar that I have made many times and is okay, but not my favorite.

Fabulous!  Added butterscotch chips instead of m&m's.
