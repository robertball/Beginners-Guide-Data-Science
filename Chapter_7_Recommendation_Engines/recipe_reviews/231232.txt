NEEDS EDITING TO BE 5 Star!! Otherwise it’s barely a 3. Simple tweaks. Nothing insane. I increase one extra can of soup. I like cream of mushroom. I also ad a regular sized can of medium rotel. That’s the key. The extra soup and rotel!! I also add a bit of garlic powder or you can even sauté your cubes chicken with some fresh mashed garlic before adding. Also important to add 2/3 of the cheese INSIDE the casserole and the rest on top. No good with it all in top. I also like cheddar Monterrey jack blend. Other wise this is soooo easy and the best for pot licks because even cooler it’s till relishes!

I often fix chicken by seasoning with salt, pepper and garlic and searing it in olive oil, then simmering in one can of cream of chicken, one can of cream of mushroom and a little water until very tender. I use leftovers in chicken pot pie and tried it in this dish as well. I also dislike canned chicken, and this is a good way to prepare one meal and prep for another.

Love this but it is a bit dry so I added an extra can of Cream of Chicken soup. I also added a can of Rotel for a bit of spice. That made it more moist, too!

This is a good start. I used 2 cans of broccoli and cheese soup and 1 can of cream of chicken, added about 3/4 cups half and half. Then I sauted some onion, yellow pepper and chopped garlic and added some peas to the sauce. It still could of used alittle more liquid.

I made this and honestly you need double the sauce and to add garlic salt to it to add flavor. It is bland and dry if you don't.

It turned out delicious! My kids and hubby loved it. I used southwest chicken and Mexican blend cheese. I'm glad I used the flavored chicken or there would not have been much flavor. I will probably add Tony's next time.

I loved this dish - but we also made some edits because I like my chicken spaghetti to be very creamy. I used half of the amount of called for pasta, added a 4-oz can of mushrooms (with liquid), and a can of Rotel tomatoes. I mixed half the cheese into the dish, and the other half for the top. This is a great base recipe to play with to your personal tastes / preferences, and allows you to use what you have in your pantry / refrigerator!

No changes. It is a great, highly flavored dish. Leftovers are great reheated.

Before I made this, I read all of the reviews for suggestions. As one reviewer wrote, I added an extra can of soup (2 cream of chicken, 1 cream of mushroom). I also used about 1/2 cup of broth (or some of the liquid when using canned chicken). I found that my first try was a bit dry, but the additional liquid was perfect. I also added some onion powder and a tiny bit of salt, but I may omit the salt next time. Overall, a great recipe--It seems that all I make is comfort food these days :)

I did not use canned chicken. I brined frozen chicken breast then cooked it in some butter, chopped and mixed it with the soup mix. I used one can if cream of mushroom and the other of chicken. I added a few splashes of chicken stock & one can of diced tomatoes(with juice). I also added the juices that i cooked the chicken in. After combining everything along with the spaghetti I topped with bread & then chedder cheese and baked for 15 minutes on 350°. It taste awesome!

Needed to try something new.  Amazing recipe!  I used spinach instead of green peas and added a bit of fresh onions.  My picky eater loved it.

I think this recipe needs to be updated. If you do not add extra liquid or read the reviews, this is not a memorable dish. :(

After reading the reviews you definitely want to use an extra can of soup(3 total) and add a can of  Rotel for flavor. I used left over baked chicken so it already had flavor but if you're using canned chicken(yuck sorry) then definitely add seasonings. It was a pretty good quick recipe. I mixed everything in the slow cooker and added garlic cheese.

So easy to make and the family has added this to our top 5 go-to meals!!! I used chicken tender strips instead of canned meat and seasoned to taste. Used 3 cans of cream of mushroom soup and 2 packets of Velveeta cheese sauce. Definitely will make it again as it was less than 30 minutes from cutting up the chicken to serving it! A working moms dream meal!!!

I enjoy this simple dish. I added a variety of mixed veggies to it though.
