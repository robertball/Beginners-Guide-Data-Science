I put this recipe in little custard cups, and it turned out wonderfully!  It doesn't set up as firm as baked custards, and it's not as heavy as a lot of similiar recipes are, and I liked that very much.  It also has about half the calories as many other recipes.  Overall, it was easy and very tasty.  This will become my favorite creme brulee recipe!

Easy to make and delicious.  Small problems: I used heavy cream, which apparently does not form bubbles around the edges, and I was not entirely clear on exactly what "coating the back of a metal spoon" really *means*.  (A temperature might have been helpful.)  But it turned out quite well anyway.  I'm guessing that the stovetop preparation of the custard resulted in it having a slightly more creamy, liquidy texture than other cremes brulee, but no one complained.  Minor quibbles aside, it was all in all a good recipe.

Very easy to make.. I noticed another reviewer didn't get bubbles.. she probably did but you need to stir it or lift the pot so that you can see the under the surface along the side of the pot.. that is where they form.. And using full cream makes this recipe waayyy more creamy.. all in all very good!

My friends and I tried this creme brulee recipe and, though it tasted good, the consistency was soupy and watery--- nothing like creme brulee!

Excellent! I had to use heavy cream because it is all I had, and it still came out wonderfully.  It may come out a bit runnier than it should be, but it still thickened, the top carmelized beautifully and it tastes yummy. Thanks for sharing!

This is slightly runny and not very creme brulee like.  I found it to be more like a whipped pudding than a thick custard that is creme brulee. It did not taste bad but, I would not make this again.

Overall this recipe was a success. The only problem I had with it was I used a rectangular glass pan instead of the usual little bowl-like dishes in which the dessert is usually served in. Therefore, my poor Creme Brulee was overdosed with an excessive amount of brown sugar, which I highly do not recommend.

It tasted like crême brulé, but its consistency was all wrong.  I used a double-boiler and cooked it to a point.  The mixture started getting lumpy before it coated the back of a metal spoon.  So in the end the base was lumpy and liquidy.

Also, the brown sugar broiled part did eventually brown in the oven, and form the proper crust, but the molasses tasted out of place.

Not all together bad.  I couldn't find light cream so I used half-and-half, probably not a good idea.  It tasted a little bit too much like egg.  It didn't seem to thicken as well as I think it should have either, might have been the cream I used.  I will probably try it again the overall taste is OK, just needs a little profection.

I used heavy whipping cream instead of light cream. I poured it into 4 custard cups and topped each with 1 Tablespoon of white sugar, which I browned with a torch. This recipe got RAVES from my guests.  It is so simple, but so elegant and delicious!

I tried this mainly to get rid of three eggs I had sitting around, and didn't want to fiddle around separating them and wasting the whites! Turned out kind of runny and almost like really really loose scrambled egg. Maybe the heat was too high when it was on the stove. Tastes ok though and I'll eat it myself over fruit for dessert. Probably won't try making this again - it's too finicky (for me) to get it thickened without scrambling the eggs. I LOVE creme brulee but I'll leave it to the restaurants to make and have it as a treat when I go out for dinner!

This recipe was much easier to make than I thought it would be and it was absolutely mouth watering. My boyfriend and I ate the entire dish in one day! We added sliced strawberries, white chocolate shavings and crumbled heath bar and it was the best dessert we have ever eaten!

The taste was really good, however I don't think it thinkened enough. I cooked it for about 30 minutes on the double boiler. When I first put the spoon in, the back was coated thinly. I suppose I didn't let it thicken anywhere near enoguh. The sugar on the top never browned, and the top layer cooked like an egg, so it was a little wierd. However, I want to try this again, letting it thicken more.

Was very excited to make this recipe, however was pretty disappointed with the flavor. It tastes ok as long as you have some of the melted brown sugar top, otherwise the custard is pretty bland by itself.

I made this twice and both times  it has turned out runny.   Both times I put them into small ramekins. The first time I made it and followed directions exactly and it was slightly thick cream.  If I put it in the square dish asked for, it would have been a single soup.  It had good flavor but didn't hold like typical creme brûlée I've made before.  

Second time this was made I double boiled it longer and ensured it was plenty thick.  About 15-20mins.  Came out slightly thicker.   The brown sugar gave it a good taste but sank slightly into the custard.
