Simple shrimp recipes are the best. This one is great as is and even simpler if you just cook to shrimp in a skillet. I'd melt the butter, add the garlic, then the shrimp, then toss in the parsley and finally add the cooked pasta to the pan. You could also add a cup of wine or some breadcrumbs if you wanted. To lighten it up, use less butter!

Wow. Made this tonite - lots of woofing and slurping. This recipe is definitely gourmet restaurant quality. I made just a few adjustments: I used 1/3 c of butter and 1/3 c of extra virgin olive oil and sauteed 1/2 of a large shallot (chopped) until tender in a large skillet on top of the stove. THEN,  I added the garlic (6 cloves -  do not brown), shrimp, lemon juice, parsley and 1 1/2 tsp of sea salt. At the end, I added a half a can of chicken broth to make more sauce. The broth really cut the oil and rounded out the flavor,leaving plenty of juice for the pasta to soak up. I used angel hair pasta instead of linguini. Just wonderful.....After the pasta was eaten, we dunked our focaccia bread in the extra sauce....

I made it in a skillet instead of the oven and substituted olive oil for some of the butter, and added a splash of white wine--very good!!

QUICK, EASY and GOOD!  I hate it when people totally change a recipe, but here I go....1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup chicken stock (to make sure all the pasta got coated with sauce), SIX cloves of garlic (and should have used 2 more), juice from 1 whole lemon, a small shake of red pepper flakes and most of a bottle of capers (These are the key!!).  This is a DELICIOUS base from which to jump!  Thank you for such a good, quick and very satisfying recipe!  My husband had 3rds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have made this recipe many times and think I have tweaked it to perfection. I cut the butter to 1/2 cup and add a 1/3 cup olive oil and 1/3 cup chicken broth. Double the lemon juice and add capers and some parmesan cheese at the end. Use angel hair pasta. This stuff is great.

Great easy recipe but giving it a 4 due to the changes I felt necessary.  Made a few adaptations because of the fat content.  Used 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, a touch of chicken broth and about 1/4 cup white wine.  Using good quality EVOO and white wine make all the difference.  Also, for flavouring added a few shakes of red chili pepper flakes, juice from a whole lemon, about double the asked for amount of parsley and 5 garlic cloves.   Will definitely make again.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because it is a really good start. You have to add and subtract to make it really tangy and not greasy, which shrimp scampi should be. The 3/4 cup butter is way too much. I used 1/2 cup and the pasta could still stand to lose another 1/4 cup. My pasta was swimming in butter and I used 16 ounces of pasta rather than the 12 ounces listed in the recipe. I also added double the lemon juice and crushed red pepper flakes to give it some heat. I liked baking the shrimp, it added a nice flavor. I'll be making this often. Thanks!

This meets all three of my criteria - easy, fast, and delicious! Per other reviews, I made some adjustments. I used 1/4 cup each of butter, olive oil, and white wime instead of 3/4 cup butter. Still, the pasta was a little dry, so I will increase the amounts a little bit next time. I also added some red pepper flakes, extra garlic, and some chopped up scallions. This is a keeper!

I made this in the skillet as well as many other reviews. I used 1/2 cup butter and a 1/4 cup E.V.O.O. And I used a 1/2 cup of white wine too. All in all this was good. I have made this a thousand and one times. And I will continue to make it!

This Recipe was very Tasty and Quick and Easy to
make!! I did tone down the garlic a little, I used 2 cloves instead of 4, that seemed to be
enough with out it being to garlicky, I also added
some parmesan cheese. I will make this recipe again! Thanks for a good one!!

If you've got some shrimp in the freezer and some pasta in the pantry you've got a meal. While not traditional in the classic dish, throw in some broccoli or other vegetables to make it nutritionally complete.  Easy enough as written, but I was hungry NOW, so I just simply sauteed the shrimp on the stovetop for a few minutes (with a mix of olive oil and butter).  The ingredients list seemed a little heavy on the butter, but I would recommend not measuring anything strictly - just add ingredients to your liking.

Everyone loved this dish.  I used angel hair instead of linguini.  Only gave 4 stars b/c I made modifications and I'm not sure if original recipe would have been as tasty.  I added (based on other reviewers suggestions) 1 bunch of parsley chopped, bottle of drained capers, and 1 t lemon zest;  changed following to 1/3 cup of each: butter, evoo, chicken broth, wine; used 6 cloves garlic, used juice of whole lemon. Was even better the next day!  Would definitely make this again.  May even try it with ziti and make it more of a casserole.

I BLEW my husband away with this recipe, and not to mention - myself!!!  It is quick and absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  The only thing I would change would be to add more butter or olive oil for more sauce - other than that, don't change a thing!

Great recipe. I went with the suggestion of 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup white wine along with the FULL 1/2 cup butter for plenty of sauce to soak up with bread. Definitely a keeper.

I don't normally eat seafood of any kind, simply because I don't like it. After trying this recipe, however, I changed my mind about shrimp (:

I made this for dinner for my husband's birthday and he pronounced it "restaurant quality".  However, I definitely had to tweak the basic recipe a bit.  I baked the shrimp in 1 cup butter (would use 1/2 c next time), 1/3 cup e.v.o.o. and 1/3 cup chicken broth (as suggested by another reviewer). I used 6 cloves of garlic and added salt, black pepper AND ground red pepper.  The salt, red pepper and MUCH more lemon juice than the recipe called for made ALL the difference! Before I made those changes just before serving, the sauce was just really greasy and lacking flavor. Even with the necessary changes, it was a very easy recipe overall.

This recipe was wonderfully easy and delicious. I made it for company and they loved it too.  I prepared it in a skillet instead of the oven.  Next time I will add more garlic and use angel hair pasta.  I am not a huge fan of linguine.  I have to say I will make this again and again.

I was not home in time to fix supper and I left the recipe for my hubby.  He is not a cook...at all...  He did a wonderful job.  They left me the last 6 pieces of shrimp in the dish and it was fabulous!!  Great job honey!!!!  And you said you couldn't cook;-]

Like another reviewer, I used 1/3 cup of olive oil and 1/3 cup of butter, and cooked in on top of the stove rather than in the oven.  The flavor is absolutely wonderful, and it's so easy to make.  Definitely a recipe that I'll use over and over.  Thanks!

Delish! I added a tbsp of olive oil and 2/3 cups of chicken broth to continue cooking the linguini in the sauce as suggested by another member. I also added a touch of lemon pepper as apposed to regular black pepper. It needed a bit of salt but with my additions it was easily 5 stars! I rate it a 3 1/2  without them.

I didn't love it, but I technically altered the recipe and used dried dill (didn't have the parsley), and frozen shrimp.  I was trying to find a recipe for the shrimp in my freezer when I came across this, but unfortunately, I just didn't like it.

This is a good recipe.  Im all for making quick and easy recipes for dinner. I only gave it 4 stars because I altered the recipe a little bit. After reading all of the review for this recipe, I added the following ingredients: instead of 3/4 cup of butter I used 1/2 cup of butter, 1/4  cup of olive oil and 1/4 cup of white wine.  I also used crushed red peppers, a little sprinkle of parmesan cheese while cooking and some after and instead of regular linguine I used thin linguine...After all of this, it turned out GOOD!

Excellent! I didn't have any linguine on hand so we used angel hair. Very easy and the shrimp were perfectly cooked.

I followed someone's suggestion to use 1/4c. extra virgin olive oil, 1/4c. butter and 1/4c. white wine.  It was very good.  Next time I think I might add button mushrooms and/or sundried tomatoes.  Thanks for the recipe.  Can't wait to show-off for company with this one!

This was a really good recipe.  I made it for Valentines Day and my boyfriend loved it.  The only thing I changed was I added some extra garlic.  This was really good and I will make it again.  I also added a slice of lemon on the top of it just to add a little something.  Made it look like it came from some expensive restaurant!

This is delicious!  I added red pepper flakes to give it a little kick, and next time will definitely add a little bit of chicken broth for more sauce.  Otherwise, very good!

Wow!  This was really good.  Everybody loved it.  We love garlic so I added a few more cloves.  Next time I think I will try and increase the lemon juice...just a little.  Served over rice, as we had linguine the night before.  Can't wait to make it again over linguine!  Definitely a keeper.  recommend you try it!

Loved this recipe!  My husband and I made the mistake of buying shrimp that weren't yet deveined so it took us almost an hour to get the shrimp prepared, if you don't have that much time buy shrimp with the veins already removed!  We had leftovers to eat for the next day, we melted a little extra butter with some garlic in it to add to the noodles because they had sucked up most of the garlic sauce overnight.  Great taste!

It was very good and quick to prepare.  Next time I'll use less butter (maybe 1/3 cup) and parsley, but besides that I really loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my boyfriend. He loved it. I love it too. I make it all the time now. I do use olive oil or any kind of oil and extra butter at the end. If you are looking for a good scampi this is it.

Fantastic recipe.  I did use some of the adjustments that some of the other reviewers did like the chicken broth.  It was awesome, my husband LOVED IT.  It was missing something, not sure what though.  I will figure it out next time. :)

This was absolutely delicious.  Made a couple of changes.  Made have margarine and oil (instead of butter).  Chopped some dried tomatoes with the garlic.  Also added a little bit of dried Lemon-Pepper spice.  This is wonderful for drop in company along with a salad and garlic french bread.  Innes

Tasty scampi recipe and very easy.  I used 2 pounds of jumbo shrimp (21/25ct), 1 lb of butter, a bit more fresh garlic and lemon juice.  Tossed with a pound of fettucine pasta and topped with some fresh coarse grated parmesan.  Served with cesaer salad and garlic bread for a great meal.  I found that I had to keep stirring the shrimp to make sure they cooked evenly without becoming over done.  I will make this again, maybe adding broccoli or asparagus for some color.

Delicious.I used one third butter, one third EVOO, and one third chicken broth, and it was plenty rich. I would consider using less butter/oil next time. Tossed some steamed broccoli in with the pasta to make a complete meal.

This was delicious and easy!  I used 1/2 a cup of butter and 1/4 cup of olive oil.  The sauce was so tasty, that next time I don't even need to add the shrimp.

This was so easy to make, and very tasty too! I served it whole wheat angel hair pasta instead of linguini. And to make it a touch healthier I used 1/2 cup garlic infused olive oil and 1/4 cup butter. I also used frozen shrimp so had to cook it longer. Makes a complete meal when served with a nice salad, garlic bread and parm cheese to top. Althought I must say it makes WAY too much. I served 8 people (4 adults, 4 children) with this recipe.

This was a very good, quick and easy recipe. I used a bit more garlic than the recipe calls for because our house loves garlic. I used about 6 cloves. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T. I will definitely be making this again. The shrimp took maybe 2-3 more minutes to cook than the recipe calls for, so check your shrimp before removing from the oven.

I added a little chopped red pepper as suggested by previous user, I would have wanted it to have a little stronger taste, but all in all it turned out good.

Excellent! My husband and I both loved it. I made a huge pot of it to freeze so that my husband won't starve while I am away next week. And he doesn't mind at all to eat it for dinner for the next week! The lemon added a tangy flavour which was really refreshing. I used a pre-cooked seafood mix instead of fresh shrimp but I baked it the same way the recipe instructed and it turned out beautiful. The butter was not too much for our taste-buds... I love butter ;)

I have made this recipe 3 or 4 times, and every time I do, my husband and I sit and think about our arteries clogging afterward.  It seems very rich..  Don't get me wrong, it is DELICIOUS!  I think I will try it with olive oil instead of the butter and see what that tastes like..

Wonderful!  My picky boyfriend loved it.  I will add more salt or maybe seafood seasonings to give a little more flavor and less butter.

Wow this was delicious.  My husband even used the extra sauce to drizzle onto his bread and eat as garlic bread.  My daughter asked for seconds.  It was super easy too!  I will definitely make more often.

This recipe was sooo good.  My family raved over it.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out great.  I served it with a cranberry walnut salad, garlic bread and oreo pie for dessert...yummy!

I made this tonight for my boyfriend it turned out great.  After reading some of the reviews I did use 5 tbs real butter and 1/3 cup Olive Oil.  Also added 1/2 can of chicken broth, a little red pepper flakes and used Angel Hair Pasta.  I cooked everything in a skillet. Before serving it I topped it with freshly grated parmesan cheese. I personally don't care for shrimp but I gotta tell ya it smelled amazing and my boyfriend loved it!

Very good simple shrimp and pasta dish. I used a skillet instead of the oven and it still turned out great. My only criticism is that the amount of "sauce" wasn't quite enough to coat the pasta. Next time I might try adding some vegetable stock.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. The only thing I did different was to replace the parsley with green onion since I had no parsley. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you Shannon for sharing.

Simple.  Always a hit with everyone who loves shrimp.  Don't change it, k.i.s.s. and it will be a crowd pleaser.  (Easy to double and triple, don't skimp on the butter.)

This was good, but I wasn't in love with it. I wish the sauce was a little thicker so it would hold to the pasta a little more. Instead of using just butter I did 1/2 a cup butter, 1/3 cup olive oil and added a little chicken broth as well. Nice flavor.

Made this for dinner the other night bit was a big hit.  Used 1/4C of butter, oil, white wine and ck broth after reading other rating. Also more than doubled the parsley. Will definitely make it again. Maybe with chicken next time.

I don't feel like I am giving a fair review because I didn't follow the instructions step by step. I, however, used all the ingredients listed but narrowed the usage of butter and added olive oil and chicken broth instead. I did this on the recommendation of another reviewer. The ingredients are very easy to find and are affordable. This is a very simple dish but I think I may have added too much olive oil in. I also thought it lacked in taste, despite the fact that I overloaded on the olive oil.

This meal was really good!   I followed the suggestion below of changing the amount of butter to 1/2 cup, 1/2 cup of EVOO, 1/2 cup of chicken stock (except I accidentally bought chick broth which turned out fine), I added red pepper flakes, capers, and a red bell peppers for color (place in with the shrimp so it can cook completely). I didn't put too much capers because I think it would have made the meal too salty.   Really good, and super duper easy!

I made some similar tweaks, like the other reviewers, but really - isn't that what cooking is all about??  The one addition I wanted to throw out there was artichoke hearts.  I happened to have some in my fridge and threw them in - they added a wonderful twist of flavor!  (Similar to the effects of the capers, I would assume.)  Yum, yum!!

This is a good recipe, but as written I felt that it was bland.  It was as though something was missing.  It may just be me but I feel the sauce needs to be played around with to make it of more substance - maybe adding cream or stock or flavouring would improve this dish.  Next time I have spare shrimp I will play around with this recipe again.

I made a lighter version as suggested by other reviewers. I decreased the butter, added the oil and added the chicken stock. I liked it. My hubby liked it but gave it a 3.5 because he would rather have had the original recipe

The only thing I changed was decreasing the amount of pasta to 8 oz. Excellent recipe.

An easy recipe for a very rich dish that my husband and daughter both seemed to like for Valentine's Day. I wouldn't serve this often because of the amount of butter, but for a special treat, it's great. Thanks!

This is the first time I've ever made shrimp scampi...definitely a nice and easy recipe (probably not so good for your heart though!). We made it in our frying pan, and that worked great too.

Excellent recipe.  I use a bit more garlic and lemon but we are garlic addicts in this house.

I thought about the missing ingredient everyone mentions. I did sprinkle some Old Bay seasoning on my shrimp.  I thought it turned out fine.

This recipe was good, but without any tinkering, it's definitely missing SOMETHING. Perhaps adding white wine. Probably will search for a new recipe next time.

I made this last night, I also added chicken broth, white wine and (EVVO oil). While it was good I was papared to give it 4 stars today, but I went home for lunch and heated the leftovers, and wow!!!! Maybe it was the infusion of sitting overnight but it was better than last night, I have change my mind 5 stars it is. Oh!!! I forgot I also topped my dish with parma
cheese. Thanks really good!!!.

The food turn out better than the pic you have. But this is not for the health conscience with the heavy use of butter.

I am reviewing this for my hubby. He prepared and ate the dish. He loved it and gave it a 5. I am allergic to seafood and had not pre-medicated so I steered clear of this on this go 'round. He loved it - thanks!

Mmm! I just used the scampi portion of the recipe and ate without pasta, and it's absolutely fantastic. The lemon really brightens the dish up. I also added just a few drizzles of white wine. I look forward to trying this again with pasta. Thanks so much - I've found my scampi!

Cooking this in the oven made it fast and easy. However, even with other reviewers changes, the flavor still was not there. I used the butter, olive oil and wine combination and added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, then topped it with parmesan cheese (that helped some). Still there is something missing, the flavor is just so so.

I would make this again but just for the scampi part.  The pasta look away from the flavor.

This was really good but I don't think I will add the basil next time. I thought it was a bit to overpowering. It made a nice amount of sauce.

We loved it.  My husband couldn't stop commenting on it all night.  I used angel hair instead of linguini for myself.  My husband just ate the shrimp w/out pasta as he is on the low carb diet.  I also used 1 TBL dried parsley instead of the fresh.  My husband added red pepper flakes to his and loved it.

This was pretty good except that it was REALLY heavy on the butter. If I make it again I will cut the butter/oil in half.

AWESOME!  I made this last night to accompany  broiled salmon and a simple salad for my date, we both positively loved it and he couldn't stop eating it!  I love garlic, fresh parsley and lemon so added more than the recipe called for,  used butter and extra virgin olive oil as the base and added about 1/4 cup of heavy cream at the end until just heated through. Excellent dish, will definitely add to the rotation.  Thanks Shannon!!!

This recipe was great.  I think next time I will buy shrimp that is already peeled and deveined, as that took my quite a long time to do.  My kids loved it too, which makes it a keeper!
