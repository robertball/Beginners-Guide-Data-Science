this is amazing fudge & foolproof regardless of reviews here... which i always read for all the gr8 help i get & saving myself many failures!!! i've made at least 15 batches of this & never a soft batch!!!! it has become one of the things my family insists doesn't get replaced when i do my Christmas baking for friends & family, something in our clan i'm famous for!!! i use holiday oreos & make sure to break by HAND & don't STIR in the cookies!!! JUST FOLLOW THE RECIPE!!!... then just press top cookies into fudge so u don't lose alot of them when cutting!!! those who reported soft fudge i'm sure when they do again they won't have a problem...might not have made quite hot enuff??

Recipe was easy to make and set up well.  However, the fudge had a terrible artificial taste.  Some of the kids liked it, but none of the adults could tolerate it.  We ended up throwing this out.

This recipe was awesome.  It tasted just like cookies and cream.  A few changes I made were using a few more oreos and also freezing it instead of just refrigerating it.  AWESOME recipe, i'll definitely be making it again.

this was really yummy! i didnt have any white chocolate chips so i used what i had (2c milk choc and 2/3c semi sweet). mine also took a little longer to set, but that didnt stop us from eating a little with a spoon while we waited :) next time i think im gonna try to coat whole oreos with the fudge mixture! thanks!

I also had problems with it setting up.  It was more like spoon fudge.  I used the cheaper hydrox cookies rather than Oreos.  Maybe that had something to do with it..

Oh my goodness. This was amazing. BUT it was almost sickenenly sweet. And I can tolerate  a LOT of sugar, but this actually made me sick, it was so rich with cream and sugar. A word of advice; EAT IN MODERATION!!!

I found this tasted very good and I didn't have a problem with the cookie bits staying on.  The only problem I did have was it setting. I made it at 10 in the morning and was finally able to cut it by 5 that evening but it was still too soft to retain any shape.  I'm not giving up yet though, I will try this again as this is my first time making fudge.

this fudge tastes just like the cookies and cream candy bar, one of my favorites since i do not like milk chocolate.  i recommend pressing the top layer of cookies lightly after pouring the chocolate mixture since the cookies pieces tend to fall off.  the only down side is, if you are not using premium white chocolate you do get that slight artificial taste...

Not bad but does not harden quite right. Have made other ways with better results. However, tastes great!

This really stuck to foil and I had a hard time cutting it.  I also had trouble with the cookie not really sticking to the top.  I think next time I will grease much better and maybe mix the oreo in the top better.  VERY TASTY!

This is delicious. It kind of reminds me of Hershey's Cookies n' Creme chocolate bar. I did make a few changes; instead of using vanilla chips, I used white chocolate. I was unable to find vanilla chips at the grocery store. I also didn't add additional oreo chips on the top. Spreading it around on the bottom was enough: especially since the oreos float to the top. All in all, it was delicious and I will be making this again!

I have been making this fudge for years.  My family loves it.  When my son was in cub scouts, he and his dad made it for a charity auction.  My son made my husband buy back their fudge!

This is a good recipe, but I think i would use some extra cookies next time (I like the oreo part better than the white chocolate) I had no problem getting the fudge to set. Very easy & my brothers referred to these as evil (in a good way).
