I scaled this down to 1 quart and found the sweet-tart level just about perfect.  The thing that I love about this recipe is that it doesn't call for a bunch of sugar (like most lemonade and limeade recipes do), so you really can taste the bright and fresh flavor of the lime.  This may be a bit too tart for some but, of course, that's easily remedied by adding more sugar (but not too much, please).  Thanks, hypermice, this was appreciated after four hours doing yard work in 90 degree weather.

I scaled this to one serving to test out. It was extremely sour. I can't recommend it without alterations.
