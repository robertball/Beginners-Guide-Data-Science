My family LOVES this recipe! Our kids even ask for it as it's a perfect spiciness for everyone.  Works great on round steak, roast, you name it!

Bit too heavy on the vinegar and it does not make enough marinate - so double the dose.  otherwise v. good.

What can I say.  We ate it, but did not eat the leftovers.  I did double the marinate as others suggested. This is heavy on the vingear but not in a good way.  Nope just isn't good.

This turned out wonderful tonight. Next time, like others have suggested, I'll double the marinade. I thought I had everything I needed, to find out I did not have the tomato sauce, so I measured out spagetti sauce....worked perfect. Grilled them on my George Forman grill, could not of been easier.

We could not eat this sauce. The meat tasted good but the sauce was not.

Well...it wasn't terrible.Meat was tender and good, the sauce was not so good. The lemon left a bitter flavor, we ate it, but I'll never make it again.

I added a cup of water and let simmer about 30 minutes longer.
