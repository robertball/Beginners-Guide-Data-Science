This was a fun recipe for me. Instead of using the traditional springform I went with one of my 10x12 pans because of making assorted cheesecakes in bar form for serving trays. I also chose to make my own graham cracker crust and tripled the cheesecake batter, what I really should have done (I'll know better next round) was also triple my small Granny Smith's, cinnamon & sugar and oats. While the flavor was there, because of my alterations, I didn't pack enough humph for that apple-y goodness (this was my opinion not my family's). The recipe is a keeper regardless of how I made it fit for what I was doing. The apples were seasoned nicely as my hubby and kids said, the crust was good. And the cheesecake was nice, firm and still creamy. I used a water bath method and when it started getting that golden color I needed. I turned off the oven without opening it and let sit in the oven an additional hour before removing. Not one crack or separation in my batch at all. Then I refrigerated over night and cut the next day. It was perfect as everyone that was sampling it said. It's a must try for sure.

Made this up yesterday!  
Very easy to do though I did do a couple things differently. 
I added a bit more cinnamon maybe close to double as I did not measure, as well as a lot more vanilla (I always do when recipe calls for it Love this stuff lol) so more like a good tablespoon or more lol. 
I also used different apples then suggested as I had a bunch to use up which is why I made this originally. I also made my own crust. I used a 10 inch spring form pan. 
This was easy to prep and put together. I followed the directions for cooking and it looked perfect when it came out. 
We haven't tried any yet as I am saving it for tonight for dessert!
I can't imagine it not tasting amazing! 
So far the only thing I would do differently is at least double the cream cheese part as I found it needed to be spread a bit to cover the entire top. A bit of the cinnamon mixture got caught up in it though I might not spread well lol

The original recipe didn't give a pan size, or at least I didn't see one. This would have been better in an 8x8 or 9x9 pan.

I made this recipe as written. I decided to cook it all in the premade pie crust. Watch it closely, because it can burn quickly.  Not a very sweet dessert which was perfect. Topped it with some whip cream!

This is a delightful recipe that combines two of our favorite desserts,  apple crisp and cheesecake.  I made them in individual cheesecake  spring form pans, double the amount of apples and topped it with a little whipped cream.    We loved it.

I usually make a desert with apples for Thanksgiving for my family to enjoy and have made several from here. This one was a big hit! Everyone loved It! Thanks for the great idea.

I made this as written, except for doubling the apples, as the ones I had were small. The apple and the cheesecake taste great. I'm not sure what happened with the oatmeal, but it looks and tastes raw. I will try this again with tweaks.
