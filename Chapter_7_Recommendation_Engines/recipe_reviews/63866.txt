I got this recipe from a magazine and love it!  

The version I have varies slightly, adding 2 tsps ground coriander, 4 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp salt to the first step.  Then add another 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsps black pepper and finely grated peel of 2 lemons to the dressing.

I think this gives it much more flavor.  Will definitely make again!

I made my own recipe using the first 6 ingredients minus the chicken. I mix everything together and simmer in a small pot. Delish!

I omitted the red pepper and I added lime juice instead of lemon juice. I also added a Tbsp of crushed garlic and fresh cilantro. We served it on a wheat pita. Very, very good.

It wasn't what I thought it would be.  It needed a little more onions and maybe some more cumin.  I didn't enjoy it like I thought I would.  I probably would make it again but would definately give it a little more flair.

not good. Way too many beans- overall just not worth it.
