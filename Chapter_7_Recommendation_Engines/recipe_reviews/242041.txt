I had some Colby jack on hand and made this. I used most of the same ingredients and tweaked it with some old bay. My husband loved it and ate them up really quick!

Delicious! I did have issues with them melting before they browned enough, but I'm gonna play around with it a bit and maybe freeze the cheese cubes first before coating and frying. The coating is so tasty and the combo w/ that and the creamy cheese is really fantastic. I will def be making these again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)
