I don’t use a bread machine, so I proofed the yeast in 110º water, and completed the dough in my Kitchen Aid mixer.  To dress up the bread slightly, I put a light egg wash on the top so I could sprinkle a little oats and baked the bread at 350º for 35 minutes.  The bread was very nice, with good flavor and texture.  I’m looking forward to toasting it for breakfast.

This is my favorite bread to make in my machine. After reading other reviews I made a couple of changes for my taste. I add 1/4 cup brown sugar and an egg, use whatever juice I have on hand (have used pineapple, apple and orange) instead of water, and add 1/2 tsp allspice. I throw in a handful of walnuts with the cranberries. It is now the most requested bread in my household. The bread does dry out kinda quick but thats ok because it also makes the best bread pudding you'll ever taste!

Great Bread.  This was the first recipe we made in our new Bread Machine and it turned out great!  Really chewy, and delicious.

I make this in a bread machine. Comes out delicious every time! One of the best breads I've ever made! I like putting a generous handful of thin sliced almonds in the mix. I multiplied the batch by 1.5 and it worked great on the 2/2.5 LB loaf setting on our machine!

Excellent bread!  I followed directions exactly except for replacing 1 cup of flour with whole wheat flour.  I do not like the way my bread machine bakes so I removed the bread, placed in greased loaf pan and baked at 350 for 35 min.  Next time I will loosely cover with foil as the top is a little more brown than my children like.  Overall this is a great recipe!  Might try with fresh cranberries too.

This is a very good bread recipe. I have made it 3 times in 2 weeks. First time made it exactly as stated and we loved it. second time added walnuts and wow my favorite, third time i used raisins and walnuts as i didnt have cranberrys still a keeper. i love the texture of the bread and of course the flavor. it is great to eat plain or with cream cheese on top. it stays fresh tasting longer than other breads i have tried. i highly recommend you try this recipe.

I followed the posted advice of replacing the water with fruit juice, added brown sugar, pie spice, and added a handful of almond slivers.  It was scrumptious!  Will definitely do again.

The bread was very good, but I found it just a tad on the dense & heavy side. I liked it, it was rather easy to assemble in the bread machine, will make again, possibly a little less flour. But over all I liked the tang of the cranberries.

This is the best bread maker recipe I have ever made. The bread is wonderful and very tasty. I’ve made 3 times in the last
Month and it’s always a hit. A little butter with coffee in the morning also makes it a great breakfast bread. A definite 5 stars!

The instructions that came with my bread maker say to wait for a beep, which is 5 minutes before the end of the first knead to add raisins and nuts. The picture shows the bottom of the loaf. However, it smelled and tasted so good, I can hardly wait to try again, but put the craisins and nuts in sooner. I expect I will be updating my rating.

I followed the recipe and the dough was really watery, unlike my other bread recipes. Afraid it wouldn't even form, I ended up adding an additional 1 cup of flour to it and turned out just the way I wanted it to be.  Not sure how it'd turn out if I had followed the recipe to the dot. Will attempt next time.
Also didnt have enough bread flour so half of my flour measurements were plain flour.

Good and easy recipe for cranberry bread. My Husband likes this kind and I cannot find it always in the supermarket - so decided to do it myself. Comes out just the right  size, but would bake it on "light" settings not the default "medium".

I made this wonderful bread in my bread machine on a cold, snowy day.  Instead of a cup of water, I used pineapple juice and I beat one egg in with the liquid ingredients (juice, honey and butter) which made it not as dense.  Like another reviewer, I added the whole bag of cranberries.  It was so delicious and made a great addition to a big pot of beef stew.  Just the perfect combination on a winter day.  I will definitely make this recipe again.
