I adjusted the recipe for 17 people for a work pot-luck. I used a little less mustard and a little more BBQ sauce. And 3 packages of Little Smokies instead of franks. I also put them in a crock pot to slow cook for the 4 hours leading up to lunch. It was a hit! Everyone loved them! I came home with an empty pot!

Kiddos really liked this one. I used Nathans hot dogs Sweet Baby Rays BBq sauce and used Frenches yellow mustard instead of dry mustard. Easy and quick. Thanks!

You really have to like mustard & bbq sauce to enjoy this. I think the amount of mustard was a little overwhelming but I didn't let the flavors marry before eating either. Good easy summer lunch thanks Sheila.

This is just hot dogs in baked beans. It gets a two because I like hot dogs and I like baked beans. If you are looking for something special this isn't it.

Started these with Sandys baked beans from this site and they were a tad sweet but the dry mustard took care of that. I actually fried my hotdogs to brown them a little bit and then added the baked beans bbq sauce and mustard.

Boy did my kids love "Hot Dog Soup". The mustard and BBQ (I used Ting Tang BBQ sauce from this site) sauce added a little umph to please the adults too. Quick easy but a lot better than Pork n Beans from a can. Thanks!

It's ok. Not a gourmet meal. But it is quite good for a very quick and easy meal on the table in 15 minutes.

This was a hit! Even with our six-year-old who normally won't eat beans; he gobbled it up and asked for the leftovers for his school lunch the next day! I substituted prepared mustard for dry but otherwise kept it the same. Yumm!

Like that it have a starting point. I already had soaked and cooked pinto beans. Cooked my bacon and threw in my Bar S dogs. I really had no idea what to do with my beans so this is awesome and family friendly.

Yummy I love lips and butts in the summer heat. It helps take the edge off after a long day.

I made this for my husband but was disappointed. He said the taste was good but that it was way too sweet.

I used 16 franks and two large cans of beans. more barbecue sauce and more dry mustard -- Put it in my crock pot and took it to the church supper. It was very good and all was eaten and yes I will make it again.
