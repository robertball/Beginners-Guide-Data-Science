Yummy!
I changed it a little...I drained the water from the squash after cooking it, then I mixed in half a can of Rotel tomatoes & gr. chiles, then put in the cream cheese, melted it for a little bit, then added shredded sharp cheddar.  Wow.  It is good.

I knew from looking at the ingredients this had the potential for a great recipe.  I was right. It is delicious.  I used two smaller crookneck squash, 4oz of cream cheese, garlic powder and fresh basil from the garden.  I cooked the squash in the microwave 5 1/2 minutes, cubed the cheese over it and let it set about three minutes, sprinkled on a dash or two of garlic, put in some fresh basil to taste and salt.  It was absolutely divine!!!!

This recipe is awesome if you want a quick, satisfying side dish or an easy dish to serve at a party (just scale it up).  I made it delicious and fairly healthy by sauteeing the squash and garlic for a few minutes in a small amount of butter, removing from heat and adding a good amount of chopped fresh basil and then adding 1-2 servings of reduced fat cream cheese before microwaving to melt the cheese.  A small amount of cream cheese goes a long way and you can reduce the fat to 3-6 grams per serving with my modification.  Fresh basil is essential for a "wow".

This recipe was wonderful! However, I sauteed the onion and garlic in a skillet, added the squash and used fresh minced basil instead of dried. Definitely a keeper!

Awesome recipe!  I couldn't stop eating it!  I pan fried the squash and there was no liquid to drain off.  I used fresh basil instead of dried, and only 1/2 a pkg of cream cheese and it was so very very yummy and so easy to do!  This is the way I'll do my summer squash from now on.  Thank you!

This was very good!  The only thing I do differently:  I make it for one serving. I take two squash (about 6 oz) sprinkel with salt and basil, micro for about two minutes, DRAIN and stir in 1 tbsp fat free cream cheese.  I eat this almost everyday as a snack in the afternoon. Excellent, thanks for sharing!

This was an excellent recipe. I used 4 cloves of garlic (we really love garlic in this house) and microwaved the squash as directed.  I took the advise of some other reviewers and drained the cooked squash well after it was done.  I added some sauted onions with the cheese, and only used half the amount of cheese.  I also used Neufchatel instead of full-fat cream cheese, and fresh basil instead of dried.  This was wonderful and my husband and I gobbled it up.  I'm going to go and buy more squash so I can use up the rest of the cheese.  Great recipe!

I love recipes that don't require measuring. You can easily tailor this recipe to whatever you have on hand. 

After the squash cooked for 5 minutes, I drained off the liquid, added some cubed cream cheese (about 3 oz.), fresh basil and shredded extra sharp cheddar. Then I microwaved it for another minute. Next time I will mix the basil with the squash before topping with the cheeses, and I'll add more garlic. Those garlicky bites were especially delicious! I might also try it with tomatoes or only tomatoes.

I buy a lot of yellow squash in an attempt to eat healthier and it always sits unused. This recipe has changed that. I made it and ate most of it in one afternoon! I cooked the squash in a pan with spray and used 1/3 fat cream cheese and half the amount. I also used fresh basil.It was delicious!!

Wow!!  Excellent recipe; best squash I've ever had.  Even my picky 4 year old loved it!  I did not microwave.  Instead I pan fried 1 large squash, dried basil, 4 cloves garlic, (I also added minced onion, salt, and pepper.)  I added cream cheese last.  So fragrant while cooking and tasted just as great!  Thanks for the recipe!

Spoon this mixture into mini-phyllo cups, and top with shredded parmesan. Broil and voila: fancy, healthy appetizers for a party!  I added fresh basil leaves and a bit of heavy cream instead of all of the cream cheese.

I was skeptical even as I was putting this together, but it actually was very tasty. It doesn't look very pretty but my 1 year old really enjoyed it, and was a great way to get him to eat his squash. I used reduced fat garden vegetable cream cheese in place of regular and I think that gave it more flavor, also I added 1/2 a TB fresh basil in place of the dried. I also crumbled some whole wheat ritz crackers in with it for some texture.

This was just great, I made it tonight with two different squash, patty-pan  and zucchini.  I did use less cream cheese about 4 oz and 5 squash.  It was really really good.  Do try it, I also added a bit of red pepper flakes because we use it is most everything.

I wasn't totally impressed with the appearance of this recipe, but the taste was very impressive.  Yes, I would use less cream cheese next time.  I sauteed thinly sliced onion along with the squash and melted the cream cheese separately, smoothing it with chicken broth.  I used dried basil in the squash saute, and fresh for the garnish.  Oh.. added a splash of balsamic vinegar to the squash and onion mixture, too.  A nice way to add some flavor to a bland vegetable.

I microwaved an acorn squash which I'd pierced and wrapped in saran for about eight minutes.The sauce I made was composed of 2-3 oz. of cream cheese to which I added 3 large food processed cloves of Garlic and three or four tablespoons of Classico Pesto Sauce (green).I microwaved this for about 30 seconds and filled in the seeded halves of the squash with the mixture..A little salt and Voila!  It really Was good and I don't even like squash!-well I do now....

I had to cook the squash for a longer time and it still was not soft but firm. The anti-veggie bunch I have still would not even try it. It was ok for me. I will have to try some other way of cooking squash.

When I first made it I felt that it was a bit rich and my husband was not crazy for the cream cheese.  So, I switched the cream cheese with sour cream (and only used maybe a 1/2 a cup) and I think it made it a little less rich.  I also used a  1/3 cup of mozzarella cheese for a little flavor and it became a hit with the family.  Next I'm trying it with fresh basil to see how it adds to the flavor.

Fantastic.  Followed the suggestions of sauteing instead of microwaving, half the cream cheese, and fresh basil and it turned out wonderful.  Definately a good building block recipe to add other ingredients to.  And the best part was how quick and easy this is to make.

This became a 5-star review for the following reasons.....we bumped up the garlic to 3 cloves and used an Italian Seasoning Salt. We also, as suggested by other reviewers, drained the liquid before adding cream cheese(to cut the calories, we used a 1/3 less fat cream cheese).  This was incredibly easy and friggin' awesome; it will be something we will make again and again as both a side dish or a main dish on those simple late nights.

Sorry, but this recipe bombed.  Cooked for only 6 minutes, squash was mushy which caused the entire dish to be watery & unedible.

Squash for squash haters!  A friend gave me a huge bag of crookneck squash from her garden; although normally I wouldn't touch the stuff I didn't want to hurt her feelings, so I started looking for a recipe I might enjoy.  This recipe is made for those of you who, like me, can't stand yellow squash, but only of you get the texture right.  I decided to forgo the microwave and I made this in a frying pan.  I started with a small chopped onion and doubled the garlic.  I sautéed it all in butter until crisp-tender, then added the cheese.  There is no need to drain.  Like others recommended, I cut the cream cheese in half and used at least 2 TBLS fresh basil, added right at the end.  I absolutely loved it!  Everyone at the table did.  The dish pairs especially well with grilled chicken, and is just as good the second day...if you have any left.

Good! A fraction of the cream cheese, though, and it would be better! Just enough to coat the veggies is all that it takes. Would also be good with other garden veggies added...bell peppers, onions.....

We are over run with yellow squash and have fried, boiled, baked, grilled, casseroled it to death.  My family wanted something different and this fit the bill.  No one complained that squash was on the plate again.  Thank you for something new!  Confession:  I upped the garlic to four cloves as we are all garlic fans.

I don't know if I did something wrong but this was just too bland for me.  

I think next time I will add even more basil and perhaps some red pepper, garlic, or even use garlic and onion cream cheese.

Drained the squash and cut the cream cheese in half. Nice change from the sauteed squash we usually eat.  Will be using this recipe frequently.

I love cream cheese and since I have been trying to eat healthier at night I thought I would give this a try. I followed some of the other recommendations and drained the excess water. I also added in a little of a four cheese blend. It was great! I will definitely make this again.

This is the easiest squash recipe ever!  And it's delicious!  What more could you want?  Only change I make in the recipe is to take the suggestion from another reviewer and add one can or Rotel tomatoes for spice.  I have even made it and frozen it for later.  (We have lots of squash in the garden.)  Will continue to make often!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I loved this; my husband hated it. Go figure. Such an easy side dish to make.  My only change would be to really stress that you have to drain the squash before adding the cream cheese -- otherwise it looks soupy.

There was way too much cream cheese. I made it several times and every time I used less cream cheese. I think 1/2 the amount is good.

Delicious!!  I used the whole block of cream cheese, but 1/2 would have been sufficient.  The whole thing was a lot creamier and bad for me though!!  Very tasty - thanks!!

It was good but I don't think I'll make this again.  I prefer squash to be more sweet (with brown sugar for example) and this recipe was more savoury.

I seasoned crookedneck squash with garlic salt and basil, then sautéed with water and a tbsp olive oil for 6 min until tender.  I then added two heaping spoons of whipped cream cheese and mixed till melted. My 2 year old daughter loved it and I can't get her to eat any vegetables.

OMG! This is amazing! I did it stove top because I had the time. Sauteed patty pan, pumpkin, onion and garlic, threw in dried basil, added 2 tbsp Roka Blue cream cheese, seasoned with Himalayan salt...home run!

I did not use basil but I did use dill and lemon pepper and it was awesome. I also cut the cream cheese down to four ounces instead of eight, we don't eat a lot of dairy so that was plenty for our needs. I baked it in the oven at 350 stirring every 10 minutes for 30 minutes.

My husband and I loved this.  We were a little nervous when we saw it, but it was sooo tasty.  DELICIOUS!!  I too used only 1/2 the cream cheese and pour out some of the excess water.  I used dried basil (1/4-1/2 of what the recipe said) and it was perfect.

Awesome!!  Took a bunch of suggestions and sauteed the squash and garlic(added extra) in butter, used 4oz cream cheese and fresh basil.  My squash didn't give off much water, so I added a bit to make more of a sauce and it was great.  Hubby loved it and tried to swipe mine from my plate! Thanks for a great easy recipe.

Oops. I missed the basil. Oh well, I'm not a huge basil fan anyways.  I used what I had in the house, just a small bit of zucchini squash.  I too decided to sautee the squash along with one clove of pressed garlic.  Once it was sauteed, I added a small amount of cream cheese along with a tiny handful of shredded parmesan cheese and I added fresh ground sea salt and fresh ground pepper.  This was pretty darn good!  I had no idea that zucchini and cream cheese went so well together!

This was ok.  But then, I used fat-free cream cheese and it wouldn't melt all the way. (rolling my eyes)  Anyway, some day I will try it with real cream cheese.  I am sure it will be better that way.

I'm sure many love this recipe, but I was not impressed. I've tried two different variations, and both of them were about as appealing as my big fat butt. If you have a garden and use your first prized yellow squash, don't use it on this or you will be severely disappointed, but that's just me~
