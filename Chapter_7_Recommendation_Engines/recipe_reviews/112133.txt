It was okay.  If you intend on saving the leftovers do not use flax seeds because they make the dressing turn phlemmy after a while.

This is really good if you just steam the broccoli very, very briefly (not till it's soft). My family loved it last Thanksgiving and asked me to make it again.

The flax seeds put me off, to me they are for cereal and baking!  I added sunflower and sesame seeds, and also slivered almonds...lots of crunch.  Also have used olive oil instead of mayo which is tasty as well.

Love, love, love this idea!!!  I could not find Raspberry Vinegar.  I decided on "Smucker's Simply FRUIT Seedless Blackberry", no flax seed and dried cherries.  I did not use the sugar or vinegar.  I did use the mayonaise.  WOW!!!!  My family went on and on about this dish and I fell in love as well.

I have spent the majority of my life as a vegetarian and don't usually see any meat dishes that I crave, except for Brocolli Salad. I LOVE brocolli and was very happy to find this vegetarian version of it. This recipe works great as listed, but since I have made it several times, I have tried changing it up. One thing I do is roast the pecans before adding them to the salad and it really improves an already fantastic dish. Also, I have been reading a lot about the benefits of chia seeds, so I add them in this dish as well and you really can't taste them, but I like knowing it ups the nutritional value of the salad. Most recently, I used Balsalmic vinegar rather than raspberry and there was a subtle difference. The Balsalmic felt a little more grown up, but I tend to feel that way about Balsalmic vs. other vinegars, so I could just be biased. 
Great salad even without any additional modifications, though. Thanks so much for posting!

This was ok. I'm not a big broccoli fan myself, so I put extra cranberries. Also, instead of Mayo, I put Miracle Wip, to add to the taste of Vinegar. Overall, a good, healthy salad.

I HAVE MADE THIS RECIPE SEVERAL TIMES AND HUBBIE AND I LOVE IT! I HAD BALSAMIC VINEGAR AND USED THAT. TOASTED SUNFLOWER SEEDS AND PUMPKIN SEEDS FOR THE NUT ADDITION. I DOUBLED THE DRESSING IT ADDED MORE FLAVOR AND LESS DRYNESS. OTHERWISE THE RECIPE WAS AS WRITTEN. I THINK READING THE REVIEWS FIRST BEFORE MAKING THE RECIPE ON ALL SITES HELPS TO GET THE TRUE TASTE AND FEELING OF THE RECIPE GIVEN!

My usual Broccoli Salad uses bacon so this was a departure for us.  I skipped the flax seeds as they tend to get gummy if not eaten immediately and I made this to have for lunches during the week so that was an issue for us.  BUT...we did really like this salad which is kind of tart with the raspberry vinegar.  We loved the addition of the pepitas (pumpkin seeds).  A nice change from the ordinary and a little more healthy than the bacon-y version.

I did half  mayonnaise and half  plain goat yogurt. I used honey in place of the sugar. I use 1 tablespoon raspberry vinegar, 1 tablespoon raspberry vinaigrette dressing. It was all gone, but one small bowl,  I wish I had more for leftovers.

This is delicious.  Tired of bland vegetables at dinner, I went in search of something different when I stumbled upon this recipe. I used raspberry vinaigrette dressing with a little apple cider vinegar as I didn't have raspberry vinegar, and it worked great. My twelve-year old son really liked it--he had seconds. I'm guessing a large head of fresh broccoli crowns is about the right amount. I didn't measure, but it seemed to be the right ratio to dressing. I will definitely make this again soon.

I didn't have raspberry vinegar so I just added a bit of raspberry jam to regular vinegar.  Used chia seeds because I had them.  Everyone loved it, I will be making this again and again.!

The only changes I made were leaving out the flax seeds, and pecans but it was still great! Even the kid who avoids broccoli salad loved it!

Mmm! Lazier and healthier adaptations. I didn't bother steaming broccoli. For the dressing I swapped yogurt for mayo and agave syrup for sugar. Topped with a bit of feta and enjoyed two helpings!
