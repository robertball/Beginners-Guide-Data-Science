This was a huge hit. 8 people devoured over 1lb of prawns in a matter of minutes. They raved about the dipping sauce too.   The marinated has a lot of lime juice. This tends to cook the prawns like ceviche. Then after grilling they were a little tough. I am not sure that this part worked as well as I would have liked. Maybe some wine and zest would be better. I will test this approach next time.   They cook very quickly under the broiler so keep a close eye on they or you will over cook the prawns.   I didn't strain the dipping sauce. I simply reduced it until I got a consistency I liked. I also used Serrano instead of jalapeno.   Skewering the prawns was a little tricky. I am not sure if I did it as intended but it came out well. Next time I will take a picture and add it tot he recipe.

I only marinated mine for 15 minutes so as not to become tough because after that the cooking process will begin in the marinade before it even makes it to the oven. The shrimp picked up all the good flavors in that amount of time.  Also, I added a bit more sugar and vinegar to the sauce according to our liking. I didn't discard liquid. You may want to remove white membrane inside pepper if you don't like so much heat. A few things to work out yet an over-all good dish, but preferably with these changes (for us.)

I made this for my husband tonight and he really enjoyed it. The next time I make this recipe I think that I will use maybe half a jalape√±o instead of the whole thing because it ended up being a little too spicy for me, but overall the raspberry dipping sauce was awesome and really made the meal.
