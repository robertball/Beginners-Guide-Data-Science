This recipe is a great idea with tons of potential!  It was good with prosucitto and brie, but next time I will use thicker ham and swiss cheese (plus pound out the chicken just a little).  The first couple I made, I didn't seal quite good enough, so most of the cheese came out, my last couple were nicely sealed tho.  Beautiful presentation!

To help a litle with the fat content I poached the chicken instead of frying it.  For 4 breasts I boiled 4 cups of water and a cup of wine, with some herbs, carrots, onions and celery for about 6 minutes, then let it stand covered for about 20.  The chicken was so tender and flavorful, plus I had a great chicken stock for later.

This dish truly lacked something; maybe some cranberries or anything to give the meal some FLAVOR.  The recipe did not call for any seasonings, therefore the chicken was very bland.  I was pleased, however, at how easy and quickly it all came together.

I made this recipe last week one night when it was late and I didn't feel like cooking a big dinner. What a hit! It was yummy, quick and filling! In fact I registered as a user just so I could post this review and tell everyone how good it is!!

I found that I needed extra cresent roll dough.  The taste is great and even my one year old ate it.  I would not suggest microwaving leftovers.  I would put in the toaster oven or standerd oven to re-heat.

This recipe was just OK for me. The flavor was good but it was very hard to eat. I recommend cubing up the chicken breasts before folding the dough around it. This will make it so much easier to eat.

SOOO good! my mom and I really don't like chicken cordon bleu but this sounded so good i just had to try it. everything blends very well and nothing stick out. however i did make one change that i feel was necessary. I sauted the chicken with some butter, olive oil, garlic, italian seasonings, and salt and pepper. It definitely made the dish to have that flavor added. This was seriously one of those dishes that you bite into and freak out about how good it tastes! PERFECT!  (also i didn't use the sauce but the chicken itself was already very juicy so it didn't matter.)

Ok, I hate people that do this but the base/idea of this recipe is good and I had to use different ingredients to use what I have. I used garlic butter crescent rolls, bacon and mozzerella cheese. I cooked the chicken in italian dressing and crisped the bacon first. So tasty!

I made this for a girlfriend and myself when our husbands were out of town.  We loved it!  I used feta cheese as my budget doesn't allow for brie and used twice the crescent roll dough called for.  Not exactly a low calorie recipe, but worth the extra sit ups!

I followed this recipe to the letter.  It was salty and lacked any taste of interest.  Perhaps grilling the chicken as opposed to frying would help, but I won't make this again.

Well, I don't know what to say other than these were just okay.  I love all of the ingredients that go into this recipe, and I also have similar prosciutto/chicken/cheese recipes that my family can't get enough of.  But I made these a few days ago and there were plenty of leftovers that still have not been eaten.  It wasn't a bad recipe, it just wasn't one of those meals that my family got excited about.  I don't think I'll make these again.

I followed the recipe exactly and did not like this.  All I could taste was the oil from cooking the chicken (even though I only used 1 tablespoon as stated.)  Maybe it was just me.  Thanks anyway!

This was pretty good. I used Swiss cheese instead of Brie but they still tasted good. It was a little difficult to wrap the chicken so it didn't look like a mess, but besides that these tasted good and my family enjoyed them. I would make them again.

This was good and very easy to make, it just appears to miss something.  Mabe this needs a cream sauce.

This dish is now a classic in our house. This is my wife's favorite dish for me to cook and she's not easy to impress! The prosciutto and Brie give this comfort food a gourmet taste.

This was very a very pleasing meal. My changes were to use puff pastry, I sauted the spinach first with 1 tsp chopped garlic, and I steamed the chicken breasts, (after pounding them with my tenderizer), in white wine for a few minutes.  I baked longer, for about 30 minutes. My husband really loved it!

This recipe presented like gourmet but was easy to do. I only used one triangle for each bundle, also I used precooked chicken breast(that made it easier to prepare) and feta/cooper cheese and added spinach. . Anything could be placed with the chicken depending on your taste. It took 15 minutes to prepare and 15 minutes to cook(using the precooked chicken)

This recipe was great! I made it for a dinner party and got rave reviews. You can always alter the recipe to fit anyone's taste, such as using different types of cheeses, ham for the meat, etc. The only thing that I changed was to use two rolls of the dough instead of one. The one roll only fit three of the bundles, so I needed to use one more to make the fourth one. I also trimmed the chicken so that it fit into the bundle. 
Very delicious!

I'm glad I made this BEFORE I looked at the fat content! ;-)  I made this dish one night when we were having dinner guests and it was a big hit.   Fresh cranberries really added a great touch.  Any type of cranberry relish or fruit salsa would probably do very well with this recipe.  

I like this dish because it can be altered to fit individual tastes and budgets;  I think next time I will experiment with a little seasoning on the chicken.  I like hearing how others have altered this recipe!

Eating this dish made me feel like a queen.
You must use the Bearnaise for the truly deluxe feeling.  The prosciutto can run a bit pricey, but its worth this delicious meal.

Thank you for all of your compliments and suggestions. You'll note I've had the recipe changed to 2 tsp olive oil - I never use vegetable oil (and never that much!!) Alternatively, you could cook the chicken in a skillet coated with fat-free cooking spray. As for the dough, I find one unrolled triangle of the large crescents cut in HALF does the trick - you just need to stick the two halves into a square and then fiddle with it to make sure the bundle is completely closed. Phyllo may also work for this recipe, but I haven't tried it yet. Cheers! BH

I really like this recipe.  Here are some issues I had as well as things I would try differently next time.  Other reviewers said it was too oily so I boiled the chicken and this worked wonderfully.  I also tried using the full rectangle of dough instead of the triangles.  This worked, but they ended up being huge.  I think next time I would chop the chicken so that I could customize how much chicken to put in depending on what size of dough I was using.  Also, Brie cheese was too expensive for me so I used mozzarella.  It was ok but I think next time I will try ricotta or something similar.  I might even try putting a couple spoonfuls of cream of chicken soup.  I was worried that the spinach might be too strong tasting but it was very mild.  Overall I really liked this recipe and there is a lot of room to play around with it and make it the way you like it.  It was a recipe that looked like it took more work than it did.

I took the advice from other reviews and tweaked it: cut the chicken smaller, used 1 teaspoon pesto and 1/2 teaspoon grated parmesan cheese.  Will try with veggies again!  Great base recipe!

Like others, I used the base idea and ingredients I had on hand.  (Swiss Cheese ) My Wife and I loved it and it is a great "Quick & Easy" time saver. Thank you!

This dish turned out delicious! The only changes I made were that I added some seasoning to the sauce it self( a little poultry, garlic and pepper). Once I got into the swing of rolling this all up, it really was quite easy. Taste was perfect. My husband and 6 year old both loved it. And I was able to get them both to eat some spinach so another plus!

My hubby is extremely picky and dislikes spinach. So, I omitted the spinach and brie is too expensive. So, my ingredients consisted of cream of chicken soup mixed with cream of mushroom soup, bacon, Italian blend shredded cheese, chicken breasts and of course the large crescent rolls. Baked @ 375 x 12 mins. Served with roasted red potatoes and green beans as sides. Yummy, definitely saved recipe.

My hubby really liked these.  I cut each each breast into 3 then cooked with salt and pepper.  Next time I will use bacon instead of procettio, since my hubby prefers it.  I also used homemade cresent roll dough from this site.  Will make again!

Good base recipe but needs extra love. Seasoning added, and finished with a bernaise sauce modified with whole grain dijon mustard and white wine. Used ham and swiss, turned out great:)

I cut the chicken breasts into bite sized pieces. Then I sauted them in olive oil and added salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, basil and oregano.  I laid out the crescent rolls, put on three slices of brie cheese, ripped up the spinach and put that on, diced up some deli ham and added that to the pile, and finally added the sauted chicken.  When closing the crescent rolls, make sure all seams are pinched together.  Then pick up opposite corners and pinch them together, carefully pinching the seams so that there are no open cracks.  I kept the seam sides up while baking.  I also brushed some melted butter on the tops.  These turned out beautifully.  The only thing I'll change when making again is to omit the salt.  The ham makes it salty enough.

This would have been much better made with puff pastry.  The crescent roll dough was too sweet and doughy for the recipe.  I subbed out the prosciutto for cranberries. I might try this again someday with the puff pastry and some type of sauce.

Very good. They were easy and looked nice when finished. The only thing i would do differently is maybe add some other meat or spices to it because they were kind of plain. Good but plain. I will make again and experiment!

My family loved this. I used a box of frozen spinach...feta instead of brie, and didn't have any prosciutto, but didn't replace anything for it. I also used the crescent sheets and just rolled everything together. I know that sounds like I changed everything, but it was still the same idea..Thanks!

Awesome and easy!  My husband loves these. I  poach the chicken and chop it and put about a 1/3 cup of chopped chicken and a cube of cheese in the center of the ham slice.  I then placed it in the center of the dough piece.  I wrapped the dough around the meat and cheese 
(I took a piece of the end of the triangle and used it to plug in any holes).  We have made this also with some Havarti.

I've been making this recipe for a few years now, and it is always a hit! The only thing I do differently is season the chicken with some seasoned salt and pepper before cooking it on the stove.

Nice simple recipe.  We liked it. I couldn't wrap the biscuit entirely around the chicken, but the kids liked to see the cheese oozing out, so I guess it worked out fine.

Not Bad!  I found them hard to roll, even after flattening the chicken.  If I was to make this again, I'd probably use another flavor of cheese and more prosuitto.  I noticed some people found this oily...not me...actually a bit dry....maybe I needed to add more cheese?  Anyway, I may make this again, but just differently.

Very good recipe!  I use feta cheese because I cant' find Brie at my local store.  I'd recommend sprinkling the chicken with lemon pepper when frying it and avoiding the olive oil.  I've made this a few times and find it a lot easier to not use the store brand crescents.  I prefer the Pillsbury big crescents.

I could not find Brie cheese at my local supermarket, so I replaced it with Provolone cheese.  This makes a great meal, good for a quick family dinner or a fancy dinner with guests.
