These are awesome. I found the secret of making them super crispy, after reading all the reviews.  I put the bacon wrapped waterchestnuts on a wire rack over a 9X 12 baking pan, and baked them until they were crispy...then I put the sauce over...yum.  Incredible appetizer.

I've made these twice now over the holidays and they were a hit both times.  I did follow the recipe exactly and it's a very quick and easy appetizer to put together.  I few things to mention though...you do have to cook them longer than the recipe states (about 45 minutes for us) and it's important that you use a really big (preferrably shallow) baking dish to allow the sauce to spread out.  If your dish is too small, the chestnuts will just boil in the sauce resulting in limp bacon.

I found that you can cut the bacon in thirds instead of half. Cutting the sauce recipe in half works too. I marinated the water chestnuts for a 1/2 before wrapping them in the bacon. It gave them  more flavor. Then i used the marinade to baste them before cooking. Draining the fat off during cooking time helped alot too.

These are absolutely delicious. They disappeared so fast on New Year's Eve that I swear my guests were eating toothpicks and all! Speaking of toothpicks, the suggestion someone made about soaking them first was a good one. I baked them for a 1/2 hour the night before, which was a great time-saver. I found it took another 1/2 hour to get them to the desired 'done-ness'. I did what others suggested and halved the brown sugar, and it too was a good move. Ten people devoured about 70 of these in no time flat, with lots of other hors d'oeuvres to eat as well, so judge yourself accordingly. I can't imagine how many I'd have to make in order to have leftovers!!

This recipe is delicious. However, next time I make it I will reduce the sauce amount by about half (the wraps were virtually swimming!). I would also reduce the baking time by increasing the temperature, which would also make for crunchier bacon.

The firest time I tried this recipe, I made them for a friend's birthday party, it was a huge hit!  So many people raved about how wonderful they tasted.  I doubled the batch and didn't have any left!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I did add a few squirts of Sriracha Hot Chile Sauce to give it a bit of heat (just add to your taste).  I only used half a strip of bacon to wrap the waterchestnut.  I baked them longer until the bacon was crispy.  Then I dipped them in the sauce and baked again for 10-15 longer so that the sauce was more of a glaze.  I did not double the sauce, the amount of sauce was plenty, even though I doubled the amount of waterchestnuts/bacon I used.  I also soaked the toothpicks in water so they didn't burn or turn dark brown.  I served them in a crock pot set on low to keep them warm.  Since then, I have received constant requests for me to make these again!

These are SO good - I made them for a family get-together, and they were gone within 30 minutes! I used the suggestions of others and drained off the fat, cooked at a higher temperature for less time, and also cut the sauce ingredients in half. PERFECT!

These are so delicious!  I did as many reviewers suggested and halved the sauce recipe; I found this to be the perfect amount.  I also cut my bacon into thirds as another reviewer suggested and found that this was ok 95% of the time; the bacon shrinks as it cooks so if you cut your bacon into thirds make sure it's not wrapped too tightly or the bacon breaks.  I made half of my recipe using one can of (sliced) water chestnuts (I doubled up some of the smaller ones) and the other half using (fresh) pineapple (~ 1/6th or so?) as dadelson suggested- both were excellent and I don't know if I could pick a favorite if I had to!  The waterchestnuts are still crisp and so for those it's more of a texture thing but the sweetness of the pineapple perfectly offsets the saltiness of the bacon so...  YUM!  

I baked at the recommended temp until the bacon was "done"- firm but not crispy- about 25 minutes?  Perhaps 30...  Then I dipped each bacon-wrapped morsel in the sauce (tapping off the excess) and transported them to a friend's house for her baby shower.  Once there we popped them in the oven until the sauce had just begun to carmelize- about 10 or 15 minutes, I think.  They were a huge success and the plates were cleaned within about 10 minutes, max!  I will DEFINTELY make these again and again.

I made these and followed the directions except I took them out of the fat and pan and transferred them to a new clean pan.  The bacon was rubbery and not crispy at all.  I would cook them a lot longer and make sure they are crispy before I put the sauce on them next time! The sauce is great!

I don't know why everyone is say to half the sauce ingredients.  With these being so delicious and disappearing so fast, I say double the bacon and the chestnuts! ! !

These have always been a favorite.  The BBQ style sauce was new for me. I generally baste them in just Worchestershire and a touch of cayenne while they bake.  Using a wire rack is a must to get them crunchy.   After they were fully crisped up I bathed them in the BBQ sauce then broiled them to caramelize the sauce on top.

These are great!!  I have made them many time when having guests over and they are a hit! One thing that I do differently is that I make them ahead of time and sauce in a separate dish.  When I'm ready to serve them I then out the sauce in and cook the last 30 mins.

My family loves this recipe, although I make the sauce with just 1 c. ketchup, 2/3 c. tomato sauce, 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1 1/2 Tbsp. worcestershire and 1/2 tsp. onion salt. It's a little less sweet and more tangy than the posted recipe and the onion salt adds a little something extra too.

Slight tweak to recipe eliminates soggy bacon problem. Pre-cook bacon in microwave, wrap chestnuts while bacon is fresh from the microwave and still pliable. Cover with sauce and bake for 30 minutes.

I cooked this according to the instructions and they came out very greasy and the bacon wasn't very crisp.  Next time I'll try cooking the bacon wraps on a rack to let the grease drip away.  I did drain all of the grease before adding the sauce, but the wraps were just too greasy.  Hopefully the modifications I'm going to try will work.

I served these at a Christmas party and they were a hit. Draining the fat part way through was a great tip; I actually did it twice. I would use a large pan next time so that the bacon cooks faster. I had to add time as mine were squished together tightly on their pan.

I've made these a number of times and people LOVE them!  I've started using Oscar Meyer Center cut bacon and the size, when cut in half is absolutely perfect and makes rolling the chestnuts much easier.  I also agree with others that have posted that you really need to bake these longer initially than the recipe calls for. I bake my 25 - 30 minutes drain, add the sauce and bake for another 30 minutes.  Excellent recipe!

These were really good, but I'd definitely use barbecue or teriyaki sauce next time instead of ketchup.  I could taste the ketchup which cheapened this delicious appetizer a bit.  I made two different versions of these (both from recipes I found at AllRecipes), one with the ketchup recipe and one with the teriyaki recipe, and while both were eaten and enjoyed, the teriyaki ones went first.

These are amazing.  I followed some tips from here and put the temp higher and flipped them over half way though.  They were a huge hit and will be making them again.

These were delish! I cut the bacon in thirds as others suggested and it was just the right size. I also cut the sauce in half and had enough to do three cans of chestnuts. The reason I gave four stars is because they took much longer to cook than stated. I baked the wrapped chestnuts on a wire rack in a sheet pan at 375 for about 45 minutes. I then dipped each one into the sauce and placed them in a glass baking dish that I had sprayed with cooking spray. I baked them again for another 45 minutes. They came out crispy and gooey. Yum Yum!

To give the sauce a little more of a kick I cut the ketchup to 1 cup and added 1 cup of Heinz chili sauce.  I also added about 1 - 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and a few drops of chalula (hot pepper) sauce to taste.  They were great!  Oh, and if you're low on bacon you can cut the bacon strips in thirds instead of half, that worked for me.

These are VERY good.  I no longer eat pork, so tried them with turkey bacon this time.  They were still delicious, and much less greasy/fattening.  I microwaved the turkey bacon in batches of 4 slices between 2 paper towels for around 30 seconds to get the cooking process started in the hopes they would crisp up faster, and that worked out great.  I halved the slices and wrapped a whole water chestnut in each half.  I cooked on a broiler pan, and just brushed the sauce on each wrap before baking for 30 minutes -- the turkey bacon cooks MUCH faster than pork bacon, as I recall having to cook the regular ones a lot longer.

Tried this for Thanksgiving dinner and they were gone right away! TIP: try using maple bacon! The taste really came through, and the house smelled terrific! Also, I cooked these on a jelly roll pan instead of a dish, and based on other's tips, I cooked them for about 10 minutes longer before putting the sauce on and only used about 1/3 of the sauce. That helped them come out crispy and very tasty!

I made these last year for Thanksgiving and Christmas and they were a hit.  They did take a lot lot longer to cook (about an 1 1/2 hours, but I didn't mind it because I had plenty of time.  If I were short on time, I'd microwave them or precook the bacon a bit in a pan.   They were also a bit of a project to wrap up, but it was a fun project.  They were a big hit, especially among the bacon lovers.

These are a favorite at any gathering I take them to! I bake for 35 minutes before putting on the sauce and then for another 20 or so after adding it. The bacon gets a little more crisp that way.

This is a great recipe. I have a recipe for this that does not call for ketchup, so, I tried it and added some garlic powder from the old recipe. It turned out great and will be using this combination again. Thanks

Yummy! None left at New Years party!  I made life much easier by just adding bbq sauce (watered down a bit) over the top of them before baking.....WOW!  Someone suggested broiling them a bit...but I didnt because of the toothpick!  Would add a bit of more crunch though!

These are amazing water chestnuts wrapped in bacon.  The only change I made was to cook the bacon until crisp (about 40 minutes) the day before I needed them.  On Christmas Eve I just added the sauce and heated through.  The sauce is excellent!  Yum.

This is the exact recipe I use and I absolutely LOVE these. The amount of sauce is perfect so don't half that. It's supposed to cook on the chestnuts and get nice and sticky. The tip I can give is to bake them on a wire rack so the bacon gets crispy all the way around and they aren't just sitting in fat (did that, awful). I line the pan that I use the wire rack on so it's easy clean up. I also recommend using a jelly roll pan so there's some room for the fat to drip.

These were a good addition to our appetizer menu at got eaten up. I like the idea of the bacon wrapped water chesnut, but the sauce wasn't to my personal liking, so I think I'll try a different version next time. It just tasted like sweet ketchup to me - why that surprises me, given the ingredients, I do not know.

These are wonderful, had to cook them a little while longer and I didn't drain the grease and while they were still great, I think draining the grease would have made them even better.  I like the idea someone else had about using a metal rack to let the fat drip off into the bottom of the pan, that way you don't have to worry about having to empty to bottom of the pan half way through

This is hands down a new favourite for any get together!  I haven't met someone who doesn't fall in love with them after one bite!!  

I use less ketchup though (about 1/2 cup less) and add more worcestershire (to my taste preference).  I also cut a lb of bacon in 1/3 to make it go a bit farther (and with less guilt about eating too much bacon!).  This allows you to use 3 cans of water chestnuts so there are plenty to go around!

I bake them on a foil lined cookie sheet at 400 for about 1/2 hr, pour off the grease, smother them in the sauce then they go back in for another 15-20 mins (we like them crispy!).

I've made this twice now, once as the original was posted, and nce with a couple changes. Both tasted very good, but I liked it with less sauce (1/2 of it) and adding about a teaspoon of garlic powder to the sauce. Also I cooked it about 5 minutes longer before adding the sauce for a bit crispier bacon.

I made these for a tailgate, and they were gone within minutes. As others recommended, I marinated the water chestnuts in the sauce for 1/2 hour before wrapping them in the bacon. I drained the fat after 15 minutes then baked for another 30 minutes.  Will definitely make again!

These yummy little appetizers almost never make it to the potluck .... so good.  I find that when I bake them the bottoms are not crunchy so I put them all in a frying pan and cook them a little more.  Then I add the sauce.

Can you say AMAZING. These were tasty little morsels and I served them to company who have had bacon wrapped water chestnuts before but never in a sauce. I liked the fact it didn't have many ingredients and I had everything on hand. I cut the bacon in half to wrap and put them in the oven to crisp first before adding sauce. Everyone enjoyed, no leftovers and the recipe was passed along.

YUMMY!!!! The only thing I do differently is to cut back on the sugar (by 1/4 C) if the bacon I'm using is the sugar cured or maple kind vs. the hickory smoked.

Good.  The only thing I did differently was used the wire rack on the cookie sheet to drain the fat, I also marinated the water chestnuts in a cup of bottled italian dressing overnight.  This gives the bland chestnut a good flavor.

Very good!  I marinated the chestnuts in a little soy sauce and worchestershire sauce.   I only used 1 can of chestnuts to 1 lb good quality bacon.  The larger chestnuts I halved. I only make half of the sauce. It is more than enough.

The only changes I made were to halve the water chestnuts (the ones I bought seemed rather large), halved the sauce recipe and cooked them w/o the sauce for a bit longer than the recipe states. Served them to guests here to watch our college basketball team and everyone enjoyed them.

These were very tasty.  I served them at a cookie exchange, and everyone thought they were great.  I did follow some other people's suggestions and tweak the recipe.  I initially baked the wraps for about 40 minutes.  I also only used half the sauce that was called for.  It still seemed like plenty for all the water chestnuts.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Very yummy!

These were ok.  I thought they were pretty time consuming and they came out too greasy for my taste.

I don't know where the idea came from, but I quartered the water chestnuts and stuffed them into pitted prunes.  I also wrapped them in a third of a piece of bacon and substituted the Worcestershire sauce with Teryaki.  They went so fast, they almost caused a riot.  Thanks Beth!

I've been making these for years when we have family and friends in.  Instead of the water chestnuts you can also use the watermelon rinds that come in a jar. A much sweeter taste.

My whole family loves these! I always halve the recipe and use an 8"x8" pan. I cook the wrapped chestnuts for about a half an hour and pour off the grease. Then I add the sauce and cook another half hour.

What a crowd pleaser! Everyone loved them, this appetizer is definitely a DO AGAIN!  I had a hard time finding whole water chestnuts, so I used the sliced and used about 3 slices per wrap.  Each bacon piece was divided into thirds, and I initially baked them at 375 for about 30 minutes then dipped each in the sauce. (I did as others suggested and used a wire rack...) For the sauce,I added garlic too. Once the sauce was on I cooked them for an additional 30 minutes!!

This is a great recipe!  The only thing I would change next time is limit the amount of sauce I put on them.  The recipe makes a ton of sauce, so i cut it in half, put it on, and bake it.  Can get very messy otherwise.  This is a football party favorite, even with the picky eaters!

These were good but maybe the bacon needed to be crisped up a little under the broiler before adding the sauce and baking them.

Very tasty.  The juices from the bacon sink into the water chestnuts, which continue to provide an appealing crunch.  Cooked them longer than called for.  Might add pinapple with the chestnuts next time, since there is ample room "inside" with 1/2 strip bacon.

I make this all the time for when we watch football.  I was out of an ingredient for the usual sauce I use, and due to weather, did not want to run out for one thing.  
Sauce was good.  I bake them the night before and then drain them completely.  Like others, I use a new clean pan for the sauce.  I also have placed them in a corck pot and poured the sauce over them.

As always it was a huge success...my version is 4 cans of water chestnuts (drained of course). 2 pounds of bacon...sauce recipe as above (not doubled).
Cut bacon in half, wrap 1/2 around a whole chestnut and secure with the toothpick, place on a wire rack in a "half sheet cake pan" because they all fit. Bake for about 20 minutes without sauce to crisp up the bacon (plus  or minus depending on your oven.) Drain the bacon fat...Put them and the rake back into the pan and baste the little goodies with the sauce...then I poured the rest of the sauce over them. Finish baking another 30 minutes or so (again, depends on your oven)...They were devoured!!! People ask for the recipe all the time...YUM!!!

Yummy! These were a hit for my book club this evening. I only give it four stars instead of five because I cut the sauce in half and had to cook a little longer to get the bacon well done. This is a great appetizer and a recipe I will be using for years to come.

Second time making this.  I was a little disapointed.  My mistake though.  I did not follow the advice of cooking on a baking sheet with a rack.  When I made the first time I did follow the advice and they came out so crispy.  Much better.  Take the time and follow this step you will not be disappointed.

These were a big hit for Christmas Eve.  I baked the bacon wrapped water chestnuts longer (everyone prefers crispier)and then placed them on a cookie sheet with sides, covered them with the sauce (halved the sauce based on other suggestions) and then baked again for 10-15minutes.  Everyone loved them!

Very, very delicious.  When I make mine, I cook the bacon first and then marinate the water chestnuts overnight.  Then I wrap the marinated chestnuts in bacon and drizzle the remaining sauce over the top and cook for an additional 10 min.  They turn out juicy, crispy, and really delicious.

love the bacon & waterchestnut combo, however, the sause is subject to taste. you could do any number of substitutes for the BBQ sause. 

try switching the waterchestnuts for pearl onions for a twist. when serving do 1/2 water chestnuts & 1/2 pearl onions (or wrap them up together). try topping with pear nectar while cooking & drizzle with balsamic viniger just before serving. it's a bit more grown up than BBQ. allows the flavor of the onions & the bacon to come out instead of covering them up.

These taste so good!! My Mom has been making this recipe since I was a kid.  I have recently started making them and my only complaint is that the process is a little time consuming & tedious, but everyone I serve them to absolutely LOVES them!

Probably the best recipe I've tried for bacon wrapped chestnuts! Normally people just use barbecue sauce but I gotta say this sauce is much better. I brought them to a family party and they were gone in minutes once word spread. Will definately make again.

Excellent! I've been looking for a good bacon wrapped water chestnut recipe and this is it!  I did cut the sauce ingredients in half and it was still saucy enough. I plan on making this recipe a Christmas tradition in our home.  However, this recipe is good year around!

Very tasty appetizer. I put the bacon wrapped water chestnuts on a baking rack in the pan (so they are not sitting in grease) and used the sauce for dipping after they were cooked. They were gone in minutes !!!! Will be making this for our next Tiki Party!!!!

Best recipe ever! Used a rack to crisp the bottoms and I think 1/3 slice of bacon would be enough.....My husband and I ate the entire batch!  By ourselves!

The first time I ever had these was like 10 years ago. Every time I make them, everyone loves them. Instead of making the sauce listed, I just use Sweet Baby Ray’s BBQ sauce. :)

I have made these a little different, with marinating the water chestnuts in some soya sauce, reduced sodium.  I usually marinate for a few hours and then roll them in brown sugar and then the bacon and cook.  Can't wait to try it this way.  Everyone always loves them when I make them with the soya sauce way, can't imagine what they will do with this mixture. ??

Oh my these are wonderful. I made these for a Christmas party and they were the first things gone. I cooked them without the sauce a little longer than the recipe calls for so that they would be a bit more crispy. This recipe will stay in my favorites for good!

Good recipe, I added the twist to mine of marinating chestnuts and bamboo shoots in soy sauce and balsamic vinegar,  then wrapping them both in bacon. For the sauce I substitute 1 of the cups of ketchup for a mix of bbq sauce and honey dijon mustard.

Just made these for a party and they turned out great!  The only modification I  did was 1 less cup of ketchup.  I had to literally STOP myself from eating these tasty treats before the party began and once the party started, I ate most of the plate myself. I used a thicker cut bacon and was able to wrap 3 chestnuts per slice of bacon. Delish and I can't wait to make it again!

Baked for 10-15 min on a baking sheet with a wire rack without sauce, then basted with the sauce and baked another 30 min.  Everyone loved them!

This is truly a crowd pleaser.  I have brought this appetizer to parties on several occasions and they are gone within minutes.  I cook them on a wire rack on a cookie sheet.  Putting aluminum foil down first really helps with the clean up.  I put a little parsley on the plate too for presentation.  Again, a crowd pleaser.  Everyone loves them.

I have made this many times and this has been a constant hit.  What I did was to put the bacon and water chestnuts for about 20-25 minutes and then blot them to take the grease out.  30 minutes before I want to serve them I would mix the sauce and cook them for 30 minutes.

These things were gone in a flash when I had company over!  I will definitely serve them again.  I marinated the water chestnuts in italian dressing and cooked on a wire rack.  I have also had this with a pitted date instead of water chestnuts.  I may offer both at my next party.  Great appetizer!

These were ok. I cooked them extra long at first to make sure they were crispy. Then I only used 1/2 the sauce since I just wanted them slightly coated. The flavor seemed like it was missing something.

Awesome!! I did change the cooking by arranging the water chestnut wraps on a wire rack on top of a cookie sheet. Baked for 15 minutes, turned them over & cooked for another 15 minutes. (Until they’re as crispy as you like basically) Next time I'll triple this recipe because they go quick!!

I make these 2-3 times a year by request for parties and Holidays. This recipe is the closest I have found to how I actually make them. I use 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of the full cup, 1 cup of chili sauce and 1 cup of ketchup. I also add a tablespoon or two of soy sauce (in addition to Worcestershire) to taste.  Sometimes I add another 1/4 cup of brown sugar if the sauce needs it. I cut the bacon in thirds and cut most of the chestnuts in half to make them more bite sized. 

When I am taking these to a party I pre bake them in the oven without sauce for 10-15 mins. Then I dip each one into the sauce  and transfer to a crock pot on low. I pour the remaining sauce over the contents in the pot. This way you can just take the pot to the party and people can dig in. When I make these at home I pre bake them as I said above and then dip and transfer to a 9x13 pan and finish baking in the oven. I have also used maple bacon to wrap the ‘nuts but keep the brown sugar to a minimum of you do that. 

I also heat the sauce in a small saucepan to make sure all of the elements combine. I think it glazes the bits better this way. Seriously the Heinz chili sauce makes the sauce really special- give it a try!

These are truly a rave at parties.  I made just a few changes.  Like the other reviewers, I used less than half a strip of bacon, because even using "regular cut" bacon, half was very thick and I worried about it cooking all the way through.  

 I added about 1.5 to 2 tsps. of sriracha to the full recipe to give it  nice little kick.  Instead of the 13x9 baking dish, I used a shallow sheet pan with a non-stick rack (similar to a baking cooking rack).  I put the skewered bacon wrapped water chestnuts on the rack and checked them after 15 minutes - not nearly done enough.  This may be because we are at high altitude.  I doubled the time and was satisfied with that.  

I dipped the partially cooked chestnut rollups into the sauce to coat them generously, then placed them back on the rack and they stayed in the oven for probably 45 minutes.  You need to watch carefully at the end for the right amount of "lacquer" you want, because they can go from perfect to overdone in just a few minutes.  Hands down, everyone loved them!

I've made these several times and they are wonderful. I precook the bacon in the microwave a little bit before I wrap them.. This makes for crispier bacon, also up the heat to 400 bake till almost done then dip in the sauce and back to the oven till they are carmalized... Also you can wrap these the night before and put in the fridge before you put in the oven. Just Let come to room temp and put in pre-heated oven... Make a double batch if your smart because I haven't met a person who doesn't love these!

I put the bacon wrapped waterchestnuts on a wire rack over a 9X 12 baking pan, and spoon the sauce on 1/2 way through.  I also didn't cook the sauce, just heated it through.

These are so good.  For the first cooking, I cook them  until the bacon is crisp.  
I save the little rolls of deliciousness and eat them cold as a snack.

There were so many bacon wrapped water chestnut recipes to choose from, but I think I choose the right one.   This one cooks the bacon and wrapped water chestnut for 15 minutes and lets some of the fat cook away.   I put the bacon/water chestnuts on a baking tray first to bake for 15 minutes and then transferred them to a cake pan, coated them with the sauce and baked for another 35 minutes.   This was an appetizer I brought to a big family gathering and soon they were gone!

I did change one thing, I soaked the water chestnuts in soy sauce overnight.  The only other thing I will do next time is to bake them longer during the first baking time.  We had these with all our other faves on New Year's Day.  They were a big hit.  I WILL be making these again.

I baked my bacon wrapped chestnuts on a raised grid and it helped to make them crisper. I did however find them to not be as flavorful as others I have tried. Next time I will marinate the water chestnuts in soy sauce first and also broil them for a few minutes

My dad and I made these when I was a kid. Brought back memories. My guest asked what was inside and loved them. No leftovers on these. Will definitely make them again. I did use a rack to bake them first until bacon was almost done and then put in pan with sauce.

This was extremely easy to make (although it's tedious to wrap water chestnuts in bacon) and had wonderful flavor.  Everyone at the Christmas party loved them.

However, I found that the times given for baking were incorrect.  I had to bake the wraps for 30 minutes for the first bake, and then, after adding the sauce, had to bake for about 45 minutes.  The bacon was still a bit floppy and underdone, so next time I might do the first bake for 45 minutes.

We partially cook the bacon first before wrapping them around the water chestnuts. This is a great appetizer and easy to bring to a pot luck.

These are really good if you kick 'me up quite a bit. We add 1 large finely chopped jalapeno and 1 TBS pepper flakes to the sauce so that the oils make it spicy. A tsp mustard in a the sauce gives it a slightly different tang. Save excess sauce for the next night to use for BBQ chicken or something else.

Very good.  Used a little over 1 pack of bacon and cut it  in 1/4's instead of 1/2. Used 2 cans of sliced water chestnuts. Sauce can be cut in half.  Cooked for about 1/2 hr instead of 10 min.

Tried this as written and the sauce was terrible, tasted to much like ketchup and the initial baking took 30 minutes to get the bacon half done.  Made these changes and it  was excellent: 1 cup of Ketchup instead of 2, added 1 tbl Yellow Mstard, 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder, 1/4 tsp All Spice and 30 minutes bake instead of the 10 to 15 minutes.  Will make again with my changes.

I also bake these for about 20 to 25 minutes, sans sauce, drain them off, spoon the sauce over them making sure each one is smothered in sauce, and then rerun them to the oven for another 20ish minutes to finish them. The sauce is usually boiling like hot lava on them. They're amazing. People love these. Thanks for the recipe!

I looked all through the reviews on this recipe and made these few changes with amazing mouth watering results. Half all of the ingredients except the water chestnuts. Buy whole water chestnuts and cut them in halves. Cut the Bacon in half first vertically and then horizontally (the wrap will leave for great presentation). Use toothpicks! Preheat to 400 degrees while making the sauce. Wrap the bacon slices around the halved eater chestnuts and place toothpick into it to hold Bacon into place, do not add the sauce. Cook in 9x13 pan for 15 minutes at 400 degrees. Remove Bacon wrapped chestnuts and submerge them completely in the sauce. The more you put on the chestnuts the more of a "burnt" texture you receive, which is not a bad thing. Do not put the sauce in the pan, it softens the Bacon. Put the bacon wrapped sauce glazed chestnuts back into the oven for 15 additional minutes. Take out, cool for 10 minutes, and serve. You will not be disappointed.

Excellent recipe. I ran out of ketchup for the sauce therefore I used tomato chutney instead and put the sauce in the blender to get rid of chucks. I also baked for 45 minutes before adding sauce which made nice crispy bacon. After adding sauce, I simply baked a few minutes more to warm everything up. I will make this again for sure.

Oh man.  This is a problem.  I don't even like bacon - I made these because my boyfriend is a fan of bacon wrapped water chestnuts (no glaze), and I wanted to spruce it up.  I made these - wrapped, baked at 375 for 20 min on a cooling rack over a sheet pan…no draining necessary, dipped in the sauce, baked another 35 - and I've eaten 5.  Before they've cooled down.  Scorched my tongue and it's totally worth it.  

I'm ok with the bacon not being crispy.  The glaze makes a really yummy texture over it.  If I was desperate for crispy, I'd cook them longer at first, then dip and broil.  

These are delicious.  And too easy for their own good.

I've made these hundreds of times over the years.  They always disappear like magic.  After dipping in the BBQ sauce move them to the clean cookie sheet to continue baking.

I prepared early in the day. I cooked them for 25 minutes let them  cool. I refrigerated with sauce over them ( I cut the sauce in half)  I also cut my bacon into three. Re-cooked for 25 minutes and served. The only problem was they went too fast!! They were awesome
