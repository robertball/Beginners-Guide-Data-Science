Very good. Tart but good. I did double the honey because I like a sweet tea (still came out a bit tangy!). Also I put some looseleaf green tea in my tea ball along with some grated lemon zest, since that's all I had, and steeped that together before adding all the other ingredients. Good way to get your vitamin C, that's for sure!

A friend had given my some green tea powder a while back to try and never knew what to do with it until now. Thank goodness for this recipe, two-fold. I'm suffering from spring allergies so my throat is a mess. I brewed up this tea and sat inhaling the steam and drinking it down. I feel MUCH better. This tea is so wonderful. Very flavorful and the citrus combination is in-sane. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is great for soothing a tickly/sore throat. I make it with green tea bags and oj. Thanks!

Hubby and I enjoyed this, my kids didn't.  I think next time I will skip the lemon juice.

This would probably be a lot better with any juice other than grapefruit.  It tasted like medicine.
