I've been baking bread for 40 years and when I tried this yesterday Hubby said it was the best bread I ever baked - and that's saying something if I do say so myself! I made a few changes because of Hubby's diabetes - no white flour allowed. Doubled the rye flour and made up the rest with whole wheat and whole wheat "pastry" flour. Had to add about 1 more cup of flour total and substituted Splenda for the 1/3 C sugar. But it came out great and didn't taste like "health food" at all! The aroma while it was baking was HEAVENLY.

I have been on a quest to find an orange rye like the recipe my late danish grandmother made. This is excellent and close to what I remember. She used make sandwiches with ham swiss and mustard on it and it was so ono. I made one change suggested by another reviewer because I did not recall whole seeds in my grandma's bread. I ground the seeds and it worked out beautifully. I did have a problem with getting the bread to rise so I pitched my yeast and next time I will make sure I use fresher yeast. I shared a loaf with my neighbors and they loved it too. Thanks for sharing.

This bread is unbelievably good! The flavor is off the charts. I couldn't believe I made something this good--it seriously tastes like something you'd order at a bakery. The texture is perfect, and not at all dried out the way whole grain homemade bread sometimes turns out. I don't have a bread machine, so I let it rise 2 hours, separated it into two loaf pans and let it rise another hour. I didn't have the anise or fennel, and I doubled the caraway. I will make this again and again. This is possibly my favorite bread of all time, and I wasn't a fan of rye until now.

This is a keeper! I've made this recipe twice and here's my contribution:I used a spice grinder for half the seeds and mortar and pestled the other half. Instead of proofing the yeast in warm water I used coffee. I mixed a Tablespoon of plain yogurt into the milk.

An excellent Christmas bread;I made two loaves today and plan to make two tomorrow! I substituted fennell for anise (just added 2 Tbsp instead of one) and 1 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon for the cardamom. Yummy! The seeds were an odd texture so next time I may put them in my food processor to chop them.

Wonderful alongside vegetable soup. Moist sturdy & rises well. After beginning to mix I realized I did not have caraway OR anise but the bread still turned out VERY flavorful with the other spices. My two loaves were ready at about 30 minutes.

Pretty good but awfully spicy as written. Nice dessert-type bread.

I loved this--I loved the flavor the consistency everything. Hubs was much less impressed with this recipe. He's not the biggest fan of rye bread though so we'll forgive him. Very distinct flavor in this bread from all the seeds so if you aren't a fan of them you may prefer a different bread or you may prefer to leave out what you don't like. This results in a lovely somewhat dense and moist loaf. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was outstanding. I needed to make some modifications that I was skeptical about so I could bake this in my bread machine as well. I cut the recipe in half to make one loaf. My bread machine calls for the dry yeast added last on top of the dry ingredients rather than proofed. To make that work I made sure that the spiced liquid was "warm to the touch" instead of room temperature. As one reviewer noted their molasses was years past its date but still worked. Mine too. I also followed one reviewer's advice to double the caraway seed to replace the fennel seed which I didn't have. This is definitely going to become a holiday favorite. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I've made it about 4-5 times already and am just getting on allrecipes now to make sure I have all the ingredients to make it again today! I love the spiciness of it and I leave the seeds whole in my bread. I cannot rave enough about this bread!

I have made this twice now exactly as the recipe states although I cannot get 5 cups of white flour in. I use about 4 cups max. This is a delicious bread. My original recipe I have used in the past is almost identical with the exception of some of the spices.

This turned out great! I made only 1 loaf (not 2) by halving all the ingredients. I did not use a bread machine but just did the usual 2 kneadings and 2 risings. It has a wonderful aroma and texture....served it with beef stew.

I'm pretty new to bread making. This is the best bread I have ever made. I made the Breadtopia rye sourdough and, while it tasted okay, it was much more work and less flavorful. This has much more spice and a lighter but still substantial texture. The spice flavor is just wonderful.

I did not dissolve the yeast before putting it in my bread machine because it isn't advised for my model. I added the water used for the yeast to the milk mixture, and put the yeast in the regular way.

My bread machine did have a bit of a hard time mixing the dough, which I have never experienced before (which isn't that many times). I had to stop the kneading process and manually mix it a bit.

4 cups organic rye flour 3 cups GF Baking 1-1 Flour Bob's Coconut Palm Sugar instead of Molasses and white sugar Ground all spices Added Old Fashioned bitters 1/2 tsp Clementine Peel in bite sizes poked in so they don't burn Brushed with Coconut Oil and Ghee To die for. Clementine Peel in bite sizes worked well inside.
