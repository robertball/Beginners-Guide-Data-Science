Great salad! It helps to mix this in a large tupperware container with a tight fitting lid.  This way you can toss everything easily and everything gets evenly distributed.  I used finely sliced red onion which gives a nice flavor and used sour cream vs. heavy cream.  After draining the water, I mixed the vinegar, sugar and a generous helping of dill weed and tossed it with the cucumbers and onions.  I let that set for a couple of hours to marinate.  Then drain the vinegar/sugar mixture and add sour cream.  Mix and serve.

I have looked for a recipe like this for years.  My mother-in-law makes this salad and I could never replicate it since she doesn't measure.  I added extra sugar and vinegar, so it would be like hers.  Very good!!!  Thanks so much for posting.

I make a cucumber salad similar to this but, try this its awesome passed down from grandma to mom and now the daughters.  1cup Pet evaporated milk, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup vinegar.  that's it and it's delicious.  if your using less cucumber & onion then just make it equal parts of the evaporated milk & sugar, & 1/2 of whatever amount you used for those, of  the vinegar.

cucumbers hold a lot of water so i salted them first and placed them in a strainer for a while to drip. I did not add the water. I also used sour cream in place of heavy cream omitted the parsley and threw in some crumbled feta. Put it in the fridge and by the next day the cucumbers released enough water to make up for not adding any. it was good and simple to make ahead.

I made this for my brother as a request for cucumbers and cream and not having a recipe turned to my favorite website.  I don't like them so I didn't try them but they must have been good as my sister-in -law asked for the recipe and when my brother's ate them kept going YUM.

I used sour cream and a little mayo instead of heavy cream, added some white pepper and some extra radishes from the garden... yum! There is enough dressing that I could have easily added a couple more cucumbers, will keep that in mind for next time.

OMG! This was so good.  Just like our old family's recipe that I lost.  Many of the recipes call for sour cream but I like heavy cream & apple cider vinegar. 
      Made this just as listed except the parsley.  I added about 1/8 t. ground black pepper the way I remembered it.  
   For the best flavor, let it sit in the fridge over night before serving.  It will keep for 2 or 3 days after that if it lasts that long.
