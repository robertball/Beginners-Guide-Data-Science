Delicious beyond reason, given the simplicity of this recipe.  The only change I made was to add a teaspoon of sugar.  I browned the meat and sauteed the veggies, then threw everything in the crock pot on low for a couple of hours.  When we came in from a cold day outside dinner was ready and it was wonderful.  This recipe will go in my box of favorites.

Four years later...
This recipe is still one of my top ten.  My poor recipe card is covered with scribbles.  Thought I'd share them with you:

DOUBLE THIS!
Polish sausage (kielbasa) is better than smoked.
Added cooked chicken thigh meat and leftover gravy...yummy.
Do NOT use soaked dried beans without cooking first till tender.  Tomatoes will inhibit cooking of beans.
1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar
Doubled and used one can Ro-Tel tomatoes and one can regular...delicious
Beans used so far:  Kidney, cannelini, great northern, navy, black, garbanzo, lima

This recipe was amazing!  I didn't drain the tomatoes, as was recommended.  I also used Great Northern instead of cannellini beans and saved a little bit of the bean juice to add to the sauce.  For extra flavor I added a splash of red wine, and I used red pepper flakes instead of the thyme.  Served with rice, it was DELICIOUS!

This has become a standard in our house because it is tasty, hearty, filling, fast and I always have the stuff at hand.  I keep some sausage in the freezer and it mostly just needs pantry items.  I do doctor beyond the recipe, adding wine, broth, red pep flakes, parmesan cheese as a garnish, serve with garlic bread and a salad ... we like this okay.

This was indeed a quick recipe; I only gave it three stars because it was so quick. There's a lack of of flavor due to its quick simmering time. I added leftover ham and 1/2 cup of white wine from another poster's suggestion, and it tasted ok, but I like a cassoulet with more "depth" and complexity. For me, I will make cassoulets with a longer cooking time.

I made this dish for dinner tonight, and it was a hit!  I use the undrained tomatoes, as was recommended by the original poster.  I also added 1/2 cup of sauvignon blanc and 1/2 cup of chicken stock, because I wanted to have a saucier dish. I doubled the amount of sausage and used 1 teaspoon of herbs de provence instead of tyme.  My husband went back for seconds and thirds!

As suggested, I did not drain my tomatoes and used Great Northern Beans since I had no canellini's on hand.  Great, hearty recipe.

I think this would have been better if i had remembered to drain the beans before adding them to the pot..it was a bit too thick..i also added red wine as suggested by others which gave it a nice flavor.

When something seems too easy, it usually is.  I made this based on the high reviews, but it was bland and had no flavor. Not very good at all.

Used canned carrots and frozen diced onions as a timesaver. Also, used two cans of white beans instead of one white and one red. Used a whole roll of pork sausage instead of smoke sausage. Added a bit of red wine and some beef broth to further enhance the flavor. My husband loved this and said he never has had anything with his kind of flavor. Also, used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Even better the second day.

This was good, and definitely easy. I left out the celery only because I didn't have any, and used a whole lb. of kielbasa. I didn't drain the tomatoes, and I also added a quarter cup of white wine and some crushed red pepper, and simmered for about a half hour to 40 minutes. Served with crusty bread. Quick and satisfying meal.

My husband loved this, but I wasn't as big a fan. It was definitely tasty, but I wouldn't make it again without some modifications. Instead of smoked sausage, I'd probably use spicy Italian sausage and increase the amount to at least a pound. I also had to cook this for much longer than the recipe indicated to soften the veggies and cook off the excess liquid. Don't think I did anything different. I may try to prep at least part of this recipe in the crock pot next time so the veggies get nice and soft.

WOW--thank you!  I was looking for a quick easy recipe for the D'Artagnan duck & armagnac sausages that I bought at Wegman's.  My recipe has too many ingredients & takes to long so this was a pleasant surprise.  In addition to the specialty sausages, I made the following modifications:  I used Hunt's fire roasted tomatoes with garlic, added cubed pork tenderloin, used Mayan Sweet onion & added a good glug of Mondavi Zin.  It simmered for about an hour & got rave reviews from my family.  This one's a keeper!!

A traditional cassoulet has several kinds of meats, usually pork sausage, pork, duck, goose, sometimes lamb. Anyway, I put in some sliced kielbasa, 3 slices of cooked bacon (crumbled), and some cubed ham. Also used all white beans, some red wine and some chicken broth, and cooked significantly longer than recommended. Quite tasty!

Awesome recipe! I tweaked it a bit. Used only 1 can of undrained chilli beans and did not drain the tomatoes. I also added some beef broth and red cooking wine.I cooked it all day in my slow cooker. Served it over rice. The best!!!

This recipe was delicious! I used smoked turkey sausage, navy beans instead of the cannellini beans, just used what I had on hand.  The navy beans are the only changes I made.  My family really liked this, I liked the ease of it!  This would be a great 'cold winter night' meal as well as a camping meal.  There is lots of room in this for additions, be creative!

I loved this recipe, but I suspected it would be too bland, so I added red pepper flakes and lemon juice.  That really hit the spot.  Plus, I had more meat (14 oz), b/c I wanted to use the whole package.

This came out great.  I took some ideas from a Cassoulet recipe on Taste of Home.  I added cooked chopped bacon, chopped rotissere chicken and sliced mushrooms.  I also used all great northern beans.  I also added some chicken broth and a splash of red wine to give it some broth.  The flavors were amazing  and came together so quickly a traditional Cassoulet usually takes hours to make.

Really good and easy to throw together. I cooked it covered about 30 minutes so my beans and veggies would be good and tender. Turned out good, but I reallly like the slow cooker cassoulet from this site. I would make this again though. I liked that it was made with just sausage and kidney beans and great northern beans(that's what I used)

Just tried this and it was simply delicious. I used Great Northern beans instead of the cannellini,and used a full pound of the sausage. I also added a splash of Sherry. Loved it, as did my guests.

This was pretty good.  We used only the cannellini beans which are more tender than the kidney beans.

Important tip: Extend the cooker time - let this simmer for half an hour.  ***And*** if there are beans that were dried and soaked, YOU STILL NEED TO COOK THEM THOROUGHLY ... otherwise if you just follow the recipe, they're crunchy and toxic (can cause food poisoning with lots of gas) :( This dish failed for me.

This is a great recipe! The only substitution I made was using herbs de provence instead of just dried thyme. We made it while camping and let it simmer slowly while we hiked. It turned out perfectly!

This was really good and really simple. We had it with some homemade french bread and wine. Also added a little wine while cooking, as many of the reviews suggested. It was splendid!

Made it as directed except added some chopped green pepper and did not drain the tomotoes, used our own canned homegrown tomatoes.  Did add some vegetable broth, about 1/3-1/2 cup.  The thyme I have is rubbed so its concentrated and I used 1/2 tsp.  It came out absolutely perfect!  Perfect taste and consistancy!!!  Will definitely be making this again.  Hearty and healthy and cost-saving.

Amazing. Simply wonderful. You must try this recipe!
I admit I tinkered a bit with it. If I may (with all due respect to a brilliant recipe): 1) I don't drain the tomatoes. 2) I replace ALL the herbs and spices (including salt) with Herb D'Provence. 3) I use andouille sausage. 

I also have a serving suggestion: spoon it over a piece of Italian bread, and top with grated Parmesan (the Parmesan helps cool the spice of the andouille.) 
So. Good.

Halved the recipe for meat and beans but left the original amount of the other stuff.  Added a tablespoon of creole seasoning too.  Served over cous cous.  The family loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I were a little surprised at the combination of ingrediants-things we wouldnt normally mix together. But YUMMY! I served over rice, he ate it every meal until it was gone!

Made this for a campout and it was a big success.  Noticed another reviewer had said it was bland so used Italian seasoned tomotoes as well as Italian sausage and it turned out great.  Next time, though, will up the amount of sausage, otherwise it was perfect.

Easy. Yummy. I have made this many, many times and throw in whatever beans or whatever tomatoes I have on hand. Try adding corn, salsa, creamed corn or jalepeno too. Serve with rice and a side salad and you have a feast!

Have made this twice.  Good basic time-saver recipe, but looked too dry and tasted bland, so added 1 can chicken broth, 1/2 cup dry red wine, and 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes and simmered it about 2 hours.  Mashed the beans a bit before serving to thicken.  Turned out tasty.  We like a little more "zip" so 2nd time added same extras, but used hot links smoked sausage and omitted the red pepper flakes.  Even better!!

This was spectacular, though next time I will cook the vegetables to a softer consistency than I did this time. I did add some leftover turkey dark meat, because I had it and needed to use it up. The only other change I made was to sub butter beans for the kidney beans. This gets even better the second day. Next time I think I'll try the tip to add a little wine for a little more complexity, although it's perfectly delicious as is.
Addendum: Third day I threw a fried egg on top and had it for breakfast. This just keeps getting better and better. I'm jealously guarding the last serving to take to work for lunch on Monday.

This recipe is amazingly quick and easy.  Tastes almost as good as the cassoulet that my boyfriend makes (and spends hours making)(and yes, he loves this one, too - he was actually surprised at how good it tastes considering minimal time investment).

We really liked this simple meal and I cannot wait to try it camping as bestrachan suggested.  I bet it would be even better over a fire.   I served it with a green salad and bread I toasted with butter and garlic.  A keeper for sure.

Good Recipe.  I would make again.  I used 2 can northern beans.  Also added a few dashes of cloves, some Worcestershire sauce and used homemade salsa instead of tomatoes.  Added 1 1/2 tsp brown sugar.  1 diced large potato added depth to "sauce".

This was a great recipe guide for a great camper's stew. I used ground turkey instead and served it over elbow macaroni. I added more beans to this recipe as well. Excellent quick and easy dinner!

This was yummy! I put in three cans of beans not two (added in pinto), used kielbasa sausage, and let it cook for longer than called for to make more stew-like. I also added in some dry rose wine when cooking. Very filling and easy.

Dee. Lish. Us.  Used a full pound of sausage and navy beans in place of cannelini.  Used a can of stewed tomatos, plus the juice, and only one bay leaf.  Just browned the sausage and veggies together, didn't need to use any oil.  Then added the rest, plus 1C water and 1/2C uncooked white rice.  Let all simmer together until rice was cooked.

Not bad but not terrific. I followed other reviewers' advice and didn't drain the can of tomatoes. Also, I added a couple cloves of minced garlic and some nutmeg. That was good advice. It worked well over rice. But I wasn't too thrilled with the leftovers. Overall, it's a bit heavy. A stick-to-your-ribs kind of dish.

Very tasty!  I made this while we were camping, very easy to prepare and hearty.
Followed the recipe, but added cumin, basil, crushed red pepper, juice from the tomatoes and simmered longer for bay leaf to season.

I also added the sauce from the tomatoes, some chicken broth, and some red pepper flakes, and it came out very well.  If anything, I probably would've liked it even more had it been saltier.  It was pretty good overall, though, served over rice.

Hearty, fast meal.  Used 2 cans of cannellini beans and rubbed thyme (about 1/4t).  I'm going to add chicken broth to the leftovers to make a thick bean soup/stew.

Have made this a few times for the whole family and they love it, even the kids.  I have substituted low sodium tomatoes to cut back on the salt.  The lack of juice does certainly not affect the flavor as there is plenty of moisture in the vegetables as they cook.

A good recipe - quick and easy! Couldn't find cannellini beans so I used Great Northern.  I also used 1 lb. hot sausage, and I didn't drain the tomatoes.  I omitted the thyme and only had 1 bay leaf.  Could use a little more liquid, but all in all a good recipe - tastes somewhat like French Market Soup but without the day long cooking.

Very, very good, quick and easy!  I didn't toss all of the juices from the beans and tomatoes, though.  Save some of the juice and add it back while simmering - this keeps the dish from becoming too dry.

Did this in my multi-pot. I used diced potato(soaked in cold water to remove starch) instead of white beans. Sautéed vegetables then meats.   Drained kidney beans; added them to the pot with the tomatoes, spices, and bay leaves. Added I/2C broth, and 1/2C wine. Turned the pot on to slow cook on high for two hours. A delicious soup to serve with rolls or French bread.

This recipe was tasty but very dry. #1  Don't drain the diced tomatoes.#2 Add chicken broth if necessary. You want the dish to be a little soupy IMHO. #3 Serve with white rice. To me it should be reminiscent of red beans and rice.

Easy.  Made it camping.  I saved the juice from the tomatos and it was a little bit too watery.  Maybe I will only save half the juice next time.  It took a long time to cook since I doubled the recipe and did it on a camp stove.  It takes at least an hour to cook.  Put sausage in at the simmer part and beans in at the simmer part.

Really liked this recipe. I usually try to make a recipe as written the first time. I did not drain the tomatoes as noted by the person who posted the original recipe. I did use herb de Provence, since I was out of thyme. Wound up putting in a crock pot and simmering for a few hours since my wife was running late. Will try with other changes recommended.

I followed directions but used 2 Mild Italian Sausages, and 1 Spicy Italian Sausage (boiled them) as other reviewers mentioned this recipe being a little bland.  Just using 1 Spicy Sausage brought a lot of extra flavor into this recipe.  Also, adjusted and added juice from tomatoes.  

I made this in the afternoon, and set in the crockpot on low - my son had a 5:30 baseball game, and I'm trying to avoid eating out every time he has a late night game.  Came home, the spices had a chance to work their magic, and it worked out perfect - full on meal in itself!  (Topped with Parmesan - would be perfect with some crusty Italian bread)

I love this recipe! I make it just as it says, but I also add a can of corn. Yum yum yum. Even better after a day in the fridge!

I added a cup of white wine and used about 1 lbs. of the keilbasa.  Do not drain the tomatoes. This recipe ROCKS!

I liked this recipe but made some changes to make it more like a traditional cassoulet. I added bacon and rendered the sausage and bacon in a dutch oven and removed after crisp. Then I added 6 chicken thighs halved.  Cooked until brown on both sides and almost cooked through.  I added the rest of the ingredients and simmered for 10 minutes. Also added "herbs de provence" and seasoned salt and pepper. Then put in a 375 oven covered for 30 min.  Added bread crumbs and parmesan cheese and cooked for 5 more minutes. My husband loved it and we will make it again!

First time I tried this recipe, I followed it exactly, and it was easy and tasty.  However, the next time I make it I will double the sausage and the tomatoes.  Lots of beans and the dish needs the extra meat and sauce.

Seriously delicious and so easy. I just prep all the veggies and beans before I start so it's easy to put everything together as it cooks. It truly is only 30 minutes total prep + cook time. Great recipe!

I tried this as an alternative to the normal boring stuff we usually eat for dinner. I replaced the regular sausage with turkey sausage to lower the fat content and reduce the calorie account for this dish my family loved it I will be making it again!

So many yumms. I loved this. Added some green and red bell peppers cuz I had some to use up. Not traditional cassoulet, but neither is this recipe :)  I definitely recommend using fresh thyme if you have it. I used more smoked sausage, I had a 14oz package so I used it. I love herby skillet dishes with a variety of vegetables and this fit the bill.  Served it on some brown rice, not sure that was necessary since this is only a tad juicy; some bread as an accompaniment would be better. This is going in the regular rotation.

This is a great quick recipe, especially on a cold rainy day. The only things that I changed were to add a little chicken bullion and red wine for more depth of flavor and simmered it longer(about 30 minutes) to thicken it up a bit. Thanks for the share!

I am not a big fan of beans, but my four-year-old daughter is, so I am always seeking new bean recipes for her. This was a hit the first time, the second time, and every time since. I have made some changes every time (mostly to use ingredients I had on hand). Our favorite? I had bacon that needed to be used so I cooked that and then sauteed the veg in the drippings. The cooked bacon then got crumbled on top before serving. Less healthy? Maybe. Delicious? Definitely.

This has become a family favorite of ours. I use shredded chicken instead of sausage and add a little water towards the end to make it a little more saucy. And I usually serve it over some white rice. Simply delicious!!

Awesome shortcut. Even without draining the tomatoes mine needed more liquid, so I added chicken stock until the mixture was just covered (~1.5 cups). Subbing a leek for the onion felt authentic. Sour cream would be a nice touch, or red pepper flakes if your sausage isn't spicy enough.

This was just what I was looking for.  I loved the taste of a cassoulet I had and wanted to replicate it in an easy recipe.  With a few minor adjustments, this recipe was perfect for our family.  I doubled the recipe and added a can of beef broth, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 tsp sugar, few slices of bacon and even threw in 2 baby food jars of sweet potatoes.  All of this went in my crockpot and simmered all day so that we had an amazing stew to come home to.  Thanks!

I doubled the recipe because I had a lb. of smoked sausage.  I didn't drain the tomatoes and I added some chicken broth and a 1/4 C of red wine.  I added a dash of red pepper flakes, chopped bell peppers and I used parsnips instead of carrots because I didn't have any.  I simmered it for at least an hour and served over brown rice with a salad and french bread.  This was wonderful especially on a cold winter night.  Very easy to prepare and I will definitely make again especially because it is made with ingredients that I usually have on hand.  Thanks for the great recipe

Excellent! I made these substitutions: stewed tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano instead of diced; 2 cans navy beans for other types of beans; crushed red pepper instead of thyme; added cooking wine. I loved it! Hubby (weirdo) and son ("too spicy" -- he's only 3) weren't as thrilled, but who cares!

If I make this again, I will take the suggestions of adding stock and wine. Otherwise, it really is pretty good--Just doesn't knock your socks off or anything like that.

This is pretty good, but it definitely needs more liquid--probably triple the called for amount.  I also couldn't really taste the tomatoes, so I'd probably prefer 2 more cans of tomatoes.  I had to add about a cup more of liquid.  Also, this takes a lot longer than 10 minutes at a simmer--more like 1/2 hour.  Good, but does need some adjustments.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was going to have more flavor. I let it cook for a few hours hoping the flavor would develop. I used garlic chicken sausage instead of smoked sausage and I did add some cubed pork to it too. I used all white kidney beans. I used the can of tomatoes with its juice and felt it needed more liquid, probably because of the added pork. So I added a can of chicken broth. To boost the flavor I added some red pepper flakes and I dumped in a splash of red wine, it was better after that. :)

Wonderful flavor with a few changes I made just to enhance things!  First, I doubled the carrots, celery and sausage (turkey smoked).  Also threw in a zucchini I needed to use.  I added ~1/8 c. of red wine, ~1/4 c. vegetable broth and sprinkled in red pepper flakes, cumin, and oregano.  I also doubled the thyme and used 3 bay leaves.  I made it this morning thinking I would have to wait many hours for the flavors to develop, but with those additions that won't be necessary!

This recipe is so good when you want to feed alot of people as it lends itself easily to doubling (or more!).  We used a vegetarian "Spicy Italian" sausage and it worked like a charm. We did a Mother's day potluck and my husband took care of the cooking.  This is a good recipe to start your kids cooking in the kitchen as well.  It is simple, quick and full of so much flavour.  This is definately a keeper in our home.

I thought this was really flavorful. I added a little beef broth and cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. I also let it simmer for about 1/2 hour because I don't think bay leaves have time to infuse their flavor in only 10 minutes. Very enjoyable.

Very tasty, and easy to make.  I did simmer it for much longer than called for in order to soften the carrots, so next time I will budget more cooking time.  I could not get cannellini beans and substituted navy beans, which were fine.  A nice hearty recipe for a winter evening!

This is a good recipe for a potluck or a family meal. The ingredients are inexpensive,it is easy to fix and everyone likes the way it tastes! I serve it with real crunchy garlic bread.

I made this during the holidays.  I chose it because my grown kids and their families like recipies with garlic.  They really liked it.  I would use this again.

Hmmm..this was okay. I ended up adding some spaghetti sauce to it because it definitely needed more liquid - should've read the reviews before I started! The celery and carrots ended up crunchy. I thought the thyme, even at a teaspoon was overpowering and the bay was a bit strong too. And I would add the whole pound of sausage if I did it again.

Not great, and not very appetizing in appearance.  Although it was easy, it filled the void, and one is likely to have these ingredients in their pantry; I think I would try to find another recipe to fill this criteria.

This recipe was ok, but not great. I didn't think the simmering time of 10 minutes was enough for the flavors to meld, so I let it simmer for about 30 minutes on a low heat. It was also a bit dry, so I added water. For others interested in trying this recipe, I would recommend using the juice in the canned tomatoes (not draining it). Overall, I probably wouldn't make this recipe again.

This was quite tasty, although I would really call it a faux cassoulet.  It's certainly a healthy alternative and quick and easy. I used lean turkey smoked sausage and added about a half teaspoon of herbs de provence.  You also might need to add a little liquid with the beans and tomatoes if you use the turkey sausage.  A great family friendly meal!
