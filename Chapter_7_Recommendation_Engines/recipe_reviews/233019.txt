Using the Birds Eye Recipe Ready Chopped Green Peppers & Onions certainly makes cooking chili, or anything, quick and easy. I can recommend it. This recipe, however, is not for us. I prefer chili with more sauce and more flavor. I took the photo and then had to add ingredients to the chili for us to eat it.

Modifications: I doubled the recipe and used the last reviewer's suggestion to replace beef with ground turkey. I also: 
-cooked the ground turkey in a deep pan and used fresh onions to cook turkey in. Then I added rest of ingredients in a large pot and transfered turkey to the large put. 
-added fresh chopped green and red pepper after I cooked the ground turkey
-replaced diced tomatoes with chilli flavoured diced tomatoes
-didn't drain and rinse the beans
-added a little cumin. I didn't use oregno. Hubby was skeptical while I was cooking but ended up loving it! :)

If you make it with ground turkey instead of beef, and up the spices a bit, your family will never know it's lower in fat.
