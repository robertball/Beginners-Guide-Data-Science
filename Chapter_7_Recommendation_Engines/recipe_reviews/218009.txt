We love it!! I have had biscuit type cobblers, cake type cobblers, and pie crust (I know...not really a cobbler but my Mamaw called it that so....to me it was a cobbler) type cobblers. This is almost a 
mixture of all three! And it is delicious. Hubby took one bite and said, "just like my mom's!" That sealed the deal right there. She was an
amazing cook. We loved the amount of berries in this one too... 6 cups! Blackberries aren't really in season here yet, so my berries, although 
pretty big, where not as sweet as I like. I was worried about the amount of sugar but it was perfect. IF my berries are sweeter next time, I MAY cut the sugar just a tad but with the amount of topping this makes, it was perfect.
This is not a dainty or thin cobbler. It is big and thick, which I really love because several others I have tried have been thin. The berry to crust ratio
seems just right. The amount of cornstarch called for was spot on as well. Just a really, really good recipe that will be a repeat here many times this summer. Thanks for sharing, Baron!

Thanks to all who tried and reviewed my recipe.  I made it the other night with peaches and used 7 total.  I should have used 9.  It was still good though.  Life does change doesn't it.  When I submitted this recipe in Jan of 2007 I was engaged.  I still am though to a different person and so I don't have a source for blackberries anymore. Imagine how my new fiance felt reading about my old fiance.  Oh well, she liked the cobbler though!

Thanks Pepper for the review, life does go on.

I made this for dinner on 8/5/11...in the crock pot.  It turned out so well and was so easy.  I was concerned about the quantity of sugar (I don't care for dishes too sweet) and had intended to add a bit of lemon juice to the berries but forgot.  I'm glad I didn't as the dish was perfect.  Normally, I use a biscuit-type topping for cobblers but I doubt I'll do so again.  This topping is perfect for many fruits.  I can't wait to try it with peaches.  (Oh, I did double the cornstarch since my berries were frozen.  The consistency was perfect.)

With all the high ratings, it looked like this was going to be a winner. I followed this recipe exactly. I felt like there was too much milk called for in the topping, but I went ahead and put in the 2 cups. The batter was very thin, but I went with it. When I poured the batter on top, it swirled down into the blackberries, and settled on the bottom. I baked it for well over an hour, because the top wasn't really setting or browning. I was really disappointed.

This cobbler was good, but not the best we've had, we like another cobbler recipe on this site better (blackberry cobbler II).  I used blackberries that I had in the freezer from last summer and added more cornstarch to make up for the extra juice, it turned out perfect.

I got a flat of blackberries at the farmer's mrkt. today and decided to make this. It was good and very easy. I made it as written and my only change next time will be to add about 2 more cups of berries. I had the 6 cups (just barely) so I added a few raspberries I had on hand. For me the ratio of cobbler topping to berries was a little off, I prefer more berries to topping. Other than that I loved this, easy and can feed a crowd. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

I loved this recipe, Baron. The topping I can also use with other fruit. Most toppings have rolled oats and I am not keen on that flavour. Thanks for sharing.

The ingredients scream this is a cake-like cobbler and it does not disappoint. This is a wonderful nontraditional cobbler, and if you're not into blackberries you can substitute other fruit and it turns out just as scrumptious. Well done Baron.

I made this for Easter.  Tasted just like my Grandmothers. My kids loved, loved, loved it.  The only change I made was to use one cup of buttermilk and one cup of regular milk.  Thanks for the recipe Baron!!! It's a keeper!!

What a fantastic cobbler. I made it the way the recipe stated and it was cake-like and rich. I can see it being made with other fresh fruits-peaches, rasperries, etc...  Yummy!

My mother just passed away on April 12, 2016. She wanted a blackberry cobbler because the chemo and radiation were hard on her appetite. I made this one for our last family dinner together! She loved it! I will always make my cobblers using this recipe!! Thanks a bunch!! Janet Spychalski

Brought this to Mother's Day Dinner yesterday (b/c my mother loves blackberries).  We used our frozen Bberries from last year and it turned out great.  I thought it might be too sweet or too soggy with the frozen berries but I  made it exactly to specs and loved it (kids loved it too).  Started baking it while we were having dinner and it was nice and warm for dessert with some frozen yogurt.  Mmmm, we will definately make this again, thanks Baron!

I baked this recipe in a ceramic dish. The next time I make this  dessert, I will bake it for an hour and 15 minutes. To help others, I'd like to note that 6 Cups of blackberries are the equivalent of 3 -  6 oz trays of blackberries plus a little more blackberries. To Robin Medina, who made a mistake on the preparation of the recipe and gave the recipe 1 star, please note that   in one bowl you blend in the dry ingredients. In another bowl, mix in the milk, melted butter and vanilla. Mix these liquids together, and then pour the liquids on to the bowl with the dry ingredients. Blend everything together well, and then pour over the berries.  I gave the  recipe 5 stars but Baron deserves 4 stars for not mentioning all the steps needed. This recipe is pretty easy to make and the end result is delicious.

Excellent cobbler, I didn't need that large of a cobbler so I cut the recipe to fit 2 cups of berries and it came out perfect. Only change I made was cooking time to 45 minutes. Definitely 5 stars.

I really looked forward to this recipe, and made it for a special occasion.  I was very disappointed.  First of all, there's way too much cake, and the cake was kind of rubbery--it would have needed eggs in it to be a light cake. So, it was more like one big berry muffin in a big pan.  Also, I baked it for the recommended time, and it was nice and brown, but it was gooey and unbaked in the middle.  I'm not going to fiddle with this recipe, I'm just going to move on.  Thanks anyway.

This was exceptionally easy and very very good. I made it for my Mom for Mothers day. I will make it again. I did tweak it a bit. I used a little lemon juice added to the mixture of the blackberries. I also added one egg to the batter. It turned out very well.

What a treat this time of year! I found black berries on sale and thought I'd give this a try.  I also added a 1/2 pint of raspberries and some frozen strawberries so I'd have plenty of filling.  We enjoyed a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  Thank you Baron!!

Made exactly as recipe stated. Do not think I would change anything but would have prefered a dusting of sugar on top for a bit of crunch. This is DEFINITELY a cake style cobbler. I liked it but a little crunch would help. Definitely better next day than the day it was made. Not too sweet. Everyone ate it but no one was too crazy about it. Just sort of average.

I tried to see if I could get away with using Bisquick instead of the flour, salt, and baking powder.  It worked!  Definitely a bit cake-like, but more dense.  I did go with adding lemon juice to the berries cause I love that tartness.  I also sprinkled a tiny bit of sugar over the batter just before baking, and a tiny bit more when it was done.  Pretty and perfect!  The only thing I was disappointed with was not having ice cream to go with it, hehe.

My children got about 4 cups of raspberries from a neighbor for helping in her yard, so I suggested making a cobbler. My daughter (14 years old) used this recipe and it came out AMAZING! It was my girl's first cobbler, and it was better than mine! Just don't tell her I said that.

If you are thinking of making this with FROZEN blackberries...DON'T. I did and it was a soggy mess! I guess it tasted OK but hard to tell what it was suppose to be like.

This cobbler cam out perfect. I followed the recipe exact except I made it in an 11 x 15 pan becuase that is what was clean. It had the right amount of berry to topping ratio and everyone loved it. My nephew is convinced I am the best cook in the world, lol. Thanks Baron, great recipe!

Tried this with fresh blackberries. It was amazing! The crust was thick and moist. It almost tasted like a cake.

My sister made this on a recent visit to her house. When blackberries are in abundance you may as well enjoy them in something this delicious! Even better for breakfast the next day. And our fave part was reading Baron's updated comment!

This was good, but my only complaint is that the fruity layer was not sweet enough.  I'm not sure if it was the berries that I got or what, but we ending up adding more sugar on top of it before eating it.  The cakey part on top was really good and I would like to try and use that on some other fruits.

My kids and I picked berries today so we decided to try this recipe and give my husband a surprise. It is so easy and delicious! I noticed you don't have to be precise with the ingredients which is an extra point for me. Yummy!!!!!

One of the best cobbler recipes I've ever tried! Followed the recipe but adjusted the amounts as I only had 4 cups of berries. This is a keeper.

I made this recipe last year when fresh blackberries were available.  It was the best blackberry cobbler I have ever tasted!  Definitely a keeper...I can't wait to make it again this year!  -- Dutchcook1949

Great recipe!  It was easier than a lot of other cobbler recipes I've tried (some on this site), and by far the best cobbler I've made, yet.  Huge hit at my house, especially when served with either vanilla ice cream or frozen whipped cream topping.  Yum!

Great recipe, the only thing I changed was to use a mixture of blueberries and blackberries.  I ended up having to cook this for 1 hr 20 mins.  Great dessert, and so simple to throw together.  Thank you for sharing this.

The taste was fine but this is not a cobbler. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out more like a big muffin than a cobbler. I'm not sure what happened with that, but it definitely wasn't what I expected or what I would even consider a cobbler.

This was decent.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it was kind of dry for my liking.  It came out more like a berry bread pudding, more than a juicy cobbler.

This was absolutely GREAT!!!  Ii would have made it according to the recipe but did not have enough blackberries so I added a can of apple filling.  I was very tasty although I never thought of that combo if not for desperation.  
Thanks for sharing

This is by far the BEST cobbler recipe I have ever used. It is quick and simple to prepare - consistent every time. I also enjoyed the amount of topping to fruit, since I enjoy a hearty cobbler. Most of the other recipes I have tried are too heavy on the berries (for my liking), becoming runny. This cobbler has "substance," which comes from the topping. You get the perfect combination of sweet/tart and the right amount of warm, delicious breadiness to soak in the juices from the berries. Well done, Baron!

Very good cobbler! I did use blackberries, raspberries and blueberry mix (since I ran out of blackberries), nice variation! Also, I added one shake of cinnamon to the batter. Otherwise--great recipe! The only complaint I got from everyone is, I forgot the vanilla ice cream!! LOL!

Good taste, plenty of cake but not enough sauce when I made it.  I think next time I will make a sugar water syrup, add the blackberries to the syrup then use this cake recipe on top.

Absolutely delicious! I am going to have to take it into work because there is no way I can keep this around the house.  I ran out of vanilla extract and so I couldnt use the full amount.  That didnt matter.  It still had so much flavor!

No fresh blackberries in my backyard so I used frozen, just gave them some time to thaw and followed the instructions.  Amazing.  My guests loved it.  Served with a small scoop of rich vanilla ice cream.  What a treat.  Thanks JT

I loved this cobbler! So easy to make and so yummy! Unfortunately, I didn't have all the berries it called for, but still, with frozen raspberries and blueberries, it came out gorgeous and mouth melting. I'll so make this again with blackberries and peaches too.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I made it exactly as stated. It was way to much cake for the amount of blackberries.   Also, I could not get it done enough.  I took it out when it was well browned as the recipe stated.  After it cooled some, I cut into it and the batter was still runny  in the middle and the blackberries were still too firm. I put it back in the oven another forty  minutes, covering it with foil  so it wouldn't brown more and the blackberries were still not all done.

Made it exactly as written. Put it in a 10" springform pan. The cobbler turned a dark golden at 55 minutes, but when I went to cut it up it was completely raw under a thin skin. I covered it with foil and put it in for 20 more minutes. Not sure if that will do it. I think the problem was the size of the pan. The batter was too thick to cook through. I noticed in the pictures, most people put it in a sheet pan or baking dish, and I'm sure the thinner layer will help. Utterly disappointed.

**edit** It did firm up after another 20 minutes. The cobbler was definitely rubbery, but gooey at the same time. Probably not a pleasant texture for most people, but I kind of liked it. 2 things-- definitely cut the sugar in half, and definitely reduce the milk by maybe a third. Add cinnamon to all parts.

I made this exactly as the recipe read.  Not only was it super easy, it was delicious.  I also made "best in show blackberry cobbler" (also from this site) as well, and I didn't like that nearly as much.  My bf loves cobbler though, and he liked both.

I don't like the cobbler with drops of dough, so I tried this one.  I did change a couple things, added about 2 cups more blackberries and added 1 egg to the topping mixture and only 1 1/2 cups milk.  Took this to work and everyone thought it was great.  For me I prefer more berries to crust so next time I may not put all the crust mixture on it and see how that is.

More like cake than cobbler, so was a little disappointed.  The berries were sweet enough, but it just didn't give that dough-like texture like cobbler does.  I prefer another cobbler recipe from this website...."Blueberry Cobbler II".

This recipe was fantastic! The cobbler was a great cake-like consistency. I added a dash of cinnamon to the batter which turned out well.

The best cobbler ever! I didn't change a thing. It baked for 55 minutes and it was perfect. My husband picked the berries earlier in the day, from a wild patch in our yard, and had to scare away a bear who loved the berries too. We served it warm with whipped cream. Thanks, Baron!

Absolutely loved this.  Brought it in for an office mates birthday and it was a huge hit.  Served with whipped cream.  Made the afternoon go by fast.  Actually used 4 cups of blackberries and 2 cups of blueberries. Used 1 cup of 2% milk and 1 cup of half and half because that is all I had at home.

Simple and delicious! My husband can't eat white sugar, so I substituted 3/4 the amount of honey, and added the cornstarch and honey to the berries separately, and put the honey with the liquid ingredients in the batter. I think it was even better the next day; Hubby says it was amazing both ways. I prefer the cake-y topping on this to the usual more "biscuit-y" topping. Yay for berries on sale at the store for those of us without the ability to garden.

Amazing. I am not a baker, so I followed the recipe exactly and I am blown away. This is easily the best cobblr I'ver ever had/made. I was a little apprehensive when I threw it together because it was the consistency of pancake batter, but I'm glad I stuck with it. Whenever I have spare blackberries from now on, I will only put them in this cobbler. make it.

It’s ok. I had to add and extra half cup of flour to the batter bc it was far to runny. The only thing I would do differently is next time I will add a little more sugar to the berries. But this is probably due to them being out of season.

WAY TOO MUCH DOUGH IN THIS!!  Too much flour, too much milk, batter is too thin, takes over an hour to bake.  When it's done, there is way too much dough.  And it's not light cakey dough, it's thick, raw like dough.

I followed the recipe as it was written. It was not at all what I was expecting for a cobbler. There was too much of the heavy cake-like topping (the ratio of blackberries to topping was not right). The consistency of the toppings I have made in the past was more flaky (more like a sweet biscuit) which I much prefer. I won’t make it again.

Sorry, but WAY too sweet!  Vanilla is not the best flavor to go with blackberries.  I finally removed and tossed most of the cake on top and recooked it to brown what was left.  Now sort of between a crisp and a cobbler.  Oh, and I sprinkled about 1/4 Tsp cinnamon over the whole thing.  Now quite yummy, warm  with vanilla ice cream, or as is!

Not good as a cobbler...cake maybe. A Southern Cobbler has thickened juice and thin sugared crust. This was dry and thick bread topping.

I added a little bit extra sugar because my berries were tart, but my family loved it so much that the first two disappeared almost immediately and the third is in the oven right now. Great recipe, and super easy.

I made this with blackberries not too long ago. I found the topping was a bit too thick, so won't use as much the next time. 
Made this same recipe today with peaches and only used about 3/4 of topping mix. Absolutely delicious!

I was looking for a cobbler recipe and decided to try this one. Since I normally use a traditional cobbler recipe I thought this might be a nice change.   Made this without any tweaks or twists and just loved it. Will definitely make this again.

This is one of the best cobblers we've ever had. I think I'm going to use the batter for all kinds of other cobblers peach apple cherry just about anything you can think of The batter is absolutely delicious. I ended up using buttermilk instead of regular milk.

I made this when our church group took dinner to the Ronald McDonald house, my contribution as part of the desserts.  I was unable to attend so made sure I got plenty of opinions from those attending so I could tweak the next time.  Pretty much everyone agreed it was good, just a bit too tart.  Next time I'll add more sugar (I was using blackberries from my backyard bush!!).

This is the second year in a row I have looked for a "better" recipe. We have blackberries growing along our fence line now thanks to the hubs and I am overwhelmed by the amount we have this year so with that said, I'm not sure what happened to the other's cobblers as mine was delicious! Followed the recipe to the letter (except for adding another cup or two of berries....) and it came out great and tasted fantastic. I agree with others that this will make a great cobbler using any berry/fruit concoction. 
Thanks for the recipe! This is now my go-to

I'm not usually a fan of cobbler, but I'd picked some super sour berries so decided to give this a try. So delicious! It came out great and had just the right amount of sweetness! I love the cake-like topping. I did use whole wheat pastry flour instead of white. I also combined the wet ingredients and added just enough to the flour mixture to moisten. Probably held back a few tablespoons. I think adding all of it the batter would have been just a bit runny. Will definitely be making again. Next time I'll use more berries; just personal preference. Also might reduce the sugar if I actually manage to pick ripe ones! Thanks Baron!

My 93 year-old Dad was reminiscing about blackberry cobbler that he used to make years ago but couldn't find a recipe in his old cookbooks.  I googled recipes and came across this one that seemed to be like what he was describing.  I surprised him by making it for him and he loved it!  He said it was just what he had been looking for.  I cut the recipe in half and cooked it in one of my square casserole dishes.  Very easy recipe.

It is delicious but it needs more baking time.  The middle of mine was runny after 65min. at 350.  I doubled the cornstarch but made no other changes.

Excellent recipe but I add 2 oz Irish whiskey and 1oz maple syrup to my berries before draining and coating with cornstarch. After pouring batter add sprinkling of brown sugar on top.  Excellent comfort food and for reasons beyond my ken, it seems to stabilize my blood sugar for a day or so.

Hi, I made my very first cobbler today by your blackberry recipe. Never tried before and today for 160 people :)))
haven't had the chance to taste it yet, but they look great. Don't know if you'll get to see the pic from my oven or after baking..

I followed the instructions as stated. I think the vanilla extract ruined this recipe. Also, the dough had this spongy texture. This is not like the traditional cobbler I have had before.

I made no changes, and my family loved this dish.  I am on a low carb diet, so I couldn’t taste it; judging by the response, it was a huge hit.

Everyone said we should call it Blackberry “cake”, instead of cobbler.   I will make it again. Thank you.

I followed the recipe.  It was OK.  I'm used to a crumble type topping on my cobblers and this was more like blackberry cake.  If you like blackberry cake, this is a great recipe.

Delicious cobbler!!!  Followed Barron’s recipe precisely. Great color & my kitchen smells like Heaven! Either my berries were lacking in moisture, or I was a little heavy handed with the cornstarch - next  time I may make it with a wee bit less.

i used rasberriess. i cooked the berries a bit with the sugar and strained to remove the seeds. i have heirloom berries and they have lots and lots of seeds! then i mixed the flour into the berries and topped with butter. i did add a little more flour.. i should have used crushed tapioca as it is far far better with the softer berries such as raspberries and black berries. but i did add extra vanilla and lemon crystals to the berry mix to perk it up. i used more baking powder and let the batter set for a few min to get fluffy before layering it onto the berry mixture.  what i ended up with was a wonderful rich cooked raspberry buttery pudding with a fluffy vanilla cake on top that only sank part way in giving nice bites of gooey and fluffy. .... it's a hit! i can't wait to try this again with peaches (using a bit of lime rather than lemon on the fruit).  I am thinking this would be wonderful with a lemon cake batter on those blueberries too...

I have people in my family who are skilled in the art of cobblers. I had never made one, and I didn’t want to be babied while making it, so I looked up a recipe on this site. It got out of the oven a little bit ago and looks great. But I think the recipe needs to be changed. The topping was soupy, and I had to add at least another cup of flour to it. I had a lot of help in the end. But the look seemed nice, and I’m excited to try it. Just needs to be changed.

Seriously the best cobbler I've ever had. I added 1 tsp each of almond extract and lemon extract to the berries, along with 1 T cinnamon. To bump up the flavor of the topping, I added 1 tsp of lemon extract and substituted 1/2 c of brown sugar for 1/2 c of the white sugar. We didn't have any milk, so I used 2 cups of half n half instead. This cobbler isn't too sweet, and the topping doesn't overwhelm the berries. It's now at the top of my dessert go-to list.

Made a perfect cobbler, but I think i would prefer a different fruit. My family wasn’t crazy for the blackberry flavor. Maybe with mixed berries or peaches. It made a lot! Better with ice cream vs whipped cream.

Super easy to make and tastes wonderful!  To help with conversion, 6 cups of blackberries was about  3 of the 12 oz containers from grocery store :)

Was a big hit! I added the juice of a lime to the sugar mixture, cut the sugar by 1/2 cup, and substituted  1 cup of blueberries. It was a big hit at the party.

I made this recipe with a frozen tri-berry mix (blue, black, and raspberry).  I let the berries thaw and added apx. 1.5 tlbs of four to offset the additional juice. Other than that, I followed the recipe. The filling was delicious and the cake was yummy. Served with whipped cream made from heavy whipping cream. This is not the cobbler my mom makes, and I prefer her recipie's topping, which is what i think of when I think of a cobbler.  But this is one is tasty in it's own right.

Yikes!  Way too much sugar!  Had to salvage the batch by adding fresh unsugared berries to each serving.  I like the texture--cakey, but when I make this again I will cut the sugar according to the sweetness of the berries.

What a waste of the beautiful berries my mother in law gave me, I followed the recipe to the letter and what a fail. I took this to a family gathering and it was embarrassing! I thought when I was making the batter that it seemed thin, it sunk to the bottom and was just doughy. I baked it much longer than called for and it never set up and there was a Layer of butter on top. It never even browned on top! I brought it home and thru it in the trash!

Loved this recipe.  I made this cobbler for my Dad and he loved it.  Everyone else who ate some loved it.  I served it with a scoop of ice cream - delicious!  I'll definitely  be making it again.

First time, so followed the recipe to the letter. Things I liked about this recipe; large amount of berries, no sugar added to berries, just the dough.
Made it again, this time put a 2tbls honey in with fresh berries.

I made this last night for my husband's birthday. One of our guests has been a professional chef for over 30 years and he raved about it.  It was absolutely delicious. I sure am glad I did not take the advice of the person who said 6 cups equals 3- 6oz trays. I used 2 -18oz trays and it worked out perfectly.  

Thank you for the recipe!  I will be keeping this close and making it again.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!  I MODIFIED RECIPE to be GF, No Dairy.
Being an Autoimmune Patient diet with No Dairy & No Gluten diet, so I adjusted this recipe, and used Earth Balance Soy Free non GMO Margarine, So Delicious Coconut Milk and  Bob's Red Mill One to One GLUTEN FREE Baking Flour. I  also use Rumford No Aluminum Baking Powder and My Own Home-brewed Madagascar Vanilla, how can it not be delicious :)

Made  exactly as written for a family function & received a lot of compliments. The topping has a cake-like texture but has the flavor of a biscuit type cobbler. I will be making this again for sure. Thanks for sharing Baron.

I'm so glad I came across this recipe. I've never made a cobler  before now. I bought fresh blackberries and added some strawberries.  Followed the recipe to the tee. It turned out great, so delicious.  I only added about 10 minutes to the baking time. Wonderful! I will try again, maybe with peaches. Thank you Baron for this great and easy recipe!

Excellent !! I took it to a picnic today 8/19/17.  Raves  from everyone.  Even a baker  who is a diabetic said she could eat because it did not  taste of too much  sugar. I have tried several blackberry cobblers since  I live on Blackberry Drive. YUM

I made it her the recipe. It turned out great just sweet enough. I have used other bread products  for the cobbler in the past like Bisquick ,biscuit mix etc.,  but this recipe is the best but this recipe is the best and I will use it on other fruit cobblers.

Made it just like the recipe, the batter looked a little runny, but I cooked it for 1 hour 15 minutes, then sprinkled sugar on top and broiled for a few minutes to give the some caramelization and a little crunch.  Served with a dalop of whipped cream and it was a hit!  Just the right amount of sweetness for the berries.

I wanted to love this but I just can't. It seemed to be more a cake than a cobbler. The cake to fruit ratio leaned way too much toward the cake side. I followed the recipe exactly (as I understood them anyway) which included 2 1/2 cups of flour and 1 1/2 cups sugar. That made a lot of batter for the six cups of blackberries. The flavor of the blackberries and the cake was very good, just too disproportionate. If I make it again, I'll reduce the amount of batter and perhaps increase the blackberries to 8 cups. One thing of interest: when browsing the submitted photos of the recipe,  the amount of cake to blackberry I saw seemed to vary significantly. I'm curious as to why that might be.

First time making cobbler of any kind. Husband says he like it a lot. His first words were, "oh wow honey!" So I am pleased with this. Only thing would be having a crisper top. But overall it's one I'll be making again!

Glorious! Finally, a blackberry cobbler that can be enjoyed long after the ice cream has been used up or melted - every other recipe I've tried has been far too tart to enjoy alone.

The topping is a batter rather than a dough, so it bakes with a flat top like a cake. However, this surface caramelizes rather than crusts, covering a light, fluffy topping that soaks up heavy cream, ice cream, and stray blackberry juice delightfully.

The berries themselves cook up soft in a thick, sweet but not-too-drippy sauce that can just about be eaten by itself and is balanced out perfectly by the topping. Where the topping and berries meet, the juice soaks just slightly into the fluffy goodness, creating a thin layer of sticky blackberry mash that sticks not cloyingly but deliciously to the palate, delivering all of the flavor of the blackberries with just a hint of the mouth-puckering tartness associated with eating them fresh. This mix of textures together make for a pleasant eating experience, not one weighed down by a too-doughy or too-crusty dessert.

With a taste sweet enough to hold its own, the proper additives no longer depend on sugar content. This cobbler is served equally well by half-and-half, heavy cream, sweet cream or ice cream, which all contribute more though texture and through cooling down a cobbler fresh out of the oven than by balancing out any sour flavors.

Tips for baking: Pay attention to the instructions and be sure not to over-mix the batter. Use a spoon or spa

It was doughy almost chewy, and not all that enjoyable.   I don't know if it was the fruit - I used frozen berries and not fresh.

Made this as written, except used frozen blackberries, and it was awesome!  I took it to a friends and their were four people and I came home with a empty 9x13 dish!

For the few that complained about using frozen berries, the trick is to thaw them out first, and let them drain to get the water out before using them.  I saw where one lady said her cobbler was runny and terrible using frozen berries, think that might have been the problem.  Other than that, was easy and delish!!

Great way to use up foraged blackberries: I added the grated rind and juice of a lemon to the pie mix, some mixed spice to the topping, and scattered some pecans on top before baking/; the pecans were  particularly good addition.

I did not care for this recipe. I'm disappointed to have wasted 6 beautiful cups of blackberries. I thought it lacked flavor and the texture was unappealing.

This is a pretty good start and really easy to make.  Most bakers would have all the ingredients on hand which is always cool.  Some changes I will make next time: 1) I would leave out the sugar thats tossed with the berries - this dessert was sickly sweet and I missed the tartness from the berries because they're just coated in sugar then topped with sugary cake. 2) I would cut the batter recipe by about a third to even out the berry/cake ratio. 3) I may even cut the sugar in the cake batter.  Lastly, the recipe says to mix the batter until slightly lumpy?? ...I guess with that comment I expected it to me thick but its the consistency of pancake batter.  The baked result is pretty good, but not like the biscuit texture some reviewers talk about.  Its more like a dense, pudding cake - not a complaint at all, just not what i was expecting.

Turned out great! I didn't have as many berries so I halved the recipe, but it still baked 50 minutes. It was also pretty toddler friendly!

I made this as it called for plus a sprinkle of sugar on top of the batter, prior to baking, for texture. It turned out amazing. It looked as if there were more berries than batter but after cutting into it, it was perfect. The batter was thick but not too dense, airy but not crumbly. I cooled this for 2 hours at room temperature and refrigerated over night before I had the chance to eat some. 30 seconds in the microwave then topping it with vanilla ice cream, delicious!

I substituted about a half teaspoon of almond extract for an equal amount of vanilla in the batter.  I had a few peaches left after a canning project and threw them in with the blackberries.  Easy to make and extremely tasty.  Next time I'll make sure to have some ice cream on hand.  I definitely plan to make this again.  It would be very nice with plums.

So I glanced at reviews before making this and noticed one saying that the amount of milk called for was too much. I decided just to start with one cup of milk, instead of the two called for. I ended up actually using 1 1/4 cups total. In not adding it all at once, I could tell that a little over-mixing had happened. But, other than that, it turned out fantastic!!! Lol! Really, a great recipe if you start out with less milk!

I enjoyed the texture of the breading but this cobbler came out  rather dry.   We liked it  but missed the gooey blackberry syrup. The berries were fresh from the yard so maybe they needed to sit awhile.

My husband had always been the fruit cobbler baker in our home. I liked his, but always felt it was a bit dry. I decided to try my hand at it and used this recipe. I added 1tsp cinnamon and ginger (because I love both spices) to the fruit mixture and also sprinkled some brown sugar and cinnamon on top before baking. Now I'm the cobbler baker in our home. Delicious cobbler!

I only had about 4 cups berries so cut the batter about 25% ish.  I didn't use nearly as much milk, though.  That said, the cobbler was awesome!  Will definitely make it again.

Although this cobbler was very good, the crust was more of a cake than a crust. Six cups of blackberries may seem like a lot, but if I made it again, I would probably add more . There just didn't seem to be enough berries for the amount of cake. Overall, it was a good recipe, but I'm going to look for one I like better.

I loved it, but as I was making it I noticed that after I adjusted it for 6 servings, only the ingredient list was adjusted.  When following the directions the ingredients were for 10 servings, so watch out for that.

"I tried a number of recipes and none really hit the spot. So created this one..." - when you read that you know somone's a REAL cook, not a recipe follower. This was DELICIOUS - the whole family went bonkers over it. My only slight addition was a 1.5 teaspons of key lime juice added along with the vanila. We'll be making this recipe all summer! Nce job, Baron!

Loved it! :) I'll probably make it again every time I get that craving! Halved the recipe since only my boyfriend and I would probably eat it. We made it together and he downed it in a minute! Haha. Thank you for the recipe! :)

the taste was good but I thought the crust was too thick. If I make this again I'll cut the crust part in half.

I used bread flour instead of basic white flour. The texture of the crust was a bit sweet and dense for me but my entire family (1to 64 years old) loved it.

My family raved about it. I added extra berries as it didn't seem like enough for a 9x13 dish. I have since made it with other fruit. Apples are really good. I have both apple trees and blackberry bushes so this is 1 more way to use them up. For apple I just use my apple pie recipe for the filling and add the corn starch and melted butter to it

I made this today and it was excellent.  Our blackberries are a bit tart this year due to lots of rain so I put a little more sugar in. I also was a little short on sugar so I substituted a small amount of brown sugar. This was flavorful,  unique and different from most other cobbler toppings.  It was a refreshing change. I took it to the office where all my taste testers are and everybody loved it and wanted to recipe. Thank you Baron for sharing this!

Love it. I really like the topping. I am accustomed to a biscuit-like top. This is more cake-like. More moist and chewy than dry. I really like it. In fact, I made about 3/4 of a recipe and forgot to reduce the amount of topping so I poured the left overs into cupcake paper for snacking. Very good and easy recipe.

I splurged on fresh blackberries today at the market.I wanted to make a pie but decided on this recipe. I was so excited, but as soon as I cut into it, I knew the crust wasnt going to be very good. It was very stiff, once I took a bite, I realized it has a under cooked taste, even after I cooked it for an hour and half. I think just the addition of 2 eggs would have made it as fluffy and light as it looks in the photo. I understand this was a more cake like cobbler and thats what I was wanting. But mine was not cake like. More like a dense, vegan type cake. We will still eat it, but next time I will add eggs to get  more fluff!

Just made this with fresh blackberries and it was delicious!  The topping is light and cake like with a crunchy sweet layer on top, just how I like it. My kids and husband ate it all up before I could even turn around.  I will be adding this to my recipe box to use agin in the future.
