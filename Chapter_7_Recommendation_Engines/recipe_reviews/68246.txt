My hubby and I had this at a very fancy restaurant and copied it at home. They used a whole califlower with a lot of the core/stem part cut out. First steam the whole califlower. Then spread the mayo/dijon on and cover with cheese. Then, if you BROIL it to melt the cheese, it's MUCH better than microwaving. It's also good with shredded paremesan in place of the cheddar. Really, this is good, I promise!

I have been making this for years. The only addition to this is that I add a 1/2 cup of toasted bread crumbs to the top to finish it off.

I made substantial changes but the idea of this recipe was very good.
I used 1/4 cup veganaise (mayo substitute) ,1/2 C fat free 1/2 n 1/2, 1.5 TBSP dijon mustard, 3 oz shredded lite cheddar.  I heated 1st 3 ingredients on stove top and added cheese.  This was quite good over very well cooked cauliflower.  While I'm sure the original tasted fine, I didn't want to eat that much fat and I thought this was a good alternative.

This was delicious, and soooo easy!  My family ate the entire head of cauliflower with no leftovers...a miracle!  Next time I will use yogurt instead of the mayonnaise, to make it healthier, but with the same texture and similar taste.  Will definitely be making this recipe again and again.

This was too sweet for us. I'll make it again but with way less mayo, and I'll probably use Coleman's English mustard, which is much hotter and tangier.

Mmmmn....very acceptable!  Like other reviewers, I left the cau. whole and cored it, then microwaved 7 min on med~high power, then covered with sauce (I used grey poupon) and Cheddar cheese and broiled.  Pretty good, but I think there may be a better flavor combo out there.  Thanks!

Like IHAVE2BOYS, I steam the entire cauliflower then spread the mustard mix, sprinkle the cheese and broil.  The BIG difference is that I use Zatarain's Creole Mustard instead of Dijon.  It adds way more flavor.  One of my tastiest (and easiest) side dishes.  Everyone loves it!

I thought using mayo to make a warm sauce was a bit weird so I used half and half instead. Dijon and cauliflower compliment each other perfectly! Will make again, with more sauce!

I core and take leaves off the whole head of cauliflower. Cook in micro until crisp tender or more if that is your taste.  I then top with mustard/mayo combo  and broil and then add cheese just to melt.  I have made this a hundred times and everybody wants recipe.  I say it's a touchy feely recipe. You will know when youhave the texture you want.

I had a head of cauliflower that needed to be cooked, but I wanted to do something different, and I am so glad that I picked this recipe. There was nothing left, and I will definitely be making it again. I made a few modifications, following other reviewers suggestions. I left the cauliflower whole ad steamed it in the microwave for five minutes. Then I spread on the mayo mixture and broiled it, maybe for five minutes. Then I sprinkled the cheese on it and returned it to a turned off, but still hot, oven for the cheese to melt. So easy, and it looked great too. Next time I will try with Parmesan cheese and was also suggested. Thanks Gail!

I thought this was SO great.  My kiddos did not touch it (hence the 3).  I think the problem was that I had a VERY good quality- aka- strong Dijon- that overpowered the dish.  I will make it again with less mayo and less dijon.  Again brilliant combo- would just suggest you taste test your mixture before puttting it all on -if it tastes too strong be stingy. It doesn't mellow.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, only using half mayo and half sour cream and cutting the dijon down to 2 tbsp. I also baked this in the oven for a half hour, right next to my Poor Man's Pepper Steaks. For me, there was too much of a mayo flavor but my husband said he liked it. The kids were indifferent. I think if I were to make this again, I'd add in some sauteed onion and garlic and maybe use half sour cream and half FF plain yogurt. The mayo was just too much.

Darn!  This tastes like steamed cauliflower topped with a mustard sauce & cheese. :l  Not bad, but didn't wow us.  Was pretty quick though.  Probably a good introduction to cauliflower for a kid - with less or yellow mustard.

This is great.  I steamed the cauliflower in the  microwave, tossed it with the mayo/mustard, put shredded mozzarella on top (didn't have any cheddar) and broiled it until lightly browned.  Delicious!

I make this one with Horseradish Mustard which adds a great spark to it, not sweet at all.  Have made it skipping the cheese altogther, and it was still delicious, and chopped green onion after it comes out from under the broiler brightens it up.  It's become my new favourite way to have a hot cauliflower dish.

This was so good and sooooo quick!  This is a keeper - great impression for company.  Following reviewers suggestions, I put it under the broiler at the end.  I also agree that you could probably cut back on the amount of sauce - but my cauliflower was on the smaller side so maybe I wouldn't change it if the cauliflower was a large one.  Thanks submitter.

Sure it was easy to put together, but l didn't care for the taste.  Too much mustard and not enough 'other seasoning'.

Really good recipe, especially for cauliflower!  I think you could get by with less sauce, I will cut it down to 1/2 cup next time instead of 3/4 cup.  I added onions to the steamed cauliflower, and added paprika and garlic powder to the sauce mixture.  I mixed cauli, sauce and cheese altogether and baked.

I purchased a coarse ground Dijon mustard for another recipe and then didn't really know what to do with it...though I know mustard has a tremendous shelf life, I figured I should find ways to use it up. Then I came upon this recipe and was pleasantly surprised. I think this sauce could be pretty versatile with most of the fall/winter seasonal vegetables (i.e. broccoli, Brussels sprouts, parsnips, etc...) Thank you gail for sharing this quick and easy veggie recipe!

This was not one of my favorite recipes.  The califlower gets overcooked in the microwave, and the sauce is just too stringy.  The mayo did nothing for the taste and who needs the extra calories.  I will stick with my cheese sauce or just plain with a bit of butter melted over the florets.

I've been making this for 20 years and it's always one of our favorites.  The only thing I do that's different is to add finely chopped onion and black pepper to the mayo/dijon mixture.  I always look forward to dinner when this is on my menu.

Hubby and I liked this but my son didn't.  I think it'd be better with a bit less sauce so you can taste the cauliflower better.  Also, I only had a white wine dijon so I don't know how that would have affected the flavor.  I added some black pepper and chopped scallions and broiled after putting on the sauce just like everyone else on here suggested.

I have been making this for years and I use whatever mustard I have on hand. My family loves it. I am going to try the topping listed by others.

I might try this again without so much dijon - it was laughable to see the teens faces although my husband I thought it was just ok.

You know how you guess how certain things will taste and some things just don't sound good together? Then you are amazed how they compliment each other?  This is not one of those times.

For a healthier dish, substituted 1/4 cup plain yogurt for 1/4 cup mayo, also used just 1/2 cup cheese instead of 1 cup

Simple cauliflower with a nice sauce.  I made a half batch, but rather than adding sauce and microwaving, I just popped it under the broiler for a few minutes to brown the top.  I felt the mayonnaise/dijon mustard ratio was a little off.  Next time I would use less sauce.

I was just looking for something to do with a head of Cauliflower one night when I came across this recipe.  I was not sure how it would go over because of the mustard but it was a hit ! I used light mayo and shredded Mexican cheese because that was all I had. I also put it in the broiler for a couple of minutes just before serving to melt the cheese. I will serve this again to company !

Delicious. I put it under the broiler for a few minutes after putting the cheese on top.  We eat most meals meatless and I'm always looking for new and easy veggie recipes.  This is a keeper.

I loved microwaving cauliflower but there were too much mayo. 1/4 C would be plenty and half or less dijon. I microwaved mine for 8 1/2 min on high. My kids are picky eater and they always fight over the roasted cauliflower recipe (on this site). They ate little of this one. I will not make this again.

I thought this was going to be weird, but I tried it anyway cause I'm a huge fan of mustard and never thought to try it with cauliflower. Delicious!! I was afraid the mayo would make it too tangy, but it really wasn't. I added a little bit of garlic salt and parsely for some extra seasoning, and also broiled the cauliflower at the last 2 minutes rather than microwaiving.  A very creative and very simple way to use cauliflower!

One of my all time favorite ways to enjoy cauliflower.  I use about a tablespoon of whatever mustard is on hand.  Yellow mustard is the favorite.

very very good!  Just make sure you drain the cauliflower well.  My sauce got pretty runny but it was still great.  As the family had it as a side, I ate mine over angel hair pasta with a little salt, since I'm a vegetarian and that was my main dish.

My preference for cauliflower is to consume it raw. However, as my husband's favorite veggie, he prefers it cooked. To me, cooked cauliflower is bland.  Now this recipe really livens up cauliflower!  The Dijon is perfect. I'd read a review where someone said the recipe is too sweet, will use less mayo next time. I scratched my head.  Mayo is not sweet. I think the person mistaken miracle whip type stuff for mayo. This is NOT a sweet recipe when made as it is presented and it is definitely suitable for low carb diets.

My mom used to make this all the time when I was a kid, but without the cheese. I recently tried it out with my family and added the cheese. Awesome. To the person who claimed it was 'too sweet' with the amount of mayo listed, just use 1/4 cup, this is what I do. Also, I am stumped as to how mayo can be 'too sweet' unless you also used miracle whip. If that is the case, don't do that, it's gross, hee hee. To the person who though using mayo to make a warm sauce, mayo is just an egg emulsion, much like hollandaise...which is a warm sauce.

We loved this; I took the advise of many reviews and steamed the cauliflower for 4 minutes, added to a casserole pan, mixed in the "sauce" and topped with the cheese - then broiled to melt the cheese and it was really so good! My husband ate it and liked it but he thinks he'd like it even more if we used a little less mayo.

I'VE MADE THIS WITH A WHOLE HEAD OF CAULIFLOWER BUT NOT SEPARATED IN FLORETS.  WHEN i'VE MADE THE WHOLE HEAD I USE JUST ENOUGH MAYO TO COVER THE CAULIFLOWER SO THAT THE CHEESE WILL STICK. 1/2 CUP SEEMS LIKE ALOT OF MAYO.  NEXT TIME I WILL BROI TO BROWN AS SUGGESTED.

Didn't care for this. Followed the directions exactly & it ended up as a mushy mess with clumps of gobby cheese all over. Will try this again using melted butter instead of mayo, which might help the dijon spread easier...

Way back when I bought my very first microwave, and it came with a microwave cooking class (this was new technology then), one of the recipes was similar to this one, only it was with yellow mustard, and also had chopped onion mixed in too. I lost this recipe years ago, but lately have been thinking of it fondly. I will be using it soon.

Very good! I made it a little more difficult though. I boiled the cauliflower for about 15 minutes then transferred it to a baking dish and baked at 350 with the cheese on top and it was perfect. All melty and delicious. I used about half of the dijon and mayo that is suggested, but it was a small cauliflower.

I wasn't sure how I would like this, but went with it. I am really glad I did, this was really good! I didn't have plastic wrap so I just put a plate over my bowl and moved it to the side just a little bit. The mayo/dijon mustard combo was nice on the cauliflower, atleast I thought it was!! And the melted cheese made it even better. Super fast, super tasty and so being made again!!

My rating is for the recipe as written - make a few changes and it is much better! For one, there are a couple obvious additions I went with: salt and fresh ground pepper. I also used less dijon than called for, and added some paprika, some garlic powder, a lil sage, a lil ginger, a tiny splash of worcestershire sauce (I know might be an odd combo of herbs/spices, just kind of going by smell and intuition, turned out good though!), and topped with dry bread crumbs. I also used a mix of fresh broccoli and cauliflower florets, I like the two together with cheese. I like this method because it doesn't call for milk, which I am out of, but I had a craving for broccoli and cauliflower in cheese sauce. I just microwaved the veggies in a casserole dish for 7-8 mins, then mixed in the sauce and cheese, sprinkled some cheese and bread crumbs on top and baked in the oven till it was all melty and a little browned on top.

I wanted to like this because I love dijon mustard...but this was just awful.  Sorry, the dijon was was too overwhelming in the taste and did not compliment the cauliflower at all.  I was hugely disappointed - none of us ate it - wasted a head of cauliflower.

Great variation for cauliflower!  I made this for second time tonight. My husband loved it the first time, and this time, with a little added paprika and celery salt, he liked it even more!  Definitely a keeper and super easy to make!

This is a favourite.  Iain's mom loves this receipe.  I use the oven and bake the cheese until it's bubbly and brown on the top.  Iain likes it with the coarse Dijon so I mix smooth and coarse together sometimes.  If you run out of mayo, you can use Salad Creme and sour cream.

This sauce was delicious. I have used a mayo/dijon sauce on fish but never on vegetables. This was a nice change. I halved the amounts of mayo and dijon and still had leftover. I also used low-fat mayo. The cheese was a good addition to the sauce. This sauce had a nice tang!

This was unbelievably good!  I'm not usually a big fan of cauliflower, but like brussels sprouts, I eat it anyway because it's so good for me.  My husband loved it, too...in fact, we fought over who would get the leftovers for lunch (he won).

I pretty much followed the recipe except for using less cheese - 1/2 cup - and sprinkling paprika on top before baking.  Next time, though, I think I'll just coat the raw cauliflower with the sauce mix, and bake it in a dish large enough to spead the florets in a single layer.  That way, each piece will be coated with the yummy sauce.

Thank you SO much - I'll definitely be making this again!

This was a very easy recipe and it tastes great.  I used reduced fat mayonnaise and reduced fat cheese to make it a bit healthier.  Unfortunately, I was almost out of Dijon mustard so I substituted fat-free honey mustard dressing.  This made the dish more sweet than it should be.  Next time I will definitely use regular Dijon mustard.  I also only had half a head of cauliflower so I used an equal amount of broccoli florets.  This added some color to the dish and added an extra flavor.

Loved this recipe.  I roasted the cauliflower first though and put the sauce ingredients in a pan.  I also added some water to the sauce to make it more sauce-like.  It was pretty thick at first.  Delicious.

I will halve the sauce next time.  And I will steam the cauliflower on the stove. I find it too easy to overcook in the microwave.  Good idea to finish off by broiling.

I was looking for a cauliflower recipe with something other than basic cheese sauce.  This was very good.  I like Dijon mustard, but I cut the amount in half.  I did not microwave, but parboiled the cauliflower, then finished it in a 350 oven with the sauce and cheese.

This is the only way I make cauliflower. I normally bake mine but microwaving would be a quick option. Add a little cayenne pepper and garlic to your liking.

My husband said this is the best cauliflower dish he's ever had.  I cored the head of cauliflower, placed it in a large microwaveable bowl and added a little water.  Covered with plastic wrap and microwaved 4 mins or so on high.  Broke it into florets and poured the sauce on top, stirred it around to combine and topped with cheddar cheese and broiled.  It came out really well and it's so easy!!!

I had some leftover dijonaise to use and though I'd give this recipe a shot. I added about 1/3 cup of bread crumbs, 3 cloves of garlic and some chili pepper flakes. This was pretty good, but not fabulous. I think I prefer roasted cauliflower with just garlic and salt and pepper to this recipe.

I've made a similar recipe for years using a whole head of cauliflower, yellow mustard and extra sharp shredded cheese.

I made about half this recipe recently.  I microwaved the cauliflower early in the day on high power for only about 3 minutes.  Be sure to drain any liquid that accumulates during cooking.  Then toss with the mayo and Dijon.  At this point I covered and refrigerated it until dinnertime.  Just before serving I reheated it in the microwave.  I tossed the shredded cheddar with some buttered panko, sprinkled it over the top and broiled it just long enough to brown the panko and melt the cheese.  While this was good, it was a bit too rich for us.  I would cut way back on the mayo/mustard mixture next time.

The sauce isn't really a sauce, more of a coating. This could obviously be due to different size heads of cauliflower though. The ratio seemed off on it for our taste so I did more of a half and half with the mayo and dijon. I thought it would mask the vegetable's flavor but it was very subtle and a good addition. I didn't use the full amount of cheese, just a moderate sprinkle on top. Also, it cooked to tender but not mushy in about 3 minutes for me.

This didn't make a sauce so much as a coating.  It tasted ok but isn't something I will make again.

I've been making this recipe for many years exactly like this recipe. My family really likes it. Sometimes I leave the cauliflower whole instead of cutting into florets. It doesn't last long either way.

Thanks for a new favorite. This dish is simple and elegant. A winning combination for a weekday side. I used a package of broccoli and cauliflower florets, 3T mayo with 2T of country dijon with coarse seeds, and about 3/4 cup sharp cheddar. Liked the idea to broil until the cheese melts, and it turned out delicious.

Actually, this was quite good.  I feared that the dijon would overpower everything, but with the accompanyment of a good quality sharp cheddar,  it was definitely something that I will make again.

I was pleasantly surprised stumbling on this recipe; would have liked to have less mayonnaise however. next time I will reduce to 1/4 cup same as the dijon.

I have always loved cauliflower with cheese sauce, but this is a great improvement--flavor and ease of preparation!  I added ham and made a dinner casserole.  The leftovers warmed up well in the microwave.

I have done this recipe for years.  My husband and kids always loved this.  Instead of breaking the cauliflower apart, I just cook the entire head  in a bowl in the microwave covered with plastic.  Then after I have spread the may and mustard mixture and cheese, I microwave it 1-2 minutes and slice it like a pie.

Oh my goodness I was so happy to find this recipe after my oven broke and I didn't know what to do with a head of cauliflower. Very tasty. Next time I would take another reviewers tip and use Grey Poupon instead of the mustard. I think that would make for a tastier and creamier sauce. Otherwise this was excellent and my hubby gobbled it up.

I was very much on the fence with this recipe.  It was okay, the taste was a bit different from what I was expecting.  I would suggest using a honey mustard, I think that would mesh better with the flavor of the cauliflower.

I cut down on the mayo (and used low fat) and much less cheddar and it was still delicious even though it wasn't swimming in sauce as I imagine it would have been. Husband and I both loved it!

I agree with others that mustard and cauliflower just do not go well together.  Changes I made: steamed the cauliflower, tossed it w/the mustard mix and a little Parmesan, put it in a baking dish and topped with the Cheddar and some breadcrumbs, and broiled it in the oven for five minutes.  All in all, even with the changes, it still wasn't good. Not terrible, but just not good.  Definitely won't make again.

I wanted to give this 3.5 stars. Even as I'm eating my leftovers right now, I'm not sure if I like the dijon mustard taste. If I made again I would decrease the amount a little. I roasted in the oven before topping instead of cooking in microwave.

Yum!  This was SO esay and very tasty.  I followed the advice of others and broiled in the last step.  I also had to substitute a "Mexican blend" of shredded cheese, as that's all I had.  No matter - still really tasty.

Yummmm!  I'm not a huge fan of cooked cauliflower, but I had some frozen and need to use it up somehow.  I used light mayo, honey dijon, and skim cheese and it was great.  I used about 1/3 of what the recipe called for.  Just the right touch.  I'll definitely be making it again soon!  (This would be great for those with kids that are picky eaters - as I was years ago!)

This is one of my all time favorite side dishes. I've always used a whole head of cauliflower instead of the florets and broil it in the regular oven like the previous reviewer. There are never any left overs with this treat!
