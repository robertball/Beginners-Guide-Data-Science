These are a nice cookie. I used a homemade version of Bob's Red Mill flour adding a bit of bean flour and regretted it. There seemed to be a bean taste to the end product, so next time I'll leave that out. I only used 1 tsp of xanthan gum. The cookies held together perfectly. The only issue was how thick the batter was. On one of the loaves I left it as is, on the other, I ended up adding a bit of vin santo (keeping with Italian tradition) to help out and found this helped fold in the nuts better. All-in-all this is a definite keeper recipe. Times and temperatures were right on. I'll just leave out the garbanzo flour next time. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Delicious! I used 1/2 potato flour and 1/2 pillsbury GF flour blend. Added cocoa and pecans.  These were a hit.

Worst consistency ever. I even used one of my $5 Tahitian Vanilla Beans to make them and that didn't even help.
