This is a huge hit with my family.  Instead of making the filling myself, I use chives and onion cream cheese.  I also flatten out chicken.  The salt in this recipe is way too much for us.  I usually omit the salt and pepper.  I also don't fry the bacon first.  The bacon gets fully cooked in the oven.  If I want it crisper, I just pop it in the broiler for a few minutes.

I have made several variations of this recipe. The best in my opinion is to just use the chicken breasts, cream cheese, and green onions (or chives). Mix the green onions, cream cheese and stuff the chicken. Wrap in bacon (as many slices as needed to cover), secure with toothpicks and bake 25-30 minutes. We have also grilled these for about 5 minutes a side and finished off in the oven which has amazing flavor as well. I think these flavors work so well together it illiminates the need for all of the other ingredients listed. Instead of green onions, I've also pan seared some priscutto and used that with the cream cheese. It sounds like it may be too much of the bacon flavors, but it turned out really well. Enjoy!

I didn't love the flavors in this dish as much as I thought I would. Definitely, 1 teaspoon of salt for the filling is way too much - especially with the salt seeping in from the bacon. I may try again with much less salt to see if that makes a different.

This recipe was good.  A lot of flavor! 
I did make a couple changes though.  I added minced garlic and a handfull of breadcrumbs (I never was good at that measuring thing) to the mixture.  Once I omitted the bacon and once I had secured the breast closed I brushed it with egg and lightly rolled it in bread crumbs.  Came out beautiful!

I have very mixed feelings on this. Season the chicken and find a way to contain the cheese mixture and you've got a full flavor, five star dish!  However, as written the chicken is bland and flat, a blank canvas for seasoning of SOME kind. I used Penzey's Chicago Seasoning. The cheese mixture is richly flavorful, really delicious - I used garlic and herb flavored Boursin, omitted the garlic, and used multi colored bell peppers rather than just the red. I used no salt! The bacon was a snap to wrap around the chicken after microwaving it just briefly. I finished the chicken off under the broiler just to brown the bacon a little further, but unfortunately, as others experienced, much of that wonderful cheese mixture had oozed out. I'm not sure how this could be avoided, but it really detracts from the dish.  As long as the cheese is going to ooze out anyway, this might just be better used as a sauce - saute the onions and peppers first, add the cheese and heat until melted. I'd give this dish five stars for its concept and for the combination of flavors, but three stars for lack of seasoning and faulty execution in the method. But even with its flaws hubs and I enjoyed this!

This was wonderful!! I did cut the bacon up into small pieces and mix it with the cream cheese.  It was a little rich for me and will not fill it so much next time, but this is really good!!
I forgot to add that I also used the cream cheese mix and stuffed jalepenos and cooked them in the oven with the chicken.

This was a great recipe.  I have never wrapped chicken around the breast before baking, but it sounded good.  I added some jalepeno peppers and mozzarella cheese to the cream cheese mixture and WOW!!  It was wonderful!!

My family loved this recipe !  I automatically left out the salt and bacon, due to my husband's cholesterol problem...plus I flattened out the chicken breasts so that I could stuff them easier...

All family members voted to do that one again...often...

Tried the recipe last night. Very good. Used turkey bacon instead. Came out just as good. Am a diabetic so did not use the extra salt. Hubby loved it.

Really good, but I have always just used the chive/onion cream cheese instead-makes it easier and tastes great!  All I do is spread the cream cheese inside the chicken breast, add a smidge of butter, close it up and wrap in bacon, no need to fry the bacon first, it will cook up with the chicken and bake at 375 until done.  You don't need any other ingredients-trust me!  It is flavorful and super easy with only those few ingredients.  My kids love this and they are super picky!

I did not have any onion for this, so I used 1 tsp onion powder instead. Also added 1/2 tsp ea. of thyme and and basil. The recipe does not need any added salt, as the salt in the bacon is plenty. I also pounded the chicken to flatten out to make rolling easier, and tucked in the sides as I rolled to keep the filling in. I put a small rack in a baking dish to keep them from laying in the bacon grease as they baked. I baked them at 375* for about 45 min and turned them halfway through. The bacon got crispy and very little of the filling leaked out. They came out very moist and tasty and I will be making them again.

Wonderful!  Even my kids loved this.  I pounded the chicken breasts down with a mallet prior to stuffing them.  And for the cream cheese mixture, I only put salt, pepper and garlic powder in it.  I didn't have any chives on hand.  I also added some minced garlic on top of the chicken after I wrapped them in the bacon.  Excellent!  Can't wait to serve this again!

This is a good variation on a recipe that has been around forever. The salt is a little heavy-- for some people the bacon might provide enough salt. I also would cut down on the green onions and omit the red pepper, as it seems to compete with the garlic. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious!  For the filling I used a couple of the Laughing Cow tomato and basil wedges instead of the cream cheese.  I used turkey bacon also. I didn't add salt and didn't miss it.  I gave it a quick brown in a cast iron pan and put the pan and all in the oven.  Perhaps that took care of the blandness that some complained about.  I folded it in half but left the opening at the top so no filling fell out.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was wonderful.  I made it last night for my husband and I and we both loved it.  I used red and green bell pepper and I also used a large clove of garlic in place of the garlic powder. I chopped it all real well in my Tupperware Prep 'N Chop.  It chopped it fast and great!!! I also used McCormicks Chicken Seasoning on both sides of the chicken, which I pounded so it wouldn't be quite so thick.  I fried it slightly to give the bacon a little head start and then baked for about 20 - 25 minutes.  I checked the temp. of the chicken and it was done.  Some of the people that thought the chicken was dry is because that cooked it too long.  People of a tendancy to cook chicken longer that it needs to be cooked and then it is dry. As long as there is no pick it is done.  This was moist and had wonderful flavor.  Next time I think I might add another cheese to it. ABSOLUTLY WONDERFUL!!!

I halved the recipe but used 5 slices of bacon. Instead of fresh red peppers I used jarred roasted red pepper flakes, and instead of green onions I used onion powder. Also, instead of rolling the chicken I just spread the mixture on one breast, stacked the other on top, then wrapped the bacon over it and tucked the ends under, securing with toothpicks. Done in 35 minutes, then just cut it all in half to serve. My husband and I both LOVED it - certainly worth making monthly here!

I made this today and it was so easy, but very good. I would suggest seasoning your chicken because if not the chicken may come out bland. I also only put 1/4 tsp salt in the filling and that was just right, so I cannot imagine putting in 1 tsp. I did not use bell peppers only because my husband does not like them. I also served the chicken over white rice. Other than that the recipe turned out great and I look forward to eating the rest of it tonight!

This was good. Although I must admit I made a few changes: I did not use the green onion. Instead, I added grated parmasan cheese, shredded mozerella cheese, bacon (chopped and sauteed), and a little bit of italian seasoning. I ommited the salt, since the reviews scared me lol. It turned out ok. I kind of wish I would have cooked the bacon a little bit before I put it in the oven, because mine was a little raw, even after the chicken was almost burned. I also didn't like the idea of the cream cheese, it "melted" out of my chicken. In my opinion, the recipe needs work. Im going to experiment more next time, and hopefully it will turn out perfect. Overall, 3.5stars.

Tried 04/05/2011 - Used the reviewer recommendation of flattening out the chicken and using Chives & Onion Cream Cheese (cutting out the peppers and onions).  I also omitted the garlic power, but only by accident!  I added bacon bits to the cream cheese mixture and secured the chicken breasts with 3 strips of bacon each, which was too much, will cut back to 2 next time.  I also meant to broil the chicken for the last few minutes in the oven, but forgot; will try that next time to crisp the bacon up.  My husband, who is NOT a fan of chicken, really liked it!  Served it with wild rice and fresh sauteed mushrooms; will make again.

I made this for my husband and I the other night and it was wonderful. I did add a few spices as fresh basil and thyme. I also grated some Monterey Jack cheese over the top before cooking. Yummy

I'm in search of a special recipe for our Couples Retreat at church where a gourmet dinner is served.  I think I found the one to use.  Drizzled a Boursin cheese sauce over top and it was awesome.  Can't wait to make this again.    If you're looking for something for that special dinner, look no further.

I tried this recipe, and added some fresh shredded parmesan cheese over the top, and it was fantastic. This could be used on a low carb type diet.

I did not care for this. I did substitute green onions for white onions and instead of garlic powder I used minced fresh garlic, but even still, I think this wouldn't be good! It was unedible.. not worth trying something new. :(

I make this all the time & it's always a big hit!  I use chive & onion cream cheese instead of the chopped onion & also use turkey bacon instead of pork bacon. I microwave the bacon for about 2-3 minutes to soften it. I pound out the chicken until it's super thin (cooks a bit faster too), spread cream cheese, roll, wrap with bacon, place seem side down in a greesed pan (no toothpicks)& bake. YUMMY.....Love this one!

I've been making a similar recipe from another site for years, it's one of my favorites. I just use cream cheese, more green onion and add about 1/8 tsp of minced garlic. This mix can just be plopped right on top of the chicken. Then instead of pre-cooking the bacon, it can be cut into thirds and just layered on top the cream cheese mix. I sprinkle paprika on top for color and a few grinds of cracked black pepper. The bacon will turn out crisp. Bake at 375 for 30 minutes and serve with a fresh tomato and pasta side. I do love the idea of the red pepper in this and I will try it. And with all those calories, this is a special occasion dish for us!
Edit to update - My husband thinks this is a bit bland, so I coated the chicken in Frank's Hot sauce before adding just a tiny bit of the cream cheese mixture on his chicken. Topped with strips of bacon and baked. Very good this way.

Great recipe, I did not use any salt at all and it was delicious.  If you don't want to do bacon another option is to do a light breading.  Flatten chicken breasts, fill with cream cheese mixture, secure with toothpicks, then dredge in egg and then bread crumbs.  Very Yummy!  My husband and kids LOVED it!

I skipped the extra salt. Could have used more bacon, with out the bacon on every bite, the chicken was missing something.

We loved it!!! Plus its easy to make. I used onion chive cream cheese. The chicken breast i bought were very large so i cut them in half & still had a pretty good size, i was able to cover them w 2 slices of bacon (i used turkey bacon) Also, i cut down on salt! No need to cook bacon  separatley i just used the broiler for about 3 min & they came out awsome!!! :D

My husband made this for dinner tonight and it was delish.  He replaced half the cream cheese with goat cheese and instead of stuffing the cheese inside he made a sauce and poured it over the top.  Yummy!! He didn't add any salt because there is plenty of salt in the bacon.  It going in the permanent rotation box.

we enjoyed this dish but had a little twist to ours. we took the chicken breast and beat with a meat mallet to flatten. we took 8 oz of cream cheese and divided into two bowls. in one we added green onions, red pepper fresh garlic and 3 slices of cooked chopped bacon. in the other we added green onion, red pepper, feta cheese, garlic and sun dried tomatoes. we spread 3 of the breasts with the bacon filling and 3 of them with the sun dried tomato filling. we then rolled them up like a jelly roll. we then wrapped them with raw bacon making a tight basket to keep the filling from coming out while cooking-we used a whole lb of bacon wrapping these. we cooked at 350 for about 45 minutes and then turned on the broiler to crisp the bacon. both versions were crowd pleasers-split decision. will definately make again!

my husband loved it! I have used both turkey bacon and real bacon, both good. I use regular onion chopped up. Also add some white pepper and mrs dash (garlic & herb), and dill since we like very flavorful food. oh, and some jalapeno too for a little kick.

I liked this a lot, didn't love it, but my boys liked it and ate it so that's a +
I didn't precook the bacon, it cooks great in the oven over the chicken, I also used herb cream cheese. We lost a lot of the cream cheese filling into the pan.

I did not have a problem with the filling leaking. Pounded chicken flat, added filling, rolled with bacon and secured with toothpicks. Baked a little longer than reccomended and then broiled. My boyfriend and I where in heaven - next time I will try to use less bacon but thats what held the filling in and made it so deliciously juicy. Great idea!!

Sinfully delicious! I used suggestions from some of the reviews and cut down the green onions to 2 and eliminated the salt & pepper all together.  I also added 1 chopped jalapeno, 1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper, & 4 pieces of bacon, & 2 chicken breasts, which increased the servings to 6.  Before wrapping each piece of chicken with 2 pieces of bacon, I added Montreal chicken seasoning to the chicken.  For sides, I made baked potatoes and broccoli & cheese.  It was SCRUMPTIOUS!

I make this all the time but I butterfly my breasts and use a spinach artichoke dip instead of cream cheese and cover with cheddar. I love this recipe because it is so customizable and you can't lose with chicken cheese and bacon!

These chicken breast were the best ever!  My boyfriend loves bacon so we ended up wrapping 4 slices of Applewood bacon around the breast... This will be a recipe that I will keep making him!

Made this for a community Sweetheart Banquet for couples married 50+ years and it was a hit. Went by the reviews again and omitted the salt. Put breast in a ziplock bag and flatten, needs to be about 1/4 inch to wrap well. Put filling on and wrap, tucking the edges in as you go. Then wrap with the two pieces of bacon. Really important to pound thin and tuck edges in. Otherwise the cheese leaks out. Very good.

I modified the recipe by mixing in garlic and green onions in place of the peppers.  I also wrapped it in far more bacon then might be healthy.  Definitely a winner.

This is so good my family asked me to make it again the next day! I too left out the salt  and flatten the chicken. For the bacon I put it in a pan just long enough to make it plyable, not browned, I broiled it in the last 5 minutes of the oven time to lightly crisp it up. Lastly, because I made 6 breasts I used a whole 8oz box of cream cheese, I didn't want to come up short. I served with aspargus it was a very nice compliment.

My family loved this recipe! I flattened the chicken breast, and just nicely coated them with the mixture which did not seep out. There was a little of the mixture left, so I brushed it over each chicken wrap, and the chicken was not bland without adtl seasonings. Loved it, can not wait to try variations with this recipe.

The flavor was a little bland, and I think it would have been better had the chicken been seasoned or marinated. I served this with cheesy broccoli and it was a decent meal.

LOVED this dish!!!  I found it by the Ingredients search because I was trying to use up some left over chicken, light cream cheese and bacon.  This worked perfect!  I did use fresh garlic (2 cloves) vs garlic powder and used the salt to taste.  I probably ended up with 1/3-1/2 tsp and that was plenty and I'm a notorious salt freak.  I also did as another reviewer and did NOT precook the bacon.  I just cooked the dish at a little higher temp and when the bacon was to my liking (crispy) - the dish was done.  For sure will make this again and again!  Thanks for such a great recipe!!!  On a side note if you have left over filling - it's great on crackers!

This was okay but I didn't like it as much as I expected I would.  The filling didn't stay very well. Next time I try this, I will make a slice in the side of the breasts and stuff them instead of folding the chicken, and perhaps then place bacon strips on top of the chicken.  Also, lessen the salt. Maybe marinading the chicken in lemon pepper or Italian dressing first would help the flavor.

This recipe is so easy and tasty, I usually get my kids to help me with it. I do suggest that you line your cookie sheet with Reynolds easy release foil.  It really makes clean up so nice... And make sure to turn the broiler on at the end of the cooking to crisp up the bacon.

This was pretty tasty!  I used only 4 oz of cream cheese (half the container) and it was plenty--I can't imagine having used more.  I also followed the suggestion of another user because I didn't have bacon: I wrapped up the chicken, dipped it in a little egg, and rolled it in breadcrumbs.  Will definitely make this again!

It was good, of course we made some modifications I didn't mix the ingredients together instead I layered added some mushrooms a little mozarella about a pinch to each my husband doesn't like mushrooms so i added red peppers to his. I also pounded out the chicken first and i also used low-fat cream cheese and reduced sodium bacon. It was a little greasy while cooking so I kept pouring out the grease. I didn't use any salt either due to previous reviews and i only sprinkled pepper over tops when they were ready to cook!! Overall very good flavor!!

I took the recommendations from a few of the reviews and used fresh parsley and chives with crushed garlic to mix in the cream cheese, omitting the salt, pepper and bell pepper. To make it easier to enclose the mixture, I cut a pocket into the thickest part of the chicken breast, then wrapped with turkey bacon. There were no leftovers!

Overall not a bad dish.  I wish I would have read the other reviews about the recipe being to salty because it really was.  I think that next time I make this I will doctor up the filling a little to add more flavor.

OMG!!!! Hands down BEST STUFFED CHICKEN EVER!! I did make some alterations though.. I used Cream cheese with onion and chives (as suggested by others) I did not use the green peppers instead I used a jalapeño pepper diced small and mixed into the cream cheese mixture and I also added cooked crumbled bacon to the cream cheese mixture as well as garlic powder. 

I wrapped each in 2 pieces of bacon and I did Cook the bacon on each side for 3 minutes and drained prior to wrapping the breast with it. MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS so you don't end up with rubbery bacon that's undercooked like you see on many pics. I also topped mine with sharp cheddar cheese the last 3 minutes in the oven ;-) 

This is definitely a KEEPER!!! Loved it and so did the family.

My family loved this! I used the recipe as a base and added my own twist I used:
cream cheese
tostinos spinach dip
to stuff the chicken
2-3 slices/to wrap the chicken
and I seasoned the chicken lightly with 
slap-ya-mama Cajun seasoning
mccormic garlic and herbs
pepper to taste
no salt at all
I just spread the cheese and dip in the center and rolled, very easy! I cooked on 400 until the bacon had a nice crisp to it and the chicken was cooked fully and was very tender!

Followed the recipe just made a few changes I used a lot more beacon to make sure the chicken was completely covered so the cream cheese wouldn't run . I also seasoned the chicken to my family's liking I used garlic powder adobo and complete seasoning came out delicious if you don't season the chicken it's just to blAnd . Loved this very much !!!

This is now my favorite dish! I used 3 chicken halves and stuffed them pretty good with the filling. The filling was so flavorful that we were  able to eat the leftovers with chips and use it as a dip. One chicken breast  was so filling, that even my husband had a hard time finishing a whole one. So delicious! Thanks for sharing!

I froze the cream cheese mix in advance, which kept it from seeping out during baking. I agree the meat should be seasoned. Thus, only 3 stars.

I liked it a lot, didn't give it 5 stars because I did do a few variations.  Like a lot of other reviewers, I used the flavoured cream cheese, but, I added some garlic, some grated mozzarella, and some drained chopped spinach.  I didn't cook the bacon first either, and it came out crispy and wonderful. I should also mention it's a good idea to flatten out the chicken first, it makes it much easier to roll.  There are a ton of things you can add, but, I'm sure it would be good as is also.

It was a big hit, but where people say this cooks at 350 in 35 minutes is beyond me, especially with bacon.  I cooked it for on hour at 385 and then broiled it to crisp the bacon.  I also added chopped frozen spinach and mixed it with melted cream cheese and the other filling items.

I tried this dish the other night , wow was it great!
I read reviews that said all the cream cheese filling oozed out during baking. So I cut the large breasts in half so I had two smaller pieces. So they were each pretty thick, I sliced a pocket into each one and filled with the cream cheese filling.  I browned the bacon just a little bit more (so you don't have to worry about putting them in the broiler.) The bacon strips were  of course a little bit shorter. I put two bacon strips on top to cover the cream cheese and secured with tooth picks ! Very good and I didn't loose the filling.  Will make these again often! Thanks for the great recipe!!

The filling is great.  Definitely pre fry the bacon a little because it won't be enough in the oven.  You will also have to flip the chicken halfway to crisp the other side of the bacon.  For the last 2 minutes, put it on broiler to get a nice crisp.  Not too long though you don't want the chicken to dry out in the heat.  Also use toothpicks along with the bacon to close the chicken.  The filling easily oozes out.  Great recipe nonetheless!

good, just not spectacular. Especially for the amount of prep work it took. Note: you have to turn the breasts over halfway through cooking to get the bacon done all the way around. The first time I pulled it out of the oven I was disappointed that the bacon that had been on the bottom of the pan was still rubbery and not done. Not appetizing.

I did follow some advice from others on the ratings which included no salt and used cream cheese with chives already in it.  In the mixture I added a teaspoon of onion powder as well.  I completely wrapped the chicken in bacon and held the end with one toothpick since the bacon was over lapped, this also resulted in me using two pounds of bacon!  I may use turkey bacon next time to reduce the grease.  The first thing I did, however was brine my chicken.  They have some great brine recipes on here as well!  The cooking time was a little off for me however, about 45-60 minutes to cook three breast at 350 degrees.  I'm not sure why; maybe the breasts were bigger then I thought?? will have to get a good thermometer next time I think!

I found this very good.  The only thing my BF said I should do next time is beat the chicken to make it thinner so I could put more of the cream cheese in it.  That was our favorite part.  I thought the chicken might be a little bland so I seasoned it with Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb, Italian Season, and Accent seasoning once everything was wrapped up.  Came out great, can't wait to try it again. Thanks for this recipe!

This was always my favorite growing up!! You don't have to pre-cook the bacon first, just wrap them up, stick them under the broiler for about a minute on each side first, that way you get all the yummy bacon flavor (ok and fat lol) in the chicken and you don't dirty up a extra dish. Thats the way my family always did it. I've never tried it with the bell pepper, i'll have to try that! But it's good without it too!

We were looking to be less formal, so chopped the bacon & chicken in with the rest of the filling ingredients & served with the whole wheat biscuits from this site -- excellent, kids loved it!

Very good. I used herb and garlic cream cheese for extra flavour. And I didn't have red pepper in the house, so I didn't include that. Will make again!

this was amazingly yummi!!!!  i did change a few things .. first i added mozzarella, small cooked pieces of bacon, and chives to the cream cheese... i also put a lil pepper and salt on the chicken before hand... i also wrapped 3 pieces of uncooked bacon around the chicken covering every inch of the chicken... which helped hold it together, and i didnt have to use tooth picks!!!! i did not get anything oozing out either in the end product!!!towards the end I baked it at a high temperature for a few minutes to get the bacon crispy... it was delicious!!!

I'll be keeping this recipe handy!  Very nice taste, and my 2 year old cleaned her plate (very important)!  I didn't precook the bacon as directed, I stuffed and rolled my chicken first, and then used my cast iron skillet to sautee the breasts.  Once the bacon was starting to crisp, I transferred to the oven and baked as directed.  I prefer this method as opposed to cleaning an extra dish.  Thanks for a nice recipe!

I found the original recipe in a low-carb cookbook, and it is a family favorite!  I split the chicken breast toward the thickest part, then place it in a large ziploc bag and pound it thin.  Repeat with the remaining breasts.  To give the chicken breast more flavor, I sprinkle it lightly with poultry seasoning.  I also use a full 8oz. pkg of cream cheese.  After mixing the filling, I spread it over the chicken breast and roll it up jelly roll style, wrap it in uncooked bacon, and secure it with toothpicks.  These are awesome on the grill, but also great in the oven.  Oh, I leave out the salt....recipe doesn't need it!

Awesome!  We really loved this.  Here are the changes I made: 2 chicken breast cut in half lengthwise to make thinner  4 slices bacon 1/4 t onion powder 1/2 t garlic powder 1/2 t salt 1/4 t pepper I kept the cream cheese and bell pepper the same.    ****I have made this every week for dinner for the past 2 months and there are NEVER left overs!  I even started making more so my husband can take it to lunch the next day.

I'm not sure. I used the thinnest bacon and still had rubbery bacon. Maybe next time lay on top instead of wrapping. Good taste

Way too much salt in the recipe, I only added a small amount and it turned out perfect. Instead of pounding the chicken breasts flat, it butterfly cut them. I think that the next time I make them I will add some parsley to the mix.

Loved it! One of my favourites. 

I didn't add the bell peppers and I used chives. Based on reviews I omitted the salt due to the bacon, and I'm glad I did. 
I lined a baking sheet and cooked the Bacon for three minutes, glad I did. 
I also rolled up some tin foil lines to have the chicken raised while cooking, so it wouldn't sit in the bacon grease. 
I didn't flatten the chicken, I just sliced it and stuffed the cream cheese inside. Messy, but I hate pounding chicken. 
Took about 45 minutes to cook.

Husband pleaser!  I tried this one out with a few changes.  I had 3 large beasts so that was all that I used.  For my filling I use one package of cream cheese, fresh basil, fresh parsley, grated mild cheddar, garlic, green onion, white worchestershire, crumbled bacon.  Minced all the fresh greenery, mixed into the cream cheese, add the cheddar, bacon, and white worchestershire. Once this is thoroughly  mixed together, I  divided into three batches, one per  breast. I covered them up and put them in the freezer for 45 minutes. This helped keep the filling from becoming too soft too quickly during the baking process.  Once I'd sliced open the breast, filled them folded back over the meat I used 3 slices of bacon per breast. I did not cook prior to wrapping. The oven takes care of that for duty and adds to the flavoring overall.  I  am not a big user of salt because of HBP issues. But salt and pepper  was all my husband put on his before he sat down and gobbled this up.  You can mix up whatever you want for the inside, try your favorite  combination of cheeses, herbs and some veggies to flavor what seems to be the standard bland chicken.  The bacon adds too it as well. Hopes this helps with some ideas as some of the reviews I read helped me.

Not really a fan. Even with seasoning the chicken. First it was still kind of bland. I read the comments and used onion  and chice cream cheese. I also didn't cook the bacon first and the bacon  was way too undercooked even with putting it under the broiler for about five minutes. Don't think I would make again.

I made the following changes based on what was in my fridge:   
cooked bacon as directed - in bacon grease softened 1/4  cup chopped yellow onion , 3  chopped mushrooms, 1/4 cup chopped green pepper, 1 clove garlic.. added to cream cheese  and blended well - then pounded chicken  not flat but more than 1/4 inch thick -  sprinkled paprika and  garlic powder on chicken then  divided the cream cheese mixture on top of pounded chicken and folded- rolled chicken - wrapped in bacon and secured with toothpick. baked  30 min at 350  turned out great  - will make again and probably tweak to whatever is on hand in fridge :)

This was great beat the breast out thin and rolled up with filling inside. Had to cook 15 mins more because the breast were very large.

Really good. Made it twice, pretty much back to back. First time, by the recipe and it was great. Second time, with Cajun seasoning added to the cream cheese mix and it was great as well. I like it with the Cajun seasoning better, but that's a personal preference. Either way, you can't lose on this one.

My husband & I love this! Easy to make! This is a great base recipe! I also use the onion & chive cream cheese. & then add thawed frozen spinach & some chopped marinated artichokes. A little Parmesan or mozzarella cheese. Absolutely delicious.  For a little extra kick add chopped jalapeño to the cream cheese mix!! Yum! Thanks for the ideas!!

Followed the recipe but omitted the pepper because I didn't have any. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I felt the filling was a bit much, could go a bit lighter on the quantity of cream cheese, but the flavor was fantastic!

Good recipe but should be finished in a pan and basted to prevent drying and wrapped with more then 2 pieces of bacon.

Like the others suggested, I pounded the chicken. Sprinkle little bit of paprika and pepper (didn't salt it cause the bacon is already salty); filled with cream cheese mixture (chives, added chopped jalapeño and minced garlic instead of garlic powder). Wrapped with bacon; baked at 375 for 20-25 mins. I also broiled it just to browned the bacon. And it was perfect! Hubby said it is one of his fav.  Thanks for submitting this recipe and to the reviews!

I've been wanting to make this for a while now and finally got the courage to do it. I followed the recipe pretty much to the T beside a few things. The filling I used (what I had on hand) consisted of cream cheese softened (one cube), pepper jack cheese (one cup), and frozen asparagus blended(half cup). I added salt, pepper, ginger and lemon juice to the mix.  My family loved this and wants me to make it again for sure.

This came out so good! I skipped adding any extra salt, as I felt like the bacon would be salty enough. I added spinach and some chopped up cherry tomatoes I had kicking around in the fridge, which added a ton of great flavour to the cream cheese stuffing. Huge hit with my family!

I used this recipe more as a guide for stuffed chicken chests.  I used 6 oz fresh chopped spinach instead of peppers, with a little bit of cooked bacon crumbles and three cloves of fresh garlic mixed into the cream cheese (reduced fat).  I spritzed the chicken with lemon before baking.  (It sat in the fridge 4 hours before I baked it.)  Delish!  The filling didn't even ooze out!

the reason I gave this dish four stars is because I was able to adjust it by adding a slice of Swiss cheese onto the chicken breast and then spread the filling on top of that therefore eliminating the overbearing salt flavor.  it came out even more flavorful and delicious and I would make it again. so if you thought this recipe had  too much salt and it was too late to remove it just add a slice of Swiss cheese and it will be perfect.  thank you to the maker of this recipe.

Very simple and really liked the red bell pepper profile in the filling! Will definitely make this again, however as others mentioned, I'll probably cut the salt by half for the filling.

This is easier to make with boneless, skinless chicken thighs. The thighs roll up easily and you don't have to do all of that pounding. There was no need for toothpicks.

OMG!!! I have been searching for dietary recipes and I know this isn't very dietician like but, this was the best I normally do my own cooking but, I started a diet and ran across this recipe. Although, I was scarred to try after I made it but, LORD knows I am glad I did try this my hubby is very particular about what he eats, HE LOVED IT AND SO DID MY SON, the only thing I did different was add Swiss cheese on top. It was well worth it. Thank for posting this wonderful recipe.

This recipe is flawless. I made this unique dish as a surprise the first time, and my guests thought it was very creative, with delicious and unexpected flavour! I live with 5 boys and they all love it every time, no complaints. I made the recipe as-is, no modifications and I have no  complaints! I prefer to use thin-sliced chicken breasts because they are easier to fold over the stuffing. So delicious though.

Side note: I found that the "stuffing" by itself also makes a great chip dip for Tostitos and the like! Sometimes I make it by itself for potluck situations where I bring snacks. Enjoy :)

It was okay. I didn't think the flavors merged to make a cohesive dish ... tasted like chicken with cream cheese inside. The wonky bacon just wasn't working for me. Tried it again by omitting the bacon and the green onions then added feta cheese with sauteed onions and minced garlic which bumped up the cream cheese filling flavor however the outside chicken breast suffered from lack of flavor. Next time, I might try rolling in bread crumbs or possibly marinading the chicken breast to give it more flavor.

Delicious. I didn't have the ingredients and my youngest hates uncooked onion so I added garlic and herb seasoning to the cream cheese, a drop of olive oil to the breasts, along with some black pepper, completely wrapped on bacon and baked. Very tasty and simple

I made this last night for the second time, Everyone loved it, I made a couple changes by using chive cream cheese and I had to wrap it with more bacon to keep the filling in, but my boyfriend really loves bacon so that was no prob! I also melted a little more of the cream cheese of the top, made a nice presentation.

I played with this and made two different kinds. One was with BBQ Sauce, the other was an Italian version. Both were great, favoring the BBQ one from the other half. What I did, was flatted a breast (one key is here, must be flat!) and filled it with smears of cream cheese, no mixture...after I had seasoned it with garlic powder, onion powder, and black seasoned pepper. On top of that, I poured some BBQ sauce. I rolled the breast, then took a slice a reg bacon and "tied it", did the same the other way around the breast. This helped keep the cream cheese in. For the Italian one, I seasoned the same way, but added some shredded mozarella cheese to the smears of cream cheese, rolled the same way. I made sure all was held together by toothpicks. Baked in the oven with foil on top of pan for about 1/2 hour, then last 10 min with the foil off, at which time I poured just a little BBQ sauce on top of the BBQ ones. Perfect! One note too- let the chicken "rest" a few min before taking the toothpicks out. **These looked like footbals, just in time for the season!

I was looking for a recipe also with just a few ingredients I had available in my fridge. I also mixed in Jalapeno pieces to the cream cheese mixture. To prevent the mix from seeping out I first wrapped the chicken and stuffing in a piece of swiss cheese (the kind you buy already pre-cut) and then wrapped in bacon. This did the trick.

This was quite yummy, though I won't use bacon next time as it was a tad too salty with it for me. The stuffing and chicken go together VERY nicely and my family really enjoyed this one.

I hate when people do this, but I had to.  I didn't have plain cream cheese or chives.  But I had the Philadelphia cream cheese with chives so I used that.  Otherwise I made as directed.  This was great and better the next day.  I'll probably try to wrap more bacon around it and make more at a time for great leftovers.

I didn't have any cream cheese so I used ricotta and mexican velveeta.  I also used turkey bacon and omitted the salt.  This was amazing, and will definitely make this again.

This was delicious, and not difficult to make the only reason I gave it one less star is because I would not make this very often, it was very rich and filling. Maybe a special occasion dish.

It's hard to give this recipe a rating at all because it turned out so bad. I followed the recipe as is, like I always do the first time.  I realized before I finished putting this recipe together that it was doomed. 1. Cooking bacon ahead doesn't allow the flavors to seep into the chicken. 2. Chicken needed seasoning on the outside. 3. Cream cheese was overwhelming. It needs stronger flavors in the mixture to cut the flavor of the cheese. Last but not least, the cook time was to long and cooking it covered  made it very dry. It needs to be cover at first then uncovered to crisp the bacon.  I might try this again because the basic idea is sound it just needs a little modification .

I made this recipe and it turned out quite well.  I used onion and chive cream cheese and also stuffed the chicken with regular mozzarella cheese.  But, I forgot to brown my bacon before cooking in the oven.  Next time, I will remember that.

I was disappointed with this dish - after reading the reviews I was expecting a really great dish with a potent flavor and all I got was chicken that mildly tasted like onions, pepper and garlic. The chicken seemed to leech all the flavor out of the bacon and it all just tasted sort of "blah". It was tender, and not BAD, but just not what the reviews made it out to be.

Excellent! I made a few adjustments. I did not precook the bacon. Since my husband does not like red peppers, I used sun dried tomatoes. I pounded the chicken breasts. And I put the breasts under the broiler to crisp up the bacon. Great recipe!

Big hit here.  The double meat action really excited my boyfriend. However, I think pounding out the chicken a little would have made the rolling part a little easier, or I just had fat little chicken breasts.  Very tasty, will make again.

I made this the other night for dinner and it came out really good. Me and my fiance loved it. The only thing is I thought it called for more than what was needed for the cream cheese to use as the filling. I ended up throwing some out because I had more than what was needed.  DELICIOUS AND WILL BE MAKING THIS AGAIN! THANKS :)

I was lucky enough to have some pretty large chicken breasts so I just made a small cut in the side and made a nice sized pocket to put the stuffing in. Closed easily with one tooth pick. I did brown them in the bacon fat for a couple minutes to give them some color before I wrapped them in bacon and put in the oven. Served with asparagus and roasted potatoes. I was going to have the leftovers the next night but they were gone before I got home.

This was good, I was hoping for a bit more flavor.

Kids liked, hubby and I agreed that chicken itself was flavorless - needs to be marinated or something first.  I also cut out the salt.

Good recipe. Next time I think i'll leave the cream cheese out. It "melted" out of my chicken. :[ I would also recomend cooking the bacon (like half way) before wrapping it around the chicken and baking it because it was still raw after being in the oven for over an hour.

This was ok, not great.  The chicken was moist, but the flavors didn't go together as well as I thought they would.  Probably won't make this again.

It was okay.  I'm going to pound out some round steak and try it with that.  We just thought the chicken ended up kind of bland, but we loved the filling.

Who would ever think that cream cheese and chicken could turn out so good.
Easy and impressive dish for company.
