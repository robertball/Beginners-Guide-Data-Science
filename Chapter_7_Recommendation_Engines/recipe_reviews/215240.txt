Very good recipe, I didn't feel comfortable leaving a jar of cream and milk out even though the vinegar was probably enough to kill bacteria, I cheated I mixed it up with my kitchen aid until it looked like sour cream, and turned out tasting great plus I added a pinch of salt. Thank you for the recipe. 5 stars all the way!

Worked great!  I was a little worried about leaving the ingredients unrefrigerated but it all worked out fine!  This is a little runny compared to store bought, but you at least know what is being used to make it!  Great for baked potatoes!

This works like a charm- very thick and rich! Sterilize your Mason jar. I used buttermilk and a good quality heavy (high butterfat) cream. Secure the lid and canning ring, shake, and let sit on the counter for 24 hours, undisturbed! We can now taste the difference between home made and store bought, and will be using this recipe from here on!

I have tried making this twice and I have had not luck! The first time it did not harden up. The second time it just tasted like cream, not sour cream. I really want this to work. I have followed the recipe, any suggestions?

like another reviewer, I was not comfortable leaving this sit out overnight.  I downsized the recipe to 3/4 cup cream, 3 T milk and 1/2 tsp white vinegar, whizzed it in the magic bullet for maybe 10 seconds total, and this is sour cream!!!!  so handy as I had cream on hand but not sour cream, now I can make one of the mashed potato recipes from this site that look so good and call for sour cream.  thank you!!!!!

This recipe didn't work for me.  I followed it as written. Only thing I may have done differently was use raw cream and raw milk from our cow.  I am not sure if I did something wrong but after 24 hours the cream was still liquid and had a pungent sour smell.

This recipe came in handy not too long ago. I only give it 4 stars because I had to make a few tweaks. It takes about 48 hours for me for the texture to be nearly spot on. At that point I salt to taste and serve. I never knew how easy it was to make sour cream! I am really glad I found this recipe. Thank you for sharing.

*Note- I have made this many times and once tried salting the sour cream at the beginning of the process and it seems to cause it to be super runny. Just FYI.

I sized the recipe for 4 servings. I but it in a medium container and whipped it up with my motor boat. Its like when you do it for whipping cream. I labeled it. I like to know what goes into the sour cream.

Also, try half pint of whipping cream and a splash of lemon juice and salt to taste.  Whip until thick.  Careful not to overdo the lemon.

Thank you for adding this. For whatever reason, I can't get sour cream in Panama. My husband loves sour cream and I found this recipe. It works great and he loves it! He has bragged and bragged on me for making sour cream for him! :-)

I made the recipe as listed, left at room tempurature for 24 hours, then refrigerated for 24 hours. it had a slight twang, but wasn't thickening.  I added 1 Tbsp of lime juice and whipped the cream to just short of stiff peaks. it tastes like sour cream and has nearly the same consistency as store bought, just more airy.   Awesome recipe, just needed some adjustments to be complete.

Does not work and cannot work because vinegar doesn't denature the casein, which is how sour cream is thickened. Cheapy-cheapy fake "frugal" recipe that doesn't actually work.

A better recipe is to add 2 tbsp real, non-powdered, store-bought liquid buttermilk to one cup of body-temperature cream. Cover and let sit at room temperature (NOT IN THE FRIDGE!!!!!!!! This is non-negotiable) for two days.

Complete fail. I should have listened to the reviews, but I was curious. This turned out no thicker than the consistency I started with. The reviewers who did seem to have success had to either tweak ingredients and/or method (increase time on counter, manually whip it to get it thick). Save yourself the aggravation and waste of ingredients. If youâ€™re going to have to wait 24-48 hours anyway for something that may or may not work, youâ€™re better off just driving to the store for sour cream. This also tastes nothing like sour cream. It basically tastes like regular whipping cream and wasnâ€™t sour at all.  I tried this twice,  slightly tweaking the second batch (more vinegar and 48 hours on counter) and both times were fails. I ended up whipping it with my immersion blender, just so I could use it on my baked potato - the only reason why itâ€™s even thick in my photo.

This worked like a charm.  I used ultra pasteurized heavy cream, ultra pasteurized whole milk and I cleaned my jar with scalding hot water before using it.  I also added a pinch of salt.

After 24 hours with the mixture sitting on the counter, it was still the consistency of milk.  So I waited another 24 hours with the covered mixture still sitting on the counter.  This time the consistency was a soft cream and the flavor was excellent: much better than store bought sour cream.

The next time I make this I will wait until consistency is a little thicker still.  I might also add a few drops of lemon juice, but the buttermilk flavor is quite pleasing all by itself.

I followed the recipe to a T and three days in the fridge now and still not stiffened/hardened. Just as runny as the day I put it in.

I use only heavy whipping cream and citric acid. No milk. Sets up well, almost like clotted cream. I recommend not adding milk. Citric acid has a more neutral flavour as opposed to vinegar.

I gave it 4 stars b/c I was in a bit of a hurry, and I had somehow missed the fact that it needed to set for 24 hours at room temp when I had originally looked up the recipe in the store to make sure I had the ingredients before getting home. I ended up adding about 3 x (give or take) the white distilled vinegar & whipping it with a fork to boost the processing & thickening time. It worked like a charm! I also added a pinch of kosher sea salt. I will DEF make it this way again... it was sooo creamy and rich. YUMMY!

Easy to do and I had first pass success w/the thickening but it still tastes very much like cream.  How do you get it to sour?  I used lemon juice ... wondering if vinegar is better, or maybe starting with buttermilk instead of cream.  Suggestions wanted!

It was not quite .. tart enough. 

I used crÃ¨me fraÃ®che Ã©paisse for the heavy cream and used the whip-it rather than the sit 24 hours method.

I have used sour milk using white vinegar for a substitute for buttermilk for ages. Buttermilk is just not a good as it used to be, just read the label. So I was glad to see this recipe for sour cream. Thank you. It works just fine.

Hopefully, around 9:30/9:45p on tomorrow, I can have a nice baked potato. I'm super excited! Wondering if I can leave it on a table as it sits until tomorrow night... :/

Recipe turned out very well!  

We keep our house pretty cold during the winter, so it did take a little over two days on the counter to get firm, but it is now nearly as thick store bought (I can hold it upside down).  It'll probably go faster in summer.  I also found recipes online that whipped theirs for "instant" sour cream, so if yours comes out runny, whip it a little.  
I used ACV because it's healthier, and I have it on hand since I make that also.  I added extra at the end because there wasn't a strong enough flavor for me, (pure preference - I like it very tangy) and a big pinch of salt.  Tastes pretty good!  As for it not working because of various "science" reasons - it works.  Mine thickened (with a little extra time).  Soured. And, even after being on the counter for two days, didn't make anyone sick.

The first time it was runny then whipped the heavy cream and it worked better also had to add a little bit more vinegar to make it sour.

Recipe may be great but my cream got frozen so when I went to make it had separated into butter and whey...I heated till the butter melted and ran it through a blender...then carried on. The results will work but the sour cream is not so great.
I will try again...

I followed this recipe except I used almond milk instead of cow's milk. I know that changes the fat content so thaybmay be why it wasn't that thick. Yet and still, I  very satisfied with the end results. I would like to know how long can this sit in the fridge?
