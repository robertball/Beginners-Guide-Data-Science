good basic recipe not unlike many others I have tried. I did like the addition of the  bananas. I added some chopped walnuts and put some crushed vanilla wafers mixed with a little butter on top of the whipped cream. I will use again as a base.

Yummy~! I used real strawberries, sugar free jello and Fat Free Cool Whip! This healthy dessert fulfilled my sugar cravings and is packed with healthy fruit! It was super easy too! Not just for valentines day, this dessert is perfect for a cool summer treat!

Light and refreshing jello salad.  I used sugar-free jello to help cut back on calories.  In this family it is hard to go wrong with any kind of jello.
Thanks for sharing the recipe.

My family loved this.  Was a little concerned at how long it took to firm up (a lot longer than plain jello) and was glad that I had made this the day before wanting to serve it.

I love these recipe. It's easy to make and it's very healthy. I also tired it with blueberries. It's taste great too.
