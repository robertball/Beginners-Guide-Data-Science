I wanted to make this for our 4th of July party, but the website was down and I couldn't access the recipe.  So, I managed to put together what I could remember from reading the recipe one time! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is my version is a little different..but still great!  I did not use jalapenos or peppers--but green onions and tomatoes.  I also improvised a dressing with sour cream, salsa, and Ranch mixed together.  The last difference was I used bow-tie pasta. I refrigerated it overnight, then just before serving added the shredded cheese.  It was a huge hit!

Next time I make this, I would use less red peppers, they were kind of overpowering. I also skipped the ranch dressing and olives which left it a little dry. Next time, I am thinking maybe some sour cream! After that, it would definitely be a 5 star recipe in my book!

I made this for dinner last night, but it seemed odd to have ground beef in a cold salad, so I served it warm, straight from the skillet, and called it "Tex Mex Pasta Skillet" instead.  I didn't have any pickled jalapenos, so I used a can of green chilies instead.  I think I only used 1/2 of the recommended amount of salsa.  My family like it!  It was warm and filling on a cold winter day.

I made this for a family picnic.  Everyone loved it and wanted it again.  All I had the second time was hot salsa, instead of mild and used it.  I learned it was not as good this way.  I stick to the recepie sicne then and there is not a drop left.  I worried about the cold hamburger the first time and no one seemed to care.  The taste is just so good.  I lost track of my recepie and was so glad to see it was still on here.
