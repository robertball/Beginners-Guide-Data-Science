Way too much sugar. I only added 1/2 cup of Stevie. No pectin so added a 1/2 teaspoon of agar. Simmering under low heat for 15 minutes or until the jam thickens up. Good recipe. We used 500 grams of dried apricots and 2 large cans of apricots in heavy syrup. We discarded the syrup. Good recipe. No bwb bath. Just put in Ball pint jars and into the fridge.

Thank goodness I found this recipe as I don't know what I would have done with the organic, unsulfured dried apricots my husband brought home one day. They sounded wonderful, but they tasted terrible...so I made apricots into jam! I didn't have any pectin, so I grated in an apple and used a bit of tapioca flour to help it congeal. I also used almond extract as I had more of that on hand than vanilla. Finally I  only had enough apricots to make about a cup of jam, so I just popped it in the fridge when I finished making it and we enjoyed it for the next week. All in all, a lifesaver...thank you Cookin4Six! for sharing this recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly. It tastes just like dried apricots, so if you like dried apricots, you'll love the jam, too. Like Jessica Paige, I made it solely to use up some unappetizing looking dried apricots. I've used up all he jam now, and I like it so much that I went out and bought dried apricots so I could make another batch!

I make a lot of fruit jams every year and I LOVE dried apricots and apricot jam so I thought I'd see if there was a recipe for Dried Apricot Jam on the Web.  Sure enough, here it is on All Recipes!!!  This is a delicious jam made exactly as written and I've received rave reviews from everyone I've gifted it to.  I'll be making a large batch in the next couple of days and canning it in a boiling water bath for gifts at Christmas and all year round!  Oh yes, and a few for my husband and me as well!!! ; )  Can't wait for this and some strawberry-rhubarb jam, too!

To reduce sugar by half go ahead and substitute flavored liquor in place of lemon juice and omit vanilla. I used peach schnapps. You may add more sugar if fruit was tart but keep it at 4 cups maximum. Then itâ€™s five stars plus.

I made this.  I got this huge bag of dried Turkish apricots from Amazon because I got tired of buying my jam fro Walmart.  Was really impressed.  On thing that should be on the recipe is once you start combing the apricots and sugar you have to constantly stir the mixture.  The bottom of mine got burnt twice.  I only had the pot on medium and it says to has to boil.  I will be much more careful on the next batch.
