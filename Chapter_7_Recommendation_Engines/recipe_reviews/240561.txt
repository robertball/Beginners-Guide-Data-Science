The only change I made was to use fresh peaches. The flavor was good, but the cobbler never set after cooking for 3 1/2 minutes.  Not a favorite of mine.

Amazing! Probably not a good thing that I tried this recipe! Now I can have peach cobbler any time I want.  I used milk instead of water and it came out perfect.

I loved it, I added a bit more milk( I used milk instead of water),  chopped a couple walnuts, and used a fresh peach. I put peaches in bottom of cup, and stirred it up just a little. Cooked 2 min on high. A few seconds less probably would be better. It was done and delicious with ice cream!

I used wet milk instead of dry milk powder, so I'm gonna try this again sometime.

I only used 1/2 T of sugar, and it was sweet enough for me. It's not the best mug dessert I've ever made, but I will probably try it again some time.  Overall, nice flavor, and the texture was fine for me.

I really wanted to like this and have a new addition to the things my kids can make in a mug collection but something is off about the recipe. The cobbler was a gummy cake with warm peaches on top. The flavors were ok but it needs some tweaking and possibly cooked a tad longer...not sure...
