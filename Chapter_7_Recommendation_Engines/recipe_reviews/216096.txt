Very hearty soup... followed the recipe closely (although I used red potatoes over russet) and everyone thought it was delicious.  Thanks!

This recipe took longer than the stated 1 hour and 35 minutes. From stove to table it was about 2 1/2 hours for me. I don't know how you could do it in 1 hour and 35 minutes unless you have pre-cooked bacon and a stick blender. If you have a regular blender or food processor, it takes some time to puree the batches. And the result of the pureeing was a consistency of leeky Cream of Wheat with too much milk added. Not visually appealing or texturally desirable.

I followed this recipe exactly and found that the delicious flavor of my smoked turkey legs was almost completely masked by the taste of the leeks. I would have been better off not putting those delicious guys in the soup at all and using them in another recipe so I could enjoy them. 

If I were you,I would find another potato-leek soup recipe. If you happen to have it, the leek and potato soup recipe in Dorie Greenspan's "Around My French Table" (page 66) is a good one. Otherwise, look elsewhere, friend, look elsewhere. This "Meaty Potato Leek Soup" recipe is not awesome and it takes a ton of time.
