I didn't have any cooking wine, so I just used water, and the family doesn't like mushrooms, so I left them out.  Otherwise it was great - I can see all kinds of other add-ins to change it to suit my fancy of the day...like maybe 1/2 cup frozen peas, or 1/4 cup crumbled bacon.

This was good - a good reliable side dish.  A nice way to incorporate brown rice.

This was a good combo pilaf. I prepared it as published. I thought it could use some more flavor and my wife thought it was fine. I have frozen the left overs for future use.

My husband wanted a healthier side dish to serve with prime rib. I've made this twice in two weeks since this is a perfect lunch to take to work with veggies. I omitted the carrots since I served them in a spring veggie dish, and used fresh thyme. The local grocery store was sold out of crimini mushrooms, so I subbed in baby portabella mushrooms. I cook this in the microwave though, which is my new favorite way to cook rice.  Thank you for this awesome potato replacement recipe!

Made this as written except I used regular mushrooms and a dry white wine that I had on hand...otherwise followed all ingredients and measurements. Timing was perfect.  All rices were done. If you like the flavor of wild rice this is really a good recipe.

Might have been five stars if I'd had followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't have the right mushrooms or any carrots :(   I also added some fresh chopped parsley.  Still, one of the tastiest wild rice recipes ever, or my changes wouldn't have worked.  Compliments to the original chef.

i chose this recipe bc i had some leftover white wine that i wanted to use up.. i cut this in half and used all white rice (1 cup).. i subbed chopped onion for the mushrooms.. used 1.5 cups water and the half cup of wine.. i was worried about it lacking salt/flavor as some commented and added 2 tsp chicken bouillon instead of 1.5 tsp.. next time i would reduce it a bit as it was a little on the salty side..  it makes me think of rice my mom or gram would make.. thank you for keeping me from throwing out that last bit of wine and making good use of it!

I substituted a pinot grigio for the cooking wine.  I would make this to serve to company.

Delicious!  I made it according to the recipe, except I could not find crimini mushrooms, so I substituted baby bella mushrooms.  I think that one could leave out the butter at the end to reduce the fat.

Delicious! I followed the recipe more closely than usual, although I did substitute vegetable broth and since I didn't have any white rice I used brown rice and wild rice so had to adjust cooking times a bit.  I also stirred in some leftover cooked quinoa near the end for extra protein. Makes a great meatless entree on its own or served inside of baked squash halves.

Fantastic..only change was exchanging quinoa for brown rice..good flavor, consistency+ quinoa gave it a little protein boost.

Didn't have wild rice but was pretty good as is. Needed a bit of salt. My chicken broth wasn't salty enough and the kids and hubby grabbed the soy sauce. My daughter hated it the look of it but didn't try it. This is common and more a note to self. :)
