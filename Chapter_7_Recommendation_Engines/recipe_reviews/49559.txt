I pulled a Rachael Ray and did a caramelization of the onion with some garlic (I used a huge onion and three cloves minced garlic) and just let it hang out in the skillet for about 25 minutes. I used half FF sour cream and half NF plain yogurt. Couldn't even tell that it was lower in fat. Little sea salt and fresh ground pepper and you have a nom-worthy dip. We ate it with Romanitas and pita chips.

With some revisions, I used this recipe at my last superbowl party and it turned out great!!  People are funny about yogurt, so instead of 2 cups yogurt, I added 1 cup yogurt and 1 cup lowfat sourcream.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1 tsp onion powder to add more flavor.  The flavor will intensify if refrigerated for a day.  I loved the sauted onions, nice touch.

Great dip! You can trick people into snacking healthy. I did a few things different that makes it even better. Instead of using butter, I used like half the amount of peanut oil (1 tablespoon). I used half shallot/half onion,and I cooked them for a really long time on low heat until caramelized, then deglazed with white vermouth. I also left out the vinegar. This is a versatile dip, but I think the best thing about it is that it can be made extremely low fat, and it still tastes great!

What a great dip! nobody can believe it's made with yogurt, and it tastes a lot better than anything made with onion soup mix. I suggest adding a sprinkle of chopped parsley or minced green onion for color.

Appreciated a healthier onion dip.  Made 24 hours in advance for a dinner party and, though it was complimented by the guests, a lot was left over.  I'm still eating it.  You can't tell it's yogurt and it tastes almost like sour cream and onion.  Maybe I'm too used to sour cream, but it just seemed to be missing something.

Excellent dip Emily! I love yogurt so this was no problem for me. I too strained out the liquid overnite using cheesecloth as I like my dips on the thicker side. I added garlic and onion powders and chopped green onion for a bit of color. Delish!

What a difference it makes to saute the onions-- wonderful onion flavor yet sweet-- delicious.  I cheated and made the recipe with sour cream but it was a hit so it was woth it.  I also added fresh finely diced cilantro. Kudos to a simple yet great tasting dip recipe.

Delicious -- use plain GREEK yogurt for a thicker dip.  Adding one tablespoon of sour cream to the yogurt imparts a distinctly "sour cream" flavor to the entire dip.  This was delish!

This is a healthy alternative for those who like an onion flavored dip.  It has a "real deal" taste factor too.

Very happy with this dip recipe.  A little runny for my taste, so I placed half of the yogurt over cheese cloth overnight to drain some excess liquid.  Mixed it all together in the morning and was the perfect consistency!  Thanks.

This pretty tasty for yogurt...I am a HUGE sour cream fan.  I follwed the recipe exactly but next time a may toss in some herbs just for a different flavour.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm sure there would be a difference if you used sour cream instead of plain yogurt. But that would be defeating the purpose and that's not what this recipe calls for. I think this recipe is great and I'm grateful that it doesn't call for sour cream because I live in Kenya, where you can't get sour cream. Maybe I've been away from the States for a while because this recipe was excellent to me and I don't think you need the sour cream. At least try it with the yogurt first to see if you like it. Thanks, Emily, for the fantastic recipe!

It does thicken up a bit after standing overnight and the onion flavor does increase.  Still I could not fool myself into thinking this was "real" onion dip.  Not even close.  This might go good as a spread for a gyro.  Very health dip I must admit

I made two versions of this recipe.  One exactly as the recipe is written and one with half nonfat plain yogurt and half reduced fat sour cream.  The one with the sour cream was much creamier and richer than the one with all yogurt, although it did have a lot more calories.  I also added a few cloves of diced garlic to each of them since I felt like it was missing a little something.  With the addition of garlic, I would make either version again!

Very good. The yogurt should be drained and some hot sauce should be added.

This was ok, but IMO, it was quite bland...like it was missing something. I ended up adding some green onions, garlic powder, parmesan cheese and a little dry ranch dressing mix to give this some more flavor. I agree, it's definately healthy, but sort of lacking flavor-wise. After the additions, I was more pleased with it. Thanks for sharing. :)

We drained the yogurt as some have suggested, and love the results!  Instead of salt, we used an herb seasoning. This is a great onion dip!

This was a very easy and tasty dip. I used sour cream instead of yogurt. I will try it again adding garlic. I think that addition will boost it to a 5-star.

This was good, but I couldn't help but think, "Something's missing." That "something" is sour cream. This would've been awesome with sour cream! My husband loved this recipe, saying it remined him of the processed store-bought onion dip he ate as a kid.

for those insisting on sour cream, why not use non fat or reduced fat sour cream? I'm sure Emily's Onion Dip was to keep it low fat by using the yogurt. (smile)

So while the recipe calls for using yogurt to make it healthier and lower in fat, I could not help but use sour cream instead.  It was awesome with the freshly sauteed onions and the longer it sat in the refrigerator, the better it tasted!  We liked this served with potato chips.
