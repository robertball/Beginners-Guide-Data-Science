I was pleasantly surprised by this, as was my Italian husband. When he saw me making the peas and pancetta mixture, he said, "you're making penne with that right?" He was leery of the ramen noodles, but you know what? It works! My son thought it was "weird", but both my husband and I agreed that it was something that we'd make again. I just happened to stumble across this recipe, as I was looking for a way to use up some pancetta that I had in the fridge to use up. Glad I found this! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly as written & neither I nor my daughter cared for it. Waaayy to greasy. I am followed recipe from the magazine but I agree with other reviewers that the bacon should be cooked separate then added in. Also more ramen or less broth. 
I wouldn't make again though. Just wasn't for us.

Way too much broth and I didn't use the full 3 cups. If I try it again, I would use 2 packages of ramen noodles and 2 cups of broth. (Easy to add more broth.)

Reduced broth to 2 cups, made 2 packages of ramen, but would add 1 more if I were to make it again. Everyone loved the flavor, but quantity of noodles was lacking.

I used bacon, doubled the noodles and added a jar of mushrooms & 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Plus I boiled the noodles about 10 minutes so it wasn't so soupy. Will definitely make again.

Regretfully we did not care for this recipe.  We were super excited to try it based on the photo-  we found it to be way too soupy even after following the recipe to a T.  I even added extra Parmesan to try to thicken after it sat several minutes off the heat.  The ramen noodles were way too mushy.  I did add diced grilled chicken for extra protein and substance.

4 stars because it needed tweaking.  But it was still delicious. 
Pancetta would give this dish a better flavor, but I was out of pancetta.  I used bacon instead, cooking it a little longer than recommended.  I also cut down the broth to 2 cups and added  additional ramen noodles.  We love Parmesan so I was very generous with it.  Fresh ground pepper is very important to this dish, it wouldn't do to substitute or leave it out.

This had really great flavor!  I doubled the recipe but only used 2 c. of broth.  I think next time I'll add another package of noodles.  Thanks for the recipe!

Bacon needs to be cooked separately and added at the end.  Way too much broth called for - needs to be cut in half at least or add another package of ramen noodles.  The flavor was pretty good though.

I made this last night.  Quick and easy with good flavor.  I agree,  the bacon needs to be cooked longer and the water is way too much.  I'll make again using 1 1/2 or 2 cups of water.

This was pretty good. I used bacon instead of pancetta, & I used a whole cup cause we like bacon. I cooked it until the bacon was crisp (way longer than just a few minutes). Also, 3 cups of stock waaaay too much. I used 2 packages of ramen and about 2 1/2 cups of stock & it was perfect. Made a little sauce but wasn't overly runny. I hate peas & I barely tasted them, so for me that's a good thing. This is a quick, "throw it together" recipe.

Very runny. I even cut down on the liquid by 1/2 cup. Just not worth making again.

OK, I made this for dinner this evening,  What I didn't like was the soggy bacon. Next time, I will cook the bacon til crisp, remove from pan and fry the onions in the bacon grease. Then I will throw it in at the end,  to keep it fairly crispy.  I also added another pkg. of Ramen noodles because there was way too much liquid at the end.  Next time I will start with 2 c. of broth, then if I need more, I can add. Overall, this was good, although the cheese sticks to the bottom of the pan.  I may add some other spice next time, maybe some garlic pepper (Tastefully Simple)

I made this for dinner tonight after receiving my magazine in the mail today.  I was surprised to really enjoy it. I used bacon and doubled the amount as we are big fans. I forgot to add the noodles to the bacon onion mixture and let cook for a bit, I just added the noodles and broth at the same time.  Then, I was a bit weirded out by the soggy bacon and thought I was going to be turned off- but I finished out the recipe, I did double the noodles and did not double the broth. After adding the parmesan, I was left with a thick creamy sauce. My son loved it, my picky child only like it. I loved it, and I feel like this has given ramen some new uses. My husband is still working in the yard, but I will update after he puts his 2 cents in.
