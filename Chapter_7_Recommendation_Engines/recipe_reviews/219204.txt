This dish is AWESOME. My husband and I cooked it on a whim because we wanted to just cook with what we had lying around the house, and this dish is now a staple for our family. Serve it with some green bean casserole, and not only is it sinfully delicious, but it makes great leftovers as well. Kudos on your creativity and this amazing recipe!

This recipe was good but not fantastic. I made it exactly as written. I had to bake for 45 minutes due to the fact that my chicken breasts were big and not quite done at the 30 minute mark. 

I may try this recipe again using pork chops instead of chicken.

This was pretty good.  I made it for a couple of friends and they really enjoyed it.  I am a big fan of cheese so the more the merrier! :)

This recipe was a great inspriation for what i ended up making for dinner. I made the stuffing mixture leaving out the wine because i didnt want it to be too watery, I and for the cheese i just shredded up some motz. and peper jack, it looked really mushy (im sure if i added more stuffing too it it would have been fine) but  instead i thought it would be really good as a "stuffing" so i cut the breasts in half then sliced out pockets taking up as much chicken as possible and stuffed them as full as i could!! then i used the left over stuffing (which was about a box half of it not cooked) i crushed the uncooked portion and added it and breadcrumbs to the cooked stuffing making a really nice coating on the chicken i used 1 egg and it. dressing to hold it on. This whole process made quite a mess (as im a little messy while cooking). I baked on 350 for about 40 mins on a baking sheet and reheated some rice and made chicken gravy to put over it and it was FREAKING AMAZING the family and friends i had over all loved it i had no leftovers!! And i was worried i made too much will def make again!!

This is really easy and good.  The second time, I made it, I made a few changes -- I now brown the chicken breast before baking them and I sprinkle Italian seasonings over them before adding the cheese (basil, oregano, etc.).  I also switched to Cream of Celery soup because I realized we don't really like Cream of Mushroom but I have added sauteed mushrooms, which really enhance the flavour.

Very good and simple to make. the breasts I use aren't cooked until an hour. I will be browning them next time.

30 minutes is not even close, try 60

A nice easy and quick recipe for a bachelor like myself. I would rank it as good, but not great. Next time I make it I think I will try marinating my chicken breast first. Again, not a bad recipe by any means.

This is yummy! I made it using 3 bigger chicken breasts so I cooked it for 35 min to make sure they were cooked all the way through. I forgot to add the white wine to the soup so I drizzled it over the top before baking it and it turned out fine. Next time I will add some Mrs. Dash or a similiar seasoning to the chicken to add some flavor.
