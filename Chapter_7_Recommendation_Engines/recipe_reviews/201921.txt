I usually do not try recipes that have not been reviewed but I was out of time and this was the first 'from scratch' non chocolate cupcake recipe I came across. It was worth it. They were fluffy, not dry, and delicious. Slightly 'crisp' on the outside and moist on the inside. Tasted like they were from a bakery and not from a box. I did make a few substitutions but I don't think it effected it. I did not have self rising flour and used regular white flour but added 1 tsp baking powder for every cup of flour plus added an additional half tsp of salt. I also did not have lemons but used lemon juice (store bought) and halved the amount for the zest. This review is for the cupcake as I had left over frosting and so used that.

I did not have self rising flour , so I used all purpose with 1 tsp baking powder for each cup of flour, and used orange juice and orange zest instead of the lemon. Its one of the most delicious and moist cupcakes I have ever made and its one for keeps.

everyone loved this! Smells good, tastes even better. I added 1 more tbsp of lemon zest and 2 more tbsp of lemon juice. It's perfect even without the icing.

Oh my! I always cut the fat/butter in every single recipe by 1/2 - dessert or savory - and have no problem. However, since this was my son's 1st birthday and I wanted the cupcakes to be PERFECT, I decided to bite the bullet and put in the whole amount! CRAZY! WAAAAY too much butter! The oils were leaking through the paper liners! That was disappointing. I will make them again but next time? MY way!!

I love these cupcakes!!  I've made them twice in the last month, and was thrilled with them both times.  They are slightly dense, but I think that is typical of baked goods made from scratch.  The 2nd time I made them I added a bit more lemon juice, and my husband said they were even better.  Don't worry if you don't have the self-rising flour - adding a tsp of baking powder for each cup of flour works just fine.  And I loved the lemony whipped cream frosting.  Terrific!  Thanks for sharing!!

This is a beautiful cake I would not hesitate to recommend or to make again. It’s moist, not too fluffy yet not too dense. It has that wonderful richness only butter can contribute and just the right level of fresh citrus flavor (I used lime rather than lemon).  I did take the plunge and buy self-rising flour for these, as my understanding is the protein content is different – much closer to cake flour than all purpose. In other words, just adding leaveners  to all purpose flour supposedly won’t duplicate it exactly even tho’ it's an acceptable substitute.   I frosted these with Easy Cream Cheese Frosting, also from this site, to which I added a tablespoon of grated lime zest.   This cake and that frosting?  The perfect combo.

I thought these were really good.  This cupcake is more of a grownup cupcake, something you'd serve adults. The batter for these cupcakes was awesome.  My daughter could not stop eating the batter, she thought the cupcakes were good but would have preferred just eating the batter.

I just made these and they came out perfect.  I added a spoonful of vanilla pudding in the middle of each cupcake before icing.

These were light, fluffy, lemony, and delicious! Unfortunately I overfilled my small cupcake tins, and the tops became crusty and dry.  Do NOT fill them any more than 3/4 as the self-rising flour definitely rises! I made plain icing and flavored it with the left over lemon juice and zest.  It you like your cupcakes sweet, then icing is a must--The batter would also work well for lemon poppy seed muffins, I think, because my cupcakes, at least, weren't super sweet.  The batter by itself was great, too though--definitely take the time to lick the spoon! :D

EXCELLENT! I did lower the baking temp to 350, but otherwise, I followed the directions exactly and these were great. They were a big hit in my house. My mother ate a 1/2 dozen of them the first night I made them. They're more of a "grown up" cupcake because they are not overly sweet and the lemon was very subtle, one might consider adding more for a stronger lemon flavor. The icing was DELICIOUS. I ate a lot of it before it could make it onto the cupcakes. 

I've made a lot baked goods from this website and have only been moderately impressed. These cupcake have been the best recipe I have found on here so far. Really superb.

I'll give this four stars instead of three for two reasons: one, I didn't use self-rising flour, which might have contributed to how dense they turned out (quite disappointing, considering I was expecting something light and fluffy); and two, because they got better the longer I kept them. I used a recipe for raspberry buttercream that I had on hand and the flavors worked beautifully together, especially after a day or two in the fridge, and went great with a cup of unsweetened tea. A lot of people thought they were too sweet, but I liked them well enough.

I Made these for a friend to bring to a bridal shower and she reported they were a HUGE hit! I did add a little lemon extract just to make sure they were lemony enough :) I used the lemonade frosting recipe from this site and also added a little lemon extract to that but otherwise followed the recipes exactly. One of the party guests was on a gluten- free diet and ate the frosting off of several cupcakes! Just a tip to anyone who said their cupcakes were dense not airy: YOU MUST BEAT THE SUGAR AND BUTTER VERY WELL TO GET THE RIGHT TEXTURE. ALSO BEAT IN THE EGGS WELL TO GET AIR INTO THE BATTER. This ensures your cupcakes will be light and airy. :)

I baked this into a cake. Very light and yummy.. The lemon taste is very mild. I like the tang of lemon but mild is also nice.. Will definitely be making it again..

This recipe is definitely delicious and easy to make. I used a pancake mix (here in Japan they work pretty much like self-rising flour but with added sugar so I didn't have to use baking powder), Lessen the sugar to just 1 1/4 cups. I got a hint to make this cake moister by scalding the milk and pouring it last (This idea came from the Extreme Chocolate Cake recipe that called for boil water in the recipe) 

This really made the cupcakes moister and softer. Try it! And thanks for sharing the recipe ;)

These cupcakes are amazing.  My husband usually isn't into sweets but loves lemon, and my inlaws would always make a box lemon cake for his birthday, so I offered to make cupcakes one year and found these.  They are now my go-to anytime I need to make something that I know will turn out perfect.  Following the recipe exactly gave me great results, but I prefer a ton of lemon flavor so I now add more juice and zest.  I've gotten such rave reviews about them that I now use them as a base for anything, I've filled them with raspberry and whipped cream filling, coconut, cream cheese frostings, chocolate ganache, etc and they've always been great, but really... they're perfect on their own.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Great recipe! I made these last night and tried them today and they are delicious. I made one alteration to the recipe by using half a cup of applesauce and half a cup of butter in place of a full cup of butter. I find the applesauce keeps the cupcakes and cakes more moist, makes them more healthy, and you don't even miss the butter. Next time I will add more lemon juice and lemon zest as I like a stronger lemon taste.  I made a lemon buttercream frosting to go with them that was excellent (3.75 c. Confections sugar, 1 c. Butter softened, 1 tbsp heavy whipping cream, 1/8 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla, and juice & zest of 1 lemon). I'll be making these cupcakes again. Thanks!

Love, love, LOVE this recipe!!!! I only had normal flour, so I used 1 teaspoon baking powder per cup extra! The batter was so light and fluffy and sooo much, it almost overflowed my bowl :-) I got 36 little cupcakes out of it. And one thing was VERY interesting...using convection made them come out with a leveled top and using normal heat made them dome and crack like muffins!!!

I read a bunch of reviews before I baked these cupcakes. I added more lemon zest and juice. Substituted AP flour + 1 tsp baking powder per cup. For the frosting I did a traditional buttercream frosting with lemon juice added to it. They are absolutely delicious!!

I greased the pan, but these stuck like crazy! The tops did not become golden before the edges started to be overdone. I had to use the cupcakes for trifle.

Tasty! So moist and delicious- waaaay better than the dry chocolate cupcakes I tried before them. I made them with cream cheese icing, although i did barely have enough batter to fill the cups 3/4 of the way. I'd say adjust the recipe to 1 or 2 more cupcakes than you need to make.

This will be my go-to for lemon cupcakes.  I got about 30 from this recipe.   I did not find them dense at all.  When I use the creaming method - as this recipe requires, make sure that the butter and eggs are at room temp.  Cream the butter and sugar together for 2 - 3 minutes, and do fully incorporate one egg at a time.  This is the stage where we get all the air in to the batter.   Work quickly with the flour, milk, and lemon juice additions, stirring as little as possible to thoroughly combine.   Over mixing at this point activates the gluten in the flour and makes denser cake.   

I added two tablespoons of good lemon extract.  I removed a bit of each cupcake from the center with an apple corer, and filled them with lemon curd.   I topped them with Italian Meringue frosting, and served them as Lemon Meringue Cupcakes - reminiscent of the Lemon Meringue Pie I grew up on. 

yum.

Excellent! Very light and fluffy. I didn't have self-rising flour, so I used 3 cups of flour plus 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and an extra 1/2 tsp salt. I baked these for about 12 minutes because they started browing around the sides. I used lemon cream cheese frosting- very delicious!

Very good. Mine didn't come out dense at all, like some other reviewers have experienced. 
They actually do get better the day after I baked them! 
I think if I leave out the lemon, I found my new basic cupcake recipe.

Tips for you...First I didn't have self-rising flour, so I used 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1 pinch of salt per cup of flour (total 4 1/2 tsp baking powder and 3 pinches of salt).  I used 1 large lemon and had some extra lemon juice and extra lemon zest.  I used all of it, so as not to waste :)  To put the cupcake batter into the paper baking cups, I used an ice cream scoop (I use "If You Care" brand Unbleached, chlorine-free large baking cups and everything comes out of these perfectly -no sticking).  I ended up with 24 cup cakes.  Cooked them 17 min and they were ready to come out - toothpick was clean -then let sit for the extra 10 minutes recommended.  Had to try one before icing, and the cake was very light and spongy - not too lemony at all! After the cakes were cool, I made the icing - it was stiff enough but lacked lemony flavor, so I added a little more lemon juice which caused the  icing to be less stiff - next time I would add extra lemon at the start, then it might be stiff enough at the end.  My folks are big lemon lovers and they both said: "These are good!"  They are a delicate cupcake - not heavy, the icing is not too sweet, but needs more lemon flavor.  All in all, a good recipe!

This icing is outstanding.  I added three drops of lemon extract to pump up the lemon flavor.

Brilliant! These were a little more work than your average cupcake, but then again, this ain't your average cupcake. Very pleased with how these turned out. I have been 'shopping' for just the right recipe for my mom's 70th b-day cakes.. this is it. I made them completely per recipe; they are light, airy and refreshing. I sprinkled a little lemon zest on top of each...may try to find some yellow sprinkles or lemonhead candies for next batch. These are perfect for summer. Baked up in a little less time than indicated...ovens vary so just keep an eye on your first pan. Thanks for sharing this one!
Update - made them again today for the party tomorrow. Few tips - I made all mini c-cakes because its a luncheon party and we're having like finger sandwiches and stuff, so they took a little less time to bake and definitely turned heat down to about 350. Also, because I won't be able to keep them refrigerated, I went with a different icing - just a lemon buttercream. Do like the one on the recipe better for taste, but the b.c. will be easier to decorate with. These will be a hit tomorrow, thanks agian.

Great recipe! I baked them for the first time for a big party, and received a couple of compliments. I did adjust the recipe by reducing the sugar and the butter, each by about 10-20% (I scaled the recipe up to 40 cupcakes, but still just used 2 cups sugar and 1 cup butter) and they came out fine. It is just a personal preference as I don't like my cupcakes too fatty or sweet. I also adapted the flour by using plain flour, but adding 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt for every cup of plain flour I used.

They taste fine without icing (I just topped it with chocolate sprinkles) - again, a personal preference. I was a bit worried about it being too plain, but simple is good! The lemon zest in the batter made a HUGE difference. I think next time I will consider adding poppy seeds for additional texture and flavour, or do something with lime for some variation (e.g. lime zest, lime glazing). Yum!

I made these cupcakes for my daughter's first birthday and they stole the show! I made some changes because we like our baked goods full of flavor, but with less sugar. So, I decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup less sugar in the batter and doubled the zest and lemon juice. I made a cream cheese frosting and added more lemon juice and zest until I got a lemony punch.  Cream cheese frosting recipe, 8.0z cream cheese softened, 1 stick butter softened. 2 cups powdered sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Lemon juice and zest of 1-2 lemons. Whip together. Enjoy

Have made these twice and just had a request for another batch.  Used regular flour and added 3 tsp baking powder as others suggested.  Changed the recipe to make them into Pink Lemonade Cupcakes:  skipped salt (I never use it), lemon zest and lemon juice. Used 3/4 c of buttermilk, and 1/4 c plus 2 1/2 tablespoons of pink lemonade from concentrate (thawed). Added a small amount of pink food coloring.   Served with lemon buttercream icing.  Had rave reviews every time.  Very light and fluffy (I beat the sugar and butter together for two minutes). Froze well so I could ice later.

What a great recipe, love baking from scratch. I had to improvise slightly based on what I had on hand. 1st of all, I cut the recipe in half and made 36 mini cupcakes. I didn't have self-rising flour so used regular flour with 1-1/2 tsp baking powder and an extra pinch of salt. I had to use orange zest because that's all I had. I also had plain white frosting that I had to use up, so I used that and topped it with sour lemon gummies and sprinkles of crushed lemon hard candies. It was very good and I can imagine I'd love it even more with lemon zest.

I added alot more lemon and these were pretty good. I thought they were just a little too chewy instead of cakey, but that may have been my fault from overstirring. I'll probably make these again.

Great flavor and texture.  I even used a little more lemon juice (fresh) in the cupcakes and the flavor was fantastic.  They were a big hit at my granddaughters graduation party - Gone In Flash

Making these I was back in my Nanna's kitchen as she creamed by hand the butter and sugar to make the lightest most delicious cup cakes.  Was tempted to half the butter as suggested..it was for a special occasion with a sensational result.  Did add the extra lemon juice and rind and am thinking next time to maybe add a little more. Love the recipe. At last cup cakes like Nanna made. Can you picture your Nanna bowl in the crook of her elbow creaming the butter and sugar with the heat of her hand? Not acceptable these days and yet we weren't ever ill.  Carol.

The cupcakes themselves are beautiful. Soft, fluffy, moist, and delicious. The only thing I changed was to add an extra Tbsp of zest and 2 extra Tbsp of lemon juice. The Frosting was more like whipped cream than frosting, and that was after I added an additional 3/4 of powdered sugar to try and get a firmer consistancy. It's wonderful and light but wouldn't hold up well in warmer weather unless served immediately. If making these a day in advance or for an outdoor summer party I would suggest a lemon glaze or thicker frosting. The end result was wonderful though and I will make the cupcakes again, just different frosting.

To make these truly decadent, i trim off the cupcake tops and put in a spoonful of lemon curd or pie filling, then return the top cut in half and placed on the curd like butterfly wings.  Then dust with icing sugar. I have tried many lemon cupcake recipes in an effort to duplicate one from a bakery I worked in years back.This is finally it.  Delicious and light.

I baked this into 2 round cakes for 37 minutes and it got a little dark, I'll reduce the oven temp to 350º next time.  Oh, and I also didn't have self-rising flour on hand, so I used the standby 1 c AP flour + 1 1/2 tsp baking powder + 1/2 tsp salt = 1 c self rising flour.  But this is an amazingly fluffy cake!  Think angel food cake, without the density/sponginess.  This cake is heavenly!

These were great cupcakes.  They were light and fluffy and had a nice flavor.  I baked them on 350 F because I thought 375 F seemed high.  I don't buy self rising flour, but there is an easy substitution online (flour, salt and baking powder).  I also found my cupcake liners were oily, but after they sat for a while they were fine.  I am rating only the cupcake because I used a different frosting.

These cakes were just perfect.  I wanted to make a cupcake that was light, fresh and not fussy.  I think I found the perfect cupcake here.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing I would say is to fill less that 3/4 full as they really expand and mushroom if you are not careful!!! Learned the hard way first time around and had ugly looking cakes so had to bake again, putting in far less than the recommended amount of mixture.

I don't always comment on the recipes - but I made these cupcakes (I followed the recipe for the exception I used plain flour and followed other's suggestions of adding 1/2 teaspoon more salt and 3 teaspoons of baking powder). These were for my daughter's wedding reception and the guests wanted to know the bakery I used! They were a huge hit. Light, fluffy and lemony - just perfect. I would consider myself an intermediate baker, but this recipe made me look like a pro! Ha! Because the reception was outside I kept the cupcakes cooled until just before guests arrived. I also opted for a butter cream frosting over the lighter whipped so that we didn't have a melt down. Thanks again!

Best lemon cupcakes I've made yet! I did add more lemon zest, but that's just personal preference. Remember to add 3 teaspoons of baking powder IF you use all-purpose flour, which is most likely what most of us have in our pantries. If you use the self-rising flour as stated in the ingredients list, then of course you do not add the baking powder, it's already in your flour.

Its difficult to rate this recipe overall it was good, not great.  not very lemony, doesn't brown very well...

Overall with modifications (more lemon, scalded milk, etc) make it better, just not great..

Great recipe from scratch. Some of my friends found the icing a bit too sweet, others didn't, use your own judgement on amount of sugar to add. The self-made rising flour worked perfectly, baking power and salt, as suggest by some reviewers. Also the extra lemon juice and zest suggestion was a clincher. Only suggestion is that the icing if stored in the fridge for a while, be whipped up again if using icing nozzle/bag. The amount of butter was perfect (how the heck did someone get dripping grease is beyond me) plus the time, 17 was bang on, just lucky I guess. This makes the icing thicker and easy to apply instead of being a bit runny. Fives stars is for this excellent recipe despite extra tips from reviewers for the sweetness and lemony taste of the cupcakes really depends on one's taste buds.

Just made these cupcakes not frosting. The cupcakes are light and airy...the secret is to beat the cream & sugar until it looks like "whipped cream" adding the eggs one at a time is important and then beating them to a "light whipped yellow cream". This incorporates maximum air. Place them in the oven on the second to the bottom rack position as the sugar content is high enough to burn the bottomsat 17 minutes. It does take the full 17 minutes to bake...just saying! Will try these again.

This is a lovely recipe for citrus lovers: I can't help but feel thankful I found this recipe.
As for suggestions,I think adding the lemon juice and zest could be done according to tastes,because people really vary in their use of lemon. I used more juice and less zest than specified in the recipe. What I really loved was the light,cool feel of the cake. I made a more tangy icing that really gave it a lift. Had fun with this. :) Try it!

Excellent recipe (for cupcake, did not make frosting), light and flavourful.  Changes I made: used all purpose flour plus 1.5 tsp/cup baking powder and 1/4 tsp/cup salt.  Increased lemon juice and lemon zest as well.

A wonderful, easy recipe for moist, fluffy cupcakes.  I made these exactly as written, and they had a beautiful, soft lemon flavour.  You could add more zest for a bit more of a tang.  By far the best cupcake recipe I've tried.  Thanks!

These turned out AWESOME!  I used traditional buttercream icing instead of the Lemon Cream Icing, but I'll be making these again with the original icing and see what they are like.

Very good! I didn't make the icing because I didn't have time, so I used store bought because I was short on time but next time I will definitely give it a try!

Wonderful cupcake.  Followed the suggestions since i did not have self rising flour and added 1 tsp of baking powder for each cup of flour and such a light, fluffy and moist cake.  Did not use the icing as suggested and only compliant was that there was not a lot of lemon flavor in the cake and I added extra lemon juice.  I would even omit the lemon juice and use the recipe as a plain vanilla cupcake.

Yum! I made these with my 9 and 4 year old children. Good recipe for getting kids involved. We added extra lemon zest and juice because we love the taste. Still wasn't overpowering. We added too much milk by accident so we just dumped in some more flour and hoped for the best. They are wonderful. Thanks for the recipe. We will make them again.

The cupcake was very good but the frosting didn't turn out. Might have been something I did but I just used canned lemon frosting and they were great.

I tried this recipe for the first time today.  I made mini loafs (16).  They were so cute.  Very good flavor. I love baking with buttermilk.  I used buttermilk instead of plain milk.  They were very moist and cracked on top like a pound cake.  I drizzled a thin lemon icing n top. In a word.. Delish!!

These cupcakes were so light and fluffy, I don't like lemon desserts but my husband loves all things lemon.  I took a bite to make sure they were okay to serve.  Boy oh Boy was I pleasantly surprised... these are the best cupcakes EVER.  Unbelievably good.  Try them you'll be happy you did.

The cakes were alright.  Not impressed with the icing.  I know I made it correctly because it's not my first try with cream-based icings.  It just isn't balance with the cakes.  Also, I think more lemon than the recipe and maybe poppyseeds, as another suggested, would add something.

These were wonderful. I was very skeptical about the sour cream, but the consistency of the batter and the finished cupcake were really perfect. They're even better after they're been refrigerated! I added extra zest and a touch of fresh squeezed lemon juice. I used the Lemon Icing from this site instead of the one in the recipe, and the frosting was very sweet, but I thought they went together very nicely. I'll be making this one again.

I just made these tonight, and I had to make my own self rising flour since we live in Europe.  I did not like anything about these cupcakes.  I don't know if it's the flour issue but they were pretty bland and seemed to be missing any sweetness. Not something I will make again.  Glad I did a test run before I  made these for a baby shower.

I had been looking for a light and fluffy cupcake recipe and can say that I found it.  These cupcakes are so light that I could eat them all.  The lemony flavor makes them extra delicious. I did not have whole milk available and decided to mix heavy cream and non fat milk... this made them extra fluffy. Maybe next time I would add some more lemon zest and juice. Love them!

Such an absolutely gorgeous, easy, fool-proof recipe ... and it made mouth-wateringly delicious cupcakes! They're a breeze to make - I made very minor modifications: I cut back the sugar to 1.5 cups, reduced the butter to 3/4 cup, and added nearly 8-9 tbsps of lemon juice. It wasn't in the least too-lemony, and even people who aren't fond of citrus cakes agreed that these were lovely and perfect. As these were give-aways, I took the advise of a buzzer and stabilised the whipped icing. I also gave it my own twist by skipping the lemon juice and adding strawberry flavoured jello powder into it instead. (I used the Stabilised Whipped Cream Icing recipe from this site to guide me with making the icing. Since I only wanted a swirl of icing in the midst of each cupcake, I only used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream.)
I got raving reviews for these, and they looked beautiful. Thank you so much for this FriedBlueTomato! :D

This recipe was a wonderful basic cupcake recipe.I added lime zest also and teaspoon lime juice. I topped it with Lemon Mascarpone Frosting 
4 tablespoons butter (2 oz or 1/2 stick), softened
8 oz of mascarpone cheese 
2 cups of powdered sugar
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest,mix mascarpone and butter together,then add sugar,zest and juice.
Adding the green sprinkles make them great for St.Patrick's Day!

Excellent recipe, very light and fluffy with a hint of lemon.  I didn't have self rising flour so I followed the others advice to add 1 tsp baking powder per cup of flour.  Perfect recipe as it is, if you want it more lemony add more zest or lemon juice!  I might try lemon extract instead of vanilla next time.

I just made these this weekend and they are fantastic. They got rave reviews. My lemon zesting yielded more than 2 tablespoons, so I threw it all in (more like 4 tablespoons) and it was an AWESOME addition. Since our event was an outdoor affair, and the temperature was going to be 100+, I found a frosting recipe that could hold up in such temps and went with that one as opposed to the Lemon Cream Icing. Other than that I stuck to the recipe exactly as written. The cakes were moist and perfect for adults and kids alike. One of my husbands coworkers ate 3 of them, he loved them so much. Definitely on my BEST OF list!!! Thanks friedbluetomato for posting this recipe.

This recipe is great. It makes nice and fluffy cupcakes.  I found it made about 24.  I used them in place of shortcake with strawberries and it tastes very lovely.  If you don't have self rising flour I just added 1 tsp baking powder and a 1/2 tsp soda.  Works like a charm.

Mine did not turn out at all! I dont even know where to begin with what went wrong. The batter was too thick even though I added the right amount of wet and dry ingredients, I had no cupcake liners (my own fault) but the cupcakes were so thick and dense that they were more like muffins and they broke apart at any attempt to remove them. They had to bake at twice the amount of time allotted to get the toothpick to come out clean. The only thing I can say was that the frosting was delicious!! Otherwise I had a disaster all because my batter was too thick. :( I wish I knew what went wrong.

I don't have access to self-rising flour so added 1 tsp baking powder to each c flour (as did others). I agree with another reviewer that the cupcakes were dense rather than airy. But I loved this texture - the top became firm, crisp & almost caramelized and the inside a bit chewy. Topped with cream cheese frosting. I will make these again!

This would get a 5 for the cupcakes but the frosting was definitely lacking. Tasted like whip cream with barely a hint of lemon. Will make cupcakes again but use a butter cream frosting.

I would give this recipe way more stars if it were an option. I am an aspiring baker and most of the stuff I make usually ends up in the garbage because I don't like it, but these were absolutely delightful. The icing was also fantastic. These are definitely going to make my baking friends jealous when I let them have a taste. (:

the cupcakes had an AMAZING taste! But the frosting was really really runny and thin! I ended up adding flour to it to make it as thick as i wanted it to be! But the cupcakes were amazing and I would make them next time! JUST USE A DIFFERENT FROSTING RECIPE!

YUM.  So far, we've eaten these without any frosting because they're just so good!  I made a batch of lemon, then repeated with orange zest/juice.  Both are great.  A little crumbly, but light, airy and just sweet enough.  The only change that I might try is cutting down on the butter just a bit; they're just a tad greasy even with using skim milk instead of whole.  I can see why the whipped cream icing is recommended; using a buttercream icing on this would probably be too rich/greasy.

I just made these cupcakes for an all girlie girl pool party with my friends.  They came out fabulous!  I did zest a little lemon rind on the top and twisted a paper thin slice of lemon on the top. They were so summery and cheerful.  All the girls loved them.  I love making cupcakes and these are a keeper for sure!!!!

I made a fair amount of modifications, but still loved the base of this recipe.  I halved the recipe (didn't want that many cupcakes).  I used regular flour and 2 tsp baking powder.  I used 1/3 c coconut oil instead of butter.  I used 3/4 c demera sugar instead of white sugar.  I used the zest and juice of one lemon and added a couple tablespoons of ground flax.  These were fabulous!  Didn't even bother with icing - they were plenty sweet and the lemon flavor was really nice.  They weren't a super light and fluffy muffin, but they weren't heavy and they were very tender.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this without the lemon icing (I made them for my wedding with cream cheese frosting just so all cupcakes would match).  PERFECT lemon cupcakes!  If I ever make them again I would use the icing in the recipe.

These cupcakes were delicious and everyone just ate them up! The cake with this whipped cream frosting was a light lemon-not over powering.  I will definitely make these again!

These cupcakes were really good! I reduced the butter by 1/2 cup. I also increased the amount of lemon juice and lemon zest, but the cupcakes still did not have enough lemon flavor; there was only a hint of lemon. Next time I will add even more lemon juice and zest. The icing was delicious though, not as heavy as buttercream and not too sweet.

Very tasty cake recipe, not too strong of lemon flavor. Butter caused the paper liners to stick, so maybe take advice from others and reduce amount of butter. Also had problems with cupcakes not rising in the center, may have been because I substituted flour/baking soda/salt for the self rising flour.

Fabulous. I didn't have self rising flour, so I made my own, as done by other reviewers (1 tsp. baking powder per every cup of regular flour). Also, I halved the recipe, and it worked perfectly! Sometimes decreasing or increasing the recipes of baked goods turns out wonky, but this worked great. I made lemon vanilla buttercream to go on top instead of the whipped frosting. I found that halving it made 12 perfect cupcakes, but I like mine a little over-full. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This was my first attempt of making something from scratch, and it turned out amazing!! I added lemon oil extract to intensify the flavour and also used organic flour with baking powder for it to rise. For fun I added color to the icing to spice up the look. Thanks so much

This is the best lemon cake recipe. It has just the right amount of lemon. Instead of lemon cream icing, I just use powered sugar icing, flavored with a little lemon juice. It is delicious. I have made this recipe in cupcakes, bundt cake, and a 9x11 sheet cake. It turns out great any way it is made. For the sheet cake I just dumped all the ingredients in one bowl then put it in the pan and cook it for about 40 minutes. Turned out great!

This is on the denser side for cakes. When I tried to peel it off the paper liner, it looked exactly like a muffin. This is not very lemony. Next time, I think I'll add another tablespoon lemon zest and maybe a extra 1/2 tsp baking soda to lighten the dense texture a bit.

I made this recipe exactly as written and while the lemon flavor was great, the cupcakes were extremely dry. I thought it was odd that this recipe didn't call for some kind of oil which I think would really help them be moist.

This isn't the recipe's fault, but BEWARE of the self-rising flour issue. I used standard flour, and as there's no rising agent (soda, b.powder), I had flat, dense cupcakes. Excellent flavor, but not fluffy and light like a cupcake should be. Beginner error, but if you're in a hurry and don't pay attention, the cupcakes won't turn out.

Also, the lemon zest caramelized inside the cupcakes and became chewy- not what you really want, either. I'm guessing had the cupcakes puffed up like they should have, the lemon zest would have also been OK, too.

Wowza! These bad boys were magnificent! I made mini cupcakes, they took 13 minutes to cook. Only thing I added was cornstarch, it's a bakers secret. Makes the cakes spongier, like from a bakery. Love! This is my new go to recipe!

These did not work well at all for me.  I tried them twice. The resulting cake is too soft and will not exit a silicone form without coming apart.  They needed to cook much longer than stated to be firm, to the point where the bottom was overdone.  Very disappointed.  Waste of time.

These were easy to make. Be sure not to overbeat the batter, this might be why some found it dense. The cupcakes turned out light and yummy. I used a lemon buttercream frosting which added more lemon flavor. Without the icing I would agree that more lemon zest or juice should be added to give it a bit more flavor. These are great and will make again.

Let me just say these came out so perfect!!! I was attempting to make a practice batch of cupcakes for my wedding in November. I had a different recipe from another site that looked good, but didn't turn out right. So, I tried the same recipe again thinking maybe I did something wrong...nope. Same thing...no good. tasted okay, but just didn't "work" out well. Not sure why, but after attempting that same recipe twice in one night, I was pretty much over it. BUT I had to make the practice batch to share with my family the next day. So, it's 1 am in the morning and I'm desperately searching for a better recipe and found this one. Giving it one last attempt, I went for it. I used all-purpose flour with the suggested baking powder addition and added a little extra lemon zest. The batter was so nice a fluffy when I poured it into the cups and then...magic! These cupcakes were absolute perfection and they are so delicious! I am so happy I found this recipe. Highly recommend

I love this recipe! Like others, I didn't have self rising flour, so adjusted accordingly.  Also threw in 1 box of instant lemon pudding, it gave them a more vibrant yellow color and a bit more of a lemon kick!  Made a raspberry whipped cream filling and whip cream frosting topped with toasted coconut.  Amazing!!  By far my favorite cupcake!

Made these last week. Everyone LOVED them and they were gone super fast! Doubled the lemon juice and zest and used APF w 1 1/4 tsp baking powder for each cup of flour. Came out pretty dense but I also didn't sift the flour. They were still delicious!

Great cake part. The only thing different that I did was add extra lemon. Turned out great. However, I did not like the icing at all. I didn't think it was sweet enough and I could taste too much heavy cream. I will make these cupcakes again just use a different icing.

So easy and so good. This rating is only for the cupcakes, not the frosting. I left the kitchen for the cupcakes to cool and when i returned to make the frosting, more then 1/2 the cupcakes were gone. The only thing I will do differently next time is double the recpie (appaently 30 cupcakes just was not not enough) i think that i will use a little lemon extract in addition to the juice and zest. Also my 3 year old who never eats the cake part of a cupcake or cake snuck three and ate them all with no frosting. I think I just found her birthday cake! :)
Thank you for sharing.

These cupcakes were a big disappointment. I followed the recipe exactly and I got shrunken, rubbery little cupcakes that had almost no lemon flavor. I really hoped these would be better. I ended up baking vanilla cupcakes and filling them with tangy lemon curd. Much better.

VERY GOOD!! I halved the recipe, got 12 regular size, and 6 mini cupcakes. I used a little extra fresh lemon juice, ground flax and water instead of eggs, all purpose flour with baking soda and a little extra salt instead of self rising, fat free milk, and a little less sugar. I iced mine with leftover homemade cream cheese frosting with a little lemon juice added in . Fluffy and very tasty! They don't rise much, could be due to the flour substitution. They DO stick a little, even with well sprayed non-stick muffin pans. I ran a knife around the muffins before popping them out of the pan. Will make again!

The lemon flavor in the cupcake was good but they came out really dense - more like muffins than cupcakes and I followed the recipe exactly.  The icing was more like lemon whipped cream, which was good on berries (had about half the icing left over) but kind of weird on a cupcake.

I did not have self rising flour and neglected to add baking powder.  As a result the cupcakes were dense.  I suggest to add a little baking powder if you do not have self rising flour.

These were perfect, exactly what I was looking for. light, bright lemon flavor. These are a more 'grown up' lemon cupcake but my 5 year old liked them too. I will make these often. OH-I needed 5 medium lemons for the zest. I couldn't find that info in anyone elses review...

The cupcakes were wonderful, light, lemony and moist.  I made 1/2 of the recipe, but still used 2 tbsp of lemon juice and the zest from 2 lemons in the batter.  I also used all purpose flour (adding 1 tsp. baking powder per cup of flour).  The half recipe made 14 standard size cupcakes.  I baked them at 375 convection oven and they took exactly 17 minutes.

I tried the lemon cream icing and wasn't happy with it - not as stiff as I'd like it, and when I beat it longer it split...  but I did make a lemon buttercream and that worked well. (1/3 cup softened unsalted butter, beat until fluffy... added 2 cups sifted icing sugar gradually, then added 1/4 cup lemon juice, 1/2 tsp lemon zest, 1 tsp vanilla and an additional 2-2.5 cups of icing sugar until you get the consistency that you like.)  My kids decorated with rainbow sprinkles and jelly beans :)

These cupcakes have a very light, tender texture. However, the lemon flavor is very light as well, so I will use a lemon buttercream frosting, which will intensify their lemon-ness. The recipe is easy and quick -- a real keeper!

This is a good recipe that could be great.

Let's start by saying that these have a WONDERFUL TEXTURE. I am a novice baker without even a handheld mixer (hand whisking like the good ol' day...), and they still managed to turn out fluffy and light. Nothing like those other "corn bread" cupcake recipes.

However, I was a little disappointed with the flavor. I added an extra tbsp of zest and nearly doubled the juice, but the flavor was still lacking. Maybe I'm just a lemon floozy, but I really like a nice punch of flavor. I will definitely try this again, this time perhaps tripling the lemon!

Delicious and light cupcakes!  I don't usually have self-rising flour in the pantry, so I substituted all-purpose flour and 1 T of baking powder.  Dropped the temperature down to 350 and baked for about 19 minutes.  Turned out great, with a nice round dome!  Smells delicious and with just the perfect hint of lemon.  This one is going in my recipe box.  Thanks for sharing!

I made these in France, using farine de blé tout usage and adding a teaspoon of levure chemique (baking powder) for each cup of flour as recommended by another reviewer.  They came out marvelously!  Very light and lemony taste, perfect for the first weekend of spring.   Merci pour cette belle recette!

The cupcakes were excellent - fluffy and light. They tasted just like lemon poppy seed muffins without the poppy seeds. This recipe yielded more than 30 cupcakes for me even though I filled the cupcake tins more than 3/4 full (which I don't recommend).  I was disappointed in the icing though. All I could taste was dairy, so I added more lemon juice and sugar, but I still wasn't happy with the result. Next time I'll just do a glaze.

These cupcakes were amazing!!!  I made them for my two year old grandson's birthday celebration. I took them to his school, and all the tots loved them. The texture was so light and fluffy, and the taste was so lemony and out of this world delicious. 

I only changes I made was that I used cake flour instead of all purpose flour and 3 teaspoons of baking powder.

This recipe is a definite keeper, I plan on using it whenever I need to made a superb, fresh tasting cake or cupcakes.  

Thank you for sharing!

These turned out really good for me. I didn't have self rising flour, so I made some with baking powder and extra salt. I always use unsalted butter in my baking. I also decided to use whole buttermilk instead of whole milk. I bought some since most of my best cake recipes use them, and only picked this recipe out after I bought it. I thought that the tang of the buttermilk would work with lemon, and it did just great. The cupcakes were moist and tender. I also made a lemon buttercream frosting instead of this frosting, so I cannot rate that. I have to say that I ran out of lemon juice, so I  added heavy cream to the frosting and it never curdled or anything. It was fluffy with a great hint of lemon, so I am really glad I gave it a shot. I was glad to have the sweetness of buttercream, but not the overly dense texture.  

I'm so happy to have a lemon cake recipe that works so well. Thanks.

Fab-u-lous! I love lemon things and this recipe for lemon cake is amazing. Although, I didn't have self-raising flour so I just used 3 c. all-purpose and 4 1/2 tsp. baking powder. Worked just as well. This recipe is fabulous and amazing, need I say more?

Wow, Wow, WOW>  Made for very first time today.  Very light tasting, not overpowering at ALL (in fact, I added just a smidge more lemon to the frosting). Wasn't a heavy flavor, and constancy of the cupcake was spot on.  I even used regular white flour (adding 1 tsp of baking powder per cup flour and a dash of salt).  Still - PERFECT.  

Many bill this as a "grownup" cupcake, but my kids (all tween/teens) LOVE THEM.  This if FOR SURE going on my list of cupcakes to make in the future.

These are absolutely delish!  They even taste better on the second day.  I think the lemon flavor really comes through then.  I didn't have self-rising flour, so I took others' suggestion and used 1 tsp baking powder for every cup of cake flour (sifted).  I used cream cheese frosting this time, and it was great.  I do want to try the lemon frosting next time.

I found these cupcakes the other day and baked them today. I just made them as a yellow cake, added a filling of lemon curd filling and made a meringue top. Both my husband and I agreed these are the best yellow cupcakes we have ever had. I can hardy wait for my card group to try them tomorrow. Wonderful job friedbluetomato. I will try them as lemon cupcakes the next time.

Made this exactly according to directions. If you are looking for a cupcake that is light and airy like a box cake, forget it. This tastes homemade, and is a bit more dense. You must use self-rising flour. When I was mixing the batter, it actually reminded me a bit like pound cake batter. Beat the butter and sugar WELL. When adding the flour and milk alternately, start with flour and end with flour. DO NOT over mix at this point. I think that is why some people have trouble. Some people said that it wasn't enough lemon flavor. I disagree. I used fresh grated lemon peel, and not the store bought lemon zest. Two FULL tablespoons was about right. The lemon cream was a nice against the more dense cupcake. Next time, I might put a bit of lemon curd in the middle to kick it up a notch.

These were absolutely delicious. I made my own self-rising flour with salt and baking powder. Both kids and adults raved about them.

It doesn't say whether the oven temp is for a fan-assisted oven or not. The cupcakes rose beautifully and are tasty and fluffy. 
I didn't like the icing at all.

Just OK. The cake is not very lemony. We didn't care for the whipped icing. We prefer lemon buttercream. Won't make again.

Delicious! I did not even follow the recipe very well and they still turned out great. I had to bake in a kitchen that was not my own and did not have a lot of the stuff I needed. Ended up using all-purpose flour (unsifted as I didn't have a sifter to use), and added a little baking powder as other reviewers suggested. I also didn't have the proper measuring cups/spoons so had to guesstimate quite a bit (one 1/2 cup was all I had). Added a little bit (maybe 2 T.?) of vegetable oil as I find that my homemade cakes usually turn out a little dry. Also, I had some problems with a quirky gas oven and had to bake them a lot longer than stated, and at a higher temp. And yes, even with all this they STILL tasted great!!! I imagine if I had done everything properly they would have been divine, bakery quality cupcakes. I think it's a real testament to the recipe that they turned out so well despite everything.

I loved this recipe. I cut the butter by a quarter cup and it was still very moist. I also added twice the amount of zest and juice, as I enjoy extra lemon. And the frosting, oh my. It was delicious!

I didn't have self-rising flour, so I added 1 tsp baking powder for each cup of flour. The cupcakes weren't quite lemony enough, so I had to add some lemon extract and a little yellow food coloring. Other than that, it's not a bad recipe.

This was delicious. I made my own self rising flour because I always have better results when I make my own. I didn't have whole milk so I used half and half, and I added two small packs of blueberries. The cake is nice and buttery while still being tender and airy. The light lemon whipped topping goes perfect with the cake and makes a perfect end-of-summer treat that feels like you're indulging without it weighing you down. Definitely making again.

This is the first time I made cupcakes from scratch and they turned out perfect.  Light, fluffy, just enough lemon flavor.  I also did not have the self rising flour so I added the baking powder.  I also did not have unsalted butter so I omitted the additional salt and used salted butter.  They were absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make them again and again! Thank you for the recipe

This is awesome. Although I agree it needs more lemon juice. As it is, the lemon flavor remains a hint, some people might like it that way. But if you'd like more than a kick, better add more.

I made these today and they were HEAVEN!!!  I zested the lemons and squeezed the juice fresh and they were SO perfect on a warm summer day.  The icing is maybe the best I've ever tasted in my life- I beat 4 raspberries into it for a pretty rosy color and a subtle berry flavor and it was so light and didn't taste obscenely sugary like most icings.  I am absolutely not exaggerating when I say that this is one of my most favorite baking recipes ever- I am thankful it was posted here and am sharing this link with everyone I can think of!

I followed the suggestion of another user in the comments and used 1tsp baking powder for each cup of All-purpose flour. I brought these to a tea party, and everybody Loved them. They were moist and yummy, will make again.

I see that some people had the same problem I did - these cupcakes turned out very dense (about 1 1/2 " tall).  They taste ok, but not really sure what I may have done wrong.

I like the texture of the cake and subtle lemon flavor.  To the icing I added grated lemon peel to enhance the flavor.  Overall these are good, but next time I will use lemon extract for more of that luscious flavor.

I made these as an after-game snack for the superbowl party, and everyone was super impressed at how perfectly moist and fluffy they turned out. Seriously, these are bakery-quality! The only thing is that you can't over-fill, otherwise they come out a bit soggy in the middle.

It was amazing! Fluffy, perfectly cooked! The recipe I didn't follow exact like I didn't have self rising flour so I used all purpose flour and added 1 tsp of baking powder and a pinch of salt for each cup but the cupcakes came out amazing! Definitely a must try!!! I cut up a lemon and put the slices on top of the cupcake because instead of doing a swirl on my cupcakes, I dipped them into the frosting and put the lemon on top for a fabulous decoration! (The zest definitely pulls the flavors and look together!)

These not-from-a-box cakes are just as easy to make and way more delicious!  I didn't have all the ingredients, but the substitutions I used worked out just fine.  I used plain, sifted cake flour instead of self-rising.  I did NOT add any raising agent, but relied on the eggs which did their job beautifully!  I used orange zest instead of lemon, and added an additional 1 Tbsp of lemon juice.  Finally, I added some roasted poppy seeds tot he batter.  I filled the baked cakes with lemon curd and topped with SMBC and yellow sugar and balls.  SO pretty and tasty!

I'm a young baker and this was my third batter that was 'Homemade'. I was very pleased, and it was amazing. If you don't eat the icing, I suggest that you add a little bit more lemon juice. The cupcakes were nice and fluffy, and the icing was great. Can't wait to do this one again! :)

Followed the recipe as written, with extra lemon added  to taste. The result was a lovely, light cake. I beat the room temp butter and eggs for a full 4 minutes in order to get an airy consistency, and sifted the self rising flour. Baked at 350, and topped with Lemon Frosting (buttercream) from this site. Beautiful!

I followed the directions exactly. I really regret not reading the one star reviews by other cooks before I made it.  Like others, mine turn out to be so DOUGHY. It turned out to taste more like a muffin than a cupcake.

I pretty much followed the recipe to a T. I used all-purpose and just added a teaspoon of baking powder like the others suggested. I added a little more lemon, I had a couple large lemons and didn't want to waste them. They came out perfect. They were a hit with everyone I shared them with. I paired it with the lemon cream cheese frosting recipe also on allrecipes and added a raspberry filling. So delicious!

This recipe is great! I made these cupcakes and took them to work for Easter. I'm not a big fan of lemon, but I did enjoy these. I added food collaring to the icing and put jelly beans on top for decoration. Thanks for the recipe!

OK, so here it goes. So I bought the most adorable spring cupcake moldlings and wanted to do a trail run for the cupcakes before actually making a real batch for Easter Sunday. While the recipe is super duper easy and fun to make, I dont believe it had enough lemon taste. They tasted more like a bread than a cupcake for some reason. I didnt everything the recipe says and I even added more lemon zest and juice and still not lemony enough for me. Now the Lemon cream icing I mixed by hand. I did not use a mixer. And although it took a lot longer I decided to do it anyway. And I am glad I did. I added a lot more lemon juice then the recipe calls for. It turned out really nice and fluffy. Now am I going to use this recipe for Easter Sunday? No. I am glad I gave it a whirl and I am glad I had all the ingredients at home.....but not yummy enough to tempt me to make them again let alone for my whole family. I'll have to look for something else. But I am so glad that some of you enjoyed the recipe more than some of us. Happy eating!

xoxo

I followed the recipe to the t and it turned out great. The cake was really soft and moist. Perhaps it was because I sifted the flour several times as well as not cut back the butter. I do think the cake needs a bit more lemon juice. The frosting went well with the cake. I also saved some lemon zest and sprinkled it on top of the frosting. As the other reviewer said the recipe can be used for an orange cake as well. I tried it out using tangelos. My partner loved it very much. So, thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made these cupcakes and they were delicious. They were moist and light. I used a lemom butter cream icing and a lemon cream cheese icing. They were both equally delicious toppings. I plan to use this for my daughter's birthday cupcakes. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for an adult birthday party. they were perfect! Not too sweet, and a very light icing. I garnished with a large raspberry and mint leaves.

Great recipe, easy and homey. Wanting it to be lighter in calories I decided to use half the butter, one and 1/4 cups of sugar, 3 tbs of lemon juice, 2% milk and used a 10 in bundt pan. Less fluffy (because of my changes) I guess, but still awesome.  Thanks for sharing.

I've made these about 10 times in the past year for various occasions. They are really easy to make. I think the only problem is that the cake can be a little dry. However,  the amazing frosting covers that up really well.

I didn't have my cupcake pan on hand so I went with 2 8-inch rounds. They came out really dense and chewy. Not impressed at all. I would have given it 1 star but I gave an extra because perhaps it bakes up better when made into cupcakes. But I was very disappointed.

It was very good, I made it with my best friend. The cupcakes were great topped with blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries, but you could add any fruit and it would be good. The cupcakes are very decorative and they tasted great, but it took a long time to make. Overall, they were good. :)

The lemon cupcake's turned out delicious but a little more dense than I would have liked. But overall good. 

However, the icing was a different story. I tried the icing recipe twice and both times the icing curdled! I still cant figure out what am doing wrong!

These were amazing! I added a little more zest and increased the lemon juice to 1/4 cup to get more intense flavour. I also put 3/4 tsp of raspberry puree on top and swirled it in. Topped with white chocolate buttercream. Cake was light with a great balance of tart and sweet. This could be my new signature cupcake.

Best Cupcakes I have ever made! I used 3 Tsp of Zest in the batter and topped the cupcakes with zest like in the picture. In the icing I used 4 Tsp of lemon juice. I think it was perfect.

I substituted 3 cups self-raising flour with 3 cups of all-purpose flour with 41/2 tsp of baking powder and added 1/2 tsp of salt. I was afraid the cupcake was going to be too dense like a muffin since the batter was thicker than other recipes I have tried. However, the cupcakes turned out wonderfully with a good amount of lemon flavour. I only give this 4 stars because I didn't enjoy the icing. It didn't have enough flavour and was too light. I tried adding lemon zest, but didn't help the icing much.

I didn't quite have enough lemon juice to give mine that noticeable lemon flavor, but they were absolutely delicious anyway. A few changes I made...I used AP flour with a tsp of baking powder per cup of flour, almond milk instead of dairy, and a third less butter than the recipe call for. I also made my traditional cream cheese icing and added some lemon juice and yellow food coloring. This recipe would be great without the lemon and just as a vanilla cake.

Family said these are the best cupcakes I have made. They were light and fluffy, and the lemony flavor was nice and light, not overpowering however I did make one minor change. I did 1/2 the recipe (about 16 cupcakes) and the full amount of lemon juice, so I will double it when I want to make a full batch

Yummy!! I did not have self rising flour, so I just added 3 tsp. of baking powder. Cut the sugar back by using 1 1/2 cups and baked it as a cake.  Definitely will be making this again!!

The flavour of these cupcakes was really delicious but mine were a bit dense/tough.  I was really hoping for a lighter, airy cupcake. I followed the recipe exactly and was careful not to overwork the batter.

These cupcakes were just okay. They weren't like other cupcakes in that they were almost like a muffin rather than a cupcake. They didn't have a very strong lemon taste and I doubled the lemon juice.

Best lemon cup cakes ever!! I however used 2tsps of baking powder for every cup of flour instead of self raising flour and they turned out great!! I also added more lemon juice and zest. For the frosting definitely add more confectioners sugar if you want it sweeter!! Thanks for sharing!!

While these cupcakes are flavorful they were very dry. I followed the directions with no changes so  not sure why these were so dry.  Good lemon flavor but not a tangy sharp lemon flavor which I would prefer. I even filled the cupcakes with a lemon curd to get more tangy lemon flavor.  If it wasn’t for the dryness these cupcakes would be a 4 or 5 star recipe. Great frosting although the instructions say to mix for minutes and it it only needs about a minute. While this is tasty I won’t make them again.

I'm sure that these are delicious and as closely as I followed the recipe, they didn't turn out great. However, I gave this recipe 4 stars because I am not the best baker. So, I'm sure others who are great bakers could make these lemon cupcakes taste delicious. Mine turned out a little dry and bland. What did I do wrong? I need the "secret" to making cupcakes - because I am missing something :)

Like others I found my cupcake to be dense, however, this wasn't a big deal to me. In addition, they were on the sweeter side. One thing that I will do next time is to add more lemon, as I hardly tasted it. I also tweaked the recipe and filled the cupcake with lemon curd. Overall a decent cupcake.

Very yummy, moist, and forgiving. I thought for sure I over beat the batter, but it came out very fluffy. Though, it didn’t have much lemon flavor in the cake itself.

I have made this recipe multiple times, and it's always been great.   However, I decided to make some changes after the first few times I made it.  First, I used half butter and half avocado oil (you can use any vegetable or canola oil for this, though) because the cupcakes will be a little dry if only butter is used.  I have never tried the lemon cream icing that is included in this recipe- instead, I made some light, fluffy lemon buttercream.  I just recently made these for a customer, and for a garnish, I candied some lemon slices and put them on top.  It adds a great lemon touch!

Made it for a dear friend’s baby shower. Due to our hot and humid weather, I used a lemon cream cheese frosting recipe (it holds its shape better) from another site instead. As the frosting was rather sweet, I halved the sugar for the cupcake. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.... It turned out great! Light and airy.... everyone loved it! Had a couple of requests for recipes too ;-)

This cupcake is very delicious. We didn't even need to add frosting. This cake was very moist and lemony. I highly recommend. I didn't have a chance to taste the frosting though.

I made this recipe without the icing. Reduced the butter a bit and added way more lemon zest and lemon juice. Super easy and light and fluffy! Definitely add more lemon to get that crisp flavor. I might make them with icing sometime but they are yummy without.

Really light and fluffy and not too sweet. I cut the lemon extract to a half teaspoon and doubled the zest and juice so the more natural flavors could come through in the cake. I've also substituted buttermilk and added blueberries for an extra surprise. This is an easy recipe to halve if you don't have a need for 30 cupcakes!

Just made these today and I can see using this recipe over and over again. They are delicious and light, and I’m a huge fan of the homemade whip cream frosting. I love the suggestions for alternate flavorings based on the reviews and will try some of those in the future. For now, these will be perfect for our Easter celebration!

These were a HUGE hit with family!   We made a lemon glaze instead and drizzled it over the cupcakes, as my daughter had made these previously, and liked the cupcakes better without the suggested icing.   Having said that, she still preferred them plain, but most of us LOVED it with the light lemon glaze.

these were really easy and tasty but I did make one modification. I added 2TBSP of lemon powder because I like in your face lemon flavor! I used a#24 scoop so the liners are only half full but they came out perfect for what I wanted!! Just enough room for frosting ??

My friends and I loved these cupcakes. I did not use this icing and the first batch I made over baked, even though the time I set was less than the recommended time. Overall they were very good and I would recromend them for parties and family gatherings.

The lemon cupcakes were divine, I did adjust the zest from TBS to tsp and they came out very lemony. I also made a lemon buttercream frosting instead, I tried the frosting in this recipe and it didn't turn out well for me.

I made these cupcakes for a potluck and they were great!! The cake itself was a little dense, but I also over beat the butter and sugar together, so only mix until fluffy. Also the cake was a little subtle in flavor so I added more (~1tsp more) lemon juice. When I made the whipped cream icing, I put 2.25 T of lemon juice, and added 1T of meringue powder to stabilize because I was piping it onto the cupcakes.

I didn’t use self raising flour which was my bad and the cupcake ended up being super dense. I also think more lemon needs to be added to the batter to make it more lemony but that’s just personal preference. on the other hand with the frosting I used cream cheese and added zest to it as well as a little extra lemon juice which turned out really good and was everyone’s favorite

They were very good and a hit at my friends birthday party!  I didn't have unsalted butter so I used salted and omitted the salt in the recipe. I also used regular flour and 3 tsps of baking powder like another user recommended. Thanks for sharing

It turned out amazing! They were sooooo good. The icing failed but the cupcakes themselves were excellent; so I didn’t put the icing on. I used food coloring for a silly twist.

These are now my favorite cupcakes, the only thing I've done differently is I now use a raspberry frosting instead of lemon. Otherwise it's too much lemon.

Amazing cupcakes! I added extra lemon juice as some reviews said to give it a strong lemony flavour. I added about the juice of one whole lemon and they were perfect. I will make them again!

Next time I need to really cream the butter and sugar in step 1. the rest of the steps felt like I did it fine. The cake was good, but I didn't like the frosting at all (and I LOVE lemons!) not sure what I did wrong there. I need to try this one again with when I have some better baking skills, and see if it turns out better.

This was my first attempt at making any type of cupcake completely from scratch. I love anything lemon and this recipe was not only delicious but easy enough for someone like myself. The only change I made was rather than the self rising flour I used baking  powder lime another review said. Also like I said I love lemon, so if you do to I would double the lemon juice.

I just made the cupcakes, and halved the recipe. Instead of lemon juice and zest, I used lemon natural essence, and I baked them for 20 mins. This resulted in 14 delicious, fluffy, lemony cupcakes.  I thoroughly recommend giving this recipe a go, it's very quick and easy to whip up!

Lovely cake, I'll definitely use this recipe again (with no changes), though I used the recipe for the icing from Lemon-Filled Cupcake from AR and filled these from the same recipe.  They got raves from several sources where I served them.

After reading a number of reviews I decided to add more fresh lemon juice than in the recipe as the cupcakes are for a party of a lemon-lover.  Since only a dozen are needed for the party  I cut the recipe in half ; doing so provided three cupcakes for taste testing. Delicious!

Delish! Great fresh lemon flavour! Used regular flour (and added baking powder & salt) and buttermilk instead of  milk (search tips on how to change the bpowder and bsoda)

Made in a 9x13 glass pan with Ez for his 9th bday. Bake slightly less next time. But definitely make again. Made raspberry whipped cream for frosting. Perfect!

I got rave reviews from my coworkers on this one. The birthday girl requested lemon with buttercream so I made half with the frosting it called for and half with my famous homemade buttercream. Birthday girl said it was a tie but all the rest said the frosting the recipe calls for was the best! Thanks for giving me another "go-to" recipe!

I made these to send with my husband to his office,  Everyone Loved these! I added extra zest and lemon juice to the batter, we like tangy lemon flavor. I also used a cream cheese frosting that  naples34102 mentioned in her review. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were delicious moist cupcakes though the lemon flavor was extremely subtle. I used a lemon cream cheese icing but prior to that topped the cupcake with lemon curd to bring out more of the lemon flavor.

1st - The flavor is good along with Texture excluding the "frosting"
2nd - THESE ARE NOT CUPCAKES, these are biscuits that are in the shape of a muffin/cupcake.
3rd - Does not have any lemon flavor at all and I zested and freshly squeezed the lemon. I made the recipe exactly as written and with all the correct ingredients. The frosting was essentially whip cream and again lacked the actual flavor of lemon. I never leave reviews but wanted to address that if you are looking for an actual cupcake this is not it. If you are looking for what tastes like a butter biscuit BOOM this is for you.

Enjoyed making it. Used SMBC as the topping instead. Really great. I wish a yield could be included though so one knows how many cupcakes can be obtained off a base recipe

This is by far the best lemon cake recipe that I've ever had. I did add additional powdered sugar to the icing for taste. I live in Louisiana, surrounded by excellent cooks & this recipe is FANTASTIC!!

I made these twice. The first time I made them, I made 24 (I only had two 12-count cupcake containers) and they turned out a little tall. They also were not very lemony, so I tried again. I was unable to locate dried lemon zest (is that no longer available?), but I did find some crystallized lemon and added plenty of that. Both times I added lemon extract to the recipe. Perhaps the lemon flavor is just meant to be subtle. The texture of the cake is light and fluffy, though. I did bake the second batch a little too long. I would check them after about 11 minutes with a bamboo skewer; they are not dark on top when they are finished baking. Do cream the butter and the sugar together for several minutes before adding the eggs and temper your butter.

The recipe turned out great. I made a smaller dose and substituted the butter with oil, because  I don't normally like to cook with buter, but it worked out just fine. The cupcakes were light and fluffy and absolutely marvelous. I will surely be making this one another couple of times.

Fabulous!! Followed recipe to a T and wouldn't change anything. I piped the whipped cream onto the cupcakes and had a perfect amount. Made exactly 24 cupcakes with my pans. I had to do the same thing as others and use flour and baking powder. They were light and fluffy inside with crispy outside. I had to bake mine for 25 minutes and they were perfect.

I bake a LOT, so it was an easy recipe to follow. However, it was SO very greasy. My cupcake liners were totally dark with grease. I put them in another layer of liners, and those got smudged though, also.  The flavor was pretty blah and dense. The batter beat up nice and fluffy, but these went straight into the garbage can.

Just made the cake, not the icing. I think the flavor is very good, but I did have issues with the cupcakes sinking in the center. The recipe kept nagging at me because typically when you have an acidic ingredient (like lemon juice) you use baking soda to neutralize the acid. This recipe only calls for self rising flour, which is flour with added baking powder and salt (only in the US), no baking soda. So, the first time I followed the recipe as is, except I decreased the salt by half as the flour already contained some. The second go around I am making only half the recipe and adding 1/4 tsp baking soda in hopes of no sinking....I'm waiting on the results, but I will post an update once I finish.
Update: the baking soda helped a little. It may have made the cake a tad more crumbly... my general thoughts: I think the cake is a good starting point and if you're not overly concerned about it sinking a little then it is a fine recipe with good flavor. However, if you're using self rising flour, I would decrease the salt because the flour already has salt. I know the recipe says to not over mix, but I think it can handle a little more mixing than stated in order to help developed the gluten which might, in turn, keep the sinking to a minimum. Thirdly, I would add just a little baking soda to help neutralize the acidity from the lemon juice. Lastly, I would take care not to over fill the cupcake tin ( if you weigh them, I would say roughly 1.6 ounces is sufficient ). Just my thoug

AMAZING!! Positively scrumptious! The lemon in both the cupcake and the icing is subtle and sweet- I substituted self-rising flour for 3 cups all-purpose and 3 teaspoons baking powder, and I used salted butter. These cupcakes are light, melt-in-your mouth, and deliciously lemony. Totally recommend!!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out kind of heavy - more of a pound cake texture then light and fluffy.  It was good, nice lemony flavor - made it with the lemon cream cheese frosting on this site.  Not bad but I would have liked a lighter texture cake.

This was super easy to do. I was in kind of a hurry, so I admit, I used a box cake mix, but the icing is this recipe. I added 1 1/2 T of Wilton meringue powder (the stuff's a godsend - available at JoAnn fabric, and Michael's - I don't do walfart or hobby lobby) so I was fairly sure that it would thicken. Boy, did it! I had gorgeous soft peaks, and was able to pipe it on the cupcakes that I'm taking for a work potluck tomorrow. I'll be using the icing recipe again! I also grated a medium lemon for additional color/flavor.

Instead of making cupcakes I made a 6in round and I would not recommend it for an actual cake. Stick with cupcakes. It took 45 minutes for a 6in round filled 3/4 way up  to bake through. I had to put tinfoil on it to keep it from burning and the sides cooked up pretty hard. I also switched the vanilla extract for lemon extract but even with that I had a hard time tasting the lemon flavor. You also need a backup recipe for all the extra lemons needed for the zest. It's the zest of like 10 lemons and the juice of 5.  Because of all the extra time baking it was really dry. The cake also turned out really dense and I did use self-rising flour and thought I beat the sugar/butter/eggs well. I don't know. I'm torn on this recipe. I'd like to try it again for cupcakes which it was originally intended for. My thinking was cake is cake is cake which I guess is not.

Reduced to 8 servings yielding 9 cupcakes.  Used fresh squeezed orange juice, cointreau, and lemon juice to boost citrus flavor and topped with powdered sugar instead of icing.  Super moist, light texture, with just the right amount of sweetness.  Easy to make - imagining other flavor modifications/additions would be super, too; recipe seems versatile and foolproof.  Yay!

I made exactly as the recipe stated, with one adjustment being I used salted butter instead of unsalted, and used less salt.  The result was caved in the middle, stuck to the cupcake liners, and burnt on the bottom.  I was SO hoping to love this! Not sure where things went wrong, as I followed the recipe exactly as stated. The flavor was just ok...not nearly as lemony as I'd have like.

This recipe is the best lemon recipe I could find, so I decided to give it a try. I was able to make a total of 34 cupcakes, many of which turned out picture-perfect. I followed the recipe exactly; I even found the self-rising flour for it. It turned out a tiny bit dry, but the frosting made up for it. I loved the idea of using a whipped cream frosting instead of a buttercream or cream cheese frosting. One of the perks of making this is by far the lemony smell it provides. Overall great recipe, I will make it again!

So I made this for my boyfriend and his family. I've made these twice- the first time the cupcakes turned out beautifully but unfortunately I grabbed cream for cooking rather than whipping cream as I'm an expat still learning the host language and they ended up being icing-less. They were very light in flavor and dense in texture which I really enjoyed, and the lemony flavor is subtle. They were all consumed even without frosting. The second time I made them, I had all of the proper ingredients however the icing recipe was a pain. I tried twice according to the instructions and ended up with butter and a liquidy substance every time. I eventually scrapped that idea and went for a much easier buttercream recipe that only needed butter, sugar, vanilla and milk instead and it worked marvelously.

Loved this recipe.  I added extra lemon zest because I like a more lemony flavor.  I added a couple of drops of lemon extract to the whipped frosting.  They were light, fluffy, and delicious.  I will be making them again.

I made the cupcakes only and they are wonderful! Light, airy, and full of flavor!

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added additional lemon zest and lemon juice. I used raw whole milk that I soured (1Tbsp of white vinegar per cup of warmed milk). I also decreased the oven temperature to 350 degrees and baked the cupcakes for 15 minutes. They turned out perfect. 

Not only did I not have self rising flour on hand, I discovered that my baking powder was expired and no longer active (to test, I put 1/2 tsp of it into 1 cup of hot water and watched  for it to "fizz", which it didn't). In its place, I substituted 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp cream of tartar for every cup of flour used in the recipe. 

I have saved this recipe and definitely will be making them again!

Made these cupcakes Friday and they turned out lovely. They were light and fluffy,  I could have used a bit more lemon flavor but they were still delicious.

Just excellent!  Doubled the zest and juice.  Had to zest two full lemons.  Also,  I think it may be prudent to maybe do half butter and half vegetable oil so a bit softer.  Trying to mimic Nothing But Bundt!  Delish!!

I Love this recipe! I am a Huge Lemon Lover and this is light and delicious! I actually cut this recipe down to 12 servings and made a single layer  cake with the whipped icing for dessert. It was a hit! Delicious!

Wonderful!  Made just as directed (I halved it, but didn't change anything else). half of the recipe made 12 regular size cupcakes.  They were moist and flavorful.  My review was for the cupcakes only, as I used "real strawberry frosting" (220816).  The strawberry was a wonderful compliment to the lemon.

This recipe has too much butter. I added extra zest, juice, and some dehydrated lemon I keep on hand (because the batter as is didn't even have a hint of lemon). Once they were done you tasted butter with a hint of lemon. Yes they're moist from all the butter, but definitely not worth it. MY daughter accidentally put 3 liners in one spot and it soaked through all of them.  I made as is and am a baker by trade. Next time I might try half apple sauce (or all) instead of that much butter.

Amazing! I substituted the vanilla with lemon extract and added a little more lemon zest and juice, and these came out fantastic! I even think they got better the longer they sat in the fridge. I filled them with a raspberry filling, and frosted with white chocolate buttercream. Soo good!

I made a veganised version of this recipe and it turned out absolutely beautifully.
The substitutions I used were nuttelex for butter, soy milk for milk and aquafaba for the eggs.
I used a different recipe for the icing (http://allrecipes.com.au/recipe/18959/simple-lemon-icing.aspx)  For that I substituted nuttelex for the butter.
Highly recommended.

I love this recipe! I'm definitely going to make this again. The cupcakes were delicious, and the icing was light and lovely! My favorite part was that the recipe didn't use any other cake mixes, and was completely from scratch. The lemon zest and juice made the flavor so, so, so AMAZING!

Made these lovely cupcakes for my daughter's graduation party.  They were a big hit.  My mom (a great baker with high standards) loved them and asked for the recipe.   The ultimate compliment!

I piped the frosting on with a pastry bag -- to make fun looking tops.  I ran out of frosting on cupcake #25.  Went back and whipped up a half recipe of frosting for cupcakes #26 thru #31 (and to  doctor a few that I'd skimped on).   If you plan to pipe the frosting on, I suggest making 1.5 recipes worth of frosting right from the get-go.   It is so good.

Other modifications:  I was generous with the lemon rind in the batter (thanks to ideas shared by other bakers).  Didn't hurt the crumb and definitely boosted flavor.

I can never find a good scratch cupcake recipe, and to be honest, I give up and use a boxed cake mix. I saw that this has a lot of good reviews, so I figured, why not? Since I didn't have self-rising flour, I used unbleached white flour, and for every cup of flour, 1 tsp. of baking powder. The batter was pretty thick, and most cupcakes that have that consistency usually turn out better from my experience. After baking it for about 15-17 minutes, I took them out, and they looked pretty flat, and they didn't rise as much as they planned them to, (I probably used too much batter or something.) Next time, I'll either add more baking powder, or just use self-rising flour. I'm not sure if that's good or not, but I didn't get the desired look. When I went to take them out of the cupcake pan, most of them wouldn't come out, and the 12 that did, looked okay. Upon taking them out, the bottom of the pan was really greasy, as well as the cupcake wrapper. For the third batch, I doubled the wrapper, and used less batter. When the third batch came out, they looked better than the other ones, so I'm assuming it's my fault for using too much batter. I let them cool for a while, and then tried one. They weren't that lemony, but for me, they tasted perfect.

Didn't have self rising flour so I used the ap/powder/salt trick.  They did need a 375 oven (350 and they sank a bit) but they got really brown around the edges.  They stick horribly to the paper liners - and are strangely dry.

They were very nice and fluffy. I halved the recipe because I didn't need so many cupcakes. I didn't add any zest because my grater didn't work. They tasted like just plain sweet vanilla muffins. Next time I will have to add more lemon juice and definitely add zest...maybe zest is what gives the lemon flavor.

These were very yummy! The icing was a nice contrast to the cake.  I added additional lemon zest when I made the icing-I would also recommend adding more lemon juice than required to the batter.

Love the flavor of this cupcake! I made mini cupcakes. I rated it four stars because the icing (although delicious) I found it fragile. I over-mixed my first batch and had to throw it out. The second batch was beautiful, but after frosting half of my cupcakes, the icing failed to hold it's shape. Hoping the icing hardens in the fridge. Lovely taste!!! Once I figure the icing, it will definitely be a keeper. Thanks!!

It makes a good cupcake. I would have liked a little more of a lemon taste. Next time I would try a different frosting.  It also needed more of a lemon kick to it. I will try it again,  but make a few changes.

I really meant to give it a 4.5. I found this recipe and made some to experiment. I used regular flour and as one reviewer suggested 1/2 tsp baking powder per half cup of reg. flour.  I also found a lemon custard filling I made to fill these before frosting. People thought I bought these at a specialty cupcake place. They were delicious and so pretty, I made simple little flower designs in the middle for fun. I wanted to post a pic but did not have the option:(   I made 2 dozen and froze a 1/2 dozen to test how they defrost after a week. Im hoping to just make these ahead of time and always have them on the ready. I can't wait to make these during the summer!

I made the cupcakes but used another icing that I love. The taste of the cupcakes are amazing the sweetness and the sour lemon taste combined perfectly. If you like lemon cupcakes you should definitely try it.

I'm a dummy when it comes to cooking or baking so I had to watch the video several times and read many reviews before I started. All the good reviews are true! Smell incredibly good and fresh. Taste good too.  I did reduce the sugar because I don't like American sweet and also reduced the butter to maybe 13 or 14 table spoons just because that's all I had left. :(  I did notice there is grease/butter at the bottom of the lining so I have to put them on top of paper towels. 

I would definitely make it again.

Personal notes: Use regular flour + 1 - 1.5t baking powder & 1/2t  salt/ cup of flour.  Try extra lemon zest & juice.  Try less butter.  Whip sugar & butter very well for fluffy cupcake results.  Try 1/2 recipe for 1 muffin tin.

I made this. I have never made lemon cupcakes before. Let me say, I love these. I did change a lemon zest to a orange zest. They tasted wonderful. I will find out if there a big hit or not today.

I made this recipe for school and everybody loved it and told me if I would bring more the next day.The only change I made was that instead of the lemon frosting I used the bold vanilla frosting from pillsbury worked out beautifully. So thank you for this recipe .

I'm in love! They are soft, fluffy with just the right hint of lemon. I have no self-rising flour so just substituted all-purpose flour with baking powder.

This is a great recipe! DO NOT OVERBAKE. I add a little more zest and make a lemon cream cheese frosting (unsalted butter, Philadelphia cream cheese, powdered sugar, FRESH lemon juice and zest) and they're always a hit!

Tasty but kinda dry.  Didn't like the whipped cream "frosting" made them with lemon buttercream.  I think I will try to add some more milk or something next time.

These are good, I think I would have liked them more with more lemon zest for a more intense lemon flavor...next time!  I didn't have the cream for the frosting, used a few tablespoons of butter instead and made a typical frosting adding some lemon extract for more lemon flavor.

This review is for the icing.  I wanted a light lemon icing to go with a lemon cake I make.  I was disappointed.  The juice made the cream taste more sour than lemony, next time I'd flavor it with zest or extract.

This review is for the cupcakes only, as I used Special Buttercream Frosting to top them with. These cupcakes had a light lemony flavor; next time I may increase the amount of lemon juice. I used buttermilk instead of whole milk, since I had some left over from another recipe. I also cut the sugar in half. The cupcakes were very moist; I'll definitely make these again!

This is a wonderfully delicious recipe.  The cupcakes came out moist with just the right amount of tang.  The lemon whipped frosting is a perfect compliment while not being sweet.

I kept looking for the perfect lemon cupcake recipe and this one is the best! It's moist and fluffy. Some  other recipes are too muffiny. I put 5 blueberries into each cupcake, cut a hole in the top and filled it with lemon curd. Soooo amazing!

Delicious!  Didn't have self-rising flour (so added 1 tsp baking powder per cup of flour) and used almond milk instead of regular milk.  Nice and fluffy and light.

I just tried this recipe....I was reluctant to preheat at 375 but followed the directions, that was a mistake...17 minutes at 375 was not right.  Also, the batter does not have a lemon flavor at all, if that's what you are looking for you should definitely change the vanilla extra to lemon.

Not impressed.  The cupcakes were dry and bland. Fortunately I filled them with a raspberry sauce that gave them flavour so they were edible, but I definitely won't use the recipe again.

I used baking soda with all-purpose flour as some suggested, and these turned out very flat. They don't seem to have enough lemon flavor. I'm hoping the frosting adds to the flavor. I baked them ahead for a party, and will frost later.

First off, my results were probably due to my error at some point with this recipe. I thought I followed all exactly as written with the exception of adding 1 tablespoons more lemon juice and 1 teaspoon more zest.  Well, the results were that my cupcakes rose majestically while in the oven and fell equally so. I ended up with cupcake craters. I do dislike wasting food so rather than toss them I scraped the edges into the center of the cupcakes and then just covered them up with the frosting. They were by no means the prettiest cakes I ever made but I'm glad I salvaged them as they do taste good. Anyone have any idea why my cakes caved? I've never used the self-rising flour before and live in a high altitude area. I would like to try this recipe again and hope for more visually appealing results.

Perfect lemon cupcake recipe. Totally delish. However I wasn't a lover of the whipped icing - wish I would have used a buttercream.  I crushed Lemon Heads and sprinkled on top of the icing also - decorative and yummy addition.

I really liked these. I have made them as written and I have made them with a few alterations. Egg white only& add 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract double lemon zest. That's my favorite. Either way great easy recipe. Thanks for shareing. Maybe I will try the frosting one time. I usually just put them into a zip lock bag and let the natural sugars create a glossy top. Goooood!

I made the batter in the food processor and mis read the instructions and didn't put the lemon juice in and they still turned out great.  My husband and son are busy eating the whole batch and I don't think there will be any left to frost.  I'm happy to have found a good lemon cupcake recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Cupcakes were light, fluffy & moist. I made these for my daughters birthday and they were a hit! I followed the recipe for the cake portion then put a tablespoon of batter in the bottom of each paper then added a teaspoon of homemade strawberry freezer jam then covered with a heaping tablespoon of batter.  I iced mine with a swirl of lemon cream cheese frosting I made with cream cheese, the juice of one lemon and powdered sugar. They were fabulous!

This recipe was fantastic..I too, could not help but to keep tasting the batter. I used cool whip instead (just use double the amount df whipping cream asked for) and put some lemon zest on the top for color and a bit of extra flavor.   Delicious and beautiful!

Light and not too sweet, just perfect! I followed the recipe exactly as written, and they turned out wonderfully. I love that they are sweet but not too sweet, as well as how light and fluffy both the icing and cake are. Thank you for such a great recipe!

My cupcakes turned out too dense which I felt was due to mixing with a stand mixer instead of by hand.  I would recommend adding baking powder like others suggested.  Unfortunately I did not the first time around. I baked at 350.  Great flavor which makes it worth trying again.

Lovely taste and texture for the better recipe. I can't speak to the icing add I paired this with a raspberry buttercream, but it worked very well. This recipe is a keeper!

I made mini cupcakes with this recipe and baked them at 180C for 14minutes and the changes I made to the batter were instead of using 400g of sugar, I used 340g. I also used the seeds of one vanilla pod to replace the vanilla extract. this gave the cupcakes lovely spots! also for the frosting, I added about 5ml more lemon juice for I wanted a nice lemony flavor. 
These cupcakes were great!

I just made these tonight and they were so good.  I added 2 more tablespoons of lemon juice to the cupcakes.  And instead of using the lemon cream frosting I made a lemon cream cheese buttercream frosting.

I loved this recipe! the bread was very light and delicious.The frosting was just perfect sweet!! loved it! Only change was I added a tsp to a cup of flour as suggested by some reviewers because I did not have the self rising type and topped the cupcake with slightly toasted almonds.Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I used a little extra lemon juice and zest though, since I thought the original amount wouldn't be enough. Also, I used a strawberry cream cheese icing [that I got a recipe for] instead of lemon cream, then topped each cupcake with a single strawberry! They were so delicious and amazing! Definitely recommend these and will definitely make these again! [Maybe with a different kind of icing next time]?

Nice cupcake.  Increased the lemon juice a bit, based on other reviewers suggestions.  Fairly moist and not too crumbly.  I used a different frosting. Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this- it's my first baking attempt! The cupcakes turned out great. I skipped the icing, and I reduced the sugar to 300g instead. The end result was good, the cupcakes weren't too sweet. But I would definitely add at least double the amount of lemon juice, because the current recipe only gives a slight lemon hint! Definitely going to try this again!

The texture is lovely and they are indeed nice and fluffy but they don't taste lemony at all. I did not make the icing.

Light, fluffy and melt in mouth! Absolutely gorgeous light lemon flavor. My cupcakes tend to be a hit and miss ( beginner's luck on the hits) so I took the advice of getting a kitchen measuring scale, converted cups to gms and followed directions. This recipe is PERFECT! What started with a batch of 12 dwindled to 7 before I could get the icing in place. Thank you!

I followed the recipe to the letter, but these were horrible.  They were very dense. Cupcakes did not go well with the lemon whip cream, which was good.

These came out nicely.  I made 1 5/8-inch mini-cupcakes, and I was able to get 7 dozen out of this recipe.


I had major problems with the icing, as the cream kept curdling when I added the lemon juice.  I tried that two times and ended up tossing it.  Instead, I made icing from butter and confectioner's sugar, adding just a little cream and NO lemon juice.


 I added one teaspoon of baking powder per cup of all-purpose flour.  That seemed to work out fine.


Some bakers said these were super-sweet or that they were super-oily.  Neither was the case on my cupcakes.  I actually would have liked them a tad more moist and maybe a touch sweeter and more lemony.


I put a single blueberry on the tops of some of them, some almonds on the tops of others, and some yellow sugar on the tops of the rest.  They looked cute on the tray.  I tried uploading a picture, but I am having technical difficulties.


In summary, with the change in icing, they were very nice and they went like hotcakes at book club, with everybody raving about them!

Moist, slightly dense, flavor not too strong and not too mild. Frosting had a funny look to it by the time all the mixing was done, but still tasted great and looked good on the cupcakes.

Yummie cupcakes.  If you can ignore the copious amounts of butter/sugar, the taste is delicious.  I added a bit too much extra lemon, and it was a bit tangier than I was hoping for, but still delicious.  Frosting was nice, but not necessary because the cake was flavorful enough!

I thought they came out all right..... But then again I filled the tins too much and they ended up like dry muffins... But tasted okay nonetheless, and since I had no heavy cream for the icing I found AR's amazing quick and easy Lemon Icing recipe. 
I highly recommend this.

Best cupcakes was EVER! Made these into both cupcakes and a three tiered heart cake for my daughter's birthday, and was FLOORED by how delicious and moist these were! The batter rose beautifully and evenly on the cupcakes, with a perfect little dome. The cakes rose a bit more, so had to be trimmed flat, but it came out PERFECT! Thank you!

Loved this recipe. Instead of the lemon icing I used cream cheese frosting to get the combined tasted. I learned that the recipe tastes best when you make the lemon juice yourself.

The flavor of the cupcakes was delicious, but they were dry which was disappointing.  When you make the effort to make cupcakes from scratch, you want them to taste better than a mix (which they did in terms of flavor) and to be nice and moist.  I may try this again and add a package of pudding mix and see if that helps.

My cupcakes somehow were a bit firmer than I expected, tasting more like a cake than a moist fluffy cupcake. 

The lemon taste was perfect.

I'd suggest using buttercream icing rather than the lemon cream icing in this recipe, it's super super light and tastes more like whipped cream than frosting. 

I'm definitely gonna try making these again though!

These cupcakes are amazing!

I was a little nervous/ not expecting anything exceptional after reading some reviews saying they were oily or dense so I made some very light modifications.
-I doubled the vanilla extract (just because I always do and NEVER regret it!)
-I used 1tsp baking powder per cup of flour since I didn't have self rising flour
-I used about 2 tablespoons less butter (not because I planned on it but because I just didn't have exactly 2 cups!)

When I took the cupcakes out they were a little oily on the bottom which made me nervous... then I tested one... WOW! It was wonderful! The butter flavor along with the lemon was exceptional! They were light and airy and packed with deliciousness! I think the problem people were running into with their cupcakes coming out too dense is they were probably over or under mixing the eggs. I made this recipe without an electric mixer, which gave me a little more control (but took FOREVER!).

My advice: DO NOT spray your cupcake tin! I know some people like to do that, but these do not need it at all!

We really liked these cupcakes. I used all purpose flour with some baking powder because I didn't have any self rising flower. My cupcakes turned out slightly dense but since I didn't follow the recipe exactly I can't complain about that.I also added a lot more lemon zest than specified in the recipe. However I feel like I could use this recipe as a lemon poppy seed muffin without problems. The batter was absolutely delicious! Also the frosting was light and delicious I will certainly make these again!

Seriously the best lemon cupcake recipe I've made. Moist, fairly dense and a light lemon flavor. If you like a stronger lemon taste I would add a bit more zest and juice or some lemon extract. I isn't have whole milk so I used half skim/half buttermilk. Topped them with a fresh raspberry buttercream. Delicious!!!

Delicious!  I also used regular white flour and baking soda.  I had left over choc. icing so used that and didn't feel that these were over the top lemon flavored, but the cake was light and fluffy.

WONDERFUL. The batter was smooth and I love a cupcake that does not stick to the cupcake liner. Great taste. I did not pair with the frosting as this cupcake was being submitted into a fair. This is a keeper.

I had to add my own lemon juice, though it's not listed in the recipe for the batter, just to make it taste like lemon. I was at first a little suspicious as to why this recipe called for butter as I do not think cakes normally do. Anyway this should have led me to skip the butter altogether. Yet I added only half the butter the recipe called for instead and it still ended up tasting like a greasy, fried, buttery cake-like dish. Try another cake recipe! (Such as one without butter!)

I didn't use self rising flour so i just use all purpose flour and add baking powder like marylee did. The lemon cupcakes turn out great. All my friends and family loved it. Everyone wants to eat it and they cant stop haha.

This is a great recipe. I did add more zest and lemon juice. It just needed more. Then I filled them with Raspberry Sauce recipe from this site and topped with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site. AMAZING combo.

Don't put in less of the zest! I could only get a little shy or 1 T because my lemons were so ripe. I put in about a teaspoon more lemon juice and the same amount of lemon flavoring. I couldn't taste any lemon. So don't put less of the zest

The cupcakes came out flat and spread on the cupcake tin. I used the self-rising flour. That too was a mistake. I should have just used all-purpose with some baking soda. Then, following the icing directions, which certainly aren't difficult, my icing separated. My first thought was that 5 minutes was way too long but then I had never made cream icing before so I told myself to just follow the directions. I think I'll just by some from the store and call it quits. I made some chocolate cupcakes before this batch and they came out wonderful. So I give the cupcakes 3 stars because the flavor is good even if the appearance isn't, and the icing 1 star.

As written, it doesn't have a very lemony flavor, but it did turn out moist and light for a made-from-scratch cake. With the right lemony frosting, though, it's a yummy treat.

I really thought that looked good but that portions are off. You have to make sure to use self-rising flour or all purpose with some baking soda. I ended up adding a 1/2 cup of sugar and 3/4 cup of flour to this recipe. Before I added this things my cupcakes were flat and tasteless, with no form. After I added the flour and sugar they turned out perfect.

The cake it's self was good, I did make my own changes. While they were still warm fresh out of the oven, I poured a 1/2 tsp of lemon juice over the top of each cake. I also hollowed the centers and filled with fresh blueberry compote. Was not pleased with the frosting so I made lemon cream cheese frosting and topped with a drizzel of juice from the blueberry compote.

After baking for about 8 hours and several trips to my garbage, I fell upon this recipe.  I was tired of every recipe coming out like pound cake, shrinking, or just being "off" on flavor.  I was looking for a light and fluffy texture with a medium lemon taste.  I needed to pair it with a Limoncello butter cream frosting, and this recipe worked excellent.  I made two dozen for a 25th Wedding Anniversary, and they were a HUGE hit!  I did make a few changes, I omitted the salt (salt is already in most self-rising flowers) and substituted Lemoncello for the v.extract.  If anyone wants my Lemoncello butter cream frosting, email me!

I have made this recipe a couple of times and have been disappointed in the denseness and dryness of these cupcakes. Maybe it is because I make jumbo cupcakes instead of regular ones but they have always turned out dry.Next time I may add some vegitable oil to the batter to give it some mistness.  On the other hand, the lemon flavor is wonderful and even though this does take a few more steps to put together, it is a good recipe overall. Like many other reviewers, I used regular flour and added 3 tsp of baking powder. I also used a different frosting recipe.

This recipe is wonderful. I didn't use the frosting, instead I made vanilla buttercream but the cake itself tastes delicious and rose up beautifully. Like the others, I didn't have self-rising flour so I added 3 tsp of baking powder. It went off without a hitch. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

I would have never thought to make an icing like this, but it went with the lemon cupcakes so well!  I added some yellow food color gel to the icing for looks.  The icing piped well too!

I made this for the first time for my boyfriend's birthday, he thoroughly enjoyed it as it was not too sweet and the lemon flavour was subtle. I made this recipe into a cake but I do think it is better as cupcakes, frosting or icing is not necessary in my opinion as it was perfect just on it's own. I reduced the amount of sugar in this recipe as well but added more lemon juice instead. Overall, I would make this recipe again; it is a very light cupcake to indulge in.

I substituted all purpose flour for cake flour & put 1 tsp of Baking powder for every cup of flour used, as said in one of the reviews. It turned out fine. I doubled the vanilla extract as well. I skipped the icing ingredients & used Non-dairy Pastry Pride Ready to whip topping for a lighter frosting w/a tinged of Vanilla extract. Everyone liked it!
