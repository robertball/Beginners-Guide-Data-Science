This recipe was in my Taste of Home Recipe Collection Magazine & I was looking for a different pasta salad recipe. I made this for the first time a few summers ago & per my husbands request, I make it all throughout the summer since. The ONLY slight change I made was, I used Apple Cider Vinegar to give it a little bit sweeter taste in the dressing. I've made this when friends are over & they LOVE it. A co-worker loves poppy seeds & I gave her this recipe & she raved. Great recipe & one that I happily share.

The dressing was tangy by itself but it didn't stand up to all the ingredients in the salad. I was pretty disappointed by this one. It was just okay...

Excellent!  Next time I will add one more clove of garlic to the dressing.  I added an 8 oz. can of water chestnuts for a little extra crunch and would suggest doing that.  Mozarrella would be a good choice for cheese also.  Very versatile recipe, I would highly recommend it!

This is a solid pasta salad. Red Wine vinegar works well enough in a pinch, too.
