This Rhubarb Bread Pudding was delicious.  I followed the recipe as submitted, but made a rum sauce and served the sauce warm over the warm bread pudding (topped with whipped cream).  It was moist and delicious.  Since I was not sure how small to chop the rhubarb pieces, I made them rather small.  Next time I will make the rhubarb pieces a medium size chop for a stronger tart flavor.

I just took this out of the oven and couldn't wait to dive in - it smelled heavenly! I just added a little whipped cream on top and it is DELISH! I used some old hot dog buns and frozen rhubarb from last year (drained VERY well). I was concerned it might be too sweet with the sweetened condensed milk and added sugar but worried for nothing - don't change anything. I had extra bread and rhubarb so I used a 9x9 pan but it was still done in 1 hour. I will be begging friends and neighbors for any extra rhubarb to make again! UPDATE: Just made this using 1 pint fresh blueberries (on sale for 99 cents!) and it was just as good, if not better, than the original. Also used almond extract instead of vanilla. Love this recipe!

This was frugal and fantastic. I used up all the leftover hot dog buns, bread heels and dried out whole wheat rolls that I had accumulated in the freezer and it was delicious. Followed the directions to a "t" and maybe used 2 1/2 cups of rhubarb, diced 1/2 inch. Put a dab of vanilla ice cream on it and we ate it for dessert. Definitely will make this again!

Excellent recipe.  I didn't use the additional sugar, it was plenty sweet enough with the sweetened condensed milk.  I also only used 4 eggs (what I had).

This was GREAT.  Everyone enjoyed it and it ended up being a 9x12 dish.  I used 2 cans of 250ml sweetened milk which is more then a 14 oz can .  I would use a bit more rhubarb and slice them 1/2 in thick instead of 1/4 in and then there would be more flavor distinction.  i also used up old buns from the freezer which worked just fine.

This rates right up there as one of the best bread puddings I've had.  I followed the recipe exactly and I really liked the soft, but not mushy, texture that you find with some bread puddings.  I topped with whipped cream, but a good vanilla cream sauce would suit this well.

Great Recipe, agree that it did need more rhubarb so increased to 4 cups and baked in a stoneware 9x9 pan. Delicious!!

Comes out lovely and crunchy on top. Kids loved it, and it reheats well. I used 1.5cm pieces of rhubarb as suggested by previous reviewer to add extra tang. Great recipe, thankyou!

This was awesome. I didn't change a thing and it turned out perfectly in the water bath.

I chose this recipe because the only milk I had on hand was a can of sweetened condensed milk. This will be my go-to bread pudding recipe. I needed to use up a loaf of Portuguese sweet bread.  I didn't have rhubarb. I used only two tablespoons of sugar because the bread is sweet. It came out perfect. Just delicious. Nice texture. It was very well recieved. Now I will be waiting for my rhubarb to sprout so I can make it as it's supposed to be! Thank you!

only change was I used 4 cups of rhubarb - and it turned out great!  best served warm but for leftovers I gave it a quick spray of pam and fried in a non-stick pan for a few minutes on each side - YUM!  oh yes, I did use splenda instead of the sugar. this totally filled a 2 quart glass casserole.  I could have cooked it maybe 10 more minutes because of the extra rhubarb.  thanks for the easy and great recipe!

Really delicious! A bit sweet. If I make it again, I might experiment by leaving out the sugar and just letting the condensed milk sweeten it.

I made this using peaches rather than rhubarb, so I cut back the sugar a little bit, and it's delicious! This will definitely be my go to recipe to use up bread ends!

The bread pudding part of this turned out very nicely, but I wish it had a more "rhubarb-y" flavor overall.  As written, it seemed to have only a minimal flavor of rhubarb and was more sweet than tart.
