I must've not made them correctly because they were very wet and sticky, but I gave 5 stars because they were still DELICIOUS!  I will make these again; hopefully, the right way next time.

Yum... good base recipe using almond flour.  I liked the texture and the mild flavor it added.  Will make again and jazz up with some other things.. wanted to make per recipe first time
