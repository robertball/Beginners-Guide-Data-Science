Absolutely deee- licious! Really easy to prepare most of the ingredients in advance, so when you get in from work, it's ready in minutes. Tastes even better than it looks.

Lose the cheese, the half-and half and all of the useless calories. Use 3/4 teaspoon tarragon when cooking the chicken then 3/4 teaspoon tarragon to create a basic cream sauce with flour, light butter or margarine and skim milk. Same flavor, delicious over whole wheat noodles. A much healthier alternative.

Rich cheesy sauce...this is my kind of chicken pasta dish!  Very satisfying and filling.  I used 2% milk instead of the half and half and a combination of cheese that I had in my refrigerator: Monterey Jack, Cheddar and Mozzarella.

I made several changes, but overall we liked the basic recipe. First, substituted 3/4 cup Monterey Jack (for 4 servings) with 1/2 cup low-fat cream cheese and substituted cream with equivalent volume of skim milk.  The cream cheese provided sufficient creaminess. To provide an extra "kick", I added 1/3 cup dry vermouth to the chicken at the end of saute.  I could have added more liquid (either milk or wine/vermouth) for a more fluid sauce.  Overall, very good flavor.   I agree with Joannah that fewer peppers would enhance the dish. Would definitely make again with similar modifications.

I only had red peppers, so I omitted the yellow. I also didn't have plain monterey jack so I used a blend with cheddar for the sauce. I loved it, but my husband didn't like it because he felt the peppers overpowered the sauce. If I made it again I would probably use either half the peppers, or omit completely.

I would give this a 3. I liked the recipe - but I'm not sure what everyone meant about too many peppers. If anything, I could have used MORE peppers! Not amazing...good for a basic chicken pasta recipe.
