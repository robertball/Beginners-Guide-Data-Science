This also works with leftover salsa chicken, which is what I used (it's the same idea only the chicken is cooked in the slow cooker with the taco seasoning and salsa, then shredded). I did add a bit of shredded sharp cheddar to the filling and I made a sour cream/salsa mix to dip them into. The family loved them--they are messy but noone really cared. Next time, I would double the recipe.
