I cook for a very picky and sometimes critical eaters. However, last night from the top critic....Delicious, thumbs up and its a keeper!Usually I get  just a TASTY! Per usual I read other reviews first and made adjustments: I added a few strips of crumbled cooked bacon. Added 2 cloves of garlic to the onions and sauteed in the bacon fat.  Added half the bacon,pepper flakes,and a dash of garlic powder to cream mixture and thickened on low. In a casserole dish I added the pasta to the sauce in several pours.(Otherwise too little sauce,I did not use all of the pasta). Sprinkled with remaining bacon and topped with cheese mixture and parsley. Will surely double the sauce next time!

I truly must have done something wrong.  I really liked the idea...and we are big cheese fans.  This didn't turn out as I had hoped.  I was very gritty and didn't have very much flavor.  I think I will try again to see if it was my blunder or just not for us.  All the same, thanks for posting.

It was really good, but reading reviews before I cooked it kinda helped. I kept it covered with foil while baking and topped it with baked, crumbled pancetta with also doubling the sauce. I added 2 cloves minced garlic with the onions and added 1 tableapoon parsley. Turned out really really good! Thank you for the recipe!

I used this recipe as a starter,  I used milk instead of heavy cream. Then to cook it I covered it with foil which kept it from drying out.

It was a little dry- I followed others' suggestions and upped the amount of heavy cream and also used 2 cloves of garlic. I think next time I might just double the sauce recipe for the amount of pasta recommended. Thanks for sharing!

I don't thnk you recipe  critics understand that the sauce for fettuccini is supposed to be a very  little amount as it is very rich, this is not down home mac and cheese.  It is also a plain dish flavored with the richness of the cream, butter, and parmesan, when you begin to change too much you have created another whole recipe.

i saut√©ed chopped onion, minced garlic, and some sliced mushrooms in butter and olive oil. then added one cup of fat free half & half and one cup of milk along with the cheeses. in addition to the black pepper, i also added ground nutmeg and some white wine. fresh thyme would also go well in this dish. poured in the baking dish over the noodles and some fresh peas. with these additions, it was no longer bland!

Very good! I wasn't sure if it'd be bland, based on other reviews, so I added lots of parmesean cheese, minced garlic, salt and pepper. I really, really liked it! I would suggest adding grilled chicken, peas and spinich (or maybe even asparagus)to give it some more flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a keeper. I have made this recipe several times and my family loves eating it. I add a little parsley to the top and use only freshly grated cheese.

This was pretty good.  I made a few changes which I think improved it:  added 2 cloves minced garlic to the onions when sauteing, then 1/2 large zucchini and 1/2 large summer squash, sliced, until soft.  Without the vegis this would have been very plain.  Good taste, though.

I like this, but it's a little boring. The last time I made it, I intended to add chicken, but it wasn't defrosted in time. As far as being dry -- I would say it's more like a casserole than like a pasta sauce would get in a restaurant, and I'm okay with that.

This is pretty good with a few touches.  I wish I could give 3.5 stars, but since it's an easy fix I'll round it up to 4.  First, as others stated, there is hardly enough sauce and it seems rather dry.  Definitely cover with foil and remove the foil for the last few minutes to brown the cheese on top, and either use less pasta or make a little more sauce.  I also added garlic, sliced mushrooms, and frozen peas.  I served with sauteed chicken and a green salad for a nice little dinner.

This is an easy way to serve fettuccine for dinner if you are having guests and want to make it ahead of time.  I made mine in the morning and refrigerated until 30 mins before baking.  I let it sit on the counter for 30 mins and then baked it for 45-50 mins.  I liked it, and all my guests did, too.  It was a tiny bit dry so next time I plan on increasing the sauce a bit.

This was ok - I tried to use it as a main dish but it wasn't hearty enough. It was also kind of bland. I liked it well enough but the family wasn't impresed. I even used freshly grated parmesan and romano - maybe if some chicken or broccoli were added...?

I add two cloves of garlic to the onions and butter and this is the perfect dish with a steak or chicken breast off the grill.

I followed the recipe exept I didn't bake it and it turned out great. All nine members in my family loved it!                                                     Thanks, Karla

I read the reviews too beforehand and added a little extra cream, garlic, mushrooms and chorizo. I fried the chorizo with the onions. I cooked it with foil over the top for most of time then uncovered to brown for 5 mins. It was really good but I think it could have done with some chorizo on top for extra crispness, and browned the top a bit me for some crunch.

I made this as a quick addition to a Mediterranean themed dinner of grilled chicken.  I added a lot of garlic (family preference) and substituted all cheese for mozzarella only with fresh cracked peppercorns.  I baked it COVERED in the oven for the time said on the recipe.  I then browned the top of the cheese with my kitchen torch.  It is now a much requested dish for dinner!

We liked this recipe, but when I took it out of the oven, it was really dry. Next time I think I will use more cream to make it more "alfredo-ey".
