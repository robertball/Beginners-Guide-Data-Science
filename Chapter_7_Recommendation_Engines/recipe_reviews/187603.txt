This was super easy to make, very pretty and tasted great.  Didn't have almond syrup so I used a drop of almond flavoring, but it really didn't need it.  The second time I made it, I used half of the whipped cream and didn't miss it.  Definitely will make this one again!

Not as much key lime flavor as I would have liked but still very good and super easy!
