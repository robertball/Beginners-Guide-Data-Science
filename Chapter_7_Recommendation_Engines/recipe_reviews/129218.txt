This recipe is awesome. Don't worry if you don't have rose water, it will still taste just fine.

Made exactly as stated and it was extremely pretty and tasted great.  Mine got a wee bit overcooked as the phone rang just before serving, but not the recipe fault.  This would be lovely as a dish to serve company and I think other fruits or nuts could be used too.

I added a grated onion to the peaches plus 1 tp of cinammon to the sugar over the peaches. I think it will be great also with quinces. In that case add more sugar.

Yummy!  This recipe hit the spot for me.  I had a bunch of peaches to use up and found this recipe.  I used breasts as it's what I had and followed another's advice and used some diced onion and a sprinkle of cinnamon as well. Will definitely add it to my rotation.  Thanks!

I added a little cinnamon and 3 sweet potatoes, cut into medallions at the beginning. This recipe has a unique flavor that I loved. Served on white rice with the pan sauce. It turned out perfect.

Excellent!  I was looking for something savory to make with an overabundance of fresh peaches, and this sounded interesting.  I loved it!  I tasted the honey-butter sauce after pouring it over the chicken, and was horrified at the extremely salty taste, but that went away.  I used the rosewater because I had it, but don't go out of your way to buy it; the flavor doesn't really come through (that was kind of a disappointment).  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts because that's all we eat, and seared them on the stovetop in a little additional butter.  I then added the sliced peaches and poured the sauce over all.  I didn't use the tablespoon of sugar.  I then put the skillet in the oven and baked for 20 minutes at 400. The result was delicious!  A bite of chicken & peach together was wonderful!  I highly recommend using the toasted slivered almonds because they add a welcome crunch and flavor.

Wonderful!  I used vanilla instead of rose water.  There were 2 pieces leftover so I am making chicken salad for lunch.

Holy Moly, I got the hubby to eat a peach!!  He usually won't have anything to do with them.  I didn't have any rose water (could have made some if I had been a little more prepared but it didn't hurt the tastiness) and I cut the skin off of the chicken thighs-butter AND skin seemed excessive.  To brown the thighs it took a little more than 15 minutes (probably 20).

I just made this dish tonight and my boyfriend and I loved it. All the flavors worked really well together and I think that it could be very versatile. The next time I make it, I think I'll add just a little garlic to the sauce but you could easily add cinnamon, cloves or any number of spices and still have it come out amazing.

I left the rose water out, as another review suggested it wouldn't make a difference. Boy, was that a bad idea! It tasted extremely bland. Don't know how it tastes with the rose water but I felt it wasn't fair for me to give this recipe a lower review since I didn't use all of the ingredients.

This is outstanding! Easy and very elegant, wonderful served with pilau. I have made this at least three times and  never seem to have enough for everyone that wants more!
I have a couple modifications that worked for us, ( but try the recipe as it is written because it is stellar as it is)
I use a large Le Creuset pot, twirl it with some EVOO, then put a layer of extremely thin slices of onion down, then lay my boneless skinless chicken thighs on top. I do not like margarine, so we use butter for the sauce instead, doubling the rose water and adding 2 t. Orange blossom water.
I do not stir to coat, just pour over, then cover the pot with the lid and put it into 400 degree F oven for about 40 minutes. At this point I remove the top, add the sliced peaches ( I omitted the extra sugar after the first time I made this because the peaches we had were very sweet already) and roast with the cover off until everything is golden perfection. 
The onions cook down into a nice dark sweet reduction that pairs well with the chicken and peach flavors.
I cannot recommend this recipe enough, it's easy, impressive, and delicious.

I think that this would be a three star recipe if not for how easy it is. Simple recipe with pretty good results.

This was great. I had some peaches on the verge of going bad and this was a great option my family loved. I used less margarine and sugar than was called for and, who has rose water on hand? It was still tasty and sweet!

Interesting idea, but not rich enough for me.  Had to add a lot of spices, but the peaches were nice and I don't usually eat them.

tasty. I added an onion and browned the chicken in a bit of oil along with the onion. Then poured the butter mixture (without rose water, didn't have any) over top and baked in the oven. Added fresh peach butter towards the end and it was lovely.

Made this during our study of Morocco in homeschool Geography. I liked it much more than I thought I would! The whole family loved it (ages 3-41).  I added 3 cloves of garlic and a bit of minced ginger to the sauce, and sprinkled 1/2 diced onion over the chicken.  Because I used frozen chicken, I baked it at 350 for 60 minutes, adding canned peaches (fresh aren't in season) sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar for the last 5 minutes. Served over white rice.

I didn't have rose water, so like others recommended I used vanilla.  I doubled the sauce because I lined the bottom of the pan with sliced sweet potatoes.  I used a quartered whole chicken. The taste was amazing and everyone loved it.  I'm giving it 4 stars only because the cooking time for bone in 4 lbs worth of chicken was WAY off.  I have to bake it more then an hour after lowering the temp to 350, however it was worth the wait even though we were 40 minutes late to the dinner party I was making this for.

I had a windfall of peach - literally, there was a wind storm that blew a bunch of ripe peaches off the neighbor's trees and as they had so much already they gave me a flat full.  

The only change was that I used boneless, skinless chicken breast because that was all I had, but it still work out well and there was enough liquid in my pan that the pieces didn't dry out.  The rosewater added a nice, subtle touch, which I appreciate - use too much of it and it's like eating perfume.  It's great served with couscous.

I will certainly make this again. I made it with sliced boneless skinless chicken breasts, no rosewater. I cooked the chicken in a cast iron skillet on the cooktop in a small amount of olive oil before baking in the same skillet.  My son thought it looked like an odd combination, but he loved it when he tasted it.

We had this for dinner tonight and it was so yummy!  It was super easy and I didn't add the extra sugar because I had a feeling it would be to sweet, and I'm sure it was the right call.

Someone used to cook a different version of this dish for me and I was craving it as I stared at a basket of nectarines that were refusing to ripen. In my nectarine version I also skipped the rose water and the almonds, and it was even better than I remembered. Best, it blew the socks off my partner also, and with a dish this sweet there is no need for dessert afterward!
