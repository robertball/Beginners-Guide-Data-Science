These are a favorite snack of ours.  At Easter, I fill little plastic cups with them as a treat for our Easter egg hunt.   The little ones really enjoy them.  During the year, a bowl of them in the refrig makes for easy snacking.  Thank you JELL-O!

I never realized that this was posted on here until just today Thanks, to SHORECOOK's wonderful photo. These are also an Easter-time staple/favorite at our house. I got the mold for these MANY years ago, and have made them for my nephews and son ever since. I like hoe they are smaller and a more snackable size. Love to mix up the flavors, as they look so pretty in a bowl. The kids AND adults just love these! :)
