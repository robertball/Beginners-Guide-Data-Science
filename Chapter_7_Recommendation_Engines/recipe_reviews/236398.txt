Very good! We really enjoyed this dish. It didn't blow me away (hence 4 stars), but it was definitely good. It's not pretty, but has a very nice flavor. I thought the wine would be overpowering - it wasn't. I did forget the parsley, but doubt that made a difference, and I used penne since my grocery didn't carry Barilla rigatoni. My only real complaint was difficult timing with things cooking in 3 different pans. Another winner from Barilla!
