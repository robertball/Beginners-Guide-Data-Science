Wow!!!! This is an incredibly moist, wonderful, chocolate cake!  The spices, chocolate, and raisins work beautifully together.  Don't wait for Christmas!

This consistently gets rave reviews, even from people who would turn their nose up at any kind of fruitcake.  It has a great taste and a nice texture, without being tough.  I've served it with Creme Anglaise, and I've also soaked it in liquor and brought it to the table aflame in Christmas pudding tradition!  I usually use a mixture of golden and purple raisins, and I substitute pecans for the walnuts.

Fabulous Cake!  It was absolutely wonderful. The only thing I won't do next time is flour the pan - with the generous amount of non-stick cooking spray I used, it wasn't necessary. Definitely a place in my home.

I was looking for a recipe here to use up some plums I had, I found this and thought it sounded very good except it didn't use plums!  I wanted to try it anyway and so what I did was pureed the plums I had and used that instead of the applesauce. The other things I did different was I  used 2/3 part white flour and 1/3 part whole wheat rather than 50/50, I did add 1 t. vanilla and baked it in a bundt pan, rather than flour the pan I  sprayed it good then dusted it with a little sugar/cinnamon (about 2 t.) this gives it a nice little crust. It did not need to bake as long in the bundt pan so I kept a close eye on it. A very good moist cake that is a bit healthier than some.

This was such an easy recipe to make and everyone really liked it. I did increase the nutmeg to a full teaspoon and added 1 tsp each of allspice and ground ginger. Otherwise I made the recipe exactly as written and the cake turned out lovely and moist. I baked it in a bundt pan and it was done after about 50 minutes. I iced the cake with a cream cheese icing flavoured with dark rum and garnished with some raspberries.

Loved it. Made a 1/2 recipe and used a 5x9 loaf pan. Very moist inside  but held shape when cut.  Used 1/2 golden raisins and 1/2 regular ones.  Also added ginger, allspice, cloves and more cinnamon; what is Christmas without spice!!.  Almost didn't use cocoa because I didn't want it "chocolate-y", but I didn't even notice cocoa (probably the added spices!).  Will make again.  It took awhile to bake   and I may have overbaked (edges were a little dark), but was waiting for  middle of  cake to spring back on"finger test"  - finally used a toothpick. Next time will use toothpick to test from start.  Made up a cooked hard sauce: 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup heavy cream, 1/2 cup sugar, and vanilla - boiled butter, cream and sugar for 5 minutes and then added vanilla after taking off heat.  Drizzled on each piece; nice complement to cake. Served cake cold and sauce was at room temp (still pourable).
