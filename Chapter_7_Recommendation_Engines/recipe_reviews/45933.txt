This recipe isn't bad. It does need a little help at the end. We found by adding 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese and litle extra salt and pepper made a world of difference...

LOVED IT!  I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk and doubled the garlic.  I added the 1/2 and 1/2 right after the seasoning since the seasoning will turn to paste and burn.  I made my own YUMMY cajun seasoning (1 tsp each: white pepper, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper and paprika-makes 2 tblspn exactly). PHENOMENOL!  (MOST recipes with high ratings turn out just ok or better if I fudge it a bit, this one is awesome!)

This one will become a regular at our house. We all liked it! I added red bell pepper when I sauteed the garlic. Add the bell pepper first, then garlic, then the shrimp. Watch the shrimp closely and remove from pan as soon as it turns pink so you don't get rubbery shrimp. I also reduced the flour (1/8 C) and added the milk slowly. I used the full amount of cajun seasoning, it was McCormick's Creole Seasoning, and maybe a dash more. (It wasn't too spicy for us) I added black pepper to finish and left off the salt and lemon juice. I will make this for friends soon!

I used to work in a restaurant which served a similar dish.  It was my favorite!  I gave this recipe a shot in hopes it would be just a tasty.  It was close.  Though my husband and I like spicy food, I thought the Cajun spice was a little overwhelming.  I will use a little less next time.

Very tasty and spicy!  Next time I will use a little less cajun seasoning - probably only 1 tbsp.  To avoid the "flour taste" as one reviewer had, add more butter or margarine to cook the flour.  I added some snap peas to the dish for more color.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

VERY tasty:-)  I substituted McCormick's Steak Rub for the cajun seasoning & it turned out great!  However, when adding the seasoning to the skillet, you must only combine it with the butter until a paste forms - DO NOT COOK FOR 5 WHOLE MINUTES! If you did that before adding any liquid, it would result in a burn (this should be obvious to anyone over 10, no biggie, just adjust!).  Easy prep, a short ingredient list & yummy flavor make this a wonderful recipe!

Maybe my cajun seasoning was extra spicy but, as written, this recipe is so spicy that we had to throw the whole thing out and I only used about 1 1/2T!  I like spicy food but this was over the top!  The flavor would be good without so much spice (I think.  I'm going to try again with 2 teaspoons of seasoning.

Pretty good... the flour adds more of a "gravy" flavor in stead of a "sauce" flavor...

Great receipe. The only tweaking I did was add 3 times the amount of garlic and some hot sauce for an extra kick. All in all very good receipe. Entire family and guests absolutely loved it. Thanks for posting this receipe.

Seeing as it was Valentine’s Day & I didn’t think leftovers were appropriate for dinner, I quickly printed the recipe with only glancing at the ingredients before leaving work. In the end my husband & I thought this was a fabulous recipe! The things I modified: 3 cloves of garlic, 1.5lbs of shrimp, a little more butter (when I added the flour), 1tbsp of Cajun seasoning. I can’t imagine cooking the seasoning & flour for 5 minutes as it was a paste so I whisked in the milk then cooked it for 5 minutes. I will absolutely make this recipe again! It was so easy & it tasted GREAT!

Delicious and easy. I doubled the garlic and added a dash of basil, oregano and parsley for a little color. My pickiest eater had seconds and said it was great. Thanks!

I am a cajun man from New Orleans and i chose your recipe cause it was just what i was looking for to cook for my wife and i. It came out perfect with a nice tossed salad and homemade garlic bread, and a glass of white wine to compliment the dish. I also added as a garnishment some fresh chopped parsley and freshly grated parmasean cheese. Ce' Si Bon'

THIS DISH WAS VERY GOOD. I USED OTHER PEOPLES ADVICE AND ADDED 1/2 C. OF PARMESEAN CHEESE. I ALSO ADDED OLD BAY SEASONING TO THE SHRIMP BEFORE COOKING IT IN THE BUTTER AND USED TONI CHACHERI SEASONING TO THE SAUCE. VERY GOOD!

Not sure if I did something wrong but the sauce was way too much like gravy and I didn't care for it at all. My husband liked it, but I don't think I will be making it again.

WOW, was this spicy and salty! I followed the recipe because I wasn't familiar with Cajun seasoning. Big mistake. Next time I'm definitely going to cut it down to about a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning, and omit the salt. I was able to eat a bowl, but my fiance couldn't finish more than one bite. I think with modifications it could be great, though--hence the 3 stars.

It was really good, the 2nd time I made it. The first time I followed the recipe and it didn't turn out at all! The recipe calls for WAY to much cajun seasoning. It was super over powering. So I threw that out, and re-did it, with less cajun seasoning and it was absolutely delicious.

OK recipe.  Roux seemed kinda strange for this type of dish, but tasted good. I added red peppers & sauteed fresh mushrooms in an extra tablespoon of butter before making the roux, this gave it more flavor in addition to the spice.

My husband thought this was excellent and that's saying a lot since he's not a big pasta eater. My Mom and I loved it as well. 
I doubled the recipe (8 servings instead of four) so i found the 1/4 cup of cajun seasoning it called for to be a bit much, 
I used 1/8 cup of Tony Chachere's (my favorite), added some black pepper (to taste), 
added 1-1/2 cups of shredded parmesan cheese, added two cups cooked fresh spinach (I would use more spinach next time this is just what I had on hand), 
omitted the lemon juice and salt (I do not cook with salt). 
I also only used one 8 oz package of pasta instead of the two it recommends and it came out perfectly! I highly recommend!!!

Glad I read the reviews first, used half milk/half cream.  Tasted the sauce after simmering for a while and it was very bland.  Added ~1/2 cup of Parmesan (slowly added and stirred into the sauce) and several pinches of black pepper.  After these additions, the sauce was delicious, but not spicy (I like a fair amount of heat).  I think this would be even more amazing with blackened chicken instead of shrimp.

Excellent!  A bit spicy for me and the kids, hubby loved it though.  We sprinkled diced tomato over the top at the end and that was a nice touch.

This is a perfect recipe with many options!!! I used spaghetti, garlic, salt, sugar, milk, butter, all purpose flour, and chicken instead of shrimp. I seasoned it according to my taste, and it turned out purrrrrfect!!..And of course, it would taste great as the orignal recipe as well!

Had WAY too much cajun seasoning.  I threw my first batch out and made another only using it to season after the cream sauce was made.  The recipe does say "to taste" so take that into account.  Other than the amount of seasoning, it was an easy and good recipe.  I used Tony Chachere's seasoning.

Way too spicy with the full amount of Creole Sauce. Use about 1/2 to 2/3 and should be great.  Flavors were excellent just too over the top.

Very good!  I use a salt free cajun seasoning (found the recipe on this site) so that I can control the amount of salt.  Otherwise I think that 2T of normal cajun seasoning might be too salty.  But the flavor is great and it is a very quick and easy recipe!

We loved this dish. Had to cut back on the Cajun seasoning a bit for the kiddos, but it was still good. I did add a few veggies to liven it up a bit - broccoli, red bell pepper and mushrooms.

In one word...Awsome!  I used less Tony's creole seasoning than called for (about 2 tsp) and it turned out perfect and soooo easy to make!  This is a keeper!  Just like what I've had at expensive restaurants, only a LOT less cost.

Awesome recipe...I made it on the fly today and my entire family loved it. I felt the Cajun was a bit overpowering too, so I'll just use less next time. None of my other family members complained about it being too spicy. My husband said that it was a restaurant quality from the comfor of our home and great cost.

This dish is restaurant quality! Super creamy and lots of cajun kick! I rated it 4 stars because it was a bit salty to me. I used Old Bay seasoning which may have been why (not sure). Next time I will omit the salt called for. Also, it made ALOT of sauce! I put 16 oz of noodles with this and it was still plenty saucy enough!

Excellent and so fast and easy to make!  I did use 6 large garlic cloves, added frozen peas and 3/4 cup parmasian to the sauce as it thickened. Will be making this a regular meal. Thanks.

I made this for my husband for his birthday.  He loved it. I did make a few changes though. I followed the advice from other reviews and made my own cajun seasoning from the recipe in the reviews.  Also I added red, yellow and green bell peppers as well as mushrooms.  My husband said with out adding those things the dish would have been pretty plain with just shrimp and pasta.  A few other changes I were, I made the dish with Penne pasta, I cut the flour in half and added more butter as suggested, and I only used 1 1/2 Tbsp of the seasoning.  My husband LOVES spicy food and he said it was nice and spicy for him with that amount.  He also said next time he would love it if I would add either chicken or sausage in with the shrimp (or both and have all three meats)  So I think I will try that next time.  Anyway, thanks for a great recipe, my husband ate the rest for lunch the next day!!!!

This recipe was quite good. If you are not a fan of really spicy food, I would definately recommend halfing the cajun seasoning like some others suggested. I found the 2 tablespoons made it overpowering, so go with your own taste. I also added some onion and garlic powder for some extra flavor, as well as some mushrooms and green peppers.

I made this recipe last night for my boyfriend for our 3 year anniversary and we both loved it!  I used Creole seasoning b/c I didnt have any Cajun, but it turned out great.  I used about a tablespoon and a half and it added just the right amount of kick.  This dish tasted just like a favorite of ours at the restaurant, Bahama Breeze.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent, but really spicy!  I made this last night and even the leftovers are good today.  Will definately keep this one.
Unless you are the kind of person who enjoys breaking a sweat during meals though, I would suggest cutting back on the Cajun spice a bit.

Simple ingredients, quick cook time, and great flavor. (The only ingredient that I omittedwas lemon juice because I didnt have any).  This will definitely be a repeat in my house.

I put all the ingredients in a big pan and cook till shrimp is light pink, then shake the milk and flour in a jar , pour it into pan and cook until it thickens,  Much like a gravy.  DONE.  It is so easy and everyone loved it.  Thank you for the recipe.  It is AWESOME!

restaurant quality flavor! i have no idea what people mean when they say its " too spicy." i thought it was perfect. it reminds of something i have eaten at red lobster. the only tweaks i made were adding more half and half and butter. otherwise, great recipe.

The only changes I have made is only putting 1/2 the cajun spices, it still gives enough taste but not as spicy. I also top it with shredded parmesan cheese.

Definitely enjoyed this. Just as a tip, be sure to cook the flour and seasonings just as you would if you were making gravy, otherwise you can definitely taste the flour. I used half heavy cream and half two percent milk since that was all I had in the fridge and it still turned out perfectly. Very simple, quick, tasty meal.

I made this for my family, and everyone loved it! Even my little one. It was a bit spicy, but I added a half cup of parmesan cheese to the original recipe and it deluded some spiciness. It was pretty easy to cook. One thing I would change is to add the one cup of milk before adding the spices and flour. Otherwise, it gets a bit chunky and is harder to mix in. Then add in the rest of the milk. I still give this five stars for being so dang delicious!

Only gave it 4 stars b/c I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Didn't add the extra salt or lemon juice. Increased the garlic. Added fresh spinach near the end. Served with left over spaghetti noodles and garlic cheese biscuits. Will make again. YUM! Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe once. I went ahead and made my own Cajun seasoning as well. I used 1tsp of red pepper in the place of cayenne. 1tsp of garlic powder, 1tsp of onion salt, 1tsp of lemon pepper, 1tsp of paprika and a half tsp of old bay lemon and herb seasoning. 
I also sautéed 2 cloves of garlic and green onion in the butter. The butter stays and doesn't evaporate. Don't use anything else than pure butter. Salted. I then added my shrimp and sautéed 1 minute and then removed all of it. Added my spices along with my flour and milk made it to my desired thickness. Once I felt the flour was devolved I put the shrimp and garlic along with the green onion and cooked it a bit more to allow the sauce to catch the flavor of the shrimp. I served this over linguini. 
Angel hair breaks apart too easily. But linguini is just the right amount of thickness. This recipe does need green onions to give it that extra flavor. I also added Parm to my sauce and let it cook . I will never buy pasta sauce again. Great recipe!!

I loved this recipe! The only adjustment that I made was I only added 1 cup of milk and added a can of diced tomatoes. The sauce was good, but it wasn't the kind of spicy I liked. I like creamy texture with lots of flavor. I also added some Italian seasoning. 

I will definitely make this again! One quick note, I added a little extra milk to my kids to tone down the spiciness.

Loved it. I doubled the garlic and added bell peppers, celery, rotel tomatoes and a can of cream of shrimp. I also added a few slices of Velveeta cheese at the end. My family loved it.

Was awesome... used precooked shrimp and thawed with water and worked fine.  Used the cajun seasoning found on store shelf with own grinder, worked great.  Family ate it all.  Will try to make more sauce next time by going 1/2 again flour and half again milk.  Texture was fine and should turn out similar to gravy although some reviews didn't appear to like gravy texture.  Will also try with chicken which should give same result.  Restaurant quality and great recipe.

It was INCREDIBLY SPICY!!!!!! I think otherwise, it would have been good. At the first bite, I thought I had read the recipe wrong and it really said 3 TEASPOONS instead of 3 TABLESPOONS. But alas, I was wrong and it really did say 3 TABLESPOONS. Next time, I think I might knock it down to 1 TABLESPOON. Or maybe 1 TEASPOON.

Didn't care to omuch for it, personally, but my family enjoyed it.  It was a little too thick &  salty for my liking, and the sauce didn't come anywhere close to what the picuter portrayed.

I agree with one of the other comments that the sauce was more gravy like with the flour.  The second time around I simply added half and half and Parmesan cheese for the sauce.

This sauce was great. I did tweak the recipe a little though. Instead of lemon juice, I used red peppers to brighten the sauce up. I also added andoullie sausage, used penne noodles (I think they hold the sauce better,) and used bread crumbs to thicken instead of flour (just a personal preference.) The other thing that helped the sauce, I think, was actually an accident. Of course I forgot to start my pasta soon enough, so I ended up having to let the sauce simmer for an extra 15 min. I think this was a good thing though because it really brought the flavors of the sausage and red pepper into the sauce and made it that much better.

We loved the recipe.  I ended up combining it with another and did the shrimp different than what they had in here.   See Cajun Shrimp by Donna Tomason.
Both recipes are keepers for us.

This rating is for the sauce only because I have to use chicken due to a shellfish allergy.  I don't always have heavy cream, so I like to use this flour recipe when we're in the mood for cajun chicken pasta.  It's so tasty, and my hubby loves it so much!  Thanks for the recipe!

This dish was EXCELLENT!!...I was SOO worried about how everyone was saying to reduce the Cajun...We tasted the sauce the whole time and ended up using 2 1/2 tablespoons- and it was perfecto!! My boyfriend licked his plate clean and ran back to the kitchen for more :)  Thanks for a GREAT dinner!

Terry loved it!!  I thought it was a tad too dry, but he only eats angel hair so I think that's why it tasted goopy or clumpy to me.

This dish has a pretty bold flavor, but it's wonderful for those of us that like spice.  I think the sauce is a little heavy for angel hair, so I usually use spaghetti and may try linguini in the future.  If you're having trouble with the sauce, look up the info on cooking with roux on this site, it's very helpful.  I like to serve it with asparagus and drizzle some of the sauce on them.  Definitely a keeper for this seafood lover.

This was VERY quick and easy and tasty.  However, my daughter and I found it way too spicy, and I am from south Louisiana!  I'm not sure what type of "cajun" seasoning the recipe submitter used, but I used Tony's and only 1 tablespoon instead of the 2 it called for.  Will make it again but with less than 1 tablespoon of seasoning.  By the way, my hubby did love it.

This recipe is delicious. I went by the directions 100% and it turned out very good. Biting into the shrimp was great but eating the noodles alone was somewhat plain. Next time I cook this I will add another clove of garlic and it should turn out excellent. Highly recommended!

This recipe was fast, easy, and delicious! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I made some additions... 1. I added some of the seasonings to the shrimp while it was sauteing. 2. I added 1 cup of shredded parmesan and 1/2 cup of colby-jack to the final sauce.  Overall, great recipe!!!

Maybe it was just the cajun seasoning that I used (Tony C.) but this turned out so salty that my family could barely eat it.  It wasn't too spicy, just too salty.  I will try to make it again but with less seasoning.

Made this this weekend.  I took the advice of others and made my own cajun seasoning and made it with one cup milk and one cup half and half.  This was great.  It is important to remember the salt and lemon, the two really bring out the flavor.  As good as going out.

For those of you complaining that it has a floury taste it's because you're not cooking the butter/flour mixture long enough.  You cook it stirring constantly for 4 to 5 minutes to make a roux.  I've made this several times now and have changed it quite a bit, sometimes I'll add chopped green onions cut back on the cajun seasoning and add a tsp. of red pepper flakes.  If I happen to have whipping cream on had I will sub 1/2 a cup for 1/2 cup of the milk.  I generally add Parmesan cheese near the end of the cooking cycle to add to the richness.  It's pretty versatile.

This was really good, my husband loved it, my 4 year old daughter did too (minus the shrimp).  We used whole wheat pasta to make it a little healthier and I forgot to write down how much milk to use so the sauce was a little thick, but it was still great. I ate it for lunch the next day and I usually don't go for left overs.  I'll definately make it again!

We had this last night and it will become a regular quick weeknight dinner for us.  After reading several reviews, I changed a few things to make it more suited to our tastes.  First off, I sauteed some chopped onion and bell pepper, seasoned with a little Creole seasoning (Tony's). Once the veggies were nearly tender I added the shrimp and garlic, and seasoned with a little more Tony's and a couple pinches of Aleppo pepper (so good!). When the shrimp was done, I scooped out the veggies and shrimp, leaving as much liquid in the pan as I could.  Whisked in the flour, added the milk and when it thickened, added some grated Parmesan and a good handful of thawed frozen peas. Then I put the shrimp and veggies back in the pan, then the cooked pasta.  When everything was heated thru, added some fresh parsley, a diced tomato and a couple sliced green onions. Sounds like a lot of tweaks but it actually went together in under 30 minutes and I was in no mood to make a salad, so the extra veggies made it a one dish meal. The original recipe has great "bones" but I was after something with veggies. It was amazingly delicious, and reheated great for lunch today.  Since my original review, I've made this with leftover chicken, ham and pork roast.  All were very good!

Err Mah Gerd! I just created an account just to rate the recipe as amazing!  I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk and mixed it with the flour before adding it to the pan just so it wouldn't get lumpy.  

This was so amazing!!! This will be a staple on my family from now on.

Very yummy! The spiciness sneaks up on you- but a quick and easy dish. Make sure to whisk the sauce, as it does start out lumpy!

Delicious, quick, and easy to make. I sauteed chopped onions in the butter before adding the shrimp. My cajun seasoning was really spicy, so I only added about 1 teaspoon. Followed other reviews and only used about 2 tbs of flour. Will definitely make again!

This had a good kick to it- the sauce was rather thick but that can easily be fixed with a little extra milk. I added some corn to the mix and it was a great easy dinner.

Loved this recipe. The spices were perfect and the shrimp turned out perfect (it was actually my first time cooking with shrimp.) I did add about a half of a red pepper and bit of green onion to the recipe before cooking the shrimp and garlic for a bit more colour and flavour. The portion is huge and despite having an over abundance of leftovers they were all gone before the end of the night.

Delicious!!! My only suggestions is to look at the ingredients on your Cajun Seasoning to check the salt content before mixing it in- mine was really salty so I used a little less of that and added ground cayenne. (My husband and like spicy foods.) We will definitely make this one again!

So good! I hadn't thawed the shrimp before cooking them (the recipe didn't say either way), and although they came out well I think I'd prefer them thawed next time so the pasta isn't done first. I made a makeshift cajun seasoning by combining creole and cajun pepper, and only used half the flour. I also used bowtie pasta, which was easier to scoop up with the shrimp.

This was a great recipe!  I actually served this over brown rice instead of pasta.  I used less flour and substituted heavy cream for 1/4 of the milk.  I didn't find it too spicy by any means- it may just depend on the brand of cajun seasoning.....  This meal will stay in my rotation!

Very easy, very good. I did cut the amount of cajun seasoning as other reviews stated...I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to spicy foods. I sauted some brocolli and added that to the sauce. Served this with a salad and crescent rolls. I received a lot of compliments from the family while they chowed down!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great base recipe, but I made a couple of changes.   1. Only use ONE-QUARTER of the amount of Cajun seasoning specified. I used McCormick's Perfect Pinch Cajun seasoning, and maybe's it's really spicy, but two tablespoons would have been way too much. 2. I used fettuccine pasta because I didn't have angel hair, but I'm sure angel hair pasta would be good too. 3. Reduce the amount of flour slightly, and don't cook for the full five minutes. One or two minutes is plenty. Also, I added the Cajun seasoning right before I added the milk, not with the flour, because I didn't want it to burn.   4. Don't add extra salt, but do add 1/4 to 1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan. I just whisked it in after the sauce had thickened.   With these changes, this was a super-easy recipe for a delicious shrimp pasta!

I really liked the idea of this and it tasted fine, but the consistency was very glue-ish and didn't look very appetizing. Luckily I only put in 1 tbsp of Cajun seasoning because it was super spicy. I'm not sure I'd make this again.

This was very good, I didn't think it was spicy at all but not sure if I added 2 tbls of cajun seasoning, I don't usually measure spices or seasonings out. I cooked the shrimp in a skillet in some olive oil with the garlic and cajun seasoning and made the creamy sauce in a sauce pan. This was great I would make it again, but add the full amount of cajun seasoning!

My husband really loves this one! I like to use a little half and half… it makes it creamier. I gave it four stars because it does NOT need that much cajun seasoning-- we love spicy, but 2 T was just overpowering.

I made this tonight, and everyone loved it.  I did make a few changes.  I used bay scallops instead of shrimp because I'm not crazy about shrimp, and, instead of milk, I used a 12 oz. can fat-free evaporated milk and then 4 oz. skim milk to make up the difference.  I also had some left over peppers and onions from the chicken fajitas we had the night before, so I chopped them up and added them, too, along with the chicken.  I used Luzianne cajun seasoning, and it definitely had a kick, and I'm not a hot food wimp!  I would definitely make this again; thanks for the recipe!

The sauce was incredibly bland despite being extremely spicy.  I only put about half of the cajun seasoning that the recipe called for (per prior suggestions) and the heat would creep up on you after each bite.  Yet there wasn't much flavor to the sauce.

Don't bother.  the consistancy of the sauce was all wromg.  It was like pasta with gravy.  When I cooked the flour and cajun spice blend for 5 minutes, something in the Zatarain's creole seasoning must have burnt, because the gravy had a bad finish

This is a great recipe to play with to suit your own taste!  To suit my taste, I marinated my shrimp in a little EVOO and spices (cajun & creole).  Then I used unsalted butter and sauteed my garlic and red pepper before I added my shrimp.  I reduced the flour just a little bit.  I used 1 tsp. of cajun seasoning, and added my own spices, basically winging it.  I followed other recommendations by only cooking the roux until it was just the right consistency.  Then I added half-n-half, not milk.  I added a half of roasted red pepper that I already had in the fridge.  After it was done cooking, we realized that cooking in the half-n-half would make it super rich and thick, in addition to not reducing the flour enough.  Therefore, when reheating the leftovers, I reduced a cup of chicken stock to 1/2 cup to thin it out.  In the end of the initial process, since I used unsalted butter, I used the entire 1/4 tsp. of salt and the lemon juice was just the right amount for that extra zing!  Thanks "C"!

I was desperate for a yummy recipe that didn't call for cream or parm.  This was GREAT, and we still subbed half the ingredients!  Used dried vermicelli, already cooked shrimp (mixed in at the end), and some thyme, basil, red pepper flks and white pepper for the cajun seasoning.  Used 2 cloves of garlic, and kept the roux a little thin.  My kids went wild for it, and so did I, unfortunately!

Was pretty good... I reduced the amount of seasoning, was afraid it would be too spicy for my kids. I also substituted half the milk with evaporated milk to make it a little richer. The family all enjoyed it!

It was really tasty and really easy to make.  The spice was a bit hot for the first taste but it was really flavorful. My husband and kids loved it and will make it again but hold back a little on cajun spice but we are cajun so it is not that bad to us.

Everyone in my house really liked it, the only thing that went wrong was that the pasta dried by the time I got the sauce done (and I didn't start the water until I already had the shrimp out of the butter). So everything was kind of sticky. What I suggest is waiting to boil the water for the pasta until the milk is all stirred in for the sauce. That way the pasta won't dry up before you pour the sauce over it.

This is my go to recipe for nights when I have nothing prepared for dinner! The first time I made this, I followed the directions as written (and it was pretty good) but it does allow for some variations depending on what you have or don't have on hand. I've sneaked in some onions and mushrooms a few times, and even used lemon pepper when I didn't have any lemon juice handy. Turns out yummy every time!

Normally I have a rule when trying new recipes...try as written first, then tweek if necessary after. But after reading reviews, this got adjusted on the first try. First, angel hair pasta is quick cooking. The box recommends 4 minutes or so of cooking time for al dente, more time makes a stick-together, lumpy mess. Second, I have to think that the 2 Tbls. of cajun seasoning is a typo(?). I only used 1 Tbls, and thought it was still too much. 2 teaspoons should be plenty, without it being so overwhelming. What is the reasoning for cooking the spice for so long? I let the roux cook for a minute or so before adding the milk, (cutting the flour back to heaping 2 Tbls, which was plenty)to 'bloom' the flavors and it didn't burn that way. We were 'so-so' on this dish, won't be on the regular rotation menu.

I have made this dish several times and each time it has come out a bit different. I suppose its because I make my own Cajun Seasoning...Anyhow, this time I have to recommend a couple of changes. Like other readers, I included zuchinni, a red bell pepper and 
a handful of sliced mushrooms. I cooked the veggies first in 1/2 c. of butter. Then I spooned the veggies out and set them aside. With the remaining butter in the saucepan, I melted 1/4 c butter and cooked the garlic and shrimp in it. FYI, I used pre-cooked shrimp(thawed) and took off the ends. I cooked them for about 1 minute. Then I spooned them out and set them aside. I then cooked  1/8 c. flour with 1 tbsp cajun seasoning in the same pan with the left over butter, mixing it to create a paste. Once the paste started forming I poured the milk in. I let the entire mixture simmer a bit until it thickened to my liking. Then I mixed the lemon juice, shrimp and veggies back into the sauce. I ended up serving the sauce over the pasta but the next time I make this dish I will make double the sauce so that I can mix in the pasta as well. This is one of my husbands favorite! Thanks!

This is a relatively quick recipe to prepare, and I am always very pleased with the results! The cajun seasoning can of course be altered to suit tastes - I use 2 heaping tablespoons and it has a nice kick. I have also used Cajun marindae/rub paste when I was out of the dry seasoning...either works just great! I ususally divide the butter in half and use some for the shrimp and then after removing the shrimp add the remaining butter and melt, then add the flour and seasoning...this eliminates the floury/gravy taste. I've used skim, 1% and 2% milk...and found very little difference in the taste, so if you are looking to reduce fat, try skim milk. 
Thanks for sharing the recipe!

this recipe was great.  And I was real nervous cooking the garlic.  My husband does not like a whole lot of garlic but it was perfect.  I did not have any cajun seasoning.  So I mixed the same amount of each of red pepper, paprika, black pepper, onion powder and it turned out great.  I did not change any thing left it just like it was.  Very good will make again.

I LOVE this recipe. It's become a staple in our home. Just a few changes to make it gluten free for my celiac boyfriend...
I use brown rice fettuchini pasta, and 1/8 c. corn starch in place of the flour. So simple and delicous!

I agree 100% with the review by Linds. All I tasted was cajun spice and flour. I think we would've prefered more of a cajun alfredo sauce.

This stuff was pretty awesome.  I was nervous at first that it would taste floury, and I wasn't thrilled about it when I tasted it alone, but once it was tossed with the pasta and shrimp, I was very pleased!  I will make this again.

My whole family loved this recipe! As noted in other reviews, be careful on the type and amount of cajun seasoning used - some are more potent than others. We love garlic so I added 3 cloves instead. Thanks for the great post!

This was FAR too salty and the sauce was nothing but cajun spice (cayenne!) and flour. The shrimp was great, though! I won't make again.

We LOVED this!  That being said I made some changes I should share.  I think the success of this recipe comes down to which cajun seasoning you use.  I chose to use the one suggested earlier in the reviews (equal parts black pepper, white pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, paprika).  A review earlier said that 2 TBS of that was too much and to use half.  I say use 1/4!!  We like spicy and only used a little more than a quarter(1 1/2 tsp).  THEN added additional cayenne and a little red pepper flakes.  Otherwise it would have been entirely too peppery.  (reduce or omit the white pepper?)  We like spicy, not peppery.  I didn't measure the flour - guessing more than 1/8, less than 1/4 cup; used half milk and half cream; added fresh chopped basil (good but not sure that it made the dish any better).  Don't forget the lemon juice - it gives it a fresh flavor!

Excellent recipe.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 milk and only 1/8 of a cup a flour.  I also added some chopped shallots and crawfish tails with the shrimp.

Excellent dish, although I had to add more butter as the roux was too thick.
I would try with half that am't of flour next time.  The taste was excellent.  The shrimp were very tender when cooked as instructed.

Very easy and good. I add sauteed garlic, onion, and mushrooms for flavor as well as Tony Chachere's (cajun seasoning). This is on my go-to comfort foods list!

This was an incredible dish and very easy to make.  Although I guess it does depend on the cajun seasoning you use.  I used a cajun spice recipe from here and tweeked it a little to make it extra spicy.  Very nice!

We adjusted this a bit per other reviews - less spice cajun spice, used half cream & half milk.  Wonderful - an often requested favorite in our house now!

This recipe is an absolute favorite of my families!  I did make a few changes...mostly based on what the other reviewers wrote.  To reduce the salt, I make my own cajun seasoning (1 tsp each: white pepper, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper and paprika-makes 2 tblspn exactly).  We like spicy, and that burnt our mouths off the first time I made it, so...I cut it in 1/2 and it's perfect for us. I saute portebella mushrooms and red pepers before I add the shrimp and they give it an awesome flavor.  I also use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk and cut the flour in 1/2. I've never added the lemon juice, but that's because I didn't have the the first time, and it was so good we didn't want to change the flavor.

I made this awhile ago. While the sauce had good flavor, we ended up only eating the shrimp out of it. I won't make again.

Great Recipe. I followed this recipe exactly (except I sprinkled chopped green onions on top after cooking.) and it came out beautifully.  The sauce was not too thick but it was thick enough to stay on the pasta instead of running over the entire plate.  My whole family loved it, including my teenager and my picky 5 year old.  It was not too spicy for my family, and I would suggest if a person does not like spicy foods, then don't put 2 tablespoons of hot seasoning into anything.

UPDATE*  Recently, I ran out of my cajun seasoning and couldn't find the same brand so I had to buy a different one.  Ugh, I can see why some of you didn't like this the brand makes all of the difference.  I've started using a combination of spices suggested by one of the other reviewers, it works really well.

After changing a few things we thought this recipe was excellent.   We added crab meat to the sauce, decreased the cajun seasoning by half, and substituted 1 cup of light cream instead of 1 cup of the milk.  We only used 1/8 cup flour and it was plenty. We will definitely make this recipe again.

This dish was soooo horrible. Def way to much seasoning. I love spicy stuff but this was ridiclous I took two bites and threw it out. The only suggestion I can make is use less seasoning. I won't be trying this dish again such a waste of time!

This was awesome. I cut back on the flour a bit as some said it was grainy. Turned out perfect. I used chicken as well and green onions for color. The spice was not a factor as I really love spicy food. I didnt think it was hot at all. Great recipe. My whole family raved over this one. Thanks, I have a new addition to my regular meals.

My fiance nor I liked it very much.  There was too much Cajun seasoning, and the sauce was kind of pasty from the flour.  We won't be cooking this one again.

I followed this recipe exactly.  It was soo spicy, but good.  I made my own cajun seasoning from a recipe on this site.  So, with that next time I'll cut in half and see how it is.  Better to have it alittle less than too too much.  Regardless, I will be cooking this up again!!

Very good! Do take the advice of reviewers and cut the cajun seasoning down to 1 tablespoon. Also, you will need to add around 2 teaspoons of butter (after removing cooked shrimp) to the flour mixture to prevent burning. Add this before you whisk in the milk. Do use less than the recommended amount of flour, if you need more, then add as you go. Instead of a clove of garlic, I just mixed in minced garlic. Worked the same.

Made this at my husbands birthday dinner request.Although I used a different sauce recipe this was a great guide for the amount of cajun spice to add.  I cut it down to 1 tblsp. and it was perfect for us. I used cooked shrimp and must have sauteed it too long because it was rubbery. Next time I'll start with raw shrimp. We loved it!  My husband had leftovers of it the next day and keeps asking when I will fix it again!

I didn't like it very much.  I thought it was too salty...and I didn't even use the whole 2 tbsp of cajun seasoning.  I probably won't make this again.

I really liked this a lot and it was really easy to put together. Like many others, there were changes I made that for me enhanced it.  8oz of fresh mushrooms sauted prior to adding the shrimp to the butter and about 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese at the end whisked in until smooth. I think that broccoli would be a nice addition the next time I cook it. Very good and simple : )

I used 2 tsp cajun seasoning instead of what was listed, that would have been way too much, in my opinion. I also used half n half. Otherwise, very tasty!

We liked this recipe a lot. I did change it a little and used mostly heavy cream instead of milk. Once I added parmesan to the sauce and we liked that too.  That made it more a cajun alfredo sauce. It is tasty and easy and if you have a bag of frozen shrimp you can put it in the pan not unthawed all the way and they will cook fine if you stir.  Shrimp cooks really quickly.  I like it with angel hair a little better but also good with regular spaghetti.

My husband orders Cajun shrimp pasta anytime it is on the menu at a restaurant so I decided to give this recipe a try. I added some red peppers sautéed with the garlic as suggested by another rater to give it some color and used bow tie pasta because it’s what I had available. I kept everything else as stated in the recipe and my husband and I both loved it! My son, who is 8, thought it was too spicy but I like that you can easily adjust the Cajun seasoning to your taste. Also, another good tip from someone for a beginner cook like me was to remove the shrimp as soon as they turn pink to keep them from getting too rubbery.  I will definitely add this to the dinner rotation. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

This was delicious but a little too spicy for me(us).  I did make the cajun spice recipe J. Mohojo shared in her review, using smoked paprika instead of regular. This added a nice flavor.  I did cut the cajun spice to 1T because we like a bit less heat. I think next time I'll use 2t instead and add a little extra smoked paprika because 1T was still too much for us. I also doubled the minced garlic and added another tablespoon of butter as suggested in other reviews as well as 1/4 cup+ of parmesan cheese. I look forward to making this again!

I only added 1 cup of milk and replaced the other cup with chicken broth. Also added a tablespoon of  chopped jalapeno pepper and a tablespoon of capers. Delicious!

Great, easy to make recipe that was incredibly flavorful! Cajun may be a bit much for some people, but we liked the added spice. Added some marinara sauce for a newburg like flair. Will definitely be making this again!

I was very pleasantly surprised! Everyone loves my Alfredo pasta dishes but they require so much butter, cream and cheese. This was an easy, less fat alternative that will be my new go-to quick dinner. I did follow others advice and modified the spice a little and added snap peas. Can't wait to try it with other protein and vegatable options.

Added a dash of cayenne,  reduced the milk by 1/2 cup, added 1/2 cup of white wine,  and 1/4 cup of shredded parm.   Turned out great.  Will Make Again.

You do need to cook the sauce for a while to get it to thicken. I had it in a skillet over medium heat continuously stirring and after several minutes,  the sauce suddenly thickened. It takes a while, but it will happen. 

I used Hoss' advice and added the 1/2 cup of Parmesean Cheese which added some nice flavor.

It's good, but I'd only do 1 tbsp of cajun spice instead of 2. VEEEEERY spicy if you use 2. I added some shredded parmesan to make it more creamy

used 2% milk tasted great also from other peoples recommendations cut the Cajun spice down to 1 tablespoon and 1 tsp. I might just do 1 Tablespoon next time. it wasn't horribly spicy but my wife said maybe a little less wouldn't hurt.

Update :  1 tablespoon wasn't enough I'll stick with 1 Tablespoon and 1 teaspoon.

This dish tasted amazing. I did make one adjustment, I sautéed 1 red bell pepper (will add 2 next time) and added it once the pasta and shrimp were mixed. Another thing that I will change next time I make it is add another cup of milk of put in less flour. Once the pasta began to cool off, literally after being removed from the heat, it began to dry out (was a bit dense).  The creaminess was no longer there and it was sticking too much. So again, if you want it to be creamy & loose, add another cup of milk and/or subtract a little from the all-purpose flour measurement.  The spiciness level was clearly there, if you like it less spicy then only add 1 tablespoon instead of 2 or even so 1 1/2 tablespoons.  I did NOT need to add any salt since the Cajun seasoning I used already had salt (McCormick Cajun Seasoning).

This was really good. I made it tonight and it was a hit. I did read the other reviews and reduced the amount of Cajun spice. I first added 1/2tbs and took some out for the kiddos. I added and an addtional tbs and it was plenty spicy. I did not add any addtional salt and used linguine. I also added about 2cuos chopped fresh spinach for extra veggies.

I made this for my girlfriends on one of our girls day in and it was awesome. I made a couple of changes. I used half and half instead of milk. I added 4 cloves of finely chopped garlic after the butter. I used 1 and 1/4 of the Cajun seasoning. When my sauce was a little thick I added the shrimp uncooked with chopped Portobello mushroom red yellow orange and green peppers chopped. I let it all cook in the sauce. I put in my cooked penne pasta and mixed it all in.  The final touch was shredded mozorella cheese.

Great, simple recipe. I have been trying to cut down on dairy so substituted the milk for almond milk and the butter for coconut oil. I also added in pepper and red pepper flakes to give it a little more flavor. I decreased the Cajun seasoning to about two teaspoons. My husband and I loved it and also felt like it was a bit healthier! We will definitely make this again.

I am cajun and was looking for a new way to make shrimp pasta for dinner last night when I came across this little recipe.  I decided I would give it a try because it seemed really easy.  I made a few of my own tweaks and ended up VERY impressed by this recipe.  First off I used 16 oz of Fettuccine noodles, since the sauce seemed a little heavy for angel hair.  I added my cajun spice into the butter with the garlic before sauteeing my shrimp, so to infuse them with more flavor.  The original recipe call for you to cook the roux (flour and butter) for 5 minutes, this is WAY too long.  If you want a creamy consistent sauce start adding milk as soon as you get the flour whisked into the butter.  I also added 2½ cups of milk.  Once my sauce was cooking I added about ¼ cup of fresh parmesan cheese to the sauce.  I added garlic powder, onion powder and celery salt and stirred constantly.  As soon as my pasta was done I drained and rinse with cool water then returned to pot.  I added a splash of lemon juice and shrimp back to sauce along with more cajun seasoning and salt to taste.  I then poured sauce over the noodles and cooked over medium fire for around 3 minutes to bind everything together.  It came out absolutely delicious.  I would order this in a restaurant.  From start to finish, this dish took me around 10 minutes to make!

A good start, but could use a little tweaking. For me, the amount of seasoning was too much (salty). I used Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning. I would cut it down to two tsp, and go from there. I also used 1 cup heavy whipping cream, and 1 cup skim milk (it's what we had). I'm not a pro, but I thought the sauce thickened ok. I would mix the flour/seasoning right into the liquid, so it doesn't clump in the pan. I also added andouille sausage and chicken because my kids don't really like shrimp.

I made it but made a few tweaks to the receipe.   Instead of 2 cups milk, I added 1 cup milk and 1 cup whipping cream.  OMG!  Super creamy and smooth!  And the cajun spice kicks in a little later but makes all the difference!  I hope y'all enjoy it as much as I do!  Happy eating!!!!

This dish was great and yes spicy. As other reviewers I also added basil and parsley for color. The reason I gave four stars is because I felt the sauce was too thick so I added about another half cup of milk to make it creamy.  My husband loved it and wants a repeat.  This dish was so simple and quick to make. And it's a great Lenten Friday meal!

Only giving it 4 stars because I used chicken (it's what I had) and didn't use the lemon at the end since I didn't have it. But replacing what it called for with what I had, it was GREAT!! Three picky eaters and one, as long as it doesn't eat me first eater, and there weren't any leftovers!

I tweaked it as suggested by others.  I used half  & half and milk, 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese (added when I put the shrimp back in with the sauce). I also cut the Cajun spice in half so it wasn't too hot for the wife. I will be making this again.

Pretty good. I added the  pasta back in the pan at the same time as re-adding the shrimp. I also used a half-cup less of milk & half the Cajun seasoning. The wife said she'd definitely eat this again.

I read a lot of the comments and I guess I typically use a recipe as a base and build on it.  But I really liked this recipe.  I did reduce the butter but used cream and milk...probably half cream/ half milk.  The only other thing I did was add a bit of shredded parm at the end but I think it would have been fine without it.  (Oh and I left out the lemon..I'm not a big lemon fan.)  But thanks ekawkins15...I'm keeping a copy of this recipe in my cookbook my kids get when I die.  LOL.

Excellent flavor and easy to prepare.  Make sure to use all of the milk in the recipe as the sauce tends to thicken as it cools.

This was so good and so simple to make!  The only change I made was I used 1 cup of milk and a can of cream of mushroom soup. (I only used about half the flour). I did use egg noodles instead of angel hair pasta also, I figure any kind of noodles you happen to have around would be fine.  This is one of my new favorite recipes!

I stared with red onion, corn, mushrooms, and green pepper cooking in some butter tell almost done. I then added to cloves of garlic, and the rest of the butter cooked for one min. Next I added just 1 cup of coconut milk (less fat and thicker), 1 1/2 teaspoon of club house cajun sesoning. a tsp of flour, and 1/4 grated parmesan cheese. cooked the shrimp the same as the recipe. Texture was perfect, nice consistency, not think, not thin. So yummy. Husband loved it.

Great!  I added mushrooms (per another review--mushrooms, then garlic, then shrimp) but  followed the rest to a tee.  Easy ingredients I had on hand too! Thanks!

Be sure you LOVE cajun before you make this!  I decreased to ONE tablespoon and it was quite hot!  My advice is to start with a teaspoon, taste, and add from there.  I also increased the butter, salt, and used 3 cloves of garlic.  I threw in basil and parsley for color.  I needed to add more milk, as my sauce was way too thick.  After all that, overall it was quick to make and tasty!

Reduce the sauce less, to avoid gloppy texture. Add more salt (not enough flavor).

I've made this many times and each time was as good as the last. We serve it with piping hot french bread and it's amazing. We add more Cajun spice and make more sauce because we don't like dry noodles. It's good, though, and I highly recommend it to everyone who likes cajun food. Even if you don't like spicy food, you should try it with less cajun seasoning. It's very good.

This was really good, and really easy.  The only changes I made were to reduce the cajun seasoning to one tablespoon (it was plenty salty, even so), add one teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and reduce the pasta by half.    This is a restaurant-quality dish, and I'd be proud to serve it to guests.

This recipe has too much heat for poor little me. I recommend cutting the cajun spice by half or even more, tasting, then adding more to your liking.   Change milk to half and half and adding more garlic, and some scallions or onions.

My husband made this for tonight's dinner, it was delicious. We only added 1 tblspoon of the cajun seasoning  and it was plenty. We also like spice, but 1 tblspoon was enough, we took everyones advice and started off with less. This recipe is a keeper.

After reading the reviews, I was worried about the spiciness level, so I used a 1 1/2 tbs. of Cajun Seasoning (Emeril's Bayou Blast). After I tasted the sauce though, I decided to throw in the remaining 1/2 tbs.- no one- including my spicy-sensitive mother and 8 year old- said it was too spicy. I used one cup skim milk and 1 cup half and half for the milk, though I did not consider the flour, and felt the sauce came out a wee bit too thick- like gravy, as one reviewer said- but this was my fault. This dish was pretty good and could easily be improved upon with the addition of veggies as others have noted, though I don't think I'll have a strong hankering to make this again.

My husband and I love this recipe.  It is simple and tastes great!  I do change it slightly by only using 1 tbs creole seasoning and skipping the extra salt.

I have made this recipe several times. I made some changes by adding 1+ tbsp cajun seasoning (so my kids will eat it) and I use heavy cream. I will continue making this, my kids say it is better than at any restaurant pasta.

This was soooo good!!  I pretty much followed this to a T and it turned out amazing.  I have found the cajun spice I have to be pretty salty so I didn't add any extra salt, but other than that I followed everything else.  Will definitely be making again!

Very yummy, I added a little red onion,  red bell pepper personal taste and a little extra garlic. I listened to others comments and cut back on the cajun spice and only used 1 TBL. not 2 it was not enough.  maybe my spice was not very strong, I am not into really spicy food a little kick yes but not real hot either next time I will add at least one and a half TBL. but we still loved this dish.

This was so so so YUMMY and super FAST to make!!! I doubled the sauce though because my family likes a lot.  Other then that, it is PERFECT as is!  You could even use chicken in here...heck even tuna would probably be good.  This is def gonna be something I continue to make!  Thanks!

My family loved this dish!  Next time, I will use more garlic and change my Cajun spice.  The dish was really salty but I'm chalking that up to the Cajun spice - everything else was great!!

This recipe was a pretty good base recipe! I used 3 cloves of garlic  and added some diced green peppers and 2  seeded & chopped roma tomatoes which added nice flavor and color. I added salt to taste and ended up using about 1 tsp of salt. I served this with garlic bread sticks & a salad.

This was excellent. I didn't have angel hair pasta, so I used cheese tortellini instead. I had some leftover artichoke hearts and green pepper, so I added them when cooking the shrimp. I also topped with cajun grilled chicken because I didn't have very much shrimp. Final touch was some grated parmesan and chopped green onion. Very tasty!!

We loved this recipe and will definitely make it again. Like many others, I only used 1 tablespoon of Cajun seasoning and it was plenty. (My husband likes his food extra spicy, and he agreed that 2 tablespoons would have been too much.)  I made the same modifications as another reader because I had frozen cooked shrimp on hand: I mixed the dry ingredients ahead of time. Then I melted the butter, added the dry ingredients, cooked the mixture for 5 minutes, and added minced garlic from the fridge. After a minute, I slowly added the milk, brought the sauce to a boil, and added the defrosted shrimp, cooking until heated through. I added the lemon juice at the end.

I used chicken instead of shrimp. I dredged the chicken in flour and cajun seasoning. I also added parmesean cheese. The sauce and chicken turned out great unfortunatly I over cooked the pasta!

I am from New Orleans and love a lot of seasoning.  2 tablespoons of seasoning is way too much.  It was so salty, my husband and I could not eat it.

Like most, I really liked this recipe.  We will likely use half the flour like some of the other reviewers.  We also added some tomatoes (plum) and fresh herbs like parsley on top.  It just makes for a pretty presentation.  Also want to try it with sauteed red and green peppers and/or spinach. I also think the prep and cook times were a little on the low side.  It took a little longer to complete but as is, great recipe.  I will make this again.

This recipe tasted great and was very easy to make. I used a little less than 1/2 tbsp. cajun seasoning and then added a little steak seasoning. It was nice and creamy and did not taste like flour. It's a keeper!

I was skeptical, I was used to making white sauce with heavy cream or half and half. But this turned out fantastic, really creamy. But it may be because I used 1/2 cup of italian cheeses after I whisked in the milk. I also used half fat free milk and half 2% milk. For the cajun seasonings I used a mixture of: garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, thyme, black pepper, white pepper, oregano and sugar. After the sauce began to thicken a little, and the cheeses were melted, I added in my pasta. I cooked on medium till the sauce was a good consistancy.

This may sound strange but If you use the seasoning from Emril's fried pickles recipe this cajun shrimp pasta is amazing. I had some extra spice left over and just threw it in. The sauce is creamy with a nice spicey flavor. The taste is comparable to dishes i've had from red lobster.

This was amazingly good!  I used skim milk --- still worked well.  I sprinkled the slightest bit of Parmesan on the top to serve.  Like another reader, I added red peppers for color.  Next time I'll add some green peppers or broccoli for the same reason, I think.  I might also try to reduce the butter in order to further trim calories.  It probably won't be as rich-tasting, but then again, I won't feel as guilty so it's a balance!

I love this recipe!  WOW!  Quick easy and tasty!  I have modified a few things after making it several times.  I start with a rux (two table spoons butter & two table spoons flour) I add 1 clove minced garlic to the butter in the start of the rux.  Then I add milk and spices (I don't measure any thing just eye ball it) and taste it for my families liking!  I also add veggies what ever is handy/fresh!  Try it you'll love it!

This is so good.  My boyfriend has said that I could make this everyday for dinner and he would be happy.  Two Tbsp. of cajun seasoning is too much for me so I reduce to 1 Tbsp.  I also add thinly sliced zucchini to the shrimp ans saute until tender.  For color, the last 5 minutes, I also add tomato wedges.

This wasn't too bad of a pasta dish. I found that the sauce was extra thick, almost like gravy. It was a little heavy. I also found adding salt and pepper did wonders as it was a little bland.

I seriously underestimated how spicy cajun seasoning is... I used the full 2 tablespoons and my delicate tastebuds could not handle it. However, my fiancee thought this was delicious. I did cut the flour to a little over an 1/8 cup and used half and half instead of milk (had some I needed to use up). Thickened up nicely. Thanks :)

Easy to make, but WAY too much cajun seasoning. I will definitely use about half if I try this again. It needs something to smooth it and blend it. The acid in the lemon juice didn't quite work - made it bitter. I would leave that out and maybe use some parmeson? I'll keep trying.

This recipe was DELICIOUS, however, I do have some thoughts.  One time I made this and didn't have cajun seasoning so I substituted with cayenne pepper.  It was great, we liked it better that way than with the cajun seasoning.  Next time we plan to add asparagus or other green vegetable.  It will be great.

Very good and easy recipe. I used 1/8 cup flour, half the butter, approximately 3/4T cajun seasoning, and added peas and mushrooms. In the past I've used either bowtie or penne pasta.

My BF loved this.  The only change I suggest would be less Cajun seasoning.  It was WAY saltier than I would have preferred.  I think 1TBS would be plenty.

My grandmother was born and raised in New Orleans so I've had my share of great cajun cooking. This recipe definitely makes the cut! It is quick and easy to make. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Since I'm use to the spices I did not find the cajon seasoning overwhelming. For those that are not, I recommend starting with one tsp and then gradually adding 1/4 tsp until you taste buds are satisfied.

The sauce did not have much flavor.  Next time I may experiment with adding more seasonings.  The shrimp was good, but I will most likely not be following this recipe as is.

A great dish! I reduced the cajon seasoning b/c I was weary of it being to spicy, but I added more when I tasted it. This was different and fun! Much better than grilled shrimp or a boring pasta dish! Unusual and tastey!!!

I love this recipe it's one of my favorites! It can get a little spicy, so adjust the cajun seasonings to your taste.

This was awesome! I had frozen cooked shrimp on hand. I combined all the dry ingredients in the melted butter using 3 tbls flour and 1 rounded tbls cajun seasoning. I cooked that for 5 min then added the garlic, continuing to cook an additional minute. I added the shrimp and cooked until it was heated through, added the lemon juice, poured all over the pasta and added 1/2 c parm cheese. The amount and consistency of sauce is perfect.

I added red and yellow bell peppers for taste and color.  Turned out pretty good.  Really good sauce recipe.  Good recipe when you need to make dinner fast.

It wasnt what I expected. It turned out ok, but I wish I would have used less flour, say 1/8 cup, b/c the flour overpowered my dish. Also up your seasonings if you like spice the garlic didnt come thru that much. Will make again with some adjustments.

Very good!  I lightened it a bit by using skim milk, and a combination of Smart Balance spread and margarine (instead of the butter).  It didn't compromise the recipe at all.  I used Tony's Chachere as the cajun seasoning and omitted the salt.  I think the lemon juice is key.  My son was home from college and LOVED it.  I'll definitely make this again!!!!

This is super easy and really good.  I used the full amount of spices and it was good - spicy but good.  My husband likes things spicier than me.  Next time I might cut back a little on the spice and the flour.

This is very good.  I only used one tablespoon of cajun seasoning-- it suited my taste, but my fiance put a bit of red pepper oh his.  All around a good, easy dish!

My husband and I loved this dish.  I love shrimp in my pasta!  We did use Penne instead of angel hair pasta.  And I added mushrooms, squash, and red bell pepper when I was sauteing the shrimp. Also I used twice as much garlic and sprinkled lots of old bay onto the shrimp.

great fast recipe! took me only a few minutes to make. i used the cajun seasoning substitute mentioned below since i didn't have the typical cajun seasoning. it turned out a little bland so i added red pepper flakes and some parmesan cheese. this balanced the flavors out some and i really liked it! also put it some dried parsley at the end.

I thought it could have been a lot better.  There should be a different way of cooking the shrimp, other than in butter.

Not bad.  Very spicy, even when I cut down on the cajun seasoning.  Also, the sauce was a little thick, even though I used less flour than the recipe calls for.

With this recipe you need to watch how much cajun spice you add.  I made it according to the recipe and turned out to VERY spicy.  I think it would be good with a little more flavor and a little less heat.

Very good, but man is it heavy!  Very easy and quick to make, I make it easier by using thawed cooked cocktail shrimp and throw it in last minute to warm them through.

Two tablespoons of cajun seasoning is way too much for this recipe, and I wonder if it was supposed to be 2 teaspoons, not tablespoons.  It was really good the second time I made it and adjusted the seasoning to teaspoons.

I love this site!!!
This recipe was so easy, I prepared it for my hubby who is a night shift worker. It was pipping hot and ready to plate as he turned onto our street. 
Like other posters I added my own flair mushrooms, red peppers, and lemon pepper seasoning. I also split the milk and cream, this was prepared for 8 servings so I used the amount of flour the recipe called for. 
It had a bit of a kick, but if it didn't it wouldn't have been cajun. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!! However, I  had to use quite a bit more butter than the recipe called for, and make sure that you use unsalted butter and dont use cajun seasoning with salt already in it. It was WAY salty, but that can easily be fixed by making your own cajun seasoning. I loved this dish and cant wait to make it again!! Also, I sauteed some red bell pepper with the garlic and next time I think I might add some portabella mushrooms!! YUM!! Thanks for a terrific recipe!!

Very delicious and easy to prepare dish.  I added a red bell pepper, as DDMartin recommended.  Next time, I will put less seasoning (1-1.5 tblspoons should do) and will probably skip on the salt at the end.  Very yummy!

Good recipe and easy to follow. I used whole wheat linguine pasta for the first time and there was no distinct whole wheat flavor. I used about 3/4 tbsp of cajun seasoning and 3/4 tbsp of Emeril's Bayou Blast, and it was great. I was amazed at the flavor of the sauce w/out cheese. I also added mushrooms to the sauce when it thickened along with the shrimp. I didn't add salt and it didn't seem to need any to me. My boyfriend loved it too!!!

It wasn't bad but I also didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used old Bay instead of Cajun seasoning and I added asparagus.  I would have liked it better with a different pasta rather than angel hair.  Maybe try penne or bowtie next time.

Very good and super easy to make! I made a few adjustments to my taste - added bell pepper, onion, and sliced mushrooms. This recipe would also be great with sausage instead of shrimp, might try that next time!

I'm sure there is variation in the cajun seasonings on the market, but I used the McCormick Cajun seasoning and 2 tablespoons was WAY WAY too much for this recipe.  If you are making this, start with 1 tablespoon and add more to your taste.

I have made this twice and it is good and simple.  I would be a little generous with the cajun spicing.

Wonderful recipe!  It also works great when you cut it in half (there were only two of us).  Next time I will make the whole thing for leftovers.  Thanks!

Great with a little tinkering...I agree that you need to reduce cajun seasoning to 1 TBSP, and do taste before adding any salt.  As others stated, my sauce was too thick as well.  Add some white wine or some additional milk.  Also, it needs quite a bit more garlic to give it some flavor.  I used low fat margarine instead and find this to be a pretty good "cream" sauce with much less fat than you would expect.

This is a keeper.  I think that I made it a little too spicy, but it was still very very good.  I will be making this one again.

My husband and I really like it.  I will be making it again.  Just make sure that your Creole seasoning does not have salt before adding salt to the dish, I made the mistake of adding salt in addition to the salt my Creole seasoning already had.  I also reduced the flour to 1/8 cup like others had recommended.

My family loved this recipe!!  We didn't change a thing...it's cajun, it's suppose to be spicy.  My four year old loved it too!  The sauce was the perfect consistancy and I thought the recipe was easy to follow. Thanks!!

Way too spicy as it is.  It might be better if you reduced the cajun seasoning.  Also the directions were a little confusing.  If you don't add the milk until you have cooked it for 5 minutes it would be completely burnt.  When you do add the milk first it is too runny.

I FELT THAT THE SAUCE WAS TOO THICK, & TASTED FLOURY. NOT A KEEPER!
