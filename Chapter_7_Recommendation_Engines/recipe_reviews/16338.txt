I can certainly see why Carri looked forward to this salad. Fantastic flavors all melding together to create a party for the palate. The holidays are rapidly approaching and I always like to test recipes on my family before making for dinner guests. My family says this is a keeper!

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and it is now my favorite.  The combination of flavors was perfect -- not too sweet and not too tart.  I wasn't sure if I'd like everything processed so much (I used a food processor) but the texture was fine, even though the only identifiable ingredient was a few bits of fresh cranberries.  The crunch was still there. The only change I made was that I zested both oranges before peeling/seeding, and threw the zest into the food processor.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this exactly as written for our Thanksgiving dinner at work.  Everyone raved about it!  I will be making it again next week for Thanksgiving at home.

I am not a cranberry fan, but I loved this salad.  I used cherry gelatin instead of raspberry, which did make it a little sweeter.

I can't quit eating this! Delish. I didn't have any carrots so I used an apple. I also didn't have any pineapple. It was still delicious. Next time I will try it with pineapple. Thanks!

This is pretty good. Wasn't a real big hit at my Ham dinner though. I suggest adding less Pinneapple and it works better with it. I enjoyed the taste and texture myself however.

It's good, but none of the kids ate it cause it looked like mushed-up brains.... I will use it for their halloween party.
