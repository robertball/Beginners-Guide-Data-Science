The reason I chose this recipe was because I did not have any brown sugar. Next time I will make the special trip to the store! This recipe is good for people who do not like sweet cookies. I could hardly taste the peanut butter either. I made these for a company party and I was embarrassed to admit I had cooked them.

Bleh! I doubled the peanut butter for more flavor and they were still dry and flavorless.

was not real pleased with these cookies. Did not have a peanut butter taste to them. More like short bread cookies with a hint of peanut butter

I did not really like this recipe at all. It was a pain to make because of how sticky the dough was. It also has almost no taste to it and I like strong peanut butter taste in peanut butter cookies. If you like really thick chewy and light peanut taste these would be great for you.

Prep: All the ingredients can be found in an average kitchen except for maybe the condensed milk. Preparation took about 10-15 minutes. The recipe was easy to follow and didn't use a lot of equipment so cleanup was easy. Baking notes: Easy to bake but we'd keep them in the oven a little longer. Taste: We found the cookie to be somewhat bland perhaps because the source of sweetness was only the condensed milk. We would add some sugar.

This recipe was missing the butter/margarine. My son said they were not sweet to him and you know kids. (he's a teenager with a fix for sweets)

I made these because we had a peanut butter craving... Barely had a peanut butter taste. Did add 1/3 a cup of sugar and a couple of tablespoons of water to help with the stickiness - Ended up adding a Hershey Kiss in the center of these and that gave them a little more flavor! Also I gloved up and rolled dough in to balls and they looked a lot better after baking!
