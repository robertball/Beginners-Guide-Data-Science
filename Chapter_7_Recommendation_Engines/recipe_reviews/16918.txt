Yummy salad! I've made a couple of changes to the version I take to school for lunch on a weekly basis. First, since the apple tends to get a little soggy after sitting in the fridge for awhile, I substitute Asian pear, which has a firmer texture. I also substitute chopped dried apricots for half of the dates, add a couple tablespoons of chopped walnuts, and use regular nonfat yogurt instead of lemon, all to my personal taste. This is definitely a great recipe -- makes a wonderful lunch accompanied by wheat crackers and sliced kiwi fruit.

This is such a fantastic lunch!!  I love curry and have been looking for some easy recipes!  I have found it!!

I added grapes, red peppers and crushed almonds in mine....served with Pita bread!  I will make this quite often.  Light and refreshing!  I can't believe their is no mayonaise in this.  It tastes better than regular tuna salad!  Thanks Sara!

I didn't have any yogurt on hand, so I used applesauce.  It was surprisingly very good!

I improvised a bit and threw in some dried cranberries and used just plain lowfat yogurt.  The taste was fantastic - great alternative to regular tuna salad - thanks!

This salad was a delicious change from "regular" tuna salad.  I would plan to serve it soon after it's made as the dates are pretty soggy by the next day. We like our tuna salad really creamy so I used a bit more yogurt, but I used fat free and it was perfect. That would be a good way to save a few calories.  I'll definately make this again.

One of our new favorites!!
When I make this I usually just use tuna, lemon yogurt, raisins and apples.
It might sound funny but it tastes amazing!

I enjoyed the complexity of this dish.  Surprisingly good. You must use medjool dates to get the right texture for this dish. I will use a little less curry next time so as not to overpower the tuna and fruit flavors.

Had this for breakfast, who would have thought apples and tuna go together.

This was too sweet for me. I ate it with salty, cracked pepper triscuits to offset the sweetness. I like dates, but even after cutting the amount in half, there were still too many. Also, the yogurt was too sweet; I noticed some of the reviews said they used plain yogurt, which I think definitely would have been better. The only thing I didn't add was celery because I didn't have any, but I put in celery seed. I think the crunch would have helped a little to offset how soft the dates were getting. I think this could be a good recipe with changes--I'll have to go back and see what everyone did in their reviews to make it better.

It's very sweet and has an unusual contrast with the curry. Way too sweet for me.

MMMM. It was good.  It had just the right amount of curry too.  At first I thought everything would completely overpower the tuna, but I was wrong.  It was great!  A keeper.

This recipe was terrible I did it to the T and it did not taste good at all. I won't make this again.
