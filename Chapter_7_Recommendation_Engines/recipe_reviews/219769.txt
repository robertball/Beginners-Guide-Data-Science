I only had one jar of Newman's alfredo sauce and that was plenty. I did thin it down just a touch with some organic chicken broth as it seemed to be a touch too thick. Instead of garlic salt I used garlic powder. The family thought this was very good and I was impressed it turned out so well with a jarred sauce. This was great for me as it's a while until we see payday and this used ingredients I had on hand.

I added quite a bit of cream to get it to the consistency I was wanted.  Other than the cream, I added in a good handful of fresh parsley.  I am really glad I made those two additions since it totally hid the jarred taste.  I did leave the chicken out of this recipe and served marinated grilled chicken cut on the diagonal over top.    The bacon is what made this so good, but bacon makes everything better!  I'll make this again and toss in some frozen peas.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I tweeked this just a bit (no offense, I always do).  I used packaged real bacon bits and chicken thighs to make it more budget friendly. I knew it was a hit with my husband when he said ,"we can have this again"!

Everyone loved it. We used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and will add more bacon next time.

I was hesitant to make this at first because ive never made fettuccine alfredo but i tried it and loved it like some of the other reviews it used what i had on hand and i didnt use chicken just added extra bacon and used garlic powder and garlic and herb seaoning instead of cloves and italian seasoning but for me more garlic the better will definately make this again

I left out the chicken, and substituted shrimp because I’m a pescatarian.  I cut the recipe in 3rds, because my husband was hunting. I had never used Alfredo sauce in a jar, and I found it very distasteful. The only way I would make something like this again would be to make Alfredo from scratch.

So good! I made this to eat for lunch over the course of the week. I added frozen peas to the recipe, which turned out well. I reheated it in the toaster oven by putting it in a foil pouch for 15-20 minutes, which kept the  pasta and chicken from drying out. I'll definitely be making this again!

I was looking for a meal to make with chicken breast when I came across this recipe. After reading the reviews I decided to substitute like others did since my family loves chicken Alfredo. I didn’t have any bacon so I substituted fresh spinach. I used all the ingredients listed with bow tie pasta adding garlic powder and minced garlic. It came out great. Looking forward to using bacon next time.

I made this recipe with a substitute of Chicken patties, and Turkey Bacon. This meal was easy and quite delicious. Let’s just say there wasn’t any leftovers.

this was very easy to prepare.  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for, except I did add some greens onions that I needed to get rid of.  Thank you for a quick and easy weeknight meal.  :o)

Delicious. I used real bacon bits for this. The bacon gives it a carbonara taste that my son loves. My whole family devoured this. It's a keeper!

I've made this dish. Really can't go wrong!! I added mushrooms and chives. I cooked the bacon and chicken the night before ( hubby wasn't hungry) and put the bacon, chicken and sauce in a container to sit, after mixing it up. The following evening, the sauce had that great smokey bacon flavor before I even warmed it up. Will def prepare like that again. I call it dirty American Parmesan Alfredo chicken!

We made this as written and loved it! It received the seal of approval from our 4 and 11 year olds.  I think next time we'll add some sautéed mushrooms just because we like mushrooms. Great recipe!

I made this for dinner tonight without changing the recipe, and my family loved it! I like it having a lot of sauce, so I will probably add more next time.

This was really good. Quick and easy to put together and it went over well at our Sunday Family potluck. I added some chopped frozen spinach. And I had to use shells instead of fettuccine. I'd make this again.
