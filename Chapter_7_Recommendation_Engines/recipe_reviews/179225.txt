Not a bad cookie.  You can't really taste the apple though it's nice to know its there. I substituted whole wheat flour for half the recipe, and baked mine for exactly 8 minutes and they came out perfect and chewy in the middle.

I greatly enjoyed these cookies!  They are a unique taste - not your typical cookie.

Sticky dough that is easier to shape into balls than to drop by spoonfuls.  My teens like the Rice Krispies in the cookies! Good taste!
