Loved this recipe. Halved it as it was only for 3 of us. I omitted the cherries as I didn't have them on hand (the recipe says optional so I don't feel too bad about tweaking that part, lol.) The only thing was I felt it needed a little more pineapple for the amount of Cool Whip & pudding mix. This would be perfect for a baby shower or party. Next time I will half everything but the pineapple and see how that turns out :)

When I make this, I used one container Cool Whip, one package instant pistachio pudding and one full package mini marshmallows. It's one of my favorite holiday fluffy salads.

This is a tradition in my family for Thanksgiving since I was a little girl. My children love it and it's one of the things that they look forward to come time for dinner. The recipe I use though doesn't have cherries in it and I only use 1 box of pudding, 1/2 a container of cool whip, 1 cup of the colored mini marshmallows and a lg can of crushed pineapple with the juice.

We make this for every holiday, but have changed the maraschino cherries to 1 to 2 cans of mandarin oranges.  Yumm!!
