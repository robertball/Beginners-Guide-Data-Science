I have made this recipe several times for our cafe. When I made it the second time, I reduced the amount of butter by half. Customers liked it both ways.

This pie gets raves from everyone who tries it, but it needs to cook a little longer than 45 minutes. I use a deep dish frozen pie shell and bake at 325 for 55 minutes, then turn the oven off and leave the pie in for 10 minutes. It come out perfect!

This is my 3rd Easter making this pie and it gets rave reviews.  It does have to cook a bit longer...I just keep my eye on it.  It is yummy and I always serve it with fresh whipped cream.  Great recipe!

Flavorwise, this pie was good, though very sweet (I used chocolate chips instead of pecans though, so that was a contributing factor to the sweetness). I don't think the cooking time of 45 minutes is enough though. Mine was still quite liquid at 45 minutes. I left it in for 15 more minutes, and it seemed fairly set with the extra time, but was still a little runny when cut. I liked the edge where it had gotten chewy and firm, so for me I think it could bake even longer than an hour, until the center looks entirely set..

This pie was really good.  It cooked all the way through no problem.  I also baked the pie at 325 for 45 min. turned the oven off and left the pie in for an additional 10 min.  Along with the pecans I added a few chocolate chips and butterschotch chips!  Very good.

Soupy and inedible.  What went wrong?  I used a a frozen pie crust, defrosted but not prebaked.  Is 325 for 45 minutes enough?

This does indeed taste like a macaroon.  I made half the recipe in a 6-inch pie pan and still the baking time was insufficient.  For me, it needed longer in the oven.  The recipe is very sweet, but still very good.

Don't use any pie crust manufacturer other than Pillsbury. I used slightly more coconut and pecans.
