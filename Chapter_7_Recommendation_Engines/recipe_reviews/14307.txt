I did some research...  After cutting the dressing in half- which is sufficent- and changing the mayo to fat-free mayo and the sugar to splenda and 1 oz. of cheese- it changed the calorie intake to about 80 calories instead of 400+.  And it tastes just as good.  My 2 cents.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Took this to our golf fundraiser and it was gobbled up!  Like others, I added a little red pepper and sunflower seeds and green onions.  Eyeballed the veggies (there was a lot!), but kept the dressing the same.  It was plenty.  I only got a taste of it, but really really liked what I had.  Plus, it was a very pretty presentation in a glass salad dish.  Kind of like a 7 Layer Salad.  Oh, and I also put the dressing on over the cheese, then added the bacon and seeds afterwards to keep them crisper.

We always love this salad and I've made it many times.  Each time I get rave reviews.  I don't use the egg but I always add chopped red onion.  I've also made it with raisins and sunflower seeds added.  Every variation is delicious, just play around with the ingredients you like.  :)

I was excited to make this last night as it sounded like something we would love, but I was sort of disappointed.  I thought it was way too dressing-heavy, and that the dressing was too sweet.  If I made it again, I would up the bacon, add less sugar to the dressing, and serve the dressing on the side.

Awesome!  I used a med to lg size cauliflower, equal amount of broccoli, used 15 eggs, 
2 c. of cheese, 12 oz bacon, 3/4 c. white sugar, 3 T. white wine vinegar  and almost  2 c.
of mayo.  Drizzling the dressing didn't work for me, it just sat on the top, therefore, I stirred
it all together.   It fit perfectly into a 4.5 qt portable.  Next time, I will reserve some of the cheese
and bacon to sprinkle  on the top after the dressing has been stirred in.  I can see this
recipe becoming one of my families favorites.

I made this recipe for Easter and it was a big hit.  I thought both the taste and texture were great.  I followed the directions exactly, but only poured about 3/4 of the dressing on top of the salad.  I put the remaining dressing in a bowl next to the salad so people could add more if they wanted.

great version of this salad.  no wonder it has a 5-star rating.  I added finely chopped green peppers and green olives to counter sweet dressing.  next time I think I will reduce mayo/sugar by 1/2.

Fantastic salad. With each bite a different part of the salad comes through. Great combination of textures and flavours. This was also very easy to make and only took about 20 minutes (or maybe less). I also added the sunflower seeds and would highly recomend doing so. I will definitely make this again.

This salad got rave reviews! I recently hosted a salad bar buffet and the ladies loved this one. I doubled the bacon and added red onion. Yummy. Most went home with the recipe printed out from allrecipes.com! Thanks, Colleen

Really good! I used turkey bacon but doubled the amount, since I had a little more broccoli and cauliflower than called for.  Dressing is just right  for this.

This makes a great summer meal when you're tired of sandwiches and lettuce-based salads.  I doubled the brocolli, cauliflower, and cheese, plus used a full 12 ounce package of bacon, and 6 eggs.  I kept the dressing amount the same, however, since many reviews said it made too much.  Also used 1/4 Splenda instead of 1/2 sugar, and plain white vinegar since that's all I had.  Dressing came out perfectly and had just the right amount.  I just mixed everything together instead of layering since I didn't care about presenation, but it still looked very pretty and yummy.  Delicious low-carb meal!  My husband, who is a hamburger guy, calls this "broccoli crack" and says it is his third favorite thing to eat, ever!

I really did not like the dressing, it was way too sweet and too thick to really drizzle everywhere and too much.  The salad has possibilities, I think a basic ranch dressing would be much nicer

I made this for a picnic with my boyfriend and we both loved it! I doubled the amount of broccoli and cauliflower and used sharp cheddar cheese and it turned out wonderful. Next time I will add the extra bacon and curry powder that others suggested and see how that turns out.

Omit the eggs, add 1/2 tsp curry powder...you've got the recipe I've been using for years.  Try it with the curry powder for a change, everyone loves it, even people who say they dislike curry.

Great salad!  I omit the bacon due to a vegetarian in the family, but it is wonderful even without.  I noticed you don't usually need all the dressing.  This is always a hit at family parties and potlucks.

WOW! I made this recipe in place of my 'usual' salad one day and it quickly replaced our old favorite!  Even though I am not a 'veggie eater' I still love this.  It's easy to do and I make it for every potluck I attend, and every time I do, I'm complimented on it and asked for the recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This was DELICIOUS!  We ate this one night as a meal in itself!  Made only 1/2 the dressing as suggested by other users and it was plenty.  Substituted Splenda for sugar and used lowfat mayo and turkey bacon.  I plan to try the sunflower seeds next time (as suggested by a reviewer) and will definitely try at our next potluck.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was wonderful and immediately asked for by my luncheon attendees.  We're doing low-carb, so I substituted Splenda instead of the suger, and didn't use as much.  And, because I used Splenda, I needed to add a bit more white wine vinegar to thin the dressing up a bit more.  I did serve the dressing on the side so that everyone could add the amount that they wanted.  This recipe has become a new favorite of my family's!  Thanks so much!

This is a great recipe!  I use simple white vinegar so I don't know if that changes the taste from the original recipe and I added more bacon, eggs and I use Monterey Jack and Mild Cheddar shredded (from blocks) cheese.  Will be interesting to see how the curry powder suggested above enhances the flavor.  My husband says it's called "St. Louis Salad", not sure how accurate that is, but I have seen similar salads in the deli's around here with that name.  My family loves it and tells everyone how they have to try it!  We'll see at Christmas if the rest of the family shares the same opinon.  Thanks Colleen for helping to make me a better Homemade Chef!

I would increase the amount of bacon next time and decrease the amount of dressing.  But it was tasty.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe, even the meat and potato men.  I added more broccoli, cauliflower, and bacon than it called for.  Then before I put the dressing on, I put salt and pepper on it.  After I got the dressing on, I chopped up some green onions and put them on the top.  Taste great!!!

I want to give this recipe a 5 star but I can't. I made this for a dinner party and it didn't go over very well. It was avoided like the plague. And the only person I saw that ate this and like it was my middle child. So  tried it and realized...man it was too sweet tasting but was a sweet mayo flavor. Was not good. So the only thing I could think of that would numb the sweetness without over salting or over peppering was celery salt. It seemed to do the trick after a few shakes here and there and tasting and re-shakng some more. until it was mellowed. I'd say the veggies and bacon were fresh and light. But the dressing really didn't do them justice. Sorry. My advice, cut the sugar down or add more vinegar.

I love this salad. The first time I made this, I made as written and it was way too mayo-y too sweet and I really didn't care for the eggs. The second time, I omitted the eggs, added a little bit of red onion, I used a whole large head of broccoli, a large head of cauliflower (it was probably more like 4 cups each) 2 cups of mayo, sugar to taste, a pack of bacon, a 8oz bag of shredded cheddar and a splash of balsamic vinegar in addition to the white wine vinegar. Instead of layering, I mixed it all together. This will be staple at my house. Delish!

The dressing is way too sweet and there is too much of it for the rest of the ingredients. Cut down on the sugar (and you can use a sugar substitute), and cut down on the mayo, and the recipe is 4 stars easily.

I used half mayo/half sour cream and omitted the sugar. After trying it, I did end up throwing in a bit more bacon and adding pepper, a little basil and garlic/onion powder. This would be great to take to a family barbeque.

My boyfriends aunt makes this and I could eat the whole bowl myself!  The only difference is we leave off the egg and instead of layering the items she tosses it all together then adds the dressing.

Make sure not to put the dressing on till you're ready to serve or it will get soggy.

Yummy!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and cut the dressing in half and it was just enough!  It left the veggies crunchy - just right.  I also added sunflower seeds, red onion, and diced cheddar cheese instead of shredded for more cheese flavor.  Even my picky 6 year old loved it!

This was really good.  The sweet dressing, creamy cheese, flavorful bacon and the crispy vegetables combine very well.

Great taste.  Used 1/2 of the dressing to cut back on calories/fat and didn't need all of that.  No need for 2 cups of eggs, 3 eggs was plenty.  Added frozen peas and chopped red peppers for color,  Would do again.

Great salad recipe!!! Hubby and friends loved it.  It was even better the next day.  I did use Splenda for half of sugar and next time will probably use only Splenda to cut down on the carbs.

This was so good, and great to serve instead of rice or potatoes!  I saw from the other comments that the dressing seemed heavy and sweet, so I served it on the side.  After we finished the salad, there was still half of the dressing left over, so I would recommend cutting the dressing recipe in half.  I'm also going to try using Splenda instead of sugar, to keep the carbs down.

This was okay.  I bit bland- but I added some celery and curry powder.  It tasted like the flavors didn't meld very well.  I was a bit dissapointed and will only make if Im craving veggies w sweet dressing cheese and bacon all mixed together.  Sorry.

It was a very good recipe.  Dressing was a little heavy and sweet.  Next time will cut back on the sugar and Mayo. and switch to plain white vinegar.  I thought the salad was better after it had refrigerated overnight.

I have made this several times now and everyone loves it!  I've been asked the recipe every time.  It's so simple and so good.  We really like the dressing, but my step-mom often leaves it out and if the cheese is fresh grated and real crumbled bacon is used (we use bacon bits often), it's even good sans dressing!  Definitely lower calorie that way.  We love the dressing too much to leave it out ourselves though!  Thanks for the recipe Colleen.. it's a definite favorite!

Easy! Good!  Quick! Doubled the vegetables and cheated by mixing up a package of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing rather than making the dressing from scratch.

I make this salad often, with less sugar and used Splenda. I also use hormel real bacon bits, the whole small bag. This really cuts back on calories and carbs. Red onions work well. I will be trying the curry and raisins. Toss night before serving, toss again before serving.

I took the suggestions of others and doubled the broccoli-cauliflower and bacon, added sunflower seeds and raisins. Drizzling the drsg. over the top didn't work out for me, so next time I will mix the drsg. in with everything before the cheese and then top with cheese and bacon.  (adding some bacon in with vegetables and some on top of cheese).

Super recipe!! We just ate this and it was gone in 3 minutes. My husband liked it too, asked when we will eat it again. Normally he is not that enthousiastic about vegetables!
Changes I made: less and lowfat mayonaise, just one egg. 

Thanks for the recipe Colleen.

I must admit that I was a bit skeptical about this recipe.  It seemed like such an odd combination of ingredients.  But I had an hour to throw together a spur-of-the-moment dinner for neighbors and I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand.  So I went for it and the consensus was...YUM!  Only changes--substituted Havarti for Cheddar because it's what was in the fridge and tossed all the ingredients together rather than layering them.  Will definately make again.

This salad is excellent! I made it the night before and let the dressing marinate the veggies in the fridge all night. My guests gobbled it up! I also added extra cheese and bacon. This is definetely a keeper! Thanks Colleen!

Yummy!  The only changes made were to substitute 1/4 cup splenda for the sugar, light Kraft mayo,  and use apple-smoked bacon which we cooked in the microwave.  Will make again!

The combination of the vegetables with the cheese, bacon and the sweet and sour dressing makes this salad a favorite of my family.  We especially enjoy it with grilled chicken.

I love this salad in all of its myriad forms. I have NEVER used any sweetener in the dressing: only mayonnaise and sometimes a little balsamic vinegar. AND the veggies can be cooked slightly (very slightly parboiled) for those who cannot digest raw food well--be sure they are still crunchy.  I like adding boiled eggs and the bacon is essential. You can also add chopped onion, celery, bell pepper for extra crunch/flavor. Season with salt and pepper to taste and add some cayenne if you like it spicy. Everyone loves it, even those who say they don't like broccoli or cauliflower.

Thanks Colleen.  It was good.  I didn't use all the dressing but really it's not your fault there was "too much", it's purely preferance.  So don't blame her!  I hope everyone enjoys it.

I love this recipe. I've made it several times, sometimes as stated and sometimes with variations. One of my favorites is to use mostly cauliflower and only add the broccoli for green accent. I like to add onions as well, and today for a picnic I added one sweet red pepper, chopped fairly fine. I do cut back on the sugar using balsamic vinegar with it's sweetness, and use light mayo. Different cheese add a nice twist at times, as can finely chopped ham instead of the bacon. This is what I consider a great foundational recipe, with endless variations!

I made this only slightly different to recipe due to other people's recommendations.  I used whole cauliflower head, 3 brocolli bunches-cut both into bite size pieces.  Made for two functions so I halved each evenly and placed into 2 separate bowls.  I omited egg. I used pre-cooked bacon (to save on time), using 6 slices for each bowl of broc/caul blend. Also added 1 cup shredded cheddar to each bowl, and 1/4 cup red onion to each bowl. (i placed cheese, bacon, and mayo blend in just before serving).  Mayo blend--I used 1 cup mayo, 1 tbsp white vinegar, and 1 teaspoon lemon juice (didn't have white wine vinegar).  I then divided the amount equally and added each half into each bowl.  Just enough to coat and give flavor, but not enough to make it too mayonaisy, if that makes sense.  1st group left no leftovers and mentioned they didn't think they'd like but did.  Other group not as many tried but those that did, liked it.  I really liked it and that's why I'm giving 5 stars.  Thanks for the recipe.  I was looking for something different and will be making this in future when I have two functions to attend.  One prep time, two functions--couldn't be any better!

Quick and easy to put together. I made 2 days in a row for different functions. First day made as written. Excellent. Second day added green onions and sunflower seeds.  Mixed dressing in with broccoli cauliflower layer, layered eggs, cheese, bacon and drizzled small amount of dressing on top. My BFF went to both parties and second day was better due to dressing mixed in (said 1ST day she only got small amt in serving and second day it was more coated. Otherwise was good both ways.Easily alters to suit tastes which make this recipe tops in my rotation.

A very good salad!  I leave out the eggs and put in 1/4 cup sunflower seeds instead.  Never any leftovers.

This is a wonderful salad for anytime although it was especially nice on a hot summer day. No cooking needed since I usually have some boiled eggs on hand for snacks.
I did add some onions and "Mrs. Dash" Tomato/basil seasoning. I made my favorite 3 bean salad with this and had the perfect meal. The family loved it.

This was by far the best I've tried. I did add one small 6 oz box of raisins and it made it extra special.  I had this once at a Gourmet Deli and thought it couldn't hurt.  I was right! I also used the pre-cooked bacon and it cooked it perfectly in 30second!Thanks!

This was GREAT! I was a little iffy about the recipe at first, but it turned out delicious.  Both the boyfriend and I gobbled it all up in two meals time!  I didn't have any fresh broccoli or cauliflower, and since I am not crazy about uncooked broccoli/cauliflower, I used frozen and cooked it in the microwave for just a little while.  I allowed the veggies to cool, and then layered them as per the instructions.  I also added some onion since I happened to have some, and some sunflower seeds as other users suggested.  I didn't have any White wine vinegar, so I used Red wine vineger and splend in the dressing, and it tasted fine to me.  We've since purchased the white wine vinegar, so next time I'll try it with that.  Great recipe. Thanks!!

Surprisingly great recipe.  I modified the dressing using low fat Mayo and 1/4 cup of splenda instead of the sugar.  I also added red onions, and used turkey bacon.  The amount of dressing was too much, so next time I will use 1/2 of these amounts.

I really love this salad.  Not only is it yummy, but it's a great way to get in a couple veggies and it's something a little different than the same old boring salad.  To make it even easier, I used Oscar Mayer pre-cooked and diced real bacon pieces.  (In the same area as bacon bits but way better.)  Delish!

I just loved this salad, it has become one of my favorites, although I did not use as much egg as called for.  I only used about 1/2-3/4 cup. 
 It's as pretty in a glass bowl as it is good.  The bacon really gave it a lot of flavor. I have made it on may occasions. Thanks for sharing.

We love this recipe with a few changes to our taste. I use an entire head of broccoli and cauliflower and maybe a bit less mayo adding shelled sunflower seeds and dried cranberries.  Sometimes I add shredded cheddar but I love it without so why add the calories.

I love this recipe. I used half a head of purple cauliflower along with white and broccoli and it make the presentation that much better. I served it to my family and friends and both couldn't believe how good it was and asked for the recipe. It is a perfect way to use the cauliflower that is in my fridge.

YUM! The taste deserves 5 stars, but I think the need for tweaking requires a star drop. I followed reviewer advice and cut mayo and sugar in half (though kept vinegar as written), which made it perfect. I also omitted eggs and added raisins and green onions. We gobbled it up!!

Wanted something different than the same old steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  This salad was excellent.  We had it Christmas dinner and we all enjoyed it.  I made it a little healthier by using light mayo and splenda.  A delicious alternative to the traditional holiday fare.

A version of this salad has floated around my family for a while.  Usually we omit the eggs and cheese and add black olives, raisins and carrots.  Sometimes sunflower seeds too.  It's definitely a crowd pleaser!

Great simple recipe.  I took it to a potluck.  I used pre-packaged real bacon bits and it still tasted great.  This would be good with lettuce in the bottom too!

Great recipe but must be modified.  I doubled or tripled the amount of broccoli and cauliflower.  Added 4 eggs, 12 slices bacon, and only added 1/3c sugar, left out the cheese only because of a lactose intolerant person. Everything else was the same.  I stired everything together, instead of putting the dressing on top. Made it for fathers day and it was gone. Will absolutly make it again with the modifications.

I have always liked Broccoli-Cauliflower salad when I attended fellowship meals and such, but I never took the time to find a recipe.  A few weeks ago I decided to look and I found this one.  It is delicious.  My family loves it and it is so easy to make.  I substituted lemon juice for the vinegar because I had no way of getting any white wine vinegar in our small rural town.  I also prefer to mix everything together instead of layering it.  And this second time around I doubled the veges, cheese and bacon but left the amounts of dressing ingredients the same.  The recipe was much better with less dressing (and I had wasted some last time). I also leave out the optional eggs.  Mainly because I have never ever had a broccoli-cauliflower salad with eggs and it didn't sound appetizing.   I still give this 5 stars though.

Double the veggies, don't use the egg, bacon bits work great, use ultra fine sugar if making last minute

This was very good, just too much dressing and too much sugar. Next time I am going to lessen both. I didn't have bacon so I added about 2/3 cup or more real bacon bits. I also used white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. I mixed all of the ingredients together instead of layering and chilled it for a bit before serving.

This recipe is WONDERFUL! I have never had anything else like it. I leave out the egg and it tastes great without it. You absolutely must use mayonnaise and not 'salad dressing' or the sauce will not taste right.

Okay, I made this recipe thinking it would be a hit b/c it has everything my family likes.  I was wrong and nobody really liked it except me..... However, I absolutely loved it!  My husband and mother said it was to sweet.  Not for me though, it had flavors that just absolutely knocked my socks off. The dressing (sweet and zingy) and the veggies were fantastic together.  I'm giving this 5 stars b/c it floated my boat, lol!

I followed the directions of another reviewer to make it less fatty.  I used two small heads of cauliflower, one large head of broccoli, two cups of fat free mayo, turkey bacon, and splenda (no eggs either).  It was really, really great!  I typically don't like ff mayo, but it was on sale, so I went with it--I couldn't tell the difference.  Very, very good!!

This was very easy. I served it with Christmas dinner, so left out the eggs, which would have been too much. A good make ahead salad, adding the dressing at serving time.

YUMMY!!!  Everyone loved this salad!  I agree that next time I would cut back the sugar.  I will probably start with 1/4c and add more if needed.  This time, since I had already added the whole 1/2c, I just added about another T. of vinegar.  I didn't add the eggs because I don't care for them.

Everybody loves this recipe! It is just as good stirred together as layered. I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and occassionally use some chopped red onion. This is one you can play with.

Loved this recipe and its easy too.  I did not use the eggs because someone in my family is allergic to them, so I just added more of the broccoli and cauliflower.  One warning though it does get a bit runny on the second day, but it is still good.

This was excellent! I took this to our ladies salad supper at church and it went fast. I did double the recipe and used a 9 x 13 dish to put it in. I also added some red onion as some of the other reviews had suggested. I will be making this again. Thank you for sharing.

loved this salad.  We doubled everything except the eggs and it worked out great.  Altho, we did feel that we could have cut back on the dressing as it was a little too much.

My kids wouldn't touch this. They didn't like the tast of the dressing and neither did I or my husband. It had way too much dressing for the little bit of vegetables it called for.
It just wasn't for us!

This has been one of my favorite recipes for years.  The only thing I do different is adding a cup or so of (still frozen) peas.  My kids prefer it without the eggs, but either way it's great!

I've tried this, only I added green onions, sometimes grapes and other times raisins and cashews. I make the dressing a little different, but it's delicious either way. I use one cup of mayo, a half can of sweetened condensed milk, 1/4 c sugar and 1/8 of a cup of vinegar. This dressing recipe is actually cut in half, so you could double it.

One of the things I love about this site is the reviews by home cooks. I took their advice and cut the amount of dressing by half and lessened the sweetness considerably, using a stevia-erythritol substitute. So glad I did. I decided not to measure the eggs, just adding two to the overall mix. I also subbed white vinegar for the white wine vinegar. Such an easy, delicious salad.

This was very good.  I did decrease the sugar by a lot, a 1/2 cup seemed like too much for 1 cup of mayo.  I only used 2 T of sugar and it was more than enough.  I also used about 3 cups each of the broccoli/cauliflower.  I also kept the dressing on the side and drizzled it over each salad before serving. I also added sunflower seeds (as others stated in their reviews) and it was so good.  I will make this again for sure.

Sorry to say but this recipe didn't cut it with me despite all the rave reviews. I was surprised to find that the recipe didn't require the broccoli or cauliflower to be cooked at least a little bit, I mean seriously who eats these vegetables raw? Anyway I ended up steaming in some water for a few minutes until they were slightly cooked though still retaining the crunch thus making it edible. Now for the sauce... it was bad sorry! After reading the reviews, we halved the amount and used low fat Mayo BUT it was still SO SUPER SWEET and ended up STILL BEING WAY TO MUCH!!! I ended up adding some wholegrain honey mustard and it was much better. We let each person help themselves to the sauce and at the end there is still heaps left over. The taste of this combination overall was a bit strange as well - my tastebuds were looking for potatoes as this would've been good with some potatos yet there weren't any... Sorry but won't be making this one again.

Let me start by saying I HATE cauliflower but made this because my husband bought some and I didn't want it to go bad in the fridge.    This was honestly the best recipe using cauliflower I have ever eaten!    I will definitely make (and eat) this again and again!

Thanks, Colleen, for this great recipe. I also made a few tweeks: I used less egg, subbed Splenda for the sugar, added some diced red pepper for color and some chopped red onion. And, I mixed it all together. We loved it, and I'm sure I will make it again and again.

Whole head of cauliflower, 3 small bunches of broccoli, double the dressing, and a lb of good quality thick bacon. Peppered bacon is nice. Use your kitchen shears to cut the bacon. I have never added or seen anyone add eggs to their salad. I do not like a lot of cheese so I barely add 1 cup to the whole thing. I always add 1/2 a med diced red onion. It's a must.

This was superb. I made this yesterday for a small shindig and I was glad that I had enough left for a small container of leftovers for me. I bought one of those mixed broccoli/cauliflower bags and just used that. I omitted the eggs (not by choice, I ran out of time to make a few), and after reading a few reviews, I too cut the mayo/sugar/vinegar in half, and it was MORE than sufficient. This flavor is exactly like what you can get in the grocery stores. Next time I make this, and I will make it again soon, I'm going to add the egg, some peas, and shredded carrot. This is how I use to get it at a grocery store in WI and it was just divine. I'm also going to up the bacon. LOVE this recipe.

My hubby, who is not a fan of broccoli or cauliflower, loved this salad.  The only changes I made was to use Splenda instead of sugar, and real bacon bits instead of bacon...just to save some time and mess.  Very yummy, a definite keeper!

Nice refreshing salad.  I used a generous cup of broccoli and Cauliflower, cut the dressing in half, using only a scant 1/4 C sugar and added 1/4 C sunflower seeds.  4 eggs as about 2 cups, and I mixed the dressing with the veggies before putting the rest on top of the cheese.  Ended up adding some raisins after tasting.  Could easily have used some more B&C with this amount of dressing.  Family liked it, will make again.

Yum... looked pretty and taste terrific even though I had subbed peas for the broccoli because it's what I had on hand; I also added a dash of worcershire sauce to the mayo and a few T of parmesan cheese then spread it over the cauliflower layer before the cheese and bacon for presentaton and since only the vegetables needed dressing.. Thanks for this recipe! :)

I made this salad for a family get together for the Holidays, and it didn't last long.. They loved it so much they all asked to the recipe. A change from the regular salads we use to have. I just didn't use that much sugar. About 3 tablespoons is all I used. It was a winner in my book. Will fix this one from now on..

I think this is my husband favorite dish that I have ever made!! I use 1/3 of a cup of mayo and 1 1/2 Tbs. sugar and the same amount of vinegar. I also add half of whatever color of bell pepper I have on hand, 3 chopped green onoins and a cup of peas. oh yeah, lots of fresh ground pepper too. Thanks for the great recipe!

I never have any leftovers of this salad!  I only vary the ingredients a little - I don't add the eggs, but I do add raisins and roasted/salted sunflower seeds to give it a little more crunch.

Great salad! Our family doesn't like cooked broccoli, but we love it raw - so this was perfect for us! I did add the sliced green onions as another reviewer suggested. I LOVE the dressing, but have to admit that there was a lot of it! Absolutely will be making again!

VERY easy and delicious!  If you don't want the dressing to be too sweet (although I didn't find it too sweet) add sugar by 1/8 C. increments until desired sweetness is reached.  I doubled the bacon, and you could also mix all ingredients instead of layering, and add the dressing instead of keeping separate.  Delicious both ways, will make again and again!

This was a big hit when I took it to the in-laws for supper.  I did not add the hot sauce because a lot of the family has stomach problems and it was soooo good.  I have already been asked to make this for Thanksgiving.  I went ahead and mixed it all together and doubled the vegies and used about 3/4 of the sauce.  I think I will cut the sugar in 1/2 next time too.  Great dish fast and yummy.

Love this, easy to make.  Eggs could take or leave though.  I used white vinegar in place of white wine vinegar and was still very good.

Husband loved it.......but the dressing's heavy and makes a lot. So, if you're not using fat free mayo (like me) you will eat with a lot of guilt;). Great recipe though. Thank you.

We really enjoyed this pretty salad! I used extra bacon and only 2 eggs because that was all I had. The dressing was sweet, and I even took others advice and cut the sugar in half. I also added some yellow mustard to it to give it some twang.

We all liked this a lot.  I will make only 1/2 the dressing next time and use less sugar.  Maybe we'll also add more broccoli and cauliflower.  The sunflower seeds sound good too!

Best Broccoli Salad Ever!!  The dressing is to die for!  Firstly, I was so happy to find a Broccoli Salad recipe that doesn't have onions in it because I am not a fan.  I always double the broccoli and cauliflower which makes the amount of dressing perfect.  Do not skip the eggs if you can help it.  Definitely add sunflower seeds as other reviewers suggest, it adds a great crunch.  And lastly, make sure you wait to add the dressing, topped with bacon and sunflower seeds, right before serving.  SO GOOD!

Similar to broccoli salad, I’ve never made it with cauliflower and eggs turned out good but prefer the style without the eggs and with grapes, craisins, and red onion. Oh! And instead of white vinegar I used red wine vinegar for a little more flavor.

This was delicious! I made this as a one-bowl lunch for myself and just mixed everything together. I can see the layering, as the instructions state, if you're looking for a nice presentation to serve to a crowd. I scaled this down to 4 servings (1/2 cup each of the veggies). I cut the dressing back again, because I couldn't see using 1/2 cup mayo just for a bowl for myself. The dressing worked very well with all of the ingredients. I also just used one hard-boiled egg. Topped with salt and pepper for a delicious and healthy lunch! Nice recipe!

I've made this twice. the first time I stuck to the recipe.  the second time, I blanched the veggies for 1 minute then cooled. I reduced the sugar by 1/2 , used rice wine vinegar, and added diced red onion. The kids loved it but said, "less sugar next time! " Third time's a charm!

I followed the recipe, but couldn't find white wine vinegar, so to reduce acidity and strength, used 1 tablespoon of water and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar.  Everyone liked the salad and asked for the recipe.  I did stir just prior to serving.  I thought the amount of dressing could be reduced a little, but everyone else thought it was great as it was made.

My mother used to make this when I was a kid and we loved it. I could not remember the recipe, so I found this, it is pretty close. Although after making this version, it is too sweet and has too much dressing. I did 1 1/2 cups of each broccoli and cauliflower 1 cup fat free mayo, 2 tbls water, 2 hard boiled eggs 1/2 cup shredded cheese, 1/4 cup sugar, 6 slices chopped bacon, and to add a little kick I also finely chop 1/4 cup red onion.  I just mix everything together. 
The red onion just adds something special! My 7 yr old twins HATE onion but LOVED this, in fact it turns out they wanted seconds and begged me to make it again!

Unfortunately, I didn't have bacon, so I went out on a limb and subbed pepperoni. Still very delicious. (Used only 2 tbs of sugar.)

I had something like this but not with large pieces and layered.  I chopped the broccoli and cauliflower into pieces the size of a pea.  I added finely shredded carrot (1 medium), white raisins and sunflower seeds.  I skipped the bacon and egg to make if vegetarian.  It made about 2 quarts.  It is also better the second day after the mixture has marinated.  
This also adds crunch and makes a great replacement for coleslaw on sandwiches with ham or turkey.

I know I used more broccoli and cauliflower than the recipe called for, but it was definitely delicious.
Edited to add: I didn't have any bacon tonight, but it was still pretty good.

I made half the dressing and also reduced the sugar to 3 tablespoons.  It came out very tasty.  The next time I made it I jazzed it up a bit with 1/4 chopped red onion, 1/3 cup craisins, 1/3 cup pumpkin seeds.  It came out excellent!

We love this salad.  I've made it twice now, the second time adding two sliced green onions.  Only half the dressing is needed, I'll cut that in half next time.

Tasty and quick.  I chopped up the veggies and did not layer them. Having used up all my mayonnaise on a chicken salad, I used a bottle of Caesar dressing. It was wonderful!  Hubby doesn't like to taste any kind of tartness, so I just put a healthy sprinkle of red wine vinegar and a little tiny bit more sugar so he wouldn't be unhappy.  He wasn't.  This is one of those recipes I will be using again at family get togethers. I had tripled it except for the vinegar.

This is best using the dressing recipe from the "Bodacious Broccoli Salad" recipe. And it's just as good with pre-cooked bacon.

Without actually trying this recipe I will rate it only because I love broccoli and cauliflower.  I will be using this recipe soon.  The reviews were very helpful.

Loved it!  I used a ton of veggies (entire head of cauliflower and almost as much broccoli).  I made a double batch of the sauce, but didn't use it all.  My husband thought there was too much sauce, but I thought it was great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Nice recipe. I used 2 heads of cauliflower and 2 bunches of broccoli, instead of cooking bacon, I used a package of REAL bacon bits, and topped with sunflower seeds. I also added some chopped green onions. Put all of this in a 13x9 baking dish. The only complaint I recieved was that there was not enough dressing.

This is a five star winner.  I changed the sugar to granulated splenda, the mayo to low-fat and only used 3/4 as much mayo.  Also added a mixture of red/green onion as a layer, chopped celery, as well as sunflower seed kernels.  I made this for church potlucks as well as family gatherings.  For this reason, I serve the dressing on the side to accommodate all preferences.  INCREDIBLY GOOD!

My mom made this at Christmas dinner as a last ditch effort to get us to eat vegetables because  nobody ever eats any vegetables with all the other good food around. We gobbled it up! It was wonderful. She did leave the boiled eggs out because she didn't think it sounded good. I am adding this to my recipe box and will be making it often.

A hit at dinner!  Everyone loved it :-)  My husband thinks I should make it more often. A refreshing salad with lots of crunch.  I used plain vinegar, and added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice.

This is a great salad! 7 Layer Salad is my favorite but this is a close second. The only problem was the dressing; there was too much. I increased the veggies to 2 cups each and added red and yellow bell pepper and red onion. Then, I put an Italian spin on it by using 2c Italian cheeses, adding minced sundried tomatoes to the dressing and garnishing with fresh basil. Delicioso!

I made this for a mini family reunion and everyone raved about it!  Even as my aunts and uncles were leaving they commented on how good it was. And, my 9 yr old son said this "is the best ever!"  The only change I'll make next time is to cut the dressing amount a bit, because I didn't use it all the first time. I only used 4 large eggs and thought they were plenty.  Thank you Colleen for a great recipe.

I made this salad for a BBQ I hosted the other day, exactly as listed until the dressing. It was much too sweet so I added a tbsp of balsamic vinegar at the end and it was terrific. I happened to really like the salad but it didn't get rave reviews from my guests so I am not sure that I would make it again for a party...maybe just for me!

I really like the concept of this recipie, but I felt it was a little too heavy feeling after following the directions, leaving out the optional eggs.  I've made it since, and altered it to make it lighter, using 1/2 fat free sour cream and 1/2 cup light mayo, ando 1/3 cup splenda.  Much better, though my husband still doesn't like it, it's a favorite of mine.

I tried these for Easter and my family all raved about it. I have made it several times since and there are never any leftovers!!Easy and very flavorful. I use nothing but Hellmans Mayo and hickory smoked bacon. I did add a layer of sweet onions this last time. Very good.

I made this recently.  Since I am on Weight Watchers I did modify it some.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and grilled chicken instead of the bacon.  I didn't have any hard boiled eggs or time to make them so they got left off.  I think next time I will lessen the amount of Splenda as it was quite sweet in my opinion.

My hubby and I LOVE this salad!!! I didn't have white wine vinegar the first time I made it, so I used red wine vinegar instead and it was wonderful!!!! Gave it a nice little kick. I've made this about 10 times and it's just amazing! Thanks for sharing!

This is one version of an old standby for me.I always bring home an empty dish when I take thi to a potluck.  I tend to use all broccoli instead of cauliflower, but it's great either way.  I have never added the eggs due to picky eaters at my house.  I've also added raisins or dried cranberries and sunflower seeds with good results.  All in all, this is a versatile recipe that is a real crowd-pleaser.
