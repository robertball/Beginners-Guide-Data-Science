It was delicious.  I will use this again, but will need to cut back on the spices.  I used it on a slab of ribs and on a pork shoulder then smoked it in my Orion smoker.  the entire family LOVED it, but did comment on the amount of spice.

Okay, I really doubted this would turn out tasty due to the amount of sugars. It was absolutely great, and I've been looking for a really good bbq meat flavor for a long time. Accidentally left them in the fridge for two days, so rinsed them off before cooking  the rib tips for 2 hrs at 250 in my toaster oven, tightly wrapped in foil. The only way it could have been better, I'm sure, is if I had SMOKED paprika, as the recipe asks. I added some Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar bbq sauce at the last minute, and that just enhanced the flavor, but the rib tips were absolutely great with just the rub.

I have used this rub several times. Very good rub but in mine and my wife’s opinion it need more pop. I added more cayenne and now we use it on all our ribs and Boston Butts. Don’t know how some of these reviews say to much heat...

Lately I’ve been doing lots of ribs and trying different recipes. And this one was probably one of our least favorites after it cooks. The rub taste awesome before you cook them. But after you cook them there just isn’t much there. Think that has to do with the amount of sugar in this recipe so it either burns or just melts off. Find a recipe with a bit more salt and a little less sugar is what I’m finding out.
Maybe it turned out like this because I used an electric smoker and just put it on the rack. I just couldn’t give up that smoke flavor to do it like it said on here and I’m more of a dry rib guy.

A well balanced sweet heat rub. Maybe a bit to much sugar as it blackened the ribs a bit more than I prefer. Will use again, but with some modifications.

Put it on ribs for the family.  Great stuff.  Only will reduce cayenne pepper by half.  Left a little to much bite for the wife and kids.  Great mixture.

We smoked a slab of baby back ribs using this rub and it was fantastic.  The only minor change i made was that I only used a half tablespoon of the cayenne pepper because I was concerned it might be a bit too spicy.   I think next time I will go ahead and use the entire amount because it wasn't overwhelming.   I also followed the poster's suggestion of smoking then wrapping the ribs in foil with butter and honey and was extremely impressed by how good they were.  Great recipe; loved it!!
Thanks for sharing:)

We loved this rub!  Followed the recipe precisely and then the recipe notes in regard to wrapping and refrigerating overnight.  We slow smoked the ribs and then applied some homemade Bourbon BBQ sauce.  Fantastic!  Drove the neighbors crazy ALL DAY with the wonderful aroma! (insert evil grin here) Will be using this recipe often.

Outstanding rub! BBQ sauce is Literally running through my veins! Rubs go hand and hand with pork ribs and this delivers the good stuff. Thank You Smokinmeats:0 Love it!
