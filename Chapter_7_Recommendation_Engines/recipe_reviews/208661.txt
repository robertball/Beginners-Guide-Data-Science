I made this for an appetizer tonight with our meal.  It was so tasty.  I thought the corncakes were going to be a bit crisper, but they were very moist and delicious.  When eating it's important to get that 'perfect' bite of salmon, cake and avocado.  I only had to use one avocado and every thing else stayed the same for ingredients.    I kept all the ingredients pretty much the same with the addition of a bit more milk in mixing the corn in step one.    Oh i had thought about adding in some sugar since that's how I take my cornbread usually, but I'm glad  I didn't.  Recipe is perfect as is!  Thanks!

Wow, these were delicious! I served them with a variety of toppings, and they were a huge hit! I found two minutes per side was perfect.

I enjoyed this, but I think that it could be improved on. Next time I think having another texture would be great - some finely chopped red onions or shallots would really set it off I think, and perhaps some rough ground pepper on top.

This sounded so strange I had to give it a try. It was delicious! I cut down on the salt, but otherwise kept everything the same. It ended up being way quicker and easier then I orginally thought. Next time I might leave out the jalapeno... I thought it distracted from the taste of the corn and salmon a bit, but I did like it.

I cooked only the pancakes and served them with sourcream. Everyone loved them and I will definitely cook them again, especially because they are fast and easy to prepare.

I loved these!  The corn cakes were made the night before and kept OK in the fridge for easy assembly when needed the next day.

absolutely delicious and easier than it looks!  I May have blended the corn mix too long initially so my mix actually needed a little corn meal or flour to get it to the right consistency, I certainly didn't need to add milk.  It was one of my allrecipe favorites!

5 stars because my husband LOVED this.  I didn't have smoked salmon, but just pan fried some salmon with lemon juice and pepper (i'd bet it's even better with smoked salmon).  the corn cakes are super easy and fun to make--like little pancakes--and the avocado spread is simple, with room to personalize.

I was making salmon for dinner and was looking for a side dish.  I came upon this recipe and it was delicious!  I made the avocado spread with only one avocado because that's all I had on hand.  The spread was fine with one one, but next time I'll reduce the amount of salt.  We grilled salmon with a chile rub and used the avocado and corncakes as a side.  It was perfect.  We're looking forward to using this as an appetizer!

I just made this recipe (as a trial run) for a Tapas dinner party we are going to this weekend.  It is a very tasty recipe!  I only used 1/2 of the Jalapeno but should have used the whole thing!  I think cutting the salt in the Avocado spread (by the tiniest amount) might be better but my Avocados were on the small side so it may be perfect as written!  2 of us ate 80% of them as our entire meal!  Had just planned to eat them as a sample but they were so YUMMY!! I only used 4 ounces of smoked Salmon (it was one package) Thanks for this recipe!  I joined just so I could leave my review!
