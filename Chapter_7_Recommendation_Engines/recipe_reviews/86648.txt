Easy to follow and turned out great. I used all purpose flour since I didn't have wheat on hand.

I halved the recipe but it seemed like there was way too much of the sugar/salt/flour mixture for the amount of potatoes. Also I used german butter potatoes and they cook faster. This isn't the fault of the recipe's but I'm glad I checked on them because they were burning halfway through the broiling. They probably would have been good just after the 40 minutes at 350. Before they started to burn they smelled really really good and actually they weren't too bad as they turned out. I'm sure I will make them again and hopefully this time I'll be better able to taste the sugar. However I will reduce the amount of mixture I shake the potatoes around in.

I just made these for dinner and we all loved them. I didn't use any oil though or stir them either. I lined the baking sheet with foil. I'll try some of the other ideas about adding other seasonings too. This can be varied in many ways to nicely complement the main course.

I found these alittle bland and was disapointed. We did have a BBQ sauce that was being served that evening with supper and spooning that over the top of the potatos helps to jazz them up alittle. Also-I cut the recipe in half and had way too much flour mix.

I am giving this 2 stars only because my little guy gobbled them up... however the rest of the family did not like these potatoes at all. They were dry and the flavor was missing something. I will not make these again.

Wow I wasn't sure what to expect but these were incredible! (I even just used white flour - I bet with the whole wheat the texture and taste would be perfect.)

The previous reviews are right about reducing the sugar mixture but overall it had a wonderful flavor. We added a little parmesan cheese afterwards and we both loved it.

My family liked this recipe it was a great change of taste from regular oven fried potatoes. I added garlic and onion powders to the dry mix and had to use more oil for baking them then the regular amount. I also used less mix but overall this was a hit.

The recipe was ok. Of the 5 poeple in my family two of the boys loved it one did not care of it and the adults both thought it was so so.

I did 2 russet potatoes and 1 sweet potato. My husband and I both agreed that if it were all sweet potatoes it would be 5 stars. The russet potatoes just lacked seasoning; maybe rosemary garlic and onion would make it pop.

This was simple to make but I didn't like it at all. It lacked something I'm not sure what.
