I really hate giving recipes bad reviews but ...It has more of a cookie texture and is a bit dry. When making the batter it reminded me of cookie batter and I had to pat it into the pan evenly... it did not pour and spread. For the chocolate flavor you do need to add a bit more cocoa powder as suggested also.This was not a hit for my family.

I should have known that there was too much flour when it was more like a cookie dough --- it definitely didn't 'pour' into the pan.  And I only cooked it for 22 minutes.  Dry, dry, dry!

I did not read the reviews prior to starting this recipe.  I added everything together except for the flour (I began adding the dry ingredients one-by-one after creaming butters, sugars, etc).  I used 1/2 cup of Hershey's cocoa and noticed how thick the mixture already was and then read the reviews.  So I modified the recipe by adding only 1 cup of flower AND 1 container of vanilla Greek yogurt.   I baked as instructed and they were delicious.

this recipe was just not a hit at my house. I'm not sure that these can even be called brownies.

This turned out delicious! Although I ended up with peanut butter crumble instead of brownies or cookies or bars, which is what I was aiming for.  My modifications included all natural peanut butter, which is more oily than skippy or jif, and I halved the flour, so either of those could account for my result. I also substituted coconut oil and nesquik, but I think those made it more delicious and I don't think it caused the crumble problem. Because it tastes so good, I will try it again, hopefully with more cohesive results. Yum!

as a brownie recipe, this is terrible. the batter is too thick and dry, its like cookie dough (as a previous reviewer has written). I saw this recipe and made it while tired and didn't read the reviews first. so when life gives you cookie dough, make cookies. this makes awesome cookies, they were a hit at the party I took them to. brownies-1 star. cookies-4 stars.

Really good brownies.  The peanut butter flavor is more subtle than you would expect.  For people who are worried about these being dry, just throw some ice cream on top!
