This recipe is so fast to make and unbelievably tasty!  The flavor was so fresh from the arugula, basil, & lemon.   Instead of putting the arugula & basil in the pan, I just threw it in a big bowl and added the hot pasta mixture on top along with the almonds and parmesan.  The heat from the pasta wilted the arugula perfectly and left it with a slight bite.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will be making this again.

Barilla GF penne is one of the best GF pastas out there.  Note...this pasta is good when freshly made and eaten...not so much as a reheated meal.  This penne from Barilla is also better than the other Barilla GF pasta offerings...don't know why?    Nice recipe and quick.  I also agree to add the ingredients into the hot pasta making a fresher brighter taste.

I dry-toasted my almonds. This wasn't bad, it just wasn't memorable. The gluten-free pasta was tastier than I expected, not exactly exactly interchangeable with wheat pasta but not so different as to occasion comment, I think. If you don't mind the saturated fat from butter, changing out the olive oil for butter would improve the recipe tremendously. Thanks for sharing!

I made it with a little deviation; added broccoli to the skillet with the garlic, and then a tiny little bit of apple cider vinegar to get that tangy taste out. Kinda new to cooking and I am learning lol. Great recipe.

I added hot pepper seeds.  I also sautéed my almonds in butter and garlic salt.  I would like to add more almonds next time as they were a great flavor, just not enough of them. My husband gave this an ok, which is nice as usually he doesn't like anything.

This was delicious. I made it with edamame pasta as that is what I had. While browning the almonds, I added the garlic. I combined the olive oil, lemon juice and basil, along with some red pepper flakes, and added that mixture to the cooked pasta, along with the almond/sautéed garlic mixture,  fresh arugula sliced into pieces, the cheese and some left over shredded herbed chicken. It came out perfectly and I'll definitely make it again!
