I changed this recipe to make it more asian-like. Omitted the Italian seasoning, kept the garlic, and added ground ginger and soy sauce to taste. Used only about 1/4 cup or so broth, and added some corn starch to thicken a little. Served over soba noodles.

This was delicious! It was my first time trying shiitake mushrooms, and now I'm certainly hooked.

A pretty good recipe.    It's a nice, light sidedish with a mild flavor.  Goes well with fish.

My husband  and I both liked this.
I did use the suggestion to turn it into an Asian dish by using g ginger  and  liquid  Aminos (a soy sauce substitute)

Just great and easy. It took about 20 minutes or so and my parents loved how it tasted, specially when topping some fresh toast.

Wonderful!  (and I don't care all that much for mushrooms)
Used less liquid, and just 2 lg garlic cloves.
We savored every bite.

Loooks great! I add sausage and corn starch to thick it. I also substitute olive oil (since in here olive oil so pricey) with 2 tablespoon of butter. The taste also nice! Thanks for easy recipe!

It was just average.  Wish I would have used the mushrooms in a soup.  Agreed with another reviewer about it being more as a side to top off a steak.

Delightful. Chose this recipe to showcase homegrown shitake mushrooms. It was a great way to feature them without losing their punch in a mixed dish.
