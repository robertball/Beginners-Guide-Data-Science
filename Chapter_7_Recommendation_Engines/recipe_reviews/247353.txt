Turned out way better keeping on wire rack while in oven. Took way less time and actually thoroughly derided. Love this recipe

This was good but it lacked something to me. It needs more heat to cut the fishiness of salmon but that is just my opinion. Good recipe but I would add some red chile flakes next time. Maybe even replace the rock salt with garlic salt? Good but I think with some tweaks it could be even better. Still a fun recipe and one I will make again!
