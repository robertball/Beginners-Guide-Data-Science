I served this as the binder for a macaroni salad, and my DD said, "We should call this Macaroni and Cheese Salad!"  It is very tasty!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is definately going into my regular rotation of home made dressings. The only change I made was to use a  tablespoon of minced fresh basil. I grow a lot of that during the summer. I make a gelatin salad frequently using applesauce so this recipe will help me use up the jar before it molds in the refrigerator. Thanks for this one.

I cook in a small county jail. I like to try different things on the inmates and the inmates thought this dressing was the BOMB!

I really tried this out of curiosity as the ingredients are so different than for other salad dressings.  Wow!  What a surprise!  This dressing is fantastic even before letting it set!  I love the hints of sweetness from the applesauce and cinnamon, and the savory from the cumin and crushed peppers.  So different, yet so good!  I only made enough for 4 servings and once it blends I'll be ready for my lunch salad.  I think toasted walnuts will go well with my basic green salad and this salad dressing.  Thanks!
