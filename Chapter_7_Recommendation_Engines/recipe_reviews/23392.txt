I needed a icing recipe for a cake that I made from this site. I made the Dark Chocolate Cake 1. I wanted to use a chocolate ganache but I didn't have any heavy cream and I didn't want to drive to the store. This is what I did. I made the icing just as directed but I used the special dark cocoa. That was a great choice. As soon as it came off the stove I stired it just a little with a wire wisk and poured it on top of my cooled cake. It sat up so beautiful with a shine like you wouldn't believe. This was almost too easy to make and I will use it from now on instead of a ganache!!!

This was a very good creamy frosting. I noticed my frosting was becoming very hard as per the other reveiws so I beat in some milk a tablespoon at a time till it was the right consistancy

This is excellent!  I was looking for an icing recipe that didn't call for confectioners sugar, (corn allergy) and this worked out great.  I followed ROSEMC91's suggestion on not beating, cooling a few minutes, and pouring over cake.  I halved the recipe and used on top of Wacky Cake VIII.  I even used Rice Milk instead of regular milk, and this turned out BEAUTIFULLY!  Love this....it's a keeper!

I made this before my cake came out of the oven and by the time my cake was ready, the icing had set up to a fudge consistency.  I put it on top of the hot cake to see if it would melt and it didn't.  So I scooped it up and microwaved it until it bubbled and then spread it quickly on my cake.  It set up to a great fudge topping.  It tasted excellent on my devils food cake.  I would recommend cooking it once the cake is out and ready and then pouring it over the cake before it gets to thick.

Instead of using as a frosting, I punched holes in a sheet cake and poured over while it was stille hot. I also punched holes so chocolate could seep through. I recommend doubling recipe for this. Makes a wonderful cake!!

Gooey and delicious.  I don't think I would attempt to spread this frosting on a cake as it's very sticky and thick...but it was perfect poured, warm over a cake.  It sets up nice once it cools.

After I beat this icing for 3 minutes, I noticed it was thickening a lot as it cooled..it even slowed my electric mixer down.  As soon as it hit the cake it hardened like a rock, and was completely unspreadable.  I tried broiling it to warm it to spreading consistency, and of course it burned and I had to scrape every bit of it off. I ended up heating some blueberry jam (the only thing I could find, as I had used the last of my sugar up in this icing) and spread that on top of my scarred cake as a glaze.  
Perhaps if more milk was added next time?
Not sure I want to risk the loss of another cup of sugar.

LOVE this icing. But one thing is wrong here. In the directions, it should not tell you you can spread it cuz you can't. You pour it over the cake, and it seaps down over it and sets up kinda hard and shines just like the picture. It's amazing, and I use it often, but do not expect to spread it.

when making this icing you don't just dump everything into the pot. You melt the butter first over medium low heat then add the cocoa. Then the milk, vanilla, and sugar. Turn the heat up to medium and stir constantly. When it begins to bubble around the edges turn the heat off and keep stirring for 1 minute. Then beat the icing until it just starts to stiffen. Use the icing immediately as it will harden. If it hardens before you are done icing put a splash of milk in and beat it again, just until its soft.

This wasn't quite enough for my two-layer, 9" round cake.  Next time I'll half again or double the recipe so it completely covers the sides.  I had no trouble with the consistency.  I poured the icing over the cake, then used a cake spatula to spread it and let it drip down the sides.  The icing is a very, VERY dark chocolaty flavor (less cocoa next time), but overall, a good icing.  Thanks!

I used this recipe as a ganache over a chocolate cake recipe from this site that I had baked in a bundt pan. It turned out perfect. I did not cook the icing as the recipe says. I actually put all the ingredients in a microwave safe bowl and microwaved it for 2 minutes and stirred it for another 2. I would point out that a sifter would need to be used at least for the cocoa as the icing could be lumpy without it. It turned out great! I didn't have to spread it but it would be easily been spreadable....I just drizzled the glaze over the bundt cake and it was beautiful and delicious. Great recipe to keep!

Pour this hot on your chocolate sheet cake that is fresh from the oven. Both will be super fudgy and very moist.  This frosting is not good for a layer cake, it sets up too fast.  I LOVE this recipe.  Thanks Sandy!

Perfect! I liked that it dried into a soft, non-sticky coating, similar to ganache, but easier. Thanks!

This had a good taste, but couldn't get the texture down. Even after making this the second time and cooking twice as long I could still taste the sugar crystals, which isn't noticeable until it cools down. Not sure how to take the 'crunchiness' out of the icing.

icing-not frosting.  Perfectly pourable!  Just poured it over the new Betty Crocker dome shaped cake.  Covered the dome entirely and little accumulated at the bottom of the cake plate.  Recipe needs no tweeking-excellent as is.  Just like Mom's-won't bother to find her recipe, now.

My new favorite icing to make...and eat!  Soooo good.  I should have made a double batch.  I only had enough to do about half of my cupcakes.  Love this recipe!  So great that I didn't have to use up all my confectioner's sugar!  Thanks for the recipe :)

Please add 2 Tablespoons of light corn syrup at the beginning.  It gives you something for the sugar to bind with but not form crystals.  Let the boiled mixture sit off the burner for 5 minutes undisturbed.  Moving it too soon sets off the crystallization phase.

Great Recipe. I used this icing for plain cake doughnuts, which I found on this website. After reading the reviews, I decided it would be a perfect icing. The only things I changed was to boil it for 1 minute 30 seconds and, instead of using an electric mixer, I whipped it with a whisk until it felt a little heavy.

This is not icing, it is chocolate syrup. I'll give it four stars though because I ended up just drizzling it over my cake and it looks pretty decent.

Perhaps a more experienced cook could make this better, but to me it tasted like chocolate cotton candy,
was grainy (even though I tried others suggestions to slowly heat it up), and it got hard too quickly to spread without tearing up the cake.  I'm going to try another recipe for chocolate frosting.

Love it!  I needed an icing for cupcakes.  Very easy and quick to make.  Not super sweet, just enough. Icing forms a nice shell when it sets up that reminded me of a ding dong.

Very tasty.  I reduced the beating time to 2min and immediately poured on the cooled cake.  No way you  could spread it once it was set - rock solid fudge, but awesome finish!

Fickle recipe.  I made it three times -- The first time I did not use the beater, and the recipe produced a delicious, fudge-like topping.  The second time I used the beater and the whole mess congealed and crystalized into a dull mass.  The third time it was too runny to use as cake icing (though it became a yummy fudge topping).  Overall I would have to say -- I won't make this again.

I like this chocolate icing recipe because it's so easy to make. 1 cup sugar was too sweet for me so I would recommend just 1/2 cup..It turned out great! Thank you for the recipe.

I used this on my husbands birthday cake instead of a traditional ganache and this worked out great and was very tasty. I simply poured this onto the Dark Chocolate Cake 1 recipe from this site and it set up so shiny and perfectly smooth. Thank you for this recipe!

I've never made a cooked chocolate icing before, thought it was too much hassle. This was so easy though! It is rich and fudge-y and so delicious!! I forgot the vanilla, though, I'm sure it tastes even better with the vanilla.  It set up nicely, perfect for my thumb-print cookies.

It is exactly what I needed, a frosting that would harden having as ingredient cocoa instead of chocolate. I made with this a dessert for Passover, I used 3/4 of sugar and totally forgot the vanilla! I spread it onto 3 matzos and piled them like a cake, before this I brushed them with sweetened milk so they would be a little bit less hard. Thank you!

I halved the recipe which was plenty to cover one 9-inch round cake. I used margarine because it's all I had, used half white sugar/half icing sugar as recommended and whisked by hand. I find it to be like a chocolate syrup that sets but easy and tasty.

I LOVE this icing!!  I love that it uses cocoa instead of chocolate chips.  I love that it is super quick to make and I love that it's delicious!  It sets quickly so have your cake ready to frost.  Be prepared it pour it on because it doesn't spread well.  Thank you for a great recipe!!

I made this recipe and added about 1/4 cup of cornstarch to it because it was very goopy at first. I added the cornstarch on to the pot of icing and it turned out great. I would recommend these on brownies. I have made this on brownies twice and all of my friends loved them. Make sure that they cool at room temprature. :)

This icing is so good!  Warning: it is very rich!  I was thinking that it would even be delicious spooned over ice cream while it is still warm.  This icing would also be delectable on brownies.  I will most surely make this icing again in the future.

I set out to make Texas sheet cake for my Mom's birthday,and the morning of baking the cake,I realized I didn't have any powdered sugar,which is what most of the icing recipes for the cake call for,so...I went on a mad search for a recipe that was quick,and didn't require powdered sugar. This recipe fit the bill for me,with a few exceptions. 1st off,most the the reviewers said it firmed up rather quickly,so I did pour the icing on my WARM cake,pretty much right from the oven. It spread beautiful and was easy to work with. It firmed up in a short time,and it turned out great. With that said,my sheet cake was quite large,its made in a 15" jelly roll pan; so I doubled the recipe. If you need to do that,DO NOT double the sugar amount. Way too sweet. It was edible,but a bit crunchy,due to all the sugar. The chocolate flavor was good,consistancy good,amount was good,just don't add too much sugar. Thanks for a great recipe! :)

Like other users, I too found this to be a fudge like consistancy.  I was able to frost a round layer cake but only because the cake was ready before the frosting.  I added one unsweetened chocolate square and used 2/3 cup white and 1/3 cup brown sugar instead of the cocoa.  Thanks for sharing!

I used Splenda instead of sugar, and margarine instead of butter.  I imagine butter would taste better, as it often does, but I'm a dieter, so I didn't use it.
I liked this recipe.  Used it for my brownies.
Only problem ... doesn't make very much.  I'd double it the next time.
Thanks for the recipe!  :)

I did a trial run of this icing last night to see if it would be good to frost brownies.  I loved the consistency and mine did not harden as others have mentioned.  I added some shredded coconut and used Hershey's Dutch Processed Cocoa. This was very yummy eaten with a spoon!  Thanks Sandy.

I was looking for a fudgy icing for brownies. This wouldn't work on a cake at all, but it was great on our brownies. The icing did set up quickly but it was no problem since I was pouring/spreading on a pan of brownies.

Rolling boil for one full minute, and beating it for three minutes gave us a frosting that seized up immediately upon (trying to) spreading it on the brownies we made this for. Would not use again.

The only things I changed was to add a tad more milk and I only beat mixture for about a minute or so. It had a great smooth consistency and poured easily over the chocolate bunt cake that my daughter and I made. I'm going to make this and use it as an ice-cream topping too, I think it would be good.

Best Choc Icing i have ever made! Thick, glossy & super sweet. No chocolate or icing sugar, both which i hate using :). Must be made when the cake had cooled though.

Not a good frosting for cupcakes. I tried making this with my nieces and it was so sticky and kinda hard so what we did was add milk and a little less cocoa powder and they loved decorating their own cupcake.

This is a great combination of ingredients. I wasn't too careful measuring, was making it in a hurry, and it turned out just right, just like the pictures. This is an easy recipe. Icing is VERY sweet, but works well with a spicy cake (I used a ginger cake... delish!)

Loved the fact that this was so fast, cheap and easy, with on-hand ingredients!
I followed the recipe exactly except I skipped the last bit (beating the icing for 3 minutes) because it seemed unnecessary- and it was.
Turned out very beautifully. Just like in the pictures it had a very nice shine to it.
I didn't have any problems to spread it on cake like other reviewers. 
I'm giving "only" four stars because it was a bit sticky too eat- but still a great recipe!

Absolutely delicious and very glossy. My only complaint is that it was a little thin, even when completely cooled, so that you could see the imperfections on my bundt cake. I would find a way to thicken it up next time (maybe by reading through the reviews here?).

The taste is there, but having the icing harden too much is an issue.  The only tip I can offer is, if you spread the icing and it is hardening too fast get your knife or whatever you are using  spread it hot.  Run it under hot water and it makes it easier to spread.  I use my fingers and it turned out well.  I would not beat it either and adding milk as needed is a great tip!

literally one minute iceing, very shiny, and very tasty.  very impressive.  I did not beat the icing as directed, just allow it to cool for a minute than pour it over the cooled cake.  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you for posting, Sandy.

This icing turned out really well, if a little heavy . The cake I used it on was a little to weak to hold up to this heavy treat. I poured it over my cake  while the icing was hot and as it cooled it pulled my cake apart. Luckily my Chef instructor had a great idea to use the product. ;D

Simple, easy and great. Careful with the amount of milk. I was attempting to avoid the too thick to spread syndrome by adding extra milk.   Yes, I did avoid it but then I had frosting that looked solid (in form) but kept spreading and moving over night.

Our 11 year old daughter tried to make her own icing, without a recipe, to match her grandmother's.  It didn't turn out, so I suggested she use this recipe and we absolutely LOVED IT.  it was very delicious and made just enough to cover our cake.  We will use this recipe again.

Excellent! I used this on "Black Magic Cake" found on this site. I have now made this recipe twice in a row.  Last night, I followed the directions exactly, and it made a very rich, dense fudge frosting.  Tonight, I decided to add 1 teaspoon of Pure Orange Extract to give it a chocolate orange flavor.  Instead of beating once I removed it from the heat, I poured it warm over the chocolate cake like a sauce...WOW! Either way this recipe is incredibly easy and tastes amazing! I think it could be fun to play around with different flavoring extracts and getting creative.  Maybe tomorrow I will try Almond!

Brilliant! We used this for a cupcake icing and it was delicious! Sort of like a hot fudge kind of texture and taste! We also used this as a ice cream topping and it tasted like a homeade hot fudge! It is so fast and easy! It took me about 7 minutes to complete! I will definitely be making this again!

I was out of shortening and needed a quick chocolate icing for a birthday cake.  This icing was easy and very tasty.  I received lots of compliments on it and will use it again.  I used powered sugar instead of granulated to avoid the gritty texture.  Thanks!

I didn't beat it after I blended it. I let it stand at room temperature until it got thicker and then I spread it on the cake. My only issue with it was it felt gritty, like the sugar hadn't dissolved. It's possible I didn't heat it enough.

YUMMMMMYYYYY!!  Super rich, super chocolaty & sooooo easy to make!  Glad I read some other reviews noting how sweet this was, so I decided to cut my sugar back to 1/2 cup and my (good quality) dark cocoa back to 2/3 cup.  After removing from the stove, I let cool slightly before pouring over my Peanut Butter Brownies I from this site.  This added a very rich topping to the brownies, really glad I cut back on the sugar & would probably reduce a bit more next time.  Will use this again for sure!

Fudge-like was a good description. It's not your fluffy smooth icing if that's what you are looking for.  Tasted great on vanilla cupcakes.  Didn't need to use mixer for last 3 minutes, just did by hand with a whisk.  Using sugar instead of 10x like a lot of other icings gives you a grainier icing, so skip this one if that bothers you.

Tasted good and very easy to make. I had difficulty spreading it on to my cake as it became hard.  Maybe I cooked it too long?  I'll do better next time.  Overall very good and yummy.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I had little ingredients so had to improvise. This was a perfect recipe. I had only bakers chocolate squares, so I used those instead of cocoa powder. Came out delicous and glossy.

I just made this to go over a peanut butter bar cake and the consistency was great.  It's in the fridge now cooling so I'll wait and see how it sets up.  But I licked the spatula and it was so good!  I've finally found a rich chocolate icing!

When I saw this called for 1 cup of sugar, I decided to make only 3 servings, as a test run to try on my chocolate cupcakes, this was enough to frost them all and I even had some left over, but I did add some more milk, since the I found the chocolate flavor very deep. Pretty good recipe, will make again, thanks!

I had no problems with this icing. I dumped all the ingredients in, made sure to watch it so it didn't burn, stirred constantly, took it off the heat, and stirred it by hand until it was ready to drizzle over my cake. spread out wonderfully, I even got a little creative and made a smaller amount, minus the cocoa, and was able to get a nice whitish icing to make a heart on the cake. (valentines day). I will be using this recipe again and again!

We needed icing RIGHT NOW and didn't have any - allrecipes to the rescue! =)    I loved this recipe because it used only a few basic ingredients.  We didn't have butter so used margarine.  I only had either skim milk or half-and-half in the fridge - guess which one I used.  =D  The icing turned out delicious.  It is very thick and sticky so we plopped it on our cookies tout de suite.  Yum.    With a spoon and a cup of half-and-half you wouldn't need the cookie. =)  I'm interested to see what the icing is like when it's cooled.  Will I be able to get it out of the container it's in?  Will I need to heat it up?  Will I need to use that spoon and half-and-half? =)  Whatever happens, it will no doubt be a delicious happening.

When in a hurry for an icing. This is great. It does harden quick so I poured the icing straight off the stove onto a cake I had baked in a loaf pan and poked holes in it. Turned out great.Harden wonderfully. Then decorated with strawberries and confectioners sugar. Beautiful. Very rich dark chocolate flavor. Being one for speed I will use again!

This recipe was great, but... It wasn't the type of icing I was looking for, but I added powdered sugar at the end and it turned out to be wonderful fudge. My husband loves it!

This was excellently easy. I didn't even use a beater to get the consistency up - just throw it in the freezer for 20 minutes and it looks and feels just like frosting.  However, its really really gooey, so its great for cookies and brownies, but not so much for cakes!  Tastes delicious :)

I omitted the butter. I also do not have any vanilla. I added maybe an 1/8 cup more milk and cooked it a little longer. At first it was grainy. It is very rich and runny. It's more of a chocolate sauce but I must admit I do not have a mixer. I put it in the fridge and hopefully it will thicken enough to mix by hand.

I used 4oz of baker's chocolate in this recipe, and it turned out pretty well. I think it's a little bit too rich, and didn't care for it much at all when it was still warm, but I refrigerated the cupcakes I iced and after refrigeration the icing was thick, decadent, and pretty delicious.

I put this icing on top of the egg free/dairy free chocolate cake recipe and it was delicious.  I did change a few things-I used margarine instead of butter, soy milk, added some semi-sweet chocolate chips, and 3 teaspoons of flour.  Melting everything in a double broiler works best and letting the sauce cool before you add it to the cake also works.

Wow, the chocolate in this one was pretty strong to me. It reminds me of dark chocolate rather than fudge. Still, I'd say it turned out well considering the simplicity of ingredients. I noticed one someone had a problem beating it with their electric mixer. I just grabbed a fork and did it by hand. It might have taken a few minutes longer but it was worth it for the "perfect" consistancy.

I used a 4oz bar of Ghiradelli unsweetened chocolate and this turned out great! This is not icing you could spread on a cake, it sets too quickly and is too fudgy. I poured the warm icing over my cake and it covered it perfectly and looked and tasted great!

Ha....I halved this recipe, but didn't halve the sugar....which would be the reason that it was "gritty"....duh.  Aside from that...had I done it right this was an easy excellent recipe.  Oh, during the mixing, which I did in the kitchen aid I added a splash more milk and that took care of the thickness.  I topped "deep dish brownies" (from this site) and it came out fab.  Thanks Sandy!!

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe! Not only did it make AMAZING fudgy icing for my brownies in no time at all, it is also a fantastic hot fudge recipe for ice cream! No joke, I doubled the recipe and stuck it in a jar in my fridge. Now I can have Hot Fudge Sundays any time I want! Thank you for sharing!

Very simple straight forward and great outcome. Really don’t feel like going to the store for frosting today. Found this recipe and it turned out great. Definitely going to use next time I make brownies. Great topping for this mayonnaise cake I made today.

I put all the ingredients together in a microwavable bowl and stirred a little bit then put it in the microwavefor two minutes.  Then i stirred with a wisk about  30 seconds and put it back in the microwave another minute and 30 seconds.  Then i whisked the icing for about 2 minutes.  It was a beautiful glaze. I poured it over the cake. Beautiful gloss.  Don't spread it because it will ruin the gloss. Double the recipe if you think you will need more. This one is a keeper.

This is a great icing recipe that's quick and easy to make with ingredients that most everyone has in their cupboard handy. Saved me a trip to the store! And, I know exactly what's in it!

So fast, easy, and good!  I doubled the batch for a 9 inch layer gluten free chocolate cake.  I took other reviewer's advice and poured it over the cooled cake.  It was a  big hit.

The ingredient list was great.    
1) When bringing the mix to a boil, use medium or medium low heat and have patience.  If you go full heat, you will end up with a rock hard mess.  
2) As soon as the mix hits boiling, time for 1 minute or use a candy thermometer to get the mix right under soft ball stage. 
3) The mix needs much longer than 3 minutes to cool.  I went with closer to 15 minutes while watching it closely and mixing often.  I was still able to poor it over my cupcakes and the ganache still hold its shape. 
While using these instructions, the recipe was perfect.  Someone new to baking or new to ganache would not have been able to put that together themselves, that is why I only gave it 3 stars.  I basically had to rewrite the entire recipe.

I was searching for an easy chocolate frosting and found this. I actually hate frosting/icings, but my husband loves them. This seemed simple enough to make while my mini cupcakes were baking. I'm beyond grateful for all of you who commented about the frosting getting rock hard. I actually didn't mix mine as some of you advised against it. I lrt it cool slightly and spooned it over my cupcakes as a ganache and it is AMAZING! Thanks everyone who commented!

PROS: This icing is delicious, glossy and doesn't need powdered sugar.
CONS: It sets up fast if you even slightly overboil it (like spreading grainy fudge!) If that starts to happen, beat in some more milk.  Also, it doesn't make a lot so you may want to double it if you need more frosting.

Take note of the picture and the fact that the base of this recipe is normal sugar that is cooked, which would make the consistency more of a ganache, or a glaze then a fluffy frosting.

The taste was ten stars. I never could spread it even after doubling the mlk. Sure enjoyed eating it right out of the bowl though. Tastes just like hot fudge.

It was amazing! I need a chocolate frosting recipe that did not use powdered sugar as I have none and this works out perfectly. When it came off the stove I whisked until it started to thicken and poured it onto of the cake. While it was making its way to the edges I helped it along with my finger. The shine is incredible and the cake tastes delish!

I made four batches of this frosting to cover 2 sheet pans of peanut butter bars, I didn't beat it after it came to a boil just poured it over the bars and smoothed with an offset spatula, it harden nicely within a short period of time, very fudgy and tasty.

AMAZING! This is by  far the best chocolate frosting recipe I have used! I usually make a classic chocolate buttercream frosting, but I was out of powdered sugar and decided to give this a try. It was super rich and chocolatey, totally delicious. It complemented my Texas sheetcake wonderfully! But, I did add an extra teaspoon of vanilla and cut back on the cocoa a bit

I made this recipe to go with a chocolate cake I had baked and it was the perfect touch. I have not had much success with icings in the past, but this was quick and easy and turned out great. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

If you are looking for regular cake frosting I do not recommend this recipe. I made the mistake of using the icing instead of frosting when I found this recipe. It is definitely an icing and not a frosting. I used it on the "One Bowl Chocolate Cake" featured on this site. There was not enough to ice the whole cake and it set very firm. Recommend for cookies not for cakes.

I needed to make icing before going to work this morning for a cake that I baked last night. It was wonderful.  However it was only enough to place between the layers and cover the top with some drizzle. But that suits me, not huge icing fan.

The end result of this icing was absolutely perfect.  I made it to top off the Tiramisu Cheesecake (also on this AR site) that had chilled in the fridge for a few hours.  It spread perfectly to the edges, and set up nicely.  You can obviously adjust the amount of milk to suit the consistency you're looking for. Next time, I might try a liqueur in place of the vanilla.

I made this exactly as written.  If you like homemade cocoa fudge as icing, this one is for you.  It is not creamy - it is fudgy.  It sets up quickly and becomes difficult to spread.  You must be looking for the consistency of fudge to like this icing.  We didn't care for it.

Well it took more than 1 minute, but this was easy and didn't need powdered sugar, yay!

I tripled the recipe for everything except the vanilla (oops, I forgot it). Also used margarine not butter, and soy milk not cow's milk. The character of the icing did not change with beating; that is, seemed the same before and after.

A tripled recipe was ample for two 9 X 13 cakes. I poured / dolloped it on like ganache, just smoothing a bit with the back of the spoon. 

Great recipe!

Rich and fabulous, this should be called chocolate fudge icing.  I added 1/4 cup peanut butter after removing from heat and poured it on top of brownies that I had pierced with a toothpick.  My kids loved it.

Edible glue!  It really is delicious, but man is it messy!  It definitely needs to be the right consistency before pouring on the cake. This just soaked into the cake and it didn't look like it was iced.  I also had to add leftover "set" icing onto the cake before eating.  I've made this several times and only once did it turn out good.  The one time it turned out well, I used slightly more milk and let it completely set to "icing" texture and kept it in an airtight container at room temperature and it was great.  I used it with the Black Magic Cake from this site and they work well together.  Just be prepared to let your icing sit before pouring it on the cake, or use it to spread onto cupcakes.

This icing is very sticky and not really spreadable. It needs to be poured over your cake. I also didn't think that the recipe made much. It does taste good though. I'll make it again.

Easy and tasty! I followed the recipe except using mixer. I just whisked it by hand and it still turned out great. As ROSEMC91 recommended, I used this icing with Dark Chocalate Cake I which is also on this site. The cake tasted better and looked very nice. Million thanks!

Great recipe, so easy! I made it just like the recipe, except instead of mixing with a mixer for three minutes I just whisked it by hand. Turned out great, wonderful taste and beautiful looking finish!

While it set up nice and had a pretty gloss the amounts were off and I had to make more to cover my entire cake. Very sweet.

I can't bake worth snot... but I was able to make a cake with my kids and I found them with a soup spoon in each hand going crazy with this icing.   "Best icing ever Dad!"  So, Thank You!!!   p.s. I added a tbsp of instant coffee to the recipe because my wife loves mocha.

This was absolutely delicious.  I wouldn't exactly call this an icing as I could only imagine how dreadfully difficult it would be to spread this around on a cake.  I simply cooked it, removed from the heat, and stirred vigorously with a spoon for about a minute.  Poured over a warm from the oven cake, the recipe made a BEAUTIFUL, smooth, glossy glaze.  will definitely be using again.

This  was great! The only thing I would do different is use 1/2 of sugar it was so sweet but good...I didn't have any vanilla extract and I dont drink milk so I use vanilla soy milk. Also I added a dash of cinnamon and cayenne red pepper!

I'm glad i read the reviews first! I was looking for a fun way to make a snack for my daughters class, this did however end up very nice! I decided to make chocolate drops! A neat creation! I made sugar cookie dough and cooked them in little balls. I used this recipe to make the coating. just dipped them in and put them on wax paper and put them in fridge right away! Makes the frosting harden even faster! Plus I made a little change I didnt have any Baking cocoa, so I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup nesquik. Worked great!!And tasted Yummy as well!

This icing was exactly what I expected, consistency- wise. I am going to try to get a more milk chocolate flavor, but there certainly is nothing wrong with this one. Very easy and extremely rich! Perfect on a homemade butter pound cake.

Oh yum, this is one of my new favorite toppings.  Would be great on brownies, sheet cakes, and ice cream.  It's much easier to pour over a cake than spread, and the consistency is sort of like the thickness that you get from Hershey's syrup.  I loved the taste, not too sweet, not too bitter.  I cut the recipe in half for a small batch of brownies.  Will be making again for sure!

I cut the recipe in half and used buttermilk (3 TBSP). I poured it hot on to the cake, rather than risk it being too sticky to spread. Because I used half the recipe, it was more like rich, dark chocolate icing than frosting... delicious.

This actually turned out to be a really decent icing. I substituted the cocoa with a bar of melted chocolate and the result was a gooey Mars bar-like fudge. I poured it onto a chocolate cake and chilled it overnight. It was just perfect the next day and not too hard. I would definitely recommend using melted chocolate instead of the cocoa.

Great recipe although I did add powdered sugar to make the icing more sweet otherwise, mine came out a bitter chocolate icing. I would also add more milk if you are adding the powdered sugar.

Its pretty good. it was late i wanted some chocolate so i found a box of yellow cake mix and started baking. i made this *icining" (its kinda thick)  when the cake was done and out of the oven. i let the icing cool for about ten minutes then poured it on the cakie and let it harden. it is pretty good but its a little to co-coey for me.

I made the recipe as written, it's not clear if I begin to beat it while it's hot or let it cool down, so I beat it while it was hot. I don't see how it will cool in 3 minutes as it was just boiling... so I've beat it for 10 minutes, and it's still hot but it did thicken. Maybe I was confusing icing with frosting, I was expecting fluffy frosting and this is not very sweet, nor is it fluffy. The picture wasn't coming up when I had the recipe up or that would have been a clue. I gave it three stars as I'm not crazy about the flavor, I wasn't expecting a 'dark chocolate' type frosting.

Good recipe but requires modification -- be sure to see the reviews first!

I made it as written but the frosting set up even before I finished beating it. It is definitely salvageable and delicious though--I added 2-3 T. of butter plus 2-3 T. of half-and-half and beat the frosting again. I let it set about 30 minutes and it iced the cake beautifully, giving it that nice shiny finish that sets up with a fudgy finish.

Next time I will read the reviews more thoroughly to see how to modify the recipe to begin with, or maybe search for another recipe. Very happy with the results but only after modifying. 

Thank you for posting though--it's really nice to have such a deep fudgy icing instead of a powdered sugar frosting.

The icing was easy to make but it was not enough for a two layer nine inch cake, I melted my butter and I mixed the cocoa and sugar together before I added it to the saucepan. After I took it off the burner I beat the icing for only two minutes any longer and the icing would get hard I am giving it 4 stars  because it wasn't enough to finish my cake. I will make it again but I will double the recipe.

I used this to dip pretzels in. It turned out kind of grainy but it tasted good with pretzels so I don't really mind. My notes are that :
1. When the recipe says to stir "constantly", it means literally be stirring it at all times. Or it will burn, and catch fire.
2. When you add the milk to the mixture, it won't mix. Just let go and add the MELTED butter, then it will mix and it will be about the consistency of brownie batter. Don't be worried if the milk won't mix in with the cocoa and sugar. You just have to add the butter.
3. Take it off of the stove when it starts bubbling. You might not be able to see if you are stirring, so if you think it is ready stop stirring and see if bubbles pop up.
4. Instead of using an electric mixer, I used a whisker and beat it for three minutes. Then I waited a little bit for it to cool before dipping the pretzels. 

If you want it on a cake, you have to pour it QUICK, without letting it cool after beating it. Otherwise it will become UNSPREADABLE. If the cake is not completely cooled, it might actually help. 

I put it in the fridge for a few hours, and now I'm eating it like fudge with pretzels. 

So, TLDR, it was good but kind of grainy so don't use this on like a wedding cake or something really important. Bye!

The absolute best chocolate icing I’ve ever tasted. Ive tried many recipes and keep going back to this one, it’s now a staple in my home. We use it for brownies and cake and often. The only critique I’d give is it’s a little too sweet, which is easily adjustable by adding less sugar. Would recommend letting it boil for all of 30-40 seconds, stirring for just a few seconds, and applying it immediately to whatever you’re using it for. That seems to work perfectly for me.

Yes I will make it again. I added 1tbspn more butter for a thicker consistency. It spread pretty good. Didn't get all the way like frosting more like a thicker chocolate for donuts.  But tasty. I cooled it with ice in a bowl underneath. It takes longer than its one minute name. About 30-45 mins till ready to spread.

Thanks for the great recepie, I made it for my boyfriend’s birthday and that was so yummy, he loved it. After checking the reviews, I decided to mix it only for a minute with my electric mixer so that it wouldn’t get so thick. That was perfectly thick and runny enough to pour over my vanilla cake. I had some leftover, so used the rest for a loaf cake and kept it in the fridge. A delucious fudgy cake frosting:)

I had a tip from a pro pastry chef about a certain chocolate cake recipe but I didn't want to do that particular frosting, and came across this one. Cooked up very quickly, and after looking at reviews on here, decided to pour it instead of attempt to spread it....which worked perfectly.It's not only delicious, it's a very shiny, pretty finish. Looks like I knew what I was doing or somethin! THANKS for posting this! I'll use it from now on!

As other reviews noted, I stirred briefly after taking it off the heat and poured it over the cake.  Combined with a semi-crumbly cake it made a bit of a mess, but was *very* tasty!  The cake itself wasn't that chocolaty, and this icing definitely added a chocolate punch.

Followed the recipe except subbed Kahlua for milk, I wanted the coffee flavor.  It worked just fine and set up very quickly.  I recommend doubling the recipe (and cutting back on sugar if you think it's too sweet) because it was just barely enough for my 9 X 13 sheet cake. I used sifted superfine bakers sugar, and there was no grainy taste.

Very delicious, and easy to make!!! Also looks great!!!! Pour on over cake quickly do not wait till it is too thick it looks nicer when you pour it evenly over the Cake and it thickens by itself.

I never rate things but just had to share that this is the best icing/ganache I've ever had or made.  Complimented my chocolate cake so well.  Only tried the recipe because I was short on time but now this is the only recipe I'll ever use for chocolate cake.  For a chocoholic like me, it's perfect.  If you're the type that is more of a vanilla fan, then it might be too chocolatey for you.  Like a ganache that you'd get in a high-end restaurant.  Wow!

I followed recipe as written. I did have trouble getting a rolling boil, took it off the heat when I smelled burning chocolate   poured  chocolate out of pan,  it was burnt on bottom  of pan.   The texture was very gritty.   
Tossed it

It was way more like a ganache. I liked the taste. Just spread it when it is hot.

I stumbled upon this recipe while looking for a frosting recipe that did not call for confectioner's sugar. I decided to give this recipe a try, and I am glad I did! I topped some homemade brownies off with this recipe, and the fudgey, soft-set, smooth consistency was the perfect way to compliment my brownies! will definitely make again! Really stellar flavor and consistency.

I love this recipe! I was craving a doubly chocolately iced cake but didn't have any powdered sugar on me - so this worked out perfectly! Super easy to make and turned out rich and delicious! Just a heads up - this is NOT a frosting recipe. So don't expect a creamy texture. It's thick and sticky. With that being said, it's wonderful! Remind me to put this on some sugar cookies sometime!

Loved it but found it to be a bit grainy.  I might add the 2 Tbs of light corn syrup next time that another user suggested.

I made a cake for my staff here at work. I chose this icing because other recipes called for confectioner's sugar and I didn't have any.  I also did not have an electric mixer, so I just used a spoon to mix it.  It took several minutes longer than the 3 minutes with a mixer for it to thicken.  Everyone said how fresh it tasted and that they loved it.

It's very easy to make, and it takes less than five minutes. However, it is a tad too sweet, even for icing. Perhaps there is a way to alter the recipe so that it maintains its density without all the sugar.

This is disgusting. I created an account on this site to simply warn you off of it. Just take that trip to the store, get a candy bar, and melt that sucker down bc this is bad in every way, from texture to taste. Yes, I did it correctly. Yes, the brevity was nice. Yes, it looks nice. But it is inedible. I scraped it off of my Depression Era cake.

This was first chocolate icing i ever made and now its a favourite of everyone in my house. Its really delicious. I decrease the amount of sugar indicated. I put 3/4 cup sugar and whisking it is enough. No electric mixer is needed. It needs to be spread immediately on the cooled cake otherwise it sets and it becomes hard to spread.
Its an awesome recipe for first timers.

This is an excellent recipe. I followed the recommendation of one of the reviews, pouring it directly over the cake while the icing was hot. What a great way to finish a chocolate cake. My only crib is that the sugar takes a little while to dissolve, you need to keep checking to ensure it's nice incorporated into the cocoa sauce.

Absolutely delicious and decadent! Made this for my chocoholic hubby's birthday. Nothing ever seems chocolatey enough for him! But this frosting actually made him smile and admit that this cake had hit the mark (I had made a dark chocolate cake from a mix to go with this)! I poured the frosting over the bottom layer of a 2-layer cake and let it cool enough to set. Then I added the top layer of the cake and poured the other half of the frosting on top, letting it run slightly down the sides. After it set up for a few minutes, it formed a shiny, semi-soft shell over the cake. I will definitely use this recipe whenever I want to wow a chocoholic!

Followed exactly with ingredients. I did beat it with mixer but only for about a minute as I saw it stiffen up. Then I poured it quickly over a 2 layer cake, letting it drip down the sides. Everyone is right, this is a pourable NOT spreadable icing as it hardens up very fast. Very fudge-like and delicious. Would definitely make again.

I LOVE this recipe. Follow the directions and it will go perfectly. My husband loves it too. It makes a nice, fudge like/donut kind of icing. Very easy and the ingredients are usually things you already have around the house.

This recipe was easy and just covered a double layer 9 in cake. Knowing when to start pouring (not spreading!) is tricky--too soon or too late will ruin it.  It needs to be pourable but not runny.

This is a good recipe for pouring. It's an icing, not a frosting that is easily spread. For those of you who have sugar crystals in your icing -- you've cooked it too long.

This recipe is perfect the way it is. Be sure your cake is cooled or it will absorb the icing (Don't know how I know this. ??) If I happen to do this, I would have had to make another batch of my icing because the cake would have absorbed all the icing. ?? Also if you happen to use more than a quarter cup of milk it will not set up as nicely??, not that I know this personally. 

It reminds you of Texas sheet cake icing. This is the type of icing that you pour and then it sets glossy smoothly, not good for a layered or tiered cake. It is perfectly amazing for Bundt cakes or sheet cakes, just like the old-fashioned cakes your grandma used to make with the boiled icing- so good!

I like the icing because it did not have confectionery sugar and the flavor was good and not tooo sweet. I did have trouble when it was setting before I got it on the cake and had to molded it like clay.  I will try it again ...maybe less beating or pouring it over top when more wet?

The flavor is AWESOME! I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa. I followed the recipe, mixing 3 minutes with the hand mixer and it just sets up too fast this way!
I wouldn't bother using the mixer at all next time.
I'm just going to stir by hand for one minute and then pour slowly over top of my brownies.
Finished...it's a great Chocolate Fudge recipe also!

My chocolate icing or frosting I did mot boil it at first.I did use the very dark pure coco powder of 2 2/3 cups,1/2 cup of unsalted butter,2 cups of confectionery sugar,1/3 cup of 2% milk and I use 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla sugar because I did not have vanilla abstract.I put the ingredients in the bowl and mixed it with the electric mixer.It didn't come out right because the sugar was sticking to the mixer blade.I was adding more milk,sugar, milk and even vanilla ice cream to try to get it to be thicken.I did not want to use it that is when I thought,can I boil the chocolate coco icing?For one thing it was raw just mixing it with the ingredients. Boiling it to cook before using is better. That is when I saw this recipe. Only I had everything already mixed together and just put it in a sauce pan to boil and then I let it simmer.It did make big bubbles and I stir it to make sure it will not stick to the bottom of the sauce pan. It still was sticking.It taste okay but I think it has a strong taste because of the dark coco.I am waiting for it to cool off and I may just store it in a jar and put it in the refrigerator. I will try again to make soon.

I made this because I didn't have confectioners sugar and needed frosting for a chocolate cake.  It was delicious but I tried to frost a two layers cake.  I must have done something wrong because after beating, it was very hard to spread on cake.  I will try again to try to get this right!

I made this as an icing  for homemade chocolate brownies, it turned out wonderful, and was sooo good on the brownies. It does get thick as you are mixing it though, so I'm not sure it would be good as a topping for cake.

I made this and at first it had sticky consistency, then i put it in the fridge and it thickened up. It was delicious but  it was like fudge, so i melted it and drizzled it on the cake and it was amazing! I also used hot coco instead of coco powder because i was out of coco powder, I think that this made it amazing!! I am going to make this again but make it as fudge!!

Taste great.  I was expecting it to be runny since it's a cooked icing but in the end it hardens up a little too much.  I do agree with the other reviews and suggestions.  May help a little.  Also be sure your cake is really cool otherwise it will pull up the cake.  Anxious to try it with the cake now.  Looks amazing

I would definitely give this recipe a job well done. This is exactly what I had asked for and turned out exactly the way I wanted it too. A quick tip for those who are making it - once you are done with boiling the ingredients DON'T worry if your mixture is still looking liquid, it will become more fluffy once a little bit cooled!

It was great but I added confectioner's sugar to make it smoother and it took me a really long time to get fluffy icing, but the outcome was worth it.

I needed an icing or frosting recipe for shortbread cookies, but I didn't have confectioners sugar or butter on hand. This recipe met my needs perfectly. Instead of butter I replaced with equal parts coconut oil and it came out tasting and looking exactly how I wanted it to. This recipe was a true life saver and honestly, I think the coconut oil made the consistency that much smoother and I'd use coconut oil again even if I have butter. I also used unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk instead of regular milk to cut back a bit on sugar and calories. Oh and I cut back just a tad on the sugar being careful not to fill the measuring cup to the top but somewhat close enough. Glad I did because even with the little bit of sugar I cut back on this frosting/icing is still quite sweet! In a good way of course. Overall great recipe, thank you!

This is the first time I have made this recipe, and I love it. The generous tips shared by other users were essential to the recipe's success, including:
-- The cautions to pour (not spread) the frosting over the cake before it hardens from a liquid to a solid as it cools. After removing it from the stove, I beat it with a wooden spoon till the resistance told me it was about to turn fudgey, and
-- The advice to make 150-200% of the recipe for a layer cake. I would make a double batch for two layers. The recipe, as is, covered the top and sides of one 9-inch round layer.

Otherwise, I'd have awarded 5 stars.

One tip I would add is to be careful as the mixture heats up. Stir  quickly and constantly, scraping the bottom of the pan. I had to bring down the flame a little at one point, so the mixture did not burn. 

Another hint is to consider using strong, leftover coffee in place of the milk and to add a shake of cinnamon and a shake of salt, all tactics for adding depth to the chocolate flavor.

I have photos but don't see any way to submit them. If I figure it out, I'll post them.

This frosting is wonderful!  Be sure to double or triple the recipe for a layer cake as this was only enough to top two layers (I like to be generous with frosting).

I made this icing to put on small chocolate bundt cakes.  This worked perfectly, set up well and had a pretty glossy finish.  I have made this twice now and they only complaint is that it's a little bitter and not that sweet, oddly.  The next time that I make it, I will add maybe a 1/4 cup more sugar and cut back on the cocoa.  Otherwise, this worked beautifully.

Loved this recipe.. It's a good substitute for ganache.. I used 1/2 cup of milk instead of 1/4. Didn't need to beat the mixture. I actually poured it warm on warm chocolate cake.. it was simple delish & btw.. tasted even better the next day after the flavors married. Thank you!

Great recipe!  Does get very thick as mentioned in other reviews.  Placed in bowl with ice water to cool while beating.  Added 1T of softened cream cheese as it started thickening.  Then plopped an ice cube in and kept beating until about halfway gone.  Icing was perfect and mixer survived.  Able to pipe and spread.  :)

I am not sure about this recipe. I made this to go on my chocolate cake, as I didn't want to drive in the pouring down rain to get my usual frosting ingrediants. I definetly doubled the recipe. after I got it to boil I stirred it for the 1 minute. I then proceded to use my mixer for over 3 min. so I put the suace pan into a bowl of ice water to cool it faster.After several more minutes it began to thicken.My cake was completely cooled before I began spreading it on. The icing was still very thin. by the time i finished icing the cake the icing was thickening alot. i guess its  very heavy icing since the middle of my cake started to cave in a little bit. this recipe is a winner. let it cool way down before decorating cake. everyone loved it on the hersheys perfect chocolate cake!

Pros: I followed others' recommendations (cook longer; wire whisk; frost right away) which helped.  The sugar definitely needs more than a minute to melt.  Cons: recipe as given is "gag me"sweet.  I will use much less sugar next time.

This was such a great frosting!  Like others, I poured it over my cooled cake directly from the pot, without using the electric mixer.  It leaves such a beautiful gloss over the cake.  I also used almond extract instead of vanilla and it had amazing flavor!

This is a nice and easy icing that gives your dessert a glossy, dark chocolate finish. Because I wanted to drizzle it on  cream puffs, I didn't beat it very long as the recipe requested which worked out very well. The only downside is I wish it had been a little sweeter but everyone still enjoyed it.

Delicious, just as described. I doubled the recipe, poured it over a 9x11 chocolate cake and it was a hit. Pour fast because it cools quickly. Love the shine of the chocolate.

Very good chocolate icing.  Be carefull, it sets up fast.  Barely had enough to cover my 9x13 cake.  Double or maybe triple if icing a layered cake.  Better yet, make multiple batches if you can't use it quickly.

I loved it! I tried it because  the ingredients are  almost exact to no-bake cookies and thought, hmmmm, how interesting! 
Of course,just like no-bake cookies you need to be very precise in your in how long you boil it. Too little will be too sticky, a little more than you should and you get no bake cookie,way too much and you get almost hard tootsie roll candy. :)  But hey! That is the same with no bake cookies, right?:)
I am already  dreaming up some add-ons to experiment with for future stuff. I think I'm liking it best on my brownies for now.
Thanks! Fun recipe.
P.S.You're right, pour and gently smooth with rubber spatula. No direct spreading. But  that's kind of common sense with the texture.:)

This was so so so easy, yummy and beautifully shiny and smooth. I almost didn't' want to put it on my cake, just eat it out of the bowl instead! I halved the recipe and used it for an 8x8 lemon cake. I boiled for a minute, took it off of the heat and whisked it until it was the right consistency. Make sure you don't boil a second too long or it will harden too much when cooled.

I made this for my chocoalte layer cake (with mousee between the layers, yum). I read alot of reviews before making this, and decided to use a wire whisk after taking it off the heat. It really does thicken fast as it cools..so after about 3 mins of just whisking it i poured it over my cake right in the middle, and let it run all around. The end result was a little different then i imagined, i guess i was thinking it would turn out like a ganache, but it just turned into some gooey sticky fudge like sauce,which did harden at least. It is super tasty and i probably WILL be making this again, maybe ontop of brownies next time!

Great recipe. Mine didn't set that fast but it still tastes great. Had to boil a little longer to make sure all of the sugar melted.

This is a great tasting icing, very fudgy and not too sweet! I used it on a cake right after I beat it for the 3 min so it was still really warm. It is runny so it's great if you don't want the icing to be thick. It sets up as it cools and has a wonderful sheen!

Didn't have any cream to make a ganache and this was perfect! Very chocolatey and smooth. My son liked it so much that he ate the whole top off the leftover half of the cake. Not joking!

This would be great between the layers of a cake but you really can't spread it. So I think I will stick with buttercream for the top.

Fantastic recipe! I was looking for something without confectioners sugar and this recipe nailed it! Beautiful and shiny! I had a hard time cooling it in my stand mixer because of the SS bowl. I poured it over the cake while hot and it was oh so ooey gooey! As suggested by another review, I will be trying it on brownies next, or as a filling. LOVE IT!
