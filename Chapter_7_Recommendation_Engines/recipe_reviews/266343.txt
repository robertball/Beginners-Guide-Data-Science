I really enjoyed making this recipe.  I wasnt able to marinate for four hours, only about two, so i added extra seasoning to be safe.  I also used fresh mozzarella and baked my chicken for about 17 minutes instead of 10 because my breasts were pretty large, even after i pounded them.  The balsamic reduction definitely added some great additional flavors to the dish!!

So delicious!!! I'm definitely putting this in my keeper file!  Due to poor planning on my part, I only ended up marinating the chicken about 30 minutes, but even so, it had plenty of flavor. Very fresh, summery flavors that are sure to impress your guests. I used a bottled balsamic glaze (instead of making it per the recipe) because I had some on hand. I ended up cooking the chicken about 20 mins because they were rather large pieces, and it came out SO juicy! I also used fresh mozzarella.

This was a great recipe! The only thing I did different was I cut the breast in half and stuff them because it was too hard to roll up everything together.

I made this recipe for a family dinner.  I couldn’t marinate it for 4 hours so I made more marinade and flipped the chicken a few times.  This was a big hit!  So much so it’s been requested again already.  Two thumbs up!!!
