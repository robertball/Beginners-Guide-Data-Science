This sauce was wonderful!  It was so easy and you can prepare it ahead of time because it cooks in the crock pot.  I cooked country style pork ribs in it (also in the crock pot) for the 12 hours and they were great.  I saved the sauce and cooked some extra ribs a few days later.  It's sweet but spicy/tangy at the same time.  I would definitely recommend it.

Oh this was perfect.  This only thing I did different because we like things with a little more spice was add a whole habanero pepper to it while slow cooking!  I will continue to use this recipe!

Great sauce! The slow cooker makes it easy to make and convenient. I ate it on everything from meats to sandwiches to scrambled eggs. This recipe's a winner!
