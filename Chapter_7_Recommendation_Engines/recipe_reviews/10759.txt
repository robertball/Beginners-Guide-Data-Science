This doesn't make a lot (approx. 15 cookies when put together, 22 using my smallest scooper), so when you double this, don't double the filling.  It's more than enough ...trust me if you don't want to go into a sugar shock!!! lol  A thin layer is plenty sweet.  Thought this was useful to know, so ingredients aren't wasted.  Also, when applying the filling especially when you get anxious like me, it's easier to do it while the cookie is on a flat surface instead of trying to hold it in your hand or raised.  The cookie will break in half.  10 min. was perfect baking time.  It helps to refrigerate for a little while to ensure cookies aren't flat, but definitely flatten w/fork.  While it does flatten, to get that perfect cookie as pictured, it requires you to flatten a little.  Using ingredients that are room temperature helps w/the overall consistency of the final product.  These were a hit, and people are always amazed these were baked not bought!

I made these without the filling, and they're delicious as a stand-alone cookie!  Super quick and easy, too.  The trick is to avoid the temptation to over-bake them, because they don't LOOK done when they come out of the oven, but they set up nicely as they cool.  I make mine slightly bigger than the recipe says and bake for exactly 10 minutes, and let them cool four or five minutes before removing them from the sheet.  This is my new favorite.

This is my go-to cookie for showing off. I dip mine in chocolate also when they're done. Who doesn't love the peanut butter-chocolate combo? Over a double boiler over
medium low heat melt three 4 oz bars of ghiradelli
semi-sweet chocolate, or 12 oz of semisweet chocolate
chips along with about 3-4 tbsp of crisco. Dip the cookies into the chocolate. I usually dip just one side. Sometimes I
dip the whole top of the cookie. You could try the
whole cookie in chocolate, but thats pretty indulgent.
Anyway, once dipped, set the cookies on wax paper. I
do this on the cookies sheets. Then I put a whole
sheet of freshly dipped cookies in the freezer. This
sets the chocolate. (You can also add sprinkles to the dipped cookies directly after dipping...I shake mine on.)

These were great.  However, I modified them the second time I made them.  They were a bit too greasy and crumbly and the filling was too thin and I so next time I will make these ingredient and measurement modifications:

4 tablespoons margarine, softened;
1 cup packed light brown sugar;
½  teaspoon baking soda; 
½ teaspoon salt; 
¾ cup peanut butter; 
¼ milk;
1 egg;
1 teaspoon vanilla extract;
3 cups quick cooking oats (whir regular rolled oats in food processor if you don’t have quick cooking oats); 
½ cup flour.


1 tablespoon butter, softened; 
1 cup confectioners' sugar; 
1/2 cup smooth peanut butter; and
2 ½ tablespoons milk.

For a less crumbly, chewier cookie, I've replaced the butter with margarine and decreased the amount.  I increased the brown sugar and omitted the white sugar. I also increased the amount of oats and omitted the baking powder.  I used a melon baller to scoop batter onto baking sheet to create the perfect size cookie.  :)

HOLY COW ARE THESE GOOD!  One of the best cookies I have ever had.  I am not sure why (maybe handling of butter) but my cookies did not turn out thin like some of the pictures.  Mine puffed up so much that I had to slam them on the counter to deflat them a bit. All of my ingredients were room temp. and I used old fashioned oats (they make a chewier texture) and I used dark brown suger (when gives a little more richness), I also added vanilla extract to both the cookie and the filling.  All of these conditions added up to one of the best cookies I've ever had let alone baked myself.

Everyone loved these. They are different than your ordinary pb cookie. My 2nd batch came out too crispy so next time I will go with 8-9 minutes and chill my dough. I cut down a little bit on the sugars. I didn't have heavy cream so I sub. cream cheese & used less powdered sugar. Delicious! I also only had old fashioned oats but I don't think you can tell the difference.  Thanks for sharing!

These are the BEST!!!  I used a melon baller to scoop the dough- helped make them more uniform in size.  And for cryin' out loud MAKE THE FILLING!!  The cookies are good without it but they're to die for with it!!

These are the BEST! Wow, very tasty. I baked the cookies for 8-9 minutes, which was perfect. They are sooo soft, even the next day. And you don't need to flatten the cookies because they flatten on their own while baking. I used skim milk in the filling instead of heavy cream and it was fine. Next time I will double the recipe and use more filling in each cookie sandwich! The user who said these taste like gourmet Nutter Butters was absolutely correct. Yum!!!

These were awesome! I used a 1/2 oz scoop and they turned out the perfect size.  I doubled the recipe and got about 40 cookie sandwiches.

I made these cookies for the first time on Christmas Eve to have for dessert on Christmas Day with my neighbor. The cookies turned out wonderful and there was plenty of icing to fill the cookies with when they cooled off enough to pat together and refrigerate until dinner time. They make a very large cookie.

Great cookie...My husband and i loved them!!I might try to make the filling a little more creamy next time!   TIP: If your oven rack is in the middle, move it down one. This allows the bottom of the cookie to cook a little more so that when it comes time to frost the cookie, the cookie is more stable and doesn't break apart.

10 TIMES BETTER THAN GIRL SCOUT COOKIES!  I made these over the holidays & they were a HUGE HIT.  We just picked up my daughter's Girl Scout cookies & I opened a box to compare...GS's are dry & hard (blah.)  These are super soft & the cream melts in your mouth.  They are my new favorite cookie & that's saying alot since there is no chocolate in them.  TIP: Use a 1 1/4" mini ice cream scoop to make smaller cookies.  That way when you sandwich them you get more per batch.  Be generous with the filling too!

I thought this recipe was the best! The cookies tasted so good that my husband had them all gone in 2 days. The only thing I would change is to make twice as much the next time so I can have more than 2 of them.

These cookies are delicious and easy to make. The filling is so creamy and good, you could probably eat it by its self. If you want them chewier, bake for only 8-9 min. They are wonderful as is, but do get crunchy, if you like that. Anyway, all around very tasty recipe!!!

OMG,  These are the best pb cookies ever.  I used chunky pb in the cookie batter. I used all natural pb in the filling.  Wow!!  These cookies are great without the filling.  I made them both ways.  The filling is pretty rich, so I would make the cookies small to use the filling.  If not, go for it. Thanks for the recipe Joanne.

This recipe is outstanding!! I cannot pull myself away from them, seriously! Instead of heavy cream, I used skim milk and it is wonderful. I will double the batch the next time I make them because they are just too good.!!

DELICIOUS!  The only change I'd make next time is to make the cookies 1/2 the size recommended.  Making 24 cookies as the recipe says (to make 12 sandwiches) yielded 4 inch cookies.  They are yummy, but so peanut butter rich that more than one at a time is too much, so smaller cookies would allow someone to have 2 and be happy!  Plus, they'll go further!  Chunky PB in the dough was a nice suggestion.  We will DEFINITELY be making these again.

I have been looking for a perfect peanut butter cookie recipe for years, AND THIS IS IT!!! Didn't have to change a thing in the recipe, although I did refrigerate the dough for an hour and used a small ice cream scoop to make perfect size cookies. The second time I made them I dipped them in milk chocolate and couldn't believe how fast they were gone!! This is a must for any cookie jar :) they freeze and travel well to so loved ones far away can enjoy them as well.

JOANNE!!! These are Fantastic. Oh MY ! My husband ooohed and ahhhed and ate 3 (6) at once as soon as they were cooled. The filling is delicious! I fell bad for those who are eating these without the filling. I followed your recipe (with one little change- used 3/4 cup Brown sugar and 1/4 cup white for a chewy cookie). The dough was very sticky so I just spooned it on the cookies sheet and when they came out of the oven they were puffy so I dropped the cookies sheet from about 6" on to the counter top and viola they deflated - perfect cookies. It is so nice to have a totally new cookie recipe in the house. The size of the batch is great too. There is just 2 of us and I got one cookie and my hubby the rest - gone in 48 hours - imagine...he is a cookie monster. Thank you for sharing Joanne.

These cookies are Excellent.  They tasted exactly like the Do-Si-Dos cookies that I sold in Girl Scounts twenty years ago.  I thought they were even better since the cookies were soft.  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception,  I used butter flavored Crisco instead of butter.  Everyone enjoyed them, Thanks Joanne.

DELISH!! Easy to make, even tasty without the cream filling. You may want to double the recipe. They don't make enough! These got eaten as fast as they cooled off.

My husband got a big smile on his face when he tasted these cookies.  He loves Girl Scout peanut butter cookies and he said these were pretty close to the real thing.  He said he knew what he wanted me to make for his next manager's meeting at work.  I made them according to the recipe and the batch made 24 sandwich cookies.  The only difference I did was to smash them down with the side of my hand instead of a fork.  They kept sticking to the fork and not my hand.  Do keep them to a tsp. size, they look small, but they get bigger.  I had very little cream left over.  GREAT!

These could possibly be the best cookies I've ever made. I have some tough critics too, and this is the only cookie I ever get requests for. Amazing recipe, didn't change a thing. Thanks so much *****

I made these for my Belgian host family and added hunks of dark Belgian chocolate left to melt on top---my host brother polished them off in no time! Do pay close attention and check them often, they are deceptively pale when done.

Fantastic! Just to re-iterate what others have said: they will not look done at 10 minutes, but pull them out, let them cool completely on the pan, and they are perfect!!

Delicious!!! 

Pressing them down with the fork isn't really necessary...I just slam the pan down when they come out of the oven. Much easier. :) I doubled the cookie dough and kept the filling single as someone else suggested and it worked out well. 

I'm definitely making these again!

This cookie recipe is easy and SO impressive.  I've made them twice - the second time I threw in a bag (12 oz.) of semi-sweet chocolate chips just to cut the peanut buttery taste of it all, and because chocolate makes everything better.  Wonderful recipe, thank you so much!

These are amazing!  Everyone raved about them and I will definitely be using this recipe over and over!  My only minor gripe is that I would have liked just a little more of the filling, but that's just personal preference and I can adjust on my own.

Oh my goodness these are delicious!  I have never tried the GS cookies but I made them last night and brought them to work and many people say they taste just like them...and the whole batch was wiped out by 8:30 am!  I reduced the sugar in the cookies to 1/3 c. each white and brown sugar because another reviewer remarked that they were a little sweet.  Too late, I realized I had only "old-fashioned" oats rather than "quick cooking" but the texture was great, crispy but chewy.  I didn't even bother pressing them down with a fork...I just used my fingertips to "tamp" down the cookies and give them uniform round edges.  Just about everyone asked for the recipe.  DO make a double-batch. I didn't and wish I had.  Thanks Joanne!  You are a genius!

I decreased the sugars to 1/3 cup each, but otherwise made as directed. They turned out awesome. I was concerned that the filling would be "too much" -- that it would take them from good to over the top (you know, too much of a good thing; sugar, in this case). The filling is really mild and creamy and only slightly sweet and really compliments the sweet cookie. I will make these again; they were a huge hit!

I'm so glad I tried this recipe! I doubled the recipe and used my smallest scoop and ended up with over 3 dozen sandwich cookies.  They are delicious!  My cookies came out nice and round and did not crumble when I layered the filling.  This recipe produces a very nice cookie that is crispy on the outside, but chewy on the inside. The addition of the quick oats makes for a nice texture and flavor. For those having trouble with the cookie spreading too much, it could be because the butter was too soft. For my oven, just under 9 minutes was perfect.  I set my timer for 8 minutes and the kept watch to look for that pretty, golden color.  I made one pan of cookies that I pressed down lightly with my fingers, but I think the cookies that I pressed down using a fork are prettier.  With a big glass of cold milk, this cookie will be a fan-favorite after school snack. Thank you for sharing!

These are amazing.  I use the recipe as posted and add a layer of melted chocolate chips before I put the sandwiches together.  They are great as written, but the extra chocolate layer takes it to a new level!

I doubled the ingredients but NOT the baking powder...and I had to double the filling. THESE were one of the most delicious cookies I have ever eaten..it is an Orgasmic Cookie :-) I also added some vanilla extract to the filling and cookies batter.

Perhaps my expectations were set too high with such rave reviews.  I think these are good, but not incredible.  I made exactly as the recipe calls for...the cookies are a little on the greasy side.  May make again, but I have other cookie recipes I prefer.

these are so good they are deadly. while they take a little longer than the conventional peanut butter cookie... the outcome is absolutely worthwhile. i followed the recipe exactly and the cookies are perfect.

I have already made the batter and frozen it in preparation for the holidays.  Tasting the batter did indeed remind me of the infamous Girl Scout cookies.  My only regret was that I didn't double the recipe.  Can't wait to pop them in the oven.

These cookies are GREAT!  Our 12 year old daughter found this recipe on Allrecipes & made them the same day.  We all enjoyed the excellent results...& added this recipe to our bulging recipe box!  Thanks for a winner!  P.S.  Using the smallest cookie scoop really helped make uniform cookies.

This recipes is great! It is a little time consuming but the dough refrigator's very easily. Perfect for a cookie platter.

AMAZING!  The Girl Scout version has always been my Dad's favorite, but these put the Scouts to shame!  The look on his face said it all...This recipe is a keeper!

DELICIOUS!!!! I will make this over and over again. I took heed to what other reviewers had written, so I doubled the cookie recipe. It was a good idea if you are plan of making the sandwich cookie, otherwise you are fine to use the recipe as is.

I made these just before Christmas for my cookie tins. I didn't love them but that's because I prefer chewy cookies. Though the flavor was great! I took them to my roommate's parent's house and they were the first cookie gone. I'll keep the recipe on hand since it seemed to be a hit.

Wish I could give this one more stars! This is the best peanut butter cookie i've ever had. I followed directions exactly, except adding a little extra peanut butter to both the cookie and the frosting. Maybe 1/2 cup. Sooooo good.

I just made these last night... without the filling. And they're great! they taste good even without filling. :) I will make these again, very soon... So far its the best cookies I had baked! My friends loved the taste, and these are such soft cookies. They easily break though. But still, 5 starts for this recipe!    Thanks so much for this recipe!

OMG! If I could give these 10 plus stars, I would! Holy Cow they are SOOOO good! I love(d) the girl scout cookie version of these but these have surpassed those, ten times over. When I gave one to my husband to try his eyes got all big and he said, "MMMMMM" and kept eating them! I don't think he came up for air until almost all the cookies were gone. LOL. I will be making these often I think ( ;

I wish I could have video-taped my husband taste-testing these!  He turned into a little bug-eyed kid!  So yummy and so rich.  I used Adam's natural peanut butter and everything I kept true to the recipe.

I thought these were pretty good.  They were a little rich and kind of greasy for me.  I agree with some of the other reviewers, it might be better to decrease the butter and increase the peanut butter.  Also, I made them gluten free by using gluten free flour and quinoa flakes instead of oats. My first time using them and they worked great!

Best peanut butter cookie ever. It doesn't make a lot (about 2 dozen small cookies) , so when I make these for work or the family I have to double the recipe. The cookies by themselves is wonderful, but add the icing and they are to die for.

I made the cookies a little smaller and cooked for 8 minutes. Someone else said, they don't look done but they are, remember this advice - it is true. Other than size I changed nothing and it was fantastic! I can not wait to make these again and again.

The ultimate cookie.  Just don't look up the fat and calorie count.  These were a little work intensive but worth it.  The ship well.  Mailed them to Ohio, got there still moist and yummy.

Very nice. I'm only giving it 4 stars because it was INCREDIBLY sweet and too rich for my tastes. I will definately make these again, but next time I'll use less butter and sugar and probably not make the filling

I doubled the recipe and used half crunchy and half creamy "natural" peanut butter.  Not sure why several reviews said they were greasy, mine weren't at all.  I think they are even better the next day.  This recipe is a keeper.

It's a very good recipe however all that butter makes it way to grease so I cut it down to half and they turned out beautiful.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used cream cheese like another reviewer suggested and they came out wonderful.

My family really enjoyed these cookies.  I did not have heavy cream and used Fat-Free Milk and the filling was delicious.  I'm sure it would be even more decadent with the cream.  Loved it and will definitely make again.

These cookies are absolutely amazing...I've been making them for two years in a row during the holiday season...I always make a batch for my grandmother (a diehard PB lover) and give them to her in Christmas tin containers.  But I do tend to make the cookies themselves larger than the recipe suggests to make more decadent "sandwiches."

This was really good! Although I thought the sandwich cookie was a bit too much! My husband and I enjoyed the cookies just as they are out of the oven, there was no need to do anything else to them.

Pretty good. Definitely do not make the cookies larger than a teaspoon. They will expand in the oven and once you sandwich them, anything bigger would be overwhelming. Also, whipping cream is unnecessary. I used just over 2 Tbsp milk to get the consistency I wanted.

Lovely cookies! I made them just as the recipe called and they were a hit. You don't even know that the oatmeal is in there! Make sure that the cookies are soft, not crispy - they taste much, much better that way in the sandwiches.

These cookies are exceptional! I would not change a thing about this recipe, although I did double the batch and they still came out perfectly. When I bake I always share my goodies with family and friends and they could not believe how awesome these cookies were. I will definitely be making these cookies often. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe Joanne.

This was a recipe I tried during a summer kids Cookie Making Party.  Super delicious!  I did follow advice and double the cookie recipe (not the filling) and still had too much filling, and I did pipe on the filling so as to not break the cookies.  Cookies are soft & just got better as a sandwich! These were a big hit & I will keep this recipe, no doubt about it!

Very Sweet - Which can be a good thing.  Followed directions exactly for the cookie and they were too flat; they tasted like a pb praline - added 1/4 cup more oats and they turned out much better (will probably increase flour next time also, to get a thicker Girl Scout type cookie).  The filling is questionable as written in my opinion - made some cookies on Friday evening and then made more today  (Sunday) - we ate several of the ones from Friday plain and then I filled all of them today using the following recipe: 3 tbls. marg. 1/3 cup peanut butter, 1 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar and 1 tbls. cream.  Not sure how the original recipe would work because of all the pb and cream - mine would have run off the cookies.  
My family didn't think the filling added that much flavor to the cookie.

Wonderful cookies.  I used old fashioned oats because I didn't have any quick oats on hand.  They turned out very tasty!

SO GOOD, with, and without the filling.  Definitely double the cookie part- you'll want way more of these!

OMG these were wonderful!!!!  I doubled the recipe which made 44 sandwiched cookies. Unsandwiched as just a regular cookie, I give this 5 stars... sandwich these together as the recipe suggests and I would love to give these 10 stars BUT dip these in chocolate as another review suggested and these were way off the charts good!!!!

Canada doesn't get different types of Girl Guide cookies but I wish we got these. Really great, although I would have liked a stronger Peanut flavor. We didn't add the filling ~ Kids wouldn't stop eating them just the way they are. I did make a batch with Bittersweet chips just to off set the sweet. Excellent!!

Delicious cookies!  I have made a couple times, once using leftover icing from a cinnamon roll recipe (Clone of a Cinnabon), as I didn't have any cream, and tonight just frosting with 1/2 cup PB, a few dashes milk, and some powdered sugar (didn't use butter).  Thank you!  My boyfriend and I love them.

I can't believe how easy and amazing these cookies are.  They taste soooo much better than the Girl Scout peanut butter sandwich cookies do.   They even taste great straight from the freezer.....  I did add about 1/8 c. more of peanut butter in the dough portion.  It still turned out great.  No problems there.  I also used half and half for I didn't have whipping cream.

Excellent! I took another reviewer's advice about piping the filling onto the cookie. It worked perfectly. Not one broken cookie. I will make these often!

These are seriously to die for, no joke.  I made them exactly as-is (though I halved the whole recipe) and they turned out wonderfully.  There was a lot of leftover filling, though.  We just ate that with gingersnaps instead though, so it was ok, haha.  
When you have them on the pan, spray a fork with kitchen spray then press a checkered pattern into the cookies.  Also, to fill them just put the filling in a ziploc, cut a hole in the end, and squeeze it on then press with another cookie.  Then you won't get breakage from the knife!  If your cookies turned out too hard, you can just keep them sealed in a tupperware container and the frosting moisture will soften them. Otherwise, I wouldn't seal them airtight or they might get too wet.  I LOVED these and they were gone so quickly- then my brothers were complaining that they didn't get to eat enough of them!

As someone else suggested, I made these without their filling.  I also added chocolate chips.  These make fantastic peanut butter/chocolate chip/oatmeal cookies when you can't decide what kind to make.

These are the best peanut butter cookie I've ever made.  Actually, I didn't make them with peanut butter; instead, I used fresh honey roasted cashew butter that I got for Christmas, and they were AMAZING.  I didn't bother filling them; the cookies alone are outstanding.  I served them at a Super Bowl party and everyone raved.  Will definitely make them again using peanut butter and other types of nut butters.

These cookies are fabulous! I definitely will be making these for my next potluck!  I did not think the filling was too sweet at all and had no problem slathering it on nice and thick ;)  I baked them on the lighter side (about 9 min or so) so they stayed nice and soft.  These won't last long in my house! Thanks!!!!!

I made it exactly how the recipie said with one exception. I used old fashion oats as some reviewers mentioned it would leave the cookie more chewy. I did not make them into sandwhiches, but did add chocolate chips to the top before baking. I did chill the batter before putting it on pans and pressed with a fork. I can't stop eating them!! They are great.

It's as good as they say it is people. A flawless recipe. I used large flake oats instead of quick cooking because that's all I had, otherwise I made these as is. Fantastic. Do be sure to chill the dough before scooping it using a small melon baller. Flatten the dough before baking. And don't overcook, they burn quickly. Nine minutes was perfect in my oven. THANK YOU Joanne!

These are FANTASTIC! I made the recipe exactly as written. I whipped the filling mixture with my beater for about 2 minutes to make it light and fluffy. I also dipped half of my batch in home made chocolate ganache. So much for the New Year's diet!

Oh.My.Goodness. These are amazing!!! I had to quadruple the recipe the second time I made them for our group of friends on football Sunday. They were gone before I could even have one. I followed the recipe exactly. If you love peanut butter, this cookie is a must!

Perfect! I love these cookies. Made them just as cookies without the filling, and they were just as I would have wanted them to be. (I had a hard time making them, because I couldn't stop eating the dough.... LOL).

This is a great recipe however lacked 3 ingredients: baking powder, brown sugar and smooth peanut butter.  I exempted the baking powder and brown sugar all together and substituted 1 cup of peanut butter morsels in place of the 1/2 cup of peanut butter.  I'll definately be making these again!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Added chocolate chips--great as just a cookie without the filling, but also good with the filling.  They will flatten out quite a bit and are rather large for sandwich cookies, so keep them small and/or refrigerate dough.

FanTAStic!  The dough was too sticky to flatten, but it didn't matter - they spread perfectly.  I added slightly more cream to the frosting to make it little thinner and creamer.  This made way more than 12 servings - we made 24 sandwiches, and they're too sweet to have more than 1 at a time.  I even thought they could have been smaller.  But I *loved* them and will make them again!

I have made a LOT of dessert recipes on this site & this cookie, by far is the winner, so far.  My picky 24 yr old son loves them.  I sent my daughter's fiance home with 4 of them just to try out & he ate 2 on the way home, TRIED to hide them from my daughter, let her have one (in his defense she's dieting) & then begged for more.  I sent over 6 more & today he asked for more.  My husband says their so good I could sell them.  wow.  I never expected all that.  The only subs I made were 2: I used crunchy pb for the cookie part & I didn't have any heavy whipping cream so I used half-n-half.  They are extremely sweet but that doesn't seem to stop anyone from eating them!  I frankly don't think they taste anything like the Girl Scout version.  Their cookie is crunchy & the filling is firmer.  I like this version better; the cookie stays soft & the filling is a little creamier.  I store mine in a Tupperware container in the fridge.  It's just a personal preference; we all seem to like them better that way.  I made mine with a small scoop (one bigger than a melon baller) & I like that size.  They sort of remind me of the Little Debbie Oatmeal Cream Pies as far as size & texture of cookie & filling - again but way better!  Some one has asked me to try making them & then dipping them in a chocolate coating.  I may just try that on a few & see if my victims don't die of a sugar overdose!  I will be making these again this weekend, by popular demand.  Thanks Joanne!

My family loved these and have been asking for more since the first time I made them. My mission for today is to satisfy their craving! I used the recipe as written.

I followed recipe exactly.  We love peanut butter cookies and with the reviews I was excited to give this one a try.  Unfortunately this was not one of our favorites, the cookies turned out hard and the consistency when placing them on the pan was like whipped cream.  I'm still looking for that perfect soft, moist and very peanuty flavor peanut butter cookie.

Wow...I'm impressed.  I made these on a whim for a birthday gathering tomorrow nite.  I just knew they would be too peanut buttery, but they're truly decedant and you can taste the heavy cream in them.  Very good.  I went by the recipe except for using DARK BROWN SUGAR only b/c that's all I had.  They turned out great though!  I eyeballed it and came out with 26 cookes making 13 sandwiches and they're the a regualar choc chip cookie size.

These are ridiculously good. I'm not a huge fan of do-si-dos, but these are even better and I couldn't stop eating them until I'd reached 13 and was starting to feel sick. I found that if I actually measured the dough by teaspoonfuls, this recipe made 60 sandwich cookies, which equals 80 calories each.

I doubled the recipe, I knew these would go fast! I also didn't like the consistency of the frosting in the middle, so I added twice as much heavy whipping cream. It was much easier to spread and nice and fluffy. Be sure to use a teaspoon to make the balls, I used a tablespoon and they spread way too big.

These are some of the best cookies I have ever had! I used 3\4 cup crunchy peanut butter in the cookies, and creamy in the icing. Mine turned out soft and wonderfully chewy, and they kind of remind me of oatmeal cream pies, but made with peanut butter. Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!

Made them for the first time; they were delicious!  I made my cookies way too big, my husband complained they were too high to eat in one bite.  Next time I will make them smaller and flatter.  The icing is a really nice touch!!

These cookies are incredible!  I used crunchy peanut butter in the actual cookie dough and then creamy for the filling.  I love to make sandwich cookies-these are a definite keeper in my recipe collection!  Try these-you will be very pleased with the results.

As always, I used whole wheat flour.  I also reduced butter in the cookies to about 5 T and sugar to about 3/4c. brown (no white).  My peanut butter was natural (with salt, without sugar).  I suggest making the cookies very small and very thin.  I felt like I was doing that, but they puffed up some when baked and were just in general too big.  Eating one sandwich seemed a bit overwhelming.  I made the suggested amount of filling but didn't use it all.  I don't think 1/2 a recipe would've been enough though.

I doubled the batch, but took another reviewer's advice and did not double the filling.  The filling is very sweet and we actually ended up liking the cookies better with no filling.  They do taste quite a bit like the ones the Girl Scouts sell.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I can't believe how good these are! I followed the recipe exactly except for using a little extra peanut butter in the batter and the filling (we love PB in this house!).  I think the amount of filling was perfect as written.  They are definitely best the 1st day.  By day 3 they were a little dry.  I don't know how anyone could pass these up.  Fantastic!!

I thought that these were really good. Made as directed and 9 minutes was perfect, still soft and finished setting up on the cookie sheet. I also add some chopped up dark chocolate and that was nice. I didn't make the filling. Delicious and different as is.

I have been looking at this recipe for awhile, but always thought it was going to be a difficult and time consuming process.  I was so wrong.  Making the cookies was quick and painless, and the filling is the perfect spreading consistency, so it went on very easily.  The hardest part is making sure all of the cookies are similar shapes and sizes to make them look nice after they are filled.  Using a cookie scoop to make uniform cookies is ideal for this recipe.  The peanut butter lovers in this house all loved these cookies!

Super easy ! I baked them for 8 minutes in my convection oven which was perfect! excellent with a glass of milk. Only thing i changed was I cut the confectioner's sugar in the filling by a 1/4 because I was using Peter Pan's honey flavored peanut butter  and was afraid it would turn out too sweet. Great recipe, Thanks Joanne!

These cookies turned out great!  I followed most of the suggestions by reviewer Sarah (especially to decrease the butter & increase the oats a lot) and also decreased the sugar a little and the cookies were very good.  The addition of the peanut butter filling makes them stand out.  I made a double batch of cookies with a single amount of filling.

I thought this was a fantastic recipe. The only thing I did differently with really great results was to grind the oats into a flour using the food processor.  The best cookie ever!!!!

I won't address the girl scout cookie comparison as I've never had the original. I made the cookie as written. The dough was very difficult to flatten as it was soft and sticky. But to get a good thickness and shape suitable for making a 'sandwich', you really need to flatten them. The ones I gave up on did not spread out and flatten on their own. The cookies were rich and a bit on the greasy side, stayed soft even after cooling and had great peanut butter flavor. I would reduce the butter, but by how much I am unsure of. As to the filling, many reviewers mentioned the excessive sweetness of it, so I reduced the sugar by half. I also used only 1 tbsp of milk rather than the full amount of cream. It was plenty sweet and rich and when paired with two of the cookies, the whole combination was excessive. Also good to keep in mind is the recipe yield, which is two dozen,  but when the sandwiches are made, you end up with one dozen. I will make the cookies themselves again with reduced butter, but the entire package is overkill in my opinion.

I absolutely loved these cookies.  If i could I would give it 6 stars.  The only thing I did differently was add chocolate chips.  Who doesn't like the classic combo of PB and chocolate.  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe.

this recipe has so many reviews! I was a bit nervous. I made as written and they are tasty. Some people complained it did not make much. I have 7 people in my house and found you could not eat more than 1 or 2 at a time. It is a good recipe. I loved the filling and was thinking up ways to make it work for cake frosting or cup cakes. I will make again. I used a melon baller to put my on the cookie sheet  and then pressed lightly with a fork to flatten.

I made these because these are my husband's favorite cookies when girl scout cookie time comes around.  Well I have to say that I won't have to order them ever again, because these are even better.  My husband absolutely loved these, as did my little guy.  They were quite easy and tasted wonderful.  Thanks for the awesome recipe that will be used in my house often!

A little dry when baked in my toaster oven.  I will try my gas oven next time.  Super easy and yummy though.

These cookies are evil.  I made these according to the directions listed.  The only change I made was to skip the frosting.  These cookies are perfect without added sweetness.  I just took my last batch out of the oven as I type this, and I'm going to make another batch right away because I know once my husband walks through the door and smells these, they won't last long.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Freaking awesome cookie. I made the first batch of cookies and saw that it didn't make a whole lot, so I turned right around and made another. I used chunky peanut butter and ground down the oats in my blender before adding it to the cookie dough. I think I might have added a little too much peanut butter to the second batch because those cookies spread a little more and were a little bigger. It didn't affect the quality, though. I had no problem with too much frosting but I did make the filling inside each sandwich cookie a little thick. I only needed 2 tbsp. cream in the filling. I think if I make these again(and I will make these again), I might add a 1/4 c. of chopped roasted peanuts to the filling.

I am not overly thrilled with these cookies despite the rave reviews...the filling made way too much and was too rich...the cookies themselves were just "okay" as they were way too greasy --- I would suggest halving the butter to 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup as the peanut butter adds alot of grease to the recipe...sorry but only 3 stars for this one

OMGosh!! Delicous!!! 5 Stars !!!!!Made a mistake when mixing ingredients, maybe that is why I had more than enough cookies to make approx 26 paired.  Great mistake though.  When I quick wrote the directions, I wrote to combine the sugars and realized that confectioners' sugar was not in the batter so I added 1 cup to the creamed mixture.  I realized a little too late, but baked them anyway.  Used a heaping 1/2 tblsp to drop on baking sheet then forked pressed. Did use the confectioners' sugar again in the filling as required.  JR should be the next Girl Scout Keebler if they had one.  Thanks. !!!!!!!!!!

These are so amazing its impossible to tell you!  I was short on cash for father's day last year so I made my dad a couple dozen of these - i am now on strict orders to do the same thing every year.  Wonderful wonderful recipe.  I halve the filling recipe for one batch, or leave it as is and double the cookie recipe.

These cookies are fabulous! As a former Girl Scout, I'm excited to find a very similar homemade replica of do-si-dos, but this version is MUCH better! I substituted in Splenda, used skim milk instead of cream and plan to forgo butter in the filling next time... it IS called peanut BUTTER, right?

Made these this afternoon for my hubby (who LOVES peanut butter).  My daughter ate one and loved it.  I had extra filling and she wanted to just sit and eat the filling - so it must have been really good!  My hubby ate 1 and said they were really sweet - but he liked them.

By far the best peanut butter cookie I have ever made.  Whoever said you don't get many out of this recipe must have made huge cookies because I doubled it based on that review and got 115 cookies about the size of an oreo.  I made as directed only I added a bit of vanilla to the cookie batter and a bit to the filling.  I also had to use a bit more whipping cream in the filling than instructed to get a better consistency.  Small cookies on a darker pan took 7 mins exactly to bake.  Don't skip the filling, you will be sorry.  But like another reviewer said, you don't need to double the filling if doubling the batter recipe, it makes a lot.  And a thin layer is perfect.  I will be making these for Christmas but will be dipping them in chocolate.  Thanks so much Joanne!

These were phemonemal! I got 22 good-sized cookies out of the recipe. I used grind-your-own-peanuts peanut butter, so it did not add any wxtra sugar or salt to the cookie; I added about an extra teaspoon of sugar to the cookie dough but didn't change the filling at all. I think it was perfect! Any sweeter and it would have been too much - it tasted just like a nutter butter! The not-so-smooth fresh ground peanuts didn't have any negative effects on the texture of the cookies at all. I will absolutely be making these again!

Amazing flavor and texture... I chose to not flatten the cookies and only backed for 9 minutes and had an instant hit at our household even without the cream filling.  Thanks!

These were good.  I didn't make them with the filling though.  Reduced the sugar like others had suggested too.

I followed this recipe exactly. Tasted GREAT. Some of mine were baked a couple minutes longer than others - family differed in which they liked better, crispy or soft. I used my regular cookie scoop, but dropped onto a plate & cut in half before rolling & putting on baking sheet. Nice size - more like the promised girl scout cookies.  Um... I also had no cream on hand, so I used my hazelnut coffee creamer in the icing. I didn't taste 'the other nut', but it sure was good. Made more frosting than necessary as another reviewer stated. We still put a dent in the leftover icing by just snitching fingertipfulls.

This is an awesome recipe! The only changes I made was to substitute maple flavoring for vanilla, and up the peanut butter in the cookies to 3/4 cup.  I made little balls and flattened them really flat with my fingers, then cooked them 8 minutes.. they came out crispy/chewy.. didn't add the filling this time and they were still great!

These were pretty good.  I was hoping for a bit more peanut buttery flavor.  I am not a big fan of the whole wheat flavor, so I bet that's why I didn't care for these much

I've been making these now for a couple years. This very recipe. I bake them for us here at the house and I also have to bake them for my husbands work. They love them there. They are very tasty and well worth the time it takes to make them. Easy to follow recipe. so yummy.

Dipped in melted chocolate the first time, and it was almost too much of a sweet cookie!  Since then, I've made again but I just make the cookie recipe without the icing and undipped. Delicious!

I made these cookies for a cookie exchange because of the review that said they are so close to the girl scout cookie...  These cookies are to die for and not safe to keep in the house!  They are better than ate girl scout cookie because the cookie is soft!  Enjoy!

I recently made these for my Grandma's 80th birthday; they vanished quickly and people loved them!  One change: I omitted the white sugar from the cookies based on the comments they were too sweet.  I also doubled the cookie recipe (not the frosting part) and had just enough frosting.  Perfect!!!

I wanted to love these based on the reviews. I found them way too large-definitely make oreo sized. But while I'm a huge peanut butter fan, the filling was too sweet and the recipe made too much for the cookies. The flavor was delicious but recipe needs tweaking.

These were WONDERFUL. My father, who is a dedicated health nut, devoured these. I would call them Nutter Butter clones because they tasted just like them but much better. I used almond milk instead of heavy whipping cream in the filling and it turned out fine. Highly recommend this recipe.

YUMMY! Very simple to make with delicious results. The dough was too sticky to roll, so I did have to add about an extra 1/2 cup of flour, but that was my only change. I got 23 sandwich cookies out of this. My oven is super hot, so they cooked in only 6 minutes. The family really enjoyed these and I will definately be making them again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Perfect cookies! Perfect texture, perfect flavor. They are veeerrry sweet though. 

I didn't have any whipping cream, so I used 2 tbsp. vanilla yogurt. It added a delicious, rich, almost sourish twist to it! Very good.

these cookies are superb!  i would double the recipe because they're a bit of a pain to make and they only yield about 15 sandwiches at the end of it all :) i don't think these taste much like the girl scout cookies as the description states because these cookies are soft, but in any case they're delicious!!

Delicious! I'm a big fan of peanut butter and oats so having peanut butter cookies AND peanut butter filling was a treat. Instead of all purpose flour I used wheat but other than that these are delicious!!!

These are the best!!!  I followed the recipe to the T and they came out perfect.  I baked mine for 9 minutes.  I took the advice of a member here and dipped some in chocolate.  I can't say which I like better because they both rocked!  Thank you for submitting this recipe!

FANTASTIC COOKIE. I made the cookies and didn't use the filling--even though I am sure it is delicious, I just thought the cookies were stand out all on their own.
Thanks for submitting this recipe.

One of my favorite cookies!  The fudge-like filling is great, but the cookie itself dries out quickly, so eat the fast (you'll have no problem with this!)

I ground the oatmeal in my food processor for 10 seconds, used whole wheat flour for the AP, used a 1 tbsp scoop got 37 cookies or 18 sandwiches, use 1/2 tbsp scoop next time, 12 minutes was perfect on silpat lined sheets. Reminded me of Pirate cookies from Mr Christie, very good!

Great classic recipe. I suggust making the cookies very small. If you make them regular size, it becomes alot to eat (since it really is 2 cookies, and icing in each serving) I also had frosting left over.

Instead of quick oats, I ran a knife through old fashioned oats. No other substitutions otherwise. Baked for ten minutes. Delicious frozen!

9.24.11

My next door neighbor mentioned that she loved these cookies so I made her another batch for her birthday. Made few substitutions this time: used all natural peanut butter (all I had on hand), upped the salt, ground up half the quick oats in my coffee grinder (to create a finer textured cookie) and divided each dough ball made by my cookie scoop in half. Perfect size for sandwiches! Baked at nine minutes.

I'm a true peanut butter lover. Peanut butter pie, cookies, candy, or right out of the jar. I had such high hopes for these cookies. They smelled wonderful as they baked and came out just perfect, yet I must give this recipe a very low score. These cookies are just sickeningly sweet. So sweet I could not get through one without going to the sink for a glass of water to wash it down.

Delicious!  I scaled back to 1/3 cup each white and brown sugars but not in the filling.  Very easy to make.  Was skeptical about filling thinking it was too much work but it really wasn't, look less than 3 minutes!  I used the only cookie scoop I had and they turned out fine.

These cookies are delicious! The filling is excellent!!!! 
I made these again today. I doubled the recipe and got 37 cookies. I baked them for 20 minutes. Also, I didn't have brown sugar, so I just doubed the white sugar. Yummy!

These are very yummy cookies & hard to stop at just one,  I did make a little adjustment & add 1 cup of flour instead of the 3/4 cup & added 2 tsp of vanilla, and also added vanilla to the icing as well.

I made these exactly like the recipe and they turned out great. I was worried about having enough filling, but I ended up with some left over, so don't skimp when you fill the cookies. I took these to the office, and they were gone before lunch!

Oh my word! These are my family's new favorite cookie. They were completely gone in less that 24 hours! I did not make any changes to the recipe, but I did skip the "press down dough with a fork" part. They turned out great. I have already made them twice in less than two weeks!!!

These came out really good (after the experiment that was the first pan ;) ).  I followed some reviewers suggestions and doubled the cookie recipe (while only making the single recipe of filling).  They came out really good and everyone loved them.  I will definitely make them again.

My sons and hubby loved this recipe. I quadrupled the recipe because I needed cookies to give away and these were great. I did not do the filling and just baked individual cookies. I didn't have time to bake them all the first day so I refrigerated my batter for a couple days in a sealed container and the second refrigerated batch came out better than the first which was a bit too runny. I also added chocolate kisses to some and chocolate chips to some as other reviewers had and they were delicious. A new family favorite.

We made this without the filling and they are delicious!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion to take them out of the oven at exactly 10 minutes, even if they don't look done, and am glad I did.  They are chewy and moist, which is just what I wanted.  Yum!

So sweet and delicious! I only made two slight changes. In the filling I only used 3/4 C powdered sugar and to achieve a puffier cookie I made 1 tsp balls of dough and then holding the ball with both of your hands, twist the dough left hand towards yourself and right hand away from yourself and pull the dough apart. Stick the two halves back together with the jagged sides face up.

If I could give it more stars I would.  Here's what I did:  I doubled the cookie recipe but not the filling.  I dropped TEASPOON fulls onto the cookie sheet, which seemed tiny at the time but turned out perfect.  Then, with a fork, I mashed them down pretty flat.  Next time I might try the bottom of a glass.  Be sure to dip the fork into water every now and then to keep it from sticking to the cookie dough.  I baked them for 7 minutes, until the edges were golden brown.  When I removed them from the oven they were sort of puffy but as they cool they flatten back out again.  Wait a minute or so to remove them from the cookie sheet or they will break apart.  Let them cool on a wire rack before adding the filling.  These made 6 dozen single cookies, and 3 dozen sandwich cookies.  The kids scarfed them down!  In my opinion they are even better than the Girl Scout peanut butter sandwich cookies!

EGADS SWEET! These are great cookies but yikes! They're almost too sweet.  I had to down a cup of milk for every cookie I ate ... was full after 3 lol.  I made exactly as directed and had no problems whatsoever with them falling apart, crumbling, etc.  Baked for exactly 9" in my oven - let cool for 4 minutes, then filled.  When submitter says use *1 teaspoon* she means exactly that or they're simply too big.  I used *level* teaspoon (I know it looks terribly small), but they spread out beautifully.

Delicious cookie.  I doubled the recipe, used a "cookie scoop" and baked for 14 minutes.  I did not make the cream filling and ended up with just over 4 dozen individual cookies.

We did not have the cream to make the filling so we used the recipe and added sprinkled brown sugar to the top of the cookies. We found that the second batch came out fluffier when we did not press the cookies down with a fork. Also, the cookies do expand quite a bit whether you push them down or not. The recipe was delicious!! We loved these cookies :)

YUM! Double the recipe, for sure. Also use the smallest scoop possible because they are very rich when you figure that it's really two cookies and decadent frosting in each bite. So, so tasty. The frosting is perfect, spot-on just like the Girl Scout cookies, but the cookies themselves are softer. I personally prefer these! They are more like a hybrid of oatmeal cream pies and the GS cookies. Wonderful, perfect, will make them again!

I made these as a stand alone cookie without the filling. I modified the recipe by substituting old fashioned oats. They are chewy and delicious! I will definitely make these cookies often! Super quick and easy recipe!

Delicious! I almost used all of the recommend amount for the filling, so if double recipe double the filling. I used my confection oven and baked them for about 8-9minutes. These were delicious and even doubling the recipe needed to make more!

Wonderful! If you skip the filling and place a Hershey's kiss in the center of them, they make the BEST oatmeal peanut butter blossoms. I'm making a batch for my whole office, and I'm definitely keeping this recipe!

These were great just as cookies or filled. They were EXCELLENT! We love...LOVE nutter butters and these had the same great flavor. Next time we might try making them a little crisper just to experiment but the crisp/chewy texture was delicious as is. We also tried dipping them part way in semi sweet chocolate for a holiday plate but we preferred them without the chocolate. Maybe a milk chocolate might be better but I think we definitely prefer them peanut buttery all the way. We did use chunky pnut butter for the cookie part and creamy for the filling.

I halved the amount of filling & it was fine. Used milk instead of heavy whipping cream. Baked for exactly 10 minutes & waited 5-6 minutes after taking them out of the oven before removing from cookie sheet onto cooling rack. I got 32 individual cookies out of it, 16 once I made them sandwich cookies. DELICIOUS! =) Thank you!

I agree wholeheartedly with the description of these delectable cookies! Since my husband and I simply can't eat the whole batch, we gave most of them to my family, and saved some for family who came over.  My mom couldn't believe these weren't Girl Scout's! I didn't use all of the creamy mixture inside because of preference, so I still have a bit left in the freezer for the next batch.

Very Good!! I didn't make mine into sandwiches...just put the frosting on the individual cookie. I also made my cookies small...which gave me about 36 little cookies. Definitely a keeper!!

I made these exactly as the recipe calls for and they came out fantastically!  Mine made 41 cookies (for 20 sandwiches) and there was plenty of filling for all of them (none left over, but they were all pretty full).  I found that 8-9 minutes was about perfect; I left my first tray in for the full 10 and they came out a bit dark on the bottoms.  These will definitely be our peanut butter cookie of choice!

These are PERFECT as the recipe is originally stated.  I made a triple batch x 2 for a large event.  I made one triple batch of icing and had plenty.  I think the problem some people are having is you are making the cookies too big.  I used a small cookie scoop, then divided that in two and rolled them into balls.  I put back in refrigerator then flattened with the bottom of a floured glass.  PERFECT.  I baked in commercial convection oven at 325 for 6 1/2 minutes.  The final product came out about the same size as an Oreo cookie.  Perfect texture, perfect taste.

these were NOT good! i bake a lot because i am trying to collect recipes for a bakery im going to open, and I would say im pretty experienced. i followed this recipe exactly like it said, and the cookies were NOT good, and i am no picky eater. the filling was good, very good actually, but the cookies themselves were not good. they tasted like cardboard and left a gross aftertaste. not only was the cookie gross, they were all different sizes despite me using a cookie scoop. i will NEVER make these again, and i dont recommend anyone else either.

love!! everyone I share these with ask me for the recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and it made around 50 cookies! And, an added touch was that I dipped them in chocolate... and they are so cute to look at too. tastes like a homemade nutter butter with chocolate-cant get much better than that :)

*needs a few tweaks* The flavor of these cookies is delicious. I wouldn't change a thing when it comes to the filling (although I may try spreading some nutella also next time), however, the actual cookies are very dry and crumbly. If they were a bit chewier they would be perfect.I would add a tablespoon of the cream to the dough and certainly use margarine or shortening over butter. When it comes to scooping the cookie dough onto the baking sheet, I used a medium sized ice cream scoop for uniform size and the bottom of my measuring cup to gently press the dough down to make a perfect and uniform shaped circle. The cookie will stay about the same size after cooked so don't worry about that when you're pressing them. About 10/11 minutes in the oven was pretty accurate for me. Made 11 cookies (2 per sandwich).

These turn adults into happy little children.  I made these yesterday, as a practice run for a fun project for my 5 year old niece and I, and OH BROTHER, are these fantastic.  I am not even a cookie person. I am going to try a few dipped in chocolate.  How can that be bad? LOL

I'm not a peanut butter fan at all, but I made these for my family and they devoured them!  I made another batch this week and used heaping 1/4 tsp for each cookie and they came out about an inch diameter.  A great 1-2 bite snack.  They always get loads of complements from absolutely everyone who eats them.

If you're the type of person (like me) who would pass up a p.b. cookie any day for a chocolate chip one, this  might not be the recipe for you. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with these cookies, they taste "okay". But I honestly don't get what all the hype is about. I made them exactly as written, they were easy to make. It's just... I didn't think anything was special about these cookies. They're really way too sweet and if you're like me and LOVE chocolate over p.b., move on from this recipe. There really isn't anything outstanding about these, in my humble opinion. I actually ended up throwing most of them away. Even my 4 year old didn't like them.

Made these for a cousins bridal shower, they were a hit. I used a half tablespoon to measure the cookie dough and flatened slightly, I found that to be a perfect size. And it made three dozen sandwich cookies! To make them a little more bridal shower-y I dipped half in melted semisweet chocolate and put sprinkles on them. A wonderful cookie.

The rich peanut butter of the cookies melts into the softer, subtle sweetness of the peanut butter cream filling. So good! Even better the next day. I'm not a peanut butter cookie fan. I made them for my husband, but I probably ate more than he did! Yum!

I wish there was a 4 1/2 star rating option. 
This is a very tasty recipe, however the filling could be a little better. Perhaps I'll try a chocolate frosting next time, or none at all. *The cookies are very good without the icing.*
After a couple of days the cookies get rather crumbly, but still taste good.

These are sooooooo good!  Very easy to make, and the only thing I changed was I added some chopped walnuts to the batter.  One suggestion I would make, because they are on the sweet side, is if you make them with the filling make them small, if you make them without the filling make them big.  I am also going to try and use these to make ice cream sandwiches!

I replaced 1/4 cup of the white flour with whole wheat flour and used 2% milk and a little extra butter instead of the heavy whipping cream.  I also let my toddler put 3 peanut butter M&Ms in each cookie before baking.  They came out delicious!  Mine were not as thin as in the photo (or as small)...I made them the size of your standard cookie and they are definitely rich.  I stuck them in the freezer for the nights when my husband is craving something sweet while he's watching his sports games on TV.  :)

I made these last night and they were delicious! They really do taste like the Girl Scout cookies. I took the advice of Chef Joy and doubled the recipe for the cookies, but did not double the cream filling recipe.  Next time I will increase the cream filling recipe by half, as I fell a little short in having enough for a handful of cookies. This may have been due to being a little too generous with the cream filling on my part. If you only have enough ingredients for a single batch of cream if making a double batch of cookies, you'll do fine.  The only changes I made with the ingredients were that I used Splenda sugars versus regular sugars.  When tasting the first one, I thought it needed to be a tad bit sweeter, so I sprinkled a little pure white sugar into the cream. Perfect.  Be sure to let the cookies cool a little before putting together.  I may also scoop these out using my tablespoon versus teaspoon.  These cookies are a definately one for the recipe box!

It has been so long since I tasted the Girl Scout cookie, however, what I do know is this is one terrific cookie.  Made these for Christmas and I must say they were my favorite cookie this year!  What's great is that they don't crumble.  I actually shipped them wrapped in a care package to my nephew stationed in France and they made it in one piece!   The filling is so tasty.  I made the cookie with the crunchy PB and filling with the creamy.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent recipe.  Easy to do and make. Made these and sent to family that is serving in Afghanistan.  We seal a mealed and sent.  The cookies arrived and was shared with other service personnel and everyone loved them.  So thumbs up to this recipe.  We did exactly as recipe called for

I doubled this recipe when I realized how many cookies I had my first thought was OH NO!!, we will never eat these.  They were gone in two days.  They are similar to the girl scout cookies but much tastier. The only complaint I have is I might need to send my husband to a fat farm. LOL

These were moist, soft, and delicious.  The recipe makes too much filling, so next time I'll reduce it to maybe 3/4 the amount.  The filling is also really rich, so it would probably be good to add less butter and some spices like cinnamon.  Otherwise, these are as good as they look! :)

These cookies were a hit! They reminded me of the peanut butter sandwich cookies that Girl Scouts sell, but even better. I suggest doubling the recipe because these cookies disappear quickly.

OMG. The best. I made per directions, but my filling a little too soft, don't know if it was me or the recipe. Don't care - tasted fabulous! I'll just try to reduce the milk next time - oh I swapped milk for cream because I didn't have any cream. Maybe that was why. No matter, did I say it tasted awesome? Just have to play with consistency. Thank you and my kids thank you!!!  p.s. I made two trays at the same time, so of course swapping mid-cook so they would bake evenly. I baked for a total of 13 minutes, and they still looked not done - but they were. So don't let that throw you.

OH MY GOSH!  These are so amazing!  I left this recipe as is, but doubled it (shouldn't have it made so many), due to what one member had. Made 2 big tupperware containers full!  Taking these to a dinner for dessert tonight and I hope they are all gone when I come home.  Very rich, and full of fat...I can't eat them all. :-)  Yummy!

Made only the cookies, but they were great :) I didn't add the oats (ran out) and also refrigerated the mix for a day so it was easier to work with. Next time I'll try these with the filling, but they were pretty sweet as is!

These were great! I loved the filling and the oatmeal was a great addition to a typical peanut butter cookie. Will make again and again!

made these without the filling. they don't flatten out much in the oven so remember to flatten the dough with a fork before u pop it in the oven!    baked mine for 8min. top rack perfectly golden brown on the edges, took these out first to cool and switched the bottom rack to the top to cook for another minute (this made them golden round the edges too!).    not too sweet. just the right amount of chewiness with the oats and not overly heavy with just the right amount of pb! thanks for this recipe!

These were so so. They smelled great when baking, but came out flat and too buttery tasting. The flatness may have been because i overmixed the butter/peanut butter/sugar/vanilla mixture though. Anyhow, i am willing to try this again.

these very good, but did NOT taste like the girl scout cookies. i would recommend making sure the cookies are thin, otherwise it's a monster with the filling. my 7-year-old liked them, but the adults were less enthusiastic.

Delicious cookies for peanut butter lovers! I could not eat enough of these! However my boyfriend thought there was to much peanut butter...and prefered them with chocolate chips on top! I would suggest making a double batch of these...they go way to fast!

These were lovely. I've made them several times now and they always turn out perfect. To the latest batter, I added chocolate chips, personally I love the combination of peanut butter and chocolate.

I followed the recipe exactly.  The cookies turned exactly as pictured.  The are excellent and a big hit anywhere I take them.  The only problem (too few cookies) is easily negated by doubling the recipe.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Joanne.

These are great cookies! I doubled the recipe, but cut back on the white sugar as other reviewers said they were too sweet- they were fine for me that way. I used a little melon baller to get uniform amounts. You really only barely have to press them down or they will spread out very thin while baking. 8 minutes was enough on my oven, so start lower. They really don't look done, but they set fast. The filling is a MUST! It is so good and I'm already scheming to use it as frosting on cupcakes :) Everyone who tried these at my church group and at home lovvved them and they disappeared like lightning! A foolproof, fun, yet classic perfect cookie :) Happy baking!

Excellent peanut butter cookie recipe - best I've tried so far.  Read previous comments and doubled the cookie recipe, but not the filling.  Glad I did, as my boyfriend thought the cookie sandwitches were good, but preferred the cookies, sans filling.  As well, only baked the cookies for 8 minutes.  this way, they stayed really soft and chewy after they cooled. Ended up using half of the cookie batter and froze the rest.  Just finished making cookies from the frozen dough.  The dough froze really well and the cookies turned out great.  Again, made half into sandwitches and the other half as 'regular' cookies, as we prefer the 'regular' cookies oven warm, but the cookie sandwitches are much better cold.  This will become my standard peanut butter cookie recipe.

These are fabulous! I loved the filling especially. Made as directed with no problems. Using my small scooper, I cut each ball of dough in half and got 84 little cookies. When sandwiched together I got 42 cookies. Mine were 2" little cookies when completed.

These are amazing! The cookie turned out perfectly and the filling is exceptional. I followed the recipe exactly including using heavy cream for the filling. It doesn't make many because you double up on the cookies to make the sandwich, but I may buy a small cookie scoop and try that next time like someone else mentioned.

A very good cookie! This is a peanut butter lover's dream. I did make the filling, but in the end didn't use it because the cookies tasted great with out it. For a softer chewy cooking, I slightly under cooked the cookie by a mintue.

I've been making these for over a year now and *always* have someone come up at some point of bringing them somewhere and say that they are THE BEST COOKIES they've ever had... and I have to agree with everyone else that THESE ARE THE BEST DANG COOKIES EVER!  Seriously, they are amazing!  I use my cookie scoop so they all come out fairly uniform and then because I do get a little particular about these cookies - I like to match them up in pairs and then put the filling in between the two cookies.  These are definitely *NOT* fat free, but then - you gotta live a little!  PERFECT AS IS!  Thanks so much for posting this one!

FANTASTIC!!!  They are like gourmet nutter butters.  I had to give some of them away just so I wouldn't eat all of them so quickly--yumm! 

For the cookies, I suggest using Peter Pan's Honey Roasted Peanut Butter.  For the filling, I use natural smooth peanut butter.  ...they turn out sinfully good!

Following the recipe as written, i would only say these cookies were so-so.  My two year old couldn't get enough of them, my picky little brother took one bite and threw it in the trash and my husband and i both agreed they were good but we didn't like the peanut butter filling.  The cookies by themselves were very tasty and very soft and chewy, which i liked, but not enough to replace with my current peanut butter cookie recipe.  The oatmeal was a nice change of pace.  They were good cookies though.

This is one of the very best cookie recipes I've found in years! Do double the recipe or you won't have any the next day. I added 1 t. Karo syrup and the cookies stayed nice and chewy even after 3 days! I didn't make the filling. Thanks so much Joanne!

Have been making these for special occasions for a while now. I always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I make my cookie dough exactly as the recipe says, scoop onto parchment-lined cookie sheet, flatten with sugar dipped glass and then freeze.  I usually make two double batches at a time.  After they are frozen, I put in freezer bags. Then, when the need arises, I simply bake them for about 10 minutes, cool and fill.  I can make these up to two months in advance.  This helps at the holidays or for those unexpected times when cookies are needed.  They also freeze well after baking.

Absolutely addicting! My friends beg me to make these. 

Cookie:
I use a rounded teaspoon for each cookie. this helps have consistent sized cookies for pairing them.

filling: 
I roll 1/2 teaspoon (depending on the ratio you like) into a ball and then flatten them between 2 pieces of parchment or wax paper. (use a cookie sheet or book to press them down evenly) this will give you perfectly round filling.

These cookies are so great. I have only made them once but they were a huge hit and people have requested that I make them again and give them the recipe. A few suggestions, all of which pertain to the icing in the middle (the cookies themselves are perfect):  Add the confectioners' sugar to taste, 1 cup is way too much. Reduce the amount of PB in the icing to about 1/4 cup.  I found it to be overwhelmingly peanut buttery.  Last, heavy whipping cream isn't necessary.  I used it, but it's purpose it to thin out the icing so milk will work just fine.  Definitely make these if you are considering!!!

These were good. I wish I had a smaller cookie scoop because I think that they are rich enough that a small sandwich cookie was be just enough. I would recommend doubling the batch though. I will make these again.

WOW, this is truly a CROWD pleaser! I made these for my husband's co-workers and my child's teachers, and got 5 requests for the recipe! They were quick, easy, and fun to make. This is going in the book as an all time favorite!!!! HIGHLY recommend!!! You will NOT regret it!!!!!!! This recipe does not make many cookies, about 15-18 so I doubled it, but did NOT double the filling recipe!! You will have more than enough filling for both batches!!!!!!

I didn't make sandwiches from the cookies, but the cookie part was a bit salty for my liking, perhaps beacause I used salted butter? There was no salt in my peanut butter, I checked. I will half the salt next time. I DID love the texture of these cookies. I want to make the filling next time!

These turned out fabulous. Taste a lot like nutter butters. Made one batch small and two more larger since I was tired, lol. They were all great. Just cook the larger ones a couple more minutes.

Very good, however you MUST make them with a teaspoon ... I used a tablespoon and that is tooooo much cookie. Better when bite-sized!
My dough was perfect and I rolled them into balls first to get a nice round shape and then I pressed them flat with the bottom of a glass (greased) and they looked very professional.

These are the best of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies. I you make them in a standard size cookie it may be a little too big. the second time I made them I made a smaller version and they were perfect, not too sweet. I also added some mini chololate chips to the filling recipe. I have to say they are amazing! Thanks for making me look like a great baker, My whole family loves them.

I never add the filling, but these are some of the best peanut butter cookies ever!  My husband devours them.  I use old fashioned oats instead of quick-cooking oats and it turns out great.  Definitely a recipe I'll be keeping!

Yummmmm! An easy and delicious recipe that I will make again and again! A hint, you may need to add a little more flour so that they are not too thin. I had a little filling left, but not really enough for a double batch. You may also want to chill the filling to make it s little stiffer.

I did not make the filling - just the cookie part.  I decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, used wheat flour, and added some ground flax.  These were wonderful!  The decreased sugar made them tasty without the overwhelming sweetness of most peanut butter cookies.  They were chewy and the oatmeal gave them a good texture.  I also omitted the salt - the peanut butter has enough salt.

These are gourmet Nutter Butters. I was skeptical of the recipe but the cookies flatted out well. I overcooked the first pan but the filling ended up softening the cookie nicely by the 2nd day. I am glad I doubled the batch. 3 people have asked for the recipe for these. These were well worth all of the prep time.

I loved it! It's the best cookies I've ever made from stratch. I didn't do the filling, the cookies were good enough to stand on it's own. However, I did flatten the dough with a fork dunked in sugar. An improvised suggestion I took frm another cookie receipe. The dough doesn't stick to the fork and the end result suits me just fine; crispy, crunchy and delicious!

WOW! Made as recipe stated.  Easy and delicious! Only issue is that the cookies are a bit soft...maybe better than being crispy!  I guess I put too much (not enough according to the kids) filling because I barely had enough to fill all the cookies.  Will make these cookies again and again!

Outstanding! I could barely keep the cookies in the house - my whole family loved them. The filling is definitely enough for two batches of the cookies, which is good so I could make more and bad for my waistline. :) This is my new favorite cookie recipe!

I need to let the lady who submitted this recipe know that my daughter baked these cookies for our county fair.  Thanks to this recipe, she was selected to take the cookies to the Nebraska State Fair!!!  She will be sending them off next week.  I will let you know how she does...  These are absolutely delicious!  Thank you for the outstanding recipe!

I just finished making these cookies and they turned out very well.  The cookie itself is chewy and delicious, and that was baking for 8 minutes.  Based on the other reviews, I doubled the recipe (both the cookie and the frosting) and had just enough.  I used a teaspoon which made the perfect size and a double batch made over 50 sandwiches (I'm not sure of the exact number since my husband ate some!).  I tried using a pastry bag for the filling which worked okay until the tip came off.  I think it was because my frosting was very thick.  I even used extra cream.  So I ended up using a knife, which worked fine and was less work than the pastry bag.  I'll bring them to work tomorrow so we'll see what my coworkers think!  Well after bringing them to work, I'm changing this to 5 stars.  Everyone loved them!

WOW!!  Excellent recipe!  These cookies taste like a Nutter Butter or Girlscout cookies, but better!  I have made these MANY times and everyone BEGS me for more..  and what's more, I refuse to give them the recipe! I actually lie and say that I made it up myself.. lol.  I'm sure I'm not the only one around here who does that!    This recipe is pretty tried and true..  I don't alter it in any way.  As listed here it doesn't make too many cookies, so if you're just making cookies for yourself then this is fine.  But if you want to give them away or have a family you will NEED to double or triple the recipe.    Variations:    I do have a few variations of this recipe you might want to try...   First is the frosting, instead of using the heavy cream, I just use butter, peanut butter and powdered sugar, this makes the filling a bit more thick n rich.. which I love.  Also, you can ad some cocoa powder to the filling to make it chocolate..  only use maybe a tablespoon of  peanut butter, then add a couple tablespoons of cocoa powder to the butter/cream mixture.  then sweeten it with powdered sugar..  it's good!    Also, when filling the cookies, you can just dab on some of the peanut butter filling to only one side of the cookie, and on the other side spread some strawberry!  I make this by mixing some equal parts butter and jelly together, then just a tad of powdered sugar.  This is SOOOO good, tastes like a sweet peanut butter and jelly treat!  And you need to flatten them with a s

Yummy!!!!!!!!  I do not sandwich these but instead make them as single cookies, thinning the filling to use as  glaze.  I make (and eat) a lot of cookies... I think these are my favorite!

These cookies are the absolute best!!  I just baked a double batch and they are terrific.  Tasty and lovely to look at.  The filling is delicious.  I may be inclined to use crunchy peanut butter for the filling next time.

this was FABULOUS!!!  No more buying them from the girls scouts when I can make my own!  These turned out perfect, I followed the recipe just as written for the cookie part, but I omitted the butter and cream in the filling and just added water until it got to my desired consistency. I gently touched them with the back of a spatula as soon as they came out of the oven to flatten them and spreading the filling was no problem once they were completely cooled.  The recipe does make a lot of filling, so you might want to cut down a little.

I didn't get to taste these, because I had gestational diabetes when I made them, but according to my mother, they are quite fabulous.  The recipe makes about double the amount of filling that you need, so either double the cookie recipe or cut the filling recipe in half.  I would also make sure your dough balls are small - I used my cookie scoop and the cookies spread out ALOT when they baked and were bigger than I wanted them to be.  My mom said they're really rich too, so a small cookie would probably be better AND prettier!

O.mi.gosh!!!  These cookies were THE BOMB!!  I made them as stand alone cookies, not making the filling and creating sandwiches.  I tweaked only slightly:

I halved the amount of butter (making it 1/4 c) and added 1/4 c of shortening, then used three teaspoons of vanilla, and a tablespoon of sourcream.

Knocked my socks off!!  Not to mention my family's ~ who had never had a homemade peanut butter and oatmeal cookie in their life.  (I just don't make 'em . . .but it was what I had on hand!)  :)  These WILL be made again at our house!!  :)

Great PB cookie recipe! I also doubled the cookie part because there was a lot of filling. Didn't have any cream so I used milk and it turned out just fine. Hopefully will make with cream soon to taste the difference but if you don't have the cream milk was an easy substitute.

EXCELLENT!  I increased vanilla (REAL) to 1.5 teaspoons and used regular oats instead of quick ones.  (Gives it more of a bite/texture.)  I also stirred in a cup (or so) of chocolate chips at the very end.  After scooping dough for a while, (I made a double batch) I made an 8" square pan of bar cookies.  Those turned out great, as well!

Very good cookie! I used crunchy unsalted peanut butter and I also found  that I did not need to use a fork. I tried the filling, but actually like them better without. If you do make the filling, I recommend cutting the filling recipe in half because it does make alot. I will make these again.

These were so good.  I am generally not a huge oatmeal fan but in this recipe, the oatmeal creates a nice texture and is not overwhelming.  I used a mixer to mix the dough including to stir in the oatmeal and it created a fluffy dough.  The cookies tasted very good without the filling, but with the filling, were absolutely fantastic.  This recipe made 12 cookies (after sandwiched together), as I made them a little large.  I will be giving these to friends as Christmas presents and I have added it to my "favorite recipes" binder.

These were fabulous!! I didn’t do the filling for them and I added raisons which turned out really perfect! Also, I used honey butter by country crock instead of regular butter, it gave it just an extra hint of something that everyone loved, my sweetie could eat the whole batch at one sitting if I would let him!

Really nice cookies!  Keep an eye on them in the oven because they flatten out and could be too crispy if left in too long.  Nice on their own without the filling too.

My husband, childern, and co-works loved these cookies.  They are a nice change to tradition oatmeal/peanut butter cookies.  I didn't drop the cookies with a spoon, I rolled them with my hands and then after about 9 minutes of cooking, I pushed them down with a fork and countined to cook them 2 minutes longer.  They are wonderful.

O.K. I'm usually not of fan of peanut butter cookies, period.  I make a peanut butter cookie that people just love, but it doesn't tickle my fancy.  All this to say, This cookie tickled my fancy.  Wonderfully, soft and moist cookie with a great aroma & delicious taste.  This cookie is getting made for my Grandma next week and I know she's gonna love it.  Will update soon!  Thanks again. 2nd review:  this cookie is always requested by everyone and people tend to think that they're taking a step in the healthy direction because of the oatmeal. Note:  These are wonderful with or without the filling.  Mix in some mini morsels when serving without the filling.

These are delicious!  And so easy to make too.  Raelly nice presentation.  I used 1/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour and natural peanut butter.  I also used 1% milk instead of cream.  Worked great.  These are so filling- eating one is like eating a small meal!

These were really good, but the dough was the best of all.  My kids actually liked the cookies better without them being sandwiches.  Next time I'll skip the filling and just make the cookie part, and double the recipe.

These cookies are amazing!! I had to hide them from my kids to get them to stop eating them. They are alot like girl scout cookies, but even better, I don't have to wait for cookie season and I don't have to pay $3 a box. I can make them whenever I want.

These were fantastic! They baked to perfection in just a little under 10min. I used 2% milk in the icing because that was all I had and it was great.I also used regular oats and the cookies were perfect. Thanks for the recipe. I will make these again and again.

These cookies are a breeze to make and are so delicious!  My picky, picky 4 yr old LOVES them!  Did I tell her oats are in the recipe!?  I THINK NOT!   :)   They're tender crisp on the outside and oh-so-soft yummy in the center!

I added 1/2c semi sweet chocolate chips and 1/2c chopped peanuts to the dough.  I will surely make these again!  Thanks!

These cookies ROCK! I am making a double batch just so someone else can get some. Very, very good. Nice consistency, buttery, chewy, perfect! I rolled the dough into little balls, they bake into perfect circles that way. Then about halfway into the baking time, took them out and flattened with a spatula lightly.They are SSSOOOOO good!

I used 1/3 white flour and 2/3 whole wheat pastry flour, and NOT instant oats. Watch out to have a couple cookie sheets on hand, I only have one, and the recipe is too big to fit = bake in 2 batches. JAM of all kinds is almost better than the filling - I was experimenting! So, for the 20 something house-wife, put some rock and roll on the record player and whip these up! Have soy milk on hand to wash em down, and do not eat the dough - stomach ache city.

Excellent cookies!  I used a cookie scoop and cooked for 12 minutes (as they were larger). I flattened one batch but they only need to cook for 10 minutes.  Take them out right when they are lightly browned around the edges and puffy, they will look like they are not done, but they will fall and be crunchy on the outside and chewy on the iniside.  Oh yeah, I used more peanut butter, 3/4 cup.  These are good with or without the filling!

These cookies are excellent. Don't believe the reviews that say they didn't come good, or they're too dry or too wet going on the pan. I have cooked for a long time and these are the best peanut butter cookies ever. Use real butter, creamy peanut butter, not the all natural kind, measure the flour correctly and put in all of the ingredients. I don't see how they could fail. Yes, they are sweet, that's the whole point of making cookies!  I'll double the cookie recipe next time without doubling the filling. You have to cut back on calories somewhere, and I suppose that's an easy way of doing it. :)

We loved these cookies!  I hesitated in making the cookies a teaspoon size, but did it anyway and I'm glad I did!  Made the perfect size cookies for the kids, and prevents us big kids from having too much!  I didn't have heavy whipping cream so I used the only form of 'milk' we have which was unsweetened almond milk.  The filling turned out perfect... I don't think I needed 2 1/2 T. of the milk though... I ended up having to add more powdered sugar to make it the right consistency.  But those are such little minor details... this recipe overall is great!  My cookies were soft, I didn't bake quite as long.. every oven is different.  I think you'll be very happy with this cookie if you like oatmeal and pb!!  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  I took some other suggestions and covered some of mine in melted chocolate and turned them into a sandwich with the peanut butter creme.  I bag of dark chocolate chips and some crisco in a double boiler.  So yummy.  
The dough did not make very much but I believe that is because there will be 2 cookies to every sandwich, they don't have to be giant.  I was able to make 2 dozen cookies (1 dozen sandwiches) using small (1 in) disher.

Awesome cookies! These are ridiculously good! I saw another reviewer complained that the recipe only made 15 cookies. Well, I followed the recipe and dropped rounded teaspoonfuls and I ended up with 27 sandwich cookies. I think that reviewer made bigger cookies then the recipe instructed. The rounded teaspoonfuls provided nice sized 2 1/4 -2 1/2 inch diameter cookies which is plenty big enough for a sandwich cookie. I only had crunchy peanut butter, but it still turned out fabulous. I also dipped them in melted chocolate so 1/2 of the bottom & top of cookies were coated in chocolate. Wonderful cookie! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. It will be included this year in my Christmas cookie assortment.

Very, very good.

I used my small scoop (leveled off not rounded)  & got 15 sandwiches; they were a good bit larger than Oreos. I baked for 8 minutes until barely brown just at the edges then cooled them on the baking sheets. 10 minutes would have been WAY too long.

I added a little less milk to the filling and added some vanilla and a dash of salt. It was thick enough to just blop on with a knife. I had leftover filling but not enough to do a double batch of cookies.

Next time I'll use a melon baller to get smaller ones.  I discovered that you can emboss the cookies while still warm (I used a play dough plastic "stamp") so they have a design on them!!

For those complaining about dry/crumbly cookies... you are overbaking.

My husband loves these cookies more than anything. The only thing i do differently is add milk chocolate chips to the cookies themselves, but everyone that tries these fall in love. The filling is a little rich so i usually do a few as sandwiches and a few without the filling (I usually only make half a batch of the filling) and let people choose between the two. I think they are delicious either way!

The batter was very soft, which made the cookies a little difficult to form. I was afraid they wouldn't bake well, but they actually did. They spread out and puffed up quite a bit in the oven, but cooled nice and flat. They were easy to sandwich together and tasted a lot like Girl Scout cookies, but fresher. Good recipe!

These cookies are delicious and SO quick and easy. I also like that they are made with very basic ingredients that I would always have on hand. I can't say I was a fan of the filling though, too sweet. Next time I'll just make the cookies sans filling.

These taste yummy!  My personal preference are cookies that aren't too sugary and with 1/2 cup of white sugar added with 1/2 cup of brown sugar it definitely was on the sugary side.  If you want more peanut butter taste and less sugar I would cut the sugar in half - that's what my next attempt will include.

This was an absolutely fantastic oatmeal peanut butter cookie recipe.  I made a double batch from the get-go, being that we're a family of five and some of the reviews suggested that the recipe didn't yield a lot.    Let me tell you, these cookies went fast!  Delicious, rich, a nice moist cookie unlike some of the peanut butter cookie recipes I've tried that end up dry and crisp.    This is most definitely a keeper!

This is a quick and easy recipe.  A few tips: ensure the butter is room temperature, if you use SALTED butter there is no need to include the 1/2 tsp. of salt, use a medium cookie scooper, and only bake the cookies for 9 minutes.

These are very rich, but so good.  To prevent the crumble problem mentioned, I cooked these only until the very edges turned slightly golden.  Once cooled they frosted fine.  Also, I used a small cookie scoop and cut the dough in half to make small cookies.  One batch of filling is enough for 2 batches of cookies.

I loved this recipe! I took them to work and everyone loved them! I doubled the batch just like someone else suggested and it was a good idea.  I also substituted reduced fat Jif peanut butter, used half Splenda and half white sugar in place of all white sugar, and used Smart Balance butter instead of regular butter.  They still turned out great, and were still soft and chewy days later!

No CHANGES NEEDED!!!!I am usually one to go through hundreds of reviews, this one I didnt even bother, and guess what. . . It deserves everyone of those stars! My husband is not a fan at all of peanut butter cookies... He even whined when he saw me making them. The end product.. He loved them. He said those are different than the ordinary and helped himself to seconds and thirds. What I like is you can make these into giant cookies as well, they flatten out evenly and I dont think you need to really flatten them yourself, just shape them well. I also tossed in some butterscotch chips. MMMMM!

I'm not a big fan of Peanut Butter cookies, but I loved these.  TIP FOR APPLYING FROSTING: I recommend leaving the cookies flat and using a piping bag to get a nice even, flat look. This way the cookies won't break, and when you put the top part on, there's no need to push down too hard.

these are very good. the only thing i changed was for the filling i used regular milk instead of heavy cream, only i used a lot less than 2 1/2 cups (about a tbsp) and some granulated brown sugar along with the confectioner's to make it thick & creamy, and it was still delicious.

"Wow, Mmmm...and These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had!"  These were comments from my husband and co-workers.  They are the best, period.  I made 46 sandwich cookies following the recipe to a tee and I used all of the filling, (non left over as one review said).  I used my teaspoon measuring spoon to get the right size and hand rolled them into balls before flattening them with the bottom of a smooth measuring cup.  They were perfect.  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!  This website ROCKS!!!

Delicious!!! The trick for me was to 1)refrigerate the dough, it made it much easier to handle (I could have added a little more flour, however the cookies turned out just perfect, I decided not too.) 2) I actually used a teaspoon measuring spoon and mounded the dough on it. (It looked tiny but as others posted, it spreads so much.)  I used all of the filling. I beat it until it was nice and fluffy. Yes, it was sweet, but oh so good!

I love this cookie!! My husband and kids love this cookie. I make batches (some as is, some w/ choc chips), drop spoonfuls on cookies sheets and freeze the dough balls for later. My kids adore coming home from school and having just a plate of warm oatmeal pb cookies waiting for them.

Made these without the filling to save on time & calories.  They are very good but next time I will definitely cut down on the sugar and add ginger, cinnamon & other spices just to give them a bit of *zing*.

These cookies are SOOOOOO good.  The creamy filling makes the cookies so moist and delicious.  Because other reviewers said that the filling was extra sweet, I added a little extra peanut butter and a bit less powdered sugar.  They turned out perfect.  I can't wait to make these again!  Also, since someone had said that spreading the filling on the cookies caused them to break in her hand, I made the cookies smaller.  They came out about 2.5" in diameter and made 18 cookie-sandwiches.

Incredibly rich and delicious! I followed the recipe and made sure my cookies were dropped by TEASPOON fulls even though they looked so tiny. They baked up to the perfect size. I was able to make 30 assembled cookies. Thanks for the recipe!

I was wrong to be so hesitant about making these.  I never liked the Girl Scout version so I balked.  But these are really really special.  After reading some of the reviews I made only 2 changes:  used half butter and half shortening & subbed skim milk for the cream.  I doubled the recipe since it seemed to make so few but I should not have.  I used a small scoop which is 2 teaspoons size and made 56 two-inch diameter sandwich cookies.  I did flatten with a fork.  I also used a good tablespoon of filling for each sandwich.  Be sure to use a mixer for the filling.  I added enough skim milk to the other ingredients to get the fluffy texture I was after.  In my convection oven I found that 7 minutes worked best.  These are so gooooooooooood!

Omg..amazing.  My roomies, my boyfriend, my class mates...Can't get enough of these wonderful treats.  I make them different everytime, depending on what I have in the house.  Once I added chopped white chocolate and macadamions to the dough...That was good...once I added coconut...That was good...Ive made them exactly as the recipe says...That was good....They're just good.  Great recipe!

the best peanut butter cookies i've ever had. i can never make regular peanut butter cookies again.I doubled the dough and not the frosting and it makes a perfect amount. i also added a splash of vanilla to the dough and frosting. Everyone that tries them thinks they are just amazing. they are gone within two days....be prepared to make a lot, and often.

I prepared this recipe exactly as written.  The cookies turned out beautiful.  I would cut the filling amount in half and spread less per cookie to cut back on calories.  Also, a note I used chunky peanut butter for the cookies since that is what we prefer and it was just fine.  This is an EXCELLENT recipe!

These are spectacular.  My family ate them before I could slap them together.  These are our new favorite cookie.

Fantastic recipe! They really did turn out just like the Girl Scout cookies. 
Two minor changes I made was to add an additional 2 tbsp of regular sugar and 3 tbsp (instead of 2 1/2) of heavy whipping cream to the filling mix (made the peanut butter flavor/texture a little lighter). Definitely, a Girl Scout "cooking badge" winner in my eyes. Thanks!

I thought these were alright.  I think it could have used some chocolate of some kind.  I may make again but put chocolate chips in them.

These were fantastic, but maybe it's a combo of my cookie pans (dark) and my oven (1990s...), but 10 minutes was way too long to cook these cookies.  I could smell them burning at about 7 minutes, so I pulled them out.  Luckily they are just very browned and not really burnt.  The other batches came out perfectly when I cooked about 6 minutes.

These are the most DELICIOUS cookies!!! I didn't have whipping cream, so used whole milk, and didn't have quick oats, so I used regular oats. I had to bake for 12 min and only added half of the liquid to the filling.  Tasted crunchy, light, buttery, and delicious.

Oh. My. Goodness. Incredible. Even my husband (who is NOT a sweet eater) said these were dangerous. Fortunately, I made a double batch because it took me a couple of sheets to get it just right. Make them small, because even after you flatten them, they spread quite a bit. I have a gas oven that tends to run pretty warm; I baked my first batch for 6 minutes and burned them, so you will definitely need to watch them closely. Just as the edges start to turn, they're done. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used whole milk for the center and they turned out perfect. YUM!!!

These were amazing!! I made these at school for my friends in Japan because they had never eaten peanut butter cookies or for that matter peanut butter. They all loved it and begged me to teach them how to make the cookies. Instead of using creamy peanut butter for the cookies, I used crunchy instead. And because I couldn't read the Japanese on the milk cartons, I used soy milk instead and they still turned out great! These are about as close as you can get to the girl scout cookies...believe me, I've looked!:)

Truly great cookies, a nice change from regular old oatmeal or plain peanut butter cookies.  Make sure you keep them small, they're very rich.

These were fantastic.  I also used regular milk instead of cream in the filling and thought it was great.  I made mine smaller and cooked for ~8 minutes until the bottom of the cookies was a dark golden brown - they were still chewy but not underdone.

These were just awsome!!!! I'm from germany and we don't have vanilla extract -  so I used two packs of vanilla sugar instead. I put the dough over night in the fridge. The next morning I formed walnut big balls and flated them between the hands. This way, you get really nice and flat cookies.  I backed the cookies at 180° for 13 Minutes - because we like them really crispy on the edges. Always put the dough on a cold baking sheet.

I made these for the high school soccer team I coach and they absolutely devoured them.  I've never heard high school guys ask for a recipe before, but they all went nuts over these.  They even made me promise to bake them a huge batch at the end of the season if we won our conference.

Amazing!  The best peanut butter cookie I've ever tasted!  I didn't make the filling, I made a thin, drizzly, icing for the top.  I used peanut butter, milk, and powdered sugar.  I made the first batch, tried it and then decided I better make another batch!  Awesome!

I gave this recipe 5 stars because of the taste, texture and it's quick & easy.  I used half the sugars (1/4 & 1/4) bake at 350 convention for 5-7 minutes.  I store 2/3's in wax paper in the fridge and bake fresh every day...Perfect!  Thanks you 10 times over for such a great cookie recipe!

Everyone LOVED these cookies.  The only thing I changed was I increased the cream for the filling by another teaspoon as we found that to be rather dry, so keep a watch on that.  Everything about these we loved.  We will definitely be making these again!

These are the best Peanut Butter Cookies I have ever made.  A small amount of cookie dough makes a good size cookie.  The filling in the middle is simply delicious.  I don't think my children will notice that they have oatmeal in them.  I'll be making these often.

These cookies tasted a LOT like the Girl Scout Cookies. Delicious! They also kind of reminded me of Nutter Butters, in cookie form. Some people mentioned in their reviews that you should double the cookie recipe except for the frosting section. I did that, but ended up with approximately 20-30 cookies left over without any frosting left to smooth on. So I would have to recommend keeping the recipe exactly as it is -- if you double it, double everything. Also, the cookies possibly double in size during the baking process, so make sure that they are only about the size of a quarter or so (maybe slightly larger) after smashing them down with a fork. They were so good, everyone gobbled them up in one day!

These are some of the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had.  Yes, they do remind me of the girl scout cookies and nutter butters.  But I did not make the creme for in between for sandwiches.  I ate them just as they are and they are great.  My boyfriend loved these cookies and I will definitely be making them again, very soon!  Thanks.

WOW!!! These were AMAZING!!! My family absolutely loved them. I made them just the way it says except I didn't have any heavy cream. I used milk instead and the frosting was still amazing. I recommend using the whisk attachment of your mixer on the frosting...it makes it really light and fluffy and impossible to resist. These cookies are good with or without the frosting, the frosting just makes them extra special. A very good recipe, I will make it again.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful! I made these cookies two times, once with the frosting, and once without.. I liked them better without the frosting (However, I think i liked them better w/o  the frosting because I used too much in between each cookie). 

My entire family just LOVED these cookies with OR without the frosting.
I would most definitely recommend this recipe! (i'd have to say this is probably my favorite recipe for peanut butter cookies!!)

First, I wanted to say thanks for making me laugh Jen G. about saying thankfully I am fat and I like fattening things, that was so funny and I totally know what ya mean :)

Now to rate these cookies.......they are awesome! My kids and hubby LOVED them, but they ARE rich, so next time I will make smaller cookies and use a little less filling in them. These are great though, give them a try you won't regret it.

Outrageous cookie! I used crunchy peanut butter for the dough, smooth for the filling. Chill the dough first.  Use a 1" scoop, or even a little smaller; it's a rich cookie. Rotate half way through. I layed out all the cookies and used a pastry bag for the filling. Found it hard to judge the amount of filling otherwise. Don't hesitate to try this cookie...

Excellent cookies.  Someone suggested I make them with a chocolate filling next time.  I may try that, but I'm not sure they need improving.

YUMMY! This was such a great recipe. I made them just today and between the kids and I, all of them are gone, except for the two that I saved for my husband. I'll be making the recipe for years to come.

These cookies are great! They have just the right amount of sweetness. I didn't make the filling but they definitly didn't need it. I didn't realize that I had run out of baking powder in the middle of making these so I substituted 2 parts cream of tarter and 1 part baking soda, it it worked really well. No need to flatten before baking, they spread perfectly.

These are wonderful - better than the Girl Scout cookie!  My children and the neighborhood children say these are the bomb.  I'm printing out the recipe for their parents now.  Thanks!

Very good cookie, but next time, I will try baking them for 8min. instead of 10 because they were a bit to crisp for us.  The filling is awesome; and don't forget, these cookies bake large!

Yummy, very good. The filling is tasty, though a little on the sweet side. Next time, I think I will cut back on the sugar in the filling.

This is an exellent recipe, but I made a few changes...I didn't make the filling...they are wonderful without it.  I added semi-sweet and white chocolate chips - about 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup.  I also flattened the cookies with a sugar coated glass, and then sprinkled chopped peanuts on top and flattened them again.

These cookies were so good, I couldn't stop thinking about them in the middle of the night.  I just wanted a plain drop cookie that was easy to make to put in lunches, so I didn't make the filling.  They are wonderful plain.  I'm not a big fan of peanut butter cookies, as they are so often dry.  These had and almost creamy texture that was held together with the oatmeal which added a chewy quality.  Will definitely make again, very likely today.

Wow - if you love peanut butter, then these are for you!! I followed the recipe exactly, except I baked them for only 7 minutes(until golden on the bottom): that way they're soft & chewy. They remind me of "Pirate Peanut Butter Cookies"; of course, these are better! I think the cookies would be excellent even without the filling. Best enjoyed with a glass of milk or a cup of tea!

I'd give these cookies 6 stars if I could!  AWESOME recipe!!  I followed the recipe as given.  Just no need to flaten the cookies at any time. I doubled the recipe for the cookies, but no need to double the filling (it made plenty).  Many thanks Joanne for sharing this recipe.  We have a new family favorite!

I made these cookies for a group of about 80 sorority girls.  They absolutely loved them!  I also took some to a baking Chef instructor at Le Cordon Bleu Academy.  He asked for the recipe...apparently PB's are his fave & they were the best he had ever tasted!  I did add some more peanut butter as so many others and used a scoop  to portion for consistant size.  I found that not flattening the rounds before baking made for a much better final product.  I did flatten ever so slightly immediately after baking.  I will bake these cookies often as they were a hit!!

I have not even filled the cookies yet and I already know these are a keeper. Made as written, except I used crunchy peanut butter cause that's what I had on hand. Mine baked in exactly 10 minutes, and I left them on the sheet pan for 3-4 minutes to set. They really do taste like the Girl Scout cookie. Thanks so much for the great recipe! Edit: used the filling and it made them absolutely amazing! I used milk instead of cream and it was still so good!

These are amazing!  The only thing I did different was used coconut oil in place of butter in the cookie part (not filling ). So delicious - crunchy yet chewy.  I use the all recipes app and it allowed me to change serving size to double the recipe.

This is my favorite cookie recipe. I don't use the filling, I add cinnamon and chocolate chips. I do wish it made more though. I have tried to double the recipe in the past but it does not turn out right. The quantity the recipe makes is the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.

These cookies are to die for!!  I made them for a party and they were a huge hit.  I followed the recipe exactly as given, except I doubled the cookie recipe and just used a thin layer of filling.  Best peanut butter cookies I've ever had.  Will definitely be making them again!!!!

yummy flavor.  You do not need to flatten these out before you bake (like the recipe says).  This made them way too flat.

This is a delicious cookie even without the filling! I doubled the recipe since only 2 dz doesn't last long around here and I knew I didn't have much time so after mixing the dough I divided it into four parts and rolled each into a log wrapped in parchment paper and then tossed it in the freezer. The next day all I had to do was slice and bake. I reduced the baking time to eight minutes though, the first batch I put in for the ten minutes and they kinda came out "cajun style" lol....All in all its a great tasting cooking that I WILL be making again!

Very good cookie!  After reading reviews, I cut the butter back by 1 tablespoon, but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  I rolled mine into small balls, then crisscrossed with a fork dipped in sugar to flatten slightly.  I baked them for about 9 1/2 minutes and they turned out perfectly crisp on the outside and chewy inside.  By using slightly less butter and refrigerating the dough for about 30 minutes, mine did not spread and flatten out. They also were not greasy as others complained about.  The next time, I'll make them smaller.  Since they are a rich cookie, I think maybe smaller would be better.

I just made these. I followed the instructions exactly except I only had about 1/2 c oats. I think this made the batter a but wet. I didnt need to grease baking sheet. I didn't flatten, just spooned onto sheet, they came out very thin still. My brother said they are the best cookies he's ever had. I also used all of the icing and it came out to bout 20 cookies total

First off I must admit I do not like peanut butter. (hiding my head in shame)  I made these for Christmas along with ten or so other kinds of cookies and these were by far the most asked for.  Those who tried them wanted the recipe or wanted me to make another batch.   This is a keeper for sure.  Thanks for sharing.

These were very good- and VERY rich.  I think many of the complaints about this recipe not making very many cookies are being made by people who are making the cookies too large.  A rounded teaspoonful does not make a super-big cookie, they're on the small side (which is a good thing with the two cookies and super-rich filling!).  The dough is very sticky and I found that it was easier just to flatten the cookies with my finger than to use a fork.  The best batches that I made were the ones that I took out when they looked just barely done and then I allowed them to sit on the cookie sheet for a couple of minutes before transferring to wire racks.  These cookies are definitely worth the extra time and effort!

These were wonderful. I made them as the recipe called for, except I used extra crunchy peanut butter (and added extra), and I got stuck with using "I can't believe it's not butter" because we didn't have any real butter in the house. They came out wonderfully chewy and crunchy. Next time i'll make the filling.

Yummy! These were really good. I liked them best the first day as the second they were soft and lost their crunch, but they were still good. They didn't make it to day 3 with myself, my husband and 2 big kids eating them. I used all of the filling and thought it was the perfect amount. Will make again.

I just made these with my sister. She loves oatmeal cookies and I love peanut butter, so these were a perfect compromise! They only needed 7 minutes in our oven. I doubled the recipe as previous commenters suggested, but wish I hadn't. These are very filling, so one at a time is plenty. The icing is really good. This is a great cookie if you want moist oatmeal cookie with just enough peanut butter taste. We'll make these again.

I have tried many peanut butter cookie recipes in the past, this is the only one that never crumbled. They're so soft and flavorful. I had some leftover cream cheese frosting, so for the filling I added a little peanut butter to that. Best peanut butter cookie recipe I've come across.

I've never gotten around to making these with the filling, but everyone loves them on their own! Everyone who tries them comments on how addictive they are and keeps coming back for more! Somehow these manage to taste even more peanut buttery than regular peanut butter cookies. A must-have for peanut butter lovers everywhere!

these are very yummy!  a nice treat from the original PB cookie. I might try to use the filling recipe for cupcake frosting, it would be great on top of chocolate cupcakes that are not too sweet.

Being allergic I couldn't taste them, but everyone (save a non-lover-of-peanut-butter) said they were great. They were gone in a flash! Would make again, easy to make. Double filling at least...better thick ;)

I couldn't stop eating these. They ended up expanding in the oven, so I was quite surprised at how big they ended up being. So measure the recommended amount of dough onto the cookie sheet. I baked 2 batches, and the first ones were kind of burnt, so it's best to keep an eye on them and take them out right when they look ready.

This is a great cookie recipe. I made them with almond butter (because I needed to get rid of it) and added a handful of chopped almonds - extraordinary! I didn't make the filling but they were delicious just on their own. Will definitely make them again!

Made this (X4) yesterday but didn't fill.  Added mini semi-sweet choc. chips(1-1/4 cups) and had to grind up 'Orig.' oats as didn't have Quick. They are AWESOME!!  Using my 1-1/4 inch diam. cookie scooper, got 140 cookies out of this batch.  Will throw away all other peanut butter cookie recipes.

These are the best Peanut Butter cookies I have EVER had.  I would suggest that you make them very small.  I made 15 large cookies and it was too much by the time I filled them.  I am making them again today and I will make them as the recipe suggests...using a teaspoon.  My husband said they were great without the filling so I would also suggest leaving a few without.

DANG!! Outrageously delicious.  The only thing I did differently the second time I made them was to use Hodgson's Mill Whole Wheat flour for a little added texture. Not that they need extra texture, I just like whole wheat flour.

These were good. They didn't quite taste like girl-scout cookies, but they were pretty close and satisfied everybody.

This is absolutely the cookie you have GOT to make if you want to show off. I have gotten rave reviews from anyone who has ever tried these. I followed the directions exactly and they came out perfect!!!! I cannot tell you how delicious these are... you just have to try them for yourself!

Oh my word! I made these last night for my family.....my son asked if I could incorporate some chocolate into the recipe, so I dipped the edges in melted chocolate chips and a little butter. They are insanely delicious! We loved the added chocolate, but it isn't necessary at all. These cookies are outstanding on their own!!! Thanks so much!

This is a great creation!!!  It was an instant favorite of mine and my co workers.  I question the amount of flour used though.  3/4 cup?  I added more.  I also doubled the filling to make double stuffed cookies - which was at the request of my eaters!!!

This is the best cookie ever!!! Delicious. I didn't have heavy cream so I used half and half for the filling instead and it still tasted great. Thanks so much for the recipe. I will be making them again and again!!!

These were so delicious! And great for little hands. My kids loved them, and also did my husband who doesn't eat much sweets. I got about 30 or so sandwiches from it and still had filling letover. I will definatly be making these again soon!

These cookies are soooo good! My husband could not stop eating them. I thought that the amount of icing was perfect. I literally just had enough for all the cookies. I used 2 Tbsp milk in the icing instead of the cream and chunky peanut butter instead of smooth. Heavenly! Sweet and salty with every bite.

He-Man of the cookie kingdom!! Absolutely amazing! BETTER than a Nutter Butter cookie...never thought I would ever say that. Chewy with crunchy edges and peanut buttery goodness.  Filling is perfect, not too sweet.  Regarding the flatness of the cookie: I used margarine instead of butter, this creates a flatter cookie, no need to flatten with a fork (this is true with any cookie recipe).  Didn't have heavy cream, so used skim milk instead with no problem.   Also used a small ice cream scooper to drop onto cookie sheet, which created perfect round cookies in about 3 minutes.  Took only a half hour for entire cookie project, including cooking and assembling time.

I've made these cookies 3 times now and they're always a hit.  My brother drools at the mere mention of them.  My boyfriend says they're even better than Pirate cookies.  I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe!  As other reviewers have suggested, a melon baller is a great tool for spooning out the right amount of dough.  I was able to make 24 perfectly-sized cookies this way.

These cookies will have you do-si-do'ing around the kitchen! Knocks the socks off the drier girl scout cookie version. These cookies are incredible! **Do NOT be tempted to eat the dough! Save it for the cookies!!! **Followed recipe exactly, except for the heavy cream. I was going to use coffee creamer but it tends to do weird things to frostings. So, instead I let some vanilla ice cream melt a bit...WOW! These will be a guaranteed hit at work tomorrow! I almost didn't frost them, as I thought they were great just as a little cookie. But they are even more amazing with the filling. ENJOY!!!

WOW!! Very GOOD!  They really do taste just like Nutter Butter cookies! My husband loved them and we are bringing the rest to the Super Bowl party.  I made the chocolate ganache recipe and drizzled it on half of the cookies for those who like chocolate and pb (ME).  Double WOW!

Awsome cookies. They have a different texture than the Girl Scout cookies, but I think they taste the same. I even think I like these better. I did double the recipe and it made 30 cookie sandwhiches. Thank you for the wonderful recipe

These are very good. I had a "yen" for something peanut butter and saw this recipe.They are so good, I didn't bother with the filling. I'm the type of person that usually picks the frosting off cakes and doesn't eat it, same with sandwich cookies, I don't usually eat the filling. A mighty fine peanut butter oatmeal cookie as is with a glass of milk.

These are amazing!  Amazing.  It's true they don't make a lot (I got 18 total) but what you get is fantastic!  I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the filling but otherwise made as written.  I baked for 8 minutes and that was perfect.  They stayed soft too!  I personally used every bit of filling and had none left over.  I can't wait to try them dipped in chocolate as one reviewer suggested.

I thought these cookies were just "okay". They turned out perfectly as far as their look, but I thought they were too salty. I used a pampered chef large cookie scoop, filling it then pressing it against the bowl to make a level scoop. This made exactly 26 uniform cookies. As far as needing to flatten them, don't bother. I tried it both ways, and either way, they flatten out.

I did what some of the other people here did and doubled the dough recipe, but made the filling as is. That way, it made more than about 20 cookies. This recipe is quick and delicious, and my boyfriend promptly ate almost all of them.

These cookies are so yummy!!  I am not a peanut butter fan but I could eat these by the batches!  The family loved them too and they were incredibly easy to make!  I used a pizza stone to bake them on and I needed to cook them a couple minutes longer but otherwise I followed the recipe.  Hubby says better than Nutter Butters because they aren't dry!  YUM!

they were great. half the iceing is plenty for a batch if you don;t like them to sweet. I used crisco so they were soft and of the 36 i made only 3 broke. When they first got out of the oven they looked to puffy no fear they flattened nicely. I would make again as they look fancy but are easy to make

These cookies were incredible! I took the advice of a previous reviewer and doubled the batch, but not the filling. This was excellent advice. I also took her advice and pulled the cookies out at exactly 9 minutes (she said 10 but I used a convection oven which is often quicker). I let them sit on the baking sheet for approx. 5 minutes before removing and they were PERFECT! I would highly recommend these for easy, quick cookies that everyone will love. It took very little time to fill them, so don't let that scare you off!

Wow - this one was a huge hit at work! I recommend cutting the filling recipe in half - it makes way more than you'll need.

These are amazingly delicious! I gave one to my dad and without telling him they are supposed to be like the girl scout cookies he quickly exclaimed "these are to die for.. they are better than those girl scout cookies (his favorite..)" The cream in the center is what makes these cookies amazing.

This is the best cookie recipe of all time! I make them exactly according to the recipe except I use milk instead of the cream (just because that's what I have in the fridge). The cookies do expand a lot when baking and you have to remember you are going to sandwich them later so it is best to make them smaller. These are my husbands and my favorite and I would recommend them to anyone who likes peanut butter! Thank you for the recipe!

This was a really good cookie, but mine came out a bit too crumbly for my taste. Good job, quick snack and healthier when i added chopped peanuts and whole wheat flour.

My husband called these "homemade nutter butters"!  I made a double batch and took them to a cookout.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.  I'll definitely be making them again-- I think they'd be a hit at a cookie swap.

This is the perfect cookie.  I used a scoop to put them on the tray and the turned out perfectly round, moist and thick.  I bet they'd be good with milk chocolate chips!

Fabulous recipe! They taste just like a home-made, soft, chewy version of Nutter Butter sandwich cookies. However, I'd recommend doubling the batch. When I used a size 50 mini ice cream scoop, a single batch of dough only made 34 cookies, which turned out to be 17 cookies when spread with the filling and sandwiched together.

These were a huge hit!  I doubled the cookie dough, but made the creme as stated in the recipe.  It worked out perfectly!  I might try to make smaller, more bite-sized cookies next time because these are really filling.

These cookies were great, and I got a ton of compliments on them!!!  Make sure to leave them on a flat surface when applying the creme filling, otherwise the cookies have a tendency to break.  Very good recipe!

This is DELICIOUS! I realized that for probably the first time in my life I didn't have any white sugar, so I just didn't add it, and added about 1/8 of a cup more of the brown sugar. These cookies were really good, and I am not even a big fan of peanut butter.

Are you ready for the BEST COOKIES YOU HAVE EVER HAD??? I wish I could give these more stars!! They are amazing- and I'm not even a huge peanut butter cookie fan. You have to make the filling! (And I used non fat milk instead of whipping cream cuz that's what I had). Also, I think you should only cook them for 8-9 min, let them cool on the pan for a few minutes and then move to completely cool on a wire rack before attempting the fillng. I made these last night and they are almost all gone this morning- I've had 2 for breakfast! Shhh.. don't tell:)I just can't resist!!!!

This is one of the best and most versatile cookies ever!  I didn't add any white sugar, used half a banana for the egg, and substituted fake butter for the real and made them into 100% vegan cookies!  I also added sliced almonds, white chocolate chips, and dried cranberries.  They were to die for!!!

This recipes was great! I blended the oatmeal to make a fine consistancy and that was all I changed with the cookies. Very good. With the filling I skipped the butter and sub. water for cream. My husband can't eat dairy. They taste fantastic!

The best cookies I have ever had! I did a few things different, though.I did not use the filling; my wife didn't want to try it. I dropped the dough by tablespoons and did not press down. What I got was a nice thick, Chewy cookie; YUM! I was kinda worried when I got done making the cookie dough. It was quite moist and very sticky. I used non stick spray to spray the tablespoon and I rubbed a bit on my finger; NO STICKING!
This is an AWESOME recipe, and very tasty! It was not too sweet as I have read from another reviewer; IT WAS PERFECT!! Thanks for such a great cookie recipe!

These were very good. My boyfriend loved them. I made them just the way they were. I'd have to say though that they are a little too sweet for my liking which is the only reason i gave them a 4 star. I will make them again but cut down on some of the sugar.

These cookies were great.  I didn't make the filling, made 12 cookies and cooked them for 15 minutes just until the edges were browning.  I also added chocolate chips.  They were wonderful.  I will definitely make these again.

These were very yummy.  I would add less salt next time.  1/4 tsp would be plenty since there is salt in the peanut butter already.  We enjoyed these though.

These really do taste just like the Girl Scout cookies! I followed the recipe perfectly and they turned out delicious! The only thing I did differently was the presentation. I didn't sandwich the cookies with the filling, I simply spread the filling on top of each cookie and served them individually. No worries about being messy! They stacked on the plate beautifully...my husband loves these!

I made these cookies with my three year old. They were very easy and probably the best peanut butter cookies I have had. I did not make the cream filling, but they were still very good. Even after several days of sitting, still very soft and enjoyable. Will make again.

Too sweet for us...but will definitely try this recipe again with less sugar.  These spread way out when baked so make sure you start out with a very small amount of cookie dough. You will want small cookies to double with filling or else you will be looking at a cookie that is dinner size.

I made these cookies last year as a treat for students I was giving a presentation to and I have to say they were just awesome! One of the students even said they were divine. I lost the recipe, and I'm so glad I refound it! The best thing you can do with peanut butter!

I made these as stated in the recipe, filling and all. I got 20 sandwich cookies. For me, these were a 3 at best; my husband thought they were pretty good and even said they reminded him of the girl scout cookies--I hadn't even told him that they were supposed to taste like that. I haven't had the girl scout cookies, so I can't compare them. He took them to work and his coworkers ate them quickly, so because he and his coworkers liked them, I'm giving them a 4. There was nothing wrong with the recipe--the cookies had a pleasant texture, the filling was fine, I just didn't like the taste. I guess it just doesn't appeal to me, but obviously appeals to lots of other people. I still probably won't make these again. If I hadn't been able to unload them at my husband's work, I might have even thrown them out because I would never have eaten more than two of them. I think I like them better without the filling.

These cookies are awesome!  I've been making these for almost two years now and get rave reviews every time I make them.  I use the Pampered Chef small scoop to make the cookies with and can get 24 filled cookies from the recipe.  Thanks so much for submitting this wonderful recipe!

This is the best peanut butter cookie!  Amazing!  I also used old fashioned oats and my cookies were pretty thick too.  Next time I'll use a smaller cookie scoop.

These were just the way I like them...moist, chewy and flavorful.   The best endorsement came from my seven year old son: he called them "the best cookies in the whole world".

These cookies were great.  So soft and chewy.  I didn't use the heavy cream, didn't have any so I just used skim milk and I also used more powdered sugar than called for.  I was looking for a different texture with the filling. My husband took some to work and one of the guys said he would be in trouble if he lived with me.  One of the best cookies.

I will quote from the recipient of this batch of cookies (an actress currently starring on Broadway, no less)!

"Just had to tell you what a hit your cookies were !!!!  OMG, those peanut butter creations were AMAZING!  The few people who were lucky enough to get one (I ate sooo many myself) agreed whole-heartedly...some of the best cookies ever!  My new personal favorites!  I can't thank you enough."

That made my day.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  It's in my "winners" binder.

Great. I used raisins in some and then chocolate chips in another batch. I tried the frosting once and its too rich and sweet. I brought these to work and had to then pass out the recipe to everyone, they loved them.

Yum, Yum, Yum! I have made 4 batches of these in 2 weeks and all have gone. Added whole oats to make them chewy and they were the perfect texture. My brothers kept stealing the batch i made for work, so i ended up having to make more to take. Everyone loved them! 
I didn't add the filling, they seemed naughty enough without the cream, and they were still amazing. Thanks

I was amazed at how good these cookies are--peanut butter and oats are a very good combo. I couldn't talk my husband into letting me make sandwich cookies out of these (they are delicious on their own), but I had some left-over powdered sugar icing and made just one for myself, and it was fantastic. Great chewy texture and very addictive!

I highly recommend this recipe.  I added "Heath" bar pieces to the cookie dough, and I did not bake the cookies for too long.  That way, these treats were soft and chewy.

I enjoyed these cookies. They were among the better ones I have made. I did however find them too cakey, rather than chewy (the way I typically like oatmeal cookies). Because of this, the frosting seemed to blend into the cookie and it was hard to distinguish the two. next time I will omit the baking powder, or decrease it and hopefully this will aid in a less "fluffy" cookie.

Yum. Tips:  Make a double batch.  One batch is simply not enough.  I did not want to make sandwiches, so like a previous author recommended:  add just a smidge of chocolate chips.  Yummy, yummy, yummy!

This is the best cookie recipe I've found in years!  The only change made was making 1/2 of the filling recipe as suggested by other reviewers.  I think these are much better than Girl Scout Cookies!  Thanks for sharing a GREAT recipe.  This is definately a family keeper!!!

Amazing! I love this recipe. I did make a few alterations to the filling- first off, it makes lots- you really only need to make half and you'll have plenty to frost all the cookies. I also thought the filling was a bit thick and too peanut buttery, so I just use less pb and it's great!
They're also very rich- sometimes I just frost one cookie instead of making sandwhiches with them

These were delicious even with a lot of modification to make them healthier. I used natural peanut butter (Smart Balance), 3/4 cup Splenda and 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup whole wheat flout and 1/4 cup all-purpose flour. I didn't make the filling. They came out very moist, chewy, and sweet. They were a little crumbly, but that was ok. They tasted great warm with sugar-free vanilla ice cream sandwiched in between!

Everyone I know LOVED these. My husband ate seven the night I made them, they were barely even filled yet, and by the next day they were completely gone.

This recipe is the best! I don't usually like peanut butter, and these are my favorite cookie. The filling sets up nicely.

Really, really yummy.  I only cooked them for 8 minutes and they came out perfect!  I also used milk as well, didn't have any heavy cream.  Didn't matter though.  They were delicious!

Very good. I didn't have heavy cream so I used milk, it worked fine!
I let them cook a little longer so they were a *little* too crunchy. But super good nontheless!

Didn't have cream, so I just made the cookies.  EXCELLENT!  I halfed the recipe (didn't want all those cookies to tempt).  With the recipe halved, I sectioned the dough into six large cookies and baked them on top of parchment paper.  Because they were so big, it took a full 12 minutes to cook, but they ended up perfect.  Crispy around the edges but sooo soft and yummy in the middle.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I made this recipe and brought it to work. We have a small lunch bunch so I halved the recipe. Everyone loved it. They are just like the Girl Scout cookie. Delicious! I wish I made a full recipe. Next time I will use chunky peanut butter in the cookie recipe. I think the extra crunch will be tasty.

Wonderful!! The perfect blend of peanuts and filling! I used chunky peanut butter for the cookies and it turned out lovely.. But please, DO NOT be temped to eat the uncooked cookie dough, it causes MASSIVE stomach aches (but then again, I can only speak for myself) :) Definately one of my favorites

Thanks for a great recipe.  Wife wanted to try a new cookie recipe for our snacks at Sunday School class and I found this one for her.  Luckily we left a couple at home or we wouldn't have gotten any.  Telling them they were close to the Girl Scout's cookie, most said not close but better.  Wouldn't change a thing.

It is true they are a lot like the Girl Scout cookies, which I have always loved.  But the are MUCH BETTER!  Because they are chewy, not hard.

I am a peanut butter-aholic! This is a great recipe! I can't belive how tasty it was. To make it a bit more healthy, I used egg beaters, splenda, cool whip (for the heavy whipping cream) and light butter. It came out great and tasted just the same. Two thumbs up for this recipe!

Awesome Cookies!! I didn't have cream so I used half and half, I didn't add as much as called for because half and half isn't as thick, they turned out great! A teaspoon seems small but they really grow when baking!! My husband went to take a bite of one and ended up eating the whole thing, he said "I couldn't put it down", The kids I gave some to said I was the best cookie maker ever..so thank you!

Yummy!  I didn't even bother with the filling.  Because of a family allergy to peanuts I used Trader Joes Soybean Butter and they still came out fabulous!  Also added about 3/4 cup of carob chips.  Will be on the favorite cookie list!

These cookies were so delicious. I made them for my family, but ended up eating most of them myself. I didn't make sandwiches out of them, because they were addictive enough as is. I don't think I will be making more of these soon, or else I'm going to get really fat!

I didn't have the ingredients on hand to make the filling, so my 4 year old daughter and I just made the cookies and made a little powdered sugar icing to top them. They were so good.  The cookies came out moist and chewy I would make this again.

Thank you soo much for this great recipe. They taste like there are really crushed peanuts in there, which is caused by the lovely crunchyness of the oatmeal.
I made them without icing on a great summerday, and my friends nibbeled them away in no time! Be ready to bake another batch, for they will disappear in no time! Wonderfull!

These are sooooo good.  Made them for my dad on Father's Day and couldn't keep them away from my husband!  Made a double batch and didn't flatten the cookies out, but did roll into balls which made for a perfectly round cookie.  Followed the recipe exactly and turned out a soft, chewy, bakery-style delicous cookie.  Thanks for sharing such a terrific recipe!!!!

Excellent recipe. I made mine twice the size and cooked a little longer. I also added a small handful of chocolate chips because my daughters love chocolate chips in cookies. I figured I would need double the filling, but I was wrong. Perfect amount of filling with the recipe. So I have a lot of filling to put in brownies next. lol
VERY SWEET! So one cookie (mine are big anyhow) is perfect for anyone. 
I highly recommend these.

They were sooooo yummy. Absolutely great! my only complaint is the salt. it was ok but i think there could have been half of what it called for, or none at all. They took a while to make but they are soooo worth it!!!

These were so fantastic! My husband isn't a fan of peanut butter, but definately loved these. I made half of them by the recipe (as I love peanut butter). The other half (for the filling) I left out the peanut butter and used a bit more powedered (confectioner's) sugar, for more of an icying type filling (but is a bit sweet). Both were absolutely wonderful! Definately, need a nice cold glass of milk with!

i was looking for more of a softer oatmeal pb cookie and this was quite crisp. the taste and look of them was really good (i did not use the filling in the cookies) but the texture was too crisp for my liking. the amount of oatmeal was just right, however I will keep looking for a soft pb cookie.

I could tell these were going to be good so I immediately made a doule batch. Husband and sons kept going back all Sunday afternoon to get "one more" - they are addictive! 
I at first thought the icing was a little too buttery but no one else thought so at all. Next time I may cut back the butter a bit and replace with more peanut butter. I WILL add these to my Christmas cookie list.

So the first time I made these I followed the recipe to a tee. I found this searching for sourdough cookies ?? Anyway, I really wanted to incorporate sourdough starter to help use up my discard. So I messed around a couple of times. I increased the flour to 2/3 cup and added a 1/2 sourdough starter. The Starter should go in at the very end and only mix until blended. Let the dough sit for an hr. Cook for 12 minutes instead of 10. I personally prefer to do these as drop cookies. I stopped bothering with the filling it was way to sweet for me and my kids don't need the extra sugar.

Absolutely AWESOME!! A real keeper!! They are right that they don’t look done but they made 8 sandwiches from halving the recipe!! My husband said you sure can’t buy cookies this good!! I too used chunky pb for the cookie & the filling and it was outstanding!!!  I halved the recipe just to see if we liked them.   Next time I am making the whole batch!!!

I have made these cookies several times for a crowd and they are always eaten up in no time.  The only bad thing is that it's a bit tedious to spread the frosting between the two cookies.  This time I figured out to put a big dollop of frosting in the middle of one cookie.  Then place the other cookie on top of it and gently squeeze and twist the top cookie.   The frosting will spread perfectly between the two cookies.  So much faster.  (be generous with the frosting....you will have plenty)

Absolutely!!!  These taste like the Girl Scouts cookies that I buy.  The filling is really go and I think can be used for other sandwich cookies when you want a peanut butter flavor.

Prepared as written, though I was concerned about the final product considering the fats involved. I should have adjusted for the fats. This recipe as written yielded one heck of a greasy cookie without flavor or texture to redeem it. This will not be a repeat performance.

Wow, these are incredible!  I used my standard sized cookie scoop and got 25 cookies (= 12 1/2 sandwich cookies).   Finished cookies are approx. 3 - 3.5 inches diameter. The filling was the perfect amount to fill the 12 sandwiches, and a thin layer to frost the single leftover cookie.  I put approx. 3 scoops (dime-sized circumference scooper) of filling per cookie. Take the time to make your cookies uniform. It's a pain to make these into sandwiches, but so worth it!  And very impressive to look at, too. Great for gifting!

I just made these and asked a few people to try them. Oh my goodness they thought they were  incredible. Also very easy to make. I didn't change the recipe it was perfect. Thank you Joanne Reaney. I would have included a picture but my husband packed and put them in the freezer before I had none left for the car show I am baking cookies for.I don't know why someone would make a recipe then make all the changes, why not just post their own recipe.

I had to make several substitutions to the filling and it still turned out  great! I used whole milk instead of whipping cream, granulated sugar instead of powdered and was short on brown sugar. 
I did also add cocoa powder to add a bit of chocolate flavor and it  was fantastic!

I didn't make these as sandwich cookies...I made them as instructed but added milk chocolate chips, and refrigerated the dough for a few hours before baking. They are really good. A single recipe yields approximately 2-1/2 dozen.

Wow! These are amazing! I followed the recipe as stated and so good! 

I did two double batches to take them to a school function. It made about 84 sandwiches with the small cookie scoop. 

I read another review that said not to double the filling so I didn't and I would agree. Since I made 4x the original recipe, I did need another batch though and made a chocolate ganache filling for the other half. I don't know what's better-peanut butter filling or the chocolate. Both are amazing. 

This is a dangerous recipe because it's just so good!

The cookies on their own are delicious, I cut back the sugar by 30% and found the icing still plenty sweet.

This cookie was excellent. I made them twice. Cooked them at a lower temp, and they came out great. I actually took the cookie, hit it with the PB spread, and then put the PB spread side down into some melted dark chocolate. Then topped it with some chopped Hazelnut. The dark chocolate was a perfect addition. The bitterness complimented the sweetness of the cookie. I also added about a tbsp of cinnamon and half a tbsp of allspice. 5 stars from the family!

These are the best peanut better cook I have made, with that being said, the first batch turned out very large.  To large for sandwich cookies for me.  My cookie scoop must be bigger than normal. Anyway I just spread the top of the first batch with the filling then I split the second ones in 1/2 and filled.  I will definitely be making these again.  Great recipe !!!

Haven't eaten them yet but recipe is exact, right down to the 10 minutes in oven. I press my cookie dough down with a dinner fork in both directions to make even. They looked like they may have been under cooked but I let them go and they firmed up nicely. I will continue my review after dessert tonight! I didn't have heavy cream so I used fat free half and half which worked perfectly.( a nice substitution)

I have to agree with some other reviewers that they are too sweet with the filling.  Next time I will cut the sugars in half in the cookie part.

The best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.  I made only the cookies, not the filling.  I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  They have a soft middle and slightly crispy outside.  Love them!

Good.  Easy recipe.  However, I only used 1/4 cup of white and 1/4 cup of brown sugar and these were plenty sweet.  With the addition of icing, one really does not need all that sugar.  Could probably get away with even less than what I put in.  But, they were good.  Peanut butter flavour not too overwhelming.

I made it with natural almond butter instead of peanut butter and old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking oats.  I didn't make the cream filling.  They were delicious- chewy, not overly sweet and a bit crumbly.

I made no changes. However mine came out not as perfectly round as yours but that doesn't matter as taken as a whole bite the flavors were spot on and this is a keeper. Especially if you love the original Girl Scout 'Goucho's.

I make these all the time. And when I do people beg me to make them again. It’s like a fresh homemade Girl Scout cookie without all the additives and preservatives.

Delicious! I easily made it vegan by subbing out the egg and butter, made the cookies tiny since one serving would be two cookies, used almost all of the frosting, and they were perfect. This recipe made 18 sandwiches for me, I used a teaspoon to portion out the dough. An instant favourite.

Make sure you use your smallest scooper and make the cookies as small as possible. They are so rich (and delicious) but I wish I would have made mine smaller. This is my go to now!

These cookies are excellent. I ate four before I had to quit! No changes made to the recipe. The filling recipe is delicious. My yield was 25 sandwiches. These will be a regular in my cookie jar. Thanks

So good. As per another reviewer, I did not double the filling when I doubled the recipe . It’s more than enough. These are really delicious.  I will make again definitely.

Perfectly delicious! Baked 9 mins, let sit 5 mins on sheet. I also made them small (tsp) sized and made 48 cookies! 24 sandwich cookies, yet I only put it on a couple. Totally worthwhile cookies to make, even if you don’t make the filling. Sweet cookies too! Perhaps 1/4c less sugar would do just as well. Also, I didn’t have quick cooking oats, so I ground up rolled oats to make them smaller pieces. Worked fine!

These cookies are great !! I would say eight min made it the perfect texture for me . I also made my first batch regular sized cookies and than decided for my next batches it would be tastier as a cream cookie mini so I made them much smaller . I would say the size of a measuring teaspoon small . Make sure to flatten them out before putting in the oven or they will be high . Don’t be afraid to flatten. Followed the recipe exact and I would say it was perfect !

Unfortunately the cookies never made it to the filling phase. Even my stepson who claims he doesn't like peanut butter loved these. My only complaint is they seem a little fragile and it seemed they might have needed another 1/4 cup of flour. But after carefully moving them to the cooling rack they firmed up enough to be able to pick up without falling apart.

This is one of the best cookies I have ever made. I made it exactly as the recipe states. My cookies look just like the one in the top picture. They were not runny or flat. I think the trick is to use butter that is out of the refrigerator for only about 10-15 minutes so that it was still firm, but slightly softened on the outer surface. Also, I put the cookie batter in the frig to keep cool while I baked a sheet. I doubled the recipe and it made a little more than 2 dozen. I made a few big cookies to make ice cream sandwiches with chocolate chip ice cream between the two cookies instead of the filling from the recipe. They were to die for!

Love this peanut butter cookie recipe!  I just use the recipe to make individual cookies not the sandwiches but they are also very good when you make the cream and cookie sandwiches.  Yum!

I’ve made these twice now and let me tell you.... If you love peanut butter cookies these are the ultimate!  Be sure to use just a teaspoon or less of dough when you put it on the cookie sheet. They do spread and you’ll be putting 2 cookies together to make one.  They really are like Girl Scout cookies only better because they are fresh.

It was really good, however I would recommend not making the cream filling, and also, I would soften or melt your butter before putting it in the mix. It took a while to get it to blend, but after adding the dry ingredients, it was fine. After all they tasted really good though. ????

I doubled the recipe and doubled the filling. I got aprox  35 double cookies.  these are delicious and maybe a little on the richer side but its not the kind of cookie you want to scarf down......just take your time and enjoy it.  Tastes exactly like a nutter butter........only bigger and more satisfying.  Delicious ...

These are 100% the best cookies I have ever made.  So good.  So addictive.... I doubled the recipe and am so glad I did.  I'm going to put these in regular rotation for sure.

They are a very large cookie once you add the filling and sandwich it, so next time I would make them smaller.

I didn’t make any changes at all and these were perfect! The only thing I left out was the filling since it isn’t necessary. These are still great as a stand-alone cookie!I don’t like peanut butter but these taste amazing! They are the best mix of sweet with salty. I will definitely make these again!

I made these for a holiday party at work and I received rave reviews from everyone who tried them. They were absolutely delicious. The only thing I would say, if you plan on making them for a party make sure to double the recipe. The recipe above only makes about 14 sandwiches. Other than that, I will definitely be making these again!

These are so amazing. I made them exactly the way the recipe is written but I did change the execution just a little :) As one other reviewer mentioned, the recipe doesn’t make a whole lot once you sandwich the cookies so I reduced the size of the cookie. And once you put the filling in, they’re practically perfect! I found that some of the larger cookies were too much with the frosting but the bite-sized version is just right. Also, I piped the frosting in using the ziplock method because the cookies are so soft they tend to fall apart. I’ve made this recipe three times this week!!! Everyone loves it :)

I made the cookie with crunchy peanut butter, 3/4 cup instead of 1/2. For the filling I didn’t have heavy cream so used milk, I don’t see where heavy cream really would have made a difference, but smooth peanut butter. After reading reviews first I baked them for 9 minutes for a soft cookie and BIG spoonfuls, maybe too big but my husband says no. He said it was the best cookie he’s ever had. It only made 10 “sandwiches” because of how big they were but that’s more than enough. Definitely a bookmark.

The recipe itself went together easily, other than the amount of mixing by hand required to combine ingredients (don't own a mixer, so it was somewhat manually intensive). I also spaced the cookies a little too close to each other on the baking sheets (had to do two batches with the output of the recipe) on the first batch and they ended up forming squares against each other with the space on the sheet. No real worry, though, as they separated by hand just fine when cooled.

I saw other people recommending a slightly lower cooking time. With mine on tinfoil over a regular baking sheet, the first batch I did for less time and ended up having to put them in a little longer. The second batch was in for 10 minutes and these came out perfectly.

I'm still not too sure about making the filling for these, as trying to spread it on caused the cookies to break until I left them overnight. I liked the flavor of the filling + cookies, but they were very peanut-buttery as a result - doing without the filling might be better for people who don't want to be overwhelmed with peanut butter flavor.

These did taste almost exact to those awesome girl scout cookies only better!  I doubled the filling as it didn't seem like enough to make them really yummy. Also, watch closely so they do not overcook. I may have pulled mine out a little early but better than overcooked.

These cookies are very dense on their own. Makes sense to make them with the filling, but if you want just plain, peanut butter oatmeal cookies, I would search elsewhere. Not very light and fluffy.

Yum! Definitely a keeper. Very rich. I made a double batch of the cookies and a single batch of the filling as suggested by others. I was a little short on the filling, but the cookies are very worthy of eating plain. I dropped rounded teaspoons full on to parchment lined sheets. My regular cookie sheet took 8 min and the air sheet took 10 min. I didn't need to press the rounded teaspoons down before baking, they flattened perfectly when they cooled for 8-10 minutes. I also used milk for the filling instead of cream. Easy to make and are disappearing quickly as I type.

GLUTEN FREE VERSION!  These were awesome!  My husband said they are the best cookies he's ever had. 

 I used Gluten Free rolled oats...used someone else's suggestion and whirred them up in the food processor...and (Gluten Free) almond flour in place of the regular flour.  Everything else was the same, and I used Aluminum Free baking powder.  I did not have baking soda, but these cookies still turned out great!  I sprayed a mason jar ring with cooking spray and placed the bigger opening down on the cookie sheet.  Then, I took my small cookie dough scoop, dropped the dough into the ring, and tamped the dough down with the backside of the scoop.  I removed the ring and then smoothed all the dough out so that it was and even thickness.  The mason jar ring helped to keep the cookies a uniform size and shape and worked really well.

 I even goofed up the filling!  I had no confectioner's sugar, so I replace it with organic granulated sugar. I didn't have heavy cream, so I used a tablespoon of cream cheese and a splash of 1/2 and half.   It came out too gritty, so I heated it in the microwave for two minutes to melt the sugar and it formed a wonderful peanut butter caramel!  It was delicious and held the cookies together beautifully. 

 I then took another member's suggestion and melted a mixture of milk chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips in a double boiler, and dipped the cookie sandwiches halfway in chocolate.  I then sprinkled some fancy gold colored sprinkles on them and

I didn't change the recipe one bit. I did refrigerate my dough so that I could roll it easily into small balls and then flatten for a more uniform looking cookie. They're very rich and delicious. This is the second time I've made them and they turn out perfectly following the recipe exactly.

Loved these cookies!  Made for our 2nd Annual Bridge Picnic!  They were enjoyed by those 8-60!  I love frosting, so I filled them good!  Still had some left over, I think I'll warm it and try it over vanilla ice cream.

These were really quite good, but the cookies are too big to make a sandwich cookie.  To solve this, i allowed them to cool until almost fully cool and then cut each cookie in half with a sharp knife.  This made pretty half moon cookies that were the perfect size for a two bit sandwich cookie.  I did double the recipe and found that I only needed about 1.5 the amount of the filling.

This used to be my favorite type of Girl Scout cookie, so I was super excited to make a gluten-free version that I could eat. I bought all the ingredients,  mixed all the cookie ingredients -- and then got lazy. I decided I didn't want to make the filling and assemble, so I added a cup of miniature chocolate chips to the dough and baked. It made about 30 delicious cookies. I definitely want to try making them the "traditional" way... but IF you're like me and want your cookies right away, try adding chocolate chips (or regular/mini m&ms, which I'm going to try, too!).

These cookies are delicious- a new family favorite!  I use crunchy peanut butter in the cookie part, and creamy in the filling, and I   use old fashioned oatmeal because that's what I normally keep  on hand.  I make them very tiny and cook for 7 minutes.      These cookies converted my husband from a peanut butter cookie hater to a peanut butter cookie lover!

I made this with half of the sugar and they came out great. I didn't make the icing. Took off off one star because I can't imagine how disgustingly sweet these would be with the full amount of sugar. Once again it amazes me the sweetness of some of the recipes here. Half sweet (1/2 both brown and 1/2 white sugar) was just perfect.

UH-mazing cookies!
I didn't add the oats, for preference reasons, and they actually turned even better (in my opinion) than with the oats, because the cookies weren't as dry. And there was plenty of icing to spare!
But....
Didn't make a lot of cookies, but it was enough to last a week of lunches.
And instead of the whipping cream I used 5% vanilla yogurt and it worked really really great.

These cookies are dangerously yummy! I made these per the recipe, except 1) I substituted reduced fat creamy peanut butter for regular, and 2) I only used 1/2 of the frosting.  I made 40 cookies, for 20 sandwiches. I used chilled dough with a cookie scoop. The cooler the dough, the smaller and rounder they are, so refrigerate dough until you drop it on the baking sheet. I did not flatten the cookies w/ a fork, but instead dropped the pan on the counter after removing from the oven. I cooled the cookies on the pan for 5 minutes then transferred them to the wire rack. Frost cooled cookie on a flat surface, not in your hand.
Nutritional Info per sandwich w/ reduced fat creamy peanut butter & half the frosting:
192 calories; 9.8 fat; 4.3 sat fat; 55.8 chol; 48.2 sod; 18.1 carbs; 1.15 fiber; 9 sugar; 3.6 protein.
Enjoy!

I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made them.  I scooped my cookies with a cookie scoop and then halved the balls which gave a more manageable sized cookie.  My husband and father-in-law preferred them refrigerated and loved them.
The second time I made the recipe I was in a hurry and was serving my gluten-free daughter.  I exchanged gluten-free flour for regular flour and pressed the dough into a 9x13 pan and baked for 18minutes. I then spread the "filling" over the top as a frosting..  (I did not advertise that they were gluten-free to the rest of the eaters... and they were greatly enjoyed by all.)

I made these but left off the filling as they tasted perfect all by themselves.  I especially liked the lightness and crispiness and the less overpowering flavor that usual peanut butter cookies have (not that they aren't also good, but these were a very nice change).  I noted to myself to try a bit less sugar as they are very sweet but most desserts are.....just a thought.

Best peanut butter cookie recipe I've made, very easy to follow. I didn't make the cream. Instead just put a little peanut butter on a cookie to make the "sandwich". As another reviewer said, these taste very close to the girls scout cookies. I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

Made as stated. Since these were being given as Christmas gifts, I needed a uniform appearance. I used a large cookie scoop (2 T. size). Divided scooped dough  in 1/2 and then rolled each 1/2 into a ball. Flattened with fork, as directed. Also, I made the icing, as directed, and those without diabetic concerns received the double sandwich cookie. Everyone loved them and requested they be a permanent item in their home baked goodie baskets. Great recipe!

These cookies are sooooo good! The only substitution I made was to replace the peanut butter with almond butter. They were so delicious and my family couldn't leave them alone. I had to make a second batch! Be careful not to over bake them, I baked them for 9 minutes and that was perfect! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Very nice pb/oatmeal cookie.  I added what I had left of a bag of mini chocolate chips, and didn't want to do the sandwich thing, just single cookies.  I whizzed half of the old-fashioned oats, as one reviewer suggested.  Perfect cookie texture - not too soft, not too crisp.  Will make again.

This is a good base recipe with a lot of potential for adaptation.  Dough is a very nice consistency and easy to work.  Flavor is delicate with equal parts peanut butter and oats.  I think dried cranberries or dried apple would be a nice addition.

(Note: I did not make the icing and did not make sandwiches; only the cookies)

I tripled the recipe and to it added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp mace and 3/4 cup crushed pecans.  Halfway through the batch, I added 1/4 cup unsweetened dark cocoa powder, so half batch with chocolate, half without.

I found a cooking time of 13 minutes at 350 to be perfect, resulting in a chewy cookie with just the right amount of crisp.  I don't like undercooked, 'soft', cookies.

I made these exactly as the recipe stated with one exception, based on other reviews I halfed he frosting. They are super yummy but definitely rich.  We actually found that they are just as good without the frosting, (insert warning!) it makes you want to eat that many more of them because they aren't as rich. Yum!

Followed the recipe completely, except for adding a dollop of Nutella to the filling... Tasty and wow!! So easy to mix and handle. Once they're baked, you might want to leave them in the oven for a few minutes so they don't fall apart. Will definitely be making these, again and again!
Update: You ALWAYS want to be making double batches of these, unless you plan on baking everyday! I double everything except the egg, and it worked perfect - the cookie doesn't spread, and it's just as crispy and yummy.

These cookies were such a hit with the whole family.  
I did make a few changes.  I doubled the cookie recipe because there just isn't enough batter.  I did not have eggs so I substituted 3 tablespoons mayo for each egg.  I used dark brown sugar instead of light.  I kept the correct measurements for the filling but I used one tablespoon soy milk in place of the heavy whipping cream.  Do pat the cookies down before baking and 9 minutes was long enough.  Allow the cookies to fully cool before assembling with the filling.   Soooooooooo good. :-)
The only reason I made so many changes is because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.

These are wonderful! I made them exactly as directed. Definitely a hit with my hubby and his buddies (and my hubby is VERY picky about peanut butter lol). I definitely recommend going all the way and making the filling, it was well worth it! Though you do end up with a good bit more than you really need. I've read a few reviews and am not sure why there are so many that mentioned a greasy cookie - mine were perfect! I will absolutely make these again (many more times!)

Followed the recipe exact and they were wonderful. I chilled the dough and then flattened once on the cookie sheet. Cooked for 10 minutes for a chewy cookies and then 12 minutes for crispy cookie.....as we have a long running debate in this house as to whether cookies should be crunchy or chewy..... Chewy will ultimately win one day!! Definitely a recipe I will be using again:)

Me and my daughter made these, based on the menu, we stuck to the recipe to the tee, we needed a digital food scale to determine portion size, wo did well making each cookie 30 grams. and had a tiny ball left. the exact amout was 30.29 grams , we like to use a air bake sheet, seems to prevent burning the bottoms well for us. they are a very tasty peanut butter cookie, i will add to my favorites, you may experiment with the time as my daughter found spreading the filling a little difficult since the cookie are soft and a little fragile.

Followed directions almost exactly, but I lightly dusted the tops of the cookies with powdered sugar once they were done.  They turned out so good, and they are super easy to make.  I'll def. be saving this recipe for the future!

Amazingly delicious. Make sure you smush them down and ensure they aren't too big. Mine were too big to make a sandwich, so I just added the peanut butter as a topping for each cookie. Still super delicious.

This was an excellent cookie...notes from the kitchen, I made some changes...I used only 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of packed Brown sugar....I doubled the recipe on the filling....it's incredible...this will be one of my new favorite cookies to make for my Christmas cookie tray...thank you for sharing Joanne!

I made these tonight and they were delicious! The whole family liked them. The only thing I may do differently in the future is either half the cream filling recipe or make the cookies smaller and double the servings to 24 to lessen the amount of cream on each cookie. They really did taste like the girl scout cookies. Will definitely be making again.

Great Recipe, made it using ingredients exactly as stated in the recipe, and they came out great. I needed a cookie recipe to bake for a meeting at work where we all have to bring cookies for everyone, so I doubled the cookie recipe, and did 1 and a half of the filling recipe, and it ended up being a perfect amount. (Made about 22 large cookie sandwiches.)
Note: you do really have to like peanut butter, since it's in the cookie, AND the filling. 

Tips/Modifications: 
- I did refrigerate my dough for a few minutes before forming the cookies, and in between batches. 
- I ended up using teaspoon sizes scoops to form each cookie, because I thought the size stated in the recipe were too small... My cookies actually came  out quite big, like regular sized cookies, but mini cookies might have been better in this case because 1) they're cookie sandwiches, and 2) they are rich. 
- I added vanilla PASTE to my filling in my second batch, and it made the filling taste so much better! I do recommend it; though, I'm not sure how adding vanilla extract would taste. 
- Also, I only put the cookies in the oven for 8 minutes, and let sit on the tray for about 30 seconds longer, before moving them to a cooling rack. The tip to move the oven rack one slot down to ensure a crisp bottom was great; it made frosting the cookies easier.

These cookies are great! My husband usually only wants cookies with chocolate in them somewhere, but he begged me to make a second batch of these instead. I didn't change anything in the recipe. It's very easy and yields a delicious result.

Delicious! One question:  do you use unsalted or salted butter?  I would normally think for a cookie to use unsalted, since you are adding salt anyway, but only having salted butter on hand I used it.  Thought the cookie had a slightly salty after taste.  Next time I might try unsalted butter.  Otherwise, these are FANTASTIC!

I baked it in a13*9 for bout 15/17mins at 340° then when it cooled I cut it in half placed face down  putting filling on one half then placed other half on top creating a big stuffed cookie then cut into small pieces served in mini cup cake liners! It's the best filling I have tried and oh my I have tried lots.  This one is not to sweet but sweet enough while still being creamy light and fluffy.  Thanks for sharing this great cookie ?? recipe

These cookies are delicious and were a huge hit with my family! Make sure you only bake these for TEN minutes (they won't look like they are fully baked). Let them sit on the baking sheet for a few minutes and they will flatten. If you bake them too long, they will be crisp and dry. I skipped the filling. I think they would be too sweet with a filling. I will be definitely making these again.

These were delicious! My family loved them! My only advice is to make smaller cookies; when you make the sandwiches with the filling, it ends up being a whole lot of cookie!

Loved this recipe!  I only changed the servings as people said it was a small amount, and put Trader Joes "cookie butter" in between and I used a cookie cutter AFTER I cooked them so all were exact same size for the divine cookie sandwich. Yes part of the OCD in me! But wonderful and fun recipe and a PERFECT use for my cookie butter instead of only on morning toast! Thank you!

This was an excellent recipe. I made this for a party with 20 or so frenchies who aren't that fond of peanut butter. They ate. Every. Single. One. And I doubled the batch. Definitely a go-to cookie recipe.

Oh, wow! These are the same taste as the Girl Scout cookies. Amazing! I doubled the cookie recipe, but left the filling the same. Otherwise, don't change a thing!!

I don't tend to rate recipes that I try, but I had to for this one -- it is absolutely amazing!!! Though it was a bit labor intensive to flatten out the cookies before baking, the end product was absolutely incredible! I used chunky peanut butter instead of smooth and I think I would do it the same way when I make them again. My husband and I fought over these cookies as they are so yummy -- and he doesn't even care much for peanut butter cookies! This recipe is for keeps!

Wowsers! Delicious! I like to measure the oatmeal and then blend it in my vitamix to a powder - something about the texture I like.  Very good cookie with the filling, my co-workers scarfed them down fast!  And yes, double the recipe I think I only got about 2 dozen sandwiches (barely).... delicious!

My son made these, he did not add the filling and they were the perfect balance of crunchy, tender, sweetness but still earthy. We greatly enjoyed them. Great comfort cookie!

This came out wonderful , I did use honey natural peanut butter and they are great . I also used two percent milk ,I also didn't have the cream and the filling came out just fine . Can't wait until the kids get home from school to try them . I'm sure they won't be able to stop at one ! You must try this recipe !

Very yummy! Stick to the 1 tsp of dough per cookie because when you stack them, its a lot of cookie. The dough was a little hard to work with, but they ended up very tasty!

I made this exactly as written and I think these are the best cookies I have ever made in my life!  I did use parchment paper instead of greasing the baking sheets and the cookies were perfect!  These easily could be sold for money!

I missed girl scout cookie season this year and was craving the peanut butter sandwich cookies when I found this recipe.  This is a great cookie!  I used a small cookie scoop which yielded 48 cookies (24 sandwiches).  I also baked the cookies for about 10 minutes to get a crispier cookie that wasn't too hard/browned.  I found that the cookies have a tendency to crumble so I'll check out a few of the modifications that others made to yield a more robust cookie.  Be warned that this is a rich cookie recipe.

I did not have heavy cream so used whole milk.  Other than that, I made it exactly as written.  Everyone loved them.  I was testing my new silicon baking sheets and baking time had to be increased by 2 minutes.  I don't know if that is the recipe or because of the baking sheets.  Anyway, this has been added to my recipe box.

Bake these and you'll be a hero to your peanut butter loving friends/family members! My friends went NUTS over them. I have been asked to make them again and several folks have wanted the recipe. Following the recipe, I used a 1-1/2 tsp scoop (you will want to be precise because cookies need to be same size for assembly) and got about 15 cookies, so like other reviewers have said, you will be well served to double the recipe.  When they come out of the oven, give the cookie sheet a little tap on the counter to easily deflate them, otherwise, you can just tap each one with your fingers or a spatula. I used the convection bake setting so I knocked the temp down 25F, but on regular bake, I'd use 350F. Took them out at exactly 10 minutes and let them cool a bit on parchment lined cookie sheets until they were hard enough to remove to the cooling racks w/o breaking apart and let them finish there. As far as the filling, I had too much left over after my first batch, so I now just put a dollop on half the cookies before putting the tops on so I can add or take away as needed. No need to have any of that yummy filling left over! I don't find them overly sweet, but they are rich/filling. I use unsalted Plugra butter, Bob's Red Mill Rolled Oats, King Arthur Flour and Peter Pan PB. I did not find them too salty. I made a batch with a basic unsalted butter and Quaker Oats and preferred the Plugra/Bob's Oats. As always, when baking, be precise in your measurements for best results!

Family went nuts over these. I used all dark brown sugar and chunky peanut butter in the cookie dough and used 4ozs of low fat cream cheese instead of the whipping cream in the filling.  Yum!

Absolutely delicious cookies. I read some of the reviews and after hearing about problems with flattening out I thought the problem was too much butter. I doubled the cookie part of the recipe except I left the amount of butter 1/2 cup and left the amount of peanut butter 1/2 cup. I followed the filling recipe exactly as writen and like I said, the cookies were fabulous.

Great cookie, even without the filling! Next time I will try the filling, if there are any left. I appreciated the previous reviews that warned of overbaking, it's true, they don't look done, get them out anyway.

These cookies spread a little too much and they get too crispy. The filling was very liquid-y. I had to add at least another cup of powdered sugar to thicken it up. Though they taste good, I will not be making them again.

WOW. Very very good.  The only change I made was to the filling: I ran out of icing sugar so I improvised a filling, simply mixing peanut butter with a little maple syrup. Turned out great! But I obviously can't compare to the recipe filling. I think next time I'll make the cookies a bit smaller, stacking two full-size cookies together with filling creates a bit of a monster cookie.  Mine were perfectly cooked around 7-8 minutes, careful not to overcook!

WOW are these cookies delicious.  I do find them to be a little rich with the filling so I may try to tone that down a little but other than that this is a definate treasure of a recipe.  I am so glad I tried it because I absolutely adore the Girl Scout cookies that these mimic.  The cookie part of the recipe is terrific and can certainly stand on their own without the filling.  With the filling mine were substantial in size so I will make them a bit smaller next time.  This will be a go to recipe for years to come.  With a glass of milk they are sinfully delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were wonderful.  I made some changes based on other reviewers suggestions and wish I would have followed the recipe as written.  I only made half of the filling and ended up being quite short. I used teaspoons to measure my dough for each cookie and ended up with almost 30 sandwiches (about 10 of which had no icing).  I also followed the suggestion to chill the dough for a bit first and this was very helpful.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these today for my son's LAST MINUTE NHS award ceremony tonight and not only are they easy, they are a knock out!  I doubled the entire recipe and had about 3 dozen when sandwiched, mostly same size.  Next time, I'll do monster ones.  Stay away if on a diet!

They were really yummy.  Next time I make them I am going to make the cookie a little thicker though so maybe they won't get so soft.  The flavour was really peanut buttery though, excellent!

These were so so so delicious! I read another review that it only made 15 cookies when you put them together, but I made 30. Maybe they used more than a teaspoon when dropping the dough. They seem small when you drop teaspoon fulls, but when they bake they become the perfect size. I am not patient and so I decided to melt my butter in the microwave for both the cookies and the filling, which turned out great. I agree that just a small amount of filling is all you need. It was a very easy recipe as well.

These may be the best tasting cookies I've ever had, they simply melt in your mouth.  Had a hard time keeping my larger cookies from crumbling, so I'd recommend making them smaller then you would a normal cookie.

If you love peanut butter, you will adore these cookies. I had to make a lot of them and didn't have time so I didn't read any reviews. That was not really necessary at all. The only thing to mention is that putting the fork in water before pressing on the cookie helps a lot. And for some reason my filling was a bit dry so I had to add more cream. But the amount of filling was just perfect! Like everything else as well. Extremely delicious cookies!

There are really good oatmeal cookies to give as gifts because they do not contain any raisins.  I do not usually make the cream filling because the oatmeal cookies are so good just on their own.

Delicious! BUT beware, these little guys SPREAD while baking! I would recommend placing them 1 1/2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Also, when the recipe states to drop by the teaspoon, it means it! I did a bit more than a teaspoon and my cookies turned out quite big. Not that I'm complaining, especially since I was not planning on making the filling anyway. I baked them 8 minutes only, and they were perfectly chewy in the middle and crispy around the edges. A GREAT recipe!

Everytime I make this my younger sister's friend goes crazy. She loves peanut butter and what could be better than peanut butter cookies sandwiched with a sweet peanut butter filling. Thanks for such a good recipe. (Even though I double this recipe for the twenty or so kids in our youth center they're usually gone before dinner time)

These really did taste like the Girl Scout Cookies.  I didn't have any quick cooking oats so I just used the regular Quaker oats and it worked out fine.  I also didn't have any confectioner's sugar, so I just used plain Jif peanut butter for the filling.  Also very good.

WOW!  Thank you for this great recipe!  These are WAY BETTER than the original oatmeal peanut butter girl scout cookies, and so easy to make!!  I baked until very light brown, then they stayed a bit chewy after they cooled. DELICIOUS and addicting!  :O)

Honestly the best peanut butter cookie I've ever made and I've made quite a few!  They're good with the filling and without.  I have to disagree with some other reviewers though.  If you double the cookie recipe, which I did, you also need to double the filling.  Anyhow, it's a great recipe and it will be in rotation at my house!

I made this for a meeting and was asked several times to make this for other families.  The only cookies left that night were the few which didn't fit on the platter and had to stay at home.  My husband ate them promptly.  I am not a fan of peanut butter but for those who are, this is a very popular recipe!!

Excellent, though not enough filling. The bottoms of my cookies were brown and crunchy - I baked them for 8 min. Might reduce the time I kept them on the sheet from ~>5 min to 1 min plus bake them for 6-7min as I like cookies that are soft. Good news is that once placed in an airtight container, overnight the bottoms became softer. Got very good reviews from wife's coworkers. Great recipe, very rich peanut taste.

Best cookies I have ever made! I didn't even make the cream filling- these were perfect all by themselves!

The cookie itself was delish, especially with the oats.  Gave it a different texture, however, this is a very fattening cookie, especially with the creamy center... butter AND heavy whipping cream?  I did make the center and my husband and son said it didnt add anything to the cookie so I now make them w/no creamy middle.  The cookie itself is great tho!!!

These go overkill on the peanut butter, in my opinion.  Rich peanut butter cookie with rich peanut butter filling and another rich peanut butter cookie made it ... too much peanut butter.  I think a light cream filling would have made these a lot nicer.  It definitely would add uniqueness and variety to the flavor.  However, the cookies by themselves were excellent.  Great flavor and texture.  Just didn't like the filling.

These. Are. Delicious!  As a variation, I added dark cocoa powder to the filling to make chocolate pb cream, and it is amazing.

These taste just like I remember the GS cookies tasting. Yum!  Family devoured these almost before I could get one!  Fortunately, I doubled the recipe and have more dough in the fridge to make more soon.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  Thanks for sharing it Joanne!

These are incredible, and I'm not even a huge PB cookie fan. my boyfriend said they're the best cookies he's ever had! mine were done sooner than 10 minutes.. the ones i left in for 10 minutes were still good but a little bit darker on bottom than i wanted. at about 8 minutes the next batch was perfect! so just watch them. i did press them down a little bit with a fork before baking to make sure they were flat for the sandwich effect (but still chewy! so good)

Excellent.  I just made the cookies (didn't fill them) but I'm sure they'd be great filled too.  I used crunchy peanut butter.  These taste VERY close to GS cookies!

My husband and I loved these cookies. I am actually making them again for all of our friends who are coming tonight. I didn't make the frosting, but instead spread some strawberry jam on them. It was very good! I also left them plain as well and they were very good that way as well. This is going in my faves file!

I did not add the filling, just the plain cookie is so good. My teenage daughter and her friend enjoyed several warm from the oven after school, they said they were delicious.  I made a double batch so we'd have plenty.

DELICIOUS!! These were a big hit at our Super Bowl party. If you love peanut butter cookies,you definitely have to try this recipe! It doesn't even come close to any other recipe that I have ever used. To save on calories, I served the filling on the side to be spread on individual cookies. The recipe does make a large amount of filling, you may want to halve the recipe as I did. Cookies are delicious without the filling as well. Bake just until light brown on bottom.

Very good. I think the dough tastes exactly like the Girl Scout cookie, but I don't agree that the finished product tastes lie them. It is still good, just not the same. I had to bake these cookies at least 15 minutes on my stoneware and decided pressing them down with my fingers was much easier (and nicer looking) than using a fork. If I make these again, I think I may just leave out the filling. The cookies themselves are excellent without it!

This recipe was EXCELLENT!  I doubled the recipe so I could have extras to give away to family and got nothing but raves.  I doubled the icing as well but didn't use it all, but definitely over half.  This recipe goes in the stack of favorites and will be made again.

use milk or cream.  Drop by teaspoonfuls.  Should get about 24 sandwiches in single recipe.  Great graham sub in s'mores.

These cookies are fun to make, and delicious.  They are a little to sweet for me and my husband.  Next time  I think I'll put in 1/4 cup of white sugar and see if thats better.

Yum!  These cookies sure satisfy the peanut butter lover in me!  I also doubled the cookie recipe, but never got to making the filling.. family started eating them as soon as they came off the cookie sheet.  Can't imagine how much better they can possibly be!  Updated review: Filled the cookies this time and it intensified the peanut butter flavor!  Now I rate this 5 stars!

These cookies are excellent! The only change I made was to use skim milk instead of cream in the filling(worked great). Also, I made them smaller then specified and was able to get 48 cookies out of the batch (24 fully assembled). I had to flatten them slightly before baking as they would have stayed puffy if I hadn't. I use a stoneware pan whenever I make cookies. Just make sure you cool it down between batches. I've had many requests for this recipe!

These cookies were good, I felt that the filling was a little sweet.  I made some cookies without the filling and they were just as good.  COOKS NOTE-- these cookies spread while baking.  My first batch were huge.

For those of you not having as many cookies as the recipe states, you are making them the wrong size.  You need to make them by the teaspoon, NOT a standard cookie baller.  If you do, you will have the noted quantity.  These turned out faulous.  Everyone raved about them.  Next time I'm going to cut the filling in half since I had plenty left over.  And there WILL be a next time.  So easy to make and so delicious.

I inadvertently doubled the butter in the cookie (not the filling) and drizzled the assembled cookie sandwiches with melted semisweet chocolate.  The resulting cookies were very crisp and Delicious.  My guests raved about them.  The filling is so good, I might double it next time around.

This were excellent.  I used margarine, not butter.  Although I would have had about 15 sandwiches, only had 11 by the time I got around to making the frosting. They were delicious without and even better with! Had plenty of filling.  Can't wait to try one reviewers idea of dipping them in chocolate

Mmm mmm! Made these for the first time today and they were a hit w/ the whole family.  Made them according to the recipe and they're perfect as far as I'm concerned, but I'm no gourmet chef!

If I can give this recipe a 4.5 I would.  The taste is delicious; however it does not yield as much as the recipe says. I doubled the recipe and flattened the cookies half way to try to make as much as I could. I am also going to drizzle the pb mixture on top instead of making sandwiches to have a bigger yield. Hopefully my guests will enjoy them!

Very good, very easy.  I used a teaspoon measuring spoon and got quite a few finished cookies (36).  I also put two chocolate chips on the underside of warm cookies until melted, and spread it out before putting the cookies together.

These cookies are insanely delicious and decadent.  I used all natural peanut butter for both the cookies and frosting and it still tasted delicious.  I made a couple of changes to the frosting just because of what I had on hand.  I used about 1/3 stick of cream cheese, 3/4 cup of powdered sugar, 1/2 cup of peanut butter and a tbsp of cream.  I'm sure these are just as awesome with the suggested frosting but I wanted to use up some cream cheese I had.  I would also make sure to flatten the cookies because they won't flatten totally without doing so.  I dipped my fork in sugar so it wouldn't stick to the cookies.  I also found no need to refrigerate the dough.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I can't wait for my family to try them.

So easy and so yummy! For an even easier filling just use peanutbutter and honey. In some stores (Kroger's store brand) you can buy it already mixed in a jar!

Crazy good!!  I changed the amount to yield 18 cookies and still got more than that, probably around 30 "sandwiches."  Definitely a keeper.

I have made these several times now and this is a very good cook recipe it has a nice peanut butter favor my family really enjoyed them. I did make a couple of small changes; i put the oats through my food processor and pulsed for a few seconds becasuse the kids said they were chewing oats when they bit into the cookie...i also cut the sugar down to a total of 3/4 cup between the brown and white sugar and they are perfect.

So good! I made them for my friend for Christmas and I might take some to work for out potluck...maybe I might keep them for myself!. The only thing I wish I could figure out how to make them more bite size I think they would be better if there wasn't so much in one cookie.

DELICIOUS!  Every person that I gave these to for Christmas loved them. I made sandwhiches out of one batch, and left the 2nd batch just plain cookies and they are really good without the "icing" as well.  Yum!

These aren't close to the girl scout cookies...they are way better! Taking the advice of other reviewers, I doubled the cookie recipe but did not double the filling. First time I made this without the filling as I didn't have powdered sugar. 
The filling truly makes this cookie! I used 3 tablespoons half and half (I had no heavy cream) and I let it whip and get fluffy and delicious.
I prefer softer texture, so I baked the cookies for 8 min, pulled out of oven, remained on cookie sheet for 2-3 min before transfering to cooling racks. Try these, and make the filling! I will keep powdered sugar on hand from now on.

These verge on being too rich for me, but they are really good. I made using regular oats instead of quick-cooking, and half-and-half instead of cream, but followed the recipe as directed otherwise. I do recommend flattening the dough with a fork. The cookies still puff up some, but I found that tamping them lightly with a spatula as soon as they come out of the oven makes them flat. I used parchment paper as well and let them cool on the counter (on the paper) for a bit before moving them to cooling racks. That really helped them not crumble or break.

I had family over for dinner tonight and made these cookies. They were the absolute best!!! My cousin and fiance couldn't stop eating them! My cousin made sure I had enough so he could take some home.  I'm making these this Christmas to give to my friends and family.

My husband is a HUGE peanut butter fan and he's very picky about what kind of peanut butter cookies he likes. I made him these and he LOVED them! The only thing I would change is the amount of sugar and the amount in general of the frosting because they could easily overwhelm the cookie. I barely used half the called amount and it was plenty.

This was great. I made it slightly healthier with a few tweaks. Use 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup regular flour. Use 3/4 cup of peanut butter and 1/4 cup of yogurt based butter and leave the egg yolk out. The cookies were still fantastic.

These cookies turned out reallly good!  The cooking time was perfect for me.  I doubled the dough and ended up with 26 sandwich cookies and 19 regular cookies.  I would recommend these to anyone who loves peanut butter cookies!!

Wow.  What a great cookie.  I just made the cookie part of this recipe and they are unbelievable.  Not greasy, like I read in another review.  Perfect.  I used natural peanut butter.  The cookie turned out more peanut buttery than sweet.  The perfect peanut butter cookie!

Good cookie recipe to make with simple ingredients that I always have on hand. I made these as directed, but without the filling because I didn't have any heavy cream. They taste good with creamy peanut butter sandwiched in the middle! Thanks for the recipe.

These were good but they are not the end all be all of peanut butter cookies. They are actually better the next day. My husband and I are huge peanut butter fans so after reading these rave reviews we dashed to the kitchen to make them.  We were a little disappointed... of course that didn't stop us from eating all of them!

Very good and very easy...I love that this recipe uses quick oats because I usually have those on hand. This made about 8 sandwich cookies so 16 individuals cookies, but they were very large. The frosting is so good and if you don't have heavy whipping cream, I have used milk before and it tastes just as good!

Absolutely Delicious!  I cut the sugar by a fourth for high altitude, and they came out perfect.  These are unique and irresistible.

I made some modifications to these so they might have been better otherwise.  They came out very soft but not chewy at all, completely crumbly.  The flavor is great but most 5 star reviews said they were chewy.  I might have overcooked them but they did not look done.  I used more brown sugar than white and used half veg oil for butter.  I will keep looking.

These are awesome!  I used a small ice cream scoop and didn't flatten them.  I cooked them just until the edges started turning brown, then I let them cool for about 3-4 minutes on the cookie sheet.  The flattened out to a perfect thickness- the outside was a little crispy, the inside chewy.  You've gotta try these!

These are SOOOO good!  I only had 3/4 c. oats (not the 1 c. called for), and they still turned out beautifully.  I got 20 sandwiches.  I took the cookies out after 8 minutes and probably could've taken them out sooner.  Also, I used milk instead of the whipping cream.  Next time I may try adding some jelly to the middles, in addition to the peanut butter filling.

Cookies were delicious and sweet! I followed the directions almost exactly. The only differences were that I used skim milk instead of cream like other users have, and I doubled the cookie dough recipe like another user suggested. It turns out I also needed to double the cream to compensate. I also only baked each batch for ~5 minutes. I made ~50 or more cookies, way more than I expected! But it seemed a hit. Thanks.

I just made the cookies without the filling in the middle and they were great all by themselves.  They baked up thin and that perfect balance between chewy and crispy.

This cookie is one of the BEST! It's so soft and chewy (just the way i like it). It's sooo tasty. I just added another 2 tbsp of peanut butter and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and the result is VERY GOOD. My boyfriend, who is fond of chocolate cookies and not of peanut butter, can't believe on how he loves these cookies! I think i can just sit and eat this all alone.

Wow, so good. If you want them to be the same size as the Girl Scout version, make sure you stick to teaspoon-size when spooning them onto the cookie sheet - NOT heaping spoonfuls.

Delicious peanut butter cookie. It looked from the picture that they were alot bigger I was surprised that it says to only drop 1 tsp of dough. I think next time i will make them bigger. The cookies turned out wonderful and the filling was delicious also.  Kids love them. You could probably add some jam to the fillinf to make a pbj cookie.

These were pretty good, though i don't like pb cookies personally~i think the idea is to really flatten the cookies when you bake them~i added honey to the filling and it was nice!

Wow, these are awesome.  I added about a half-cup of chopped dates which gave them a kinda toffee-like flavor.  I also only baked them for 9 minutes.  I didn't flatten them out before baking....they flatten themselves after cooling for a few minutes on the cookie sheet.  They don't spread out too much so I could bake 12 at a time.

My hubby loves these! We were looking for a good peanutbuttery cookie and these more than satisfied his craving! They are our new favorite cookie! They were easy and I used old fashioned oats as well, they turned out perfect. I recommend making them small. Thank you! (I didn't use the filling)

These things are addicting!!!  They were easy to make, light, flavorful and a real treat.  My husband liked the filling so well he iced the top of his with the leftover filling.  I'm going to use the filling for icing cupcakes.  I've been baking for 43 years and this is one of the best cookies I've had come out of my oven. MMMMMMMMM!!

These cookies are wonderful! Easily adjust cookie texture by changing size and/or cooking time. My 3 year old and I love the filling, but my hubby devoured his plain!

Great recipe!!  
Hint: Use shortening to cover the bottom of the pan.  For the first batch, I used baking spray and the ends burnt.  Also, I undercooked them so they would remain soft.   The filling is wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious, only change I made was to add 1 cup peanut butter, instead of 1/2 cup  along with the 1 cup powdered sugar and cream for the filling, just cause I wanted it more peanutty !!

Very nice cookie and quite easy to make. I substituted 1/2 and 1/2 for whipping cream and the filling turned out just fine.  These turn out best if you bake one pan at a time and keep a good eye on it.  You don't want them to overbake.
