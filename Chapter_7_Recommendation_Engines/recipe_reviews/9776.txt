I totally disagree with the negative reviews - I'm rating 5 stars not because these are amongst the best cookies I've made but they certainly are great for the prep time - those who said they are too crumbly may have flattened too much or overcooked - stick to about 3/4 inch - they should just be light brown on the underside  - I finished mine with milk and icing sugar icing and sprinkled fresh orange zest on top and they were a nice light treat - also, I used regular butter, not unsalted - butter cookies really need some salt.  GIve these cookies a chance - I hadn't read the negative reviews before making them or I would have skipped the recipe.

light yes, but they are crumbly and fall apart even as you eat them.  there is a decent butter taste but definitely not worth making again.

After reading all the reviews, I was a bit skeptical about trying this recipe, but I did anyways because this recipe had all the ingredients that were left in my pantry. I altered it a bit by adding an extra 1/4 cup of sugar, a teaspoon of ground cinnamon, and an egg. They came out perfect! My niece did pour sprinkles on a couple of the cookies, however, even the plain ones turned out great. Keep in mind, these are butter cookies. So don't expect a moist flavorful cookie. These are more light and savory.

Quick and easy cookies that the whole family loves! I added about a teaspoon of vanilla and a chocolate chip on top and the kids beg me for them.

This is really similar to "polvorones" which are really supposed to be really crumbly. As for a taste issue I rolled them up into more of a ball, made an indent in the top with my finger and filled it with the small circular sprinkles. and it adds both a subtle taste that works well with the butter and a interesting texture.

I liked the cookies but like other reviews, the had taste issues. So when the cookies came out of the oven I cooled them off and added frosting. It gives the cookies more flavor as well as color.

Light, fluffy, buttery and delicious.  

These were terrific cookies, easy to make and great tasting.  I used salted butter and an electric mixer.  

I rolled the balls in sugar before I flattened them with a fork.  I also lowered the temp to 350.

These cookies turned out great! Very buttery and yummy. I put raspberry jam in the middle before baking. I used all real butter and didn't have a problem with crumbling.

These tasted good, but immediately fell apart when taken off the cookie sheets. And I followed the recipe. VERY disappointing, as I wanted to give them as gifts with other cookies. Will never make them again - waste of butter.

Very yummy, just came out of the oven and are exactly what I was looking to make. Batter was a little flowery for my taste, but I added maple extract and that took care of it. (Was out of almond and will try it next time.) Very good and would definitely recommend.

I didn’t have enough butter and used little but if peanut butter. I love almonds, so I added crushed one. Its really Powderly,so its very difficult to make it round and put it on tray. My arm muscle is exhausted. Besides that, I made 45 small cookies, all taste great, Powderly cookie is actually my favorite now. I love that ingredients are so simple when you have nothing in your kitchen.

I loved these cookies! I did add a bit of vanilla and sprinkled a tad of sugar on top. They were just the right amount of sweetness for me and made a great evening snack for the family!

I don't understand the bad reviews, these cookies are delicious and very simple to make! Very light and buttery. But be careful not to overbake them or they will fall apart.
