I used Pacific organic free range chicken broth, skipped the sugar and these greens turned out delicious. They were as good or better than any I've had. I used kosher salt, which tastes more salty than regular or sea salt, 1/4 teaspoon was the perfect amount.

This was the first time I ever tried making turnip greens. This recipe was easy to follow and produce turnip greens my entire family went crazy for. My six year old wanted thirds. I will make these for thanksgiving. Excellent!!

I made collard greens instead of turnips. First time making them, I found this recipe among many others, but thought this one sounded the best,I did add 1/2 onion and 1/2 c. yellow peppers and a slice of bacon mixed all together and let simmer about an hour. will definitely make again.

Lord don’t mess up a good bunch of turnips with oily olive oil.  If you want greens without fat, just boil with a pinch of salt and serve with pepper vinegar.  Don’t forget the cornbread to sop up the pot liquor.

Excellent! The only thing I did different was less sugar ( about 2 tbsps). Tastes just like my grandmother used to make. Thank you!

Delicious! I added 1/4 tsp of minced garlic and 2 tsp of bacon bits. This is my first time ever cooking greens of any kind - delicious! I simmered for 45 minutes (slightly smaller batch than recipe).

I made this with the chicken broth. I felt no need for the sugar.  It was delicious and tasty, one just wants to continue to reach for more. My greens were so tender, they were ready in 30 minutes.

A great base recipe to add to! With some tweaks, the greens were delicious; there were no left overs. I used chicken-flavored bone broth since I didn't have chicken broth. I also used canola oil, since I didn't have olive oil on hand. It was too bland with just salt and pepper (my husband likes a lot of flavors), so I added more ingredients to it like smoked paprika, cayenne, mined onion, and apple cider vinegar.

I made this without the oil or sugar.  Didn't chop the greens either.  Hate to admit this, but I ate them before dinner was finished cooking.  Oh well.  I loved them!

I'm in the process of learning how to cook. My husband usually tells me if  my food is good or bad. When I cook this for him, he went back for thirds! It was so good! I followed the recipe to the tee, and it had great flavor! definitely will use this recipe again!

Used the stock from the turkey I was baking instead, but kept everything (also used collard greens) else the same.  I think it came out well.  I'm sure my hubs will love it.

I made a few changes, I added smoked paprika (add to taste), Webber's garlic and herb seasoning, Lowery's season salt, coriander (around a teaspoon), and a pinch of kosher salt.  I also added sautéed onions, red, orange and yellow sweet bell peppers and omitted the sugar. When adding the salt, add to taste.  Trying to get away from adding meat to greens, which I've done for years. This is a great recipe, I would definitely recommend it.

My first greens recipe! Turned out great.  As the author suggested, added 1/2 cup onion and a clove of garlic.  I only used a bit of the sugar, maybe 1/4 teaspoon and it was enough.

Delicious. I did add some onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms waited in a bit of bacon grease. Definitely used less grease than I would have in the past, so it was still kinda healthy?

Followed the recipe exactly and the greens came out very salty. Without the salt they would have been tasty.

Very good, did not miss the meat used 1 cup concentrated homemade chicken broth and 1 cup water to 1 1/2 lbs of fresh turnip greens and one root.  Delicious.

Added a little hot sauce and crushed red pepper. Was pleasantly surprised how good it tasted. Thank you.

My husband loves all things spicy, so we add garlic and  a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Bang!

This recipe had the perfect ratio of broth and water to the two bunches of turnip greens that i had. The 1/2 tsp. of sugar was just right, no sweet taste, but no bitter taste to the greens at all!  May have helped that I blanched the turnip greens before following the recipe.  I used 1 T. butter and 2 T. bacon drippings instead of the olive oil, which cancels out some of the  healthy, and added 1/2 - 1 tsp. more salt , but that was the flavor my family was expecting.   Even my greens haters liked it!
