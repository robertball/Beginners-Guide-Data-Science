Awesome & easy for moms w/babies; I've made it every year for Christmas for 4 years.  Word to the wise:  Pipe it into mini paper cups so you don't have to cut this stuff. It's pretty hard to cut into nice little pieces.

Extremely easy.  However, the flavor was just average, and it did not cut uniformly into squares - pieces splintered into jagged pieces.  Will not make again.

This was one of the best and easiest desserts I have ever made!!!! I cannot belive how easy and super fast it was to make! It was absolutely great! I made it for Christmas and everyone said they loved it!! People couldn't stop eating it! I am going to make a double batch next time because I only had a couple pieces left over.

Absolutely simple recipe... They were wonderful! I added milk choc chips and about twice as much rice krispies! Great way to fool people by how good yet simple these are.

My husband is a big peanut butter and chocolate fan, so he flipped over this recipe. Better yet, everyone who tried it thought I'd spent all day in my kitchen making fudge... I refused to tell them I'd really only spent a few minutes melting chocolate chips in my microwave. This is VERY rich, so cut into small pieces and arrange on a pretty candy tray.

I made this in a cooking competition and it won a rosette in the candy division. I personally thought it lacked a little something, but it was very pretty cut up into shapes with mini cookie cutters, and drizzled with melted chocolate over the top.

Great recipe. I made this for our superbowl party, but we started snacking on it before the party even started. Peanut butter & chocolate is one of our favorites. Very easy to make.

OH MY GOD!  Yummy!  It's the Crunch bar I never had as a child.  I was able to use butter instead of the wax paper and the candy still turned out fine.

Too sweet for me, but a hit with the troops.  After all the comments about the sweetness, I used 2 squares (2 oz) of unsweetened chocolate instead of the semi-sweet chips.  I also used a rounded cup of cereal.  After making 2 pans of mini-muffins in paper, I had some left over so I just dropped it by spoonfuls on waxed paper.  It held its shape fine, and that's how I'll do it next time.  They look kind of lumpy like turtle candy.  Anyway, I had some Reese's mini-chips, and I thought that would go with the peanut butter and chocolate, so I put about 1/8 a cup in the last half of the batch.  The troops like it both ways about the same.  These are for christmas tins so we'll frost a squiggle in 2 different colors, probably melted butterscotch chips for the ones with the Reeses, and dark chocolate for the others.  Anyway, a popular and fast filler for candy tins.  Thanks!

Made this for a party with guests who had dietary restrictions.  It was simple, ingredients on hand, and guests loved it.  I added pecans to the top as it cooled and used a knife to cut in more chocolate stripes for color.  Peanut butter lovers raved.

I really liked the taste of this.  I just added a few touches of my own to copy something similar I use to buy at a chocolate shop.  Instead of 1/2 a cup of rice crispies, I added a heaping cup.  I also added a cup of mini marshmallows once the mix cooled some.  And once this mix was in the pan I sprinkled mini semi-sweet chocolate chips on top.  Very sweet but people seem to really enjoy it this way.

I originally made this because I was in a hurry and needed a quick snack for my family. What I discovered was that it actually tastes good, too. What more could you ask for?

Delicious! I used the suggested petit-fours-cups method and they turned out perfectly. For variation I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy and milk chocolate instead of semisweet.

I made this recipe for someone, and even though they are not a peanut butter lover, they loved this recipe.  Also, instead of using white chocolate, I used vanilla almond bark.  It still came out wonderfully.  You almost can't mess this one up.  Great!

This gets a four for taste, but a three overall because the color was odd. Next time I may try some of the layering techniques described in the other tiger butter recipes.

This recipe was very easy and can be easily varied to suit personal tastes. 1 minute in my microwave was not enough to melt anything, so I used two 1 minute bursts, stirring in between, and then chilled it in the fridge to expedite the cooling. I think it tastes best that way, otherwise it gets to melt-y. Tasty, but nothing special, it was also difficult to cut into nice squares, it mostly just broke into jagged pieces. My co-workers gobbled it up!

Pretty good, but not anything too spectacular.  Just tasted like a crispy, melted peanut butter cup.  If I need a quick treat to take to the kids' school or something, I'll probably make this or something like it.  Otherwise, I'll waste my calories on something with a little something extra.

Took this to work and was everybodies favorite nurse! My 4 year old daughter helped me make my first batch.  It was so simple and fun.  It tastes just as good as the Sees fudge that my granny spends hours making.

This is a delicious, easy recipe.  I recommend using the mini baking cups and drizzling chocolate on top.  Wrapped in decorative cellophane, they are gourmet holiday treats!

Very good, and so simple! The flavor is pretty basic--nothing exciting or fancy, but since it only takes 3 minutes to make, who cares? Absolutely perfect if you need to bring something to a party or potluck and have no time to makes something more elaborate. I melted semisweet chocolate chips and a few tablespoons of margarine together and drizzled it over the top in stripes before cutting it into pieces-- it made it look a little bit more attractive.

We thought this was pretty good. For us they were a little too rich and didn't have enough peanut butter flavor. We liked the addition of the Rice Krispies, but I would double those next time because there weren't enough of them. After we tried it, I went back and added melted semi-sweet chocolate on top, and we liked that a lot more. The color as is is kind of odd and unappetizing, so the chocolate cut the richness and also made them look more appetizing. It was so easy to make so that was great; I look forward to experimenting with the recipe to suit our individual tastes.

Very sweet, so make these small!  They are good, but just taste like some sort of peanut butter fudge.  I didn't have a 9x9 pan or waxed paper, so I used a 7 x7 pan and some saran wrap, worked fine.  Also used white almond bark.  Very easy recipe if you need a quick treat!
