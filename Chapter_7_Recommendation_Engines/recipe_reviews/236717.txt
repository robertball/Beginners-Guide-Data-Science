Very delicious and.  Maureen you should do more research before submitting a negative score on someone's recipe. Oats are gluten free unless cross contaminated. Thanks for this recipe :D

Good recipe, especially for GF. I was low on butter so I used 1/2 cup coconut oil, 1/2 cup butter. Also had mostly steel cut oats so they were a little more grainy in texture. Substituted GF all-purpose flour for total of flours and cornstarch (2 1/2 c), as well as Truvia in place of white sugar. I added chocolate chips/chunks to make them more appealing to the kids. I'll make this again.

My recipe, but hey, I think they are terrific! Oats are gluten free if you buy them certified that way, Joyce. If you baked your cookies and they spread out too much, then next time let the dough sit in the fridge a little while, so that the oats can plump up.

I used coconut oil instead of butter and rice flour instead of sorghum. Best cookies I've had in forever.

Delicious is right!
Making my third batch. Due to allergies, substituted a safe-for-me gluten free flour blend for all 2.5 cups of flours and some ground vanilla bean (whisked into the dry stuff) for the vanilla extract. I noticed the recipe has baking soda but no liquid acidic ingredient to start the rising action. So I substituted 2.5 teaspoons of corn-free baking powder for the baking soda. It made a terrific difference in texture! They are lighter now and stay tender, as long as you don't overbake them, which I'm prone to do. I broke with tradition and added the raisins to the creamed ingredients to hydrate them a bit before added the flours and oats. Easier on my mixing arm and plumper raisins in the end.
My friends don't realize these are GF!

I love this recipe! I used gluten free all purpose flour mix  and half butter half coconut oil. I reduced white sugar to half cup and  added raisins and choc chips gluten free. They were so good my kids could not tell they were gluten free.

I cut the recipe in half and it turned out perfect. I forgot to put the corn starch in and they still taste great. Don't know what the difference corn starch would make. I used gluten flour instead of all the individual flours. I also used honey instead of white sugar. Dough was a bit runny so I added more oatmeal. Maybe 1/4 cup. Will certainly make again. I got 19 cookies.

oatmeal is not gluten free.  Rolled oats have gluten in it.  You would have to use a gluten free hto cereal like quinoa flakes or rice bits.
