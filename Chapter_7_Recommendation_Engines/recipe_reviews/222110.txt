Maggie I would take a good guess that the raw sugar would be used when the dough was rolled into balls then you would dip the top part into the sugar for decoration .. if you waited until after they had baked the sugar would fall off .. I had an old recipe that called for rolling the dough balls in white sugar and then they would have a crackled top when they had cooked.. Hope this helps.. Dena :)

When do you add raw sugar? I omitted it and added about 1" grated ginger root. Cookies were very soft but did harden up once they had cooled. Very good recipe!

These are wonderful!  I did not roll and refrigerate, but baked immediately.  Omitted the raw sugar and it wasn't missed at all!  I made larger cookies (14) and baked them for 14 minutes.  Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside....perfection!  Thanks!

I made the cookies a little bit healthier by doing half a stick of butter and I melted that then with the butter I added in 6oz Apple sauce! This was one of the most delicious cookies I've ever made????

These are delicious! However, I put a little twist on the recipe. I chopped some candied ginger and mixed into the batter. Yummy!

I made this recipe gluten free by using a gluten free flour blend instead of the two flours listed here. It worked great and the flavor was really good. The cookies were a bit heavy, but that was probably the GF flour mix. Definitely will add this to our cookie roster.

I made this with 1 tbl minced ginger in wet ingredients and increased the cinnamon. Gives these cookies more flavour

This recipe is wonderful. I was looking for soft ginger cookies for my husband. I didn't tell him they are a healthier version. He loves these cookies. After reading someone else's suggestion, I added 1 tablespoon orange juice instead of the water. I am glad I did. It certainly brings out the ginger flavor. I will make these cookies again and again.

Cookies turned out great. Recipe was easy and I did chill the dough before baking cookies didn't crack but were soft & chewy just the way I like them. I had to make them small because they were for a "Tea Party baby shower" Next time will make bigger!!

I made these using a GF 1:1 flour. I also used my homemade pumpkin pie spice (3 tsp) and it was very good. I noticed it to be a bit grainy, but that could be the GF flour. I topped them with Hershey's kisses.

As all the comments say, you should double the spices to make it taste even better :) I was running out of whole-wheat flour and just substituting the flour with  all purpose flour and realise that I should just click the other recipe because the big soft ginger cookies recipe didn't use the whole wheat flour :')
But nevertheless, this is a good recipe if only you double the spices :D

Soft but not as yummy as my older ginger cookie recipe. Not sure I'll make these again.

Not sure what I did wrong here, followed the recipe but they came out harder than I thought and little!  Baked for 10 min as suggested, the balls were a little over an inch in diameter...does anyone who is smarter than me have any ideas on what went wrong? Help!  Flavour is good though, just size and texture went sideways!

I followed the recipe but used margarine.  These are delicious!  You definitely can't tell that there's whole wheat flour.  Nice texture, nice density, great flavor.
