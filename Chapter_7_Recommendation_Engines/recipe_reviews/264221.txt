I changed the recipe by adding three big spoonfuls of bacon grease and I did not add the sugar to the recipe.   It turned out delicious.

I didn't have any walnuts, so I used sunflower seeds. That's the only change I made. I will probably make this again. 
I could not, however, figure out why it's so high in carbs. The only reason I can see is the cranberries, but, even then, you get only a couple of cranberries in a serving of salad.

Review is under my picture.  Small changes.  Spam instead of sausage.  Steamable package of fresh brussel sprouts, cut then shredded them.  Toasted my own walnuts.  Used only purple onion asked for, not shallots.  So good.
