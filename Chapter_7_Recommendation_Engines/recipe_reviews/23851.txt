this recipe is really wonderful. It gets 5 stars for ease of preparation and another 5 stars for fantastic flavor. I did follow the advice of some other reviewers, I used chicken broth instead of water, added a couple of cloves of garlic and reduced the salt for 1 tablespoon to 1 teaspoon...*****

This was so easy & yummy.  I used 1 Tbl of Olive Oil instead of butter, chicken broth instead of water & the spicy green olives from the olive bar at the grocery store.  It was spicy & yummy.  My boyfriend told me we should have this at least once a week!  And it took almost no effort and even less if you use frozen choppen onion & green pepper.

Great-tasting one-dish chicken recipe!  I cut way back on the salt (did you REALLY mean 1 tablespoon, or is that a typo?), used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, & added another half cup of water to help cook the rice.  My husband and I both loved it - I will make this again.

This would have been really good however the rice was not done in 1 hour and I had to keep adding water in order for the rice to cook which took away from the flavor that it was intended to have.  I will try this again but start the rice first and wait until the rice is almost done then add all the ingredients.

This recipe was incredible!  I added fresh chopped garlic and instead of water, I used chicken broth and white wine.  I don't eat rice, but partner does, so she made rice on the side and I just ate the mixture and the flavor was delicious!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This was so easy and so tasty. Used diced tomatoes and broth instead of water. Make sure to push the chicken down in to the rice mixture while cooking so that flavours permeate the meat. A little crushed red pepper would spice it up a little.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! I served it on top of penne pasta (no rice and of course less water then) and it was fabulous! My husband even liked it and he is a plain old red meat and potatoes kind of guy. I will definitely make it again!

The rice gets a bit mushy, but the flavor is excellent.  I used 1 tbsp canola oil instead of the butter.

I thought this recipe was awesome! I basically followed the recipe except I used chicken broth instead of water, fresh mushrooms, a whole 5oz jar of sliced green olives with the juice, and I always mess up the rice (cooks to long = mush; too short = crunchy) so I just made some spanish yellow rice separate and it went great together. Next time I would add a small can of tomato paste to make it thicker.  This recipe has a wonderful flavor, thanks Michelleca!

This was FANTASTIC! I kept the recipe pretty much the same, only less water as I cooked the rice apart from the chicken. I also added 2 table spoons of minced garlic. I substitued white rice with some long grain brown rice. With a home full of picky eaters, it was a success! Quick, easy and super yummy ..this is def. going into our rotation. Next time I might go easy on the tomatoes and make more of a stir-fry out of it. 5 stars from our family! Thanks for sharing!

The flavor was excellent. I used more green olives than called for because we love them.  Used brown rice instead of white and I should have cooked it a bit before hand. My 9 year old ate as much as my husband did!

Added a dash of cumin to the chicken, seared the chicken before adding to sauce, and substituted canned tomato with tomato sauce.  Delicious.  Excellent on pasta.

Loved it. I used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of water, I thought with the amount of time it had to simmer the extra liquid would help with the rice and the broth boosted the flavor. It was quick, easy and I loved it.

YUMMY! An olive lovers favorite. When finished it resembles a paella type meal - it tastes nothing like paella but looks like it. Very different but wonderful.

A great new way to cook chicken!  Used chicken thighs [browned a bit first and grease drained] and canned diced tomatoes and fresh shrooms.  I did have to add water during the cooking but it came out very well.   I probably used too much onion but I love 'em and I just got a fresh batch of this year's Vidalias.

This was a nice change. I was a little cautious with the thought of green olives cooked in a main dish, yet the flavors blended perfectly.

This sort of reminded me of an easy arroz con pollo.  The only thing missing were capers.  First off, mine cooked in way under 1 hour.  Second, I needed way more liquid.  About 20 minutes in I needed to add more and again 15 minutes later.  Next time I will use chicken stock and white wine (probably 2 Cups total)  One cup was not enough.  Using tomato sauce instead of the diced tomatoes would make it more authentic, but the diced was fine.  I actually chopped mine up more into smaller pieces.  Easy tasty meal...thanks!

Loved it!  The green olives are just a treat in this chicken and rice dish.  I portioned this out into individual portions and froze them for later consumption.  Freezes beautifully and makes a great, quick lunch.  I will make this again!

This turned out well and had very good flavor.  I added a can of chicken broth instead of the water, and reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon.

I used less salt, about 1t.  A nice one-dish meal.  My husband liked this more than I did -- I would have given it 3 stars.

Like another reviewer I used pasta instead of rice. It came out great other than being way too salty even though I used about half what was called for. I'd suggest adding salt at the table instead of in the recipe. The olives have enough of a salty flavor to do the dish justice. I'll make this again, but without so much salt.

This was a great recipe. I made it for friends and they all loved it. My husband enjoyed it the next day as well. I did make some changes as I found the recipe to be silly when asking you to drain and chop the tomatoes and then add a cup of water. Instead I used diced tomatoes with green peppers and used the juice as well. I found spicy diced tomatoes with peppers which added some spice to the dish. I omitted the mushrooms because I don't like them. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was a great easy dish to make.

I made this recipe.  I modified some based on comments.  I used a can of diced tomatoes, drained.  Used fresh mushrooms.  Used 1/2 cup of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of Chardonnay.  I didn't have green peppers so I added a can of green beans 1/2 way through.  I also used green olives given to me as a gift -- some were stuffed with garlic and some with jalapeño. A pleasant surprise while slicing them and YUM!  I did not add rice as we're watching carbs.  I sliced two large breasts into 6 pieces and buried them in the broth.  Cooked covered 20 min and turned the breasts over and cooked another 15-20 min.  I served it with fresh Parmesan and garlic crusty bread.  It was delicious!!!

My wife and I love this meal. We cut the salt out, and we use diced tomatoes. I love the way the green olives add flavor. pretty easy to make. We have this meal quite a bit.

LOVED this one!  I'll definitely make it again. Prepared pretty much as directed, except I didn't drain the tomatoes. Just added a little less water. The green olives add a nice tang to this dish!

I used olive oil instead of butter and added the chicken, which I diced, with the other vegetables and sauteed for a while. I only had pimento stuffed olives but it didn't matter. I also left out the salt because the olives were in brine. I partly cooked brown rice before adding it to the rest of the ingredients. This one is a keeper, thanks. I have also made this with canned tuna added in the last few minutes of cooking.

Ok, I really liked this dish. I love tomatoes and olives.  My family however was less impressed.  My husband (not a big tomatoe person) thought it had too many olives, and my girls only wanted the olives. I didn't cook the rice in the dish, I just made it on the side so I reduced the liquid in it. I did about 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of white wine. I think I put a bay leaf in also. Oh, and only cooked for 30 min. Didn't alter any more than that. I will make this again someday, but not as often as I would like because of family's preferences.

This was good! Very juicy chicken. I read other reviews and omitted the salt. I wish I hadn't though. I think it would have been better with it. The sauce was still very watery after the rice and chicken were done cooking so I added some minute rice to absorb the excess moisture. It worked great!

This was full of great flavors.  The next time I make it I will reduce the cooking time as simmering for the full hour made the chicken a bit on the dry side.  Still, a great recipe.  Thanks!

a little salty, maybe use less salt than recipe states.
