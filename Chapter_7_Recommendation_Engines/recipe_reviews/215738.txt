Excellent! I used regular sun-dried tomatoes and non-fat Greek yogurt.  Despite the fact that this is made with a mere handful of ingredients, this dip is packed with flavor.  Served on a veggie tray but the savory would go great with crackers, too.

I was skeptical about this one, but I'm really glad I tried it.  I think it tastes best once it sits for about an hour.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent light tasting dip and best served with vegetables - at least for us.    Will be made often. Thanks for an inventive recipe.

This dip is delicious! I didn't have all of the ingredients (walnuts, onion, fresh basil) so I improvised a bit.  I used a sundried tomato tapenade, garlic, dried basil and greek yogurt and it still tastes wonderful. Thanks for posting this!

This dip is delicious and different. Not at all difficult to make. I particularly liked it on Belgian endive leaves. Thanks!

This was good, but not a favorite.  I made this as written and it had lots of flavor, just can't put my finger on why we didn't just love it.

Excellent! The only change I made was to add some fresh grated pecorino romano (hence 4 stars instead of 5), and it was excellent! Perfect accompaniment for my veggie platter, and I'll bet it's good with crusty bread too^_^

I had high hopes for this being an interesting combination of ingredients and healthy. I made this exactly as stated and felt it was overpowering and not attractive. I took it to Book Club and it was barely touched.

This recipe looked promising, lots of great ingredients, however I was very disappointed - this dip tastes very unpleasant. I think chopping everything so finely in the food processor is a bad idea. The garlic and tomatoes were overpowering,even after refrigerating several hours for the flavors to blend, and the miniscule bits of toasted walnuts gave a nasty grainy texture.

My roommate is allergic to nuts, since I was making this dip for the both of us, I substituted walnuts for unsalted sunflower seeds. It was good but since I used the amount that called for walnuts (with unsalted sunflower seeds instead) it was a little much, I'd make it 1/2 to 3/4 of the amount called for, if using sunflower seeds. This dip makes for a very interesting flavor, my palette was somewhat confused it is sweet and savory!

Yummy!  JUST made it and it's so good!  I bet after it sits for awhile it will be even better!  Might try this as a dressing on a wrap.
