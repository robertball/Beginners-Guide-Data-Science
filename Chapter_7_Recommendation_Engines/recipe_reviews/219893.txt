Great recipe! I like to process canned black beans in my food processor until they are the semi-chunky consistency of refried beans. It gives everyone the expected texture of the refried beans found in the full-fat version of Seven Layer Dip.

Really very good. I loved the comparative lightness of this recipe. Made as described except for omitting the corn and using only half of the pepper. Thank you.

Excellent!  Brought it to 4 th of July bbq...didn't tell anyone it was "skinny".  Everyone loved it!  Thank you so much!  The only change I made is I made my own salsa.

This was delish! There are a lot of ingredients, but it's worth it.  I did forget to add the corn, but I followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent recipe. Whipped up real quick for Cinco de Mayo party. It makes a lot! (40 servings), so I recommend either halving the recipe, or plan on having leftovers for the next week.

Awesome dip!!!  The only thing I did differently was that I used nonfat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It’s just a much healthier substitute.

I made it for a work function and everyone loved it! I also left a bit behind for my husband who devoured it.  I tried the advice of making the beans in the food processor which I liked, but perhaps I added too many to my little processor as they didn't end up smooth at all and were hard to spread out evenly.  I ended up using another can of regular.  Overall, I will definitely make this again.  It is very tasty.  Thank you for sharing

Big hit just changed out the lettuce for fat free retried beans and used fat free Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream . And instead of fresh jalapeños in the mixture, put jarred jalapeños on top (so that picky eaters could easily avoid them or pick them off). Thanks for the great recipe.

Great dip!  I think I will add more sour cream next time.  It just needed a little more of that layer.

Omg this was the hit of my party!  I swapped out the sour cream with fat-free Greek yogurt and I added cumin to the spices. I also used the entire jar of salsa. Delish, it's what everyone kept raving about. Thanks!

This was greeted by oohs and aahs as our Thanksgiving appetizer. I put one Tbsp. of chili powder, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp salt (for the taco seasoning). I included all the seeds with the jalapeno and all other ingredients as listed. It was plenty "spicy" and had a heat that grows. I used Garlic Tabasco for the red pepper sauce. I will make it again, and probably in a similar way.

I would make this again.  Made this for a group meeting and everyone liked it!  Great flavor and they could not tell that it had a jalapeno pepper in it!

Made it for s very picky bunch of relatives and they could not stay away from it. I put fat free refried beans at the base and used guacamole as a layer. Will definitely be a regular around here.

I made this for a Super Bowl party. Added a bit more sour cream and used 3 avocados. It was AMAZING! Couldn't have asked for better!!

Great.  Just thought the avocado layer and sour cream (or greek yogurt) layer needed a touch of salt mixed in

Doubled the sour cream, jalapeño, olives, and tomatoes. Used guacamole instead of the avocado mixture. Turned out very good, everyone liked it.

Love this recipe!  Fun to customize but still keep it on the light side.  Full of flavor - don't miss the extra calories or fat.

Like many other layered dips.  Nothing bad about it, nothing stellar either.

Made this for a tailgate and everyone loved it!  Didn't add corn but everything else was perfect and no one knew it was "skinny.".  Will make again for sure!
