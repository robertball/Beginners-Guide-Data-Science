Although this dessert dip does not taste like cookie dough that much (mostly because the cream cheese taste is very prevalent), it is still delicious and addicting!  I added 2 extra tablespoons of brown sugar and an extra teaspoon of vanilla.  I also added Heath toffee chips (for more texture) as I have seen in similar recipes.  Oh, and I let this sit over night.  At first, I served the dip with chocolate graham crackers, which were good, but then my husband had the fantastic idea to dip small pretzels in it.  The salty/sweet combo was perfect!  Next time, I may even add some crushed pretzels to the dip rather than the Heath chips.  The salt of the pretzels really complimented the sugar in the dip!  I will definitely make this dip again!

This recipe is good as written, but it does require a slight stretch of the imagination to taste a “cookie dough” flavor.   After several attempts at tweaking, I’ve decided that I like it best using the mini semi- sweet chocolate chips and doubling the amount of brown sugar and vanilla.  It definitely improves with age and I would recommend making at least one day, if not two days in advance for optimal flavor.

Fantastic! Made this to take to a chocolate themed Ladies Night. Served with Nilla Wafers, Ginger Snaps and Animal Crackers. Animal Crackers were the best! Definitely make this a day ahead. Tasted more like cheesecake than cookie dough so I added 2 tbsp extra brown sugar. After refrigerating overnight it absolutely tasted like cookie dough. Delicious!

This dip was really easy to throw together and had a nice flavor.  We followed another reviewer's suggestion and served it with (gluten free) pretzels.  The saltiness and crunchiness of the pretzels was a good contrast to the richness and creaminess of the dip.  It should be said (and has been said before by other reviewers) that the consistency is NOT like that of chocolate chip cookie DOUGH and the flavor is rich and slightly cheescake-y. If you want chocolate chip cookie DOUGH (and not dip) then make a batch of chocolate chip cookie dough and substitute  a flaxseed / water mixture for the eggs which would make it safe to eat raw.  If you want a lovely dessert DIP  to serve with crackers (or pretzels) at a party, then serve this.

This is a really yummy dip!  I agree, it is more "cheesecake-y" than cookie dough, but yummy none the less.  I adjusted the recipe as other had commented, doubling the brown sugar and the vanilla.  I also altered it the second time I made it and substituted peanut butter for the butter....it was awesome (and seemed a little more virtuous than using the butter!)  Love this dip and have shared it with my friends.

This is very good. Tastes more like cheese cake but that is fine by me! I spread this on top half a box of cooked brownies and it was amazing. Cheese cake in a bar form! Who wouldnt love that?

It's too cheesecake tasting. I tried the other suggestions and still nothing like cookie dough. A friend told me peanut butter. 3/4 a cup will get it to the color and flavor of cookie dough. Peanut butter fixes everything!

I placed mini chocolate chips in dip instead of the larger ones. I make the day before and place in fridge to allow the flavors to meld. This dip is a huge hit with my daughters friends when they have gatherings. I have to scoop some for myself before they get to the dip because there is nothing left once they are done. I serve with chocolate gram-crackers, animal crackers. :) super simple and easy to make.

Yes, add the extra brown sugar and then sandwich it between 2 vanilla wafers.  Chill it overnight and then you'll have mini cookie dough cheesecakes!

I doubled the recipe, added 2 & 1/2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips, & served it with graham cracker cookies. Everyone at the Bears game loved it because it had the salt from the graham crackers & the sweet from the dip. Twelve people asked for the recipe!?????

This is a fantastic dessert that is incredibly easy to make. I do add a pinch of salt, but only for the natural preservative effects.  Other than that,  I make no changes. The number of compliments I have received when I have made this are almost guilt-inducing since it is so quick and easy to make.

I made this as written and it flew off the plate at a picnic. Afterwards, I agreed that it was more cheese cake tasting, so in addition to doubling the brown sugar and vanilla, I added some peanut butter extract. Yummier that way.

After reading all the reviews I ended up adding an additional 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and an additional 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  I also decided to add a tsp. of salt as that is an ingredient added to most cookie doughs.  I used "mini" semi sweet chocolate chips and that was definitely the perfect size chocolate chip for this dip.  This was a huge hit at my party 3 days ago and I've had several ask for the recipe.  I made it the day before the party and served it with mini "nilla" wafers, chocolate teddy grahams, and animal crackers.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

This was a fantastic recipe and the first time I made it was at a big party and everybody loved it. I made it with my homemade chocolate chip cookie recipe. Although this recipe took over 5 minutes it was great. This is a great way to stop people from eating raw cookie dough as I often do and this is a great way to prevent it... But please note that the cream cheese takes long to melt and dose not melt easily. It will be more in kind of a large chunk and you will have to squish it before actually stirring it. Out of all the recipes I have come across this is by far the best one. You can try dipping this with apples green is my favorite but they also taste good with red. You can also try mixing this in with some ice cream chocolate or vanilla. It also taste good with homemade chocolate cake or brownies and it also taste good plain. You don't need many chocolate chips... You only need a handful because it won't taste good with a lot of them it will cut down the fantastic flavor.

Very good.  I added a little extra vanilla and brown sugar along w a 1/2 cup of peanutbutter to disguise the cream cheese taste.  I also used M&M's to add some color.

I love this dip!! I agree that it's closer to a cheesecake dip than a cookie dough but it's delicious. The consistency does more resemble cookie dough after it's been in the fridge and cooled. I love it with apple wedges since this has become my splurge item on my diet. I did also try it substituting margarine for the butter (trying get lower cost and calories) once and it RUINED it. Don't try it. The texture never was right and just tasted greasy.
