Very easy to prepare. I used some italian spices instead of the chicken seasoning and it was good but not fantastic.

I mixed a couple of teaspoons of light mayo in with the Dijonnaise (to cut the mustard flavor for my kids) used plain black pepper (all I had) and reduced the oil (only had a couple of teaspoons left in the bottle). This was SHOCKINGLY good. I am a notorious chicken over-cooker and the texture of this ended up like an excellent rotisserie chicken. Flavor was great a really unexpected "zesty" balance of the mustard and lemon. Couldn't be easier either! Served it with a prewashed bagged salad and store-bought crusty whole grain bread. Everyone loved it! My husband kids and I say THANK YOU TERI for taking the time to submit this recipe.

This was very good. Only next time I make it I would decrease the amount of olive oil. The oil separated from the sauce making it a bit greasy. The flavor of the chicken was great and came out very tender.

This was much better than I expected! I cook 'from scratch' a lot and I was sceptical of baking chicken in a mixture of mayonnaise and oil! I did halve the amount of oil and used light mayonnaise to cut down on the fat but it was very tasty and good. The chicken was really succulent and the mustard flavour just right. I don't much like the lemon pepper that I have available - it tastes somewhat synthetic which was noticeable in the final dish. In future I will use regular black pepper and maybe a dash more lemon juice to balance it. I think that that will push it up to four stars for us.

A very tasty dish. I didn't add the chicken stock cube as I felt that would have made it too salty but I did add some honey. I also cut the chicken into pieces rather than breast halves so it would cook quicker. The sauce started off really thick but by the end of cooking was a thinner consistancy - perfect for spooning over rice.

I didn't care for this recipe at all. The sauce doesn't seem to cook into the chicken enough. It might work better if it's marinated in it. But I wasn't crazy about the taste so it's not worth trying to me.

Very very good you have to like some taste to your food but very nice it went well with the wild rice. Only thing that I changed was I sprinkled some rosemary on the chicken as well. Thumbs up.

This chicken is amazingly moist and flavorful for the time put in! Very simple recipe. I served it with rice and my family polished everything off! I actually just used regular mustard but I'm sure Dijon would add extra flavor. Will definitely save to make again.

This chicken is amazing! Zesty and flavorful. I read the reviews and made some changes. I reduced the olive oil to 2 TBSP and substituted the chicken bouillon for italian seasoning and it turned out delicious! Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This was a great chicken recipe. I did follow some of the suggestions and did not use the chicken bouillon granules. And I simply bought a jar of creamy Dijon mustard (white wine base) but did not add any mayo to it. Delicious and Very Easy

This was a very good recipe. I did not have the Dijon Mustartd Mayo blend so I just mixed Dijon mustard with Miracle whip (about half and half). Next time I will use more Miracle whip. I also did not use the entire 1/4 olive oil - just short of it. I also did not have lemon pepper so I just used regular pepper. I pounded the chicken prior to cooking and poked it with a fork before pouring the sauce over it. My husband liked it alot but my daughter wasn't too crazy about the sauce. That is why I will try it next time with more miracle whip - the mustard taste might have been too strong for her. Over all I am keeping this recipe. Simple and good!! thanks for posting!

Added honey garlic powder rosemary and thyme and parmesan cheese to the top of chicken before baking. Omitted salt and boullion. I used spicy brown mustard with just a little spoonful of mayo. It was wonderful- baked up with a nice tasty sauce. Served with brown rice and Parmesan Tomatoes (from this site also).

I loved this recipe! It is so incredibly easy to prepare and cook and it's DELICIOUS. The flavor is amazing. I actually just use dijon mustard and skip the mayo and I don't use a bullion cube either but it's still absolutely amazing. I like to pair it with wild rice mixed veggies and a nice crusty bread. Mmmm!

This was OK. It's definitely quick to prepare (and that's a HUGE plus for me!). This might seem strange but every bite tasted exactly like my mom's deviled eggs! I like deviled eggs (especially hers) but on chicken???? I can't belive that these ingredients once combined were a dead on copy (wierd!). My only change was to scale all equivalents for three chicken breasts (I could only find three per package at my local grocery store) and sub equal parts dijon mustard (not stone ground) and light mayo for the dijonnaise blend. Served with Uncle Ben's chicken flavored long grain & wild rice blend canned three-bean salad and fresh pretzel breadsticks that I picked up at my Italian market's bakery. My fiance agrees with my rating (and he has never tried my mom's deviled eggs since he HATES HATES HATES eggs - period!!!). Perhaps this will float your boat but I think I'll take a pass... Thanks for sharing your idea anyways Teri:)

This chicken was delicious it stayed moist and everyone loved it. I didn't have any lemon pepper so I used my dried dill with lemon. I also sprinkled a little parmesan/ramano cheese on top. I cut it up and put it over rice the next day for lunch! I would probably add this to a tossed salad too. I will definitely make this again.

very good and very easy! i cut the olive oil in half like everyone suggested. i also made my own dijonnaise because i just didn't have it. i think i used just a little too much dijon though next time i will definitely cut back on that. i also made dirty rice to serve with it i didn't have any wild rice. i will definitely cook this again.

I tried this last night... pretty good. I didn't know exactly how to do the dijion mayo mix.. but I got it together enough for my liking. I cooked my chicken longer than they said... My chicken was moist it was good although my taster said it was a bit dijiony for him.

I followed the advice of several other reviewers and omitted the salt and cut the olive oil in half. Also I mixed dijon mustard with light mayonaise in a 50-50 mixture to create dijonaise. This was absolutely outstanding!

I had low expectations going into this one but was pleasantly surprised! My husband doesn't like mustard so he didn't eat it but I enjoyed it. I may keep around and do 1/2 recipe for myself once in a while (and just do bbq for my husband!).

I didn't have dijon mustard so I used mustard I brought back from France. It was way too strong and mustardy for me but my husband really enjoyed it. I also substituted garlic pepper for lemon pepper and it was fine.

This tastes simply like chicken with bland mustard on top. The oil made the sauce greasy and the only thing that saved the flavor was that I sprinkled lots of extra lemon pepper seasoning on top as it was cooking. Unless you absolutely love mustard I would skip this one.

Delicious and easy to fix. Not caring for dijon mustard I made my own sauce using maui onion mustard with Vegenaise Salad Dressing. (We use Vegenaise because it doesn't have eggs in it.) I didn't put in the bouillon. It doesn't need it and I don't need the chemicals and salt bouillon contains. The chicken turned out tender and was a big hit. Served with mashed potatoes and a vegetable salad. If you don't like mustard don't make this dish but if you like it try it. We found the mustard didn't overpower the chicken at all. It was just enhanced by it. I didn't have lemon pepper on hand so I used a tad more lemon juice and regular pepper.

I changed it a bit for what I had on hand and it was wonderful! Seasoned the chicken breasts well with garlic salt pepper and a dash of cayenne... Browned them quickly in the olive oil. I substituted worcershire sauce for the lemon wich gave it some zing. Then I baked with the Dijonnaise sauce without the oil. Good!

This has become one our favorite chicken dishes. It's super-good and perfect for company. I pour the sauce remaining in the pan over the chicken. I also brine the chicken first for 30 minutes - makes it even more tasty.

Simple yummy and MMMMM Good! We love Dijon in our house so I made my own blend of mostly mustard and a tad of mayo. Turned up moist and wonderful and was even yummy the next day. Make sure you have something to soak up the sauce.:)

Loved the idea but it was too lemony for us and I love lemon. Next time I think I will leave out the lemon pepper seasoning or cut back on the lemon juice.

Fantastic! I used Grey Poupon mustard and just a touch of Miracle Whip light and half the required oil. It was amazing. I'll definately make this one again.

I followed this recipe but used bone in chicken breast and baked for an hour. I also made my own dijonnaise more dijon than mayo. Also just used fresh ground pepper instead of lemon pepper. I agree about cutting back on the olive oil. This was delicious and we'll have it again.

This was tasty! Next time I will decrease the amount of oil though...it seemed a bit unnecessary/unhealthy.

This was very good... I didn't have enough dijon mustard and added about a tablespoon of yellow mustard to compensate. Turned out well!

this was delicious! We love dijon mustard and this was a real treat. I didn't have breasts so l used thighs instead so I know it will really be good using them. I will be using this often.

MMMMMMMMM..........A new favourite recipe for me! The chicken is moist and flavourful and the recipe is quick and easy and healthy. Perfect for busy families! I cut the olive oil in half but otherwise followed the recipe. Thanks!

This was good. I was a little disappointed just because the reviews were so good so I was expecting heaven but it was fine. It was a good solid recipe that's easy and the family likes it. It was a little greasy - I think I'll use less oil next time. Also I think I'll cut down on or cut out the bullion as others have said because it was really salty. My only change from the recipe was that I used vegan mayo (because I'm allergic to eggs) and mustard instead of the premade dijonnaise. So I don't know if that made a difference but it was still good & turned out really moist.

I will make it again. I love a dijonnaise chicken. I have a friend recently diabetic & one day he might even visit but I'm trying to make recipes that are less fatty flavourful & relatively simple & this is! The addition of lemon is perfect for a warm winter in Australia with salad through the year. We accompanied it with rye bread so all the saucy goodness isn't wasted & helps fill hungry kids ensuring it lasts longer. For diabetics I'm using plain mustard including mustard seeds & grilling it to ensure I can reduce the amount of butter & have the chicken lightly browned & crispy before finishing it as a baked meal in a medium oven but not fan-forced. It's a good base for people just starting to cook. Having less ingredients is encouraging for any new chef (son: I'm looking at you!). Simple is often best & not just for saving time. Thank you.

Yummy! A little salty but I like that. If you don't I would reduce the salt some. I might add a little more oil next time because my son didn't care for how thick the sauce was on top of the chicken. All in all easy and tasty!

This recipe was fantastic. I used a combination of deli-style mustard as well as the traditional yellow French's. I reduced the amount of olive oil to half of what was called for and the chicken was still very moist. This was a delicious twist to chicken which can get boring. I will make it again.

This was so easy and the chicken came out moist & tender. I also cut the olive oil & half and found it to be plenty. The only complaint I have is it's too salty! I think perhaps 1tsp salt on top of the bouillon is just too much next time I'll cut back to half tsp or less. Other than the flavor was good. A great recipe overall!

Couldn't be easier and has a fantastic flavor. I made my own dijonnaise with a very scant 1/4 cup mayo and filled the rest of the measuring cup with dijon. Gave a nice strong mustard flavor. Will definitely be making again. Tastes like you put a lot more work into it for sure!

I feel really terrible saying it, because I really appreciate that someone took the time and care to contribute this recipe, but it was disgusting. :( I made it as written. The texture of the chicken was good, but I did not like the flavor. I had to wash the sauce off and eat the chicken plain. If you love lemon pepper, maybe your experience will differ. It was not for me, sadly.
