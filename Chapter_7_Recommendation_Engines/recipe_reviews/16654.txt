Caramel Apple Friendship Bread -

Here's something I did different I did to it today.  Using this original recipe as the base, I added chopped apples, pecans, apple pie spice to the mix.  Baked in 2  8x4 pans for about 60 mins.  When cool I poured a Caramel Glaze over the top of it.  


On the starter recipe link on the recipe and it says at the bottom you can freeze this starter.  I always do and it comes out great.

This recipe is great if you use triple berry mix pureed to replace the oil in this recipe and I have also used peaches 
It is really good with orange dream pudding and pureed mandarin oranges.I was making 12-14 loaves a week of the different flavors I was making use your imagination you'll be really suprized at how it changes the flavor and brings them running. I couldn't make it fast enough!!!!!!!!!

This was my first try at Amish Friendship bread. I used the starter found on this site. Bread came out great. I used a cup of applesauce instead of going half and half with the oil, used Splenda in place of the sugar, and sugar-free vanilla pudding. Even with the lightening up, it came out very delicious.

I just love making Amish friendship bread, I have been doing it for years.  I was always bothered with the instant pudding mix in the ingredients, so I made a substitution this last time.  I replaced it with two mashed, ripe bananas, and threw in a few pinches of extra flour in fear that the batter would be too wet.  I also use all organic and natural ingredients as much as possible to make it a little healthier.  The bread came out fantastic with the bananas in place of the pudding, very moist and delicious.  Everyone I gave some too loved it as well.  Next time I will try using apples as I saw some people suggested.

I made this today and it was delicious. I used 1cup of unsweetened applesauce and omitted the oil. It was perfect. Very moist. The kids didn't notice any difference between this and the full fat version. Next round I'm going to use 1c of whole wheat flour and less sugar.

I made this yesterday, WOW. My first time ever making this kind of bread. My sister had overnighted me a starter from across to country, 11 days ago. I did not use apples, nuts or raisins. I did however mix up 2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 cup sugar in a little bowl, sprinkled half of it in two greased loaf pans before pouring in the batter, and sprinkled the remaining sugar/cinnamon over the tops of the unbaked loaves. DELICIOUS and super easy to make. Baked exactly 1 hour and they were done perfectly.

The last time I made this I used lemon pudding and added some frozen blueberries.  I baked it in a bundt-like pan, and when it was done I drizzled a lemon glaze over it.  YUMMY!

One of the yummier Friendship Bread recipes :) I left out the walnuts due to an allergy. I halved the recipe, and for the fruit I filled up one cup with a mixture of sunflower seeds, dried cranberries, raisins and dates. There was fruit in every bite this way. Really good toasted!

Doing the starter process and making this bread with my kids sure brought back a lot of memories of me doing the same thing with my mom.  This bread is just as good as I remember it, and my kids and I are keeping the starter going so we can continue to enjoy this bread as well as the many other varieties that you can make.

I didn't care for this version.  It didn't cook through properly  and was very heavy.  I didn't mind the taste, but again because it never really cooked all the way through it was hard to tell.

My sister-in-law was leaving on a trip the day before making the bread so gave me the starter. I knew I wouldn't have time for another 5 days so I fed it. Her's was in a zippy bag so it was easy to keep. I was at a loss and left the bag open, didn't want an accidental explosion. By the time I was ready, the mixture was VERY sour-smelling but figured I'd try anyway. Also had to use Butterscotch pudding mix. I wasn't sure how much starter to use so I guessed at 1 1/2 cups. Well... it WORKED!!! Very tasty, not sour, not too sweet. I'm quite amazed. The recipe I got didn't use applesauce and "extras" so I'll try that next time.

I love this recipe.  It is so easy to make and the results are fabulous.  I really like the versatility.  You can make lots of different varieties of bread just by changing out some of the ingredients.  Love it!!

I changed it to LEMON instant pudding mix and you wouldn't believe how much better it made the bread. (it doesn't give a real strong lemon taste, but just the right flavor)
Once I put apple slices inside and it was good too.

Also try chocolate instand pudding mix and add peanut butter chips. MMM  that's a favorite among the people i give the bread too.

What a wonderful blend of flavors and very moist. I even had to improvise with the pudding mix. I used vanilla and lemon (sugar free), added more walnuts and used craisins in lieu of raisins just because that was what I had in the pantry. It is definitely going to be a keeper in my recipe book.                             (junebug)

I received my very first starter from a my daughter-in-law last week. It is wonderful, the bread is delicious. I would like to know how long the starter can be kept going...the instructions that came with mine said not to refrigerate.

This was excellent.  Baked one in a pyrex loaf pan and one in a metal loaf pan and the pyrex loaf cooked faster and looked nicer, as the top was a more golden brown.  Any which way, it was excellent.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I love the whole concept of the bread. I didnt use the nuts, dates, and rasins. But I added cappachino powder and some strong brewed cofee it tasted so yummy. I cant wait to experiment some more.

A co-worker brought this from home with the starter bags so I took one home, and tried it out.  It's a very versatile bread, you can add anything to it, and will still come out good.  The best thing is, since I work 55-60 hrs a week, the fact that day 10 just happened to fall on the weekend was awesome, so now I have 2 loaves baking in the oven right now!!

While this smelled wonderful baking, it had an off taste to it and it was way too sweet. It was even more sweet than cake!

I made mine using a lg box of butterscotch pudding, also used all oil as I didn't have the applesauce.....Oh my, was it ever good....right out of the oven!!! A friend gave me the starter and was suppose to cook it on Saturday. But cooked it on Sunday instead and served it up for an Open House, had dusted the greased pans with cinnamon sugar and sprinkled the tops, too. This is SOOOOOO good. The smell of it cooking just filled the house with a wonderful Home Cooking smell. I did not add any fruit or nuts. I am only sorry that it's gone~all eaten! Will have to wait for about another week, till my starter is ready again for baking.

A pretty good bread.  Got a starter from a neighbor recently and this is close to the recipe that came with it.  My family really liked it.  I made one with chocolate pudding and one with vanilla pudding.  I added raisins to one of the vanilla and dried cherries to one of the chocolate loaves.  I didn't think there was much chocolate flavor using the chocolate pudding.  I had some black bananas and wondered if I could use the starter for banana bread.  My recipe called for 1 cup of oil so I used 1/2 cup oil, 3 or 4 bananas and no pudding, and added 1/2 tea. nutmeg.  The banana flavor came through well but not the spices.  If I do that again I will add a bit more nutmeg.

Wonderful recipe! The bread comes out tasty and super moist. I put 2 loaves in the freezer a few weeks back and took them out the other day for company. They defrosted fine and were just as moist as when I made them.

I was given some starter by a friend, and the recipe she gave with the instructions was almost identical to this one.  I couldn't find a 5 oz box of pudding and just used the regular 3 oz size.  This is really much more like a coffee cake in loaf form than a "bread".  It's half gone only a couple of hours out of the oven!

This recipe is awesome. I have used several different ways of making it. Use lemon pudding and glaze with a light lemon glaze while cooling. I use cinnamon applesauce in place of regular applesauce. Use dried cranberries, choc. chips, nuts, any dried fruit. I keep a starting going all the time. Cant make it fase enough to keep everyone full.

I've made this version for a decade. Delicious and gobbled up quickly. Before baking, I top the batter with a mixture 1/2 cup sugar & 1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.

I used coconut cream pudding mix and added 1 cup of flaked coconut to batter.  It was a hit!!!  I also have used lemon pudding and added blueberries.  **Tip add blueberries, nuts or chocolate chips to dry ingredients and stir gently this coats them and prevents them from sinking to the bottom and more evenly distributed in the bread**  The starter recipe is on this site also!

Made as stated above except used all oil and skipped the apple sauce. Mostly just because I didn't have any. I also replaced the walnuts with macadamias and it was okay. I mean it was good but nothing out of this world. Well the weekend rolled around and my hunny wanted French toast and we were out of regular bread so I cut this up and made French toast and let me tell you it was out of this world. I baked another batch of bread just so I can make French toast again.

Really liked this bread.  I had to use a mix of white and brown sugar since I ran out of white, but it still turned out ok.  I added craisins and pineapple for my fruits.  Thanks for sharing!

Very Delicious. I didn't add the applesauce in the recipe(I used 1 cup of oil instead) and the bread still came out delicious. This time I used Vanilla pudding but next time I'm going to try another Flavor.

My family loves this bread.  I mix it up with different flavors of pudding ,lemon is very good.  Usually I will make muffins instead of loaves.  Easier to grab on the go or hand to the kids.  There is always plenty of starter so I will make a double batch and take so to work to share.

I add a little (1 tsp) cardamom for extra flavor, add extra cinnamon and vanilla and leave out the nuts for a yummy spice bread that tastes like a chai latte.  My hubby (whose a health nut) won't even let me share two loafs!!

This is basically the same recipe my family has used for years. We like to sprinkle our pans with cinnamon sugar after greasing. It is fun to switch flavors of pudding and we add any add-ins as long as they measure about one and a half cups. Sometimes my family uses chocolate pudding and nuts, other times we do vanilla and dried cranberries. My mom likes butterscotch chips. This is so easy to customize. Nice to see it on here. I've found that they freeze pretty well.

I've tried several date bread recipes without a lot of luck until I found this one--it's very moist & by far the best one I've made. I plan on trying it with other add-ins such as dried cherries.
