Refreshing!  Made for breakfast for myself this morning and had to make another batch because everyone drank it all and wanted more.  If you want it thicker, freeze your fresh strawberries or use frozen and that will thicken it up.  I enjoyed as written and would not change a thing.  Thanks tapegurl

This is good but we liked it better with a banana. We can't get strawberries now so we use the frozen strawberries in sugar so we omit the sugar called for. Thank you.

Thick, pretty and delicious.  I used frozen strawberries, which I liked because I didn't have to dilute this with as many ice cubes to make this refreshingly cold.

My 4 year old and 1 year old loved this recipe.  We added blue berries, a banana, raspberries and a little more ice.  It turned out to be a cool healthy treat for a hot afternoon.

I found this to be a little different than a smoothie but not in a bad way. It was very refreshing but a little tart. I personally liked the tartness but if you don't add a little more sugar or some bannanna. Very nice taste!

Good...but not exactly a smoothie.  After tasting, I added a banana (for 1 serving) to make it a bit thicker.  But if you're not looking for a thick smoothie, then just leave it as is for a cool slushy type refreshing summer drink.

This was really good!  My daughter wanted to make strawberry smoothies, so we picked this recipe...we weren't disappointed.  A couple of adjustments that we made...we froze just over a cup of strawberries (filled up the one cup Pyrex measuring cup), used one cup of orange juice, 10 cubes of ice, 2 tablespoons of sugar and 2 tablespoons of shredded coconut (unsweetened).  We blended it all together and presto!  It was so good and made enough for 3 servings.  Yum!!

This was really good, but I added about half a banana to it.  Great basic recipe, add whatever other flavors you are in the mood for - banana, pineapple, coconut, etc.

This was good--very light, fresh, and fruity. I added a tbsp of wheat germ and 2 tbsp of vanilla yogurt, and it tasted wonderful. Perfect if you're looking for something to satisfy your hunger or thirst without weighing you down.

I'm giving this a 5-star on behalf of my friend and family members who loved this. This resembles a slush more so than a smoothie but still very good.  We used an additional 1/2c strawberries and added in a splash of vanilla. I wouldn't drink this as a substitute for my morning breakfast but I would make it for the upcoming hot summer afternoons. Thanks tapegurl!

Add 1/4 - 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt instead of sugar, and it is healthier and still VERY tasty!!  It also helps to thicken it up.

Excellent! Very refreshing. Amount of sugar needed may vary depending on the sweetness of your strawberries. I followed the recipe exactly as written and my smoothies came out slightly tart but sweet.

I used about three scoops of lime sherbet instead of crushed ice and my strawberries we frozen for thicker texture. A great sweet but tart flavor.

Perfect!  My kids love this, even though it's healthy.  I did put one banana in it and doubled everything else.  I also used the strawberries with sugar already in them (just what I had on hand).

I omitted the sugar for a healthy and tasty smoothie - perfect for a hot sunny day.   It would be easy to vary this recipe by adding additional ripe fruit.   It’s a very simple but very good recipe.

Overall, pretty  good.  I used orange juice, and made it in the Magic Bullet.  I had to add more orange juice and sugar as a result, but I will make it again!

This is my favourite smoothie so far!  It has a nicy tangy, fruity flavour.  Instead of using orange juice I just used the frozen concentrate.  It made a stronger more fruity taste.

I use this recipe all the time (before I found it here even) and it's wonderful. I do use a banana in mine and I use a little more sweetener but I prefer Splenda for taste or Confectioner's Sugar if I don't have Splenda on hand.   Adding a little of any fruit changes it up and makes it great.

Instead of using ice, freeze the strawberries. Then the smoothie will still be cold but not watered down.

I LOOVVVVEEE this smoothie! I make it every morning for my family now, and it really helps get the day started. If you add bananas to it, it tastes even better! It's super good for you and it helps me get through my day. If there was an option to rate it ten stars i'd rate it 20 stars

Obviously, not really a "smoothie" but nevertheless, very good. I ended up having to make 2nd batch & added a banana & a handful of blueberries. Everyone loved it! Perfect, refreshing treat for a hot, muggy evening!

I made this as is, but using half frozen strawberries and half frozen strawberries that had been thawed.  I think the frozen berries added to the slushiness as it was pretty thick.  Probably didn't need the sugar, but wanted to follow the recipe.  I think I will go with some others suggestions and try this again without the sugar and add a banana.

Good basic recipe. I added a few more strawberries and another tablespoon of sugar to make it just right for me.

I am a picky smoothie drinker... Not much can satisfy me but that wasn't the case for this one! Absolutely delicious. What a great Saturday morning treat (it does not take long to make, though)... Just enjoyable on a lazy Saturday morning. I wouldn't make any other changes to it. Give it a try!

Nice, but I should have waited until the strawberries at the store have more flavor or, better yet, I can grow my own. I'll try this again later in the year. Thanks!

I used:
2 cups OJ
2 cups of frozen raspberries (or until sastifaction)
1 Banana
14 ice cubes
about 1/4 cup of sugar (or until sastifaction)
Blend everything together but the sugar. Taste the smoothie, it will be sour, and put in as much sugar in as needed. (An alternative for sugar would be honey!) 
I found out that the raspberry seeds were too overwhelming, so I put the the entire smoothie through a strainer, and it was amazing! To make the smoothie thicker put it in the freezer for 5 minutes! I highly recemend this recipe!!

I made it in a food processor since the blender broke. It didn't come out as smooth, obviously, and the strawberry seeds all fall to the bottom.   And since I used frozen strawberries, I didn't need that much ice. Next time I'll add just a few cubes and see how that does.

More like a slush than a smoothie, but still delicious. I subbed with Splenda.  2 servings = 1.5 PointsPlus (This entire recipe would serve only 2 people, not 4)

OMG, I knew i would love this, i knew it!! it's easy, healthy, tasty and revitalizing, and it's also similar to a dessert my mom used to make for us. She would mix a bunch of strawberries and orange juice (enough juice to cover the strawberries), then she would toss some sugar in and let the whole thing sit in the fridge for at least a couple of hours. She never tried to blend it! 
Omitted the ice and added less sugar, because the oranges from our backyard are veeeery sweet.
This is a keeper! thanks Tapegurl

I made this and it tasted SO good. I was REALLY surprised at how good it was. I almost didn't want to give the other half to my mom. :)
I made it as is, with no bananas. I like my smoothies on the thicker side. I used frozen strawberries (I just took fresh strawberries and froze them; not bagged ones) and about 7 ice cubes.

I thought this tasted good. I did 1/2 recipe and got 1 serving. The only change I made was subbing a packet of Truvia for the sugar and I only had frozen strawberries which I froze the other day. Since, my strawberries were frozen it was a little more like an Italian ice until it melted down some. I think it would be good on a very hot day.

Really enjoyed this one.  I cut back on the sugar a little bit and used frozen strawberries instead of fresh.  I also didn't use as many ice cubes since my strawberries were frozen.  I liked the use of the orange juice and was a nice change to the more creamy smoothies made with yogurt or milk.

See I didnt have any straw berries on hand.. but I had orange juice and ice...sooo.. I made this a litle different. I took frozen wild rassberies, half a frozen banana and fresh blue berries.. added orange juice and some low fat yogurt with the ice. I didnt need to add sugar because of the OJ, yogurt and natural sweetness of the banana. Its pretty good drinking it now :)

It was just ok. I made it with frozen strawberries, and it was too sour for me. That was a surprise, because I don't usually like things too sweet. I might try it again with fresh strawberries, and 1 tablespoon more sugar.

This was very good and very easy! I made the recipe as stated (doubled it) and added the sugar.  I added about a jigger of Malibu Rum to my glass- It was VERY good! :)
Kids and Mom loved it.

Nice and refreshing.  Very much like a slush and not very smooth.  I agree with other reviewers, it really needs a banana.  Also, I omitted the sugar and we didn't miss it.

I sort of read the recipe wrong, or somehow it got lost in translation, but instead of using 1 cup of strawberries, i used exactly 7.  Now I don't know what made me go from 1 cup to 7 berries, but it was lucky, because though the slushie came out red from all the strawberries, it was AMAZING. I'm sure if the orange juice was stronger, it'd be jsut as good.  I love the texture, and something that made it even better was the fact that i used frozen strawberries and 2 ice cubes (once again, some brain fart of mine).  It wasn't watery at all. I also cut down the sugar to 2 tsp since I added all those extra strawberries, and the sweetness was perfect.
Beautifully simple and delicious recipe!

Refreshing and delicious! I added 1/2 a frozen banana which I believe enhanced this drink. I passed on this recipe to a few friends. Many thanks!

Good base smoothie recipe, although I made quite a few changes:  I doubled the recipe, using 2C orange juice, 1C each frozen strawberries and peaches (no sugar added), 1T honey instead of the sugar, omitted the ice cubes, and added 1 banana.  Blended up easily, and was slightly tart.  Think it would be good with yogurt or ice cream added, or with other fruits too (kiwi, blue berries, etc.) Wonderful recipe to experiment with!  Thanks!

This was delicious- but I did change it a little bit. I added one banana, and also a scoop of lowfat vanilla icecream. I used frozen strawberries and I also left out the ice, but it was smooth and slushy. Wonderful!

I'm just starting to get into smoothies, and this was delicious. I did take the advice of others, and added some banana. The only thing I found was that the ice cubes didn't chop up too well, so I took the big chunks out. Probably because my blender isn't very strong. 
I definitely will make this again.

I was in a rush coming back from practice and I had another class to go to and I had 20 minutes to prepare and get something to drink. Driving to Jamba Juice, I thought, "It is a really hot day and a lot of people would be at Jamba." I decided to go home and I looked up quick recipes and found this one. I tried it and in 10 minutes (like the recipe said), I had a fresh strawberry and orange juice smoothie and I loved it. I recommend everybody to try this recipe.

This smoothie is good and it is a great refresher in the morning. However, I had to add a extra tablespoon of sugar in mixture to make it more flavorful. Otherwise, the smoothie came out great.

Delicious!  I love the sweet with the tart.  It's January, so strawberries aren't in season.  I used frozen and less ice.  I also added stevia instead of sugar to cut back on sugar intake.  It is so refreshing!  I can't wait to try this with simply orange juice and fresh strawberries.  I'll bet it's even fresher.

To make it thicker, cut the strawberries in half and freeze.  Add banana, ice cubes, and 2+ tablespoons of organic vanilla yogurt.  Optional additions: orange juice, mango slices, or pineapple juce/chunks.  No need to add any sugar.  Sweet and refreshing.

I had bought quite a bit of strawberries at a discount at the local farmer's market (end of the day discounts are fantastic). I wanted to use some of them up and had been searching for a quick and tasty looking recipe. This caught my and I have to say, it does not disappoint! This is absolutely fantastic! I didn't change a thing and it is delicious.

I used this recipe as a starting point. I squeezed a fresh orange into the mix, as well as a cap-full of vanilla extract and a spoonful of Splenda. Also, I used the 50% less sugar orange juice. That cut some calories, but the fresh orange and the vanilla added a lot of flavor. Great recipe, though!

I cut the amount of orange juice to 1/2 cup, added 1/2 2% milk for a little creaminess, and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Only 4-5 ice cubes.  I liked this smoothie very much and will make it again.

The taste was very tart, but I didn't add sugar because I'm trying to eat/drink healthy. I also find that the ice cubs make it hard to blend, maybe my blender just sucks. Otherwise it was good. Boyfriend loved it more than me.

This smoothie is pretty good, but a little tart. It's a good basis for additions to make it anything you want. I added more sugar and a capfull of vanilla. I think with vanilla ice cream. it would be phenominal! Over all, it's pretty good.

I thought this was a good start--both my husband and I agreed that it needed more flavor. Next time I will add another half cup of strawberries and a little more sugar. This is a great smoothie for the morning or to replace a meal. I'm full! :)

This is a great summer treat, everyone in the family loves it.  I use frozen strawberries and a little less ice.  

For the diabetics in the family, substitute the orange juice with a sugar free flavored drink (like crystal lite) and use Splenda for the sugar.

Editing for update! January 2011

YES!  TOTALLY make sure you get an orange juice you like.  The Pure Premium from Tropicana (fresh) really made the difference for me.  Did it as-is and it is the PERFECT ratio of ingredients...I can taste both the OJ AND the Strawberries :)  
**********
This was just ok for me.  I added more ice to make it thicker and did it to taste to where I could taste BOTH the OJ and the strawberries (I did not add anything else other than what the recipe called for).   

In my own recommendations, I would TOTALLY use an orange juice that you like.  That might make all the difference in the world.  I used a store-brand rip-off of Tropicana Pure Premium (my husband bought it..NOT ME!) and there is no comparison.

TOTALLY use an OJ you like!

I made this with 4 fresh navel oranges (cut up into segments) and around a cup of strawberries. I blended the fruit first, added in the ice cubes and 1 tsp of sugar and blended again. Tasted really good, reminded me of a smoothie I have ordered at a local Thai restaurant. Will make this again, thanks.

It came out very tart, and more like a slushy versus a smoothie. It's definitely not what I'm used to, but as I continued to drink it, I liked it more and more. I started thinking of how refreshing it would be on a hot summer day. I love how very simple and easy to remember it is, and I will definitely make this again. *Made it again, and I shared with my BF this time; he absolutely LOVED it and had me make it again that night.*

I've made this multiple times. I usually add more strawberries. This time I didn't have OJ on had. I had pink lemonade and cranberry juice. I went with the pink lemonade and added the juice of two small oranges and one lemon. It tasted very good but I like it best made with fresh OJ!

My kind of smoothie! Easy, minimal ingredients and delicious and versatile!  I used a frozen fruit blend in place of the strawberries and ice.  Next time I will use a little less orange juice. I  think this is good without the sugar, too! Thanks for the recipe!
