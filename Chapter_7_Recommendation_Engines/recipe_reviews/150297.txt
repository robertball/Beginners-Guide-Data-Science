My boyfriend and I made this recipe last night and we LOVED IT!!! We made a few variations: we substituted spicy chicken sausage for pork sausage, fiery roasted tomatoes for plain tomatoes, doubled the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (which I thought would be hard to find, but were at a regular grocery store!), left out the coriander because my boyfriend hates cilantro. It was spicy, smokey and wonderful - huge hit and we will make again!

I'm on an obsessed mission to sample as many AR Chili recipes as I can possibly stand (or well, until heartburn catches up to me, or I wipe the bean inventory from my grocery store) and I am So.Very.Glad that I tried this one out tonight! I went heavier on the chipotles, sauteed bell pepper w/ the onion and garlic, and used 2 cans of beans. (What I had on hand ~ Great Northern and Black.) While the end result was a *touch* too thick for my taste-texture (would be perfect over a baked potato or fries though!), I wouldn't change a thing. Really, the chipotles MAKE this chili outstanding and a 5-star keeper in my book! Oh and we ate our's w/ tortilla chips, green onion, and grated cheddar. Already salivating thinking of the leftovers tomorrow ... or tonight if I get a chilitch. e.g. chili itch. Thanks Emily for introducing me to the wonderfulness of using chipotles canned in adobo as a knockout addition to chili!

I adjusted the seasonings to suit our taste (threw in a couple of Knorr tomato and chipotle bouillon cubes), and had to add about a cup of water as it was very very thick. This turned out to be one of the best chilis I have ever made. Served it with jalepeno cornbread. Thanks, emily!

I used the entire can of Adobo Peppers, including the sauce.  It added quite the kick, but it tasted fantastic.

I have to 5 star this one although I really only used it as a base because it was the only Slow Cooker chile that sounded good so I didn't follow the recipe exact. 

I made the following variations..  Meat: 1.5lbs 90% lean beef and 1lb ground turkey (we were looking for healthy chile).  Dropped the chipotle peppers and only had about 4 tablespoons of chile powder in the pantry so that's all it got.  My wife and I are hot food whimps so that was enough for both of us.  

I also used pre-minced garlic (in oil) since I didn't feel like buying a whole head for 2 cloves.  I also only used half an onion because a "large onion" here is HUGE so 1/2 of one was a good cup of onions.  I did use the red kidney beans as well.

The final product was AWESOME, the combination didn't need any additional water or anything like others have done, but I did use less meat.

I realize I took the chipotle out of the Chipotle Chili, but like I said I was really just looking for a good base crock-pot recipe for chile and this more than qualified.

Tasty. Too much meat in my opinion...and I only used 2 of the 3 pounds. Increasing the chipotles is a good idea if you like things a little spicier. Overall thought this recipe was too acidic. Maybe the ratio of the ingredients needs to be adjusted.

I thought this was great, however next time I will probably omit entirely the 1tsp of salt - I found it to be quite salty, even though I made sure to use low-sodium ingredients where possible. Overall I thought it was great, but not quite spicy enough with mild italian sausage and 2 adobo peppers. The only other changes I made were instead of using two lbs of meat I opted to use an extra can of black beans as I prefer to lean slightly more to the vegetarian side of things.

I can't give this a 5 star b/c I didn't make it exactly as written.  I left out the sausage completely and just used ground beef.  Also, we doubled the amount of chipotle peppers, could have possibly even tripled it for our tastes.  It was too thick, so I added a can of beef broth.  This turned out to be an AWESOME chili recipe.  I will use this from now on.  I might even try substituting chicken for the beef.

This is so easy to make.  Every time I've made it, I've had people who have not liked hot stuff to be the one's whose eaten it the most.  If you want a hearty chili with a different but bold flavor. You have got to try this one, the chipotle peppers are fantastic in this.

We loved this recipe!  I only used one pound of ground beef instead of two.  I doubled the amount of kidney beans and made them from scratch.  I also didn't add the tomato paste at all, the chili was so thick already I couldn't see adding a thickener.  I also cut the spices down a bit - I only put 4 tbsp of chili powder and 1/2 tbsp of cumin.  Even so I found it very spicy.  My husband and I both thought it was great, I think next time I will only use 1/2 lb of ground beef (but I'll still keep the whole pound of sausage), and i'll completely omit the cumin but increase the chipotle peppers to get more of the smoky flavor without increasing the spice too much.  All in all a fabulous chili recipe!  Thanks.

I made this recipe for a work "soup day" that we began...I upped the quantity for 15 people, so it was a bit costly but it was amazing. I added about a Tablespoon more of chipoltes than what the recipe called for. I do not like beans so about 40 mins before serving I added in about 3 cups of Ditalini pasta...so it pretty much was like chili mac...AWESOME! It had a nice slow burn to it, not super spicy and majority of people at worked liked it. I went home with just about enough for my dad and mom to have some for lunch the next day! Putting in my recipe box...it's a keeper

This probably one of the best chili recipes that I ever tried! I made some changes to it though. I tripled the chipolte in abode sauce. I also fire roasted one red bell pepper, then chopped it up and added that to the chili recipe. I also added 2 cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes. I got some rave reviews about this chili after it was served to a bunch beer drinking guys. So take my advice, because this will taste like you simmered over an open fire for a whole day. Enjoy

GREAT basic recipe. Made a few changes, which accounts for the rating. Used ground turkey to make it a bit healthier, used a bit less chili powder and subbed out the peppers for chipotle seasoning. Also added just a tad of brown sugar to mellow out the spiciness. My husband went crazy for this chile...and I loved it as well! Great served with brown rice. Yum!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars but I made a LOT of changes. To start I used hot pork sausage and 1lb lean turkey. I added 1tbsp of cayenne, same of garlic powder and onion powder. I also added some sofrito. Then I used about 1/2 can of the chipotle chilis in adobo. It was also too thick so I added a cup of water. I used dried kidney beans as well (soaked them the night before). It is delicious and spicy just the way me and my hubby love it! The depth of flavor is amazing! I am going to decrease how much tomato paste I use though.

Hubby & I loved this chili!! Being from TX we omitted the beans, but followed recipe exactly.  Only down was it could have been used a little more liquid.  Think I'll add some tomato juice next time.  This is very, very hearty and meaty and the adobo pepper gives a really unusual smoky taste.  This will definately be MY chili recipe from now on.  Thanks so much.

Really awesome recipe! I used about 3/4lb. of ground turkey to keep it heart healthy. I also used organic carribbean style black beans because they added extra seasoning and flavor. I used a little less chili powder and scraped out the seeds from the chipotle peppers because I have a toddler to keep happy. As I was tasting it while it simmered, I felt like it needed a little sugar to balance out the saltiness from the canned beans. I also added two more cloves of garlic because I love garlic. It's so yummy and everything worked fabulously! Thanks, Emily!!!

This is the best chili that I have ever made!  I changed to one pound of beef, but chose to use tenderloin cut into small cubes instead of the ground beef.  I used home made hot sausage from our local Brazilian market.  I couldn't find the adobo sauce, so I used dried chille chipotle from the Brazilian market. I added the cup of water recommended by my version  came out a little runny, so I added a teaspoon of corn meal to thicken it.  Emily's recipe is a winner!!  I just tweaked it to suite the ingredients that I could buy locally.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers!  Thank you Emily for the wonderful recipe!

Alterations to make it even better:
Double, triple, or quadruple the chipotles
Add 1 cup of corn
Add 1 - 2 tablespoons of the Chipotle Tabasco (to taste)
I used shredded beef! MMMMMMM mmmmmm Good!

This is perfect chili.  Not fancy or "unique"... just perfectly delicious chili.  It's great by itself or with sweet cornbread. I didn't change anything in the recipe, but I eyeball my spices so who knows.

My granddaughter and I entered this in a Chili Contest at our Church last week end, and won Best Taste Award, Hottest taste, but makes you come back for more, and we named it FIRECRACKER CHILI, and won Best Name.  Everyone just loved it, it was like a firecracker exploding in your mouth with all the flavors. Best Chili I have ever tasted

I did not make this in the slow cooker, just on the stove over about a 2 hour period.  We don't care for over tomato-y chili's so for personal preference I omitted one of the cans of diced tomatoes and only used an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and added 3 cups of chicken stock.  I upped all the seasoning some but added some cayenne as well for extra heat.  Definitely could double the chipotle's as I hardly tasted them.  Topped mine with onions, cilantro and Mexican cheese :)

This is my FAVORITE chili recipe. It's perfect the way it is, but I do like to change it up every now and then. I like to use 1 lb of smoked turkey sausage (cut into tiny pieces) instead of the Italian sausage- that is my effort at making it healthy :) plus, it really does add a little extra texture in there that we enjoy. I use all of the chipotle peppers from a 7 oz can and then add the adobo sauce to the mix. I like to use black beans instead of kidney beans (and I think I usually add 2 cans.) We love garlic so I always add extra cloves. Next time I make it I'm going to add a chopped green pepper. I've used different seasonings each time, but you can do that with this recipe and it's not going to ruin the flavors. I follow the first step by cooking the meat, draining it and adding the spices, onion and garlic, but then I go ahead and put that mixture in the crock pot and add all the other ingredients (except tomato paste) and it works out perfectly. I just don't have the coordination to cleanly pour everything from the Lg. pot to the crock pot. I sometimes cheat and do step 1 the night before and refrigerate the meat mixture so I can get up the next morning and just throw everything together and start cooking it before going to work. This is a wonderful recipe if you aren't looking for standard chili. Thanks, Emily!

This was one of my favorite tasting chilli's ever.  Loved the adobo chiles in this recipe.  I love hot food so I doubled the amount of them.  I also used ground turkey instead of beef and used half the amount of meat.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe and have made it several times, always to rave reviews.  I have made the recipe as written as well as with all ground beef, ground turkey and ground chicken.  Regardless of the type of meat used, it's delicious every time!

I have made this recipe many times.  I have made it with ground beef and pork sausage, beef cubes (for stew) and pork sausage and ground turkey and turkey sausage.  It ALWAYS turns out great.  I tend to add more chipotles and use black beans instead of kidney beans.

I've made this recipe 8-10 times and it's been fantastic every time but one and that was MY fault (note: do not accidentally use chili-flavored seasoning salt!!!).  Over the years I've made a few additions, but the recipe turns out fine without my changes (I always use the kidney beans).  Today I'm trying leftover turkey in place of the sausage/beef.

Changes I've made:
-Add small can green chiles
-Add extra chipotles and some chipotle powder
-Added a can of corn for color/crunch
-Added a can of white beans for color
-Once I added bacon (excellent)

Great recipe! modified Using 2 1/2 pounds of ground beef,  4 cloves of garlic, the whole can of chipotle chilis (7oz) and omitted the tomato paste. Talk about low key spice! came out perfect and added this to my cold weather rotation

This is so good, served it for New Year's Eve dinner with friends along with honey cornbread.  I stuck to the recipe with only one exception -- included the whole can of chipotle peppers to give it extra zing based on another recommendation, worked well and was not overly spicy.  My only caution is on the nutrition side -- just measured this using the WW app and one serving is 14 points.

This recipe is the closest thing in the internet I could find to my receipt. It’s a little thick but the cure for that.... add beer. I use New Belgium 1554. You can thank me later .

I made the recipe for 2; however, the amount provided enough for 3-4! 
I used ground pork instead of sausage meat. (I would use the sausage next time.)
My chili powder is spicy so i reduced it to one third. 
However, upon tasting the final product, I added more chili powder, I added the called for amount of cumin and coriander again (essentially doubling what was called for). 
I tripled the amount of canned chipotle peppers with adobo sauce.

the Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce are the secret to this chilli. my husband loves this and says it is my best recipe. I have to take his word for it, too spicy for me. per his request, I add chuck stew meat to this. I also use the whole can of Chipotle peppers and diced green chillies as well. I had seasoned black beans as well as the kidney beans. the smell is wonderful while it is in the slow cooker.

Make this chili! turned out perfectly spicy and delicious. A couple changes: went in a little bit generously on the chipotles, and processed them in a food processor before adding. Also, used 1 pound of ground beef instead of 2, subbing in about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of bulgur which made up for the missing meat nicely and made the chili just a little healthier (, or so I want to believe). Left out the kidney beans, and didn't miss them.

I am making this for Halloween Trick or Treating!  I used ground beef and chuck roast cut into pieces.  I did not initially add the tomatoes paste based on other reviews but found that it needed more tomato flavor that came from the paste.  It is a hearty meat chili and I love it.

Tainted review.  Yes, I admit it.  I used some leftover tomatoes/sauce  from another recipe.  Rather than canned chipotles, I misread & added 2t ground chipotle pepper.  Quite smokey, but not spicy.   Oops ...

This is a Go-To recipe or guide to a very satisfying chili. 
My only change is to use pinto beans or Ranch Style (brand name) instead of kidney beans. I also use more chipotle peppers because I like that flavor a lot. Really good recipe! 
Serve with shredded cheese and/or sour cream for people that may want to "cool down" the heat.

Gave it 4 since i didn't follow it exactly because i read other reviews about spicyness and acidic.., but close and didn't slow cook, i used my pressure cooker because i had my 2 slow cookers occupied with soups...so...the changes:...i left out the   diced tomatoes & tomato sauce and subbed Ketchup..judged the amount  to make it wet..makes it sweeter the way i like..i accidentally used hot Mexican Chili powder instead of regular and i used up the rest of my chipotle peppers which was the point of me trying this recipe...i used about 5 chopped..2 cans of kidney beans, one was undrained and one cup of chicken broth, pressed stew button on my pressure cooker which was 10 minutes. naturally released it and it was awesome but very spicy for those that complained original recipe wasn't spicy enough...cleared my nose, lol...i like a lot of meat in my chili so i loved it..between prep, cooking the meat, and bringing to pressure ,natural release etc..probably about an hour to hour 15 min give or take...i cooked the onions and garlic just a little bit with the meat and spices then threw everything into the pressure cooker..

Excellent Chili, however the directions could be simplified.

 
Diced Tomatos are optional if you dont like the chunks.

Great recipe! But I made it with some modifications: Used ground turkey and added chorizo-flavored turkey sausage. Also added a can of Pato tomato sauce (it's a spicy canned sauce with jalapenos) and I definitely like to use the whole can of chipotles in adobo. Took it to work and it disappeared in a flash -- before the others made with beef!

I'm giving this four stars because I'm pretty sure it would have been great to many people almost as written, and I should have known what I was getting into from the beginning.  You have to love a supermeaty and essentially vegetable free chili.  It turns out I don't. Even if you liked a ton of meat, though, it could use some oregano, more chipotle chile, and more liquid. With those changes, some people would probably love it.  With so much meat, it seemed super one-dimensional to me.  It just wasn't my thing, and it wasn't something I'd put on my table.

Luckily, after I added beans, vegetables, and liquid it was pretty good. I had already increased the chipotle chiles significantly.  In the future, I'll just add some chipotle peppers to a completely different recipe.

I made this chili this past week and it was a big hit !!! Followed the recipe as written except used 1 can black beans & 1 can red kidney beans. Added some chicken stock and didn't need to add the tomato paste as the chili was nice & thick...The only other thing I added was 2 small finely diced carrots to help cut the acidity....We loved it and it made a nice big pot...Had a few bowls then chili dogs and some was left to freeze to enjoy later..thanks for posting the recipe, it was the first time a cooked I in the crockpot instead of the stovetop and it came out GREAT !!!!

Made this in the crockpot. Browned hot breakfast sausage, hamburger then onion in cast iron skillet, used 1 can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, run through a food processor in bottom of crockpot then added meat and onions. Add other ingredients on top. Cooked on high 5hrs.  Excellent! Will do it again

It's basically dirty rice with a tomato base. I ate this with some flour shells. I used ground turkey and turkey kielbasa sausage with jalepenos and garlic powder. Delicous!!

I've made this several times and it always turns out delicious. I follow the recipe except for a few things. I use half the amount of meat and it's still very meaty. I'm also not a fan of Italian sausage, so I use chorizo instead. I used about half the can of chipotle peppers and also added some sliced jalapenos, and it's nice and spicy. Very good served with corn bread.

Kids and hubby loved it! The kids could not stop saying how great it was and they want me to make it again - SOON!  Didn't need to make any changes. I made it exactly how it is written in this recipe. This is on the top of my list for favorite fall/winter meals :)

I've decided to write this review in case anyone else may find it helpful haha! I used this recipe as my inspiration to make a veggie chipotle chili. I had some leftover "cajun andouille sausage" from a different recipe and I wanted to make some chipotle chili with it. 

This was delicious! I used the leftover vegan sausage for the sausage and I used a can of jackfruit for the other meat substitute. It's pretty meat (or meat substitute) heavy in my opinion, but it is very good. Other than the meat substitutes, I pretty much completely followed the recipe. I added maybe a cup of vegetable broth because jackfruit will soak up a lot of liquid. I ate it originally with some vegan jalapeno cornbread, and had the leftovers with some toast.  Super tasty, definitely recommended!

Yum!  I made this tonight. I made just two changes though. I used 1 lb of beef instead of 2, also added more minced chipotle peppers, about a tablespoon in all.    It certainly packs a punch!  I loved this.   Spicy goodness!

Had made this earlier this week. Just right to bring in the fall season. It was good & hearty. The peppers really did give it a smoky taste. Only suggestion, I may add another pepper next time. Otherwise my family enjoyed this. Will be making this again.

Way too heavy on the tomato flavor for us. Would try again minus the tomato paste

This was only OK. I had some leftover chipotles in adobo sauce and was looking for a recipe to use them up.  I added extra chipotle and the finished product still wasn't very hot.  It's an average chili but nothing special.

We've made this several times, only substituting black beans for the kidney beans. A hit with the whole family!

I actually combined this with the Slow Cooker Chili II recipe, and decided I would rate both. While I didn't add the sausage, it was the addition of the chiptoles in adobo sauce that made my chili perfect. I'm used to bland recipes for homemade chili and this was the complete opposite. Thank you for sharing. I topped with dumplings, because well, why not.

This came out pretty well! I made this recipe with chorizo, ground turkey, and ground beef. I also doubled the chipotle chilis and added some extra adobo sauce. I also added a can of corn, which I think was a great addition! I have a smaller crock pot, so I could not fit all of the chili in my slow cooker. So, I had to cook what couldn't fit in a pot on the stove. I cooked it on low for about 40 minutes. I ate some of it for lunch, and it was delicious! Honestly, I think that the chili that I made on the stove turned out better than the chili I ate 8 hours later from the crock pot! I think some of the chipotle smokiness and the other flavors were too subtle after 8 hours. Next time, I think I will just cook it a little while on the stove. Serve with sharp cheddar, and it's awesome!

I thought this chili was just ok. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great. It had a very unusual chili taste and not what I am used to.

Being from TX, I have many chili recipes.  I did use the entire can of chipotle chilies & sauce. Also didn't have the canned tomatoes, so used Rotel instead.  Thanks for a new family favorite.
