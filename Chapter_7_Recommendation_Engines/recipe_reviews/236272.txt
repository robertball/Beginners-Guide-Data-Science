Great! Enjoyed it very much. It filled the house with such a fragrance that even the neighbors were curious of what I was making. Thank you for the recipe!

Simple and wonderful. Didn't have sumac so I used lemon pepper and cut back on the pepper a tad.

Sumac? - the only sumac I am familiar with is growing out in my back yard with the red cones flowers, I thought it was poisonous.  Oh no, i didn't know that photo was going to show up and i can't get rid of it- hope no one eats it.
