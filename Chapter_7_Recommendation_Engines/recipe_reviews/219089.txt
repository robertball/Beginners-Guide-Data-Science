These were so delicious! Instead of making them in a 13x9 pan, I put them in a mini muffin pan to make individual servings (24 servings). They still baked for ~20 minutes and were perfect and gooey in the middle. I would highly recommend these for a holiday treat!

To MissMarilyn88. Please don't rate a recipe unless you have made it as given. Baked goods made solely  with Splenda do not turn out well - check out online the numerous comparison tests that have been done comparing various sweetening agents in baking.

I made these in mini-muffin pan without the peppermint bark on top. After cooled, I iced them with white chocolate icing and broke the remaining bark into larger pieces and pushed them vertically into the icing.  The were beautiful little masterpieces and tasted WONDERFUL!  Took them to a family Christmas party were they were GONE in no time.  Thanks for the initial recipe and ideas!  Have a feeling this will be an annual Holiday "go-to" recipe.

Once again, I have to say, when you change the recipe and it turns out bad, don't give the original a bad star rating...this goes to the person who substituted splenda and complained of the weird texture...of course!  Splenda doesn't translate too every recipe.  Otherwise, these were really good and different, using REAL sugar.

Except for using homemade peppermint bark, I followed the recipe exactly.  These are wonderful, holiday brownies that people raved about.  The peppermint bark gives the brownies a nice crunch as well as that light minty flavor.  I know I will be making these again, soon.

Thank you!

I made these but substituted Splenda for the sugar and they came out very weird textured.  Although the flavor was very good, the texture was really off-putting -so if I try this recipe again I'm going to use regular sugar to see if it fixes the problem.

Okay, I made a couple of changes but still within the original ingredients.  I do not use anything thing but fair trade organic chocolate so that was one change.  I only had semi sweet chocolate chips so I added 2 tbsps. of organic cocoa baking powder and a tablespoon of butter.  Everyone was sold out of peppermint bark so I used Andes.  The brownies are delicious even with the changes which were more product choices than actual changes.  Definitely a keeper.

These are fantastic brownies! I made them exactly as directed and they came out great. Couple things I would do differently in the future is that I think maybe I left them in a little bit too long. The cooking time said from 15 to 20 minutes. I checked them at 15 and thought they could go longer so I let them go to 18 minutes. I think they would have been a little fudgier if I had taken them out at 15 minutes but they were still fantastic and got rave reviews from the people that I gave them to. Something else I would do differently is when you spread the melted chocolate on top it will harden making it slightly difficult to cut the brownies without cracking the chocolate. So in the future I would cut the brownies sooner than I did this time. Something else I might try is adding some decorations to the top - maybe chopped up candycane pieces or decorative sprinkles. The reason is that when the chocolate dries on top it creates a hard dull surface, not a glossy shiny one. I think the decorations on top would be really pretty.  So those are little things that I might change the second time around but I was so pleased with how these came out.  They were easy to make - they were delicious - they were very big hit with the recipients - what more could you ask!!

This was more like fudge than a brownie, but tasted awesome and was a big hit at a party.  It's super rich so a little bite is all you need.  If you love mint and chocolate, you need to try this.
