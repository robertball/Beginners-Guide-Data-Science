This was so delicious! I'm lowering my carb intake so I used thin buns in place of the italian bread. I was overwelmed by the rosemary so I only used 2 teaspoons. And for the kids we put some pizza sauce on and then the cheese. Very good! I can't wait to make it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe and all the flavors that came along with it. It's an awesome dish for outside on the patio to enjoy with friends and I will be making it again in the near future.

Wow! This was so easy and so delicious! I marinated the chicken for about an hour and it turned out moist and juicy. The only thing I added was fresh sliced tomatoes and some roasted red peppers for some added color and flavor. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing. This was perfect for a quick and easy weeknight meal and went great with a glass of wine!

This was super tasty. I used sourdough bread and grilling it is a MUST. I also used arugula but I dressed it very lightly with lemon juice and olive oil. It gave the sandwich a nice peppery zing. I t was a pain to eat. I have to be honest. The think grilled bread made it a bit hard to cut and eat. HOWEVER the flavor was so good. THANKS FOR A DELICIOUS AND FAST DINNER.

This is really a quick terrific dinner. I also added some sliced marinated red peppers to the top of the greens before adding the chicken and drizzled with balsamic vinegar right before serving

This was average. The marinade was excellent with the chicken but otherwise left a bit to the imagination. 4 adults ate this and everyone was torn between hands or utensils it just falls apart and you have a plate with the above ingredients everywhere.

The chicken in the marinade was pretty good but the sandwich part of this recipe had nothing going for it at all. Very plain dry and boring.

Chicken had good flavor but my wife and I still felt like it needed mayo. Nice easy recipe.
