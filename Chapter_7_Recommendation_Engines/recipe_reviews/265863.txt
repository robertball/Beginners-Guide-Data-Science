This was delicious!  Was looking for something quick and easy to make for dinner one night and already had 1.5 lb. of ground beef thawed out (used all of it). Was concerned the pasta would disintegrate in Instant Pot as many do but I used Target's Simply Balanced Gluten Free Fusilli and it held up very well.  The whole family loved it. Thanks for great recipe!
