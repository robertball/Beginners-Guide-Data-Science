I ate a small mountain of SOS in various mess halls.  This recipe isn't bad but its not authentic USMC SOS.  I added diced onion, garlic powder, worchester sauce and a dash of hot sauce.  That is the taste I remember!  SOS is normally served over toast but is best served over biscuits.  Try it the authentic way, thousands of US service men have eaten it that way.

Make this way for great results:
1. In a Large Skillet brown 1 pound of VERY LEAN ground beef.
2. Turn OFF heat.
3. Add to the cooked beef:
   1/4 cup softened butter,
   1/2 cup flour,
   2 tsp. instant beef bouillon granules,
   salt to (to your taste),
   ground pepper (to your taste).
REMEMBER: at this point to stir all above until flour is completely absorbed, only then can you turn on the heat at medium high.                   4. Then immediately add the milk and  Worcestershire sauce in these amounts:
   4 cups milk
   1/2 tsp. Worcestershire (optional)
5. Cook and stir until thickened.
Serve on biscuits or toast and sprinkle real bacon bits on top if desired

My husband grew up eating this dish so I decided to try it out.  This recipe was DELICIOUS!!!  The evaporated milk and beef broth is the key to this recipe.  The only addition I made was to add freshly ground mild country sausage.  I did double the white sauce to have more "gravy"  than meat.  My husband stated the addition  of fresh sausage really added MORE savory flavor than what his mom used to make it.  The family even had 2nd helpings!  I may try using texas toast or english muffins next time.

I've been looking for a way to stretch the dinner dollars when I found this recipe. My family of three loved it, and would have eaten more, so next time I won't cut the recipe back. I did add a small amount of sausage to the ground beef, and I happened to have some bacon grease left over(I always save it, refrigerate it, and use it often, instead of other forms of fat). I used it instead of the butter. Small changes, and the whole dish can be made for UNDER A DOLLAR A SERVING.

This recipe was soooo very bland.  It's good to get you started but it definitely needed work.  I added diced onion while browning the meat then seasoned it with garlic powder and a little seasoning salt.  I also added in  worcestershire & soy sauce to the roux mixture and then it was very good.

Really good!  I made a few alterations.  first, I used onion and garlic in browning the meat. worchesteshire sauce as others added too. the ratio of fat to flour in the roux didnt' work for me. I had globs of flour, not a smooth paste. tossed that and made it one to one ratio. that worked great.  I used about 3/4 of the can of evap milk to the 1 cup beef broth, added some dill to the whole thing, and served over pasta. the kiddos gobbled it up! the hub raved.

Military SOS is good over just about anything. I LOVE mine over eggs...any kind of eggs. Try adding diced jalapeno peppers.

Family loved it with a few changes. Cooked ground beef with onions and garlic powder. Then made roux with flour and butter. Added one can of beef consomme, milk, more garlic powder, seasoning salt, parsley, pepper, and worchestershire. Thickened a little more with a mixture of corn starch and water. Served over toast and it was awesome!

This is much better than how my Mom made it when I was little, I took the first reviewer's advice and added chopped onion, garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce. This was so yummy! I served it over mashed potatoes like my Mom used to, great recipe :)

I have to say being a military brat and an active duty USMC it needs diced onion, garlic powder, worchester sauce and a dash of hot sauce. Just like the others have said.

Very good. I added hot sauce and chopped onion and garlic powder.  Add a side of hash browns and it makes for a comfy filling meal.

I grew up on this recipe!  My parents PGd the title down for us calling it poop on the roof, although the title is not all that appealing the meal is delish! We always put it over mashed potatoes and threw insome onions and garlic and used regular milk instead of evaporated.

This turned out awesome!  I did make a few changes, however.  I did use 1 lb. lean ground beef, 2 1-/2 tbls. butter and I used about 5 tbls. flour, I used chicken broth instead of beef, as I was out and I used the whole can of broth, so as not to waste.  I also microwaved frozen veges in my microcooker and then added it all together.  I took refrig. biscuits and baked those in the oven while preparing the rest.  Just open the biscuits up and pour on the sauce!  My whole family, including my older infant daughter loved it!

I made this for breakfast along with toast and scrambled eggs for my husband, a former marine.  He said it took him back almost 20 years & he loved it and can't wait till I make it again.  I used the advice of others and added some onion.

This is so addictive, I can't stop eating it.  I used finely diced onions, minced garlic, and lots of Worcestershire sauce, during the browning of the meat. To give the whole thing a health boost, I used brown flour, for some hidden fiber in the mix.  It works just as well as white flour, with added benefits.  It was so good I just ate it like soup.  But will have it with rye toast with the kids.

I didn't like the chipped beef on toast while in the Marines, but loved the ground beef SOS. You only need ketsup and pepper for seasoning. I'll try both USMC and Army recipies.

Tried this recipe tonight.  Took advice of one reviewer who suggested adding onion soup mix.  Turned out very hearty and delicious!  Would reduce the soup mix to 1/2 as it was a bit salty next time.

This was pretty good, but didn't have a lot of flavor on it's own.  I used a lot of seasoning on the meat and it helped.  This was very filling, however--it sits in your stomach like a rock!  My bf and I couldn't move for awhile after filling up on this!

I can remember eating this as a kid. Haven't had it forever. When I saw this recipe, I just had to make it. I did add a little milk to thin it, and we ate it over biscuits. My kids loved it. It's fast, cheap and very filling! Great comfort food. 
Thanks for the memories, and the recipe.

MY HUSBAND IS AN EX-MARINE AND HE REMEMBERS EATING THIS STUFF ALL THE TIME.  I DID ADD SOME MORE REGULAR MILK AT THE END TO GIVE IT MORE GRAVY AND I ADDED SOME MORE SPICES TO THE MEAT BUT I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GREAT RECIPE AND MY KIDS LOVED IT.  I SERVED OVER MASHED POTATOES. WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN FOR A FAST AND EASY DINNER

Sorry, not like any SOS I have ever had. I checked so many times to check that it really wanted me to add a full cup of beef broth. I used Campbell’s and I swear that is all you tasted.  The family still ate it but it wasn’t what I wanted.

This SOS recipe turned out well. I did cook the meat with fresh onion and used ground garlic. By the time I finish making the biscuits I will have to add milk to thin out because I think it is a bit thick.

I love this quick easy recipe. And my husband and kids are always full after the second price of toast. But I like to kick it up a bit and add just a pinch or two of smoked paprika when I season it.

This didn't taste exactly as my husband remembers from his days in the Marine Corp, but it was delish! I added about 4 or 5 splashes of Worcestershire sauce, and  some onion powder, and garlic powder. I served it over mashed potatoes on toast. YUMMY!

I have never eaten SOS, so I have nothing to compare it to, but this tasted very good.  I will double the cream sauce next time.  I served it over biscuits made with the remaining evaporated milk.  Simple and delicious.

Wasn't overly impressed. Basic recipe was kinda bland. Added worchestershire sauce didn't help that much. Wasn't bad, but not what I was looking for. Sorry.

The basic is great. However, substituting chipped beef, adding two TBS of onion and one TBS of red bell pepper takes it to the next level.

Just thought I'd let everyone know, SOS stands for SH*T ON A SHINGLE.  My dad was a Marine and we ate this a lot growing up, the name doesn't do it justice cause it's G-R-E-A-T!

This is a good basic recipe. I thought it was a little on the bland side but nothing a little chopped onion, garlic, cumin and Adobo didn't fix. All these things I added to taste so no measurements to give to you. Cheap and easy meal. Enjoy!

I thought this was very good! Per the reviews, I added some onion, garlic powder and worchestershire sauce. I tried it with the toast and it was tasty but then I put some over some pasta shells and it was more my speed! :-)

Wonderful!  My wife's stomach was bothering her, so I needed something that wasn't spicy at all.  I found this recipe and thought I'd give it a try.  Expecting it to be boring and flavorless, I was in for quite the surprise!  It's very easy to make and quite tasty.  The flavor reminded us a little of chicken fried steak.

I used ground turkey instead of beef.  Turned out great.

I found this recipe a couple of weeks ago when looking for something to do with hamburger. I've have hamburger gravy before and liked it. This on the other hand was AWESOME! I'm a mom of 2 and this was quick, easy and terrific. It makes a very nice hearty meal. I served mine with egg noodles and we had green beans for a side. It's not the most attractive meal, but who cares when it taste this good!

I thought this recipe was simple and delicious. I seasoned the ground beef while it was cooking with Seasoned Salt, onions, and diced garlic. Then I also added (per the suggestion of some other members) Worcestershire to the cream sauce. Because of the seasonings I added, it didnt need much salt. I served it on Texas Toast and it was great!

A wonderful SOS - takes me way back to a great time - the chow hall.
I did add soy sauce and worsteshire sauce and, because I did not have evaporated milk, I used whipping cream and it turned out to be rich and flavorful.  I did need to cut it a bit with milk though.  
I also used the gravy mixture for swiss steak which was very tasty.
Over all we'll have it again and again.

I like this a lot. I served it with egg noddles and it's basically beef stroganoff. But it was good and my husband liked it. I'll keep it around.

My daddy was a cook in the Navy during WWII and we used to look it when he cooked this when we were kids.  I am a grandmother now, and I cooked this for my kids when they were growing up. 
Here are some VARIATIONS:
Add Onion soup mix in the gravy, gives it a great taste. We love it over noodles.

Use canned dried beef, that's was one of the ways Daddy used to make it. (I don't even know if they till sell that).

Was good for an SOS recipe. Best I have tried. The only change would be to serve over homemade mashed potatoes rather than toast.

What with the positive reviews I expected to be more excited with the finished product. It was a decent dish - I guess you can only expect so much with ground beef. But it wasn't exciting new taste sensation or anything. It makes a good staple and would be extra good in winter. I will probably make it once every now and then, but I'm not in any hurry. Note: I added chopped onion and canned mushrooms as other reviewers suggested. I'd say that it definitely needs it.
